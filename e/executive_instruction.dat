40|$|This audit {{assessed}} {{the effectiveness of}} the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency 2 ̆ 7 s management of the regulation of Commonwealth nuclear, radiation facilities and sources, including its compliance with its legislative requirements. Overall conclusion Radiation and nuclear technologies have diverse applications in the government, commercial, health and research sectors, including x‑ray scanning for security purposes, the use of lasers for scientific research {{and the production of}} radioactive substances at Lucas Heights. While the risks to {{human health and the environment}} posed by such technologies have long been recognised, they can be effectively managed through the appropriate use and care of equipment and materials by operators and the application of an effective regulatory framework. Australian Government entities’ use of radiation and nuclear technologies is regulated by the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency (ARPANSA), while state and territory based regulators are responsible for administering radiation protection legislation in their jurisdictions, covering operators such as hospitals, universities and industry. ARPANSA has been generally effective in managing key aspects of the regulatory framework applying to the possession and use of radiation and nuclear sources and facilities by Australian Government entities. ARPANSA has developed and implemented procedures for licensing and monitoring regulated entities, supported by a suite of guidance materials for staff and regulated entities. ARPANSA also continues to develop and apply a risk‑based approach to regulation which, if further expanded to the assessment of licence applications and its inspection program, could improve the focus and cost‑effectiveness of its administration. However, shortcomings identified in an earlier (2005) ANAO performance audit, relating to the management of potential conflicts of interest and the application of cost‑recovery arrangements, have not been fully addressed and have detracted from ARPANSA’s overall performance in administering the regulatory framework. To support the administration of its licensing responsibilities under the framework, ARPANSA has, since 2005, published a range of guidance materials, forms, and assessment templates that align with the relevant legislative requirements. The ANAO’s analysis of a sample of licence applications indicated that licensing decisions were, with one exception, supported by an appropriate level of evidence. There has also been a significant improvement in the average time taken to assess applications for source licences, from 153 days in 2007 – 08 to 42 days in 2012 – 13. However, the licence assessment process could be further improved by providing clear advice to applicants on ARPANSA’s expectations relating to supporting information, to avoid repeated ARPANSA requests for additional information and often lengthy delays in the application assessment process. There is also scope for ARPANSA to extend its risk‑based regulatory approach to the licence assessment process, to enable staff to focus on the hazard of each source or facility and the applicant’s compliance history. Further development of the risk‑based approach would help streamline the licensing process, better target available resources and reduce the regulatory impost on applicants. ARPANSA’s approach to monitoring entities’ compliance with regulatory requirements focuses on regular entity reporting and a periodic schedule of inspections, including unannounced inspections. Since 2005, ARPANSA has established procedures for monitoring entities’ compliance with their reporting requirements and assessment of entities’ reports, addressing a shortcoming identified in the ANAO’s earlier audit. Further, between 2008 – 09 and 2012 – 13, ARPANSA has mostly met its target of 60 planned inspections per year, and the inspections observed by the ANAO largely followed the documented procedures. To address identified non‑compliance, ARPANSA applies a graded approach, which requires entities to report on corrective action undertaken to remediate breaches, and which may trigger additional inspections in the event of identified non‑compliance. However, aspects of the inspection process, particularly unannounced inspections, are largely driven by geographical convenience rather than risk, and ARPANSA’s risk‑based approach should also be extended to this aspect of its operations. The ANAO observed in 2005 that ARPANSA’s legislated functions, including its role as both a regulator and a licence holder, create scope for potential conflicts of interest. While ARPANSA continues to exercise functions which may give rise to such conflicts, only recently, in 2011, did it formally enter into an arrangement for an outside body to undertake independent inspections of its compliance with its own licence conditions. To date however, only one external inspection has been conducted, and an ongoing program of independent reviews would strengthen confidence in ARPANSA’s arrangements for managing potential conflicts of interest and its compliance with licence conditions. ARPANSA has also released a Chief <b>Executive</b> <b>Instruction</b> (CEI) to provide guidance to staff in managing their self‑regulatory role and when providing scientific and advisory services, including those on a fee‑for‑service basis, to regulated agencies—aspects of ARPANSA’s work which can also give rise to conflicts of interest. However, there is no evidence that the CEI is actively implemented or monitored, nor is any training provided for staff on conflicts of interest issues. ARPANSA should strengthen its approach to managing conflicts of interest, assisted by its Audit and Risk Committee. While ARPANSA’s cost‑recovery arrangements have evolved since 2005, several aspects remain inconsistent with better practice. Since 2008 – 09 ARPANSA has under‑recovered its regulatory expenses by almost 4  million, and has used revenues from its scientific and advisory services functions to cross‑subsidise its regulatory function. Further, ARPANSA’s calculations indicate that there is cross‑subsidisation occurring between licence holders. While intra‑government charging is excluded from the Australian Government Cost Recovery Guidelines (the Guidelines), ARPANSA has informed stakeholders that it has adopted the Guidelines as a basis for implementing a better practice approach to cost recovery, which includes the avoidance of cross‑subsidisation between business activities. In the course of the audit, ARPANSA initiated a review of its cost recovery arrangements to better align them with the Guidelines. The ANAO’s 2005 performance audit of ARPANSA’s regulatory function made 19 recommendations. Between 2005 and 2007 there was limited work to implement the recommendations, with significant delays experienced. Despite several assessments of progress in recent years and regular monitoring by ARPANSA management and the Audit and Risk Committee, in the course of this audit the ANAO assessed that only 11 recommendations have been adequately implemented, with six partially implemented. By not implementing agreed recommendations in a timely manner, ARPANSA has foregone opportunities to enhance its performance. The ANAO has made four recommendations aimed at strengthening ARPANSA’s management of potential conflicts of interest and expanding the risk‑based approach to regulation...|$|E
40|$|Extended {{abstract}} 1 -IntroductionUncontrolled {{development of}} large cities {{due to the}} increase in population and migration has led to a massive environmental destruction and pollution, and the latter has destroyed green spaces within the city and changed the land use. Therefore, the need for green space and connection with nature has an important role in human life. The best way to reduce the destructive effects of environmental hazards is the development of green space. Due to its wide range of functions, green area plays dominant roles in urban landscaping, air refreshing, reducing air contaminations and controlling uncontrolled construction development. There are several reports to prove the idea that green areas, especially in condensed urban regions are of great importance for public health, performance increase and better quality of life. Provision of green area per capita {{is one of the most}} important issues in national development. 2 -Theoretical basesHistory of human-nature relation may be divided into four stages: 1 - human lived in harmony with nature; 2 - human improved his control over the nature; 3 - human started to destroy nature by the power of technology and industry; and 4 - human begins realized that they have responsibilities and need to preserve the nature. We live in the fourth stage and development of green area is one our measures and age long interests. Development of green area started in Iran in 1950 s by opening “national garden” in Tehran, which later renamed “City park”. Parks, gardens and garden houses with European style have emerged in Iran since 1970 s. Parks and green area are the main factors in the improvement of security and solidarity in cities. However, urban life issues, security issues, and unsuitable spaces design for specific age group and genders are some of the factors which make citizen reluctant to use the spaces. In some districts in Tehran city, there is no relation between population density and green area per capita. As a result, population density and economic factors have tacked quality of life and mental and spiritual health of the citizens. This is to say that knowledge about quality and quantity of such spaces for each district is an important factor in urban planning. The main concern regarding living environment is lack of natural air ventilation, stability of contaminant elements, arid weather and dusts, noise pollution, lack of enough leisure facilities, ugly face of city, and damages to natural ecosystems. In this regard, development of green areas and planting trees are promising solutions. 3 -DiscussionTehran city managed 72433389 m 2 green areas in 2006 parks, artificial forests, squares and boulevards and sidewalks. Green area per capita in Tehran is 9. 2 m 2. However, this figure varies between different areas (within the scope of this study, this figure is 12 m 2). In general, 50 % of land area is dedicated to living spaces, 25 % to roads and access passages, 15 % to sport and green area facilities and 10 % to other usages and services. Green area portion in Tehran urban planning is 10 % and ratio of green area to neighborhoods is 12. 2 %. Therefore, there is a lack of green area to meet the standards. In general, factors under consideration regarding green areas are divided into negative factors (variety of pollutions, civil development operation, increase in population density and increase of demand for green area) and positive factors (green belt of the city, development of parks, squares and sidewalks). As ascertained by the surveys, dist. 18 enjoys highest rate of green area per capita and dist. 7 and 10 are at the bottom of the list. Dist. 19 has the largest green area portion (37 %) and dist. 9 the smallest portion (4 %). As statistics show, green area development is not consistent with population density. Between 1996 - 2006, the city developed for 1. 4 %. With this rate, Tehran will be home to a population of 8987124 in 2016. This population needs 10784548 m 2 of green area, which necessitates accurate and comprehensive planning in this regard. Moreover, parks location surveys in dists. 1, 3, 8, 10, 12, 13, 19, and 21 revealed underdevelopment of parks and green areas for the districts. In addition, regional parks are not comparable to the number of neighborhood parks. Surveys further showed that distribution of green area in the city is not ideal so that green area per capita for dists. 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, and 21 is less than 12 m 2, while dists 22, 20, 19, 18, 16 and 3 enjoy excessive green areas. 4 - ConclusionPreservation of green area is one of the factors of permanent urban development, which also is of great importance for citizen health. However, lack of such spaces, different usage of such area, and lack of proper managerial procedures have resulted in the lack of enough green areas for the citizen. In fact, Tehran suffers both from lack of green area and unequal distribution of these facilities. Downtown is empty of such spaces, while suburbs have main portion of the green area. However, a proper planning is possible by studying distribution of such spaces and expected population growth. Accurate and updated statistics, reasonable scheduling, efficient managerial practice, provision of budget and equipment, cooperation of citizen and raising their interest to the matter, introduction of plans through mass media, codification of regulations for preservation of green area, basing the plans on results of academic research, support of the projects, cooperation between organs and departments all are of paramount importance. 5 – Suggestions- Stopping expansion trend and reducing population density in suburbs- Stopping all development in forests, gardens and establishing polluting industries in urban regions. - Defining development of green areas, sport and leisure spaces in all urban neighborhoods as an <b>executive</b> <b>instruction.</b> - Expanding city borders only for development of green areas. - Necessity to review and codify land preservation regulation to protect trees with usage as green are and operating such area as one of the top priority for saving green life of the city. This must be implemented through a comprehensive urban plan with executive guarantees. Support from legislative bodies for preservation of the green area in the city.

Walter F. Salter, former manager of the Canadian branch of the Watch Tower Society, also criticized Rutherford's use of Beth Sarim. A reply to Salter's criticisms of Rutherford was published in the May 2, 1937, Golden Age, with a photocopy of a letter from W. E.

Not one cent of the funds of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society went into either of the Cadillac cars used by Rutherford at San Diego and Brooklyn. They were the gift of friends. The magazine Consolation (successor to The Golden Age) explained that Beth Sarim served as Rutherford's winter headquarters: For twelve winters Judge Rutherford and his office force occupied Beth Sarim.

500|$|Attention and {{concentration}} are {{assessed by the}} serial sevens test (or alternatively by spelling a five-letter word backwards), and by testing digit span. Memory is assessed in terms of immediate registration (repeating a set of words), short-term memory (recalling the set of words after an interval, or recalling a short paragraph), and long-term memory (recollection of well known historical or geographical facts). Visuospatial functioning can be assessed by the ability to copy a diagram, draw a clock face, or draw {{a map of the}} consulting room. Language is assessed through the ability to name objects, repeat phrases, and by observing the individual's spontaneous speech and response to <b>instructions.</b> <b>Executive</b> functioning can be screened for by asking the [...] "similarities" [...] questions ("what do x and y have in common?") and by means of a verbal fluency task (e.g. [...] "list as many words as you can starting with the letter F, in one minute"). The mini-mental state examination is a simple structured cognitive assessment which is in widespread use as a component of the MSE.|$|R

During this year, the Venezuelan Air Force {{underwent}} {{a change in}} its structural organization to be reformed in the following way: General Aviation Command as central control, a Department of Aviation and Inspectorate General of Aviation as advisory bodies, and implementing three <b>executive</b> commands: The <b>Instruction</b> Air Command, The Service Air Command, and the Air Combat Command. This unit {{was assigned to the}} Air Combat Command. During 1969, an unfortunate accident happened with a B-25 Mitchell aircraft in the city of Barquisimeto, where Senior Technical Sergeant (Av) Esteban Sánchez Pachano died. Over the passing years, this unit housed weapons systems such as Canberra, F-86K and F-86F; the latter being those that gave life to this operational unit and were the first aircraft assigned to the Operational Air Base Unit. This occurred in July 1971 when the Air Fighter Group No. 12 assigned this facility as its headquarters. In the course of this year, the Canberra, which had been so outstanding in this unit, was moved to Barcelona.|$|R
