Using <b>flock</b> <b>printing,</b> a dirt-absorbing text or pattern is printed on a less dirt-absorbing surface {{in order to create a}} slow but direct response to pollution. Drivers are reminded of their impact on the city, which is also visible to others passing by. This project embraces complexity, making a problematic and abstract issue local and tangible...|$|E
50|$|Flock {{consists}} of synthetic fibers {{that look like}} tiny hairs. <b>Flock</b> <b>print</b> feels somewhat velvet and a bit elevated. The length of the fibers can vary in thickness which co-determines {{the appearance of the}} flocked product. Thin fibers produce a soft velvety surface, thicker fibers a more bristle-like surface.|$|R

The effect of the filler and level of sizing on the paperboard interlayer strength, as well as resistance to bending and absorbancy ability have been studied. The tests have been performed on the number of double folds of paperboard with flocked coating and without it in machine and cross-machine direction. Different brands of paperboard, flock and gluing compositions have been analysed and recommendations for the gluing of various packaging made from <b>flocked</b> <b>printing</b> materials have been presented...|$|R

Although the etiology of pulmonary fibrosis is generally unknown, several sources of evidence support the hypothesis that a number of environmental and occupational agents play an etiologic role in the pathogenesis of this disease.

40|$|Laser cutting {{technology}} is now widely associated with textiles, but {{prior to the}} research of designers such as Janet Stoyel, in the early 1990 s, it {{was regarded as a}} non textile specific technology. Over the past ten years many contemporary designers have used laser technology in conjunction with textiles; leading to the widely seen ‘cut through’ design aesthetic, as exemplified by the work of product designer, Tord Boontje. The technology, however, has not been vigorously exploited and tested in conjunction with traditional textile processes such as <b>flocking,</b> foiling, and <b>print.</b> This paper discusses and discloses my recent research which investigates the use of laser cutting technology in conjunction with traditional textile design processes. The research focuses on how the design process is informed and indeed defined by the parameters of the technology, and has led to the design and development of a range of innovative textile fabrics and products. The research examines the capabilities of the technology to cut down into a surface, removing and revealing layers, structure, color and patterns within fabrics. Traditional textile design processes, such as screen and digital <b>printing,</b> <b>flocking,</b> foiling, and bonding have been used to apply color, texture or pattern to the surface and the interior of the textiles. The work has been inspired by the concept of ‘natures reclaim’ and asks the question ‘what will remain after the noise of our time on earth?’ Inspiration is taken from archaeology, traces of human habitation and history to be found on the surface and deep within the layers of the soil...|$|R
