5|$|After {{a safety}} is scored, {{the ball is}} put into play by a free <b>kick.</b> <b>The</b> team that was scored upon must <b>kick</b> <b>the</b> ball from their own 20-yard line and can punt, drop kick, or place <b>kick</b> <b>the</b> ball. In {{professional}} play, a kicking tee cannot be used – however, a tee {{can be used in}} high school or college football. Once the ball has been kicked, it can be caught and advanced by any member of the receiving team, and it can be recovered by the kicking team if the ball travels at least 10 yards and bounces at least once or a player of the receiving team touches the ball.|$|E
5|$|A {{field goal}} (FG), worth three points, is scored {{when the ball}} is placekicked or dropkicked through the {{uprights}} and over the crossbars of the defense's goalposts. After a PAT attempt or successful field goal the scoring team must <b>kick</b> <b>the</b> ball off to the other team.|$|E
5|$|A {{safety is}} scored {{when the ball}} carrier is tackled in his own end zone. Safeties are worth two points, which are awarded to the defense. In addition, the team that conceded the safety must <b>kick</b> <b>the</b> ball to the scoring team via a free kick.|$|E

5|$|Simkins had {{signaled}} for a fair catch, but North Carolina's Frank M. Osborne {{collided with}} him. Sewanee was awarded fifteen yards {{and the free}} <b>kick.</b> <b>The</b> star for the Tar Heels that day was Herman Koehler.|$|E
5|$|Both Wake Forest and Georgia Tech mounted several drives {{into the}} other's territory, but were either stopped outside field goal range or {{attempted}} to convert a fourth down rather than <b>kick</b> <b>the</b> ball. As the quarter {{came to an}} end, the score remained tied 33, with neither team having scored a touchdown.|$|E
5|$|During the Copenhagen derby at Brøndby on 17 April 2017, Augustinsson had dead rats {{thrown at}} him by home {{supporters}} {{as he prepared}} to take a corner kick.

50|$|A toe punt (also {{known as}} a toe poke or a toe-ender) is a method of <b>kicking</b> <b>the</b> ball in {{association}} football. Unlike other methods of <b>kicking,</b> <b>the</b> toe punt uses the toe end of the boot rather than the instep or laces.|$|R
5|$|However, the Jets {{cut into}} Oakland's lead when Namath drove the offense 73 yards down field {{and ran the}} ball in for a 1-yard {{touchdown}} with five seconds remaining in the first half. The Jets lined up as if to <b>kick</b> <b>the</b> extra point, but holder and backup quarterback Babe Parilli tried to complete a two-point conversion pass, which fell incomplete. The Raiders led the Jets 14–12 at halftime.|$|E
5|$|In the National Federation of State High School Associations (NFHS) rulebook, {{the fair}} catch kick is {{specifically}} {{defined as a}} free <b>kick.</b> <b>The</b> National Football League (NFL) rulebook specifically states that the fair catch kick is not a free kick, instead considering the fair catch kick to be a distinct type of kick. Despite this, reporters at both levels describe the fair catch kick as a free kick.|$|E

5|$|The Hampden Roar {{was first}} noticed {{in a game}} against England in 1929. Scotland, who had played the second half with ten players due to an injury to Alex Jackson, {{equalised}} in the final minute with a goal from Alec Cheyne direct from a corner <b>kick.</b> <b>The</b> roar that followed the goal was so loud that Jackson, who was a mile away in the Glasgow Victoria Infirmary, could tell that Scotland had scored.|$|E
5|$|The {{incompletion}} on 3rd down {{stopped the}} clock with 2:11 {{left in the}} game. The field goal attempt was placed from 39 yards away, which is not considered a particularly difficult field goal distance by NFL standards. Because the game was played indoors at the Metrodome, there were no adverse weather conditions that might have affected the <b>kick.</b> <b>The</b> ball was snapped on 4th down with punter Mitch Berger holding. The Vikings faced a heavy rush from cornerback Michael Booker {{on the left side}} of the line of scrimmage and cornerbacks Ronnie Bradford and Ray Buchanan on the right, who ran into Anderson and knocked him to the ground after the <b>kick.</b> <b>The</b> ball sailed about a foot wide left of the upright with 2:07 left on the game clock. Afterward, Anderson stood with arms akimbo on the field momentarily before heading to the sideline, as Falcons players celebrated around him.|$|E
5|$|Chelsea again {{were the}} away {{team to a}} lower {{opponent}} in the quarter-finals, facing Derby County of the Championship. In the first half, Eden Hazard gave Chelsea the lead, later doubled by a Filipe Luís free <b>kick,</b> <b>the</b> full-back's first for Chelsea. Craig Bryson halved the deficit for Derby, but soon afterwards defender Jake Buxton was sent off for a foul on Loïc Rémy and André Schürrle scored the final goal of a 3–1 Chelsea win. In the semi-final, Chelsea beat Liverpool 2–1 on aggregate after Branislav Ivanović scored the winning goal {{in the first half}} of extra time in the second leg, heading in Willian's free kick.|$|E
50|$|<b>Kicking</b> {{distance}}: <b>The</b> <b>kicking</b> {{distance is}} <b>the</b> most distant unarmed fighting {{position in which}} consistent contact {{can be made with}} the opponent.

Meanwhile, Fremantle were held goalless in the opening quarter with Nathan Fyfe missing two set shots at goal.|$|R

5|$|Dewar {{moved to}} Taranaki in 1910, {{where he played}} his club rugby for Stratford; he captained the team in 1913. He was first {{selected}} for Taranaki that year and continued to represent the club until {{the outbreak of the}} First World War. In 1912, Taranaki, with Dewar in the team, came close to winning the Ranfurly Shield from Auckland, losing 6–5. In front of a 12,000-spectator home crowd, Auckland dominated in the first half, scoring six points through a try and a penalty <b>kick.</b> <b>The</b> second half saw Taranaki's forwards take control for long periods, resulting in a converted try, but despite ongoing attacks, the visitors were unable to add to their score and lost by just one point.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, he was {{involved}} in a horrific on-field incident with Geelong's Steven King. As King attempted to <b>kick</b> <b>the</b> ball out of mid-air, he missed and collected White's face {{at the height of his}} leg's swing, causing facial injuries that required extensive surgery, inserting five metal plates and 14screws into White's jaw and face. It was viewed as an accident by the AFL tribunal and no action was taken against King. As the incident took place in Melbourne's final match of the season—Geelong winning the match and knocking Melbourne out of the finals—White was able to recover during the off-season and did not miss a match, despite the severity of the injury. White's wedding to his fiancée Stacy was postponed until later in the year due to the injury.|$|E
5|$|In {{his first}} {{thirteen}} weeks {{as a professional}} football player, Hester recorded six return touchdowns, including a punt return in his NFL debut, and a then-record tying 108-yard touchdown from a missed field goal against the New York Giants. He also returned a punt for a clutch 83-yard game-winning touchdown against the Arizona Cardinals to give the Bears the lead in a comeback win, and two kickoff returns in one game against the St. Louis Rams. Following his record-breaking game during Week 14, opposing teams exercised additional caution when allowing Hester to return kicks. During the postseason Hester ran back a punt at a critical moment against the Seattle Seahawks, but it was called back on a blocking penalty. Regardless, the Bears won both NFC playoffs rounds, and advanced to Super Bowl XLI to play the Indianapolis Colts. He started the game on a high note for the Bears by returning the game’s opening kick for a touchdown. The feat was the first touchdown return of an opening kickoff in Super Bowl history. It also marked the quickest touchdown scored in Super Bowl history {{as well as the}} quickest lead ever taken by any team, though the latter record has since been surpassed by the Seahawks in Super Bowl XLVIII. Following the <b>kick,</b> <b>the</b> Colts did not <b>kick</b> <b>the</b> ball directly to Hester, significantly limiting the Bears’ return efforts.|$|E

5|$|In the 22ndminute, a lofted through-pass from Carrick found Rooney on {{the left}} wing, but the Liverpudlian's cross was blocked by Touré and {{went out for a}} corner <b>kick.</b> <b>The</b> corner, taken by Giggs, found Ronaldo, but the Portuguese got too far under the ball and headed over. Precise passing from the Barcelona midfield got the Catalans moving upfield until a {{shoulder}} charge from Anderson sent Iniesta stumbling to the ground in the inside-left channel 30yards from goal. The consequent free kick was taken by Xavi, who sent the ball just wide of the near post. Another free kick followed, as Messi was bundled over by a double-challenge from Vidić and Carrick, but it came to nothing.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1950s, the Manchester City manager Les McDowall {{introduced}} a new tactical system using a deep-lying centre-forward, which {{became known as the}} Revie Plan after Don Revie who played centre-forward. The system depended on maintaining possession of the ball wherever possible, which required Trautmann to make use of his throwing ability. For goalkeepers of Trautmann's era, it was usual to <b>kick</b> <b>the</b> ball as far as possible downfield after making a save. By contrast, Trautmann, influenced by the Hungarian goalkeeper Gyula Grosics, sought to start attacks by throwing the ball to a wing-half, typically Ken Barnes or John McTavish. The wing-half then passed to Revie to develop the attack.|$|E
5|$|Maryland's {{special teams}} {{recorded}} one touchdown when Torrey Smith returned a kickoff for 99yards. After the first touchdown of the game, senior placekicker Obi Egekeze missed an extra {{point for the}} first time in his career. Early in the season, Egekeze missed his first five field goal attempts, but, prior to the Humanitarian Bowl, he had made all 64extra-point attempts of his career. After the first failed kick, Egekeze made the other five extra-point attempts of the game. The placekicker also erred when he attempted to <b>kick</b> <b>the</b> ball as it fell off the tee, resulting in a short 15-yard kick which was returned 36yards by Nevada to the Maryland nine-yard line.|$|E
