50|$|Ro-vibrational spectra {{are usually}} {{measured}} at high spectral resolution. In the past, this {{was achieved by}} using an echelle grating as the spectral dispersion element in a grating spectrometer. This {{is a type of}} diffraction grating optimized to use higher diffraction orders. The resolving power of an FTIR spectrometer depends on the maximum retardation of the moving mirror. For example, to achieve a resolution of 0.1 cm−1, the moving mirror must have a maximum displacement of 10 cm from its position at zero path difference. Connes measured the vibration-rotation spectrum of Venusian CO2 at this resolution. A spectrometer with 0.001 cm−1 resolution is now available commercially. The throughput advantage of FTIR is important for <b>high-resolution</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> as the monochromator in a dispersive instrument with the same resolution would have very narrow entrance and exit slits.|$|E
