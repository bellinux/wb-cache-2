Certain types of induced subgraphs indicate whether a <b>graph</b> is a <b>line</b> <b>graph.</b> For example, the claw is not a <b>line</b> <b>graph.</b> This thesis gives a careful characterization of the main theorem of <b>line</b> <b>graphs,</b> that is, the necessary and sufficient conditions for a graph to be a <b>line</b> <b>graph.</b> We show the relationship between triangles, forbidden subgraphs, Krausz partitions and <b>line</b> <b>graphs</b> by providing additional lemmas which aim to support the main theorem.

De Bruijn graphs give a motivation to investigate this class since they are directed <b>line</b> <b>graphs.</b> Another motivation for learning about directed <b>line</b> <b>graphs</b> arises from the study of the sum-productalgorithm for low density parity check codes. We work with a very general class of directed graphs that allow multiple edges and loops, which are called nets by Harary.

Given a <b>line</b> <b>graph</b> H, ILIGRA constructs its root graph G with the time complexity being linear {{in the number of}} nodes in H. If ILIGRA does not know whether the given graph H is a <b>line</b> <b>graph,</b> it firstly assumes that H is a <b>line</b> <b>graph</b> and starts its root graph construction. During the root graph construction, ILIGRA checks whether the given graph H is a <b>line</b> <b>graph</b> and ILIGRA stops once it finds H is not a <b>line</b> <b>graph.</b> The time complexity of ILIGRA with <b>line</b> <b>graph</b> checking is linear in the number of links in the given graph H.

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a new edge-based {{matching}} kernel for graphs by using discrete-time quantum walks. To this end, we commence by transforming a graph into a directed <b>line</b> <b>graph.</b> The reasons {{of using the}} <b>line</b> <b>graph</b> structure are twofold. First, for a <b>graph,</b> its directed <b>line</b> <b>graph</b> is a dual representation and each vertex of the <b>line</b> <b>graph</b> represents a corresponding edge in the original graph. Second, we show that the discrete-time quantum walk {{can be seen as}} a walk on the <b>line</b> <b>graph</b> and the state space of the walk is the vertex set of the <b>line</b> <b>graph,</b> i. e., the state space of the walk is the edges of the original graph. As a result, the directed <b>line</b> <b>graph</b> provides an elegant way of developing new edge-based matching kernel based on discrete-time quantum walks. For a pair of graphs, we compute the h-layer depth-based representation for each vertex of their directed <b>line</b> <b>graphs</b> by computing entropic signatures (computed from discrete-time quantum walks on the <b>line</b> <b>graphs)</b> on the family of K-layer expansion subgraphs rooted at the vertex, i. e., we compute the depth-based representations for edges of the original graphs through their directed <b>line</b> <b>graphs.</b> Based on the new representations, we define an edge-based matching method for the pair of graphs by aligning the h-layer depth-based representations computed through the directed <b>line</b> <b>graphs.</b> The new edge-based matching kernel is thus computed by counting the number of matched vertices identified by the matching method on the directed <b>line</b> <b>graphs.</b> Experiments on standard graph datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our new kernel...|$|R

The <b>line</b> <b>graph</b> transforms links {{in the original}} graph into nodes. In this paper, we investigate how graph metrics in the original graph are mapped into those for its <b>line</b> <b>graph.</b> In particular, we study the degree distribution and the assortativity of a <b>graph</b> and its <b>line</b> <b>graph.</b> Specifically, we show, both analytically and numerically, the degree distribution of the <b>line</b> <b>graph</b> of an Erdos-Rényi graph follows the same distribution as its original graph.

Graph Theory 8 (1984) 303 – 307] and Veldman [H. J. Veldman, On {{dominating}} and spanning circuits in graphs, Discrete Math. 124 (1994) 229 – 239] gave minimum degree {{conditions of}} a <b>line</b> <b>graph</b> guaranteeing the <b>line</b> <b>graph</b> to be hamiltonian. In this paper, we investigate the similar conditions guaranteeing a <b>line</b> <b>graph</b> to be traceable. In particular, we show the following result: let G {{be a simple}} graph of order n and L(G) its <b>line</b> <b>graph.</b> If n is sufficiently large and, either δ(L(G)) > 2 ⌊n− 84 ⌋; or δ(L(G)) > 2 ⌊n− 2010 ⌋ and G is almost bridgeless, then L(G) is traceable. As a byproduct, we also show that every 2 -edge-connected triangle-free simple graph with order at most 9 has a spanning trail. These results are all best possible...|$|R

That is, a <b>graph</b> is a <b>line</b> <b>graph</b> if and only if no subset of its vertices induces one of these nine graphs.
