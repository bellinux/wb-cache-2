2500|$|Upon {{learning}} of his death, Dahmer's mother Joyce Flint responded angrily to the media: [...] "Now is everybody <b>happy?</b> <b>Now</b> that he's bludgeoned to death, {{is that good}} enough for everyone?" [...] The response of the families of Dahmer's victims was mixed, although it appears most were pleased with his death.

2500|$|On 12 July 2017, Haye {{confirmed}} {{that had begun}} strengthening his ankle and he would slowly start training for his next fight which would likely take place in December 2017. On 24 July, negotiations had began for a rematch between Haye and Tony Bellew (28-2-1, 19 KOs) {{to take place in}} December 2017, although they were far from an agreement. Bellew made Haye of his preferred purse, which would reportedly make the rematch worth around £20 million. On 3 August, Hearn stated a rematch between Bellew and Haye was 'virtually dead', due to both fighters believing they are the A-side and have the right to demand ring walks, poster, changing rooms and split of purse. On 6 September, Hearn stated a deal could be made within seven days. According to Bellew's trainer, David Coldwell, both Haye and Bellew had held positive talks and looking more likely to agree to a fight, as long they stay on the same page and agree to the same terms. On 19 September, Haye agreed all the terms and tweeted Bellew to sign the contract. He said, [...] "It's taken months of negotiating but teams have finally agreed all terms for Haye-Bellew 2. Will Bellew put pen to paper?" [...] The fight was reported to take place on Sunday 17 December 2017. Promoter Eddie Hearn stated the fight was not a done deal, but he had hoped to confirm the fight within a week. Bellew replied the following day, tweeting, [...] "I OBLIGE YOU @mrdavidhaye , <b>happy?</b> <b>Now</b> leave me alone with my family please. I'll see you soon enough!" [...] The fight was officially confirmed on 29 September for the fight to take place at the O2 Arena in London. Bellew claimed the rematch wasn't personal anymore, just business and hoping to dedicate a win to his late brother-in-law, who had passed away in August. Haye stated that Bellew wouldn't win the lottery twice. Like the first fight, it was scheduled to be shown live on Sky Box Office.|$|E
