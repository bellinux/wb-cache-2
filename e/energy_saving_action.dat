40|$|A main {{objective}} of energy policies {{is to make}} {{all levels of the}} society, from governments to citizen, interested in increasing the energy efficiency of buildings. One of the most important barriers in implementation of energy policies is that the cost of potential energy savings, typically considered being the only financial benefit, does not sufficiently motivate investments. The target is therefore to identify further possible drivers pushing positive reaction according to <b>energy</b> <b>saving</b> <b>action.</b> The paper discusses whether a market-based instrument, capturing the increase of the economic value of energy efficient buildings, can be also used. Methods that quantify the added value due to energy performance, including recommendations on how they can be incorporated in the financial analysis of investments in weatherization, are developed. By applying the proposed methods, the payback period of investments in energy efficiency measures depends on two factors: potential energy savings and the added value to the property. Case studies on some existing condominiums from Romania are analyzed and provide evidence to the research question. The market sensitivity to energy efficiency measures, the possibility of an intangible added value as well as the impact to financial investment decisions is subsequently in the focus...|$|E
40|$|Between 1980 and 2000, China's energy {{efficiency}} policies {{resulted in a}} decoupling of the traditionally linked relationship between energy use and gross domestic product (GDP) growth, realizing a four-fold increase in GDP with only a doubling of energy use. However, during China s transition to a market-based economy in the 1990 s, many of the country's {{energy efficiency}} programs were dismantled and between 2001 and 2005 China's energy use increased significantly, growing {{at about the same}} rate as GDP. Continuation of this one-to-one ratio of energy consumption to GDP given China's stated goal of again quadrupling GDP between 2000 and 2020 will lead to significant demand for energy, most of which is coal-based. The resulting local, national, and global environmental impacts could be substantial. In 2005, realizing the significance of this situation, the Chinese government announced an ambitious goal of reducing energy consumption per unit of GDP by 20 percent between 2005 and 2010. One of the key initiatives for realizing this goal is the Top- 1000 Energy-Consuming Enterprises program. The comprehensive energy consumption of these 1000 enterprises accounted for 33 percent of national and 47 percent of industrial energy usage in 2004. Under the Top- 1000 program, 2010 energy consumption targets were announced for each enterprise. Activities to be undertaken include benchmarking, energy audits, development of <b>energy</b> <b>saving</b> <b>action</b> plans, information and training workshops, and annual reporting of energy consumption. This paper will describe the program in detail, including the types of enterprises included and the program activities, and will provide an analysis of the progress and lessons learned to date...|$|E
40|$|In {{the last}} decade, {{the service sector}} had a very rapid growth, due to the {{so-called}} “tertiarisation” of the economy. Accordingly, the energy consumption, mainly attributable to public and private buildings, is rapidly growing, thus making buildings energy saving {{one of the main}} issues of the energy policy at regional, national and international levels. To this aim, we developed an effective methodology to improve energy efficiency of the service sector buildings. This may represent a handy great opportunity to save natural and economic resources, especially where the buildings structure and the technical systems are old, the maintenance activities are not carefully carried out or a systematic energy management is not applied. Nevertheless, actions in this direction are often considered too expensive and complicated, if compared with residential energy optimization, because of the big extension, the variety of activities and the high number of occupants typical of the service sector buildings. The developed approach for energy audits aims to investigate the energy aspects of existing non-domestic buildings in a structured way, in order to clearly identify their energy saving potential and to improve their energy performances. The main goal of the study is defining a general methodology to analyze the current energy use and consumption considering a limited number of their peculiar elements such as dimensions, activities, users behavior, technical systems data and energy bills. Furthermore, these informations are completed by an appropriate energy measuring campaign. All the possible energy uses in service buildings are taken into account (i. e. lighting, ventilation, air conditioning, hot water production). The results obtained from the analysis allow to evaluate a global level of building energy efficiency, and to identify those single areas, specific systems or everyday activities where energy is wasted. These considerations also provide basis for programming cost-effective <b>energy</b> <b>saving</b> <b>action</b> plans. The effectiveness of the proposed methodology is demonstrated through a case study for an Administrative Center building in Rome, Italy. Results demonstrate the methodology reliability and the cost reduction potentialities...|$|E
40|$|Energy {{consumption}} {{assessment in}} a cement production plant is studied {{in this paper}} and a guideline for reducing energy consumption is provided according to a national standard-ISIRI 7873. Based on energy assessment, several <b>energy</b> <b>saving</b> <b>actions</b> were implemented and valuated. The proposed <b>energy</b> <b>saving</b> <b>actions</b> varied between simple actions to complicated and high-cost investments. By introducing <b>energy</b> <b>saving</b> <b>actions,</b> the electrical and thermal energy required for each additional unit of production decreased by 10. 4 % and 7. 6 % from 2008 to 2010, respectively. Hence, considering improvements introduced to the process control, this led to 22. 6 % and 19. 9 % improvements in the electrical and thermal specific energy consumptions, respectively. The Cumulative SUM of differences technique (CUSUM) was applied to assess <b>saving</b> <b>actions</b> {{in the period of}} implementation. The benefit of the CUSUM is that it gives a method to measure whether steady saving conditions are achieved or not. The continual improvement achieved since the slopes of trend lines in the CUSUM charts decreased for both electrical and thermal energy in 2010 in comparison with 2009. Also, the total cost savings in 2009 and 2010 were about 3. 4 million USD which covered all of the 2. 5 million USD costs of the implemented actions...|$|R
40|$|Changing people's {{behaviour}} {{in relation}} to energy consumption {{will be one of}} the most important challenges in the near future. We analyzed the determinants behind individuals' decisions to adopt curtailment behaviour or to purchase <b>energy</b> <b>saving</b> products. Using data from 213 university students, we explored the influence of personal capabilities and moral norms, along with trust in information on <b>energy</b> <b>saving</b> <b>actions</b> provided by different entities on two <b>energy</b> <b>saving</b> behaviours.

The paper reveals the pivotal role of private companies in developing the market demand for energy-saving products by providing credible and scientifically-based information on environmental performance.

40|$|Energy {{conservation}} and efficiency are often widely touted as non-controversial, cost-positive methods of reducing energy consumption {{and its associated}} environmental effects.   However, past programs to encourage residential energy efficiency and conservation have failed to make an impact.  A growing amount of research identifies energy feedback as a method to provide consumers with the information and motivation necessary to make appropriate energy-saving decisions.   JouleBug is a social, playful, mobile smartphone application designed to help users in the U. S. reduce energy consumption and live sustainably through behavioral changes.   This project initiated the design of an energy feedback system for JouleBug that provides estimates of a user’s <b>energy</b> <b>savings</b> for completing 38 residential <b>energy</b> <b>saving</b> <b>actions.</b>   Mathematical models were developed to estimate JouleBug users’ <b>energy</b> <b>savings</b> {{for each of the}} <b>energy</b> <b>saving</b> <b>actions,</b> based on 13 input parameters.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to shed light on the {{connection}} between income, dwelling type, tenure type and city living, in terms of both a household’s <b>energy</b> <b>saving</b> behaviours and direct residential energy consumption. This study employs data from the Household Energy Consumption Survey, Australia. Using a seemingly unrelated regression (SUR) system of equations the results reveal some key mechanisms which may allow householders to realise lower levels of energy consumption and hence lower carbon emissions. The results indicate that there are characteristics unique to living in a city that are linked to higher levels of direct residential energy consumption. On a number of measures (e. g. household income, tenure type and dwelling type), the results point to a lower likelihood of engaging in <b>energy</b> <b>saving</b> behaviours in cities. Also, depending on the number of <b>energy</b> <b>saving</b> behaviours, these <b>actions</b> have the potential to more than offset higher direct residential energy consumption of householders residing in separate houses. Coupled with these findings renters, a more vulnerable social group, are found to be significantly disadvantaged, suffering from a much lower adaptive capacity. Specifically, householders who rent their home are 77 % less likely to have solar electricity. A result which may reflect differences in access to opportunity. Further, householders who rent are less likely to engage in <b>energy</b> <b>saving</b> <b>actions.</b> A finding which may reflect difference in ontological security and the greater psychological burden associated with undertaking <b>energy</b> <b>saving</b> behaviours (a barrier) borne by renters not shared with home owners...|$|R

It also explores the intervention benefits for three key stakeholders: the organisation/hospitals, hospital employees and patients. A rich secondary dataset containing actual workplace behaviour measures (collected via observations) and self-reported data from employee interviews and patient questionnaires is used for this purpose. The intervention encouraged three employee <b>energy</b> <b>saving</b> <b>actions</b> (called TLC actions) : (1) Turn off machines, (2) Lights out when not needed, and (3) Close doors when possible; which led to <b>energy</b> <b>savings</b> and carbon reduction for the two hospitals. Hospital employees reported a greater level of work efficiency as a result of engaging in TLC actions, which increased the 'quiet time' periods in both hospitals. Indirectly, employees' TLC actions also improved patients' quality of sleep (which in turn is positively associated with greater patient hospital experience satisfaction). These findings shed light on the benefits of social marketing interventions targeting <b>energy</b> <b>saving</b> behaviour change for multiple stakeholders in healthcare organisations. They also illustrate connections between environmental sustainability and social and political pillars of corporate social responsibility. Additionally, organisational culture was highlighted as a key challenge in changing practices. To encourage long-term sustainable behaviour, this study recommends a pre-intervention assessment of infrastructure and equipment, the communication of expected benefits to motivate higher involvement of employees, the need for internal green champions and the dissemination of post-intervention feedback on various <b>energy</b> <b>saving</b> and patient indicators...|$|R

This thesis aims to firstly explore whether making heat visible, using thermal images, promotes heat (and thereby energy) conservation. Secondly using a multiple method approach, it explores how. Five studies were employed. Study One and Three investigated whether using thermal images as a tailored antecedent intervention would promote energy conservation behaviours. The results confirmed that the images led to a reduction in Kg CO 2 emissions attributed to domestic energy use. Study One and Three indicated that householders undertook more <b>energy</b> <b>saving</b> behaviours in relation to those aspects that were visible in the images. These actions were attributed to simple, <b>energy</b> <b>saving</b> behaviours such as proofing draughts. Study Two investigated how people make sense of the images and how behaviours are promoted by the images.

In order to measure all the simulations' missing input parameters, a suitable experimental analysis, including measurements of temperature, humidity, flow rate and density of construction materials, is performed. A thermographic investigation is also performed for investigating the building envelope performance. This analysis showed that significant savings can be achieved especially by adopting radiators thermostatic valves and AHU regulations. Coherently, the installation of a 3 -way valve in the substation does not determine significant additional savings when radiators thermostatic valves are already installed.

40|$|Complete {{overview}} of energy {{use in a}} residential building is depends on many different factors. When analyzing proper and effective ways for energy reducing/conserving systems, often times only technological solutions for households appliances are considered. Human behavior {{has been shown to}} be an important factor affecting the overall energy use in the household. Many aspects of energy use are directly connected to user behavior and are affected by how the user utilizes available systems. This paper focuses on describing the mean influencing causes of human environmental psychology based on study on a Swedish suburb community, called Fårdala. User behaviors and actions affecting residential energy use are analyzed and presented in form of eleven (11) abstract triggers to households energy use. Finally an energy monitoring system based on the findings are purposed. What is found from study on human psychology, shows that human behavior is mainly controlled by three (3) key categories of behavior. Conscious/voluntary behavior, Socio-environmental/cultural based behavior and Systemic/learned behavior. Out of the three, while the last one poses as most influential on behavior related energy use, it is also the hardest to affect and change. To effectively counteract the negative effects of user behavior on residential <b>energy</b> use, <b>energy</b> <b>saving</b> devices should react more accordingly to the users and offer engagement. Such a system is an energy monitoring device, which allows for a “double-sided” communication with the user. The user is presented with relevant information about real-time energy use of all of the systems and is able to make changes on the fly. The system should also be able to learn and apply <b>energy</b> <b>saving</b> <b>actions</b> based on user behavior...|$|R
40|$|Energy {{efficiency}} is today {{more important than}} ever, mainly due to the high energy prices and the approaching climate changes. Heating of buildings is an essential area within energy efficiency. Many buildings are old and were built {{at a time when}} the energy prices were low and the term “energy efficiency” was unheard of. By applying today’s broad range of <b>energy</b> <b>saving</b> <b>actions</b> on these old, and thereby often, heating ineffective buildings, this area has a large potential in reducing energy consumption and costs. Churches and chapels are generally old buildings with, in many cases, ineffective heating systems and therefore consume much more energy than needed. Significant part of the means of the parish goes to the heating of such a church/chapel, resources that could be used for other purposes instead. Another aspect is that if the heating is not performed properly, it could lead to major damages to the building and its fixtures. The churches of Laholm and Skummeslöv and the chapels of Skogaby and St. Gertrud are all buildings with heating systems that should be looked into. The buildings belong to Laholm Church Communion and they are a part of Gothenburg Diocese. These churches and the chapels are observed to consume a unnecessary large amount of energy at heating, primary because of that the majority of the heating systems are built up by different types of direct electricity, oil filled electric radiators and immersion heaters acting on a waterborne heating system...|$|R
40|$|Abstract GPS {{telemetry}} is {{a method}} with good accuracy to determine animal movements in the terrain. It is necessary to determine locations of free-ranging animals {{in order to understand}} movement patterns and habitat use, and to understand the consequences of human impacts like highways. This study aims to describe moose movement patterns and to evaluate the effect of highway traffic intensity on moose movements across a highway. Moose in Southwestern Sweden have different movement rates throughout the year. Increased movement rate for females was observed during spring and summer. The breeding season (15 September - 15 October) is the most important season for bulls. Our result shows that bulls significantly increase their movement rate during the rut, compared to other times during the fall. Movement rate increased twice compared with female movement rate during this period. No difference was observed during the rutting period for females (15 September- 15 October) compared with no rutting period during fall. During winter time, both sexes retain low movements, mainly caused by <b>energy</b> <b>saving</b> <b>actions.</b> A distinct crepuscular rhythm was exhibited during the summer and fall season, movements were more intense during dawn and dusk hours. No distinct crepuscular rhythm was noticed during winter and spring seasons. The traffic intensity at highway E 6 in Southwestern Sweden increases during the morning hours and reaches its maximum during midday. Moose in southwestern Sweden crossed highway E 6 more often at night time than day time. Thus highway crossings by moose occurred at times of peak moose movements, and traffic volume had lower importance...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the evaluation of}} the level of usability of an intelligent monitoring and control interface for energy efficient management of public buildings, called BuildVis, which forms part of a Building Energy Management System (BEMS.) The BEMS ‘intelligence’ is derived from an intelligent algorithm component which brings together ANN-GA rule generation, a fuzzy rule selection engine, and a semantic knowledge base. The knowledge base makes use of linked data and an integrated ontology to uplift heterogeneous data sources relevant to building energy consumption. The developed ontology is based upon the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC), which is a Building Information Modelling (BIM) standard and consists of two different types of rule model to control and manage the buildings adaptively. The populated rules are a mix of an intelligent rule generation approach using Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Genetic Algorithms (GA), and also data mining rules using Decision Tree techniques on historical data. The resulting rules are triggered by the intelligent controller, which processes available sensor measurements in the building. This generates ‘suggestions’ which are presented to the Facility Manager (FM) on the BuildVis web-based interface. BuildVis uses HTML 5 innovations to visualise a 3 D interactive model of the building that is accessible over a wide range of desktop and mobile platforms. The suggestions are presented on a zone by zone basis, alerting them to potential <b>energy</b> <b>saving</b> <b>actions.</b> As the usability of the system is seen as a key determinate to success, the paper evaluates the level of usability for both a set of technical users and also the FMs for five European buildings, providing analysis and lessons learned from the approach taken...|$|R
40|$|International audienceElectricity {{consumer}} {{behaviors are}} known to be both hard to change and unstable. From this point of view a state of the art of smart-grid experiment and an overview of Home Energy Management Systems show that after a first phase of enthusiasm and energy efficient efforts, the moves cool down. Equipped people tend to take back their habits or to let the system run on its own, giving no more consideration to <b>energy</b> <b>saving</b> <b>actions.</b> Several cases even show a rebound effect, where people consume more energy that before the system was launch. In order to keep people focused on their own energy efficiency behavior and help them to make the effects more long-lasting, the Grid-Teams project, held in 2012 in the city of Cannes, French Riviera, decided to focus on nudge marketing to assess whether these kind of services could enhance user's loyalty on efficiency habits. By nudge marketing, we mean several tools to help users to understand and act. The experimentation helps them focus and to fully handle their own electrical impact. For this purpose, we metered forty households and built a complete Web user interface with several nudge services including a range of energy consumption, with two bounds; a higher level: the consumption as usual (CAU), and a target to reach: the goal. In the same time a genuine loyalty program called EcoTroks TM was also developed. This paper explains how this electricity consumption range, from CAU to the goal, is computed and how the associated loyalty program seems to be an efficient manner to keep people involved in the program...|$|R
40|$|This report {{seeks to}} {{evaluate}} and predict possible power quality issues regarding Fortums engagement in the project of Stockholm Royal Seaport. Stockholm Royal Seaport is a city district planned by Stockholm Municipality to be constructed based on sustainable urban city principles. Fortum has, together with additional partners, engaged in the challenge to create a sustainable energy system. This {{is thought to be}} achieved through several measures. <b>Energy</b> <b>saving</b> <b>actions</b> are incorporated at several levels and there is a plan to create a “smart grid” for the electricity supply. A smart grid has no strict definition but in this case a key feature is “demand-response” which effectively means a way to optimize the consumption to have a more balanced consumption over the 24 hours of a day. One of the key components in the smart grid is the “active house” which is planned to have several specific features separating it from an ordinary house. It is planned to have its own contribution to electricity production using solar cells and an energy storage using batteries. Another feature is thought to be both automation and economic incentives measures to achieve peak load reduction. This thesis has taken the perspective of the end customer in the active house and has tried to evaluate the power quality to be experienced. An investigation regarding the different components has been carried out to get an overview from the mentioned perspective and identify possible problems or issues that may require attention in the realization of Stockholm Royal Seaport. It has been found that no major problems are to be expected but some smaller issues has arisen that might be worthwhile giving some attention...|$|R
40|$|Existing {{residential}} {{energy efficiency}} programs, using energy audits and rebates to address barriers to homeowner participation, have experienced anemic participation and savings rates. A {{new generation of}} local efficiency programs, encouraged by U. S. Department of Energy funding, are using the tenets of behavioral economics to address non-rational economic attitudes preventing homeowners from implementing <b>energy</b> <b>saving</b> <b>actions.</b> But rigorous evaluation techniques are required to assure that these programs are providing better performance. This project creates an evaluation prototype for a case study program: the Neighbor-to-Neighbor Energy Challenge (N 2 NEC) in Connecticut. This prototype is specifically based on {{a snapshot of the}} N 2 NEC program activities and program documentation after their initial program planning and immediately prior to program start-up. This original evaluation prototype uses a process framework to specify the activities to be evaluated, and uses an evaluation plan framework to specify the evaluation to take place. The process framework model and evaluation plan framework have been specifically customized for this research project, though they are based in the evaluation literature and community-based programs best practices. A specific priority is that the frameworks be feasible for implementation by a community-based program. The evaluation plan consists of research questions, associated research and analysis methods, and the data requirements needed to satisfy the question. As a second research component, the data requirements for the prototype are then compared to an inventory of actual data fields that N 2 NEC planned to collect, derived from a review of N 2 NEC planning documents. The comparative analysis shows that the prototype data requirements are covered fairly well by N 2 NEC's available data, though {{it would be useful to}} have more formalized data on collaborations with community organization, information that is likely informally held by program staff, and information on how the commitments by program participants are recognized publicly to reinforce their effect...|$|R
