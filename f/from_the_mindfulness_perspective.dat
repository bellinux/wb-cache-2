40|$|This paper draws <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>mindfulness</b> {{theory in}} {{examining}} the effects of service reliability (including reliable health information and care), pre-emptive conflict handling, and customer orientation on customer satisfaction and loyalty in healthcare service delivery in Malaysia. A survey of 423 consumers of healthcare services in Malaysia provides support for the theory. The findings of the study indicate that care reliability, information reliability, and pre-emptive conflict handling directly affect customer orientation; all four directly affect customer satisfaction, and indirectly affect customer loyalty via customer satisfaction. Thus, customer satisfaction fully mediates in the relationship of care reliability, information reliability, pre-emptive conflict handling, and customer orientation with customer loyalty. These findings lead to research and managerial implications that conclude the paper. Griffith Business School, Department of MarketingNo Full Tex...|$|R

Two large samples of undergraduate students completed mindfulness questionnaires {{and measures of}} other constructs. Psychometric properties of <b>the</b> <b>mindfulness</b> questionnaires were examined, including internal consistency and convergent and discriminant relationships with other variables. Factor analyses of the combined pool of items <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>mindfulness</b> questionnaires suggested that collectively they contain five clear, interpretable facets of mindfulness. Hierarchical confirmatory factor analyses suggested that at least four of the identified factors are components of an overall mindfulness construct and that {{the factor structure of}} mindfulness may vary with meditation experience. Mindfulness facets were shown to be differentially correlated in expected ways with several other constructs and to have incremental validity in the prediction of psychological symptoms. Findings suggest that conceptualizing mindfulness as a multifaceted construct is helpful in understanding its components and its relationships with other variables.

40|$|A thesis submitted…”) Background: Research {{has shown}} that mindfulness-based {{interventions}} (MBIs) can be effective in the treatment and management {{of a variety of}} psychological and physical health conditions. Whilst under researched, there is growing evidence to support the use of MBIs with individuals with intellectual disabilities (IDs) who may require adaptation to existing MBIs as a result of cognitive or other impairments. Method: This research dossier describes the development of an 8 -week mindfulness group for adults with IDs. Two mindfulness groups were delivered by community practitioners. Participants completed self-report measures of anxiety and depression pre-intervention, postintervention and at follow-up. Participants were interviewed for their experience of the group and assessed for their ability to understand and engage with the basic concepts of mindfulness. Results: Participants reported a decrease in anxiety post-intervention which continued to decrease at follow-up five weeks after the final session of <b>the</b> <b>mindfulness</b> group. Selfreported depression also decreased post-intervention, however there was a slight increase at follow-up although this remained lower than baseline. The decrease in self-reported depression from pre-intervention to post-intervention was statistically significant. Participants were able to engage with, understand, enjoy and benefit <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>mindfulness</b> group and appreciated having the opportunity to meet with similar people with similar experiences. Conclusion: Results indicate that <b>the</b> <b>mindfulness</b> group had some positive effect on selfreported anxiety and depression states. Participant feedback coupled with the researcher’s own reflections offer direction for further adaptations that could be made to <b>the</b> <b>mindfulness</b> group and support the need for further research in this area...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Mindfulness-based {{interventions}} {{have enjoyed}} a marked increase in support within biomedical and psychological {{research and practice}} {{in the past two}} decades. Despite the widespread application of these treatments for a range of psychological and medical conditions, there remains a lack of consensus regarding mechanisms through which these interventions effect change. One plausible yet underexplored mechanism is the therapeutic alliance between participants and mindfulness instructors. METHODS: In this report, data are presented on therapeutic alliance <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>mindfulness</b> arm (n = 37) of a randomized controlled trial of a mindfulness-based smoking cessation treatment. RESULTS: Results suggest that client-reported therapeutic alliance measured midtreatment did not significantly predict primary smoking outcomes. Alliance did predict improvement in posttreatment scores on several outcome variables linked to mindfulness practice, including emotion regulation (β = -. 24, p =. 042), mindfulness (β =. 33, p =. 007), negative affect (β = -. 33, p =. 040), as well as treatment compliance (β =. 39, p =. 011).

40|$|Objective: Mindfulness is {{a process}} whereby one is aware and {{receptive}} to present moment experiences. Although mindfulnessenhancing interventions reduce pathological {{mental and physical health}} symptoms across a wide variety of conditions and diseases, the mechanisms underlying these effects remain unknown. Converging evidence <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>mindfulness</b> and neuroscience literature suggests that labeling affect may be one mechanism for these effects. Methods: Participants (n � 27) indicated trait levels of mindfulness and then completed an affect labeling task while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging. The labeling task consisted of matching facial expressions to appropriate affect words (affect labeling) or to gender-appropriate names (gender labeling control task). Results: After controlling for multiple individual difference measures, dispositional mindfulness was associated with greater widespread prefrontal cortical activation, and reduced bilateral amygdala activity during affect labeling, compared with the gender labeling control task. Further, strong negative associations were found between areas of prefrontal cortex and right amygdala responses in participants high in mindfulness but not in participants low in <b>mindfulness.</b> Conclusions: <b>The</b> present findings with a dispositional measure of mindfulness suggest one potential neurocognitive mechanism for understanding how mindfulness meditation interventions reduce negative affect and improve health outcomes, showing that mindfulness is associated with enhanced prefrontal cortical regulation of affect through labeling of negative affective stimuli.

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine mindfulness-based {{marketing}} strategy implementation by small healthcare businesses and its outcome on relationship quality. Design/methodology/approach - The author evaluates the direct and indirect effects of mindful marketing practices of customer orientation, communication and competence on customer satisfaction and relationship quality in small healthcare organisations (SHOs) in Malaysia, by drawing <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>mindfulness</b> theory. Data were provided by 412 customers of SHOs and analysed using factor and hierarchical multiple regression analysis techniques. Findings - It was found that customer orientation, communication and competence are influential factors of customer satisfaction and relationship quality. Satisfaction partially mediates in the association of the mindfulness-based marketing strategies and relationship quality. Research limitations/implications - The study's sample was limited to SHOs in Malaysia. Although the objective of the study was met, both qualitative and quantitative testing of mindfulness-based approaches in large firms and in other industries in other countries are invited. Practical implications - The paper highlights some of the mindful marketing strategies which healthcare service providers and service industries in general can adopt in order to consummate high relationship quality. Originality/value - Mindfulness theory is hardly studied in the field of marketing and just a handful of research exists in quality research. This paper adds value by pushing back the frontier of knowledge in these areas.

40|$|Introduction: <b>Mindfulness</b> is <b>the</b> {{process of}} {{actively}} making new distinctions, {{rather than relying}} on habitual or automatic categorizations <b>from</b> <b>the</b> past. <b>Mindfulness</b> has been positively associated with physical well-being, better recovery rates from disease or infections, pain reduction and overall quality of life (QOL). Thus far, the aims of psychological studies on ALS have focused on understanding patient (pALS) – and, to a lesser extent, caregiver – QOL and psychological well-being. No previous study has investigated the influence of psychological factors on ALS. Methods: A sample of 197 pALS, together with their caregivers (n= 114), were recruited and assessed online twice, with a duration of four months between the two assessments. Assessments included measurements of trait mindfulness, physical impairment, QOL, anxiety and depression, as well as caregiver burden. <b>The</b> influence of <b>mindfulness</b> as predictor of changes in psychological and physical outcomes was evaluated with a mixed-effects model. Results: Mindfulness predicted higher QOL and psychological well-being, lower depression and anxiety, for both pALS and caregivers. It also predicted lower burden in caregivers. Interestingly, <b>mindfulness</b> positively influenced <b>the</b> change of physical symptoms: subjects with higher mindfulness experienced a slower progression of the disease after four months. Conclusions: These results showed that mindfulness is positively related to quality of life and well-being of both pALS and their caregivers.

40|$|Mindfulness {{is defined}} as the present-focused {{awareness}} of one’s moment-to-moment experiences. Studies have found links between greater mindfulness and more positive outcomes. Such links have been interpreted as indicating that greater emphasis on the present is beneficial. However, despite the conceptual link between <b>mindfulness</b> and <b>the</b> present, <b>mindfulness</b> has yet to be investigated in relation to temporal perspective. Temporal perspective encompasses cognitive involvement across the subjective past, present, and anticipated future, and comprises multiple components, including temporal focus, distance, overlap, and value. Similarly, mindfulness has not been examined in relation to well-being utilizing a temporally-expanded approach – for example, based on how individuals view their life satisfaction (LS) to be unfolding over time. The aim of this Master’s thesis was to evaluate <b>the</b> relations between: <b>mindfulness</b> and LS, including beliefs about how one’s LS is unfolding over time (Goal 1); <b>mindfulness</b> and temporal <b>perspective</b> (Goal 2); temporal perspective and LS (Goal 3); and temporal perspective as a mediator of <b>the</b> relations between <b>mindfulness</b> and LS (Goal 4). A community sample of younger adults (N = 305, 55 % female) completed an on-line questionnaire containing measures of trait <b>mindfulness,</b> temporal <b>perspective</b> (focus, distance, overlap, and value of the past, present, and future), and LS (recollected past, present, and anticipated future). Regarding Goal 1, mindfulness was associated with higher past, present, and anticipated future LS, but unrelated to how individuals view their LS as unfolding over time. Regarding Goal 2, mindfulness was linked with temporal perspective concerning the present (temporal focus, value), but also the past (temporal focus, distance, value), and the future (temporal focus, value). Regarding Goal 3, various aspects of temporal perspective were linked with LS, including current temporal focus, past-current temporal overlap, and current temporal value. Regarding Goal 4, temporal focus and value mediated the predictive effect of mindfulness on current LS. Together, these results suggest that mindfulness can be understood from a temporally-expanded perspective, encompassing not only how we view our present lives, but also how we view our past and anticipated future lives. Implications for existing conceptualizations of <b>mindfulness,</b> temporal <b>perspective,</b> and LS are discussed...|$|R
