2500|$|Stack and the Union City {{police were}} {{the subject of}} {{controversy}} in July 2005 when {{it was discovered that}} Stack had received two campaign contributions totalling $3,500 from Luisa Medrano, a tavern owner indicted on 31 counts for running an <b>illegal</b> <b>immigrant</b> <b>smuggling</b> ring out of her two Bergenline Avenue taverns, [...] El Puerto de la Union II in Union City, and El Paisano Bar and Nightclub in Union City. Both taverns are no longer in operation. Medrano was accused of smuggling young women from Honduras, forcing them to work in bars for little money to pay off their smuggling debts, often incurring physical, emotional and sexual abuse during the operation. Stack responded by asserting that he does not accept contributions from bars and establishments, and explained that [...] " [...] used her name and address in Fairview. [...] We make it practice of not accepting donations from bar owners or establishments, and we do not accept cash." [...] Stack pointed out that Medrano's establishments were not mentioned on the form with which she made the donations, and that he decided to donate the money to the Battered Women's Shelter of Hudson County once the donations were revealed, claiming that in addition to not being aware of the source of the money, he was unaware of the illicit activities going on in the bars. Stack also defended the Union City Police, who are assigned to watch the taverns for quality of life reasons, and who incurred criticism for their apparent ignorance of the goings-on in the taverns, on the same basis, arguing that they only patrolled the streets, but did not enter the taverns when they did so, and thus, could not see what occurred in them.|$|E

She also appeared in the television show Unnatural History. In 2011, she had a recurring role as Nurse Suzy Chao in the Global/ABC series Combat Hospital.

[...] Operation Seek and Keep was the first investigation authorized to use wiretapping technology in an <b>illegal</b> <b>immigrant</b> <b>smuggling</b> case, as approved by the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, {{and was the first}} to use money-laundering statutes to dismantle an alien smuggling operation and seize its assets. The investigation broke an international alien smuggling and money-laundering ring that brought in an estimated 10,000 illegal aliens to the United States at a cost of $20,000 per alien, generating more than $200 million in proceeds over a 3-year period. [...] The organization smuggled aliens who were nationals of India, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Syria. The operation most often started in India and went to Moscow, where connecting flights allowed aliens to travel to Latin American or the Caribbean. Aliens would then either fly or take a boat ride into the Miami, area or walk across the Mexican border. Once in the U.S. the immigrants were kept in stash houses where they were kept under lock and key.

50|$|Because of the clandestine {{nature of}} people {{smuggling}} operations, information currently available is scattered and incomplete.

40|$|Tatiana Hořavová: <b>Illegal</b> <b>immigrants</b> in the U.

The number of <b>illegal</b> <b>immigrants</b> currently present in the country is estimated to be around 11 million, and the inflow of new <b>illegal</b> <b>immigrants</b> seems unstoppable. Finding and applying the right solutions, however, seems to be highly problematic; this thesis will therefore try to analyze the reasons of such an impasse, and what could be expected in the discussion about this issue. The thesis, aside from a necessary introduction to today's immigration system and demographic characteristics of <b>illegal</b> <b>immigrants,</b> also contains an illumination of the reasons why illegal immigration is criticized. It focuses on four areas of criticism - legal, economic, cultural and security- related, and shows that arguments in the discussion about all these aspects exist for both sides of the debate - one that sees <b>illegal</b> <b>immigrants</b> primarily as criminals and a burden for America, and also the one that tries to defend <b>illegal</b> <b>immigrants,</b> and stresses their right to be treated humanely. The existence of two conflicting concepts pertaining to the approach to <b>illegal</b> <b>immigrants</b> in the USA is in this text further documented [...] ...|$|R
