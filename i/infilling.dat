ABSTRACT: <b>Infilled</b> steel frame structures are known to perform better as compared to <b>infilled</b> concrete frames under seismic loading. In comparison with masonry <b>infilled</b> reinforced concrete (RC) frame structures, very {{little research has been}} done on masonry <b>infilled</b> steel frames structures. Contribution of masonry <b>infill</b> in the positive performance of the <b>infilled</b> structures is widely recognized but no codes provide the clear and detailed guidelines on the design of <b>infilled</b> frame structures especially <b>infilled</b> steel frame structures due to the complex and unpredictable behaviour of masonry during an earthquake event. This study aims to provide a detailed insight into the composite behaviour of steel frame structures with unreinforced masonry <b>infill</b> under seismic loading. Time history analyses have been performed on masonry <b>infilled</b> steel moment resisting frame structures and structural performance has been evaluated in terms of global structural performance parameters of fundamental time period, maximum roof displacement and base shear and local parameters of interstorey drift ratios, structural member forces and <b>infill</b> stresses. The effect of masonry <b>infill</b> on the performance of <b>infilled</b> steel moment resisting frames has been investigated by varying the number of bays, number of storeys, percentage opening in the <b>infill</b> wall, location of the opening, type of openings, number of openings, <b>infill</b> strength, outer frame strength and <b>infill</b> thickness.

40|$|Reinforced {{concrete}} frame {{buildings have}} become {{common form of}} construction with masonry <b>infills</b> in urban and semi urban areas in the world. The term <b>infilled</b> frame denotes a composite structure formed by {{the combination of a}} moment resisting plane frame and <b>infill</b> walls. The <b>infill</b> masonry may be of brick, concrete blocks, or stones. In the current practice of structural design in India <b>infill</b> walls are considered as non-structural elements and their strength and stiffness contribution are neglected. The effect of <b>infill</b> panels on the response of reinforced concrete frames subjected to seismic action is widely recognized and has been subject of numerous experimental and analytical investigations over last five decades. The framed building behaves differently as compared to a bare framed building (without any <b>infill)</b> or a fully <b>infilled</b> framed building under lateral load. A bare frame is much less stiffer than a fully <b>infilled</b> frame; it resists the applied lateral load through frame action and shows well-distributed plastic hinges at failure.

40|$|Smart growth policies, {{in order}} to curtail low-density sprawl, seek to {{increase}} development in existing communities. These policies promote <b>infill</b> development, projects built on underutilized parcels in and surrounded by developed areas. While smart growth advocates view reduced sprawl as a benefit, local residents often fear <b>infill</b> will increase traffic congestion, eliminate open space, and result in other costs. Unfortunately, we know little about <b>infill</b> development overall and its impacts specifically. This dissertation addresses this gap by exploring residential <b>infill</b> development in Montgomery County, MD during the l 990 s and early 2000 s. This highly developed suburban jurisdiction experienced growing pains due to increased development during this time. The county also saw smart growth policies enacted, making it an excellent case study. The research first describes county residential <b>infill</b> trends from 1990 to 2006 and identifies <b>infill</b> sites. This section defines and offers a measure for <b>infill</b> development and identifies trends and patterns, focusing on changes in <b>infill</b> levels or characteristics. Next, the research uses hedonic pricing models to explore changes in nearby home values pre- and post-infill. A difference-in-difference design provides a comparison group analysis. Twenty-six <b>infill</b> sites were selected because they were built in relatively undisturbed residential neighborhoods, making such analysis possible. This research found <b>infill</b> to be a common occurrence throughout the study period, regularly comprising 70 % of all residential units built. The study did not find changes in <b>infill</b> development coinciding with a particular smart growth policy. Instead, <b>infill</b> mimicked overall development trends. <b>Infill</b> did have considerably smaller lot and structure sizes than non-infill. The hedonic pricing models found negative impacts on home values associated with some <b>infill</b> projects, with price declines ranging from 2 to 5 %. The impact varied by development type, with large projects causing the greatest price declines. Additionally, wealthier neighborhoods experienced a negative <b>infill</b> home price effect, while poorer areas experienced a positive effect [...] although not significant. Overall, positive outcomes were not the rule, and <b>infill</b> appears to generate costs. Planners and policymakers need to take this in to consideration when promoting <b>infill...</b>|$|R

40|$|<b>Infill</b> walls {{contribute}} to lateral stiffness and resistance of buildings they stuff. These variations of rigidity and strength {{are dependent on}} the mechanical properties of the material used for the <b>infill</b> and also on the interaction existing between this last and the frame. In this work, masonry like <b>infill</b> walls were modeled by using the equivalent diagonal strut concept in order to asses their involvement in seismic resistance of regular reinforced concrete building. Pushover analysis was performed by means of ZeusNL software package. Various scenarios of <b>infilled</b> frames that include weak story arrangements at different storey levels were considered. Comparison between complete <b>infilled</b> building, partially <b>infilled</b> with a weak story and bared buildings was performed. The obtained results have shown that <b>infill</b> walls have considerable effect on the lateral stiffness and resistance of reinforced concrete buildings when subjected to the static equivalent seismic loads. It was found also that <b>infill</b> enhances seismic performance. This enhancement is however largely affected by the distribution of <b>infill</b> through the building stories. The soft storey mechanism {{was found to be}} more severe when the bared storey is located in the inferior part of the building. For non <b>infilled</b> higher stories an unusual equilibrium state can be reached showing very high lateral resistance.

To characterize the performance of masonry <b>infills,</b> commonly classified as non-structural elements, an extensive set of experimental test data is collected and examined in this work in order to develop fragility functions for the in-plane performance of masonry <b>infills.</b> The collected data stems from testing conducted in Europe, the Middle East and the United States and includes solid and hollow clay brick or concrete block <b>infills,</b> constructed to be in contact within either reinforced concrete or steel framing. The results indicate that <b>infill</b> masonry can exhibit first signs of damage at drifts as low as 0. 2 % but may not suffer complete failure until drifts as high as 2. 0 %.
