5|$|Freda <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> Vampiri did {{not succeed}} financially in Italy due to the country's {{audience}} reluctance to an Italian interpretation of the horror genre. For Freda's next film, Caltiki – The Immortal Monster, he used an English pseudonym of Robert Hampton {{to give the impression}} that the film was not Italian. Freda attempted a gothic horror film again five years later with his film The Horrible Dr. Hichcock. Other crew members would go on to direct horror films following I Vampiri, such as screenwriter Piero Regnoli who directed The Playgirls and the Vampire (1960) and Bava who became the cinematographer on Freda's Caltiki as well as directing Black Sunday (1960).|$|E
5|$|Through a {{fortunate}} {{combination of}} circumstances I escaped from prison before my trial {{came on and}} lived for eighteen days in the forist(sic) and fields near Little Rock without a morsil(sic) of food except such raw corn and berries as I could gather in my lone wanderings. While a prisoner I <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was ungenerously treated by the harsh criticisms {{of the press and}} individuals not only in regard to my want of loyalty to the southern caus(sic) but also with regard to my supposed want of courage. I therefore resolved if God would grant me deliverance I would at once enter the Federal Army.|$|E
5|$|Pokiri success {{elevated}} Mahesh to super-stardom {{and brought}} recognition to Jagannadh {{as a writer}} and director. The sequences featuring Brahmanandam as a software engineer, the comedy track of Ali and Brahmanandam, Mahesh asking D'Cruz to give him upma at the railway station were acclaimed. The fashion trend of wearing doctor sleeves increased in Andhra Pradesh after Mahesh sported them and they continue to influence fashion even today. After the film's release, many films were released subsequently that had titles bordering on cuss words including Jagannadh's next film Desamuduru (2006). Mahesh revealed that he became confused after the film's success:It was such a huge hit, that if someone came to me with a script, I would approach the result of the film before approaching the character. I only wanted to act in movies that were like Pokiri, I think that was a mistake. It all got to me and I <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> needed a break from films itself. Initially, I wanted just a seven-month break. I signed Khaleja after nine months, but it just kept getting delayed and the break ended up becoming a two-year-long holiday. But I didn't freak out... I relaxed {{for the first time in}} life.|$|E

6000|$|His wife {{remained}} serious. [...] "It was a {{very fine}} point,--a very little thing to reject a man for. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> when <b>I</b> first read her letter about it." ...|$|R
500|$|Chekhov {{witnessed}} much on Sakhalin {{that shocked}} and angered him, including floggings, embezzlement of supplies, and forced prostitution of women. He wrote, [...] "There were times I <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> saw before me the extreme limits of man's degradation." [...] He was particularly {{moved by the}} plight of the children living in the penal colony with their parents. For example: ...|$|E
500|$|... "When Kane {{came out}} in script form, Orson told all of us about the picture {{and said that the}} most {{important}} aspect was the makeup," [...] Seiderman recalled. [...] "I <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was being given an assignment that was unique—so I worked accordingly. And {{there was a lot of}} work to do. Straight makeups were done in the makeup department by staff, but all the trick stuff and the principal characters were my personal work; nobody else ever touched them. They could not have handled it." ...|$|E
500|$|Considering what to write, Carrier {{thought of}} his own childhood. He stated in an {{interview}} that he began thinking of [...] "when was it that I felt I was really myself? And I remember it was when I put on my skates and my Eaton catalogues on my legs, and I stood up, and I was taller than my mom, and I had a stick in my hands, so I was stronger than my brother, and I <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was little me. So I started to write about that and it turned into the Hockey Sweater story." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "On the contrary," [...] said Clovis, [...] "the {{moustache}} is {{the only}} thing about you that seemed familiar to me. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> certain <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had met it somewhere before." ...|$|R
500|$|For all of Dunglass's humour and patience, the {{following}} two years were a grave trial. He was encased in plaster and kept {{flat on his back}} for most of that period. Although buoyed up by the sensitive support of his wife and family, as he later confessed, [...] "I often <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> would be better dead." [...] Towards the end of 1942 he was released from his plaster jacket and fitted with a spinal brace, and in early 1943 he was mobile {{for the first time since}} the operation. During his incapacity he read voraciously; among the works he studied were Das Kapital, and works by Engels and Lenin, biographies of nineteenth and twentieth century politicians, and novels by authors from Dostoyevsky to Koestler.|$|E
500|$|The puzzles, {{according}} to Broady, were of uneven quality. He called some [...] "hopelessly difficult" [...] and others extremely derivative. By contrast, he viewed the Albert Einstein and Isaac Newton dialogue puzzle as [...] "brilliant", but said, [...] "Ideas as original as Horse's call for puzzles to match, not rehashes of things we've seen {{far too many}} times already." [...] Ramsey thought the puzzles were challenging but not overly difficult, arguing [...] "on almost every occasion I <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was making progress, and I never felt bogged down and hopelessly lost." [...] He felt the puzzles were mostly well-integrated, and found those that were not did not detract from his enjoyment. Ivey remarked, [...] "For puzzle lovers, Drowned God is a treasure trove. ... This collection of tricky puzzlers are challenging and frequently innovative." ...|$|E
500|$|On February 19, 2010, Woods gave a {{televised}} statement {{in which he}} said he had been in a 45-day therapy program since the end of December. He again apologized for his actions. [...] "I thought I could get away with whatever I wanted to," [...] he said. [...] "I <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had worked hard my entire life and deserved to enjoy all the temptations around me. I felt I was entitled. Thanks to money and fame, I didn't have to go far to find them. I was wrong. I was foolish." [...] He {{said he did not know}} yet when he would be returning to golf. He announced a few weeks later on March 16 that he would be returning at the 2010 Masters Tournament on April 8.|$|E

60|$|Presently he turned, and perceiving <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{was sitting}} up {{advanced}} to me, and with the utmost courtesy said that he trusted <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> better. <b>I</b> answered <b>that</b> at present <b>I</b> scarcely knew how <b>I</b> <b>felt,</b> except <b>that</b> <b>I</b> ached all over.|$|R
6000|$|... "An impulse," [...] Wrayson answered. [...] "I <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> {{she could}} not have been {{concerned}} in such a deed, and <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> if <b>I</b> told all <b>that</b> <b>I</b> knew, she would have been suspected. So I said nothing. I saved her a good deal of trouble and anxiety I dare say, and I do not believe <b>that</b> <b>I</b> interfered in any way with the course of justice." ...|$|R
500|$|In 1964 Terry-Thomas started {{filming the}} role of Charles Furbank in How to Murder Your Wife, a part which brought him £100,000, his largest fee up to that point. He {{said that it was}} his {{favourite}} to make, [...] "because I <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> did a very good job". He enjoyed working with Jack Lemmon, the film's star, partly because Lemmon would play jazz and sing while the scenes were being lit: the two became friends and Terry-Thomas was invited to Lemmon's wedding. Throughout {{the rest of the year}} Terry-Thomas continued to appear on US television, again in Burke's Law, but also on What's My Line? and An Hour with Robert Goulet, both on CBS; he also released another record, Terry-Thomas Discovers America, a collection of songs and sketches, described by Billboard as [...] "a funny, funny comedy masterpiece". His earlier record Strictly T-T was also released in the US.|$|E
500|$|In May 1994, Jackson married Lisa Marie Presley, the {{daughter}} of Elvis and Priscilla Presley. They had met in 1975, when a seven-year-old Presley attended one of Jackson's family engagements at the MGM Grand Hotel and Casino, and reconnected through a mutual friend. According {{to a friend of}} Presley's, [...] "their adult friendship began in November 1992 in L.A." [...] They stayed in contact every day over the telephone. As the child molestation accusations became public, Jackson became dependent on Presley for emotional support; she was concerned about his faltering health and addiction to drugs. Presley said: [...] "I believed he didn't do anything wrong and that he was wrongly accused and yes I started falling for him. I wanted to save him. I <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> could do it." [...] She eventually persuaded him to settle the civil case out of court and go into rehabilitation to recover.|$|E
500|$|In Nashville, Swift {{worked with}} {{experienced}} Music Row songwriters such as Troy Verges, Brett Beavers, Brett James, Mac McAnally, and The Warren Brothers. She eventually formed a lasting {{working relationship with}} Liz Rose. They began meeting for two-hour writing sessions every Tuesday afternoon after school. Rose thought that the sessions were [...] "some of the easiest I've ever done. Basically, I was just her editor. She'd write {{about what happened in}} school that day. She had such a clear vision of what she was trying to say. And she'd come in with the most incredible hooks". Swift was signed by the Sony/ATV Tree publishing house, but left RCA Records when she was 14. She later recalled: [...] "I genuinely <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was running out of time. I wanted to capture these years of my life on an album while they still represented what I was going through".|$|E
6000|$|... 'At {{intervals}} I felt {{a return}} of strong violent emotion, but I soon became calm; I read {{most of the way}} up, and <b>felt</b> surprised <b>that</b> <b>I</b> could master my own feelings so much.|$|R
5000|$|... “Some {{people were}} angry <b>that</b> <b>I</b> hadn't used both Catholic and Protestant blood. They <b>felt</b> cheated <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had only chosen to use Catholic blood. It was never my {{intention}} to mix religions - the intensity {{is in the}} separation.|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't be silly!" [...] she exclaimed. [...] "I <b>felt</b> certain <b>that</b> <b>I</b> heard a shot just now, and I saw you reel {{and spin}} round for a moment. And your cheek, too--it's all over blood!" ...|$|R
500|$|Following her accession, John Owen Dominis {{was given}} the title Prince Consort and {{restored}} to the Governorship of Oʻahu, which had been abolished following the Bayonet Constitution of 1887. Dominis' death on August 27, seven months into her reign, greatly affected the new Queen. Liliʻuokalani later wrote: [...] "His death occurred {{at a time when}} his long experience in public life, his amiable qualities, and his universal popularity, would have made him an adviser to me for whom no substitute could possibly be found. I have often said that it pleased the Almighty Ruler of nations to take him away from me at precisely the time when I <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> most needed his counsel and companionship." [...] Cleghorn, her sister's widower, was appointed to succeed Dominis as Governor of Oʻahu. In 1892, Liliʻuokalani would also restore the positions of governor for the other three main islands for her friends and supporters.|$|E
500|$|The least {{expensive}} route for Kanae to Japan was through Russia. [...] He set off from Paris on 30 June 1916 via England, Norway, and Sweden. [...] In Moscow {{he met the}} Japanese consul and the social critic Noburu Katagami; the latter introduced him to proletarian art and encouraged him to visit Yasnaya Polyana, Leo Tolstoy's home which he had made into a farmers' school. [...] The experienced moved Kanae, who later was to write, [...] "While I was staying in Moscow {{in the summer of}} 1916, I <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had two important missions. [...] One was promotion of children's free painting and the other was establishment of farmers' art." [...] Kanae visited the Moscow Kustar' Museum, which had exhibited peasant arts and crafts since 1885. [...] He praised its sturdy quality and ethnic design, and lamented that industrialization had brought about a degradation in its perceived value and was threatening its survival. [...] An exhibition of children's art impressed Kanae with its free expressiveness.|$|E
500|$|Some modern authors {{suggest that}} Druitt was {{dismissed}} {{because he was}} a homosexual or pederast and that may have driven him to suicide. One speculation is that the money found on his body was going to be used for payment to a blackmailer. Others, however, think that {{there is no evidence of}} homosexuality and that his suicide was instead precipitated by an hereditary psychiatric illness. His mother suffered from depression and was institutionalised from July 1888. She died in an asylum in Chiswick in 1890. His maternal grandmother committed suicide while insane, his aunt attempted suicide., and his eldest sister committed suicide in old age. A note written by Druitt and addressed to his brother William, who was a solicitor in Bournemouth, was found in Druitt's room in Blackheath. It read, [...] "Since Friday I <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was going to be like mother, and the best thing for me was to die." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{success of}} the album brought wealth to all {{four members of the}} band; Richard Wright and Roger Waters bought large country houses, and Nick Mason became a {{collector}} of upmarket cars. Some of the profits were invested in the production of Monty Python and the Holy Grail. [...] Engineer Alan Parsons received a Grammy Award nomination for Best Engineered Recording, Non-Classical for The Dark Side of the Moon, and he went on to have a successful career as a recording artist with the Alan Parsons Project. [...] Although Waters and Gilmour have on occasion downplayed his contribution to the {{success of the}} album, Mason has praised his role. [...] In 2003, Parsons reflected: [...] "I think they all <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> managed to hang the rest of my career on Dark Side of the Moon, which has an element of truth to it. [...] But I still wake up occasionally, frustrated about the fact that they made untold millions and a lot of the people involved in the record didn't." ...|$|E
500|$|Jackson {{first met}} Lisa Marie Presley (and Elvis Presley) in 1974, during a Jackson 5 {{engagement}} at the MGM Grand. In November 1992, Jackson was reconnected with Presley through a mutual friend, staying in contact {{almost every day}} by telephone. As the child sexual abuse accusations became public, he became dependent on Presley for emotional support; she was concerned about his faltering health and his addiction to drugs. She explained, [...] "I believed he didn't do anything wrong {{and that he was}} wrongly accused and yes I started falling for him. I wanted to save him. I <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> could do it." [...] In one phone call he made to her, she described him as high, incoherent and delusional. He proposed to her over the phone towards the fall of 1993, saying, [...] "If I asked you to marry me, would you do it?". The marriage was, in her words, [...] "a married couple's life ... that was sexually active". They divorced fewer than two years later, remaining friendly.|$|E
500|$|On 20 November, Chamakh {{scored a}} goal in a 3–2 defeat by Tottenham Hotspur in the North London derby. A week later, he {{converted}} another goal, {{this time in}} a 4–2 win over Aston Villa. Following the goal against Villa, Chamakh went scoreless in the winter months, often appearing as a substitute in {{a majority of the}} matches. In matches he did start, he was often substituted on early in the second half. On 15 February 2011, he admitted that he felt burnt-out, stating, [...] "By the start of January I <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had completely lost my edge." [...] The striker also admitted he needed some rest and wouldn't return to full form until March. On 20 February, Chamakh played the entire match in Arsenal's 1–1 draw with Leyton Orient in the FA Cup. It {{was the first time in}} nearly two months he had played the full 90 minutes in a match. On 2 March, in the replay against Leyton Orient, Chamakh scored his first goal since November in a 5–0 win.|$|E
