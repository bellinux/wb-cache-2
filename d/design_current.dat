50|$|The exoskeletal engine (ESE) is {{a concept}} in {{turbomachinery}} <b>design.</b> <b>Current</b> gas turbine engines have central rotating shafts and fan-discs and are constructed mostly from heavy metals. They require lubricated bearings and need extensive cooling for hot components. They are also subject to severe imbalance (or vibrations) that could wipe out the whole rotor stage, are prone to high- and low-cycle fatigue, and subject to catastrophic failure due to disc bursts from high tensile loads, consequently requiring heavy containment devices. To address these limitations, the ESE concept turns the conventional configuration inside-out and utilizes a drum-type rotor design for the turbomachinery in which the rotor blades {{are attached to the}} inside of a rotating drum instead of radially outwards from a shaft and discs. Multiple drum rotors could be used in a multi-spool design.|$|E

5000|$|In certain cases, superconducting magnets {{designed}} for very high currents require extensive bedding in, {{to enable the}} magnets to function at their full planned currents and fields. This is known as [...] "training" [...] the magnet, and involves a type of material memory effect. One situation this is required is {{in the case of}} particle colliders such as CERN's Large Hadron Collider. The magnets of the LHC were planned to run at 8 TeV (2×4 TeV) on its first run and 14 TeV (2×7 TeV) on its second run, but were initially operated at a lower energy of 3.5 TeV and 6.5 TeV per beam respectively. Because of initial crystallographic defects in the material, they will initially lose their superconducting ability ("quench") at a lower level than their <b>design</b> <b>current.</b> CERN states that this is due to electromagnetic forces causing tiny movements in the magnets, which in turn cause superconductivity to be lost when operating at the high precisions needed for their planned current. By repeatedly running the magnets at a lower current and then slightly increasing the current until they quench under control, the magnet will gradually both gain the required ability to withstand the higher currents of its design specification without quenches occurring, and have any such issues [...] "shaken" [...] out of them, until they are eventually able to operate reliably at their full planned current without experiencing quenches.|$|E

5000|$|The {{original}} {{crest of}} JK Welco {{was developed in}} the middle of the first, 2008 season. In 2014, the club held a 1-month-long play-off style competition to find a new and fresh logo. Not surprisingly, the fans chose a logo which is very similar to the original Lauri Särak <b>design.</b> <b>Current</b> JK Welco goalie was again the author of the winning crest. The lightning bolt symbolizes the club's initial name Welco Elekter (elekter = electricity in Estonian).Welco started playing in sky-blue shirt with black sleeves and all-black bottom. Kit producer was Hummel. During the 2010 season, club decided to change its appearance drastically and introduced distinctive black-on-white hoops design for shirt. Shorts remained black, but socks were changed to white. New kit was produced by Uhlsport.In the wake of 2013 season, the club planned to develop an eye-catching new away jersey for both teams. The club used the help of its supporters to decide which kit was the most suitable to serve as a second jersey for the originally black-whites. The winning jersey was a combination of white base with red back (that symbolizes the flag of club's home town Tartu), and already [...] "legendary" [...] black stripes.In 2016, the club once again held a competition with already well-known recipe to replace the iconic black on white hoops design. Overall 14 designers submitted 16 ideas for a new kit. The competition lasted for a week, gathered a whopping 1400 votes and had a total reach of 100,000 people on club's Facebook page. The competition was anonymous, but the winning design was not surprisingly again Särak's.|$|E
