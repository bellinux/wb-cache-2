40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} a new method {{to design and}} to determine the inertial moment of the <b>fly</b> <b>wheel,</b> according to the allowed maximum and minimum angular velocity. The advantage of this method is: {{in the same time}} of the dynamic analysis of the the mechanics we can fulfill the design of the <b>fly</b> <b>wheel.</b> With this method, the inertial moment of <b>fly</b> <b>wheel</b> is determined precisely. In the traditional method, first we have to determine the inertial moment of <b>fly</b> <b>wheel,</b> then, make static-dynamic analysis of the mechanism and find out the react force of the connect pair. For example, after work, one first goes home and then has to go shopping. But if we choose not to go home directly, while on the way home in passing do some shopping then go home. Even though it is not the shortest way, but in total we can shave time and rod. It is the same occasion with our design method too. Even though the process of calculation is more complicated than the formal method, but we can determine the reaction on the connect pair at the same time. So that in total decreased the amount of design work. 1 Introductions Flywheel {{is an important part of}} shaper machine tool.

40|$|Increasing {{fuel prices}} and demands for {{reductions}} of emissions {{have led to}} a considerably increased interest in developing more efficient vehicles. Besides designing more efficient power units with lower fuel consumption and emission levels it is possible to increase the total efficiency of the vehicle by aerodynamic optimization. It is well known that aerodynamic drag becomes the dominant part of the total driving resistance of heavy trucks at velocities above 80 km/h. The drag from the underbody, including <b>wheels</b> and <b>wheel</b> <b>housing,</b> constitutes a significant proportion of the total aerodynamic drag of heavy vehicles. An accurate simulation of the underbody boundary conditions, including rotating wheels and moving ground, {{has turned out to be}} of great importance in the minimising of the aerodynamic drag. In this study the flow around the front wheels of a heavy truck has been investigated. A long-haulage truck geometry with a fully detailed underbody was used and the flow was simulated using Computational Fluid Dynamics. The vortex structures originating from the wheel rotation were identified and it was shown that the major part of the incoming flow to the front wheel housings entered from below the bumper skin and from inside the engine compartment. As the flow approached the wheel it was highly yawed, and this led to an asymmetric flow around the wheel where the largest outflow from the <b>wheel</b> <b>housing</b> was located behind the wheel. An investigation of different <b>wheel</b> <b>housing</b> design parameters were performed in order to reduce the drag of the vehicle, and it was found that changes in the <b>wheel</b> <b>housing</b> geometry had a significant impact on the local flow field and force distribution. The relation between aerodynamic drag and <b>wheel</b> <b>housing</b> volume corresponded to previous studies and showed that a smaller <b>wheel</b> <b>housing</b> volume will result in reduced drag. It was also shown that implementing <b>wheel</b> <b>housing</b> ventilation had a potential for reducing the drag and by careful design this can be improved even further...|$|R
40|$|Modern trucks have a {{reasonably}} optimised cab shape, and there exist several OEM and aftermarket devices for drag reduction for heavy trucks as well. To further reduce the aerodynamic drag major {{changes to the}} current layout of the vehicle are required, or the focus must be shifted from the cab and tractor trailer gap to {{other regions of the}} vehicle. The drag of the underbody, including wheel housings, wheels and engine compartment, represents a significant proportion of the aerodynamic drag and there has not been much investigation in this specific area on heavy trucks. To be able to reduce the fuel consumption and to fulfil the legislated emission standards for heavy trucks it is important to take all areas of the vehicle under consideration, and even though the individual improvements may be small, the total drag reduction will be substantial. In order to study the flow close to the vehicle underbody it is important to utilise the correct boundary conditions, that is, moving ground and rotating wheels. This work has focused on the flow in the front wheel housings. The flow field around the front wheels under the influence of ground simulation on a heavy truck of standard European configuration was investigated using numerical simulations. The in- and outflow to the <b>wheel</b> <b>housing</b> was located and the vortices originating from the front wheels were identified. This information was then used to identify which areas of the <b>wheel</b> <b>housing</b> having the greatest potential for aerodynamic improvements by changing the front <b>wheel</b> <b>housing</b> design. Furthermore, several <b>wheel</b> <b>housing</b> design parameters were defined, and their influence on the flow field and aerodynamic drag were investigated. Examples of these parameters are the shape of the <b>wheel</b> <b>housing</b> opening and implementation of <b>wheel</b> <b>housing</b> ventilation. It was found that there is potential for reducing the aerodynamic drag by applying these geometric changes to the <b>wheel</b> <b>housing,</b> and several of the configurations could be implemented on current production vehicles...|$|R

40|$|For {{trucks in}} {{long-haul}} operation the aerodynamic drag constitutes {{more than half}} of the total driving resistance, and by optimising the aerodynamics of the vehicle it is possible to reduce the fuel consumption significantly. The drag of the underbody, including wheels, wheel housings and engine compartment, accounts for a large part of that aerodynamic drag, and very little aerodynamic optimisation has been carried out in this specific area on heavy trucks. When studying this area of the vehicle it is of utmost importance to utilise the correct boundary conditions, that is, moving ground and rotating wheels. It has been shown for passenger cars that ground simulation has a significant influence on both the predicted drag coefficient as well as on the flow field. This thesis investigates the influence of ground simulation on heavy trucks, as well as thoroughly analysing the flow field around the front wheels. In this project both wind tunnel experiments and numerical simulations (CFD) were used for acquiring knowledge about the flow field. The focus being on the front wheel housings; and the aim was to understand the flow field around the front wheels and in the <b>wheel</b> <b>housing</b> area under the influence of moving ground and rotating wheels. This knowledge was then to be used to control the local flow field by changing the <b>wheel</b> <b>housing</b> geometry, in order to reduce the aerodynamic drag of the vehicle. Amongst the parameters that were investigated were the <b>wheel</b> <b>housing</b> volume and different <b>wheel</b> <b>housing</b> opening shapes, and it was seen that it was possible to reduce the aerodynamic drag by changing the <b>wheel</b> <b>housing</b> geometry. The influence of ground simulation was investigated, and it was seen that the local flow field was altered significantly with changed boundary conditions, and that the wheel rotation had the greatest impact on the <b>wheel</b> <b>housing</b> aerodynamics. The predicted drag coefficient tended to increase with moving ground and rotating wheels, which correlates with previously published studies on heavy trucks. A wind tunnel model for studying <b>wheel</b> <b>housing</b> aerodynamics was also developed in this thesis. The model was used both to study the local flow field, and also for investigating different modelling strategies of the wheel rotation in the numerical simulations. It was seen that the ground simulation altered the flow field around the wheel, and that there was good correlation between the experiments and simulations...|$|R

40|$|Wheel and {{underbody}} aerodynamics {{have become}} important topics {{in the search}} to reduce the aerodynamic drag of the heavy trucks. This study aims to investigate, experimentally as well as numerically, the local flow field around the wheels and in the <b>wheel</b> <b>housing</b> on a heavy truck; and how different approaches to modelling the wheel rotation in CFD influences the results. Emphasis is on effects due to ground simulation, and both moving ground and wheel rotation were requirements for this study. A 1 : 4 -scale model of part of a heavy truck geometry has been developed. During the model design numerical simulations were used to optimise the shape, in order to replicate the flow field near {{the wheel of a}} complete truck. This was done by changing the flow angles of the incoming and exiting flows, and by keeping the mass flow rates in to, and out of, the <b>wheel</b> <b>housing</b> at the same ratios as in a reference full size vehicle. To reduce blockage effects, the model was sectioned to reduce both height and width. In the experiments, pressure sensors and static pressure taps located in the <b>wheel</b> <b>housing</b> were utilised, and the simulations replicated the boundary conditions of the wind tunnel experiments, both in terms of the geometry of the model and wind tunnel as well as the modelling of the ground simulation. It was found that the wheel wake structures changed significantly when ground simulation was utilised. The main outflow through the <b>wheel</b> <b>housing</b> was influenced by the wheel rotation and took place further upstream, which resulted in large differences in the flow field downstream of the wheel. The influence of different strategies for modelling the wheel rotation in CFD was investigated and {{it was found that the}} Sliding Mesh approach was the most accurate method...|$|R
