5|$|Triturus {{included}} most European newt species {{until the}} end of the 20th century, but was substantially revised after it was shown to be polyphyletic. Three separate genera now accommodate former members of the genus: the small-bodied newts (Lissotriton), the banded newts (Ommatotriton), and the alpine newt (Ichthyosaura). The monophyly of the genus Triturus in the strict sense is supported by molecular data and synapomorphies such as a <b>genetic</b> <b>defect</b> causing 50% embryo mortality (see below, Egg deposition and development).|$|E
5|$|Cavaliers can {{be subject}} to a <b>genetic</b> <b>defect</b> of the femur and knee called luxating patella. This {{condition}} is most often observed when a puppy is 4 to 6 months old. In the most serious cases, surgery may be indicated. The grading system for the patella runs from 1 (a tight knee), to 4 (a knee so loose that its cap is easily displaced). If a cavalier has a grade 1–2, physical rehabilitation therapy and exercise may reduce the grading and potentially avoid surgery. The grades 3–4 are most severe where surgery will most likely be needed to correct the problem to avoid the development of arthritis and lameness in the limb.|$|E

5|$|Dissection {{occurs when}} blood accumulates {{in the wall}} of the blood vessel. This is most likely due to a tear in the tunica intima (the inner layer), {{allowing}} blood to enter the tunica media, although other lines of evidence have suggested that the blood may instead arise from the vasa vasorum, the small blood vessels that supply the outer layer of larger blood vessels. Various theories exist as to whether people who sustain carotid and vertebral artery dissection, even if not suffering from a connective tissue disorder, have an underlying vulnerability. Biopsy samples of skin and other arteries has indicated that this might be a possibility, but no <b>genetic</b> <b>defect</b> in collagen or elastin genes has been convincingly proven. Other studies have indicated inflammation of the blood vessels, as measured by highly sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP, a marker of inflammation) in the blood.|$|E

25|$|Abnormally {{low levels}} of {{cholesterol}} are termed hypocholesterolemia. Research into the causes of this state is relatively limited, but some studies suggest a link with depression, cancer, and cerebral hemorrhage. In general, the low cholesterol levels {{seem to be a}} consequence, rather than a cause, of an underlying illness. A <b>genetic</b> <b>defect</b> in cholesterol synthesis causes Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome, which is often associated with low plasma cholesterol levels. Hyperthyroidism, or any other endocrine disturbance which causes upregulation of the LDL receptor, may result in hypocholesterolemia.|$|E
25|$|Primary {{congenital}} alactasia, {{also called}} congenital lactase deficiency, {{is an extremely}} rare, autosomal recessive enzyme defect that prevents lactase expression from birth. People with congenital lactase deficiency cannot digest lactose from birth, so cannot digest breast milk. This <b>genetic</b> <b>defect</b> {{is characterized by a}} complete lack of lactase (alactasia). About 40 cases have been reported worldwide, mainly limited to Finland. Before the 20th century, babies born with congenital lactase deficiency often did not survive, but death rates decreased with soybean-derived infant formulas and manufactured lactose-free dairy products.|$|E
25|$|In 2000, The American Journal of Human Genetics {{reported}} {{two female}} siblings, aged 4 and 6 years, {{with mental retardation}} and severe creatine deficiency in the brain. Arginine:glycine amidinotransferase (AGAT) catalyzes {{the first step of}} creatine synthesis, resulting in the formation of guanidinoacetate, which is a substrate for creatine formation. In two female siblings with mental retardation who had brain creatine deficiency that was reversible by means of oral creatine supplementation and had low urinary guanidinoacetate concentrations, AGAT deficiency was identified as a new <b>genetic</b> <b>defect</b> in creatine metabolism.|$|E

25|$|Myasthenia gravis is an {{autoimmune}} disease which results from antibodies that block or destroy nicotinic acetylcholine receptors {{at the junction}} between the nerve and muscle. This prevents nerve impulses from triggering muscle contractions. Rarely, an inherited <b>genetic</b> <b>defect</b> in the neuromuscular junction results in a similar condition known as congenital myasthenia. Babies of mothers with myasthenia may have symptoms during their {{first few months of}} life, known as neonatal myasthenia. Diagnosis can be supported by blood tests for specific antibodies, the edrophonium test, or a nerve conduction study.|$|E
25|$|A {{congenital}} {{disorder of}} glycosylation (previously called carbohydrate-deficient glycoprotein syndrome) {{is one of}} several rare inborn errors of metabolism in which glycosylation of a variety of tissue proteins and/or lipids is deficient or defective. Congenital disorders of glycosylation are sometimes known as CDG syndromes. They often cause serious, sometimes fatal, malfunction of several different organ systems (especially the nervous system, muscles, and intestines) in affected infants. The most common subtype is CDG-Ia (also referred to as PMM2-CDG) where the <b>genetic</b> <b>defect</b> leads to the loss of phosphomannomutase 2, the enzyme responsible for the conversion of mannose-6-phosphate into mannose-1-phosphate.|$|E
25|$|Other {{experimental}} methods being researched involve substrate reduction therapy, which attempts to use alternative enzymes {{to increase the}} brain's catabolism of GM2 gangliosides {{to a point where}} residual degradative activity is sufficient to prevent substrate accumulation. One experiment has demonstrated that using the enzyme sialidase allows the <b>genetic</b> <b>defect</b> to be effectively bypassed, and as a consequence, GM2 gangliosides are metabolized so that their levels become almost inconsequential. If a safe pharmacological treatment can be developed– one that increases expression of lysosomal sialidase in neurons without other toxicity– then this new form of therapy could essentially cure the disease.|$|E
