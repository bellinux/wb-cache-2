Our participants were randomized into 2 groups, 1 which received nutritional advice alone and 1 that also received vouchers that were exchangeable for <b>fruits</b> <b>and</b> <b>vegetables</b> during a 12 -mo period. Socioeconomic characteristics, food insufficiency, affordability, and motivation for eating <b>fruits</b> <b>and</b> <b>vegetables</b> were assessed. A short FFQ was administered. Determinants of consumption of < 1 fruit or vegetable/d were analyzed using multivariate logistic regression. A total of 295 participants were included (mean age 44. 8 y; 133 men, 162 women). At baseline, mean daily consumption of <b>fruits</b> <b>and</b> <b>vegetables</b> was 2. 13 +/- 1. 57 times/d. Nearly 30 % of the sample did not eat <b>fruits</b> <b>and</b> <b>vegetables</b> every day. Determinants of low <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> <b>vegetable</b> consumption were: age younger than 55 y, education level lower than tertiary, and absence of financial means for buying <b>fruits</b> <b>and</b> <b>vegetables</b> daily. Other determinants were affordability (whether <b>fruits</b> <b>and</b> <b>vegetables</b> are affordable, lack of money in preventing healthy diet) and attitudes (whether one's own diet is healthy, whether or not <b>fruits</b> <b>and</b> <b>vegetables</b> improve health, whether eating <b>fruits</b> <b>and</b> <b>vegetables</b> is a pleasure).

The present study examined whether a predominantly African American neighborhood had disproportionately less availability of <b>fruits</b> <b>and</b> <b>vegetables</b> than a predominantly non-Hispanic White neighborhood.

Eating <b>fruits</b> <b>and</b> <b>vegetables</b> contributes important under-consumed nutrients to the diet, reduce the risk of many chronic diseases, and may help individuals achieve and maintain a healthy weight when consumed instead of higher calorie foods. However, very few Americans consume recommended amounts of <b>fruits</b> <b>and</b> <b>vegetables.</b> A state-level assessment of <b>fruit</b> <b>and</b> <b>vegetable</b> intake can be used to identify populations at risk, track trends in intake over time, and inform policy and program development.
