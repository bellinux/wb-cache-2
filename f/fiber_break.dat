40|$|A {{promising}} way {{to model}} fracture mechanics {{with the use}} of an original Discrete Element Method (DEM) is proposed. After proving the ability of the method to capture kinetic damage induced by cracking phenomena in brittle materials such as silica [1], taking advantage of the method for composite materials applications is the main purpose of this work. This paper highlights recent developments to prove capabilities of the DEM and to give some answers to challenges : i) use the present DEM to model damage mechanisms (matrix cracking, debonding, <b>fiber</b> <b>break</b> and delamination) in a composite material ii) deal with impact applications using the DEM. All developments are made in the home made software GRANOO (GRANular Objet Oriented) [2]. The capability of the DEM to model matrix cracking, debonding and <b>fiber</b> <b>break</b> is first demonstrated on a so-called representative elementary volume (REV) made of a fiber flooded in a matrix. Modelize the REV with DEM and retrieve suitable homogenized properties is the first challenge reached. Secondly, the ability of the method to capture matrix cracking, debonding and <b>fiber</b> <b>break</b> is qualitatively demonstrated through basic static simulations performed on the REV. The ongoing developments to improve are presented. Then, the Double Cantilever Beam (DCB) test using Discrete Element (DE) is investigated. Contact cohesive laws are identified from experiments and implemented in GRANOO. Simulations of DCB test using DEM are then performed. Results are discussed and ways of improvements are proposed. Finally, the ability of the DEM to simulate impact damage on textile is pointed out. Numerical investigations are based on Ha-Minh & co. Works in [3, 4] taken for reference. The weaving is exactly reproduced with DE. The contact between yarns is naturally taken into account in the DEM. The promising results are commented and the on going developments are exposed.

40|$|Fiber/matrix {{interface}} debond {{growth is}} one of the main mechanisms of damage evolution in unidirectional (UD) polymer composites. Because for polymer composites the fiber strain to failure is smaller than for the matrix multiple fiber breaks occur at random positions when high mechanical stress is applied to the composite. The energy released due to each <b>fiber</b> <b>break</b> is usually larger than necessary for the creation of a <b>fiber</b> <b>break</b> therefore a partial debonding of fiber/matrix interface is typically observed. Thus the stiffness reduction of UD composite is contributed both from the fiber breaks and from the interface debonds. The aim of this paper is to analyze the debond growth in carbon fiber/epoxy and glass fiber/epoxy UD composites using fracture mechanics principles by calculation of energy release rate GII. A 3 -D FEM model is developed for calculation of energy release rate for fiber/matrix interface debonds at different locations in the composite including the composite surface region where the stress state differs from the one in the bulk composite. In the model individual partially debonded fiber is surrounded by matrix region and embedded in a homogenized composite.

Results reveal a slow and discontinuous propagation of matrix cracks, even after the occurrence of matrix crack saturation. A few fiber failures were also observed.

40|$|The catastrophic final {{failure of}} CFRP {{composite}} materials {{has been observed}} to originate when clusters of 0 º fibers start failing. The study seeks to identify such mechanism as a reliable predictor of the impending failure. Currently available sensors {{were found to be}} inadequate for distinguishing acoustic emission (AE) signals corresponding to different failure modes. A modified sensor capable of accurately measuring frequencies to 2 MHz was developed, validated and instrumented on carbon/epoxy coupons. The improved fidelity to high frequency components provided the opportunity to distinguish <b>fiber</b> <b>break</b> related events which have relatively high frequency components and strong presence of symmetric Lamb waves, due to the small area involved and in-plane nature of the damage mode, respectively. A correlation technique was developed to extract groups of <b>fiber</b> <b>break</b> related AE signals that correlated with each other in order to identify clusters of fiber breaks. The signals within such groups are found to have frequencies in excess of 1 MHz. After the appearance of such groups, the subsequent rapid increase in the number and size of such groups was found to coincide with the final failure of the specimen. This observation is more consistent with the progression of unstable damage growth than traditional AE techniques due to significant variation in the predictors used in the latter for tests from even nominally identical specimens...|$|E

This research work is aim to study the progressive <b>fiber</b> <b>breaking</b> evolution in the longitudinally reinforced composites from a statistical perspective.

The Kolmogorov-Smirnov goodness-of-fit test is performed on the experimental data to characterize the damage pattern of the fiber in a single fiber composite. The results indicate that the fragmentation evolution of single fiber composites follows the Weibull statistic. Further investigation is focused on the damage initiation sequence in the multi-fiber composites. Four stochastic competing mechanisms are proposed to address the local load redistribution from the broken fibers to the intact fibers. These mechanisms are based on the dominating weakness selection, random walk selection, the self-avoiding walk (SAW) select and the all surrounding neighborhood fiber selection.

40|$|The {{strength}} of soft tissues is due mainly to collagen fibers. In most collagenous tissues, {{the arrangement of}} the fibers is random, but has preferred directions. The random arrangement makes it difficult to make deterministic predictions about the starting process of <b>fiber</b> <b>breaking</b> under tension. When subjected to tensile stress the fibers are progressively straighten out and then start to be stretched. At the beginning of <b>fiber</b> <b>breaking,</b> some of the fibers reach their maximum tensile strength and break down while some others remain unstressed (this latter fibers will assume then major stress until they eventually arrive to their failure point). In this study, a sample of human esophagi was subjected to a tensile <b>breaking</b> of some <b>fibers,</b> up to the complete failure of the specimen. An experimental setup using Acoustic Emission to detect the elastic energy released is used during the test to detect the location of the emissions and the number of micro-failures per time unit. The data were statistically analyzed in order to be compared to a stochastic model which relates the level of stress in the tissue and the probability of breaking given the number of previously broken fibers, i. e. the deterioration in the tissue). The probability of a <b>fiber</b> <b>breaking</b> as the stretch increases in the tissue can be represented by a non-homogeneous Markov process which is the basis of the stochastic model proposed.

40|$|Two recent developments, {{experimental}} Micro-Raman spectroscopy (MRS) {{and theoretical}} quadratic influence superposition (QIS) analysis, have greatly improved micromechanical measurement and realistic numerical modeling of fiber, matrix and interface stresses around fiber breaks in multifiber, polymer matrix composites. In this study, these, two techniques are combined {{to develop a}} methodology for determining the in situ interfacial strength parameters, such as the yield stress and frictional sliding resistance, which are major determinants of local deformation and damage propagation around fiber breaks. With a spatial resolution of 2 mu m, MRS is used to measure fiber axial strain profiles produced by naturally occurring fiber breaks in multifiber, high modulus graphite/epoxy model composites under uniaxial tension. For the same matrix material and surface-treated fibers, several fiber spacings and different interfacial conditions are tested including: sized fibers, unsized fibers and fibers with a PMMA coating applied using RF-Plasma grafting. The QIS micromechanical technique is then used to interpret the MRS data to quantify the complex, local in situ matrix and interface stresses and deformations, which can be accurately described by an elastic-plastic-debond (multiparameter) micromechanical model. These quantities are found to depend highly on interface condition and local fiber spacing, thus motivating questions about the usefulness of traditional single-fiber-composite tests in forecasting localized failure in large composites. Comparing the stress concentration profiles on intact neighboring fibers measured experimentally and predicted by QIS reveals the complex dependence on fiber spacing and the extent and type of interfacial damage.
