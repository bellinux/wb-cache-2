5|$|According to Maple's account, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>few</b> {{weeks of}} Pickingill's life, {{when he had}} become very ill, the local people moved him to the {{infirmary}} against his will, where he declared that at his funeral there would be one more demonstration of his magical powers. Many locals interpreted this as coming true when as the hearse carrying his coffin drew up to the churchyard, the horses stepped out of their harness shafts. His body was subsequently buried in the church's graveyard, whilst his abandoned house gradually became dilapidated before falling down.|$|E

5|$|After the {{conclusion}} of his work with Queen in June 1991, Mercury retired {{to his home in}} Kensington, west London. His former partner, Mary Austin, had been a particular comfort in his final years, and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>few</b> weeks of his life made regular visits to his home to look after him. Near {{the end of his life}} Mercury was starting to lose his sight, and he deteriorated to the point where he could not get out of bed. Due to his worsening condition, Mercury decided to hasten his death by refusing to take his medication and continued taking only painkillers.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>few</b> {{months of}} his life, Lowell {{struggled}} with gout, sciatica in his left leg, and chronic nausea; {{by the summer of}} 1891, doctors believed that Lowell had cancer in his kidneys, liver, and lungs. His last few months, he was administered opium for the pain and was rarely fully conscious. He died on August 12, 1891, at Elmwood. After services in the Appleton Chapel, he was buried in Mount Auburn Cemetery. After his death, Norton served as his literary executor and published several collections of Lowell's works and his letters.|$|E

On a personal level, Keynes's charm was such that he was generally well received wherever he went – even those who found themselves {{on the wrong side}} of his occasionally sharp tongue rarely bore a grudge. Keynes's speech at the closing of the Bretton Woods negotiations was received with a lasting standing ovation, rare in international relations, as the delegates acknowledged the scale of his achievements made despite poor health.|$|E

5|$|The game {{descended into}} a scrappy affair <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>few</b> minutes, with few clear cut chances for either side.

Van Nistelrooy missed his and Wiltord scored to level the tally at 2–2 in the shoot-out. Solskjær, Lauren and Forlán scored, but Pirès missed – his effort saved by Howard – which won United the Shield, 4–3 on penalties.|$|E

5|$|Apart from a {{definition}} of leisure, there are other questions of theoretical concern to the sociologist of leisure. For example, quantifying the results is difficult, as time-budget studies have noted that a given amount of time (for example, an hour) may have different values, depending on when it occurs—within a day, a week, or a year. Finally, as with many other fields of inquiry in the social sciences, {{the study of the}} sociology of leisure is hampered by the lack of reliable data for comparative longitudinal studies, as there was little to no standardized data-gathering on leisure throughout most of human history. The lack of longitudinal studies has been remedied <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>few</b> decades by recurring national surveys such as the General Household Survey in the United Kingdom (ongoing since 1971). In addition to surveys, an increasing number of studies have been focusing on qualitative methods of research (interviews).|$|E
5|$|During early pregnancy, type 1 lobules {{quickly become}} type 2 lobules because {{of changes in}} {{estrogen}} and progesterone levels. Maturing into type 3 and then reaching full differentiation as type 4 lobules requires an increase of human placental lactogen (hPL) which occurs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>few</b> months of pregnancy. According to the abortionbreast cancer hypothesis, if an abortion were to interrupt this sequence then it could leave a higher ratio of type 2 lobules than existed prior to the pregnancy. Russo and Russo have shown that mature breast cells have more time for DNA repair with longer cell cycles, accounting for the slightly reduced {{risk of breast cancer}} for parous women against the baseline risk for women who have never conceived and those who have conceived and terminated their pregnancies.|$|E
5|$|During their suspension, Mulder and Scully {{venture to}} Hollywood {{to view the}} {{production}} of Federman's film. It is revealed that Federman's movie will be called The Lazarus Bowl, and Garry Shandling will play Mulder and Téa Leoni will play Scully. After filming is done, Mulder and Scully attend a screening of the film with Skinner, but are thoroughly disgusted at how their case, and they, are portrayed on the big screen. Mulder and Scully leave the set holding hands, presumably {{on their way to}} dinner with the FBI credit card Skinner gave them after watching the movie, hinting at the continued romantic relationship between Mulder and Scully that has been suggested <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>few</b> episodes. As the agents leave, the dead who were resting underneath the film set are revived and begin to dance passionately, reinforcing a theory Mulder made earlier in the episode.|$|E

5|$|Hastati {{appear to}} have been {{remnants}} of the old third class of the army under the Etruscan kings when it was reformed by Marcus Furius Camillus. The third class stood <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>few</b> ranks of a very large phalanx and were equipped in a similar manner to hastati, although they were more often than not relegated to providing missile support to the higher classes rather than fighting themselves. Penrose and Southern postulate that it is probable that engagements with the Samnites and a crushing defeat {{at the hands of the}} Gallic warlord Brennus, who both used lots of smaller military units rather than a few very large ones, taught the Romans the importance of flexibility and the inadequacy of the phalanx on the rough, hilly ground of central Italy.|$|E
5|$|Heparin occurs {{naturally}} {{in the human}} body, but the development of HIT antibodies suggests heparin may act as a hapten, and thus be targeted by the immune system. In HIT, the immune system forms antibodies against heparin when it is bound to a protein called platelet factor 4 (PF4). These antibodies are usually of the IgG class and their development usually takes about five days. However, {{those who have been}} exposed to heparin <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>few</b> months may still have circulating IgG, as IgG-type antibodies generally continue to be produced even when their precipitant has been removed. This is similar to immunity against certain microorganisms, with the difference that the HIT antibody does not persist more than three months. HIT antibodies have been found in individuals with thrombocytopenia and thrombosis who had no prior exposure to heparin, but the majority are found in people who are receiving heparin.|$|E
