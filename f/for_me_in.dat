In this talk he suggested some details of action of a drastic character for my guidance, which he was positive were necessary to be adopted before success could be had. All this was delivered in his usual vigorous way, emphasizing many points by hammering on the desk with his fist.|$|E

25|$|The {{day before}} {{yesterday}} I was present at an operation performed by Dr. George McClellan, on a gentleman from Virginia. It consisted in {{the removal of the}} whole of the parotid gland in a scirrhous and much enlarged state, from {{the left side of the}} face. Nothing could exceed the combined coolness and skill manifested by Dr. M. throughout this terrible operation, which he has now performed for the eleventh time, and hitherto with remarkable success. On this occasion, however, he was doomed to disappointment, for the patient died last night, about thirty-six hours after the operation. McClellan sent <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> the evening, to see the dying man with him, and we met in the chamber of death between ten and eleven o'clock. I had sometimes heard McClellan spoken of as a heartless surgeon, devoid of feeling or sympathy for those who came under his knife; but I can solemnly aver that I have seldom witnessed more unaffected sorrow than he manifested on this occasion. He walked the room incessantly, and repeatedly clasped my hands in his, while he expressed, in emphatic language, the feelings that preyed upon his mind. He moreover assured me, that he seldom performed one of his severer operations without first asking the blessing of God on his undertaking; and that days and nights of painful anxiety, often preceded those great professional efforts which have justly placed his name on the pinnacle of surgical fame. The gurgling respiration of the unfortunate patient announced the near approach of death, and I withdrew, full of sympathy for the agonized emotions of my friend.|$|E

500|$|The {{film was}} shot over 15 days in Los Angeles and Malibu, California. Swanberg and cinematographer Ben Richardson decided to shoot on 35 mm film rather than digitally, {{as most of}} Swanberg's {{previous}} films had been made. They decided to shoot on film, Richardson said, because [...] "there is a certain visual integrity to a film-derived image that is still lacking <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> most of the digitally-derived imagery that we see". Although the film's dialogue was improvised, the actors rehearsed each scene before filming so that the scene could be blocked out due to the constraints of working with film rather than digital.|$|E

[...] "I realized that not only is there life left <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> swimming, there's also a desire to come back [...] and do it the right way", Tarwater remarked. Marsh introduced Tarwater to a new style of training which focused more on creating power rather than relying on aerobic endurance.

500|$|Blue Dragon {{was first}} {{revealed}} on February 24, 2005 {{as one of}} two unnamed role-playing games in development by Mistwalker Studios for the console which later {{came to be known}} as the Xbox 360.

[...] Contributors to Blue Dragon include a number of well known Japanese figures in the gaming industry.

500|$|Gerolmo {{described}} his original draft script as [...] "a big, passionate, violent detective story {{set against the}} greatest sea-change in American life in the 20th century, the civil rights movement".

[...] The abductor of Mayor Tilman was originally written as a Mafia hitman who forces a confession by putting a pistol in Tillman's mouth.
