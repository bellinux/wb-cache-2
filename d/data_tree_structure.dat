40|$|The Peano Count Tree (P-tree) is a quadrant-based {{lossless}} tree {{representation of}} the original spatial data. The idea of P-tree is to recursively divide the entire spatial data, such as Remotely Sensed Imagery data, into quadrants and record the count of 1 -bits for each quadrant, thus forming a quadrant count tree. Using P-tree structure, all the count information can be calculated quickly. This facilitates efficient ways for data mining. In this paper, we {{will focus on the}} algebra and properties of P-tree structure and its variations. We have implemented fast algorithms for P-tree generation and P-tree operations. Our performance analysis shows P-tree has small space and time costs compared to the original data. We have also implemented some data mining algorithms using P-trees, such as Association Rule Mining, Decision Tree Classification and K-Clustering.

There are literally as many access control schemes as there are <b>tree</b> <b>data</b> <b>structures.</b> Consequently, an access control model which has been defined for {{a particular kind of}} tree cannot be easily adapted to another kind of tree. In this paper, we propose an access control model for generic <b>tree</b> <b>data</b> <b>structures.</b> This model can then be applied to any specific typed <b>tree</b> <b>data</b> <b>structure...</b>|$|R

Among the proposed <b>data</b> <b>structures,</b> the quad <b>tree</b> <b>data</b> <b>structure</b> provides {{a good way to}} organize objects on a 2 -D plane. Region searches proceed at logarithmic speeds a desirable characteristic, but no previously proposed VLSI quad <b>tree</b> <b>data</b> <b>structure</b> distributed objects to subdivide the spatial area.

In this paper, we present a new division method to reconstruct those quad trees including the multiple storage quad tree (MSQT) and the quad list quad tree (QLQT) into nearly balanced quad <b>tree</b> <b>data</b> <b>structures.</b> Nearly balanced quad trees based on our new spatial division method are constructed by dynamically translating unbalanced multiple storage quad trees or unbalanced quad list quad <b>trees</b> into balanced <b>structures.</b> All benefits of the original quad <b>tree</b> <b>data</b> <b>structures</b> are completely retained. In addition, this method is simple and balanced quad trees memory require less than the original quad trees.

40|$|Recent {{years have}} {{witnessed}} an unprecedented proliferation of social media, e. g., millions of blog posts, micro-blog posts, and social networks on the Internet. This {{kind of social}} media data can be modeled in a large graph where nodes represent the entities and edges represent relationships between entities of the social media. Discovering keyword-based correlated networks of these large graphs is an important primitive in data analysis, from which users can pay more attention about their concerned information in the large graph. In this paper, we propose and define the problem of keyword-based correlated network computation over a massive graph. To do this, we first present a novel <b>tree</b> <b>data</b> <b>structure</b> that only maintains the shortest path of any two graph nodes, by which the massive graph can be equivalently transformed into a <b>tree</b> <b>data</b> <b>structure</b> for addressing our proposed problem.

We {{present a}} new decidable logic called TREX for expressing {{constraints}} about imperative <b>tree</b> <b>data</b> <b>structures.</b> In particular, TREX supports a transitive closure operator that can express reachability constraints, which often appear in data structure invariants. We show that our logic is closed under weakest precondition computation, which enables its use for automated software verification. We further show that satisfiability of formulas in TREX is decidable in NP. The low complexity {{makes it an}} attractive alternative to more expensive logics such as monadic second-order logic (MSOL) over trees, which have been traditionally used for reasoning about <b>tree</b> <b>data</b> <b>structures.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- Mining {{frequent}} patterns over data streams is {{an interesting}} problem due to its wide application area. In this study, a novel method for sliding window frequent patterns mining over data streams is proposed. This method utilizes a compressed and memory efficient <b>tree</b> <b>data</b> <b>structure</b> to store and to maintain sliding window transactions. The method dynamically reconstructs and compresses <b>tree</b> <b>data</b> <b>structure</b> to control the amount of memory usage. Moreover, the mining task is efficiently performed using the data structure when a user issues a mining request. The mining process reuses the <b>tree</b> <b>structure</b> to extract frequent patterns and does not need additional memory requirement. Experimental evaluations on real datasets show that our proposed method outperforms recently proposed sliding window based algorithms...|$|R
