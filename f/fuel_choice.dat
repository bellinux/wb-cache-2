The main reason gas is so {{expensive}} is that OPEC deliberately lowers its production to raise the price of oil, {{and we have no}} real <b>fuel</b> <b>choice</b> at the pump. It is all made of oil. So when OPEC reduces its production and makes oil more expensive, we have no other choice — we must pay it. OPEC knows this, and takes advantage of its leverage. <b>Fuel</b> <b>choice</b> at the pump will be the end of a long-running monopoly.|$|E

This reaction can be done at lower heats and pressures. But it has several drawbacks. First, tritium is far more expensive than deuterium. This is because tritium is rare. It has a short half-life {{making it hard to}} produce and store. It is also considered a hazardous material, so using it is a hassle from a health, safety and environmental perspective. Finally, tritium and deuterium produces fast neutrons which means any reactor burning it would require heavy shielding.|$|E

50|$|According to the Foundation, {{outdated}} regulations prevent drivers {{from making}} simple modifications to their engines {{that would enable}} their cars to run on alternatives fuels, hence threatening oil's monopoly over the transportation fuel market. Updating these regulations to allow for current vehicles to modify their engines would allow for a near-term, widespread expansion of <b>fuel</b> <b>choice</b> for drivers. Ethanol, methanol, natural gas and electric cars are seen as viable replacement fuels to compete against oil in an open market. No one fuel is explicitly favored over the others but most people believe methanol made from natural gas holds the most promise to break oil's monopoly.|$|E
5000|$|TPVs {{have been}} {{proposed}} for use in recreational vehicles.

In particular the versatility of TPVs for <b>fuel</b> <b>choice</b> {{and the ability to}} use multiple fuel sources makes them interesting as a wider variety of fuels are being with better sustainability are emerging. The silent operation of TPVs allow the generation of electricity when and where the use of noisy conventional generators is not allowed (i.e. during [...] "quiet hours" [...] in national park campgrounds), and do not disturb others. However, the emitter temperatures required for practical efficiencies make TPVs on this scale unlikely.|$|E
50|$|The Quest {{is divided}} into six sections: The New World of Oil, the first section focuses on {{developments}} worldwide {{in the oil industry}} following the first Gulf War and the breakup of the Soviet Union. It is noteworthy that The Quest has two chapters devoted to China, the only country to get such treatment in the book, whereas The Prize talked very little about China. The second section, Securing the Supply, covers the ways in which concerns over energy security and scarcity have shaped the world’s economy, policies, and planning. This section tells the story of how shale gas was developed. The Electric Age, the third section, follows electricity’s rise, as well as the risks of nuclear proliferation, hurdles faced in ensuring that “the lights stay on” and the current challenges for <b>fuel</b> <b>choice.</b>|$|E

40|$|Climate {{stabilization}} requires {{greenhouse gas}} reductions (GHG) {{in excess of}} 60 percent. Ground source heat pumps (GSHPs) hold the promise of meeting heating and cooling loads much more efficiently than conventional technologies. The economic viability of their widespread adoption depends on the costs of energy. Their impact on GHG reduction depends on <b>fuel</b> <b>choices</b> both in electricity generation and on customers’ premises. In this paper, we provide a systematic assessment of the GHG reduction potential across Canada of GSHPs and the economic cost of achieving this reduction. Using province-level data on household <b>fuel</b> <b>choices</b> and energy use, we find that GSHP systems offer significant GHG reductions, as well as savings in operation and maintenance costs. However, high capital costs continue to limit market diffusion. We conclude with {{a review of the}} geological suitability of the five largest urban centers in Canada for GSHP installation. This analysis shows GSHPs to hold significant potential for substantial GHG reductions in Canada at a cost savings relative to conventional alternatives, with time horizons as short as seven years. conservation, GHG mitigation, residential energy...|$|R
50|$|Military {{service in}} the First World War {{introduced}} many British men to motoring for the first time: returning survivors began, where funds permitted, to purchase small motor cars or motor bikes, while others set up in business to maintain and repair the motor cars of the wealthy. Before the war motor fuel suppliers in the UK had typically included pharmacies, cycle shops or even blacksmiths, but after the war commercial roadside garages began to appear, slowly at first. Because garages were initially sparse the Automobile Association itself set up twelve strategically located filling stations, supplying fuel only to its own members and making no profit from the transactions. Initially the AA fuel stations supplied only National Benzole which was seen a particularly patriotic <b>fuel</b> <b>choice</b> because the coal shale which was the principal ingredient of benzole was domestically produced. In 1927 the AA dismantled its small chain of service stations as {{the growth of a}} commercially motivated service station network rendered them unnecessary, but by this time National Benzole was a nationally established fuel brand in the UK.|$|E
5000|$|The first {{generation}} Honda Civic was introduced on 11 July 1972, but {{sold as a}} 1973 model in Japan. It was equipped with a [...] four-cylinder water-cooled engine and featured front power disc brakes, reclining vinyl bucket seats, simulated wood trim on the dashboard, as well as optional air conditioning and an AM/FM radio. The Civic was available as a coupe, both a three- and a five-door hatchback, {{as well as a}} five-door station wagon. Due to the 1973 oil crisis, consumer demand for fuel efficient vehicles was high, and due to the engine being able to run on either leaded or unleaded fuel, it gave drivers <b>fuel</b> <b>choice</b> flexibility over other vehicles. The CVCC engine debuted in 1975 and had a head design that allowed for more efficient combustion, and as a benefit the CVCC system did not require a catalytic converter or unleaded fuel to meet 1975 Environmental Protection Agency emissions standards for hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide. The Civic was joined by a platform expansion of the three-door hatchback, called the Honda Accord in 1976.|$|E
5000|$|Challenge X is a {{continuation}} of the long history of student vehicle competitions sponsored by the DOE since 1987 (Challenge X a). The majority of the competitions involve high level sponsors from both the government and the automotive industry. Challenge X is the latest in these series of competitions. The goal of the competition is to guide students through the engineering design process used at many automotive manufacturers, while developing and exploring various advanced technologies which can be used to reduce energy consumption and vehicle emissions. The vice president for GM's Powertrain Division, Tom Stephens described the competition by saying:This {{is the first time that}} a student competition has emphasized the importance of <b>fuel</b> <b>choice</b> in achieving sustainability mobility. Challenge X provides the student teams an opportunity to take an open-minded well-to-wheels approach to all the issues involved in energy efficiency and emissions - including the fuel source, the propulsion system and the vehicle's real world utility and consumer appeal (Foster).When applied properly these technologies lead to more sustainable vehicle solutions. As automotive consumers have increasingly purchased large family sized sport utility vehicles over the past decade, the competition vehicle for Challenge X is the Chevrolet Equinox, a GM a mid-size crossover SUV [...] Student teams are required to maintain the stock vehicle's performance, safety, utility, and consumer acceptability all while attempting to increase its fuel economy and decrease its emissions.|$|E

40|$|The public {{transport}} sector in Sweden {{has set a}} target to run 90 % of its total vehicle-kilometers on renewable fuels by 2020, and double its market share in the long term. The focus {{of this paper is}} the adoption of renewable fuels in public bus fleets. Data for all 21 Swedish counties were gathered and analyzed, mapping the bus fleets’ condition in relation to renewable fuel deployment, CO 2 emissions and energy efficiency. The main factors affecting <b>fuel</b> <b>choices</b> in the bus fleets were investigated through a survey among environmental managers and transport planners at regional {{public transport}} authorities. The analysis highlights the challenges implied in the rapid shift that regional bus fleets are undergoing to adopt renewable fuels and reduce emissions. Political will and procurement have been strong success factors in facing these challenges. The survey indicates the stakeholders’ interest to switch to electricity for city routes, while biodiesel and HVO are preferred for longer routes. When it comes to how <b>fuel</b> <b>choices</b> are made, environmental factors seem to be prioritized, while the barriers identified are mainly economic and political.

In 2016, only 16. 9 % of rural and 65. 3 % of urban inhabitants in mainland Tanzania were connected {{to some form of}} electricity. We use a nationally representative three-wave panel dataset (2008 - 2013) to contribute to the literature on household energy use decisions in Tanzania {{in the context of the}} stacking and energy ladder hypotheses. We firstly adopt a panel multinomial-logit approach to model the determinants of household cooking- and lighting-fuel choices. Secondly, we focus explicitly on energy stacking behaviour, proposing various ways of measuring what is inferred when stacking behaviour is thought of in the context of the energy transition and presenting household level correlates of energy stacking behaviour. Thirdly, since fuel uses have gender-differentiated impacts, we investigate women’s bargaining power in the decision-making process of household <b>fuel</b> <b>choices.</b> We find that whilst higher household incomes are strongly associated with a transition towards the adoption of more modern fuels, especially lighting fuels, this transition takes place in a context of significant fuel stacking. In Tanzania, government policy has been aimed mostly at connecting households to the electric grid. However, the public health, environmental and social benefits of access to modern energy sources are likely to be diminished in a context of significant fuel stacking.
