Advances in available medical technologies and growth in the aging-driven cost of Medicare will accentuate the massive shift in health resources from people of working age to the elderly. Politicians already pork-barrel the ‘grey vote,’ and, the expanding elderly constituency can be expected to vote in favour of tax and health spending policies that extract higher transfers from younger workers. Sammut outlines different ‘health savings’ systems that could potentially avert intergenerational conflict and ease the cost pressures on Medicare...|$|R
30|$|How does {{abundant}} coal influence social expenditures? According to Wagner’s Law, {{as personal}} income grows, <b>government</b> functions <b>will</b> also extend, and public expenditures on education, culture, healthcare, {{and social welfare}} will accordingly increase (Wagner 1958). However, according to the state-centralism explanation of fiscal sociology, since the economic development of Shanxi’s coal-rich counties and their fiscal revenues rely heavily on coal-related rents, the <b>governments</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> higher state autonomy and will be less accountable to the public.

2500|$|Peña Nieto, however, {{said in a}} {{news conference}} that he can ease the waves of {{violence}} in Mexican Drug War by redirecting the focus of the military approach carried out by Mexico's current president, Felipe Calderón. Instead of focusing primarily on taking down the heads of the criminal organizations and the most-wanted drug lords of the cartels, he proposes to use government resources to put down homicides, kidnappings, and extortions—crimes that do the most damage to the Mexican people—by flooding troops and police into places with the highest rates of violence crimes. Peña Nieto, however, said that his proposal {{does not mean that the}} government will not tackle other crimes nor prevent drug trafficking, but rather noted that arresting drug bosses will no longer be the focus of his administration. Opponents of Peña Nieto have said that the PRI's return will mean the going back to the [...] "old PRI model" [...] of making deals with the cartels. Nonetheless, the presidential candidate has praised Calderón's decision of sending in troops to fight the cartels, and has emphasized plans to increase the military presence in areas most effected by drug-related violence, like Monterrey and Veracruz. The security policy of Peña Nieto does not say that it will stop fighting the drug cartels; it proposes that it will simply shift away from targeting the heads of the cartels. This redirection is a response to the criticism made by critics to Calderón for targeting a few main cartels and splitting them up into smaller and more violent factions. Peña Nieto's strategy would align with a new strain of thinking for the general public, which calls for law enforcement in both the United States and Mexico to make the reduction of violence, kidnappings, and extortion their overwhelming focus in the War on Drugs. According to Reuters, other experts argue that Mexico's criminal groups do not have to be provoked and often ambush Mexico's security forces when they are on patrol, and that the cartels have become so violent that the Mexican <b>government</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> no other option but to keep battling them – whether they want to or not.|$|E
