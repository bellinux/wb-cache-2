However, Lucy interrupts the ritual, bringing the Master back as a manic undead creature, hungry for human flesh and leaking electrical energy. The Master proceeds with a plot to transform the entire human race into his own clones, and using their combined presence, triangulates the [...] "drumbeat" [...] in his head to its source: The Time Lord President Rassilon (Timothy Dalton). The Time Lord Chancellor (Joe Dixon) describes the <b>drumming</b> <b>noise</b> in the Master's head as something [...] "istory says [...] a torment that stayed {{with him for the}} rest of his life." [...] The Time Lords, having set up the signal back in time in the Master's head as a child as a means to escape the last days of the Time War, return to the universe. Confronted with Rassilon, whose drumbeat is the cause of the Master's insanity, the Master teams up with the Doctor to destroy them. He too is sent back to Gallifrey when the Time Lords are again sealed away in the Time War, trapped once more.|$|E

60|$|From there, {{open and}} vague in the starlight, {{he saw the}} plain between {{the town and the}} harbour. In the woods above some night-bird made a strange <b>drumming</b> <b>noise.</b> Below beyond the palmaria on the beach, the Indian's dogs {{continued}} to bark uproariously. He wondered what had upset them so much, and, peering down from his elevation, was surprised to detect unaccountable movements of the ground below, as if several oblong pieces of the plain had been in motion. Those dark, shifting patches, alternately catching and eluding the eye, altered their place always away from the harbour, with a suggestion of consecutive order and purpose. A light dawned upon him. It was a column of infantry on a night march towards the higher broken country {{at the foot of the}} hills. But he was too much in the dark about everything for wonder and speculation.|$|E
6000|$|Submarines {{nowadays}} {{are expected}} {{to look out for}} themselves more than at the old practices, when the destroyers walked circumspectly. We dived and circulated under water for a while, and then rose for a sight--something like this: [...] "Up a little--up! Up still! Where the deuce has he got to--Ah! (Half a dozen orders as to helm and depth of descent, and a pause broken by a <b>drumming</b> <b>noise</b> somewhere above, which increases and passes away.) That's better! Up again! (This refers to the periscope.) Yes. Ah! No, we don't think! All right! Keep her down, damn it! Umm! That ought to be nineteen knots.... Dirty trick! He's changing speed. No, he isn't. He's all right. Ready forward there! (A valve sputters and drips, the torpedo-men crouch over their tubes and nod to themselves. Their faces have changed now.) He hasn't spotted us yet. We'll ju-ust--(more helm and depth orders, but specially helm)--'Wish we were working a beam-tube. Ne'er mind! Up! (A last string of orders.) Six hundred, and he doesn't see us! Fire!" ...|$|E
6000|$|In the {{foregoing}} cases sounds {{are made by}} the aid of structures already present and otherwise necessary; but in the following cases certain feathers have been specially modified {{for the express purpose}} of producing sounds. The drumming, bleating, neighing, or thundering noise (as expressed by different observers) made by the common snipe (Scolopax gallinago) must have surprised every one who has ever heard it. This bird, during the pairing-season, flies to [...] "perhaps a thousand feet in height," [...] and after zig-zagging about for a time descends to the earth in a curved line, with outspread tail and quivering pinions, and surprising velocity. The sound is emitted only during this rapid descent. No one was able to explain the cause until M. Meves observed that on each side of the tail the outer feathers are peculiarly formed (Fig. 41), having a stiff sabre-shaped shaft with the oblique barbs of unusual length, the outer webs being strongly bound together. He found that by blowing on these feathers, or by fastening them to a long thin stick and waving them rapidly through the air, he could reproduce the <b>drumming</b> <b>noise</b> made by the living bird. Both sexes are furnished with these feathers, but they are generally larger in the male than in the female, and emit a deeper note. In some species, as in S. frenata (Fig. 42), four feathers, and in S. javensis (Fig. 43), no less than eight on each side of the tail are greatly modified. Different tones are emitted by the feathers of the different species when waved through the air; and the Scolopax Wilsonii of the United States makes a switching noise whilst descending rapidly to the earth.

6000|$|We have as yet spoken {{only of the}} voice, but {{the males}} of various birds practise, during their courtship, what may be called {{instrumental}} music. Peacocks and Birds of Paradise rattle their quills together, and the vibratory movement apparently serves merely to make a noise, for it can hardly add to the beauty of their plumage. Turkey-cocks scrape their wings against the ground, and some kinds of grouse thus produce a buzzing sound. Another North American grouse, the Tetrao umbellus, when with his tail erect, his ruffs displayed, “he shows off his finery to the females, who lie hid in the neighbourhood,” drums rapidly with his “lowered wings on {{the trunk of a}} fallen tree,” or, according to Audubon, against his own body; the sound thus produced is compared by some to distant thunder, and by others to the quick roll of a drum. The female never drums, “but flies directly to the place where the male is thus engaged.” In the Himalayas the male of the Kalij pheasant “often makes a singular <b>drumming</b> <b>noise</b> with his wings, not unlike the sound produced by shaking a stiff piece of cloth.” On the west coast of Africa the little black-weavers (Ploceus?) congregate in a small party on the bushes round a small open space, and sing and glide through the air with quivering wings, “which make a rapid whirring sound like a child’s rattle.” One bird after another thus performs for hours together, but only during the courting-season. At this same season the males of certain nightjars (Caprimulgus) make a most strange noise with their wings. The various species of woodpeckers strike a sonorous branch with their beaks, with so rapid a vibratory movement that “the head appears to be in two places at once.” The sound thus produced is audible at a considerable distance, but cannot be described; and I feel sure that its cause would never be conjectured by any one who heard it for the first time. As this jarring sound is made chiefly during the breeding-season, it has been considered as a love-song; but it is perhaps more strictly a love-call. The female, when driven from her nest, has been observed thus to call her mate, who answered in the same manner and soon appeared. Lastly the male Hoopoe (Upupa epops) combines vocal and instrumental music; for during the breeding-season this bird, as Mr. Swinhoe saw, first draws in air and then taps the end of its beak perpendicularly down against a stone or the trunk of a tree, “when the breath being forced down the tubular bill produces the correct sound.” When the male utters its cry without striking his beak the sound is quite different.[109] ...|$|E

Air {{is at the same time}} swallowed, and the oesophagus thus becomes much swollen; and this probably acts as a resonator, not only with the hoopoe, but with pigeons and other birds. (52.

When a foraging wasp arrived, the highest ranking wasp present demanded food and then both fed the larvae. Each wasp pushed its head into a cell, drummed on the cell walls with its antennae and then deposited the food.

50|$|Their infants make a sharp squeal. Mature Pacific jumping mice evade their predators by leaping {{distances}} of over 150 cm; they leap with their head turned downwards, arching their back and diving on the ground, {{and at the}} same time preparing to make another leap. They may also evade predation by remaining motionless, and depending on their camouflage effect. They are most active from dusk until dawn. They feed by seizing food with their forepaws.Their behavior is typically nervous and high-strung, and they can be aggressive when trapped. However, despite showing some signs of aggressiveness, the Pacific jumping mouse is naturally gentle. When they engage in fighting, they produce a characteristic squeaking noise {{and at the same}} time pulsate their tail against the substrate and thus produce a <b>drumming</b> <b>noise.</b> When this rodent is agitated, it jumps and moves madly from one place to another.Pacific jumping mice prepare for summer by constructing a domed-shaped, fragile nest with a single entrance, usually placed on the ground.
