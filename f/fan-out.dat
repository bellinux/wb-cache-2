40|$|Abstract—Power {{consumption}} {{is a crucial}} concern in nanometer chip design. Researchers have shown that multiple supply voltage (MSV) is an effective method for power consumption reduction. The underlying idea behind MSV is the tradeoff between power saving and performance. In this paper, we present an effective voltage-assignment technique based on dynamic programming. For circuits without reconvergent <b>fan-outs,</b> an optimal solution for the voltage assignment is guaranteed; for circuits with reconvergent <b>fan-outs,</b> a near-optimal solution is obtained. We then generate a level shifter for each net that connects two blocks in different voltage domains and perform power-network-aware floorplanning for the MSV design. Experimental results show that our floorplanner is very effective in optimizing power consumption under timing constraints.

5000|$|More complex {{analysis}} than fan-in and <b>fan-out</b> {{is required}} when two different logic families are interconnected. <b>Fan-out</b> is ultimately {{determined by the}} maximum source and sink currents of an output and the maximum source and sink currents of the connected inputs; the driving device {{must be able to}} supply or sink at its output the sum of the currents needed or provided (depending on whether the output is a logic high or low voltage level) by all of the connected inputs, while maintaining the output voltage specifications. For each logic family, typically a [...] "standard" [...] input is defined by the manufacturer with maximum input currents at each logic level, and the <b>fan-out</b> for an output is computed as the number of these standard inputs that can be driven in the worst case. (Therefore, it is possible that an output can actually drive more inputs than specified by <b>fan-out,</b> even of devices within the same family, if the particular devices being driven sink and/or source less current, as reported on their data sheets, than a [...] "standard" [...] device of that family.) Ultimately, whether a device has the <b>fan-out</b> capability to drive (with guaranteed reliability) a set of inputs is determined by adding up all the input-low (max.) source currents specified on the datasheets of the driven devices, adding up all the input-high (max.) sink currents of those same devices, and comparing those sums to the driving device's guaranteed maximum output-low sink current and output-high source current specifications, respectively. If both totals are within the driving device's limits, then it has the DC <b>fan-out</b> capacity to drive those inputs on those devices as a group, and otherwise it doesn't, regardless of the manufacturer's given <b>fan-out</b> number. However, for any reputable manufacturer, if this current analysis reveals that the device cannot drive the inputs, the <b>fan-out</b> number will agree.|$|E

We use a path-based delay model to capture the timing constraints in the circuit. To reduce the problem size and improve the solution convergence, we iteratively identify and optimize the kmost critical paths in the circuit and their neighboring cells. More precisely in each iteration, we perform three operations: a) reposition the immediate <b>fan-outs</b> of the gates on the k-most critical paths; b) size down the immediate <b>fan-outs</b> of the gates on the k-most critical paths; c) simultaneously reposition and resize the gates on the k-most critical paths. Each of these operations is formulated and solved as a mathematical program by using efficient solution techniques.

Our simulation of the full adder preformed properly as designed; however unexpected exception is noted in the simulation of the serial binary adder. To identify and address the exception, we propose a new method for debugging the molecular circuit.

40|$|A common {{pattern in}} the {{architectures}} of modern interac-tive web-services is that of large request <b>fan-outs,</b> where even a single end-user request (task) arriving at an application server triggers tens to thousands of data accesses (sub-tasks) to different stateful backend servers. The overall response time of each task is bottlenecked by the completion time of the slowest sub-task, making such workloads highly sensi-tive to the tail of latency distribution of the backend tier. The large number of decentralized application servers and skewed workload patterns exacerbate the challenge in ad-dressing this problem. We address these challenges through BetteR Batch (BRB). By carefully scheduling requests in a decentralized and task-aware manner, BRB enables low-latency distributed storage systems to deliver predictable performance {{in the presence of}} large request <b>fan-outs.</b> Our preliminary simulation results based on production workloads show that our proposed de-sign is at the 99 th percentile latency within 38 % of an ideal system model while offering latency improvements over the state-of-the-art by a factor of 2.

If all of the known behaviour cannot be found in any of the generated scenarios, then the model must be faulty.
