40|$|Abstract: This paper {{explores the}} {{possibility}} of developing early warning indicators based on incident investigation. The use of early warning indicators may contribute to ensure that oil companies produce oil and gas without harmful spills. The incident investigated was a <b>hydraulic</b> oil <b>leak</b> from the Eirik Raude drilling rig during exploration drilling in the Barents Sea in April 2005. The incident is analyzed using influence diagrams, from which seven general barriers against <b>hydraulic</b> <b>leaks</b> have been identified. For each barrier both checkpoints and indicators have been developed, which provide information {{about the status of}} the barriers and early warning of potential spills. The work described in this paper has shown {{that it is possible to}} develop early warning indicators based on incident investigation. Several of the proposed checkpoints/indicators may have prevented the oil leak at Eirik Raude, if they had been in use prior to the incident...|$|R

50|$|After an investigation, it was {{determined}} that a design flaw with the engine air particle separator (EAPS) caused it to jam in flight, causing a shock wave in the hydraulics system and subsequent <b>leaks.</b> <b>Hydraulic</b> fluid <b>leaked</b> into the IR suppressors and was the cause of the nacelle fires. As a result, all Block-A V-22 aircraft were placed under flight restrictions until modification kits could be installed. No fielded Marine MV-22s were affected, as those Block-B aircraft already incorporated the modification.|$|R
50|$|The RAM-D (reliability, availability, {{maintainability}} and durability) tests {{ran from}} November 1981 to February 1982, demonstrating {{a wide range}} of operation concerns. The turret proved to have too slow a traverse to track fast moving targets, and had serious problems operating in cold weather, including numerous <b>hydraulic</b> <b>leaks.</b> The simple electronic counter-countermeasures (ECCM) suite could be defeated by only minor jamming. The used guns taken from U.S. Army stock were in twisted condition due to careless warehousing. Perhaps the most surprising problem was that the 30-year-old M48 chassis with the new 20-ton turret meant the vehicle had trouble keeping pace with the newer M1 and M2, the vehicles it was meant to protect.|$|R
50|$|Pressurized <b>hydraulic</b> fluid <b>leaks</b> can be {{dangerous}} to humans. A jet squirting from a pinhole leak can penetrate skin at pressures as low as 100 PSI / 6.9 bar. If the injected fluid is not surgically removed, gangrene and poisoning can occur.|$|R

50|$|The {{preliminary}} report found a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>leak</b> occurred shortly after takeoff (after {{the landing gear}} and flaps were retracted). The leak was from a flexible hose in the center hydraulic system, resulting {{in the loss of}} all fluid in that system. The drop in pressure was indicated by the EICAS and recorded by the flight data recorder.Later investigation indicated a popped circuit breaker behind the captains chair would have enabled the electric motor for releasing the undercarriage. The breaker was reset after landing and the undercarriage extended normally.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Excavators can {{be divided}} into two categories: {{hydraulic}} excavator and mechanical excavator. Due to the flexibility and mobility, hydraulic excavator has almost replaced the mechanical excavator. But there still exists some problems such as <b>hydraulic</b> <b>leaks</b> and high costs of manufacturing and maintaining. On the other hand, the latter one is the excavator of choice in oil sands digging and surface mining for its durability, high productivity and low ownership costs resulting from long economic operating life, but lacks flexibility due to the structural limitations. This paper introduces an innovative design of mechanical excavator with controllable mechanism based on functional analysis of the traditional hydraulic excavator. The solving model in the form of Function-Effect-Technical Action Process-Executive Action-Mechanism (F-E-P-A-M) is used. A planar 2 Degree-OF-Freedom (DOF) controllable mechanism is adopted as the executive mechanism. A backhoe type and a face shovel type excavator both with the ability to accomplish flexible output trajectories by the joint operations of three servo-motors are proposed...|$|R

5000|$|Bratukhin B-11 - To provide {{data for}} {{comparison}} with Yakovlev and Mil helicopters {{two examples of}} the [...] "B-11" [...] were authorized and underwent flight testing to measure their performance from April 1948. Single-engined flight, auto-rotation and a marked reduction in vibration were all demonstrated. Problems identified included; a persistent <b>hydraulic</b> <b>leak</b> and rotor stalling {{due to lack of}} lift from the fixed wing at high speeds. Many modifications were proposed before the first prototype was destroyed, and the pilots killed, after the right hand rotor shed a blade in flight. A general disillusionment with helicopters in general and superior handling and performance from single rotor designs led to termination of the twin lateral rotor Bratukhin helicopters.|$|E
50|$|McLaren again {{topped the}} {{times during the}} Saturday {{practice}} session with Hamilton posting the best time. Heidfeld was a surprise second for BMW Sauber, with Nico Rosberg in third. Kovalainen was fourth, ahead of the Toro Rosso of Buemi and the Toyota of Glock. Glock's session was far from trouble-free, as his Toyota developed a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>leak</b> during its first flying lap. He returned to the track just {{before the end of}} the session, to record the sixth best time. Only seven tenths of a second split Heidfeld in second from Barrichello's Brawn in thirteenth. At one point, Jaime Alguersuari was as high as second position, before falling down to 18th by the end. Both Force Indias lapped slower than the teenager, with Sutil also having an incident, misjudging turn eight and hit the barrier.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the safety concerns for older hydraulic elevators, there is risk of <b>leaking</b> <b>hydraulic</b> oil into the aquifer and causing potential environmental contamination.

50|$|Helicopter No. 2 {{experienced}} a partial hydraulic system failure but {{was able to}} fly on for four hours to the refueling location. There, an inspection showed that a <b>hydraulic</b> fluid <b>leak</b> had damaged a pump and that the helicopter could not be flown safely, nor repaired in time to continue the mission. Six helicopters {{was thought to be}} the absolute minimum required for the rescue mission, so with the force reduced to five, the local commander radioed his intention to abort. This request was passed through military channels to President Carter, who agreed.|$|R
5|$|The {{prototype}} aircraft, registered N767BA {{and equipped}} with JT9D turbofans, rolled out on August 4, 1981. By this time, the 767 program had accumulated 173 firm orders from 17 customers, including Air Canada, All Nippon Airways, Britannia Airways, Transbrasil, and Trans World Airlines (TWA). On September 26, 1981, the prototype took its maiden flight {{under the command}} of company test pilots Tommy Edmonds, Lew Wallick, and John Brit. The maiden flight was largely uneventful, save for the inability to retract the landing gear because of a <b>hydraulic</b> fluid <b>leak.</b> The prototype was used for subsequent flight tests.|$|R
5000|$|An {{investigation}} of the possible causes of the explosion was launched on 22 April 2010 by the USCG and the Minerals Management Service. On 11 May the United States administration requested the National Academy of Engineering conduct an independent technical investigation. The National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling was established on 22 May to [...] "consider {{the root causes of}} the disaster and offer options on safety and environmental precautions." [...] The investigation by United States Attorney General Eric Holder was announced on 1 June 2010. Also the United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce conducted a number of hearings, including hearings of Tony Hayward and heads of Anadarko and Mitsui's exploration unit. According to the US Congressional investigation, the rig's blowout preventer, built by Cameron International Corporation, had a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>leak</b> and a failed battery, and therefore failed.|$|E
5000|$|The {{first flight}} of the X-32A (designed for CTOL and carrier trials) took place on 18 September 2000, from Boeing's Palmdale plant to Edwards Air Force Base. The aircraft, piloted by Boeing test pilot Fred Knox, took 2200 ft of runway before {{becoming}} airborne at 150 knots at around 8:00 am. Shortly after take off, a minor <b>hydraulic</b> <b>leak</b> was discovered and the flight was cut from the expected 30 or 40 minutes to 20 minutes. According to Knox, the F/A-18 chase plane required [...] "a lot of afterburner" [...] {{to keep up with}} the X-32 during the initial stages. During the flight, the aircraft reached 10000 ft, attained a speed of 200 kn, and attained an angle of attack of 13Â°. Despite the shortened flight, about 80% of the planned test points were accomplished. It was powered by a conventional derivative of the F-22 reheated turbofan, designated F119-PW-614C.|$|E
5000|$|As of May 2010 it {{was unknown}} why the blowout {{preventer}} failed. Chief surveyor John David Forsyth of the American Bureau of Shipping testified in hearings before the Joint Investigation of the Minerals Management Service and the U.S. Coast Guard investigating {{the causes of}} the explosion that his agency last inspected the rig's blowout preventer in 2005. BP representatives suggested that the preventer could have suffered a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>leak.</b> Gamma-ray imaging of the preventer conducted on May 12 and May 13, 2010 showed that the preventer's internal valves were partially closed and were restricting the flow of oil. Whether the valves closed automatically during the explosion or were shut manually by remotely operated vehicle work is unknown. [...] A statement released by Congressman Bart Stupak revealed that, among other issues, the emergency disconnect system (EDS) did not function as intended and may have malfunctioned due to the explosion on the Deepwater Horizon.|$|E
25|$|Cutting fluids degrade {{over time}} due to {{contaminants}} entering the lubrication system. A {{common type of}} degradation is the formation of tramp oil, also known as sump oil, which is unwanted oil that has mixed with cutting fluid. It originates as lubrication oil that seeps out from the slideways and washes into the coolant mixture, as the protective film with which a steel supplier coats bar stock to prevent rusting, or as <b>hydraulic</b> oil <b>leaks.</b> In extreme cases {{it can be seen}} as a film or skin on the surface of the coolant or as floating drops of oil.|$|R
