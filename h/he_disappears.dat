With the capital of Ravenna under his control, Orestes appointed his son, Romulus to the throne despite the lack of support from the eastern court in Constantinople. Romulus, however, {{was little more than a}} child and figurehead for his father's rule. After ten months in power, during which time his authority and legitimacy were disputed beyond Italy, Romulus was forced to abdicate by Odoacer, a Germanic foederatus officer who defeated and executed Orestes.

25|$|Professor Simo Parpola, basing his {{findings}} on a fragmented letter surviving from that period, holds that Arda-Mulišši, known as Adrammelech in the Bible, {{was the son}} who killed the King, and that {{a series of events}} beginning in 694BCE {{set the stage for the}} assassinaton. In 694, Sennacherib's oldest son and heir-designate Assur-nãdin-sumi was captured by Babylonians and was removed to Elam, whereafter <b>he</b> <b>disappears</b> from the historical record. Arda-Mulišši, the next eldest son, was expected to be the next heir-designate. However, Naqi'a Zakitu, the king's second wife, (entirely unrelated to Arda-Mulišši) used her influence to have the King proclaim her own sickly and frail son Esarhaddon the heir-designate. Sennacherib made all of Assyria swear allegiance to the new crown prince.|$|E
