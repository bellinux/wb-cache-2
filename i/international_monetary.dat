5|$|In the General Theory and later, Keynes {{responded to}} the socialists and left-wing liberals who argued, {{especially}} during the Great Depression of the 1930s, that capitalism caused war.

His plans during World War II for post-war international economic institutions and policies (which contributed to the creation at Bretton Woods of the <b>International</b> <b>Monetary</b> Fund and the World Bank, and later {{to the creation of the}} General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and eventually the World Trade Organization) were aimed to give effect to this vision.|$|E
