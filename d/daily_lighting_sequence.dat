40|$|PURPOSE The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{relationship}} between objectively measured ambient light exposure and longitudinal changes in axial eye growth in childhood. METHODS A total of 101 children (41 myopes and 60 nonmyopes), 10 to 15 years of age participated in this prospective longitudinal observational study. Axial eye growth was determined from measurements of ocular optical biometry collected at four study visits over an 18 -month period. Each child’s mean <b>daily</b> <b>light</b> exposure was derived from two periods (each 14 days long) of objective light exposure measurements from a wrist-worn light sensor. RESULTS Over the 18 -month study period, a modest but statistically significant association between greater average <b>daily</b> <b>light</b> exposure and slower axial eye growth was observed (P ¼ 0. 047). Other significant predictors of axial eye growth in this population included children’s refractive error group (P < 0. 001), sex (P < 0. 01), and age (P < 0. 001). Categorized according to their objectively measured average <b>daily</b> <b>light</b> exposure and adjusting for potential confounders (age, sex, baseline axial length, parental myopia, nearwork, and physical activity), children experiencing low average <b>daily</b> <b>light</b> exposure (mean <b>daily</b> <b>light</b> exposure: 459 6 117 lux, annual eye growth: 0. 13 mm/y) exhibited significantly greater eye growth than children experiencing moderate (842 6 109 lux, 0. 060 mm/y), and high (1455 6 317 lux, 0. 065 mm/y) average <b>daily</b> <b>light</b> exposure levels (P ¼ 0. 01). CONCLUSIONS In this population of children, greater <b>daily</b> <b>light</b> exposure was associated with less axial eye growth over an 18 -month period. These findings support the role of light exposure in the documented association between time spent outdoors and childhood myopia...|$|R

40|$|Commercial {{protected}} {{cultivation of}} shade-tolerant pot-plants in The Netherlands has expanded enormously {{in the last}} decade. Typically, very low <b>daily</b> <b>light</b> integrals are applied (3 - 5 mol PAR m- 2 day- 1), which are achieved by use of heavy screening and application of a layer of chalk (CaCO 3) {{on the outside of}} the greenhouse to increase reflection of incoming irradiance. Although these low <b>daily</b> <b>light</b> integrals are meant to avoid damage by high light intensities and/or high temperatures, it is clear that they carry a production penalty, since potential crop growth is directly related to the amount of light that can be captured and efficiently used. Additionally, it remains unclear whether current <b>daily</b> <b>light</b> integrals are too conservative, which would create room for optimisation. Recently, a number of experiments have been carried out to examine the possibilities and limitations for cultivation of several shade-tolerant pot-plants at higher <b>daily</b> <b>light</b> integrals. For most species, plants could be grown faster when more light was allowed. Also, a significant reduction in energy use for heating could be achieved if more natural irradiance was allowed to enter the greenhouse. However, use of more light required higher levels of relative humidity to avoid light damage. In this paper, we present a synthesis of experiments, as well as an outlook to further improvements...|$|R

40|$|There is {{evidence}} {{in many countries}} globally that the prevalence of myopia is on the rise. Advances in measurement technology now allow many environmental factors potentially associated with the development and progression of myopia to be quantified reliably and sampled densely. Our recent prospective longitudinal study of Australian schoolchildren, utilising wearable sensor technology has provided the first direct evidence of {{a significant relationship between}} personal ambient light exposure and eye growth in childhood; demonstrating that greater <b>daily</b> <b>light</b> exposure is associated with slower eye growth. These findings support the potential for interventions aimed at increasing <b>daily</b> outdoor <b>light</b> exposure, to reduce the development and progression of myopia in childhood. Key Takeaways: • There {{is evidence}} of a rapid increase in myopia prevalence in recent decades in many developed countries. • An improved understanding of the environmental factors underlying eye growth and myopia in childhood is crucial for developing effective myopia control interventions. • Recent work utilising wearable sensors demonstrates the first direct evidence of a relationship between lower <b>daily</b> <b>light</b> exposure and faster axial eye growth. • Less than 60 minutes of bright outdoor light exposure appears to be a risk factor for faster eye growth and hence myopia development and progression in childhood. • These results support the potential for myopia control through increased <b>daily</b> <b>light</b> exposure (e. g. interventions to increase daily time outdoors) ...|$|R

40|$|The {{photoperiod}} (i. e., {{the daylight}} {{fraction of the}} 24 - h day and its seasonal changes) influences the annual cycle of many mammalian species. Especially the Syrian hamster (Mesocricetus auratus), which is an appropriate animal model to investigate the sebaceous gland activity, shows a strong photoperiodism controlling the sexual development {{as well as the}} function of androgen- controlled organs such as sebaceous glands. Short photoperiods with accompanying long dark periods lead to a sexual regression while long photoperiods stimulate the recrudescence. In light-physiologic studies Syrian hamsters were exposed to different <b>light</b> schedules. The <b>daily</b> <b>light</b> exposure was increased from 8 to 12, 13, 14, and 16 h. Sebaceous gland areas, weight of testes and accessory glands, tubular areas, and plasma levels of testosterone were determined. Syrian hamsters are sexually stimulated at a <b>daily</b> <b>light</b> exposure of 14 h. Below this light threshold the sexual regression begins. At a light schedule of 8 h the testes shrink, plasma testosterone levels and sebaceous gland areas show a significant reduction (“photoperiodic castration”). Therefore, in experiments of androgen- controlled organs of the Syrian hamster a minimum <b>daily</b> <b>light</b> period of 14 or 16 h is necessary for a sufficient testicular function and therefore for an effective stimulation of the sebaceous gland activity. Control animals of the same age and the same light schedule should be required to avoid pitfalls of photoperiodic effects...|$|R
50|$|Draper et al.'s (1985) mounds {{received}} 5 {{times the}} amount of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) summed over all sampled microsites throughout the first growing season; the control treatment consistently received about 14% of daily background PAR, while mounds received over 70%. By November, fall frosts had reduced shading, eliminating the differential. Quite apart from its effect on temperature, incident radiation is also important photosynthetically. The average control microsite was exposed to levels of light above the compensation point for only 3 hours, i.e., one-quarter of the <b>daily</b> <b>light</b> period, whereas mounds received light above the compensation point for 11 hours, i.e., 86% of the same daily period. Assuming that incident light in the 100-600 µEm‾²s‾1 intensity range is the most important for photosynthesis, the mounds received over 4 times the total <b>daily</b> <b>light</b> energy that reached the control microsites.|$|R
40|$|Differences in <b>daily</b> <b>light</b> {{exposure}} profiles {{have been}} reported, with younger M-types shown {{to spend more}} time in bright light, especially in the morning, compared with E-types. This study aimed to investigate how patterns of <b>daily</b> <b>light</b> exposure in older non-resident M-types and E-types compare. Sleep diaries were kept during actigraphic measurement of activity and light using the Actiwatch-L for 14 days in 12 M-types [eight females, mean ± standard deviation (SD) Horne–Östberg Morning–Eveningness Questionnaire (HÖ MEQ) score 75. 2 ± 1. 6] and 11 E-types (seven females, HÖ MEQ 41. 5 ± 4. 8), over 60 years old, living in their own homes. Light data were log-transformed, averaged over each hour, and group × time analysis of covariance (ancova) performed with age as a covariate. M-types had significantly earlier bed and wake time than E-types, but {{there was no significant difference}} in sleep duration, sleep efficiency or time spent in bed between groups. <b>Daily</b> exposure to <b>light</b> intensity greater than 1000 lux was compared between the two groups, with no significant difference in the duration of exposure to > 1000 lux between M-types and E-types. Twenty-four-hour patterns of light exposure show that M-types were exposed to higher light intensity at 06 : 00 h than E-types. Conversely, E-types were exposed to higher light intensity between 22 : 00 and 23 : 00 h than M-types. These findings show that differences in <b>daily</b> <b>light</b> exposure patterns found previously in younger M-types and E-types are also found in older M-types and E-types, but at an earlier clock-time, confirming the tendency to advance with ageing...|$|R

40|$|Smoking is {{considered}} {{the single most important}} preventable cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, contributing to increased incidence and severity of disabling conditions. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the contribution of chronic conditions to the disability burden across smoking categories in middle-aged adults in Belgium. Data from 10, 224 individuals aged 40 to 60 years who participated in the 1997, 2001, 2004, or 2008 Health Interview Surveys in Belgium were used. Smoking status was defined as never, former (cessation ≥ 2 years), former (cessation < 2 years), occasional light (< 20 cigarettes/day), <b>daily</b> <b>light,</b> and <b>daily</b> heavy (≥ 20 cigarettes/day). To attribute disability to chronic conditions, binomial additive hazards models were fitted separately for each smoking category adjusted for gender, except for former (cessation < 2 years) and occasional light smokers due to the small sample size. An increasing trend in the disability prevalence was observed across smoking categories in men (never = 4. 8 %, former (cessation ≥ 2 years) = 5. 8 %, <b>daily</b> <b>light</b> = 7. 8 %, daily heavy = 10. 7 %) and women (never = 7. 6 %, former (cessation ≥ 2 years) = 8. 0 %, <b>daily</b> <b>light</b> = 10. 2 %, daily heavy = 12. 0 %). Musculoskeletal conditions showed a substantial contribution to the disability burden in men and women across all smoking categories. Other important contributors were depression and cardiovascular diseases in never smokers; depression, chronic respiratory diseases, and diabetes in former smokers (cessation ≥ 2 years); chronic respiratory diseases, cancer, and cardiovascular diseases in <b>daily</b> <b>light</b> smokers; cardiovascular diseases and chronic respiratory diseases in men and depression and diabetes in women daily heavy smokers. Beyond the well-known effect of smoking on mortality, our findings showed an increasing trend of the disability prevalence and different contributors to the disability burden across smoking categories.

These studies also show that blind patients who cannot entrain and lack melanopsin cells have a significantly greater risk of suffering from circadian rhythm sleep disorders. While enucleation of blind patients and babies was a common practice for cosmetic or analgesic reasons, doctors now must make a more cautious decision on whether to enucleate blind patients, especially infants, because they may still have functioning photosensitive retinal ganglion cells that express melanopsin. In addition, there are now studies attempting to optimize light therapy for those with circadian rhythm sleep disorders that specifically try to stimulate melanopsin cells in blind patients.|$|R
40|$|Purpose Seasonal {{variations}} in myopia progression/axial elongation {{have been documented}} in studies of pediatric populations, and seasonal differences in light exposure have been hypothesized {{to play a role}} in these variations. However, the presence of similar changes in young adults has not been examined. Therefore, in this study, we examined the <b>daily</b> <b>light</b> exposure and longitudinal axial length changes in young adult emmetropes and progressing myopes over two different seasons. Methods Thirty eight young adults (mean age 22 ± 4 years, 19 progressing myopes, 19 emmetropes), had sixmonthly measures of axial length (AL) collected over a one-year period, in summer and winter months. Personal ambient light exposure data was also assessed using wrist worn light sensors that were worn in winter (May to August) and summer months (November to February), from which the mean daily (6 am to 6 pm) light exposure was derived. The influence of season and refractive error on the average <b>daily</b> <b>light</b> exposure and the six-monthly changes in AL were examined. Results Linear mixed model analyses revealed a significant effect of season, refractive error, and a season by refractive error interaction (each p 0. 05) (Figure 1). A significant interaction between the seasonal AL variations and light exposure was observed (p 0. 05). Conclusions In young adults, six monthly axial elongation and <b>daily</b> <b>light</b> exposure show seasonal variations that appear to differ according to refractive error. When compared to emmetropes, progressing myopes had greater axial elongation and lower light exposure in summer.
