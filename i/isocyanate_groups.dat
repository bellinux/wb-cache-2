50|$|This {{rotation}} {{takes place}} in five steps. The amine group present on the triptycene moiety is converted to an <b>isocyanate</b> <b>group</b> by condensation with phosgene (a).

This reaction irreversibly traps {{the system as a}} strained cyclic urethane that is higher in energy and thus energetically closer to the rotational energy barrier than the original state. Further rotation of the triptycene moiety therefore requires only a relatively small amount of thermal activation in order to overcome this barrier, thereby releasing the strain (d).

Our screening with yeast mutants revealed that it affects chromatin, DNA damage response, protein-ubiquitylation and chaperones, oxidative stress, TOR pathway and DNA repair processes. We also show that NSNM acts as an epigenetic modifier as its treatment causes reduction in global histone acetylation and formation of histone adducts. Cells treated with NSNM exhibited increase in mitochondrial membrane potential as well as intracellular ROS levels and the effects were rescued by addition of reduced glutathione to the medium. We also report that deletion of SOD 1 and SOD 2, the superoxide dismutase in Saccharomyces cerevisiae displayed hypersensitivity to NSNM. Furthermore, NSNM treatment causes rapid depletion of total glutathione and reduced glutathione.

The NCO index (NCO equivalent/OH equivalent) was fixed at 1. 00. The characteristic times such as cream time, gel time, rise time and tack free time were followed during cup test. The physical properties were characterized and studied by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and foam density.

However, tensile strength and elongation at break were enhanced by the addition of Emerox® 14001 at 20 wt% contents replacement and then decreased at higher content.
