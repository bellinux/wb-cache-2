5|$|In 1959, {{observations}} {{in the microwave}} part of the electromagnetic (EM) spectrum (0.1–10GHz) led {{to the discovery of}} the Jovian decimetric radiation (<b>DIM)</b> <b>and</b> the realization that it was synchrotron radiation emitted by relativistic electrons trapped in the planet's radiation belts. These synchrotron emissions were used to estimate the number and energy of the electrons around Jupiter and led to improved estimates of the magnetic moment and its tilt.|$|E
5|$|The French 7th Army was {{assigned}} to protect the northernmost part of the Allied front. It contained the 1st Light Mechanized Division (1re DLM), the 25th Motorised Infantry Division (25e Division d'Infanterie Motorisée, or 25e <b>DIM)</b> <b>and</b> the 9th Motorised Infantry Division (9e DIM). This force would advance to Breda in the Netherlands.|$|E
5|$|Ultra-stripped supernovae {{occur when}} the {{exploding}} star has been stripped (almost) {{all the way to}} the metal core, via mass transfer in a close binary. As a result, very little material is ejected from the exploding star (~0.1 MSun). In the most extreme cases, ultra-stripped supernovae can occur in naked metal cores, barely above the Chandrasekhar mass limit. SN 2005ek might be an observational example of an ultra-stripped supernova, giving rise to a relatively <b>dim</b> <b>and</b> fast decaying light curve. The nature of ultra-stripped supernovae can be both iron core-collapse and electron capture supernovae, depending on the mass of the collapsing core.|$|E

5|$|The 2001 {{study by}} {{researchers}} at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography concluded that the imbalance between global <b>dimming</b> <b>and</b> global warming at the surface leads to weaker turbulent heat fluxes to the atmosphere. This means globally reduced evaporation and hence precipitation occur in a <b>dimmer</b> <b>and</b> warmer world, which could ultimately lead to a more humid atmosphere in which it rains less.|$|R
5|$|Filming {{occurred}} during October and November 1998 in the Dallas, Texas area. The producers initially wanted to film in Falls City, Nebraska, where the real-life events had taken place; however, budget constraints meant that principal photography had {{to occur in}} Texas. The film's cinematography uses <b>dim</b> <b>and</b> artificial lighting throughout and was influenced {{by a variety of}} styles, including neorealism and the films of Martin Scorsese, while the soundtrack consisted primarily of country, blues, and rock music from the film. The film's themes, which have been explored by many scholars, include the nature of romantic and platonic relationships, the causes of violence against LGBT people, transgender people and the gender binary, and the relationship among social class, race, and gender.|$|E
5|$|The {{porpoise}} eye {{is relatively}} small for its size, yet they do retain a good degree of eyesight. As well as this, {{the eyes of a}} porpoise are placed on the sides of its head, so their vision consists of two fields, rather than a binocular view like humans have. When porpoises surface, their lens and cornea correct the nearsightedness that results from the refraction of light; their eyes contain both rod and cone cells, meaning they can see in both <b>dim</b> <b>and</b> bright light. Porpoises do, however, lack short wavelength sensitive visual pigments in their cone cells indicating a more limited capacity for colour vision than most mammals. Most porpoises have slightly flattened eyeballs, enlarged pupils (which shrink as they surface to prevent damage), slightly flattened corneas and a tapetum lucidum; these adaptations allow for large amounts of light to pass through the eye and, therefore, they are able to form a very clear image of the surrounding area.|$|E

50|$|The {{luminosity}} of {{the explosion}} occurring in luminous red novae is between that of a supernova (which is brighter) <b>and</b> a nova (<b>dimmer).</b> The visible light lasts for weeks or months, and is distinctively red in colour, becoming <b>dimmer</b> <b>and</b> redder over time.

By around 25,000 operating hours, it will typically be half {{the brightness of}} a new lamp (although some manufacturers claim much longer half-lives for their lamps). Lamps that do not suffer failures of the emission mix or integral ballast electronics will eventually develop this failure mode. They still work, but have become <b>dim</b> <b>and</b> inefficient. The process is slow, and often becomes obvious only when a new lamp is operating next to an old one.|$|E

25|$|Common bonsai species (particularly {{those from}} the Japanese tradition) are {{temperate}} climate trees from hardiness zones 7 to 9, and require moderate temperatures, moderate humidity, and full sun in summer with a dormancy period in winter that may need be near freezing. They do not thrive indoors, where the light is generally too <b>dim,</b> <b>and</b> humidity often too low, for them to grow properly. Only during their dormant period can they safely be brought indoors, and even then the plants require cold temperatures, reduced watering, and lighting that approximates {{the number of hours}} the sun is visible. Raising the temperature or providing more hours of light than available from natural daylight can cause the bonsai to break dormancy, which often weakens or kills it.|$|E

25|$|After Warner was {{cut from}} the Packers' {{training}} camp in 1994, {{he got a job}} working the night shift as a Night Stock Clerk at a local Hy-Vee grocery store, in addition to his work as an assistant coach at Northern Iowa. While Warner was working as an assistant coach, the couple were living in Brenda's parents' basement in Cedar Falls. Brenda's parents were killed in 1996 when their Mountain View, Arkansas home was destroyed by a tornado. Warner and Brenda married on October 11, 1997, at the St. John American Lutheran Church, the same place where the service for Brenda's parents was held. Warner was still hoping to get an NFL tryout, but with that possibility appearing <b>dim</b> <b>and</b> the long hours at the Hy-Vee for minimum wage taking their toll, Warner began his Arena League career.|$|E
25|$|Alex {{returns to}} his parents' flat, {{only to find that}} they are letting his room to a lodger. Now homeless, he wanders the streets and enters a public library, hoping to learn of a painless method for {{committing}} suicide. The old scholar whom Alex had assaulted in Part 1 finds him and beats him, with the help of several friends. Two policemen come to Alex's rescue, but turn out to be <b>Dim</b> <b>and</b> Billyboy, a former rival gang leader. They take Alex outside of town, brutalise him, and abandon him there. Alex collapses at the door of an isolated cottage, realising too late that it is the one he and his droogs invaded in Part 1. The writer, F. Alexander, still lives here, but his wife has since died of injuries she sustained in the gang-rape. He does not recognise Alex, but gives him shelter and questions him about the conditioning he has undergone. Alexander and his colleagues, all highly critical of the government, plan to use Alex as a symbol of state brutality and thus prevent the incumbent government from being re-elected. Alex inadvertently reveals that he was the ringleader of the home invasion; he is removed from the cottage and locked in an upper-story bedroom as a relentless barrage of classical music plays over speakers. He attempts suicide by leaping from the window.|$|E

40|$|Worldwide {{observations}} indicate secular {{trends of}} all-sky surface solar radiation on a decadal time scale, termed global <b>dimming</b> <b>and</b> brightening. Accordingly, the observed surface radiation in Japan generally shows a strong decline {{until the end}} of the 1980 s and then a recovery until around 2000. Because a substantial number of measurement stations are located within or close to populated areas, one may speculate that the observed trends are strongly influenced by local air pollution and are thus not of large-scale significance. This hypothesis poses a serious question as to what regional extent the global <b>dimming</b> <b>and</b> brightening are significant: are the global <b>dimming</b> <b>and</b> brightening truly global phenomena, or regional, or even only local? Our study focused on 14 meteorological observatories that measured all-sky surface solar radiation, zenith transmittance, and maximum transmittance. On the basis of municipality population time series, historical land use maps, recent satellite images, and actual site visits, we concluded that eight stations have been significantly influenced by urbanization, with the remaining six stations being left pristine. Between the urban and rural areas, no marked differences were identified in the temporal trends of the aforementioned meteorological parameters. Our findings suggest that global <b>dimming</b> <b>and</b> brightening in Japan occurred on a large scale, independently of urbanization...|$|R

500|$|In [...] April 1940, Jesse Beams, Ross Gunn, Fermi, Nier, Merle Tuve and Harold Urey had {{a meeting}} at the American Physical Society in Washington, D.C. At the time, the {{prospect}} of building an atomic bomb seemed <b>dim,</b> <b>and</b> even creating a chain reaction would likely require enriched uranium. They therefore recommended that research be conducted with the aim of developing the means to separate kilogram amounts of uranium-235. At a lunch on 21 May 1940, George B.

500|$|Aronofsky {{planned to}} have a strong {{presentation}} of the thematic movement from darkness into light. He originally sought to show only a silhouette of the man until the second of the film's three acts, but he chose not to be so extreme, wanting to be more communicative to the audience. The movement was presented less aggressively in the film; Jackman's characters are seen in silhouette at the beginning, kept out of key light. In each of the three periods, the lighting on Jackman's characters is initially <b>dim</b> <b>and</b> gradually grows brighter as the storylines unfold. Meanwhile, Weisz's characters are frequently awash with light in the storylines. Libatique described the metaphoric change of the lighting on Jackman's characters, [...] "We follow the arc of the Thomas character as he gets {{closer and closer to the}} truth." ...|$|E
500|$|Pächt {{described}} {{the work in}} terms of an [...] "interior illusion", noting {{the manner in which the}} viewer's eye falls across the nave, the crossing, but [...] "only then, [...] looking through and over the rood screen, the choir." [...] From this Pächt views the perspective as deliberately lacking cohesion, as [...] "the relationship between the parts of the building is not shown in full... The transition from foreground to background is ingeniously masked by the figure of the Madonna herself, who obscures the crossing pier; the middle ground is practically eliminated and our eye crosses over it without our becoming aware of it." [...] The illusion is enhanced by the use of colour to suggest light: the interior is <b>dim</b> <b>and</b> in shadow while the unseen exterior seems bathed in bright light.|$|E
