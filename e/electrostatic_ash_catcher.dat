40|$|The non-Newtonian {{fluid flow}} {{in a sharp}} 90 curved pipe is studied numerically to obtain the {{pressure}} loss coefficient prompted by disagreement between the existing empirical correlations and results obtained by computer codes. This disagreement results from presumption of fully developed flow throughout the curvature (correlations) while the actual flow is partially developed for the Newtonian and sharp 90 curved bend non-Newtonian flows, and fully developed for slightly bent 90 curvature non-Newtonian flow. The Quadratic model is employed to accommodate the shear-thickening behavior of an <b>electrostatic</b> <b>ash</b> and water mixture. Numerical results are obtained for different values of Reynolds number. Finally, results for local pressure loss coefficient are compared with values obtained for the Power law rheological model...|$|R
40|$|In {{the paper}} a new {{rheological}} model for an <b>electrostatic</b> <b>ash</b> and water mixture is proposed. The fundamental equation of the rheological model {{was used to}} determine the relationship between the shear stress and the shear rate as well as the equation of a velocity profile for the flow through a straight pipe. Experimental results obtained from a capillary viscometer were used as the basis to determine the parameters for the proposed model by the non-linear regression analysis. With the Quadratic law a numerical analysis of a mixture flow through a capillary pipe with the finite volume method was performed. The derived equations for the velocity profile, shear stress and shear rate were validated through a comparison of numerically obtained and theoretical results. Finally, the compariosn between the Quadratic and the Power law is presented...|$|R
50|$|The kettle grill is {{considered}} the classic American grill design. The original and often-copied Weber kettle grill was invented in 1951 by George Stephen. It has remained {{one of the most}} commercially successful charcoal grill designs to date. Smaller and more portable versions exist, such as the Weber Smokey Joe. The kettle grill is composed of a lid, cooking grid, charcoal grid, lower chamber, venting system, and legs. Some models include an <b>ash</b> <b>catcher</b> pan and wheels. The lower chamber that holds the charcoal is shaped like a kettle, giving the grill its name. The key to the kettle grill's cooking abilities is its shape. The kettle design distributes heat more evenly. When the lid is placed on the grill, it prevents flare-ups from dripping grease, and allows heat to circulate around the food as it cooks. It also holds in flavor-enhancing smoke produced by the dripping grease or from smoking wood added to the charcoal fire.|$|R

The equipments {{of the plant}} were manufactured {{by more than one}} hundred companies. In 1965, first gas-fired power unit having a total power of 200 MW were finished. In 1969, the twelfth unit was finished and the plant has been launched into service for [...] "Lvivenergo" [...] with a total capacity of 2,300 MW. Among some other power stations of the company were Dobrotvir TES and Rivne Nuclear Power Plant. In 1975, a computer-based monitoring system was installed. From 1978 to 1980, to reduce pollutant emission, <b>electrostatic</b> <b>ash</b> filters were added to the plant. The ash from filters is used by the building industry to produce cement. In 1984, all of the 12 units has been modified {{to be able to be}} fired with natural gas. From 1985 to 1990, the power units no. 9 and 10 has been equipped with asynchronous-synchronous turbogenerators type ASTG-200. This helps to reduce reactive power and increase efficiency and stability. From 1995, according to a presidential order, the power plant became an independent organization and part of the power generating open joint-stock company Zakhidenergo that included Dobrotvir TES and Ladyzhyn TES (part of the former [...] "Vinnytsiaenergo").|$|R

Dry bottom boilers at the Detmarovice Power Plant (the Czech Republic) were selected for this study. Combustion tests were performed using mixture of coal and mineral oil residues at the minimum and maximum output of the power plant. Fly ashes for chemical analysis, phase analysis and colour measurements were sampled from the four sections of <b>electrostatic</b> fly <b>ash</b> precipitator. Colour parameters indicate relationships with concentrations of elements which are preferentially bound in silicate matrix.

40|$|The {{measurement}} of total mercury in flue gas {{based on an}} economical aluminum matrix sorbent was developed in this paper. A sorbent trap consisted of three tubes was employed to capture Hg from flue gas. Hg trapped on sorbent was transferred into solution by acid leaching and then detected by CVAAS. Hg adsorbed on sorbent was recovered completely by leaching process. The 87. 7 % recovery of Hg in flue gas by tube 1 and tube 2 was obtained on the equipment of coal combustion and sampling in lab. In order to evaluate the ability to recover and accurately quantify Hg 0 on the sorbent media, the analytical bias test on tube 3 spiked with Hg 0 was also performed and got the average recovery of 97. 1 %. Mercury measurements based on this method were conducted for three coal-fired power plants in China. The mercury in coal is distributed into bottom <b>ash,</b> <b>electrostatic</b> precipitator (ESP) <b>ash,</b> wet flue gas desulfurization (WFGD) reactant, and flue gas, and the relative distribution varied depending on {{factors such as the}} coal type and the operation conditions of plants.

40|$|The {{burning of}} brown coal for {{electricity}} generation produces thousands of tonnes of fly ash each year. Treatment of the fly ash can reduce leach rates of metals and {{allow it to}} be disposed in less prescribed landfill. A geopolymer matrix was investigated as a potential stabilisation method for fly <b>ash</b> obtained from <b>electrostatic</b> precipitators and <b>ash</b> disposal ponds. The ratio of fly ash and geopolymer was varied {{to determine the effects of}} different compositions on leaching rates. The major element leachate concentrations obtained from pond ash were lower than that of precipitator fly ash. Conversely, precipitator ash-geopolymers were better for trace heavy metal stabilisation. Effective reduction of elemental concentrations in the leachate has been achieved, particularly for calcium, arsenic, selenium, strontium and barium. Scanning electron microscopy revealed the distribution of metals originated from fly ash and from added geopolymer material. It also showed that some elements are leached from ash particles to the geopolymer phase and others remained as undissolved particles. Qualitative analysis showed that fly ash particles interacted with the geopolymers phase through surface reactions. <br /...|$|R
40|$|International audienceMunicipal {{solid waste}} (MSW) flue gas {{residues}} require further treatment {{prior to disposal}} or reuse, and vitrification {{is one of the}} main solidification-stabilization processes. This paper investigates the high temperature behavior of MSW flue gas residues, performed in laboratory experiments up to 1400 °C, and coupled with thermogravimetric analyses, X-ray diffraction, chemical and electron microprobe analyses. Melting temperatures of <b>electrostatic</b> precipitator (ESP) <b>ash</b> are in the range of 1202 - 1272 °C, whereas semi-dry scrubber residues melt between 1900 and 2300 °C. The mean liquidus temperature of flue gas residues can be simply evaluated as a function of their CaO content, by using the CaO-SiO 2 -Al 2 O 3 ternary diagram. For ESP ash, the liquidus phase is a Zn-rich aluminous spinel, followed by anorthite at 1225 °C, and melilite at 1190 °C. The total mass loss reaches 18 wt. % at 1300 °C. Moreover, 90 % of evaporation takes place below 1000 °C, linked to evaporation of C, Cl, S, Na, K, and of the toxic metals Hg, Cd, Pb, Cu. Due to the high partial pressure of chlorine during heating, chloride is the most probable form of evaporation for Cd, Pb, and Cu. However, most of Zn, Cr, Ni, Sb and Sn remain in the vitrified product...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The use of {{municipal}} solid waste incineration (MSWI) <b>electrostatic</b> precipitator fly <b>ash</b> (ESPFA) as partial replacement of cement was studied in this work in order to provide a method to assess its potential reactivity in presence of cement. Thermal fly ash (TFA) and ground sand (GS), respectively pozzolanic and chemically inert materials, were also used as partial replacement of Portland cement {{in order to understand the}} effects of ESPFA on cementitious materials properties. In this study, cement pastes were designed keeping the sulphate content constant. Isothermal calorimetry was used to characterize the early-age behaviour. The results showed the influence of the mix design of cement pastes. Compressive strength tests, mercury intrusion porosimetry, thermogravimetry, and calorimetric measurements were carried out on mortars and cement pastes containing one of the three mineral additions. ESPFA had a chemically inert behaviour but the strength and thermogravimetric analyses showed their physical effect. The high specific surface of ESPFA actually leads to relatively good activity coefficient and enhanced portlandite formation. The leaching of calcium, chromium, lead and zinc was studied by tests at controlled pH. Results showed that ESPFA do not affect durability. Moreover, the concentrations of heavy metals in the leaching solution were lower than allowed concentrations. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|Globally, {{coal-fired}} power plants are the largest industrial source of carbon dioxide (CO 2). CO 2 emissions from flue gas have potential for direct mineralization with <b>electrostatic</b> precipitator fly <b>ash</b> particles in the field. Demonstration scale accelerated mineral carbonation (AMC) studies were conducted at the Jim Bridger Power Plant, a large coal fired power plant located in Wyoming, USA. AMC produces kinetically rapid conditions for increased rates of mineralization of CO 2, sulfur dioxide (SO 2) and mercury (Hg) on fly ash particles. Control and AMC reacted fly ash particles were investigated for: change in carbon (expressed as CaCO 3), sulfur (expressed as SO 42 −), and mercury (Hg) contents; topology and surface chemical composition by scanning electron microscope/energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy analysis; chemical distribution of trace elements; and aqueous mineral solubility by the toxicity characteristic leaching procedure. Results of the AMC process show an increase in C, S, and Hg on AMC fly ash particles suggesting that multiple pollutants from flue gas can be removed through this direct mineral carbonation process. Results also suggest that the AMC process shifts soluble trace elements in fly ash to less leachable mineral fractions. The {{results of this study}} can provide insight into potential successful field implementation of AMC...|$|R
40|$|Fly ash and Air Pollution Control (APC) {{residues}} {{collected from}} three {{municipal solid waste}} incinerators in Denmark and Greenland were treated by electrodialytic remediation at pilot scale for 8 - 10 h. This work presents {{for the first time}} the effect of electrodialytic treatment on polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDD) and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDF), and how these levels impact on the valorization options for fly ash and APC residue. PCDD/PCDF levels in the original residues ranged between 4. 85 and 197 ng g(- 1), being higher for the <b>electrostatic</b> precipitator fly <b>ash.</b> The toxic equivalent (TEQ) varied ten fold, ranging 0. 18 - 2. 0 ng g(- 1) I-TEQ with penta and hexa-homologs being most significant for toxicity. After the electrodialytic treatment PCDD/PCDF levels increased in the residues (between 1. 4 and 2. 0 times). This does not mean PCDD/PCDF were synthesized, but else that soluble materials dissolve, leaving behind the non-water soluble compounds, such as PCDD/PCDF. According to the Basel Convention, PCDD/PCDF levels in these materials is low (< 15 mu g WHO-TEQ kg(- 1)) and the fly ash and APC residue could eventually be valorized, for instance as construction material, provided end-of-waste criteria are set and that a risk assessment of individual options is carried out, including the end-of-life stage when the materials become waste again.

40|$|The coals, {{associated}} sediments and combustion products, {{from the}} Tertiary, Mae Moh Lignite Mine Lampang, Thailand, {{have been investigated}} using XRD, XRF, NAA and SEM/EDS. The investigation is primary aimed at documenting the overall mineralogy and geochemistry of the coal and combustion products, {{in an attempt to}} briefly describe the local environmental impacts of resource utilization.;Ash content in composite run of mine samples in three important (J, K and Q) coal zones averages 44 %. Ash in the power plant feed coal averages 41 %. Dominant mineral phases in the zones include: detrital quartz, illite and kaolinite along with authigenic calcite and pyrite. The detrital minerals plus pyrite dominate the lignite horizons while calcite dominates the intra-seam partings.;The highest ash content and major element (Si, Al, Ca, Fe, K and S) concentrations in coal is reported in samples from J zone. There is an overall decrease in ash and major element concentration from J to Q zones. These coals are particularly high in S ranging from 0. 3 to 14 %, with an average of 8 %.;As with the major elements, the trace elements are enriched in J zone, particularly in the upper portion, and show an overall concentration decrease from J to Q zone. The As content of these coals, which ranges from 3 to 488 ppm with an overall average of 60 ppm, is significantly higher than the reported global average.;The minerals identified in the combustion products include quartz, magnetite, hematite, anhydrite, mullite, gehelenite, anorthite and clinopyroxene. Silicon, Al, Fe and Ca, which account for more than 90 % of the major elements in the ash, show little partitioning between samples of bottom <b>ash</b> (BA) and <b>electrostatic</b> precipitator <b>ash</b> (ESP). Arsenic, Co, Cr, Mo, Sb, Se, U and Zn, which are all enriched in samples of ESP ash relative to BA, show a distinct concentration increase with decreasing particle size.;Based on an annual coal consumption of approximately 16 million tons, 6. 5 million tons of ash, which contain significant proportions of potentially toxic trace elements, are produced annually. Calculations show that for most trace elements selective mining would result in an annual emission reduction of 20 to 50 %. For these elements cleaning the coal prior to combustion could produce a 30 % decrease...|$|R
40|$|The final {{setting time}} of mortar, or t 0, {{corresponds}} {{to the time when}} its mechanical properties such as Young’s modulus or tensile strength start to develop. In the precast concrete industry or in a construction site, the knowledge of t 0 allows a safe early formwork removal. This parameter is also essential for modeling purposes, especially as regards to the very early age behaviour of concrete structures. Until now, the most used standardized methods developed for the setting time detection are destructive and non-continuous. Manual measurements have to be made regularly on several samples throughout the whole test, until final set has occurred. The ultrasonic pulse velocity (UPV) measurement is a well-established method which permits to follow the evolution of fresh concrete throughout its setting process. The early age evolution of cement-based materials properties can be correlated with UPV measurements. Most of these correlations imply the measurement of P-waves, due to the easy implementation of such tests compared to the S-waves propagation monitoring. However, ultrasonic S-waves seem to be better indicators of the mechanical setting of cement-based materials, since they are more sensitive to the solid matrix connectivity than P-waves. This study proposes a new methodology, based on the UPV measurements of P- and S-waves, and isothermal calorimetry, to determine the final setting time of mortars containing various rates of substitution of Portland cement by thermal power station fly ash (TFA) and Municipal Solid Waste Incineration (MSWI) <b>Electrostatic</b> Precipitator fly <b>ash</b> (EFA). The S-waves velocity and dynamic elastic properties seem to be the most accurate indicators of the setting process, since they are closely related to the shear modulus development at early age, and allow capturing microstructural evolutions that usual UPV methods do not detect. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe mineral carbonation, {{a process}} of {{converting}} CO 2 into stable minerals (mineralization), has been studied extensively to capture and store CO 2. However, most of the mineral carbonation studies have been largely investigated at lab scale. Preliminary and pilot scale studies for accelerated mineral carbonation (AMC) were conducted {{at one of the}} largest coal-fired power plants (2120  MW) in the USA by reacting flue gas with fly ash particles in a fluidized bed reactor. In the preliminary experiments, flue gas CO 2 and SO 2 concentrations decreased from 13. 0 to 9. 6 % and from 107. 8 to 15. 1  ppmv, respectively during the first 2  min. of reaction. The flue gas treatment increased mercury (Hg) concentration in fly ash (0. 1 to 0. 22  mg/kg) suggesting that fly ash particles also mineralized flue gas Hg. From these results, we designed and developed pilot scale process skid consisting — a moisture reducing drum (MRD) (0. 9 mΦ× 1. 8 m), a heater/humidifier (0. 9 mΦ× 1. 8 m), and a fluidized bed reactor (FBR) (0. 9 – 1. 2 mΦ× 3. 7 m) to capture and mineralize flue gas CO 2. Flue gas was withdrawn from the stack and was fed to the MRD at about 0. 094  m 3 /s. The MRD and the heater/humidifier pretreat flue gas before it enters the FBR. The MRD captures droplets of water entrained in the flue gas to protect the blower placed between the MRD and the heater/humidifier. The heater/humidifier enables control of flue gas moisture and temperature. Approximately 100 – 300  kg of fresh fly ash was collected from the <b>electrostatic</b> precipitator through <b>ash</b> hopper and placed in the fluidized-bed reactor. The fly ash particles were fluidized by flow of flue gas through a distributor plate in the FBR. The pilot scale studies were conducted at a controlled pressure (115. 1  kPa) by controlling the flue gas moisture content. The flue gas was continuously monitored to measure flue gas CO 2, SO 2 and NOx concentrations by an industrial grade gas analyzer, while the fresh and spent fly ashes were analyzed for calcium carbonate (CaCO 3), sulfur (S), and mercury (Hg) content. The pilot scale study results suggest that an appreciable amount of flue gas CO 2 and significant amounts of SO 2 and Hg can be directly captured (without separation) and mineralized by the fly ash particles...|$|R
