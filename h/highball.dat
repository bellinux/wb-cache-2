He arrives at the ballpark to watch the game, but has become so inebriated that the game appears to him in reverse, with the players running the bases backwards and the baseball flying back into the pitcher's hand. After the game is over, Mr. Brown is escorted home {{by one of his}} friends. When they arrive at Brown's house, they encounter his wife who becomes furious with the friend and proceeds to physically assault him, believing he is responsible for her husband's severe intoxication.|$|E

5000|$|In January 1945, at the Vickers {{experimental}} {{facility at}} Foxwarren, near Cobham, Surrey, a Douglas A-26 Invader of the USAAF was adapted to carry two <b>Highballs</b> almost completely enclosed in the bomb bay, using parts from a Mosquito conversion. After brief flight {{testing in the}} UK, the kit was sent to Wright Field, Ohio and installed in an A-26C Invader. Twenty-five inert <b>Highballs,</b> renamed [...] "Speedee" [...] bombs, were also sent {{for use in the}} USAAF trials. Drop tests were carried out over Choctawhatchee Bay near Eglin Field, Florida but the programme was abandoned, after the bomb bounced back at A-26C-25-DT Invader 43-22644 on Water Range 60, causing loss of the rear fuselage and a fatal crash on 28 April 1945.|$|R
25|$|The main {{attraction}} for tourists is {{a prototype of}} the World War II Barnes Wallis <b>Highball</b> bouncing bomb that was tested in the sea off Reculver between 6 April and 13 May 1943. The location was chosen because the shallow water allowed easy recovery at low tide, and it was secure and close to RAF Manston. To imitate the weight of explosive, the designers filled the <b>Highball</b> with checol: concrete and chalk. The Army found this exhibit on the seabed in 1997, {{and it has been}} conserved for display. The Upkeep bouncing bomb, a later development of this prototype, was used in the 1943 Dambuster raids.|$|E
