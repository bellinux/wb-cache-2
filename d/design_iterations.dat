25|$|The centre was {{the result}} of many <b>design</b> <b>iterations,</b> some of them being {{substantially}} larger and including an underground bus terminal and a large underground car park. Political concerns and cost implications meant that those concepts did not proceed. However, {{at the time of its}} inception in the early 2000s the centre was still Auckland's largest transport project ever, built to move rail access closer to the city's CBD and help boost Auckland's low usage of public transport. It is one of the few underground railway stations in the world designed for use by diesel trains.|$|E
500|$|The makeup for the {{character}} of The Great Mutato was designed and created by special effects supervisor Tony Lindala. The Mutato mask went through several <b>design</b> <b>iterations</b> on paper, including 10â€“15 drawings and a color rendition. Constructed from latex, and containing an articulated second mouth, it cost $40,000 and took between five and seven hours to apply. In addition to the mask, Chris Owens wore contact lenses and dentures. Owens later recalled that [...] "the makeup had taken seven hours, and then I had sat around for three or four. And now I was going {{to sit in the}} dark, and I could only see out of one eye. They put a big contact lens in." [...] Initial versions of the costume were deemed [...] "too human looking" [...] and so a newer design was chosen.|$|E
500|$|Development of Solar 2 {{lasted for}} at least ten months. The game was {{developed}} using Microsoft XNA, a set of tools focused on video game development created by Microsoft.

[...] However, he commented {{that the concept of}} both games took several <b>design</b> <b>iterations</b> to reach its final version: [...] "I played with many, many ideas before finally settling on what I have now." [...] Sound designer and musician JP Neufeld composed the game's score. According to Watts, this was done because there was [...] "no way I could do music as good as he can." [...] Both the Windows and Xbox 360 version of the game were developed simultaneously. About the Xbox 360 version, Watts commented that [...] "the lack of keyboards and the aging Xbox 360 hardware were a bit tricky, and updating the Xbox version is a huge pain to do." ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the reasons for}} <b>design</b> <b>iteration</b> and describes models of <b>design</b> <b>iteration.</b> Iteration {{is the process of}} repeating tasks within a design project, and is common to all types of engineering <b>design.</b> <b>Iteration</b> is typically necessary for two reasons: an unexpected failure of a design or prototype to meet established criteria; and an expected response to information which was generated after the previous iteration was completed. Both types of iteration are typical of most engineering projects. This paper describes these two types of iteration, and presents two mathematical models which attempt to capture the effects of iteration on total development time. The models are the Probabilistic Sequential Iteration Model, which describes unexpected iteration, and the Work Transformation Model, which describes expected iteration. The two models correspond to the two reasons that iteration occurs in engineering design. They are useful in identifying {{some of the most important}} effects of iteration on development time, and can support important managerial decisions which affect successful completion of the design project in a timely manner...|$|R

500|$|As the {{hardware}} of the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 was more powerful {{compared to the}} prior generation's consoles, the design team was {{able to create a}} more realistic setting than in previous Sonic games. Sonic and Doctor Eggman were redesigned to better suit this updated environment: Sonic was made taller, with longer quills, and Eggman was made slimmer and given a more realistic appearance. At one point, Sonic Team considered giving Sonic realistic fur and rubber textures. Silver the Hedgehog's gameplay style was born out of the desire {{to take advantage of the}} Havok engine's realistic physics capabilities. The first design concept for Silver's character was an orange mink; he attained his final hedgehog look after over fifty <b>design</b> <b>iterations.</b> In designing Shadow's gameplay, the developers abandoned the concept of firearms previously used in Shadow the Hedgehog (2005) in favor of combat elements to differentiate him from the other characters. The game also features several CGI animated cutscenes produced by Blur Studio.|$|E
2500|$|The Gulfstream II is a twin-jet {{swept wing}} {{corporate}} transport powered by two Rolls-Royce Spey turbofan engines {{and designed to}} provide high speed and long range capability without sacrificing the airport performance, reliability, and other operational advantages of its predecessor, the turboprop Gulfstream I. Preliminary design of the wing was influenced by both cruise and low speed considerations. The aft-mounted engine location was selected after extensive analysis and <b>design</b> <b>iterations</b> considering aerodynamic, structural, and ground clearance requirements. Airfoil geometry was developed to maximum sweep benefit from the selected planform. [...] The interference problem at the wing-body juncture was treated by modification of the airfoil shape and thickness over the inner third of the wing span. The basic airfoils for the main area of the wing {{are similar to those}} of the Grumman A-6 Intruder aircraft and utilize NACA 6-series thickness distributions combined with an in-house mean line. A buffet boundary commensurate with the M=.85 speed capability was attained by incorporating a row of co-rotating vortex generators on the outer wing panel. In developing the wing contours, attention was paid to the aircraft's low speed requirements by tailoring the leading edge radius to preclude leading edge separation. The high lift configuration, consists of a one piece, single-slotted Fowler flap of 30% chord. [...] Stall initiation on the basic wing was found to occur at midspan but spread rapidly to the tip, particularly at large flap deflections. The addition of an upper surface fence at about midspan provided a strong pitch down at the stall, without sacrificing maximum lift, and also afforded an adequate margin between initial and tip stall.|$|E

Three branches in the Engineering Directorate and three students were involved in this joint task through the NASA Langley Aerospace Research Summer Scholars (LARSS) Program. The Laser Remote Sensing Branch (LRSB), Mechanical Systems Branch (MSB), and Structural and Thermal Systems Branch (STSB) were engaged to achieve optimal designs through iterative and interactive collaborative design processes. A preliminary <b>design</b> <b>iteration</b> was able to reduce the power consumption, mass, and footprint by removing redundant components and replacing inefficient components with more efficient ones. A second <b>design</b> <b>iteration</b> reduced volume and mass by replacing bulky components with excessive performance with smaller components custom-designed for the power system. The existing power system was analyzed to rank components in terms of inefficiency, power dissipation, footprint and mass. Design considerations and priorities are compared along with the results of each <b>design</b> <b>iteration.</b> Overall power system improvements are summarized for design implementations...|$|R

40|$|As {{companies}} {{compete to}} gain market share, increase profits and affect growth they often turn to concurrent engineering {{in an effort}} to bring new products to the market more quickly. Despite many anecdotal success stories, implementation of concurrent engineering can often prove difficult. As the pressure to bring new products to market increases, companies often compress their <b>design</b> <b>iteration</b> cycle times {{in an effort to}} develop products more quickly. In many cases, design cycles may overlap creating situations where learning opportunities (e. g. through testing) are missed and/or ignored. More perversely, compressing <b>design</b> <b>iteration</b> cycles can cause the creation of "phantom errors" and unnecessary rework as concurrent design activities iterate at different speeds. In this research, I use a system dynamics approach to develop a stylized simulation model of the design-build-test iteration cycle to explore the effects of cycle timing on learning. Specifically, I look at the frequency and timing of integration (build) test events and their effect on new product delivery time, quality, and development cost. This research adds to the existing literature in new product development, concurrent engineering, and system dynamics. Ultimately, the results serve to inform new product development project managers of the implications of <b>design</b> <b>iteration</b> timing on project performance and assist in the scheduling of integration events. by Daniel J.
