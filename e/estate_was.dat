He had huge gambling debts, and although the estate had been valued at £300,000 when he inherited it, he sold off many of the farms {{and other parts of the}} estate to raise funds. Despite these injections of funds, when he died the <b>estate</b> <b>was</b> mortgaged to the extent of £250,000. It was further decimated by his son, George Arthur Ferguson (1835–1924).
