40|$|JU'URING {{the twenty}} {{years in which}} {{electroencephalography}} has been studied {{it has become increasingly}} apparent that, in the opinion of many observers, abnormal cerebral potentials occur more frequently in the rec-ords of patients with psychological disturb-ances than in those of the normal population. A large number of articles on the subject has been published but, since many of the data are empirical, a variety of opinions has been expressed, some of which are in disagreement. There are therefore, at the present time, a number of conflicting impressions as to the significance of the EEG in relation to psycho-logical disorders. Three questions emerge from the confusion: 1. Is there actually a high percentage of abnormal EEG patterns in individuals with primary psychopathology who have no other visible organic disorder of the nervous sys-tem? 2. To what factor or factors might such a difference be <b>due,</b> if <b>it</b> <b>exists?</b> 3. Of what significance, practical or other-wise, is such a difference? The present article will attempt to review existing data in relation to the above ques-tions. There are a number of earlier reviews on the subject, to be quoted later, which are incomplete either because of the early date of their publication or because they have dealt with only one phase of the subject...|$|R
