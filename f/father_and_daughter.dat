5|$|The {{music video}} starts with {{shots of the}} New York skyline, the Staten Island Ferry, and {{character}} close-ups. Madonna plays a teenager, who is seen walking along a lane. Then it shows her thinking about her father, played by Danny Aiello, {{and how much he}} loves her. She then sees her boyfriend, played by actor Alex McArthur, coming along. The images are juxtaposed with shots of Madonna dancing and singing in a small, darkened studio. Madonna then moves away from her friends, who warn her from her boyfriend. She and her boyfriend spend a romantic evening together on a barge where they reflect upon their lives after watching an elderly couple. Then Madonna finds out that she is pregnant and after much hesitation tells her father. They have a few hours of tension between them. Her father eventually accepts the pregnancy, and the final scene is a reconciliatory embrace between <b>father</b> <b>and</b> <b>daughter.</b>|$|E
5|$|A <b>father</b> <b>and</b> <b>daughter</b> rollerblading in Central Park stumble {{across the}} body of a woman with several {{lacerations}} hidden in a bush. Munch (Richard Belzer) and Fin (Ice-T) learn Peter Harrison (Nick Stahl), who was performing community service for a prior crime against a woman, left work early with a cut thumb {{around the time of the}} murder. Stabler (Christopher Meloni) and Benson (Mariska Hargitay) question Harrison, who spouts wild conspiracy theories about the police. During an interrogation, Harrison suggests he killed the woman in Central Park for taking photos of him before his attorney, Julia Zimmer (Kelly Bishop), stops the questioning. Munch and Fin find a bloody knife during a search of Harrison's apartment and forensics technician Ryan O'Halloran (Mike Doyle) confirms the DNA matches the victim, resulting in an open-and-shut case against Harrison. However, Zimmer finds a technical error by forensics technician Dale Stuckey (Noel Fisher) in the evidence paperwork. Though Stuckey insists he made no mistake, Judge Elizabeth Donnelly (Judith Light) is forced to set Harrison free, and makes a harsh rebuke against Stuckey.|$|E

40|$|Family {{businesses}} {{are critical to}} the United States economy, employing 63 % of the workforce and generating 57 % of GDP (University of Vermont, 2014). Family business continuity, however, remains elusive as approximately 70 % of family businesses do not survive the second generation (Poza, 2013). In order to augment {{our understanding of how}} next generation leaders are chosen in family businesses, we examine daughter succession. Using a sample of pairs of family business <b>fathers</b> <b>and</b> <b>daughters</b> <b>and</b> drawing on an earlier study of the dearth of successor daughters in family businesses (Overbeke, Bilimoria, & Perelli, 2013), we reveal that shared vision between <b>fathers</b> <b>and</b> <b>daughters</b> is central to <b>daughter</b> succession. Self-efficacy <b>and</b> gender norms influence shared vision <b>and</b> when <b>fathers</b> <b>and</b> <b>daughters</b> share a vision {{for the future of the}} company, daughters are likely to be transformed into successors...|$|R
