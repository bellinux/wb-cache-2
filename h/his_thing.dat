25|$|Victor von Doom is a polymath and {{scientific}} genius. Throughout {{most of his}} publication history, he has been depicted {{as one of the}} most intelligent humans in the Marvel Universe. This is shown on many occasions, most famously by actually curing Ben Grimm of <b>his</b> <b>Thing</b> form, which Reed Richards has never repeated. On the other hand, Reed Richards managed to process all the computer calculations necessary to save the life of a disintegrating Kitty Pryde by himself, which is a feat that Doom at the time professed to be unable to do.|$|E

I mean, he’s doing <b>his</b> <b>thing.</b> He’s finishing a new record. I’ve got my record coming out, but the principle of us making music together is something, you know.

500|$|The 23-year-old Yannis Alexis Mardas {{first arrived}} in England on a student visa in 1965, befriending John Dunbar of the Indica Gallery in London, and later moving in {{with him in a}} flat on Bentinck Street, which was where Mardas first met Lennon. Known at this time as Yannis Mardas, he found {{employment}} as a television repairman. Dunbar later introduced Mardas to Brian Jones, after Mardas exhibited his Kinetic Light Sculptures at the Indica Gallery. Dunbar worked with Mardas on the “psychedelic light box” for The Rolling Stones' three-week tour of Europe in 1967, although they were not impressed with the results. Dunbar later said: [...] "He was quite cunning in the way he pitched <b>his</b> <b>thing.</b> He knew enough to know how to wind people up and to what extent. He was a fucking TV repairman: Yannis Mardas, none of this 'Magic Alex' shit!" ...|$|E

500|$|Stephen {{was written}} by Kesha Sebert, in {{collaboration}} with her mother Pebe Sebert, David Gamson, and Oliver Leiber. The song was produced by Gamson with additional production by Leiber. Gamson played all the instruments on the song, {{with the exception of}} the accordion which was performed by Kesha. The song's recording was commenced at ACME Recording, Long Island, California, and at Ollywood Studios, Hollywood, California, by Gamson. Kesha told Rolling Stone that Stephen was one of her favorite tracks on the album. She explained that the song stemmed from her experiences with a man that she had been [...] "stalking since [...] was 15." [...] It was written when the singer was sixteen, in collaboration with her mother. She found David Gamson to produce the song. [...] "He does all the keyboard stuff, he's amazing, a crazy cynical genius guy, and he liked my voice and my thing, and I really liked <b>his</b> <b>thing,</b> so we decided to work together" [...] she explained.|$|E
500|$|The {{general rule}} was that anyone with an {{interest}} in the safety of the thing stolen may sue. It could be that the owner did not have a sufficient interest to bring an action. If one person had a positive right in a thing, such as a pledgee, usufructory, or good faith possessor, both he and the owner could sue. The unsecured creditor could not. Those obliged by contract to return the thing, and other forms of [...] "negative interest", had an action available at the expense of owner. This was only true so long as the person obliged was solvent [...] that is, under a real risk of losing out by a theft. If the person obliged was insolvent, the owner would have an action instead. The plaintiff with a negative interest was precluded from an action if it was by his own fault (dolus), or other dishonest. The lower standard of care required of a depositee meant he could not be sued by a depositor, and so had no action available for furtum. A vendor, who had agreed a price but not delivered <b>his</b> <b>thing,</b> retained legal ownership of the thing. Thus if the thing was stolen, the vendor had the action on the theft because he was liable to the purchaser.|$|E
500|$|Several {{songs on}} New York Dolls {{function}} as what Robert Hilburn deemed [...] "colorful, if exaggerated, expressions of teen alienation". Robert Christgau remarked that {{because many of}} Manhattan's white youths were wealthy and somewhat artsy, only ill-behaved young people from the outer boroughs such as the band members could [...] "capture the oppressive excitement Manhattan holds for a half-formed human being". [...] "Private World", an escapist plea for stability, was co-written by Kane, who rarely contributed as a songwriter and felt overwhelmed as a young adult in the music business. Johansen, the band's main lyricist, said [...] "Frankenstein (Orig.)" [...] was about [...] "how kids come to Manhattan from all over, they're kind of like whipped dogs, they're very repressed. Their bodies and brains are disoriented from each other... it's a love song." [...] According to critic Frank Kogan, the titular monster in the song was the personification of New York City and its ethos—"the ostentation and the terror, the dreams and the fear"—while Johansen asking listeners if they [...] "could make it with Frankenstein" [...] involved more than sexual slang: [...] "David was asking if you—if I—could make it with the monster of life, whether I could embrace life in all its pain and dreams and disaster." [...] Sylvain jokingly said [...] "Frankenstein (Orig.)" [...] was titled with a qualifier because rock musician Edgar Winter had released his 1973 song {{of the same name}} before the band could record their own: [...] "Our song 'Frankenstein' was a big hit in our live show... Now, <b>his</b> <b>thing</b> didn't sound at all like ours, but I'm sure he stole our title." ...|$|E

500|$|While Carey paved {{a lot of}} {{the album}} with slower and autobiographical ballads, she also {{attempted}} at making an album with a mixture of several different genres. According to Jon Pareles of The New York Times, the album showed off Carey's musical and vocal versatility, especially when viewing the differences in the record's first and second singles, [...] "Ms. Carey is known for her voice, of course: she can hit high notes that barely sound human, and few singers leap around the octaves as gracefully as she does. But as she tries to regain her audience, her greatest weapon may be her versatility: Ms. Carey also knows how to make a hip-hop hit by holding back and letting the beat shine." [...] Carey decided to work with Just Blaze after she heard the song [...] "Oh Boy" [...] he had produced for Cam'ron. Together they produced [...] "Boy (I Need You)", a remake of [...] "Oh Boy", and [...] "You Got Me". Carey described the former as one of her favorites on the album. [...] "It's definitely one of my favorites, 'cause I love the original. It was cool to have him out there doing <b>his</b> <b>thing</b> in such a random environment," [...] she said.

I {{want to create a}} director's role within music, which is what I tried to do on this album (St. Elsewhere)...

2500|$|On December 16, 2013, Newsted {{expanded}} upon previous statements {{regarding his}} departure from Metallica and cited that his project with Echobrain was being discouraged by James Hetfield because Metallica's management at Q Prime {{wanted to go}} ahead with promoting Echobrain but was forced to drop it by Hetfield's demands with the quote [...] "other arrangements can be made". Jason was sure that Echobrain would not affect Metallica as it was the pedigree that it already needed. Newsted continues, “And so they had told me, pretty convincingly, ‘This is a great record, we’ve been playing it around the office, that’s all I’ve been hearing, it’s fantastic, this kid has a great voice. Let’s do something with this.’ That’s what they told me, and then James Hetfield heard about it and was not happy. He was, I think, pretty much out to put the kibosh on the whole thing because it would somehow affect Metallica in his eyes, because now the managers were interested in something I was doing {{that had nothing to do}} with him. ”The bassist sums up the situation as follows: “I have no idea what [...] was thinking, other than just protecting what he valued, just like he does; that's <b>his</b> <b>thing.</b> He protects what he loves, squeezes it too hard, like he said himself. Squeeze it too hard, protecting it too much. That's where I was coming from. The people that I had counted on for 15 years to help me with my career, help Metallica, take care of my money, do all of those things, told me, 'Your new project is fantastic, we'd like to help you with it.'

yellow houses and the rosegardens and the jessamine and geraniums and cactuses and Gibraltar as a girl where I was a Flower of the mountain yes when I put the rose in my hair like the Andalusian girls used or shall I wear a red yes and how he kissed me under the Moorish wall and I thought well as well him as another and then I asked him with my eyes to ask again yes and then he asked me would I yes to say yes my mountain flower and first I put my arms around him yes and drew him down to me so he could feel my breasts all perfume yes and his heart was going like mad and yes I said yes I will Yes.|$|E
