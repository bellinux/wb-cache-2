40|$|Abstract — This paper {{investigates the}} effect of <b>grounding</b> <b>posts</b> when printed circuit boards are mounted near and {{parallel}} to a metal plate or chassis. Specifically, experimental data showing changes in radiated emission levels are explained by means of coupling phenomena between a power bus, a chassis cavity including <b>grounding</b> <b>posts,</b> and a cable connected to the power bus. This coupling is modeled using SPICE {{and the results are}} combined with an equivalent magnetic current source model to estimate the radiated emissions from various printed circuit board configurations. The calculated results are shown to be consistent with the corresponding experimental data.

40|$|This {{document}} {{presents the}} developed work performed, under HEMAV company support, {{focused on the}} creation of a new UAV platform. So, the main problem suffered by drone related companies is the flight autonomy of the multi rotored platforms. Though they are able to carry heavy loads and perform stationary flights, they own more rotors on board in front of other aircrafts which suppose a higher power consumption which, as consequence, produce a notable flight time reduction that affect services as high areas mapping. One of the main purposes of this project has been the proper design, building, testing and optimizing of a new low cost fixed wing UAV platform which will be used of high terrains mapping as well as for precision agriculture issues. So, the creation of this UAV platform has been optimally achieved and it is to fly over 28 minutes at 15 m/s cruise speed and, is also able to scan a wide area up to 100 ha with three different configurations as function of the onboard sensors. On the other hand, the second working line of this project has been the design, selection, test and integration in the designed drone of a new RTK low cost system. It has been achieved its optimal functioning in HEMAV multi rotored UAV at real time data processing. Then, it has been integrated on the designed drone and it has been achieved an optimal performance in <b>ground</b> <b>post</b> processing phase. These means during the flight, as the aircraft flies faster than multi rotors, the RTK system is not prepared to work at these speeds. However, as the main purpose of this working line is to set these modems totally operative for terrain mapping purposes, it is considered the main objectives here have been successfully achieved as this processing must be done after flight. Finally, in this document has also been performed the required documents a Spanish RPAS operator needs to certify a drone for commercial purposes as stipulated in current Spanish normative, the Real Decreto 8 / 2014 Art 50. Eventually, it must be said all requirements and objectives stipulated by HEMAV company and the project authors have been successfully achieve in the way a new quality, low cost and accurate tool has been developed for commercial agriculture and mapping purposes with the possibility to integer a RTK system which will give the positioning GPS coordinates with an accuracy of cm...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — This paper {{describes}} the SPICE modeling of multiple plane structures where the inner layers planes have different shapes than the outer layer planes. These structures are {{often seen in}} {{a printed circuit board}} (PCB), or the space between a PCB and metal chassis. First, a SPICE model is proposed for these structures using 2 -dimensional ladder networks and ideal transformers. Next, the model is expanded to structures including vertical connecting conductors, such as vias in a PCB and <b>grounding</b> <b>posts</b> connecting a PCB to a metal chassis. Coupling properties inside a PCB are calculated using the SPICE model and shown to be consistent with experimental data. Furthermore, radiated emissions from a PCB-chassis system are also calculated based on the SPICE and equivalent magnetic current source models. The results are consistent with experimental data to show the changes in radiated EMI due to the locations of <b>grounding</b> <b>posts.</b> Keywords-component; SPICE models; multiple planes; 2 -dimensional ladder network; ideal transformer; powr bus resonance; chassis connections; grounding postrs; equivalent magnetic current source; radiated EMI from PCBs I...|$|R

50|$|Often being {{positioned}} in secret {{very close to}} the enemy, an observation post is usually a small construct, often consisting largely of camouflage materials and possibly weather cover.
