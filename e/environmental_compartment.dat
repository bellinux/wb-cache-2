40|$|Abstract. Among {{the heavy}} metals, mercury {{is one of}} the most studied {{environmental}} pollutants. This is largely due to its toxicity and its high mobility in the environment. Due to the ability to travel over long distances in the atmosphere as gaseous elemental species, far from the point emission source, mercury is regarded as a ‘global pollutant’. The maximum toxicity of mercury is given by its methylated form, methylmercury. The main pathway of contamination of the humans with mercury is the food chain, where the most toxic species, methylmercury, bioaccumulates. This species is widely recognized as a neurotoxin affecting humans. Since it is recognized that not only the total concentration of mercury in an <b>environmental</b> <b>compartment</b> but its chemical forms determine the toxicity/essentiality and bioavailability, there is growing need in developing analytical methods able to distinguish among its species. 1...|$|E
40|$|Annually, {{the global}} {{environment}} receives enormous amounts of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) that include polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), in addition to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Their ubiquity has made them identifiable contaminants in almost every <b>environmental</b> <b>compartment</b> of the global system. In particular, aquatic systems have been adversely affected by these pollutants. Therefore, effective monitoring, both in ground and surface water, that can reliably assess their environmental impacts is required. Passive samplers have been proposed as suitable options to the traditional grab/spot/bottle sampling approach because they simultaneously sample, isolate and enrich target analytes. Moreover, apart from successfully detecting very low water dissolved analyte concentrations (trace and sub-trace levels), the devices can also provide time weighted average (TWA) concentrations that take into account episodic events. This is usually not practical with other sampling techniques...|$|E

Significant correlations of metal concentrations were found between tree leaves and the smallest (< 50 μm) fraction of road dust, and between soil dust (50 - 100 μm) and surface soils, suggesting that trace metals in these samples may influence each other.

40|$|Estimating {{antibiotic}} pollution and antibiotic resistance development risks in <b>environmental</b> <b>compartments</b> {{is important to}} design management strategies that advance our stewardship of antibiotics. In this study we propose a modelling approach to estimate the risk of antibiotic resistance development in <b>environmental</b> <b>compartments</b> and demonstrate its application in aquaculture production systems. We modelled exposure concentrations for 12 antibiotics used in Vietnamese Pangasius catfish production using the ERA-AQUA model. Minimum selective concentration (MSC) distributions that characterize the selective pressure of antibiotics on bacterial communities were derived from the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) Minimum Inhibitory Concentration dataset. The antibiotic resistance development risk (RDR) for each antibiotic was calculated as {{the probability that the}} antibiotic exposure distribution exceeds the MSC distribution representing the bacterial community. RDRs in pond sediments were nearly 100 % for all antibiotics. Median RDR values in pond water were high {{for the majority of the}} antibiotics, with rifampicin, levofloxacin and ampicillin having highest values. In the effluent mixing area, RDRs were low for most antibiotics, with the exception of amoxicillin, ampicillin and trimethoprim, which presented moderate risks, and rifampicin and levofloxacin, which presented high risks. The RDR provides an efficient means to benchmark multiple antibiotics and treatment regimes in the initial phase of a risk assessment with regards to their potential to develop resistance in different <b>environmental</b> <b>compartments,</b> and can be used to derive resistance threshold concentrations...|$|R

30|$|Since {{pesticides}} {{are designed}} to be toxic to at least some groups of organisms, the criterion for assessment of toxicity is likely to capture all pesticides. Therefore, classification of PPPs as PBTs under this scheme is primarily driven by the P and B. The trigger for classification as T (Table 2) is ‘Chronic NOEC < 0.01 mg/L or is a carcinogen, mutagen, or toxic for reproduction, or other evidence of toxicity.’ The NOEC trigger is strictly for aquatic organisms, which will bias classification of insecticides as T because they are usually equally or more toxic to crustaceans than they are to insects. Few PPPs are deliberately applied to water, so fate and movement in the environment are important drivers of concentrations in water, yet these factors are not considered in classification. Finally, there is no consideration of toxicity for terrestrial species, {{despite the fact that it}} is to this <b>environmental</b> <b>compartment</b> that most pesticides are routinely applied.|$|E

Therefore, for analysis of these compounds and their metabolites, we have developed a high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) based method. Results The extraction of PCNB and HCB from soil and minimal salt medium was carried out with ethyl acetate and hexane respectively with good recoveries (98 % for PCNB and 97 % for HCB). The validation of the proposed extraction and HPLC method was done by analysis of PCNB and HCB biodegradation and their metabolites identification from anaerobic enriched soil samples. Conclusion A rapid, sensitive and simple HPLC based analytical method was developed for the analysis of PCNB, HCB and their possible intermediates. </p...|$|E

40|$|In {{this report}} a risk {{assessment}} or evaluation system for agricultural pesticides is presented, which estimates the hazards for man and environment resulting {{from the use of}} these pesticides. The evaluation system has also been placed {{within the context of the}} Uniform System for the Evaluation of Substances (USES). The evaluation system for pesticides (ESPE) is divided in three parts: 1) emission of the pesticide; 2) distribution over and within the different <b>environmental</b> <b>compartments</b> and calculation of exposure concentrations of organisms to the pesticide; 3) hazard assessment. The mathematical descriptions of various parts of the assessment system for agricultural pesticides are presented in this report. In the first part, an estimation is made of the percentages of emission of the used dosage for the several <b>environmental</b> <b>compartments.</b> In the distribution part, the different transport and translation processes are assessed. This leads to Predicted (Initial) Environmental Concentrations (P(I) ECs) for the different <b>environmental</b> <b>compartments</b> and to transport fluxes between these compartments. In the third part, hazard assessment is carried out by comparing P(I) ECs with chronic or acute toxicity data (e. g. NOECs,L(E) C 50 s) for several non-target organisms. For the environmental hazard assessment decision trees, developed by the Support Group Environment of the CTB, are used. For human beings, in this system only consumers, no decision trees have been developed.
