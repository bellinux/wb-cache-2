5000|$|Integrated {{circuits}} (of the <b>analogue</b> and <b>digital</b> <b>type)</b> gradually {{took over}} all of the functions that the Compactron was designed for. [...] "Hybrid" [...] television sets produced {{in the early to}} mid-1970s made use of a combination of tubes (typically Compactrons), transistors, and integrated circuits in the same set. By the mid-1980s this type of tube was functionally obsolete. Compactrons simply don't exist in any TV sets designed after 1986. Other specialist uses of the tube declined in parallel with the television set manufacture. Manufacture of Compactrons ceased in the early 1990s. New old stock replacements for almost all Compactron types produced are easily found for sale on the Internet.|$|R

Tachograph heads are of either <b>analogue</b> or <b>digital</b> <b>types.</b> All relevant vehicles manufactured in the EU since 1 May 2006 must be fitted with digital tachograph heads. The recording medium for analogue heads are wax coated paper discs, and for digital heads there are two recording mediums: internal memory (which can be read out with one {{of a variety of}} download devices into a so-called [...]ddd file) and digital driver cards containing a microchip with flash memory. Digital driver cards store data in a format that can later also be read out as a [...]ddd file. These files - both those read from internal memory with a download device, and those read from the driver cards - can be imported into tachograph analysis/archival software.|$|R

40|$|A new {{transformation}} {{involving the}} error function erf(z), the imaginary error function erfi(z), and an <b>integral</b> <b>analogue</b> of a partial theta function is given {{along with its}} character analogues. Another complementary error function transformation is also obtained which when combined with the first explains a transformation in Ramanujan's Lost Notebook termed by Berndt and Xu as the one for an <b>integral</b> <b>analogue</b> of theta functions. These transformations are used to obtain a variety of exact and approximate evaluations of some non-elementary integrals involving hypergeometric functions. Several asymptotic expansions, including the one for a non-elementary integral involving {{a product of the}} Riemann Ξ-function of two different arguments, are obtained, which generalize known results due to Berndt and Evans, and Oloa.

The proposed neural network contains one neuron array and one axon array. Spike Timing Dependent Delay Plasticity is used to fine-tune delays and add dynamics to the network. In our mixed-signal implementation, the neurons and axons have been implemented as both <b>analogue</b> and <b>digital</b> circuits. The system thus consists of one FPGA, containing the digital neuron array and the digital axon array, and one analogue IC containing the analogue neuron array and the analogue axon array. The system can be easily configured to use different combinations of each. We present and discuss the experimental results of all combinations of the <b>analogue</b> and <b>digital</b> axon arrays and the <b>analogue</b> and <b>digital</b> neuron arrays. The test {{results show that the}} proposed neural network is capable of successfully recalling more than 85 % of stored patterns using both <b>analogue</b> and <b>digital</b> circuits...|$|R
