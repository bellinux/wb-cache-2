500|$|En Esch, {{one of the}} {{longtime}} core members of KMFDM, had almost {{nothing to do with}} Xtort, contributing to just two songs. With regard to Esch's lack of participation, Konietzko said, [...] "En Esch is just En Esch. He never made himself available to do this album, and so it's always my belief that the thing must keep moving; <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it without him." [...] He also said the two were not in communication {{around the time of the}} album's release.|$|E
500|$|Relegation changed Gunn's {{mind about}} taking the Norwich job.

And I was." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{majority}} of Lombard's appearances with Fox were bit parts in low-budget Westerns and adventure films. She later commented on her dissatisfaction with these roles: [...] "All <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> was simper prettily at the hero and scream with terror when he battled with the villain." [...] She fully enjoyed the {{other aspects of}} film work, however, such as photo shoots, costume fittings, and socializing with actors on the studio set. Lombard embraced the flapper lifestyle and became a regular at the Coconut Grove nightclub, where she won several Charleston dance competitions.|$|E

500|$|Despite her {{interest}} in acting from an early age, Pinto was undecided on which career path to take until watching Monster (2003) while at college. She stated: [...] "I guess it was when I watched Monster... I pretty much knew.

[...] In 2005, Pinto began a modeling career and joined Elite Model Management India, with whom she worked {{for two and a half}} years. She was featured in several television and print advertisements for products such as Wrigley's Chewing Gum, Škoda, Vodafone India, Airtel, Visa, eBay, and De Beers.|$|E

She commented that [...] "what <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> was heavy, more than daring, strong, I accepted because Arjona is of the stars on the musical market, whoever likes it or not."

500|$|... "Warner Bros. Records is a {{hierarchy}} of old men and it's a chauvinist environment {{to be working in}} because I'm treated like this sexy little girl. I had to prove them wrong, which meant not only proving myself to my fans but to my record company as well. That is something that happens when you're a girl. It wouldn't happen to Prince or Michael Jackson. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> everything on my own and it was hard trying to convince people that I was worth a record deal. After that, I had the same problem trying to convince the record company that I had more to offer than a one-shot singer. I had to win this fight." ...|$|E

500|$|David Duchovny was {{somewhat}} {{disappointed with the}} episode, hoping {{he would have had}} a chance to do more in an episode that was primarily a symbolic journey for him rather than a real one. The actor said [...] "I like the psychology, and I like the thinking that went into the episode as a viewer. As an actor, I felt like an opportunity passed me by. If <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> any episode over again, it would be that one." [...] The actor called the episode in 1995 the greatest missed opportunity they had. Chris Carter disagreed, stating that Fox Mulder's role in the episode was the right way to do it, and that the dramatic weight for the episode had to shift from Mulder to Dana Scully.|$|E
500|$|I {{would say}} it was a directorial {{collaborative}} effort. We went to the rainforest and that was interesting. Part of the reason was [...] I love Puerto Rico one of my favorite places ever and I did one of my favorite videos, 'Honey', in Puerto Rico at the El Conquistador hotel. I was involved every step of the way... I like a lot of the shots in the video... There was a moment where <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> an additional water sequence with no director, just myself and a camera man with an underwater camera. I was looking at the take at 5 in the morning, [...] ready to kill me. But if we didn't have those shots there wouldn't be anything to cut away to, except me.|$|E
500|$|Malawi's economy while Banda was {{president}} was {{often cited as}} an example of how a poor, landlocked, heavily populated, mineral-poor country could achieve progress in both agriculture and industrial development. While in office, and using his control of the country, Banda constructed a business empire that eventually produced one-third of the country's GDP and employed 10% of the wage-earning workforce. All money earned by Banda was ploughed back into developing Malawi and was symbolised by the building of a top boarding school called Kamuzu Academy (Eton of Africa). In Banda's own words [...] "I do not want my boys and girls to do what <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> — to leave their homes and their families and go away from Malawi to get an education", was the reason for gifting this school to Malawi.|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} was co-directed by Ray Kay and Beyoncé for the B'Day Anthology Video Album, which was {{released}} the same month: {{it was one}} of eight videos shot in two weeks for the album. The choreography was done by Danielle Polanco and Jonte' Moaning, who used a 1980s retro set. Beyoncé explained the concept of the video at MTV: [...] "It's probably the most flamboyant video, and the metallic dresses are so beautiful, they added so much color. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> a video for this song. Everyone wanted to know what a 'freakum dress' was, and you can't really explain it, you have to see it. Everyone has their own version, so we had so many women — of different races, sizes, shapes, ages — because we all have those dresses we pull out when we need to shut it down." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Digital Spy, Gray said of her character's persona: I never {{wanted her to be}} boring. She was never boring before–she started out kind of boring, but I think that's the kiss of death because people will expect her to be interesting. By interesting, that doesn't mean she's drunk. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> a lot of thinking about what we would do with her. Where would she be now? I did a lot of homework finding out where she would be and what Texas women are like now. What has she gone through in her life? What has she come to grips with? What does she like about herself? What doesn't she like about herself? What kind of impact is she going to make on her life, on John Ross's life, on her future? Who is she? ...|$|E

He said of her in 1968 that she was [...] "a walking encyclopedia. All through her life she stored up knowledge on all sorts of subjects, {{and she had the}} great gift of being able to make it all interesting when she taught it to me. She was completely methodical; we had time-tables for each subject, and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> preparation, and so forth. She taught me to enjoy working hard, and to be thorough. She was outspoken and open-minded to a degree quite unusual in members of the Royal Family. And she was also entirely free from prejudice about politics or colour and things of that kind." ...|$|E

500|$|For {{her fourth}} album, The House (2010), Melua worked with {{producer}} William Orbit. She {{said about the}} experience: [...] "The whole thing has been really exciting. It was the same feeling I had the first time I went skydiving. I was really quite nervous, but I knew all <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> was let myself go and {{it was going to}} feel amazing. I wasn't {{trying to get away from}} anything. It was more about going towards something. I wanted the music to be inspired by the future, something unknown that's never been heard before, but at the same time hold on to the values of the music of the past, to try and tap into something that's so ancient and old that it's kind of forgotten. I thought that, if we went far enough in both directions, we could end up in the same place".|$|E
500|$|Ramsey joined Ipswich {{just after}} the club's relegation from the Second Division {{at the end of}} the 1954–55 season, the team's only year above the third tier up to that point. To quote McKinstry, Ipswich had neither [...] "glittering {{pedigree}} or status" [...] nor [...] "strong footballing tradition"—the club had joined the Football League only in 1938, and its home ground at Portman Road was small and basic. One of the team's advantages was the patronage of the aristocratic Cobbold brewing family, to which the chairman and much of the club hierarchy belonged. [...] "I had no plan for Ipswich when I went there," [...] Ramsey later said. [...] "In fact the first thing <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> was to forget my set ideas on how football ought to be played. My experience had been in the First Division. I soon found that what I faced at Ipswich was very different." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Quite a lot, but in {{the sense}} in my {{preparation}} to find the Walter {{that we all know}} now, I {{had to go back to}} him right at the beginning to see where he came from. So that process was started before the pilot really, what was this man like before he deteriorated, so I was able to revisit that. Physically, of course, what <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> was capture the energy, to capture the physicality of the man, the vocal physicality of the man, this was my task. I was aided enormously by my hair and makeup and special effects people here in terms of getting the overall, and indeed wardrobe helped a lot as well. And then we, the shot up through these beautiful lenses that we got a different feel to the episode than we would now. All of those elements work together... to create this version that you see in the episode." ...|$|E
