During the fall 2007 semester, a content analysis of articles from Kansas newspapers and for comparison, newspaper articles from throughout the United States was conducted using the constant comparative method [4].

Basic ethical issues related to obesity in children are: the need for medical teams to communicate with {{patients and their families}} (following the rules of professional ethics) to prevent obesity, to diagnose and treat the basic disease (in secondary obesity) and to choose the most effective management approach when obesity is installed; another aspect is represented by patients and parents education, information and counselling by the <b>doctor</b> <b>and</b> <b>nutritionist,</b> supporting patients in self monitoring their diet and weight, providing positive psychological support, implementing strategies for lifestyle changing, by an individualized approach, respecting children's rights in each case; regarding drug therapy, most of preparations are {{still in the process of}} evaluation or in experimental stages. A key aspect is the interaction with parents: it is necessary to inform, advise and support them and, in extreme situations, forfeiture of parental rights by judicial decision. If we cannot interfere on the genetic side and we cannot influence psychosocial stress or cultural trends, we could model other environmental factors with demonstrated involvement in the development of obesity, by initiating and supporting policies to prevent overweight; involving the media in health promotion programs can help educate and inform the population.
