25|$|A {{carbon sink}} {{is a natural}} or {{artificial}} reservoir that accumulates and stores some carbon-containing chemical compound for an indefinite period, such as a growing forest. A negative carbon dioxide emission {{on the other hand}} is a permanent removal of carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere. Examples are direct air capture, enhanced weathering technologies such as storing it in geologic formations underground and biochar. These processes are sometimes considered as variations of sinks or mitigation, and sometimes as geoengineering. In combination with other mitigation measures, sinks in combination with negative carbon emissions are considered crucial <b>for</b> <b>meeting</b> <b>the</b> 350 ppm target.|$|E
25|$|The 2004 Games {{were judged}} a success, as both {{security}} and organization worked well, {{and only a}} few visitors reported minor problems mainly concerning accommodation issues. The 2004 Olympic Games were described as Unforgettable, dream Games, by IOC President Jacques Rogge for their return to the birthplace of the Olympics, and <b>for</b> <b>meeting</b> <b>the</b> challenges of holding the Olympic Games. The only observable problem was a somewhat sparse attendance of some early events. Eventually, however, a total of more than 3.5million tickets were sold, which was higher than any other Olympics with the exception of Sydney (more than 5million tickets were sold there in 2000).|$|E
25|$|Human {{security}} can {{be defined}} as one of the foundational conditions of being human, including both (1) the sustainable protection and provision of the material conditions <b>for</b> <b>meeting</b> <b>the</b> embodied needs of people, and (2) the protection of the variable existential conditions for maintaining a dignified life. Within this definition it then makes sense that the core focus of human-security endeavours should be on the most vulnerable. It makes sense that risk management should be most responsive to immediate events or processes that have both an extensive and intensive impact in producing material and existential vulnerabilities of people in general or a category of persons across a particular locale.|$|E

25|$|According to a {{study by}} the International Organization for Migration, 20% of Egyptian remittance-receiving {{households}} interviewed channelled the remittances towards various forms of investment, while the large majority (80%) was more concerned about utilizing remittances <b>for</b> <b>meeting</b> <b>the</b> daily needs of their families including spending on health care and education. Among the 20% of households that decided to invest, 39% invested in real estate, 22% invested in small businesses employing fewer than five people and the smallest proportions of investors (6%) invested in medium private business employing no more than 20 people. According to Egypt's Human Development Report 2008, despite representing approximately 5% of GDP, remittances provided the initial capital for only 1.4% of newly established small and medium enterprises in Egypt in 2003-2004.|$|E
25|$|The {{property}} {{sector has}} expanded twenty-threefold since 2001, particularly in metropolises like Lahore. Nevertheless, the Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry estimated in late 2006 {{that the overall}} production of housing units in Pakistan has to be increased to 0.5 million units annually to address 6.1 million backlog of housing in Pakistan <b>for</b> <b>meeting</b> <b>the</b> housing shortfall in next 20 years. The report noted that the present housing stock is also rapidly aging and an estimate suggests that more than 50% of stock is over 50 years old. It is also estimated that 50% of the urban population now lives in slums and squatter settlements. The report said that meeting the backlog in housing, besides replacement of out-lived housing units, is beyond the financial resources of the government. This necessitates putting in place a framework to facilitate financing in the formal private sector and mobilise non-government resources for a market-based housing finance system.|$|E

500|$|After several {{visits to}} the Auca village, which the missionaries called [...] "Terminal City", they {{observed}} that the Huaorani seemed excited to receive their gifts. Encouraged, they began using a loudspeaker to shout simple Huaorani phrases as they circled. After several more drops, in November the Huaorani began tying gifts for the missionaries to the line after removing the gifts the missionaries gave them. The men took this {{as a gesture of}} friendliness and developed plans <b>for</b> <b>meeting</b> <b>the</b> Huaorani on the ground. Saint soon identified a 200-yard (200m) sandbar along the Curaray River about 4.5miles (7km) from Terminal City that could serve as a runway and camp site, and dubbed it [...] "Palm Beach".|$|E
500|$|Appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath on 30April 1954 for {{his service}} in Malaya, Scherger joined the Air Board as Air Member for Personnel in March 1955.

This led to a policy of cadets undertaking academic degrees, in line with similar institutions in the other armed services; the College was subsequently renamed RAAF Academy. Promoted air marshal, he became Chief of the Air Staff in March 1957, succeeding Air Marshal Sir John McCauley. Long identified as a strong contender for the RAAF's senior role, Scherger was described by Air Marshal Hardman as [...] "easily the best material on offer". He declared that as an administrator he was [...] "not going to allow myself to be bogged down with minor matters of detail...Broad policy comes from the top. These decisions have to be implemented in the commands—and that's the way it's going to be." ...|$|E

500|$|Like other mosques in Northern Region of Ghana, Larabanga Mosque {{is built}} in the {{traditional}} Sudanic-Sahelian architectural style, using local materials and construction techniques. The mosque is built with mud and reeds, and measures about [...] by [...] It has two towers in pyramidal shape, one for the mihrab which faces towards Mecca forming the facade on {{the east and the}} other as a minaret in the northeast corner. In addition, 12 buttresses of conical shape on the external walls are strengthened by horizontally-aligned timber elements. The architectural style is also known as [...] "flat-footed adobe architecture". [...] All the structures are given a white wash. [...] The mosque has an old Quran, believed by the locals to have been given as a gift from heaven in 1650 to Bramah, the Imam at the time, {{as a result of his}} prayers.

500|$|Critics of {{the bill}} argued that the {{deadline}} <b>for</b> <b>meeting</b> <b>the</b> standards was unnecessarily delayed until 2006—a period of 12years—to enforce better water quality. They also maintained {{that it did not}} force sugarcane farmers, who were the primary polluters, to pay enough of the costs, and increased the threshold of what was an acceptable amount of phosphorus in water from 10ppb to 50ppb. Governor Chiles initially named it the Marjory Stoneman Douglas Act, but Douglas was so unimpressed with the action it took against polluters that she wrote to Chiles and demanded her name be stricken from it. Despite criticism, the Florida legislature passed the Act in 1994. The SFWMD stated that its actions have exceeded expectations earlier than anticipated, by creating Stormwater Treatment Areas (STA) within the EAA that [...] contain a calcium-based substance such as lime rock layered between peat, and filled with calcareous periphyton. Early tests by the Army Corps of Engineers revealed this method reduced phosphorus levels from 80ppb to 10ppb. The STAs are intended to treat water until the phosphorus levels are low enough to be released into the Loxahatchee National Wildlife Refuge or other WCAs.|$|E
500|$|As AOC Training Command, McLachlan {{undertook}} two reviews {{that would}} have, {{according to the}} official history of the post-war RAAF, [...] "a {{significant effect on the}} Air Force of the 1960s". In 1957, at the instigation of the Air Member for Personnel, Air Vice Marshal Frederick Scherger, McLachlan formed a committee to review the effectiveness of the syllabus at RAAF College <b>for</b> <b>meeting</b> <b>the</b> future needs of the Air Force in an age of guided missiles and nuclear weaponry. This led to a policy of cadets undertaking academic degrees, in line with similar institutions in the other armed services; the college was subsequently renamed RAAF Academy. The official history of the RAAF considered the result to be only partially successful; while it turned out highly educated officers, they were educated solely in a rigid scientific discipline suited to an Air Force that never came into existence, one relying on missiles rather than manned aircraft. In 1959, McLachlan chaired a committee to review the change in the RAAF's command structure that had taken place in 1953–54, from a geographically based [...] "area" [...] system to a functional system consisting of Home, Maintenance Command, and Training Commands. Concluding that this had reduced duplication and improved efficiency, he proposed further rationalisation by amalgamating Training and Maintenance Commands to form a new organisation, Support Command. His plan was duly implemented, as was his recommendation that Home Command, responsible for air operations, be renamed Operational Command.|$|E

500|$|Scott {{had hoped}} {{on his return}} to find Discovery free from the ice, but she {{remained}} held fast. Work had begun with ice saws, but after 12days' labour only two short parallel cuts of [...] had been carved, with the ship still [...] from open water. On 5 January 1904 the relief ship Morning returned, {{this time with a}} second ship, the Terra Nova. Colbeck was carrying firm instructions from the Admiralty that, if Discovery could not be freed by a certain date she was to be abandoned and her complement brought home on the two relief ships. This ultimatum resulted from Markham's dependence on the Treasury <b>for</b> <b>meeting</b> <b>the</b> costs of this second relief expedition, since the expedition's coffers were empty. The Admiralty would foot the bill only on their own terms. The deadline agreed between the three captains was 25 February, and it became a race against time for the relief vessels to reach Discovery, still held fast at Hut Point. As a precaution Scott began the transfer of his scientific specimens to the other ships. Explosives were used to break up the ice, and the sawing parties resumed work, but although the relief ships were able to edge closer, by the end of January Discovery remained icebound, two miles (approx. 3km) from the rescuers. On 10 February Scott accepted {{that he would have to}} abandon her, but on 14 February most of the ice suddenly broke up, and Morning and Terra Nova were at last able to sail alongside Discovery. A final explosive charge removed the remaining ice on 16 February, and the following day, after a last scare when she became temporarily grounded on a shoal, Discovery began the return journey to New Zealand.|$|E
