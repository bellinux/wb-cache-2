5|$|The {{power station}} is {{regulated}} by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), under the <b>Federal</b> <b>Power</b> Act, with the current license issued in 1992 and set to expire in 2022. The first license was granted by the FERC's predecessor, the <b>Federal</b> <b>Power</b> Commission in 1939. When the reservoir's elevation exceeds , control of the dam's discharges are transferred to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) who manage flood control in the larger basin. By federal regulation, the GRDA and the Corps of Engineers often coordinate discharges and reservoir levels.|$|E
5|$|Following the Union {{victory in}} 1865, three {{amendments}} {{were added to}} the U.S. Constitution: the Thirteenth Amendment prohibited slavery, the Fourteenth Amendment provided citizenship to the nearly four million African Americans who had been slaves, and the Fifteenth Amendment ensured that they had the right to vote. The war and its resolution led to a substantial increase in <b>federal</b> <b>power</b> aimed at reintegrating and rebuilding the Southern states while ensuring the rights of the newly freed slaves.|$|E
5|$|Tyler's {{governorship}} {{was otherwise}} uneventful. He promoted states' rights and adamantly opposed any concentration of <b>federal</b> <b>power.</b> In order to thwart federal infrastructure proposals, he suggested Virginia actively expand its own road system. A proposal {{was made to}} expand the state's poorly funded public school system, but no significant action was taken. Tyler was re-elected unanimously to a second one-year term in December 1826.|$|E

5|$|Born in Philadelphia to {{a family}} active in Whig {{politics}}, Randall shifted to the Democratic Party after the Whigs' demise. His rise in politics began in the 1850s with election to the Philadelphia Common Council {{and then to the}} Pennsylvania State Senate. Randall served in a Union cavalry unit in the American Civil War before winning a seat in the federal House of Representatives in 1862. He was reelected every two years thereafter until his death. The representative of an industrial region, Randall became known as a staunch defender of protective tariffs designed to assist domestic producers of manufactured goods. While often siding with Republicans on tariff issues, he differed with them in his resistance to Reconstruction and the growth of <b>federal</b> <b>power.</b>|$|E
5|$|Cleveland, like {{a growing}} number of Northerners (and nearly all white Southerners) saw Reconstruction as a failed experiment, and was {{reluctant}} to use <b>federal</b> <b>power</b> to enforce the 15th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which guaranteed voting rights to African Americans. Though Cleveland appointed no black Americans to patronage jobs, he allowed Frederick Douglass to continue in his post as recorder of deeds in Washington, D.C. and appointed another black man (James Campbell Matthews, a former New York judge) to replace Douglass upon his resignation. His decision to replace Douglass with a black man was met with outrage, but Cleveland claimed to have known Matthews personally.|$|E
5|$|Ethnocentrism, tribalism, {{religious}} persecution, and prebendalism {{have affected}} Nigerian politics both prior and subsequent to independence in 1960. Kin-selective altruism {{has made its}} way into Nigerian politics, resulting in tribalist efforts to concentrate <b>Federal</b> <b>power</b> to a particular region of their interests. Nationalism has also led to active secessionist movements such as MASSOB, Nationalist movements such as Oodua Peoples Congress, Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta and a civil war. Nigeria's three largest ethnic groups (Hausa, Igbo and Yoruba) have maintained historical preeminence in Nigerian politics; competition amongst these three groups has fuelled corruption and graft.|$|E

5|$|In 1961, an {{overwhelming}} majority of voters in the TID and MID service areas and San Francisco approved bond issues to finance {{the construction of a new}} dam. The irrigation districts hoped to complete the dam by 1966, but concerns that the dam would further impact decreasing populations of king salmon in the Tuolumne put a temporary stop to the project. In fact, it was not until that year that the <b>Federal</b> <b>Power</b> Commission (now Federal Energy Regulatory Commission) licensed the irrigation districts to go ahead on New Don Pedro.|$|E
5|$|River {{development}} {{occurred within}} {{the structure of}} the 1909 International Boundary Waters Treaty between the US and Canada. The United States Congress passed the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1925, which directed the Army Corps of Engineers and the <b>Federal</b> <b>Power</b> Commission to explore the development of the nation's rivers. This prompted agencies to conduct the first formal financial analysis of hydroelectric development; the reports produced by various agencies were presented in House Document308. Those reports, and subsequent related reports, are referred to as 308 Reports.|$|E
5|$|When Parliament {{convened in}} January, the Liberals {{introduced}} no major proposals, and proposed nothing controversial.

When the Liberals gained <b>Federal</b> <b>power</b> in 1935, they controlled eight of the nine provincial governments, all except Alberta. By early 1957, the Liberals controlled the legislatures only in the tenth province, Newfoundland, and in Prince Edward Island and Manitoba.|$|E

5|$|While the rioting mainly {{involved}} the working class, middle and upper-class New Yorkers had split sentiments on {{the draft and}} use of <b>federal</b> <b>power</b> or martial law to enforce it. Many wealthy Democratic businessmen sought to have the draft declared unconstitutional. Tammany Democrats did not seek to have the draft declared unconstitutional but helped pay the commutation fees {{for those who were}} drafted. In December 1863, the Union League Club recruited over 2,000 black soldiers, outfitted and trained them, honoring and sending men off with a parade through the city to the Hudson River docks in March 1864. A crowd of 100,000 watched the procession, which was led by police and members of the Union League Club.|$|E
5|$|Hayes's later {{attempts}} {{to protect the}} rights of southern blacks were ineffective, as were his {{attempts to}} rebuild Republican strength in the South. He did, however, defeat Congress's efforts to curtail <b>federal</b> <b>power</b> to monitor federal elections. Democrats in Congress passed an army appropriation bill in 1879 with a rider that repealed the Enforcement Acts, which had been used to suppress the Ku Klux Klan. Those Acts, passed during Reconstruction, made it a crime to prevent someone from voting because of his race. Hayes was determined to preserve the law protecting black voters, and he vetoed the appropriation. The Democrats did not have enough votes to override the veto, but they passed a new bill with the same rider. Hayes vetoed this as well, and the process was repeated three times more. Finally, Hayes signed an appropriation without the offensive rider, but Congress refused to pass another bill to fund federal marshals, who were vital to the enforcement of the Enforcement Acts. The election laws remained in effect, but the funds to enforce them were curtailed for the time being.|$|E
5|$|In general, the USACE {{credited}} existing {{flood control}} projects as preventing additional flooding. In West Virginia alone, {{it was estimated}} that existing flood-control projects saved about $135million in damage. Lake Moomaw in western Virginia helped prevent $70million in damage along the James River. In Pennsylvania, flood measures resulted in minimal flooding along the Youghiogheny River. After sustaining damage from flooding along the Monongahela River with little warning, the owners of a marina filed a class action lawsuit in the Court of Common Pleas of Washington County on November21, 1985, against West Penn Power Company to compensate for damages. The plaintiffs believed that the damage occurred because the company opened the flood gates of the Lake Lynn Dam. The power company attempted to move the case to the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania in March 1986, citing the <b>Federal</b> <b>Power</b> Act's provision that claims should be in the District Court, but the nature of the suit sent it back to the Court of Common Pleas, bringing it to trial in September 1989. The jury found that although the West Penn Power was negligent, the damage was caused mainly by the historic and unprecedented flooding; consequently, the case entered a compulsory nonsuit, meaning the company was not required to pay compensation. The plaintiffs sought an appeal in 1990, which was denied.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{aim of this}} {{investigation}} is to propose {{the absence of a}} subsidiarity criterion inBrazilian constitutional system.

5|$|Randall's {{determination}} to cut spending, combined with Southern Democrats' desire to reduce <b>federal</b> <b>power</b> {{in their home}} states, led the House to pass an army appropriation bill with a rider that repealed the Enforcement Acts, which {{had been used to}} suppress the Ku Klux Klan. The Enforcement Acts, passed during Reconstruction over Democratic opposition, made it a crime to prevent someone from voting because of his race. Hayes was determined to preserve the law protecting black voters, and he vetoed the appropriation.

Finally, Hayes signed an appropriation without the rider, but Congress refused to pass another bill to fund federal marshals, who were vital to the enforcement of the Enforcement Acts. The election laws remained in effect, but the funds to enforce them were curtailed. Randall's role in the process was limited, but the Democrats' failure to force Hayes's acquiescence weakened his appeal as a potential presidential candidate in 1880.|$|E
