6000|$|... "But I {{have won}} in this: I've never excused my {{failures}} by sneering at my aspirations, by pretending {{to have gone}} beyond them. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not <b>admit</b> that Main Street is as beautiful as it should be! <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not <b>admit</b> that Gopher Prairie is greater or more generous than Europe! <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not <b>admit</b> that dish-washing is enough to satisfy all women! I may not have fought the good fight, but I have kept the faith." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I did {{not mean}} to say {{anything}} severe. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>admit</b> that you are master of a certain philosophy, for which much may be said. But you are not to expect that I shall express an approval which <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not feel." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{exertion}} of mind or body {{which is}} not the involuntary effect of the influence of natural sensations," [...] slowly repeated Vivian, as if his whole soul was concentrated in each monosyllable. [...] "Y-e-s, Mr. Toad, <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>admit</b> it." ...|$|R
60|$|JUNO. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not <b>admit</b> that <b>I</b> have <b>done</b> wrong. <b>I</b> <b>admit</b> {{that what}} <b>I</b> <b>did</b> was wrong.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Let them send {{to us for}} succour then,' {{answered}} Mother Margaret. 'I {{grant that}} it is well that some one should tend them in their huts, but such tasks are for sisters of low birth and breeding. Mine are ladies of noble rank, though <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>admit</b> daughters of Lord Mayors and Aldermen.' ...|$|R
5000|$|In her unhappiness, Carol {{leaves her}} husband and moves for a time to Washington, D.C., but she {{eventually}} returns. Nevertheless, Carol does not feel defeated:I <b>do</b> not <b>admit</b> that Main Street is as beautiful as it should be! <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not <b>admit</b> that Gopher Prairie is greater or more generous than Europe! <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not <b>admit</b> that dish-washing is enough to satisfy all women! I may not have fought the good fight, but I have kept the faith. (Chapter 39) ...|$|R
60|$|No: I {{cannot be}} {{put off by the}} news that our system would be perfect if it were worked by angels. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not <b>admit</b> it even at that, just as <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not <b>admit</b> that if the sky fell we should all catch larks. But <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not propose to bother about a supply of {{specific}} genius which does not exist, and which, if it did exist, could operate only by at once recognizing and establishing the rights of children.|$|R
60|$|PYGMALION. No. But then, you know, <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not <b>admit</b> {{that any}} of us can do {{anything}} really original, though Martellus thinks we can.|$|R
6000|$|... "M. Parvissimus, no rancour. It {{is a thing}} <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not <b>admit</b> into my life. You will {{shake hands}} with me, and we will forget all this." ...|$|R
60|$|ECRASIA [sententiously] <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not <b>admit</b> that. The artist divines by {{inspiration}} all {{the truths}} {{that the so-called}} scientist grubs up in his laboratory slowly and stupidly long afterwards.|$|R
60|$|National {{dignity in}} all {{treaties}} <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>admit</b> {{is an important}} consideration. They have given us a useful hint on that subject: but dignity, hitherto, has belonged to the mode of proceeding, not to the matter of a treaty. Never before has it been mentioned as the standard for rating the conditions of peace; no, never by the most violent of conquerors. Indemnification is capable of some estimate: dignity has no standard. It is impossible to guess what acquisitions pride and ambition may think fit for their DIGNITY.|$|R
6000|$|... "You took a {{business}} hazard, Robert, as did Mrs. Fenwood," [...] Leonard contended. [...] "Even if our Canadian prospects were {{as bad as}} Andrew imagines, which <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not <b>admit,</b> you would have no grievance." ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>I</b> have <b>done</b> {{paintings}} that lead {{some people to}} believe I’m an honest-to-goodness naïve painter {{right from the start}} amazes me. It must be because I get into a way of thinking that’s like the way naïve and primitive painters think. And I don’t see the description ‘primitive’ as a criticism of my work. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>admit</b> to being partial to primitive, naïve, and eccentric works, and some folk art…I like it when <b>I</b> can <b>do</b> a symbolic statement of an object that has the feel of the original if not the exact form. My dogs are, to a certain extent, caricatures. The distortions make them more effective, more powerful.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>do</b> {{not mind}} <b>admitting</b> that I was seriously upset. Under such {{conditions}} I had but one thought.|$|R
6000|$|... "If I {{give you}} this sum," [...] Deane asked, [...] "do I {{understand}} that it closes the whole affair? You must remember that <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not <b>admit</b> having even seen this deed you spoke of. Supposing it turns up in somebody else's hands?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I thank you, Citizen," [...] rejoined Chauvelin calmly. [...] "I always entertained a {{hope that}} some day the Revolutionary Government would call again on my services. I admit that I failed last year. The Englishman is resourceful. He has wits and he is very rich. He would not have succeeded, I think, but for his money--and {{corruption}} and bribery are rife in Paris and on our coasts. He slipped through my fingers {{at the very moment}} when I thought that I held him most securely. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>admit</b> all that, but I am prepared to redeem my failure of last year, and... there is nothing more to discuss.--I am ready to start." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "In {{the first}} place," [...] replied he, looking uncommonly wise, and placing {{the point of}} his right finger {{in the palm of}} his left hand--"in the first place, <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not <b>admit</b> your premises, and {{therefore}} I object to your conclusion. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not <b>admit</b> that in civilised societies most votes carry; on the contrary, it too frequently happens that, in civilised societies, motions are made, seconded, discussed, and carried without being put to the vote at all; often they are carried without being made, seconded, or discussed--as when a bottle-nosed old gentleman in office chooses to ignore the rights of men, and carry everything his own way. Neither <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>admit</b> that we three are civilised hunters; for although it is true that I am, it is well-known that you, Ralph, are a philosopher, and Jack is a gorilla. Therefore I object to your conclusion that your two votes should carry; for you cannot but admit that the vote of one hunter ought to override that of two such creatures, which would not be the case were there an equality existing between us." ...|$|R
6000|$|Ber. You'll {{come to life}} in your Valeria's arms. [...] 'Tis true, I cannot {{boast of}} equal charms; [...] Or, if I could, <b>I</b> never <b>did</b> <b>admit</b> [...] Your love to me, but only {{suffered}} it. [...] I am a wife, and can make no return; [...] And 'twere but vain in hopeless fires to burn.|$|R
6000|$|... "Listen," [...] she said. [...] "I {{have heard}} these things from you before, {{and you have}} had my answer. Understand {{once and for all}} that that answer is final. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not <b>admit</b> the truth of a word which you have said. I will not be persecuted in this way by you." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{have read}} {{a good deal}} of Mr. Hayward's version, and <b>I</b> think it <b>done</b> in a very manly style; but <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not <b>admit</b> the {{argument}} for prose translations. I would in general rather see verse attempted in so capable a language as ours. The French cannot help themselves, of course, with such a language as theirs.|$|R
6000|$|They all started, {{and looked}} at Dunham as good Protestants must when some one whom {{they would never have}} {{suspected}} of Catholicism {{turns out to be a}} Catholic. Dunham cast a reproachful glance at his friend, but said simply, [...] "I am a Catholic,--that is true; but <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not <b>admit</b> the pretensions of the Bishop of Rome." ...|$|R
6000|$|CUSINS. You know, <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not <b>admit</b> that <b>I</b> am {{imposing}} on Barbara. I {{am quite}} genuinely {{interested in the}} views of the Salvation Army. The fact is, I am a sort of collector of religions; and the curious thing is that I find I can believe them all. By the way, have you any religion? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, Kathy, I had {{supposed}} {{you were}} drawing that magnificent landscape all this time, and--and you've only been drawing {{a group of}} shells. Splendidly <b>done,</b> <b>I</b> <b>admit,</b> but why--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Frankly, I don't know," [...] he answered, with a smile. [...] "Since rereading Zöllner and Crookes {{and going}} over my notes {{and those of}} Dr. Randall, I'm a little shaken, I confess. So far as human {{evidence}} goes these men prove {{that there is a}} world of phenomena ignored by science. I don't {{go so far as to}} say that these doings were the work of disembodied spirits, but <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>admit</b> that <b>I</b> am puzzled by things which I have witnessed with one sense or another. The things seem to tally in a most convincing way. This girl is repeating, substantially, the same phenomena witnessed by Crookes twenty-five years ago. The singular thing about the whole subject is that one man can't convince another by any amount of evidence. A personal revelation is necessary for each individual." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I {{was sorry}} I {{could not tell}} her exactly what you told me. It {{would have been better}} if <b>I</b> could have <b>done</b> so. <b>I</b> simply said there were many sorts of courage, and that I was sure that you possessed many sorts in a very high degree, but I could not, of course, deny; {{although}} <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not <b>admit,</b> the truth of the report he had mentioned." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If I cannot {{tell you}} the truth," [...] he promised, [...] "I {{am not going to}} tell you a lie, but apart from that <b>I</b> <b>admit</b> nothing. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not even <b>admit</b> that it was I whom you saw." ...|$|R
60|$|Here was a {{pleasing}} predicament. But if Alain had {{started with a}} chance of daunting me (which <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not <b>admit),</b> he had spoilt it long since by working on the raw of my temper. I kept a steady eye on him, and considered: and the longer I considered the better assured was I that his game must have a disastrously weak point somewhere, which it was my business to find.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{mean to be}} kind. <b>I</b> <b>do,</b> indeed, Conway. <b>I</b> know it will {{be better}} for you that you should be settled,--very much better. And {{it will be better}} for me. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not mind <b>admitting</b> that;--though in saying so I trust greatly to your {{generosity}} to interpret my words properly." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That," [...] he said, {{pushing the}} box across the table, [...] "you may know {{in good time}} if, in {{commercial}} parlance, we deal. Until that point is decided, I am Mr. Sabin. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not even <b>admit</b> {{that it is an}} incognito." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Caryll smiled, {{and nodded}} across to her. [...] "'Tis vastly kind in you, Mistress Winthrop. But the gentleman is mistook." [...] He turned to Green. [...] "Harkee, sirrah <b>did</b> <b>I</b> <b>admit</b> that I had carried that letter?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do not be over-confident, young gentleman," [...] {{the doctor}} said {{in a tone of}} mild reproof. [...] "While <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not <b>admit</b> that you will be in any serious danger, it is the part of a wise man to count all the cost, and give due heed to every possibility. Come to an end of your journey at the {{earliest}} moment, and until the message has been delivered, put no trust in strangers however fair they may speak you." ...|$|R
60|$|If your clergy, or any clergy, {{should show}} {{themselves}} vicious beyond the fair bounds allowed to human infirmity, {{and to those}} professional faults which can hardly be separated from professional virtues, though their vices never can countenance the exercise of oppression, <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>admit</b> that they would naturally {{have the effect of}} abating very much of our indignation against the tyrants who exceed measure and justice in their punishment. I can allow in clergymen, through all their divisions, some tenaciousness of their own opinion, some overflowings of zeal for its propagation, some predilection to their own state and office, some attachment to the interest of their own corps, some preference to those who Us ten with docility to their doctrines beyond those who scorn and deride them. I allow all this, because I am a man who have to deal with men, and who would not, through a violence of toleration, run into the greatest of all intolerance. I must bear with infirmities, until they fester into crimes.|$|R
60|$|I put {{the balls}} for safety in my hat, and I put my hat upon the doorstep. It {{was not a}} {{sensible}} thing to <b>do,</b> <b>I</b> <b>admit.</b> As a matter of fact, it was a silly thing to <b>do.</b> <b>I</b> am not as a rule addle-headed; his influence must have affected me.|$|R
60|$|Sir Francis Freeling was {{followed}} at the Post Office by Colonel Maberly, who {{certainly was not}} my friend. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not know that I deserved to find a friend in my new master, but I think that a man with better judgment would not have formed so low an opinion of me as he did. Years have gone by, and I can write now, and almost feel, without anger; but I can remember well the keenness of my anguish when I was treated as though I were unfit for any useful work. <b>I</b> <b>did</b> struggle--not to do the work, for there was nothing which was not easy without any struggling--but to show that I {{was willing to do}} it. My bad character nevertheless stuck to me, and was not to be got rid of by any efforts within my power. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>admit</b> that <b>I</b> was irregular. It was not considered to be much in my favour that I could write letters--which was mainly the work of our office--rapidly, correctly, and to the purpose. The man who came at ten, and who was always still at his desk at half-past four, was preferred before me, though when at his desk he might be less efficient. Such preference was no doubt proper; but, with a little encouragement, I also would have been punctual. I got credit for nothing and was reckless.|$|R
5000|$|Regarding his {{appearance}} in Henry IV, he said, “This {{is my first}} encounter with Shakespeare, and all <b>I</b> can <b>do</b> is <b>admit</b> that <b>I</b> have an overwhelming and massive piece of material ahead of me. Because really understanding the characters and the setting demands {{a lot more than}} a script." ...|$|R
