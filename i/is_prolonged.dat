5|$|Moult <b>is</b> <b>prolonged</b> in all tubenoses, {{since they}} must {{maintain}} {{an ability to}} fly. Northern populations start replacing their plumage after those further south, reflecting the later start to their breeding season. Birds in a Welsh colony commenced moulting in early August, while populations in northern Spain and the Balearics started in early July and mid-June respectively. Breeding birds moult later than non-breeders.|$|E
5|$|Exposure to lead {{may also}} {{decrease}} lifespan and have health {{effects in the}} long term. Death rates {{from a variety of}} causes {{have been found to be}} higher in people with elevated blood lead levels; these include cancer, stroke, and heart disease, and general death rates from all causes. Lead is considered a possible human carcinogen based on evidence from animal studies. Evidence also suggests that age-related mental decline and psychiatric symptoms are correlated with lead exposure. Cumulative exposure over a prolonged period may have a more important effect on some aspects of health than recent exposure. Some health effects, such as high blood pressure, are only significant risks when lead exposure <b>is</b> <b>prolonged</b> (over about one year).|$|E
5|$|The ear drum {{may become}} {{perforated}} {{in the event}} of a large sound or explosion, when diving or flying (called barotrauma), or by objects inserted into the ear. Another common cause of injury is due to an infection such as otitis media. These may cause a discharge from the ear called otorrhea, and are often investigated by otoscopy and audiometry. Treatment may include watchful waiting, antibiotics and possibly surgery, if the injury <b>is</b> <b>prolonged</b> or the position of the ossicles is affected. Skull fractures that go through the part of the skull containing the ear structures (the temporal bone) can also cause damage to the middle ear. A cholesteatoma is a cyst of squamous skin cells that may develop from birth or secondary to other causes such as chronic ear infections. It may impair hearing or cause dizziness or vertigo, and is usually investigated by otoscopy and may require a CT scan. The treatment for cholesteatoma is surgery.|$|E

5|$|The third {{axillary}} sclerite (3Ax) lies in {{the posterior}} part of the articular region of the wing. Its form is highly variable and often irregular, but the third axillary is the sclerite on which is inserted the flexor muscle of the wing (D). Mesally it articulates anteriorly (f) with the posterior {{end of the second}} axillary, and posteriorly (b) with the posterior wing process of the tergum (PNP), or with a small fourth axillary when the latter is present. Distally the third axillary <b>is</b> <b>prolonged</b> in a process which is always associated with the bases of the group of veins in the anal region of the wing here termed the vannal veins (V). The third axillary, therefore, is usually the posterior hinge plate of the wing base and is the active sclerite of the flexor mechanism, which directly manipulates the vannal veins. The contraction of the flexor muscle (D) revolves the third axillary on its mesal articulations (b, f) and thereby lifts its distal arm; this movement produces the flexion of the wing. The Fourth Axillary sclerite is not a constant element of the wing base. When present it is usually a small plate intervening between the third axillary and the posterior notal wing process and is probably a detached piece of the latter.|$|E
25|$|The general {{cause of}} this disease <b>is</b> <b>prolonged</b> and heavy {{consumption}} of alcohol accompanied by a nutritional deficiency. There is some debate over whether the main cause is the direct toxic effect of alcohol itself or whether the disease {{is a result of}} alcoholism-related malnutrition.|$|E
25|$|Attachment {{of a few}} larvae to a non-sensitised host provokes {{little or}} no response, even though the contact <b>is</b> <b>prolonged</b> over several days. However, {{towards the end of}} feeding some pruritus, {{erythema}} and localised oedema may develop at the site of attachment.|$|E

25|$|These {{neoplasms}} {{are divided}} into three categories, pineoblastomas, pineocytomas, and mixed tumours, based on their level of differentiation, which, in turn, correlates with their neoplastic aggressiveness. The clinical course of patients with pineocytomas <b>is</b> <b>prolonged,</b> averaging up to several years. The position of these tumours makes them very difficult to remove surgically.|$|E
25|$|Another {{thing that}} may cause visual {{hallucinations}} <b>is</b> <b>prolonged</b> visual deprivation. In a study where 13 healthy people were blindfolded for 5 days, 10 {{out of the}} 13 subjects reported visual hallucinations. This finding lends strong support {{to the idea that}} the simple loss of normal visual input is sufficient to cause visual hallucinations.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the first}} decade of the 21st century a life {{sentence}} was handed out 26 times by Dutch judges. They will all die in prison unless given parole by Royal decree. In addition to a prison sentence, the judge may sentence the suspect to terbeschikkingstelling (literary: for entrustment), or TBS, meaning detention in a psychiatric institution, sometimes including forced treatment. TBS is imposed for a two years but can <b>be</b> <b>prolonged</b> for one or two years if deemed necessary by a committee of psychiatrists. Normal TBS can only <b>be</b> <b>prolonged</b> up to a term of four or nine years, whereas compulsory TBS can <b>be</b> <b>prolonged</b> indefinitely.|$|R
25|$|The {{process of}} {{force-feeding}} can make animals sick by stressing the liver. If the stress <b>is</b> <b>prolonged,</b> excess protein may build up and clump together as amyloids, consumption {{of which has}} been found to induce amyloidosis in laboratory mice. It has been hypothesized this may be a route of transmission in humans too and so be a risk for people with inflammatory complaints such as rheumatoid arthritis.|$|E
25|$|Healing time <b>is</b> <b>prolonged</b> {{for higher}} stage ulcers. While about 75% of Stage II ulcers heal within eight weeks, only 62% of Stage IV {{pressure}} ulcers ever heal, and only 52% heal within one year. Pressure ulcers do not regress in stage as they heal. A pressure ulcer that is becoming shallower with healing {{is described in}} terms of its original deepest depth (e.g., healing Stage II pressure ulcer).|$|E
25|$|The major {{difficulty}} in identifying adcumulate peridotite piles {{in excess of}} 1km as being entirely volcanic is the {{difficulty in}} envisaging a komatiitic eruptive event which <b>is</b> <b>prolonged</b> enough to persist long enough to build up via accumulation such a thickness of olivine-only material. It is considered equally plausible that such large dunite-peridotite bodies represent lave channels or sills through which, perhaps, great volumes of lava flowed {{en route to the}} surface.|$|E

25|$|When smoked, the {{short-term}} effects of cannabis manifest within seconds and are fully apparent {{within a few}} minutes, typically lasting for 1â€“3 hours, varying by the person and the strain of cannabis. After oral ingestion of cannabis, the onset of effect is delayed relative to smoking, taking 30 minutes to 2 hours, but the duration <b>is</b> <b>prolonged</b> due to continued slow absorption. The duration of noticeable effects has been observed to diminish due to prolonged, repeated use {{and the development of}} a tolerance to cannabinoids.|$|E
25|$|The vesico-urethral portion is {{the deepest}} portion, {{continuous}} with the allantois. It absorbs {{the ends of}} the Wolffian ducts and the associated ends of the renal diverticula, and these give rise to the trigone of urinary bladder and part of the prostatic urethra. The remainder of the vesico-urethral portion forms the body of the bladder and part of the prostatic urethra; its apex <b>is</b> <b>prolonged</b> to the umbilicus as a narrow canal, the urachus, which later is obliterated and becomes the median umbilical ligament of the adult.|$|E
25|$|Huddling: Prolonged {{physical}} contact or huddling also serves social integration. Huddling promotes heat exchange, {{together with the}} transfer of olfactory or tactile information. Some organisms live in constant contact in a colony, for example colonial corals. When individuals are linked tightly in this way an entire colony can react on the aversive or alarm movements made by only a few individuals. In several herbivorous insect nymphs and larvae, aggregations where there <b>is</b> <b>prolonged</b> contact {{play a major role}} in group coordination. These aggregations may take the form of a procession or a rosette.|$|E

25|$|Another {{interesting}} treatment {{strategy for}} is casein glycomacropeptide (CGMP), {{which is a}} milk peptide naturally free of Phe in its pure form CGMP can substitute {{the main part of}} the free amino acids in the PKU diet and provides several beneficial nutritional effects compared to free amino acids. The fact that CGMP is a peptide ensures that the absorption rate of its amino acids <b>is</b> <b>prolonged</b> compared to free amino acids and thereby results in improved protein retention and increased satiety compared to free amino acids. Another important benefit of CGMP is that the taste is significantly improved when CGMP substitutes part of the free amino acids and this may help ensure improved compliance to the PKU diet.|$|E
25|$|H2-receptor antagonists: include {{cimetidine}} (Tagamet), famotidine (Pepcid), nizatidine (Axid), and ranitidine (Zantac). Reduced secretion of {{gastric acid}} and pepsin produced by H2 blockers can reduce absorption of protein-bound (dietary) vitamin B12, {{but not of}} supplemental vitamin B12. Gastric acid is needed to release vitamin B12 from protein for absorption. Clinically significant vitamin B12 deficiency and megaloblastic anemia are unlikely, unless H2 blocker therapy <b>is</b> <b>prolonged</b> (2 years or more), or the person's diet is poor. It is also more likely {{if the person is}} rendered achlorhydric(with complete absence of gastric acid secretion), which occurs more frequently with proton pump inhibitors than H2 blockers. Vitamin B12 levels should be monitored in people taking high doses of H2 blockers for prolonged periods.|$|E
25|$|Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs): The PPIs include {{omeprazole}} (Prilosec, Losec), lansoprazole (Prevacid), rabeprazole (Aciphex), pantoprazole (Protonix, Pantoloc), and esomeprazole (Nexium). The reduced secretion of {{gastric acid}} and pepsin produced by PPIs can reduce absorption of protein-bound (dietary) vitamin B12, but not supplemental vitamin B12. Gastric acid {{is needed to}} release vitamin B12 from protein for absorption. Reduced vitamin B12 levels may be more common with PPIs than with H2 antagonists, {{because they are more}} likely to produce achlorhydria (complete absence of gastric acid secretion). Clinically significant vitamin B12 deficiency is unlikely, unless PPI therapy <b>is</b> <b>prolonged</b> (2 years or more) or dietary vitamin intake is low. Vitamin B12 levels should be monitored in people taking high doses of PPIs for prolonged periods.|$|E
