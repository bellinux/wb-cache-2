Both the {{free fatty acids}} and the triglycerides in the waste cooking oil were deoxygenated {{at the same time to}} form hydrocarbons in the <b>hydrotreatment</b> process. The predominant liquid hydrocarbon products (98. 9 wt%) were n-C 18 H 38, n-C 17 H 36, n-C 16 H 34, and n-C 15 H 32 when a Ru/SiO 2 catalyst was used. These long chain normal hydrocarbons had high melting points and gave the liquid hydrocarbon product over Ru/SiO 2 a high pour point of 20 °C. Ru/H-Y was not suitable for producing diesel from waste cooking oil because it formed a large amount of C 5 –C 10 gasoline-ranged paraffins on the strong acid sites of HY. When Al-polyoxocation-pillared montmorillonite (Al 13 -Mont) was used as a support for the Ru catalyst, the pour point of the liquid hydrocarbon product decreased to − 15 °C with the conversion of a significant amount of C 15 –C 18 n-paraffins to iso-paraffins and light paraffins on the weak acid sites of Al 13 -Mont.

Hindered diffusion and adsorption of asphaltene molecules inside <b>hydrotreatment</b> catalysts' carriers were studied. The system's kinetics was investigated by visible absorption spectroscopy. Asphaltenes were prepared by n-heptane separation and solubilized in toluene at a known concentration and put in contact with a given amount of catalyst support.

Since the catalytic dissociative reaction of the aliphatic group was initiated by the adsorption of the residue on the alumina support of the desulfurization catalyst, olefins produced by acid sites on the alumina are probably responsible for the catalyst deactivation through the deposition of coke.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this DOE-funded effort is to develop {{continuous}} processes for solvent extraction of coal {{for the production of}} carbon products. These carbon products include materials used in metals smelting, especially in the aluminum and steel industries, as well as porous carbon structural material referred to as ''carbon foam'' and carbon fibers. The <b>Hydrotreatment</b> Facility is being prepared for trials with coal liquids. Raw coal tar distillate trials have been carried out by heating coal tar in the holding tank in the <b>Hydrotreatment</b> Facility. The liquids are centrifuged to warm the system up in preparation for the coal liquids. The coal tar distillate is then recycled to keep the centrifuge hot. In this way, the product has been distilled such that a softening point of approximately 110 C is reached. Then an ash test is conducted...|$|E
40|$|The {{energy demand}} is {{increasing}} {{in the world}} together {{with the need to}} ensure energy security and the desire to decrease greenhouse gas emissions. While several renewable alternatives are available for the production of electricity, e. g. solar energy, wind power, and hydrogen, biomass is the only renewable source that can meet the demand for carbon-based liquid fuels and chemicals. The technology applied in the conversion of biomass depends on the type and complexity of the biomass, and the desired fuel. Hydrogen and hydrogen-rich mixtures (synthesis gas) are promising energy sources as they are more efficient and cleaner than existing fuels, especially when they are used in fuel cells. <b>Hydrotreatment</b> is a catalytic process {{that can be used in}} the conversion of biomass or biomass-derived liquids into fuels. In autothermal reforming (ATR), catalysts are used in the production of hydrogen-rich mixtures from conventional fuels or bio-fuels. The different nature of biomass and biomass-derived liquids and mineral oil makes the use of catalysts developed for the petroleum industry challenging. This requires the improvement of available catalysts and the development of new ones. To overcome the limitations of conventional <b>hydrotreatment</b> and ATR catalysts, zirconia-supported mono- and bimetallic rhodium, palladium, and platinum catalysts were developed and tested in the upgrading of model compounds for wood-based pyrolysis oil and in the production of hydrogen, using model compounds for gasoline and diesel. Catalysts were also tested in the ATR of ethanol. For comparative purposes commercial catalysts were tested and the results obtained with model compounds were compared with those obtained with real feedstocks (hydrotreatmet tests with wood-based pyrolysis oil and ATR tests with NExBTL renewable diesel). Noble metal catalysts were active and selective in the <b>hydrotreatment</b> of guaiacol used as the model compound for the lignin fraction of wood-based pyrolysis oil and wood-based pyrolysis oil, and in the ATR of simulated gasoline and diesel, low sulfur diesel and ethanol for the production of hydrogen-rich mixture for fuel cells. In <b>hydrotreatment</b> and ATR, rhodium-containing catalysts were the most active, selective, and stable...|$|E
