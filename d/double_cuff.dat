40|$|We have {{examined}} the effect of EMLA on tour-niquet pain and compared it with those of sub-cutaneous ring anaesthesia (SRA), a <b>double</b> <b>cuff</b> technique and a single cuff (control) during i. v. regional anaesthesia. The durations of analgesia (mean 57. 3 (SD 16. 6) min) and tolerance (72. 3 (13. 9) min) to tourniquet inflation in the EMLA group were comparable {{to those in the}} SRA group (54. 1 (16. 2) min and 68. 3 (19. 0) min), but signifi-cantly (P < 0. 05) greater than those in the control group (30. 0 (10. 7) min and 45. 6 (14. 0) min).

Methods: This is a retrospective comparative study of peritoneal dialysis catheters inserted between January 2003 and December 2008 by one surgical team at Mater Dei Hospital. Results: The one year catheter survival rate was TC 88. 5 % and SN 90 %. There was no statistically significant difference in catheter survival rate between the two cohorts.

Despite international guidelines recommending the avoidance of catheters for hemodialysis access, hospital admissions for vascular ARIs have {{doubled in the last}} decade. Moreover, repeated use of antibiotics to treat ARIs has been associated with the selection of multiresistant organisms, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococci. ARIs result from direct inoculation of skin organisms during access cannulation/connection, migration of skin organisms along dialysis catheters into the bloodstream or peritoneal cavity, or contamination and colonization of catheter lumens with subsequent biofilm formation. This paper will review the epidemiology, pathogenesis and prevention of ARIs. It will focus specifically on randomized, controlled trial evidence in relation to the safety and efficacy of aseptic techniques, nasal eradication of S. aureus, oral antimicrobial prophylaxis, topical antimicrobial prophylaxis (including disinfectants, antibiotics and antibacterial honey), antimicrobial catheter lock solutions (including gentamicin, citrate and ethanol), antimicrobial-impregnated catheters, catheter design (straight vs coiled, single vs <b>double</b> <b>cuff),</b> peritoneal dialysis catheter connectology, catheter insertion technique, germicidal devices, vaccines and preinsertion antibiotic prophylaxis...|$|E

40|$|To give an {{anesthetic}} is one thing, {{to practice}} the art of anaesthesia is another", this statement is still true, especially for a regional anaesthetic technique, that was pre-sented 100 years ago the first time: the intravenous regional anaesthesia (IVRA), "Venenanaesthesie" or Bier-block (1). The new method was inaugurated by the famous Berlin surgeon August Bier, father of spinal anaesthesia. The technique itself is simple: Primarily the arm or leg is/was exsanguinated. A specially designed cannula was tied into a previously marked and exposed vein. Then the local anaesthetic solution Novocain® was injected which resulted in immediate “direct” anaesthesia between the two bandages and slow “indirect” anaesthesia in the distal part of the limb. Later on Bier realized {{that the use of}} the second, distal bandage was superfluous whereas his suggestion to release the tourniquet {{at the end of the}} surgical procedure with care is still “state of the art". Primarily Bier's ”Venenanaesthesie” found a world-wide enthusiastic acceptance. Nevertheless the method was soon forgotten, as new techniques for blocking peripheral nerves were inaugurated. (2). In the early 1960 'ths, the method was revived by a publication by the New Zealand anaesthetist Mc Holmes. He was using local anaesthetics like lidocaine or prilocaine (3). His publication initiated an intensive research on the field of IVRA and led to the development of a <b>double</b> <b>cuff</b> thus minimizing associated pain by the inflated tourniquet. Furthermore, Holmes' publication was followed by a world-wide increasing interest in this forgotten technique. As IVRA is an excellent, cost-effective and safe technique, that can be used in ambulatory surgery as well as in pain therapy, the method should play a major role in our daily anaesthetic practice and should become an integral part of the anaesthesiologists "armentarium anaesthesiologicum" in the near future (4, 5...|$|E
40|$|To {{increase}} the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of (H 2 O) -O- 15 bolus PET activation images, we designed and tested a data acquisition protocol that alters the relative distribution of tracer in the uptake and washout {{phases of the}} input function. This protocol enhances the S/N gains obtained with conventional switched protocols by combining task switching {{and the use of}} a large bolus of blood free of tracer (cold bolus). The cold bolus is formed by sequestering blood in the lower limbs with a <b>double</b> <b>cuff</b> before tracer injection. Methods: The effect of a combined cold-bolus, switched protocol on the signal from activation images was first simulated using a compartmental model of the uptake of (H 2 O) -O- 15 into the brain. Then, the effectiveness of the protocol was investigated in 4 healthy volunteers performing a language task. Each volunteer underwent scanning 12 times: 3 activation/baseline and 3 baseline/activation scans using the conventional switched protocol and 3 activation/baseline and 3 baseline/activation scans using the combined cold-bolus, switched protocol. The S/N changes introduced when using the cold bolus were analyzed by comparing, across protocols, the magnitude and statistical significance of the activation foci associated with the execution of the language task identified in the averaged subtracted images, and by comparing image noise levels. Results: In the simulated datasets, the combined protocol yielded a substantial increase in the activation signals for scan durations greater than 60 s, in comparison with equivalent signals yielded by the switched protocol alone. In the PET experiments, activation foci obtained using the combined protocol had significantly higher t statistic values than did equivalent foci detected using the conventional switched protocol (mean improvement, 36 %). Analysis of the S/N in the averaged subtracted images revealed that the improvements in statistical significance of the activation foci were caused by increases in the signal magnitudes and not by decreases in overall image noise. Conclusion: We designed a data acquisition protocol for (H 2 O) -O- 15 bolus PET activation studies that combines the use of a tracer-free bolus with a switched protocol. Simulated and experimental data suggest that this combined protocol enhances the S/N gains obtained with a conventional switched protocol.

[...] On cold days, it was common to wear a frock overcoat, a type of overcoat cut {{exactly the same as}} the frock coat, with the waist seam construction, only a little longer and fuller to permit it to be worn {{over the top of the}} frock coat. Patent leather dress boots were worn up until the Edwardian era with morning dress. The practice of wearing patent leather shoes is today reserved strictly for evening formalwear. [...] Trousers are uncuffed and worn with braces (suspenders in American English) to avoid the top of the trousers from showing underneath the waistcoat. Only white shirts were worn with frock coats. The shirt was worn with a standing detachable collar. The most standard neckwear was a formal cravat (or Ascot in American English). The cravat was tied in the Ascot knot (the entire cravat is called an Ascot in American English) characterised by way the ends cross over in front, or alternatively in a Ruche knot, tied like a four-in-hand knot of a modern necktie. A decorative cravat pin often adorned with a precious stone or pearl was used to keep the cravat tidy. The cravat was usual with a frock coat when worn in more formal occasions through the Victorian and Edwardian eras, although the long necktie came to be worn increasingly after the turn of the century in the same manner as it is today with morning dress. The practice of wearing bow ties as an acceptable alternative with formalwear fell away after the late Victorian to early Edwardian era and became relegated to eveningwear, as remains the case in the twenty-1st century. As with a formal shirt for white tie, cuffs were single (rather than <b>double)</b> <b>cuffed</b> and made to close with cufflinks.

This is the generation carried away with pride, arrogancy, lust, gluttony, and uncleanness; who eat and drink and rise up to play, their eyes full of adultery, and their bodies of the devil's adorning.[171] Such quotations from the writings of men of undoubted veracity, and who lived during that period, might be multiplied to fill a volume.|$|R
40|$|Acute {{and chronic}} Toxoplasma infections were {{evaluated}} in mice using stage specific antibodies and immunocytochemistry. Mice with acute toxoplasmosis were less active, had erectile body hair and seldom took {{food or water}} resulting in weight loss. All mice died within 7 days post-inoculation. The immunohistochemical technique enhanced visualization of parasites allowing their distribution to be accurately followed. Following intraperitoneal infection, tachyzoites were initially identified {{on the surface of}} the liver and spleen. There was a rapid increase in the number of tachyzoites associated with invasion from the surrounding connective tissue into the organs with formation of inflammatory lesions in the liver. The focal inflammatory lesions showed increasing numbers of tachyzoites with the period post-inoculation. Similar increases in tachyzoites were observed for the spleen. In contrast, only a few individual tachyzoites were seen in the brain at the final time point. In chronic infections, the mice were asymptomatic but tissue cysts containing large numbers of bradyzoites were observed in all brains with the average number of 295 tissue cysts per half brain and the average cystic size of 46. 02 +/- 5. 08 microm. By histology and immunostaining, the tissue cysts were readily identifiable along with a mild inflammatory cell infiltration into the meninges and perivascular <b>cuffing.</b> <b>Double</b> immunocytochemical labelling confirmed the exclusive presence of tachyzoites during the acute phase and bradyzoites during the chronic phase...|$|R
