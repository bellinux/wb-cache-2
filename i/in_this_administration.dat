2500|$|The Charlotte Three {{case was}} {{an event that}} epitomized the larger issues of politics, race, {{and the civil rights}} {{movement}} in the South. The commuting of the sentences for the men may not have actually been purely due to the reasons publicly stated, but instead for hidden political ones. In 1979, an election year, {{there was a lot of}} turmoil and Governor Hunt and the Democratic party were worried about the backlash that would ensue if the men were still imprisoned at the time of the election. Herbert N. Lape who was serving as the vice-chairman of the North Carolina state democratic party stated in a letter to Hunt that many people in the state view [...] "the Charlotte Three [...] as [...] primarily white witch [...] that involved racial bigotry". A secretary by the name of Joseph Grimsley also stated in a memo to Governor Hunt, [...] " [...] state's repressive image is beginning to spill over <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>administration</b> to yours personally".|$|E

[...] On the subject, he said, [...] "I just feel that the reason of going in {{for weapons of mass}} destruction, the ability of the Iraqis to make a nuclear weapon, that's all been proven that it was never there." [...] He added that his change of opinion came about from {{attending}} the funeral of a sergeant killed in Iraq, when his last letter to his family was being read out.
