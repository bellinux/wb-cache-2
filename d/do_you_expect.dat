500|$|Chinese {{politicians}} {{within the}} government raised issues with the Constitution in late 2005. Lim Keng Yaik of Gerakan asked for a re-examination of the social contract to ascertain whether Bangsa Malaysia could be achieved. Lim was severely criticised by many prominent Malay politicians, including Khairy Jamaluddin and Ahmad Shabery Cheek. The Malay press, mostly owned by UMNO, also ran articles condemning the questioning of the social contract. Lim responded: [...] "How <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> non-Malays to pour their hearts and souls into the country, and to one day die for it if you keep harping on this? Flag-waving and singing the 'Negaraku' (national anthem) are rituals, while true love for the nation lies in the heart." ...|$|E
500|$|Marcus Söderlund {{directed}} the accompanying music video for [...] "Silvia". It premiered exclusively on NME website in December 2009. A writer for Complex commented, [...] "The vid {{is kind of}} dramatic and hard to make sense of, but what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> from a band like this?" [...] The video plays out in a post-apocalyptic world. It begins with the band's three members waking up from sleeping {{in the middle of}} a street, appearing to be homeless. The men then walk way in the woods while shots of homeless people are interspersed. Several people are seen carrying torches in the woods and are soon joined by the band. They then set fire to a large wooden version of a jackalope and the video ends as it bursts into flames.|$|E

The song, a drum'n'bass version of the theme tune from The Magnificent Seven with vocal samples from DJ Fleka of Serbian radio station B92, was recorded on 4 September 1995. On 5 September 1995, Drummond and Cauty claimed they would [...] "never make any more records". Drummond said, [...] "What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> us to do, go and make a jungle record?"; Cauty added [...] "Yeah, like a jungle novelty record with some strings on it or something. It would just be sad wouldn't it? We're too old." [...] NME gleefully informed their readers, [...] "The K Foundation's contribution to the 'Help' LP is a jungle track." [...] Help was released on 9 September 1995.|$|E

500|$|Other reviewers {{praised the}} character's {{gameplay}} and design. An {{editor for the}} video game website GameZone wrote that his attacks compensated for his appearance and described him as [...] "cool", while also praising both his weapon and fighting style. Adam Sessler and Morgan Webb of X-Play stated that, while Necrid {{did not seem to}} fit the aesthetic, the character did have some appeal. UGO's Doug Trueman stated Necrid's weapon had to be [...] "seen to be believed", and described him among other new characters as [...] " [...] something spectacular to the Soul Calibur pantheon". Tim Rogers of website Insert Credit called Necrid [...] "a work of digital art both in form and function" [...] and added that [...] "as far as console-only characters go—everybody wins with Necrid". Despite their negative remarks, an editor for IGN listed Necrid as eighth on their list of the top ten characters contributed to the Soulcalibur games by designers outside Namco and wrote that while they felt the character's gameplay was unbalanced, it added to Necrid's appeal; the editor wrote [...] "what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> from a man who shares a symbiotic relationship with the very energy that powers Soul Edge? If you needed to clean house in , Necrid was the man for the job." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Toxic" [...] was {{performed}} by Spears at Britney Spears: In the Zone, a concert special that aired in ABC on November 17, 2003. She also performed [...] "Toxic" [...] as the headliner of the Jingle Ball on December 8, 2003, at Staples Center. It was the opening number of her set, and Spears appeared wearing a black top and a white fur cape. While the choreography was deemed as [...] "erotic", Corey Moss of MTV commented {{that some of the}} effect was lost due to Spears's lip synching and a stagehand fixing a prop during the song. On January 24, 2004, Spears opened the 2004 NRJ Music Awards with a performance of [...] "Toxic". During the ceremony, she also presented the NRJ Award of Honor for the Career to Madonna. Spears performed [...] "Toxic" [...] as the opening number of 2004's The Onyx Hotel Tour. Previous {{to the beginning of the}} tour, she deemed it as the song she was most excited to perform, along with [...] "Everytime". After an introduction in which she briefly appeared on a large video screen, Spears took the stage standing on top of a hotel bus, wearing a tight black catsuit. She was surrounded by dancers dressed as employees and columns of LED lighting, suggesting the façade of a glitzy hotel on the Vegas Strip. MTV UK commented, [...] "OK, so she doesn't so much sing than mime along with Toxic, [...] But what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> when she's simultaneously performing a vigorous dance routine, ascending moving staircases and descending fireman poles?".|$|E

2500|$|Bouazizi, {{angered by}} the confrontation, went to the governor's office to {{complain}} and to ask for his scales back. The governor refused to see or listen to him, even after Bouazizi was quoted as saying, [...] "If you don't see me, I'll burn myself." [...] Bouazizi then acquired a can of gasoline from a nearby gas station {{and returned to the}} governor's office. While {{standing in the middle of}} traffic, he shouted, [...] "How <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> me to make a living?" [...] He then doused himself with the gasoline and set himself alight with a match at [...] local time, less than an hour after the altercation.|$|E
2500|$|Lim was {{severely}} criticised by many Malay politicians, including Khairy Jamaluddin, the Prime Minister's son-in-law and Deputy Chairman of the UMNO Youth wing, and Ahmad Shabery Cheek, a prominent Malay Member of Parliament {{from the state}} of Terengganu. The Malay press, most of which is owned by UMNO, also ran articles condemning the questioning of the social contract. Lim was adamant, asking in an interview [...] "How <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> non-Malays to pour their hearts and souls into the country, and to one day die for it if you keep harping on this? Flag-waving and singing the 'Negaraku' (the national anthem) are rituals, while true love for the nation lies in the heart." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a 2012 {{interview}} with Pakistani newspaper Dawn, Dr. Hussain A. Gezari, WHO's special envoy on global polio eradication and primary healthcare, gave {{his views on}} obstacles to eradication. He said the biggest hurdle in making Pakistan polio-free was holding district health officials properly accountable—in national eradication campaigns officials had hired their own relatives, even young children. [...] "How <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> a seven-year-old thumb-sucking kid to implement a polio campaign of the government," [...] said Dr Gezari. He added that, in spite of this, [...] "the first national campaign was initiated by your government in 1994 and that year Pakistan reported 25,000 polio cases, and the number was just 198 last year, which clearly shows that the programme is working." ...|$|E

2500|$|In a major opening chorus, the courtiers {{learn from}} Beatrice's maids {{of the terrible}} torture that {{has been applied to}} Orombello and, [...] "no longer able to {{withstand}} the atrocious suffering, he declared his guilt", thus implicating Beatrice. The Court is summoned and Anichino, Orombello's friend, pleads for Beatrice. Agnese declares that the [...] "longed-for hour of my revenge has come" [...] but, {{at the same time she}} is troubled. Filippo addresses the judges. Beatrice is brought in, and protests: [...] "who gave you the right to judge me?" [...] Orombello then appears and Beatrice is told that she has been denounced. [...] "What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> to gain from lying?" [...] she demands of him. He desperately seeks forgiveness from Beatrice: under torture [...] "my mind became delirious, it was pain, not I that spoke" [...] and he proclaims her innocence to the amazement of all.|$|E
2500|$|French {{at first}} {{reported}} to Kitchener that the German attacks by Fourth and Sixth Armies were their [...] "last card" [...] and the BEF were holding them off. [...] He was unimpressed by Smith-Dorrien telling him (midnight on 25 October) that his Corps [...] "might go during the night", {{although he did}} send reinforcements. Generals Macdonogh and Radcliffe later testified to the Official Historian Edmonds in the early 1920s that French [...] "believed what he wished to believe" [...] and [...] "never could believe that the Germans were not at their last gasp". [...] He thought [...] "everything was going splendidly" [...] and [...] "the Germans were exhausted" [...] until warned of the arrival of German reinforcements, at which point he (allegedly) grew angry and banged his fist on the table shouting [...] "How <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> me to carry out my campaign if you carry on bringing up these blasted divisions?" ...|$|E
2500|$|On September 5, a scout {{attached}} to the Jeff Davis Legion, Sgt. George D. Shadburne, gave a report to Wade Hampton on his reconnaissance behind the Union lines. At about 5 miles east of Grant's headquarters at City Point, a supply depot at Coggins Point on the James River, he found [...] "3,000 beeves , attended by 120 men and 30 citizens, without arms." [...] Just two days earlier, Robert E. Lee had suggested to Hampton that Grant's rear area was [...] "open to attack." [...] On September 14, while Grant was in the Shenandoah Valley conferring with Sheridan, Hampton led about 4,000 men in four brigades southwest from Petersburg along the Boydton Plank Road and followed a looping course through Dinwiddie Court House, Stony Creek Station, and by early morning on September 15 had crossed Blackwater Swamp at Cook's Bridge. At 12 a.m. on September 16, Hampton launched an attack in three columns: Rooney Lee's division on the left against the Union troops camped at Prince George Court House, the brigade of Brig. Gen. James Dearing on the right against Cocke's Mill, and the brigade of Brig. Gen. Thomas L. Rosser and a detachment under Lt. Col. Lovick P. Miller in the center to seize the cattle herd. The surprise attacks met only minimal resistance and by 8 a.m., Hampton's men were driving 2,486 cattle south toward Cook's Bridge. A Union attempt by 2,100 cavalrymen under Brig. Gen. Henry Davies, Jr., to intercept the Confederates and their prize was unsuccessful and Hampton retraced his steps back to Petersburg, turning the cattle over to the Confederate commissary department. For days, the Confederate troops feasted on beef and taunted their Union counterparts across the lines. A visitor to Grant's headquarters asked the general, [...] "When <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> to starve out Lee and capture Richmond?" [...] Grant replied, [...] "Never, if our armies continue to supply him with beef cattle." ...|$|E
