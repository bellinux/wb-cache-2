This paper presents a method for optimal design of switched beam planar antenna arrays based on the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm. Switched beam antenna arrays are a subset of smart antennas that that can enhance the capacity of a cellular system. PSO is a population based algorithm that exploits a set of potential solutions to the optimization problem, which are determined on the basis of social interactions between independent agents. The synthesis problem addressed is to find spatial and feeding configuration of array elements that conform to certain design constraints enforced on multiple diagrams of differentiated <b>directive</b> <b>gains</b> and values (beam forming). Two different fitness functions were evaluated on this basis; results obtained were correlated to requirements of vertical system integration.

In this new scenario, the movements requiring the review of the Data Protection <b>Directive</b> <b>gained</b> a new boost. For the discussion of a possible review of the Directive, the analysis of the concept of personal data is fundamental, because the EU data protection framework has this concept as one of its foundations, since data which are not related to an identified or identifiable person do not fall within the scope of the Data Protection legislation. Taking into account this scenario, this chapter initially analyses the concept of personal data as provided for by Directive 95 / 46 and the views of the Article 29 Working Party and of the European Data Protection Supervisor regarding the concepts of personal data and anonymous data. Then, it concentrates on the experiences of France, Italy and UK, seeking to identify the differences in the concept of personal data in these member states.

40|$|Currently, common {{frequency}} spectrum is densely allocated and {{this leads to}} search for alternative frequency bands. 60 GHz band attracts attention for its potential in future communication. It offers globally available, license-free, very large bandwidth for high data rate communication. At 60 GHz frequency band, severe attenuation of the signals can significantly degrade communication performance. To cope with the attenuation problem, relays or directional antennas with high <b>directive</b> <b>gains</b> can be utilized. Both methods have additional challenges among their benefits. It is analytically and through simulations shown that having a relay node {{in the middle of}} a 60 GHz network decreases the average free-space path loss 33 % in the worst case scenario. To the best of our knowledge this is the first study to address effect of relay on path loss analytically in a generic form. When network nodes use directional antennas, the neighbor discovery process becomes more complicated and time consuming. There are not many studies assuming pure directional transmission and reception at all steps of communication. Random selection among sectors is generally used for pure directional communication. To reduce the neighbor discovery time, we propose a smart neighbor scanning algorithm in this work. It is observed that the proposed strategy discovers 70 % of the links 81 % faster and 90 % of the links 15 % faster than random scanning strategy for a typical home network scenario. A condition to have a path between any two nodes and a stochastic model to observe isolation trend in home networks are also presented.

At those frequencies, the free space propagation loss and shadowing (from buildings, vegetation {{or any kind}} of obstacles) are far stronger than in the traditional radio cellular spectrum. Therefore, the cell range is expected to be limited to 50 - 100 meters, and <b>directive</b> high <b>gain</b> antennas are required at least for the base stations. This paper investigates the kind of topology that is required to serve a suburban area with a small-cell network operating at 60 GHz and equipped with beam-steering antennas.

Insertion of MMIC technology into antenna systems, particularly at millimeter wave frequencies using low power and low noise amplifiers in closed proximity to the radiating elements, offers a significant improvement in the array transmit efficiency, receive system noise figure, and overall array reliability. Application of active array technology also leads to the use of advanced beamforming techniques that can improve beam agility, diversity, and adaptivity to complex signal environments. The objective of this program was to demonstrate the technical feasibility of the 'tile' array packaging architecture at EHF via the insertion of 1990 MMIC technology into a functional tile array or subarray module. The means test of this objective was to demonstrate and deliver to NASA a minimum of two 4 x 4 (16 radiating element) subarray modules operating in a transmit mode at 29. 6 GHz. Available (1990) MMIC technology was chosen to focus the program effort on the novel interconnect schemes and packaging requirements rather than focusing on MMIC development.

To realize this potential, advanced spacecraft technologies are required, such as uplink coverage through high <b>gain</b> <b>directive</b> beams, onboard signal processing, and downlink beam hopping. Simultaneous worldwide uplink coverage could be obtained via many narrow uplink antenna beams which collectively cover the earth field-of-view. When worldwide communications traffic is low volume, a reduction in space segment impact can be achieved by using a few narrow uplink antenna beams to provide the required service. To minimize delays, these beams must be able to rapidly point anywhere within the field-ofview to cover individual users who require a channel for brief communications. The agile antenna beams can be shared through demand assignment techniques. A multimode common transmission format can provide both data and control channels. The data channels are available at several rates to allow either full duty cycle data transmission or burst data transmission. With burst transmissions, a single beam can support multiple calls in a time division multiplexed fashion. The control channels are utilized in coordinating the use of satellite resources to efficiently meet the communications needs of the users.

50|$|<b>Directive</b> <b>gain</b> or {{directivity}} is {{a different}} measure which does not take an antenna's electrical efficiency into account.

50|$|If only {{a certain}} {{portion of the}} {{electrical}} power received from the transmitter is actually radiated by the antenna (i.e. less than 100% efficiency), then the <b>directive</b> <b>gain</b> compares the power radiated in a given direction to that reduced power (instead of the total power received), ignoring the inefficiency. The directivity is therefore the maximum <b>directive</b> <b>gain</b> when taken over all directions, and is always at least 1. On the other hand, the power gain {{takes into account the}} poorer efficiency by comparing the radiated power in a given direction to the actual power that the antenna receives from the transmitter, which makes it a more useful figure of merit for the antenna's contribution to the ability of a transmitter in sending a radio wave toward a receiver. In every direction, the power gain of an isotropic antenna is equal to the efficiency, and hence is always at most 1, though it can and ideally should exceed 1 for a directional antenna.|$|E
50|$|The {{definition}} of antenna gain or power gain already includes {{the effect of}} the antenna's efficiency. Therefore, if one is trying to radiate a signal toward a receiver using a transmitter of a given power, one need only compare the gain of various antennas rather than considering the efficiency as well. This is likewise true for a receiving antenna at very high (especially microwave) frequencies, where the point is to receive a signal which is strong compared to the receiver's noise temperature. However, {{in the case of a}} directional antenna used for receiving signals with the intention of rejecting interference from different directions, one is no longer concerned with the antenna efficiency, as discussed above. In this case, rather than quoting the antenna gain, one would be more concerned with the <b>directive</b> <b>gain</b> which does not include the effect of antenna (in)efficiency. The <b>directive</b> <b>gain</b> of an antenna can be computed from the published gain divided by the antenna's efficiency.|$|E

50|$|Microstrip antennas are {{relatively}} inexpensive to manufacture and design {{because of the}} simple 2-dimensional physical geometry.

It is relatively easy to print an array of patches on a single (large) substrate using lithographic techniques. Patch arrays can provide much higher gains than a single patch at little additional cost; matching and phase adjustment can be performed with printed microstrip feed structures, again in the same operations that form the radiating patches. The ability to create high gain arrays in a low-profile antenna is one reason that patch arrays are common on airplanes and in other military applications.|$|E
