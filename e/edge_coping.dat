50|$|The {{octagonal}} sandstone {{and timber}} tower, {{to the east}} of the entrance porch, extends through two levels of the building and is surmounted by a belfry. Openings to the ground floor level of the tower are elongated rectangular windows filled with stained glass, and to the upper level are triangular headed windows, with similarly shaped hood mouldings joined at the intersections of the faces of the tower. The first floor of the tower is expressed with a string course, above which is a moulded course which is repeated above the first floor windows. A battlemented <b>edge</b> <b>coping</b> surrounds the top of the sandstone section of the tower. Surmounting this, is a timber extension recessed {{from the edge of the}} sandstone section and with timber louvred trefoil lancet openings. The tower is roofed with a lead sheeted onion dome, with expressed ribs and surmounted by a Latin cross made from metal.|$|E
40|$|The {{role of a}} roof on any {{building}} is to separate the interior environment of the building from the exterior environment, thereby making it a crucial component of the building design. Metal roof edges are {{the first line of}} defense against wind-induced loads on the roof system; however, data on the nature of these loads acting on the roof edge system is scarce. Previous studies with field measurements of wind pressure acting on the roof edge reported that metal flashings experienced negative pressure. These findings suggest that current building codes in North America (i. e. NBCC and ASCE codes) do not accurately identify wind design loads acting on roof edge systems. The Roof Edge Systems and Technologies (REST) project is a consortium of academia, government and roof industries, which was created to develop testing protocols and design guidelines for roof edges. The work presented in this thesis contributes to the collection and analysis of wind loads acting on metal roof edges, which were installed on the Canada Post building in Vancouver, Canada. The thesis presents the findings and analysis of the measured wind-induced pressure acting on all surfaces of three different edge configurations, namely the Anchor Clip Configuration (ACC), Continuous Cleat Configuration (CCC) and Discontinuous Cleat Configuration (DCC). The analysis showed the presence of negative pressure acting on all three faces of the configurations, in which the type of configuration had minimum effect on the magnitude and nature of the wind-induced loads. Furthermore, the top face of the edge configurations was found to experience the highest suction, and the front face of the <b>edge</b> <b>coping</b> was subjected to a net outward suction force due to the combination of the suction experienced by the coping front face and the positive pressure acting on the cleat. Comparison of these results with current NBCC and ASCE building codes highlight a need to update these codes in order to adequately design metal roof edges against wind action...|$|E

40|$|Abstract – In {{this paper}} {{congestion}} control over different time scales {{has been investigated}} to support data transport over a switched optical packet LAN. An innovative local access control protocol {{has been designed to}} shape different traffic sources to produce smoothed optical packet traffic which has a constant inter-arrival time. This protocol employs a centralized scheduling and resource allocation scheme, coupled with congestion control distributed to the <b>edges.</b> To <b>cope</b> with bursty traffic the network utilizes a feedback-based technique to implement service re-negotiation. This congestion control in the lower network layers operates synergistically with the TCP window-sized end-to-end admission control to deliver good traffic management and network efficiency. Network models have been built and the simulations carried out to validate the research and evaluate the network performance...|$|R
40|$|Globalization and {{privatization}} policies {{compel the}} banking sector to reform and adjust {{to have a}} competitive <b>edge</b> to <b>cope</b> with highly dynamic business environment. Owing to these changes, the private sector banking sector employees are experiencing {{a high level of}} pressure and stress. The work pressure, poor work environment, inequitable work distribution and lack of concentration are the sources of stress for employees are private sector banks. The results show that there is significant difference between socio-economic profile of employees and source of stress in private sector banks. The work pressure, inequitable work distribution, poor work environment and lack of concentration are positively and significantly influencing the level of stress of employees in private sector banks. To reduce the stress among employees during work, the private sector banks should provide conducive work environment. The private sector banks should motivate and generate interest among employees in work to avoid boredom through proper job rotation and efficiently use skills and knowledge of their employees...|$|R

50|$|In the {{simplest}} sand casting procedure, the drag is placed {{upside down on}} a board, around a pattern of the part to be cast. The pattern {{is a model of}} the desired casting. Talcum powder is often dusted over the pattern to aid in the removal of the pattern. Sand is sifted over the pattern until the model is covered by a few inches of sand. More sand is then dumped into the drag, and rammed with a wooden wedge, or mechanically vibrated to pack the sand down. The sand is then struck level with the top <b>edge</b> of the <b>cope,</b> using a wooden or metal strake. A board is then placed on top of the drag and the drag is flipped over.|$|R
30|$|The {{height of}} the track above the wing support {{bearings}} (due to the {{height of the}} wing girders, the FPS bearings, bearer bars, and rail fasteners) modifies the kinematics of the idealized system described previously. The twist of the wing girders leads to an additional vertical displacement of the yoke curves caused by the rigid body rotation of the wing girder, and the yoke curves translate toward or away from one another, depending on the direction of twist. A similar coupling of rotation and vertical movement occurs at the FPS bearings, due to their curved sliding interfaces. These can both be considered second-order effects and were minimized in the floating bridge application by limiting {{the height of the}} components of the system. This was achieved by using a thin wing girder along the bearing yoke surface that was stiffened by an <b>edge</b> beam and <b>coping</b> the ends of the bearer bars where they connected to the friction pendulum bearings.|$|R
40|$|Wind-induced damages on low-slope roofs are a {{major and}} common problem that many {{buildings}} located in high wind areas suffer from. Most of these damages are initiated when the metal roof edge fails first, leading to overall roof failure. This is because peak wind pressures occur at the edges and corners of low-slope roof buildings. Currently, {{there are not enough}} wind design guidelines for the Canadian roofing community to quantify the dynamic wind uplift resistance of the roof edge system. The objective of this research is to evaluate the effect of wind-induced loads on roof edges using a finite element model, verify the numerical results with those obtained from controlled experiments, and perform parametric investigations for various design variables. In this research, the overall roof edge system was modelled using the commercial finite element software package ABAQUS, by simulating the roof edge system with shell elements and applying a uniform static pressure against the face of the <b>edge</b> cleat or <b>coping.</b> Results of the modelling were compared to the experimental ones in terms of deflection of the coping under uniform pressure. The results of the numerical model and the experiments show a good agreement. Furthermore, a parametric analysis of the system was conducted under the effect of varying parameters. i. e., coping gauge, nail spacing, coping and cleat length and wind and thermal load application...|$|R
40|$|Nowadays total inlet {{temperature}} of gas turbine is {{far above the}} permissible metal temperature; as a consequence, advanced cooling techniques must be applied to protect from thermal stresses, oxidation and corrosion the components located in the high pressure stages, such as the blade trailing edge. A suitable design of the cooling system for the trailing <b>edge</b> has to <b>cope</b> with geometric constraints and aerodynamic demands; state-of-the-art of cooling concepts often use film cooling on blade pressure side: the air taken from last compressor stages is ejected through discrete holes or slots to provide a cold layer between hot mainstream and the blade surface. With the goal of ensuring a satisfactory lifetime of blades, the design of efficient trailing edge film cooling schemes and, moreover, the possibility to check carefully their behavior, are hence necessary to guarantee an appropriate metal temperature distribution. For this purpose an experimental survey was carried out to investigate the film covering performance of different pressure side trailing edge cooling systems for turbine blades. The experimental test section consists of a scaled-up trailing edge model installed in an open loop suction type test rig. Measurements of adiabatic effectiveness distributions were carried out on three trailing edge cooling system configurations. The baseline geometry is composed by inclined slots separated by elongated pedestals; the second geometry shares the same cutback configuration, with an additional row of circular film cooling holes located upstream; the third model is equipped with three rows of in-line film cooling holes. Experiments have been performed at nearly ambient conditions imposing several blowing ratio values and using carbon dioxide as coolant in order to reproduce a density ratio close to the engine conditions (DR= 1. 52). To extend {{the validity of the}} survey a comparison between adiabatic effectiveness measurements and a prediction by correlative approach was performed to compare the experimental results with 1 D methodologies...|$|R
40|$|Context: Discrepancies at the abutment/crown {{interface}} {{can affect}} the longevity of zirconia restorations. Aim: The aim was to evaluate the marginal and internal discrepancies (MD and ID) of zirconia copings manufactured by two milling systems with different finish lines. Materials and Methods : Three aluminum-master-dies (h = 5. 5 mm; Ψ = 7. 5 mm; 6 ΀), with different finish lines (large chamfer [LC]; tilted chamfer [TC]; rounded shoulder [RS]) were fabricated. Twenty impressions were made from each master die and poured. Sixty zirconia copings were manufactured and divided according to the factors "finish line" and "milling system" (n = 10) : CAD LC = Computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) + LC; CAD TC = CAD/CAM + TC; CAD RS = CAD/CAM + RS; MAD LC = manually aided design/manually aided manufacturing (MAD/MAM) + LC; MAD TC = MAD/MAM + TC; and MAD RS = MAD/MAM + RS. For MD analysis, each coping was fixed, and {{the distance between the}} external <b>edges</b> of the <b>coping</b> and the <b>edge</b> of the cervical preparation was measured (50 points). Using the same copings, the ID of each coping was evaluated, by the replica technique, at 12 points equally distributed among the regions (n = 10) : Ray (R), axial (A), and occlusal (Occl). The measurements were performed by optical microscopy (Χ 250). The data (μm) were subjected to parametric and non-parametric statistical analyses. Results: For the MAD/MAM system, the "finish line" (P = 0. 0001) affected significantly the MD median values (μm) : LC = 251. 80 a, RS = 68. 40 a and TC = 8. 10 b (Dunn′s test). For the CAD/CAM system, the median MD values (μm) were not affected by the factor "finish line" (P = 0. 4037) : LC = 0. 82 a, RS = 0. 52 a, and TC = 0. 89 a. For the ID, it was observed interaction between the finish line types and the region (P = 0. 0001) and between region and milling system (P = 0. 0031) (RM-ANOVA). Conclusions: The CAD/CAM system presented lower MD values, regardless the finish line. However, the MAD/MAM system showed ID values smaller than those of CAD/CAM...|$|R
40|$|Integrated circuit (IC) {{industry}} in Taiwan has unique industrial structure l specialization and a comprehensive environment for industrial cluster. The IC design industry has made considerable progress in last decade. Nevertheless, as competition becomes fiercer, {{product life cycle}} becomes shorter, companies were forced into direct confrontation {{with each other and}} saw disparate results. Therefore, enterprises must be fully informed of the overall market and technology development trends of the industry, in order to maintain competitive <b>edge</b> and <b>cope</b> with emerging challenges. In this study, we examine IC design companies listed in ITIS before the end of year 2007, and collect patent data from 1997 to 2007 from USPTO database and use Patent Guider to analyze. Also, it is to categorize IC design {{industry in}}to four areas, that are communication, Consumer electronics, information and industrial & others, totally 12 observations. Based on analysis of the cross patent and industrial data, this study seeks to find the relationship between technology of patent data and product life cycle. Furthermore, the citation of patent will be used to examine the quality of patent, and the influence on innovative activities. This paper found that, the patent activities of Taiwan's IC design industry has different ability to drive product life cycle change according to different product areas. Furthermore, the quality of patent is not enough, most of patents are defense patent. However, the analysis result shows that patent's impact on each product area is increasing. 處在IC半導體產業鏈最上游的IC設計公司，是高度智慧技術密集的一項產業，故如何利用良好的專利制度來保護公司的關鍵技術，變顯得十分重要。 IC產業產品的產品生命週期短，各家公司無不希望能夠將最重要的資源放在報酬回報最高的地方，而良好的專利佈局可以幫助公司掌握關鍵技術，快速因應市場需求的變化。 本研究藉由台灣各領域別IC設計公司（通訊、消費性電子、資訊、工業等四類）之專利活動的軌跡與產品生命週期，找出其相對應的關聯性。另一目的為，了解台灣的IC設計公司所擁有之專利技術的品質，探討其對新世代產品的擴散效益。最後，探討台灣IC設計公司的專利技術，是否為IC設計公司市場成功的關鍵因素。 透過次級資料的蒐集將台灣IC設計產業的應用領域，分類成四大領域專業設計廠商，分別為資訊、通訊、消費性電子及工業領域，共計 12 間廠商，並透過專利檢索搜尋台灣IC設計公司所擁有的專利技術，並專利分析了解台灣IC設計產業專利技術現況。 本研究之研究結果發現，台灣IC設計產業專利活動，依照不同的領域，對於驅動產品生命週期交替的能力不一，網路通訊領域傾向為市場中的技術領先者；而消費性電子領域和資訊周邊領域為技術跟隨者。 另外，台灣IC設計產業之目前之專利品質仍然不足，多屬於防禦型之專利，但由分析結果可以發現，在各個領域中的影響力已逐日提升。未來若更能提升自身在技術領域中的影響力，成為產業中的領導者便更能主導產品世代的替換。目錄 第一章 緒論 1 第一節 研究背景 1 第二節 研究動機 2 第三節 研究目的 5 第二章 文獻探討 6 第一節 產品生命週期 6 第二節 專利分析 10 第三節 IC設計產業 16 第四節 IC設計產業產品生命週期 20 第五節 IC設計產品領域分類 23 第三章 研究方法 26 第一節 研究架構 26 第二節 研究流程 28 第三節 研究指標定義 29 第四節 研究指標資料來源 31 第五節 研究範圍與工具 32 第四章 研究結果與討論 36 第一節 基本資料分析 37 第二節 台灣IC設計產業產品生命週期 38 第三節 專利分析 39 第四節 產品生命週期與專利活動之相關分析 41 第五節 IC設計產業專利技術品質 45 第六節 討論 53 第五章 結論 56 第一節 產業技術層面 56 第二節 學、研機構技術供給面 57 第三節 產品市場層面 57 第四節 研究限制 57 第五節 後續研究建議 58 參考文獻 59 表目錄 表 1 - 1 台灣IC產業產值彙整 2 表 2 - 1 不同生命週期影響的組織層級 7 表 2 - 2 生命週期理論彙整 8 表 2 - 3 各階段產品生命週期市場策略 10 表 2 - 4 CHI研究公司指標 15 表 2 - 5 IC設計產品領域分類 24 表 2 - 6 IC設計產業應用產品市值 (單位:%) 24 表 2 - 7 產品生命週期之專利策略應用 25 表 3 - 1 專利活動指標彙整 30 表 3 - 2 研究指標資料來源彙整 31 表 3 - 3 2007 年台灣前二十大IC設計公司 32 表 3 - 4 篩選後符合樣本設計之樣本廠商彙整 34 表 4 - 1 台灣IC設計依產品分類之廠商 37 表 4 - 2 各產品領域廠商之技術範圍 45 表 4 - 3 專利引證數目分析結果 49 表 4 - 4 專利被引證數目分析結果 50 表 4 - 5 專利技術之科學關連性分析結果 50 表 4 - 6 四大領域專利技術強度 52 圖目錄 圖 1 - 1 台灣IC設計產業美國專利件數趨勢圖 4 圖 2 - 1 產品生命週期成長趨勢圖 9 圖 2 - 2 台灣IC產業 產業鏈 17 圖 2 - 3 IC產品產品生命週期圖 22 圖 3 - 1 研究架構 27 圖 3 - 2 研究流程 28 圖 4 - 1 台灣IC設計產業四大產品類別之產品生命週期 38 圖 4 - 2 台灣IC設計公司專利申請趨勢 39 圖 4 - 3 專利申請成長趨勢 40 圖 4 - 4 ：網路通訊類廠商之產品生命週期與專利活動之關係 41 圖 4 - 5 消費性電子類廠商之產品生命週期與專利活動之關係 42 圖 4 - 6 消費性電子類廠商之產品生命週期與專利活動之關係 43 圖 4 - 7 工業及其他類廠商之產品生命週期與專利活動之關係 44 圖 4 - 8 網路通訊類各年度技術範圍技術分佈 46 圖 4 - 9 消費性電子類各年度技術範圍技術分佈 47 圖 4 - 10 資訊週邊類各年度技術範圍技術分佈 48 圖 4 - 11 專利技術當前影響力趨勢圖 51 圖 4 - 12 四大領域技術強度趨勢圖 5...|$|R
