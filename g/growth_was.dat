Catch-up <b>growth</b> <b>is</b> considered an important criterion for evaluating nursing preterm infants. Formation of catch-up <b>growth</b> <b>is</b> seen as a favorable outcome.

Growth curves help to determine when the catch-up growth begins. After discharge from the hospital catch-up growth continues. Catch-up growth occurs within the first year of life.
