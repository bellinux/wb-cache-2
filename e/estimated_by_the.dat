5|$|At the 2010 Census, {{there were}} 1,585,873 {{people living in}} Manhattan, an {{increase}} of 3.2% since 2000. Since 2010, Manhattan's population was <b>estimated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Census Bureau to have increased 3.7% to 1,644,518 , representing 19.3% of New York City's population and 8.3% of New York State's population. As of the 2000 Census, the population density of New York County was 66,940 per square mile (25,846/km²), the highest population density of any county in the United States. If 2012 census estimates were accurate, the population density then approximated 70,518 people per square mile (27,227/km²). In 1910, {{at the height of}} European immigration to New York, Manhattan's population density reached a peak of 101,548 people per squaremile (39,208/km²).|$|E

5|$|Madame Schmidt did {{not talk}} about the matter even after the war. She died in 1954 at the age of 71 without {{revealing}} the identity of any of her former employees. Total number of Gestapo recordings from the brothel was <b>estimated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Stasi (East German Security Service) to be about 25,000.

According to a 2005 article in Die Tageszeitung, the brothel continued to exist after World War II under the management of Schmidt's son and daughter. In the 1990s, it was turned into a home for asylum-seekers, which was closed soon after because of local protest against the residents.|$|E

After engineers detonated three mines prepared near Turkish communications trenches, the storming party captured the Turkish trench following a bayonet charge, with the loss of one officer and 36 other ranks killed. Seventy-three other members of the battalion were wounded during the attack, including Leane, who was mentioned in despatches.

5|$|Rapidly {{weakening}} over land, Imbudo {{emerged into}} the South China Sea {{about six hours}} after landfall. The JTWC estimated winds had decreased to 150km/h (90mph), although the agency estimated Imbudo quickly re-intensified to a secondary peak of 165km/h (105mph) in 1minute winds. Dry air prevented convection from redeveloping significantly, and the eye had become large over open waters. At 0300UTC on July24, Imbudo made its final landfall west of Macau, near Yangjiang, Guangdong. It was the strongest to hit the province since Typhoon Sally in 1996, striking China with 10minute winds of 140km/h (85mph), as <b>estimated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> JMA. The storm rapidly weakened over land while moving over southern China. Late on July25, Imbudo dissipated near the border of China and Vietnam.|$|E

5|$|Worldwide {{identified}} {{reserves in}} 2008 were <b>estimated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> US Geological Survey (USGS) to be 13 million tonnes, though an accurate estimate of world lithium reserves is difficult. One {{reason for this}} is that most lithium classification schemes are developed for solid ore deposits, whereas brine is a fluid that is problematic to treat with the same classification scheme due to varying concentrations and pumping effects. The world has been estimated to contain about 15 million tonnes of lithium reserves, while 65 million tonnes of known resources are reasonable. A total of 75% of everything can typically be found in the ten largest deposits of the world. Another study noted that 83% of the geological resources of lithium are located in six brine, two pegmatite, and two sedimentary deposits.|$|E
5|$|According to a 2011 study {{conducted}} at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and the University of California Berkeley, the currently estimated reserve base of lithium {{should not be}} a limiting factor for large-scale battery production for electric vehicles, as the study estimated that on the order of 1 billion 40 kWh Li-based batteries (about 10kg of lithium per car) could be built with current reserves, as <b>estimated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> U.S. Geological Survey. Another 2011 study by researchers from the University of Michigan and Ford Motor Company found that there are sufficient lithium resources to support global demand until 2100, including the lithium required for the potential widespread use of hybrid electric, plug-in hybrid electric and battery electric vehicles. The study estimated global lithium reserves at 39 million tons, and total demand for lithium during the 90-year period analyzed at 12–20 million tons, depending on the scenarios regarding economic growth and recycling rates.|$|E

5|$|Another {{approach}} ignores {{energy and}} deals {{only with the}} molecular complexity <b>estimated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> information entropy index. It speculates that the points of several natural compounds (urea, pyrimidine, dihydroxyacetone, uracil, cytosine, glycine, and alanine) fall into {{the range of the}} values typical for the known interstellar molecules that indicates high probability of their detection in interstellar environment. Additionally the molecules with maximal information entropy, i.e. the most complex compounds, make up approximately a half of the interstellar set and their percentage is decreased with the size. This trend may be associated with the different stabilities of the molecules with uniform (usually more stable) and diversified (usually less stable) chemical structures, so the detectable molecules with a large size must possess symmetric structure more probably than non-symmetric. The remarkable detection of low-entropy (highly symmetric) fullerene molecules supports this assumption. It is also noted that information entropy reflects the depth of hydrogenation of interstellar entities: the molecules with maximal information entropy are hydrogen-poor whereas the others are mainly hydrogen-rich.|$|E
5|$|At 08:20 on {{the morning}} of 25 July the Chinese again {{assaulted}} the US Marines on Hill 119 in company strength but were soon halted by American artillery and mortar fire which inflicted heavy losses; skirmishing continued {{for the remainder of the}} day. While no major assaults against Hill 111 occurred, a heavy barrage by the Chinese targeted the position at 11:00. F9F Panthers provided air support to the Marines throughout the day, while American tanks continued to engage Chinese targets in support of the defenders on Hill 111 and Boulder City. Finally, at 13:35 the last of the Chinese infantry were forced off the forward slopes of Boulder City by the US Marines. Chinese casualties were <b>estimated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Americans to have included another 75 killed and 425 wounded. The Chinese continued to heavily shell the American positions, and by late afternoon 13,500 mortar and artillery rounds had fallen on the sector held by US 7th Marine Regiment. The Americans fired many counter-battery missions in response, firing 36,794 rounds. The ongoing relief of the US 7th Marine Regiment continued throughout the day. Meanwhile, the Australian positions on The Hook were also heavily shelled throughout the day, forcing many of the defenders underground into the network of tunnels then being extended by a team of New Zealand sappers.|$|E

The JTWC estimated higher 1‑minute winds of around 240km/h (150mph), making Omar a super typhoon. Two days later, the typhoon came {{close enough to the}} Philippines to warrant monitoring from PAGASA, who named the storm Lusing. By 1500UTC on September3, the JMA downgraded Omar to a tropical storm, although the JTWC maintained its typhoon intensity through the next day. Heading generally westward, the storm made landfall on the east coast of Taiwan near Hualien City on September4. After traversing the island in seven hours, Omar exited the coast of Yunlin County and emerged into the Taiwan Strait. The storm crossed the body of water and moved ashore in eastern China near Xiamen, Fujian, on September5. Inland, Omar quickly degenerated into a tropical depression before turning west-southwest. It proceeded across southern China while heavily weakening, and completely dissipated over northern Vietnam on September9.|$|E
