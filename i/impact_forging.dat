As for machining process, the materials being considered in screw manufacturing were low carbon steel, stainless steel, titanium alloy, aluminium alloy, magnesium alloy and cast iron. The information of environmental impact are generated by SolidWorks. Sustainability tool was used in the formation of pair-wise comparison matrices for Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP).

Hot forging trials in screw press with double truncated cones were carried out at three different temperatures, 950, 1050 & 1150 °C. The microstructure in the as-preheated condition was analysed {{in order to understand}} the impact of soaking temperature on the evolution of both grain size and precipitates/carbides prior to hot forging operations. In the as-forged condition, the <b>impact</b> of <b>forging</b> temperature, strain, strain rate and chilling effect of the dies on the microstructural evolution of Nimonic 80 a was studied. No evidences of shear bands or flow localisation associated to adiabatic heating were found in the hot forged double truncated cones, indicating the suitability of Nimonic 80 a to be processed in screw press. However, the non-isothermal conditions of screw press resulted into the development of heterogeneous structures across the thickness. Highly or fully unrecrystallized structures were observed in those areas in contact with bottom die, in contrast with top positions, where highly recrystallized structures were found. Soaking treatments play a very important role on microstructural evolution during hot forging for Nimonic 80 a due to its strong impact on both grain growth and dissolution/precipitation of precipitates/carbides. For the present work, discontinuous dynamic recrystallization (DDRX) was found to be the main recrystallization mechanism for Nimonic 80 a. Clear evidences of nucleation of new DRX grains by the formation of bulges in serrated grain boundaries with the subsequent growth by twinning were observed at the three forging temperatures.

40|$|Centralized {{manufacturing}} and distributed manufacturing are two fundamentally different methods for producing components. This work describes a centralized manufacturing {{scenario in which}} parts are produced via forging and finish machining at one central location and are then shipped to the end user. The distributed manufacturing model involves a scenario in which an additive manufacturing process (Electron Beam Melting) is used to produce parts to near net shape with minimal finish machining. Because the process doesn 2 ̆ 7 t require molds or dies, production can take place in small production quantities 2 ̆ 2 on demand 2 ̆ 2 at job shops located {{close to the end}} user with little transportation. In other words, parts are not produced until they are needed. This is {{in stark contrast to the}} centralized model where large quantities of parts are produced and then distributed at a later date when needed from warehouses. The aim of this thesis is to compare the environmental impact of these two different production approaches under a variety of conditions. The SimaPro software package has been used to model both approaches with input from the user involving part size, amount of finish machining, transportation distances, mode of transportation, production quantities, etc. Results from simulation models indicate that at small production quantities, the environmental <b>impact</b> of <b>forging</b> die production dominates the centralized manufacturing model. As production quantity increases, finish machining begins to dominate the environmental impact. Despite the large transportation distances involved, the transportation distance and mode of transportation actually have relatively little impact on overall environmental impact compared with other factors. Regardless of the production scenario being evaluated, the distributed manufacturing approach had less environmental impact. The production of titanium powder as the raw material contributed the majority of environmental impact for this approach. Although this work examines environmental impact, it does not consider the cost of producing a part. It should be pointed out, however, that the distributed manufacturing approach could someday have a profound effect on supply chain management for replacement parts by reducing or eliminating the need for warehouses along with associated inventory carrying costs, product obsolescence costs, heating and cooling energy, etc...|$|R

Over half of the children living with one of these conditions are without a molecular diagnosis because of the rarity of the disease, the marked clinical heterogeneity, and the reality that there are thousands of rare diseases for which causative mutations have yet to be identified. It is in this context that in 2010 a Canadian consortium was formed to rapidly identify mutations causing a wide spectrum of pediatric-onset rare diseases by using whole-exome sequencing. The FORGE (Finding of Rare Disease Genes) Canada Consortium brought together clinicians and scientists from 21 genetics centers and three science and technology innovation centers from across Canada.

A weight loss competition is one way to address weight management in police work. Among the factors to consider is gender <b>impact,</b> as females <b>forge</b> forward within a male environment. Also, assessing weight loss among obesity categories is essential for designing effective programing. Purpose: To compare mass changes among body mass index (BMI) categories and between genders at biweekly weigh-ins during a 12 -week competition with recommendations for professionals. Methods: Before the competition began, the participants were instructed that those teams recording greatest percentage loss won. Body mass (body weight) comparisons were made between genders and among BMI categories. Results: Mean body mass lost for the 225 officers was 5. 26 kg. Genders had similar mass losses. Normal and overweight BMI classes had significantly (p ≤ 0. 05) less body mass changes than obese classes. In weeks 2 to 4, the extreme obese category experienced greatest losses. No differences were found in amount of loss among any of the groups from weeks 6 to 12. Conclusion: This multiple-site, large-scale and low-cost intervention specific to police was successful. The program had equivalent gender impact in terms of mass lost. In {{the second half of the}} program, the higher BMI groups did not lose significantly more than the lower BMI groups indicating physiological and/or motivational effects to be addressed in future programs...|$|R
40|$|Rotary forging is an {{attractive}} incremental metal forming with many advantages over any other processes, requiring smaller deformation force and providing high accuracy (near-net-process). The main applications of rotary forging process include families of bevel and helical gears, and flanged components for transmissions such as disk, rollers, wheels, etc. The main aim of this work is to study the <b>impact</b> of rotary <b>forging</b> process on the microstructural and texture evolution of high-strength materials, and martensitic stainless steels in particular, during cold rotary forging process. Jethete M 152 alloy is a cold formable 13 %-Cr martensitic stainless steel used in the aerospace industry. Jethete M 152 flanged test-pieces were rotary forged at room temperature. The process was interrupted at 4 intermediate steps, providing flange reductions of 25, 30, 50, 65 and 70 %. A complex grain flow and inhomogeneous deformation patterns are developed during rotary forging, characterized mainly by {{the formation of a}} strong deformation band which run parallel to the bottom die. A transition from asymmetrical bulging (inverted mushroom) to symmetrical bulging was observed {{as a result of the}} initial lower contact area of the preform with the bottom die. From microstructural analysis by EBSD, the lath structure of Jethete M 152 is gradually reoriented and changes it shape in a direction parallel to the compression plane, developing a lamellar/pancake structure in those positions with maximum deformation. These microstructural changes are accompanied with the development of a strong texture formed by a duplex + fibers aligned with the compression axis, being the fiber the stronger one. These findings are in good agreement with uniaxial compression for bcc metals. The analysis of the Orientation Distribution Figures (ODF) reveals that 4 main texture components are formed in the course of the rotary forging process: Brass { 110 }〈 112 〉, L { 110 }〈 110 〉, I { 112 }〈 110 〉, and Cube { 001 }〈 100 〉.

We elucidate here the <b>impact</b> of multiaxial <b>forging</b> of Mg- 2 Zn- 2 Gd alloy on grain refinement to sub-micron regime and relate the structure to mechanical properties and biological functionality. As-cast and annealed samples were multiaxial forged (MAF) for a total number of two passes with a true strain of ~ 2 /pass. Considering that the microstructure governs the biological response of materials, we studied the constituents of the microstructure in conjunction with the mechanical behavior. The antimicrobial behavior in a Mg- 2 Zn- 2 Gd alloy with different grain size in the range of ~ 44 µm to ~ 710 nm was studied by seeding. Surface energy and contact angle measurements using goniometer and wettability were assessed with water, SBF, n-Hexane, and DMEM. The structure-property relationship in Mg- 2 Zn- 2 Gd alloy to maintaining mechanical integrity during degradation was studied by seeding Escherichia coli (E. coli). Furthermore, we studied the effect of degradation behavior in the presence and absence of cells. This was followed by the study of bioactivity in terms of phases present on the surface and degradation products in simulated body fluid (SBF). Magnesium coated with apatite using a biomimetic approach were placed in a 24 -well culture plate with α-MEM media and the degradation behavior was studied in the absence and presence of cells (seeding density: 10, 000 cells/cm 2). The change in pH was monitored at regular intervals. Cell attachment was studied by seeding the cells for 4 h and cell viability was studied by seeding the cells for up to 1, 3, and 7 days. The study underscores that the fine-grained alloys exhibited superior mechanical properties, antimicrobial resistance, and cell attachment. The degradation rate was also least for fine-grained alloy. The higher surface energy of ultrafine-grained Mg- 2 Zn- 2 Gd alloy led to the release of more Mg+ 2 ions at an early stage, which consequently increased the pH of the fluid {{in the vicinity of the}} implant, therefore producing an unfavorable environment for the survival of bacteria. This led to damage of bacterial cell walls and reducing their adhesion. Furthermore, a significant degree of apatite formation was an indication of high bioactivity and cell attachment along with controlled degradation in the ultrafine-grained alloy. Thus, the reduction in grain size significantly improved load bearing capacity and biological functionality of Mg- 2 Zn- 2 Gd alloy. ...|$|R
40|$|Cold {{rotary forging}} is an {{innovative}} incremental metal forming process whose main characteristic {{is that the}} workpiece is only partially in contact with a conical tool, reducing therefore the required forging loads. However, in spite of many benefits of such a process, wide industrial implementation of rotary forging is not possible without proper understanding of material behaviour. In the present work, the capability of rotary forging process was explored for the manufacturing of flared cylindrical parts by cold forming. Another main aim {{was to assess the}} cold formability of high-strength materials for aerospace applications (martensitic stainless steels) under incremental processes. In order to understand the <b>impact</b> of rotary <b>forging</b> on the final properties of formed components, microstructural and mechanical analysis were performed. Microstructural and hardness analysis were conducted on both axial and transverse sections along the cold formed flange in order to study the grain flow orientation and strain distribution. In a similar fashion, mechanical test specimens were machined from different positions and orientations along the rotary forged component. Further analysis was performed on the components in the as-treated condition {{in order to understand the}} response of cold-worked Jethete M 152 components to subsequent heat treatments. Microstructural and hardness analysis clearly reveals a strong grain reorientation and strain localization around “pickup” defects (material attached to the upper tool) observed on the flange top surface, close to the flange edge. These results suggest that an excessive deformation is localized during the early stages of the flange formation. Another characteristic feature found in the rotary forged parts is the presence of a buckling phenomenon which appears in later stages of the rotary forging process. Strain hardening along with the increasing flange length requires higher levels of forging loads to keep forming the flange. This results into a significant accumulation of compressive stresses in the transition region between the flange and the straight region. Gradually the resultant compressive force exceeds the critical buckling load, leading to the occurrence of the buckling phenomenon. This latter issue determines the limit of the cold flaring process. This can help to determine the maximum length of the flange part, achievable in this process, which is of great importance for the design of these manufacturing technologies. From the mechanical testing results, large differences were found as a function of both position and orientation (axial, transverse) throughout the rotary forged components (anisotropic properties). Concerning the impact of heat treatments on cold-worked components, no differences were found in the as-treated condition, in terms of microstructural and mechanical properties between regions with a large difference in strain distribution. These results denote the normalizing effect of conventional hardening treatments on cold-worked Jethete M 152 components, restoring the homogenous and isotropic properties across the whole componen...|$|R
