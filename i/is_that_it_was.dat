5|$|The {{origin of}} the name of the pub is unclear, but one {{reported}} theory <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> named after the 17th-century warship HMS Royal Oak, which was sunk at the nearby Raid on the Medway in 1664. Local people say that one of the beams in the pub comes from the ship, the remains of which may have been broken up at a nearby shipyard after the battle. Another theory <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> named after the Royal Oak that Charles II of England hid in following the Battle of Worcester.|$|E
5|$|The reserve covers four woods: Park Wood, Mad Bess Wood and Copse Wood in Ruislip, with Bayhurst Wood in Harefield. Poor's Field and Tartleton's Lake in Ruislip {{are also}} part of the reserve. There is no {{definitive}} explanation as to why Mad Bess Wood received its name, although one theory <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> named after a female landowner who patrolled the wood looking for poachers.|$|E
2500|$|Socrates', Plato's and Aristotle's {{ideas about}} truth are {{seen by some}} as {{consistent}} with correspondence theory. In his Metaphysics, Aristotle stated: [...] "To say of what <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> not, or of what <b>is</b> not <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is,</b> is false, while to say of what <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is,</b> and of what <b>is</b> not <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> not, is true".

50|$|In 1854 Charles Marshall {{named his}} leased {{pastoral}} selection Moura. There are two theories regarding {{the origin of}} the name. One <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> named after Moura in Portugal where he served in the British Army during the Peninsular Wars. The other <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> an Aboriginal word meaning native camp dog.|$|R
5|$|A {{subject of}} {{on-going}} {{research is the}} formation of the Moon, some 4.53 Bya. A working hypothesis <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> formed by accretion from material loosed from Earth after a Mars-sized object, named Theia, impacted Earth. In this scenario, the mass of Theia was approximately 10% of that of Earth, it impacted Earth with a glancing blow, and some of its mass merged with Earth. Between approximately 4.1 and , numerous asteroid impacts during the Late Heavy Bombardment caused significant changes to the greater surface environment of the Moon, and by inference, to that of Earth.|$|E
5|$|A {{third major}} {{criticism}} of the Act <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> poorly administered. The Act purposefully brought together competing interests (labor and business, big business and small business, etc.) in a coalition to support passage of the legislation, but these competing interests soon fought one another over the Act's implementation. As a consequence, NRA collapsed due to failure of leadership and confusion about its goals. By the end of 1934, NRA leaders had practically abandoned the progressive interventionist policy which motivated the Act's passage, and were supporting free-market philosophies—contributing {{to the collapse of}} almost all industry codes.|$|E
5|$|Although sauropods {{may have}} been the prey of choice for Majungasaurus, discoveries {{published}} in 2007 detail finds in Madagascar that indicate the presence of other Majungasaurus in their diet. Numerous bones of Majungasaurus have been discovered bearing tooth marks identical to those found on sauropod bones from the same localities. These marks have the same spacing as teeth in Majungasaurus jaws, are of the same size as Majungasaurus teeth, and contain smaller notches consistent with the serrations on those teeth. As Majungasaurus is the only large theropod known from the area, the simplest explanation <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> feeding on other members of its own species. Suggestions that the Triassic Coelophysis was a cannibal have been recently disproven, leaving Majungasaurus as the only non-avian theropod with confirmed cannibalistic tendencies, although {{there is some evidence that}} cannibalism may have occurred in other species as well.|$|E
50|$|A major {{advantage}} of the TST <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> simple and inexpensive. A major dis{{advantage of}} the TST <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> restricted to mice and limited to strains that do not tend to climb their tail. Besides, like FST, TST is sensitive to acute treatment only, and its validity for non-monoamine antidepressants is uncertain.|$|R

5|$|Among {{the many}} German {{aircraft}} designs {{that participated in}} the Condor Legion, {{and as part of}} other German involvement in the Spanish Civil War, a single Ju 87 A-0 (the V4 prototype) was allocated serial number 29-1 and was assigned to the VJ/88, the experimental Staffel of the Legion's fighter wing. The aircraft was secretly loaded onto the ship Usaramo and departed Hamburg harbor on the night of 1 August 1936, arriving in Cádiz five days later. The only known information pertaining to its combat career in Spain <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> piloted by Unteroffizier Herman Beuer, and took part in the Nationalist offensive against Bilbao in 1937. Presumably the aircraft was then secretly returned to Germany.|$|E
5|$|It {{was moved}} to its current {{location}} on St George's Street {{at the edge of}} the village, although the date when this was done is unclear. The site where the cross now stands was levelled in 1776 by workmen, paid by Henry Fownes Luttrell, and it may have been on this occasion that the cross was moved. An alternative local tradition <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> moved in 1825, although a drawing by J. M. W. Turner made in 1811 suggests it was in its present position by then.|$|E
5|$|The {{alternative}} {{train of}} thought <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> simply not advantageous to be large until {{the appearance of the}} Ediacarans: the environment favoured the small over the large. Examples of such scenarios today include plankton, whose small size allows them to reproduce rapidly to take advantage of ephemerally abundant nutrients in algal blooms. But for large size never to be favourable, the environment would have to be very different indeed.|$|E

50|$|As an example, {{consider}} a valuable ring {{which happens to}} <b>be</b> lost. <b>Its</b> inherent condition <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> valuable and so has lots of essential dignity. However, its current state <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> lost and so has little accidental dignity. The significator for the ring in this horary might, for example, be Venus in Taurus (good essential dignity) but retrograde and combust (accidentally debilitated).|$|R
5|$|While {{none of the}} {{historical}} sources explicitly state Ecgfrith's reason for attacking Fortriu in 685, the consensus <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> to reassert Northumbria's eroded hegemony over the Picts. The most thorough description of the battle is given by Bede in his 8th century work Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum (The Ecclesiastical History of the English People) (completed c731), but this is still brief. Additional detail is given in the Irish annals of Ulster and Tigernach, and by the early Welsh historian Nennius in his Historia Brittonum (written c. 830).|$|E
5|$|Skeptics who {{identify}} {{issues with the}} traditionalist view point to possible anachronisms in The Art of War including terms, technology (such as anachronistic crossbows and the unmentioned cavalry), philosophical ideas, events, and military techniques that {{should not have been}} available to Sun Wu. Additionally, there are no records of professional generals during the Spring and Autumn period; these are only extant from the Warring States period, so there is doubt as to Sun Tzu's rank and generalship. This caused much confusion as to when The Art of War was actually written. The first traditional view <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> written in 512 BC by the historical Sun Wu, active {{in the last years of}} the Spring and Autumn period (c. 722–481 BC). A second view, held by scholars such as Samuel Griffith, places The Art of War during the middle to late Warring States period (c. 481–221 BC). Finally, a third school claims that the slips were published in the last half of the 5th century BC; this is based on how its adherents interpret the bamboo slips discovered at Yin-ch’ueh-shan in 1972 AD.|$|E
5|$|The chronicle {{continues}} {{by stating}} that Óláfr then {{took control of the}} fleet whereupon he led it to Mann, where he and Guðrøðr divided the kingdom between themselves—with Óláfr retaining Mann, and Guðrøðr controlling the Hebridean portions; in fact, it is possible that Hákon may have originally intended for Óláfr and Guðrøðr to split the kingdom of Mann and the Isles between themselves. According to the saga the Norwegians left in the spring, sailing north to Kintyre where they encountered and battled a strong force of Scots with both sides losing many men during the ensuing battle. The saga then recounts how the fleet sailed north to Lewis and displaced a certain Þórmóðr Þórkelson, before travelling to Orkney, from where most of the fleet sailed back to Norway. Páll, however, is stated to have remained behind, and to have been slain by Guðrøðr several weeks later. The saga notes that Guðrøðr was also slain in the Isles a short time after this. The Chronicle of Mann specifically places Guðrøðr's death on Lewis, although it does not cast any light upon the circumstances. Even so, what is certain <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> only after Guðrøðr's death that Óláfr's kingship was safe from any rival claim.|$|E

25|$|Germany {{carried out}} testing of its Colorado potato beetle weaponization program south of Frankfurt, where they {{released}} 54,000 of the beetles. In 1944, an infestation of Colorado potato beetles {{was reported in}} Germany. The source of the infestation is unknown, speculation has offered three alternative theories as to {{the origin of the}} infestation. One option is Allied action, an entomological attack, another <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> the result of the German testing, and still another more likely explanation <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> merely a natural occurrence.|$|E
