500|$|A sub-unit of No.410 Squadron is the Fighter Operational Test and Evaluation Flight (FOTEF), {{which is}} {{responsible}} for operational testing and evaluation. In 2010, its efforts were seen as integral to the operational effectiveness of all aspects of core and CF-18 capabilities. Some of the new systems being evaluated were Night Vision Imaging Systems (NVIS), Multi-function Information Distribution Systems (MIDS), the Advanced Multi-role <b>Infra-Red</b> <b>Sensor,</b> and the evaluation of new mission planning software and the Advanced Distributed Combat Training System. Working closely with a variety of key units across the Air Force, including the [...] "Aerospace Engineering & Test Establishment" [...] (AETE), FOTEF enabled the integration of newly modernized CF-18 ECP-583 R2 aircraft into the Fighter Force.|$|E

30|$|<b>Infra-red</b> <b>sensors</b> {{can be used}} {{to obtain}} the {{locations}} of interfaces [12]. By detecting the relative location and strength of known infra-red light sources, a device with <b>infra-red</b> <b>sensors</b> can determine its position. However, the technology is extremely sensitive and small changes in the ambient light level can result in the calculated location varying from the sensors’ actual locations to a significant degree [12]. This technology can also be affected by obstructions; an object blocking an <b>infra-red</b> <b>sensor’s</b> view of one or more infra-red light sources can result in the system obtaining incorrect positional information. Therefore, for this technology to be used in a system, the environment must be clear of obstructions and have a consistent ambient light level. These two restraints make this technology unsuitable for a number of potential usage scenarios.|$|R

While descending, the submunition rotates, scanning the area below with multi-frequency <b>infra-red</b> <b>sensors</b> that compares the detected vehicles with a programmable target database.The submunitions each contain a high-penetration EFP warhead for use against even heavy armoured armoured fighting vehicles like main battle tanks.|$|R
50|$|The PARM 2 {{incorporates}} an <b>infra-red</b> <b>sensor,</b> the SAPIR, {{which acts}} to accurately fire the rocket to ranges up to 100 meters. The warhead of the PARM 2 has been upgraded, with an armour penetration of 750 millimeters and a capability against reactive armour. It can {{be programmed to}} be active from between hours and 30 days.|$|E
50|$|The FFV 018 is a Swedish off-route {{anti-tank}} mine. It uses a large Misznay Schardin effect warhead, {{that generates}} a fast moving slug capable of penetrating the side armour of a tank. The mine {{is mounted on}} a squat tripod, and a built in <b>infra-red</b> <b>sensor</b> package, which detects the target and triggers the mine when the target is in the optimal position.|$|E
5000|$|These {{were fairly}} simple systems {{consisting}} of an <b>infra-red</b> <b>sensor</b> with a horizontally rotating shutter {{in front of}} it. The shutter was slaved to a display under the main interception radar display in the cockpit, any IR light falling on the sensor would generate a [...] "pip" [...] on the display, in a fashion similar to the B-scopes used on early radars.|$|E
50|$|The basic robot, {{comprising}} the mobile {{base and the}} control system, cost $16,000 in 1990. It could be equipped with 16 sonar sensors mounted around the circumference, 16 <b>infra-red</b> <b>sensors,</b> a magnetic compass, a TV camera and laser rangefinder system and two rows of ten contact sensors. The additional sensor systems cost between $1,500 and $7000.|$|R
50|$|There are in {{any case}} ways to detect fighters other than radar. For instance, passive <b>infra-red</b> <b>sensors</b> can detect the heat of engines, and even {{the sound of a}} sonic boom (which any {{supersonic}} aircraft will make) can be tracked with a network of sensors and computers. However, using these to provide precise targeting information for a long-range missile is considerably less straightforward than radar.|$|R

The simulation can be executed in a "perfect " environment or with certain error ranges for individual sensors...|$|R
50|$|The {{mine was}} {{developed}} in the early 1980s to meet the US MIL-STD-331A and US MIL-STD-810C requirements. Trials of the mine were conducted between March 1983 and March 1988. In June 1988 it was accepted into service with the German army, with the Army receiving the first batch of 25,000 between 1991 and 1994. The PARM 2 was a development of PARM 1 incorporating an <b>infra-red</b> <b>sensor,</b> and an improved rocket.|$|E
50|$|The mine is {{positioned}} 5 metres {{from the road}} {{it is intended to}} attack and aimed using an integrated sight. The seismic sensor detects an approaching vehicle and activates the <b>infra-red</b> <b>sensor.</b> When the vehicle reaches the optimum target point the warhead is triggered. The mine can also be remotely triggered from up to 100 meters away. The mine can remain operational for up to 30 days. Armour penetration is claimed to be 100 - 400 mm at a range of 50 meters.|$|E
50|$|Many of {{the modern}} Gatso cameras now feature full capability, flashless operation. The advent of infra-red flash {{technology}} has provided Gatsos with the capacity to capture vehicles exceeding the limit in varying conditions - without emitting a bright flash, which in many cases can be considered distracting to the driver, especially if taken head-on. Infra-red light is invisible to the human eye, but when paired with a camera with an <b>infra-red</b> <b>sensor,</b> {{can be used as}} a flash to produce a clear image in low light conditions.|$|E
30|$|Visible {{light can}} also be used for {{detecting}} the location of an interface [13]. Using light sensing technology, an interface can detect its location by using patterns projected from a light source. However, similar to <b>infra-red</b> <b>sensors,</b> these visible light sensors require a clear view of as much of the projected light pattern as possible; if obstructed, a sensor’s reading would also result an inaccurate calculation of its location.|$|R

These aircraft were {{equipped with the}} new and somewhat embryonic reconnaissance equipment designed to exploit the night, all-weather capability of the Tornado by using a unique system of <b>infra-red</b> <b>sensors</b> and video recorders. The complete system is carried and allows the Navigator to either view the imagery in real time or later in the mission.|$|R
40|$|In {{this article}} we prove the {{validity}} of the Bellman Optimality Equation and related results for sequential decision problems with a general recursive structure. The characteristic feature of our approach is that also non-Markovian policies are taken into account. The theory is motivated by some experiments with a learning robot. 1 Introduction The theory of sequential decision problems is an important mathematical tool for studying some problems of cybernetics, e. g. control of robots. Consider for example the robot shown in Figure 1. This robot, called Khepera 1, is equipped with eight <b>infra-red</b> <b>sensors,</b> six in the front and two at the back, the <b>infra-red</b> <b>sensors</b> measuring the proximity of objects in the range 0 - 5 cm. The robot has two wheels driven by two independent DC motors and a gripper that has two degrees of freedom and is equipped with a resistivity sensor and an objectpresence sensor. The robot has a vision turret mounted on its top as. The vision turret has an image se [...] ...|$|R
50|$|Smaller and quieter V-6s were {{introduced}} in 1991 {{in the form of}} the Evinrude Spitfire and the Johnson Silver-Star series. These outboards featured a new flushing device that could be used to flush the engine with fresh water while it was running. The Spitfire and Silver-Star models also used an <b>infra-red</b> <b>sensor</b> system called Optical Ignition System (OIS 2000). This system automatically advanced the engine timing to eliminate unwanted timing changes. Other advancements in 1991 included smaller, more fuel efficient diesel stern drive models. The OMC Cobra Diesel was a 970-pound, 3.2 liter, six-cylinder monoblock inline powerhouse that produced 205-hp at 4300 rpm.|$|E
50|$|The M93 uses both seismic and {{acoustic}} {{sensors to}} track and identify potential targets near the mine. Once the mine detects a suitable target in range, the mine turns to face the target and elevates the submunition launcher to the correct angle. The submunition is then fired {{in the direction of}} the target using a gas generator. An <b>infra-red</b> <b>sensor</b> on the submunition scans the ground as it travels, searching for the target. When the target is detected the submunition triggers a Misznay Schardin effect warhead that projects a 450 gram tantalum slug, along with a number of smaller fragments downwards towards the target in a top attack.|$|E
5000|$|The Level Ten, or Level X bolt is AGD's {{answer to}} the ball {{breakage}} issues that plague players. This drop-in upgrade {{eliminates the need for}} the powerfeed design on older body styles and was ushered in with the Ultra Light Engineered vertical feed body. Most modern electronic markers rely on electronic [...] "eyes" [...] to prevent chops, consisting of either an <b>Infra-red</b> <b>sensor</b> or an LED/Light Sensor combination. When a paintball enters the breech, the eyes complete the firing circuit and allow the firing cycle to continue. The Level X upgrade, however, does not rely on electronics, and is thus not susceptible to problems associated with dirty or uncalibrated eyes.|$|E
5000|$|The H-110 Sarir (Persian: سریر, meaning [...] "Throne") is an Iranian UAV {{which was}} {{unveiled}} {{in a ceremony}} in April 2013 by IRIA. The UAV is optimized for intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance roles using electro-optic and <b>infra-red</b> <b>sensors.</b> Iranian state media reports suggest it may be capable of carrying air-to-air weapons; however, independent verification of this has yet to emerge. The aircraft is fitted with twin inboard wing pylons to support stores carriage.|$|R
50|$|There are no moving parts, so a Peltier {{plate is}} {{maintenance}} free. It has {{a relatively low}} efficiency, so thermoelectric cooling is generally used for electronic devices, such as <b>infra-red</b> <b>sensors,</b> that need to operate at temperatures below ambient. For cooling these devices, the solid state nature of the Peltier plates outweighs their poor efficiency. Thermoelectric junctions are typically around 10% as efficient as the ideal Carnot cycle refrigerator, compared with 40% achieved by conventional compression cycle systems.|$|R
40|$|Autonomous robotic {{operation}} in an unstructured or partially known environment requires sensing and sensor-based control. To overcome {{the problems with}} current "eye-in-hand" systems, miniature amplitude-based, <b>infra-red</b> proximity <b>sensors</b> are being studied. Obtaining position and velocity estimates of a rigid body with these sensors is a non-linear parameter and state estimation problem. Among the methods examined in simulation, Extended Kalman Filtering (EKF) was selected for implementation. A novel approach for object localization was developed in which the object geometry is known, sensing is performed by a proximity sensing network (PSN) and the object's unknown reflective properties are estimated on-line. The method has been tested extensively in simulation and experiments in which a target object's planar position and velocity were successfully estimated. To the author's knowledge {{this is the first}} time amplitude based <b>infra-red</b> <b>sensors</b> have been used to estimate a rigid body's unknown trajectory...|$|R

50|$|The MPB is a Polish off-route {{anti-tank}} mine. It {{was developed}} by BELMA (BZE BELMA S.A.) with its partner Military Institute of Engineer Technology. The MPB consists of a metal cylinder filled with explosives, mounted horizontally in an adjustable frame. The mine {{is intended to be}} hidden from direct view of the intended target, {{off to the side of}} a probable vehicle route, usually a road, to attack the weaker armour on the sides and rear of a vehicle. The mine can be triggered by either a contact fuze (MPB-ZK variant) or an influence fuze (MPB-ZN variant) based on infra-red and acoustic sensors, and is also fitted with an anti-handling device. When used with the passive infrared fuze, an acoustic sensor detects approaching vehicles and activates the <b>infra-red</b> <b>sensor,</b> which triggers the mine at an optimal moment as the target passes. The mine can be programmed to self-destruct after either 1, 10 or 30 days have passed.|$|E
