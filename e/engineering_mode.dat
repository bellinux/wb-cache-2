All parts of the roller coaster are destructible. Removing any single part will naturally cause derailment of the coasters. Destroying the coaster will also lead to the destruction of buildings. Well placed coaster destruction could lead to explosion, chain reaction and the collapse of a skyscraper.

40|$|Capacitive {{deionization}} (CDI) is a fast-emerging {{water desalination}} technology {{in which a}} small cell voltage of ~ 1 V across porous carbon electrodes removes salt from feedwaters via electrosorption. In flow-through electrode (FTE) CDI cell architecture, feedwater is pumped through macropores or laser perforated channels in porous electrodes, enabling highly compact cells with parallel flow and electric field, as well as rapid salt removal. We here present a one-dimensional model describing water desalination by FTE CDI, and a comparison to data from a custom-built experimental cell. The model employs simple cell boundary conditions derived via scaling arguments. We show good model-to-data fits with reasonable values for fitting parameters such as the Stern layer capacitance, micropore volume, and attraction energy. Thus, we demonstrate that from an engineering modeling perspective, an FTE CDI cell may be described with simpler one-dimensional models, unlike more typical flow-between electrodes architecture where 2 D models are required.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{deals with}} the process of {{decision}} making in the reverse <b>engineering</b> <b>mode</b> and highlights the need for polyvalent information. Three aspects are considered. 1) Reverse engineering implies a preliminary assumption: having defined a desired outcome of the decision process. Defining goals on the possible outcomes is a complex, multi-actor process based on ubiquitous information. Once identified at best, several alternative scenarios may lead to the desired outcome. The first issue consists in evaluating these alternative scenarios. 2) While taking into consideration the positive consequences that the different alternatives will generate, the decision process has to allow for possible negative impacts, which are not explicitly expressed in the defined goals. We thus consider the reverse engineering process has to be bipolar and take rejections into account. 3) Finally, the simultaneous achievement (respectively, avoidance) of several goals (respectively, rejections) is not always possible and depends, in particular, on whether the actions leading to each of these goals (respectively avoiding these rejections) are compatible or not. We thus seek the " best " compatible set of actions and propose to define it as optimizing the bipolar preferences expressed on the outcomes. The approach is both graphical and logical and is focused on a case study in breadmaking technology...|$|E

Oscillator development [...] 5. Amplifier modelling {{and development}} [...] 6. Conclusion [...] 7. References. Since their first demonstration in the 1960 s, picosecond laser pulses have initiated and defined {{the area of}} ultrafast laser physics. Their ability to generate a burst of high-intensity, coherent light has opened up areas of science and enabled the observation of events that would otherwise remain {{out of the realm}} of human understanding. [...] The particular mechanism commonly associated with picosecond pulse generation is mode-locking. These systems are typically complex, bulky and correspondingly expensive. A compact, cheap and robust option that produces comparable pulses would be of great value to the scientific and engineering communities. To this end, we examine the growing area of Q-switched microchip lasers: simple and compact devices that generate sub-nanosecond pulses by virtue of extremely reduced resonator cavity lengths. Incorporation of a passive Q-switch device, a semiconductor saturable absorber mirror or SESAM, enables truly minimal cavity lengths, and therefore minimal pulse durations, to be accessed. [...] In this thesis we explore the limits of generating the shortest pulses from such microchip lasers. We develop a comprehensive numerical simulation model, based on the laser rate equations, to effectively model SESAM Q-switched microchip lasers. We incorporate additional phenomena such as two-photon absorption (TPA) in the Q-switch and SESAM etalons to derive a complete picture of the abilities of these micro-lasers. We show that TPA will increasingly affect the performance of these lasers, as shorter pulses are generated, and suspect that our model underestimates its effect on our experimental results. We examine the switching dynamics of the SESAM and describe the role of relaxation oscillations in the switching process, as well as demonstrating controlled partial switching. Scaling dependencies between laser component parameters and laser performance are drawn, providing guidelines for development of these lasers. We examine these relationships in experiment and verify the key relationship between short cavities and short pulses. We demonstrate a laser with record short pulses of 22 ps duration by extending the scaling of these lasers to the shortest demonstrated cavity length of 110 μm. [...] To alleviate the low efficiency associated with lasers using thin gain media, we propose, model and develop an energy-scavenging amplification scheme. We demonstrate that a complete, amplified Q-switched microchip laser system has the potential to rival amplified mode-locked systems in generating few-picosecond, microjoule pulses, although practical validation of this will approach require careful laser <b>engineering.</b> <b>Mode</b> of access: World Wide Web. 1 online resource (x, 172 pages) illustrations (some colour...|$|E
40|$|This project {{documents}} the attempted {{implementation of a}} new optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) system. The system comprised aluminium oxide OSLDs (without cassettes) and a reader. The primary aim was to improve upon the reader’s simple internal dose calculation. The secondary aim was to uncover practical considerations which would guide the safe and accurate use of the OSLD system in the clinic. The reader’s internal dose calculation assumed a linear relationship between reader dose and delivered dose. The assumed gradient {{was found in the}} dose report for each read routine, the intercept was found by observing a read routine in <b>engineering</b> <b>mode.</b> The gradient and intercept were required to obtain the raw signal. The relationship between raw signal and delivered dose for the OSL system is linear below 4 Gy and progressively more sub-linear above 4 Gy. A non-linearity correction has been estimated and {{can be applied to the}} raw signal of each OSLD. The response of the OSL system has no statistically significant dependence on nominal dose rate or irradiation angle. Scanning electron microscope images provided insight into the composition and structure of the OSLDs. The distribution of Al 2 O 3 :C crystals suggests that if the OSLDs were cut down to a smaller size, there may be a greater sensitivity difference between OSLDs. A two minute exposure to typical office lighting produced a 3. 3 ± 2. 9 % underestimation of the calculated dose. Ideally, the OSLDs should not be handled in a room with the lights on. Inconsistent raw signal values were observed in repeated read routines for a group of uniformly irradiated OSLDs. The dominant cause of the inconsistency was concluded to be slippage of the hub on the spindle. The inconstancy was reduced but not completely eliminated after replacement of the original hub. Further repairs or preferably spindle redesign will be required because hub slippage introduces errors that may change at any time. By restricting irradiation to specific zones on several OSLDs it was observed that approximately 33 % of the OSL originated from within 0. 5 mm of the edge of the gap through which the OSLD was stimulated. A portion of the OSL was lost if the OSLD was not positioned exactly above the stimulating laser due to slippage. Factors to correct for a wobble in the reader’s carousel were estimated from raw signal values and are consistent with dial indicator measurements. A method was devised which allows the calculation of an unknown dose from the values reported by the reader and incorporates a number of necessary corrections. The standard uncertainty of patient doses was estimated to be greater than 5. 9 % and may potentially lead to incorrect dose monitoring. An error in an in vivo dosimetry estimate may lead to an ill-informed clinical decision. Therefore the OSL system will not be used clinically until the issues of hub slippage and carousel wobble can be fully resolved. This recommendation and the above conclusions apply only to the specific devices used at WBRC and do not necessarily apply to other products by the same manufacturer or others...|$|E
