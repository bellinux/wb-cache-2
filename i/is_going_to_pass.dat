2500|$|After the game, it was {{revealed}} that the Oilers coaching staff was able to figure out the Chargers' coaches' signs as they signaled the play call from the sideline; this was one reason their defensive backs seemed to always be {{in the right place at}} the right time. [...] "We pretty much knew ahead of time when they <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>pass,</b> and where they <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> it."

50|$|Anemia is a {{decrease}} in the total amount of red blood cells (RBCs) or hemoglobin in the blood, or a lowered ability of the blood to carry oxygen.

In order to make an arrest the user must have a warrant and, obviously, it has to be the correct warrant.

[...] In the process, the player must also collect clues on their identity in order to determine who the culprit is.

When it doesn't look like Adam <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> his Chemistry exam, he proposes to Lydia that she help him cheat in return for money. She counterproposes that she will help him cheat if he takes her virginity, not because she is [...] "into" [...] him, but because she knows that he isn't a virgin and she doesn't want to be one by the time she reaches college. Although he reluctantly agrees, the reluctance due to him wanting her first time to be with someone she considers special, she calls it off at the last second as it does not feel right to her. However, after Adam gets a B+ on his exam, Adam and Lydia, {{on the spur of the}} moment, do have that sexual encounter in their mutual excitement over their combined success.|$|E

5000|$|This {{means that}} no digit {{position}} {{can have an}} absolutely final value until it has been established {{whether or not a}} carry is coming in from the right. Moreover, if the sum without a carry is 9 (in pencil-and-paper methods) or 1 (in binary arithmetic), it is not even possible to tell whether or not a given digit position <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> on a carry to the position on its left. At worst, when a whole sequence of sums comes to ...99999999... (in decimal) or ...11111111... (in binary), nothing can be deduced at all until the value of the carry coming in from the right is known, and that carry is then propagated to the left, one step at a time, as each digit position evaluated [...] "9+1=0, carry 1" [...] or [...] "1+1=0, carry 1". It is the [...] "rippling" [...] of the carry from right to left that gives a ripple-carry adder its name, and its slowness. When adding 32-bit integers, for instance, allowance has to be made for the possibility that a carry could have to ripple through every one of the 32 one-bit adders.|$|E
50|$|In all {{of these}} structures, the {{previously}} mentioned {{distinction between the two}} revolutionary sensibilities remains reflected. The Committees of War and Defense will remain {{in the hands of the}} revolutionaries, but with a progressively smaller importance, while the rest will be in the hands of the optimists. In a few days, the fronts of the civil war were drawn, of those one of the principle in the context of the revolution is that of Aragon. On July 24, 1936 the first voluntary militia left Barcelona towards Aragon. In the Durruti Column, about 3,000 persons, in its majority coordinated workers by Buenaventura Durruti, that is going to introduce liberating communism to the municipalities through which <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>pass.</b> In addition it formed other of these military structures of popular character like the Iron Column and The Red and Black Column that also participated in Aragon. All these movements will lead to an extraordinary concentration of anarchists in that part not taking because of the arrogant military leaders. It arrived, in part. of the thousands of military anarchists of Catalonia and Valencia and the existence, for other, of a great popular rural Argonese base affiliated with anarcho-unionists permitted the progressive development of the greater collectivist experience of the revolution. During the first phase the major part of the Spanish economy was placed under control of the workers organized by the unions; mainly in the anarchistic areas like Catalonia, this phenomenon reached 75% of the industrial total, but in the areas of socialist influence the rate was much lower. The factories were organized by the committees of workers, the agricultural areas were collectivized and functioned as libertarian communities. Even places like hotels, hairdressing salons, means of transportation and restaurants were collectivized and handled by their own workers.|$|E
50|$|The {{tour was}} {{originally}} planned {{to start in}} January 2014, {{but then it was}} postponed to a month later, so the band could polish more the songs before releasing the album and also have more time to rehearsals for the following tour.

Due to the great reception of Hydra in the U.S., the band decided to tour again in North America, travelling from West to East coast and passing over twelve cities, being two in Canada and having some venues with sold out tickets, while on the last tour the band passed over only five cities. On 2 May, the band announced through their Facebook page {{that they were going to}} record the concert at the Heineken Music Hall, Amsterdam, in which happened on the same evening.
