25|$|In QFT this {{combination}} of fields is called the vacuum state, its associated zero-point energy is called the vacuum energy and the average <b>expectation</b> <b>value</b> of the Hamiltonian is called the vacuum <b>expectation</b> <b>value</b> (also called condensate or simply VEV). The QED vacuum {{is a part of}} the vacuum state which specifically deals with quantum electrodynamics (e.g. electromagnetic interactions between photons, electrons and the vacuum) and the QCD vacuum deals with quantum chromodynamics (e.g. color charge interactions between quarks, gluons and the vacuum). Recent experiments advocate the idea that particles themselves can be thought of as excited states of the underlying quantum vacuum, and that all properties of matter are merely vacuum fluctuations arising from interactions with the zero-point field.|$|E
40|$|Combining an {{appropriate}} {{finite difference method}} with Richardson's extrapolation results in a simple, highly accurate numerical method for solving a Schrodinger's equation. Important results are that error estimates are provided, and that one can extrapolate <b>expectation</b> <b>values</b> rather than the wavefunctions to obtain highly accurate <b>expectation</b> <b>values.</b> We discuss the eigenvalues, the error growth in repeated Richardson's extrapolation, and show that the <b>expectation</b> <b>values</b> calculated on a crude mesh can be extrapolated to obtain <b>expectation</b> <b>values</b> of high accuracy...|$|R
40|$|In the BMN {{approach}} to N = 4 SYM a large class of correlators of interest are expressible {{in terms of}} <b>expectation</b> <b>values</b> of traces of words in a zero-dimensional Gaussian complex matrix model. We develop a loop-equation based, analytic strategy for evaluating such <b>expectation</b> <b>values</b> to any order in the genus expansion. We reproduce the <b>expectation</b> <b>values</b> which were needed for the calculation of the one-loop, genus one correction to the anomalous dimension of BMN-operators and which were earlier obtained by combinatorial means. Furthermore, we present the <b>expectation</b> <b>values</b> needed for the calculation of the one-loop, genus two correction. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{difficult}} {{problem in the}} theory of random tensors is to calculate the <b>expectation</b> <b>values</b> of polynomials in the tensor entries, even in the large N limit and in a Gaussian distribution. Here we address this issue, focusing on a family of polynomials labeled by permutations, which naturally generalize the single-trace invariants of random matrix models. Through Wick's theorem, we show that the Feynman graph expansion of the <b>expectation</b> <b>values</b> of those polynomials enumerates meandric systems whose lower arch configuration is obtained from the upper arch configuration by a permutation on half of the arch feet. Our main theorem reduces the calculation of <b>expectation</b> <b>values</b> to those of polynomials labeled by stabilized-interval-free permutations (SIF) which are proved to enumerate irreducible meandric systems. This together with explicit calculations of <b>expectation</b> <b>values</b> associated to SIF permutations allows to exactly evaluate large N <b>expectation</b> <b>values</b> beyond the so-called melonic polynomials.

25|$|The Standard Model {{describes}} fermion masses {{through the}} Higgs mechanism. The Higgs boson has a Yukawa coupling to the left- and right-handed top quarks. After electroweak symmetry breaking (when the Higgs acquires a vacuum <b>expectation</b> <b>value),</b> the left- and right-handed components mix, becoming a mass term.|$|E
25|$|When {{the number}} of {{observations}} is relatively small, Chebychev's inequality {{can be used for}} an upper bound on probabilities, regardless of any assumptions about the distribution of experimental errors: the maximum probabilities that a parameter will be more than 1, 2 or 3 standard deviations away from its <b>expectation</b> <b>value</b> are 100%, 25% and 11% respectively.|$|E
25|$|In the chiral bag {{model of}} the nucleon, the Casimir energy plays an {{important}} role in showing the mass of the nucleon is independent of the bag radius. In addition, the spectral asymmetry is interpreted as a non-zero vacuum <b>expectation</b> <b>value</b> of the baryon number, cancelling the topological winding number of the pion field surrounding the nucleon.|$|E
50|$|Line 7 {{should have}} been worked out more {{carefully}} as follows:A will be larger when A is larger than B, than when it is smaller than B. So its average <b>values</b> (<b>expectation</b> <b>values)</b> in those two cases are different. And the average value of A {{is not the same}} as A itself, anyway. Two mistakes are being made: the writer forgot he was taking <b>expectation</b> <b>values,</b> and he forgot he was taking <b>expectation</b> <b>values</b> under two different conditions.|$|R
40|$|We {{construct}} a density matrix whose elements {{are written in}} terms of <b>expectation</b> <b>values</b> of non-Hermitian operators and their products for arbitrary dimensional bipartite states. We then show that any expression which involves matrix elements can be reformulated by the <b>expectation</b> <b>values</b> of these non-Hermitian operators and vice versa. We consider the condition of pure states and pure product states and rewrite {{them in terms of}} <b>expectation</b> <b>values</b> and density matrix elements respectively. We utilize <b>expectation</b> <b>values</b> of these operators to present the condition for separability of C^d ⊗C^d bipartite states. With the help of our separability criterion we detect entanglement in certain classes of higher dimensional bipartite states. Comment: 14 pages, accepted for publication in IJT...|$|R
40|$|The large-N {{limit of}} the <b>expectation</b> <b>values</b> of the Wilson loops {{corresponding}} to two-dimensional U(N) Yang-Mills and generalized Yang-Mills theories on a sphere are studied. The behavior of the <b>expectation</b> <b>values</b> of the Wilson loops both near the critical area and for large areas are investigated. It is shown that the <b>expectation</b> <b>values</b> of the Wilson loops at large areas behave exponentially {{with respect to the}} area of the smaller region the boundary of which is the loop; and for the so called typical theories, the <b>expectation</b> <b>values</b> of the Wilson loops exhibit a discontinuity in their second derivative (with respect to the area) at the critical area.

25|$|The Casimir {{effect can}} be {{understood}} {{by the idea that}} the presence of conducting metals and dielectrics alters the vacuum <b>expectation</b> <b>value</b> of the energy of the second quantized electromagnetic field. Since the value of this energy depends on the shapes and positions of the conductors and dielectrics, the Casimir effect manifests itself as a force between such objects.|$|E
25|$|So far, H {{is only an}} {{abstract}} Hermitian operator. However using the correspondence principle {{it is possible to}} show that, in the classical limit, the <b>expectation</b> <b>value</b> of H is indeed the classical energy. The correspondence principle does not completely fix the form of the quantum Hamiltonian due to the uncertainty principle and therefore the precise form of the quantum Hamiltonian must be fixed empirically.|$|E
25|$|The Higgs {{mechanism}} {{is a type}} of superconductivity which occurs in the vacuum. It occurs when all of space is filled with a sea of particles which are charged and thus the field has a nonzero vacuum <b>expectation</b> <b>value.</b> Interaction with the vacuum energy filling the space prevents certain forces from propagating over long distances (as it does in a superconducting medium; e.g., in the Ginzburg–Landau theory).|$|E
40|$|Particle theorists {{typically}} use <b>expectation</b> <b>values</b> {{to study}} the quantum back-reaction on inflation, whereas many cosmologists stress the stochastic nature of the process. While <b>expectation</b> <b>values</b> certainly give misleading results for some things, such as the stress tensor, we argue that operators exist {{for which there is}} no essential problem. We quantify this by examining the stochastic properties of a noninteracting, massless, minimally coupled scalar on a locally de Sitter background. The square of the stochastic realization of this field seems to provide an example of great relevance for which <b>expectation</b> <b>values</b> are not misleading. We also examine the frequently expressed concern that significant back-reaction from <b>expectation</b> <b>values</b> necessarily implies large stochastic fluctuations between nearby spatial points. Rather than viewing the stochastic formalism in opposition to <b>expectation</b> <b>values,</b> we argue that it provides a marvelously simple way of capturing the leading infrared logarithm corrections to the latter, as advocated by Starobinsky.

40|$|As a {{possible}} {{approach to the}} neutrino oscillation {{on the basis of}} quantum field theory, the <b>expectation</b> <b>values</b> of the flavor-neutrino currents are investigated by employing the finite-time transition matrix in the interaction representation.

25|$|The post-1925 new {{quantum theory}} came in two {{different}} formulations. In matrix mechanics, the correspondence principle was built in and was used to construct the theory. In the Schrödinger approach classical behavior is not clear because the waves spread out as they move. Once the Schrödinger equation was given a probabilistic interpretation, Ehrenfest showed that Newton's laws hold on average: the quantum statistical <b>expectation</b> <b>value</b> of the position and momentum obey Newton's laws.|$|E
25|$|The Schrödinger–Newton {{equation}} can {{be derived}} {{under the assumption that}} gravity remains classical, even at the fundamental level, and that the right way to couple quantum matter to gravity is by means of the semiclassical Einstein equations. In this case, a Newtonian gravitational potential term is added to the Schrödinger equation, where the source of this gravitational potential is the <b>expectation</b> <b>value</b> of the mass density operator. In this regard, if gravity is fundamentally classical, the Schrödinger–Newton equation is a fundamental one-particle equation, which can be generalised to the case of many particles (see below).|$|E
25|$|Any modern {{scientific}} theory requires at {{the very}} least an instrumentalist description that relates the mathematical formalism to experimental practice and prediction. In the case of quantum mechanics, the most common instrumentalist description is an assertion of statistical regularity between state preparation processes and measurement processes. That is, if a measurement of a real-value quantity is performed many times, each time starting with the same initial conditions, the outcome is a well-defined probability distribution agreeing with the real numbers; moreover, quantum mechanics provides a computational instrument to determine statistical properties of this distribution, such as its <b>expectation</b> <b>value.</b>|$|E

25|$|Another {{motivation}} for using local alignments {{is that there}} is a reliable statistical model (developed by Karlin and Altschul) for optimal local alignments. The alignment of unrelated sequences tends to produce optimal local alignment scores which follow an extreme value distribution. This property allows programs to produce an <b>expectation</b> <b>value</b> for the optimal local alignment of two sequences, which is a measure of how often two unrelated sequences would produce an optimal local alignment whose score is greater than or equal to the observed score. Very low expectation values indicate that the two sequences in question might be homologous, meaning they might share a common ancestor.|$|E
25|$|When the <b>expectation</b> <b>value</b> {{is added}} over all modes in a cavity, this is Wien's distribution, and it {{describes}} the thermodynamic {{distribution of energy}} in a classical gas of photons. Wien's Law implicitly assumes that light is statistically composed of packets that change energy and frequency in the same way. The entropy of a Wien gas scales as the volume to the power N, where N {{is the number of}} packets. This led Einstein to suggest that light is composed of localizable particles with energy proportional to the frequency. Then the entropy of the Wien gas can be given a statistical interpretation as the number of possible positions that the photons can be in.|$|E
25|$|This has an {{interesting}} consequence on the {{electric dipole moment}} (EDM) of any particle. The EDM is defined through the shift in the energy of a state when it is put in an external electric field: Δe = d·E + E·δ·E, where d is called the EDM and δ, the induced dipole moment. One important property of an EDM is that the energy shift due to it changes sign under a parity transformation. However, since d is a vector, its <b>expectation</b> <b>value</b> in a state |ψ> must be proportional to | J |ψ>. Thus, under time reversal, an invariant state must have vanishing EDM. In other words, a non-vanishing EDM signals both P and T symmetry-breaking.|$|E

25|$|For many {{classes of}} options, {{traditional}} valuation techniques are intractable {{because of the}} complexity of the instrument. In these cases, a Monte Carlo approach may often be useful. Rather than attempt to solve the differential equations of motion that describe the option's value in relation to the underlying security's price, a Monte Carlo model uses simulation to generate random price paths of the underlying asset, each of which results in a payoff for the option. The average of these payoffs can be discounted to yield an <b>expectation</b> <b>value</b> for the option. Note though, that despite its flexibility, using simulation for American styled options is somewhat more complex than for lattice based models.|$|E
