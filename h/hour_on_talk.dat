50|$|This song {{is about}} him and his girlfriend. His girlfriend said {{something}} that caused them to break up after four years.

Then, he tells us that his girlfriend apparently realized it was a mistake leaving him. She wants to start anew with Frankie. But he doesn't, not after what she put him through. Yet, he still has feelings for her. So basically Frankie J wants this relationship to be over. He still loves her but it just won't work.|$|R

60|$|Mr. Heathcliff {{has just}} honoured {{me with a}} call. About seven days ago he sent me a brace of grouse--the last of the season. Scoundrel! He is not {{altogether}} guiltless in this illness of mine; and that I had a great mind to tell him. But, alas! how could I offend {{a man who was}} charitable enough to sit at my bedside a good <b>hour,</b> and <b>talk</b> <b>on</b> some other subject than pills and draughts, blisters and leeches? This is quite an easy interval. I am too weak to read; yet I feel as if I could enjoy something interesting. Why not have up Mrs. Dean to finish her tale? I can recollect its chief incidents, as far as she had gone. Yes: I remember her hero had run off, and never been heard of for three years; and the heroine was married. I'll ring: she'll be delighted to find me capable of talking cheerfully. Mrs. Dean came.|$|R
