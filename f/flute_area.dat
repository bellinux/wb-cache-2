40|$|Introduction: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the changes in the surface profile of rotary nickel-titanium (NiTi) files designed to prepare a glide path and conventional stainless steel (SS) hand files when used in extremely narrow canals both in clinical and experimental conditions. Methods: This ex vivo/in vivo study used either SS # 10 K hand files or the PathFile system (Dentsply Maillefer, Ballaigues, Switzerland) to establish a glide path in maxillary molars with narrow root canals (defined as canals that bound a # 8 K-file at the working length). After treatment, all files were cleaned and scanned using a noncontact laser profilometer. Changes to the surface profile (Ra cutting edge waviness = RaCEW) and roughness (Ra cutting edge roughness = RaCER) of the cutting edges and the surface roughness of the <b>flute</b> <b>area</b> (Sa flute roughness = SaFR) were analyzed. Results: # 10 K-files had significant increases in all types of measurements (RaCEW, RaCEW, and SaFR) after the preparation of second mesiobuccal canals compared with the control group (P <. 05) in both studies. In the ex vivo study, the PathFile (P 1) had no significant changes in the surface profile from baseline but had a significant increase in the surface roughness of the flute (SaFR) (P <. 05). PathFiles that were used 3 times in vivo had a significant increase in roughness (flute and cutting edge) values across all PathFile sizes compared with control values. Conclusions: This study showed that PathFiles had significantly less surface defects compared with SS files after the preparation of narrow canals, indicating their possible benefits when establishing a glide path in extremely narrow canals.

5000|$|Common mammals in {{the park}} include the Bennett's wallaby (Macropus rufogriseus), common brush tail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula) and Tasmanian pademelon (Thylogale billardierii). The Bennett's wallaby is fairly {{prevalent}} throughout Tasmania, however the national park protects a small population of unusual white Bennett's wallabies. The Bennett's wallaby, {{also referred to as}} the red-necked wallaby, can be found grazing on grasslands around the <b>Fluted</b> Cape <b>area</b> and are nocturnal. The eastern quoll (Dasyurus viverrinus) has also been reported. Spotted-tail quolls (Dasyurus maculates), Tasmanian devils (Sarcophilus harrisii), and common wombats (Vombatus ursinus) have always been absent from the island. [...] All twelve of Tasmania's endemic bird species are present, notably the forty-spotted pardalote (pardalotus quadragintus) for which the island is the main stronghold. Little penguins (Eudyptula minor) and hooded plovers (Thinornis rubicollis) also breed along the coast. Reptiles recorded include the tiger snake (Notechis scutatus), lowland copperhead (Austrelaps superbus) and white-lipped snake (Drysdalia coronoides). A colony of Australian fur seals (Arctocephalus pusillus) occupy The Friars; rocks that form the most southerly part of the park where they use the rocks as a ‘haul-out’. The birdlife of the park is of particular significance due to the varied habitats suitable for a rich variety of species.|$|R
40|$|The {{existing}} subglacial megaflood {{explanation of}} glacial sediment deposition and landform production in south-central Alberta relies upon {{four sets of}} observations and associated interpretations: (1) a subglacial genesis for all glacilacustrine sediments lying stratigraphically below a local melt-out till or “ice stagnation facies”; (2) a melt-out genesis for the “ice stagnation facies”; (3) a syn-depositional status for the glacitectonic disturbance visible in most exposures due to periodic ice–bed re-coupling; and (4) a subglacial megaflood origin for a “truncation surface” and clast lag that occurs {{at the top of}} the sedimentary exposures and the carving of hummocky terrain and <b>flutes</b> in the <b>area.</b> We provide alternative interpretations of the sediment-landform assemblages of the area and demonstrate that alternative, simpler interpretations of the evidence can be proposed. Specifically, we propose: (1) a proglacial rather than subglacial origin of glacilacustrine sediments; (2) a glacilacustrine origin for the “melt-out till” and its subsequent glacitectonic disturbance by minor glacier readvances; (3) postdepositional rather than syn-depositional glacitectonic disturbance due to a significant advance by glacier ice after the accumulation of a thick sequence of glacilacustrine sediments; (4) that some linear chains of hummocks are the morphological expression of glacitectonic folding and thrusting; (5) that the use of the truncation surfaces to propose a subglacial fluvial origin for hummocky moraine is flawed logic, because they do not constitute the tops of hummocks but rather occur on the interfluves that separate the numerous small coulees incised into the valley sides during postglacial time. Truncation surfaces and clast lags occur locally on the beds of spillway tracts and can be explained as the products of erosion by subaerial spillway water. The mega-flood explanation of flutings and hummocky moraine in the region is also questioned because these landforms record a regional ice flow imprint of mis-aligned and cross-cutting flow sets terminating at series of inset and locally cross-cutting and lobate transverse ridges (moraines). These landform associations preclude a subglacial flood origin for the flutings and demonstrate that the transverse ridges are more appropriately interpreted as recessional push moraines. The similarity of the glacial landforms of this region to the active, temperate glacial landsystem produced by historical glacier recession in modern glacierized catchments, where sheetfloods have not been influential in subglacial landform production, allows us to apply a modern analogue to landscape interpretation that does not include subglacial sheetflooding...|$|R
