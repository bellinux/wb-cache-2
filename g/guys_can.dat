500|$|Speaking of the song's lyrical background, Cruz told Pete Lewis of Blues & Soul: [...] "Its about {{breaking}} a girl's heart, {{but in a}} way that's kinda not on purpose. It's more that I'm just a single guy, trying to be single and trying to remain single. And sometimes, when you are in that place, you get girls who wanna be a part of what you're about – but, because you're not really ready for a relationship, those girls can end up being heartbroken. So what I'm basically saying is 'I might just break your heart. But I'm only gonna break your heart if you come through this way right now'." [...] Cruz also has called his song [...] "catchy" [...] with a [...] "good melody" [...] and [...] "fun topic", stating that [...] "both girls and <b>guys</b> <b>can</b> get into this character".

On selecting Elba, del Toro stated: [...] "This is a {{movie where}} I have {{had to deal with}} more dialogue than ever, and the way I cast the movie was—who do I want to hear say these things? Who do I want Charlie Hunnam to go against? Who can really tell Charlie Hunnam 'sit down and listen'?" [...] In another interview, the director said: [...] "I wanted to have Idris not be the blonde, square-jawed, Anglo, super hip marine that knows [...] I wanted somebody that could bring a lot of authority, but that you could feel {{the weight of the world}} on his shoulders. When I watched Luther, that's the essence of the character… Luther is carrying literally the evils of the world on his shoulders. He's doing penance for all humanity… Idris is one of those actors that is capable of embodying humanity, in almost like a Rodin sculpture-type, larger than life, almost like a Russian realism statue, you know, big hands, all the turmoil of humanity in his eyes. I wanted somebody that you could have doubts internally, and very few <b>guys</b> <b>can</b> do that." [...] To prepare for the role, Elba watched footage of politicians David Cameron and Barack Obama, as well as Russell Crowe in Gladiator and Mel Gibson in Braveheart. Del Toro initially offered the role to Tom Cruise, who declined because of scheduling conflicts.|$|E

500|$|Immediately {{following}} the 1986 season, Weaver retired for good, and Ripken was named {{manager of the}} Orioles. The Orioles were coming off their first last-place finish in Baltimore, but Ripken expressed confidence in the team {{at the beginning of}} the 1987 season, saying, [...] "I know these <b>guys</b> <b>can</b> get the job done.

2500|$|Edwards {{was hired}} as {{athletic}} director and head football coach at Wittenberg, his alma mater, in 1955.

[...] "We had small players, but little <b>guys</b> <b>can</b> throw the football and little <b>guys</b> <b>can</b> catch it, whereas you need big guys to block for a running game," [...] he said in 1973. Under Edwards, the Wittenberg Tigers were a major success, amassing a 98–20–4 record in 14 seasons and winning the NCAA College Division national championship poll in 1962 and 1964. Edwards's teams were unbeaten three times and lost one game in five of his seasons there. He was named Ohio College Football Coach of the Year in 1957 by his fellow coaches.
