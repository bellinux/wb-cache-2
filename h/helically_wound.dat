40|$|Risers in {{offshore}} operations {{are subjected to}} corrosion during their service life cycle. The use of relatively inexpensive, high strength to weight ratio fibre reinforced polymer composite (FRPC) as a load bearing pipe repair sleeve is an emerging technology that is becoming common for offshore applications. Risers experience complex loading profiles and experimental investigations often incur substantial time, complicated instrumentation and setup costs. The main aim {{of this research is}} to develop a design tool for the repair of offshore riser that suffers from external corrosion damage on its surface using FRPC material. The simplest configuration of a fixed platform riser {{in the form of a}} vertical single-wall pipe is being considered. Characterization of the stress-strain behaviour of the FRPC laminate in the composite repair system subjected to various load profiles of a common riser is performed. The means of composite repair takes into account the ease of automated installation. The final repair method considers the use of unidirectional pre-impregnated (prepreg) FRPC that is assumed to be <b>helically</b> <b>wounded</b> around the riser. Finite element models of the composite repair system were developed via ABAQUS. Global analysis of the entire length of the riser was omitted as external corrosions usually occurs in a localised manner on the surface of the riser. Instead, local analyses were conducted where boundary conditions were applied to mimic an infinitely long cylindrical structure such as the riser. The local analyses FEA models were made to capture the stress-strain behaviour of the FRPC laminate subjected to different load profiles including static loadings such as internal pressure, tensile load and bending load. The design loads were calculated based on a limit analysis known as Double-Elastic Curve method developed by Alexander (2008). Proper element selection and mesh convergence were carried out to determine the FE model that can minimize the time and CPU memory needed for the simulation without compromising the accuracy of the results. The second part of this research integrated experimental tests to validate the FE model developed using the ABAQUS general purpose code. Due to constraints on cost and supply of materials and equipment, small-scale tests were conducted. Similitude relations were used to determine the scale properties between the model and the prototype. The final results showed that the FE model can represent the real-life tests of corroded riser repaired with off-axis FRPC laminate with great accuracy of more than 85...|$|R

50|$|The {{tightening}} {{is simply}} a normal behavior of a cylindrical, <b>helically</b> <b>wound</b> braid, usually the common biaxial braid. Pulling the entire braid lengthens and narrows it. The length is gained by reducing the angle between the warp and weft threads at their crossing points, but this reduces the radial distance between opposing sides and hence the overall circumference. The more one pulls, the more the circumference shrinks and the trap tightens. The same effect is used in specialized textile manufacturing, the Vivien Kellems cable grip, Indonesian woven fruit presses, and by fly-fishers.|$|E

40|$|Although {{steel is}} most {{commonly}} used as a reinforcing material in concrete due to its competitive cost and favorable mechanical properties, the problem of corrosion of steel rebars leads {{to a reduction in}} life span of the structure and adds to maintenance costs. Many techniques have been developed in recent past to reduce corrosion (galvanizing, epoxy coating, etc.) but none of the solutions seem to be viable as an adequate solution to the corrosion problem. Apart from the use of fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) rebars, hybrid rebars consisting of both FRP and steel are also being tried to overcome the problem of steel corrosion. This paper evaluates the performance of hybrid rebars as longitudinal reinforcement in normal strength concrete beams.

50|$|EBOV {{carries a}} negative-sense RNA genome in virions that are cylindrical/tubular, and contain viral envelope, matrix, and nucleocapsid components. The overall {{cylinders}} are generally approximately 80 nm in diameter, {{and have a}} virally encoded glycoprotein (GP) projecting as 7-10 nm long spikes from its lipid bilayer surface. The cylinders are of variable length, typically 800 nm, but sometimes up to 1000 nm long. The outer viral envelope of the virion is derived by budding from domains of host cell membrane into which the GP spikes have been inserted during their biosynthesis. Individual GP molecules appear with spacings of about 10 nm. Viral proteins VP40 and VP24 are located between the envelope and the nucleocapsid (see following), in the matrix space.

50|$|Glow plugs {{are used}} for {{starting}} as well as continuing the power cycle. The glow plug consists of a durable, mostly platinum, <b>helically</b> <b>wound</b> wire filament, within a cylindrical pocket in the plug body, exposed to the combustion chamber. A small direct current voltage (around 1.5 volts) {{is applied to the}} glow plug, the engine is then started, and the voltage is removed. The burning of the fuel/air mixture in a glow-plug model engine, which requires methanol for the glow plug to work in the first place, and sometimes with the use of nitromethane for greater power output and steadier idle, occurs due to the catalytic reaction of the methanol vapor to the presence of the platinum in the filament, thus causing the ignition. This keeps the plug's filament glowing hot, and allows it to ignite the next charge. Since the ignition timing is not controlled electrically, as in a spark ignition engine or by fuel injection, as in an ordinary diesel, it must be adjusted by the richness of the mixture, the ratio of nitromethane to methanol, the compression ratio, the cooling of the cylinder head, the type of glow plug, etc. A richer mixture will tend to cool the filament and so retard ignition, slowing the engine, and a rich mixture also eases starting. After starting the engine can easily be leaned (by adjusting a needle valve in the spraybar) to obtain maximum power. Glowplug engines are also known as nitro engines. Nitro engines require a 1.5 volt ignitor to light the glow plug in the heat sink. Once primed, pulling the starter with the ignitor in will start the engine.|$|E

40|$|The {{discoveries of}} Hershey and Chase {{concerning}} {{the role of}} DNA in transmitting genetic information in phage and of Watson and Crick concerning the structure of DNA have brought {{the problem of the}} replication of DNA into focus. The structure proposed by Watson and Crick consists of two polynucleotide chains <b>wound</b> <b>helically</b> around a common axis, tied together by hydrogen bonds between the purine and pyrimidine side chains. These side chains of the two chains are arranged so that adenine is always matched with thymine and guanine with cytosine. The sequence of bases along either chain is not subject to any restrictions, but once the sequence along one chain is given, the sequence along the other chain is completely determined. This sequence, then, constitutes the genetic information, a linear message written in a four-symbol code. The duplex of the two chains contains the information in a twofold redundance. Each chain has a directional polarity because of the nonequivalence of the 3 - and 5 -positions through which each pentose is linked to the preceding and the following phosphate group in the chain. This polarity runs in opposite directions in the two chains of the duplex...|$|R

The mature acrosome {{consists of a}} concavo-convex vesicle differing from the typical passeridan acrosome, which is a helical structure, is usually longer than the nucleus and has a prominent helical keel. The nucleus {{differs from that of}} other oscines in not showing a twisted cylindrical form, in being shorter, and in tending to be an elongate ellipsoid in shape. The chromatin often appears in an uncondensed form reminiscent of a spermatid and consists of discrete fascicles.

The model is formulated in the Timoshenko beam formalism by first assuming that a cable can be homogenized effectively as a 3 D solid rod continuum following Spencerâ€™s constitutive law. The cross-sectional forces and moments are obtained by integrating the stress components over the cross section and, using the constitutive relations, eigenvalue {{problems of the}} rod are set up by imposing appropriate boundary conditions, thus resulting in the eigenfrequencies and mode shapes.

One of -typical composite structures for offshore application is multilayer unbonded composite pipe. The composite pipe comprised of several layers such as <b>helically</b> <b>wound</b> steel layers and polymeric layers, among which the <b>helically</b> <b>wound</b> steel wires play essential roles in providing axial and flexural stiffnesses of the pipe. Because of the -geometric nonlinearity of each {{layer of the}} composite pipe and the flexibility in motion of individual layers against their adjacent layers, analyses of the composite pipe are highly nonlinear and computationally challenging. In this study, detailed three-dimensional Representative Volume Element models of the multilayer unbonded composite pipe are developed, and nonlinear analyses of the composite pipe are performed. The developed FE models effectively predict nonlinear responses of the pipe including slipping effects of steel layers under application of axial loading, bending, internal and external pressures.

40|$|This {{investigation}} {{was conducted to}} determine {{the character of the}} pressure drop through <b>helically</b> <b>wound</b> pipes by comparing the pressure drops of straight pipes and <b>helically</b> <b>wound</b> pipes of comparable relative roughness. The scope of the study was limited to Reynolds Numbers below 10 [superscript 5] and to flow through 3 / 8 and 1 / 2 inch stainless steel tubing of circular cross section. It was further limited by the use of water as the only working fluid and by the fact that no control was established over the exact character of the surface roughness. The results show that the correction factor Hc' is rather insensitive to Reynold's number and that it has greater dependence upon roughness and less dependence upon curvature than was previously thought probable. In addition, it is shown that an empirical formula of the type Hc = 1 + K(r/D) [superscript a](D/Dh) [superscript b] where a >> b, is probably more realistic than the Ac = 1 + 3. 5 D/Dh expressed in current literature.

It is demonstrated that modest increases in the magnitudes of the lay angles can lead to significant increases in the differences between the no-slip and the full-slip wave propagation characteristics.
