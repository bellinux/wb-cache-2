The consortium has five core facilities (located at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Los Alamos National Lab, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, University of California, Los Angeles and Texas A&M University) that carry out an increasing fraction of routine tasks such as protein production, crystallization and X-ray data collection. Members of the consortium improve their productivity by sending materials to these facilities, receiving the resulting products or <b>data,</b> <b>and</b> <b>reporting</b> this activity to the database.

Largely created from {{the staff of the}} National Imagery Exploitation Centre (formally known as JARIC) and then known for several years as the Defence Geospatial Intelligence Fusion Centre, it can trace its history back to clandestine {{reconnaissance}} operations at the beginning of World War II by Sydney Cotton on behalf of MI6 and then MI4, and the formation of the Allied Central Interpretation Unit at RAF Medmenham (sister to Bletchley Park). Today, DIFC's role has grown beyond just imagery intelligence. Part of the Joint Forces Intelligence Group (JFIG) within Defence Intelligence, DIFC’s primary role is to support Defence planning, current operations and the intelligence assessment process. DIFC still provides specialist imagery intelligence, but also conducts multi-disciplinary intelligence fusion for the armed forces and other UK Government partners. The integrated multi-disciplinary Task Groups at DIFC use <b>data</b> <b>and</b> <b>reporting</b> from various sources (including satellite imagery), together with other advanced technologies, to provide critical information and over-watch to tactical, operational and strategic decision makers.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to develop a conceptual model of Total Quality Management (TQM) implementation and test it empirically. The main research problem {{of this study is to}} investigate the effect of adopting TQM principles on quality achievement in manufacturing industry. The hypotheses specifying relationships between the core parts of the model including quality management infrastructure, core quality management practices, quality performance, and customer satisfaction are tested using survey research method. Data are collected from 50 managers of 25 manufacturing companies in Hong Kong. Correlation analysis on the ratings given by two different respondents from the same company shows that employee relations strongly facilitates the use of quality <b>data</b> <b>and</b> <b>reporting,</b> while training supports the function of product design, supplier quality management, and quality <b>data</b> <b>and</b> <b>reporting.</b> The results also indicate that employee relations and training have direct effects on quality performance which, in turn, relates to customer satisfaction.
