The $1 billion initial phase of the Voisey's Bay agreement provided for mine and mill infrastructure development at Voisey's Bay, and a research and development program in hydrometallurgical processing which would include a <b>demonstration</b> <b>plant</b> to be built at Argentia. the <b>demonstration</b> <b>plant</b> at Argentia was constructed and operated from 2004 to 2007.

25|$|An early solar {{pioneer of}} the 19th and 20th century, Frank Shuman, built a <b>demonstration</b> <b>plant</b> that used solar power to pump water using {{an array of}} mirrors in a trough to {{generate}} steam. Located in Philadelphia, the solar water pump station was capable of pumping 3000 gallons an hour (25hp) at that latitude.

25|$|The first Asian-owned company {{involved}} in the oil sands was JACOS, which in 1978 began participating in experiments at a pilot project in the Athabasca area. Like Imperial at Cold Lake, from 1984 to 1994 JACOS and its partners also experimented with a cyclic steam stimulation pilot project on the Hangingstone Lease. Since then the company has developed SAGD production on that lease. It is also constructing a <b>demonstration</b> <b>plant</b> using solvent-based in situ bitumen extraction.|$|E
50|$|In {{terms of}} the nuclear power {{industry}} in the USA, Thomas said, in May 2009:U.S. efforts to revive nuclear ordering, begun in 2002, were originally expected {{to get a new}} plant on-line by 2010. Even if there are no further delays, the earliest a new plant could be on-line is now looking closer to 2020. In the meantime, the nuclear industry has upped its demands for taxpayer-backed loan guarantees to build <b>demonstration</b> <b>plants</b> from about $5 billion to more than $100 billion. The prospect that these <b>demonstration</b> <b>plants</b> would lead to unsubsidized ordering now looks fanciful.|$|R

25|$|Vortex tubes {{were used}} by South Africa in their Helikon vortex {{separation}} process. The gas is injected tangentially into a chamber with special geometry that further increases its rotation to a very high rate, causing the isotopes to separate. The method is simple because vortex tubes have no moving parts, but energy intensive, about 50 times greater than gas centrifuges. A similar process, known as jet nozzle, was created in Germany, with a <b>demonstration</b> <b>plant</b> built in Brazil, and they {{went as far as}} developing a site to fuel the country's nuclear plants.|$|E

Rival teams are developing such chambers, at Solarec and at Sandia National Laboratories, both based in New Mexico.

40|$|The {{acceleration}} {{of development and}} the demonstration of {{carbon capture and storage}} (CCS) technologies are one of the key objectives of the Strategic Energy Technology Plan (SET-Plan) of the European Union, which aims at enabling the rapid transition to a low-carbon economy. A critical element for the commercialisation of CCS is the construction and operation of up to 12 coal-fired CCS <b>demonstration</b> <b>plants.</b> The cost of this demonstration programme has been estimated to be between 8. 5 and 13 billion Euros. This cost has been estimated assuming the size and composition of the fleet of the CCS <b>demonstration</b> <b>plants</b> and by calculating, based on a cash flow analysis, their additional discounted lifetime costs. The calculations presented in this report show that the additional costs for a 400 MW plant range between 680 million Euros for coal-plants and 550 Euros for gas plants. Assuming a CO 2 price as in the scenarios developed for the second European Strategic Energy Review, the additional revenue required for making these <b>demonstration</b> <b>plants</b> competitive in the electricity market are 46 Euros for coal plants and 77 Euros for gas plants per tonne of CO 2 avoided. These calculations are very sensitive to the assumptions made with regards to the capital costs, the costs of CO 2 transport and storage, fuel and CO 2 prices and the discount rate. These additional costs have been estimated using reference values for the cost of the CO 2 capture technologies (pre- and post-combustion and oxyfuel), which have stemmed from an extensive assessment of literature sources using a transparent methodology, which alleviates to a significant extent the confusion about the economics of CCS technologies.

2500|$|Enhanced {{geothermal}} systems (EGS) are a {{new type}} of geothermal power technologies that do not require natural convective hydrothermal resources. The vast majority of geothermal energy within drilling reach is in dry and non-porous rock. EGS technologies [...] "enhance" [...] and/or create geothermal resources in this [...] "hot dry rock (HDR)" [...] through hydraulic stimulation. EGS and HDR technologies, like hydrothermal geothermal, are expected to be baseload resources which produce power 24 hours a day like a fossil plant. Distinct from hydrothermal, HDR and EGS may be feasible anywhere in the world, depending on the economic limits of drill depth. Good locations are over deep granite covered by a thick (3–5km) layer of insulating sediments which slow heat loss. There are HDR and EGS systems currently being developed and tested in France, Australia, Japan, Germany, the U.S. and Switzerland.
