5|$|In the 1980s, the {{availability}} of fresh specimens of the fungus—collected by Australian mycologist Bruce A. Fuhrer from the cones of Banksia spinulosa—prompted Gordon Beaton and Gretna Weste to reexamine the previous collections. Various apparent and microscopic differences were found which suggested that three distinct species were represented in the collections, and further, the species differed enough from other Encoelia species to warrant {{the creation of a}} new genus, which Beaton and Weste named Banksiamyces. The three Banksiamyces species they described in 1982 were the original B.toomansis (those initially named T.toomansis), as well as B.macrocarpus and B.katerinae. A fourth species, B.maccannii, was added to the genus by the same authors in 1984. A 2006 study identified two additional taxa that <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>quite</b> meet the description for previously published species; these have been called Banksiamyces aff. macrocarpus and Banksiamyces aff. toomansis. Some existing species were found on other banksia species, so evidence strengthened that the individual Banksiamyces fungi did not exclusively parasitize only one banksia species, a suggestion proposed by Beaton and Weste in 1982.|$|E

5|$|Jardine entered New College, Oxford, in September 1919 at a {{time when}} the {{university}} was more crowded than usual due to the arrival of men whose entrance had been delayed due to the war. He took part in several sports, representing New College as goalkeeper in matches between the colleges, and being given a trial for the University football team, although he was not chosen. He continued to play rackets and began to play real tennis, making such progress and showing such promise that he went on to represent the University successfully and won his Blue. In cricket, Jardine came under the coaching of Tom Hayward who influenced his footwork and defence. Wisden commented in 1928 that Jardine had come with an excellent reputation, but <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>quite</b> achieve the success which was expected. His batting ability, particularly defensively, remained unquestioned.|$|E
5|$|One {{challenge}} for the production team was how to convey Bella's depression once Edward departs. In the novel, these pages were filled {{with the names of}} the passing months, and in the movie, would be represented as a visual effects shot with a camera circling around Kristen Stewart. The window that was used for the original film <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>quite</b> fit what Weitz was looking for, so the production team created a bay window when recreating the Swan house. The effect was one of the 300 visual effects helmed by Prime Focus led by visual effects supervisor Eric Pascarelli. It required matching two camera shots: one that shot the actress in a chair, and the other shooting the view outside the window as seen from the house built on location. Using a greenscreen, Prime Focus was able to enhance the changing of seasons with computer-generated leaves and falling snow.|$|E

5|$|Vytautas, {{supported}} by a few Polish banners, started {{an assault on the}} left flank of the Teutonic forces. After more than an hour of heavy fighting the Lithuanian light cavalry began a full retreat. Jan Długosz described this development as a complete annihilation of the entire Lithuanian army. According to Długosz, the Knights assumed that victory was theirs, broke their formation for a disorganized pursuit of the retreating Lithuanians and gathered much loot before returning to the battlefield to face the Polish troops. He made no mention of the Lithuanians, who later returned to the battlefield. Thus Długosz portrayed the battle as a single-handed Polish victory. This view contradicted Cronica conflictus and has been challenged by modern historians. Starting with an article by Vaclaw Lastowski in 1909, they proposed that the retreat was a planned, strategic maneuver borrowed from the Golden Horde. A false retreat was used in the Battle of the Vorskla River of 1399, where the Lithuanian army was dealt a crushing defeat and Vytautas himself barely escaped alive. This theory gained wider acceptance after the discovery and publication of a German letter by Swedish historian Sven Ekdahl in 1963. The letter, written a few years after the battle, cautions the new Grand Master to look out for false retreats of the kind that were used in the Great Battle. Stephen Turnbull asserted that the Lithuanian retreat <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>quite</b> fit the tried formula of a false retreat. Such a retreat was usually staged by one or two units (as opposed to almost an entire army) and was swiftly followed by a counterattack (whereas the Lithuanians returned late in the battle).|$|E

Scotland's innings was frequently interrupted by rain and Darren Stevens' bowling - he took five for 32, his first career five-for, as Scotland crawled to 134 all out in 32.2 overs - 94 short of the adjusted target, coincidentally {{exactly the same as}} Kent had made, but shortened by seven overs.|$|E
25|$|The {{weather was}} not in itself a {{hardship}} for those accustomed to long winters. The real problem lay in the weather's effect on crops and thus on the supply of food and firewood. At higher elevations, where farming was problematic in good years, the cooler climate <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>quite</b> support agriculture. In May 1816, frost killed off most crops in the higher elevations of Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Vermont, as well as upstate New York. On June 6, snow fell in Albany, New York, and Dennysville, Maine. In Cape May, New Jersey, frost was reported five {{nights in a row}} in late June, causing extensive crop damage.|$|E
25|$|This was, however, just {{political}} posturing on William's part, cynically exploiting certain prejudices in {{an attempt}} to gain ascendancy over the regents. More important as a matter of principle was the conflict over the reduction of the standing army that arose during 1649 and 1650. The regents understandably <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>quite</b> see the need for an expensive, large, mercenary standing army in peacetime. Holland demanded a reduction of the army to 26,000 (from a level of 35,000 in 1648), whereas William argued that the personnel needs were now appreciably larger, because the territory to be protected by garrisoned fortresses was now a great deal larger. Though the parties came close to an agreement on a total of about 29,000 men, the final difference of a few hundred men proved to be insurmountable.|$|E

25|$|He {{scored on}} the final day of the season against Wimbledon – it was his only senior goal of that campaign. By that game United were Premiership champions and Robson finally won the league {{championship}} medal that he had been trying to gain since his days at West Bromwich Albion some 15 years earlier. It was not just injuries that were restricting the 36-year-old Robson's first-team chances. Eric Cantona had been signed during the 1992–93 campaign and played up front with Mark Hughes, while Hughes's former strike-partner Brian McClair had been converted into a midfielder. This counted against Robson and the biggest blow came in the summer of 1993 when United signed Nottingham Forest's Roy Keane, but even this <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>quite</b> signal the end for Bryan Robson at Manchester United.|$|E
25|$|The {{decline of}} the Fauvist {{movement}} after 1906 {{did not affect the}} career of Matisse; many of his finest works were created between 1906 and 1917, when he was an active part of the great gathering of artistic talent in Montparnasse, even though he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>quite</b> fit in, with his conservative appearance and strict bourgeois work habits. He continued to absorb new influences. He travelled to Algeria in 1906 studying African art and Primitivism. After viewing a large exhibition of Islamic art in Munich in 1910, he spent two months in Spain studying Moorish art. He visited Morocco in 1912 and again in 1913 and while painting in Tangiers he made several changes to his work, including his use of black as a colour. The effect on Matisse's art was a new boldness in the use of intense, unmodulated colour, as in L'Atelier Rouge (1911).|$|E
25|$|Sergius {{sought to}} create a formula that {{would be able to}} fully please both the Chalcedonians and the Monophysites. The {{eventually}} forbade discussion on whether Christ had one or two energies within him and instead insisted that the Lord had two different natures incarnated within a single will and body. Sergious would lead to call this statement the Ecthesis, or Exposition. These beliefs were in similar accordance to the beliefs of Hominus. This furthered Sergius’ formula in realms of both Chalcedonian and Monophysite practice. It can be argued that Hominus <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>quite</b> understand the point of Sergius’ formula, but it is accepted that he supported it regardless. Still, the Ecthesis was not well received by all Chalcedonians; Sophronius viewed it poorly, to the point that he published a decree against it. Emperor Heraclius too was hesitant to sign off on Sergious’ work. While Sergius had finished the Ecthesis in 636, it was not signed into approval by Heraclius until 638, the same year as Sergius’ death.|$|E
