40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{forecast}} variability <b>in</b> <b>mortgage</b> rates by using interval measured data and interval computing method. Design/methodology/approach – Variability (interval) forecasts generated by the interval computing are compared with lower- and upper-bound forecasts based on the ordinary least squares (OLS) rolling regressions. Findings – On average, 56 per cent of annual changes <b>in</b> <b>mortgage</b> rates may be predicted by OLS lower- and upper-bound forecasts while the interval method improves forecasting accuracy to 72 per cent. Research limitations/implications – This paper uses the interval computing method to forecast variability <b>in</b> <b>mortgage</b> rates. Future studies may expand variability forecasting into more risk-managing areas. Practical implications – Results of this study may be interesting to executive officers of banks, mortgage companies, and insurance companies, builders, investors, and other financial decision makers with an interest <b>in</b> <b>mortgage</b> rates. Originality/value – Although it is well-known that changes <b>in</b> <b>mortgage</b> rates can significantly affect the housing market and economy, there is not much serious research that attempts to forecast variability <b>in</b> <b>mortgage</b> rates <b>in</b> the literature. This study is the first endeavor in variability forecasting for mortgage rates. Financial forecasting, Interest rates, Loans, United States of America...|$|R

We also discuss the economic aspects of security failure that might be an inherent problem of click <b>fraud</b> <b>in</b> mobile advertising.|$|R
