25|$|Introduced {{species have}} also {{provided}} recent “natural experiments” to investigate how rapidly character displacement can affect evolutionary change. When American mink (Mustela vison) {{were introduced in}} north-eastern Belarus, the native <b>European</b> <b>mink</b> (Mustela lutreola) increased in size, and the introduced mink decreased in size. This displacement was observed within a ten-year study, demonstrating that competition can drive rapid evolutionary change.|$|E
25|$|Human activities, mainly {{cultivation}} of the steppes, {{resulted in the}} disappearance of animals formerly common in the basin, such as tarpan, steppe antelope, saiga antelope, marmots and others. Back in the 1960s–1970s, especially near Oskol River, {{it was not unusual}} to meet bobak marmot, Eurasian deer, wild boar and Russian desman. Current mammals of the basin include European beaver, Dipodidae, suslik, mice, European otter, <b>European</b> <b>mink,</b> weasel and bats.|$|E
25|$|Like Cornwall, Wales and Ireland, {{the waters}} of Brittany attract marine animals {{including}} basking sharks, grey seals, leatherback turtles, dolphins, porpoises, jellyfish, crabs and lobsters. Bass is common along the coast, small-spotted catsharks live on the continental shelf, rattails and anglerfish populate the deep waters. River fish of note include trout, Atlantic salmon, pikes, shades and lampreys. The Breton rivers are also home to beavers and otters and to some invasive American species, such as the coypu which destroys the ecosystem and accelerated the extinction of the <b>European</b> <b>mink.</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Lyme {{disease is}} a {{widespread}} cosmopolitan zoonosis caused by species belonging to the genus Borrelia. It is transmitted from animal reservoir hosts to humans through hard - ticks of genus Ixodes which are vectors of the disease. Case presentation Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato infection was identified in a marbled polecat, Vormela peregusna, and two <b>European</b> <b>minks,</b> Mustela lutreola, from Romania, by PCR. RFLP revealed {{the presence of a}} single genospecies, Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto. Conclusions This is the first report of the Lyme disease spirochetes in the two mentioned hosts. </p...|$|R
30|$|Our results {{indicated}} that significant variation {{in the shape of}} the cranium and the mandible of the Neotropical otter is associated with geography. In other species of Mustelidae such as weasels, <b>European</b> <b>minks,</b> and <b>European</b> badgers (Lee and Mill 2004), it is assumed that this type of variation responds to the variation in environmental conditions throughout the distribution of the species (Kruuk 2006). The morphology of a species responds to select factors in the environment, in addition to limitations in the response of the phenotype to such factors. This has led to the proposal that the ecological and geographic distribution of populations is a reflection of the ecological range of a phenotype (Ricklefs and Miles 1994). In contrast, it has been reported that geographic differences do not always lead to a homologous effect on the shape and size of an anatomical structure, in this case the cranium, due to the high levels of plasticity and adaptation in size that have been observed in other mammals (Cardini et al. 2007). Our data indicates that for L. longicaudis, there are changes in shape as well as size between the GUs studied, suggesting the existence of different selective pressures to which the shape and size of the cranium and the mandible respond and different means of adaptation.|$|R
50|$|In 1933, American minks were {{released}} into the Voronezh Oblast in European Russia. Until 1963, more minks were introduced in various quantities in the Voronezh and Arkhangelsk Oblasts, Karelia, in Kalininsk, Gorkovsk, Volgograd and Chelyabinsk Oblasts, and into Tatarstan and Bashkir, {{as well as the}} Lithuanian and Byelorussian SSRs. Beyond the Urals, American minks were introduced in the Sverdlovsk, Tyumen, Omsk, Kemerovo, Novosibirsk, Chita and Irkutsk Oblasts, in the Altai and Krasnoyarsk Krai, in the Tuvan, Buryat and Yakut Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republics, into the Magadan, Kamchatka and Amur Oblasts, into the Khabarovsk and Primorsky Krai, into the Chukotka Autonomous Okrug and several other locations, including Sakhalin and Urup Island. In the Caucasus region, American minks {{were released}} into North Ossetia. In Central Asia they were released in the Tien Shan region. Originally, captive-bred minks were used, but wild specimens were later released to facilitate the species' acclimatisation within Soviet territories. Several years after the first release, introductions into the ranges already held by native <b>European</b> <b>minks</b> were discontinued, with most releases from then on taking place in Siberia and the Far East. Although considerable areas were occupied by the American mink by the early 1960s, the species' Soviet range was never continuous, as most released populations were isolated from one another.|$|R
2500|$|A {{number of}} rare or {{endangered}} species {{can be found}} in Põhja-Kõrvemaa, {{which is one of the}} main reasons behind the area's status as a nature reserve. It is home to large predators such as gray wolf, Eurasian lynx and brown bear. Small populations of <b>European</b> <b>mink</b> endured until the beginning of the 1990s, but are now disappeared, as in most of Estonia. [...] Protected bird species include black stork, golden eagle, capercaillie and common crane. Nineteen species of orchids {{can be found in}} Põhja-Kõrvemaa (for example, Goodyera repens and Platanthera bifolia), among other rare plants growing in the area are Pulsatilla patens, Sparganium angustifolium, Isoetes echinospora and Oxytropis sordida (the only place in Estonia where the plant is found).|$|E
50|$|The <b>European</b> <b>mink</b> {{is similar}} to the American mink, but with several {{important}} differences. The tail is longer in the American species, almost reaching half its body length. The winter fur of the American mink is denser, longer and more closely fitting then that of the <b>European</b> <b>mink.</b> Unlike the <b>European</b> <b>mink,</b> which has white patches on both upper and lower lips, the American mink almost never has white marks on the upper lip. The European mink's skull is much less specialised than the American species' in the direction of carnivory, bearing more infantile features, such as a weaker dentition and less strongly developed projections. The <b>European</b> <b>mink</b> is reportedly less efficient than the American species underwater.|$|E
50|$|The American mink was {{introduced}} and released in Europe during the 1920s-1930s. The American mink is {{less dependent on}} wetland habitats than the <b>European</b> <b>mink</b> and is 20-40% larger. The impact of feral American minks on <b>European</b> <b>mink</b> populations has been explained through the competitive exclusion principle and because the American mink reproduces a month earlier than the European species, and matings between male American minks and female European minks result in the embryos being reabsorbed. Thus, female European minks impregnated by male American minks are unable to reproduce with their conspecifics. Disease spread by the American mink can also account for the decline. Though {{the presence of the}} American mink has coincided with the decline of <b>European</b> <b>mink</b> numbers in Belarus and Estonia, the decline of the <b>European</b> <b>mink</b> in some areas preceded the introduction of the American mink by many years, and there are areas in Russia where the American species is absent, though <b>European</b> <b>mink</b> populations in these regions are still declining.|$|E
40|$|Introduced species often brings {{unforeseen}} and/or severe ecological impacts to ecosystem. These may {{be serving}} as vectors of disease, causing economic loss, ecosystem effects, reduction of biodiversity and interaction between species (e. g. predation, competition and introgression). So, {{it is important}} to do research about introduced species. Traditional research methods may be difficult when dealing with elusive introduced carnivores. Nowadays, non-invasive genetic sampling could be used to detect, identify and monitor invasive species. In this paper, I developed a protocol which uses 23 species specific primer pairs, based on mitochondrial DNA, to differentiate invasive raccoon dog and other native carnivores (European badger, red fox, pine marten, <b>European</b> otter, American <b>mink,</b> Eurasian lynx, domestic cat and domestic dog). PCR reactions were optimized by using muscle samples. Species identification requires amplification of one correct pair of primers and amplification failure of all the other primer pairs. My work offers an effective solution for the identification of invasive and native carnivores. In the future, this protocol can be used to monitor carnivore community in a large area by using field samples...|$|R
50|$|The taiga {{is home to}} {{a number}} of large herbivorous mammals, such as moose and reindeer/caribou. Some areas of the more {{southern}} closed boreal forest also have populations of other deer species such as the elk (wapiti) and roe deer. The largest animal in the taiga is the wood bison, found in northern Canada, Alaska and has been newly introduced into the Russian far-east. Small mammals of the Taiga biome include rodent species including beaver, squirrel, North American porcupine and vole, as well as a small number of lagomorph species such as snowshoe hare and mountain hare. These species have adapted to survive the harsh winters in their native ranges. Some larger mammals, such as bears, eat heartily during the summer in order to gain weight, and then go into hibernation during the winter. Other animals have adapted layers of fur or feathers to insulate them from the cold. Predatory mammals of the taiga must be adapted to travel long distances in search of scattered prey or be able to supplement their diet with vegetation or other forms of food (such as raccoons). Mammalian predators of the taiga include Canada lynx, Eurasian lynx, stoat, Siberian weasel, least weasel, sable, American marten, North American river otter, <b>European</b> otter, American <b>mink,</b> wolverine, Asian badger, fisher, gray wolf, coyote, red fox, brown bear, American black bear, Asiatic black bear, polar bear (only small areas at the taiga - tundra ecotone) and Siberian tiger.|$|R
50|$|American mink are {{believed}} {{by some to}} {{have contributed to the}} decline of the less hardy <b>European</b> <b>mink</b> through competition (though not through hybridization—native <b>European</b> <b>mink</b> are in fact more closely related to polecats than to their North American cousins). Trapping is used to control or eliminate feral American mink populations.|$|E
5000|$|Minks are dark-colored, semiaquatic, {{carnivorous}} mammals of the subgenus Lutreola, {{and part}} of the family Mustelidae which also includes weasels, otters and ferrets. There are two extant species referred to as [...] "mink": the American mink and the <b>European</b> <b>mink.</b> The extinct sea mink is related to the American mink, but was much larger. The American mink is larger and more adaptable than the <b>European</b> <b>mink.</b> Due to variations in size, an individual mink usually cannot be determined as European or American with certainty without looking at the skeleton. However, all <b>European</b> <b>mink</b> have a large white patch on their upper lip, whereas only some American mink have this marking. Therefore, any mink without the patch is certainly of the American species. Taxonomically, both American and <b>European</b> <b>mink</b> were placed in the same genus Mustela, but most recently, the American mink has been reclassified as belonging to its own genus Neovison.|$|E
50|$|<b>European</b> <b>mink</b> is a {{critically}} endangered mammal species which is resident in the reserve.|$|E
50|$|The {{earliest}} actual {{records of}} decreases in <b>European</b> <b>mink</b> numbers occurred in Germany, having already become extinct {{in several areas}} {{by the middle of}} the 18th century. A similar pattern occurred in Switzerland, with no records of minks being published in the 20th century. Records of minks in Austria stopped by the late 18th century. By the 1930s-1950s, the <b>European</b> <b>mink</b> became extinct in Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia and possibly Bulgaria. In Finland, the main decline occurred in the 1920s-1950s and the species was thought to be extinct in the 1970s, though a few specimens were reported in the 1990s. In Latvia, the <b>European</b> <b>mink</b> was thought to be extinct for years, until a specimen was captured in 1992. In Lithuania, the last specimens were caught in 1978-79. The decline of the <b>European</b> <b>mink</b> in Estonia and Belarus was rapid during the 1980s, with only a few small, fragmented populations in the northeastern regions of both countries being reported in the 1990s. The decline of <b>European</b> <b>mink</b> numbers in Ukraine began in the late 1950s, with now only a few small and isolated populations being reported in the upper courses of the Ukrainian Carpathian rivers. Their numbers in Moldova began to drop very quickly in the 1930s, with the last known population having been confined to the lower course of the River Prut on the Romanian border by the late 1980s. In Romania, the <b>European</b> <b>mink</b> was very common and widely distributed, with 8000-10,000 being captured in 1960. Currently, Romanian mink populations are confined to the Danube Delta. In European Russia, the <b>European</b> <b>mink</b> was common and widespread in the early 20th century, but began to decline during the 1950s-1970s. The core of their range was in the Tver Region, though they began to decline there by the 1990s, which was worsened by a colonisation of the area by the American mink. Between 1981 and 1989, 388 European minks were introduced to two of the Kurile Islands, though by the 1990s, the population there was found to be lower than that originally released. In France and Spain, an isolated range occurs, extending from Brittany to northern Spain. Data from the 1990s indicate the <b>European</b> <b>mink</b> has disappeared from the northern half of this previous range.|$|E

50|$|The American mink replaces and {{sometimes}} kills the <b>European</b> <b>mink</b> wherever their ranges overlap. The decline of <b>European</b> <b>mink</b> populations seems {{to coincide with}} the spread of the American mink. The diets of the American mink and European otter overlap to a great extent. In areas where these two species are sympatric, competition with the otter for fish causes the American mink to hunt land-based prey more frequently.|$|E
50|$|Habitat-related declines of <b>European</b> <b>mink</b> numbers {{may have}} started during the Little Ice Age, which was further aggravated by human activity. As the <b>European</b> <b>mink</b> is more {{dependent}} on wetland habitats than the American species, its decline in Central Europe, Estonia, Finland, Russia, Moldova and Ukraine {{has been linked to}} the drainage of small rivers. In mid-19th-century Germany, for example, <b>European</b> <b>mink</b> populations declined in a decade due to expanded land drainage. Although land improvement and river dredging certainly resulted in population decreases and fragmentation, in areas which still maintain suitable river ecosystems, such as Poland, Hungary, the former Czechoslovakia, Finland and Russia, the decline preceded the change in wetland habitats, and may have been caused by extensive agricultural development.|$|E

50|$|A Polecat-Mink Hybrid, {{also known}} as khor'-tumak by furriers and khonorik by fanciers, is a hybrid between a European polecat and a <b>European</b> <b>mink.</b> Such {{hybridisation}} is very rare in the wild, and typically only occurs where <b>European</b> <b>mink</b> are declining. The two species likely began hybridising during the early 20th century, when northern Europe underwent a warm climatic period which coincided with {{an expansion of the}} range of the polecat into the mink's habitat.|$|E
50|$|It {{is similar}} in colour to the American mink, but is {{slightly}} smaller and has a less specialised skull. Despite having a similar name, build and behaviour, the <b>European</b> <b>mink</b> is not {{closely related to the}} American mink, being much closer to the European polecat and Siberian weasel (kolonok). The <b>European</b> <b>mink</b> occurs primarily by forest streams unlikely to freeze in winter. It primarily feeds on voles, frogs, fish, crustaceans and insects.|$|E
50|$|Mammals {{present in}} Siysky Zakaznik include moose, wild boar, brown bear, lynx, wolverine, badger, beaver, <b>European</b> <b>mink,</b> European otter and others.|$|E
50|$|<b>European</b> <b>mink</b> is a {{critically}} endangered mammal species which is resident in the reserve. The reserve hosts the largest population of Eurasian curlew in Europe.|$|E
50|$|The polecat may be preyed upon by red foxes, {{and both}} wild and {{domestic}} cats. Although the polecat can coexist with the <b>European</b> <b>mink</b> (though {{there is one}} record of a polecat attacking a <b>European</b> <b>mink</b> and dragging it to its burrow), it suffers {{in areas where the}} invasive American mink also occurs, as the latter species feeds on the same mammalian species as the polecat much more frequently than the <b>European</b> <b>mink,</b> and has been known to drive the polecat out of wetland habitats. In areas where the European polecat is sympatric with the steppe polecat, the two species overlap greatly in choice of food, though the former tends to consume more household foods and birds, while the latter preys on mammals more frequently. There is at least one record of a beech marten killing a polecat. The European polecat may prey on the much smaller least weasel.|$|E
50|$|The European polecat (Mustela putorius) {{exhibited}} a rare dark phenotype {{similar to the}} <b>European</b> <b>mink</b> (Mustela lutreola) phenotype, which is directly influenced by peculiarities of forest brooks.|$|E
50|$|Predators of the <b>European</b> <b>mink</b> {{include the}} European polecat, the American mink, the golden eagle, large owls {{and the red}} fox. Red fox numbers have {{increased}} greatly {{in areas where the}} wolf and Eurasian lynx have been extirpated, as well as areas where modern forestry is practised. As red foxes are known to prey on mustelids, excessive fox predation on the <b>European</b> <b>mink</b> is a possible factor, though it is improbable to have been a factor in Finland, where fox numbers were low during the early 20th century.|$|E
50|$|The <b>European</b> <b>mink</b> was {{historically}} hunted extensively, {{particularly in}} Russia, where in some districts, the decline prompted a temporary ban on mink hunting {{to let the}} population recover. In the early 20th century, 40-60,000 European minks were caught annually in the Soviet Union, {{with a record of}} 75,000 individuals (an estimate which exceeds the modern global <b>European</b> <b>mink</b> population). In Finland, annual mink catches reached 3000 specimens in the 1920s. In Romania, 10,000 minks were caught annually around 1960. However, this reason alone cannot account for the decline in areas where hunting was less intense, such as in Germany.|$|E
50|$|Animals of {{the range}} include <b>European</b> <b>mink,</b> roe deer, wild boar and various small and medium mammals such as Pyrenean desmans and the European snow voles. There are {{amphibians}} such as the alpine newts.|$|E
50|$|In {{the park}} live over 40 {{different}} species of mammals, amongst them beech marten, common genet, European badger, European pine marten, <b>European</b> <b>mink,</b> European otter, fox, garden dormouse, hedgehog, red deer, red squirrel, roe deer and wild boar.|$|E

50|$|The large predators include brown bears, wolves, and wolverines. Ten {{mustelid}} species {{make the}} reserve their home, from the largest, the wolverine, to the least weasel, {{as well as}} the ermine, the American and <b>European</b> <b>mink,</b> the pine marten, the sable, and the Siberian weasel.|$|E
50|$|Although superficially {{similar to}} the <b>European</b> <b>mink,</b> studies {{indicate}} the American mink's closest relative is the Siberian weasel (kolonok) of Asia. The American mink has been recorded to hybridize with European minks and polecats in captivity, though the hybrid embryos of the American and European minks are usually reabsorbed.|$|E
50|$|The {{area of the}} Reserve is too small, {{and most}} of the animals do not reside there {{permanently}} but migrate.
