This was the old ironclad HMS Audacious which had borne the name whilst serving as a repair and store ship alternately at Scapa Flow and Rosyth between 1914 and 1920.

The Admiralty regarded shore accommodation as expensive and liable {{to lead to}} indiscipline. These <b>floating</b> <b>establishments</b> kept their names while the actual vessels housing them changed. For example, the gunnery training school at Portsmouth occupied three ships between its foundation in 1830 and its move ashore in 1891 but all were named (or renamed) HMS Excellent.|$|R

He ruled without fear or favor. He had political will. Most importantly, he remained simple and would walk to and from his office without any bodyguards. His funeral cortege, which I personally witnessed, was attended by legions of Kagay-anons, many of whom openly wept {{at the sight of}} his bier which was placed atop a decorated <b>float.</b> Shops and <b>establishments</b> were closed for business at their own behest." ...|$|R
