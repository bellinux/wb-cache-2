5|$|The {{game was}} delayed several times. In August 2012, the website XBLA Fans {{reported}} that the game would be delayed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> of that year. By October, a preview on the gaming website Twinfinite listed the release date as 31 December 2012. The game was released on the Xbox 360, Microsoft Windows, and Macintosh on 20 March 2013, and was released on the PlayStation 3 on 8 May 2013.|$|E
5|$|Both {{male and}} female mockingbirds sing, with the latter being {{generally}} quieter and less vocal. Male commencement of singing is in late January to February and continues into the summer and the establishing of territory <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>fall.</b> Frequency in female singing is more sporadic, as it sings less often {{in the summer and}} fall, and only sings when the male is away from the territory. The mockingbird also possesses a large song repertoire that ranges from 43 to 203 song types and the size varies by region. Repertoire sizes ranged from 14 to 150 types in Texas, and two studies of mockingbirds in Florida rounded estimates to 134 and 200, approximately. It continually expands its repertoire during its life, though it pales in comparison to mimids such as the brown thrasher.|$|E
5|$|Sanchez entered spring {{practice}} {{after the}} 2008 {{season as the}} front-runner {{to take over the}} starting quarterback position, but faced strong competition from redshirt freshman Aaron Corp and Mitch Mustain, a transfer from Arkansas, where he had been the starting quarterback; Mustain, like Sanchez, was named the top quarterback in the nation upon the conclusion of high school career in 2006. By the end of spring practice, Carroll announced Sanchez would be the starting quarterback heading <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>fall.</b> During the first week of fall camp, Sanchez dislocated his left kneecap during warm-ups prior to practice; trainers immediately put the kneecap back into place. After missing nearly three weeks, Sanchez was cleared to play in the opener against Virginia. Before the opener, Sanchez was contacted by USC's previous three quarterbacks—Carson Palmer, Leinart and Booty—who wished him well and offered general advice.|$|E

5|$|The 45th Infantry Division, {{along with}} the 7th Infantry Division, fought off {{repeated}} Chinese attacks all along the front line throughout 1952, and Chinese forces frequently attacked Old Baldy Hill <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> of that year. Around that time, the 45th Infantry Division relinquished command of Old Baldy Hill to the 2nd Infantry Division. Almost immediately the Chinese launched a concentrated attack on the hill, overrunning the U.S. forces. Heavy rainstorms prevented the divisions from retaking the hill for around a month, {{and when it was}} finally retaken it was heavily fortified to prevent further attacks. The 245th Tank Battalion was sent to assault Chinese positions throughout late 1952, but most of the division held a stationary defensive line against the Chinese.|$|E

25|$|During {{the summer}} and <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>fall,</b> the Alaska Marine Highway {{operates}} the Tustumena. The Tustumena stops in Sand Point four times per month. From Sand Point the ferry goes to King Cove, Cold Bay, False Pass and Dutch Harbor. The ship has staterooms and dining room service. The ferry takes cars and trucks. Though as of 2017 the ferry had been delayed causing a hindrance for communities all along the chain.|$|E
25|$|The {{submarine}} conducted regular {{operations with}} the Atlantic Fleet Submarine Force into 1974, operating off {{the east coast}} and in the Caribbean Sea. Following one Caribbean cruise {{in the fall of}} 1974, Tullibee departed New London on 28 April 1975 for her second deployment to the Sixth Fleet. After operating in the Mediterranean <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> of that year, the submarine returned to New London in October {{for an extended period of}} upkeep.|$|E
25|$|In July 1964, Tullibee {{participated in}} fleet {{exercises}} in anti-submarine warfare (ASW) tactics with NATO units. The submarine resumed developmental work in 1965 and operated in this capacity <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> of that year. On 28 October, her home port was temporarily changed to Portsmouth, New Hampshire, {{when the ship}} entered the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery, Maine, for an extensive overhaul. She remained in drydock for 754 days (2 years and 24 days), emerging on 2 January 1968.|$|E

25|$|Arriving at {{the latter}} on 19 June 1971, Schenectady {{remained}} {{on the west coast}} <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>fall,</b> and on 1 October 1971 departed San Diego with six other units comprising PhibRon 5. On the 14th, it joined the 7th Fleet. Four days later, it arrived at Yokosuka, Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan. Upkeep in Japan and training operations in the Ryukyu Island chain southwest of Japan followed. From there, it moved into the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, conducted survey operations, and returned to Okinawa to load diesel electric generating plants for delivery to the government of the Philippines for use in its rural electrification program.|$|E
25|$|Oiceoptoma noveboracense is {{a member}} of the family Silphidae, or carrion beetles, which feed on {{decaying}} organic matter such as dead animals. Its common name is the margined carrion beetle, from the orange-red margins on the pronotum, which are helpful when identifying this species. The larva is typically light brown to red and also has vertical ridges on its thorax like the adult. This diurnal beetle can be found mainly in the spring <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>fall,</b> and it has a strong preference towards a deciduous forest habitat. The primary forensic importance of this beetle is its ability to use the succession of insect fauna to provide confirmation of postmortem intervals.|$|E
25|$|His {{acting career}} began by {{accident}} in 1934. While at a YMCA {{to apply for}} a job as a laborer, Lee stumbled upon an audition in progress and was recognized by playwright Augustus Smith. Lee was invited to try out, and won a supporting role in Brother Mose, directed by Frank H. Wilson. Sponsored by New York's Civil Works Administration, the show toured the boroughs, playing at community centers and city parks <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> of the year. In October 1934 Lee succeeded Rex Ingram in the Theatre Union's revival of Stevedore, which toured to Chicago, Detroit and other U.S. cities after its run on Broadway. It was his first professional role.|$|E

25|$|After {{stumbling}} out of {{the gates}} with a sub-.500 start in April, the Rangers took the division lead with a franchise-best month of June, going 21–6. The Rangers would never relinquish first place after an 11-game winning streak. On July 9, the club dealt one of its top prospects, Justin Smoak, with two other minor leaguers to the Seattle Mariners for former Cy Young Award winner Cliff Lee and Mark Lowe. The Rangers also made moves to acquire veterans Bengie Molina, Jorge Cantú, Cristian Guzmán, and Jeff Francoeur. In the 2010 All-Star Game, the team was represented by Cliff Lee, Vladimir Guerrero, Ian Kinsler, Josh Hamilton, Elvis Andrus, and Neftalí Feliz. After the All-Star Game, came the debut of the claw and antler hand gestures, which gained much popularity, especially {{after the release of}} various apparel and souvenir options for the fans. Foam claws and helmets with deer antlers became quite commonplace in the ballpark as the Rangers played further <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>fall.</b> The Rangers won the A.L. West on September 25, advancing to the postseason {{for the first time since}} 1999.|$|E
25|$|Yorktown {{emerged from}} the {{shipyard}} in January 1961 and returned to Long Beach on 27 January. She conducted refresher training and then resumed normal west coast operations until late July. On 29 July, the aircraft carrier stood out of Long Beach, bound once again for the Orient. She made an extended stopover in the Hawaiian Islands in August and, consequently, did not arrive in Yokosuka until 4 September. That {{tour of duty in}} the Far East consisted of a normal schedule of anti-air and antisubmarine warfare exercises as well as the usual round of port visits. She concluded the deployment at Long Beach on 2 March 1962. Normal west coast operations occupied her time through the summer and <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>fall.</b> On 26 October 1962, the warship left Long Beach in her wake and set a course for Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, then on to Japan, Hong Kong, and the Philippines in the Far East. During that deployment, she served as flagship for Carrier Division 19. She participated in several ASW and AAW exercises, including the SEATO ASW exercise, Operation Sea Serpent. The deployment lasted until 6 June 1963, at which time the carrier set a course back to Long Beach.|$|E
25|$|Further {{adding to}} the {{financial}} pressure on the debt situation, in May 1994, Moody's downgraded Canada's debt, citing the high debt levels and concerns about a lack of political will {{to deal with the}} deficit. A vicious circle had been created. The underwhelming 1994 budget was taken as a sign that the Liberals were not serious about eliminating the deficit, which in turn created severe doubts amongst investors holding or considering buying government of Canada bonds that they would be repaid when the bonds matured. As a result, investors cease buying government of Canada bonds, which forced the Bank of Canada to raise the interest rates in order to attract buyers of Canada bonds. The rising interest rates, besides for hindering economic activity and thus hurting the government's ability to collect taxes, raised the costs of servicing the existing national debt, which in turn created further doubts amongst investors that they would be repaid, and thus started the circle all over again. As the vicious circle caused by the lack of investor confidence and rising interest rates continued <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> of 1994, the 3% target became increasingly unlikely to be achieved, and thus Martin became more and more influenced by Dodge's advice that something more drastic needed to be done than achieving the 3% target.|$|E

500|$|Hex Enduction Hour takes {{influence}} from the Velvet Underground's [...] "Sister Ray", Captain Beefheart {{and the early}} 1970s Krautrock band Can. Smith {{has said that the}} title was intended to invoke witchcraft, that he concocted the word [...] "Enduction" [...] to suggest the album could be a listener's induction <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Fall</b> and that [...] "Hex" [...] was a reference to this being the band's sixth release. His vocals are higher in the mix than on previous Fall releases and were described in 1982 by Sounds as [...] "emerg like a loudhailer from a fog of guitar scratch". The songs were deliberately produced in a raw and low-fi approach by Smith, Grant Showbiz and Richard Mazda in a sound described at the time as a [...] "well produced noise" [...] that was acceptable by Fall standards. Critic Mark Storace claimed that he [...] "could {{have done a better job}} on a 4-track if I was pissed out of my head". Smith responded by saying that [...] "nowadays people just can't just shut up if they don't know what they're talking about." [...] Elaborating on the purposely amateurish production values, Smith remarked that [...] "it was all recorded in deliberately bad places...deliberately simple sort of thing. Three songs were written at rehearsal and done the next time." ...|$|E
