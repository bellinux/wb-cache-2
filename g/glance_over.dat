500|$|Largely {{because of}} Champney’s {{promotion}} of the area, these artists traveled to North Conway in the summer to paint. [...] The area was filled with artists painting en plein air. [...] By 1855, North Conway had become [...] " [...] … the pet valley of our landscape painters. [...] There are always {{a dozen or more}} here during the sketching season, and you can hardly <b>glance</b> <b>over</b> the meadows, in any direction, without seeing one of their white umbrellas shining in the sun," [...] thus echoing Champney's own words. [...] By the 1850s, North Conway had arguably become the first artist colony in the United States. [...] Winslow Homer (18361910) depicted these artists in his 1868 painting titled [...]|$|E
500|$|Crisler said Chappuis was [...] "the finest passer I {{have ever}} handled and {{probably}} one of the best I've ever seen. He plays as though he had ice water in his veins." [...] Crisler felt that [...] "great passers are born," [...] and the difference between a great and a merely good passer is in the eyes. Time noted that Chappuis had great field vision for his downfield receivers and for oncoming defenders. [...] "Like a good baseball catcher, he throws the ball off his right ear, with a snap motion. He throws what the coaches call a ‘heavy ball.’" [...] Another writer noted that Chappuis was [...] "endowed with a passer's sixth sense, ‘split vision,’" [...] and an ability to [...] "pick out his receiver after one <b>glance</b> <b>over</b> the field." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Bad Seed, {{published}} in April 1954, {{was a critical}} and commercial success, and introduced Rhoda Penmark, an eight-year-old sociopath and burgeoning serial killer. The novel became an instant bestseller and was widely praised by critics for its use of suspense and horror. James Kelley writes, for The New York Times Book Review, [...] "The Bad Seed scores a direct hit, either as exposition of a problem or {{as a work of}} art. Venturing a prediction and a <b>glance</b> <b>over</b> the shoulder: no more satisfactory novel will be written in 1954 or has turned up in recent memory." [...] Although March lived long enough to see the critical praise bestowed upon the novel and hear of its commercial success, he died before the novel's full impact became apparent. It went on to sell more than a million copies, was nominated for the 1955 National Book Award, adapted into a successful and long-running Broadway play by Maxwell Anderson, and was adapted for film twice, in 1956 (directed by Mervyn LeRoy) and in 1985 (directed by Paul Wendkos).|$|E
