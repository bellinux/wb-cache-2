From 1991, the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory (CGRO) and its Burst and Transient Source Explorer (BATSE) instrument, an extremely sensitive gamma-ray detector, provided data {{that showed the}} distribution of GRBs is isotropic—not biased towards any particular direction in space. If the sources were from within our own galaxy they would be strongly concentrated {{in or near the}} galactic plane. The absence of any such pattern in the case of GRBs provided strong evidence that gamma-ray bursts must come from beyond the Milky Way.

The distance measurement and the calculations of the burst's total energy release unequivocally supported the latter theory, effectively ending the debate.|$|E

Ecliptic comets have relatively small orbits, below 10AU, and follow the ecliptic plane, the same plane in which the planets lie. All long-period comets have very large orbits, {{on the order of}} thousands of AU, and appear from every direction in the sky.

40|$|Abstract. We {{give new}} {{algorithms}} for learning halfspaces in the challenging malicious noise model, where an adversary may corrupt both the labels {{and the underlying}} distribution of examples. Our algorithms can tolerate malicious noise rates exponentially larger than previous work {{in terms of the}} dependence on the dimension n, and succeed for the fairly broad class of all <b>isotropic</b> log-concave <b>distributions.</b> We give poly(n, 1 /ǫ) -time algorithms for solving the following problems to accuracy ǫ: – Learning origin-centered halfspaces in R n with respect to the uniform distribution on the unit ball with malicious noise rate η = Ω(ǫ 2 /log(n/ǫ)). (The best previous result was Ω(ǫ/(nlog(n/ǫ)) 1 / 4).) – Learning origin-centered halfspaces with respect to any <b>isotropic</b> log-concave <b>distribution</b> on R n with malicious noise rate η = Ω(ǫ 3 /log(n/ǫ)). This is the first efficient algorithm for learning under <b>isotropic</b> log-concave <b>distributions</b> in the presence of malicious noise. We also give a poly(n, 1 /ǫ) -time algorithm for learning origin-centered halfspaces under any <b>isotropic</b> log-concave <b>distribution</b> on R n in the presence of adversarial label noise at rate η = Ω(ǫ 2 /log(1 /ǫ)). In the adversarial label noise setting (or agnostic model), labels can be noisy, but not example points themselves. Previous results could handle η = Ω(ǫ) but had running time exponential in an unspecified function of 1 /ǫ. Our analysis crucially exploits both concentration and anti-concentration properties of <b>isotropic</b> log-concave <b>distributions.</b> Our algorithms combine an iterative outlier removal procedure using Principal Component Analysis together with “smooth ” boosting. ...|$|R
