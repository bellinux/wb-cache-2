50|$|Mustelus canis can {{be known}} as smooth dogfish, Atlantic smooth dogfish, <b>dusky</b> <b>smooth-hound,</b> grayish, nurse shark, smooth dog, or smooth-hound. Mustelus canis were {{originally}} named Squalls canis, but was later changed. In Latin, mustelus translates to weasel-like and canis translates to dog. Mustelus canis has an allopatric relationship with Mustelus mustelus (Common smooth-hound) and a sympatric relationship with Mustelus norrisi (Narrowfin smooth-hound).|$|E
5000|$|Other {{highlights}} of the aquarium include free personal tours by aquarium staff and a focus on completely local species. Animals include an abnormally large American lobster and a blue lobster (shell changed blue due to an unusual discoloration), a common octopus, and lined seahorses. [...] Local favorites are also on display and include American eels, the <b>dusky</b> <b>smooth-hound,</b> sea robins, Raja erinacea, Loligo pealei, and Aurelia aurita.|$|E
50|$|The {{displays}} often {{change because}} the aquarium's staff incorporate {{the animals that}} they find into the exhibits. The largest tank that the aquarium contains is 400 gallons, {{and there is also}} a larger outdoor tank that overlooks Nantucket Harbor. This circular outdoor tank is known to house larger fish such as scup and black sea bass, but also small sharks called <b>dusky</b> <b>smooth-hounds,</b> or smooth dogfish. The rooms also include tanks for trigger fish, lobsters, mantis shrimp, tropical fish, and common local species (such as the aforementioned aquarium highlights).|$|R
40|$|This report reviews {{diseases}} of 1546 elasmobranchs representing at least 60 species submitted to Northwest ZooPath from 1994 to 2010. Cownose rays (Rhinoptera bonasus) (78), southern rays (Dasyatis americana) (75), <b>dusky</b> <b>smooth-hounds</b> (Mustelus canis) (74), bonnethead sharks (Sphyrna tiburo) (66), and bamboo sharks (Hemiscylliidae) (56) {{were the most}} commonly submitted species. Infectious/inflammatory disease was most common (33. 5 %) followed by nutritional (11. 9 %, mostly emaciation), traumatic (11. 3 %), cardiovascular (5. 5 %, mostly shock), and toxin-associated disease (3. 7 %). Bacterial infections (518 / 1546, 15 %) included sepsis (136 / 518, 26 %), dermatitis (7 %), branchitis (6 %), and enteritis (4 %). Fungal infections (10 / 1546, 0. 6 %) included dermatitis (30 %), hepatitis (30 %), and branchitis (20 %). Viral or suspected viral infections or disease processes (15 / 1546, 1 %) included papil-lomatosis (47 %), herpesvirus (20 %), and adenovirus (7 %). Parasitic infections (137 / 1546, 9 %) included nematodiasis (36 / 137, 26 %), ciliate infections (23 %), trematodiasis (20 %), coccidiosis (6 %), myxozoanosis (5 %), amoebiasis (4 %), cestodiasis (1 %), and flagellate infections (1 %). Inflammation of unknown cause (401 / 1546, 26 %) included enteritis (55 / 401, 14 %), branchitis (9 %), encephalitis (9 %), and dermatitis (7 %). Traumatic diseases (174 / 1546, 11. 3 %) included skin trauma (103 / 174, 60 %), stress/maladaptation (9 %), and gut trauma (7 %). Toxicoses (57 / 1546, 4 %) included toxic gill disease (16 / 57, 26 %), gas bubble disease (19 %), fenbenda-zole (7 %), ammonia (7 %), chlorine (5 %), and chloramine (3 %). Species trends included visceral nematodiasis in black-nosed sharks (Carcharhinus acronotus) (55 %); sepsis in <b>dusky</b> <b>smooth-hounds</b> (41 %), blue-spotted stingrays (36 %), southern rays (36 %), and wobeggong sharks (Orectolobus spp) (69 %); emaciation in bamboo (33 %) and bonnethead (32 %) sharks and freshwater stingrays (Potamotrygon motoro) (32 %); and trauma in bonnethead sharks (30 %) ...|$|R
