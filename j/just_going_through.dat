He added that while the existing band members might record together, it would not be as Thin Lizzy. In 2007, Gorham said that Lynott still received the biggest cheer of the night at concerts, and that the current Thin Lizzy was not active simply for money. [...] "We'd stop if we thought we were <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>through</b> the motions... I think that has a lot to do with the songs – if they were inferior, then maybe we would have got tired of it all. But they're not and we haven't," [...] he said. In January 2011, Gorham maintained that Lynott would have approved of the continuation of the band: [...] "He worked long hours and travelled thousands of miles to get it to a certain level. There's no way he would have said 'No-one should play those songs again.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|In February 2008, it was {{announced}} that Mickey and his stepfather Keith were being axed from EastEnders. The characters were two of several axed by executive producer Diederick Santer that year. Others included Gus Smith, Steven Beale, and Honey Mitchell. According to The Sun newspaper, producers told Joe Swash that they had run out of storylines for his character. A friend of Swash was quoted as saying, [...] "Joe was stunned at first. He’s loved playing Mickey and felt the fans still enjoyed watching his antics. But he soon realised if the stories weren’t there, he didn’t want to be <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>through</b> the motions." [...] Their axing lead to further disbandment of the Miller/Swann family. Both Mickey and Keith survived the axe in 2006 when Rosie and Demi Miller were written out. Darren Miller and Dawn Swann, the only remaining family members, were kept on.|$|E

2500|$|The {{style of}} film is {{presented}} in a nonlinear narrative. Each scene is introduced using a title card showing which of the 500 days it is. Co-writer of the film Scott Neustadter admitted the film {{was based on a}} real romance. Neustadter explains that when he met the real girl who inspired the character Summer as a student at the London School of Economics in 2002, he was rebounding from a bad breakup back home, and promptly fell [...] "crazily, madly, hopelessly in love" [...] with the girl who [...] "returned his kisses but not his ardor." [...] The ending of the relationship was [...] "painfully and unforgettably awful," [...] which prompted him to co-write the film with Michael H. Weber. When Neustadter later showed the script to Summer's real life counterpart, she said she related more to the Tom character. Weber also stated that, [...] "we've all been in the trenches of love, we've all gone through the highs and lows, so Scott and I felt {{that the only way to}} tell this story was to come at it from a completely real place. It was pretty interesting for us because Scott was <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>through</b> a break-up and I was in a long-term relationship, so we each brought a totally opposite perspective, living it and not living it, and I think that tension helped to bring out more of the comedy".|$|E

During an interview from a tour stop in Tulsa she told The Boston Phoenix: [...] "I {{was inspired to}} write it when someone said something to me— I didn’t know him, and I {{thought he might be}} clairvoyant. I was in a relationship and I was completely unhappy. But I was hiding it. I was being completely abused and I was trying to cover it up; I wouldn’t even admit it to myself. So then I had spoken maybe 10 or 15 words to this guy, who was a friend of a friend. We were waiting for everyone else to show up, and we went into a restaurant and got a table. And {{he looked at me and}} said, ‘Are you happy?’ And I felt my heart leap, and I was like, he totally knows what I’m thinking. And I lied, I said I was fine. Anyway, he's not really clairvoyant. But he is a sociology major." [...] Lee said in a VH1 interview: [...] "Open-mindedness. It's about waking up to all the things you've been missing for so long. One day someone said something that made my heart race for a second and I realized that for months I'd been numb, <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>through</b> the motions of life." [...] During an interview with Blender, Lee claimed that she wrote [...] "Bring Me to Life" [...] about her longtime friend, Josh Hartzler, whom she married in 2007.|$|E
2500|$|In 2005's Infinite Crisis miniseries, it was {{revealed}} that the Earth-Two Lois Lane Kent, along with Superboy, Alexander Luthor, Jr., and Superman, have been watching the events of the post-Crisis DC Universe from their pocket dimension. Out of the four observers, she {{is the only one who}} still believes that the new universe is <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>through</b> a rough patch; Superboy Prime and Alex Luthor are convinced that Earth is utterly corrupt, and Kal-L is slowly becoming swayed to their way of thinking. This version of Lois is frail, and died for reasons not explicitly revealed, though probably connected to her octogenarian status. This was the main reason for Kal-L's determination to restore Earth-Two, as he believed that Lois' health would recover once back on her proper Earth. Despite the restoration of Earth-Two, Lois Lane Kent died in the arms of her husband, Superman, in Infinite Crisis #5, regardless of Kal-L's protests that he could not let her die. After Kal-L died at the hands of Superboy-Prime at the end of Infinite Crisis #7, he commented that he finally understood Lois' final words [...] "It's... not... going..." [...] as meaning that it would never end for them, and one day it would be understood that even the heroes who had been lost in the original Crisis were still out there somewhere. After his demise, they are shown reunited in the stars, while their bodies are buried on Earth alongside Kon-El's, who gave his life to stop Superboy-Prime's attempts to restore his Earth.|$|E

Five or six thousand pounds--six would be ten per cent. on sixty! Exactly! Scrivens--young Pillin had said! But Crow & Donkin, not Scriven & Coles, were old Heythorp's solicitors.

40|$|Until recently, the {{conversation}} on originalism {{and the role of}} precedent has been dominated by two main camps, which I will call unoriginal originalists and unprecedented precedentialists. Unoriginal originalists refers to people who purport to pay close attention to text, history, and structure, but when these sources conflict with precedent, this camp basically does not have a theory at all. The theory becomes a sort of muddling through, sometimes following precedent and sometimes not. If one, however, is <b>just</b> <b>going</b> to muddle <b>through,</b> or be pragmatic about when to follow precedent, does that not undercut the very grounds on which one is an originalist in the first place?

I can imagine exactly how a Louis Quatorze artist would have dealt with the subject,--an arena, prettily sanded, with here and there gooseberry bushes and wild gilly flowers (not too wild, of course), lions with flowing manes, in noble attitudes, about to roar,--tigers, finely developed, about to spring,--Christians <b>just</b> <b>going</b> to pray,--and <b>through</b> it all a genial open-air feeling very soothing to the royal senses.

50|$|Also {{cited as}} an {{influence}} by Davis {{was the work}} of experimental composer Karlheinz Stockhausen, in particular his forays into electronic music and tape manipulation. Davis was first introduced to Stockhausen's work in 1972 by collaborator Paul Buckmaster, and the trumpeter reportedly kept a cassette recording of the 1966-67 Hymnen composition in his Lamborghini sports car. Some concepts from Stockhausen that appealed to Davis included the electronic sound processing found in Hymnen and the 1966 piece Telemusik, and the development of musical structures by expanding and minimizing processes based on preconceived principles—as featured in Plus-Minus and other Stockhausen works from the 1960s and early 1970s. Davis began to apply these ideas to his music by adding and taking away instrumentalists and other aural elements throughout a recording to create a progressively changing soundscape. Speaking about Stockhausen's influence, Davis later wrote in his autobiography: I had always written in a circular way and through Stockhausen I could see that I didn't want to ever play again from eight bars to eight bars, because I never end songs: they <b>just</b> keep <b>going</b> on. <b>Through</b> Stockhausen I understood music as a process of elimination and addition.|$|R
