40|$|Severe, {{invasive}} group A streptococcal infections have reemerged worldwide, and extracellular toxins, including streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin B (SpeB), {{have been}} implicated in pathogenesis. The genetic regulation of SpeB is not fully understood, and the mechanisms involved in the processing of the protoxin to its <b>enzymatically</b> <b>active</b> form have not been definitively established. The present work demonstrated that the genes encoding SpeB (speB) and a peptidyl-prolyl isomerase (prsA) constitute an operon with transcription initiated from two promoters upstream of speB. Further, the speB-prsA operon was transcribed as a bicistronic mRNA. This finding {{is in contrast to}} the generally accepted notion that speB is transcribed only as a monocistronic gene. In addition, prsA has its own promoter, and transcription from this promoter starts in early log phase, prior to the transcription of speB. Genomic disruption of prsA decreased the production of <b>enzymatically</b> <b>active</b> SpeB but not the level of the pro-SpeB zymogen.

40|$|We {{previously}} reported that virus-specific particles with polycytidylate [poly(C) ]-dependent RNA polymerase activity accumulated at 30 degrees C in reovirus-infected cells. These particles sedimented heterogeneously from 300 to 550 S and traversed through a 40 % glycerol cushion to the pellet in 3 h at 190, 000 x g. In the present report, {{we found that}} smaller particles with poly(C) -dependent RNA polymerase activity remained in the glycerol cushion. These smaller, <b>enzymatically</b> <b>active</b> particles, when purified, sedimented at 15 to 1 S. They were spherical or triangular with a diameter of 11 to 12 nm. They were comprised mostly, and likely solely, of one reovirus protein, sigma NS. No particles with poly(C) -dependent RNA polymerase activity were found in mock-infected cells. Chromatography on the cation exchanger, CM-Sephadex, ascertained that sigma NS was the poly(C) -dependent RNA polymerase and showed its existence in two forms.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} balance between trypsin and {{protease}} inhibitors simultaneously in the systemic circulation and in the thoracic lymph and peritoneal exudate. METHODS: Twenty patients with early severe acute pancreatitis were studied. <b>Enzymatically</b> <b>active</b> and immunoreactive trypsin in conjunction with its major inhibitors were measured in the 3 compartments {{at the onset of}} end-organ failure(s). The molecular forms of trypsin were determined in the lymph and ascites by gel filtration chromatography to separate trypsinogen and free-and inhibitor-bound trypsin. RESULTS: Both <b>enzymatically</b> <b>active</b> trypsin and immunoreactive trypsin levels were highest in ascites and lymph compared with the systemic circulation. Intracompartmental alpha 1 - protease inhibitor gradient moved in the opposite direction, whereas alpha 2 macroglobulin concentration was highest in ascites and lowest in the lymph. Although most of the enzymatically and immunoreactive material in ascites and lymph consisted of trypsin complexed with alpha 2 macroglobulin and trypsinogen, respectively, free active trypsin was detected in more than 80 % of the samples. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with early severe acute pancreatitis, there is a significant trypsinogen activation resulting in protease-antiprotease imbalance and thereby free <b>enzymatically</b> <b>active</b> trypsin in the 2 body fluid compartments in close vicinity to the inflammatory process. This may be involved in the pathophysiology of local and distant tissue damage...|$|R
40|$|Catalases, {{although}} synthesized from single {{genes and}} built up from only {{one type of}} subunit, exist in heterogeneous form {{with respect to their}} conformations and association states in biological systems. This heterogeneity is not of genetic origin, but rather reflects the instability of this oligomeric heme enzyme. To understand better the factors that stabilize the various association states of catalase, we performed studies on the multimeric intermediates that are stabilized during guanidine-hydrochloride- and urea-induced unfolding of bovine liver catalase (BLC). For the first time, we have observed an <b>enzymatically</b> <b>active,</b> folded dimer of native BLC. This dimer has slightly higher enzymatic activity and altered structural properties compared to the native tetramer. Comparative studies of the effect of NaCl, GdmCl, and urea on BLC show that cation binding to negatively charged groups present in amino acid side chains of the enzyme leads to stabilization of an <b>enzymatically</b> <b>active,</b> folded dimer of BLC. Besides the folded dimer, an <b>enzymatically</b> <b>active</b> expanded tetramer and a partially unfolded, enzymatically inactive dimer of BLC were also observed. A complete recovery of native enzyme was observed on refolding of expanded tetramers and folded dimers; however, a very low recovery (maximum of ∼ 5 %) of native enzyme was observed on refolding of partially unfolded dimers and fully unfolded monomers...|$|R

Although mature CS was <b>enzymatically</b> <b>active</b> after release, activity could be detected neither for the precursor CS nor for corresponding glutathione-S-transferase fusion proteins. In contrast, two other shikimate pathway enzymes (shikimate kinase and 5 -enol-pyruvylshikimate- 3 -phosphate synthase) have previously {{been shown to}} be as <b>enzymatically</b> <b>active</b> as their respective higher molecular weight precursors.

Expression levels in E. coli approached 1 % of total soluble protein. No differences were found between authentic CS isolated from cell cultures and CS expressed in and purified from E. coli, which made possible a more detailed biochemical characterization of CS.
