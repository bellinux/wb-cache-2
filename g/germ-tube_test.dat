40|$|Background: Fungal {{vaginitis}} originates from yeasts {{that are}} active in the mucosa of the women‘s genital tract. The main yeast that causesfungal vaginitis is Candida albicans. Objectives: The current study aimed to detect frequency of yeasts mainly C. albicans in vaginal specimens of women from Tabriz, Iran. Forthe above purpose, the sensitivity and specifity of traditional laboratory assays were {{compared with those of}} molecular method (PCR) byuniversal and species primers to detect C. albicans in vaginal samples. Patients and Methods: In this study, 250 vaginal specimens were collected from women in Tabriz, East-Azerbaijan province, Iran during 2009 - 2010. Samples were examined to identify C. albicans by <b>germ-tube</b> <b>test,</b> chlamydoconidium formation test, preparation of wet smear usingpotassium hydroxide, and Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). Results: 162 yeast species from 250 specimens were isolated in Sabroud Dextrose Agar (SDA) Medium. 106 (65. 4 %) of them were germ tubeformation positive, 86 (53 %) chlamydoconidium formation positive and 101 (62. 4 %) were PCR positive. Yeast cells and mycelia were detected inthe isolates on direct microscopic examination. C. albicans accounted for 66. 04 % of cases and 34 % were non-C. albicans species. Conclusions: In conclusion, PCR may be the best method to detect Candida species...|$|E
40|$|Background: The fungus C. albicans {{is among}} the leading agents causing death in immunocompromised patients. Most {{hospitals}} rely on conventional morphological techniques such as the germ-tube assay and the API system for correct identifi cation. This technique is subjective and hence error prone. Recently, more and more molecular techniques for correct identifi cation have been developed. The latest is the LightCycler real-time PCR technique coupled with melting curve analysis. Material/Methods: One hundred hospital isolates presumed to be C. albicans from four major Lebanese hospitals were tested using the real-time PCR technique. The results were compared with a <b>germ-tube</b> <b>test.</b> Furthermore, all real-time PCR-positive samples were replica plated on growth media at 30 °C and 45 °C to differentiate between C. albicans and C. dubliniensis. Finally, all PCR-negative samples were identifi ed using the API 20 C AUX yeast identifi cation system. Results: Twenty-four hospital isolates were non-albicans by PCR (ppC. albicans-negative isolates were misidentifi ed by the API 20 C AUX. None of the C. albicans real-time PCR-positive samples failed to grow at 45 °C, the dubliniensis non-permissive temperature. Conclusions: Considering the impact of false identifi cation on the general public health {{through the use of}} wrong antifungal drug treatment and the emergence of novel drug-resistant strains, hospitals should update their classifi cation methods using molecular techniquesPublishedN/...|$|E

40|$|Variability in fungal {{features}} in 30 isolates of C. gloeosporioides f. sp. manihotis Henn (Penz). Sacc (causal organism of cassava anthracnose disease CAD), from seven cassava growing regions of Nigeria (Oyo, Ogun, Ondo, Osun, Plateau, Kwara and Cross River State), where {{the disease is}} prevalent, were investigated {{on the basis of}} culture, morphology and pathogenicity. Culture and morphology showed variations in mycelial pigmentation, growth media colour, radial growth pattern, presence or absence of setae and acervuli production amongst isolates. Spore morphology differed (P< 0. 05) in conidial length, spore density, <b>germ-tube</b> development. Pathogenicity <b>test</b> showed significant differences (P< 0. 05) in virulence amongst the isolates. All thirty isolates were pathogenic to two test cassava genotypes, causing necrotic lesions after artificial inoculation by stem puncture. Fungal isolates 05, 10 and 26 were more virulent, causing lesion size exceeding 20 mm in susceptible test cassava genotypes at 21 days after inoculation. The relationship among fungal growth parameters (mycelial growth, conidial length, spore germination and sporulation density), and virulence of the fungal isolates, showed a significant positive correlation between spore germination and sporulation (r= 0. 72), spore germination and virulence (r= 0. 76). Sporulation was significantly correlated with virulence (r= 0. 83), but not correlated with conidial length (r= 0. 19) ...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to test the {{hypothesis}} that the oral biology of yeasts in children alters in response to presence of an upper removable appliance (URA). Thirty-four normal controls and 34 patients, undergoing removable orthodontic appliance treatment were studied. Saliva samples were obtained from all subjects along with a foam imprint from the tting surface of the URA in the case of patients. Samples were cultured on CHROMagar Candida. Colonies that were green–blue in colour were con rmed as Candida albicans by the <b>germ-tube</b> <b>test.</b> Other yeasts were identi ed by means of commercial identi cation kits. Oral yeast species were isolated from 32. 3 % of healthy controls compared with 76. 5 % of children with a URA (pB 0. 01). C. albicans was the most prevalent species isolated from saliva and appliance in the same individual (13) and from saliva alone in both patient (six) and control (ten) individuals. In eight of 34 patients, but in only one of 34 controls, more than one yeast species was present. The prevalence of oral colonization by Candida spp. is signi cantly higher amongst wearers of removable orthodontic appliances. Furthermore, the oral biology of yeasts is affected by URA wear so that colonization is more important, and by a wider variety of Candida species, and multispecies are seen.

40|$|Objectives: The {{purposes}} {{of the study were}} to assess the colonization of tracheoesophageal voice prostheses by albicans and non-albicans Candida species and to determine their susceptibility for three antimycotics that are frequently used for prophylaxis or treatment of oral candidiasis (i. e., miconazole, fluconazole, and nystatin). Study Design: In total, 101 patients, corresponding to 170 voice prostheses, were monitored over a period of 28 months. Methods. An enzymatic two-step method was used for differentiation and presumptive identification of Candida species colonizing the voice prostheses. The identity of the isolates was confirmed by the <b>germ-tube</b> <b>test,</b> morphological appearance on corn-meal agar with 0. 5 %, Tween 80, sugar assimilation tests, and appearance on CHROMagar Candida (CHROMagar Co., Paris), Albicans ID (BioMerieux Vitek, Hazelwood, MO), and Fluoroplate Candida (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). Susceptibility testing for miconazole, fluconazole, and nystatin was performed according to the microdilution method of the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards. Results: The predominant species isolated were Candida albicans (41. 4 %), Candida glabrata (33. 1 %), Candida krusei (15. 9 %), and Candida tropicalis (5. 3 %). A broad range of minimal inhibitory concentrations of the isolates was observed for miconazole and fluconazole. In contrast, minimal inhibitory concentration values for nystatin were narrowly distributed around 4 mug/mL for all isolates, suggesting uniform sensitivity. Conclusion: Our data on the prevalence and susceptibility of yeast isolates will contribute to a rational choice of an antimycotic for prophylaxis of the early deterioration and leakage of tracheoesophageal voice prostheses...|$|E
40|$|Aim: The aim of {{this study}} was to examine the {{presence}} of Candida albicans in extensive carious lesions before and after treatment of the carious lesions and to evaluate the carriage of Candida albicans in children with and without caries. Materials and methods: The study was conducted on 60 childrens who were divided into two groups: Experimental group (group 1) and controlled group (group 2). Each group was further divided into 3 subgroups according to the dentition as: Group A (Deciduous), group B (Mixed) and group C (Permanent). Swab samples for mycological studies were collected from the dorsum of the tongue, vestibular sulcus and peak of the palatal vault. All samples were cultured directly on SDA plate (Sabouraud’s dextrose agar). Number of Candida colonies was determined by counting colony forming unit on SDA plates. Further identification of Candida albicans was done by <b>germ-tube</b> <b>test</b> and corn-meal agar. Result: Overall prevalence of Candida albicans carriage was significantly higher and mean value of Candida albicans CFU (colony forming unit) was remarkably higher in group 1 (experimental group) as compare to group 2 (control group). Significant reduction in the frequency and mean value of Candida albicans CFU/plate was seen in children after treatment of carious lesions. Conclusion: This study supports the active role of Candida species in dental caries. Hence, Candida albicans may play an important role as a risk factor for dental caries. It was also seen that the oral environment stabilization procedures were able to reduce Candida albicans counts. Thus, these procedures can be considered efficient in the reduction of caries risk...|$|E
