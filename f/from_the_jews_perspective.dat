50|$|Reflections on <b>the</b> <b>Jews</b> in France <b>from</b> <b>The</b> <b>Jews</b> in Modern France {{edited by}} Frances Malino and Bernard Wasserstein, 1985.|$|R
50|$|There were {{a number}} of {{characteristics}} that made <b>the</b> <b>Jews</b> of Habban in modern times distinct <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Jews</b> of Northern Yemen.|$|R
60|$|He {{then turned}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Jew,</b> who {{followed}} him, however, {{as closely as}} his shadow.|$|R

50|$|The {{assassination}} of Abu Rafi did not relieve Muhammad of his apprehensions. Muhammad {{did not feel}} safe <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Jews</b> of Khaybar.|$|R
50|$|Under {{pressure}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Jews</b> of Kelm, Rabbi Ziv {{decided to}} open his school elsewhere: he re-established it in Grobin, in the Courland province.|$|R
6000|$|... 'It is the monk! {{the young}} man I told you of, who saved me <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Jews</b> <b>the</b> other night! What good angel sent him here that I might thank him?' cried the poor creature, while the tears ran down her black shining face.|$|R
6000|$|But though Trendellsohn did {{not come}} himself, there came to her a {{messenger}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Jew's</b> house--a messenger <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Jew's</b> house, but not a messenger from Anton Trendellsohn. [...] "Here is a girl from the-- Jew," [...] said Souchey, whispering into her ear as she sat at her father's bedside--"one of themselves. Shall I tell her to go away, because he is so ill?" [...] And Souchey pointed to his master's head on the pillow. [...] "She has got a basket, but she can leave that." ...|$|R
50|$|Perhaps, apart <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Jews,</b> no {{ethnic group}} would have endured {{the amount of}} neglect Anaku {{suffered}} throughout its political history, both during and post colonial eras.|$|R
6000|$|... "Back, dog!" [...] {{said the}} Grand Master; [...] "I touch not misbelievers, save with the sword.--Conrade, take thou <b>the</b> letter <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Jew,</b> {{and give it}} to me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Is it {{not said}} that this event was prophesied of old time?" [...] I queried, for I had been {{learning}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Jews</b> what I deemed their subtleties of thinking.|$|R
5000|$|... "The Jews built a synagogue, {{that is a}} room, {{a chamber}} {{that served as a}} synagogue. <b>The</b> {{offering}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Jews</b> of <b>the</b> Rhine province has supposedly reached a meager result." ...|$|R
25|$|In a {{relatively}} new movement, the Abayudaya of Uganda have converted to Judaism since 1917, influenced by the American William Saunders Crowdy, who said that African Americans were descended <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Jews.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Farewell, thou poor rag of the Muse! [...] In {{the bag of}} the clothesman go lie; [...] A farthing thou'lt fetch <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Jews,</b> [...] Which <b>the</b> hard-hearted Christians deny," [...] etc.|$|R
5000|$|In December, Karski {{described}} {{the conditions in}} the ghetto to Zygielbojm. Zygielbojm asked whether Karski had any messages <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Jews</b> in <b>the</b> ghetto. As Karski later wrote, he passed along Feiner's message: ...|$|R
25|$|Kurdish Jews from Kurdistan, as {{distinct}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Persian <b>Jews</b> {{of central and}} eastern Persia, as well as <b>from</b> <b>the</b> lowland Babylonian <b>Jews</b> of Mesopotamia.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Claypole {{no sooner}} heard this extract {{from his own}} remarks than he fell back in his chair, and looked <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Jew</b> to Charlotte with a countenance of ashy paleness and {{excessive}} terror.|$|R
25|$|The {{relationship}} between the Church and Judaism was far more tempestuous {{as can be seen}} within the Acts of the Apostles. Prior to the burning of Rome, their persecution was <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Jews.</b> <b>The</b> Christians were regarded by both the common people and the authorities as being separatists. The Christian lifestyle itself distanced it <b>from</b> that of <b>the</b> pagan world.|$|R
60|$|Accordingly, with a {{clean white}} apron tied over her gown, and her curl-papers tucked up under a straw bonnet,--both {{articles}} of dress being provided <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Jew's</b> inexhaustible stock,--Miss Nancy prepared to issue forth on her errand.|$|R
5000|$|The {{statement}} {{said they had}} been falsely and maliciously accused of receiving financial support <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Jews,</b> insisting: [...] "There has never been the slightest bit of money contributed to our work by the Jews." [...] It added: ...|$|R
500|$|Firstly, Hitler {{claims he}} took his doctrines <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Jews</b> and copied <b>the</b> notion of <b>the</b> master race <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Chosen people and their need to {{separate}} themselves <b>from</b> <b>the</b> [...] "unclean". [...] "My racism is a parody of yours, a hungry imitation." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I fancy we {{have had}} enough of Jerusalem," [...] she said, [...] "considering we are not descended <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Jews.</b> There was nothing first-rate about the place, or people, after all--as there was about Athens, Rome, Alexandria, and other old cities." ...|$|R
5000|$|Are there professions <b>from</b> which <b>the</b> <b>Jews</b> are {{excluded}} by their law? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Keep it! Not I. What wouldst say to thy dainty dame? Nor should I get {{half its}} value <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Jews.</b> No, no, take back thy jewel, Sir Page; I'll not put thee {{in need of}} telling more lies than becomes thine office." ...|$|R
25|$|During the Black Death (1349) <b>the</b> <b>Jews</b> of Frankfurt {{were again}} persecuted. At the {{beginning}} of these outbreaks the circumspect Emperor Charles IV, who feared for his income, pledged <b>the</b> <b>Jews</b> to <b>the</b> city for more than 15,000pounds of hellers, stipulating that he would redeem them, which he never did. The Flagellants, on coming to Frankfurt, destroyed nearly the entire Jewish community, with <b>the</b> <b>Jews</b> in their distress setting fire to their own houses. Their property was confiscated by the council by way of indemnity. Jews returned to Frankfurt very gradually. In 1354 Charles IV renewed his pledge to the city; three years later the Archbishop of Mainz again advanced his claims, but <b>the</b> <b>Jews</b> and <b>the</b> council came to an agreement with him in 1358. In 1367 the city was again in full possession of <b>the</b> income derived <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Jews,</b> but this did not prevent <b>the</b> emperor <b>from</b> occasionally levying extraordinary taxes; for example, Sigismund (1414) exacted a contribution <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Jews</b> toward <b>the</b> expenses of the Council of Constance.|$|R
5000|$|The {{removal of}} the Jewish {{population}} Tallinn has been swift and easy thanks to the action taken by a Sonderkommando on 29 and 30 August. There has been no noticeable resistance <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Jews</b> who {{were led to believe}} that they will be resettled.|$|R
50|$|Because of this action, Muhammad ended {{alliance}} with the Nadir tribe and that act of treachery <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Jews</b> meant that they were at war with one another. He then sent one of his companions (Muhammad bin Muslimah) to issue an ultimatum to <b>the</b> <b>Jews.</b> They were to leave Medina within a specified amount of time. When <b>the</b> <b>Jews</b> refused to leave {{at the behest of}} fake Muslims (The Hypocrites) Muhammad decided to take military action and besieged <b>the</b> <b>Jews</b> in their fortresses. After six nights of this, <b>the</b> <b>Jews</b> agreed to lay down arms and they were given safe passage out of Medina; they were also allowed to take all of their belongings with them except their military arms. <b>From</b> there <b>the</b> <b>Jews</b> settled in Khaybar and some in Syria.|$|R
5000|$|... "He {{expelled}} <b>from</b> Rome <b>the</b> <b>Jews</b> constantly making disturbances at the instigation of Chrestus" ...|$|R
5000|$|Jeremy Cohen writes:Yet {{the very}} impulse that {{propelled}} <b>the</b> Christian imagination <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Jew</b> as a deliberate killer of Christ to <b>the</b> <b>Jew</b> as perpetrator {{of the most}} heinous crimes against humanity also led to the portrayal of <b>the</b> <b>Jew</b> as inhuman, satanic, animal-like, and monstrous. ... Popular traditions of the later Middle Ages, for example, characterize Jews as having a distinctive foul odor. ... By all accounts, the bestiality of <b>the</b> <b>Jew</b> climaxed in <b>the</b> image of the Judensau...|$|R
25|$|Johann Reuchlin (1455–1522) was a German humanist and {{a scholar}} of Greek and Hebrew who opposed efforts by Johannes Pfefferkorn, backed by the Dominicans of Cologne, to {{confiscate}} all religious texts <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Jews</b> {{as a first step}} towards their forcible conversion to the Catholic religion.|$|R
50|$|As {{a reward}} for loyal his service, Emperor Louis IV made Henry IV parton of the Imperial City of Dortmund and {{supervisor}} of <b>the</b> <b>Jews</b> in <b>the</b> city. In 1337, he was also made supervisor of <b>the</b> <b>Jews</b> in <b>the</b> bishoprics of Münster and Osnabrück. He was tasked to collect imperial taxes <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Jews.</b> In 1332, <b>the</b> Lords of Grafschaft sold him a 50% share in Nordenau Castle. He later purchased another share.|$|R
2500|$|Syrian Jews ( [...] Yehudey Surya, [...] al-Yahūd as-Sūriyyūn, colloquially called SYs [...] in the United States) are Jews {{who lived}} in the region of the modern state of Syria, and their {{descendants}} born outside Syria. Syrian Jews derive their origin from two groups: <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Jews</b> who inhabited <b>the</b> region of today's Syria from ancient times (known as Musta'arabi Jews, and sometimes classified as Mizrahi Jews, a generic term for <b>the</b> <b>Jews</b> with an extended history in the Middle East or North Africa); and <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Sephardi <b>Jews</b> (referring to Jews with an extended history in the Iberian Peninsula, i.e. Spain and Portugal) who fled to Syria after the Alhambra Decree forced the expulsion of <b>the</b> <b>Jews</b> <b>from</b> Spain in 1492.|$|R
2500|$|..... {{from all}} parts of Germany, the baggage taken away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Jews</b> was sent to Theresienstadt, and there it was packaged, sorted-out in order to be sent out all over the country, to various cities, for the people who were bombed-out and {{suffered}} a shortage of underwear and clothing.|$|R
50|$|In Venice he {{reported}} to Clement VII, claiming {{to represent a}} mission <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Jews</b> of <b>the</b> east. He attracted funding from a Jewish painter named Mose, and Felice, a Jewish merchant for travel to Rome. The same month Reubeni entered the city while riding a white horse.|$|R
50|$|The {{officers}} of the 3rd brigade were transferred to other positions, and the brigade left the town with its carriages filled with loot. Among the pillaged goods were cans of paint, which were not properly sealed, and the convoy's trail was marked with paint stolen <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Jews.</b>|$|R
60|$|Meanwhile the Abbot and Cedric {{continued}} their discourse upon hunting; the Lady Rowena seemed engaged {{in conversation with}} one of her attendant females; and the haughty Templar, whose eye wandered <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Jew</b> to <b>the</b> Saxon beauty, revolved in his mind thoughts which appeared deeply to interest him.|$|R
