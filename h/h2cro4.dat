5000|$|... {{chromium}} trioxide is the anhydride of chromic acid: <b>H2CrO4</b> - H2O = CrO3 ...|$|E
5000|$|The species <b>H2CrO4</b> and [...] are {{not shown}} {{as they are}} formed only at very low pH.|$|E
50|$|Molecular chromic acid, <b>H2CrO4,</b> {{has much}} in common with sulfuric acid, H2SO4. Both are {{classified}} as strong acids, though only the first proton is lost easily.|$|E
50|$|The {{solution}} {{needs to}} be near neutral, because silver hydroxide forms at high pH, while the chromate forms <b>H2CrO4</b> at low pH, reducing the concentration of chromate ions, and delaying {{the formation of the}} precipitate. Carbonates and phosphates precipitate with silver, and need to be absent to prevent inaccurate results.|$|E
50|$|Vanadic acid H3VO4 shows {{similarities}} with {{phosphoric acid}} H3PO4 {{though it has}} a much more complex vanadate oxoanion chemistry. Chromic acid <b>H2CrO4,</b> has similarities with sulfuric acid H2SO4; for example, both form acid salts A+HMO4âˆ’. Some metals, e.g. V, Cr, Nb, Ta, Mo, W, tend to exist in high oxidation states. Rather than forming hydroxides in aqueous solution, they convert to oxo clusters {{by the process of}} olation, forming polyoxometalates.|$|E
50|$|There {{are both}} organic (which are called dicarboxylic acids) and {{inorganic}} diprotic acids. Chromic acid (<b>H2CrO4)</b> and sulfuric acid (H2SO4) {{are two of}} the common and widely used inorganic acids. They have similar structures within each molecular has two -OH groups linked to its center atom. Some other inorganic diprotic acids such as hydrosulfuric acid (H2S) usually have two hydrogen atoms linked to an electronegative center in each molecular. Dicarboxylic acids have a general molecular formula HOOC-R-COOH.|$|E
50|$|The term {{chromic acid}} is usually {{used for a}} mixture made by adding {{concentrated}} sulfuric acid to a dichromate, which may contain a variety of compounds, including solid chromium trioxide. This kind of chromic acid {{may be used as}} a cleaning mixture for glass. Chromic acid may also refer to the molecular species, <b>H2CrO4</b> of which the trioxide is the anhydride. Chromic acid features chromium in an oxidation state of +6 (or VI). It is a strong and corrosive oxidising agent.|$|E
50|$|The {{so-called}} Jones reagent {{is prepared}} by dissolving chromium trioxide (CrO3) in aqueous sulfuric acid, {{which results in}} formation of a reddish solution containing chromic acid (<b>H2CrO4)</b> and oligomers thereof. Addition of Jones reagent to a solution of a primary alcohol in acetone (as first described by Jones) results in oxidation of the alcohol to a carboxylic acid. This classical protocol, involving a direct addition, is used very often regardless {{of the fact that}} it frequently leads to the formation of substantial amounts of esters (possessing the structure R-CO-O-CH2-R) derived from oxidative dimerization of primary alcohols. Holland and Gilman proved that this side reaction can be greatly suppressed by following the inverse addition protocol whereby a solution of the primary alcohol in acetone is slowly added to Jones reagent under conditions as dilute as practical.|$|E
5000|$|A {{predominance}} diagram {{purports to}} show the conditions of concentration and pH where a chemical species has the highest concentration in solutions {{in which there are}} multiple acid-base equilibria. The lines on a predominance diagram indicate where adjacent species have the same concentration. Either side of such a line one species or the other predominates, that is, has higher concentration relative to the other species.To illustrate a predominance diagram, part of the one for chromate is shown at the right. pCr stands for minus the logarithm of the chromium concentration and pH stands for minus the logarithm of the hydrogen ion concentration. There are two independent equilibria, with equilibrium constants defined as follows.A third equilibrium constant can be derived from K1 and KD.The species <b>H2CrO4</b> and [...] are only formed at very low pH so they do not appear on this diagram. Published values for log K1 and log KD are 5.89 and 2.05, respectively. Using these values and the equality conditions, the concentrations of the three species, chromate , hydrogen chromate [...] and dichromate [...] can be calculated, for various values of pH, by means of the equilibrium expressions. The chromium concentration is calculated as the sum of the species' concentrations in terms of chromium content.|$|E
