40|$|Graduation date: 1992 Schwartz and Bilsky (1987, 1990) {{constructed}} a universal psychological structure for cross-cultural studies of motivational dynamics. To test this structure, Simmons (1991) adapted {{data from a}} twenty year broad-based value survey of student cohorts at an American university. The availability of reliable, long-term data on American students permitted a comparison with responses of contemporary Chinese college students to a standardized personal value questionnaire. Ratings and priorities assigned by the Chinese and American students differed significantly. Chinese students emphasized Achievement, Maturity, and Prosocial motivational domains. American students emphasized Self-Direction, Security, and Enjoyment. Tradition, Power, and Stimulation were listed as least important for both groups. The effects of traditional Chinese religious and philosophical teachings on the stability of community norms were noted, as was some <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>priority</b> shifts in the values for Chinese youth, suggesting changes in response to altered political and economic expectations in China...|$|E
40|$|Symptomatological {{prediction}} of Intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) mortality {{is a simple}} and effective method compared to pathological predictors. In this study we considered consciousness level as an easily measurable predictor and compared it to haemorrhage location, intraventricular penetration and haemorrhage size derived from Computerized Tomography (CT) to predict mortality using a parametric survival analysis model. Two hundred and thirty eight ICH patients from a neurology hospital ward were enrolled into this comparative study. Patient history was documented with respect to mortality and a questionnaire outlining background variables and medical history was completed for them. Consciousness level was clinically evaluated by a physician while haemorrhage size and location were determined via computerized tomographic scanning reports. Data were entered into the computer and analyzed according to the Weibull parametric survival analysis model using STATA 8 statistical software. Males constituted 47. 1 % of the 238 patients, 52. 9 % were females. The age range of the patients varied from 13 to 88 years, {{with a mean age}} of 62. 4 ± 13. 6 (Mean±SD). Half of the patients survived more than 20 days. Using the Weibull regression model, the only significant independent symptomatological predictor of mortality was found to be the level of consciousness. Cumulative hazard during the 90 days was compared for different levels of consciousness. Application of Weibull to pathological predictors of ICH mortality showed that the two independent predictors were haemorrhage size and intraventricular penetration. Results of statistical modelling didn’t provide <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>priority</b> for pathological predictors of survival compared to easily measurable levels of consciousness as a symptomatological predictor. Easily measurable symptoms of level of consciousness can be used as a survival predictor of stroke due to intra-cerebral haemorrhage when compared to pathological indicators...|$|E

We propose a continuous fingerprint indexing method based on location, direction estimation and correlation of fingerprint singular points. Location and direction estimation are achieved simultaneously by applying a T-shape model to directional field of fingerprint images. The T-shape model analyzes homocentric sectors around the candidate singular points to find lateral-axes and further main-axes. Then a distortion-tolerant filter of Minimum Average Correlation Energy is utilized to obtain a correlation-based similarity measure which gives the <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> searching <b>priority.</b> The experiment is performed by 400 -fingerprint retrieval from 10, 000 templates and the mean search space is only 3. 46 % of the whole dataset.

30|$|Example 7 is an {{official}} {{interpretation of the}} slogan “scientification of Chinese medicine.” Nonetheless, although “scientification” is used instead of “westernization” in the first sentence, the elementary knowledge such as anatomy mentioned here {{is closely related to}} Western medicine. Those learning this knowledge could be presumed to be Chinese doctors. As can be seen, the second meaning is closer to the real sense of the transformation of traditional Chinese medicine. However, the agency belongs not only to Chinese doctors, as seen in the action “to cooperate with scientists.” Two of the most basic definitions of “cooperate” are “act jointly” and “assist someone or comply with their requests.” I assume that the second definition describes the current scenario more precisely. Further <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> the <b>priority</b> <b>of</b> scientists over Chinese doctors is a series of verbs describing the task—“investigate,” “analyze,” “identify,” “study,” and “explore,” which describe regular work for scientists and not Chinese doctors. In addition, the first and second meanings emphasize two different aspects of the medical issue—the first relates to learning advanced and new knowledge, and the second relates to utilizing prior experiences. It can be inferred that the former is placed in a more-hegemonic position than the latter.|$|R

40|$|During {{the last}} two decades the Public Sector in Australia has come under {{increasing}} pressure to improve performance and demonstrate greater transparency. In addressing these pressures, departments have undertaken innovative adaptations of managerial and administrative practices to better suit the demands of the public sector environment. A major area of concern has been in regard to issues of accountability brought about by increases in both devolution and contracting out. Traditional adversarial contracts have posed budgetary, quality and completion dilemmas in major civil engineering projects in both the private and public sectors. This paper examines the adoption of relational style contracts as well as devolution of managerial responsibility in the Department of Main Roads in Queensland. The paper addresses whether contracts that focus on establishing relational interactions rather than protecting differing interests have better outcomes for public and parliamentary accountability or whether they merely act as further <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> the different <b>priorities</b> <b>of</b> the public and private sectors. ...|$|R

Further <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> this <b>priority</b> is the efforts of WL made in Beijing and Shanghai where there is a priority to build a better relationship with government. He lobbied his business idea to the government. Entrepreneurs in all the interviews indicated they considered it was of key importance for their businesses to be confident of the local government as local governments give them an edge in providing sound advice and easy access to markets. Most entrepreneurs indicated this strategy was played mostly “at a dinner” or “playing golf with government officials”.|$|R
40|$|Previous {{research}} has identified key barriers to obesity-related policy implementation internationally and in Australia. Food industry stakeholders emphasise the lack <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> and propose ethical concerns of a ‘nanny state’ around population-wide policies to regulate obesogenic environments, undermining public and {{political support for}} government intervention. Policy framing, and public and political support are essential for successful policy adoption, and collaborative research is essential to strengthen pathways to action. This thesis describes {{a body of research}} that is concerned with how governments can influence choice through obesity-related policy, with a specific focus on the concepts of policy intrusiveness and impact to autonomy. The findings emphasise the value of bringing forward under-represented views, to rebalance debate, and suggest that this may be the key to bolder obesity-related policies. There is scope to apply the methods in other national contexts and towards other complex public health issues where decision making is hampered by a lack <b>of</b> <b>evidence.</b> The <b>priorities</b> <b>of</b> dominant perspectives may deviate from other stakeholder groups, and where commercial and academic conflicts of interest are excluded from debate, there is high-level consensus around effectiveness and two ethical considerations to obesity policy adoption. Finally, reframing policy options through their impact on individual autonomy may strengthen societal support for bolder action. Despite currently limited empirical evidence for the effectiveness of population-wide policy to address obesity, governments should be confident in implementing those which are perceived to simultaneously enhance individual autonomy and the population’s health. According to this research, this comprises the majority of obesity-related food policy options available to the Australian Government...|$|R
30|$|Notice that, {{despite a}} {{significant}} increase in educational attainment in developed countries, recent evidence suggest that an increasing proportion of the population of these countries show apathy toward political affairs, observed in the diminishing voter turnout, in membership in political parties, civic associations or in the involvement in social affairs. In part, these evidence has triggered, since the early 2000, the interest of policy-makers and democracy advocates in most developed countries in order to search ways to enhance democratic attitudes and civic habits. One of the main channels chosen to achieve these targets is through formal schooling, by introducing citizenship education in the compulsory school curricula, e.g., Portugal or UK curricula reorganization in 2001 or 2002, respectively, with the introduction of citizenship education issues (Ribeiro et al. 2012). Among others, the European Commission has launched the program “Citizens for Europe” to promote civic participation and a stronger sense of citizenship by motivating changes in the high school curricula of its country members (Eurodyce 2005), e.g., Kerr et al. (2010) presents <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> the <b>priority</b> assigned to these issues by EU country. In the United States, there is a debate at state levels of how to adequately implement citizenship educational policies in schools given the downward trend in voter turnout or membership in political or civic associations (Educational Commission USA 2004). In Canada the discussion is on the type of education that is necessary to uphold a diverse and democratic country (Hebert and Sears 2000).|$|R

Primary care is an area of practice that offers a promising option for interprofessional student learning. In this study, we investigated what and how students from differing professions learn together. Our findings inform the design of future interprofessional education initiatives. Using activity theory, we conducted an ethnographic investigation of interprofessional education in primary care. During a 5 months period, we observed 14 clinic sessions involving mixed discipline student teams who interviewed people with chronic disease. Teams were comprised of senior medicine, nursing, occupational therapy, pharmacy and physiotherapy entry level students. Semi-structured interviews were also conducted with seven clinical educators. Data were analysed to ascertain the objectives, tools, rules and division of labour. Two integrated activity systems were identified: (1) student teams gathering information to determine patients' health care needs and (2) patients either as health consumers or student educators. Unwritten rules regarding 'shared contribution', 'patient as key information source' and 'time constraints' were identified. Both the significance of software literacy on team leadership, and a pre-determined structure of enquiry, highlighted the importance of careful consideration of the tools used in interprofessional education, and the way they can influence practice.

Between 1912 and 1917 Katharine designed and built Reynolda, a large country bungalow on a 1, 067 acre estate that would be her family???s home and {{the base of her}} many enterprises. At Reynolda, Katharine used two spaces ??? Katharine???s Den and Dick???s Den ??? as a form of home office. Katharine decorated her Den in historic styles of French influence that utilize tapered legs, lively veneer, and gilding to create a sophisticated, tasteful room. For Dick???s Den, she drew on the English tradition for its furniture and embellished it with items of Asian influence. In addition to fine decoration, each Den had technology for business communication and was arranged for sociability and efficiency. Dick passed away before being able to use his Den as intended. Instead, Katharine and her staff used both Dens to handle family business, run the estate, and fulfill Katharine???s many obligations to charities and causes throughout North Carolina.

This study describes an attempt to directly introduce evidence on the effectiveness of interventions into the annual <b>priority</b> setting process <b>of</b> a District Health Authority (DHA). Methods Literature searches were undertaken on proposals for Health Authority funding. The identified literature was then critically appraised, and relevant information was used by members of the Department of Public Health to score the individual bids in terms of health gain. These scores were then fed into the priority setting process. Results A total of 144 proposals for funding were submitted. For 6. 2 per cent of proposals there was strong evidence to support the intervention, for 21. 2 per cent there was fair evidence in support, and for 38. 1 per cent there was poor evidence. A search was not possible for 16. 8 per cent of the proposals. There was a moderate correlation between the strength <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> for the effectiveness of the proposal and initial scoring of the proposal for health gain (r = 0. 41, p < 0. 001). At the end <b>of</b> the <b>priority</b> setting process there was no correlation between strength <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> and <b>priority</b> ranking (r = 0. 01, p = 0. 97).
