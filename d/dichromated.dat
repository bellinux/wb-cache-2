The holographic gratings can have up to 6000 lines/mm and can be up to twice as efficient in collecting light as blazed gratings. Because they are sealed between two sheets of glass, the holographic gratings are very versatile, potentially lasting decades before needing replacement.|$|E

50|$|A {{holographic}} optical element (HOE) is {{an optical}} element (such as a lens, filter, beam splitter, or diffraction grating) that is produced using holographic imaging processes or principles. <b>Dichromated</b> gelatin and photoresists are among the holographic recording materials used in forming {{holographic optical element}}s.|$|E

50|$|Photographic {{emulsion}} {{is not a}} true emulsion, but {{a suspension}} of solid particles (silver halide) in a fluid (gelatin in solution). However, the word emulsion is customarily used in a photographic context. Gelatin or gum arabic layers sensitized with dichromate used in the <b>dichromated</b> colloid processes carbon and gum bichromate are sometimes called emulsions.

The application of <b>dichromates</b> in traditional medications is briefly discussed; this is a toxin which may be more prevalent than previously thought.

50|$|In 2006, a {{large number}} of surplus holography-quality green lasers (Coherent C315) became {{available}} and put <b>dichromated</b> gelatin (DCG) holography within the reach of the amateur holographer. The holography community was surprised at the amazing sensitivity of DCG to green light. It had been assumed that this sensitivity would be uselessly slight or non-existent. Jeff Blyth responded with the G307 formulation of DCG to increase the speed and sensitivity to these new lasers.|$|E
50|$|The {{collotype}} {{plate is}} made by coating a plate of glass or metal with a substrate composed of gelatin or other colloid and hardening it. Then it is coated with a thick coat of <b>dichromated</b> gelatin and dried carefully at a controlled temperature (a little over 50 degrees Celsius) so it 'reticulates' or breaks up into a finely grained pattern when washed later in approximately 16 °C water. The plate is then exposed {{in contact with the}} negative using an ultraviolet (UV) source which changes the ability of the exposed gelatin to absorb water later. The plate is developed by carefully washing out the dichromate salt and dried without heat. The plate is left in a cool dry place to cure for 24 hours before using it to print.|$|E
50|$|To make an oil print, a {{piece of}} paper is coated with a thick gelatin layer {{containing}} dichromate salts that sensitize it to light. A contact print is made by laying a negative over the paper and exposing it to light, which leads to hardening of the <b>dichromated</b> gelatin in proportion to the amount of light that reaches the paper. After exposure, the print is soaked in water and the non-hardened areas absorb more water than the hardened parts. The sponge-dried but still moist paper is then inked with an oil-based ink, which sticks preferentially to the hardened (drier) areas. The result is a positive image in the color of the ink. As with other forms of printmaking, the ink application requires considerable skill, and no two prints are identical.|$|E
50|$|Sodium <b>dichromate</b> is the {{inorganic}} compound with the formula Na2Cr2O7. Usually, however, the salt is handled as its dihydrate Na2Cr2O7·2H2O. Virtually all chromium ore is processed via conversion to sodium <b>dichromate</b> {{and virtually all}} compounds and materials based on chromium are prepared from this salt. In terms of reactivity and appearance, sodium <b>dichromate</b> and potassium <b>dichromate</b> are very similar. The sodium salt is, however, around twenty times more soluble in water than the potassium salt (49 g/L at 0 °C) and its equivalent weight is also lower, which is often desirable.|$|R
25|$|In 1839, Mungo Ponton {{discovered}} that paper {{treated with a}} solution of potassium <b>dichromate</b> was visibly tanned by exposure to sunlight, the discoloration remaining after the potassium <b>dichromate</b> had been rinsed out. In 1852, Henry Fox Talbot {{discovered that}} exposure to ultraviolet light {{in the presence of}} potassium <b>dichromate</b> hardened organic colloids such as gelatin and gum arabic, making them less soluble.|$|R
50|$|The net {{reaction}} {{is that the}} <b>dichromate</b> oxidizes the iron. This favorable reaction drives the mercury oxidations/reductions and the oscillations in shape. When the <b>dichromate</b> is all reduced, the reaction stops.|$|R

50|$|Like many {{practical}} inventions, the Woodburytype {{process was}} built on, or had features in common with, other inventions and discoveries. It utilized the photosensitivity of <b>dichromated</b> gelatin, discovered in 1852 by Henry Fox Talbot, who was thereby building on Mungo Ponton's 1839 contribution of potassium dichromate {{to the list}} of known sensitizing agents for making photographs on paper. The photochemical formation of the gelatin relief dates back to the first carbon printing patent of Alphonse Poitevin (1855). The idea of washing unhardened gelatin from the lower part of an exposed gelatin layer {{can be found in the}} early experiments of Adolphe Fargier (1861) and in the development of Joseph Swan’s fully practical carbon-transfer process (1864). Alois Auer, in his 1853 book on nature printing, describes making printing plates by forcibly impressing soft low-relief objects, such as leaves, into sheets of lead. The ancient Egyptians made molds and used them to mass-produce small ceramic goods.|$|E
