500|$|Within a few weeks, Hall {{was making}} {{preparations}} for a sledging trip {{with the aim}} of beating Sir William Parry's furthest north record. Mistrust amongst the men in charge showed again when Hall told Tyson that [...] "I cannot trust that man (Captain Budington). <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> with me, but don't know how to leave him alone with the ship." [...] There is some evidence that Budington may have been an alcoholic; on at least three occasions he raided the ship's stores, including the alcohol kept by the scientists for preservation of specimens. Hall had complained about Budington's drunken behavior, and it fully came to light from the crew's testimony at the inquest following the expedition. With Tyson watching over the ship, Hall took two sledges with first mate Chester, and the native guides Ebierbing and Hendrik, leaving on Oct 10, 1871. The day after leaving, Hall sent Hendrik back to the ship to retrieve a number of forgotten items. Hall also sent back a note to Bessels, reminding him to wind the chronometers at the right time every day. In his book Trial by Ice, Richard Parry postulated that such a note from the uneducated Hall must have rankled Bessels, who held a number of degrees from Stuttgart, Heidelberg, and Jena. It was another example of Hall's micromanagement of the expedition. Before he left on the overland trip, Hall gave Budington a detailed list of instructions regarding how to manage the ship in his absence. This likely did not sit well with a sailing master with over 20years of experience.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} hours of the {{following}} morning, as his son was about to leave for work, Fred informed him: [...] "Look son, look after mum and sell the house [...] I've done something really bad. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to the papers and make as much money as you can." [...] Shortly thereafter, police returned to Cromwell Street to continue their search for Heather's body. Upon their arrival, Fred indicated his wish to be arrested for Heather's murder and to be taken to Bearland police station to provide a full confession; he was then arrested and formally cautioned.|$|E
2500|$|In Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States (1935), the Court also voted {{unanimously}} to declare the National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA) unconstitutional {{on the grounds that}} it gave the president [...] "unfettered discretion" [...] to make whatever laws he thought were needed for economic recovery. Economics author John Steele Gordon writes that the National Recovery Administration (NRA) was [...] "the first iteration of Roosevelt's New Deal ... essentially a government-run cartel to fix prices and divide markets ... This was the most radical shift in the relation between government and the private economy in American history." [...] Speaking to aides of Roosevelt, Justice Louis Brandeis remarked that, [...] "This is the end of this business of centralization, and <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> back and tell the president that we're not going to let this government centralize everything." ...|$|E

2500|$|Lamon's {{professional}} association with Lincoln started in 1852. Lamon became the prosecuting {{attorney for the}} Old Eighth Judicial district and subsequently moved to Bloomington, Illinois, in 1858. [...] While Lamon had Southern sympathies and his hatred of abolitionism set him apart from Lincoln, they remained friends, despite their very different characters. Lamon joined the then-young Republican Party and campaigned for Lincoln in 1860. [...] Lincoln was up against New York Senator William Seward for the Republican nomination, and Lamon proved his friendship by printing up extra tickets for the convention to fill the hall with Lincoln supporters. [...] When Lincoln was elected President, Lamon hoped for a foreign diplomatic post, but {{received a letter from}} his friend that said, [...] "Dear Hill, I need you. [...] <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to Washington with me and be prepared for a long stay." [...] Lamon then accompanied him as he traveled from Springfield, Illinois, to Washington D.C. in February 1861. [...] This trip would prove to be eventful.|$|E
2500|$|On November 19, 1823, at age 25, Smith died {{of mercury}} {{poisoning}} from calomel, {{which had been}} administered to cure a case of “bilious colic.” Smith was a believer in his brother Joseph's claim that Joseph was to recover an ancient record from a nearby hill. His death occurred two months after Joseph’s {{first visit to the}} hill from which he was eventually said to have recovered the golden plates that would later be claimed as the source for the Book of Mormon. According to a history written by his mother, Lucy Mack Smith, as Smith lay dying he called each member of his family to his bedside to give them counsel. To his brother Hyrum, Smith said, [...] "I have done all I could to make our dear parents comfortable. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> on and finish the house." [...] He urged his brother Joseph to fulfill all of the requirements to obtain the record. Smith's death had a significant effect on the family, resulting in Joseph taking more of a leadership role.|$|E

[...] He invited me in, remarking, ‘Sit down, Standing Bear. [...] I have sent for you because I want you to tell you {{something}} of importance. [...] The Big Chief of this country, the King of England, has promised to attend a performance of our show. [...] Now <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> back to your people, call them all together, and tell them all about it. [...] Tell them {{to be very careful about}} their clothes; to see that they are perfectly clean and neat for that particular performance. [...] If anything needs repairs, tell them to attend to it at once. [...] We must please the King at this performance. [...] Rehearse your Indians well so they will do their best for me. [...] If the King likes our show, it will please the people of this country. [...] I have observed your own costume. [...] It is very fine, and when the King attends the show, I want you to do an Indian dance in front of his box. [...] Will you do this for me?” [...] “Everything worked splendidly. [...] When it came time for the Indians to come in with their village in the center of the arena, we started the dance in which I was to appear before the King of England. [...] I had a beautiful lance, and as the dance proceeded I worked over toward the King’s box. [...] There I shook the lance in his face and danced my very prettiest, you may be sure. [...] The King had been very dignified thus far, and had not even smiled. [...] But when I got down to doing my fancy steps and gave a few Sioux yells, he had to smile in spite of himself. [...] I saw that I had made a hit with him and was very happy. After the show, Buffalo Bill brought the King and his party around the inside of the arena. [...] In front of him walked a big man who seemed to keep his eyes roving about all the while. [...] I think he must have been the King’s personal bodyguard. [...] Buffalo Bill brought the King over to me and we were introduced. [...] We shook hands, although neither of us said a word. [...] But I had the honor of being introduced to King Edward VII, the monarch of Great Britain.” ...|$|E
