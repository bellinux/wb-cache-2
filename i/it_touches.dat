The octopus's suction cups are equipped with chemoreceptors so the octopus can taste what <b>it</b> <b>touches.</b> Octopus arms do not become tangled or stuck to each other because the sensors recognise octopus skin and prevent self-attachment.|$|E
5|$|Phaeacius {{does not}} try to eat other spiders' eggs, does not enter webs voluntarily, and moves away if <b>it</b> <b>touches</b> one accidentally. It can bite through the threads and pull {{strongly}} with its legs, but cannot escape from very sticky webs. This behaviour {{is quite different from}} that of its close relative, Portia, which hunts actively and can enter any type of web to catch spiders and their eggs.|$|E
5|$|The {{setting and}} events of Strange Journey are {{unrelated}} {{to any other}} entry in the Shin Megami Tensei series. The game {{is set in the}} early 21st century on the continent of Antarctica. During the game's opening, a massive atomic collapse occurs at the South Pole, causing the creation of the , a black void which swallows anything <b>it</b> <b>touches</b> and threatens to engulf the Earth. The space within the Schwarzwelt is occupied by spaces representing the many vices of humanity, acting as a critique of them. The main bases are special amphibious vehicles: Red Sprite No. 1, the protagonist's vehicle, Blue Jet No. 2, Elves No. 3, and Gigantic No. 4.|$|E

5|$|While most jumping spiders {{are active}} hunters, Phaeacius is unusually sedentary, {{generally}} resting in its unusual flattened pose for hours or days on logs, tree barks, {{pieces of wood}} or any other solid surface, where it is very well camouflaged. Its preferred prey is moths and other insects, and jumping spiders. Insects can usually move around an inactive Phaeacius, or even over its body, but if the insect moves between the spider's first pair of legs, Phaeacius lunges extremely quickly to bite the prey. Sometimes Phaeacius takes a more active approach, especially if without prey {{for a week or}} more. Phaeacius does not enter webs voluntary, and moves away if <b>it</b> <b>touches</b> one accidentally. It can bite through the threads and pull strongly with its legs, but cannot escape from very sticky webs.|$|E
25|$|Perhaps one effect {{underlying}} {{this common}} misconception {{is the fact}} that the color restriction is not transitive: a region only has to be colored differently from regions <b>it</b> <b>touches</b> directly, not regions touching regions that <b>it</b> <b>touches.</b> If this were the restriction, planar graphs would require arbitrarily large numbers of colors.|$|E

25|$|Variations in {{published}} cricket statistics {{have come}} about {{because there is}} no official view of the status of cricket matches played in Great Britain before 1895 or {{in the rest of the}} world before 1947. As a result, historians and statisticians have compiled differing lists of matches that they recognise as unofficially first-class (i.e., as important matches). The problem is significant where <b>it</b> <b>touches</b> on some of the sport's first-class records and especially the playing career of W. G. Grace.|$|E
25|$|Carbon dioxide {{is removed}} from the {{atmosphere}} primarily through photosynthesis and enters the terrestrial and oceanic biospheres. Carbon dioxide also dissolves directly from the atmosphere into bodies of water (oceans, lakes, etc.), as well as dissolving in precipitation as raindrops fall through the atmosphere. When dissolved in water, carbon dioxide reacts with water molecules and forms carbonic acid, which contributes to ocean acidity. It can then be absorbed by rocks through weathering. It also can acidify other surfaces <b>it</b> <b>touches</b> or be washed into the ocean.|$|E

In 2006 a judge ruled that Article 121 limited the federal courts from ruling on matters ruled on by the Syariah court when <b>it</b> <b>touches</b> Islamic matters. This was seen as a misinterpretation of the article by some, and the case is under appeal in the court of appeals.|$|E
25|$|During {{a fierce}} battle {{in which the}} Great Goddess {{demonstrates}} her omnipotence by defeating powerful demons who terrify the devas, she encounters the fierce Raktabija (chapter 8). Every drop of blood Raktabija sheds transforms into another demon as <b>it</b> <b>touches</b> the earth. A unique strategy has to be devised to vanquish him. A fiery burst of energy emerging from Devi's third eye takes the dark skeletal form of goddess Kali. With her huge mouth and enormous tongue she ferociously laps up Raktabija's blood, thus preventing the uprising of further demons.|$|E
25|$|Where {{the flow}} over the suction {{side of a}} {{transonic}} wing is accelerated to a supersonic speed, the resulting re-compression can be by either Prandtl-Meyer compression or by {{the formation of a}} normal shock. This shock is of particular interest to makers of transonic devices because it can cause separation of the boundary layer at the point where <b>it</b> <b>touches</b> the transonic profile. This can then lead to full separation and stall on the profile, higher drag, or shock-buffet, a condition where the separation and the shock interact in a resonance condition, causing resonating loads on the underlying structure.|$|E
