40|$|The {{condensation}} {{process in}} supersaturated vapors is analyzed {{with the help}} of thermodynamics and kinetic theory. The simplifying approximations which make the problem tractable are carefully examined. Results are obtained for the steady rate of condensation which constitute a theoretical improvement over Becker and Doring's values. The uncertainties in the values of the free energy for very small droplets, which are only partially removed by Tolman's theory on the variation of surface tension with curvature, limit this improvement in the condensation theory. Nonsteady condensation situations are also treated in detail by means of numerical and <b>graphical</b> <b>integrations.</b> It is found that the condensation in such situations generally approaches a steady rate in time periods of the order of 1 to 100 microseconds. Such time periods are negligible in many physical situations, but may be significant in the case of condensation shocks in wind tunnels. A similar analysis is carried out for the boiling of superheated liquids and the rupture of liquids under tension. Approximations reduce the analysis of these processes to mathematical relations very similar to those for the condensation process. Nonsteady solutions are obtained by numerical integration.

40|$|After early {{attempts}} {{to describe the}} behavior of beams under load, equations of equilibrium were first formulated correctly in 1827.

40|$|Useful {{forecasts}} may {{be obtained}} by <b>graphical</b> <b>integrations</b> of the dynamical prediction equations for a barotropic and a two-level baroclinic atmosphere. Such forecasts may be prepared {{without the aid of}} special equipment and are therefore particularly valuable as a means of training forecasters in physical prognosis. The present paper reviews the physical principles, modeling assumptions, and methods of solution used in graphical prediction and introduces a method of obtaining surface forecasts which is considerably faster and simpler than previous methods. The predicted surface pressure is shown to be the sum of two components: (1) the pressure advected to the spot by one-half the 500 -mb. wind and (2) a pressure change reflected down from aloft (actually one-half the 500 -mb. height change expressed in equivalent pressure units at 1000 mb.). The movement of surface pressure systems is thus seen to be largely dependent on upper-level steering, while the deepening is found {{to be related to the}} vorticity advection at high levels, since t. his mainly determines the 500 -mb. height changes. Twenty sample surface forecasts prepared by the graphical method during July 1959 are presented and compared with the forecasts for the same dates issued by the National Weather Analysis Center. Little difference in accuracy is apparent. Typical shortcomings and failures of the graphical prognoses are discussed. It is believed that the most serious errors are due to the use of only the init’ial 500 -mbxharts in advect. ing the pressure systems. If the 500 -mb. forecasts had been available earlier, it appears that a significant increase in accuracy could have been achieved by using both initial and forecast 500 -mb. contours in performing the advections. 1...|$|R
