5|$|As Stone & Webster {{began work}} on the {{production}} facilities, {{it became clear that}} building the township as well would be beyond its capacity. The Army therefore engaged the architectural and engineering firm Skidmore, Owings & Merrill to design and build the township. The John B. Pierce Foundation were brought in as a consultant. In turn, Skidmore, Owings & Merrill brought in numerous subcontractors. This first phase of construction became known as the East Town. It included some 3,000 family dwellings, an administrative center, three shopping centers, three grade schools for 500 children each and a high school for 500, recreation buildings, men's and women's dormitories, cafeterias, a medical services building and a 50-bed hospital. The emphasis was on speed of construction and getting around wartime shortages of materials. Where possible, <b>fiberboard</b> and gypsum board were used instead of wood, and foundations were made from concrete blocks rather than poured concrete. The work was completed in early 1944.|$|E

30|$|In this report, we {{discussed}} the reinforcement effect of LCNF in <b>fiberboards,</b> especially in relation to board density. Wet ball milling of both softwood and hardwood fibers resulted {{in the formation of}} nanostructured fibers with nanosized surface fibrils. A reliable and safe method presented in our previous report of manufacturing wood flour/LCNF boards could be applied to <b>fiberboards.</b> Physical and mechanical properties of the resulting <b>fiberboards</b> were significantly improved with the addition of LCNF, especially softwood <b>fiberboards,</b> due to close binding between LCNF and wood fibers. Moreover, the reinforcement effect of LCNF on <b>fiberboards</b> was confirmed at three different board densities. As the next steps, we would evaluate the reinforcement effect of LCNF on <b>fiberboards</b> in relation to LCNF size and LCNF/wood fiber composition.|$|R
40|$|A {{study was}} carried out to test sisal (Agave sisalana Perrine) <b>fiberboards</b> {{properties}} as building materials against Asian subterranean termite, Coptotermes gestroi (Wasmann). Evaluation was in the laboratory according to the JWPA Standard-TW-S. 1 - 1992. To improve mechanical properties of <b>fiberboards</b> made from sisal fibers, the boards were overlaid by rubber veneer, betung bamboo matting or formica. Result showed that the formica-overlaid sisal <b>fiberboards</b> performed better than other overlaid <b>fiberboards</b> against C. gestroi...|$|R
30|$|Low-density <b>fiberboards</b> with densities {{ranging from}} 0.05 to 0.50 g/cm 3 were {{manufactured}} with steam injection pressing. Bond-type and foam-type isocyanate compound resin adhesives were used separately at 10 % and 30 % resin content levels. Two types of different-size fibers from softwood were used. Mechanical, dimensional, thermal, and sound insulation {{properties of the}} <b>fiberboards</b> were tested. The results are as follows: (1) Bond-type isocyanate adhesive showed higher mechanical and dimensional properties of low-density <b>fiberboards</b> than the foam-type adhesive. (2) <b>Fiberboards</b> produced from small fibers have better mechanical and dimensional properties than those made from large fibers. (3) Thermal conductivity of <b>fiberboards</b> depends more on the board density than {{on the type of}} resin or fiber dimension. At a board density lower than 0.2 g/cm 3, the thermal conductivity is almost equivalent to those of thermal insulation materials such as polystyrene foam and rock wool, (4) Generally, the sound absorption coefficient of low-density <b>fiberboards</b> tends to increase at higher sound frequency. As the board thickness increases, low-frequency sounds are more readily absorbed by boards.|$|R

40|$|The {{feasibility}} of incorporating purified kraft lignin, at different concentrations ranging from 5 to 29 %, into <b>fiberboards</b> made from corn residues was studied.

30|$|Acetylated fibers with a 24.8 % {{weight gain}} by {{acetylation}} were ozonated with 0 %– 2.0 % ozone on fibers. <b>Fiberboards</b> were then made from these treated fibers. The internal bond and bending {{strength of the}} acetylated <b>fiberboards</b> increased drastically with increasing ozone charge up to 0.5 %– 1.0 %, whereas the thickness swelling of the <b>fiberboards</b> decreased. Ozone selectively cleaves the aromatic rings of hydrophobic lignin and introduces a hydrophilic carboxyl group into lignin. Thus, the wettability and thermoplasticity of acetylated fibers increased, and this structural modification improved the interfiber contact. Internal bond and bending strength increased as a result. In addition, steep density profiles were formed by the ozonation, resulting in high bending strength. The high compaction ratio accelerated the effect of ozonation. The optimum ozone charges for improving mechanical properties were 0.5 %– 1.0 %.|$|R
25|$|The pre-Columbian {{galleries}} were redesigned by Jorge Pardo, a Los Angeles {{artist who}} works in sculpture, design, and architecture. Pardo's display cases are built from thick, stacked sheets of medium-density <b>fiberboard</b> (MDF), with spacing of equal thickness in between the 70-plus layers. The laser-cut organic forms undulate and swell out from the walls, sharply contrasting to the rectangular display cases found in most art museums.|$|E

25|$|Non-food crops like Camelina, Jatropha, {{seashore}} mallow and mustard, {{used for}} biodiesel, can thrive on {{marginal agricultural land}} where many trees and crops won't grow, or would produce only slow growth yields. Camelina is virtually 100 percent efficient. It can be harvested and crushed for oil and the remaining parts {{can be used to}} produce high quality omega-3 rich animal feed, <b>fiberboard,</b> and glycerin. Camelina does not take away from land currently being utilized for food production. Most camelina acres are grown in areas that were previously not utilized for farming. For example, areas that receive limited rainfall that can not sustain corn or soybeans without the addition of irrigation can grow camelina and add to their profitability.|$|E
25|$|Formaldehyde {{levels in}} {{building}} environments {{are affected by}} a number of factors. These include the potency of formaldehyde-emitting products present, the ratio of the surface area of emitting materials to volume of space, environmental factors, product age, interactions with other materials, and ventilation condition. Formaldehyde emits from a variety of construction materials, furnishings, and consumer products. The three products that emit the highest concentrations are medium density <b>fiberboard,</b> hardwood plywood, and particle board. Environmental factors such as temperature and relative humidity can elevate levels because formaldehyde has a high vapor pressure. Formaldehyde levels from building materials are the highest when a building first opens because materials would have less time to off-gas. Formaldehyde levels decrease over time as the sources suppress.|$|E

40|$|In {{the recent}} past, {{increasing}} {{attention has been}} paid to the use of natural adhesives as a binder in the wood-based panel industry. Nowadays, two German companies are using Quebracho tannin and Wattle tannin for the production of particleboards and medium density <b>fiberboards</b> (MDF), respectively. To date no serious attention has been given to bond <b>fiberboards</b> using tannin derived from spruce bark. Results of research work on the use of spruce tannin as a binder for medium density <b>fiberboards</b> carried out in the last two years are presented. The results reveal that spruce tannin can be used to partially substitue Quebracho tannin in MDF up to about 60 %. Such boards still meet the specification of moisture resistant MDF (according to EN 319 und EN 321). Moreover, spruce tannin can be used to 100 % as a binder for the production of MDF for indoor use (type MDF EN 622 - 5) ...|$|R
