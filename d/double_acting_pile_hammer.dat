50|$|A {{hydraulic}} hammer {{is a modern}} type of <b>piling</b> <b>hammer</b> used in place of diesel and air hammers for driving steel pipe, precast concrete, and timber <b>piles.</b> Hydraulic <b>hammers</b> are more environmentally acceptable than the older, less efficient hammers as they generate less noise and pollutants. However, {{in many cases the}} dominant noise is caused by the impact of the <b>hammer</b> on the <b>pile,</b> or the impacts between components of the hammer, so that the resulting noise level can be very similar to diesel hammers.|$|R

An adjustable hammer throttle and feedback from an energy monitoring system was then used to create a fully automated hammer energy control system. The performance of this system is described in reference to a piling project in Canada where the automated energy control system was used to obtain an unprecedented level of quality control and assurance – data and graphs from the project are presented. The hammer energy control system (ECS) was used to successfully control and maintain a prescribed impact energy for the diesel hammer.

2500|$|A <b>double</b> <b>acting</b> {{engine is}} an engine where steam {{is applied to}} {{both sides of the}} piston. Earlier steam engines applied steam in only one direction, {{allowing}} momentum or gravity to return the piston to its starting place, but a <b>double</b> <b>acting</b> engine uses steam to force the piston in both directions, thus increasing rotational speed and power. Like the term [...] "simple engine", the term [...] "double acting" [...] is less frequently encountered in the literature since almost all marine engines were of the <b>double</b> <b>acting</b> type.|$|R

50|$|A <b>double</b> <b>acting</b> {{cylinder}} {{is extended}} and retracted using {{hydraulic or pneumatic}} pressure in both directions. <b>Double</b> <b>acting</b> telescopic cylinders are thus much more complex in design than the single acting type. This additional complexity {{is due to the}} requirement of adding retracting piston faces to all of the cylinder stages and the difficulty in supplying pressurized fluid to the retraction pistons of the intermediate stages.|$|R
50|$|Whenever fluid is {{supplied}} to the cylinder the piston will move. This movement of piston is called as stroke. The piston can move in forward or reverse direction.The cylinders {{can be classified}} as <b>double</b> <b>acting</b> or single acting. In single acting cylinder work will be performed only in the forward stroke. The fluid will be supplied to the cylinder only during the forward stroke. The return stroke is achieved by the spring mounted in the cylinder. In <b>double</b> <b>acting</b> cylinder {{there will be two}} ports for the supply of fluid. Work can be obtained both at forward and reverse strokes. Directional control valves required for the easy operation of <b>double</b> <b>acting</b> cylinder.|$|R

2500|$|The Franchot {{engine is}} a <b>double</b> <b>acting</b> engine invented by [...] {{in the nineteenth}} century. A <b>double</b> <b>acting</b> engine {{is one in which}} both sides of the piston are acted upon by the {{pressure}} of the working fluid. One of the simplest forms of a <b>double</b> <b>acting</b> machine, the Franchot engine consists of two pistons and two cylinders and acts like two separate alpha machines. In the Franchot engine, each piston acts in two gas phases, which makes more efficient use of the mechanical components than a single acting alpha machine. However, a disadvantage of this machine is that one connecting rod must have a sliding seal at the hot side of the engine, which is difficult when dealing with high pressures and temperatures.|$|R

5000|$|Vibratory <b>pile</b> <b>hammers</b> {{contain a}} system of {{counter-rotating}} eccentric weights, powered by hydraulic motors, and designed {{in such a way}} that horizontal vibrations cancel out, while vertical vibrations are transmitted into the pile. The pile driving machine is lifted and positioned over the pile by means of an excavator or crane, and is fastened to the pile by a clamp and/or bolts. Vibratory hammers can either drive in or extract a pile; extraction is commonly used to recover steel [...] "H" [...] piles used in temporary foundation shoring. Hydraulic fluid is typically supplied to the driver by a diesel engine powered pump mounted in a trailer or van and connected to the driver head through a set of long hoses. When the pile driver is connected to a dragline excavator, it is powered by the excavator's own diesel engine. Vibratory pile drivers are often chosen to mitigate noise, as when the construction is very close to residence or office buildings, or when there is not enough vertical clearance above the foundation to permit use of a conventional <b>pile</b> <b>hammer</b> (for example when retrofitting additional piles to a bridge column or abutment footing). Hammers are available with several different vibration rates, ranging from about 1200 vibrations per minute to about 2400 VPM; the vibration rate chosen is influenced by soil conditions at the site and other factors such as power requirements and purchase price of the equipment.|$|R

The lack of continuous power strokes in internal combustion engines was perceived by those used to steam as having the potential for mechanical problems due to the intermittent power strokes.
