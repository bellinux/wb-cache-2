40|$|AbstractFailure of a subsea {{crude oil}} API 5 L X 52 steel {{pipeline}} {{which led to}} oil leakage {{has been reported to}} occur after 27 years in service. Some leaks were found to form {{at the bottom of the}} horizontal API 5 L X 52 steel pipeline near an <b>elbow</b> <b>section</b> which connected the pipeline to a riser. The present investigation aims to analyze the main cause of failure by conducting standard failure analysis methods including visual examination, chemical and mechanical characterizations, metallurgical examinations using optical microscopy in combination with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) equipped with energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis and corrosion test using a three-electrode potential technique. Results of this investigation suggest that the cause of failure is electrochemical corrosion combined with mechanical process known as flow-induced corrosion.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{interaction}} between soil and pipeline in sand subjected to lateral ground displacements with emphasis on the peak force exerted to a bended elbow-pipe. A series of three-dimensional (3 D) finite-element (FE) analyses were performed in both opening and closing modes of the <b>elbow</b> <b>section</b> for different initial pipe bending angles. To model the mechanical behavior of sands, two soil models were adopted: Mohr-Coulomb and Nor-Sand soil model. Investigations also included the effects of pipe embedment depth and soil density. Results show that the opening mode exhibits higher ultimate forces and greater localized deformations than the closing mode. Nondimensional charts that account for pipeline location, bending angle, and soil density are developed. Soil-spring pipeline analyses of an elbow-pipe were performed using modified F δ soil-spring models based on the 3 D FE results and were compared {{to the findings of}} conventional spring model analyses using the standard two-dimensional soil-spring model. Results show that the pipe strain does not change in the closing mode case. However, in the opening mode case, the pipe strain computed by the modified analysis is larger than that by the conventional analysis and the difference is more pronounced when the pipe stiffness is stiffer...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} design nanotori for nanomechanical systems, perhaps {{involving}} oscillating components, precise physical parameters for the nanotori are necessary. Toroidal shaped molecules of carbon {{have been investigated}} previously by the present authors as constructed by connecting <b>elbow</b> <b>sections</b> formed from joining armchair and zigzag nanotubes through a pentagonal–heptagonal pair defect. In this paper, we extend this design by constructing the elbow structures from three distinct carbon nanotubes. Since for a toroidal molecule, there is a constraint on the bend angles in the <b>elbow</b> <b>sections</b> to add up to 360 °, particular elbow types which can accommodate this requirement are (5, 0) –(4, 4) –(7, 0) and (3, 3) –(6, 0) –(4, 4). We adopt a least squares approach for the bond length to minimise the variation from the ideal carbon–carbon bond length, which is taken to be σ = 1. 42 Å. Moreover, formulae for the mean generating radius of the nanotori and the mean radius of the nanotubes are obtained from certain integral expressions. This purely geometrical approach can be formally directly related to certain numerical energy minimisation methods used {{by a number of}} authors. Duangkamon Baowan, Barry J. Cox, James M.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} presents AMoEBA, the Adaptive Modeling by Evolving Blocks Algorithm. AMoEBA is {{an evolutionary}} technique for automatic decomposition of data fields and solver/descriptor placement. By automatically decomposing a numerical data set, the algorithm {{is able to}} solve a variety of problems {{that are difficult to}} solve with other techniques. Two key features of the algorithm are its ability to work with discrete data types and its unique geometric representation of the domain. AMoEBA uses genetic programming generated parse trees to define data segregation schemes. These trees also place solver/descriptors in the decomposed regions. Since the segregation trees define the boundaries between the regions, discrete representations of the data set are possible. AMoEBA is versatile and can be applied to many different types of geometries as well as different types of problems. In this thesis, three problems will be used to demonstrate the capabilities of this algorithm. For the first problem, AMoEBA used approximated algebraic expressions to match known profiles representing a steady-state conduction heat transfer problem and the fully-developed laminar flow through a pipe. To further illustrate the versatility of the algorithm, an inverse engineering problem was also solved. For this problem, AMoEBA placed different materials in the segregated regions defined by the trees and compared this to known temperature profiles. The final demonstration illustrates the application of AMoEBA to computational fluid dynamics. In this implementation, AMoEBA segregated an <b>elbow</b> <b>section</b> of pipe and placed numerical solvers in the regions. The resulting solver networks were solved and compared to a known solution. Both the time and accuracy of the networks were compared to determine if a faster solution method can be found with a reasonably accurate solution. Although AMoEBA is adapted for each application, the core algorithm of AMoEBA is unaltered in each application. This illustrates the flexibility of the algorithm...|$|E
40|$|Hypothermia is a {{life-threatening}} condition. Currently, active warming methods {{are the most}} effective treatment for dysthermic patients. The {{aim of this study}} is to investigate the use of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) in evaluating the thermal performance of a parallel/counter-parallel flow heat exchanger used as part of a fluid warmer to treat Hypothermia. The 3 D model of the heat exchanger is divided into three regions; Infusate (fluid to be heated), Hot Water (heating fluid), and a Solid Region (wall). At the end of the heat exchanger, an <b>elbow</b> <b>section</b> is used to create the counter-parallel flow arrangement specific to this design. The primary focus of this study involves evaluating heat transfer between the Infusate and Hot Water regions. Several simulations were performed for varying heat exchanger lengths (0. 6, 1. 2, 1. 8, and 2. 4 m). The current CFD predicted values were compared to previously collected experimental data. In the experimental set-up, the outlet temperature was evaluated using a center-point temperature probe. The current CFD study evaluated the outlets in terms of mean bulk temperature to better characterize the thermodynamic average with respect to fluid flow. Despite this difference, the CFD results of the Infusate outlet temperatures were within 20 % of the previously published experimental values. Using a center-point temperature probe, the CFD simulations were within 8 % of the experimental values. It was concluded that the CFD model accurately represented the thermodynamic characteristics of the heat exchanger and can be used for future design purposes. The Hot Water region features a unique geometric variation on the traditional concentric annulus; a separation along the mid-plane confines the flow to have the area of a true concentric annulus. As such, CFD was used to investigate the thermalhydraulic effects within the Hot Water region (semi-annulus). Correlations were developed to predict the hydrodynamic and thermal developing lengths within the Hot Water region. These correlations were determined for developing flow at the inlet and after the elbow sections of the Hot Water region. CFD simulations of the Hot Water region demonstrated increasing hydrodynamic and thermal developing lengths for increasing Reynolds Number under laminar and turbulent flow. Increased mass flow rates produce increased forces within the flow area, requiring increased axial length for thermal and hydrodynamic profiles to stabilize. Developing effects within a concentric annulus has been addressed in the literature; however the flow characteristics within the proposed semi-annulus are not as well understood. A comparative study was performed evaluating the studied Hot Water semi-annulus against a true concentric annulus. The CFD developed hydrodynamic entrance length correlation for the Hot Water region (semi-annulus) under laminar flow was compared to a known entrance length correlation for a true concentric annulus. Due to the separation along the mid-plane of the Hot Water region, the flow area and wetted perimeter of a true concentric annulus is expected to be greater than that of the semi-annular geometry. Greater flow interaction with the wall in the semi-annulus increases the viscous drag on the fluid, resulting generally in a lower non-dimensionalized developing length as a function of Reynolds Number. Pressure drop within the Hot Water region was also evaluated and compared to known properties of a true concentric annulus within the fully developed region. Under both laminar and turbulent flow, the studied semi-annulus of the Hot Water region demonstrated greater pressure drop than a true concentric annulus with similar dimensions and flow conditions. The <b>elbow</b> <b>section</b> of the Hot Water region produced a significant pressure drop, which may be due to the abrupt change in flow direction resulting in increased centrifugal forces and recirculation zones. The thermal and hydrodynamic properties revealed in the CFD simulations can be used to improve future design considerations, which may lead to improved Hypothermia treatment protocols and patient care...|$|E
40|$|One {{problem facing}} today's nuclear power {{industry}} is flow-accelerated corrosion and erosion in pipe elbows. The Korean Atomic Energy Research Institute (KAERI) is performing experiments in their Flow-Accelerated Corrosion (FAC) test loop to better characterize these phenomena, and develop advanced sensor technologies for the condition monitoring of critical elbows on a continuous basis. In parallel with these experiments, Sandia National Laboratories is performing Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) simulations {{of the flow}} in one elbow of the FAC test loop. The simulations are being performed using the FLUENT commercial software developed and marketed by Fluent, Inc. The model geometry and mesh were created using the GAMBIT software, also from Fluent, Inc. This report documents {{the results of the}} simulations that have been made to date; baseline results employing the RNG k-e turbulence model are presented. The predicted value for the diametrical pressure coefficient is in reasonably good agreement with published correlations. Plots of the velocities, pressure field, wall shear stress, and turbulent kinetic energy adjacent to the wall are shown within the <b>elbow</b> <b>section.</b> Somewhat to our surprise, these indicate that the maximum values of both wall shear stress and turbulent kinetic energy occur near the elbow entrance, on the inner radius of the bend. Additional simulations were performed for the same conditions, but with the RNG k-e model replaced by either the standard k-{var_epsilon}, or the realizable k-{var_epsilon} turbulence model. The predictions using the standard k-{var_epsilon} model are quite similar to those obtained in the baseline simulation. However, with the realizable k-{var_epsilon} model, more significant differences are evident. The maximums in both wall shear stress and turbulent kinetic energy now appear on the outer radius, near the elbow exit, and are {approx} 11 % and 14 % greater, respectively, than those predicted in the baseline calculation; secondary maxima in both quantities still occur near the elbow entrance on the inner radius. Which set of results better reflects reality must await experimental corroboration. Additional calculations demonstrate that whether or not FLUENT's radial equilibrium pressure distribution option is used in the PRESSURE OUTLET boundary condition has no significant impact on the flowfield near the elbow. Simulations performed with and without the chemical sensor and associated support bracket that were present in the experiments demonstrate that the latter have a negligible influence on the flow {{in the vicinity of the}} elbow. The fact that the maxima in wall shear stress and turbulent kinetic energy occur on the inner radius is therefore not an artifact of having introduced the sensor into the flow...|$|E

These lines, being manufactured and installed by industry, will connect the cold boxes of the 4. 5 -K refrigerators and the 1. 8 -K refrigeration units to the cryogenic interconnection boxes. The lines have a maximum of 30 -m length and may possess either small or large re-distribution units to allow connection to the interface ports. Due to space restrictions the lines may have complex routings and require several <b>elbowed</b> <b>sections.</b> The lines consist of a vacuum jacket, a thermal shield and either three or four helium process pipes. Specific internal and external supporting and compensation systems were designed for each line to allow for thermal contraction of the process pipes (or vacuum jacket, {{in case of a}} break in the insulation vacuum) and to minimise the forces applied to the interface equipment. Whenever possible, flexible hoses were used instead of bellows to allow for thermal compensation of the process pipes. If necessary, compensation units were integrated in the vacuum jacket. The thermal design was performed to fulfil the specified heat-load budget. This paper presents the main technical design choices for the lines together with their expected performance...|$|R

It was prepared at the National Engineering Laboratory, {{on behalf of the}} Health and Safety Executive, as part of an investigation into a specific incident in which an elbow failed on an offshore gas production facility.

40|$|International audienceThe {{application}} of a hinged elbow external fixator is technically demanding because the hinge axis must coincide exactly with theflexion–extension axis of the elbow. The standard technique involves inserting a 3 -mm K-wire freehand into the distal humerus to materialize theflexion–extension axis. We designed a guidewire device for extracorporeal hinge positioning without K-wire insertion. In a cadaver study, wecompared freehand K-wire insertion and our extracorporeal technique. Methods. – In 12 cadaveric elbows, we induced acute <b>elbow</b> instability by <b>sectioning</b> the medial collateral ligament complex and the anterior andposterior capsule. A hinged external fixator was applied to each elbow using both techniques. The outcome measures were procedure duration,number of image-intensifier shots (as a measure of radiation exposure), and passive motion range after fixator implantation. Results. – Compared with the freehand K-wire technique, the extracorporeal technique provided greater range of motion and significantly lowervalues for procedure duration and number of image-intensifier shots. Data dispersion was less marked with the extracorporeal technique, indicatingbetter reproducibility. Conclusion. – The extracorporeal technique based on a guidewire device enabled non-invasive positioning of a hinged elbow external fixator.

40|$|Various {{guidelines}} {{have been}} proposed regarding which portions of a surgical gown may be considered sterile. Unfortunately, the validity of these recommendations has not been definitively established. We therefore evaluated gown sterility after major spinal surgery to assess the legitimacy of these guidelines. We used sterile culture swabs to obtain samples of gown fronts at 6 -inch increments and at the elbow creases of 50 gowns {{at the end of}} 29 spinal operations. Another 50 gowns were swabbed immediately after they were applied to serve as negative controls. Bacterial growth was assessed using semiquantitative plating techniques on a nonselective, broad-spectrum media. Contamination was observed at all locations of the gown with rates ranging from 6 % to 48 %.

The <b>section</b> between the chest and operative field had the lowest contamination rates.

5000|$|Writing Without Teachers was Elbow's {{first book}} about writing, {{and the one}} that has made his freewriting {{technique}} so popular as a pedagogical practice. In this book, Elbow uses two main metaphors. These are metaphors that reflect Elbow's interest in letting one's ideas develop and change throughout the writing process. The first is to see writing as growing. It must move through stages. The first stage is to generate words before a writer can continue to [...] "grow" [...] a piece of writing and move through the subsequent stages. In this <b>section</b> <b>Elbow</b> stresses that it is crucial to write as much as possible because the more a writer writes, not only does he have more to work with, but he also has more to throw away, allowing him to keep moving through the growing stages of writing. The second metaphor is to see writing as cooking, letting ideas simmer and bubble until they are ready to be used. In this metaphor, Elbow emphasizes interaction, particularly between writing and reiteration. According to Elbow, growing is transformation at the macro level, cooking is transformation at the micro level. Essentially, the writing lets his ideas simmer until he can use them to interact with his writing. Elbow suggests that writers spend sufficient time writing as well as stopping completely and reflecting on what the larger picture is meant to present.|$|R
40|$|The Supreme Court’s {{judgment}} in R. v. Singh, released in 2007, settled the controversy regarding {{the scope of}} the Charter-enshrined section 7 right to silence in the context of custodial police questioning. The Court’s earlier decisions in R. v. Hebert (1990) and R. v. Oickle (2000) combined to raise questions about the interplay between the common law confessions rule and the Charter right to silence. Singh’s response was to cast the m as functional equivalents. Although the Court’s earlier jurisprudence may have seemed to suggest otherwise, Singh declared that there is no scope to argue that police conduct, in “persuading” a detainee to speak, can violate section 7 principles if it is found that such conduct did not overcome the choice of the detainee to speak under the confessions rule. Singh affords a high degree of tolerance to police conduct directed at persuading or influencing a detainee to speak. an extraordinary premium has been placed on state investigative interests in the context of post-arrest interrogation. In different contexts considered by the Court in past cases, the accused’s interest against self-conscription has prevailed in recognition of the central importance of the principle against self-incrimination to the criminal law. The current strictures of the section 24 (2) analysis — which effectively provides for an automatic rule of exclusion for conscriptive evidence obtained pursuant to a Charter breach — may account for the Court’s relatively narrow construction of the section 7 right to silence in relation to detained statements. Since Singh has eliminated any <b>elbow</b> room for <b>section</b> 7 once the voluntariness of a statement has been determined, we can expect to see changes in the focus of arguments for exclusion. For instance, greater attention will likely be paid to the personal circumstances and characteristics of individual accused in appraising the effect of persistent police interrogation. Another likely trend will be arguments for the exclusion of self-incriminating statements that are framed under the right to counsel...|$|R
