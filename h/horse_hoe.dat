5000|$|Horse hoes, {{resembling}} small ploughs, were a favourite implement {{of agricultural}} pioneer Jethro Tull, claiming {{in his book}} [...] "Horse Hoeing Husbandry" [...] that [...] "the horse-hoe will, in wide intervals, give wheat throughout all the stages of its life, as much nourishment as the discreet hoer pleases". The modern view is that, rather than nutrients being released, the crop simply benefits from the removal of competing plants. The introduction of the <b>horse</b> <b>hoe,</b> together with the better-known seed drill, brought about the great increase farming productivity seen during the British Agricultural Revolution.|$|E

One of his most vehement dissenters was Stephen Switzer, a contemporary landscape gardener and leader of the Private Society of Husbandmen and Planters. Following the publication of The Horse-Hoeing Husbandry: Or, An Essay on the Principles of Tillage and Vegetation in 1731, Switzer fiercely attacked Tull in the final two volumes of his own monthly publication, The Practical Husbandman and Planter, in 1734. He not only accused Tull of plagiarizing his technological inventions from others, namely the <b>horse</b> <b>hoe</b> and drill, but also attacked Tull for his criticism of farming techniques found in Virgil’s Georgics and his rejection of traditional, “Virgilian” husbandry.|$|E
5000|$|The {{company was}} founded in 1856 by Arthur Wallis and Charles Haslam in newly built {{premises}} which they named The North Hants Ironworks. The works were sited on Station Hill in Basingstoke and the company began trading as Wallis & Haslam. Shortly afterwards the company was highly commended for its hand-worked bench drilling machine at the 1857 Royal Agricultural show in Salisbury. Even at this early stage, the company was producing {{a wide variety of}} agricultural equipment, and alongside the bench drill were corn drills, turnip drills, four types of <b>horse</b> <b>hoe,</b> drag harrows, a 3 hp threshing machine, a barley hummeller and sundry other devices. In 1862 a third partner, Charles James Steevens, joined the company and when Charles Haslam retired in 1869 the company became Wallis & Steevens.The date of production for the company's first Portable steam engine is not known although the earliest surviving drawing is dated 1866. The first traction engine, an 8 hp single, was built in 1877 from drawings by Arthur Herbert Wallis (son of the company founder) and this vehicle made its trial run on 21 June that year. The vehicle, named [...] "Success" [...] on the strength of its performance during the test, was given the works number T250.|$|E

Besides shoeing horses and {{repairing}} peasants equipment, they started to make wagons, plows, <b>horse</b> <b>hoes,</b> cultivators and more. Many artisans were employed by Nils Holmqvist. A couple of them was Per Paulsson and his son Charles who was hired before the 1910. Charles later started his own and still manage his son and grandsons and their sons Pålsson machines {{in the village of}} Lilla harrie.|$|R
