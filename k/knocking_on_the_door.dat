5|$|Lana Tisdel's {{potential}} {{involvement in}} the {{rape and murder of}} Brandon Teena was also highlighted. Various people involved in the case, particularly Brandon's family, have alleged that Tisdel was somehow involved with the murders, or had at least set them up in an act of vengeance. Perhaps the most notable admission about Tisdel's motives came from Tom Nissen, who infamously confessed that Tisdel was present {{at the time of the}} murders in the car and had even tried <b>knocking</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> of the farmhouse where Brandon, Lambert and DeVine were staying. When nobody answered the door, Nissen alleges that Lotter broke in while Tisdel waited in the vehicle while the murders were carried out. Tisdel denied this and a lack of evidence meant that it could not be vigorously pursued in the proceeding court case—the residing judge considered most of Nissen's claims as nothing more than hearsay. Not only did Tisdel vehemently deny any involvement in Brandon's murder, she denied ever being present at Lisa Lambert's farmhouse on the night Brandon was murdered. Unlike Tisdel's own evidence and the admissions presented in court, Boys Don't Cry took the liberty of placing Tisdel at the crime scene, albeit without any intention of setting Brandon up.|$|E
25|$|The single's {{official}} {{music video}} {{was directed by}} Herb Ritts. The music video features two parts which frequently interchange back and forth throughout the song. The {{first part of the}} video shows Lopez having a small party in her home with guests including Ja Rule and Ashanti. This part of the video is {{from the point of view}} of the guy who is being mentioned in the song. His face is not seen, and Lopez addresses the camera throughout this section of the video. This section begins with the guy <b>knocking</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> Lopez inviting him in, and then eventually showing him the door when she sees him attempting to look/flirt with other women at the party. As he leaves, she goes on entertaining the other guests. The second part of the video involves scenes with Lopez, Ja Rule and Cadillac tah in a white room, Ja Rule in a recording studio in Lopez's home, Lopez sitting in a chair singing bits of the song, and Lopez and Ja Rule singing the parts of the final verse against a gold backdrop.|$|E

500|$|Sarria {{became the}} first openly gay {{candidate}} in the United States to run for public office, running in 1961 for {{a seat on the}} San Francisco Board of Supervisors. Sarria almost won by default. On the last day for candidates to file petitions, city officials realized that there were fewer than five candidates running for the five open seats, which would have assured Sarria a seat. By the end of the day, 34 candidates had filed. Sarria garnered some 6,000 votes, shocking political pundits and setting in motion the idea that a gay voting bloc could wield real power in city politics. As Sarria put it, [...] "From that day on, nobody ran for anything in San Francisco without <b>knocking</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> of the gay community." ...|$|E

Dürr notes: [...] "The most expressive text-engendered declamation is here ingeniously melted down into a structure only ten bars long but of compelling musical logic." [...] John Eliot Gardiner, who conducted the Bach Cantata Pilgrimage in 2000, compares it to an Emmaus scene in Bach's later cantata Bleib bei uns, denn es will Abend werden, BWV 6, the [...] "post-Resurrection appearance to the disciples" [...] in Halt im Gedächtnis Jesum Christ, BWV 67, even to [...] "the entry of the Commendatore in Mozart’s opera Don Giovanni.

Sarria garnered some 6,000votes in the citywide race, finishing ninth. This was not enough to win a seat but was enough to shock political pundits and set in motion the idea that a gay voting bloc could wield real power in city politics.

500|$|Although Churchill's, {{described}} by Lewington as [...] "the worst club {{that has ever}} been in Reading", tolerated such behaviour, the town's fashionable Sindlesham Mill nightclub did not, regularly barring Friday for his bizarre activities, including a dance he invented called [...] "the elephant" [...] which consisted of turning {{the pockets of his}} jeans inside out and undoing his flies to expose himself. He and his friends would regularly drink all day, though he was able to exert some self-control; according to his friend Syd Simmonds, Friday would obey Hurley's instruction not to drink for 48 hours before each game. However, he would play his prized heavy metal records very loudly at any time of the day or night and take LSD with casual indifference. Hurley attempted to calm Friday down by moving him into an apartment above the football club's elderly ex-groundsman, but to no avail: [...] "Even if it was three in the morning, the first thing would be to get the music playing", Simmonds later said. [...] "We had an old boy living below us ... the ex-groundsman at Reading. He was coming up to 80 and he had a dog's life in the flat.

The report describes how the killings were organised by Prafulla Mahanta, then the Assam Home Minister. They were executed by the police, with co-operation from the Indian Army. The gunmen were former members of ULFA who had surrendered to the government. They approached their targets at home, at night, <b>knocking</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> and speaking in Assamese to allay suspicion. When the victims answered the door, they were shot or kidnapped to be shot elsewhere.|$|E

Many Norwegians prepare for the event by consciously buying a small stock of sweets prior to it, to come in handy should any kids come <b>knocking</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> which is very probable in most areas.

6000|$|Fortified by the {{accession}} of {{this new}} ally, Godfrey slept fairly well, till within a little while of dawn, when he was awakened by a sound of rapping.

He was hastening headlong, muttering to himself his own flat meaningless name, like a child repeating as he runs his errand. And then {{as if in a}} charmed cold pool he awoke and opened his eyes again on the gathering darkness of the great bedroom, and heard a quick, importunate, long-continued <b>knocking</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> below, as of some one who had already knocked in vain.|$|E
