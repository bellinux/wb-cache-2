I had to assault a {{fortified}} position of the Chinese communists and wiped them out. And what is this Special Forces group that we commanded in the Army – '62–'65? That was the only remaining combat unit in the Philippine Army. The rest were training in a division set-up. We were in Luzon. We were in Sulu. And then, during the previous regime, Marawi incident. Who was sent there? Ramos. We defended the camp, being besieged by 400 rebels. So next time, look at the man’s record, don't just write and write. You said, no combat experience, no combat experience. Look around you who comes from the platoon, who rose to battalion staff, company commander, group commander, which is like a battalion, brigade commander, here and abroad. Abroad, I never had an abroad assignment that was not combat. NO SOFT JOBS FOR RAMOS. Thirty-seven years in the Armed Forces. REMEMBER THAT. You’re only writing about the fringe, but do not allow yourself to destroy the armed forces by those guys. You write about the majority of the Armed Forces who are on the job. That's why we're here enjoying our freedom, ladies and gentlemen. You are here. If the majority of the Armed Forces did not do their job, <b>I</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> if you’d all be here.|$|E
500|$|Despite the M2B's lack {{of success}} Herd said of the team, [...] "Everyone was ten times more {{determined}} to do better the following year." [...] On {{the design of the}} car he reflected that, [...] "our emphasis tended to be more on the elegance of the chassis structure rather than on the design of a really quick racing car" [...] and that, [...] "we ... tended to go towards technical ingenuity and bullshit rather than racewinning engineering". Team member and later manager of the organisation Teddy Mayer said, [...] "Our main problems were with the choice of the Ford engine." [...] Bruce McLaren's personal secretary and author Eoin Young concurs. The winners of the 1966 drivers' and constructors' championships, Jack Brabham and his eponymous team, used a Repco-modified and badged Oldsmobile engine. It produced approximately 290bhp – less than the Ford – but its light weight and reliability rendered it effective. Despite having used the Oldsmobile in sports racing cars, the McLaren team discounted it. Afterwards, Mayer said, [...] "We considered it, but the kind of modifications which Repco did were well beyond our resources, and <b>I</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> if we could have done any more with it than we did with the Indy Ford." ...|$|E
2500|$|After Bill McCay {{had written}} a series of five novels {{continuing}} the story the original creators had envisioned, and despite {{the success of the}} Stargate television series, Dean Devlin stated in 2006 that [...] "he has struck a production deal with MGM and is developing the long-delayed sequel feature films that will pick up the story from the 1994 original" [...] According to Devlin, two movie sequels would have picked up the story from the 1994 original, but not the mythology of the SG-1 and Atlantis series, with the original stars Kurt Russell and James Spader. Devlin regretted giving MGM control over the franchise. The first movie already tapped into Egyptian mythology; the second one would have moved into other mythologies; and the third would tie all the mythologies together. Stargate SG-1 and Stargate Atlantis producer Brad Wright said in 2002 that [...] "Devlin can wish to do a sequel to Stargate all he wants. MGM owns the rights, and <b>I</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> that they'll ask him to do it. He knows better." ...|$|E

60|$|The broad {{lines of}} the United States {{constitution}} were drawn {{in a period of}} almost universal monarchy. American affairs were overshadowed by the personality of George Washington, and as you know, monarchist ideas were so rife that there was a project, during the years of doubt and division that followed the War of Independence, for importing a German King, a Prussian Prince, in imitation of the British Monarchy. But if the United States were beginning again to-day on its present scale, would it put so much power and importance upon a single individual as it put upon George Washington and his successors in the White House? <b>I</b> <b>doubt</b> it <b>very</b> <b>much.</b>|$|R

6000|$|Until {{you make}} out {{practically}} that great work, {{a combination of}} opposing forces, [...] "a work of labor long, and endless praise," [...] the utmost caution {{ought to have been}} used in the reduction of the royal power, which alone was capable of holding together the comparatively heterogeneous mass of your States. But at this day all these considerations are unseasonable. To what end should we discuss the limitations of royal power? Your king is in prison. Why speculate on the measure and standard of liberty? <b>I</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>much,</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> indeed, whether France is at all ripe for liberty on any standard. Men are qualified for civil liberty in exact proportion to their disposition to put moral chains upon their own appetites,--in proportion as their love to justice is above their rapacity,--in proportion as their soundness and sobriety of understanding is above their vanity and presumption,--in proportion as they are more disposed to listen to the counsels of the wise and good, in preference to the flattery of knaves. Society cannot exist, unless a controlling power upon will and appetite be placed somewhere; and the less of it there is within, the more there must be without. It is ordained in the eternal constitution of things, that men of intemperate minds cannot be free. Their passions forge their fetters.|$|R

6000|$|Of {{the five}} stories {{in this volume}} The Lagoon, the last in order, is the {{earliest}} in date. It is the first short story I ever wrote and marks, {{in a manner of}} speaking, the end of my first phase, the Malayan phase with its special subject and its verbal suggestions. Conceived in the same mood which produced [...] "Almayer's Folly" [...] and [...] "An Outcast of the Islands," [...] it is told in the same breath (with what was left of it, that is, after the end of [...] "An Outcast"), seen with the same vision rendered in the same method--if such a thing as method did exist then in my conscious relation to this new adventure of writing for print. <b>I</b> <b>doubt</b> it <b>very</b> <b>much.</b> One does one's work first and theorizes about it afterwards.

2500|$|Upon release, Record Mirror {{reviewed}} the album and concluded: [...] "The numbers offer {{a lot of}} variety. The most immediate thing I noticed was the arrangements - which included some solid bass work that would have done justice to Led Zeppelin. Next, there's the use of backup vocals, something Slade haven't used {{too much in the}} past. Finally, there's the pace, lots of it. It's not an album of singles - it does present tracks that are a lot deeper than I expected. You're right lads, you're nobody's fools!" [...] New Musical Express wrote: [...] "Well if this album is an accurate representation of their album-making ability <b>I</b> <b>doubt</b> it <b>very</b> <b>much.</b> Oh, Slade are an exciting band. Plenty of kick and grit, and their unrefined charm which has been captured from their live performances in the studio environment, but though superficially the music here is of reasonable standard, there's not a lot of depth. Really the album is just a collection of hooky little singles." [...] Music Week wrote [...] "A cracking album, the group is now playing better than ever. Slade has matured {{to the point of being}} able to convert an older audience to their cause." ...|$|R
5000|$|Feynman {{attended}} Far Rockaway High School, {{a school}} in Far Rockaway, Queens, which was also attended by fellow Nobel laureates Burton Richter and Baruch Samuel Blumberg. Upon starting high school, Feynman was quickly promoted into a higher math class. A high-school-administered IQ test estimated his IQ at 125—high, but [...] "merely respectable" [...] according to biographer James Gleick. His sister Joan did better, allowing her to claim that she was smarter. Years later he declined to join Mensa International, saying that his IQ was too low. Physicist Steve Hsu stated of the test: [...] I suspect that this test emphasized verbal, as opposed to mathematical, ability. Feynman received {{the highest score in}} the United States by a large margin on the notoriously difficult Putnam mathematics competition exam... He also had the highest scores on record on the math/physics graduate admission exams at Princeton... Feynman's cognitive abilities might have been a bit lopsided... I recall looking at excerpts from a notebook Feynman kept while an undergraduate... it contained a number of misspellings and grammatical errors. <b>I</b> <b>doubt</b> Feynman cared <b>very</b> <b>much</b> about such things.|$|R
60|$|I do not {{remember}} the various steps by which I came to be discussing doubts so early in my life. I {{could not have been}} much more than thirteen when that conversation occurred. I am I think perhaps exceptionally unconscious about myself. I find I can recall the sayings and even the gestures of other people far more distinctly than the things I said and did myself. Even my dreams and imaginings are more active than my positive thoughts and proceedings. But <b>I</b> was no <b>doubt</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> stimulated by the literature lying about my home and the gleans and echoes of controversies that played like summer lightning round and about the horizons of my world. Over my head and after I had gone to bed, my father and Siddons were talking, my cousin was listening with strained apprehensions, there was a new spirit in my father's sermons; it was the storm of Huxley-Darwin controversies that had at last reached Burnmore. I was an intelligent little listener, an eager reader of anything that came to hand, Mr. Siddons had a disposition to fight his battles over again in his monologues to me; and after all at thirteen one isn't a baby. The small boy of the lower classes used in those days to start life for himself long before then.|$|R

6000|$|Under the {{regulations}} to which I refer, a schoolmaster {{can set up}} a class {{in one or more}} branches of science; his pupils will be examined, and the State will pay him, at a certain rate, for all who succeed in passing. I have acted as an examiner under this system from the beginning of its establishment, and this year I expect to have not fewer than a couple of thousand sets of answers to questions in Physiology, mainly from young people of the artisan class, who have been taught in the schools which are now scattered all over great Britain and Ireland. Some of my colleagues, who have to deal with subjects such as Geometry, for which the present teaching power is better organised, I understand are likely to have three or four times as many papers. So far as my own subjects are concerned, I can undertake to say that {{a great deal of the}} teaching, the results of which are before me in these examinations, is very sound and good; and I think it is in the power of the examiners, not only to keep up the present standard, but to cause an almost unlimited improvement. Now what does this mean? It means that by holding out a very moderate inducement, the masters of primary schools in many parts of the country have been led to convert them into little foci of scientific instruction; and that they and their pupils have contrived to find, or to make, time enough to carry out this object with a very considerable degree of efficiency. That efficiency will, <b>I</b> <b>doubt</b> not, be <b>very</b> <b>much</b> increased as the system becomes known and perfected, even with the very limited leisure left to masters and teachers on week-days. And this leads me to ask, Why should scientific teaching be limited to week-days? ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> also <b>doubt</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> {{whether he}} asked her to look about, on his behalf, for a future Lady Tester. This request he was so good as to make of me; but I told him I would {{have nothing to do with}} the matter. If Joscelind is unhappy, I am thankful to say the {{responsibility}} is not mine. I have found English husbands for two or three American girls, but providing English wives is a different affair. I know the sort of men that will suit women, but one would have to be very clever to know the sort of women that will suit men. I told Ambrose Tester that he must look out for himself, but, in spite of his promise, I had very little belief that he would do anything of the sort. I thought it probable that the old baronet would pass away without seeing a new generation come in; though when I intimated as much to Mr. Tester, he made answer in substance (it was not quite so crudely said) that his father, old as he was, would hold on till his bidding was done, and if it should not be done, he would hold on out of spite. [...] "Oh, he will tire me out;" [...] that I remember Ambrose Tester did say. I had done him injustice, for six months later he told me he was engaged. It had all come about very suddenly. From one day to the other the right young woman had been found. I forget who had found her; some aunt or cousin, I think; it had not been the young man himself. But when she was found, he rose to the occasion; he took her up seriously, he approved of her thoroughly, and I am not sure that he didn't fall a little in love with her, ridiculous (excuse my London tone) as this accident may appear. He told me that his father was delighted, and I knew afterwards that he had good reason to be. It was not till some weeks later that I saw the girl; but meanwhile I had received the pleasantest impression of her, and this impression came--must have come--mainly from what her intended told me. That proves that he spoke with some positiveness, spoke as if he really believed he was doing a good thing. I had it on my tongue's end to ask him how Lady Vandeleur liked her, but I fortunately checked this vulgar inquiry. He liked her evidently, as I say; every one liked her, and when I knew her I liked her better even than the others. I like her to-day more than ever; it is fair you should know that, in reading this account of her situation. It doubtless colors my picture, gives a point to my sense of the strangeness of my little story.|$|R
