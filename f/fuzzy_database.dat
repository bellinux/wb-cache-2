40|$|Abstract — Information in {{real-world}} applications is often vague, imprecise and uncertain. Ignoring the inherent imperfect nature of real-world will undoubtedly introduce some deformation of human perception of real-world and may eliminate several substantial information, {{which may be}} very useful in several data-intensive applications. In database context, several <b>fuzzy</b> <b>database</b> models have been proposed. In these works, fuzziness is introduced at different levels. Common to all these proposals is the support of fuzziness at the attribute level. This paper proposes first a rich set of data types devoted to model {{the different kinds of}} imperfect information.

The proposed approach was implemented within a relational object database model but it is generic enough to be incorporated into other database models.

In comparison with conventional approaches including sta- tistical analysis, neural networks or data min- ing, it has the biggest advantage that ac- quired logic represented in fuzzy If-then rules are human readable and easily understand- able semantics.

40|$|Abstract—The join {{dependency}} {{provides the}} basis for obtaining lossless join decomposition in a classical relational schema. The existence of Join dependency shows that that the tables always represent the correct data after being joined. Since the classical relational databases cannot handle imprecise data, they were extended to <b>fuzzy</b> relational <b>databases</b> so that uncertain, ambiguous, imprecise and partially known information can also be stored in databases in a formal way. However like classical <b>databases,</b> the <b>fuzzy</b> relational <b>databases</b> also undergoes decomposition during normalization, the issue of joining the decomposed fuzzy relations remains intact. Our effort in the present paper is to emphasize on this issue. In this paper we define fuzzy join dependency {{in the framework of}} type- 1 <b>fuzzy</b> relational <b>databases</b> & type- 2 <b>fuzzy</b> relational <b>databases</b> using the concept of fuzzy equality which is defined using fuzzy functions. We use the fuzzy equi-join operator for computing the fuzzy equality of two attribute values. We also discuss the dependency preservation property on execution of this fuzzy equi- join and derive the necessary condition for the fuzzy functional dependencies to be preserved on joining the decomposed fuzzy relations. We also derive the conditions for fuzzy join dependency to exist in context of both type- 1 and type- 2 <b>fuzzy</b> relational <b>databases.</b> We find that unlike the classical relational databases even the existence of a trivial join dependency does not ensure lossless join decomposition in type- 2 <b>fuzzy</b> relational <b>databases.</b> Finally we derive the conditions for the fuzzy equality to be non zero and the qualification of an attribute for fuzzy key.

40|$|A fast search {{algorithm}} {{for a large}} <b>fuzzy</b> <b>database</b> Abstract—In this paper, {{we propose}} a fast search algorithm for a large <b>fuzzy</b> <b>database</b> that stores iris codes or data with a similar binary structure. The fuzzy nature of iris codes and their high dimensionality render many modern search algorithms, mainly relying on sorting and hashing, inadequate. The algorithm that is used in all current public deployments of iris recognition {{is based on a}} brute force exhaustive search through a database of iris codes, looking for a match that is close enough. Our new technique, Beacon Guided Search (BGS), tackles this problem by dispersing a multitude of “beacons ” in the search space. Despite random bit errors, iris codes from the same eye are more likely to collide with the same beacons than those from different eyes. By counting the number of collisions, BGS shrinks the search range dramatically with a negligible loss of precision. We evaluate this technique using 632, 500 iris codes enrolled in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) border control system, showing a substantial improvement in search speed with a negligible loss of accuracy. In addition, we demonstrate that the empirical results match theoretical predictions.

Fuzzy databases overcome this limitation by allowing each {{entry in the}} table to be a fuzzy set where each element of the corresponding domain is assigned a membership degree from the real interval [0 … 1]. But this fuzzy mechanism becomes inappropriate in modelling scenarios where data might be incomparable. Therefore, we become interested in further generalization of <b>fuzzy</b> <b>database</b> into L-fuzzy database. In such a database, the characteristic function for a fuzzy set maps to an arbitrary complete Brouwerian lattice L. From the query language perspectives, the language of <b>fuzzy</b> <b>database,</b> FSQL extends the regular Structured Query Language (SQL) by adding fuzzy specific constructions. In addition to that, L-fuzzy query language LFSQL introduces appropriate linguistic operations to define and manipulate inexact data in an L-fuzzy database.

However, it requires an abstract algebraic theory {{which can be used}} to prove all the properties of, and operations on, L-fuzzy relations.

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, a fuzzy {{equivalence}} relation is defined, generally, superseding {{most of the}} established results. The technique of employing sets of values for tuple components to express imprecision and redundancy in relational databases was proposed by Buckles and Petry in their classic works on <b>fuzzy</b> relational <b>databases</b> [1], [2]. By employing finite scalar domains with similarity relations and special fuzzy number domains, Buckles and Petry have demonstrated that the classical properties of uniqueness of tuple interpretations and well-definedness of the relational algebra can be retained in the <b>fuzzy</b> relational <b>database</b> model. The key {{to the preservation of}} these properties is the fact that scalar domains with similarity relations and the fuzzy number domains can be partitioned into equivalence classes. However, since equivalence classes can be constructed by assuming the existence of similarity relations, it is desirable to generalize the <b>fuzzy</b> relational <b>database</b> model to one based only on equivalence classes.
