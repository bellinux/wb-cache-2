Recently, several researchers have proposed using the text surrounding citations (references) {{as a means of}} automatically <b>indexing</b> <b>documents</b> for search engines, claiming that this technique is superior to <b>indexing</b> <b>documents</b> based on their content [1, 2]. While we ourselves have made this claim, we acknowledge that little empirical data has been presented to support it. Therefore, in the limited space available we present a terse overview of a study comparing reference to content as bases for <b>indexing</b> <b>documents.</b> This study indicates that reference identifies the value of documents more accurately and with a greater diversity of language than content...|$|E

However, the information in this synchronized collection is not immediately searchable, since the keyword index is rebuilt from scratch less frequently than the collection can be refreshed. An inverted index is usually used to <b>index</b> <b>documents</b> crawled from the web. Complete index rebuild at high frequency is expensive. Previous work on incremental inverted index updates have been restricted to adding and removing documents.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the filtering approach for searching documents whose structure {{is defined by}} a grammar. The method {{is based on the}} theoretical model for defining filters to specify information interest of a user. It is employed to find documents in SYNDOC, a syntax-directed text processing system. The method is suitable, for example, for SGML and ODA documents. The user selects a grammar and <b>indexes</b> only <b>documents</b> for the selected grammar. A filter generated in a syntax-directed way using the grammar describes conditions for <b>indexed</b> <b>documents</b> integrating structure and content constraints. The user compares a filter with <b>indexed</b> <b>documents</b> and, either edits, browses or prints original documents using the selected output form. <b>Indexed</b> <b>documents,</b> filters and retrieved documents can be stored for further purpose...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Concept mapping {{has been}} used {{extensively}} in educational settings as a learning and teaching tool and, more recently, as a knowledge elicitation tool to capture expert knowledge for preservation purposes. In these contexts, electronic concept maps annotated with supplementary multi-media resources can provide {{a rich source of}} information. Unfortunately, it can be challenging for users to identify the right resources to attach, especially when dealing with large resource collections. This paper presents ongoing research on methods for easing the annotation task by automatically searching a document library for relevant documents and suggesting them as potential associations for concepts in a map. The paper begins by discussing how concept map structure can be exploited to automatically generate queries to a database of indexed documents, to search for documents to link to the concepts in a map. It then presents methods for <b>indexing</b> <b>documents</b> to improve the search results. The methods for generating queries and <b>indexing</b> <b>documents</b> have been evaluated using two pre-existing expert knowledge models, with encouraging results. ...|$|E

In digital {{libraries}} semantic techniques are often deployed {{to reduce the}} expensive manual overhead for <b>indexing</b> <b>documents,</b> maintaining metadata, or caching for future search. However, using such techniques may cause a decrease in a collection’s quality due to their statistical nature.

30|$|Unlike an RDBMS, {{where every}} row in a table follows the same schema, each {{document}} inside these document stores {{can have a}} different structure. Document stores provide the capability of <b>indexing</b> <b>documents</b> based on the primary key {{as well as on}} the contents of the documents. This indexing and querying capability based on document contents differentiates this data model from the key-value stores model, in which the values are opaque to the data store. On the other hand, document stores can store only data that can be represented as a document. Like key-value stores, they are inefficient in multiple-key transactions involving cross-document operations.|$|E
