5|$|Original Stories is {{primarily}} about leaving the imperfections of childhood behind {{and becoming a}} rational and charitable adult; it does not romanticise childhood as an <b>innocent</b> <b>and</b> ideal state of being.

5|$|With {{evidence}} strongly {{pointing to}} Desha as the murderer, General William Reed summoned Desha {{to his house}} on November 9 and ordered him to remain until an examining trial could be held. Desha complied, showed no emotion when viewing Baker's body, and {{did not attempt to}} flee although left unguarded in the house. The examining trial resulted in Desha's formal arrest, and he was imprisoned in Flemingsburg, Kentucky. Relief Party partisans said that Desha was <b>innocent</b> <b>and</b> his arrest was fabricated by the Anti-Relief Party to embarrass his father Governor Desha and weaken him politically.|$|E

5|$|Black Swan is a 2010 American {{psychological}} horror film {{directed by}} Darren Aronofsky. The screenplay by Mark Heyman, Andres Heinz and John McLaughlin {{is from a}} story by Heinz. It stars Natalie Portman, Vincent Cassel, Mila Kunis, Barbara Hershey and Winona Ryder. The plot revolves around a production of Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake ballet by a prestigious New York City ballet company. The production requires a ballerina to play the <b>innocent</b> <b>and</b> fragile White Swan, for which the committed dancer Nina (Portman) is a perfect fit, {{as well as the}} dark and sensual Black Swan, which are qualities better embodied by the new arrival Lily (Kunis). Nina is overwhelmed by a feeling of immense pressure when she finds herself competing for the part, causing her to lose her tenuous grip on reality and descend into a living nightmare.|$|E
5|$|Heins {{examines}} {{the question of}} whether children and adolescents are negatively impacted by exposure to violence and pornography, contending that youth are not endangered by sexually explicit material. She believes that censorship of such material from adolescents is {{based on the idea that}} minors are <b>innocent</b> <b>and</b> exposure to inappropriate media would corrupt them, explaining how this belief has been used as a basis for censorship. Heins explores whether the government or parents should restrict children's access to potentially inappropriate material, believing that the decision should rest primarily with parents. She writes that there is no simple tactic by which government can censor material from children without violating First-Amendment rights guaranteed to adults. Heins warns that attempting to categorize forms of creative expression in order to prohibit particular works of art results in censorship choices which reflect an ideological point-of-view.|$|E

Both of Moira's ghostly forms (Conroy and Alexandra Breckenridge) and other ghosts, including nurse Gladys (Celia Finkelstein), Beau (Sam Kinsey), the exterminator (W. Earl Brown), and the Black Dahlia (Mena Suvari), join the Harmons to protect the Ramoses, a new family that moved in, against malicious ghosts.|$|E

She's also {{on the run from}} a pimp named Raoul (Coati Mundi) and his lackey Benny (Dennis Burkley), the people who killed Johnny.

5|$|Periyar {{spent over}} fifty years giving speeches, {{propagating}} the realisation {{that everyone is}} an equal citizen and the differences on basis of caste and creeds were man-made to keep the <b>innocent</b> <b>and</b> ignorant as underdogs in the society. Although Periyar's speeches were targeted towards the illiterate and more mundane mass, scores of educated people were also swayed. Periyar viewed reasoning as a special tool. According to him, all were blessed with this tool, but very few used it. Thus Periyar used reasoning, with respect to subjects of social interest, in his presentations to his audiences. Communal differences in Tamil society were {{considered by many to}} be deep-rooted features until Periyar came to the scene.|$|E

5|$|Tameka Williams {{qualified}} {{to run in}} the 100 meter and 200 meter sprints. Williams, who would later compete in the 2016 Rio Olympics, was disqualified because she admitted that she used a banned substance. She voluntarily told her Olympic committee about using a banned substance, and it was announced on July 29 that she would not compete. Williams admitted to using a drug named Blast Off Red, which is typically used to enhance the performance of racehorses and greyhounds. Williams had posted on Facebook that she was <b>innocent</b> <b>and</b> had passed drug tests prior to the Olympics. While the drug is not listed as prohibited by the World Anti-Doping Agency, it falls into the category of veterinary medicine and therefore its use is not permitted.|$|E
5|$|The Hemingway scholar Allen Josephs {{thinks the}} novel is {{centered}} on the corrida (the bullfighting), and how each character reacts to it. Brett seduces the young matador; Cohn fails to understand and expects to be bored; Jake understands fully because only he moves between {{the world of the}} inauthentic expatriates and the authentic Spaniards; the hotel keeper Montoya is the keeper of the faith; and Romero is the artist in the ring—he is both <b>innocent</b> <b>and</b> perfect, and the one who bravely faces death. The corrida is presented as an idealized drama in which the matador faces death, creating a moment of existentialism or nada (nothingness), broken when he vanquishes death by killing the bull.|$|E
5|$|The {{election}} was {{opposed by the}} Cistercian monasteries of Yorkshire, and by the archdeacons of York. The Cistercians opposed {{on the grounds that}} the Second Lateran Council in 1139 had given the religious houses of a diocese the right to participate in the election of the bishop. Theobald of Bec, the Archbishop of Canterbury, refused to recognise William's election due to allegations of simony, or the acquisition of church positions by bribery, and of interference by King Stephen. In 1143, Pope Innocent II ruled that William could be confirmed in office if he swore under oath that the allegations were false. After he swore the oath, Henry of Blois, who was also papal legate, found William <b>innocent,</b> <b>and</b> he was consecrated as archbishop on 26 September 1143.|$|E

5|$|Carol quarrels with Lilac and storms off. Lilac sends Milla to {{find her}} and then goes to save Torque from Brevon's nearby base, but she is {{captured}} and tortured by Brevon. Meanwhile, Carol and Milla ally with Spade to storm the base, where they rescue Torque and Lilac. However, they are all separated in the ensuing conflict. Neera finds Lilac, arrests her, and brings her back to Shang Tu, where the Magister determines that she is <b>innocent</b> <b>and</b> reveals that Zao is challenging Shuigang for the Stone. Lilac rejoins her friends and convinces Shang Mu and Shang Tu to unite against Dail and Brevon's army. During the battle, Brevon announces that his ship is repaired, and Lilac, Milla, and Carol board it. The team combats Brevon's minions, including a mutated Serpentine. Brevon captures Milla and turns her into a grotesque monster that attacks the other protagonists, who are forced to render her unconscious. Enraged, Lilac and Carol attack and defeat Brevon, but the Kingdom Stone is destroyed in the process. Shortly after the battle, Milla awakens in a medical tent and sees the sky lit up by swirling, crystalline energy released from the Kingdom Stone. The three kingdoms resolve to harness the Stone's power and share it equally, thereby bringing {{an end to the}} war. Torque says goodbye to Lilac, Carol, and Milla and returns to space.|$|E
5|$|Clarke privately tells Warren that {{he thinks}} Elizabeth is <b>innocent</b> <b>and</b> {{that he is not}} sure that the pair are doing God's work. Warren threatens that Clarke himself will be tried and convicted if he objects further. The trial resumes—Elizabeth having been {{tortured}} overnight—and Elizabeth's mouse, Snowflake, is released, so that it might lead them to the witch. Warren has sprinkled crumbs in front of Elizabeth. When Snowflake approaches Elizabeth, Pike declares her a witch, and sentences her to be burned. Thomas and Sarah later say goodbye to a hooded and bound Elizabeth, who awaits execution. Clarke dismisses them. He removes the hood from the figure to reveal that he has bound Warren in Elizabeth's place; Clarke believes Warren has been tainted with evil, and that the latter is no longer doing God's work. Clarke puts back the hood, and Pike enters, happy that the trial has seen a revival of trade and visitors to the village. Warren is taken away to be burnt. Clarke releases the real Elizabeth, but she reveals that she truly is a witch; she breaks Clarke's neck, killing him. There are sounds of excitement from outside as flames light Elizabeth's face. She tells Snowflake that she will go to her master, then transforms into a raven and leaves.|$|E
5|$|De Gray's {{ability to}} raise money made him useful to John. In 1213 de Gray mustered 500knights during a period when Philip II was {{threatening}} to invade England, bringing this force over from Ireland along with mounted men-at-arms to support the king in England. In May 1213, John and Innocent finally resolved the dispute over Langton's election to Canterbury, {{and part of the}} settlement was that John gave Ireland and England to <b>Innocent</b> <b>and</b> received them back from the pope, making John a papal vassal. The settlement was sealed with a treaty, to which de Gray was one of the witnesses. After John settled with the papacy, de Gray {{was not included in the}} general pardon, and had to go to Rome to be pardoned. While in that city the bishop was named as one of the guarantors of a new financial arrangement between the king and the pope dealing with feudal payments from England, which lowered the lump sum that had to be paid before Innocent would lift the interdict. After Innocent pardoned de Gray, the pope recommended his election as Bishop of Durham in 1213; but de Gray died during his journey back to England on 18 October 1214, at Saint-Jean-d'Angély in Poitou. He was buried in Norwich Cathedral, but his tomb has not survived.|$|E
