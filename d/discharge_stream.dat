A definitive version was subsequently published at: [URL] and high-speed particle image velocimetry (PIV) techniques have been employed to study the flow field induced by a sawtooth (EkatoMizer) impeller, operated in the fully turbulent flow regime at an impeller speed of 1500 rpm. Ensemble-averaged mean flow fields and turbulence quantities were calculated for a region close to the impeller blades. The flow was found to be anisotropic near the impeller and exhibited return-to-isotropy behaviour further away from it. Macroinstabilities were found to have a high probability of occurrence in the <b>discharge</b> <b>stream.</b> All three velocity components from the stereo-PIV measurements were used to estimate the dissipation rate, by adopting a large eddy simulation (LES) analogy. Spurious vectors distorting the dissipation rate calculation were identified, and various standard deviation filters were applied for vector validation. By evaluating the filtered dissipation rate profiles against the multi-fractal intermittency model of Meneveau and Sreenivasan (1991), the global standard deviation filter was found to be the most suitable type.

40|$|In {{the present}} work, the double- to single-loop flow pattern {{transition}} in a stirred vessel {{equipped with a}} Rushton turbine is investigated by Laser Doppler anemometry (LDA). In particular, the clearance at which such transition occurs is assessed by comparing axial velocity profiles underneath the impeller. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations of the same system are carried out, by employing the 'inner-outer' fully predictive computation strategy. The comparison of predicted results with the experimental data collected shows that the transition is well reproduced by simulations. A good agreement on the mean velocities is also observed but for the impeller <b>discharge</b> <b>stream</b> angle to the horizontal in the single-loop flow pattern configuration.
