5|$|As King William {{intensely}} {{disliked the}} Duchess and Conroy, {{he vowed to}} wait until Victoria came of age to die simply {{to keep them from}} a regency.

5|$|The Order is {{dedicated}} to the principles of Charity, Unity, Fraternity, and Patriotism. A First Degree exemplification ceremony, by which a man joins the Order, explicates the virtue of charity. He {{is said to be a}} First Degree Knight of Columbus; after participating in the subsequent degrees, each of which focuses on another virtue, he rises to that status. Upon reaching the Third Degree, a gentleman is a full member. Priests do not participate directly in Degree exemplifications as laymen do, but rather take the <b>degree</b> <b>by</b> observation.|$|E
5|$|The idea of {{reviving}} the ancient Olympic Games {{had been raised}} {{from time to time}} during the early and mid 19th century, inspired to a certain <b>degree</b> <b>by</b> romanticism and patriotism.

In 1852, archaeologist Ernst Curtius stated during a lecture that the Olympic events would be revived.|$|E
5|$|The major {{substantive}} {{criticisms of}} Satin's work have remained constant over time.

His ideas have also occasionally been seen as not politically serious, or as non-political {{in the sense of}} not being capable of challenging existing power structures. His work is sometimes said to be largely borrowed from others, a charge that first surfaced with regard to his draft dodger manual, and was repeated to varying <b>degree</b> <b>by</b> critics of his books on New Age politics and radical centrism.|$|E
