2500|$|The 2,000 seater theatre {{opened on}} 10 December 1900 with the play [...] "Sign of the Cross," [...] {{performed}} by William Greet's company, with Edward Vincent as the Prefect and Virginia Buckle as the Christian girl Mercia. The {{front of the}} theatre was described as [...] "red terra-cotta, divided by Ionic pilasters into five bays" [...] and the foyer was described as [...] "a hall 34 feet long and 18 feet wide, with marble mosaic floor, walls panelled in <b>fibrous</b> <b>plaster,</b> and hand-painted ceiling". The dimensions of the stage were also recorded as [...] "Its width is 74 feet, {{the distance from the}} curtain line to the back wall is 40 feet, the distance from stage to grid is 50 feet, and the proscenium opening is 30 feet in width.|$|E
2500|$|The {{hall was}} {{refurbished}} in 1995 {{at a cost}} of £10.3 million; during this time concerts were performed in Liverpool Cathedral. [...] As part of this refurbishment, the curving interior, which had originally been constructed in <b>fibrous</b> <b>plaster,</b> was replaced with concrete. [...] In 1997 Libor Pešek resigned as principal conductor and was given the title of conductor laureate. [...] He was succeeded by Petr Altrichter who continued in the post until 2001, being followed by Gerard Schwarz. [...] Schwarz resigned in 2006 and his place as principal conductor was taken by the young Russian Vasily Petrenko. [...] At the time of his appointment he was aged 29 and was the youngest conductor to have held the post. [...] Also in 2006 the society entered into a sponsorship agreement with the radio music station Classic FM. [...] It was the station's first arts partner and the orchestra was given the title of the Classic FM Orchestra in North West England. [...] As a result of this partnership, concerts of more [...] "popular and accessible" [...] pieces from the classical repertoire are played, and the radio station broadcasts some of these concerts. [...] By the start of 2008, the station had broadcast 25concerts, and the contract for the partnership has been extended to 2012. [...] In 2008 Liverpool was a European Capital of Culture and the society {{played a major role in}} the events performed as part of this celebration. [...] In 2009, Petrenko's title was changed from principal conductor to chief conductor, and he extended his contract with the society until 2015.|$|E
50|$|The {{proscenium}} arch is constructed in a perforated pattern of <b>fibrous</b> <b>plaster</b> over a timber frame. It is {{noted for its}} size and the lighting effects that were a feature.|$|E
50|$|Gypsum {{plasters}} {{have been}} lightened by using chemical additives to create bubbles that displace solids, thus reducing the bulk density. Also, lightweight polystyrene beads {{have been mixed}} into the plasters at the factory {{in an effort to}} reduce the density, which generally results in a more effective insulation at a lower cost. The resulting plaster has qualified to the A2 combustibility rating as per DIN4102. <b>Fibrous</b> <b>plasters,</b> containing either mineral wool, or ceramic fibres tend to simply entrain more air, thus displacing the heavy fibres. On-site cost reduction efforts, at times purposely contravening the requirements of the certification listing, can further enhance such displacement of solids. This has resulted in architects' specifying the use of on-site testing of proper densities to ensure the products installed meet the certification listings employed for each installed configuration, because excessively light inorganic fireproofing does not provide adequate protection and, thus, could be in violation of the listings.|$|R
5000|$|... spray {{fireproofing}} (application of intumescent or endothermic paints, or <b>fibrous</b> or cementitious <b>plasters</b> to keep substrates such as structural steel, electrical or mechanical services, valves, liquefied {{petroleum gas}} (LPG) vessels, vessel skirts, bulkheads or decks below either 140 °C for electrical items or ca. 500 °C for structural steel elements to maintain operability of the item to be protected) ...|$|R
5000|$|Born in Dundee on 25 March 1868, {{the son of}} a plasterer, Clarks {{family moved}} to London when he was still young. In 1913 Clark joined with Harry Fenn, a surveyor, {{founding}} a company at Loughborough Junction to specialise in ornamental <b>fibrous</b> plasterwork and <b>Plaster</b> of Paris work. The business was a rapid success with commissions from the new cinemas and major theatres who competed against each other through the splendour of their interior decoration. For designs, Clark & Fenn worked closely with G. Jackson & Sons, founded in 1780 with Robert Adam as a designer. The company soon moved to larger premises at Clapham Old Town where they were able to prefabricate much of their work off-site. This allowed them to take the mouldings ready-prepared for installation to a theatre or cinema, minimising the disruption to performances and rehearsals.|$|R
50|$|The hall, {{across the}} rear of the library, is much more intact and {{features}} a <b>fibrous</b> <b>plaster</b> ceiling with coffered timber beams. Two large roof ventilators are built into the hall roof.|$|E
50|$|The {{upper level}} is clad with <b>fibrous</b> <b>plaster</b> {{sheeting}} and has deep balconies {{at the front}} and rear. That at the front has timber balustrading and that at the rear has been built in with <b>fibrous</b> <b>plaster</b> sheeting and glass louvres. This floor contains a large central hall with corridors running off it to each side from which the publican's flat and guest bedrooms are accessed. The hall and four of the guest bedrooms open onto the front balcony. There bathrooms on the rear verandah. The walls are of vertical boards and the rooms are ceiled with fibrous sheeting and battens.|$|E
50|$|The {{materiality}} {{that uses}} {{in the house}} were unadorned, they are <b>fibrous</b> <b>plaster</b> ceiling left in natural, unpainted stated, flat steel decking roof, timber walls, and reinforced concrete floor slab under concrete block.|$|E
50|$|The deep profile {{corrugated}} fibrous cement {{main roof}} is supported on single span steel trusses {{which have a}} segmentally curved bottom chord and have been manufactured from riveted angle iron sections. The bottom chord of the trusses are clad in <b>fibrous</b> <b>plaster</b> that sweeps down the walls and over iron supporting stanchions. The ceiling which follows the curve is lined with Craftex, a proprietary fibrous board. This material has been used extensively {{on the walls and}} ceilings inside the auditorium for its sound absorption qualities. Perforated <b>fibrous</b> <b>plaster</b> vents are located down the centre of the auditorium ceiling that connect to five ridge vents.|$|E
50|$|The {{remaining}} {{rooms are}} functional in style with undecorated concrete walls and simple fittings. The <b>fibrous</b> <b>plaster</b> ceilings {{are high and}} large louvered windows are positioned high in the internal walls to allow airflow through the building.|$|E
50|$|The {{interior}} of the building is divided into five small rooms that retain many early fittings and fixtures, including fume cupboards, lab benches, sinks and other equipment. Early wall vents are in place. Ceilings are of <b>fibrous</b> <b>plaster</b> or cement sheeting with timber cover strips.|$|E
50|$|The main arched {{ceiling of}} the {{auditorium}} is clad in perforated ceiling panels and the ceiling cove is clad in <b>fibrous</b> <b>plaster</b> sheeting. The cove is supported by curved timber hangers and has circular lights in two rows in the underside. The auditorium floor is polished timber.|$|E
50|$|Like the exterior, the {{interior}} is largely intact. All the rooms are lined with vertical v-jointed tongue and groove boards, the ceilings are moulded <b>fibrous</b> <b>plaster</b> and the joinery is generally clear finished silky oak with a lamb's tongue profile. Multi-pane French doors with obscure glazing open onto the verandahs {{from most of the}} rooms.|$|E
50|$|The toilet blocks have {{polished}} concrete floors, <b>fibrous</b> <b>plaster</b> sheet {{walls and}} ceilings, with timber coverstrips and cornices. The rooms have square timber framed windows of obscure glass louvres. The cubicle partitions are terrazzo {{and the walls}} are lined with green square ceramic tiles. The toilet blocks retain original fixtures and fittings including toilets, urinal, basins, and light fittings.|$|E
50|$|The {{upper level}} offices have ripple iron ceilings, moulded timber {{architraves}} and chimney pieces. The internal doors are four-panelled with toplights and glazed french doors with toplights open onto the verandahs. There is a timber staircase with turned balusters in the north-west block, {{and a similar}} new stair in the south-east block. Ceilings in the lower level are <b>fibrous</b> <b>plaster</b> or masonite with cover strips.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Fibrous</b> <b>plaster</b> {{is given}} by plasterers the suggestive name [...] "stick and rag", {{and this is a}} rough {{description}} of the material, for it is a fibrous composed of plaster laid upon a backing of canvas stretched on wood. It is much used for moldings, circular and enriched casings to columns and girders and ornamental work, which is worked in the shop and fixed in position.|$|E
50|$|Frank Tory and Sons were an English family firm of Sheffield based {{architectural}} sculptors {{whose work}} enhances {{some of the}} city’s finest late 19th century and early 20th century buildings. Apart from stone carving the family also worked in wood, marble, bronze and <b>fibrous</b> <b>plaster.</b> The firm operated from the early 1880s until the 1950s and consisted of Frank Tory and his twin sons Alfred Herbert and William Frank.|$|E
50|$|The {{auditorium}} is {{a simple}} rectangular space; the walls being lined with timber and <b>fibrous</b> <b>plaster</b> sheeting. The ceiling is unlined and laminated timber struts brace the walls. The floor is raked {{and there are several}} louvred timber windows along the walls to provide ventilation. Towards the rear of the building, there are sections of latticework under the eaves. The interior lining now covers this provision for ventilation.|$|E
50|$|The {{ventilation}} of {{the building}} consisted of special ventilators positioned in both the interior and exterior {{of the building}}. The interior walls had vents made out of <b>fibrous</b> <b>plaster</b> and situated between the picture rail and the ceiling whereas the exterior ones were made of louvred galvanized iron. Cornice and base mouldings were kept to a minimal in an endeavour to avoid dust being carried through the ventilation system.|$|E
50|$|The modern {{use of this}} {{material}} {{may be said to}} have started then, but the use of <b>fibrous</b> <b>plaster</b> was known and practiced by the Egyptians long before the Christian era; for ancient coffins and mummies still preserved prove that linen stiffened with plaster was used for decorating coffins and making masks. Cennino Cennini, writing in 1437, says that fine linen soaked in glue and plaster and laid on wood was used for forming grounds for painting.|$|E
5000|$|Barnes {{was born}} in Islington, Middlesex, the eldest son of John William Barnes (1854-1909), a builder and plasterer, and his wife Ann Eliza Barnes, née May ( [...] -1956). Around 1890 the family {{migrated}} to Adelaide, where his father and William Neate (1848-1932) set up in business in Flinders Street as Barnes & Neate, modellers and plasterers. They specialised in <b>fibrous</b> <b>plaster</b> and pressed cement, and their work {{is evident in the}} Steamship building, the Art Gallery and Savings Bank, to name a few.|$|E
5000|$|Angled, {{ornamental}} balconies {{are located}} {{either side of}} the proscenium. On the upper level these feature a balustrade, arches and [...] "barley sugar" [...] columns, at lower level there are arched niches alternating with more columns. All of these areas are decorated with moulded <b>fibrous</b> <b>plaster</b> decoration including egg and dart moulding and scrolls of leaves. These balcony areas have a colour scheme of pale green, white and a pale sandstone colour with touches of metallic bronze which is also incorporated into parts of the proscenium.|$|E
50|$|The Dress Circle is {{supported}} on a riveted truss that spans 70 feet supported {{at the side}} isles by steel stanchions and provides an uninterrupted view of the stage. Six cantilevered girders extend 24 feet beyond {{the line of the}} truss and connecting girders slope back from it to the rear wall of the auditorium. This steel frame carries a timber floor and Craftex ceilings below, with the <b>fibrous</b> <b>plaster</b> covering the beams and two stanchions. The steel construction was notable at the time and reported on in the October 1934 edition of Building.|$|E
50|$|The {{upper floors}} of the Edward Street {{building}} contain the main hall. An ornate <b>fibrous</b> <b>plaster</b> vaulted ceiling supported on timber trusses spans the hall and the back wall contains another frieze by the Daphne Mayo. The upper gallery contains a barber shop, turkish baths, card room, reception rooms and library. The dining hall located on the upper {{floors of the}} Queen Street building has a 10.7 m high ceiling and walls decorated in grey and white marble. This space features wall paintings by local artists. The arcade {{on the ground floor}} dates from the 1990 refurbishment.|$|E
50|$|The {{inclined}} face of {{the roof}} soffits are clad in flat <b>fibrous</b> <b>plaster</b> sheeting ornamented with regularly spaced cover strips painted a contrasting colour. The top fascia is made from horizontal tongue-and-groove v-jointed boards. The rear wall of the hall is flat brickwork with no ornamentation. Concrete steps lead from the south-west corner down to a sunken area behind the building, overlooked by louvred windows and three doors from the former supper room below the stage. Timber staircases {{at either end of}} this area lead {{to the rear of the}} stage and to a small toilet block at the northern end.|$|E
50|$|Extensive {{alterations}} to {{the building}} in 1927-28 saw the demolition of the original back wall {{and the addition of}} a reinforced concrete and steel extension. At the same time the interior of the first floor was remodelled. A panelled, arched ceiling to the rear half of this floor is decorated in modelled <b>fibrous</b> <b>plaster</b> with angels, harps and Australian floral motifs in gold relief. The walls are panelled in silky oak; the floor is hardwood. Lead light panels in the ceiling and one end wall depict the four counties of Ireland and the Queensland coat of arms, while other leadlight windows are located in the north- east side wall.|$|E
50|$|The facade to Hay St had a {{symbolic}} skyscraper effect. There were tall strips of windows; the centre third {{was taller than}} and projected from the remainder. Stepping from the centre of this central bay was the vertical sign which projected above the roof and curved back and down into the modern ziggurat roof form. The auditorium was rather simple in <b>fibrous</b> <b>plaster,</b> striated lines and straight ceiling coves accentuated the long dimension of the room. The slightly lower sections {{each side of the}} ceiling, as well as incorporating indirect lighting coves to wash light across upper ceiling levels and down the walls, probably boxed in the airconditioning ducts.|$|E
50|$|The {{main bar}} {{is a large}} open room with three {{entrance}} doors, one each to Mill and Front streets and one at the truncated corner. Large windows provide views to the surrounding streetscape. Having undergone many alterations, the bar layout, furniture and finishes are not early or original {{and do not have}} cultural heritage significance. At {{the southern end of the}} room there is evidence of the location of early internal walls, and an early ceiling with two <b>fibrous</b> <b>plaster</b> ceiling roses remains. A doorway at the southern end of the bar area connects through to the adjacent shop. Doors in the eastern wall lead to the rear passageway and to the private bar.|$|E
5000|$|Original skirtings, architraves, French {{doors and}} some {{cornices}} have survived and are of painted timber in simple design. All {{of the original}} ceilings in the ground floor rooms {{appear to have been}} replaced, some with vee-jointed tongue and groove boards and the drawing room with art-deco style <b>fibrous</b> <b>plaster</b> [...] ( [...] See note below re the upper floor ceilings) Where not covered by wall-to-wall vinyl and carpet, it is evident that some of the earlier Hoop Pine floors have been replaced with narrow-width hardwood and the drawing room floor was concreted! A substantial amount of the early glass in the doors and windows has been replaced with figured obscure [...] "arctic" [...] glass probably [...]|$|E
5000|$|Empire Theatre Ltd advertised proudly {{that most}} of the {{contractors}} and materials were of local (Brisbane and Toowoomba) origin. The decorative <b>fibrous</b> <b>plaster</b> work was carried out by Brisbane's Stucoid Modelling Co., terrazzo work by Melocco Brothers of Brisbane, and cork flooring and tiling supplied by the Decorative Tile Co., Brisbane. Joinery and furnishings were supplied by Toowoomba firms. Cemuro art stucco, a new product to Queensland, was supplied by Dyne & Co. of Brisbane. Billed as the [...] "theatre supreme", the new Empire Theatre opened on 27 November 1933. It was tied into the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer exhibition network in Australia, screening in the 1930s the films of Greta Garbo, Clark Gable, Jean Harlow, Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy, Laurel and Hardy, and the Flash Gordon serials.|$|E
5000|$|The 2,000 seater theatre {{opened on}} 10 December 1900 with the play [...] "Sign of the Cross," [...] {{performed}} by William Greet's company, with Edward Vincent as the Prefect and Virginia Buckle as the Christian girl Mercia. The {{front of the}} theatre was described as [...] "red terra-cotta, divided by Ionic pilasters into five bays" [...] and the foyer was described as [...] "a hall 34 feet long and 18 feet wide, with marble mosaic floor, walls panelled in <b>fibrous</b> <b>plaster,</b> and hand-painted ceiling". The dimensions of the stage were also recorded as [...] "Its width is 74 feet, {{the distance from the}} curtain line to the back wall is 40 feet, the distance from stage to grid is 50 feet, and the proscenium opening is 30 feet in width.|$|E
5000|$|The {{proscenium}} {{is located}} at the eastern end of the auditorium and has a sunken backstage area behind. The proscenium is ornately decorated, styled to give the appearance that {{it is part of the}} exterior of a building and is constructed of <b>fibrous</b> <b>plaster.</b> It has faceted columns to either side and is topped with a Spanish-style terracotta tiled roof supported on carved [...] "corbels" [...] with rosettes in between. The columns are painted in vibrant tones of orange, blue, red and yellow and decorated with moulded scrolls of foliage, flowers and urns. A multi-coloured cartouche is located in the centre of the proscenium arch and a velvet valance with gold fringing with the word [...] "Plaza" [...] in gold lettering in the centre hangs within the arch.|$|E
50|$|The office {{consists}} of a small entry foyer with reception desk, three offices, a kitchen, and a strong room. Rooms have vinyl tile floors, sheet wall linings with timber skirtings, picture rails and architraves, and the ceiling is <b>fibrous</b> <b>plaster</b> sheets with moulded plaster cornices. The strong room has a concrete floor and rendered concrete walls and ceiling. The rooms retain original built-in cupboards with original hardware, some original light fixtures and light switching plates, and the strong room retains original locks and timber shelving. Internal doors are timber with original hardware. Some windows have internal wind deflecting glass shields at sill level and some partitions have ribbed glass windows at a high level. The foyer retains the original timber veneer reception desk {{in front of a}} timber veneer partition with ribbed glazing. The kitchen retains original joinery including cabinet handles, sink and tapware, benchtop, and green splashback tiles.|$|E
50|$|The police residences are a pair {{of brick}} {{bungalows}} prominently sited fronting Brisbane Street. They have hipped roofs; that of the Inspector's Residence being clad in corrugated iron {{and that of the}} keeper's residence in corrugated fibrous cement sheeting. Each has a projecting gabled room to the front with a bay window under a strongly defined gable end. Although such gables are a feature of this style, they visually echo the triangular pediment of the police station which they serve. The front entrance is from a small verandah with timber balustrading which is approached by low timber steps. The windows are paired casements. The houses are not identical although similar in form, and the floor plans differ, presumably to suit the use of the first tenants. The interiors still reflect the era in which they were built, although the inspector's house has been fitted out as an office. Both houses have hardwood floors, plastered walls and <b>fibrous</b> <b>plaster</b> ceilings with decorative mouldings.|$|E
50|$|He {{was born}} in Carlton and held a variety of jobs {{including}} brass foundry worker, shipping office clerk and plasterer. In 1930 he joined the Communist Party of Australia, but he was expelled in 1933 and subsequently beaten for criticising the party. He then joined the Australian Labor Party and served on its state executive from 1938 to 1955 (president from 1943 to 1944). He was also federal president of the ALP from 1953 to 1954. He was secretary of the <b>Fibrous</b> <b>Plaster</b> and Plaster Workers' Union (FPPWU) from 1935 to 1947, president of the Trades Hall Council in 1938, and a delegate to the Australian Council of Trade Unions. Until 1954, he {{was associated with the}} hardline anti-communist Industrial Groups. He was elected to the Victorian Legislative Assembly in 1955 as the member for Carlton, transferring to Fitzroy in 1958. He was also president of the FPPWU from 1955 to 1978. From 1958 to 1967 he was Deputy Leader of the Opposition. He moved to the new seat of Sunshine in 1967, and retired in 1973. Lovegrove died at East Melbourne in 1979.|$|E
