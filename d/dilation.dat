5|$|Special {{relativity}} {{has many}} counterintuitive and experimentally verified implications. These include the equivalence of mass and energy , length contraction (moving objects shorten), and time <b>dilation</b> (moving clocks run more slowly). The factorγ by which lengths contract and times dilate {{is known as}} the Lorentz factor and is given by , where v is the speed of the object. The difference of γ from 1 is negligible for speeds much slower thanc, such as most everyday speeds—in which case special relativity is closely approximated by Galilean relativity—but it increases at relativistic speeds and diverges to infinity as v approaches c. For example, a time <b>dilation</b> factor of γ=2 occurs at a relative velocity of 86.6% of the speed of light (v=.866c). Similarly, a time <b>dilation</b> factor of γ=10 occurs at v=99.5%c.|$|E

Refinable splines, {{such as the}} well-known B-splines, {{play a key role}} in computer aided geometric design.

40|$|Abstract. The wavelet {{dimension}} {{function for}} arbitrary real dila-tions is defined {{and used to}} address several questions involving the existence of MRA wavelets and well-localized wavelets for irrational <b>dilations.</b> The theory of quasi-affine frames for rational <b>dilations</b> {{and the existence of}} non-MSF wavelets for certain irrational <b>dilations</b> {{play an important role in}} this development. Expansive <b>dilations</b> admitting non-MSF wavelets are characterized, and an example of a wavelet with respect to a non-expansive matrix is given. The wavelet dimension function, which is sometimes referred to as the multiplicity function, is an important subject in the theory of wavelets that has been extensively studied by a number of authors, e. g., [2, 4, 8, 20]. However, up to the present time, the wavelet dimension function has bee...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: We {{hypothesized}} that simultaneous presence of obesity and hypertension activates adaptive vascular mechanisms affecting <b>dilations</b> of human coronary arterioles. METHODS AND RESULTS: Agonist-induced <b>dilations</b> were assessed in isolated pressurized coronary arterioles from patients (n= 38) who underwent cardiac surgery. Among normotensives {{we found that}} <b>dilations</b> to bradykinin (BK) and the NO-donor, sodium-nitroprusside (SNP) were reduced in obese subjects (BK, 10 (- 7) mol/L, lean: 90 +/- 4 %, obese: 64 +/- 7 %; SNP, 10 (- 6) mol/L, lean: 89 +/- 7 %, obese: 76 +/- 5 %). However, among hypertensives, both BK- and SNP-induced <b>dilations</b> were significantly enhanced in obese patients, when compared with lean individuals (BK, lean: 71 +/- 7 %, obese: 85 +/- 3 %; SNP, lean: 60 +/- 6 %, obese: 83 +/- 2 %). Correspondingly, in hypertensive patients, but not in those of normotensives, a positive correlation was found between body mass index (BMI) and BK-induced (P= 0. 036, r= 0. 46), and also SNP-evoked (P= 0. 031, r= 0. 44) coronary <b>dilations.</b> Moreover, in additional 55 hypertensive patients flow-mediated (FMD) and nitroglycerin (NTG) -induced <b>dilations</b> of the brachial artery were assessed. In obese hypertensive individuals, FMD- and NTG-induced <b>dilations</b> were greater (FMD: 6. 2 +/- 0. 7 %, NTG: 17. 2 +/- 0. 9 %), than in lean hypertensive patients (FMD: 3. 7 +/- 0. 6 %, NTG: 13. 6 +/- 1. 1 %). Correspondingly, FMD- and NTG-induced <b>dilations</b> were positively correlated with BMI (P= 0. 020, r= 0. 31 and P= 0. 033, r= 0. 29, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: These findings {{are the first to}} suggest that obesity may lead to activation of adaptive vascular mechanisms to enhance the dilator function of coronary and peripheral arterial vessels in hypertensive patients...|$|R
40|$|We {{tested the}} {{hypothesis}} that TREK- 1, a two-pore domain K channel, is involved with <b>dilations</b> in arteries. Because there are no selective activators or inhibitors of TREK- 1, we generated a mouse line deficient in TREK- 1. Endothelium-mediated <b>dilations</b> were not different in arteries from wild-type (WT) and TREK- 1 knockout (KO) mice. This includes <b>dilations</b> of the middle cerebral artery to ATP, <b>dilations</b> of the basilar artery to ACh, and relaxations of the aorta to carbachol, a cholinergic agonist. The nitric oxide (NO) and endothelium-dependent hyperpolarizing factor components of ATP <b>dilations</b> were identical in the middle cerebral arteries of WT and TREK- 1 KO mice. Furthermore, the NO and cyclooxygenase-dependent components were identical in the basilar arteries of the different genotypes. <b>Dilations</b> of the basilar artery to α-linolenic acid, an activator of TREK- 1, were not affected {{by the absence of}} TREK- 1. Whole cell currents recorded using patch-clamp techniques were similar in cerebrovascular smooth muscle cells (CVSMCs) from WT and TREK- 1 KO mice. α-linolenic acid or arachidonic acid increased whole cell currents in CVSMCs from both WT and TREK- 1 KO mice. The selective blockers of large-conductance Ca-activated K channels, penitrem A and iberiotoxin, blocked the increased currents elicited by either α-linolenic or arachidonic acid. In summary, <b>dilations</b> were similar in arteries from WT and TREK- 1 KO mice. There was no sign of TREK- 1 -like currents in CVSMCs from WT mice, and there were no major differences in currents between the genotypes. We conclude that regulation of arterial diameter is not altered in mice lacking TREK- 1...|$|R

5|$|The eyes of {{pinnipeds}} {{are relatively}} large for {{their size and}} are positioned {{near the front of}} the head. One exception is the walrus, whose smaller eyes are located on the sides of its head. This is because it feeds on immobile bottom dwelling mollusks and hence does not need acute vision. A seal's eye is adapted for seeing both underwater and in air. The lens is mostly spherical, and much of the retina is equidistant from the lens center. The cornea has a flattened center where refraction is nearly equal in both water and air. Pinnipeds also have very muscular and vascularized irises. The well-developed dilator muscle gives the animals a great range in pupil <b>dilation.</b> When contracted, the pupil is typically pear-shaped, although the bearded seal's is more diagonal. In species that live in shallow water, such as harbor seals and California sea lions, <b>dilation</b> varies little, while the deep-diving elephant seals have much greater variation.|$|E

40|$|The {{impact of}} obesity on nitric oxide (NO) -mediated {{coronary}} microvascular responses is poorly understood. Thus NO-mediated vasomotor responses were investigated in pressurized coronary arterioles (approximately 100 microm) isolated from lean (on normal diet) and obese (fed with 60 % of saturated fat) rats. We found that <b>dilations</b> to acetylcholine (ACh) {{were not significantly}} different in obese and lean rats (lean, 83 +/- 4 %; and obese, 85 +/- 3 % at 1 microM), yet the inhibition of NO synthesis with N(omega) -nitro-l-arginine methyl ester reduced ACh-induced <b>dilations</b> only in vessels of lean controls. The presence of the soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) inhibitor oxadiazolo-quinoxaline (ODQ) elicited a similar reduction in ACh-induced <b>dilations</b> in the two groups of vessels (lean, 60 +/- 11 %; and obese, 57 +/- 3 %). <b>Dilations</b> to NO donors, sodium nitroprusside (SNP), and diethylenetriamine (DETA) -NONOate were enhanced in coronary arterioles of obese compared with lean control rats (lean, 63 +/- 6 % and 51 +/- 5 %; and obese, 78 +/- 5 % and 70 +/- 5 %, respectively, at 1 microM), whereas <b>dilations</b> to 8 -bromo-cGMP were not different in the two groups. In the presence of ODQ, both SNP and DETA-NONOate-induced <b>dilations</b> were reduced to a similar level in lean and obese rats. Moreover, SNP-stimulated cGMP immunoreactivity in coronary arterioles and also cGMP levels in carotid arteries were enhanced in obese rats, whereas the protein expression of endothelial NOS and the sGC beta 1 -subunit were not different in the two groups. Collectively, these findings suggest that in coronary arterioles of obese rats, the increased activity of sGC leads to an enhanced sensitivity to NO, which may contribute to the maintenance of NO-mediated <b>dilations</b> and coronary perfusion in obesity...|$|R
