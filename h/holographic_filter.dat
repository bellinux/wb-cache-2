40|$|An {{available}} and low-cost method {{for the production}} of computer-generated phase holograms is presented. Firstly, binary masks are produced by a high-resolution graphic device. The factors that affect the fidelity of the holograms are analyzed. Secondly, enhanced light efficiency is obtained in copies made on holographic emulsions by bleaching them. The reproduction of low spatial frequencies, the usual ones with graphic devices, has been studied using diffraction gratings. We propose the super-Gaussian function to simulate the grating profile. The results obtained with that function present good agreement with the experimental results. The use of this model has enabled us to design a method that has been used to obtain the phase modulation in the bleached emulsion as a function of exposure. Through this study the bleached emulsion has been validated as a good phase material for low spatial frequencies, and has been applied {{for the production of}} optical correlation filters.

40|$|<b>Holographic</b> color <b>filters</b> for LCDs are {{discussed}} in this thesis. Transmission and reflection <b>holographic</b> color <b>filters</b> have been experimentally fabricated and charac-terized. Because of their high efficiency (> 90 %) and excellent color purity, holo-graphic color filters demonstrate superior optical performance in comparison to currently utilized dyed color filters whose efficiencies are typically {{on the order of}} 25 percent. The <b>holographic</b> color <b>filters</b> were fabricated by the simple interference of two plane-wave beams from an argon-ion laser in holographic recording materials. Tri-color RGB reflection and transmission color filters were obtained by selectively varying the relative angle between the two write beams or by changing the wavelength of the laser beams. The holographic recording material used in all the experiments was a photopolymer by DuPont which does not require any post-exposure wet-developing thereby minimizing film shrinkage and expansion which can cause a color shift. In our experiments, transmission and reflection color filters were fabricated with extremely high efficiencies (98 % for transmission color filters, 94 % for reflection color filters), and excellent color purities (> 98 % for blue and red colors,> 82 % for green color filters). The viewing angles for these filters were about 1. 5 degrees and 15 degrees for transmission type and reflection type color filters respectively. A tech-nique of recording multiple gratings was utilized to increase the viewing angle. The center wavelengths of RGB three primary colors of the color filters were designed to match the response function of human eye and could be custom tailored {{for a wide variety of}} applications. The efficiency of the <b>holographic</b> color <b>filters</b> can be selected by changing the intensity ratio of the two write beams, exposure energy, or thickness of the holographic recording material.

40|$|A {{variety of}} <b>holographic</b> <b>filters</b> formed in phenanthrenquinone-doped poly(methyl methacrylate) (PQ/PMMA) {{for use as}} passive filters in DWDM and OCDMA have been demonstrated. Low cost PQ/PMMA filters can be {{fabricated}} with narrow spectral transmittance (< 0. 2 nm) and high side-lobe suppression (- 30 dB) properties in the 1550 nm wavelength range. However, the thermal stability of filters formed in PQ/PMMA must be understood {{in order to use}} them in optical communication systems. In addition, an understanding of the thermal dependence of PQ/PMMA filters can provide a path to tunable devices that can significantly increase the flexibility of multiplexing systems allowing dynamic functions such as active routing for switched network topologies. This thesis investigates the temperature dependence of edge-illuminated <b>holographic</b> <b>filters</b> formed in phenanthrenquinone-doped poly(methyl methacrylate) (PQ/PMMA) operating at 1550 nm. The fabrication and recording processes and the operation principles of the filters are detailed. The thermally induced change to the refractive index and volume can be used to select the wavelength filtered by the grating. The temperature can be varied over a range of 15 °C without introducing noticeable hysteresis effects. The wavelength can be tuned at a rate of 0. 03 nm/°C over this temperature range. A model for the temperature tuning effect is presented and compared to experimental results. A procedure to incorporate silicon dioxide nanoparticles as secondary doping agent is also described.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} {{the use of}} <b>holographic</b> <b>filters</b> in solar spectrum splitting applications. Photovoltaic (PV) systems utilizing spectrum splitting have higher theoretical conversion efficiency than single bandgap cell modules. Dichroic band-rejection filters {{have been used for}} spectrum splitting applications with some success however these filters are limited to spectral control at fixed reflection angles. Reflection <b>holographic</b> <b>filters</b> are fabricated by recording interference pattern of two coherent beams at arbitrary construction angles. This feature can be used to control the angles over which spectral selectivity is obtained. In addition focusing wavefronts {{can also be used to}} increase functionality in the filter. Holograms fabricated in dichromated gelatin (DCG) have the benefit of light weight, low scattering and absorption losses. In addition, reflection holograms recorded in the Lippmann configuration have been shown to produce strong chirping as a result of wet processing. Chirping broadens the filter rejection bandwidth both spectrally and angularly. It can be tuned to achieve spectral bandwidth suitable for spectrum splitting applications. We explore different DCG film fabrication and processing parameters to improve the optical performance of the filter. The diffraction efficiency bandwidth and scattering losses are optimized by changing the exposure energy, isopropanol dehydration bath temperature and hardening bath duration. A holographic spectrum-splitting PV module is proposed with Gallium Arsenide (GaAs) and silicon (Si) PV cells with efficiency of 25. 1 % and 19. 7 % respectively.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a segmented parabolic concentrator employing holographic spectral filters that provide focusing and spectral bandwidth separation capability to the system. Strips of low band gap silicon photovoltaic (PV) cells are formed into a parabolic surface {{as shown by}} Holman et. al. [1]. The surface of the PV segments is covered with holographic elements formed in dichromated gelatin. The holographic elements are designed to transmit longer wavelengths to silicon cells, and to reflect short wavelength light towards a secondary collector where high-bandgap PV cells are mounted. The system can be optimized for different combinations of diffuse and direct solar illumination conditions for particular geographical locations by controlling the concentration ratio and filtering properties of the holographic elements. In addition, the reflectivity of the back contact of the silicon cells is used to increase the optical path length and light trapping. This potentially allows the use of thin film silicon for the low bandgap PV cell material. The optical design combines the focusing properties of the parabolic concentrator and the holographic element to control the concentration ratio and uniformity of the spectral distribution at the high bandgap cell location. The presentation concludes with a comparison of different spectrum splitting <b>holographic</b> <b>filter</b> materials for this application...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the theoretical and experimental investigation of volume holography operated with broadband/polychromatic light sources, i. e., in both continuous-wave (linear) and femtosecond-pulse (nonlinear) regimes. The first chapter reviews {{the concept of}} volume holography and provides a tacit introduction to some basic properties of volume holograms and compares the operation of holograms in the spatial and temporal domains, preparing the readers for later chapters. The second chapter introduces a powerful theoretical tool {{for the analysis of}} volume holograms in the reflection geometry: the matrix formulation, laying the foundation for the application of holographic gratings utilized as WDM filters. The third chapter takes into consideration the effects of the practically inevitable finite beam-widths. By means of Fourier decomposition, the deviation of the filtering properties of volume holographic gratings from the ideal plane-wave case can be satisfactorily explained and predicted. Experiments and simulations are performed and compared to confirm the validity of the theory. Volume holographic gratings in the reflection geometry serve as excellent WDM filters for telecommunication purposes thanks to their low cross-talk and readily engineered filtering properties. The theoretical design and experimental realization of athermal holographic filters are presented in the fourth chapter. By incorporating a passive, thermally actuated MEMS mirror, the temperature dependence of the Bragg wavelength of a <b>holographic</b> <b>filter</b> can be compensated. The analysis of holographic gratings in the 90 degree geometry requires a two dimensional theory. The relevant boundary conditions give rise to some peculiar behaviors in this configuration. Theory, simulations and some experimental results of the 90 -degree holography are presented in chapter five. The sixth chapter delves into the subject of instantaneous Kerr index grating established by two intense, interfering femtosecond (pump) pulses at 388 nm owing to the omnipresent third-order nonlinearity. The coupled-mode equations describing the incident and diffracted (probe) pulses at 776 nm are written down; the solution is experimentally corroborated. It is further demonstrated that the temporal resolution in such a holographic pump-probe configuration does not degrade appreciably as the angular separation between pump pulses increases. Chapter seven investigates the nonlinear absorption processes in lithium niobate crystals with femtosecond pulses. The model of two-photon absorption well explains and anticipates the transmission coefficients of single pulses over a wide range of intensity. Collinear pump-probe transmission experiments are then carried out to look into the nonlinear absorption suffered by the probe pulse at 776 nm owing to the pump pulse at 388 nm; the dependence of the probe pulse transmission coefficient on the time delay between pump and probe pulses is characterized by a dip and a long-lasting plateau, which are attributed, respectively, to direct two-photon transitions involving pump and probe photons and the existence of free carriers. Building on the experimental experience and theoretical understanding of the previous two chapters, the results of holographic pump-probe experiments in lithium niobate crystals are presented in the final chapter. The behavior is much more complicated because it encompasses all phenomena explored in the two preceding chapters, i. e., both the real and imaginary parts of the third-order susceptibility come into play in the instantaneous material response; furthermore, another mixed grating due to excited charge carriers exists long after the pump pulses pass through. Valuable information on the grating formation process is obtained thanks to the sub-picosecond temporal resolution of such configurations...|$|E

Permanent refractive-index {{gratings}} in waveguide {{devices are}} of consid-erable interest for optical communication systems that {{make use of}} the high spec-tral selectivity of <b>holographic</b> <b>filters,</b> e. g., dense wavelength division multiplexing (DWDM) or narrow-bandwidth mirrors for integrated waveguide lasers in LiNbO 3. Other possible applications include grating couplers and optical sensors. In this con-tribution we investigate such <b>holographic</b> wavelength <b>filters</b> in Fe- and Cu-doped LiNbO 3 channel waveguides. Permanent refractive-index gratings are generated by thermal fixing of holograms in the waveguides. The samples are fabricated by suc-cessive in-diffusion of Ti stripes and thin layers of either Fe or Cu. After high temperature recording with green light, refractive-index changes up to ∆n ≈ 10 − 4 for infrared light (1. 55 µm) are obtained, resulting in a reflection efficiency well above 99 % for a 15 mm-long grating. Several gratings for different wavelengths can be superimposed in the same sample, which may enable more complex filters, laser mirrors or optical sensors. By changing the sample temperature the reflection wave-length can be tuned by thermal expansion of the grating, and wavelength filters can be switched on and off by applying moderate voltages using the electrooptic effect. Furthermore, we report on a new thermal fixing mechanism that does not need any additional development by homogeneous light illumination and therefore does not suffer from the non-vanishing dark conductivity of the material. ...|$|R

Attributes of the TBFS include rapid tunability of the pass band over a wide wavelength range and high transmission efficiency. The TBFS is based on a unique integration of two pairs of broadband Raman reflection <b>holographic</b> <b>filters</b> with two rotating spherical lenses. In experiments, a prototype of the TBFS, was shown to be capable of spectral sampling of images in the visible range over a 200 nm spectral range with a spectral resolution of 30 nm. The figure depicts the optical layout of a prototype of the TBFS as part of a laboratory multispectral imaging system for the spectral sampling of color test images in two orthogonal polarizations. Each pair of broadband Raman reflection <b>holographic</b> <b>filters</b> is mounted at an equatorial plane between two halves of a spherical lens. The two filters in each pair are characterized by steep spectral slopes (equivalently, narrow spectral edges), no ripple or side lobes in their pass bands, and a few nanometers of non-overlapping wavelength range between their pass bands. Each spherical lens and thus the filter pair within it is rotated in order to rapidly tune its pass band. The rotations of are effected by electronically controlled, programmable, high-precision rotation stages. The rotations are coordinated by electronic circuits operating under overall supervision of a personal computer in order to obtain the desired variation of the overall pass bands with time. Embedding the filters inside the spherical lenses increases the range of the hologram incidence angles, making it possible to continuously tune the pass and stop bands of the filters over a wider wavelength range. In addition, each spherical lens also serves as part of the imaging optics: The telephoto lens focuses incoming light to a field stop that is also a focal point of each spherical lens. A correcting lens in front of the field stop compensates for the spherical aberration of the spherical lenses. The front surface of each spherical lens collimates the light coming from the field stop.
