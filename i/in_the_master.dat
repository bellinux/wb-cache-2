His first theatre roles {{as part of the}} National Youth Theatre were Thomas Becket in Murder in the Cathedral and Bassoon <b>in</b> <b>The</b> <b>Master</b> and Margarita. His role in the latter earned him an agent and his first professional jobs, Fresh Kills and On the Shore of the Wide World. His new professional roles led him to seek an agreement with his university so that he could graduate without attending lectures in his final year.|$|E
5|$|Ants {{also are}} quite popular {{inspiration}} for many science-fiction insectoids, {{such as the}} Formics of Ender's Game, the Bugs of Starship Troopers, the giant ants in the films Them! and Empire of the Ants, Marvel Comics' super hero Ant-Man, and ants mutated into super-intelligence in Phase IV. In computer strategy games, ant-based species often benefit from increased production rates due to their single-minded focus, such as the Klackons <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Master</b> of Orion series of games or the ChCht in Deadlock II. These characters are often credited with a hive mind, a common misconception about ant colonies.|$|E
5|$|Centaur entered {{operation}} as {{a hospital}} ship on 12 March 1943. The {{early stages of}} Centaur's first voyage as a hospital ship were test and transport runs; the initial run from Melbourne to Sydney resulted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Master,</b> Chief Engineer, and Chief Medical Officer composing {{a long list of}} defects requiring attention. Following repairs, she conducted a test run, transporting wounded servicemen from Townsville to Brisbane to ensure that she was capable of fulfilling the role of a medical vessel. Centaur was then tasked with delivering medical personnel to Port Moresby, New Guinea, and returning to Brisbane with Australian and American wounded along with a small number of wounded Japanese prisoners of war.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to running the museum, Nettie {{had a large}} role in running the Master Building as a whole; however, the exact division of responsibilities between Nettie and her husband is unclear. She was secretary of the corporation, although this may have been a nominal position as Louis and his lawyer prepared most of the corporation's correspondence and its filings. She also probably helped her husband decide to provide more than one million dollars toward achieving the Roeriches' spiritual and cultural ambitions. She met with the Roeriches and their other supporters in making plans for the Roerich Museum, Master Institute, Corona Mundi, and the other organizations housed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Master</b> Building. She was active as president of the Roerich Society and, after its demise, directed the Riverside Museum for many years.|$|E

5|$|The arcade {{version of}} Wonder Boy in Monster Land amassed {{moderate}} sales, and the Master System version received overall positive reviews {{in all aspects}} and has been highly {{regarded as one of}} the better titles <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Master</b> System library. Reviews praised the game for its colorful graphics, smooth controls, gameplay, and replay value. Other ports received mixed reception: criticisms included very slow multi-load times on the home computer versions, sub-quality sound, and smaller play areas.

5|$|The present ch√¢teau, {{designed}} on {{a triangular}} plan, has five conical towers and a watchtower capped by slate roofs. Archaeologists have uncovered {{traces of the}} older buildings on the site {{dating back to the}} 11th century. The architect Frantz Jourdain renovated the interior of the 14th century tower as a library for the Rochefoucault family in 1893. The Hunt of the Unicorn tapestries of the building, which hung <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>master</b> bedroom, were rediscovered in 1850; they were later sold to John D. Rockefeller, Jr. in 1923.|$|E
5|$|Allgame gave {{positive}} {{reviews of}} the game. It said that game includes everything from hidden items, simplistic gameplay, fun and replay value, and basic but good-looking graphics. Defunct Games called Wonder Boy in Monster Land the most challenging game in the Wonder Boy series, noting the lack of passwords or continues <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Master</b> System version, the relatively few chances to earn extra lives, and a time limit. The review said {{that the ability to}} earn gold and upgrade equipment which are laid out in the status screen tremendously adds to the replay value. It praised the responsive, though sometimes not precise, controls and the tight hit detection. Moreover, it said that the graphics were colorful and that it complemented the music and its simplistic sound effects well. Overall, the review said that the game is recommended for Master System and platforming fans alike.|$|E

5|$|Drawn to theater as a teenager, Hoffman studied acting at New York University's Tisch School of the Arts. He {{began his}} screen career in a 1991 episode of Law & Order {{and started to}} appear in films in 1992. He gained {{recognition}} for his supporting work, notably in Boogie Nights (1997), Happiness (1998), Patch Adams (1998), The Big Lebowski (1998), Magnolia (1999), The Talented Mr. Ripley (1999), Almost Famous (2000), Punch-Drunk Love (2002), and Along Came Polly (2004). He began to occasionally play leading roles, and for his portrayal of the author Truman Capote in Capote (2005), won multiple accolades including the Academy Award for Best Actor. Hoffman's profile continued to grow, and he received three more Oscar nominations for his supporting work as a brutally frank CIA officer in Charlie Wilson's War (2007), a priest accused of pedophilia in Doubt (2008), and the charismatic leader of a Scientology-type movement <b>in</b> <b>The</b> <b>Master</b> (2012).|$|E
5|$|Although English {{furniture}} derives so extensively {{from foreign}} and especially French and Italian models, the earlier forms of English chairs owed but little to exotic influences. This was especially the case {{down to the}} end of the Tudor period, after which France began to set her mark upon the British chair. The squat variety, with heavy and sombre back, carved like a piece of panelling, gave place to a taller, more slender, and more elegant form, in which the framework only was carved, and attempts were made at ornament in new directions. The stretcher especially offered opportunities which were not lost upon the cabinet-makers of the Restoration. From a mere uncompromising cross-bar intended to strengthen the construction it blossomed, almost suddenly, into an elaborate scroll-work or an exceedingly graceful semicircular ornament connecting all four legs, with a vase-shaped knob in the centre. The arms and legs of chairs of this period were scrolled, the splats of the back often showing a rich arrangement of spirals and scrolls. This most decorative of all types appears to have been popularized in England by the cavaliers who had been in exile with Charles II, and had become familiar with it in the north-western parts of the European continent. During the reign of William III and Mary II these charming forms degenerated into something much stiffer and more rectangular, with a solid, more or less fiddle-shaped splat and a cabriole leg with pad feet. The more ornamental examples had cane seats and ill-proportioned cane backs. From these forms was gradually developed the Chippendale chair, with its elaborately interlaced back, its graceful arms and square or cabriole legs, the latter terminating in the claw and ball or the pad foot. George Hepplewhite, Thomas Sheraton and Robert Adam all aimed at lightening the chair, which, even <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>master</b> hands of Thomas Chippendale, remained comparatively heavy. The endeavour succeeded, and the modern chair is everywhere comparatively slight.|$|E

25|$|Transmissions {{normally}} involve two shift registers of some given word size, such {{as eight}} bits, one <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>master</b> {{and one in}} the slave; they are connected in a virtual ring topology. Data is usually shifted out with the most-significant bit first, while shifting a new least-significant bit into the same register. At the same time, Data from the counterpart is shifted into the least-significant bit register. After the register bits have been shifted out and <b>in,</b> <b>the</b> <b>master</b> and slave have exchanged register values. If more data needs to be exchanged, the shift registers are reloaded and the process repeats. Transmission may continue for any number of clock cycles. When complete, the master stops toggling the clock signal, and typically deselects the slave.|$|E
