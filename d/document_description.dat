40|$|Abstract) We {{consider}} a publish/subscribe system for digital libraries which continuously evaluates queries {{over a large}} repository containing <b>document</b> <b>descriptions.</b> The subscriptions, the query expressions and the <b>document</b> <b>descriptions,</b> all rely on a taxonomy that is a hierarchically organized set of keywords, or terms. The digital library supports insertion, update and removal of a document. Each of these operations {{is seen as an}} event that must be notified only to those users whose subscriptions match the <b>document’s</b> <b>description.</b> In this paper, we present a novel method of processing such keyword queries. Our method is based on Binary Decision Diagram (BDD), an efficient data structure for manipulating large-scale Boolean functions. We compile the given keyword queries into a BDD under a taxonomy model. The number of possible keyword sets can be exponentially large, but the compiled BDD gives a compact representation, and matching process will become faster. In addition, our method can deal with any Boolean combination of keywords from the taxonomy, while our previous result considered only a conjunctive keyword set. In this paper, we describe the basic idea of our new method and show a preliminary experimental result. ...|$|R

A 16th century description says this diocese was [...] "the most scattered, and {{also one of the}} poorest, in the pre-Reformation Church in Scotland". Few priests were present to serve the Church here, and those who did serve in the region secured their positions by clan ties rather than by piety, and were more interested in church income than in spreading the faith. On the eve of the Reformation, the Bishop of the Isles sent his relative Fr. Donald Munro to make an inventory of all the prominent parishes of the diocese. This <b>document,</b> <b>Description</b> of the Western Isles of Scotland, was written in 1549, and is the oldest known description of the Outer Hebrides. At the time there was one parish church on Barra and five on the islands of North Uist, Benbecula, and South Uist combined. Vatersay had a chapel.|$|E
