However, high-precision processing of large potassium <b>dihydrogen</b> <b>phosphate</b> crystal workpieces is difficult. In this article, surface roughness and subsurface damage characteristics of a (001) potassium <b>dihydrogen</b> <b>phosphate</b> crystal surface produced by traditional and rotary ultrasonic machining are studied. The influence of process parameters, including spindle speed, feed speed, type and size of sintered diamond wheel, ultrasonic power, and selection of cutting fluid on potassium <b>dihydrogen</b> <b>phosphate</b> crystal surface integrity, was analyzed. The surface integrity, especially the subsurface damage depth, was affected significantly by the ultrasonic power. Metal-sintered diamond tools with high granularity were most suitable for machining potassium <b>dihydrogen</b> <b>phosphate</b> crystal. Cutting fluid {{played a key role}} in potassium <b>dihydrogen</b> <b>phosphate</b> crystal machining. A more precise surface can be obtained in machining with a higher spindle speed, lower feed speed, and using kerosene as cutting fluid. Based on the provided optimized process parameters for machining potassium <b>dihydrogen</b> <b>phosphate</b> crystal, a processed surface quality with Ra value of 33 [*]nm and subsurface damage depth value of 6. 38 μm was achieved...|$|R

40|$|Phosphates are {{ubiquitous}} in biology and {{nearly half of}} all proteins interact with their partners by means of recognition of phosphate residues. Therefore, {{a better understanding of the}} phosphate ion binding by peptidic structures is highly desirable. Two new receptors have been designed and synthesized and their anion binding properties in an acetonitrile solution have been determined. The structure of hosts mimics a part of the kinase active site that is responsible for the recognition of the phosphate residue. New hosts contain additional free amino groups with the aim to facilitate coordination of protonated anions, such as <b>dihydrogen</b> <b>phosphate.</b> According to spectrophotometric measurements, stepwise 1 : 1 and 1 : 2 binding modes have been observed for both receptors in the presence of acetate, hydrogen sulfate and <b>dihydrogen</b> <b>phosphate.</b> Compared with the acyclic receptor, the macrocyclic receptor has demonstrated a remarkably enhanced selectivity for <b>dihydrogen</b> <b>phosphate</b> over other anions.
