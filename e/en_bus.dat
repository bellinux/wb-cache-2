50|$|The Savanna {{team was}} {{dropped on the}} moonlit night of 15 March 1941. They buried their {{equipment}} and reconnoitred. Soon they discovered that their plan was out of date: the pathfinder pilots were no longer being transported <b>en</b> masse by <b>bus</b> as they had planned for, rather they now travelled by car in groups of just two or three. Prevarication had cost the SOE {{the opportunity to make}} a dramatic surgical strike. Unable to complete the operation, the team was ordered to disperse.

40|$|Nature has {{discovered}} the global village. Over the years, hundreds of exotic {{plants and animals}} have {{made their way into}} the Netherlands. They take advantage of the existing urban infrastructure to seek out suitable niches in the city. People rarely think of these urban ecosystems in terms of wildlife because they do not live up to the romantic picture we have of nature. But what is the relevance of global nature to theories about the city? The BosBus, an ordinary city bus with a growing forest inside it, was a way of probing this cultural interpretation of nature. The BosBus mobile nature reserve travelled the roads of Rotterdam during the International Architecture Biennale of 2003. Debates and dialogues took place in the <b>bus</b> <b>en</b> route, with architects, city planners, ecologists and biologists hammering out the relations between culture and nature in and around the city of Rotterdam. As the bus visited their chosen locations, standpoints were argued and demonstrated. This book reports the adventures of the bus and those who rode it on its excursions round the city...|$|R

50|$|The ZCC changed fairly {{dramatically}} {{following his}} son Edward Lekganyane's assumption {{of control of}} the church. Edward was a highly educated, flamboyant figure who eventually obtained a degree at an Afrikaans divinity school. In contrast to his father, Edward relied less on faith healing and oral testimony in services, and moved towards a more biblically-based doctrine. Under his leadership the all-male Mokhukhu organization developed out of his core group of supporters. This group initially formed as a church choir. Wearing military-style khakis, police-style hats, and the Star badge, the Mokhukhu in each congregation engaged in dancing, singing, and praying {{three times a week}} according to a preset schedule. An additional feature of Edward's control of the ZCC was the rapid growth of Zion City Moria as a pilgrimage site. Using the Maclean farm that his father had purchased in the 1940s, Edward instituted annual pilgrimages that have gone on to become massive southern African-wide events. Each year during Easter Holidays Church members <b>bus</b> <b>en</b> masse to Moria, Polokwane (Pietersburg) (several million members) to meet the Bishop and to pray for blessings.|$|R
50|$|Sintraminergetica {{has sued}} Drummond Company for {{allegedly}} conspiring with paramilitary groups to exterminate the union. This suit was brought {{after years of}} claims of abuses ranging from forcing potential employees to undergo lie detector tests to reveal their political affiliation {{as a condition of}} employment, to the assassination of union leaders, their displacement from the mining zones, and accusations made against them of being guerilla supporters. On March 12, 2001, Valmore Locarno Rodriguez and Victor Hugo Orcasita Amaya, the President and Vice President of the union local, were taken from a company <b>bus</b> <b>en</b> route from the mine to their homes. Locarno was assassinated with two shots in the head in front of his coworkers. Over the protests of the workers, Orcasita was taken away in a truck. The next day his body was found, with obvious signs of torture. On October 5 of the same year, under similar circumstances, Gustavo Soler, the union's new president, was taken from a bus, taken away in a pick-up, tortured, and killed. His body was found on October 7 by people from the area.|$|R
5000|$|In March-April 2012, several {{students}} in the upper grades were accused of throwing heavy objects at passing cars from school bus windows. On March 29, 2012, on a <b>bus</b> <b>en</b> route to the South Miami area, one student allegedly threw a mini-building, which was designed for an architecture course, causing a car to swerve {{out of control and}} crash into the Coco Plum bridge, located in Coral Gables. Another student allegedly cut off all the steel seat belts on a school bus and threw them into oncoming traffic. Other incidents occurred, but through a school-wide investigation, and acquisition of suspected students' text messages, a ring of students were discovered who partook in the so-called [...] "scalping" [...] of automobiles. The students were tried on charges of disturbing the peace, destruction of property, and battery, by a class-action lawsuit, which was finally brought to court in December 2014. Three students pleaded guilty to the offenses and received sentences of 100 community service hours each, along with a ten-session anger management course.|$|R
40|$|The PCA 9522 is a {{monolithic}} {{bipolar integrated circuit}} for bus buffering in applications including I 2 C-bus, SMBus, etc. It includes hot insertion logic for detecting stop and idle conditions, making it ideal for live insertion into backplanes. The buffer extends the bus load limit by buffering both the SCL and SDA lines. The PCA 9522 is a drop-in replacement for the IES 5502, with only the maximum bus voltage reduced from 15 V to 10 V. Hot insertion logic allows the IC to be plugged into live backplanes without causing data corruption on the bus. The open-collector ready signal (RDY) indicates when the connection has been made. Precharging of the backplane ports minimizes disruptions to the bus during hot insertion. The enable function allows sections of the bus to be isolated. Individual parts of the system can be brought on-line successively. Bus level translation between a very wide range of bus voltages, from 1. 8 V to 10 V, is supported. These features provide enormous flexibility in interfacing systems of different technologies, operating speeds and loads. The unique operation of the PCA 9522 provides {{one of the fastest}} response times of such bidirectional buffers. It does this without the need for rise-time accelerators which, combined with low noise margins, may cause glitches outside of the I 2 C-bus specification. 2. Features and benefits Dual, bidirectional unity gain isolating buffer Hot insertion logic prevents data and clock bus corruption for live backplane applications Pre-charge minimizes data corruption on live insertion Supports I 2 C-bus (Standard-mode and Fast-mode), SMBus (standard and high power modes) and PMBus Open-collector ready output (RDY) Fast switching times allow operation in excess of 1 MHz Enable (<b>EN)</b> allows <b>bus</b> segments to be disconnected Low current standby mode when not enabled High-impedance ports when IC unpowered 6 mA (static) pull-down capability Low noise susceptibility Supports the connection of several buffers in series Level shift bus voltages from 1. 8 V to 10 VNXP Semiconductor...|$|R
5000|$|Sydney Hayter {{was a model}} employer. For example, he {{had planned}} to provide his staff with housing but {{finances}} had never become adequate for this; however, he would take groups of his staff to Littlehampton on their day off, take them fishing in his boat, take them for a meal and provide tickets for a variety show. Sometimes a group would accompany Sydney to a football match at Wembley. All dealings within the company were on first-name terms (unusual at that time) and passengers, too, were on first name terms with the crews. A club room was provided at the bus garage, fitted with a TV and sporting facilities, and regular social events were organised. An annual outing to the coast was organised for staff and families (on two weekends, so that all could attend). The staff were offered the opportunity to join a union but, having such a benevolent employer, none chose to do so. This resulted in an incident in 1957 during the national bus strike (through which YBS continued to operate) when a Yellow <b>Bus</b> <b>en</b> route from Farnham was [...] "held-up" [...] by 20 militant union members from the Aldershot and District company, who prevented the driver from continuing, and deflated his vehicle's tyres.|$|R
50|$|While on a <b>bus</b> <b>en</b> {{route to}} the new ranch, Lennie — who, because of his mental disability, is prone to forget the {{simplest}} things or phrases but can only remember about the rabbits—asks George where they are going. George is annoyed about this and tells him about the work cards they got at the bus entrance, which Lennie does remember, but incorrectly remembers having them in his pocket, since George has both of them. After being dropped off 10 miles from their destination, George and Lennie decide to camp for the night by the Salinas River. When George points to Lennie the river, he runs {{to the river and}} dunks his whole head in it, drinking from it like an animal. George soon catches Lennie petting a dead bird, takes it away from him and throws it {{to the other side of}} the river for safety reasons. When Lennie hears that they are going have beans for dinner, he requests ketchup, to which George responds that they do not have any. At night, as George and Lennie are eating beans for dinner, Lennie requests for the same thing, with George responding angrily, stating that whatever they do not have is what Lennie always wants to have. This leaves Lennie puzzled, as he forgot that first response from earlier. This also causes George to have a long speech about Lennie's ungratefulness, childlike behavior and why they had to escape from Weed. Eventually, George eases the tensions by telling Lennie his favorite story about their future farm before going to sleep.|$|R
