This paper presents {{the performance of}} DFIG based wind turbine system during voltage dip caused due to different types of grid <b>fault.</b> Low-voltage <b>ride-through</b> (LVRT) capability of the system according to the grid connection requirement during these faults is studied and discussed in the paper. Further, power flow through the grid with different load conditions is compared and LVRT capability {{of the system is}} studied for each load condition. In addition to this, a 16 bus distribution system is connected to two generators and one DFIG based wind turbine system and the reactive power compensation is provided at two buses by using capacitors. The results obtained prove that due to the compensation provided the reactive power flow through those buses is reduced to a great extent and thereby improving systems stability and reliability. The design and response of the DFIG based wind turbine system during different fault conditions, various load conditions and integrated system consisting of DFIG based WT system and 16 bus distribution systems have been verified using MATLAB / Simulink.

In this sense, the present paper intends to investigate the behavior of a full-converter wind generator with a permanent magnet synchronous machine during symmetrical and asymmetrical voltage sags. Two solutions to improve the low voltage ride-through capability (LVRT) of this technology are analyzed: discharging resistors (brake chopper) and resonant controllers (RCs). The design and limitations of these solutions and the others proposed in the literature are discussed.

40|$|At present, most methodologies {{proposed}} to control over double fed induction generators (DFIGs) {{are based on}} single machine model, where the interactions from network have been neglected. Considering this, this paper proposes a decentralized coordinated control of DFIG based on the neural interaction measurement observer.

A robust stabilization technique is also {{proposed to}} override the effect of approximation error. A H 2 controller and a H∞ controller are employed to achieve specified engineering purposes, respectively.

40|$|The {{low voltage}} ride-through (LVRT) {{capability}} {{is one of}} the challenges faced by the integration of large-scale photovoltaic (PV) power stations into electrical grid which has not been fully investigated. Therefore, this paper presents a comprehensive control strategy of single-stage PV power plant to enhance the LVRT capability based on the Malaysian standards and modern grid codes connection requirements. The proposed control overcomes the problems of dc-link over-voltage and ac over-current that may cause disconnection or damage to the inverter. For this purpose, dc-chopper brake controller and current limiter are used to absorb the excessive dc-voltage and limits excessive ac current, respectively. This control strategy can also ensure the reactive power support through the injection of reactive current according to the standard requirements as soon as the voltage sag is detected. Furthermore, to keep the power balance between both sides of the inverter, PV array can generate possible amount of active power according to the rating of grid inverter and voltage sag depth by the operating in different modes. The results illustrate that the proposed control strategy is effective, not only to improve the capability of <b>ride-through</b> <b>fault</b> safely and keep the inverter connected, but also to provide grid support through active and reactive power control at different type of faults...|$|R
40|$|The key {{objective}} of wind turbine development {{is to ensure}} that output power is continuously increased. It is authenticated that wind turbines (WTs) supply the necessary reactive power to the grid at the time of fault and after fault to aid the flowing grid voltage. At this juncture, this paper introduces a novel heuristic based controller module employing differential evolution and neural network architecture to improve the low-voltage ride-through rate of grid-connected wind turbines, which are connected along with doubly fed induction generators (DFIGs). The traditional crowbar-based systems were basically applied to secure the rotor-side converter during the occurrence of grid faults. This traditional controller is found not to satisfy the desired requirement, since DFIG during the connection of crowbar acts like a squirrel cage module and absorbs the reactive power from the grid. This limitation is taken care of in this paper by introducing heuristic controllers that remove the usage of crowbar and ensure that wind turbines supply necessary reactive power to the grid during faults. The controller is designed in this paper to enhance the DFIG converter during the grid fault and this controller takes care of the <b>ride-through</b> <b>fault</b> without employing any other hardware modules. The paper introduces a double wavelet neural network controller which is appropriately tuned employing differential evolution.

The variable-band hysteresis can provide quick transient response to enhance the <b>fault</b> <b>ride-through</b> capability of the inverter [26, 27]. The performance of this controller is affected by low-order current harmonic distortions and variable switching frequency. The reactive current control can reduce the PCC overvoltage [28, 29, 30]. However, this strategy cannot deal with severe voltage swells because of the current rating. Furthermore, flexible advanced algorithms are proposed to deal with dc-link voltage fluctuation caused by severe symmetrical voltage swells [17, 31].|$|E

This is the first study to look at a <b>fault</b> <b>ride-through</b> solution to avoid shutdown of the turbine and lost revenue during a fault, while keeping additional damage to a minimum. A worst case scenario of a jammed flap with no direct knowledge of its occurrence is considered, while operating a DQ-axis Smart Rotor wind turbine.

40|$|Abstract — Due to the {{increasing}} penetration of wind farms in power systems, stability issues arise strongly for power system operation. Doubly-Fed Induction Generators (DFIG) are charac-terized with some unique features during normal/abnormal op-erating conditions as compared with singly-fed ones. <b>Fault</b> <b>ride-Through</b> (FRT) mainly aims to delay a disconnecting of the DFIG units during grid faults for a possible time to restore the system stability if the fault is cleared within a permissible time.

40|$|Distributed {{generation}} (DG) {{is being}} {{employed as a}} means of achieving increased reliability for electrical power systems as regarded by consumers. As the most of DG technologies utilize renewable sources, the power electronic interface plays a vital role to match the characteristics of a DG unit with the grid requirements. In this thesis, a voltage source converter (VSC) is considered as a front end for a DG unit that utilizes a variable speed wind turbine. The control of the voltage/current is considered the most important part when implementing the interface. In order to obtain a high bandwidth, a vector current controller (VCC) is developed for the VSC connected to the grid through a filter inductor. The VSC system is simulated and examined in case of voltage dips. The VCC has proven to work adequately in case of balanced dips. However, most faults are unbalanced resulting in unbalanced voltage dips on the VSC terminals. Hence, the VCC had to be modified to give a better performance in case of grid voltage imbalance. The dual vector current controller (DVCC) has been implemented to enhance the performance in case of unbalanced voltage dips. Two methods are proposed and compared to calculate the current references used by the controller. They depend on how the oscillating power, which is the power at double the fundamental frequency that is produced due to unbalanced faults, is compensated. The system is examined for all possible voltage dips. Design equations are derived to calculate the maximum current that the VSC switches should hold in case of different dips. Moreover, a case study is presented at which a design criterion, based on the knowledge of wind statistics at a specific site, is introduced to give the DG the capability to <b>ride-through</b> <b>faults.</b> The controller is then modified to control a VSC connected to the grid through an inductor-capacitor-inductor (LCL-) filter, which has the advantage of eliminating the higher harmonics in the grid current. The VSC connected to a weak grid through an LCL-filter is also considered in the thesis. The voltage regulation limits are calculated and the controller is tested in case of the load connection/disconnection and balanced voltage dips...|$|R

The investigations have shown that improvement in the AC network voltage is minimal during both AC and DC network faults. However, the DC network voltage improves and rapidly recovers after both AC and DC network faults. This is because while the AC network is relatively weak during the fault, the interlinking bi-directional converter tracks the pre-fault power reference following the fault clearance and assists with restoration of the DC bus voltage.
