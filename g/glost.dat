50|$|The {{original}} sun, <b>Glost,</b> was {{the work}} of Guerimm, the god of fire. New gods appeared and started to oppose the twelve gods of Aventuria. One of them, Arkan'Zim, destroyed <b>Glost,</b> and another new god, Sindayri, created a new sun, aiming to reduce the influence of the twelve gods in the hollow world. The splinters of <b>Glost</b> were spread everywhere. The inhabitants picked them and drew runes on them. They thus became runestones; the combination of three runestones can lead to the liberation of the energy of <b>Glost,</b> allowing a new magic. Tharun is linked to the surface of Ethra by a double-sided volcano. The upper side is on an island 1,400 km west from Havena, the other side is upside down, and is situated in Tharun on the isle of Hamur. The society is a military dictatorship, with a caste of Sword Masters ruling the rest of the population.|$|E

50|$|However, {{because the}} <b>glost</b> firing is {{at a higher}} {{temperature}} than used in overglaze decoration, the range of available colours is more limited. Examples of oxides that do not lose their colour during a <b>glost</b> firing are the cobalt blue made famous by Chinese Ming dynasty blue and white porcelain and the cobalt and turquoise blues, pale purple, sage green, and bole red characteristic of İznik pottery. The painting styles used are covered at (among other articles): china painting, blue and white pottery, tin-glazed pottery, maiolica, faience, Delftware.|$|E
50|$|The biscuitwares were glazed {{and fired}} {{again in the}} bigger <b>glost</b> kilns - again they were placed in saggars, {{separated}} by kiln furniture such as stints, saddles and thimbles.|$|E
50|$|In-glaze is {{a method}} of decorating ceramic articles, where the {{decoration}} is applied {{on the surface of}} the glaze before the <b>glost</b> firing so that it matures simultaneously with the glaze.|$|E
50|$|A {{tortoiseshell}} ware {{is effectively}} a creamware that is decorated under the glaze by painting or sponging with metallic oxides. During the <b>glost</b> firing, the colours flow {{to produce the}} tortoiseshell effect.|$|E
50|$|The unfired ceramic ware {{was placed}} in saggars and then biscuit fired, before being glazed and again placed in saggars prior to being <b>glost</b> fired. Ware may then be decorated, and placed on {{refractory}} bats and fired again such as in a muffle kiln.|$|E
50|$|The biscuitwares are glazed. They fired {{again in}} the bigger <b>glost</b> kilns- again they are placed in sealed saggars, items {{separated}} by kiln furniture such as stints, saddles and thimbles. The table-ware would then be decorated by transfers or by painting {{and placed in the}} muffle kiln.|$|E
50|$|Tortoiseshell wares {{are those}} that have been {{decorated}} by the application of coloured metallic oxides prepared as slips and applied to the biscuit body of a pot either by sponge or by brush. These were then covered by a transparent lead-glaze and fired a second time (known as glaze or <b>glost</b> firing).|$|E
50|$|The {{museum is}} centred on the Roslyn pottery. It {{contains}} two biscuit ovens and two larger <b>glost</b> ovens. In addition are two enamel kilns. A tandem compound steam engine by Marshall & Sons, of Gainsborough, Lincolnshire {{is in place}} but it is turned by an electric motor. The two muffle kilns came from elsewhere.|$|E
50|$|A {{specific}} {{example of}} pin-holes is Spit-out. These are pin-holes or craters sometimes occurring in glazed non-vitreous ceramics {{while they are}} in the decorating kiln. The cause of this defect is the evolution of water vapour, adsorbed by the porous body, during the period between the <b>glost</b> firing and the decorating firing, via minute cracks in the glaze.|$|E
50|$|Overglaze {{colors are}} {{low-temperature}} glazes that give ceramics a more decorative, glassy look. A piece is fired first, this initial firing {{being called the}} <b>glost</b> firing, then the overglaze decoration is applied, and it is fired again. Once the piece is fired and {{comes out of the}} kiln, its texture becomes smoother because of the glaze.|$|E
5000|$|Pitchers are pottery {{that has}} been broken {{in the course of}} manufacture. Biscuit (unglazed) {{pitchers}} can be crushed, ground and re-used, either as a low-percentage addition to the virgin raw materials on the same factory, or elsewhere as grog. Because of the adhering glaze, <b>glost</b> pitchers find less use. The crushed material can also be used in other industries as an inert filler.|$|E
5000|$|Modern {{earthenware}} may be biscuit (or [...] "bisque") {{fired to}} temperatures between 1,000 and 1,150 °C (1,800 and 2,100 °F) and glost-fired (or [...] "glaze-fired") to between 950 to 1,050 C, the usual practice in factories and some studio potteries. Some studio potters follow the reverse practice, with a low-temperature bisque firing and a high-temperature <b>glost</b> firing. The firing schedule {{will be determined}} by the raw materials used and the desired characteristics of the finished ware.|$|E
50|$|Metal marks {{are dark}} lines, often {{accompanied}} by damage in the glaze, caused by the deposition of metal during the use of metal utensils. The cutlery, or other relatively soft metal, will leave a very thin smear of metal on pottery ware if the glaze is minutely pitted. A glaze may have this defective surface as it leaves the <b>glost</b> kiln, or it may subsequently develop such a surface {{as a result of}} inadequate chemical durability. The fault is also known as cutlery marking.|$|E
50|$|Stoneware can be once-fired or twice-fired. Maximum firing {{temperatures}} {{can vary}} significantly, from 1100 °C to 1300 °C {{depending on the}} flux content. Typically, temperatures will be between 1180 °C to 1280 °C, the higher end of which equate to Bullers Rings 38 to 40 or Seger cones 4 to 8. To produce a better quality fired glaze finish, twice-firing can be used. This can be especially important for formulations composed of highly carbonaceous clays. For these, biscuit firing is around 900 °C, and <b>glost</b> firing (the firing used to form the glaze over the ware) 1180 - 1280 °C. Water absorption of stoneware products is less than 1 percent.|$|E
5000|$|The raw {{materials}} of pottery include clay, quartz and feldspar. These are mixed sieved and filtered to make slip, which is pressed {{to make a}} workable body. Bowls are jolleyed on a wheel, plates are jiggered on a wheel and fancies moulded in plaster moulds. This greenware is dried, and placed into saggars which are stacked into a bottle oven for the first or biscuit) firing at 1,000C. The resulting [...] "biscuit ware" [...] can be decorated with an underglaze transfer and coated with a glaze. These are then placed in a saggar with kiln furniture thimbles to separate them and fired for a second time, the <b>glost</b> firing can be up to 1,400C, in another bottle oven. Depending on ware, the item could be decorated and gilded by hand and be fired {{for a third time}} in a muffle kiln at 1,250.|$|E
50|$|Each pot bank {{made its}} own saggars from fire clay. In the saggar maker's workshop, clay would be rolled around a wooded form by the saggar maker, while a lad would knock the bottom using a mawl and an iron mould. A saggar could be {{expected}} to last for around 40 firings after which it had to be replaced. During biscuit firing, tableware cups and bowls were put on a fine layer of flint dust {{on the bottom of the}} saggar, while flatware was supported like a sandwich between layers of flint. They had to be stacked carefully to prevent distortion during firing. Then the saggar was topped and sealed to prevent any fumes or kiln debris entering the saggar and discolouring the wares. During the second firing, the <b>glost</b> firing, the glazed ware was held by pins, saddles, spurs and thimbles, as any contact point would leave a blemish on the glaze. Sorting the thimbles for reuse was one of the lowest jobs in the potbank.|$|E
50|$|Placing {{and drawing}} the kiln was {{the job of}} placers. Placers would take the unfired {{greenware}} that was drying in the greenhouse (or the <b>glost</b> placing shop) and stack it in the saggar. They would seal the saggar, then carry it into the bottle oven on their heads. Each loaded saggar weighed around 56 lb. They were stacked in bungs {{in such a way}} so the most delicate wares were protected. A bung of saggars would be 12 or 13 high, {{on the top of the}} bung would be unfired newly moulded green saggars. In the centre of the bottle oven is the well-hole, over it, saggars with no bottoms would be placed in the pipe-bung: this formed a chimney to draw the fires. When the kiln was full, the clammins were bricked up leaving one brick short to form a spyhole so the firemen could watch the buller's rings to judge the temperature of the firing.|$|E
50|$|This method {{involved}} the engraving of a design on a copper plate, {{which was then}} printed onto gummed tissue. The colour paste was worked into the cut areas of the copper plate and wiped from the uncut surfaces, and then printed by passing through rollers. These designs, including edge-patterns {{which had to be}} manipulated in sections, were cut out using scissors and applied to the biscuit-fired ware (using a white fabric), itself prepared with a gum solution. The tissue was then floated off in water, leaving the pattern adhering to the plate. This was then dipped in the glaze and returned to the kiln for the <b>glost</b> firing. Blue underglaze transfer became a standard feature of Staffordshire pottery. Spode also used on-glaze transfers for other wares. The well-known Spode blue-and-white dinner services with engraved sporting scenes and Italian views were developed under Josiah Spode the younger, but continued to be reproduced into much later times.|$|E
5000|$|The potbank {{employed}} a cod placer {{to supervise the}} work, but placers who were paid by the job used to wait outside the potbanks for work. Drawing would be done 48 hours after firing finished but in hard times placers were sent into a kiln that was still glowing red after 24. The men wore five layers of clothing and wet cloths over their heads. Life expectancy for a placer was low.A bottle oven would be fired once a week. The fires were set {{in each of the}} firemouths by the firemen. Once alight the kiln would be heated slowly as the moisture was burned out of the clay, this was known as [...] "smoking". Then the kiln would be taken to full temperature, and kept there for three hours then allowed to cool. A biscuit firing took three days and a <b>glost</b> firing took two days. After 48 hours the kiln had cooled sufficiently to be drawn by the placers, and the wares checked. The placers' earnings were dependent on the success of the firing.|$|E
50|$|The Fasolt {{family from}} Selb arrived in Blankenhain and began by modernising the company. In 1856, {{after the death}} of Viktor Fasolt, his widow Elisabeth took over the business. In 1879, she passed the {{management}} control to her sons, Max and Karl Fasolt. Elisabeth had maintained an ambiguous relationship with the porcelain entrepreneur Edward Eichler, who was also involved in the running of the factory from 1856 onwards. Some important events during this phase included: the new Saxon rhomb trademark was introduced; three large new furnaces for annealing and <b>glost</b> were built: and a new steam engine was purchased to operate the mill on the large factory floor. Other innovations and measures to modernise took place during this period, which was characterized by an ever-increasing degree of mechanisation of operations. An important element was the establishment of a railway line between Blankenhain and Weimar in 1887; this provided a major advantage for the factory, which by that time had already been producing mainly large quantities of porcelain goods. So in 1879 with transport costing less and production numbers steadily increasing, sons Max and Karl Fasolt took over the running of the company.|$|E
50|$|The saggars {{were used}} for the biscuit and the <b>glost</b> firing. They were {{expected}} to last for about 40 firings; each potbank made their own in a saggar making workshop. Saggars were made from fireclay, by a saggar maker and two assistants: the framemaker and the bottom knocker. The framemaker beat the clay into a sheet on a metal table using a large mallet, the mow or mawl. Using a frame he would cut it to size, sprinkle it with sawdust and wrap it round a wooden block to make the walls. The framemaker was usually an apprentice in his late teens. The bottom knocker, usually a boy in his early teens, did the same on a smaller scale, constructing the round or banjo-shaped bottom. Again the mow was used to beat the air out of the clay and flatten the sheet. The saggar maker was an experienced craftsman who paid his assistants out of his piece-work earnings: he took the bottom and the sides onto a wheel and using his thumbs joined the sides to the bottom. The green saggars were dried and then placed on the top of bungs during the next firing of the kiln.|$|E
40|$|Nowadays, {{business}} competition {{becomes so}} high between companies. Customer satisfaction {{is a crucial}} thing to keep companies in business. That is why; every company is trying to exceed customer satisfaction. Customer satisfaction {{can be reached by}} improving company's processes continuously. First step in improving the process in PT. Doulton is identifying the problem that faced by company. After that, the measurement and analysis are done to identify the root cause of the problem. The measurement and analysis processes are using process mapping method. Then, the corrective actions that need to take are identified. The problem faced by PT. Doulton is the big number of body fault found in Enamel Selection Department. This problem happened because the <b>Glost</b> Selection Department did not do detailed checking to <b>glost,</b> and sampling method used in QA <b>glost</b> did not represent the real condition of the batch. The corrective action suggested are reduced the target value set for <b>glost</b> selector, so <b>glost</b> selector can do detailed checking to <b>glost.</b> Moreover, PT.

40|$|By {{monitoring}} the thermal conductivity {{of ceramic materials}} during sintering, direct insight into the microstructural evolution can be gained. Using an in-situ thermooptical measuring system for measurement of thermal conductivities and densification rates and a high-temperature X-ray diffractometer, sintering mechanisms of porcelain have been examined. For the investigation of fast biscuit and <b>glost</b> firing cycles of whiteware, a firing process of a continuosly gas fired kiln with a firing atmosphere containing water vapour was simulated in a resistance heated laboratory furnace. The sintering properties deviate significantly from results obtained in dry air. From densification data, a "kinetic field" for the <b>glost</b> firing of whiteware {{has been set up}} to calculate optimal fast firing cycles and to determine the activation energy for the densification. The activation energy increases in the intermediate sintering stage...|$|E

40|$|As {{the final}} {{part of the}} study, the {{interactions}} between a commercial leadless glaze and a simulated bone china body glass during <b>glost</b> firing at different temperatures have been investigated. Advanced techniques such as electron probe microanalysis (EPMA) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) have been employed {{in order to assess}} the contribution of the glassy phase of a biscuit fired bone china body to the formation of interaction layers at the interfaces independently. The results showed the presence of several calcium phosphate phases with distinct morphology at the glaze-simulated body glass interface for both the <b>glost</b> firing temperatures employed. It was suggested that the formation of the hydroxyapatite crystals at the glaze-biscuit fired bone china body interface may be helped by the glassy phase. TEM was found to be particularly useful since the interaction layers presented a most complicated and also interesting microstructure due in part to their multi-layered nature and small size of the calcium phosphate crystals situated at the interfaces.

40|$|This part of {{the study}} {{involves}} the investigation of the interactions between an ABS type commercial leadless glaze and a biscuit fired bone china body during <b>glost</b> firing at different temperatures using XRD and SEM techniques. The aim was to obtain detailed and systematic information about the morphological and chemical characteristics of the resultant phases formed at the interfaces. Separate examination of the interactions between the glaze and the experimental crystalline phases of the body prepared earlier, namely anorthite and beta-TCP. were also carried out in an effort to show their susceptibility to react with the glaze independently. As a result, the presence of a range of interaction layers with distinctly different morphological and chemical characteristics was successfully demonstrated. It was proposed that beta-TCP was the major contributor to the overall interactions by reacting with CaO from the glaze in the presence of water vapour and forming hydroxyapatite crystals at the glaze-body interfaces. Although the exact origin for the development of water vapour in the molten glaze could not determined, several potential sources were suggested. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|In this paper, {{part of an}} {{extended}} study, crystalline phases of a biscuit fired bone china body, namely anorthite and beta-tricalcium phosphate (beta-TCP), were produced experimentally {{to be used in}} subsequent interface studies for simulation of the interactions during <b>glost</b> firing at different temperatures between an ABS type commercial leadless glaze and the individual phases originally present in the body. The research was undertaken {{based on the premise that}} bone china has been a product providing the greatest challenge in moving to a totally leadless glaze. High bulk density and low apparent porosity values were achieved from both the anorthite and beta-TCP samples through the suitable heat treatments. The microstructural and chemical characteristics of the experimental phases were studied using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning (SEM), and transmission (TEM) electron microscopy techniques in combination with EDS analysis. The morphological and chemical similarity of the phases to those originally present in a biscuit fired bone china body was clearly demonstrated. This similarity supports the choice of the experimental material for the interface studies undertaken with these phases in the second part of the study. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|QCD {{perturbation}} theory ignores the compact nature of SU(3) gauge group that {{gives rise to}} the periodic θ-vacuum of the theory. We propose to modify the gluon propagator to reconcile {{perturbation theory}} with the anomalous Ward identities for the topological current in the θ-vacuum. As a result, the gluon couples to the Veneziano ghost describing the tunneling transitions between different Chern-Simons sectors of the vacuum; we call the emerging gluon dressed by ghost loops a "glost". We evaluate the <b>glost</b> propagator and find that it has the form G(p) = (p^ 2 + χ_top/p^ 2) ^- 1 where χ_top is the Yang-Mills topological susceptibility related to the η' mass by Witten-Veneziano relation; this propagator describes confinement of gluons at distances ∼χ_top^- 1 / 4 ≃ 1 fm. The same functional form of the propagator was originally proposed by Gribov as a solution to the gauge copies problem that plagues perturbation theory. The resulting running coupling coincides with the perturbative one at p^ 2 ≫√(χ_top), but in the infrared region either freezes (in pure Yang-Mills theory) or vanishes (in full QCD with light quarks), in accord with experimental evidence. Our scenario makes explicit the connection between confinement and topology of the QCD vacuum; we discuss the implications for spin physics, high energy scattering, and the physics of quark-gluon plasma.
