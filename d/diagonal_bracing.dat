5|$|The Gale of January 1976 on 2 January, brought {{winds of}} around 90mph (140km/h) which almost {{destroyed}} the telescope. The towers bowed, {{and one of}} the bearings connecting the dish to the towers slipped. After an expensive repair, <b>diagonal</b> <b>bracing</b> girders were added to the towers to prevent this happening again.|$|E
25|$|The 1868 {{earthquake}} occurred {{well before}} the East Bay region was extensively urbanized. The following year, in 1869, the William Meek Estate {{became one of the}} first developments in the area, built on 3,000 acres (12km²) in what became known as the Cherryland district of Eden Township. Recent renovations of the Meek Mansion have revealed that with the 1868 earthquake still fresh in minds of residents of the time, some unusual <b>diagonal</b> <b>bracing</b> was built into the original construction. Although its magnitude was less than the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, the intensity of shaking experienced in the Hayward area may have been greater than in 1906 due to the proximity of the Hayward Fault.|$|E
25|$|Schwedler {{invented the}} Schwedler truss, which was widely used {{worldwide}} in framed bridges and roofs until about 1900. It {{is a kind}} of curved chord or bowstring truss with the minimum number of diagonals, which are to bear only tension, not compression; it requires a slight downward curvature in the middle, usually replaced with extra <b>diagonal</b> <b>bracing</b> for appearance and cost saving. Schwedler himself would have preferred it to be used less on aesthetic grounds. His first use of the innovation was for the railway bridge over the Weser at Corvey, on the edge of Höxter (1864), for which he won a gold medal at the 1867 Paris International Exposition. One of the last remaining examples is the bridge carrying the Nagold Valley Railway over the Nagold in Unterreichenbach.|$|E
50|$|In engineering, a <b>diagonal</b> <b>brace</b> is a beam used {{to brace}} a {{rectangular}} structure (such as scaffolding) to withstand strong forces pushing into it; although called a diagonal, due to practical considerations <b>diagonal</b> <b>braces</b> {{are often not}} connected to {{the corners of the}} rectangle.|$|R

It can be concluded that single <b>diagonal</b> <b>braces</b> are effective in reducing lateral displacements.|$|R
5000|$|A queen-post bridge has two uprights, placed {{about one-third}} of the way from each end of the truss. They are {{connected}} across the top by a beam and use a <b>diagonal</b> <b>brace</b> between the outer edges. The central square between the two verticals is either unbraced (on shorter spans), or has one or two <b>diagonal</b> <b>braces</b> for rigidity. A single diagonal reaches between opposite corners; two <b>diagonal</b> <b>braces</b> may either reach from the bottom of each upright post {{to the center of the}} upper beam, or form a corner-to-corner [...] "X" [...] inside the square.|$|R
25|$|The lantern {{room with}} {{hemispherical}} dome roof sits {{on top of}} the tower and is accessed via a hatchway in the floor which is lined with lead. All optics have been removed from the lantern, but a pedestal similar to the original has been recently installed. The cylindrical lantern base is constructed from 4.5mm thick steel plates, with a hatch door on the northern side to allow access to the exterior gallery. Its middle section consists of eight trapezoidal frames, five of which are glazed. The remaining three frames (on the western side) are filled with galvanized sheeting with <b>diagonal</b> <b>bracing.</b> The dome is made from eight steel segments bolted together with additional bar stiffeners. It is painted red on the exterior and topped with a ventilator cowl. The narrow gallery that encircles the lantern has a hardwood timber floor supported by cast iron brackets, and a lightweight tubular balustrade, also painted red.|$|E
2500|$|Some older {{low-cost}} {{structures are}} elevated on tapered concrete pylons set into shallow pits, a method frequently used to attach outdoor decks to existing buildings. This {{is seen in}} conditions of damp soil, [...] especially in tropical conditions, as it leaves a dry ventilated space under the house, and in far northern conditions of permafrost (frozen mud) as it keeps the building's warmth from destabilizing the ground beneath. During an earthquake, the pylons may tip, spilling the building to the ground. This can be overcome by using deep-bored holes to contain cast-in-place reinforced pylons, which are then secured to the floor panel {{at the corners of}} the building. Another technique is to add sufficient <b>diagonal</b> <b>bracing</b> or sections of concrete shear wall between pylons.|$|E
2500|$|The Caudron-Fabre, {{like the}} earlier Caudron land-planes, had no {{enclosed}} fuselage but instead {{a pair of}} parallel vertical girders, each with cross-members but only cross-braced horizontally towards the tail. On the land-planes the lower longitudinal members of the girder ran to the undercarriage; this was not practical on the float-plane so they were replaced by horizontal members running forward from the tail to beyond the wing. These extensions, braced by sloping struts on each side to both of the centre section struts formed a kind of outrigger on which the pilot sat, exposed, just forward of the leading edge. Behind the pilot and mounted on the rear pair of the centre-section struts was an un-cowled, pusher configuration [...] Anzani 6-cylinder radial engine. Long cut-outs from the trailing edges of both wings were needed to clear {{the path of the}} large diameter, two blade propeller. A rectangular tailplane was mounted on a cross member between the upper girders, strengthened by outward <b>diagonal</b> <b>bracing,</b> with broad chord elevator-like surfaces extending beyond. A pair of rectangular rudders were hinged, close together, from this same cross-member.|$|E

2500|$|She {{was paid}} off in 1815 only to be recommissioned in 1817 when she was {{modified}} to carry 76 guns. At the same time her stern was altered and she was given <b>diagonal</b> <b>bracing</b> on the framing introduced by Sir Robert Seppings. In 1825 she sailed from Portsmouth with Rear Admiral Philip Woodehouse as the new commanding officer of the West Indies station. During 1826-27 she [...] circumnavigated the World under Captain William Parker, but bearing the flag of Rear-Admiral Gage, departing from Spithead for India. [...] At Trincomalee Rear-Admiral Gage was replaced by Commodore Sir James Brisbane as the new South Atlantic (Rio de Janeiro) Station commander-in-chief. However, following Commodore Brisbane's death from a contracted tropical disease, Captain Richard Saunders Dundas of the accompanying 6th rate Survey ship HMS Volage took command {{for the rest of}} the voyage which saw Warspite as the first ship of the line to visit Port Jackson in the colony of New South Wales in Australia. Returning to the station with the Malta squadron late in 1828 she was detached to transport Count Capo d'Istria, President of the Greek republic, to various locations around the Eastern Mediterranean while blockading Navarino, Modon and Coron in coordination with the French and Russian allied squadrons. In this capacity it helped to interdict two Egyptian corvettes at Navarino, one suffering substantial damage when it ignored warning shots and was engaged with the main battery. Captain Parker then participated in several conferences with Ibrahim Pasha to negotiate the withdrawal of Egyptian troops from Greece. In 1831 she was at the South American (Rio de Janeiro) station as the flagship of Rear Admiral Sir Thomas Baker, Captain Charles Talbot, at one time contribution towards salvage of HMS Thetis (1817) cargo off Cape Frio in 1830.|$|E
2500|$|Construction of the {{new road}} deck and {{stiffening}} truss of the 1950 span was conducted differently than had been done in Gertie's case. In 1940, the road deck was prefabricated in [...] long sections on the Tacoma tideflats, then barged to the site via tugboats and hoisted into place via gantry cranes installed on the main cable. When construction of the road deck began in early March, workers installed a Chicago boom high above the roadway level, upon which prefabricated stiffening truss assemblies each -by- were hoisted into place. After the deck assemblies were hoisted into place and finished, four traveling derricks were then lifted onto the completed deck sections. [...] After the traveling derricks (called [...] "layleg rigs" [...] by the crew) were assembled and readied, the deck was then assembled {{in a series of}} steps. On the new bridge, the stiffening truss featured a series of outer members called [...] "chords" [...] that formed {{the top and bottom of}} the stiffening truss. These were installed first, then the diagonal and vertical truss members on the sides were installed. Next, an [...] deep stiffening truss [...] "floor beam" [...] perpendicular to the length of the bridge was installed at intervals of [...] (the distance between suspender cables; they were installed at each vertical beam member in the stiffening truss). These floor beams, each [...] wide, would form the upper lateral stiffening mechanism in the deck itself. After the floor beams were installed, at alternate floor beam panel points a set of <b>diagonal</b> <b>bracing</b> struts were installed. Then, a series of lateral bracing struts were installed on the top and bottom of the road deck - that connected to the outer steel chords. Next, a series of eight [...] deep I-beam [...] "stringers" [...] were installed (positioned longitudinally). This was the final steelwork step involved, and the deck was soon raised [...] on each corner to attach the suspender cables and their [...] "jewels" [...] to the vertical stiffening truss members.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper takes Huzhou Baimitang Bridge as an {{engineering}} example, expounds the common diseases of through pre-stressed truss arch bridge and their causes. It uses structure calculation software {{to optimize the}} reinforcement methods of components, such as arch rib, <b>diagonal</b> <b>brace,</b> tie beam, etc. The results show that pasting steel for arch rib, <b>diagonal</b> <b>brace</b> and pasting carbon fiber sheet for tie beam can effectively enhance the stiffness and the carrying capacity of Baimitang Bridge. The reinforcing methods are good for reference of other similar engineering projects...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBolker and Crapo [4] {{studied the}} {{possibilities}} of applying <b>diagonal</b> <b>braces</b> to rigidify a special bar and joint framework, the so called one-story building. Apparently, one of their ultimate goals was to solve the more general problem of the cubic grids. Some partial results towards this end were published in Bolker [2], who characterized the circuits of the describing matroid. However, his result is not completely satisfactory from the algorithmic point of view, since one still cannot decide whether a given set of <b>diagonal</b> <b>braces</b> makes the cubic grid rigid. In the present note we give {{a necessary condition for}} this, using matroid partition algorithm. This result also enables one to efficiently find a minimal set of braces meeting this condition; even an optimal one with respect to a weight function (say, when the costs of the possible <b>diagonal</b> <b>braces</b> are different). Finally we give an example which shows that the condition is not sufficient...|$|R

Special framed shear walls are becoming more common to help buildings meet the requirements of earthquake engineering and wind engineering.|$|E

30|$|In this model, gravity {{loads of}} the above story are ignored to simplify the model and reduce very long {{solvation}} time demanded by the software. <b>Diagonal</b> <b>brace</b> was prestressed by applying 40 -kn tensile force. After installation of brace in frame and using none-shrinkage high-strength mortar {{at the end of}} the FSSP after hardening of mortar the prestress force is released which leads to elongation of <b>diagonal</b> <b>brace</b> and the brace is fitted in the frame. Then lateral force is applied to the model. The model failure mode was brace buckling as it is shown in Fig.  16.|$|R
