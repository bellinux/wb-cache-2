40|$|Genomic <b>DNA</b> <b>blot</b> {{hybridization}} {{is traditionally}} used to demonstrate that, via genetic transformation, foreign genes are integrated into host genomes. However, in large genome species, such as Allium cepa L., {{the use of}} genomic <b>DNA</b> <b>blot</b> hybridization is pushed towards its limits, because a considerable quantity of DNA is needed to obtain enough genome copies for a clear hybridization pattern. Furthermore, genomic <b>DNA</b> <b>blot</b> hybridization is a time-consuming method. Adaptor ligation PCR (AL-PCR) of genomic DNA flanking T-DNA borders does not have these drawbacks {{and seems to be}} an adequate alternative to genomic <b>DNA</b> <b>blot</b> hybridization. Using AL-PCR we proved that T-DNA was integrated into the A. cepa genome of three transgenic lines transformed with Agrobacterium tumefaciens EHA 105 (pCAMBIA 1301). The AL-PCR patterns obtained were specific and reproducible for a given transgenic line. The results showed that T-DNA integration took place and gave insight in the number of T-DNA copies present. Comparison of AL-PCR and previously obtained genomic <b>DNA</b> <b>blot</b> hybridization results pointed towards complex T-DNA integration patterns in some of the transgenic plants. After cloning and sequencing the AL-PCR products, the junctions between plant genomic DNA and the T-DNA insert could be analysed in great detail. For example it was shown that upon T-DNA integration a 66 bp genomic sequence was deleted, and no filler DNA was inserted. Primers located within the left and right flanking genomic DNA in transgenic shallot plants were used to recover the target site of T-DNA integratio...|$|E

40|$|Segmented {{filamentous}} bacteria (SFB) {{have been observed}} in the small intestine of many animals, in humans and in the intestinal content of trouts affected by diarrhea. Some papers report the nonpathogenic nature of these microorganisms, while other reports associate the occurrence of illness {{with the presence of}} SFB. Since SFB cannot be cultured in vitro, they do not have an official taxonomic name: only the provisional status Candidatus and the genus name Arthromitus. Molecular methods have facilitated studies on culture-independent microorganisms. Most of them are based on direct DNA extraction from samples and a subsequent study of 16 S rRNA genes. Two couples of primers were designed for C. arthromitus detection by nested-PCR on DNA extracted from the gut of trouts. Another method was set up to detect Candidatus Arthromitus using a specific probe labeled with digoxigenin. The probe was tested on amplification products and DNA samples using <b>DNA</b> <b>blotting</b> techniques. Both nested-PCR and <b>DNA</b> <b>blotting</b> showed specificity...|$|R

40|$|The proper pairing, recombination, and {{segregation}} of chromosomes are central to meiosis and sexual reproduction. The syn 1 mutation was previously identified as a synaptic mutant in a T-DNA-tagged population of plants. SYN 1 has been isolated and found to exhibit similarity to Schizosaccharomyces pombe RAD 21 and RAD 21 -like proteins, which are required for chromosome condensation and sister chromatid cohesion during mitosis. Plants homozygous for syn 1 are male and female sterile and show defects in chromosome condensation and pairing beginning at leptonema of meiosis I. Fragmentation of the chromosomes was observed at metaphase I. Alternative promoters produced two SYN 1 transcripts. One transcript was expressed at low levels in most tissues, whereas the other was expressed only in prebolting buds. <b>DNA</b> <b>blot</b> analyses suggest that Arabidopsis contains a small RAD 21 gene family. Consistent with the <b>DNA</b> <b>blot</b> data, a second Arabidopsis RAD 21 -like gene has been identified.

40|$|SUMMARY We have {{postulated}} that the catecholamine-synthesizing enzymes tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), dopamine / 3 -hydroxylase (DBH), and phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT) are coded for by similar genes. To analyze the structural relationship of genes coding for these enzymes, we have cloned DNAs complementary (cDNA) to DBH and PNMT messenger RNAs (mRNAs). Using hybrid selection analysis {{to identify the}} cDNA clones positively, we discovered cross-hybridization between DBH cDNA clones and PNMT mRNA and between PNMT cDNA clones and DBH mRNA. Further analysis by RNA blot hybridization revealed that (1) the DBH cDNA probe hybridized predominantly to a 5500 nucleotide mRNA and less strongly to a 1100 nucleotide species, and (2) the PNMT cDNA probe hybridized strongly to the 1100 nucleotide mRNA and weakly to the 5500 nucleotide message. <b>DNA</b> <b>blot</b> hybridization analysis demonstrated that DBH and PNMT cDNA probes hybridized to several common restriction fragments of total cellular DNA. The evidence presented here suggests the existence of homologous gene-coding regions in DBH and PNMT cDNAs. These homologies {{may be the result}} of duplication of a common ancestral gene. <b>DNA</b> <b>blot</b> analysis suggests that these enzymes are coded for by single genes, which may be located in close proximity to each other in the DNA, and points to the existence of either a single gene or linked genes coding for al...|$|E

Some of these clones have been characterized as containing delta-crystallin mRNA coding sequences by genomic <b>DNA</b> <b>blot</b> hybridization and RNA blot hybridizations.

40|$|A 100 -fold DNA {{amplification}} in the CHE gene, coding for serum butyrylcholinesterase (BtChoEase), {{was found}} in a farmer expressing the "silent" CHE phenotype. Individuals homozygous for this gene display a defective serum BtChoEase and are particularly vulnerable to poisoning by agricultural organophosphorous insecticides, to which all members of this family had long been exposed. <b>DNA</b> <b>blot</b> hybridization with regional BtChoEase cDNA probes suggested that the amplification was most intense in regions encoding central sequences within BtChoEase cDNA, whereas distal sequences were amplified to a much lower extent. This is in agreement with the "onion skin" model, based on amplification of genes in cultured cells and primary tumors. The amplification was absent in the grandparents but present at the same extent in one of their sons and in a grandson, with similar <b>DNA</b> <b>blot</b> hybridization patterns. In situ hybridization experiments localized the amplified sequences to the long arm of chromosome 3, close to the site where we previously mapped the CHE gene. Altogether, these observations suggest that the initial amplification event occurred early in embryogenesis, spermatogenesis, or oogenesis, where the CHE gene is intensely active and where cholinergic functioning was indicated to be physiologically necessary. Our findings demonstrate a de novo amplification in apparently healthy individuals within an autosomal gene producing a target protein to an inhibitor. Its occurrence in two generations from a family under prolonged exposure to parathion indicates that organophosphorous poisons may be implicated in previously unforeseen long-term ecological effects...|$|E

Simplification and cost containment were achieved by using Whatman no. 541 filter papers instead of nitrocellulose, by minimizing the concentration of proteinase K (an expensive but necessary reagent used to pretreat the colony blots prior to hybridization with biotin-labeled DNA probes) and by reusing hybridization solution containing labeled probe DNA. After exposing the colony blots to lysing solution and steam, followed by lysozyme (1. 5 mg/ml), sucrose (25 %), and proteinase K (10 micrograms/ml) treatments, biotinylated probes were used to detect enterotoxigenic, enteropathogenic, enterohemorrhagic, diffuse adherence, and enteroinvasive categories of diarrhea-causing E. coli {{with a high level}} of sensitivity and specificity.
