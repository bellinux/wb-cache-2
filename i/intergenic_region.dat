50|$|In {{regards to}} the {{replication}} and transcription of non-segmented NSV, the genes of these NSV {{are made up of}} three regulatory regions: a gene end signal, an <b>intergenic</b> <b>region,</b> and a gene start signal. One example of gene end signals are in a specific virus called the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) contains gene end signals that are highly conservative. The <b>intergenic</b> <b>region</b> is highly variable and consists of conserved dinucleotide, trinucleotide, or regions of up to 143 nucleotides. The various lengths of the intergenic regions correlate with transcriptional attenuation, however diverse intergenic regions do not alter the gene expression. The gene start signals are highly specific as the first three nucleotides are critical for the gene expression.|$|E

40|$|Background: Trypanosoma cruzi is {{the causal}} agent of Chagas Disease. Recently, the genomes of {{representative}} strains from two major evolutionary lineages were sequenced, allowing {{the construction of}} a detailed genetic diversity map for this important parasite. However this map is focused on coding regions of the genome, leaving a vast space of regulatory regions uncharacterized in terms of their evolutionary conservation and/or divergence. Methodology: Using data from the hybrid CL Brener and Sylvio X 10 genomes (from the TcVI and TcI Discrete Typing Units, respectively), we identified <b>intergenic</b> <b>regions</b> that share a common evolutionary ancestry, and are present in both CL Brener haplotypes (TcII-like and TcIII-like) and in the TcI genome; as well as <b>intergenic</b> <b>regions</b> that were conserved in only two of the three genomes/haplotypes analyzed. The genetic diversity in these regions was characterized in terms of the accumulation of indels and nucleotide changes. Principal Findings: Based on this analysis we have identified i) a core of highly conserved <b>intergenic</b> <b>regions,</b> which remained essentially unchanged in independently evolving lineages; ii) <b>intergenic</b> <b>regions</b> that show high diversity in spite of still retaining their corresponding upstream and downstream coding sequences; iii) a number of defined sequence motifs that are shared by a number of unrelated <b>intergenic</b> <b>regions.</b> A fraction of indels explains the diversification of some <b>intergenic</b> <b>regions</b> by the expansion/contraction of microsatellite-like repeats...|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{mitochondrial}} (mt) genomes of sponges {{possess a}} variety of features, which appear to be intermediate between those of Eumetazoa and non-metazoan opisthokonts. Among these features {{is the presence of}} long <b>intergenic</b> <b>regions,</b> which are common in other eukaryotes, but generally absent in Eumetazoa. Here we analyse poriferan mitochondrial <b>intergenic</b> <b>regions,</b> paying particular attention to repetitive sequences within them. In this context we introduce the mitochondrial genome of Ircinia strobilina (Lamarck, 1816; Demospongiae: Dictyoceratida) and compare it with mtDNA of other sponges. Results: Mt genomes of dictyoceratid sponges are identical in gene order and content but display major differences in size and organization of <b>intergenic</b> <b>regions.</b> An even higher degree of diversity in the structure of <b>intergenic</b> <b>regions</b> was found among different orders of demosponges. One interesting observation made from such comparisons was of what appears to be recurrent invasions of sponge mitochondrial genomes by repetitive hairpin-forming elements, which cause large genome size differences even among closely related taxa. These repetitive hairpin-forming elements are structurally and compositionally divergent and display a scattered distribution throughout various groups of demosponges. Conclusion: Large <b>intergenic</b> <b>regions</b> of poriferan mt genomes are targets for insertions of repetitive hairpin- forming elements, similar to the ones found in non-metazoan opisthokonts. Such elements were likely present in some lineages early in animal mitochondrial genome evolution but were subsequently lost during the reduction of <b>intergenic</b> <b>regions,</b> which occurred in the Eumetazoa lineage after the split of Porifera. Porifera acquired their elements in several independent events. Patterns of their intra-genomic dispersal {{can be seen in the}} mt genome of Vaceletia sp. ...|$|R

40|$|How many intergenically encoded non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are {{expressed}} during various developmental stages in Drosophila? Previous analyses {{in one or}} a few developmental stages indicated abundant expression of intergenic ncRNAs. However, some reported that ncRNAs have been recently falsified, and, in general, the false positive rate for ncRNA detection is unknown. In this report, we used reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR), a more robust method, to detect ncRNAs from the <b>intergenic</b> <b>regions</b> that {{are expressed}} in four major developmental stages (6 – 8 h embryo, 20 – 22 h embryo, larvae and adult). We tested 1027 regions, ∼ 10 % of all <b>intergenic</b> <b>regions,</b> and detected transcription by RT–PCR. The results from 18 342 RT–PCR experiments revealed evidence for transcription in 72. 7 % of <b>intergenic</b> <b>regions</b> in the developmental process. The early developmental stage appears to be associated with more abundant ncRNAs than later developmental stages. In the early stage, we detected 43. 6 % of <b>intergenic</b> <b>regions</b> that encode transcripts in the triplicate RT–PCR experiments, yielding an estimate of 5006 <b>intergenic</b> <b>regions</b> in the entire genome likely encoding ncRNAs.

40|$|We {{examined}} {{the abundance of}} microsatellites with repeated unit lengths of 1 – 6 base pairs in several eukaryotic taxonomic groups: primates, rodents, other mammals, nonmammalian vertebrates, arthropods, Caenorhabditis elegans, plants, yeast, and other fungi. Distribution of simple sequence repeats was compared between exons, introns, and <b>intergenic</b> <b>regions.</b> Tri- and hexanucleotide repeats prevail in protein-coding exons of all taxa, whereas the dependence of repeat abundance {{on the length of}} the repeated unit shows a very different pattern as well as taxon-specific variation in <b>intergenic</b> <b>regions</b> and introns. Although it is known that coding and noncoding regions differ significantly in their microsatellite distribution, in addition we could demonstrate characteristic differences between <b>intergenic</b> <b>regions</b> and introns. We observed striking relative abundance of (CCG) n•(CGG) n trinucleotide repeats in <b>intergenic</b> <b>regions</b> of all vertebrates, in contrast to the almost complete lack of this motif from introns. Taxon-specific variation could also be detected in the frequency distributions of simple sequence motifs.

This genomic feature was demonstrated for many prokaryotic genomes. The Escherichia coli sequences display the period close to 11 base pairs.
