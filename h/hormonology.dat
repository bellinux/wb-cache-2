40|$|The paper {{begins with}} {{a review of the}} concept of {{neoplastic}} progressions in plant tissue cultures, with the progressive acquisition of (a relative) independence to the hormones auxins and cytokinins. It takes advantage of the deviations of carbon and nitrogen metabolisms shown in these particular cases, to illustrate the interdependence with the metabolisms of the hormones (and increased sensitivities to) polyamines and ethylene. These results provide additional examples of the changing concepts in <b>hormonology...</b>|$|E

The aim {{of this study was to}} compare in vitro the anti-Candida effect of iodide versus thiocyanate used as lactoperoxidase substrate to prevent Candida biofilms development. Candida albicans ATCC 10231 susceptibility upon both peroxidase systems was tested in three different experimental designs: (i) in a liquid culture medium, (ii) in an interface model between solid culture medium and gel containing the enzymic systems, (iii) in a biofilm model onto titanium and acrylic resin. Yeast growth in liquid medium was monitored by turbidimetry at 600 nm. Material-adherent yeast biomass was evaluated by the tetrazolium salt MTT method. The iodide-peroxidase system has been shown to inhibit Candida biofilm formation at lower substrate concentrations (~ 200 fold less H 2 O 2 donor) and for longer incubation periods than the thiocyanate-peroxidase system. In conclusion, efficiency of lactoperoxidase-generated OI- to prevent C. albicans biofilm development allows refining iodine antifungal use in ex vivo conditions.

For this purpose, titanium (powder or foil) was suspended in Sabouraud liquid medium inoculated with C. albicans ATCC 10231. After continuous stirring for 2 &ndash; 21 days at room temperature, the supernatant was monitored by turbidimetry at 600 nm and titanium washed {{three times in}} sterile Sabouraud broth. Using the tetrazolium salt MTT-formazan assay, the titanium-adherent fungal biomass was measured as 7. 50 &plusmn; 0. 60 &times; 106 blastoconidia per gram of titanium powder (n = 30) and 0. 50 &plusmn; 0. 04 &times; 106 blastoconidia per cm&sup 2; of titanium foil (n = 12). The presence of yeast {{on the surface of}} titanium was confirmed by microscopy both on fresh preparations and after calcofluor white staining. However, in the presence of peroxidase systems (lactoperoxidase with substrates such as hydrogen peroxide donor, iodide, or thiocyanate), Candida growth in both planktonic and attached phases appeared to be inhibited. Moreover, this study demonstrates the possible partition of peroxidase systems between titanium material (peroxidase-precoated) and liquid environment (containing peroxidase substrates) to limit C. albicans biofilm formation.

However, its potential to induce remission of major depressive episodes, the optimal clinical target for an antidepressant drug, is a matter of concern. Indeed, only one out of four double-blind randomized controlled trials show higher remission rates with pioglitazone than with control treatments. Hence, the main aim {{of this study was to}} perform a meta-analysis of the efficacy of pioglitazone for the treatment of MDE, focusing on remission rates. Methods: Four double-blind randomized controlled trials, comprising 161 patients with an MDE, were included in this meta-analysis. Pioglitazone was studied either alone (one study) or as add-on therapy to conventional treatments (antidepressant drugs or lithium salts). It was compared either to placebo (three studies) or to metformin (one study). Remission was defined by a Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score < 8 after treatment. Results: Pioglitazone could induce higher remission rates than control treatments (27 % versus 10 %, I 2 = 17. 3 %, fixed-effect model: odds ratio [OR] = 3. 3, 95 % confidence interval [95 % CI; 1. 4; 7. 8], P= 0. 008). The OR was even higher in the subgroup of patients with major depressive disorder (n= 80; 23 % versus 8 %, I 2 = 0. 0 %; fixed-effect model: OR = 5. 9, 95 % CI [1. 6; 22. 4], P= 0. 009) and in the subgroup of patients without metabolic comorbidities (n= 84; 33 % versus 10 %, I 2 = 0. 0 %; fixed-effect model: OR = 5. 1, 95 % CI [1. 5; 17. 9], P= 0. 01). As compared to control treatments, results suggest six patients would need to be treated with pioglitazone in order to achieve the possibility of one more remission. Conclusion: Pioglitazone, either alone or as add-on therapy to conventional treatments, could induce remission of MDE, suggesting that drugs with PPAR-γ agonist properties may be true and clinically relevant antidepressants, even in patients without metabolic comorbidities.

40|$|Sepsis {{has been}} defined as a {{systemic}} response to an infection. With an incidence of 3 per 1000 population per year or about 750 000 cases a year, this syndrome ranks as the 10 th leading cause of death in the United States (1). Increasing severity of sepsis correlates with increasing mortality, which rises from 30 - 40 % for severe sepsis up to 40 - 60 % for septic shock. This thesis examines the effectiveness of adjunctive therapies, including activated protein C, hypercapnia and acidosis, and sodium selenite, in a clinically relevant ovine model of septic shock. The results from these studies can provide valuable information for future clinical trials on sepsis. This thesis is divided into four sections: 1) sepsis overview; 2) an autologous fecal peritonitis model in sheep and its evaluation; 3) the series of studies on adjunctive therapeutics; and 4) ongoing studies and future perspective. In the first section, a broad overview gives a rough introduction to delineate many aspects of sepsis syndrome such as terminology, etiology, epidemiology, pathophysiology and current guidelines for management. Hemodynamics in sepsis are especially elaborated since these are major observations throughout the studies presented later. In the second section, the general characteristics of the sepsis models used in this thesis are elucidated. Data on hemodynamics, lung mechanics, gas exchange, etc. are presented to feature the ovine peritonitis model. The results of laboratory examinations for hematology, coagulation, bacteriology, biochemistry and <b>hormonology</b> are also presented. And then, I review currently used sepsis models with regards to their advantages and disadvantages. The third section discusses three studies with their objectives, the methods used, the major findings, and the potential clinical implications. 9 1) Beneficial effects of recombinant human activated protein C in experimental septic shock. Activated protein C has a multitude of beneficial effects in severe sepsis and septic shock, including anti-inflammation, anti-coagulation, profibrinolysis, anti-apoptosis and endothelial protection. A clinical Phase III trial demonstrated that the administration of recombinant human activated protein C improved survival in patients with severe sepsis. However, doubts on the protective effects of activated protein C have persisted and been refueled by the recently published negative trials in less severely ill patients and in children. In the light of these ambiguities and uncertainties, we reinvestigated the effects of activated protein C in experimental septic shock. 2) Acute hypercapnia improves indices of tissue oxygenation more than dobutamine in septic shock. Hepercapnia has been found to possess beneficial effects in diverse acute inflammatory states independent of protective lung mechanics. To prove the hypothesis that acute hypercapnia has similar or superior hemodynamic effects to those of a dobutamine infusion, which may be particularly relevant in the presence of hemodynamic instability associated with respiratory failure, we investigated the effects of hypercapnia, which induced by inspiring extrinsic carbon dioxide in experimental septic shock. 3) High bolus dose of sodium selenite prolongs survival in an ovine model of septic shock. Selenite has both pro- and anti-oxidant effects. The administration of high dose sodium selenite may improve survival in septic shock patients. The benefit may be greater with the administration of a bolus (to achieve higher concentrations) rather than a continuous infusion. To test this hypothesis, we examined the effects of a high dose bolus administration of sodium selenite in experimental septic shock. The fourth and final section talks about currently ongoing studies and offers some perspective on future direction. Doctorat en Sciences médicalesinfo:eu-repo/semantics/nonPublishe...|$|E
