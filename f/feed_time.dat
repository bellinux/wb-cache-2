40|$|According to the evolution, {{the horse}} has {{developed}} to an herbivore {{that lives in}} herds on the plains. Despite the domestication the natural behavior of the horse has not changed. The gastro-intestinal tract is adapted to processing grass from grazing approximately 14 - 16 hours of the day. In the natural the horse doesn't make longer feeding gaps than three to four hours. If possible, ad libitum feeding of forage to the horse would be preferred to allow the horse to follow its own rhythm and begin to feed when it still have some feed in their digestive system. In new housing systems, such as Active Stable™, the feed is rationed by controlling the <b>feeding</b> <b>time</b> of roughage. Consequently, we need {{more information on the}} time horses spend to feed a set amount of roughage. Problems that can arise when the time is overestimated are fatness and laminitis or if the <b>feeding</b> <b>time</b> is underestimated it can lead to ulcers, stress and stereotypies. The aim of the study is to measure the horse individual <b>feeding</b> <b>time</b> of roughage {{to find a way to}} give the horses in active group housing system the right feeding rations. The study has two main questions. How much do the <b>feeding</b> <b>times</b> differ between individuals and within individual? How large variations of <b>feeding</b> <b>times</b> are there between horses housed in an Active group system compared to horses housed in single boxes? The study has three hypotheses. There are variations of the <b>feeding</b> <b>times</b> within an individual. There is variation between the <b>feeding</b> <b>times</b> of different individuals. Horses in the active group housing system have longer <b>feeding</b> <b>time</b> than the horses in the single boxes. In total a number of 20 warmblood geldings were studied; ten horses from an Active Stable™ and ten from individual boxes. The 20 horses were divided into three sub-groups of six horses in the first two groups and eight horses in the last group. The measurements were performed on eight days for each group. Each group with horses stood lined up beside each other, and then two of the horses got a bag of three kilo haylage each. The feedings times were clocked on each individual during 20 minutes. After ten minutes the haybags were weighed and then the bags were put back to the horses for the remaining ten minutes. The range of <b>feeding</b> <b>time</b> within an individual varied from 1. 1 minutes to 43. 5 minutes. There were a wider range within the group of horses in boxes than the Active Stable™. <b>Feeding</b> <b>time</b> varied between the individuals. For both groups <b>feeding</b> <b>time</b> varied during the 20 minutes so that the first 10 minute period were significantly shorter than the second ten minute period. Horses in the Active group have according to the results a shorter <b>feeding</b> <b>time</b> compered to horses in single boxes. There are significant differences (p< 0. 015) between horses in active group and horses in single boxes. In conclusion, there were variations in the <b>feeding</b> <b>time</b> between individuals per kg dry matter. The rate of feeding was faster in the beginning of a given ratio. Horses in active group housing had a shorter <b>feeding</b> <b>time</b> compered to horses in boxes. The hypothesis "there are variations within individuals" and "between the individuals feeding time" were accepted. The hypothesis "horses in the active group housing system have longer <b>feeding</b> <b>time</b> between the horses in the single boxes" could neither be accepted or rejected even though there was a significant difference.

40|$|Partial Feed {{simulating}} {{moving bed}} (SMB) {{has proved to}} be more efficient in binary separation performance (purity, recovery, productivity) because of its two additional degrees of freedom, namely feed length and <b>feed</b> <b>time,</b> as compared to classical SMB process.

In addition, the effect of mode of operation (early or late introduction of increase in number of feed length in the cycle) on product purity and recovery is also investigated. Furthermore, the binary separation system is designed with the safety margin method and the optimum operating parameters for simulation are calculated with triangle theory. Finally, a new strategy with Partial Feed is developed, showing improved separation performance relative to the basic four-zone SMB with regard to extract stream purity and recovery.

40|$|The 21 cm multibeam {{receiver}} on the Parkes telescope {{has been}} used for many neutral hydrogen (HI) imaging projects, for example, the HI Parkes All Sky Survey (HIPASS) and the Southern Galactic Plane Survey. In many experiments to date, basic radio frequency interference (RFI) rejection has been accomplished on a per-feed basis, using the median statistic throughout the processing, which eliminates outliers in a nonparametric fashion at the expense of increased statistical noise. The classic 21 cm baseline ripple problem has been largely ignored, except for the subtraction of a coarse template which is calculated independently of <b>feed,</b> <b>time,</b> telescope elevation, and receiver rotation. The ripple is especially strong during the daytime, when the Sun acts as a broadband RFI noise source. Here we report on new techniques that we are developing, for application to raw, postcorrelation multibeam data, which handle RFI rejection and ripple suppression in more sophisticated ways. RFI can be identified by the presence of coincident outliers on multiple feeds, by sharp increases or decreases in flux time series that are inconsistent with a beam-smeared sky, and by the presence of highly polarized flux. We present our progress with this approach and highlight some remaining difficulties. We also present a novel technique for modeling the variation during telescope scans of 21 cm baseline ripple caused by stray continuum radiation undergoing multiple reflections in the telescope cavity and demonstrate its application to HIPASS data; this may increase the usefulness of daytime spectral line observing...|$|E
40|$|Male {{and female}} {{interests}} can differ profoundly regarding {{quality and quantity}} of mates. Especially in promiscuous mating systems, males often inflict costs on females that may precipitate in negative fitness consequences. In reality, however, discerning between female costs arising from a sexual conflict and costs arising from female mate choice is not trivial. In livebearing fishes, for example, costs of male sexual harassment are often quantified as female <b>feeding</b> <b>time</b> reductions, but female <b>feeding</b> <b>times</b> may also be affected by competitive interactions and the willingness of females to interact with a particular mate (i. e., mate choice). Using the tropical live-bearer Poecilia mexicana as a model, we manipulated male and female nutritional state and measured focal females' <b>feeding</b> <b>times</b> in presence of another female as well as in presence of males of varying quality. Consistent with other studies quantifying effects of male harassment, female <b>feeding</b> <b>times</b> were negatively affected by sexually active males. Also, females were feeding more in presence of starved males than in presence of well-fed males. In subsequent dichotomous choice tests, females preferred to associate with well-fed females. These results are not consistent with the sexual conflict hypothesis: If the reduced female <b>feeding</b> <b>time</b> in presence of a well-fed male were solely a cost imposed by the male, females would be expected to avoid such males in a choice situation. Consequently, our study suggests that both male sexual harassment and active female choice simultaneously affect female <b>feeding</b> <b>times</b> in livebearing fishes.

40|$|Abstract Background Feeding {{behavior}} {{study is}} important for animal husbandry and production. However, few studies were conducted on the feeding behavior and their relationship with feeding efficiency in Pekin ducks. In order to investigate the feeding behavior and their relationship with feed efficiency and other economic traits in Pekin ducks, we selected 358 male Pekin ducks and recorded feeding information between 3 to 6 wk of age using automatic electronic feeders, and compared the feeding behavior under different residual feed intake (RFI) levels. Results We observed that total <b>feed</b> <b>time,</b> daily feed intake and feed intake per meal had strong positive correlations with feed efficiency traits; moreover, strong correlation between feed intake per meal and body weight was found (R= 0. 32, 0. 36). Daily feeding rate meal and meal duration had weak correlations with feed efficiency (R= 0. 14 ~ 0. 15). The phenotypic correlation of between-meal pauses, with feed efficiency was not observed. When daily changes were analyzed, high RFI ducks had the highest feed consumption over all times, and obvious differences in daily visits were found among different RFI level animals during the middle period; these differences were magnified with age, {{but there was no}} difference in daily meal number. Moreover, our data indicate that high RFI birds mainly take their meals at the edge of the population enclosure, where they are more susceptible to environmental interference. Conclusions Overall, this study suggests that the general feeding behaviors can be accurately measured using automatic electronic feeders and certain feeding behaviors in Pekin ducks are associated with improved feed efficiency...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This {{paper is}} proposing a {{solution}} to the rapid oscillation of the current which happened due to the cyclic operation of the batch sugar centrifugal machines. The current oscillation affects the stability of electrical generation produce by steam turbine alternators at Factory. The proposed solution focuses on sequencing these machines. Fuzzy logic control and Matlab Simulink are used to design a model of three batch sugar machines, the real time data is taken from Broadbent C 46 M batch centrifuge. Organizing the operation of these machines with sequence control is done by selecting the suitable delay time between machines. Two parameters in fuzzy logic control are used to obtain the desired delay time, the first parameter depends on the previous machine spinning time duration and the second depends on the time between the previous machine permission times to the current machine requesting permission from sequence control. When the default values of <b>feed</b> <b>time,</b> spin time & plough time are taken equal to (20 s, 40 s & 20 s) respectively to and be identical for three machines, the total current oscillation has been minimized to 43. 75 % (compared with peak oscillation of only one machine) and in repeated form, and the total current of the three machines is being less than the current of one machine.

40|$|Excellent feed {{management}} {{is one of}} the main drivers to achieve high production outputs in Precision Dairy Farming (PLF). In this context, increased automation offers possibilities to serve fresh feed at a higher frequency to motivate cows to have more meals and eat more feed. A trial was set up in a commercial dairy herd where each of two experimental treatments was applied twice to two groups of lactating cows. The treatments included (1) partially mixed ration (PMR) divided into six servings of equal size per day (one every four hours) and (2) PMR divided into twelve servings of equal size per day (one every two hours). Every experimental period lasted seven days and was preceded by a seven days transition period with the new feeding out frequency applied. Mixed models were used to evaluate the effect of the experimental treatments on three feed event-based feeding behaviours and three meal-based feeding behaviours, dry matter and energy intake, daily milk yield and number of milkings. In this study, feeding the PMR divided into twelve servings per day resulted in a small but significant increase in average daily feed intake per cow. The feed was consumed during more feed events and meals, however, of shorter duration and shorter total <b>feed</b> <b>time.</b> In short, cows ate more in less time with twelve feed deliveries.

40|$|International audienceAn {{original}} and fully automated liquid feeding pilot {{has been designed}} and implemented to monitor and optimize the fermentation process of liquid feed for pigs at a pre-industrial scale. The installation was designed and instrumented to continuously record the temperature, pH and redox potential (Eh) during the fermentation course of wheat flour based feed mixed with water in a 1 : 2. 5 (w:w) ratio. Single and multiple batches experiments were carried-out with feed inoculation achieved by leftover or with a selected culture of lactic acid producing bacteria (LAB). Physicochemical and microbiological characteristics of the fermentation process which include lactic and acetic acids and ethanol concentrations, enumerations of lactic acid producing bacteria, yeasts, total coliforms and Escherichia coli, were monitored and analyzed {{as a function of}} the main feed control factors: incubation time, operating temperature, <b>feed</b> <b>time</b> schedule and percentage of leftover. From batch experiments, it was observed that increasing the operating temperature from 15 to 30 °C, accelerates the rate of fermentation by reducing about 5 – 6 -folds the process latency and the duration to reach a pH value of 4. 0 which is considered as optimal to achieve biosafety. Nevertheless, this does not prevent the blooming of coliforms as their counts increases from 4 to 6 log 10 CFU/mL within 24 h. In opposite, multiple batches are proved to be effective in both accelerating the fermentation rates and reducing the survival of Coliform bacteria in fermented liquid feed (FLF). Feed fermented at 25 °C during 24 -h cycles with a 22 % leftover ensures the prominence of LAB strains over yeasts with a population level that stabilizes at around 9 log 10 CFU/mL (vs. 7 log 10 CFU/mL for single batches), a lactic acid production up to 35 g/kg dry matter (DM) and a pH value between 5 and 3. 5 throughout the period. Concomitantly, total Coliforms number decreases from 7. 5 to 2. 2 log 10 CFU/mL within 72 h whereas E. coli became undetectable beyond 48 h. Addition of a starter culture (Pediococcus acidilactici, Bactocell®) at 9 log 10 CFU/kg DM at the initial stage of FLF production reduces 25 – 35 times the total coliforms and E. coli counts. No significant differences in the amounts of organic compounds produced by the microflora as compared to the control FLF after 80 h nor in the microbial levels are observed. It is concluded that sequences of fermentation cycles allows, in a given temperature range, establishing a positive, robust, microbial ecosystem...|$|E

During a period of heat stress (34 to 36 °C), two feeding periods were {{used to measure the}} impact of <b>feeding</b> <b>time</b> on reproductive performance of Japanese quail (Coturnix coturnix japonica) between 44 and 60 wk of age.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{investigate}} the effect of different <b>feeding</b> <b>times</b> (2, 4, and 6 h) and organic loading rates (3, 6 and 12 gCOD l(- 1) day(- 1)) on the performance of an anaerobic sequencing batch reactor containing immobilized biomass, as well as to verify the minimum amount of alkalinity that can be added to the influent. The reactor, in which mixing was achieved by recirculation of the liquid phase, was maintained at 30 +/- 1 A degrees C, possessed 2. 5 l reactional volume and treated 1. 5 l cheese whey in 8 -h cycles. Results showed that the effect of <b>feeding</b> <b>time</b> on reactor performance was more pronounced at higher values of organic loading rates (OLR). During operation at an OLR of 3 gCOD l(- 1) day(- 1), change in <b>feeding</b> <b>time</b> did not affect efficiency of organic matter removal from the reactor. At an OLR of 6 gCOD l(- 1) day(- 1), reactor efficiency improved in relation to the lower loading rate and tended to drop at longer <b>feeding</b> <b>times.</b> At an OLR of 12 gCOD l(- 1) day(- 1) the reactor showed to depend more on feeding time; higher <b>feeding</b> <b>times</b> resulted in a decrease in reactor efficiency. Under all conditions shock loads of 24 gCOD l(- 1) day(- 1) caused an increase in acids concentration in the effluent. However, despite this increase, the reactor regained stability readily and alkalinity supplied to the influent showed to be sufficient to maintain pH close to neutral during operation. Regardless of applied OLR, operation with <b>feeding</b> <b>time</b> of 2 h was which provided improved stability and rendered the process less susceptible to shock loads.

40|$|We {{present data}} on feeding {{patterns}} in Avahi laniger and compare these data to temporal variations in leaf chemistry. Because A. laniger {{is one of}} the smallest folivorous primates and has a monogastric stomach, we hypothesized that this lemur would dis-play behavioural adaptations to a leaf-based diet by scheduling <b>feeding</b> <b>times</b> when leaves were of highest quality. Data were collected from May to August 2004 at the Va-toharanana site in Ranomafana National Park, Madagascar. A. laniger fed during diff er-ent time periods despite leaf carbohydrate and protein concentrations exhibiting little variation throughout the night. Although tannin concentrations exhibited temporal fl uctuations, they did not covary with A. laniger <b>feeding</b> <b>times.</b> We suggest that A. laniger <b>feeding</b> <b>times</b> cannot be explained entirely by variations in leaf chemistry.
