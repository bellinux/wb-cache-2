Many gatehouses are strictly utilitarian, but especially in the nineteenth century, some were very elaborate.|$|R
50|$|Like their Chinese counterparts, the Cambodian communists {{had great}} {{faith in the}} inventive power and the {{technical}} aptitude of the masses, and they constantly published reports of peasants' adapting old mechanical parts to new uses. Similarly to Mao's regime, which had attempted unsuccessfully {{to build a new}} steel industry based on backyard furnaces during the Great Leap Forward, the Khmer Rouge sought to move industry to the countryside. Significantly, the seal of Democratic Kampuchea displayed not only sheaves of rice and <b>irrigation</b> <b>sluices,</b> but also a factory with smokestacks.|$|R

50|$|A {{penstock}} (fr. conduite forcée) is a <b>sluice</b> <b>or</b> gate or {{intake structure}} that controls water flow, or an enclosed pipe that delivers water to hydro turbines and sewerage systems. The term is {{inherited from the}} earlier technology of mill ponds and watermills.|$|R
50|$|Once placer gold is discovered, {{the gold}} pan is usually {{replaced}} by <b>sluices</b> <b>or</b> mechanical devices to wash greater volumes of material. Discovery of placer gold has often resulted in discovery of hardrock gold deposits when the placers are traced to their sources.|$|R

50|$|An early {{method of}} {{indigenous}} mining was the Lombong Siam, meaning Siamese mines. Malay miners used ground <b>sluicing</b> <b>or</b> the lampan method by cutting ditches {{from the nearest}} river. In the nineteenth century, Mandailing migrants from Sumatra were observed using the tabuk mine, which is an excavated pit from which water is removed by cantilevered baskets.|$|R

50|$|The HvB {{is named}} after a former <b>sluice</b> <b>or</b> locks between the River Amstel and the former Zuiderzee (now IJsselmeer). This name was chosen because this tower was {{original}} used as the central entrance-tower. All incoming prisoners were housed here before being placed {{in one of the}} remaining towers. Demersluis could thus be seen as a sluice between the outside world and the (rest of the) prison.|$|R

60|$|In all places, and at all times, gold, {{probably}} the metal first used by man, has been {{worked in the}} same way. This is a fair evidence of that instinctive faculty which produces a general resemblance of rude stone-implements from England to Australia. There are six methods for 'getting' the precious metal--surfacing <b>or</b> washing; shallow-sinking; <b>sluicing,</b> <b>or</b> removing the earth through natural and artificial channels; deep sinking; tunnelling, and quartz-mining.|$|R

50|$|A typical set of {{outlet works}} begins in an intake structure, {{which is usually}} a canal or intake tower. A {{regulating}} gate <b>or</b> <b>valve</b> controls water flow into the pipes of the outlet works, which discharge downstream into a stilling basin or directly into the river.The inlets of the outlet works may consist of either gates <b>or</b> <b>valves,</b> <b>or</b> be composed of a more primitive system of stoplogs. Inlets may also contain a series of other devices for different purposes, including trash racks and fish screens.|$|R

5000|$|Seifengabel: {{a type of}} fork, used open-cast tin mining, {{similar to}} a pitchfork. A washer (Seifner) {{diverted}} streams in order to wash out the granules of tin ore present in surface layers, a process called streaming or hushing. The fork was used to throw clumps of earth into the <b>sluice</b> <b>or</b> channel used. The names of the German towns of Seiffen (= [...] "streaming") and Graupen (= [...] "granules") were derived from this activity.|$|R

5|$|When {{repairs to}} Craven Sluices were {{necessary}} in 1684, {{the water was}} temporarily diverted into Scots Float Channel. This worked well, and a regulating penn was built, so that water could be routed to Craven <b>Sluices</b> <b>or</b> Scots Float. Knock Sluice was built below the Appledore Sluice in 1686, and land above it was reclaimed. In 1696, New Knock Sluice was built, close to Craven Sluices, and the sea was finally excluded from the Wittersham Levels.|$|R

50|$|Valve gear was {{a fertile}} field of invention, with {{probably}} several hundred variations devised over the years. However, {{only a small}} number of these saw any widespread use. They can be divided into those that drove the standard reciprocating valves (whether piston <b>valves</b> <b>or</b> slide <b>valves),</b> those used with poppet valves, and stationary engine trip gears used with semi-rotary Corliss <b>valves</b> <b>or</b> drop <b>valves.</b>|$|R
