5|$|A {{metalloid}} is any {{chemical element}} which has properties in between those of metals and nonmetals, or {{that has a}} mixture of them. There is neither a standard definition of a metalloid nor complete agreement on the elements appropriately classified as such. <b>Despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> of specificity, the term remains in use {{in the literature of}} chemistry.|$|E
5|$|Critics have derided {{the novel}} for being {{derivative}} of J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings. Some have accused Brooks of lifting the entire plot {{and many of}} his characters directly from Lord of the Rings; others have praised its execution <b>despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> of originality.|$|E
5|$|<b>Despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> {{of convincing}} {{evidence}} of toxicity of thiomersal when {{used as a}} vaccine preservative, the USPHS and AAP determined that thiomersal should be removed from vaccines as a purely precautionary measure. This action {{was based on the}} precautionary principle, which assumes that there is no harm in exercising caution even if it later turns out to be unnecessary. The CDC and AAP reasoned that <b>despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> of evidence of significant harm in the use of thiomersal in vaccines, the removal of this preservative would increase the public confidence in the safety of vaccines. Although thiomersal was largely removed from routine infant vaccines by summer 2001 in the U.S., some vaccines continue to contain non-trace amounts of thiomersal, mainly in multi-dose vaccines targeted against influenza and tetanus.|$|E

Unfortunately, the central issue regarding <b>the</b> <b>lacking</b> water quantity was not solved by that time. Therefore, the newly installed pipelines did not continuously convey water; some even were never used since the system’s commissioning.|$|R
5|$|<b>Despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> {{of genuine}} opposition, the liberalized {{election}} format allowed for various power struggles {{to be played}} out, primarily between the communist party candidates.

5|$|With the Italian {{victory at}} Tug Argan, the {{position}} of British forces in Somaliland was compromised, and colonial authorities were forced to initiate a naval evacuation of the garrison form Berbera.

5|$|Jacques Cartier {{first brought}} cabbage to the Americas in 1541–42, {{and it was}} {{probably}} planted by the early English colonists, <b>despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> of written evidence of its existence there until the mid-17th century. By the 18th century, it was commonly planted by both colonists and native American Indians. Cabbage seeds traveled to Australia in 1788 with the First Fleet, and were planted the same year on Norfolk Island. It became a favorite vegetable of Australians by the 1830s and was frequently seen at the Sydney Markets.|$|E

5|$|Since 1996, {{the alpine}} pika has been rated {{a species of}} least concern on the IUCN Red List of Endangered Species. This is because it is widespread, with no known {{population}} decline. <b>Despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> of data relating to its current population state, it {{is thought to have}} a stable trend, with some isolated populations exhibiting some variation. It has been regionally red-listed in China and Mongolia as a species of least concern, and about 12% of its population in Mongolia is found in protected areas.|$|E
5|$|Some of the {{earliest}} depictions of Jesus at the Dura-Europos church are firmly dated to before 256. Thereafter, <b>despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> of biblical references or historical records, {{a wide range of}} depictions of Jesus appeared during the last two millennia, often influenced by cultural settings, political circumstances and theological contexts. As in other Early Christian art, {{the earliest}} depictions date to the late 2nd or early 3rd century, and surviving images are found especially in the Catacombs of Rome.|$|E

5|$|Andrew Peck also {{considers}} the Slender Man {{to be an}} authentic form of folklore and notes its similarity to emergent forms of offline legend performance. Peck suggests that digital folklore performance extends the dynamics of face-to-face performance in several notable ways, such as by occurring asynchronously, encouraging imitation and personalization while also allowing perfect replication, combining elements of oral, written, and visual communication, and generating shared expectations for performance that enact group identity <b>despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> of a physically present group. He concludes that the Slender Man represents a digital legend cycle that combines the generic conventions and emergent qualities of oral and visual performance with the collaborative potential of networked communication.|$|E
5|$|Braille {{had always}} been a sickly child, and his {{condition}} worsened in adulthood. A persistent respiratory illness, long believed to be tuberculosis, dogged him, and by the age of forty, he was forced to relinquish his position as a teacher. <b>Despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> of a cure at the time, Braille lived with the illness for 16 years. When his condition reached mortal danger, he was admitted to the infirmary at the Royal Institution, where he died in 1852, two days after he had reached the age of forty-three.|$|E
5|$|<b>Despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> of aerial reconnaissance, Liman von Sanders had fairly {{accurate}} {{knowledge on}} 17 September 1918, regarding the forces deployed against his Fourth, Seventh and Eighth Armies. He understood {{there to be}} five infantry divisions and a French detachment facing the Eighth Army with another two divisions facing the Seventh Army and two mounted divisions facing the Fourth Army. Liman von Sanders was not surprised by the strength and location of the attack. He shifted all his available reserves and reinforcements to the west, not to the east. The strategically vital coastal plain was the most strongly defended sector of the front line. Here Liman von Sanders deployed his most experienced infantry divisions supported by heavy artillery.|$|E

The new czar is a benevolent ruler until he discovers that his claim to the throne is not legitimate. He is not Ivan's son, but was merely used as a tool by the faction of Godunov opponents. When his mother Marfa is supposed to provide identification, she does not recognize him. <b>Despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>lacking</b> legitimation, Demetrius requests her to recognize him as her son.

5|$|<b>Despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> of {{close-up}} {{imaging and}} mechanical problems that greatly restricted {{the amount of}} data returned, several significant discoveries were made during Galileos primary mission. Galileo observed {{the effects of a}} major eruption at Pillan Patera and confirmed that volcanic eruptions are composed of silicate magmas with magnesium-rich mafic and ultramafic compositions. Distant imaging of Io was acquired for almost every orbit during the primary mission, revealing large numbers of active volcanoes (both thermal emission from cooling magma on the surface and volcanic plumes), numerous mountains with widely varying morphologies, and several surface changes that had taken place both between the Voyager and Galileo eras and between Galileo orbits.|$|E
5|$|<b>Despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> {{of direct}} incentives, many firms applied {{to move to}} the Manor Royal estate: it was {{considered}} such an attractive place to relocate to that the Development Corporation was able to choose between applicants to achieve the ideal mix of firms, and little advertising or promotion had to be undertaken. One year after Manor Royal was opened, eighteen firms were trading there, including four with more than 100 employees and one with more than 1,000. By 1964, businesses which had moved to the town since 1950 employed 16,000 people; the master plan had anticipated between 8,000 and 8,500. In 1978 there were 105 such firms, employing nearly 20,000 people.|$|E
5|$|<b>Despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> of {{easy access}} to the ranch and any lodging in the area, {{tourists}} flocked to this site. The 1887 completion of the Southern Pacific line increased the number of visitors, as the railroad featured the ranch in its advertisements in order to distinguish the line from its competitors. Although the ranch was not developed for tourism, the Del Valles, with their Californio sense of hospitality, would lodge the visitors. By October 1888, housing visitors was getting to be so expensive for the family that Reginaldo del Valle pressed his mother to stop being so hospitable. The tourists could be quite a nuisance, and unscrupulous visitors would steal items from the house as souvenirs, or help themselves to fruit from the orchards.|$|E
