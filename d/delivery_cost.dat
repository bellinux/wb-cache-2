40|$|Abstract Supply chain {{scheduling}} {{is a new}} emerging area of research. We study batch arrival scheduling {{problems at}} the manufacturer in a multi-level customer-centric supply chain, where promised job due dates are considered constraints which must be satisfied. We analyze the tradeoff between inventory holding <b>costs</b> and batch <b>delivery</b> <b>costs.</b> We show that the problems {{are closely related to}} batch scheduling problems on a single machine with flow-time related objectives. We prove that minimizing the sum of total weighted flow time and <b>delivery</b> <b>costs</b> is strongly NP-hard. For the unweighted version of the problem, we present efficient solution algorithms both for single machine and assembly systems. We also develop a dynamic programming solution for minimizing the sum of maximum flow time and <b>delivery</b> <b>costs...</b>|$|R

50|$|The initial {{procurement}} process was {{built around a}} “design to price” concept in which the final <b>delivery</b> <b>cost</b> per system was fixed in the contract. The SLQ-32 was designed to support the protection of ships against anti-ship missiles in an open sea environment. After initial deployment of the system, naval roles began to change requiring ships to operate much closer to shore in denser signal environments. This change in roles required changes to the SLQ-32 systems which were added over time. With experience gained working with the SLQ-32, coupled with improvements to the hardware and software, technicians and operators gradually overcame the initial problems. The SLQ-32 is now the mainstay of surface electronic warfare in the U.S. Navy and U.S. Coast Guard's WMEC 270 ft Class Ships.|$|E

40|$|Dairy {{products}} {{are characterized by}} two properties, namely, perishability and short-periodic production. These properties are so unique that conventional studies in agricultural economics or in industrial organization might not explain the dairy product supply well. Hence, to understand this dairy product supply, we model it based on these two properties. We find that these properties invite middlemen who can efficiently deliver the products, and give rise to economies of scale in transportation and accessibility advantage in the dairy product supply. The economies of scale in transportation arise because greater production reduces average <b>delivery</b> <b>costs</b> per unit. The accessibility advantage occurs because lowering <b>delivery</b> <b>costs</b> significantly reduces total transportation costs in the long term. ...|$|R

50|$|Thanks to {{the many}} beneﬁts of CDNs, e.g. reduced <b>delivery</b> <b>cost,</b> {{improved}} quality of experience (QoE), and increased robustness of delivery, CDNs have become popular for large-scale content delivery of cacheable content. For this reason, CDN providers are scaling up their infrastructure and many Internet service providers (ISPs)/network service providers (NSPs) have deployed or are deploying their own CDNs for their own use or for lease, if a business and technical arrangement between them and a CDN provider were made. Those stand-alone CDNs with well-deﬁned request routing, delivery, acquisition, accounting systems and protocols may sooner or later face either footprint, resource or capability limits. The CDNI targets at leveraging separate CDNs to provide end-to-end delivery of content from CSPs to end users, regardless of their location or attachment network.|$|E
50|$|Another {{consideration}} in the newsprint business is delivery, which is affected by energy cost trends. Newsprint around the world may be delivered by rail or truck; or by barge, container or break-bulk shipment if a water delivery is appropriate. (Aside from <b>delivery</b> <b>cost,</b> another {{consideration in}} selecting freight mode may be the potential for avoiding damage to the product.) All things being equal, for domestic shipments in areas like North America or Europe where modern road and rail networks are readily available, trucks can be more economical than rail for short-haul deliveries (a day or less from the mill), while rail may be more economical for longer shipments. The cost-competitiveness of each freight mode for a specific mill’s business may depend on local infrastructure issues, {{as well as the}} degree of truck-vs-freight competition in the mill's region. The appropriate freight mode for delivery from a mill to a specific pressroom can also depend on the press room ability to accept enough trucks or rail cars.|$|E
50|$|Peninsula Link (Frankston Bypass) is {{a freeway}} that completes the missing {{sections}} of the Mornington Peninsula Freeway, running from the EastLink interchange at Seaford, Melbourne, running along the eastern fringe of Frankston. It runs via Baxter and Moorooduc, almost parallel to the existing arterial Moorooduc Highway. It was opened on 18 January 2013.The project is a Public Private Partnership (PPP) managed by the Linking Melbourne Authority (formerly SEITA) and delivered by private sector partner Southern Way, with the State Government providing quarterly payments for delivery under an availability model, with no charges to motorists. The contract with Southern Way to design, construct and finance the freeway was signed in January 2010, with a total project <b>delivery</b> <b>cost</b> for the two parties being $759 million. Construction commenced in February 2010, with completion expected in early 2013, with Southern Way to operate and maintain the freeway for the next 25 years.
