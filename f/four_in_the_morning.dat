James (who had printed Frank Comments), if {{he could}} borrow the {{printing}} blocks he used for photos, as they were too expensive for the fledgling company at the time. Harry also borrowed blocks from the Widnes Weekly News, Pantosphinx and local cinemas, but contributed to charities by printing free charity advertisements {{at the side of}} the front cover page. After taking Virginia home to Bowring Park in the evening, Harry would often return to the office and work throughout the night, pausing only to go to the Pier Head to buy a cup of tea and a hot pie at <b>four</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning.</b> Virginia's parents helped the paper during this time, as they paid for classified ads, and arranged for Harry and his future wife's first photographs together.|$|E

Initially, no reasons were provided for their arrest, nor were they allowed contact to their lawyer, and a court hearing the night of their arrest granted the police the right to detain them for 10 days.|$|E
25|$|The city of Basel is a centre for {{numerous}} fairs and events all year round. One {{of the most}} important fairs for contemporary art worldwide is the Art Basel which was founded in 1970 by Ernst Beyeler and takes place in June each year. Baselworld, the watch and jewellery show (Uhren- und Schmuckmesse) one of the biggest fairs of its kind in Europe is held every year as well, and attracts a great number of tourists and dealers to the city. The carnival of the city of Basel (Basler Fasnacht) is a major cultural event in the year. The carnival is the biggest in Switzerland and attracts large crowds every year, {{despite the fact that it}} starts at exactly <b>four</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> (Morgestraich) on a winter Monday. The Fasnacht asserts Basel's Protestant history by commencing the revelry five days after Ash Wednesday and continuing day and night for exactly 72 hours. Almost all study and work in the old city cease. Dozens of fife and drum clubs parade in medieval guild tradition with fantastical masks and illuminated lanterns.|$|E

25|$|Henry Thompson {{was born}} at Allonby, Cumberland, on 9 September 1836, the {{youngest}} of seven children, his father a poor country tailor, earned 9s (45p) per week. At the age of thirteen Thompson became apprentice to Joseph Slee, a Maryport druggist, working from <b>four</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> to nine in the evening. He later moved to Whitehaven to learn veterinary practice under John Fisher, the most qualified veterinary surgeon in Cumberland. After a further two years learning the basic practical skills associated with the equerry business at Carlisle, he enrolled at the Edinburgh Veterinary College, where he studied under Professor William Dick (1793–1866), {{the founder of the}} Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies. After five years of intensive study he graduated with several coveted qualifications; the Diploma of the Highland and Agricultural Society, the examination of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons, and the Royal Diploma. He became one of only two veterinary surgeons in Cumberland, to hold both Diploma's by examination. He obtained many academic distinctions including two silver medals for Anatomy and Physiology, and both first and second class certificates for Chemistry, Histology and Pathology.|$|E
25|$|On {{the evening}} of 31 March, President Chirac {{announced}} in {{an address to the}} nation that he would promulgate the law, but asked the government {{at the same time to}} prepare a new law including two modifications: the trial period would be reduced to one year, and employers would now have to give a reason for the dismissal of the employment. However, Chirac did not specify whether this reason would be a juridical motive or a simple letter without any juridical value. He also asked employers not to start using the contract until these modifications came into force, but suggested no means of enforcement. Chirac's paradoxical call (officially promulgating the law while unofficially asking at the same time for its suspension) has only baffled both partisans and opponents of the text. The president's move was widely analyzed by the press as support for his prime minister Dominique de Villepin against his 2007 election rival, Nicolas Sarkozy, who was the leader of Chirac's political party, the UMP. Villepin had declared that he would have resigned had Chirac refused to promulgate the law. Some 2,000 students were waiting on the Place de la Bastille for Chirac's address to the nation. After hearing it, they carried out a night demonstration, which collected as many as 6,000 persons between the Hôtel de Ville and the Opéra. A few hundred demonstrators continued until <b>four</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning.</b>|$|E

He stated in an interview, [...] "Avatar has been the most difficult film I have worked on and the biggest job I have undertaken." [...] Horner composed the score as two different scores merged into one.

In spite of the film's limited release outside of Australia, Bana's performance received positive reviews. American film critic Roger Ebert complimented Bana, stating that [...] "in a comedian named Eric Bana the filmmakers have found, I think, a future star ... He has a quality no acting school can teach you and few actors can match. You cannot look away from him". Chopper was a critical and financial success in Australia, and was nominated for Best Film at the Australian Film Institute Awards in 2001. Bana's performance won the Australian Film Institute Award for Best Actor.|$|E

Bill Deakin, one of Churchill's research assistants, recalled his working routine. [...] "He would start the day at eight o'clock in bed, reading. Then he started with his mail. His lunchtime conversation was quite magnificent,...absolutely free for all. After lunch, if he had guests he would take them round the garden. At seven he would bathe and change for dinner. At midnight, when the guests left, then he would start work... to three or <b>four</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning.</b> The secret was his phenomenal power to concentrate." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{pastoral}} Epistles, too, {{give the}} impression of being in real places, with flesh-and-blood people, at specific times of day. Epistle 48 tells how the friends return to Stockholm by boat after a night out on Lake Mälaren, one summer morning in 1769. Each of its twenty-one verses paints a picture of a moment in the peaceful journey, from the wind stirring the fallen sails, the skipper's daughter coming out of her cabin, the cockerel crowing, the church clock striking <b>four</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning,</b> the sun glimmering on the calm water. The effects may seem to be haphazard, but [...] "each stanza is a little picture, framed by its melody. We remember it all, seem to have lived through it, like a morning in our own lives." [...] Britten Austin calls it [...] "a new vision of the natural and urban scene. Fresh as Martin's. Detailed as Hogarth's. Frail and ethereal as Watteau's." ...|$|E

He met his wife in New Orleans while {{coaching}} at Tulane. A teetotaler, Shaughnessy held a negative opinion of both drinkers and smokers. Marchmont Schwartz noted, [...] "When he said, 'Let's go have a drink,' he meant, 'Let's go drink a milk shake...He disappointed a lot of newspapermen that way." [...] Aside from his declared hobby as a football coach and experimenter, he enjoyed long-distance driving. Shaughnessy preferred to devise plays late at night, between midnight and dawn, while his household slept. A 1977 Sports Illustrated article described him as an [...] "ascetic" [...] and his lifestyle as [...] "Spartan". It noted he would go to bed as early as 7 o'clock, and wake up for work at three or <b>four</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning.</b>|$|E
500|$|Class {{inequality}} in Swedish society {{was a strong}} and recurring theme in the Commission's findings. It appeared as a major motivator in the 289 personal narratives included in the report. These documents, of great research value and human interest today, were submitted by Swedes in Canada and the U.S. in response to requests in Swedish-American newspapers. The great majority of replies expressed enthusiasm for their new homeland and criticized conditions in Sweden. Bitter experiences of Swedish class snobbery still rankled after sometimes 40–50 years in America. Writers recalled the hard work, pitiful wages, and grim poverty {{of life in the}} Swedish countryside. One woman wrote from North Dakota of how in her Värmland home parish, she had had to earn her living in peasant households from the age of eight, starting work at <b>four</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> and living on [...] "rotten herring and potatoes, served out in small amounts so that I would not eat myself sick".

[...] Madero and 4,500 Maderistas surrounded the city, hemming in General [...] and his 670 Federales. [...] They overran the Chinese gardens surrounding the city, killing 112 of the people working there. [...] Chinese houses were used as fortifications for the advancing rebels, and the people living there were forced to prepare them food. [...] The fighting continued until the Federales began to run low on munitions on Sunday evening. [...] Lojero ordered a retreat, and his forces abandoned the city under cover of darkness between two and <b>four</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> on Monday, 15 May, during a heavy rainstorm. [...] The retreat was so sudden that some troops were left behind during the evacuation. [...] Before the rebels entered the city, witnesses reported that xenophobic speeches had been made to incense the accompanying mob against foreigners. [...] Jesús Flores was present, and made a speech calling the Chinese [...] "dangerous competitors" [...] and concluded [...] "that {{it would be best to}} exterminate them." ...|$|E
500|$|The group {{moved to}} Atlanta, Georgia by May 1, where Walden was {{establishing}} Capricorn Records. Mike Callahan and Joseph [...] "Red Dog" [...] Campbell became the band’s early crew members. [...] "Red Dog" [...] was a disabled Vietnam veteran who donated his monthly disability checks to the band's cause. In Macon, the group stayed at friend Twiggs Lyndon's apartment on 309 College Street, which {{became known as}} the communal home of the band and crew, nicknamed the Hippie Crash Pad. [...] "There were five or six occupied apartments in the building with the Hippie Crash Pad and you would expect they would call the police on us because we were constantly raising hell at three or <b>four</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning,</b> but they all just moved out," [...] said Trucks. [...] Living meagerly, they found a friend in [...] "Mama Louise" [...] Hudson, cook and proprietor of the H Soul Food Restaurant, who ran a tab when they were short of funds, early on made good with proceeds from Duane's recording sessions on the side. The band's image was radical in the just barely integrated Macon: [...] "A lot of the white folk around here did not approve of them long-haired boys, or of them always having a black guy with them," [...] said Hudson. The band performed locally, as well as 80 miles north in Atlanta's Piedmont Park, and practiced at the newly minted Capricorn nearly each day.|$|E
