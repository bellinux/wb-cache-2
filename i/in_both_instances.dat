5|$|As {{lieutenant}} governor, Collins {{presided over}} the state Senate. Members of both major parties praised Collins for her impartiality and knowledge of parliamentary procedure in this role. She was twice called upon to break tie votes in the Senate, once on a bill allowing the state's teachers to engage in collective bargaining and another on a bill to allow branch banking across county lines within the state; <b>in</b> <b>both</b> <b>instances</b> she voted in the negative, killing the bill. During her tenure, she also chaired the National Conference of Lieutenant Governors, becoming {{the first woman to}} hold that position. In 1982, she was named to the board of regents of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville.|$|E
5|$|From 2012 to 2015, the {{two teams}} competed in the I-40 Cup Series, a season-long, 16-game series between the clubs. Whichever of the two won the most games played between them was {{declared}} the winner and received a trophy cup to keep until the next season. The losing team donated game tickets to a charity selected by the winner. The Sounds won the inaugural 2012 contest (9–7), and Memphis won the 2013 series (7–9). The teams tied the 2014 and 2015 series (both 8–8); the Redbirds retained the title <b>in</b> <b>both</b> <b>instances.</b> The teams discontinued the trophy cup, friendly wager, and promotional references to the Series after 2015.|$|E
5|$|In December 2009, Karthik was {{recalled}} to the ODI team {{during the}} Sri Lankan tour of India after Dhoni was banned {{after the second}} match for two matches because of slow over rates. Karthik kept wickets {{in the next two}} matches, scoring 32 and 19 and remaining unbeaten <b>in</b> <b>both</b> <b>instances,</b> helping to guide India to the target in successful runchases. He retained his place as a middle-order batsman in the fifth and final match when Dhoni returned after Tendulkar was rested and Yuvraj injured, but the match was ended prematurely due to an unsafe pitch.|$|E

5|$|Internationally, Luongo has {{competed for}} Team Canada in {{numerous}} tournaments. As a junior, {{he won a}} silver medal at the 1999 World Junior Championships, while being named Best Goaltender in his second tournament appearance. Luongo has won two gold medals at the 2003 and 2004 World Championships and a silver in the 2005 World Championships. He also won the 2004 World Cup championship and appeared in the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin as a backup to Martin Brodeur <b>in</b> <b>both</b> <b>instances.</b> He succeeded Brodeur as Canada's starting goaltender during the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, winning a gold medal. On January 7, 2014, he {{was named to the}} 2014 Canadian Olympic Hockey Team, where he won his 2nd Olympic gold medal in a largely backup role to Carey Price.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in the mid-1930s, Orizaba {{often carried}} {{gold and silver}} bars from Veracruz to New York for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Chase National Bank, or for later {{transshipment}} to London. In October 1933 three short tons (2.7tonnes) of gold bars and coins were shipped on Orizaba for eventual delivery to London, prompting some to believe that gold was being smuggled into Mexico {{to take advantage of}} its policy of not charging duties on gold. In July 1934 Orizaba brought in 16cases of Mexican gold, and in January 1935, 20cases; <b>in</b> <b>both</b> <b>instances,</b> for delivery to Chase National Bank. Twice in 1935, the Ward liner delivered over 1,000bars of silver for the Federal Reserve Bank, bringing 1,390bars in March, and 1,933bars in July. Mexico was not the only place from which Orizaba delivered precious metals. In March 1934, she delivered 12cases of gold—consisting of 84 bars, and worth $1,624,000—from Havana for Chase.|$|E
5|$|During the season, Poulton {{also played}} in the Under-19 interstate tournament during the break in the WNCL, captaining her state. In five innings, she made three half-centuries, with a best of 73 against Queensland in the final, which New South Wales won by five wickets. She was unbeaten {{in the other two}} fifties after opening the batting; New South Wales {{completed}} ten-wicket wins <b>in</b> <b>both</b> <b>instances.</b> Poulton ended the competition with 191 runs at 63.66. She was rewarded with selection in and captaincy of the national Under-19 team during the season and played in two matches against England Under-19s, scoring 13 and 35 as Australia won both matches. At the end of the season, she was selected to lead an Australian Under-23 team to play against the senior England team. Poulton made 15 in her only innings.|$|E
50|$|Social {{isolation}} {{has similar}} characteristics <b>in</b> <b>both</b> temporary <b>instances</b> {{and for those}} with a historical lifelong isolation cycle. All types of social isolation can include staying home for lengthy periods of time, having no communication with family, acquaintances or friends, and/or willfully avoiding any contact with other humans when those opportunities do arise.|$|R

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} the advantages of fusing information from multiple views for vari-ous machine learning applications. However, most existing approaches assumed the shared component common to all views and ignored the private com-ponents of individual views, which thereby restricts the learning performance. In this paper, we pro-pose a new multi-view, low-rank, and sparse ma-trix decomposition scheme to seamlessly integrate diverse yet complementary information stemming from multiple views. Unlike previous approaches, our approach decomposes an input data matrix con-catenated from multiple views as the sum of low-rank, sparse, and noisy parts. Then a unified opti-mization framework is established, where the low-rankness and group-structured sparsity constraints are imposed to simultaneously capture the shared and private components <b>in</b> <b>both</b> <b>instance</b> and view levels. A proven optimization algorithm is devel-oped to solve the optimization, yielding the learned augmented representation which is used as features for classification tasks. Extensive experiments con-ducted on six benchmark image datasets show that our approach enjoys superior performance over the state-of-the-art approaches. ...|$|R
5|$|In {{both the}} campaigns of 1796 and 1800, Napoleon had envisaged the Danube theater {{as the central}} focus of French efforts, but <b>in</b> <b>both</b> <b>instances</b> the Italian theater became the most important. The Aulic Council thought Napoleon would strike in Italy again. Napoleon had other intentions: 210,000 French troops would be {{launched}} eastwards from the camps of Boulogne and would envelop General Mack's exposed Austrian army if it kept marching towards the Black Forest. Meanwhile, Marshal Murat would conduct cavalry screens across the Black Forest to fool the Austrians into thinking that the French were advancing on a direct west-east axis. The main attack in Germany would be supported by French assaults in other theaters: Marshal Masséna would confront Charles in Italy with 50,000 men of the Armée d'Italie, St. Cyr would march to Naples with 20,000 men, and Marshal Brune would patrol Boulogne with 30,000 troops against a possible British invasion.|$|E
5|$|Small {{made his}} {{first-class}} debut for Trinidad on 11 November 1909, playing against a team chosen by WC Shepherd. Small scored 13 and 0 in the match and bowled two over {{without taking a}} wicket. The following January, Small made his first appearance for Trinidad in the Inter-Colonial Tournament; he scored seven runs in his only innings and took four for 16 in British Guiana's first innings. In the final against Barbados, he took one wicket {{in the game and}} scored 17 and 8 in his two innings. Trinidad won the match. Later that year, Small played against Barbados again, in the final of the next Inter-Colonial Tournament, but had little success in that match, nor in the 1912 tournament when his best score in two games was 15 runs, and he took a total of three wickets. <b>In</b> <b>both</b> <b>instances,</b> Barbados won the tournament.|$|E
5|$|The film's setting, {{which appears}} to be a major city, is never {{identified}} in The Brute Man, but {{it has been suggested that}} it is Manhattan, since that is where House of Horrors took place. Commentators have noted similarities between The Brute Man and other films, including the Charlie Chaplin silent comedy City Lights (1931), and the Universal Pictures horror film Bride of Frankenstein (1935). City Lights, like The Brute Man, included a protagonist (Chaplin's Tramp character) who falls in love with a blind girl and seeks money for an operation to restore her eyesight. Likewise, the scenes between the Creeper and Helen Paige share a similar premise and dialogue as the scenes between Frankenstein's monster and the blind hermit in Bride of Frankenstein. In both films, the protagonists are shunned by society based on their physical appearance, but find companionship in a blind loner who knows nothing about their deformities. <b>In</b> <b>both</b> <b>instances,</b> the protagonist is first drawn to their blind companions by music. The Creeper heard Helen playing the piano, while Frankenstein's monster heard the hermit playing the violin. Commentators have noted other similarities between the two films. For example, the Creeper smashes a mirror after looking at his misshapen face, much like the Monster lashes out at his reflection in a waterfall pool.|$|E
5000|$|Structural functionalists such as Émile Durkheim see {{structure}} and hierarchy as essential {{in establishing the}} very existence of society. Theorists such as Karl Marx, by contrast, emphasize that the social structure can act {{to the detriment of the}} majority of individuals in a society. <b>In</b> <b>both</b> these <b>instances</b> [...] "structure" [...] may refer to something both material (or [...] "economic") and cultural (i.e. related to norms, customs, traditions and ideologies).|$|R
50|$|Of {{the many}} unconformities (gaps) {{observed}} in geological strata, the term Great Unconformity {{is applied to}} either the unconformity observed by James Hutton in 1787 at Siccar Point in Scotland, or that observed by John Wesley Powell in the Grand Canyon <b>in</b> 1869. <b>Both</b> <b>instances</b> are exceptional examples of where the contacts between sedimentary strata and either sedimentary or crystalline strata of greatly different ages, origins, and structure represent periods of geologic time sufficiently long to raise great mountains and then erode them away.|$|R

50|$|The military's {{motivation}} for liberalising media licensing {{was based on}} an assumption that the Pakistani media could be used to strengthen national security and counter any perceived threats from India. What prompted this shift was the military's experience during the two past confrontations with India. One was the Kargil War and the other was the hijacking of the India Airliner by militants. <b>In</b> <b>both</b> these <b>instances,</b> the Pakistani military was left with no options to reciprocate because its electronic media were inferior to that of the Indian media. Better electronic media capacity was needed in the future and thus the market for electronic media was liberalised.|$|R
