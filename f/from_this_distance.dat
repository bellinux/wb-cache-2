5|$|The two Voyager {{spacecraft}} {{made the}} first close-up images of Enceladus. Voyager 1 {{was the first to}} fly past Enceladus, at a distance of 202,000km on November 12, 1980. Images acquired <b>from</b> <b>this</b> <b>distance</b> had very poor spatial resolution, but revealed a highly reflective surface devoid of impact craters, indicating a youthful surface. Voyager 1 also confirmed that Enceladus was embedded in the densest part of Saturn's diffuse E ring. Combined with the apparent youthful appearance of the surface, Voyager scientists suggested that the E ring consisted of particles vented from Enceladus's surface.|$|E
5|$|This {{planning}} depth is {{also seen}} {{in the presence of}} exotic raw materials at a variety of sites throughout the MSA. Procurement of local raw materials would have been a simple task to accomplish, yet MSA sites regularly contain raw materials that were obtained from sources over 100 km away, and sometimes farther than 300 km. Obtaining raw materials <b>from</b> <b>this</b> <b>distance</b> would require an awareness of the resources, a perceived value in the resources, whether it be functional or symbolic, and, possibly, the ability to organize an exchange network in order to obtain the materials.|$|E
25|$|Starting in {{the late}} 1950s, the United States began {{development}} of anti-satellite weapons. The first United States anti-satellite weapon was Bold Orion Weapon System 199B. Like the ASM-135, the Bold Orion missile was air-launched; {{but in this case}} from a B-47 Stratojet. The Bold Orion was tested on 19 October 1959 against the Explorer 6 satellite. The two-stage Bold Orion missile passed within 4 miles (6.4km) of Explorer 6. <b>From</b> <b>this</b> <b>distance,</b> only a relatively large yield nuclear warhead would likely have destroyed the target.|$|E

500|$|When an attack, contact or {{sighting}} {{was reported}} a siren would sound throughout {{the base and}} the troopers would rush out to react in two [...] "Waves". The First Wave of 32 soldiers would be transported to the area aboard Alouette III helicopters, commonly called [...] "G-cars", and would {{be accompanied by a}} further Alouette III, acting as command gunship (or [...] "K-car") and a Cessna Skymaster (or [...] "Lynx") light support aircraft. Each Alouette could carry a [...] "stick" [...] of four soldiers, so on Fireforce the First Wave was organised into eight four-man [...] "stops". The remainder of the Commando, the Second Wave, would either be carried by the same aircraft, which returned to collect them, or move by truck {{at the same time as}} the First Wave. The object of Fireforce was to quickly trap and wipe out guerrilla groups before they could evacuate the area, so the element of surprise was important, but this was difficult to maintain because of the noise of an Alouette III's jet engine; on a windy day in the quiet bush, an Alouette III can be heard [...] many kilometres away. Hearing the Fireforce coming <b>from</b> <b>this</b> <b>distance</b> would give the cadres plenty of time to hide themselves, so the RhAF pilots would attempt to approach their targets heading upwind to minimise this effect.|$|E
2500|$|The {{persecution}} of English priests over these issues captured international attention, {{especially in the}} United States where the Oxford Movement had attracted many followers. [...] On 19 December 1880 Revd Dr. Ewer, S.T.D., preached a sermon in St. Ignatius Church, New York, on [...] "The Imprisonment of English Priests for Conscience Sake". [...] He described Enraght's stand [...] "as simply a determined resistance to {{a violation of the}} 'Magna Charta'." [...] Ewer was [...] "proud to make common cause with them, so far as is possible, <b>from</b> <b>this</b> <b>distance,</b> and feeling that when one member of the Catholic Church suffers, all the members suffer with him." [...] Ewer's sermon was printed in full in the New York Herald and New York Tribune the following day. [...] Four other priests in England also served prison sentences under the PWR Act: Arthur Tooth, T. Pelham Dale, Sidney Faithorn Green and James Bell Cox. [...] The Conference of the Confraternity of the Blessed Sacrament in the USA sent a letter of support, [...] "to express the sympathy of the Conference for Fr. R.W.Enraght in his incarceration for conscience’s sake." ...|$|E

60|$|The {{house itself}} also, {{although}} not large, {{was of a}} kind new to me. It was deep, but narrow fronted, and before it were four columns that carried the roof which projected so as to form a wide verandah.

In short in that lonely wilderness, at any rate <b>from</b> <b>this</b> <b>distance,</b> it did look like the deserted shrine of some forgotten god.|$|E

60|$|The settlement, {{backed by}} its grand 'bush' and {{faced by the}} sea, {{consists}} of a castle and a subject town; it wears, in fact, a baronial and old-world look. Fort Santo Antonio, a tall white house upon a bastioned terrace, crowns proudly enough a knob of black rock and low green growth. On both sides of it, north and south, stretches the town; <b>from</b> <b>this</b> <b>distance</b> it appears a straggle of brown thatched huts and hovels, enlivened here and there by some whitewashed establishments, mining or 'in the mercanteel.'

Tornado springing doubtless from the regions called Infernal; and darkening the upper world from south to north, and {{from east to west}} for Seven Years long;--issuing in general AS-YOU-WERE! Yes truly, the tornado was Infernal; but Heaven too had silently its purposes in it. Nor is the mere expenditure of men's diabolic rages, in mutual clash as of opposite electricities, with reduction to equipoise, and restoration of zero and repose again after seven years, the one or the principal result arrived at. Inarticulately, little dreamt of at the time by any by-stander, the results, on survey <b>from</b> <b>this</b> <b>distance,</b> are visible as Threefold. Let us name them one other time:-- ...|$|E

(Histoire Parlementaire, i. 335.) The Rennes people have elected Farmer Gerard, 'a man of natural sense and rectitude, without any learning.' He walks there, with solid step; unique, 'in his rustic farmer-clothes;' {{which he will}} wear always; careless of short-cloaks and costumes. The name Gerard, or 'Pere Gerard, Father Gerard,' as they please to call him, will fly far; borne about in endless banter; in Royalist satires, in Republican didactic Almanacks. (Actes des Apotres (by Peltier and others); Almanach du Pere Gerard (by Collot d'Herbois) &c. &c.) As for the man Gerard, being asked once, what he did, after trial of it, candidly think of this Parlementary work,--"I think," [...] answered he, [...] "that there are a good many scoundrels among us."
