5|$|A Fistful of Dollars {{proved a}} {{landmark}} {{in the development}} of spaghetti Westerns, with Leone depicting a more lawless and desolate world than traditional westerns, and challenging American stereotypes of a western hero with a morally ambiguous antihero. The film's success made Eastwood a major star in Italy and he was re-hired to star in For a <b>Few</b> <b>Dollars</b> More (1965), the second of the trilogy. Through the efforts of screenwriter Luciano Vincenzoni, the rights to For a <b>Few</b> <b>Dollars</b> More and the final film of the trilogy (The Good, the Bad and the Ugly) were sold to United Artists for about $900,000.|$|E

Altruism and reciprocity characteristics are measured for each individual using selected items from the World Values Survey. We find that altruism and reciprocity attributes systematically affect behavior. Subjects with higher altruism scores offer more, accept lower offers and return more. Subjects with higher reciprocity scores {{are more willing to}} punish violators of norms by rejecting offers more often, dividing <b>fewer</b> <b>dollars</b> and returning <b>fewer</b> <b>dollars</b> in the ultimatum and trust games. laboratory experiment, two-person game, survey, culture...|$|R

25|$|The {{most popular}} Spaghetti Westerns {{were those of}} Sergio Leone, whose Dollars Trilogy (A Fistful of Dollars, For a <b>Few</b> <b>Dollars</b> More, and The Good, the Bad and the Ugly), {{featuring}} Clint Eastwood and scores by Ennio Morricone, came to define the genre along with Once Upon a Time in the West.|$|E
25|$|By 1976, {{the cost}} of the {{cheapest}} four-function pocket calculator had dropped to a <b>few</b> <b>dollars,</b> about 1/20th of the cost five years before. The results of this were that the pocket calculator was affordable, and that it was now difficult for the manufacturers to make a profit from calculators, leading to many firms dropping out of the business or closing down. The firms that survived making calculators tended to be those with high outputs of higher quality calculators, or producing high-specification scientific and programmable calculators.|$|E
25|$|In 1928 Murphy sailed for New York, {{planning}} {{to continue her}} music studies while staying with a well-off great-uncle on Staten Island. Lured by Manhattan, she soon struck off on her own, playing piano for a while at a cafeteria near Columbia University, where she’d befriended students. Unfamiliar with American popular songs, she failed to please her audience but earned a <b>few</b> <b>dollars</b> dishing out food. She was fired from a subsequent job as a restaurant cashier because of her confusion over U.S. coins. With the Great Depression under way and jobs hard to find, she began coloring picture postcards for subsistence wages.|$|E

Evans arrives separately with McElroy and delivers him to Doc Potter (Tudyk), then tries in vain to negotiate with Hollander, who shoves him to the ground and departs. Enraged, Evans barges into the saloon looking for him, but instead encounters Wade emerging from an upstairs room. Evans coaxes a <b>few</b> <b>dollars</b> from Wade over the trouble the outlaw has caused him, delaying the outlaw long enough for the railroad men to ambush and arrest him.|$|E
25|$|The Good, the Bad and the Ugly was {{marketed as}} {{the third and final}} {{installment}} in the Dollars Trilogy, following A Fistful of Dollars and For a <b>Few</b> <b>Dollars</b> More. The film was a financial success, grossing over $25 million at the box office, and is credited with catapulting Eastwood into stardom. Due to general disapproval of the Spaghetti Western genre at the time, critical reception of the film following its release was mixed, but it gained critical acclaim in later years. The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is now seen {{as one of the greatest}} and most influential Westerns of all time.|$|E
25|$|The {{composer}} subsequently scored Leone's {{other two}} Dollars Trilogy (or Man With No Name Trilogy) spaghetti westerns: For a <b>Few</b> <b>Dollars</b> More (1965) and The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966). All three films starred the American actor Clint Eastwood as The Man With No Name and depicted Leone's own intense {{vision of the}} mythical West. Some of the music was written before the film, which was unusual. Leone's films were made like that because he wanted the music {{to be an important}} part of it; he kept the scenes longer because he did not want the music to end. According to Morricone this explains why the films are so slow.|$|E

25|$|In the United States, A Fistful of Dollars was {{released}} 18 January 1967 (28 months after its initial Italian release); For a <b>Few</b> <b>Dollars</b> More {{was released}} 10 May 1967 (17 months); and The Good, the Bad and the Ugly was released 29 December 1967 (12 months). Thus, {{all three of}} Leone's Dollars Trilogy films were released in the United States during the same year. The original Italian domestic version was 177 minutes long, but the international version was shown at various lengths. Most prints, specifically those shown in the United States, had a runtime of 161 minutes, 16 minutes shorter than the Italian premiere version, but others, especially British prints, ran as short as 148 minutes.|$|E
25|$|The postage {{issued in}} the US {{during this time}} was printed by the National Bank Note Company (NBNCo) on white wove paper. The first {{printing}} was issued with 'grills', tiny cuts in the paper to absorb ink. Later reprintings were issued without grilling. The National Bank Note Company's contract expired in 1873, and the Continental Bank Note Company (CBNC) won the contract to continue printing the series and took {{over some of the}} dies and plates used by NBNCo. The new company employed secret marks on the lower-value stamps to distinguish its work from the first printing. The green Washington 3¢ issue was printed in such large quantities that postally used examples remain inexpensive to this day, from pennies to a <b>few</b> <b>dollars,</b> depending on type of cancellation and condition. (The green variety was reprinted again by the American Bank Note Company (AmBNC), also in very large quantities, and issued on July 16, 1881.) The 3-cent Washington design was printed yet a fourth time, in vermillion, in 1887. The 3-cent issues paid the domestic letter rate for a half-ounce letter.|$|E
25|$|The {{people of}} Thailand, with Buddhist and animist beliefs, {{also have a}} vast pantheon of amulets, which are still popular and in common use by most people even in the present day. The belief in magic is {{impregnated}} into Thai culture and religious beliefs and folk superstitions, and this {{is reflected in the}} fact that we can still see commonplace use of amulets and magical rituals in everyday life. Some of the more commonly known amulets are of course the Buddhist votive tablets, such as the Pra Somdej Buddha image, and guru monk coins. But Thailand has an immensely large number of magical traditions, and thousands of different types of amulet and occult charm can be found in use, ranging from the takrut scroll spell, to the necromantic Ban Neng Chin Aathan, which uses the bones or flesh of the corpse of a 'hoeng prai' ghost (a person who died unnaturally, screaming, or in other strange premature circumstances), to reanimate the spirit of the dead, to dwell within the bone as a spirit, and assist the owner to achieve their goals. The list of Thai Buddhist amulets in existence is a lifetime study in its own right, and indeed, many people devote their lives to the study of them, and collection. Thai amulets are still immensely popular both with Thai folk as well as with foreigners, and in recent years, a massive increase in foreign interest has caused the subject of Thai Buddhist amulets to become a commonly known topic around the world. Amulets can fecth prices ranging from a <b>few</b> <b>dollars</b> right up to millions of dollars for a single amulet. Due to the money that can be made with sorcery services, and with rare collector amulets of the master class, there is also a forgery market in existence, which ensures that the experts of the scene maintain a monopoly on the market. With so many fakes, experts are needed for collectors to trust for obtaining authentic amulets, and not selling them fakes.|$|E

The figure, which comes from the U.S. Census Bureau's report titled Public School Finances 2004, measures spending {{as a percentage of}} personal income. Colorado appears to be low in these rankings because of the high earning power of its taxpaying residents.

500|$|The Dollars trilogy was not {{released}} in the United States until 1967, when A Fistful of Dollars opened in January, followed by For a <b>Few</b> <b>Dollars</b> More in May, and The Good, the Bad and the Ugly on December 29, 1967. All the films were commercially successful, particularly The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, which eventually earned $8million in rental earnings and turned Eastwood into a major film star. All three films received bad reviews, and {{marked the beginning of}} a battle for Eastwood to win American film critics' respect. Judith Crist described A Fistful of Dollars as [...] "cheapjack," [...] while Newsweek considered For a <b>Few</b> <b>Dollars</b> More as [...] "excruciatingly dopey." [...] Renata Adler of The New York Times said The Good, the Bad and the Ugly was [...] "...the most expensive, pious and repellent movie in the history of its peculiar genre." [...] Time magazine drew attention to the film's wooden acting, especially on the part of Eastwood, though a few critics such as Vincent Canby and Bosley Crowther of The New York Times praised Eastwood's coolness in playing the tall, lone stranger. Leone's cinematography was widely acclaimed, even by critics who disparaged the acting in the film.|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} Gabbar Singh was modelled on {{a real-life}} dacoit {{of the same}} name who had menaced the villages around Gwalior in the 1950s. Any policeman captured by the real Gabbar Singh had his ears and nose cut off, and was released as a warning to other policemen. The character was also influenced by the villain [...] "El Indio" [...] (played by Gian Maria Volontè) of Sergio Leone's For a <b>Few</b> <b>Dollars</b> More (1965). Soorma Bhopali, a minor comic relief character, was based on an acquaintance of actor Jagdeep, a forest officer from Bhopal named Soorma. The real-life Soorma eventually threatened to press charges when people who had viewed the film began referring to him as a woodcutter. The main characters' names, Jai and Veeru, mean [...] "victory" [...] and [...] "heroism" [...] in Hindi.|$|E

500|$|According to National Geographics report, {{the story}} of [...] "Archaeoraptor" [...] begins in July 1997 in Xiasanjiazi, China, where farmers {{routinely}} dug in the shale pits with picks and sold fossils to dealers for a <b>few</b> <b>dollars.</b> This was an illegal practice, but it was common then. In this case one farmer found a rare fossil of a toothed bird, complete with feather impressions. The fossil broke into pieces during collection. Nearby, in the same pit, he found pieces including a feathered tail and legs. He cemented several of these pieces together {{in a manner that}} he believed was correct. He apparently knew that it would make a more complete-looking and, thus, more expensive fossil. It was sold in June 1998 to an anonymous dealer and smuggled to the United States. According to authorities in Beijing, no fossils may leave China legally.|$|E
500|$|Religious scholar Catherine Wessinger {{posits that}} the suicides began on March22. Most members took {{barbiturates}} and alcohol and then placed bags over their heads.

A bag that contained a <b>few</b> <b>dollars</b> and {{a form of}} identification was placed beside most bodies. The deaths occurred over three days; Applewhite {{was one of the}} last four to die. Three assistants helped him commit suicide, then killed themselves. An anonymous tip led the sheriff's department to search the mansion; they found 39 bodies there on March26. It was the largest group suicide involving U.S. citizens since the 1978 mass suicide of 920 Americans in Jonestown, Guyana. Applewhite's body was found seated on the bed of the mansion's master bedroom. Medical examiners determined that his fears of cancer had been unfounded, but that he suffered from coronary atherosclerosis.|$|E
500|$|The Great Silence {{has been}} {{interpreted}} by various film critics and historians as a subversion of various conventions of the Western film genre. Corbucci, a left-wing radical who made his political views either the subtext or subject of several of his films, wrote the film's story as an allegory highlighting the corruptions stemming from authoritarian forms of capitalism, which are personified by the sadistic, greedy bounty killers led by Loco (who use the bounties to fuel their desires for violence and money while acting under the law), {{as well as the}} schemes of the banker Pollicutt. This is partially in line with the [...] "Classical Plot" [...] of both American Westerns (such as Shane) and certain Spaghetti Westerns (such as A Fistful of Dollars), in which, according to Will Wright, a [...] "lone stranger rides into a troubled town and cleans it up, winning the respect of the townsfolk and the love of the schoolmarm." [...] As a result of his sympathetic portrayal of the outlaws and the demoniac characterization of the people who hunt them, Corbucci's presentation of bounty killers is far more negative than such figures in Sergio Leone's films – the closing title card of The Great Silence contrasts with the opening title card of For a <b>Few</b> <b>Dollars</b> More.|$|E
