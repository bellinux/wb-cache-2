5000|$|The chief {{values of}} obtaining a deposition, {{as with any}} {{discovery}} proceeding, is to give all litigant parties in a contested case a fair preview of the evidence, and to provide support documents for further trials and dispositive motions. The process provides a [...] "level playing field" [...] of information among the litigants and avoids surprises at trial (traditionally regarded as an unfair tactic). Another benefit of taking depositions is to preserve a witness's recollection while it is still fresh, since the trial may still be months or years away. When a witness's testimony in open court is inconsistent with that given at deposition, a party can introduce the deposition to impeach (or contradict) the witness. In the event a witness is unavailable for trial (usually because they are deceased, seriously ill, or live hundreds of miles away), their deposition may be read or played before the jury and made part of the record in the case, with the same legal force as live testimony. In some states, stenographic, audio, or video records of depositions can be offered into evidence even if the witness is available. Deposition of the opposite party {{is often used to}} produce self-incriminating statements from the deponent, also <b>document</b> <b>identification</b> questions can make exhibits admissible for hearings and summary judgment motions.|$|E
40|$|Retrieving {{entities}} {{from inside}} of documents, instead {{of searching for}} documents or web pages themselves, has become an active topic in both commercial search systems and academic information retrieval research area. Taking into account information needs about entities represented as descriptions with targeted answer entity types, entity search tasks are to return ranked lists of answer entities from unstructured texts, such as news or web pages. Although it works in the same environment as document retrieval, entity retrieval tasks require finer-grained answers entities which need more syntactic and semantic analyses on germane documents than document retrieval. This work proposes a two-layer probability model for addressing this task, which integrates germane <b>document</b> <b>identification</b> and answer entity extraction. Germane <b>document</b> <b>identification</b> retrieves highly related germane documents containing answer entities, while answer entity extraction finds answer entities by utilizing syntactic or linguistic information from those documents. This work theoretically demonstrates the integration of germane <b>document</b> <b>identification</b> and answer entity extraction for the entity retrieval task with the probability model. Moreover, this probability approach helps to reduce the overall retrieval complexity while maintaining high accuracy in locating answer entities. Serial studies are conducted in this dissertation on both germane <b>document</b> <b>identification</b> and answer entity extraction. The learning to rank method is investigated for germane <b>document</b> <b>identification.</b> This method first constructs a model on the training data set using query features, document features, similarity features and rank features. Then the model estimates the probability of the germane documents on testing data sets with the learned model. The experiment indicates that the learning to rank method is significantly better than the baseline systems, which treat germane <b>document</b> <b>identification</b> as a conventional document retrieval problem. The answer entity extraction method aims to correctly extract the answer entities from the germane documents. The methods of answer entity extraction without contexts (such as named entity recognition tools for extraction and knowledge base for extraction) and answer entity extraction with contexts (such as tables/lists as contexts and subject-verb-object structures as contexts) are investigated. These methods individually, however, can extract only parts of answer entities. The method of treating the answer entity extraction problem as a classification problem with the features from the above extraction methods runs significantly {{better than any of}} the individual extraction methods. ...|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} fast method to {{identify}} homogeneous parallel documents. The method {{is based on}} collecting counts of identical low-frequency words between possibly parallel documents. The candidate with the most shared low-frequency words is selected as the parallel document. The method achieved 99. 96 % accuracy when tested on the EUROPARL corpus of parliamentary proceedings, failing only in anomalous cases of truncated or otherwise distorted documents. While other work has shown similar performance on this type of dataset, our approach presented here is faster and does not require training. Apart from proposing an efficient method for parallel <b>document</b> <b>identification</b> in a restricted domain, this paper furnishes evidence that parliamentary proceedings may be inappropriate for testing parallel <b>document</b> <b>identification</b> systems in general. ...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{describes}} a {{method by which}} one could use the documents captured from low-resolution handheld devices to retrieve the originals of those documents from a document store.

Secondly, the shallow layout features {{is considered due to}} the poor resolution of the captured documents. We propose in this article to fuse those two complementary feature sets in order to improve <b>document</b> <b>identification</b> performance. Finally, in order to test the influence of merging strategies on <b>document</b> <b>identification</b> performance, a synergic method is proposed and evaluated relative to a similar method in which feature sets are simply considered sequentially...|$|E

Enhancements include full access to the version control system and support of configuration rules which control the selection process for component versions during identification, build or rebuild of system configurations. Since integration of version control was a major objective for our system, we had to face the need for a <b>document</b> <b>identification</b> scheme that goes beyond the usual way of specifying name and type of a document. As a consequence, we began to design an attributed filesystem (AFS) that introduces a much more generalized scheme for <b>document</b> <b>identification.</b> The AFS comprises concepts for version control, support for variants or status models for example. Furthermore, it helps to abstract from the particular underlying data storage system {{in such a way that}} it makes no difference whether it is an or [...] ...|$|E

40|$|Determining the {{sequence}} of document production and stamping {{is one of the}} most important issues in the field of questioned <b>document</b> <b>identification.</b> In China, whether a contract or a document is legal or not, highly depends on the relationship between the generation time of the document's content and its stamping. Usually, a formal (legal) document would become effective once a seal is affixed, and normally, the content of the document is generated first and then subsequently stamped after being approved by the relevant personnel. Therefore, correctly identifying {{the sequence}} used to produce a document is necessary to determine whether it is authentic or whether it may have been forged. However, because of the interference of many factors, the identification of such kind of forged documents has long been considered one of the most difficult technical issues in the field of questioned <b>document</b> <b>identification.</b> In this work, four nondestructive approaches to determine the order of photocopying and stamping were investigated: The stereomicroscope method, fluorescence microscopy, the three-dimensional pseudo-color method, and the contour ring method.
