First, we develop a simple {{algorithm}} to list all nonisomorphic rooted <b>plane</b> <b>trees</b> in lexicographic order using a level sequence representation. Then, by selecting a unique centroid {{to act as}} the root of a free <b>plane</b> <b>tree,</b> we apply the rooted <b>plane</b> <b>tree</b> algorithm to develop an algorithm to list all nonisomorphic free <b>plane</b> <b>trees.</b> The latter algorithm also uses a level sequence representation and lists all free <b>plane</b> <b>trees</b> with a unique centroid first followed by all free <b>plane</b> <b>trees</b> with two centroids. Both algorithms are proved to run in constant amortized time using straightforward bounding methods...|$|R
40|$|The {{rotation}} correspondence is a {{map that}} sends {{the set of}} <b>plane</b> <b>trees</b> onto the set of binary trees. In this paper, we first show that when n goes to +∞, the image by the rotation correspondence of a uniformly chosen random <b>plane</b> <b>tree</b> τ with n nodes is close to 2 τ (in a sense to be defined). The {{second part of the}} paper is devoted to the right and left depth of nodes in binary trees. We show that the empiric measure (suitably normalized) associated with the difference of the right depth and the left depth processes converges to the integrated super Brownian excursion. 1 <b>Plane</b> <b>trees,</b> binary trees and the rotation correspondence In this paper, we call <b>plane</b> <b>tree</b> a finite rooted unlabeled loop-free connected graph in which the set of children of every vertex is endowed with a total order.

40|$|The {{combinatorics}} of RNA plays {{a central}} role in biology. Mathematical biologists have several commonly-used models for RNA: words in a fixed alphabet (representing the primary sequence of nucleotides) and <b>plane</b> <b>trees</b> (representing the secondary structure, or folding of the RNA sequence). This paper considers an augmented version of the standard model of <b>plane</b> <b>trees,</b> one that incorporates some observed constraints on how the folding can occur. In particular we assume the alphabet consists of complementary pairs, for instance the Watson-Crick pairs A-U and C-G of RNA. Given a word in the alphabet, a valid <b>plane</b> <b>tree</b> is a tree for which, when the word is folded around the tree, each edge matches two complementary letters. Consider the graph whose vertices are valid <b>plane</b> <b>trees</b> for a fixed word and whose edges are given by Condon, Heitsch, and Hoos's local moves. We prove this graph is connected. We give an explicit algorithm to construct a valid <b>plane</b> <b>tree</b> from a primary sequence, assuming that at least one valid <b>plane</b> <b>tree</b> exists. The tree produced by our algorithm has other useful characterizations, including a uniqueness condition defined by local moves. We also study enumerative properties of valid <b>plane</b> <b>trees,</b> analyzing how the number of valid <b>plane</b> <b>trees</b> depends on the choice of sequence length and alphabet size. Finally we show that the proportion of words with at least one valid <b>plane</b> <b>tree</b> goes to zero as the word size increases. We also give some open questions.

40|$|AbstractThe {{subject of}} each of the five {{sections}} of this paper is the planted <b>plane</b> <b>trees</b> discussed by Harary, Prins, and Tutte [7]. A description of the content of the present work is given in Section 1. Section 2 is devoted to a definition of <b>plane</b> <b>trees</b> in terms of finite sets and relations defined on them—we hope this definition will replace the topological concepts introduced in [7]. A one-to-one correspondence between the classes of isomorphic planted <b>plane</b> <b>trees</b> with n+ 2 vertices and the classes of isomorphic 3 -valent planted <b>plane</b> <b>trees</b> with 2 n+ 2 vertices is given in Section 3.

40|$|We {{introduce}} {{the notion of}} doubly rooted <b>plane</b> <b>trees</b> and give a decomposition of these trees, called the butterfly decomposition {{which turns out to}} have many applications. From the butterfly decomposition we obtain a one-to-one correspondence between doubly rooted <b>plane</b> <b>trees</b> and free Dyck paths, which implies a simple derivation of a relation between the Catalan numbers and the central binomial coefficients. We also establish a one-to-one correspondence between leaf-colored doubly rooted <b>plane</b> <b>trees</b> and free Schröder paths. The classical Chung-Feller theorem on free Dyck paths and some generalizations and variations with respect to Dyck paths and Schröder paths with flaws turn out to be immediate consequences of the butterfly decomposition and the preorder traversal of <b>plane</b> <b>trees.</b> We obtain two involutions on free Dyck paths and free Schröder paths, leading to two combinatorial identities. We also use the butterfly decomposition to give a combinatorial treatment of the generating function for the number of chains in <b>plane</b> <b>trees</b> due to Klazar. We further study the average size of chains in <b>plane</b> <b>trees</b> with n edges and show that this number asymptotically tends to n+ 9 6. Comment: 18 pages, 6 figure...|$|R

We study the random <b>plane</b> <b>tree</b> with a fixed diameter p sampled according to probabilities proportional to these μ-weights and we prove that, under the assumption that the sequence of laws μ_p, p≥ 1, belongs to the domain of attraction of an infinitely divisible law, the scaling limits of such random <b>plane</b> <b>trees</b> are random compact real trees called the unrooted Levy trees, which have been introduced in Duquense & Wang.

A theorem of Gordon and Temple is applied in order to give a general relationship between the number of planted <b>plane</b> <b>trees</b> and the number of rooted <b>plane</b> <b>trees</b> and the degree partition restriction is generalised to type partition. The piecewise construction method is successfully used to derive the number of planted <b>plane</b> <b>trees</b> with a given 2 -colour degree partition, also derived by Tutte, and an algorithm for the k-coloured case is developed. This algorithm may be used to obtain more specific results. These models are relevant to the statistical mechanics of polymers and this is discussed briefly...|$|R
