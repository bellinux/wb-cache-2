5|$|September 10, 1964– Hurricane Dora makes {{landfall}} as {{a weakening}} Category 2 hurricane near Jacksonville, the first hurricane in {{an extended period}} of time to strike the area. Dora produces moderate to heavy amounts of precipitation which peaks at 23.73inches (603mm) in Mayo, causing flooding damage and killing one from drowning. Wind gusts peak at 125mph (200km/h) near St. Augustine, causing massive utility failures and heavy <b>damage</b> <b>to</b> <b>buildings.</b> Two Navy personnel die when their evacuating plane crashed upon takeoff. Damage totaled about $220million (1964USD, $1.53billion 2008USD).|$|E
5|$|Twelve tornadoes were {{reported}} during Fay's landfall; {{the most notable}} one destroyed a mobile home, and damaged a barn. Heavy rain from Fay's remnants also dropped 23inches (50–75mm) of rain over Frio County. Rainfall of 8inches (200mm) was reported near the Atascosca County line with an isolated report of 12inches (300mm) in other areas. The rainfall caused severe flashflooding which forced people to flee to roof tops. <b>Damage</b> <b>to</b> <b>buildings,</b> roads and crops totaled up to $800,000 (2002USD; $940,0002007USD).|$|E
5|$|Across the {{southern}} {{portion of the}} Baja California peninsula, the storm dropped moderate rainfall, {{with a total of}} about 5inches (125mm) reported in Cabo San Lucas; the NHC remarked that higher amounts likely occurred in higher elevations. The rainfall caused minor flooding in and around Cabo San Lucas. Along {{the southern}} coast of the peninsula, Emilia produced tropical storm force winds; two stations reported sustained winds of 43mph (69km/h), with one of those reporting wind gusts to 55mph (89km/h). The storm caused minor <b>damage</b> <b>to</b> <b>buildings</b> and utility lines. Waves from the storm left minor damage at several marinas in the region, with several being closed for two days.|$|E

5|$|In Martinsburg, West Virginia, several {{government}} buildings were evacuated, and multiple citizens reported feeling their homes shaking violently enough to rattle picture frames off the walls. In Charleston, the Kanawha County Courthouse, the West Virginia State Capitol campus, {{and several other}} downtown buildings were evacuated; Kanawha County dispatchers received more than 350 telephone calls in 45 minutes, but there were not any reports of <b>damage</b> <b>to</b> <b>buildings</b> and infrastructure other than minor plaster cracking in the old courthouse. In Philippi, part of a chimney collapsed at the Barbour County courthouse. The West Virginia Office of Miners' Health, Safety and Training stated that West Virginia coal mines were safe following the tremors.

5|$|In South Carolina, minor beach erosion was {{reported}} in Charleston and Colleton Counties. Swells of up to 15ft (4.5m), in combination with strong waves, caused overwash on Route 12 on Hatteras Island. Minor beach erosion occurred. Moderate winds of up to 50mph (80km/h) blew down a few trees and caused shingle <b>damage</b> <b>to</b> <b>buildings.</b> In Delaware, rough surf closed numerous coastal beaches, while storm tides and waves flooded a campground near the Indian River in Sussex County. Strong waves in New Jersey killed two people and seriously injured another. Lifeguards made numerous rescues along the coast, while other beaches were closed or had restrictions on bathing. Winds were minor along the Jersey coastline, peaking at less than 30mph (48km/h).|$|E
5|$|Sites in Africa {{have been}} marked as such {{for a variety}} of reasons, such as {{deforestation}} and hunting, civil war, threats to and hostage taking of reserve staff, oil and gas projects and mining, declines in biodiversity, and structural <b>damage</b> <b>to</b> <b>buildings.</b> Three sites were formerly declared as being in danger, but have since lost the status: the Ngorongoro Conservation Area (19841989), the Rwenzori Mountains National Park (19992004), and Tipasa (20022006). The Garamba National Park and Timbuktu have also lost their statuses in 1992 and 2005, respectively, but later regained it in 1996 and 2012. Despite its large number of endangered sites and the circumstances surrounding them, African World Heritage Sites have never been stripped of their title, something that has only occurred twice.|$|E

30|$|The September 29 th, 1969 {{earthquake}} {{which occurred}} in Ceres–Tulbagh region of western Cape province, South Africa, {{is one of}} the strongest ever recorded seismic event in South Africa (Krüger and Scherbaum 2014). The event which recorded 6.2 on the moment magnitude scale (Mw) was felt throughout the southern part of South Africa, as far north as Upington in the Northern Cape Province, and as far east as Durban in the KwaZulu-Natal Province (Midzi et al. 2013). Series of aftershocks were recorded after the quake, the strongest had a magnitude of 5.7 (Mw) and occurred on 14 April 1970. The 1969 earthquake caused severe <b>damages</b> <b>to</b> <b>buildings</b> in the towns of Tulbagh, Wolsely, Ceres and Prince Alfred Hamlet; several casualties were reported and nine lives were lost (Kijko et al. 2002). Total <b>damages</b> <b>to</b> <b>building</b> in the epicentral area was estimated at US $ 24, 000, 000.|$|R
5|$|The main shock hit Bucharest between {{noon and}} 1 p.m. The {{earthquake}} was felt for about 10minutes {{and was so}} violent that all chimneys in the city collapsed. Numerous historical monuments were destroyed, including St. Nicholas Church, Cotroceni Monastery and the 54-meter-high Colțea Tower. The Greek chronicler Dionysius Fotino reported that Prince Constantine Ypsilantis moved {{with his family to}} the Văcărești Monastery because his palace was severely damaged. However, despite the massive <b>damage</b> <b>to</b> <b>buildings,</b> only four deaths were reported: a Jewish woman and her baby, an itinerant merchant killed when Colțea Tower collapsed, and one other victim. The death toll may have been so low because the houses were built far apart and surrounded by large yards and gardens, so the buildings' vibrations did not propagate. Also, the building materials—mostly shingle and timber—were light.|$|E
5|$|There was {{extensive}} <b>damage</b> <b>to</b> <b>buildings</b> in Orkney and {{the surrounding}} areas, partly due to inadequate building construction vulnerable to earthquake damage. The Khuma township near Stilfontein {{was one of the}} worst affected areas, with more than 600 homes damaged by the earthquake. An aftershock occurred in Khuma in the afternoon of 5August while residents were assessing the damage to their homes. Three clinics in the North West province were damaged, leading to the closure of two of them. Two schools were damaged and some pupils were unable to attend classes as the classrooms were too badly damaged.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 1900s and 1910s, St. Louis began a {{building}} program that created parks and playgrounds in several deteriorating residential neighborhoods. Parks Commissioner (and former professional tennis player) Dwight F. Davis continued {{the development of}} recreational facilities during the early 1910s by expanding tennis facilities and building a public 18-hole golf course in northwest Forest Park. The St. Louis Zoo was constructed in Forest Park in the early 1910s {{under the leadership of}} Mayor Henry Kiel. Since the 1890s, St. Louis had attempted to control its air pollution problems with little success, but <b>damage</b> <b>to</b> <b>buildings</b> and flora made the issue more visible during the 1920s. Problems came to a head with the 1939 St. Louis smog, which blackened the sky and lasted for three weeks. A ban on burning low-quality coal solved the problem in December 1939, and the addition of natural gas for heating assisted homeowners in making the transition to cleaner fuels by the late 1940s.|$|E
