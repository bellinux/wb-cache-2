25|$|According to Ovid (43 BC–17 AD), the Sirens {{were the}} companions of young Persephone. They were given wings by Demeter {{to search for}} Persephone when she was abducted.

25|$|Fate {{generally}} implies {{there is}} a set course that cannot be deviated from, and over which one has no control. Fate is related to determinism, but makes no specific claim of physical determinism. Even with physical indeterminism an event could still be <b>fated</b> externally (see for instance theological determinism). Destiny likewise is related to determinism, but makes no specific claim of physical determinism. Even with physical indeterminism an event could still be destined to occur.|$|E

25|$|An {{asymmetrical}} cell division occurs in protodermal cells resulting in one large cell that is <b>fated</b> {{to become a}} pavement cell and a smaller cell called a meristemoid that will eventually differentiate into the guard cells that surround a stoma. This meristemoid then divides asymmetrically one to three times before differentiating into a guard mother cell. The guard mother cell then makes one symmetrical division, which forms a pair of guard cells. Cell division is inhibited in some cells so there is always at least one cell between stomata.|$|E
25|$|Wisdom was {{a popular}} genre in the ancient world, where it was {{cultivated}} in scribal circles and directed towards young men who would take up careers in high officialdom and royal courts; there is strong evidence {{that some of these}} books, or at least sayings and teachings, were translated into Hebrew and influenced the Book of Proverbs, and the author of Ecclesiastes was probably familiar with examples from Egypt and Mesopotamia. He may also have been influenced by Greek philosophy, specifically the schools of Stoicism, which held that all things are <b>fated,</b> and Epicureanism, which held that happiness was best pursued through the quiet cultivation of life's simpler pleasures.|$|E
25|$|Odysseus {{was curious}} {{as to what the}} Sirens sang to him, and so, on the advice of Circe, he had all of his sailors plug their ears with beeswax and tie him to the mast. He ordered his men to leave him tied tightly to the mast, no matter how much he would beg. When he heard their {{beautiful}} song, he ordered the sailors to untie him but they bound him tighter. When they had passed out of earshot, Odysseus demonstrated with his frowns to be released. Some post-Homeric authors state that the Sirens were <b>fated</b> to die if someone heard their singing and escaped them, and that after Odysseus passed by they therefore flung themselves into the water and perished.|$|E
25|$|There is {{evidence}} that Prometheus Bound was the first play in a trilogy conventionally called the Prometheia, but the other two plays, Prometheus Unbound and Prometheus the Fire-Bringer, survive only in fragments. In Prometheus Unbound, Heracles frees Prometheus from his chains and kills the eagle that had been sent daily to eat the Titan's perpetually regenerating liver. Perhaps foreshadowing his eventual reconciliation with Prometheus, we learn that Zeus has released the other Titans whom he imprisoned {{at the conclusion of}} the Titanomachy. In Prometheus the Fire-Bringer, the Titan finally warns Zeus not to lie with the sea nymph Thetis, for she is <b>fated</b> to give birth to a son greater than the father. Not wishing to be overthrown, Zeus would later marry Thetis off to the mortal Peleus; the product of that union will be Achilles, Greek hero of the Trojan War. Grateful for the warning, Zeus finally reconciles with Prometheus.|$|E
25|$|The Evolution Championship Series has {{historically}} been the largest fighting game tournament in the world, allowing free registration for {{anyone who wants to}} compete. Registration for the event closed on July 1, shortly after which the organization announced that the event had reached record-breaking entrant numbers. The Street Fighter V tournament had 5,107 registered entrants, making the biggest single-location tournament in fighting game history, doubling the number of entrants for Ultra Street Fighter IV the previous year. Evo 2016 also broke records for largest Super Smash Bros. tournament (2,662 entrants for Wii U, and 2,372 for Melee), largest Pokken Tournament tournament (1,180 entrants), and largest Killer Instinct tournaments (546 entrants).

25|$|The Symmeses {{had begun}} {{planning}} for the child's arrival long prior to his adoption. There were terms for his adoption {{that had to be}} met: he had to be born at the time and place appointed by the astrologers, his mother was to die shortly after giving birth, and he was to be of Anglo-Saxon Protestant descent. His childhood was stable, and his parents were popular and social members of their community—Edwin was a prominent architect and Minnehaha devoted much of her time to volunteering and serving on committees. He grew up surrounded by the occult in one form or another; he was well aware of the circumstances of his <b>fated</b> birth and adoption and his parents carefully interpreted his dreams. The family adopted a second child, Barbara Eleanor Symmes, in 1920. She was born one year minus one day after Duncan, on January 6, 1920. She also was selected under circumstances similar to that of her brother; her presence was expected to bring good karma into the family.|$|E
25|$|In {{the most}} {{well-known}} version of the myth, Oedipus was born to King Laius and Queen Jocasta. Laius wished to thwart a prophecy, so he left Oedipus to die on a mountainside. However, the baby was found by shepherds and raised by King Polybus and Queen Merope as their own. Oedipus learned from the oracle at Delphi of the prophecy that he would end up killing his father and marrying his mother but, unaware of his true parentage, believed he was <b>fated</b> to murder Polybus and marry Merope, so left for Thebes. On his way he met an older man and quarrelled, and Oedipus killed the stranger. Continuing on to Thebes, {{he found that the}} king of the city (Laius) had been recently killed, and that the city was {{at the mercy of the}} Sphinx. Oedipus answered the monster's riddle correctly, defeating it and winning the throne of the dead king – and the hand in marriage of the king's widow, and (unbeknownst to him) his mother Jocasta.|$|E
25|$|Though not {{appearing}} in Tekken 7s original arcade release, Nina returns in its updated title, Tekken 7: <b>Fated</b> Retribution. In the story mode, {{she was forced}} to work for the returning Heihachi in the first-half, until she began to concern about Lars' good reason on keeping Jin safe with him, deeming it very interesting to watch and resign from Zaibatsu, faking her death while setting her private assassination job for hire. She is later tasked with infiltrating a mafia wedding... posing as the bride. During the ceremony, a firefight broke out where Nina took out all her targets. However, the commotion had attracted the Tekken Force, who had been dispatched to suppress the violence, and they gave chase. With the Tekken Force in hot pursuit, Nina made her escape. That's when she bumped into a man she found vaguely familiar, who happens to be her son, Steve Fox. Steve wouldn't leave her alone. He seemed to have something he wanted to say to her... Nina decided that a confrontation was her best chance of escape.|$|E
25|$|Around this time, the time-traveller Kang the Conqueror {{arrived in}} Egypt and assumed the {{identity}} of Pharaoh Rama-Tut. Knowing who En Sabah Nur was <b>fated</b> to become and where he was, Rama-Tut sent his General Ozymandias and an army to destroy the Sandstormers and find the young Apocalypse. En Sabah Nur and Baal were injured and sought refuge in a cave. Before he died, Baal revealed advanced alien technology hidden in the cave, {{left behind by the}} deity-like aliens known as Celestials. Vowing revenge on Rama-Tut, En Sabah Nur entered the Pharaoh's city posing as a slave and drew the romantic attention of Ozymandias's sister, Nephri. On seeing the mutant's true appearance, Nephri rejected him and turned to her brother for protection. Heartbroken, En Sabah Nur's rage caused his mutant abilities to fully emerge. Rampaging, he renamed himself Apocalypse. Rama-Tut fled and En Sabah Nur used the Celestial technology to transform his former tormentor Ozymandias into a blind clairvoyant made of living stone, now enslaved to Apocalypse. As the years went on, Apocalypse found he no longer aged.|$|E
25|$|The fourteenth 13-day {{period of}} the tonalpohualli ritual {{calendar}} started with the day ce itzcuintli (1-dog) and people, especially rulers, were <b>fated</b> to be especially lucky if born on this day. The tenth day of the xiuhpohualli 20-day agricultural calendar, itzcuintli (dog), was governed by Mictlantecuhtli, the grim lord of the dead. In the Postclassic, when an Aztec commoner died he had to pass through each of the nine levels of Mictlan, the underworld. Mictlan was only reached {{after four years of}} wandering, accompanied by a dog that had been cremated with the deceased. The first level of Mictlan was called Apanoayan (where one crosses the river), this place was also known as Itzcuintlan (the Place of Dogs) because of the many dogs that roamed the near shore. A dog that recognised its former owner would carry him across the river on its back. In some accounts, the dogs on the shore act differently according to their colour, yellow dogs would carry the soul of the deceased across the river, while white dogs refuse because they have just washed themselves and black dogs refuse because either they have just swum the river or because they are dirty.|$|E

500|$|If {{his opponents}} objected that, if {{everything}} {{is determined by}} destiny, there is no individual responsibility, since what has been once foreordained must happen, come what may, Chrysippus replied {{that there is a}} distinction to be made between simple and complex predestination.

500|$|The wraith-blade {{attached}} to Raziel's arm, over-aroused after {{the deaths of}} the Sarafan, suddenly seizes control of the physical Reaver, and impales Raziel; Raziel, horrified, then realizes his destiny. He himself has always been the ravenous spirit inside the Reaver, and therefore is <b>fated</b> to be stuck in a time loop; the sword shattered against him in Soul Reaver because it was unable to consume itself. While his soul is being drawn into the sword, Kain emerges and tears the Reaver from Raziel's body, saving him in reciprocation and forcing history to reshuffle again. However, this paradox strains Nosgoth's history too far, enabling the Hylden to return and jeopardize his ambition to restore the Pillars. Amidst Kain's dismay, Raziel realizes that the wraith-blade is still bound to him, and laments that his destiny has not been changed, but merely [...]|$|E
500|$|Alternatively, {{some have}} speculated that [...] "The Climb" [...] {{parallels}} themes found within The Myth of Sisyphus, an essay by French absurdist writer Albert Camus.

Sisyphus was <b>fated</b> to roll a giant rock {{to the top of}} a hill only to have it roll back down and repeat the process once again, for eternity. As in The Myth of Sisyphus, the song asserts the absurdity of life with lines such as: [...] "There's always gonna be another mountain...Ain't about what's on the other side," [...] while at the same time drawing meaning from the cyclical task of labor and toil: [...] "It's the climb." [...] Beyond its philosophical similarities to The Myth of Sisyphus, the song also contains analogous tasks and metaphors, centered on the continuous struggle of ascending a hill.|$|E
500|$|The {{place of}} Cyrene within the poem has {{implications}} beyond {{the level of}} content, for if her narrative is {{to be connected to}} the city of Cyrene in Libya, the terminus post quem for the composition of the Catalogue would be 631 BC, the approximate year of that city's foundation. Pindar, Pythian 9 tells how Apollo saw Cyrene hunting in her native Thessaly and was immediately enamoured of the tomboy. The god goes to the cave of the wise centaur Chiron and asks who she is and whether {{it would be wise to}} consort with her. Chiron then prophesies that it is <b>fated</b> for Cyrene and Apollo to mate, and that he will bring her across the sea to Libya, where she will be queen of a portion of the land and bear to him a son, Aristaeus.

500|$|The Spanish Civil War has {{attracted}} directors from different countries. Sam Wood's For Whom the Bell Tolls (1943), based on Ernest Hemingway's {{book of the}} same name, portrays the <b>fated</b> romance between an American played by Gary Cooper and a partisan played by Ingrid Bergman {{against the backdrop of}} the civil war. The epic 168 minute film with its landscapes shot in Technicolor and a [...] "beautiful" [...] orchestral score was a success both with audiences and with critics. Alain Resnais's Guernica (1950) uses Picasso's [...] painting to protest against war. Carlos Saura's La Caza (The Hunt, 1966) uses the metaphor of hunting to criticise the aggressiveness of Spanish fascism. It won the Silver Bear for Best Director at the 16th Berlin International Film Festival in 1966. Ken Loach's Land and Freedom (Tierra y Libertad, 1995), loosely based on George Orwell's Homage to Catalonia, follows a British communist through the war to reveal the painful contradictions within the anti-fascist Republican side.|$|E
