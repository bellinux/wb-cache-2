5|$|Between its closing as a rail {{bridge and}} its reopening as a {{pedestrian}} span, the bridge has seen occasional fires; {{two in the}} 1970s, one in 1987 and one in 2008.

5|$|Founded in 2015, Donecle, a Toulouse {{start-up}} company, {{has also}} launched a drone approach which was initially specialized in {{the detection of}} lightning strikes on aeroplanes. Performed by five people equipped with harnesses and platforms, this inspection usually takes about <b>eight</b> <b>hours.</b> The immobilization of the aircraft and the staff are costly for the airlines, estimated at $10 000 per hour. The solution proposed by the start-up lasts twenty minutes.|$|E

He also {{became involved in the}} movement to institute the 8-hour day, co-founding the Grand <b>Eight</b> <b>Hour</b> League in Boston in 1863. This organization would change its name in 1868 to the Boston <b>Eight</b> <b>Hour</b> League. McNeill would serve as president of the <b>Eight</b> <b>Hour</b> League for <b>eight</b> years, taking part in that capacity in the successful lobbying of the state legislature for passage of a 10-hour day law in Massachusetts.|$|R

5|$|If {{the patient}} {{presents}} less than <b>eight</b> <b>hours</b> after paracetamol overdose, then acetylcysteine significantly {{reduces the risk}} of serious hepatotoxicity and guarantees survival. If acetylcysteine is started more than 8hours after ingestion, there is a sharp decline in its effectiveness because the cascade of toxic events in the liver has already begun, and the risk of acute liver necrosis and death increases dramatically. Although acetylcysteine is most effective if given early, it still has beneficial effects if given as late as 48hours after ingestion. In clinical practice, if the patient presents more than <b>eight</b> <b>hours</b> after the paracetamol overdose, then activated charcoal is not useful, and acetylcysteine is started immediately. In earlier presentations, charcoal can be given when the patient arrives and acetylcysteine is initiated while waiting for the paracetamol level results to return from the laboratory.|$|E
5|$|In January 1894, Cripple Creek mine owners J. J. Hagerman, David Moffat and Eben Smith, who {{together}} employed {{one-third of}} the area's miners, announced a lengthening of the work-day to ten hours (from eight), with no change to the daily wage of $3.00 per day. When workers protested, the owners agreed to employ the miners for <b>eight</b> <b>hours</b> a day – but at a wage of only $2.50.|$|E
5|$|Metformin has an oral {{bioavailability}} of 50–60% under fasting conditions, and {{is absorbed}} slowly. Peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) are reached within {{one to three}} hours of taking immediate-release metformin and four to <b>eight</b> <b>hours</b> with extended-release formulations. The plasma protein binding of metformin is negligible, as reflected by its very high apparent volume of distribution (300–1000l after a single dose). Steady state is usually reached {{in one or two}} days.|$|E

50|$|Late during 1935, the {{management}} of the Goodyear plant, which was by far the largest employer of rubber workers in the industry, introduced a plan for the reduction of hourly wages for workers as well as a move from six <b>hour</b> shifts to <b>eight</b> <b>hour</b> shifts. The reason for management's plan was to save money on labor. The move to <b>eight</b> <b>hour</b> shifts from six hour shifts would cause significant layoffs of around 1,200 workers, because with six hour shifts, four shifts of workers would be employed compared to three shifts of workers being employed under <b>eight</b> <b>hour</b> shifts. Eventually, Goodyear's management {{decided to go back to}} six hour shifts because of the displeasure voiced by workers.|$|R
5|$|National Airlines' New York-Miami route {{was usually}} flown by a Boeing 707 as Flight 601. On January 5, 1960, the 707 {{aircraft}} scheduled {{to fly to}} Miami was grounded due to cracks that were discovered in the cockpit windshield. The windshield replacement procedure would take <b>eight</b> <b>hours</b> to perform, so National Airlines transferred the passengers of Flight 601 to two propliner aircraft it had in reserve.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{breakout}} crew in {{the weapons}} storage began {{to inspect the}} missiles, an early-arriving transport crew hooked up the pylons and towed them away without inspecting or ensuring that the missiles had been inspected or cleared for removal. The munitions control center failed to verify that the pylon had received proper clearance and inspection and approved the pylon for loading on the B-52 at 0925. After taking <b>eight</b> <b>hours</b> to attach the pylons, the aircraft with the missiles loaded then remained parked overnight at Minot for 15 hours without the special guard required for nuclear weapons.|$|E

5|$|CANBAT 1 was {{expected}} to deploy one mechanised company each to the JORDBAT and the NEPBAT AORs to position themselves defensively.

The two companies required <b>eight</b> <b>hours</b> notice of the HV advance to reach their designated positions in time.

Although the storm had already made landfall, a tropical storm warning was issued from Freeport to Intracoastal City at 0400UTC on October16.
