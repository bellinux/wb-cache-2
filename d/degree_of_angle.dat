Methods: Direct DNA sequencing was utilized to screen six unrelated children with congenital glaucoma, each set of parents, and all siblings for CYP 1 B 1 mutations. Specimens of the anterior chamber angle obtained at trabeculectomy were examined histologically to identify abnormalities of the aqueous outflow pathway. CYP 1 B 1 mutations were correlated with both the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>angle</b> dysgenesis and the patient’s disease severity (age at diagnosis, difficulty in achieving intraocular pressure control). Results: Four of the six patients (66. 7 %) were compound heterozygotes for mutations in the CYP 1 B 1 gene. Seven of the eight CYP 1 B 1 mutations were identified, including two novel mutations (R 117 P, C 209 R) and five others previously described (G 61 E, R 368 H, R 390 H, E 229 K, 4340 delG). The cases were divided based on histological phenotype into categories of (1) severe goniodysgenesis highlighted by the agenesis of Schlemm’s canal (two patients), (2) moderate goniodysgenesis characterized by the presence of a band of collagenous tissue in the trabecular meshwork and/or the juxtacanalicular tissues (three patients), and (3) mild goniodysgenesis with deposition of a mucopolysaccharide material in the juxtacanalicular tissue (one patient). CYP 1 B 1 mutations were identified in both cases of severe angle dysgenesis and two of three cases of moderate dysgenesis. Disease severity closely correlated with the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>angle</b> dysgenesis. Conclusion: The majority of cases in the cohort had compound heterozygous CYP 1 B 1 mutations.

40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} the trabecular-iris angle with ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM) post cataract extraction after an acute attack of phacomorphic angle closure. METHODS: This prospective study involved 10 cases of phacomorphic angle closure that underwent cataract extraction and intraocular lens insertion after intraocular pressure (IOP) lowering. Apart from visual acuity and IOP, the trabecular-iris angle {{was measured by}} gonioscopy and UBM at 3 months post attack. RESULTS: In 10 consecutive cases of acute phacomorphic angle closure from December 2009 to December 2010, gonioscopic findings showed peripheral anterior synechiae (PAS) </= 90 degrees in 30 % of phacomorphic patients and a mean Shaffer grading of (3. 1 +/- 1. 0). UBM showed a mean angle of (37. 1 degrees +/- 4. 5 degrees) in the phacomorphic eye with the temporal quadrant being the most opened and (37. 1 degrees +/- 8. 0 degrees) in the contralateral uninvolved eye. The mean time from consultation to cataract extraction was (1. 4 +/- 0. 7) days and the mean total duration of phacomorphic angle closure was (3. 6 +/- 2. 8) days {{but there was no}} correlation to the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>angle</b> closure on UBM (Spearman correlation P= 0. 7). The presenting mean IOP was (50. 5 +/- 7. 4) mmHg and the mean IOP at 3 months was (10. 5 +/- 3. 4) mmHg but there were no correlations with the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>angle</b> closure (Spearman correlations P= 0. 9). CONCLUSION: An open trabecular-iris angle and normal IOP can be achieved after an acute attack of phacomorphic angle closure if cataract extraction is performed within 1 day - 2 days after IOP control. Gonioscopic findings were in agreement with UBM, which provided a more specific and object angle measurement. The superior angle is relatively more narrowed compared to the other quadrants. All contralateral eyes in this series had open angles...|$|E

The ejectors form an integral part of distillation columns, condensers and other heat exchange processes. In this study, CFD (computational fluid dynamics) analysis based on the finite volume method was employed to investigate the influence of angle of converging duct on the ejector performance. The <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>angle</b> of converging duct was varied at 0, 0. 25, 0. 5, 1. 25, 2. 0, and 2. 75. The using of CFD method allowed not only the accurate prediction of the performance but also the identification of the shock/expansion wave, the circulation zone, and the pressure distribution of the axial direction. Verification with experimental data was also undertaken at various operational conditions. The comparisons of entrainment ratio between experimental and CFD results for various suction and discharge pressures at a fixed motive pressure show a good agreement. CFD studies show that the increase of converging angle affects on the increase of static pressure field inside of mixing duct. Hence, the length of shock train region is also influenced by the angle of converging duct. It is observed from this study that the entrainment ratio of ejector is influenced by the angle of converging duct. Ejector with <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>angle</b> = 0. 5 gives the highest value and then decrease with reference to the increase of converging angle. The flow visualization of stream functions inside the ejector shows that the flow separation phenomena and recirculation conditions occur in the ejector with larger converging angle.

This system exhibits consistent reliable pattern of detection clearly distinguishable before and after intrusion. In such cases, even if the direct path is not obstructed, the reflected paths are definitely affected and hence the captured signals differ and can be analysed. In the proposed technique unlike the other sensory detection systems, there is no blind spot, which gives a truly contravene-less indoor intrusion detection system...|$|E

The stall aerodynamics of the gloved wing were analyzed and compared with the unmodified wing for the flight speed of 120 knots and altitude of 2300 ft {{above mean sea level}} (MSL). The Star-CCM+ polyhedral unstructured CFD code was first validated for wing stall predictions using the wing-body geometry from the First AIAA CFD High-Lift Prediction Workshop. It was found that the Star-CCM+ CFD code can produce results that are within the scattering of other CFD codes considered at the workshop. In particular, the Star-CCM+ CFD code was able to predict wing stall for the AIAA wing-body geometry to within 1 <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>angle</b> of attack as compared to benchmark wind-tunnel test data. Current results show that the addition of the laminar-flow wing glove causes the gloved wing to stall much earlier than the unmodified wing.

We analyzed age, gender, initial/final LogMAR VA, initial/final IOP, extent of iris and/or angle neovascularization, treatments, preexisting complications, concurrent medications, and follow-up duration. Results. The mean follow-up duration was 23. 8 ± 18. 8 months. At the final follow-up, 125 (72. 3 %) eyes had IOP ≤ 21 [*]mmHg.

Samples were collected from seventeen stratigraphic sections spanning the calciturbidities of the Yosunlukbayırı Formation and pelagic micrites of the Soğukçam Limestone. Because of rareness and difficulties for extracting of calcareous nannofossil species particularly zone markers in these type lithologies, nannoconids have particular attention in terms of biostratigraphy. Twenty nine species of nannoconids were recorded in the studied samples. Their taxonomy were revised and their stratigraphic ranges were given. The classification of genus Nannoconus {{is based on the}} gross morphology of the test, presence of central cavity or central canal, proportion of central cavity to thickness of the wall, proportion of height to width. Thickness of calcite elements, degree of horizontal intercept angle, type of apertures and degree of horizontal intercept angle, type of apertures, and <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>angle</b> of apertural elements are also used for description of the species. Fluctuations in nannoconid abundance are related to lithological changes. High abundance of nannoconids in limestones indicates clear surface water palaeoenvironments without terrigenous influx. From the stratigraphical point of view, their importance was clarified by their high abundance peaks. Problematic zonal boundaries of the nannofossil zonation could be determined by major nannoconid bioevents...|$|E

By computing the parametric modulation effect of the angle for different type of stimuli, we found that, as compared with the control conditions, the two types of Poggendorff illusion conjointly activated the right intraparietal sulcus (IPS). Moreover, the right IPS was involved in the neural interaction between the two types of illusions by showing higher neural activity in the illusory than in the real contour condition. Taken together, our results suggest that the right IPS is responsible for constructing the Poggendorff illusion driven by illusory contours...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Providing natural hand {{interaction}} between a virtual object and a user on Augmented Reality {{is a major}} issue to manipulate a rendered object in a convenient way. Conventional 2 D image-based recognition and interaction technique in AR has a limitation to perform a natural {{interaction between}} the user and the virtual object. In this paper, we present a stereo-vision based natural 3 D hand interaction with the augmented object. In the proposed 3 D hand interaction approach, 3 D hand location and finger direction can be easily obtained by using stereo-vision technique while user hand is approaching to the virtual object. Two types of hand manipulation for the augmented object such as the hand pointing and hand pinching are defined. The collision detection between user hand and the virtual object is determined by using a simple ray casting emitted from the user’s finger-point against the virtual object {{in the case of}} hand pointing. In the hand pinching, the collision is occurred when the thumb and the index finger are approaching to the object and the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>angle</b> between two fingers becomes a predetermined value. From the experiments, the proposed 3 D hand interaction method can control the virtual object in a natural way rather than using a vision-based 2 D hand interaction since the stereo-vision technique can obtain the depth information from the AR environments...|$|E

In this accident mitigation strategy, the decay heat removal capability depends on whether the imposed heat flux exceeds critical heat flux (CHF). To provide sufficient cooling for high-power reactors such as APR 1400, there have been some R&D efforts to use the reactor vessel with micro-porous coating and nanofluids boiling-induced coating. In present study, an experimental study has been conducted to investigate the viability of using graphene-oxide nanofluid under various coolant chemical environments to enhance CHF during ERVC. Pool boiling CHF experiments were carried out for the thin-wire heater with controlling the heater orientation from horizontal to vertical, or at 0 < theta < 90 degrees. The dispersion stability of graphene-oxide nanofluid in the chemical conditions of flooding water that includes boric acid, lithium hydroxide (DOH), and tri-sodium phosphate (TSP) was checked in terms of surface charge or zeta potential before the CHF experiments. Finally integral effects of graphene-oxide nanosheets and chemicals on CHF limits were investigated.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Blunt {{trauma is}} {{responsible}} for most eye injuries in urban populations. Anterior chamber angle recession {{has been reported to}} be the most common sign of previous blunt trauma to the eye. The cumulative lifetime prevalence of post-traumatic angle recession has not been reported previously, and the relation between angle recession and glaucoma in a population-based setting is unknown. METHODS: As part of a population-based glaucoma survey, gonioscopy was performed on 987 (82. 7 %) of 1194 inhabitants of the village of Mamre, near Cape Town, South Africa, who were 40 years of age or older. RESULTS: Some <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>angle</b> recession was identified in one eye of 60 people and in both eyes of 86 people. Men were affected more than three times as often as women in the fifth, sixth, and seventh decades. The cumulative lifetime prevalence of angle recession in this community was 14. 6 %. The prevalence of glaucoma in people with angle recession was 5. 5 % (8 / 146). Of 87 eyes with 360 degrees of angle recession, only 7 (8. 0 %) had glaucoma. Excessive alcohol consumption was significantly related to the presence of angle recession in women (P < 0. 001). The prevalence of monocular blindness due to trauma was 2. 5 % (25 / 987). CONCLUSION: Although the importance of the study may be limited to this community, the findings suggest that future population-based studies of ocular trauma should include gonioscopy on all individuals examined. Secondary glaucomas, especially those related to trauma, should be screened for in developing countries when trying to establish the prevalence of potential visual loss from glaucoma...|$|E
40|$|The {{intention}} {{of this research}} is to develop a new algorithm that it is mainly focus in the principle of echolocation or also called biosonar. This principle is active in many animals such as: birds, shrews, dolphins and bats, these last ones {{are going to be a}} fundamental part of our study. These animals use it as radar in order to find food, obstacles or just to locate objects. These animals use ultrasound beams with a certain <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>angle</b> and multiple receivers; such as the two ears that are located slightly apart, so at the time of the returning echo the difference of loudness and also the difference between the arriving of one ear and the other tells them different and useful details about their prey or object in question. The main focus is going to be in the study of the bats in top of any other echolocating animal. The algorithm developed and explained in this paper uses the radar method in order to explore the search space in the looking of the optimal solution. The algorithm searches the solution space within an initial angle of 180 degrees. This is because the bat has a sight of no more than 180 degrees. After that the angle is going to be a changing parameter according to the new conditions of the problem. Also in between each solution there is a boundary that contains two solutions and is a simulation of the two ears of the animals, which are located slightly apart. This algorithm is applied to the well-known Redundancy Allocation Problem (RAP), investigating a single objective and multiple objective functions. The single objective will consider only reliability while the multiple objective function will simultaneously try to maximize reliability and minimize the cost and weight of the system. ...|$|E
40|$|It {{is known}} that road {{geometric}} features significantly contributes to the variation in vehicle speed. According to conventional Highway Geometric design procedure there is no accurate method to predict actual vehicle speed with different combinations of geometric elements such as horizontal alignment and vertical alignment etc. This study explores a methodology to evaluate actual vehicle speed variation mainly considering geometry. In this paper after classification of all the design elements, a new predictor called “curvature Index” (the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>angle</b> variation per unit length) is introduced to represent actual horizontal alignment variation of a road segment including number of bends and nature of bends. The curvature index measures analyzed were: bend density (number of bends per km); cumulative angle (degrees per km); mean angle (degrees); and standard deviation of angles. The research confirmed that driver’s speed choices are more strongly related to curvature Index than curve design speed, and to the approach speed environment. Similar measures were carried out for vertical alignment variation and new predictor called “Elevation Index” is introduced to represent different combination of vertical alignments. International Roughness Index (IRI) and Road width selected as other predictors to obtain the correlation between Geometry and speed. The curvature index, elevation index and actual vehicle speed are estimated using the database of GPS (Global Positioning System) receivers. Data was collected at selected road segments in Sri Lanka under less traffic condition. A methodology developed to increase the reliability and accuracy of GPS data. Simple linear regression analysis is carried out using SPSS and MINI Tab software to develop actual vehicle speed model together with ArcGIS. ArcGIS (Geographical Information System) provides a good platform to graphical analysis of data and integrate with GPS data.
