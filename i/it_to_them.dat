5|$|I didn't {{even know}} the project was coming out. I didn't know what the beat was for; I just knew Eminem asked me for the files and I sent <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>them....</b> When I saw Eminem in L.A. for Grammy weekend, Eminem said, 'Yeah, he ripped the track.' Later on that day, I met Royce, and Royce was like, 'Yeah, {{download}} that track man. We ripped that track. That's the first single.' I was like, 'What?' But until then, I still wasn't sure.|$|E
5|$|The Philistines were infuriated by the riddle. The thirty groomsmen told Samson's {{new wife}} {{that they would}} burn her and her father's {{household}} {{if she did not}} discover the answer to the riddle and tell <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>them.</b> At the urgent and tearful imploring of his bride, Samson told her the solution, and she told it to the thirty groomsmen.|$|E
5|$|As Alcibiades had suspected, {{his absence}} emboldened his enemies, {{and they began}} to accuse him of other sacrilegious actions and {{comments}} and even alleged that these actions were connected with a plot against the democracy. According to Thucydides, the Athenians were always in fear and took everything suspiciously. When the fleet arrived in Catana, it found the state trireme Salaminia waiting to bring Alcibiades and the others indicted for mutilating the hermai or profaning the Eleusinian Mysteries back to Athens to stand trial. Alcibiades told the heralds that he would follow them back to Athens in his ship, but in Thurii he escaped with his crew; in Athens he was convicted in absentia and condemned to death. His property was confiscated and a reward of one talent was promised to whoever succeeded in killing any who had fled. Meanwhile, the Athenian force in Sicily, after a few early victories, moved against Messina, where the Generals expected their secret allies within the city to betray <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>them.</b> Alcibiades, however, foreseeing that he would be outlawed, gave information to the friends of the Syracusans in Messina, who succeeded in preventing the admission of the Athenians. With the death of Lamachus in battle some time later, command of the Sicilian Expedition fell into the hands of Nicias, whom modern scholars have judged to be an inadequate military leader.|$|E
25|$|Marrett's {{personal}} aircraft {{while serving}} with the 602d was an A-1J Skyraider, serial number 142029, maintained by crew chief Joseph Toback. The aircraft was named Sock <b>It</b> <b>To</b> <b>'Em</b> after the popular 1960s comedy television program, Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In. Three weeks after Marrett and Tobak returned home, Sock <b>It</b> <b>To</b> <b>'Em</b> {{was shot down}} by ground fire killing the pilot, Major James East, Jr. Forty-one years later, Marrett and Tobak were reunited at the Estrella Warbird Museum where they flew in Marrett's 1945 Stinson L-5 Sentinel that is also named Sock <b>It</b> <b>To</b> <b>'Em.</b> The A-1 Skyraider, Sock <b>It</b> <b>To</b> <b>'Em,</b> was memorialized as a plastic model by the Tamiya Corporation and a die-cast metal model by Hobby Master Limited.|$|R

5|$|Chris sets up {{a camera}} in his room to capture the creature. When he reviews the tape he finds no {{evidence}} of the Evil Monkey, and goes ahead with his plans on capturing him. The family is taken aback when Chris proves it is real by capturing the monkey, and showing <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>them,</b> but he turns {{out not to be}} evil after all. The monkey then explains himself to the Griffins for being here. He reveals that he got home from work one day and caught his wife cheating on him with another monkey. He went through a deep depression after the divorce, which costed him his job, and all his money was gone, meaning that he lost his house, so he moved into Chris's closet just until he finally got back on his feet, and has lived there for 9 years. He also reveals that the face he makes at Chris was what he makes when thinking, and he was really trying to talk with Chris this whole time (pointing at him was his only way of trying to start a conversation with him). In addition, the trembling was due to a copper deficiency. The monkey apologizes to Chris for unintentionally terrorizing him and wishes to start over. Chris is at first unconvinced, but when the monkey helps him write a book report, he is surprised to receive a passing grade, and the two become great friends.|$|E

25|$|Clinical {{trials of}} {{mifepristone}} in China began in 1985. In October 1988, China {{became the first}} {{country in the world}} to approve mifepristone. Chinese organizations tried to purchase mifepristone from Roussel Uclaf, which refused to sell <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>them,</b> so in 1992 China began its own domestic production of mifepristone. In 2000, the cost of medical abortion with mifepristone was higher than surgical abortion and the percentage of medical abortions varied greatly, ranging from 30% to 70% in cities to being almost nonexistent in rural areas.|$|E

25|$|The Los Angeles Police Department {{contacted}} Congresswoman Maxine Waters, a {{close friend}} of Bill Cosby for many years, to ask for his phone number. Waters declined to give <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>them,</b> instead asking another close friend, Essence magazine publisher Ed Lewis, {{to be the one to}} tell Cosby. However, the police contacted the CBS studio which produced his new series, Cosby, filmed in New York at Kaufman Astoria Studios in Queens. Cosby was on set at the time when producer Joanne Curley-Kerner informed him of the death of his son. Los Angeles police later spoke with him and discouraged him from flying to Los Angeles.|$|E
25|$|In the {{following}} investigation, {{it was discovered}} that the tent had not been fireproofed. Ringling Bros. had applied to the Army, which had an absolute priority on the material, for enough fireproofing liquid to treat their Big Top. The Army had refused to release <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>them.</b> The circus had instead waterproofed their canvas using an older method of paraffin dissolved in gasoline and painted onto the canvas. The waterproofing worked, but as had been repeatedly shown it was horribly flammable. Circus management was found to be negligent and several Ringling executives served sentences in jail. Ringling Brothers' management set aside all profits for the next ten years to pay the claims filed against the show by the City of Hartford and the survivors of the fire.|$|E
25|$|After 1936 Fischer {{still held}} contact with some parishioners. Christiane Ilisch (daughter of the Protestant {{literary}} historian Dr. Heinrich Spiero, classified a Jew, meaning within the Nazi ideology {{a member of}} a genetic group not a religion, which one could choose or secede from) and her husband asked Fischer to baptise their children. The German Christian-dominated presbytery denied <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>them,</b> regarding Christianity a religion reserved for persons of so-called Aryan blood and therefore to be denied to persons fully or partially of Jewish descent. Fischer thus baptised the children in a ceremony held in the Ilischs' private apartment. In 1941 Jerusalem Church, whose services after all the quarrels hardly attracted any congregants any more, was closed as a place of worship.|$|E

25|$|As {{discussed}} above, the Meiji {{government was}} unwilling to allow foreigners to own land, and instead lent <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> on a perpetual lease. These leases continued even after {{the return of the}} settlement to Japan, but Japan began a policy of taxing the buildings on the land. The foreigners were opposed to this {{on the grounds that they}} were already being taxed on the land itself, and so were being subjected to double taxation, and in 1902 the Japanese government presented the case to the Permanent Court of Arbitration. In 1905, Japan's plea was discarded, and Japan was disallowed from levying any taxes on buildings on the land under perpetual lease.|$|E
25|$|The Roman Curia has {{two other}} tribunals which either deal with {{specialized}} cases or {{which do not}} deal with cases at all. The first is the Apostolic Signatura, a panel of five cardinals which serves as the highest court in the Roman Catholic Church. Normal cases rarely reach the Signatura, the exception being if a party appeals to the Pope and he assigns the case to them or if the Pope on his own initiative pulls a case from another court and gives <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>them.</b> The court mainly handles cases {{regarding the use of}} administrative power, including penal cases which were decided using executive instead of judicial power, which is the usual case. It also handles disputes between dicasteries and other tribunals over jurisdiction, complaints that a Rotal decision is null and should be retried, and matters regarding advocates and inter-diocesan tribunals.|$|E

Mulder is saved by Agent Miller and they regroup with Scully, however she says Mulder needs a blood transfusion and only their son can give <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>them.</b> At that moment, an unidentified flying object hovers over the trio.|$|E

25|$|Abu Bakr's {{strategy}} was to give his generals their mission, the geographical area in which that mission would be carried out, and the resources that, could be made available for that purpose. He would then leave it to his generals to accomplish their missions in whatever manner they chose. On the other hand, Caliph Umar {{in the latter part}} of his Caliphate used to direct his generals as to where they would stay and when to move to the next target and who was to be commanding the left and right wing of the army in each particular battle. This made the phase of conquest comparatively slower but provided well-organized campaigns. Caliph Uthman used the same method as Abu Bakr: he would give missions to his generals and then leave <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> how they should accomplish it. Caliph Ali also followed the same method.|$|E
25|$|Gathering a {{group of}} acquaintances and hired help as the cast and crew, they decide to film a pornographic Star Wars parody, {{entitled}} Star Whores. Delaney, the film's producer and Zack's co-worker, rents film equipment and a building {{to use as a}} studio. When they return to the studio after the first night of filming, the building is being demolished, with all the equipment and costumes inside. They are told that the man that rented <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> had run off with the money. Later at the coffee shop where Zack works, he realizes that his boss threatened to install a hidden camera, which Zack finds and decides to use to replace their lost film equipment. Zack retools his film to take place in the coffee shop, revamping the film to one with a coffee shop motif, Swallow My Cockuccino. The group shoots the film after hours.|$|E

I said, where'd you hear that? I did it in two days. He said, Jimmy Iovine. So I went to Jimmy Iovine and I said all that to his, yeah it's true, I know. I blamed you but you can't be upset with me. I'm not like a writer. I've gotta make my way with these people. I had to have a scapegoat.|$|E

A phone call to the house is strangely cut off when Clarissa tells the caller that she is not Mrs. Brown but Mrs. Hailsham-Brown. Clarissa tells Sir Rowland that the house used to belong to a Mr. Sellon, a now-deceased antique dealer in Maidstone and the furnishings are his. His former trade means that enquiries are received about some of his furniture, including one for the desk that, unbeknown to her, Jeremy had been searching through earlier. Walking in on the conversation, Pippa tells the two that she has found out that the desk has a secret drawer and she shows <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> together with its contents: an envelope with three autographed papers inside with the signatures of Queen Victoria, John Ruskin and Robert Browning on them.|$|E
