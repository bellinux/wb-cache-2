5|$|After the war, {{the city}} {{underwent}} {{a process of}} urban renewal and expansion from the 1890s up to the 1920s. As downtown Lima had become overcrowded, the La Victoria residential area was established in 1896 as a working-class neighborhood. During this period the urban layout was modified by the construction of big avenues which crisscrossed the city and connected it with neighboring towns such as Miraflores. In the 1920s and 1930s, several buildings of the <b>historic</b> <b>centre</b> were rebuilt including the Government Palace and the Municipal Palace.|$|E

5|$|Kraków's <b>historic</b> <b>centre,</b> which {{includes}} the Old Town, Kazimierz and the Wawel Castle, was included as {{the first of its}} kind on the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites in 1978. The Stare Miasto is the most prominent example of an old town in the country. For many centuries Kraków was the royal capital of Poland, until Sigismund III Vasa relocated the court to Warsaw in 1596. The whole district is bisected by the Royal Road, the coronation route traversed by the Kings of Poland. The Route begins at St. Florian's Church outside the northern flank of the old city-walls in the medieval suburb of Kleparz; passes the Barbican of Kraków (Barbakan) built in 1499, and enters Stare Miasto through the Florian Gate. It leads down Floriańska Street through the Main Square, and up Grodzka to Wawel, the former seat of Polish royalty, overlooking the Vistula river. Old Town attracts visitors from all over the World. Kraków <b>historic</b> <b>centre</b> is one of the 13 places in Poland that are included in the UNESCO World Heritage Sites. The architectural design of the district had survived all cataclysms of the past and retained its original form coming from the medieval times. The Old Town of Kraków is home to about six thousand historic sites and more than two million works of art. Its rich variety of heritage architecture includes Gothic, Renaissance and Baroque buildings. Kraków's palaces, churches, theatres and mansions display great variety of color, architectural details, stained glass, paintings, sculptures, and furnishings.|$|E
5|$|In 1978, Karol Wojtyła, {{archbishop}} of Kraków, was elevated to the papacy as Pope John PaulII — the first Slavic pope ever, {{and the first}} non-Italian pope in 455 years. Also that year, UNESCO approved the first ever sites for its new World Heritage List, including the entire Old Town in inscribing Kraków's <b>Historic</b> <b>Centre</b> Kraków is classified as a global city with the ranking of high sufficiency by GaWC. Cited as one of Europe's most beautiful cities, {{as well as one}} of the most unique destinations in the world, its extensive cultural heritage across the epochs of Gothic, Renaissance and Baroque architecture includes the Wawel Cathedral and the Royal Castle on the banks of the Vistula river, the St. Mary's Basilica, Saints Peter and Paul Church and the largest medieval market square in Europe, the Rynek Główny. Kraków is home to Jagiellonian University, one of the oldest universities in the world and traditionally Poland's most reputable institution of higher learning.|$|E

40|$|Nowadays, {{conservation}} of old town centres {{is one of}} the main goals of several planning processes. For this reason, planning and historic centres' preservation can be considered synergetic concept (Frank &Petersen, 2002) and activities. Old city centres lost the role of residence and centres of services, so it important to trigger a process of reuse of <b>historic</b> <b>centres</b> through promotion of influence that residents have on social, economic and cultural vitality of the human fabric. Indeed, the role of residents in the requalification of <b>historic</b> <b>centres</b> is not sufficiently considered and it is understimated. Residents have an important role given that they can assure a high quality of life in <b>historic</b> <b>centres,</b> as they are the most important owners of the inner city, both because they have an interest in a high quality of life in the area where they live, and an economic interest related to the requalification given that the value of a building in a redeveloped area is higher than in a degradate zone...|$|R
40|$|Since the 1980 s, the {{promotion}} of heritage values has gradually become {{a relevant issue for}} urban planning. Together with the emergence of new peripheries, inner-city areas and particularly old <b>historic</b> <b>centres,</b> affected by deterioration due to the recession of the last decades, have been the object of study and actions. Consequently, the need to turn the <b>historic</b> <b>centres</b> into areas of development for the market, through legislative measures and investments in infrastructure and services, and the re-evaluation of the heritage value of existing buildings, oscillated between policies which, linked to the mechanisms of economic and cultural globalization, promoted tourism as a source of revenue while striving to find alternatives to gentrification. The renewed priority given to the development of inner-city areas, centred round the rehabilitation of their historic values and central nature, has generated innovative operating modes in the urban environment that seek to reconcile the challenges of modernity, particularly in regard to social inequalities with those of the past, and to rethink the central role of <b>historic</b> <b>centres,</b> their relations with the city and their development in terms of sustainability. The goal of our contribution is {{to gain a better understanding}} of the major challenges of the rehabilitation of <b>historic</b> <b>centres</b> within the framework of ‘innovative’ approaches to urban planning, aiming at promoting sustainable living conditions. The analysis is based on an ongoing comparative and transdisciplinary research project, in which the decision-making processes of concrete interventions for the rehabilitation of inner-areas with heritage value are being analyzed in different cities of the world: Buenos Aires, La Havana and Bangkok. The main questions that arose in our analysis concern the contexts allowing for innovation, focusing on those institutional arrangements, which, as modes of governance, were introduced in the interventions, studied. urban planning, innovative planning, urban governance, decision-making, sustainable development, <b>historic</b> <b>centres,</b> heritage values, access to the city...|$|R

The centres have all faced different problems and a variety of approaches have been utilised which are also examined. For each of the <b>historic</b> <b>centres</b> in the book the authors broadly cover a number of common themes: the policy and planning framework; management and regeneration action; environmental management; tourism and heritage management; and sustainability...|$|R

40|$|This paper aims to {{contrast}} {{the idea that}} the future of <b>historic</b> <b>centres</b> in today contemporary cities is to become ‘thematic parks’ oriented to a touristic urban economy. This idea is the epigonic legacy of a banal functionalism, the limits of which were highlighted since the Sixties of the last century by the criticisms against the schematic and poor application – i. e., the abuse – of the zoning town-planning techniques, and a reductive notion of living space. To conceive and set up the contemporary city as a patchwork of thematic parks and highly specialised urban parts will produce the effects of a relevant loss of its real habitability conditions. On the contrary, <b>historic</b> <b>centres</b> can play a meaningful, plural and complex role as ‘urbanity infrastructures’ in the cities of today...|$|R
