40|$|This study {{addresses}} force/movement {{control in}} a dynamic "hybrid" task: the master sub-task is continuous manual tracking {{of a target}} moving along an eight-shaped Lissajous figure, with the tracking error as the primary performance index; the slave sub-task is compensation of a disturbing curl viscous field, compatibly with the primary performance index. The two sub-tasks are correlated because the lateral force the subject must exert on the eight-shape must be proportional to the longitudinal movement speed in order to perform a good tracking. The results confirm that visuo-manual tracking is characterized by an intermittent control mechanism, in agreement with previous work; the novel finding is that the overall control patterns are not altered {{by the presence of}} a large <b>deviating</b> <b>force</b> field, if compared with the undisturbed condition. It is also found that the control of interaction-forces is achieved by a combination of arm stiffness properties and direct force control, as suggested by the systematic lateral deviation of the trajectories from the nominal path and the comparison between perturbed trials and catch trials. The coordination of the two sub-tasks is quickly learnt after the activation of the <b>deviating</b> <b>force</b> field and is achieved by a combination of force and the stiffness components (about 80 % vs. 20 %), which {{is a function of the}} implicit accuracy of the tracking task...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe Offshore Oil & Gas industry, {{shipping}} {{and the ocean}} resource development industries {{play a vital role}} in the development of a country. The harsh marine environment and the need to explore for hydrocarbons in deep and ultra-deep waters has put in place technology and specialized marine support vessels to explore and produce hydrocarbons from below the ocean bed. The specialized vessels engaged in such operations have to maintain a fixed position in relation to a fixed point at the ocean bed despite the harsh vessel position <b>deviating</b> <b>forces</b> of sea currents, waves and wind acting on the floating vessel as little change in the position may lead to accident in the sea. So by the method of “Dynamic Positioning” the vessel is kept stationary in the sea and then oil and gas is extracted by using drilling vessels or drill ships. This method also allows other vessels like crane vessels, shuttle tanker, dredging and rock dumping vessels, pipelay, cable lay and cable repair vessels to remain stationary in sea so that extraction process takes place efficiently...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Robot-generated <b>deviating</b> <b>forces</b> during multijoint {{reaching}} {{movements have}} been applied to investigate motor control and to tune neuromotor adaptation. Can the application of force to limbs improve motor learning? In this framework, the response to altered dynamic environments of children affected by primary dystonia has never been studied. Methods As preliminary pilot study, eleven children with primary dystonia and eleven age-matched healthy control {{subjects were asked to}} perform upper limb movements, triangle-reaching (three directions) and circle-writing, using a haptic robot interacting with ad-hoc developed task-specific visual interfaces. Three dynamic conditions were provided, null additive external force (A), constant disturbing force (B) and deactivation of the additive external force again (C). The path length for each trial was computed, from the recorded position data and interaction events. Results The results show that the disturbing force affects significantly the movement outcomes in healthy but not in dystonic subjects, already compromised in the reference condition: the external alteration uncalibrates the healthy sensorimotor system, while the dystonic one is already strongly uncalibrated. The lack of systematic compensation for perturbation effects during B condition is reflected into the absence of after-effects in C condition, which would be the evidence that CNS generates a prediction of the perturbing forces using an internal model of the environment. The most promising finding is that in dystonic population the altered dynamic exposure seems to induce a subsequent improvement, i. e. a beneficial after-effect in terms of optimal path control, compared with the correspondent reference movement outcome. Conclusions The short-time error-enhancing training in dystonia could represent an effective approach for motor performance improvement, since the exposure to controlled dynamic alterations induces a refining of the existing but strongly imprecise motor scheme and sensorimotor patterns. </p...|$|R
30|$|Introspective {{reports by}} the {{participants}} described their own personal judgment criteria after the experiment, with most participants referring to a “sense of sticking” when touching the vibrating contactor. This “sense of sticking” {{is assumed to be}} a rapid variation in the friction force rather than literal physical sticking between the finger pad and the contactor. Such variations in the friction were prominent for the conditions where the participants ranked high in terms of the perceived friction, as shown in Fig.  10 (middle). Based on these reports, it is reasonable to speculate that a temporal variation in the friction force caused by the change in the relative velocity might have led to the increase in the perceived friction. In other words, the increased perception may be in part due to the perceptive properties of humans to rapidly <b>deviating</b> friction <b>forces</b> rather than an increase in the average friction or coefficient of friction.|$|R
30|$|The {{proposed}} injury {{mechanism is}} that there is an axial trauma of the wrist while the hand is gripping an object in slight ulnar deviation [13]. Thus, {{as a result of the}} trauma, the hand is <b>deviated</b> ulnarly with <b>force,</b> as in a motorcyclist holding his handle bar and hitting an object. The force needed to obtain an axial carpal injury is considerable and often results in a fracture of the scaphoid or styloid process of the radius. For the same reason, these injuries mostly involve massive soft tissue trauma to the hand and present often as open fractures [11, 14].|$|R

However, the agreement is not exact, possibly due to uncertainties in the optical properties of the silicon substrate...|$|R

30|$|To {{prove the}} theory of a FSS-triggered effect on {{different}} cell lines, several in vitro investigations using different flow chambers were conducted [5, 9 – 12]. In osteoblasts, biochemical responses on FSS in form of an increased intracellular calcium production [13 – 15] and an increased release of prostaglandins were reported [15 – 19]. FSS stimulation of osteoblasts also improved the cell adhesion by enhancing the affinity of intracellular integrins to extracellular matrix ligands {{as well as to}} biomaterial surfaces [20, 21]. Shear forces’ triggered effects on osteoblasts could be detected at a value of 10  dyn/cm 2, which almost reflects the in vivo situation [4, 22, 23]. Todays’ frequently used flow chambers mainly simulate the in vivo formed shear forces. However, it is difficult to ensure the required reproducibility and linear flow conditions. The most distinctive feature of currently used flow chambers is a liquid flow along rigidly fixed cell-bearing surfaces. Some of the above mentioned flow devices are either operating with a constant flow velocity or using pulsating flow profiles, which should be applied in case of analysing blood flow characteristics [9, 24]. Computerised investigations of flow chambers by Anderson et al. [4] have shown that <b>deviating</b> shear <b>forces</b> occur in the same flow chamber after repeating the same experiment twice. Consequently, different results of stimulation and cells response are obtained. Another downside of reported flow chambers is the inability to simultaneously set different shear forces in a single experiment.|$|R

The Hall elements have almost equal offsets, the offset {{temperature drift}}s are perfectly matched and Hall voltages are equal in value but of opposite sign.

40|$|Measuring {{quantitative}} tip–sample interaction {{forces in}} dynamic {{atomic force microscopy}} in fluids is challenging because of the strong damping of the ambient viscous medium and the fluid-mediated driving forces. This holds in particular for the commonly used acoustic excitation of the cantilever oscillation. Here we present measurements of tip–sample interactions due to conservative DLVO and hydration forces and viscous dissipation forces in aqueous electrolytes using tips with radii varying from typical 20 nm for the DLVO and hydration forces, to 1 μm for the viscous dissipation. The measurements are analyzed using a simple harmonic oscillator model, continuous beam theory with fluid-mediated excitation and thermal noise spectroscopy (TNS). In all cases consistent conservative <b>forces,</b> <b>deviating</b> less than 40 % from each other, are obtained for all three approaches. The DLVO forces are even within 5 % of the theoretical expectations for all approaches. Accurate measurements of dissipative forces within 15 % of the predictions of macroscopic fluid dynamics {{require the use of}} TNS or continuous beam theory including fluid-mediated driving. Taking this into account, acoustic driving in liquid is quantitatively reliable...|$|R
40|$|Children who exhibit gait {{deviations}} often {{present a}} range of bone deformities, particularly at the proximal femur. Altered gait may affect bone growth and lead to deformities by exerting abnormal stresses on the developing bones. The objective {{of this study was}} to calculate variations in the hip joint contact forces with different gait patterns. Muscle and hip joint contact forces of four children with different walking characteristics were calculated using an inverse dynamic analysis and a static optimisation algorithm. Kinematic and kinetic analyses were based on a generic musculoskeletal model scaled down to accommodate the dimensions of each child. Results showed that for all the children with altered gaits both the orientation and magnitude of the hip joint contact <b>force</b> <b>deviated</b> from normal. The child with the most severe gait deviations had hip joint contact forces 30 % greater than normal, most likely due to the increase in muscle forces required to sustain his crouched stance.

Various scenarios including without and with bullet failure models were further investigated to determine the mechanisms of the bullet failure. The agreement between numerical and experimental results had significantly increased with including the bullet failure criterion and the bullet nose erosion threshold into the simulation. As shown in results, good agreement between Ls-Dyna simulations and experimental data was achieved and the defeating mechanism of perforated plates was clearly demonstrated...|$|R
40|$|The reafference {{model has}} {{frequently}} {{been used to}} explain spatial constancy during eye and head movements. We have found that its basic concepts also form part of the information processing necessary for the control and recalibration of reaching movements. Reaching was studied in a novel force environment [...] a rotating room that creates centripetal forces of the type that could someday substitute for gravity in space flight, and Coriolis forces which are side effects of rotation. We found that inertial, noncontacting Coriolis <b>forces</b> <b>deviate</b> the path and endpoint of reaching movements, a finding that shows the inadequacy of equilibrium position models of movement control. Repeated movements in the rotating room quickly lead to normal movement patterns and to a failure to perceive the perturbing forces. The first movements made after rotation stops, without Coriolis forces present, show mirror-image deviations and evoke perception of a perturbing force even though none is present. These patterns of sensorimotor control and adaptation can largely be explained {{on the basis of}} comparisons of efference copy, reafferent muscle spindle, and cutaneous mechanoreceptor signals. We also describe experiments on human locomotion using an apparatus similar to that which Mittelstaedt used to study the optomotor response of the Eristalis fly. These results show that the reafference principle relates as well to the perception of the forces acting on and exerted by the body during voluntary locomotion...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} price of {{stability}} in undirected network design games with fair cost sharing. Our work provides multiple new pieces of evidence that the true price of stability, at least for special subclasses of games, may be a constant. We make progress on this long-outstanding problem, giving a bound of O(log log log n) on {{the price of}} stability of undirected broadcast games (where n is the number of players). This is the first progress on the upper bound for this problem since the O(log log n) bound of [Fiat et al. 2006] (despite much attention, the known lower bound remains at 1. 818, from [Bilò et al. 2010]). Our proofs introduce several new techniques that may be useful in future work. We provide further support for the conjectured constant price of stability {{in the form of a}} comprehensive analysis of an alternative solution concept that <b>forces</b> <b>deviating</b> players to bear the entire costs of building alternative paths. This solution concept includes all Nash equilibria and can be viewed as a relaxation thereof, but we show that it preserves many properties of Nash equilibria. We prove that the price of stability in multicast games for this relaxed solution concept is Θ(1), which may suggest that similar results should hold for Nash equilibria. This result also demonstrates that the existing techniques for lower bounds on the Nash price of stability in undirected network design games cannot be extended to be super-constant, as our relaxation concept encompasses all equilibria constructed in them...|$|R
40|$|Structural ringing can {{be caused}} by {{non-linear}} hydrodynamic loads in steep waves, by wave slamming, or by breaking waves. This thesis deals with the first category: non-linear wave loads on bottom-fixed offshore wind turbines in storm condition. Two higher order forcing models are investigated. The FNV (Faltinsen, Newman, Vinje) model accounts for wave loads on a surface piercing column of up to third order of the incident wave field. It is derived by a perturbation of the non-dimensional wave steepness, and requires the column radius to be of the same order of magnitude as the wave amplitude. The higher order FNV forces have their maximum at the free surface, and are decaying exponentially with the water depth. Rainey's slender body forces are not derived using a perturbation approach, but rather by conservation of energy principles. It will be shown that there is agreement {{between the first and second}} order forces from FNV and Rainey for regular waves in deep water, while the third order component <b>deviates.</b> Both <b>force</b> models are derived in this thesis. A popular software for dynamic analysis of wind turbines is the open source FAST (Fatigue, Aerodynamics, Structures and Turbulence) code from NREL (National Renewable Energy Laboratory). FAST is capable of producing a time marching simulation of an offshore wind turbine subjected to various environmental loads. However, FAST only supports linear hydrodynamic loads natively. Thus, the force model of interest have to be implemented in the code. An explanation of the theoretical foundation and architecture of FAST is given, as well as details of the force model implementation. A test case in regular waves comparing the individual force components is conducted, where agreement between the first and second order components was shown, as previously stated. Dynamic analysis of a wind turbine model based on the NREL reference turbine is performed for different environmental condition, operational states and turbine configurations. The first natural frequency of the tower is held fixed for all the configurations, to not coincide with the rotor and blade passing frequencies. The magnitude of the top displacement of the turbine was shown to be relatively independent of different tower configurations and forcing models near the natural frequency. No instances of significant structural response due to higher order effects was observed. The effect was however higher for the examined configurations with a non-stiff foundation and flexible tower. It is recommended that future work should investigate the effect of including non-linear wave motion for better modeling of steep waves, as well as the effect of non-linear structural response of the wind turbine. </p...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn {{this work}} we review our recent {{experimental}} and theoretical {{results on the}} flow instabilities observed in magnetorheological (MR) fluids subjected to applied magnetic fields. We study three types of MR fluids, consisting of suspensions of respectively silica-coated iron particles, carbonyl iron particles and CoNi fibers dispersed in a liquid carrier, and subjected to two types of flow, shear flow between parallel plates and pressure-driven flow through a capillary. In all cases {{we found that the}} flow curves showed a decreasing branch corresponding to a region of negative differential viscosity, for which a stable steady-state flow was impossible. We found different physical reasons for the observed instabilities. For shear flow between parallel plates of highly concentrated suspensions of spherical iron particles, fracture of the magnetic field-induced particle structures in combination with shear localization were {{on the basis of the}} observed instabilities. Periodic formation and fracture of the particle structures due to the magnetic field gradient and the hydrodynamic drag forces respectively was responsible for instabilities in the case of pressure-driven flow through a capillary of suspensions of spherical iron particles. In the case of suspensions of CoNi fibers, interparticle friction forces were in the origin of the obtained negative differential viscosity, as a consequence of hindering fiber reorientation inside the aggregates as they were <b>deviated</b> by shear <b>forces</b> from the direction of the applied field. In addition to the interest of this work from a fundamental point of view, its practical relevance stands on the importance of a detailed knowledge of the conditions that give rise to instabilities in order to rule them out and avoid malfunction of technological devices based on the MR effect...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} active {{dynamics}} of self-propelled asymmetrical colloidal particles (Janus particles) fueled by an AC electric field. Both {{the speed and}} {{the direction of the}} self-propulsion and the strength of attractive interaction between the particles can be controlled by tuning the frequency of the applied electric field and the ion concentration of the solution. The strong attractive force at high ion concentration give rise to chain formation of the Janus particles, which {{can be explained by the}} quadrupolar charge distribution on the particles. The chain formation is observed irrespective of the direction of the self-propulsion of the particles. When both the positions and the orientations of the heads of chains are fixed, they exhibit beating behavior reminiscent of eukaryotic flagella. The beating frequency of the chains of the Janus particles depends on the applied voltage and thus on the self-propulsive force. The scaling relation between the beating frequency and the self-propulsive <b>force</b> <b>deviates</b> from theoretical predictions made previously on active filaments. However, this discrepancy is resolved by assuming that the attractive interaction between the particles is mediated by the quadrupolar distribution of the induced charges, which gives indirect but convincing evidence on the mechanisms of the Janus particles. This signifies that the dependence between the propulsion mechanism and the interaction mechanism, which had been dismissed previously, can modify dispersion relations of beating behaviors. In addition, hydrodynamic interaction within the chain and its effect on propulsion speed are discussed. These provide new insights on active filaments such as optimal flagellar design for biological functions. Comment: 23 pages, 6 figures. Resolution of Fig. 3 is reduced for arXi...|$|R
40|$|The {{practicability}} {{of using}} a stretched cable for a rocket launching device is dependent primarily upon the transverse movement of the rocket and the stresses involved in the system. This requires analysis {{of the effects of}} the moving rocket mass on the cable from the instant of contact, and the problem reduces to one of wave propagation. The analysis here is restricted essentially to developing a procedure by which the initial motion of the mass can be calculated, and an expression is obtained which permits determination of the deflections. The problem is approached by first assuming that the mass exerts a constant transverse force on the cable. Admittedly, this is a simplifying assumption, and the result is not valid for the instant the mass hits the cable or for a short time thereafter because the inertia of the mass is not considered. Next, the problem is solved by taking into account the dynamics of the mass, and the solution reveals that the path of the actual mass <b>deviates</b> from the <b>force</b> path by as much as twenty percent during the initial motion but soon returns to the force path. The mass does not exert its full force on the cable at the instant of contact, but comes down on the cable with full force a short time later. Since maximum stresses on the system occur at this time, this factor is an important result of the analysis. Further, it is shown that increased velocity of the mass increases the deviation from the force path, and increased mass lengthens the time of return to the force path...|$|R
40|$|Pairwise {{interactions}} between n-alkanes from decane to octadecane in water {{have been studied}} by single-molecule force spectroscopy. The interacting molecules are covalently tethered to the glass substrate and to the probe of an atomic force microscope by water-soluble linkers to facilitate single-molecule detection. However, the measured distribution of rupture <b>forces</b> <b>deviates</b> significantly from the distribution predicted by theoretical models for rupture of individual bonds. To describe the statistics of rupture forces, an analytical model that considers near-simultaneous rupture of two bonds loaded by tethers with different lengths is introduced. The common most probable force analysis approach is used for comparison. In both data analyses, the possible systematic errors due to nonlinear elasticity of polymeric tethers and variations {{in the shape of}} the potential of mean force were considered. Experimental distributions of rupture forces are well-fit by the two-bond rupture model using a single set of kinetic parameters for different experiments, while the most probable force approach yields parameters that vary significantly for different samples. The measured activation energies for dissociation of alkanes are close to the free energies predicted by cavity models of hydrophobic interactions. The surface free-energy density is estimated to be ∼ 21 kJ/(mol nm^ 2) and is close to the upper limit of free energies used in the computer simulations of hydrophobic interactions in proteins. In contrast to the predictions of the cavity models, the measured activation energy does not increase monotonically with increase in alkane chain size. To explain this discrepancy and the measured distance to the transition-state barrier (∼ 0. 6 nm), it is suggested that alkanes undergo conformational transition to the collapsed state upon dimerization. Change in the alkane conformation from extended to helical has been observed previously for binding of alkanes in water to hydrophobic synthetic receptors. Here, however, conformational change is suggested without geometrical constraints imposed by small cavitands. The proposed collapsed state of the alkane dimers has implications for the kinetics of self-assembly of surfactant micelles...|$|R
40|$|Musculo Skeletal Disorders (MSDs) {{especially}} those of the upper limb are a highly prevalent occupational health problem in industry incurring substantial costs. A link has been shown between physical risk factors and the causation of MSDs, in particular, high levels of <b>force,</b> <b>deviated</b> postures and repetitive movements. These have each been associated with increased operator discomfort in industry and laboratory experiments. Ergonomic interventions reducing {{the effects of these}} risk factors have been demonstrated to lower discomfort but also increase productivity. There are many case studies which have reported on the relationship between physical risk factors, associated discomfort and productivity, but few {{attempts have been made to}} investigate the relationship and model it. A laboratory study was conducted to test the hypothesis that physical risk factors effect discomfort and that this in turn effects productivity. Participants performed repetitive grip exertions involving combinations of three levels of grip force (10, 20 and 30 % MVC), repetition (10, 15 and 20 repetitions per minute) and wrist posture (50 % flexion/extension and neutral). Treatments were performed for 10 min after which the participants were instructed to adjust the cycle time to a self-selected-pace (the productivity measure) for the remaining 10 min. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was performed on the data and the results indicated that each of the main factors had significant effects on discomfort at 10 min. Self-pace cycle time was significantly affected by force and posture. Correlation and regression analysis revealed a strong relationship between discomfort and self-pace cycle time. Path analysis revealed that discomfort was a mediating variable in the relationship between the primary risk factors and self-paced cycle time. These data indicate that reducing discomfort by reducing risks associated with high <b>forces</b> and <b>deviated</b> postures could help improve productivity for self-paced-work.

40|$|Physical {{risk factors}} and their {{combinations}} {{are linked to the}} causation of Musculo Skeletal Disorders (MSDs) which has implications for on-site operator productivity. Current risk assessment methods have no element to account for productivity improvements associated with risk reduction. Engineering methods such as MTM are limited in their ability to consider the physical effects of physical risk factors. Productivity is an important benefit of many ergonomic interventions. Therefore, productivity benefits are not fully exploited when the results of ergonomic cost benefit analyses are communicated to management. The effects of on-site productivity loss are often much greater than productivity loss associated with absence from work. The purpose of this research was to develop a quantitative presenteeism model to estimate the productivity benefits of ergonomic interventions for short cycle assembly work. Results of an industrial study revealed that in the companies investigated MSDs were prevalent and discomfort levels were high. MSDs and discomfort affect operator’s on-site performance and also result in absence from work. High levels of <b>force,</b> <b>deviated</b> postures were present in combination and for long durations of exertion. A series of experiments were conducted involving repetitive grip exertions of the upper limb to investigate the relationship between physical risk factors, discomfort and productivity. Twenty seven participants completed the first experiment to investigate and model the relationship between force, posture, repetition, discomfort and productivity (Self Paced Cycle Time (SPCT)). In the second experiment (21 participants) the relationship between Self selected DCT, discomfort, force and duration of exertion was studied. Multiple regression analysis was used to develop a predictive model for duty cycle time based on force and exertion period, and this was a good fit to the data (R 2 = 0. 98,p < 0. 05). Profiles were generated presenting zones of acceptable self-selected duty cycle times based on force and exertion. Twelve participants preformed the third experiment to investigate the effects of grip type and posture on forearm muscle activity, the effects of grip type and posture on endurance and the effects of force, grip type and posture on performing a precision task (Fitt’s tap test). Eighteen participants were involved in the fourth experiment to profile risk factor effects over a range of grip types. Data from experiments one, two and four were used to develop profiles of DCT, regression equations, data and models to populate the productivity model. The model presents a way of quantitatively estimating on-site productivity benefits from ergonomic interventions. Benefits communicated as DCT are easily understood and may be used to better estimate cost savings on the basis of productivity improvements...|$|R
40|$|The {{number of}} MNEs have {{increased}} substantially in recent years, putting {{a strain on}} international tax rules which have not developed at the same pace. Many of these MNEs have kept their tax bill at a minimum by shifting profits to low tax jurisdictions by using transfer prices that do not accord with economic reality. In response hereto, many tax jurisdictions have implemented domestic anti-avoidance legislation to assist tax authorities in curbing tax avoidance resulting from the manipulation of transfer prices. SA {{is an example of}} such a country. These anti-avoidance provisions typically involve a primary and secondary adjustment. The primary adjustment requires that an adjustment be made to the transfer price used by the MNE in the event that the said price does not reflect an arm's length price. The secondary adjustment concerns itself with making the actual allocation of funds consistent with the primary adjustment by deeming there to be another transaction, i. e. the secondary transaction. In SA, this secondary adjustment {{takes the form of a}} deemed distribution of an asset in specie in the case of residents who are companies. As such, this secondary transaction (i. e. the deemed dividend) is subject to Dividends Tax in SA levied at the domestic rate. This study considered whether such a deemed dividend will qualify for treaty relief in the form of the reduced rate provided for by Article 10 of the OECD MTC and UN MTC. In making this analysis, three main issues where specifically considered, namely (i) whether the SA company paying the Dividends Tax will have access to treaty relief in cases where Dividends Tax is not listed as a covered tax in the relevant tax treaty, (ii) whether a deemed dividend under a secondary adjustment in terms of SA domestic law falls within the dividend definition contained in Article 10. 3 of the OECD and UN MTC, and finally (iii) whether the relevant deemed dividend can be regarded as 'paid' for purposes of Article 10. 1 and 10. 2 of the OECD MTC and UN MTC. It was concluded that the SA Company will not qualify for the reduced rate provided for by tax treaties modelled on the OECD MTC and UN MTC as the deemed dividend does not fall within the ambit of the dividend definition contained in these model treaties. However, some of SA's tax treaties currently in <b>force,</b> <b>deviate</b> from the wording used in these model treaties to such an extent that it brings deemed dividends under a secondary adjustment in SA within the scope of the dividend definition, and in doing so, provides the SA Company with access to the reduced rates provided for in tax treaties. Examples hereof are the tax treaties that SA have concluded with the UK and NZ. Should SA decide to adopt a more 'forgiving' approach towards the availability of relief for secondary adjustments, it is recommended that SA either amend the domestic relief provisions to allow access to such relief, or amend the dividend definition contained in the tax treaties it currently has in force to include deemed dividends in terms of secondary adjustments in SA. The first approach is preferred as it is not always possible and timely to amend tax treaties currently in force...|$|R
40|$|This thesis reports {{numerical}} {{and analytical}} {{results on the}} floatation and capillary interaction of granular–sized objects at liquid–fluid interfaces. Such objects create deformations at the liquid surfaces which result in their interaction with each other. It has been experimentally shown that this effect {{can be used for}} self-assembly of ordered structures, and there are examples in the natural world too. The deformation created by a solid object at a liquid interface is governed by the Laplace-Young equation and appropriate boundary conditions. This is a nonlinear differential equation which is hard in general to solve analytically, and only approximate solutions exist for most of the interesting cases. We develop a new numerical solution to determine the shape of a liquid interface in the vicinity of multiple solid objects using the hp–Meshless Cloud method, which is a meshfree finite difference method. This solves the nonlinear Laplace-Young equation without any approximations. First a system is considered where circular cylinders are immersed in a liquid. The meniscus shape is determined, and the force of interaction between a pair of cylinders is calculated {{as a function of the}} distance between them. The results are compared with previously published asymptotic solutions and experimental results. When the cylinders are sufficiently far apart, the experimental results agree with both the numerical and asymptotic results. However, as the cylinders move closer, the asymptotic solution is unable to explain the experimental results because this solution is valid only in regions with small meniscus slopes. In contrast, the numerical solution is able to accurately explain the experimental results at all distance ranges. The numerical solution is further extended to solve for two elliptical cylinders at a liquid interface. Additionally, a new analytical solution is also developed for this problem. For the case of an isolated cylinder, this analytical solution is able to predict the same contact line shapes and meniscus profiles as the numerical solution. Both the solutions show that the force of attraction between a pair of elliptical cylinders is larger when they are in the tip–to–tip orientation, and smaller in the side–to–side orientation. The difference between the forces in the two orientations diminishes at large inter–cylinder separations. It is also shown that the meniscus far away from an elliptical cylinder is same as one created by a circular cylinder with perimeter equal to that of the elliptical cylinder. The numerical solution is further developed to solve for multiple floating spheres. This is a complicated condition compared to the vertical cylinders be-cause the vertical locations of the spheres and the horizontal projections of the three–phase contact lines are not known a priori. A new algorithm is developed to simultaneously satisfy the force balance, Laplace–Young equation and the geometric properties of the spheres. This shows that floating and sinking of a pair of spheres can depend on their relative positions. An unexpected and new result is obtained: at an intermediate inter–particle distance range, a sphere that would sink in isolation can float as a part of a pair or a cluster. A simple and new semi–analytical solution is also developed, which also predicts the same behaviour. Additionally, the numerical solution predicts that a sphere that would float in isolation would sink as a part of a pair at very small inter-particle distances. This numerical solution is then extended to determine the force of attraction between pairs of floating spheres. This is studied experimentally as well, by tracking the movement of particles at a liquid interface. Asymptotic solutions have previously been published for this problem. The numerical solution shows that the <b>force</b> <b>deviates</b> from the predictions of these asymptotic expressions when the density of the spheres is high. At small densities such as those used in the experiments, the asymptotic solutions correctly predict the force of attraction...|$|R
