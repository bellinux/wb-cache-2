5|$|Ordinarily, spinner sharks do {{not pose}} a {{substantial}} danger to humans; they do not perceive large mammals as prey, as their small, narrow teeth are adapted for grasping rather than cutting. However, they can become <b>excited</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> presence of food, so caution is warranted if this species is encountered while spearfishing. As of 2008, the International Shark Attack File listed 16 unprovoked attacks and one provoked attack attributable to the spinner shark, none of them fatal.|$|E
5|$|Bernstein {{states that}} Washington's lynching {{was a unique}} event because it {{occurred}} {{in a city with}} a reputation for progressiveness, but was attended by thousands of people who were <b>excited</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> brutal torture. Similar acts of mob violence typically occurred in smaller towns with fewer spectators. William Carrigan of Rowan University argues that the culture of central Texas had glorified retributive mob violence for decades before Washington's lynching, maintaining that this culture of violence explains how such a brutal attack could be publicly celebrated. Hale posits that Washington's death signaled a transition in the practice of lynching, demonstrating its acceptance in modernized, 20th-century cities. She notes that Washington's lynching illustrates how technological innovations, such as telephones and inexpensive photographs, could empower lynch mobs but also increase society's condemnation of their actions.|$|E

5|$|During the Japanese {{occupation}} from 1942 to 1945, the nation's {{film industry}} nearly ceased to exist: {{all but one}} studio were closed, and all films released were propaganda pieces to assist the Japanese war effort and promote the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Andjar {{was not involved in}} these but was <b>excited</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> artistic merits of Japanese films. Although he wrote several short stories during this time, three of which were published in the pro-Japanese newspaper Asia Raja in 1942, Andjar focused on theatre, forming the troupe Tjahaya Timoer. He often visited the Cultural Centre (Keimin Bunka Sidosho) in Jakarta, where two employees, D. Djajakusuma and Usmar Ismail, discussed filmmaking with him. Both became influential film directors during the 1950s.|$|E
5|$|Looking to do {{a family}} film, Johnny Depp visited the Walt Disney Studios in 2001 {{when he heard}} of plans to adapt the Pirates of the Caribbean ride into a film. Depp was <b>excited</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> {{possibility}} of reviving an old Hollywood genre, and found the script met his quirky sensibilities: {{the crew of the}} Black Pearl were not in search of treasure but trying to return it to lift a curse on them, and the traditional mutiny had already occurred. Depp was cast on June 10, 2002. Producer Jerry Bruckheimer felt Depp would give the film an edge that could draw teenage and adult audiences despite Disney's reputation for soft children's fare.|$|E
5|$|Ocean tides are {{converted}} to heat by frictional {{losses in the}} oceans and their interaction with the solid bottom and with the top ice crust. In late 2008, it was suggested Jupiter may keep Europa's oceans warm by generating large planetary tidal waves on Europa because of its small but non-zero obliquity. This generates so-called Rossby waves that travel quite slowly, at just a few kilometers per day, but can generate significant kinetic energy. For the current axial tilt estimate of 0.1 degree, the resonance from Rossby waves would contain 7.3 J of kinetic energy, which is two thousand times larger {{than that of the}} flow <b>excited</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> dominant tidal forces. Dissipation of this energy could be the principal heat source of Europa's ocean.|$|E

5|$|Camping for {{the night}} on a riverbank, Andrei and Foma are {{collecting}} firewood for their group when Andrei hears the distant sounds of celebration further upstream in the woods. Going to investigate he encounters {{a large group of}} naked pagans, who are conducting a torch lit ritual for Midsummer. Andrei is intrigued and <b>excited</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> behaviour of the pagans but is caught spying on a couple making love, is tied to the crossbeam of a hut in a mockery of Jesus' crucifixion and is threatened with drowning in the morning. A woman named Marfa (Nelly Snegina), dressed only in a fur coat approaches Andrei. After explaining that her people are persecuted for their beliefs she drops her coat, kisses Andrei and then unties him. Andrei runs away, and is lost in the dense woods, scratching his face. The next morning Andrei returns to his group, including Daniil, and as they leave on their boats a group of soldiers appear on the riverbank chasing after several of the pagans including Marfa. Her partner is captured but she makes her naked escape by swimming into the river past Andrei’s boat. He and his fellow monks look away in shame.|$|E
5|$|During development, id {{approached}} Sierra Entertainment, {{then one}} of the biggest companies in the industry and employer of several of their idols, with the goal of seeing if they could make a deal with the company. After viewing Commander Keen and an early version of Wolfenstein 3D, CEO Ken Williams offered to buy id Software for US$2.5 million and turn it into an in-house development studio. The team was <b>excited</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> deal, but had felt there was a large culture clash between the two companies during their visit to Sierra and were hesitant to accept; Romero proposed asking for US$100,000 in cash up front {{as part of the deal}} rather than solely accepting payment in Sierra stock as a measure of Williams's seriousness. Williams refused, which id interpreted to mean that Williams did not truly recognize the potential of Wolfenstein 3D and the company, and the deal fell through, causing id to decide to remain an independent company for the foreseeable future. By the end of 1993 just before the release of their next game, Doom, the success of Wolfenstein 3D led id to receive multiple calls every month from investment companies looking to make id a publicly-traded company, which were all turned down.|$|E
5|$|Press {{reports of}} the Amelia Island affair were wildly inaccurate, partly because of {{misinformation}} disseminated by MacGregor himself. His sudden departure, he claimed, was because he had sold the island to Aury for $50,000. Josefa gave birth to their first child in Nassau on 9 November 1817, a boy named Gregorio. The owner of the Venus was an ex-captain of the British Corps of Colonial Marines named George Woodbine. He drew MacGregor's attention to the British Legions being raised by the Latin American revolutionaries in London, and suggested that he could recruit and command such a force himself. MacGregor was <b>excited</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> idea of leading British troops again after years in command of colonials, tribesmen, and miscellaneous adventurers. He sailed for home with Josefa and Gregorio and landed in Dublin on 21 September 1818, and from there {{made his way back}} to London.|$|E

5|$|Sam Raimi {{originally}} {{envisioned the}} idea for Thor after making Darkman (1990); he met Stan Lee and pitched the concept to 20th Century Fox, {{but they did not}} understand it. Thor was abandoned until April 1997, when Marvel Studios was beginning to expand rapidly. The film gained momentum after the success of X-Men (2000). The plan was for Thor to be made for television. UPN was in talks for airing it; <b>excited</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> prospect, they pushed for a script and approached Tyler Mane to play Thor. In May 2000, Marvel Studios brought Artisan Entertainment to help finance it as a film, but by June 2004 the project still had yet to be patronised by a studio. Sony Pictures Entertainment finally purchased the film rights, and in December 2004 David S. Goyer was in negotiations to write and direct. By 2005, though there were talks between Goyer and Marvel, Goyer was no longer interested, though at this point the film was still set to be distributed through Sony Pictures.|$|E
5|$|The three member team is {{composed}} of Edward Tolby, his daughter, Silvia Tolby (of unspecified age, but vaguely described as an adolescent or young adult), and their mutual friend, Robert Penn. While {{en route to the}} valley, the team arrives in a small rural town by the name of Fairfax. Fairfax is littered with ancient, decaying gadgets; the last remnants of the era of governments and high tech society, which none of the locals know how to fix or reproduce. <b>Excited</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> strangers, the locals ask about the League. Tolby answers their questions in turn, ending with an explanation of the timeline of events which led up to the great revolt. The event is summarized as having begun with revolts in Europe which overthrow the national governments. After France exists for a month free of government, millions join the by then explicitly anarchist movement to disarm the nuclear powers. At each toppled government center, millions of records are burned and government integration robots are destroyed. These events result in the setting of the story; a world full of anachronistic high-technology, interspersed in a pre-industrialized, agrarian culture.|$|E
5|$|They added American touches to the course. They {{used the}} names of American birds for patrol names; {{challenged}} patrols {{to make their own}} flags instead of using store-bought flags; introduced patrol totems and signatures; and added singing Back to Gilwell when each patrol's name was mentioned. Each member took turns as the patrol leader, and they met daily as the Patrol Leaders Council to conduct daily inspections. The staff taught course attendees basic Scout requirements and how to handle the U.S. flag. The patrols took an unsupervised patrol hike and overnight camp. Other American features included a program and a service patrol, a cracker barrel after each evening's event, a feast, and other ceremonies. The first course, begun on July 31, 1948, was attended by 29 men from 12 states. Although it rained on four of the nine days, the Scouters were <b>excited</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> experience and enthusiastic about sharing it with others.|$|E

50|$|Rather than {{providing}} an accurate representation of reality, the game's sound effects reflect {{an attempt to}} make <b>the</b> game more <b>exciting</b> <b>by</b> exaggerating <b>the</b> impact force of punches.

25|$|Harney became {{interested}} in the international struggle for universal suffrage and helped establish the Fraternal Democrats in September 1845. It was through this organisation that Harney met Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels.

25|$|In {{much the}} same way the early modernists were {{inspired}} by naïve art, some contemporary digital art noise musicians are <b>excited</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> archaic audio technologies such as wire-recorders, the 8-track cartridge, and vinyl records.

25|$|Nonlinear {{two-dimensional}} {{infrared spectroscopy}} is the infrared version of correlation spectroscopy. Nonlinear two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy {{is a technique}} that has become available {{with the development of}} femtosecond infrared laser pulses. In this experiment, first a set of pump pulses is applied to the sample. This is followed by a waiting time during which the system is allowed to relax. The typical waiting time lasts from zero to several picoseconds, and the duration can be controlled with a resolution of tens of femtoseconds. A probe pulse is then applied, resulting in the emission of a signal from the sample. The nonlinear two-dimensional infrared spectrum is a two-dimensional correlation plot of the frequency ω1 that was <b>excited</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> initial pump pulses and the frequency ω3 <b>excited</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> probe pulse after the waiting time. This allows the observation of coupling between different vibrational modes; because of its extremely fine time resolution, {{it can be used to}} monitor molecular dynamics on a picosecond timescale. It is still a largely unexplored technique and is becoming increasingly popular for fundamental research.|$|E
