25|$|The U.S. Navy much {{preferred}} the more docile flight {{qualities of the}} F6F compared with the Vought F4U Corsair, despite the superior speed of the Corsair. This preference was especially noted during carrier landings, a critical success requirement for the Navy, in which the Corsair was fundamentally flawed in comparison. The Corsair was thus released by the Navy to the Marine Corps who, without the {{need to worry about}} carrier landings, used the Corsair to immense effect in land-based sorties. The Hellcat remained the standard USN carrier-borne fighter until the F4U series was finally cleared for U.S. carrier operations in late-1944 (the carrier landing issues had by now been tackled largely thanks to use of Corsair by the Royal Navy Fleet Air Arm). In addition to its <b>good</b> <b>flight</b> qualities, the Hellcat was easy to maintain and had an airframe tough enough to withstand the rigors of routine carrier operations. Like the Wildcat, the Hellcat was designed for ease of manufacture and ability to withstand significant damage.|$|E
2500|$|By autumn 1916, {{the arrival}} of more modern German fighters such as the Albatros D.I and Halberstadt D.II meant that even the F.E.2d was {{outperformed}} and by April 1917, it had been withdrawn from offensive patrols. [...] Despite its obsolescence in 1917, the F.E.2 was still well liked by its crews for its strength and <b>good</b> <b>flight</b> characteristics and it still occasionally proved a difficult opponent for even the best German aces. Rittmeister Baron von Richthofen was badly wounded in the head during combat with F.E.2d aircraft in June 1917– the Red Baron, like most German pilots of the period, classed the F.E.2 as a [...] "Vickers" [...] type, confusing it with the earlier Vickers F.B.5.|$|E

50|$|For {{much of the}} 1920 meeting, Pelzner led {{the small}} field with a 52 s, 452 m flight and, over 16 flights, a total {{distance}} of 2278 m. However, towards {{the close of the}} contest Wolfgang Klemperer flew the FVA-1 Schwatze Düvel, designed and built by the students' club of the University of Aachen, the FVA (Flugwissenschaftliche Vereinigung Aachen, (Flight Research Association Aachen)) on a 142 s flight over 1830 m. With two more <b>good</b> <b>flights</b> Klemperer won first prize with Pelzner second.|$|R

6000|$|Carl did not answer. He {{understood}} that the reporters were doubtful about him, the youngster from the West who had been flying for only six months. At last came the inevitable pest, the familiarly suggestive outsider. A well-dressed, well-meaning old bore he was; a complete stranger. He put his podgy hand on Carl's arm and puffed: [...] "Well, Hawk, my boy, give us a <b>good</b> <b>flight</b> to-day; not but what you're going to have trouble. There's something I want to suggest to you. If you'd use a gyroscope----" ...|$|E

50|$|During the 1930s the 19th Wing {{participated in}} maneuvers, flew patrol {{missions}}, made <b>good</b> will <b>flights</b> to Central American and South American countries, and flew mercy missions in South America.

50|$|The Luccombe area {{features}} some spectacular {{cliffs and}} scenery. It {{is a popular}} site for hang gliding and paragliding {{if there is an}} Easterly wind of around 12mph and it is low water, and on <b>good</b> days <b>flights</b> to Sandown and back can be achieved.|$|R
2500|$|The base {{is next to}} Rogers Dry Lake, an endorheic desert salt pan whose {{hard dry}} lake surface {{provides}} a natural extension to Edwards' runways.

50|$|A unique {{development}} of Prof. Mathews is the Papercopter, a model helicopter whose 'wing' is a trimmable annular ring which, using rotational aerodynamics to provide <b>good</b> forward <b>flight</b> performance without {{need for a}} tail rotor. A model helicopter 'body' is suspended beneath the ring, and uses airflow to stabilise itself {{in the direction of}} flight, much like a weather vane.|$|R
6000|$|The {{guardians of}} the tower dreaded {{for some time to}} make known his flight to Abderahman. When at length it was told to him, he exclaimed: [...] "All is the work of eternal wisdom; it is {{intended}} to teach us that we cannot benefit the wicked without injuring the <b>good.</b> The <b>flight</b> of that blind man will cause much trouble and bloodshed." ...|$|R
50|$|Despite market {{interest}} in the F 4, Fieseler had doubts as {{to the success of}} the project despite the <b>good</b> market prospects. <b>Flight</b> testing was suspended and production plans abandoned freeing the company to develop new aircraft types.|$|R

50|$|The Clark Y is {{appealing}} for its near-flat lower surface, which {{aids in the}} construction of wings on plans mounted on a flat construction board. Inexperienced modellers are more readily able to build model aircraft which provide a <b>good</b> <b>flight</b> performance with benign stalling characteristics.|$|E
50|$|After trials, the {{prototype}} was modified in July 1930. The prototype was later redesignated BM 6a/II {{after it was}} substantially modified. It offered quite <b>good</b> <b>flight</b> characteristics and was capable of aerobatic flight. It was demonstrated in a fighter-plane competition in Bucharest in 1930, along with the similar PZL P.1.|$|E

2500|$|Following {{the crash}} in 1928, a small marker was placed where the aviator's body was found. Following the {{monument}} placement in 1931, a park {{was created to}} memorialize the aviator in 1933. The park originally comprised 10 acres. However, it was absorbed into Wharton State Forrest. There is a monument sign close to the monument which states [...] "Monument - Captain Emilio Carranza fell to his death while returning to Mexico on a <b>good</b> will <b>flight</b> in 1928.

50|$|In 1926 and 1927, {{he flew to}} South America {{as part of the}} Pan American <b>Good</b> Will <b>Flight</b> a 22000 mi {{pioneering}} {{flight that}} sought to promote air postal service, U.S. commercial aviation and take messages of friendship to the governments and people of Central and South America, while forging aerial navigation routes through the Americas. The flight originated with five aircraft and crews taking off from Kelly Field, Texas on December 21, 1926, seeking to land in 23 Central and South American countries.|$|R

50|$|Launches on orbital trajectories from Brownsville {{will have}} a {{constrained}} flight path, due to the Caribbean Islands {{as well as the}} large number of Oil platforms in the Gulf of Mexico.

50|$|As noted {{there is}} a spring assist to lift the VertiBird. However, in actual {{operation}} the assist {{is not enough to}} lift the VertiBird off the ground. Most of the lift comes the spinning rotor itself. Subsequently, dropping heavy items during flight will result in a very rapid ascension of the VertiBird unless the pilot has <b>good</b> <b>flight</b> skills.|$|E
50|$|The {{meteorological}} conditions were <b>good</b> as <b>Flight</b> 365 approached Phuket International Airport. As they prepared to land, {{the flight crew}} of Flight 365 expressed concern about a Dragonair Boeing 737 that was also landing at the airport but behind and below their aircraft. A lapse in concentration by the flight crew occurred allowing the speed of Flight 365 to fall below the minimum limit. The aircraft stalled and plunged into the water before the flight crew {{was able to make}} a recovery. Everyone on board the aircraft was killed.|$|R
500|$|Although the XPTBH-2 met most of {{its design}} {{specifications}} and was rated overall very <b>good</b> in <b>flight</b> testing, it {{failed to meet the}} contractual requirements for top speed and attack speed. In addition, the U.S. Navy did not consider a seagoing torpedo-bomber to be an aircraft for which there was an operational requirement; the fact that as a floatplane the aircraft was restricted to operation from water was also considered a negative, while the aircraft's [...] "three-in-one" [...] role led it to be viewed as a jack of all trades, purpose-designed aircraft for each role being considered superior. The company, however, blamed Navy politics for the lack of a production order.|$|R
500|$|In December 1926, Whitehead was {{assigned}} as the co-pilot for Major Herbert A. Dargue, leading the [...] Pan American <b>Good</b> Will <b>Flight</b> touring South America. During a landing at Buenos Aires in March 1927, their aircraft, a Loening OA-1A float plane nicknamed New York, {{was involved in}} a mid-air collision with the Detroit, another OA-1A, forcing both Dargue and Whitehead to bail out. Whitehead suffered only a sprained ankle, but the pilot and co-pilot of the Detroit were killed. The remaining four planes of the flight completed the tour, for which all ten airmen including Whitehead received the first awards of the Distinguished Flying Cross.|$|R
