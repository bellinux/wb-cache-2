50|$|In 1922 Jones, {{during his}} study of gloss of {{photographic}} papers using goniophotometry, developed a <b>glossmeter</b> based on his research, which provided closer correlation to gloss ratings assigned by visual evaluation. Jones’ <b>glossmeter</b> used a geometric configuration of 45°/0°/45° whereby the surface was illuminated at 45° and two incident reflective angles measured and compared at 0° (diffuse reflectance) and 45° (diffuse plus specular reflectance). Jones {{was the first to}} emphasize the importance of using goniophotometric measurements in studies of gloss.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} {{maintain}} the performance and linearity of the <b>glossmeter</b> it is recommended to use a checking standard tile. This standard tile has assigned gloss unit values for each angle of measurement which are also traceable to National Standards such as BAM Federal Institute for Materials Research. The instrument is calibrated to this checking standard which is commonly referred to as a ‘calibration tile’ or ‘calibration standard’. The interval of checking this calibration is dependent on the frequency of use and the operating conditions of the <b>glossmeter.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The <b>glossmeter</b> {{provides}} a quantifiable way of measuring gloss intensity ensuring consistency of measurement by defining the precise illumination and viewing conditions. The configuration of both illumination source and observation reception angles allows measurement {{over a small}} range of the overall reflection angle. The measurement results of a <b>glossmeter</b> {{are related to the}} amount of reflected light from a black glass standard with a defined refractive index. The ratio of reflected to incident light for the specimen, compared to the ratio for the gloss standard, is recorded as gloss units (GU).|$|E
5000|$|As most commercially {{available}} <b>glossmeters</b> have gloss measurement angles of 20°, 60° and 85° haze measurement is incorporated at either 20° (ISO 13803 / ASTM E430 method B) or at 20° and 60° ( [...] ASTM D4039). There are however some manufacturers that offer <b>glossmeters</b> with measurement angles of 30° and haze measurement {{in accordance with}} ASTM E430 Method A and C but are fewer in number, therefore {{for the purposes of}} detailing haze measurement theory only the first three methods will be included.|$|R
30|$|In this article, {{laboratory}} based and handheld <b>glossmeters</b> {{as well as}} {{an optical}} profilometer were utilized for the detection of ﻿the surface properties of commercially available ﻿pharmaceutical tablets.|$|R
30|$|Both sensors (PS and TM) are the {{modified}} {{versions of the}} <b>glossmeters</b> which have been described in [26]. Here, we briefly describe the optical features. The TM sensor, as shown in Fig. 1 a, consists of a 635  nm semiconductor laser source, with adjustable power (0 – 250  mW), at normal incidence and the beam is focused to 30  μm via a focal lens. We have used 50  mW power of the laser in this work. The scattered light from the sample is directed with the beam splitter (BS) to the DOE spatial filter which passes the resulting intensity onto a single-cell photodetector. Due to the translation sample stage, the TM can be utilized to scan sample area or to perform fixed point measurements, the latter was applied in this study in a novel way regarding monitoring of a dynamic liquid layer over a rough metal surface. The sensor head and the sample stage were firmly fixed on a vibration-free table.|$|R
50|$|The <b>glossmeter</b> {{is adopted}} by many industries, from paper mills to {{automotive}} {{and is used}} at each stage of the manufacturing process from goods receipt through to final inspection.|$|E
50|$|The <b>glossmeter</b> is {{a useful}} {{instrument}} for measuring the gloss of a surface. However, it is not sensitive to other common effects which reduce appearance quality such as haze and orange peel.|$|E
50|$|Gloss level can be {{characterized}} by the angular distribution of light scattered from a surface, measured with a <b>glossmeter,</b> but there are various ways of measuring this, and different industries have different standards.|$|E
40|$|The {{first part}} of this study is devoted to {{assessing}} the suitability of soft proofs as a surrogate for the final print in judging colour-reproduction quality. Two sets of psychophysical experiments were carried out. The first investigated whether the type of medium used to generate a stimulus influenced its appearance, while the second attempted to determine whether judgments {{made on the basis of}} hardcopy simulation are transferable to prints. The second part of this study is devoted to improve the accuracy of soft proofing by increasing the amount of information rendered on screen. We present a workflow that extends traditional colorimetry beyond simple colour appearance prediction to a higher dimensional representation, which includes gloss. The intention is to provide a full goniometric simulation of the spatial distribution of light reflected by a print based upon data gathered with simple and inexpensive instruments, <b>glossmeters</b> and spectrophotometers.

40|$|Gloss is {{a feature}} of visual {{appearance}} that arises from the directionally selective reflection of light incident on a surface. Especially when a distinct reflected image is perceptible, the luminance distribution of the illumination scene above the sample can strongly influence the gloss perception. For this reason, industrial <b>glossmeters</b> do not provide a satisfactory gloss estimation of high-gloss surfaces. In this study, {{the influence of the}} conditions of illumination on specular gloss perception was examined through a magnitude estimation experiment in which 10 observers took part. A light booth with two light sources was utilized: the mirror image of only one source being visible in reflection by the observer. The luminance of both the reflected image and the adjacent sample surface could be independently varied by separate adjustment of the intensity of the two light sources. A psychophysical scaling function was derived, relating the visual gloss estimations to the measured luminance of both the reflected image and the off-specular sample background. The generalization error of the model was estimated through a validation experiment performed by 10 other observers. In result, a metric including both surface and illumination properties is provided. Based on this metric, improved gloss evaluation methods and instruments could b...|$|R
40|$|Gloss {{is one of}} {{the optical}} {{properties}} of primary concern to papermakers due to its strong impact on visual perception. In order to improve gloss of coated papers, it is necessary to better understand the relationship governing the behaviour of gloss as a function of surface texture attributes of coated paper. Since pigment represents between 80 to 95 % in weight of any coating colour, pigment characteristics, such as particle size, size distribution, and morphology, play a fundamental role in determining the coating structure. In addition, intensive calendering is often used to achieve a high sheet gloss, but can cause a significant increase in gloss variation (besides to a reduction in bulk). In this study, macro gloss, microgloss and microgloss nonuniformity of laboratory coated paper samples containing seven different delaminated and undelaminated kaolin clays with various particle size distributions were studied as a function of calendering conditions and coat weight. It was found that the average microgloss, given as average gray level, is strongly related to the macro gloss measured using the standard <b>glossmeters.</b> In addition, higher sheet average gloss corresponds to a larger gloss variability at the micro scale. It was also found that by increasing the calendering temperature from 28 to 150 oC, the average microgloss and the microgloss nonuniformity increased while the RMS surface heights decreased. For most samples, increasing the calendering temperature resulted in a decrease in surface roughness, σh. A semi-empirical model based on Alexander-Katz and Barrera’s approach of the Kirchhoff theory can be successfully used to identify key surface parameters for gloss and gloss nonuniformity. It showed that the average microgloss of the coated paper is strongly dependent on the surface texture parameter (LC/λ) /(σh/λ) 2. In addition, the microgloss variability of these coated papers also exhibited a strong linear correlation with the surface texture parameter (LC/λ) /(σh/λ) 2, but the relationship itself was found to be specific to each pigment type...|$|R

50|$|Measurement of {{specular}} reflection is performed with normal or varying incidence reflection spectrophotometers (reflectometer) using a scanning variable-wavelength light source. Lower quality measurements using a <b>glossmeter</b> quantify the glossy {{appearance of a}} surface in gloss units.|$|E
50|$|Two high gloss {{surfaces}} {{can measure}} identically {{with a standard}} <b>glossmeter</b> but can be visually very different. Instruments are available to quantify orange peel by measuring Distinctness of Image (DOI) or Reflected Image Quality (RIQ) and Haze.|$|E
40|$|Optical hazing of {{expensive}} technical porcelain tiles is principally caused by isolated {{problems in the}} industrial polishing process that often occur unexpectedly. As such, the percentage of affected packaged tiles depends on {{the time for the}} problem to be recognised and fixed. Quality control is unlikely to detect optical hazing as the viewing conditions are unsuitable. While {{only a small percentage of}} defective polished technical porcelain tiles might be packaged, they are unlikely to be detected until after they are installed. It is unrealistic to expect that whole batches of tiles can be laid out and very carefully inspected under appropriate viewing conditions before installation. Optical hazing of cheaper residential porcelain tiles can also be due to its high porosity. Nanocoatings or waxes are typically used to provide stain protection, filling any pores opened by the polishing, as well as any microcracking induced by inappropriate processing conditions 1. Where tiles are covered by a waxy coating, any optical hazing is likely to remain undetectable until after the tiles have been installed. Whole batches of polished residential porcelain tiles may be defective. Tile fixers cannot be made responsible for quality control as they will rarely install tiles under circumstances where the optical hazing will be detected. Although some manufacturers use <b>glossmeters</b> as a quality control measure, these instruments are insufficiently precise: too much light is internally refracted within the glass component of the tile surface. The only realistic option is to install appropriate artificial vision equipment at the end of the polishing train in order to detect any problem as soon as it has occurred. The University of Pisa has conducted extensive research into the optical phenomena associated with the polishing and surface modification of stones, using several different analytical techniques. This theoretical understanding has led to various prototype devices, and the granting of patents. A novel scanning reflectometer is now being commercially developed, with one production line model and another for use in the plant or laboratory. Now that we can measure optical hazing, we should be able to reach a consensus as to what is unacceptable, so that we can develop acceptance standards, and adopt quality classifications. Since the reflectometer can be used to control and optimise polishing processes and effectively correlates surface roughness and reflectance, it might also have some potential applications with respect to slip resistance assessment...|$|R
50|$|A {{period of}} one year between {{standard}} tile recalibration should be regarded as a minimum period. If a calibration standard becomes permanently scratched or damaged at any time it will require immediate recalibration or replacement as the <b>glossmeter</b> may give incorrect readings.|$|E
50|$|International {{standards}} {{state that}} it is the tile that is the calibrated and a traceable artefact not the <b>glossmeter.</b> However it is often recommended by manufacturers that the instrument also be checked to verify its operation on a frequency dependent on the operating conditions.|$|E
50|$|It {{has been}} seen that {{standard}} calibration tiles kept in optimum conditions can become contaminated and change by a few gloss units {{over a period of}} years. Standard tiles which are used in working conditions will require regular calibration or checking by the instrument manufacturer or <b>glossmeter</b> calibration specialist.|$|E
50|$|A <b>glossmeter</b> (also gloss meter) is an {{instrument}} {{which is used}} to measure specular reflection gloss of a surface. Gloss is determined by projecting a beam of light at a fixed intensity and angle onto a surface and measuring the amount of reflected light at an equal but opposite angle.|$|E
5000|$|There are {{a number}} of {{different}} geometries available for gloss measurement, each being dependent on the type of surface to be measured. For non-metals such as coatings and plastics the amount of reflected light increases with a greater angle of illumination, as some of the light penetrates the surface material and is absorbed into it or diffusely scattered from it depending on its colour. Metals have a much higher reflection and are therefore less angularly dependent. [...] Many international technical standards are available that define the method of use and specifications for different types of <b>glossmeter</b> used on various types of materials including paint, ceramics, paper, metals and plastics. Many industries use glossmeters in their quality control to measure the gloss of products to ensure consistency in their manufacturing processes. The automotive industry is a major user of the <b>glossmeter,</b> with applications extending from the factory floor to the repair shop.|$|E
50|$|For his {{research}} {{he used a}} <b>glossmeter</b> with a specular angle of 45° as {{did most of the}} first photoelectric methods of that type, later studies however by Hunter and Judd in 1939, on a larger number of painted samples, concluded that the 60 degree geometry was the best angle to use so as to provide the closest correlation to a visual observation.|$|E
50|$|A typical <b>glossmeter</b> {{consists}} of a fixed mechanical assembly comprising a standardised light source that projects a parallel beam of light onto the test surface to be measured and a filtered detector located to receive the rays reflected from the surface, Figure 1. The ASTM Method states that the illumination should be defined such that the source-detector combination is spectrally corrected to give the CIE luminous efficiency, V(?), with CIE illuminant SC.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the episode}} [...] "End with a Bang" [...] (Episode 113) of the Discovery series [...] "MythBusters" [...] that first aired on November 12, 2008, hosts Adam Savage and Jamie Hyneman {{investigated}} the truth behind everyday sayings. They used the dorodango technique to create dung spheres {{in order to}} bust the myth that one [...] "can't polish a turd". Using a <b>glossmeter,</b> they measured gloss levels substantially higher than the value of 70 gloss units which is considered [...] "high gloss". Savage's 106 gloss unit dorodango used an ostrich's feces, while Hyneman's 183 gloss unit specimen used a lion's feces. They therefore deemed the myth [...] "busted".|$|E
50|$|The {{measurement}} scale, Gloss Units (GU), of a <b>glossmeter</b> is a scaling {{based on}} a highly polished reference black glass standard with a defined refractive index having a specular reflectance of 100GU at the specified angle.This standard is used to establish an upper point calibration of 100 with the lower end point established at 0 on a perfectly matte surface. This scaling is suitable for most non-metallic coatings and materials (paints and plastics) as they generally fall within this range. For other materials, highly reflective in appearance (mirrors, plated / raw metal components), higher values can be achieved reaching 2000 Gloss Units. For transparent materials, these values can also be increased due to multiple reflections within the material. For these applications {{it is common to}} use % reflection of incident light rather than Gloss Units.|$|E
50|$|In 1937 Hunter, {{as part of}} a {{research}} project for the US National Bureau of Standards, produced a paper on the methods of determining gloss. In this paper he discussed instruments that were available at the time (including the ones mentioned previously) in relation to the classification of six different types of gloss. In this paper Hunter also detailed the general requirements for a standardised <b>glossmeter.</b> Standardisation in gloss measurement was led by Hunter and ASTM (American Society for Testing and Materials) who produced ASTM D523 Standard test method for specular gloss in 1939. This incorporated a method for measuring gloss at a specular angle of 60?. Later editions of the Standard (1951) included methods for measuring at 20? (high gloss) and 85? (matt, or low, gloss). ASTM has a number of other gloss-related standards designed for application in specific industries.In the paint industry, measurements of specular gloss are made according to International Standard ISO 2813. This standard is nominally the same as ASTM D523 although differently drafted. BS 3900, Part 5, UK; DIN 67530, Germany; NFT 30-064, France; AS 1580, Australia; JIS Z8741, Japan, are also equivalent.|$|E

30|$|The {{principle}} of {{operation of the}} <b>glossmeter</b> for scanning of a two-dimensional (2 D) gloss map from a compact has been explained previously [10]. Herein, we only give a brief description of the 2 D <b>glossmeter.</b> The light source is a semiconductor laser with a wavelength of 635  nm and an output power of 5  mW. The choice of the laser wavelength {{plays a significant role}} on both the strength of light scattering and absorption (dispersion). However, this work utilizes inexpensive red light emitting laser due to the demand of low cost sensors especially in the developing countries. Other laser types like the green and blue lasers could have also been utilized (showing different magnitude of light scattering) on our samples. The reference for calibration of the 2 D <b>glossmeter</b> is a commercial black glass gloss standard. The surface of each tablet was scanned three times in x-y direction with a resolution of 0.05  mm/pixel in both directions.|$|E
30|$|We first {{measured}} {{weight and}} {{dimensions of the}} tablets, which already indicated the presence of fakes. The measurement of average surface roughness gave more confidence that the fake tablets have poorer surface quality than the authentic tablets. Pharmaceutical tablets are rather complicated due to the porosity and presence of several excipients and the API. This fact can be exploited in optical measurement of gloss which is a convolution of surface roughness and the refractive index of the tablet. Both surface roughness and refractive index may vary spatially. In case of an authentic tablet usually the surface quality is better than with the fake tablet. This became evident by the measurement of gloss from tablets with two different glossmeters, namely a scanning <b>glossmeter</b> and a handheld model. We propose that the 2 D <b>glossmeter</b> is {{a useful tool for}} pharmacist regarding both research and practical off-line quality inspection of pharmaceutical tablets, whereas the handheld <b>glossmeter</b> can be useful for quick inspection of randomly chosen tablets from the production line, and also for screening of counterfeit tablets. The problem of counterfeit tablets is not only a problem in developing but also in developed countries.|$|E
40|$|The most {{straightforward}} way {{to assess}} the glossiness of a surface is by measuring the specular reflectance by use of a specular <b>glossmeter.</b> Although alternative measurement methods have been proposed, this {{is still the most}} frequently used instrumental measurement technique for gloss evaluation until today. However, due to both the multidimensional nature of gloss perception and to the initial purpose of a specular <b>glossmeter</b> only to judge the gloss differences of surfaces with similar appearance, specular <b>glossmeter</b> results do not seem to provide a reliable basis for estimating the gloss appearance of a surface. During the past decades, increased {{attention has been paid to}} understanding how the human visual system arrives at a particular sensation of surface gloss, and which factors influence this process. This article was established in response to these new insights, and provides the reader an overview of the most important developments and findings regarding gloss measurement and gloss perception over the past 15 years. With the ultimate goal to achieve a better correspondence between gloss measurement and gloss perception in the future, issues of alternative measurement methods are considered, and some suggestions for relevant future research are proposed. status: publishe...|$|E
30|$|Novo-Gloss Lite 45 o <b>glossmeter</b> (Rhopoint Instruments, St Leonards) with a {{resolution}} of 0.1 gloss units (GU) was used. The measurements were collected at 20 o. The average gloss value was calculated from ~ 10 random measurements, {{on both sides of}} each sheet.|$|E
30|$|It is worth﻿ {{mentioning}} {{that this is}} the first time we have utilized both glossmeters for the purpose of surface quality investigation of real pharmaceutical tablets. It is ﻿therefore suggested that the handheld <b>glossmeter</b> is a useful device for quick inspection of tablet’s surface quality both in the production environments as well as for field screening of fake tablets.|$|E
30|$|We {{tested the}} {{validity}} of the handheld <b>glossmeter</b> for the surface quality inspection of commercial pharmaceutical tablets, i.e., authentic and fake antimalarial tablets, because the portable rechargeable battery operated handheld gloss meter can serve as a tool for field testing of tablets due to its ease of operation that requires no experts as compared to the use of spectroscopic devices.|$|E
30|$|The {{inability}} to differentiate the adulterated samples with high confidence (i.e. regarding the information of the kerosene percentage in the diesel oil) during the field testing of diesel oils in Tanzania {{by using the}} hand-held refractometer, stimulated us to develop another and completely different type of a portable optical sensor for fake diesel oil screening. The prototype of a sensor that we suggest {{in this article is}} based on the idea that a roughened glass can be used for the identification of liquids, namely using the concept of refractive index matching between the roughened glass and the immersion liquid [19]. For this purpose, we have designed and tested in laboratory conditions a modified sensor head mounted on a commercial hand-held <b>glossmeter</b> [17] (MGM-Devices, Finland). The modification includes implementation of a roughened glass in the sensor head. We wish to mention that in our recent work, we have successfully used this <b>glossmeter</b> for screening fake antimalarial tablets [20].|$|E
30|$|Originally, a {{commercial}} handheld <b>glossmeter,</b> {{with a new}} innovation of a removable sensor head for liquid inspection {{is presented as a}} prototype sensor for the screening of possible adulteration of diesel oils with kerosene. The significant difference in the signal readings obtained from carefully prepared training sets of adulterated diesel oil composed of low percentages (5 – 15 %) of kerosene has proven the high sensitivity of the developed sensor.|$|E
30|$|The gloss (i.e. the {{handheld}} gloss, HHGloss) {{was measured}} from five different locations of each tablet using the handheld <b>glossmeter.</b> The data of Table  2 for HHGloss {{was obtained by}} averaging five measurements, following the scheme used in the detection of the average surface roughness, e.g., in metal industry {{with the aid of}} a handheld profilometer. The gloss readings of 2 D and handheld glossmeters are different due to different optical geometry of the glossmeters. Data of the handheld device is consistent with the data measured with the 2 D <b>glossmeter,</b> and also with the optical profilometer. This is encouraging, namely a quality inspector can make quick off-line detection (which is typical method in the factories) of the quality of a tablet (the tablet makers define decision limits for gloss). Furthermore, the various observations made in this study is quite promising since quality and control agencies can fast track and screen counterfeit and substandard pharmaceutical tablets flooding the markets of developing counties just by using this simple and inexpensive device.|$|E
