This study presents two different approaches for the demonstration of the damping effect due to wind action on cable-stayed bridge.

A beam element was adopted for modelling the cables and a plate element for modelling the bridge’s deck. The second approach {{is based on the}} selected damper system applied at the cable end to determine the reaction response at the bridge models. Two methods are presented in this report with the consideration of bridge geometric effect. The effect of pretension of the cable and the exact treatment of cable sag with the cable weight is ignored.

40|$|A helical {{flight path}} {{trajectory}} (helix) involves flying exact circles {{over the ground}} while climbing or descending at a given flight path angle and speed profile. The manoeuvre is challenging to fly in windy conditions, since the path reference is inertial whereas the aircraft naturally tends to move with the air mass. Tracking a helix introduces periodical lateral and <b>longitudinal</b> <b>wind</b> shears in turn. This makes the helix an excellent manoeuvre for testing autopilot control laws, allowing to evaluate co-ordination of longitudinal and lateral modes, tracking accuracy along a curved flight path, combined tracking of inertial (flight path) and air mass-based references (airspeed), and to evaluate the trade-off between behaviour in turbulence and wind shear. Since helical flight path trajectories are not a standard option in most autopilot / flight management systems, this chapter derives generally applicable reference variables and high-level control strategies for use with typical autopilot structures.

Aircraft step-up and spiral descent flights are used to obtain kinematic and thermodynamic data. In the step-up maneuver, six different penetrations were made between 1528 and 1616 UTC. Each penetration was about 30 km long separated in the vertical by about 300 m. The time difference between the two spiral soundings was about 43 min. The aircraft descended at a rate of 1. 5 m/s during these spiral soundings. Kinematic, cloud physical, and radiometric observations from various instruments are used to estimate the different terms in the moisture- and heat-budget equations.

This paper focuses on controlled {{time of arrival}} updates once the descent has been already initiated, assessing the feasible time window (and associated fuel consumption) of continuous descent operations requiring neither thrust nor speed-brake usage along the whole descent (i. e. only elevator control is used to achieve different metering times).

The dependence of this response {{on the size of}} the object and its distance from the specimen is described, as well as measurements which exclude electric fields, electromagnetic radiation, temperature, and humidity as avoidance-mediating signals. This response is independent of the composition and surface properties of the object and of ambient light. House Response: A house of 0. 5 - to 10 -cm diameter put over a sporangiophore elicits a transient growth response. Avoidance responses inside closed houses are slightly smaller than those in the open. Wind responses: A transverse wind elicits a tropic response into the wind, increasing with <b>wind</b> speed.

A 3 D windshear/turbulence model is developed, which covers {{a broad spectrum}} of windshear situations and can be utilized in the design of optimal and guidance trajectories. The existence of windshear patterns is justified from the analysis of simulated and real wind data. Random processes and their properties are discussed for the design of the correlation signal detectors. Numerical results demonstrate that the detection system is sensitive to the occurrence of a windshear encounter and is robust vis-a-vis noise effects. The results of this thesis make an early windshear detection possible, since computation can be performed onboard in real time. Application of the proposed detection system to the case of Flight Delta 191 leads to the conclusion that a windshear alert could have been issued 31 to 65 sec before impact, {{depending on the type of}} measurement employed in the crosscorrelation detector, specifically: 40 sec before impact for the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>wind,</b> 31 sec before impact for the vertical wind, and 65 sec before impact for the total wind.

40|$|The {{turbulence}} intensity, {{defined as}} the standard deviation of the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>wind</b> speeds divided by the mean wind velocity, {{is one of the}} important turbulent characteristics in atmospheric boundary layers. In-situ measurements of turbulence intensities above heights of 10. m are, however, limited by the availability of suitable instrumentation. The present study discusses a method to estimate turbulence intensity from the turbulent kinetic Energy Dissipation Rate (EDR) {{through the use of a}} turbulent length scale model. Provided that the EDRs can be extracted directly from raw measurements taken by remote sensing techniques, the proposed method is applicable for estimating the turbulent velocity fluctuations where only remotely sensed EDRs are available. The validity of the proposed method was evaluated in two case studies. When the measurements taken by a Doppler sodar under various weather conditions were adopted to calculate both the longitudinal turbulent velocity fluctuations and to extract the EDRs, the comparisons between the observed and estimated turbulent velocity fluctuations quantitatively show the validity of the proposed method. It has been found that the proposed method is valid when (a) there are no topographic obstacles upstream, (b) the wind speed in a typhoon boundary layer is high enough to make the selected turbulent length scale model applicable and (c) the EDR values are large enough to ignore any noise contained in the EDR data. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R

Characteristics of {{atmospheric turbulence}} are analyzed in relation to the stability or the wind speed at the height of 20 m in surface air layer.

W_ /U_ (ratio of the vertical mean wind speed to U_ at the height of 20 m) is independent of Ri. The standard deviation of the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>wind</b> speed (σ_U) is in direct proportion to the standard deviation of the lateral wind speed (σ_v). The relations between σ_U and σ_w (standard deviation of vertical wind speed) and between σ_v and σ_w are expressed with the two different equations, which have each transition point. Gustiness decreases with the increase of U_ below 8. 5 m/s (U_) and has a constant value above 8. 5 m/s. Gust factor for five minutes decreases with the increase of U_.

The coarser ash particles fell one to {{two weeks after the}} eruptions, but the finer ash particles stayed in the atmosphere from a few months up to a few years at altitudes of 10 - 30 km. <b>Longitudinal</b> <b>winds</b> spread these fine particles around the globe, creating optical phenomena. Prolonged and brilliantly coloured sunsets and twilights were frequently seen in London between 28 June and 2 July 1815 and 3 September and 7 October 1815. The glow of the twilight sky typically appeared orange or red near the horizon and purple or pink above.The estimated number of deaths varies depending on the source. Zollinger (1855) puts the number of direct deaths at 10,000, probably caused by pyroclastic flows. On Sumbawa island, 38,000 deaths were due to starvation, and another 10,000 deaths occurred due to disease and hunger on Lombok island. Petroeschevsky (1949) estimated about 48,000 and 44,000 people were killed on Sumbawa and Lombok, respectively. Several authors use Petroeschevskys figures, such as Stothers (1984), who cites 88,000 deaths in total. However, Tanguy et al.. (1998) claimed Petroeschevskys figures to be unfounded and based on untraceable references. Tanguy revised the number based on Zollinger, who spent several months on Sumbawa after the eruption, and Sir Thomas Raffless notes. Tanguy pointed out {{that there may have been}} additional victims on Bali and East Java because of famine and disease. Their estimate was 11,000 deaths from direct volcanic effects and 49,000 by post-eruption famine and epidemic diseases. Oppenheimer (2003) stated a modified number of at least 71,000 deaths in total. [...] Reid takes note of the total direct and indirect deaths caused beyond Sumbawa, in Bali and elsewhere, and suggests that a figure of perhaps 100,000 deaths is an appropriate estimate.|$|R
