5|$|In July 2017, it was {{announced}} that the 38 HC4 Chinooks would be upgraded to a HC6A standard, with the replacement of the analogue <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> systems with the Boeing Digital Automatic <b>Flight</b> <b>Control</b> System (DAFCS).|$|E
5|$|They {{were also}} able to {{determine}} all of the <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> surfaces, including the elevators, ailerons and rudder, were functioning properly {{at the point of}} the crash, and there were no faults in the <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> system. The flaps were extended to between 15° and 20°, the standard setting for take-off. The propeller blades of No. 4 engine on the far right side of the aircraftwere reversedminus 8°, while the blades of Nos. 1, 2 and 3 engines were at 34° positive pitch (also standard for take-off).|$|E
5|$|In April 1992, {{the second}} YF-22 crashed while landing at Edwards AFB. The test pilot, Tom Morgenfeld, escaped without injury. The {{cause of the}} crash {{was found to be}} a <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> {{software}} error that failed to prevent a pilot-induced oscillation.|$|E

50|$|The {{alternative}} to HIL simulation for human factors and usability development {{is to place}} prototype <b>flight</b> <b>controls</b> in early aircraft prototypes and test for usability during flight test. This approach fails when measuring the four conditions listed above.Cost: A flight test is extremely costly and therefore {{the goal is to}} minimize any development occurring with flight test.Duration: Developing <b>flight</b> <b>controls</b> with <b>flight</b> test will extend the duration of an aircraft development program. Using HIL simulation, the <b>flight</b> <b>controls</b> may be developed well before a real aircraft is available.Safety: Using flight test for the development of critical components such as <b>flight</b> <b>controls</b> has a major safety implication. Should errors be present {{in the design of the}} prototype <b>flight</b> <b>controls,</b> the result could be a crash landing.Feasibility: It may not be possible to explore certain critical timings (e.g. sequences of user actions with millisecond precision) with real users operating a plant. Likewise for problematical points in parameter space that may not be easily reachable with a real plant but must be tested against the hardware in question.|$|R

5|$|In 1979, the Swedish {{government}} began development studies for an aircraft capable of fighter, attack and reconnaissance missions {{to replace the}} Saab 35 Draken and 37 Viggen. A new design from Saab was selected and developed as the JAS 39, first flying in 1988. Following two crashes during flight development and subsequent alterations to the aircraft's <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> software, the Gripen entered service with the Swedish Air Force in 1997. Upgraded variants, featuring more advanced avionics and adaptations for longer mission times, began entering service in 2003.|$|E

5|$|The F-22 Raptor is a {{fifth-generation}} fighter that {{is considered}} fourth generation in stealth aircraft technology by the USAF. It is the first operational aircraft to combine supercruise, supermaneuverability, stealth, and sensor fusion in a single weapons platform. The Raptor has clipped delta wings with a reverse sweep on the rear, four empennage surfaces, and a retractable tricycle landing gear. <b>Flight</b> <b>control</b> surfaces include leading-edge flaps, flaperons, ailerons, rudders on the canted vertical stabilizers, and all-moving horizontal tails; these surfaces also serve as speed brakes.|$|E

Computerized <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> system and full-authority digital engine control (FADEC) make the aircraft highly departure resistant and controllable. The Raptor's relaxed stability and powerful thrust-vectoring engines enable the aircraft to turn tightly and perform very high alpha (angle of attack) maneuvers {{such as the}} Herbst maneuver (J-turn) and Pugachev's Cobra. The aircraft is also capable of maintaining over 60° alpha while having some roll control.|$|E
5|$|The US Army's next {{generation}} Chinook, the CH-47D, entered service in 1982. Improvements from the CH-47C included upgraded engines, composite rotor blades, a redesigned cockpit to reduce pilot workload, redundant and improved electrical systems, an advanced <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> system (FCS) and improved avionics. The RAF returned their original Mk1s to Boeing for upgrading to CH-47D standard, {{the first of}} which returned to the UK in 1993.|$|E
5|$|The Westland WS-61 Sea King is a British licence-built {{version of}} the American Sikorsky S-61 {{helicopter}} of the same name, built by Westland Helicopters. The aircraft differs considerably from the American version, with Rolls-Royce Gnome engines (derived from the US General Electric T58), British-made anti-submarine warfare systems and a fully computerised <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> system. The Sea King was primarily designed for performing anti-submarine warfare (ASW) missions. A Sea King variant was adapted by Westland as troop transport known as the Commando.|$|E

5|$|The first {{member of}} the A320 {{aircraft}} family was the A320, which first flew on 22 February 1987 after the program was launched in March 1984. The family was soon extended to include the stretched A321 (first delivery 1994), the shortened A319 (first delivery 1996), and the further shortened A318 (first delivery 2003).

5|$|The {{replacement}} of the Fleet Air Arm's Sea King fleet commenced faster than initially planned following {{the loss of a}} Sea King during a humanitarian aid mission in Indonesia in April 2005, resulting in nine deaths. Investigators uncovered serious faults in the condition of the Sea King's mechanical <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> system, resulting from maintenance deficiencies. In May 2007, the six remaining Sea Kings were grounded for two months following the discovery of a number of missing parts.|$|E

50|$|The <b>flight</b> <b>controls</b> of the Valiant {{consisted}} of two channels of power control with full manual backup; flying in manual was allowed but limited, being intended to be used only {{in the event of}} complete electrical failure. The <b>flight</b> <b>controls</b> reportedly required considerable effort to manually operate. All three axis of the <b>flight</b> <b>controls</b> featured a dynamic artificial feel system, the pressure for which was provided via a ram-air inlet. A Smith Aerospace autopilot and instrument landing system (ILS) functionality was installed along with various navigational aids, such as the Marconi Company-built Green Satin doppler radar, Gee radio navigation, Automatic Direction Finder (ADF), VOR/Distance Measuring Equipment (DME), and radar altimeters. Provisions for additional equipment and sensors, such as side looking airborne radar, were also made.|$|R
5|$|As intended, the Comanche {{was to be}} {{equipped}} with sophisticated avionics, including navigation and detection systems, which would have to enabled operations during nighttime and within challenging weather conditions. Its primary mission was to scout around using its advanced sensors, attempting to find and designate targets for attack helicopters, such as the AH-64 Apache, to strike. The Comanche was furnished with a digital fly-by-wire <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> system. Each of the two crew members were to be provided {{with a pair of}} LCD multi-functional displays which would have functioned in addition to the Helmet-Integrated Display and Sight System (HIDSS) worn by the crew.|$|E
5|$|Construction of the {{original}} spacecraft was completed in August 2004. Following testing, the spacecraft was shipped to the Plesetsk Cosmodrome in Russia during August 2005 and arrived on 1 September. The launch occurred from Site 133/3 on 8 October, however due to a missing command in the rocket's <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> system, the second stage engine did not shut {{down at the end}} of its planned burn, and instead the stage burned to depletion. This prevented the second stage and Briz-KM from separating, and as a result the rocket failed to achieve orbit. The spacecraft was lost when it reentered over the Arctic Ocean, north of Greenland.|$|E
5|$|In 1971 a Boeing 747, {{operating}} as Pan Am 845 struck approach light structures for the reciprocal runway as it lifted off the runway at San Francisco Airport. Major {{damage to the}} belly and landing gear resulted, which caused the loss of hydraulic fluid from three of its four <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> systems. The fluid which remained in the fourth system gave the captain very limited control {{of some of the}} spoilers, ailerons, and one inboard elevator. That was sufficient to circle the plane while fuel was dumped and then to make a hard landing. There were no fatalities, but there were some injuries.|$|E
