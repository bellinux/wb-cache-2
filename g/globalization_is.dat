5|$|The CCP {{views the}} world as {{organized}} into two opposing camps; socialist and capitalist. They insist that socialism, {{on the basis of}} historical materialism, will eventually triumph over capitalism. In recent years, when the party has been asked to explain the capitalist globalization occurring, the party has returned to the writings of Karl Marx. Despite admitting that globalization developed through the capitalist system, the party's leaders and theorist argue that <b>globalization</b> <b>is</b> not intrinsically capitalist. The reason being that if globalization was purely capitalist, it would exclude an alternative socialist form of modernity. Globalization, as with the market economy, therefore does not have one specific class character (neither socialist nor capitalist) according to the party. The insistence that <b>globalization</b> <b>is</b> not fixed in nature comes from Deng's insistence that China can pursue socialist modernization by incorporating elements of capitalism. Because of this there is considerable optimism within the CCP that despite the current capitalist dominance of globalization, globalization can be turned into a vehicle supporting socialism.|$|E
5|$|Feminist economists' work on <b>globalization</b> <b>is</b> {{diverse and}} multifaceted. But {{much of it}} is tied {{together}} through detailed and nuanced studies {{of the ways in which}} globalization affects women in particular and how these effects relate to socially just outcomes. Often country case studies are used for these data. Some feminist economists focus on policies involving the development of globalization. For example, Lourdes Benería argues that economic development in the Global South depends in large part on improved reproductive rights, gender equitable laws on ownership and inheritance, and policies that are sensitive to the proportion of women in the informal economy. Additionally, Nalia Kabeer discusses the impacts of a social clause that would enforce global labor standards through international trade agreements, drawing on fieldwork from Bangladesh. She argues that although these jobs may appear exploitative, for many workers in those areas they present opportunities and ways to avoid more exploitative situations in the informal economy.|$|E
5|$|The {{second part}} of the book {{presents}} evidence that <b>globalization</b> <b>is</b> creating a new class divide: those who are able to move to a different community to take advantage of opportunity and those who are rooted. This mobile class of people are differentiating urban areas in terms of values, culture, economic specialization, and other factors, and businesses are following the most talented people to these cities despite high land prices and labor costs. Florida also insists that a disproportionate amount of wealth is being generated in those cities which have been successful in attracting the creative class. Finally, globalization has reduced the importance of resource extraction and manufacturing in the economy and increased the importance of fields in which the creative class participate.|$|E

25|$|Economic <b>globalization</b> <b>is</b> the {{increasing}} economic interdependence of national economies {{across the world}} through a rapid increase in cross-border movement of goods, services, technology, and capital. Whereas the globalization of business is centered around the diminution of international trade regulations as well as tariffs, taxes, and other impediments that suppresses global trade, economic <b>globalization</b> <b>is</b> the process of increasing economic integration between countries, leading {{to the emergence of}} a global marketplace or a single world market. Depending on the paradigm, economic globalization can be viewed as either a positive or a negative phenomenon. Economic globalization comprises: Globalization of production; which refers to the obtention of goods and services from a particular source from different locations around the globe to benefit from difference in cost and quality.Likewise, it also comprises of globalization of markets; which is defined as the union of different and separate markets into a massive global marketplace.Economic globalization also includes competition, technology, and corporations and industries.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Globalization</b> has <b>been</b> internalized in Arabic as “awlaama:العولمة” [...] and {{refers to}} the spread {{throughout}} the globe of ideas, customs, institutions, and attitudes originated {{in one part of}} the world [...] which are usually Western in origin. For this reason it has often been perceived as largely equivalent to Westernization and is still widely regarded as an external threat rather than as an opportunity. In the Middle East the decade of <b>globalization</b> <b>was</b> marked by endless wars, intrusive US hegemony, renewed economic dependency and continuing insecurity. <b>Globalization</b> <b>was</b> ushered into the Middle East by a war which gave the Western victors excessive power over the region [...] and created a violent anti-globalization struggle. As some authors argue, it has strengthened Islamic fundamentalism [...] and, due to its ambiguity created a contradictory and tension filled situation. Globalization thus often acted as an obstacle rather than an impetus to democratization.|$|R

25|$|An {{essential}} {{aspect of}} <b>globalization</b> <b>is</b> movement of people. As transportation technology improved, travel time and costs decreased dramatically between the 18th and early 20th century. For example, travel across the Atlantic ocean {{used to take}} up to 5 weeks in the 18th century, but {{around the time of}} the 20th century it took a mere 8 days.

25|$|<b>Globalization</b> <b>is</b> often {{defined in}} terms of {{economic}} processes which bring about radical cultural developments at the level of world society. Although law is an essential ingredient of the process of globalization - and important studies of law and globalization were already conducted in the 1990s by, for example, Yves Dezalay and Bryant Garth and Volkmar Gessner - law's importance for creating and maintaining the globalization processes are often neglected within the sociology of globalization and remain, arguably, somewhat underdeveloped within the sociology of law.|$|E

25|$|Early modern <b>globalization</b> <b>is</b> {{distinguished}} from modern globalization {{on the basis}} of expansionism, the method of managing global trade, and the level of information exchange. The period is marked by such trade arrangements as the East India Company, the shift of hegemony to Western Europe, the rise of larger-scale conflicts between powerful nations such as the Thirty Years' War, and a rise of new commodities—most particularly slave trade. The Triangular Trade made it possible for Europe to take advantage of resources within the Western Hemisphere. The transfer of animal stocks, plant crops, and epidemic diseases associated with Alfred W. Crosby's concept of the Columbian Exchange also {{played a central role in}} this process. Early modern trade and communications involved a vast group including European, Muslim, Indian, Southeast Asian, and Chinese merchants, particularly in the Indian Ocean region.|$|E
500|$|Proto-{{globalization}} {{or early}} modern <b>globalization</b> <b>is</b> {{a period of}} the history of globalization roughly spanning the years between 1600 and 1800, following the period of archaic globalization.

500|$|The novel's {{language}} {{is viewed as}} rife with labeling and product placements. Postmodern theorist Fredric Jameson calls it [...] "a kind of hyped-up name-dropping ... an encyclopaedic familiarity with the fashions ... class status {{as a matter of}} knowing the score rather than of having money and power". He also calls it [...] "postmodern nominalism" [...] in that the names express the new and fashionable. This name-dropping demonstrates how commercialism has created and named new objects and experiences and renamed (or re-created) some that already existed. This naming includes nationalities; there are eight references to nationality (or locality) in the first three pages. Zeidner wrote that the novel's [...] "new century is unsettlingly transitional making it difficult to maintain an individual identity". One character argues that [...] "there will soon be no national identity left … [...] all experience [...] reduced, by the spectral hand of marketing, to price-point variations on the same thing." [...] This is juxtaposed against the footage that contains no hints of time period or location. <b>Globalization</b> <b>is</b> represented by characters of varying nationalities, ease of international travel, portable instant communication, and commercial monoculture recognizable across international markets.
