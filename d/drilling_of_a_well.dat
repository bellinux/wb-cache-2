25|$|A small {{natural gas}} {{industry}} in Central Canada {{had already been}} around for several decades, but the most significant event in the industry's early history was probably the <b>drilling</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>well</b> near Medicine Hat in 1890, in search of coal for the railway. The well encountered a large flow of natural gas, and this prompted town officials to approach the Canadian Pacific Railway {{with a view to}} drilling deeper for gas.

30|$|The {{first part}} (i.e., the {{drilling}} cost) is the expenses incurred {{related to the}} <b>drilling</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> horizontal <b>well</b> {{and the second part}} is the expenses related to the steps taken to prepare <b>a</b> <b>well</b> for production. This aspect consists primarily of stimulation activities such as hydraulic fracturing and re-fracturing along with casing and cementing costs. Average D&C cost of 5 million dollars are assumed for a typical shale gas well ($ 0.5 million per 1000  ft).|$|R
5000|$|British Malayan Petroleum Company Ltd.

As a follow-up to Jerudong No. 2 which discovered oil in 1955, Jerudong No 3 had been spudded in mid-September west of the Jerudong No. 2 site. Jerudong No. 4 depth was 6,070 feet; Jerudong No. 5 reached 8,210 feet; Jerudong No. 6 went to 6,580. Altogether about 28,900 feet were drilled, but very little additional oil was found.|$|E
5000|$|In 1844 Charles Sturt's {{expedition}} was stranded for {{six months}} at nearby Preservation Creek, owing {{to a lack of}} supplies. Gold was discovered in the 1870s and a rush commenced in 1880. The mostly male population peaked at 3,000, with W.H.J. Slee being appointed the resident Goldfields Warden in January 1881. Cobb and Co coaches ran three times a week from Milparinka to Wilcannia, and by August 1881 the official gold escort had carried about 10,000 ounces of gold from the field, not to mention that which went privately. [...] In this arid region, water was so scarce that miners got their gold by dry blowing. Water was selling for one shilling per bucket and dysentery was rife, until in September 1881, on the recommendation of W.H.J. Slee, the New South Wales government authorised the <b>drilling</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>well.</b> In December 1881 the government well struck water at 140 feet, which caused great relief to all.|$|E
50|$|Exploration in {{the area}} began in 1970, and in 1976 gas was {{discovered}} in the Sampaguita structure following the <b>drilling</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>well.</b> In total, three wells have been drilled to date, all located at the south west end of the Sampaguita structure.The initial 2-year concession by the Philippines' Government to extract the resources, (SC72, formerly GSEC101,) was awarded to Sterling Energy PLC in June 2002. In April 2005, Forum Energy PLC (FEP) acquired the concession from Sterling and became its operator. Forum Energy PLC (FEP) is a London-based listed {{oil and gas exploration}} firm focused on the Philippines; it is 64.45% owned by Philex Petroleum Corporation. In February 2010, the licence was converted to a Service Contract, and FEP performed geological and geophysical works and seismic surveys. In July 2011 the Philippines' Department of Energy (DOE) approved the commencement of a 2-year phase of the project leading to the drilling of 2 wells, and preparations commenced. However, the PRC Government had also granted exploration rights to the area to the PRC State-owned China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC). The PRC objected to the Philippine arrangement. The requisite approvals from the Philippine DOE to commence drilling were not issued, and the project was placed on hold.|$|E
40|$|The Mindanao Geothermal Production Field (MGPF) is on {{its fifth}} year of {{commercial}} operation this March 2002. Steam supply is sustained by production in M 1 power plant (M 1 GP) and M 2 power plant (M 2 GP) despite effects of injection returns and calcite deposition. The Total mass extracted is 7. 5 E 10 kgs, with steam delivered to M 1 GP at 1. 3 E 10 kgs, and 6 E 9 kgs to M 2 GP. Injection returns from Matingao were detected on 1998 affecting the Marbel wells. At the onset of M 2 GP production at Sandawa in 1999, massflows have increased caused by hot recharge. Present temperature and geochemical trends imply recovery from injected fluids in Marbel and deep hot recharge from Sandawa. <b>Drilling</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> injection <b>well</b> targeted at Sudsuwayan, north of Kullay injection sink will provide operational flexibility, mitigating thermal decay caused by massfront at the northwest of Marbel production wells. On the other hand, the recharge at Sandawa resulted to excess brine disposal due to limited acceptance of the sole injection well KN- 1 RD.

50|$|An {{accurate}} {{evaluation of}} a casing cement job {{as well as of}} the formation is extremely important during the <b>drilling</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>well</b> and for subsequent work. The Information resulting from Formation Integrity Tests (FIT) is used throughout the life of the well and also for nearby wells. Casing depths, well control options, formation fracture pressures and limiting fluid weights may be based on this information. To determine the strength and integrity of a formation, a Leak Off Test (LOT) or a Formation Integrity Test (FIT) may be performed. This test is first: a method of checking the cement seal between casing and the formation, and second: determining the pressure and/or fluid weight the test zone below the casing can sustain. Whichever test is performed, some general points should be observed. The fluid in the well should be circulated clean to ensure it is of a known and consistent density. If mud is used for the test, it should be properly conditioned and gel strengths minimized. The pump used should be a high-pressure, low-volume test or cementing pump. Rig pumps can be used if the rig has electric drives on the mud pumps, and they can be slowly rolled over. If the rig pump must be used and the pump cannot be easily controlled at low rates, then the leak-off technique must be modified. It is a good idea to make a graph of the pressure versus time or volume for all leak-off tests.|$|E

The beginning of a changing era was the year 1879 when James Campbell sponsored the <b>drilling</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>well</b> that struck artesian water on Oahu.

Groundwater provides 99 + % of the drinking water for Honolulu with its present population of 838, 000 and 90 % of all water uses including irrigated agriculture.

40|$|Master's thesis in Petroleum engineeringExcessive {{drill string}} {{torque and drag}} {{is one of the}} major {{limitations}} of extended-reach and horizontal drilling. The torque and drag models are used in the planning phase and during the <b>drilling</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>well,</b> as a tool used for monitoring developing hole problems. The models used throughout the industry today are mostly based on equations presented more than two decades ago, little work have been done to improve upon these. The thesis gives a general overview of the various challenges of using such models. It is shown the importance of correcting for friction in the draw works sheaves to get realistic friction factors. A recently published model is used and work has been done to improve this model further. The model has some inaccuracies in the lower part of the string and a new model for drag in the lowest part is proposed. Further is a new criterion presented, for determining whether an element is straight or curved. This new criterion account for radial clearance between drill string and bore hole wall...|$|E
