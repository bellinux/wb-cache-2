All the evidence points to Clark having been hit by Lex's car, but Lex refuses to believe that <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> so Nixon attempts to expose Clark to everyone. Around the same time, Lex also enlists the help of Dr. Hamilton (Joe Morton); Hamilton is commissioned to study the effects of the meteor rocks. Hamilton finds an octagonal disc, with unknown symbols imprinted on the disc's surface that match those on Clark's ship, while searching for traces of an alien ship that landed in Smallville in 1989. The disc is eventually stolen by Nixon in an attempt to open Clark's ship.|$|E

25|$|After the War of the Duchies, Germany {{experienced}} {{a short period}} of peace. The Gastein Convention, signed by the two winners on 14 August 1865, placed the former Danish provinces under Prussian-Austrian control and both countries occupied a part of the Duchies. However, differences of opinion concerning the administration of the provinces quickly triggered a conflict between the former allies. On 9 June 1866, Prussia occupied Holstein, which was administered by Austria. In the meanwhile, Vienna asked the Diet of Frankfurt for a general mobilisation of the German states against Prussia, which <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> on 14 June.|$|E
25|$|Among the 5 million, 771,844 were {{military}} casualties {{killed in}} action and other causes. The military only covers 15% of the total casualties.

Ottoman statistics analyzed by Turkish Kamer Kasim (Manchester University, Ph.D.), claims that cumulative percentage was 26.9% (higher than 25% reported by western sources) of the population, which this size stands out among the countries that took part in World War I. To understand the size of the issue, Kamer Kasım's %1.9 increase on the totals adds 399,000 civilians to the total number, which has not been reported in western sources.|$|E

25|$|Over {{the next}} four years, Mussolini {{eliminated}} nearly all checks and balances on his power. In 1926, Mussolini passed a law that declared he was responsible only to the King and made him the sole person able to determine Parliament's agenda. Local autonomy was swept away and appointed podestas replaced communal mayors and councils. Soon after all other parties were banned in 1928, parliamentary elections were replaced by plebiscites in which the Grand Council nominated a single list of candidates. Mussolini wielding enormous political powers as the effective ruler of Italy. The King was a figurehead and handled ceremonial roles, though he retained the power to dismiss the Prime Minister {{on the advice of}} the Grand Council—which <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> in 1943.|$|E
25|$|The {{owners and}} agents of Ariel and Taeping {{were well aware}} of the {{situation}} that the consignees were in. As soon as their ships had telegraphed from the Downs they became concerned that anything that might be considered a dead heat or a disputed result might lead the consignees to call the race void - there being no outright winner - and so not pay the premium for the first ship to dock. Therefore, they agreed that whichever ship docked first would claim and the other would not dispute the result in any way. In return, the two ships shared the premium between them, and also MacKinnon and Keay shared the £100 prize for the winning ship's captain. This <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened,</b> Taeping made the claim and shared the money equally with Ariel.|$|E
25|$|It was {{initially}} decided that Arthur {{would not go}} to prison for stealing the Christmas club money, until a legal advisor to the programme suggested that EastEnders would not be portraying a likely outcome. In reality he would probably get twenty-eight days in prison, so that others could be taught a lesson, and so that <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> on-screen. The episode where Arthur was sent to prison was written by Bill Lyons, and dominated by Arthur's trial. A special court set had to be hired, {{but it was too}} large to fit into the regular EastEnders studio at Elstree, and needed an extra studio. The episode cut {{back and forth between the}} trial and the regular goings-on in the Square before climaxing with the shock decision of the judge, who told Arthur that, as he had betrayed people's trust he must be seen to be punished, and she sentenced him to twenty-eight days.|$|E

500|$|In Cobb's view, the {{transfer}} of personnel to the yawl may have been intended as a temporary safety measure. He speculated from Deveau's report {{on the state of}} the rigging and ropes that the ship's main halliard may have been used to attach the yawl to the ship, enabling the company to return on board when the danger had passed. If, however, the line had subsequently parted, Mary Celeste would have sailed away empty leaving the yawl to founder with its occupants. Begg notes the illogicality of attaching the yawl to a vessel that the crew thought was about to explode or sink, while the modern writer Macdonald Hastings asks whether Briggs, an experienced captain, would have effected a panicky abandonment of the ship when, [...] "If the Mary Celeste had blown her timbers, she would still have been a better bet for survival than the ship's boat." [...] If this <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened,</b> says Hastings, Briggs [...] "...behaved like a fool; worse, a frightened one." ...|$|E
500|$|Sarmiento {{was well}} known for his {{modernization}} of the country, and for his improvements to the educational system. He firmly believed in democracy and European liberalism, but was most often seen as a romantic. Sarmiento was well versed in Western philosophy including the works of Karl Marx and John Stuart Mill. He was particularly fascinated with the liberty given to those living in the United States, which he witnessed {{as a representative of}} the Peruvian government. He did, however, see pitfalls to liberty, pointing for example to the aftermath of the French Revolution, which he compared to Argentina's own May Revolution. He believed that liberty could turn into anarchy and thus civil war, which <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> in France and in Argentina. Therefore, his use of the term [...] "liberty" [...] was more in reference to a laissez-faire approach to the economy, and religious liberty. Though a Catholic himself, he began to adopt the ideas of separation of church and state modeled after the US. He believed that there should be more religious freedom, and less religious affiliation in schools. This was one of many ways in which Sarmiento tried to connect South America to North America.|$|E
500|$|David Renwick {{made the}} {{decision}} to revive Jonathan Creek for a Christmas special as a means of [...] "deferring retirement". He considered the alternative of developing an entirely new series to be too lengthy a process, and regarded reviving Jonathan Creek as the [...] "safe decision". He described the process of formulating a plot for the episode as an [...] "agony" [...] and a [...] "torment", revealing that he had stopped writing the show in 2004 partly {{due to a lack of}} ideas. Renwick explained: [...] "Inevitably, you set up a series which is all about impossibilities that then have to have a rational explanation, by definition it’s going to be pretty challenging stuff for a writer. So God knows why I ever embarked on it in the first place." [...] As well as writing, Renwick also directed the episode, which was produced by Nerys Evans; Jonathan Creeks former Producer Verity Lambert died of cancer in November 2007. Davies noted that he and Renwick met quite regularly following Lambert's death, and when Renwick suggested to the BBC that they revive Jonathan Creek, the broadcaster [...] "bit his hand off for it". [...] "The Grinning Man" [...] was commissioned by Jane Tranter, Controller of BBC Fiction, with Lucy Lumsden, Controller of Comedy Commissioning, stating that the station was [...] "delighted to have Jonathan Creek back on BBC One". Renwick was prepared for a negative reaction to the show's revival, describing how: [...] "People say, Oh Jonathan Creeks coming back. Fantastic.'

500|$|According to Nancy Keefe Rhodes of Stone Canoe, a U.S. {{literary}} journal, the film's {{audiences are}} likely to have the preconception that human trafficking is not slavery in the same sense that the Atlantic slave trade was, and many people believe that slavery was abolished a long time ago with such instruments as the U.S. Emancipation Proclamation and Thirteenth Amendment. Rhodes writes that society now uses the word [...] "slavery" [...] in modern contexts only as a metaphor, so that references to actual contemporary slavery can be dismissed as hyperbole, and she describes the film's goal as to [...] "reclaim the original term [...] and convince us that what is happening now <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> then: highly organized and pervasive, intentional, highly profitable and... fully as coercive and wantonly cruel." [...] Rhodes says that the word [...] "slavery" [...] has started to be used in its original sense again in recent years, but that audiences' views on contemporary slavery are nonetheless influenced by the slave-like imagery in such films as Hustle & Flow (2005) and Black Snake Moan (2007). The Academy Award-winning Hustle & Flow portrays a pimp as the hero, while Black Snake Moan features Christina Ricci as a young nymphomaniac; the marketing for Black Snake Moan centered on evocative, sexualized slave imagery, including a scantily-clad Ricci in chains. According to Rhodes, Bilheimer [...] "rescue modern slaves from representation as exotic creatures, to restore their humanity" [...] and allow audiences to relate to them. For this purpose, Bilheimer tells stories of individuals {{in the context of their}} communities and families. While Bilheimer had previously done extensive social justice work with religious organizations, he did not proselytize in the film, despite the many opportunities the film afforded him to do so.|$|E
500|$|As {{indicated}} by the title, air, skies and wings are important themes: Yukito is searching for the [...] "girl in the sky", and Misuzu believes that her other self is flying in the sky above her. Other characters show a similar relationship to the sky, such as Minagi {{who is a member}} of the astronomy club,Translated quote: [...] "...There's still club activities...the astronomy club." [...] and Michiru who has a fondness for bubbles that float in the air. Kano wants wings to fly, and Kanna already has them. Misuzu names a crow she finds —Japanese for [...] "sky". Another major theme is the maternal bond, as the four heroines' stories, as well as Yukito's, revolve around their mothers, either biological or adoptive. Main scenario writer Jun Maeda commented that he prefers to include mothers in games if given the choice between only including a mother or a father, as <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> with Air, though he backs this up by noting that in bishōjo games, women are the main focus anyway. Complicated relationships involving family members and friends play a key part throughout the story. One of the sub-themes in the story is magic.Translated quote: [...] "If you could use sorcery, what do you think would happen?" [...] Uraha, Yukito's mother,Translated quote: [...] "I had inherited the ability to control puppets without touching them from my mother." [...] and Yukito himselfTranslated quote: A power that can move a puppet without touching it. To me, it's a power that's nothing out of the ordinary. But if I had to explain it to this girl using terminology she knew.....it's a kind of magic." [...] have the ability to use magic, though Yukito is the least skilled among them.

500|$|At the burnings of Isabella Condon in 1779 and Phoebe Harris in 1786, the sheriffs present {{inflated}} their expenses; in {{the opinion}} of Simon Devereaux they were probably dismayed at being forced to attend such spectacles. [...] Harris's fate prompted William Wilberforce to sponsor a bill which if passed would have abolished the practice, but as one of its proposals would have allowed the anatomical dissection of criminals other than murderers, the House of Lords rejected it. [...] The burning in 1789 of Catherine Murphy, a counterfeiter, was impugned in Parliament by Sir Benjamin Hammett. [...] He called it one of [...] "the savage remains of Norman policy" [...] and amidst a growing tide of public disgust at the burning of women, Parliament passed the Treason Act 1790, which for women guilty of treason substituted hanging for burning. [...] It was followed by the Treason Act 1814, introduced by Samuel Romilly, a legal reformer. [...] Influenced by his friend, Jeremy Bentham, Romilly had long argued that punitive laws should serve to reform criminal behaviour and that far from acting as a deterrent, the severity of England's laws was responsible for an increase in crime. [...] When appointed the MP for Queensborough in 1806 he resolved to improve what he described as [...] "Our sanguinary and barbarous penal code, written in blood". He managed to repeal the death penalty for certain thefts and vagrancy, and in 1814 proposed to change the sentence for men guilty of treason to being hanged until dead and the body left at the king's disposal. [...] However, when it was pointed out {{that this would be a}} less severe punishment than that given for murder, he agreed that the corpse should also be decollated, [...] "as a fit punishment and appropriate stigma." [...] This <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> to Jeremiah Brandreth, leader of a 100-strong contingent of men in the Pentrich rising and one of three men executed in 1817 at Derby Gaol. [...] As with Edward Despard and his confederates the three were drawn to the scaffold on sledges before being hanged for about an hour, and then on the insistence of the Prince Regent were beheaded with an axe. [...] The local miner appointed to the task of beheading them was inexperienced though, and having failed with the first two blows, completed his job with a knife. [...] As he held the first head up and made the customary announcement, the crowd reacted with horror and fled. [...] A different reaction was seen in 1820, when amidst more social unrest five men involved in the Cato Street Conspiracy were hanged and beheaded at Newgate Prison. [...] Although the beheading was performed by a surgeon, following the usual proclamation the crowd was angry enough to force the executioners to find safety behind the prison walls. [...] The plot was the last [...] crime for which the sentence was applied.|$|E
