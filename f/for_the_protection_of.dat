5|$|Given {{the history}} of Nazism's rise to power in Germany in the 1930s, the present German state has {{committed}} itself to taking active steps to prevent the rise of any ideology that threatens the values enshrined in the German constitution. The BfV domestic intelligence service (Bundesamt für Verfassungsschutz, or Federal Office <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Protection</b> <b>of</b> the Constitution) regards the aims of Scientology as running counter to Germany's free and democratic order, and has been monitoring Scientology since 1997, as have the Offices <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Protection</b> <b>of</b> the Constitution {{in a number of}} German Länder. Minister for Family Policy Claudia Nolte instituted the surveillance, saying that the church had totalitarian tendencies and that she would oppose Scientology with all the means at her disposal.|$|E
