In the {{aftermath}} of Enron, he co-sponsored (with Barbara Boxer) legislation, which was later propounded by Ted Kennedy, that reforms the 401(k) plan {{to minimize the risk}} of investment portfolios. The plan was opposed by President George W. Bush and faced strong opposition in Congress. Restrictions on retirement account allocations were in direct opposition to the contemporaneous movement towards self-directed individual retirement accounts <b>for</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Security.</b>|$|E
5|$|In February 2010, President Obama {{formed the}} {{bipartisan}} BowlesSimpson Commission to recommend steps {{that could be}} taken to reduce future budget deficits. The commission released its report on November 10, 2010, which recommended deep domestic and military spending cuts, reforming the tax system by eliminating many tax breaks in return for lower overall rates, and reducing benefits <b>for</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> and Medicare.

5|$|U.S. {{taxation}} {{is generally}} progressive, especially the federal income taxes, and {{is among the}} most progressive in the developed world. The highest 10% of income earners pay a majority of federal taxes, and about half of all taxes. Payroll taxes <b>for</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> are a flat regressive tax, with no tax charged on income above $118,500 (for 2015 and 2016) and no tax at all paid on unearned income from things such as stocks and capital gains. The historic reasoning for the regressive nature of the payroll tax is that entitlement programs have not been viewed as welfare transfers. However, according to the Congressional Budget Office the net effect of Social Security is that the benefit to tax ratio ranges from roughly 70% for the top earnings quintile to about 170% for the lowest earning quintile, making the system progressive.|$|E

5|$|Tierney first ran for Congress in 1994 against one-term Republican {{incumbent}} Peter G. Torkildsen, {{having won}} a competitive Democratic primary with {{a plurality of}} 33.8 percent. He ran on a platform promoting a stronger federal focus on drug abuse, federal aid to promote after-school programs, consideration of means testing <b>for</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Security,</b> and single-payer health care. A primary issue in the campaign was crime: Tierney criticized Torkildsen for his vote against a 1994 crime bill, and advocated stronger gun control, while Torkildsen criticized Tierney's positions on gun control and drug legalization. Tierney was defeated {{in the general election}} by 4%. Tierney successfully ran for Congress in 1996, defeating Torkildsen by a narrow margin and increasing his margin in a 1998 rematch. Over the next five elections, Tierney won with over 68% of the vote. In 2010, he faced a stronger challenge from Republican candidate Bill Hudak, after his wife Patrice was convicted of felony tax fraud; he won with 57% of the vote.|$|E
