5000|$|Thru axle - a {{removable}} axle with a threaded end that is inserted {{through a hole}} in one <b>fork</b> <b>leg,</b> through the hub, and then screwed into the other <b>fork</b> <b>leg.</b> Some axles have integrated cam levers that compress axle elements against the <b>fork</b> <b>leg</b> to lock it in place, while others rely on pinch bolts on the <b>fork</b> <b>leg</b> to secure it. Diameters for front thru axles include 20 mm, 15 mm (most common), and 9 mm. Rear axles typically have diameters of 10 or 12 mm. Most thru axles are found on mountain bikes, although some cyclocross and road bikes are using them. Thru axles repeatable locate the wheel in the fork or frame, which is important to prevent misalignment of brake rotors when using disc brakes. Unlike other axle systems (except Lefty), the thru axle is specific to the fork or frame, not the hub. Hubs/wheels do not include axles, and the axle is generally supplied with the fork or frame.|$|E
50|$|Early {{disc brake}} {{calipers}} {{were located in}} front of the <b>fork</b> <b>leg</b> on top of the disc. This position placed the caliper in an area of high air flow for better heat removal. Calipers on most modern motorcycles are mounted {{to the rear of the}} <b>fork</b> <b>leg.</b> This has the advantage of reducing the angular momentum of the fork assembly and improving low speed handling. Radial mounted calipers.|$|E
50|$|TRAC (Torque Reactive Anti-dive Control): This {{was fitted}} {{to a number}} of Honda {{motorcycles}} such as the CB1100F, CB1000C, and VFR750F and worked by utilizing a pivoting caliper that activated a valve in the <b>fork</b> <b>leg.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The two upper {{members of}} a {{suspension}} bicycle fork that connect to the crown (also called <b>fork</b> <b>legs).</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{amount of}} preload on coil-sprung forks can {{generally}} be adjusted by turning a knob {{on top of}} one of the <b>fork</b> <b>legs.</b> Air sprung designs have various ways of dealing with preload. Several systems have been designed to influence preload, such as separately pressurizing different chambers, or systems that automatically set sag after changing the air pressure.|$|R
5000|$|Cannondale {{has also}} {{developed}} a suspension fork called the Lefty. It started with the [...] "Headshok" [...] (a.k.a. [...] "Fatty") forks. It uses 88 needle bearings to reduce friction for smooth travel with the bearings telescoping inside the steerer tube of the fork. This minimizes flexing of the <b>fork</b> <b>legs</b> and also reduces static friction, which must be overcome before the fork begins to travel.|$|R
50|$|To measure road-race courses, {{the counter}} is fitted to a bicycle between the left <b>fork</b> <b>leg</b> {{and the front}} wheel. The tab or tabs on the large ring gear engage with the spokes, thus {{providing}} drive to a Veeder-Root counter.|$|E
5000|$|... 1976 models had {{the front}} brake caliper {{moved to the}} right <b>fork</b> <b>leg,</b> behind the fork as opposed to {{in front of the}} fork. This placed the brake caliper nearer the {{steering}} pivot center-line, requiring slightly less effort to steer.|$|E
5000|$|The rear {{suspension}} (air shock with adjustable damping control) and frame (square-section steel tube type) were direct carryovers from the [...] "F" [...] model, but the front suspension featured Honda's anti-dive system named [...] "TRAC" [...] which stood for [...] "Torque Reactive Anti-dive Control". This system utilized the left brake hangar being {{pinned to the}} fork on the bottom mount and allowed to pivot in an anti-clockwise direction, thereby closing a valve in the left <b>fork</b> <b>leg,</b> forcing the damping fluid through a smaller passageway, and increasing the damping rate under hard braking. The left <b>fork</b> <b>leg</b> had a screw-type adjuster with four positions of adjustment which would change the amount of influence this system had under braking. The fork also featured a Schrader-type air valve which allowed air assistance from 0-6 psi to increase the spring rate in the fork. The right <b>fork</b> <b>leg</b> featured a 3 position hand adjustable dial which would increase damping rates. The fork also featured quick-release, swing-away axle clamps for faster tire changes in endurance racing. Many of these features were seen as very exotic for the time, and modern adjustable sportbike suspension can trace design roots to these features.|$|E
5000|$|Tachometer mounted red {{warning light}} that {{activates}} at the equivalent of 55mph. Hand-produced lightweight aluminium frame, fuel tank contents gauge activated by a rhs mounted function switch (uses water temp gauge to show fuel tank contents available), front suspension pre-load adjustable from dial on top of <b>forks</b> <b>legs.</b> Self cancelling indicators deleted. Production run limited to 1600 units only (all sold {{in the first week}} of release allegedly) ...|$|R
5000|$|Created and {{manufactured}} one of BMX's {{most popular and}} famous bicycle components: the Bottema Bullet Fork. It was a tubular unicrown fork manufactured by his company {{that was the most}} popular and respected component of its type since Redline Engineering came out with the very first unicrown tube fork for BMX bicycles in 1974. The original M-1 Bullet Fork had extra thick chromoly tubing at [...]065" [...] and extra long <b>fork</b> <b>legs</b> than other tubular forks of that period to reduce flex while the weight was still competitive with the lighter forks on the market. They are also of the [...] "straight design, [...]i.e the <b>fork</b> <b>legs</b> are parallel with the head tube as opposed to the legs being angled forward slightly giving the bicycle a longer wheelbase. To compensate the Bottema M-1 fork had a one inch axle lead. These first models were particularly popular with BMX freestyle skatepark bowl riders like Jeff Watson and Eddie Fiola for their extra durability. Bottema had also came out in 1979 with C-1 cruiser models for 26" [...] cruiser racing bicycles. In early 1981 he came out with the M-2 racing model with thinner tubing with the axle line further down the tube legs.|$|R
50|$|A damper {{is usually}} {{implemented}} by forcing oil {{to pass through}} one or more small orifices (also called ports) or shim stacks. On some models the damper may be adjusted for rider weight, riding style, terrain, or any combination of these or other factors. The two components are often separated by housing the spring mechanism {{in one of the}} <b>fork's</b> <b>legs</b> and the damper in the other. Without a damper unit the system would rebound excessively and would actually give the rider less control than would a rigid fork.|$|R
50|$|Both {{the wheel}} and the other <b>fork</b> <b>leg</b> were capable of {{accepting}} another disc and caliper and a switch to a twin-disc front brake (like the GT750) was not an uncommon modification some owners made (although the larger master cylinder from the 750 was required). The single disc arrangement continued {{throughout the rest of}} the GT550's production.|$|E
50|$|It has a 4-2-4 exhaust system. The Z1000 uses a {{backbone}} frame {{that supports the}} engine as a stressed member. Engine mounts can be removed to ease access for maintenance. Compression damping is done on one <b>fork</b> <b>leg,</b> rebound damping on the other. This technology is from dirt bikes, and is rare on street motorcycles. The Nissin brakes have four piston calipers.|$|E
50|$|The {{front brake}} caliper was resited {{to the rear}} of the <b>fork</b> <b>leg</b> and the front master {{cylinder}} reservoir shape was changed. A hazard switch was added. Needle roller bearings were fitted to the swingarm instead of the earlier plain bushings. Tuning modifications were made to the carbs to improve low speed operation. The manual operation fuel tap was replaced with an automatic diaphragm unit. A rear disc brake replaced the earlier drum.|$|E
50|$|The Nighthawk 700S {{bodywork}} (1984 - 1985) {{was mostly}} black in color - with either red or blue accent panels. In 1986, the 700SC's paint was mostly navy blue (with white accent decals with red pinstripes) or black (with red accent decals and tri-color pinstripes). Valve cover and clutch covers were painted black {{as well as}} the wheels. The engine was painted black with polished edges on the cylinder head fins. Other components were also enameled in black including the lower <b>fork</b> <b>legs,</b> handlebars, and rear grab rails.|$|R
50|$|In {{mountain}} biking the term 'suspension hub' {{was used in}} the 90s to describe hubs with oversized axle ends and a thicker axles than were customary at the time. These hubs were designed to stiffen up suspension forks, which were still somewhat of a novelty, by rigidly holding the <b>fork</b> <b>legs</b> in position relative to each other once the wheel was fitted, improving steering response in the fork. This term is no longer used as this function is no longer an exceptional requirement for mountain bike front hubs, so all current mountain bike hubs are suspension hubs.|$|R
50|$|Some of Cheney's {{motorcycle}} {{designs are}} now famous {{in their own}} right, such as the competition BSA Gold Stars of Jerry Scott and Keith Hickman and the John Banks replica which used a BSA B50 engine specially tuned by Cheney. He also built some racing frames for Suzuki Grand Prix motorcycles in 1968 and, {{it has been suggested}} that Suzuki engineers incorporated features of Cheney's designs, such as magnesium hubs and lower <b>fork</b> <b>legs</b> into production road going motorcycles. Cheney's company was originally known as Eric Cheney Designs, then changed to Inter-Moto, now known as Cheney Racing.|$|R
5000|$|The {{machine was}} {{noted for its}} use of inboard {{ventilated}} disc brakes, the discs themselves being contained within a [...] "drum" [...] type enclosure. Front suspension was by oil-damped telescopic fork with air assistance and incorporating an anti-dive mechanism in the left <b>fork</b> <b>leg.</b> Rear suspension was by Honda's own [...] "Pro-Link" [...] rising rate system, which allows the suspension forces to vary in accordance with rear wheel movement. The machine was equipped with transistorised ignition and electrics were 12 volt.|$|E
50|$|The {{front forks}} are {{slightly}} different {{between the two}} models. Both models feature air assistance,but the B1 model uses an air valve located {{at the top of}} the <b>fork</b> <b>leg</b> while the B2 uses an equalisertube linking the two tube with a single air valve. By using an equaliser tube, each inner fork tube requires a small hole to allow the air in. The lower legs are different as the different brake disk diameter used on the two models require the mounting points to be different.|$|E
50|$|The {{suspension}} {{has greater}} vertical travel and more adjustability than the suspension on the Versys 650 siblings.. On the front thicker/stiffer 41 mm inverted front forks are externally adjustable for preload and rebound damping. The right <b>fork</b> <b>leg</b> carries a damping cartridge while both legs contain springs. The {{rear shock absorber}} is adjustable for rebound damping. Suspension preload is adjustable in the rear via a screw collar on the shock. 2015+ models have an external adjuster. The rear shock/spring is directly connected, without linkages, to a non symmetrical, gull wing, aluminum swing arm instead of the more basic steel swing arm used on the Ninja and ER-6.|$|E
50|$|The Lignel 20 had {{retractable}} {{landing gear}} with mainwheeels on <b>forked</b> cantilever <b>legs</b> from the outer edges of the centre section, swinging outwards into wing recesses. There were covers attached to the inner side of the forks, acting as aircraft fairings when retraction was complete.|$|R
5000|$|Minor {{revision}} with fairing redesign {{along with}} 2-position flip up screen, exhaust redesign, stronger <b>fork</b> <b>legs</b> (up to 41mm from 37mm) but retaining anti-dive {{on the left}} leg, a more reliable ignition system and 17 inch wheels front and rear. Larger engine valves for improved midrange. A clock and fuel gauge were added and the pillion footrest mounts were changed from {{being part of the}} rear subframe to bolt on cast aluminium assemblies.New fairing side-panels allowed easier access to the engine, and the fairing cutaways for the rider's feet were much reduced in area. The change in wheel size allowed both a greater range of tyre options and a claimed improvement in handling. (This model was not imported into the USA.) ...|$|R
60|$|I {{achieved}} a cat-like celerity. In another second I {{was back in}} my <b>fork</b> reloading, my <b>legs</b> tucked up as tightly as possible.|$|R
5000|$|Buell XB models also {{incorporated}} the industry's first Zero Torsional Load (ZTL) perimeter floating front disc brake system, a patented [...] "inside-out" [...] wheel/brake design {{that puts the}} brake disc on {{the outer edge of}} the wheel,rather than at the hub. This lets the suspension function better, improving control and traction, through reducing unsprung weight on the front wheel, because only a single disc and caliper - with a corresponding reduction in bolts and brake fluid - is needed compared with the conventional dual-disc brake setup on most modern sport bikes. In an exchange in the pages of Motorcyclist magazine between Suzuki engineer James Parker, creator of the GSX-RADD hub-center steering system, and Buell's Director of Analysis, Test & Engineering Process, Abraham Askenazi, Parker conceded the ZTL system's advantage in unsprung weight. But he pointed out the remaining weight is located further out on the rim where it is most detrimental to acceleration and braking, and that there were potential heat transfer issues, and the need for one <b>fork</b> <b>leg</b> to be stronger than the other. Responding, Askenazi disputed all of Parker's criticisms, saying the ZTL system was 30% lighter than the brakes on the Suzuki GSX-R1000, and that the inertia of having the weight further out on the rim, and the heat generation near the tire, were not negative factors, based on testing. Askenazi concluded that testing and race track experience had proven the ZTL to be [...] "state of the art." ...|$|E
50|$|Some {{manufacturers}} have tried other variations to the telescopic fork. For example, Cannondale designed a shock absorber build into the steerer tube called HeadShok, and a single-sided fork {{with just one}} leg, called Lefty. The stanchions of both systems are not round but have flat faces machined onto them which slide on needle bearings instead of bushings, this prevents the wheel from rotating {{in relation to the}} handlebars. Both of these systems claim to offer greater rigidity and better feel, with lighter weight. Others such as Proflex (Girvin), Whyte and BMW, have made suspension forks that employ four-bar linkage systems instead of relying upon telescopic <b>fork</b> <b>legs,</b> much like BMW's Duolever. The Suntour Swing Shock fork is based on a coil cantilevered swing set-up, and suspension is given by a coil spring which is located within the steerer tube and can be accessed from the top, technology which was originally used for suspension on early motorcycles.|$|R
50|$|Though the MN-A and the Maillet 20 {{had much}} in common, one obvious {{difference}} {{was in the}} landing gear. Both designs had mainwheels on vertical legs from the outer part of the wing inner section but the earlier model also had diagonal V-struts from axles to lower fuselage, whereas those of the Maillet 20 were cantilevers, without struttage. The legs had Messier oleo shock absorbers and mounted the wheels in <b>forks.</b> Both <b>legs</b> and wheels were enclosed in fairings.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Jesus {{has already}} rescued Adam {{from the mouth}} of hell, and a demon wraps his <b>fork</b> around Eve's <b>leg</b> to try to stop her leaving. Two other lost souls wait their chance to escape. A dragon sits {{at the top of the}} mouth.|$|R
60|$|And then (as Alice {{afterwards}} described it) {{all sorts}} of things happened in a moment. The candles all grew up to the ceiling, looking something like a bed of rushes with fireworks at the top. As to the bottles, they each took a pair of plates, which they hastily fitted on as wings, and so, with <b>forks</b> for <b>legs,</b> went fluttering about in all directions: 'and very like birds they look,' Alice thought to herself, as well as she could in the dreadful confusion that was beginning.|$|R
50|$|The terns {{are small}} to {{medium-sized}} seabirds {{closely related to}} the gulls, skimmers and skuas. They are gull-like in appearance, but typically have a lighter build, long pointed wings (which give them a fast, buoyant flight), a deeply <b>forked</b> tail, slender <b>legs,</b> and webbed feet. Most species are grey above and white below, and have a black cap which is reduced or flecked with white in the non-breeding season.|$|R
50|$|The Poite 3 had fixed, {{tailwheel}} landing gear, mounted {{from the}} outer wing centre-section with a track of2.40 m. Each mainwheel leg {{was based on a}} pylon formed by an almost vertical, quadrilateral, braced plate from the forward spar with its lower edge joined to the base of a triangular plate, its vertex fixed to the rear spar. Each mainwheel axle was mounted on a horizontal U-shaped frame hinged {{to the bottom of the}} pylon, with a <b>forked</b> vertical <b>leg</b> containing a rubber-ring Weydert shock absorber attached to a short forward spar extension. The whole structure was enclosed in a trouser-type fairing, with a forward, semi-circular extension for the wheel. The castoring tailwheel had a similar shock absorber and fairing. The mainwheels were fitted with independent brakes.|$|R
50|$|The {{design of}} the Lynch motor {{armature}} is significantly different compared to other types of motor. The armature coils are formed from insulated copper strips each in a 'U' shape (like a tuning <b>fork).</b> One <b>leg</b> is then bent 45 degrees clockwise, while the other leg is bent 45 degrees anticlockwise. Each coil leg contains several bends before reaching {{the outside of the}} armature to be able to pass radially through the ferrite ring before the ends finish 90 degree apart. At the outer edge each copper strip has a crimp forming an electrical connection to its companion 90 degrees rotated. The inner edge of the copper strips have the insulation removed on the front face only, to form the commutator surface where the brushes make contact.|$|R
5000|$|Transgression, 12 X 22 feet ( [...] 3.65 X 6.75 meters), oil on canvas, 1984 The {{composition}} {{divides the}} scene in three triangular parts dominated by a large central section extending its edges to the upper corners of the canvas. At the center top, two winding ladders entwine in V-shape form alongside two large birds of prey swooping over a scene intensified by divisions, shapes, and symmetry of spatial areas animated by struggling figures in various acts and encounters. According to critical analysis, this painting presents the human body as the most telling vehicle to {{a new sense of}} soul, and its transformation from the metaphysical to the communicative level. Kanso focuses on the process of transforming sexual desire into discourse and brings into focus the place of sex within techniques of communication and absence of communication as made explicit in psychoanalysis. The only clothed woman in the paintings is placed in the upper right of the center. She alludes to the Madonna reflecting connotations such as asceticism, confession, and mysticism, all concepts closely related to psychoanalysis as a human technique. Her clothing intensifies the sensuality of the nude figures that surround her. On the left side, the figures of a mother, father, and child are symbols of secular sexuality. Prominently positioned in the foreground is the backside of male figure with wing-shape raised arms and almost invisible bent down head is seen thrusting toward <b>forked</b> <b>legs</b> at the center surrounded by female figures. It is noted by some critics that sensuality and eroticism {{of the women in the}} painting reflect aspects that partake of Kali and her femininity embodying the erotic and the presence of the body as revolutionary. Hence the eroticism of these bodies and their revolutionary aspect.|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaf 51) A successful {{method for}} predicting the fatigue life of mountain bicycle suspension <b>fork</b> inner <b>legs</b> for the ASTM fatigue test {{was developed in}} this project. An analysis method was created to calculate the stress in legs based on the magnitude of an externally applied load, its reactions in the entire substructure of the fork, {{as well as any}} stress concentrations due to variation in the leg's profile geometry. The analysis also calculated the secondary source of stress created due to an interference fit between legs and crown. This analysis was extended to twenty-nine different configurations of legs, and a range of maximum stresses was used as input for fatigue testing. The raw material from which the legs were made was fatigue in isolation tested to failure to create an S-N diagram. The heat treatment of the raw material was varied over a range used in industry to most accurately represent the variation in material conditions of the final product. Statistical data curves were generated to capture the upper and lower bounds of fatigue life variation. Eighty-three documented ASTM fatigue test results were compared to the curves. Successful results where the data was within the curves were yielded for seventy-two out of the eighty-three data points. A Microsoft Excel spreadsheet was created and coded with Visual Basic to encapsulate all of the aforementioned calculations and return a stress analysis and fatigue life prediction for future design...|$|R
