On {{a break from}} filmmaking after Suspirias surprise success, Argento was spending time in Los Angeles, where an obsessed fan telephoned him repeatedly, to talk about Suspirias influence on him. According to Argento, the calls began pleasantly enough but before long became more insistent, eventually menacing.
