5|$|During {{the long}} history of the British science fiction {{television}} programme Doctor Who, a number of stories were proposed but, for a variety of reasons, never fully produced. Below is a list of unmade serials which were submitted by recognised professional writers and the BBC had intended to produce, but <b>for</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> <b>or</b> another were not made. Many have since been the subject of a feature in Doctor Who Magazine, or other professional periodicals or books devoted to the television show.|$|E
5|$|The see of Philadelphia {{had been}} vacant {{since the death}} of Bishop Michael Francis Egan in 1814, despite several efforts to fill it. Archbishop John Carroll of Baltimore, whose {{province}} included Philadelphia, had considered no fewer than fifteen priests for the position; some had been ruled out <b>for</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> <b>or</b> another, and others (including the apostolic administrator, Louis de Barth) had turned the job down. Part of the delay was logistical—Carroll was unsure of the exact procedure for selecting a candidate in the recently erected province—but part was due to the perceived undesirability of the post, which oversaw only a few small churches {{in a part of the}} nation with few Catholics. There was also a significant dispute (known as trusteeism) over the rights of churches' lay trustees that was likely to complicate the job of running the diocese. In Europe, the Church owned property and directly controlled its parishes through the clergy. In the United States, however, early Catholic churches were typically founded by laymen who purchased the property, and erected the church buildings. Those laypeople accordingly demanded some control over the administration of the parish, even after the arrival of clergy from Europe who held the traditional view of parish organization. In a larger sense, the dispute represented a difference in understandings of authority between Americans and Europeans.|$|E
5|$|A {{preponderance}} of historians favour {{the story that}} though the Victorious had sailed through the Lombok Strait rather than the Sunda, Britain had come off easily the best through {{a show of force}} during the Sunda Straits Crisis. Numerous accounts, including Gregory Fremont-Barnes' History of Counterinsurgency, are content with a simplified version that Indonesia closed the Strait <b>for</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> <b>or</b> another, and that the arrival of the task force assembled around the aging carrier had intimidated Sukarno into reopening it. A common argument is that the passage was an effective and daring show of force, and often ignores the Sunda Strait issue altogether. This was a sentiment shown by the crew of the Victorious herself, who during their passage through the Lombok Strait went to action stations at the sight of an Indonesian submarine and prepared to fire on it if there was any sign of hostility, and believed that the Indonesians thought it wiser to hold back in fear of their power. This was not a view that the British official reports sought to dissuade, depicting the result as a compromise concession by the Indonesians, who had in brinksmanship terms, 'blinked first' after British refusal to back down. The Foreign Office even went to the extremity of claiming that the Lombok Strait was just as convenient for passage as the Sunda Strait, despite its far greater distance from Singapore and Australia. At the very least, the subsequent Indonesian United Nations defeat and Abdul Rahman's agreement to avoid retaliation was a very positive result for Britain to take from the incident.|$|E

6000|$|After breakfast, I {{went out}} alone again, {{intending}} to hunt {{up some of}} the Sunday-schools and see how this generation of pupils might compare with their progenitors who had sat with me in those places and had probably taken me as a model--though I do not remember as to that now. By the public square there had been in my day a shabby little brick church called the 'Old Ship of Zion,' which I had attended as a Sunday-school scholar; and I found the locality easily enough, but not the old church; it was gone, and a trig and rather hilarious new edifice was in its place. The pupils were better dressed and better looking than were those of my time; consequently they did not resemble their ancestors; and consequently there was nothing familiar to me in their faces. Still, I contemplated them with a deep interest and a yearning wistfulness, and if I had been a girl I would have cried; for they were the offspring, and represented, and occupied the places, of boys and girls some of whom I had loved to love, and some of whom I had loved to hate, but all of whom were dear to me <b>for</b> the <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> <b>or</b> the other, so many years gone by--and, Lord, where be they now! ...|$|R
60|$|I do {{not think}} that they need end in failure except <b>for</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason.</b> The poet <b>or</b> poetaster cannot, now, except by flat lying and {{laborious}} forgery of old papers, produce any documentary evidence to prove the AUTHENTICITY of his attempt at imitation. Without documentary evidence of antiquity, no critic can approach the imitation except in a spirit of determined scepticism. He knows, certainly, that the ballad is modern, and, knowing that, he easily finds proofs of modernism even where they do not really exist. I am convinced that to imitate a ballad that would, except for the lack of documentary evidence, beguile the expert, is perfectly feasible. I even venture to offer examples of my own manufacture at the close of this volume. I can find nothing suspicious in them, except the deliberate insertion of formulae which occur in genuine ballads. Such wiederholungen are not reasons for rejection, in my opinion; but they are SUSPECT with people who do not understand that they are a natural and necessary feature of archaic poetry, and this fact Mr. Kittredge does understand.|$|R

40|$|Dynamic delay-fault {{injection}} for reconfigurable hardware Modern {{internet and}} telephone switches consist of numerous VLSI-circuits operating at high frequencies to handle high bandwidths.

Hardware manufacturers have a strong focus on quick fault-injection to verify and validate the correct function of such a (fault-tolerant) system. However, current FPGA-based fault injection schemes do not consider delay faults. In this paper we present an extension to traditional FPGA fault injection schemes without any additional hardware for fixed and small hardware overhead for dynamic phase shifting. By using digital clock managers (DCMs), {{we are able to}} inject delay faults very fast through phase-shift variation of the clock without reconfiguring the FPGA...|$|R

5000|$|Atomic nuclei {{consist of}} protons and {{neutrons}} bound {{together by the}} residual strong force. Because protons are positively charged, they repel each other. Neutrons, which are electrically neutral, stabilize the nucleus in two ways. Their copresence pushes protons slightly apart, reducing the electrostatic repulsion between the protons, and they exert the attractive nuclear force on each other and on protons. <b>For</b> this <b>reason,</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> more neutrons are necessary for two or more protons to be bound into a nucleus. As the number of protons increases, so does the ratio of neutrons to protons necessary to ensure a stable nucleus (see graph at right). For example, although the neutron-proton ratio of [...] is 1:2, the neutron-proton ratio of [...] is greater than 3:2. A number of lighter elements have stable nuclides with the ratio 1:1 (Z = N). The nuclide [...] (calcium-40) is observationally the heaviest stable nuclide with {{the same number of}} neutrons and protons; (theoretically, the heaviest stable one is sulfur-32).

40|$|Abstract 	The first {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to find a possible association between elevated milk fat to protein ratio (FPR) in days postpartum and pregnancy per artificial insemination (AI) to first service. To find a possible association between postpartum diseases and FPR in dairy cattle, was the second {{objective of}} this study. 	Data collected from 1200 Holstein Frisian milking cows were used in this study. Daily milk fat to protein ratios were collected from each cow up to 21 days in milk (DIM) for the first objective. A FPR> 1. 5 measured in more than 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 days within 21 DIM were collected. Pregnancy loss and time to pregnancy within 300 DIM were collected. For the second objective, data was collected in the first 30 days after parturition for presence of the postpartum diseases metritis, ketosis, displaced abomasum (DA), indigestion and mastitis. 	In statistical analysis no significance was found for FPR in more than 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 days within 21 DIM. <b>For</b> this <b>reason,</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> more days was chosen for further analysis since the number of cows were most equally distributed between low and high FPR and pregnancy per AI to first service. Chi-square and multiple logistic regression analysis were used to find a possible association between the variables. 	No significant outcome between FPR> 1. 5 <b>for</b> <b>one</b> or more days during the first 21 DIM and pregnancy to first AI. An association was found for the postpartum diseases DA, metritis and ketosis with FPR> 1. 5. No significant association was found between mastitis and FPR> 1. 5, and indigestion and FPR> 1. 5. 	 In this study FPR was not found to be a significant indicator to predict pregnancy per AI to first service. Postpartum diseases are associated FPR and therefore can aggravate negative energy balance (NEB) during early lactation...|$|R
5000|$|Although the plane's {{safety record}} does not equal that of newer-generation airliners, {{there were no}} fatal {{accidents}} involving an Il-62 between 1989 and 2009 during which time {{the highest number of}} planes were in service [...] With successive Il-62M upgrades and improved avionics, including triplex inertial navigation systems and enhanced flight controls to cope with poor visibility (IMP, 1997), the plane gained a reputation as a very safe airliner whose record compares favorably with similar airliners, most of which are no longer in civilian use. Its total hull loss rate (7.7%) is lower than those of the Boeing 707 (16.4%) and DC-8 (14.9%), and near that of the VC10/Super VC10 (= 7.8% if one excludes the three examples destroyed by terrorists) although the VC10 was only in civilian service for 16 years (versus 48 years for the Il-62, as at 2015), and only 40 of 54 airframes were built as airliners (the remaining 14 going to the RAF). Several Il-62/M accidents over the first decades of operation mainly involved runway overruns or aborted takeoffs. The braking system employed the reverse thrust of the outer engines only, and if <b>for</b> some <b>reason</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> other failed to engage, the aircraft could become difficult to steer for an unprepared pilot. In seven takeoff or landing accidents there were no fatalities, a testament to the high level of structural integrity (and in two cases with landing-related fatalities and UP-16208 these were due to the aircraft colliding with structures near the runway and concrete wall, respectively). The Il-62/M fuselage features a strengthened hull with 'ski' keel originally designed to allow for an undercarriage-up emergency landing (in practice the undercarriage and landing gear proved extremely reliable). However, the trade-off for the reinforced airframe is the relatively high fuel consumption and some airlines such as Interflug modified their planes to reduce fuel consumption [...]|$|R
5000|$|Gina Bellman as Sophie Devereaux, called [...] "The Grifter", is an {{accomplished}} British grifter {{with a taste}} for art theft and a desire to become a legitimate actress. Multi-lingual and particularly adept at the use of accents, Sophie is seen to portray many characters in various cons, usually making direct contact with marks to draw them into the con. Comically, her attempts to make a career as an actress lead to nothing but failure, as she proves woefully untalented and over-the-top onstage. Only during a con, when she can disappear effortlessly into a character, can she actually act well, ironically, if she is pretending to be an actress. (As Nate phrases it, [...] "She can act...when it's an act.") Sophie has a collection of aliases, which includes [...] "Sophie Devereaux", and her real name is unknown. She has a long history with Nate, dating back at least 10 years to a period when he investigated her spree of art theft for IYS. At some point, they recognized an attraction to one another (possibly around the time they shot each other) and their relationship wavers between platonic and romantic for much of the show's run, leaving Sophie alternately frustrated, angry, and disappointed. Sophie often acts as second in command to Nate and will take charge when Nate is out of control. Sophie and Nate have on occasion tried to further the relationship, but <b>for</b> various <b>reasons,</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> the other resisted until they wound up in bed together in the third-season finale. After that, they settle into an occasionally bumpy, but devoted, romance.
