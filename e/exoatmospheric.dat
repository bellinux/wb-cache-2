5|$|Data {{from the}} ZDR was {{passed to the}} All-Target Processor (ATP), which ran initial {{processing}} on as many as 625 objects in a cloud. As many as 50 of these could be picked out for further processing in the Discrimination and Control Computer (DCC), which ran more tests on those tracks and assigned each one a probability of being the warhead or decoy. The DCC was able to run 100 different tests. For <b>exoatmospheric</b> signals the tests included measure of radar return pulse-to-pulse to look for tumbling objects, as well as variations in signals strength due to changes in frequency. Within the atmosphere, the primary method was examining the velocities of the objects to determine their mass.|$|E

25|$|Developed by Lockheed {{as part of}} the {{ground-based}} interceptor {{portion of}} SDI, the <b>Exoatmospheric</b> Reentry-vehicle Interceptor Subsystem (ERIS) began in 1985, with at least two tests occurring in the early 1990s.

25|$|The A-35 {{anti-ballistic missile}} system was a Soviet {{military}} anti-ballistic missile (ABM) system deployed around Moscow to intercept enemy ballistic missiles targeting {{the city or}} its surrounding areas. The A-35 was the only Soviet ABM system allowed under the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. In development since the 1960s and in operation from 1971 until the 1990s, it featured the nuclear-tipped A350 <b>exoatmospheric</b> interceptor missile. The A-35 {{was supported by the}} two Dunay radars (NATO: Cat House and Dog House) and the Soviet early warning system. It was followed by the A-135 in the early 1990s.|$|E
500|$|The Life {{opens to}} a {{military}} funeral of an ODST. Rows of candles arranged along the floor burn as a bagpiper plays a dirge. The assembled mourners, a mix of military personnel and civilians, attend as the casket's red ODST flag is removed, revealing {{the name of the}} deceased. A young man looks on as the cloth is ceremonially folded and passed to a woman among the mourners. A song in Welsh begins to play as the attending officer orders a gun salute in Hungarian. The camera cuts to another scene; the young man, Tarkov, is having his head shaved in the first of a montage of scenes depicting Tarkov undergoing recruit training. Again, the camera cuts ahead. Tarkov is in a one-man [...] "drop pod", known in universe as the Single Occupant <b>Exoatmospheric</b> Insertion Vehicle (SOEIV), entering the atmosphere of an alien planet, onto a battlefield. He emerges under fire alongside several other soldiers, moving over corpses and through plasma fire until a Covenant Brute knocks him aside, sending his helmet flying and scarring Tarkov's face. Tarkov fires his M7S SMG at the Brute to no avail. However, he is saved when a falling Banshee crashes into the Brute, killing it. The film jumps ahead again; Tarkov is now a veteran soldier, and oversees a memorial service for one of his fallen comrades amidst burning ruins with a recruit that bears a resemblance to a younger Tarkov. Soon, sounds of gunfire draws him and his team back to the fight, closing with the lines [...] "We are ODST" [...] which transitions again into [...] "Halo 3: ODST".|$|E
2500|$|One of the UNSC's {{unclassified}} {{special forces}} units are the Orbital Drop Shock Troopers or ODSTs. They are also called Helljumpers after their motto [...] "Feet first into hell." [...] They specialize in orbital combat insertions via Single-Occupant <b>Exoatmospheric</b> Insertion Vehicles (SOEIVs) jettisoned from ships in low orbit. The 105th Marine Expeditionary Unit (SOC) are labeled as the 'Helljumpers'. As characterized by author William C. Dietz in , the future corps shares thematic similarities to the present-day United States Marines.|$|E

50|$|Missile defense {{can take}} place either inside (endoatmospheric) or outside (<b>exoatmospheric)</b> the Earth's atmosphere.
