5|$|Beginning {{with the}} work of J. D. Brown and Marc Henneaux in 1986, {{physicists}} have noticed that quantum gravity in a three-dimensional spacetime is closely related to two-dimensional conformal field theory. In 1995, Henneaux and his coworkers explored this relationship in more detail, suggesting that three-dimensional gravity in anti-de Sitter space <b>is</b> <b>equivalent</b> <b>to</b> the conformal field theory known as Liouville field theory. Another conjecture formulated by Edward Witten states that three-dimensional gravity in anti-de Sitter space <b>is</b> <b>equivalent</b> <b>to</b> a conformal field theory with monster group symmetry. These conjectures provide examples of the AdS/CFT correspondence that do not require the full apparatus of string or M-theory.|$|E
