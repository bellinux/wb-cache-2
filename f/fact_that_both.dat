5|$|Due {{to their}} shared {{association}} with skiing and the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>both</b> place names referring to Ullr and Skaði appear most frequently in Sweden, {{some scholars have}} proposed a particular {{connection between the two}} gods. On the other hand, Skaði may potentially be a masculine form and, as a result, some scholars have theorized that Skaði may have originally been a male deity.|$|E
5|$|Dundee United's {{traditional}} rivals are Dundee, {{with whom}} they compete in the Dundee derby. The fixture was lacking a competitive element {{for a number of}} years until Dundee's return to the top flight of the Scottish game. A unique element of the rivalry lies in the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>both</b> clubs' stadiums are located within 100 yards of one another.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the French tradition, the Natchez and their conflicts with the French have been mostly forgotten in contemporary American historiography. Historian Gordon Sayre attributes this to the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>both</b> the French and the Natchez were defeated in colonial wars before {{the birth of the}} United States.|$|E
5000|$|The {{concern with}} realism and the {{constructed}} nature of historical and literary <b>facts</b> <b>that</b> <b>both</b> Barthes and Ankersmit expressed {{is also to}} be found in the field of Discursive psychology; and Jonathan Potter has analysed similar problems and issues in his [...] "Representing Reality" [...] (Potter 1996).|$|R

5|$|Antón, as expected, {{was named}} as the squad {{leader for the}} Vuelta a España. His goal was overall success. He was joined in the squad by fellow Giro d'Italia stage winner Nieve, Martínez, Verdugo, Txurruka, Oroz, Isasi, Azanza and Cazaux. Nieve commented a day into the Vuelta that he would ride solely to support Antón, despite the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>both</b> had won Giro stages and he (Nieve) had {{actually}} finished the race higher overall.|$|E
5|$|Both {{individually}} {{and as a}} comedic duo, Pascal and Maximus have garnered universal acclaim from film critics, who referred to the characters as scene stealers – British magazine SFX dubbed Maximus the film's breakout star while The Age hailed the character as the funniest horse in film history – in addition to praising the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>both</b> characters are refreshingly funny, expressive and charismatic {{without the use of}} dialogue. Additionally, several film critics preferred Pascal and Maximus to the film's couple.|$|E
5|$|Both {{operations}} were {{hampered by the}} German need to rely on their Croatian allies {{as well as the}} <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>both</b> forces were ill-equipped for operations in mountainous terrain during extreme winter conditions. The Croatian units had proven not to be a useful addition to the operation, as they possessed {{little in the way of}} fighting power, had little unit cohesion and suffered from serious supply problems.|$|E
5000|$|The {{squadron}} nickname, [...] "Basutoland", {{is derived}} from the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> during <b>both</b> world wars, the Basutoland Protectorare, now Lesotho, donated aircraft to RAF, which were assigned to No. 72 Squadron.|$|R

50|$|Southworth {{also tried}} out for 11th season of The Ultimate Fighter. However, despite the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> the <b>both</b> Middleweights and Light-Heavyweights {{were invited to}} try out, the UFC decided that the season would focus {{exclusively}} on Middleweights.|$|R
5|$|CUNY and the State University of New York (SUNY) are {{different}} university systems, despite the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>both</b> are public institutions that receive {{funding from the}} state of New York. The 64 SUNY and 24 CUNY campus institutions are part of University of the State of New York (USNY). USNY is the governmental umbrella organization for most education-related institutions and many education-related personnel (both public and private) in the state of New York, and which includes, as a component, the New York State Education Department.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} greeted warmly by the {{majority}} of the boxing community, with many experts believing the Rocky character is still a key symbol of the sport and that the boxing scenes were the most realistic of any film. On the DVD, Stallone attributes this {{to the fact that he}} used realistic sound-effects (the previous installments had become notorious for their unrealistic and loud sounds of punches landing) and the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>both</b> Stallone and Tarver threw real punches at each other.|$|E
5|$|The {{present form}} of the {{doctrine}} seems to be unchanged {{at least since the}} time of Bhadrabahu (c. 300 BCE) who is respected by both the sects. This is supported by the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>both</b> Svetambara and Digambara sects agree on the basic doctrine, giving indication that it reached in its present form before the schism took place. Bhadrabahu is usually seen as the last leader of united Jain sangh. Detailed codification of types of karma and their effects were attested by Umasvati who is regarded by both Digambara and Svetambara as one of theirs.|$|E

25|$|Serpulids and sabellids are two {{families}} of the Sabellida suborder of Canalipalpata tubeworms that are similar in nearly every respect, {{but they can be}} readily distinguished by the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> while <b>both</b> have radioles, the sabellids (such as Sabella pavonina) lack an operculum.|$|R
50|$|This {{result is}} not {{changed by the}} <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> for <b>both</b> items, the capital cost per unit would change as the two prices change (contrary to the {{assumption}} made above). Nor does it change if the wage rate and labor cost per unit (W) change.|$|R
5|$|An {{additional}} intensity to {{the rivalry}} is the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>both</b> Maribor and Olimpija always had support on their matches from ultras groups, called Viole Maribor (supporting Maribor), and the Green Dragons, who support Olimpija. The two groups {{are the largest}} in the country, and it is not uncommon that the matches between the two clubs were sometimes interrupted by violent clashes between the two groups or with the police. On many occasions, before or after the matches, the fans of the two clubs would also meet up and fight on the streets. One of the worst incidents, in April 2010 after a match, resulted in a stabbing of a member of the Green Dragons who, with a group of friends, got into a fight with members of the Viole in Ljubljana's railway station. However, to date, there have not been any fatalities in the country related to football violence.|$|E
5|$|Atomic {{exchange}} involves {{exchange between}} an adatom and an adjacent atom within the surface lattice. As {{shown in figure}} 4, after an atomic exchange event the adatom has taken {{the place of a}} surface atom and the surface atom has been displaced and has now become an adatom. This process may take place in both heterodiffusion (e.g. Pt adatoms on Ni) and self-diffusion (e.g. Pt adatoms on Pt). It is still unclear from a theoretical point of view why the atomic exchange mechanism is more predominant in some systems than in others. Current theory points towards multiple possibilities, including tensile surface stresses, surface relaxation about the adatom, and increased stability of the intermediate due to the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>both</b> atoms involved maintain high levels of coordination throughout the process.|$|E
5|$|In mid-1968, Motown {{initiated}} {{a number of}} high-profile collaborations for the Supremes with their old colleagues, the Temptations. Besides the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>both</b> groups had come up together, the pairings made financial sense: the Supremes had a mostly white fanbase, while the Temptations a mostly black fanbase. By 1969, the label began plans for a Diana Ross solo career. A number of candidates—most notably Syreeta Wright—were considered to replace Ross. After seeing 24-year-old Jean Terrell perform with her brother Ernie in Florida, Berry Gordy decided on Ross' replacement. Terrell was signed to Motown and began recording the first post-Ross Supremes songs with Wilson and Birdsong during the day, while Wilson and Birdsong toured with Ross at night. At the same time, Ross began to make her first solo recordings. In November 1969, Ross' solo career was publicly announced.|$|E
50|$|Due to the {{popularity}} of the cocktail during the Tiki craze and the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> Beach <b>both</b> kept his recipe secret and occasionally altered it, today there are many variations of the Zombie made at many restaurants and bars, some showing few similarities to the original cocktail.|$|R
50|$|Avakai Biryani (Pickeled Biryani) is {{a coming}} of age story of two {{individuals}} from two completely different backgrounds and cultural upbringing.

He and Dorian briefly discuss their past relationship, and the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> they <b>both</b> still think of each other.|$|R
5|$|Pospisil {{is more of}} a {{contemporary}} rather than a rival of Raonic. Owing to their similarity in age—Pospisil is six months older—and the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>both</b> are successful products of Tennis Canada's development programs, they have been linked as the leaders {{of a new generation of}} Canadian tennis players. They partnered in doubles frequently early in their careers, winning doubles titles together in junior and ATP Challenger events. Between 2011 and 2015, Raonic and Pospisil have been the two top-ranked Canadian men in year-end rankings. As well as four ATP Challenger and Futures matches, they have played each other in two ATP World Tour matches: Raonic beat Pospisil in the first all-Canadian semifinal at an ATP 1000 tournament, and in the first all-Canadian final in ATP history. They are frequent Davis Cup teammates, and they planned to play doubles together at the 2016 Rio Olympics until Raonic withdrew.|$|E
5|$|Roosevelt {{had been}} {{surprised}} by {{the outcome of the}} Republican convention, having expected to oppose a conservative isolationist. The polls showed Willkie behind by only six points, and the president expected this to be a more difficult race than he had faced in his defeats of Hoover and Landon. Roosevelt felt that Willkie's nomination would remove the war issue from the campaign. Roosevelt was nominated by the Democratic convention in Chicago in July, though he stated that because of the world crisis, he would not actively campaign, leaving that to surrogates. The <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>both</b> major-party presidential candidates favored intervention frustrated isolationists, who considered wooing Charles Lindbergh as a third party candidate.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after his}} seizure of power, Gelimer's {{domestic}} position began to deteriorate, as he persecuted his political enemies among the Vandal nobility, confiscating their property and executing many of them. These actions undermined his already doubtful legitimacy {{in the eyes}} of many, and contributed to the outbreak of two revolts in remote provinces of the Vandal kingdom: in Sardinia, where the local governor, Godas, declared himself an independent ruler, and shortly after in Tripolitania, where the native population, led by a certain Pudentius, rebelled against Vandal rule. Although Procopius' narrative makes both uprisings seem coincidental, Ian Hughes points out the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>both</b> rebellions broke out shortly before the commencement of the Roman expedition against the Vandals, and that both Godas and Pudentius immediately asked for assistance from Justinian, as evidence of an active diplomatic involvement by the Emperor in their preparation.|$|E

50|$|In {{agreement}} with {{this model is}} also the <b>fact</b> <b>that,</b> while <b>both</b> HIV-1 and HIV-2 attain substantial viral loads in the human organism, adventitious SIV infecting humans seldom does so: people with SIV antibodies often have very low or even undetectable SIV viral load. This suggests <b>that</b> <b>both</b> HIV-1 and HIV-2 are adapted to humans, and serial passage {{could have been the}} process responsible for it.|$|R
5|$|The {{probable}} {{properties of}} further alkali metals beyond unhexpentium {{have not been}} explored yet as of 2015; in fact, it is suspected {{that they may not}} be able to exist. In periods 8 and above of the periodic table, relativistic and shell-structure effects become so strong that extrapolations from lighter congeners become completely inaccurate. In addition, the relativistic and shell-structure effects (which stabilise the s-orbitals and destabilise and expand the d-, f-, and g-orbitals of higher shells) have opposite effects, causing even larger difference between relativistic and non-relativistic calculations of the properties of elements with such high atomic numbers. Interest in the chemical properties of ununennium and unhexpentium stems from the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>both</b> elements are located close to the expected locations of islands of stabilities, centered at elements 122 (306Ubb) and 164 (482Uhq).|$|E
5|$|While Wilco was {{recording}} tracks, Jay Farrar {{formed a}} band of his own, Son Volt. Son Volt signed to Warner Bros. Records and began recording their first album (also produced by Paulson), Trace, in November 1994. The <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>both</b> Wilco and Son Volt began working on album almost immediately after the Uncle Tupelo breakup caused debate among critics, fans, and Warner Brothers about {{which would be the}} better band. Joe McEwen, who originally signed Uncle Tupelo to a Warner subsidiary, felt that Wilco was taking a step backwards from the material on Anodyne. McEwen urged Richard Dodd, who had recently mixed Tom Petty's Wildflowers, to remix the album. Dodd emphasized Tweedy's vocals to increase the chances of success on radio.|$|E
5|$|Duke {{regards the}} rivalry as far less {{significant}} than the Carolina–Duke rivalry. The Duke–Michigan rivalry {{is fueled by}} the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>both</b> institutions strive to be premier academic institutions with solid reputations for producing scholars and student athletes rather than just athletic powerhouses. Duke and Michigan have played one another in men's basketball 30 times. The teams have played twice in the same season three times: 1963–64, 1991–92, and 2008–09. Michigan has played Duke more times than they have any other school outside {{of the state of}} Michigan that has never {{been a member of the}} Big Ten Conference. In turn, Duke's 30 games against Michigan are the most they have played any other school outside of the Maryland-Virginia-North Carolina-South Carolina region that has never been a member of the Atlantic Coast Conference. Eight of the meetings between Duke and Michigan have featured opponents both ranked in the top ten in the AP Poll; six times both teams were ranked in the top five. Michigan has not faced any of its fellow conference members as many times with both participants so highly ranked.|$|E
