50|$|A well on one {{property}} can <b>drain</b> <b>oil</b> or {{gas from}} neighboring properties, and horizontal drilling can facilitate this. In {{some parts of}} the U.S., the rule of capture gives the landowner rights to any resources they extract from their well. Other states have unitization rules for sharing royalties based on the geometries of the reservoir and the property lines above it.|$|E
50|$|On December 7, 1962, {{workers at}} the Richards Oil Plant in Savage forgot to open steam lines that heated oil pipes at the plant. On December 8, these pipes burst in low temperatures. They spilled one million gallons of {{petroleum}} into the Minnesota River. By January 24, 1963, the Department of Health traced downstream oil back to Richards Oil. Employees claimed only a small leak had occurred. The Department of Health requested that Richards Oil clean up the oil but could only take action {{if there was a}} public health emergency. Richards continued to <b>drain</b> <b>oil</b> until March.|$|E
50|$|The rule of capture {{provides}} that an oil producer with a wellbore {{on his property}} is allowed to <b>drain</b> <b>oil</b> out from underneath his land—even if some of that oil originated from a neighbor's land, migrating to the oil producer's land through geologic forces or drainage. The rule of capture gives landowners an incentive to pump out oil {{as quickly as possible}} by accerlerating their operations or drilling multiple wells to capture the oil of their neighbors. Such practice may deplete the gas pressure needed to force oil from the ground, which will reduce the amount of oil available for recovery from that reservoir. State law often limits the rule of capture to protect correlative rights of neighboring owners. Government agencies and state oil and gas conservation commissions, such as the Texas Railroad Commission, have developed conservation laws which regulate extraction by individual owners {{to protect the rights of}} the mineral owners and to prevent economic and physical waste.|$|E

40|$|Suppose {{you were}} to {{describe}} Tom <b>draining</b> <b>oil</b> from the engine of his car in 20 seconds. As a competent English speaker, depending on context, you could choose among at least the following subtly different descriptions, called paraphrases by Stede: 1. For 20 seconds, the <b>oil</b> <b>drained</b> from the engine. 2. The engine drained in 20 seconds. 3. Within 20 seconds, Tom drained the engine. 4. Tom drained the engine of the oil in 20 seconds. In contrast, a state-of-the-art natural language generation (NLG) system would likely {{be able to produce}} only one of them, modulo variations introduced by, for example, passivization, topicalization, or pronominalization. The problem is not simply to choose among paraphrases, but to be able to produce them to start with. In this book, an extended version of his dissertation, Stede provides the theoretical and practical means of endowing a text generator with such capability. He concentrates on tactical planning, namely, on choosing an appropriate verbalization for some content that another component of the NLG system (the text planner) has assemble...|$|R

40|$|A {{solution}} {{has been}} proposed that ensures <b>oil</b> <b>drain</b> from the discharge chamber to the pump inlet.

By diminishing the spring force, 30 % reduction of the flow rate has been achieved. It is difficult to get more because of stability reasons.

One-way clutches prevented rotation of the input shafts when the couplings were drained. The engine outputs were combined in pairs by two sets of differential gearing, and the output shafts from these two gearsets were then combined by a third differential gearset to drive the main output shaft.|$|R
40|$|This {{experimental}} thesis {{presents a}} study of two diffusive EOR techniques; low salinity waterflooding in 2 D sandstone silicon wafer micromodels and miscible CO 2 injection in tight shale core samples. Tests were conducted using both refined oils and crude oil. During low salinity waterflooding, a salinity gradient was set up between low salinity water injected through a fracture and a porous network partially saturated with high salinity brine. Primary <b>drained</b> <b>oil</b> acted as a semi-permeable membrane between the two aqueous phases. As part of a recently started CO 2 project, experiments involved injection of liquid and supercritical CO 2 through tight shale cores to produce oil primarily by molecular diffusion. Osmotic diffusion in presence of a salinity gradient resulted in increased water flux and oil mobilization, visualized within separate pores and in networks of interconnected pores. Diffusive transport mechanisms were identified as water diffusion through film-flow and osmosis. Two effective processes were observed by the identified mechanisms, 1) water dispersion and water droplet growth and 2) residual oil displacement and mobilization. Water flux through a refined oil membrane increased with brine salinity and decreased with increasing oil carbon number. Highest oil displacement and mobilization was observed with low carbon numbered oil (n-Hexane) and moderate high salinity brine (5...|$|R

40|$|Oil spills, {{no matter}} where they occur, elicit {{environmental}} concern and avoiding these disasters should be a priority. Old pipelines that are not regularly maintained and carry large amounts of crude oil long distances are of particular concern. One such pipeline is the 65 year-old Pegasus pipeline owned by ExxonMobil. On March 29, 2013, 795, 000 L of Wabasca Heavy Canadian crude oil spilled into a neighborhood of Mayflower, Arkansas, when the Pegasus pipeline ruptured. This spill led to the evacuation of many homes in the surrounding neighborhood. Drainage ditches in the affected neighborhood <b>drained</b> <b>oil</b> into a nearby cove of Lake Conway. This lake is popular for recreational fishing, thus concerns were raised not only about the potential effects of the oil spill on area residents, but also the lake and its biological communities. Ultimately, this project assessed the effect of the oil spill in water and sediment samples on freshwater test organisms. Samples were collected at 6 sites in the affected neighborhood and in Lake Conway. Chronic Whole Effluent Toxicity (WET) tests were performed on water samples using Pimephales promelas and Ceriodaphnia dubia. Acute sediment toxicity tests were performed using Chironomus dilutus. These tests measured sub-lethal toxicity in {{at least one of the}} sampled sites, indicating that further investigation of environmental after-effects is warranted...|$|R

40|$|Advanced {{reservoir}} characterization techniques are being applied to selected reservoirs in the Frio fluvial-deltaic sandstone trend {{in order to}} maximize the economic producibility of resources in this mature oil play. More than half of the reservoirs in this play have already been abandoned, and large volumes of oil may remain unproduced unless advanced characterization techniques are applied to define untapped, incompletely drained, and new pool reservoirs as suitable targets for near-term recovery methods. This project is developing interwell-scale geological facies models and assessing engineering attributes of reservoirs in selected fields in order to characterize reservoir architecture, flow unit boundaries, and the controls that these characteristics exert on the location and volume of unrecovered mobile and residual oil. Phase 1 consisted of reservoir selection and initial framework characterization. Phase 2 involved advanced characterization to delineate incremental resource opportunities. Subtasks included volumetric assessments of untapped and incompletely <b>drained</b> <b>oil</b> along with an analysis of specific targets for recompletion and strategic infill drilling. The third phase of the project consists of documentation of Phase 2 results, technology transfer, and the extrapolation of specific results from reservoirs in this study to other heterogeneous fluvial-deltaic reservoirs within and beyond the Frio play in South Texas. Project work during this quarter consisted of (1) documentation of Phase 2 tasks associated with the delineation of untapped and incompletely drained reservoir compartments and new pool reservoirs in selected Frio fluvial-deltaic sandstone intervals in Rincon and Tijerina-Canales-Blucher fields, as well as (2) Phase 3 tasks related to the transfer of the technologies to industry that aided in delineation...|$|R
