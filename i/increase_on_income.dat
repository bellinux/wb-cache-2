40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{assess whether}} Brazilian middle-aged adults living in cities that {{experienced}} a relative <b>increase</b> <b>on</b> <b>income</b> inequality {{were more likely}} to have severe tooth loss and lack a functional dentition. METHODS: Data on Brazilian adults aged 35 - 44 years from state capitals and Federal District from the 2010 Brazilian Oral Health Survey (SBBrasil 2010) were analyzed. Clinically assessed tooth loss outcomes were severe tooth loss (< 9 remaining natural teeth) and lack of functional dentition (< 21 natural teeth). Income inequality was assessed by Gini Index in 1991, 2000, and 2003 using tertiles of distribution. Variation in Gini Index was assessed by changes in the tertiles distribution between years. Multilevel logistic regression models were used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95 percent confidence intervals (95 percent CI) between variation in income inequality and tooth loss outcomes adjusting for individual socio-demographic characteristics. RESULTS: Prevalence of severe tooth loss and lack of functional dentition was 4. 8 percent and 21. 2 percent, respectively. Individuals living in cities with moderate and high increase in income inequality between 1991 and 2003 {{were more likely to}} have severe tooth loss and lack a functional dentition in 2010 compared with those living in cities with stable income inequality in the same period. Relationships between low family income and both tooth loss outcomes were significantly attenuated by relative increases in income inequality. CONCLUSIONS: Relative increases in income inequality were significantly associated with severe tooth loss and lack of a functional dentition in Brazilian middle-aged adults...|$|E

40|$|The broad {{objective}} {{of the study is}} to investigate the impact of Land and Agrarian reforms on poverty alleviation in Joubertina. Purposive sampling method (non-probability sampling) was carried out mainly on two groups of people, land reform beneficiary in Jay Dee Rovon and non-beneficiary in Mon Desire. Moreover, the stratified random sampling method was also applied in Jay Dee Rovon to choose a sample of 60 households from 129 land reform beneficiaries in Jay Dee Rovon and simple random sample of 60 applied to Mon Desire household subsistence. Binary Logistic Regression model was used to test factors that influenced beneficiary on level of production. Results indicated that age and farming experience were significant variables. Age had a negative coefficient value, meaning an increase in age was less likely to cause beneficiary to produce at commercial level. Descriptive statistics revealed that farming activities in the study areas seems to be performed mostly by relatively medium age people followed by younger people and lastly by the older people. Moreover, farming experience with positive coefficient revealed that it is highly likely to influence the beneficiary to produce at commercial for marketing. The older the farmer the more the experience s/he had in farming activities. However, descriptive revealed, medium and young age people with little knowledge tend to be more active than older people on farming activities {{but on the other hand}} they are more capable of carrying out physical activities. The results revealed that land reform beneficiaries likely to influence the level of production for marketing while non-beneficiaries produce for home consumption and little for sale in local market. An improvement on yield results an <b>increase</b> <b>on</b> <b>income</b> and thus leading to a change in ownership of household’s durable assets. An increase in yield also indirectly results employment recreation, increasing real wage and improve farm income thus leading to poverty reduction in JDR as compare to MD.

40|$|This paper {{documents}} and explains {{the evolution of}} monetary poverty in Bolivia during the period 1999 - 2011. First, we find {{a significant reduction in}} both, extreme and moderate, poverty. During the period under analysis, extreme poverty headcount, gap and severity have reduced in 55 %, 67 % and 73 %; while moderate poverty headcount, gap and severity have reduced in 32 %, 50 % and 60 %, res- pectively. The speed of poverty reduction was greater in extreme poverty than in moderate poverty, with significant differences by poverty measures, areas, and time periods. On the one hand, the ave- rage reduction rate in extreme poverty headcount in urbal areas was 10. 4 % per year in the 2005 - 2011 period and 3. 5 % per year in the 1999 - 2005 period; while in rural areas was 7. 2 % per year in the 2005 - 2011 period and 3. 9 % per year in the 1999 - 2005 period. On the other hand, the average reduction rate in moderate poverty headcount in urbal areas was 3. 7 % per year in the 2005 - 2011 period and 1. 9 % per year in the 1999 - 2005 period; while in rural areas was 4. 4 % per year in the 2005 - 2011 period and 2. 4 % per year in the 1999 - 2005 period. Second, we find that growth of and redistribution in per-capita hou- sehold income have played different roles in poverty reductions by are and time period. On the one hand, poverty changes in urban areas during the 1999 - 2005 period are mainly explained by the growth in per-capita income - which was enough to compensate for the <b>increase</b> <b>on</b> <b>income</b> inequality; while poverty changes during the 2005 - 2011 period was the result of both, growth in and redistribution of per-capita income.
