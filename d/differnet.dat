50|$|The 10x {{platform}} uses {{a method}} based on emulsion PCR {{in order to}} produce Linked-Reads or single-cell data. The 10x Chromium System utilizes GemCode Technology for massively-parallel partitioning of high molecular weight DNA fragments (HMW-gDNA) or of whole single-cells into micelles, along with an adapter molecule and a barcode sequence. Within each micelle the gel bead dissolves, delivering reagents that barcode smaller fragments of genomic DNA or single-cell derived messenger RNA within the micelle. Each of the smaller fragments retain the barcode sequence which is used to identify its parent micelle, which map to the genomic HMW-gDNA molecule or to the single cell transcriptome from which they are originally derived. After amplification, the emulsion is broken and the fragments are pooled, where it undergoes a standard library preparation. After DNA sequencing, there are <b>differnet</b> analytical pipelines for genome and single-cell transcriptome analysis. In the case of genomic DNA, the reads are aligned and linked to form a series of fragments covering around 50kb, called a Linked-Read. In contrast to the Illumina synthetic long-read platform, this approach does not yield full coverage of each input HMW-gDNA molecule. Instead, the Linked-Reads from a single micelle are dispersed across the original HMW-fDNA molecule; however improved read coverage arises through the process being applied to very large numbers of uniquely identifiable micelles.|$|E

40|$|Long {{distance}} {{excitation energy}} transfer between a donor and an acceptor {{embedded in a}} polymer chain is usually assumed to occur via the Forster mechanism which predicts a 1 /R^ 6 distance dependence of the transfer rate, where R is {{the distance between the}} donor and the acceptor. In solution R fluctuates with time. In this work, a Brownian dynamics simulation of a polymer chain with Forster enregy transfer between the two ends is carried out and the time dependence of the survival probability S_p(t) is obtained. The latter can be measured by the flourescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) technique, which is now widely used to study conformations of biopolymers via the single molecule spectroscopy. It is found that the suvival probability is exponential-like when the Forster radius (R_F) is comparable to the root mean square radius(L) of the polymer chain. The decay is strongly non-exponential both for small and large (R_F), and also for large k_F.

This substantiation draws on two interrelated issues: (1) as people concerned with language education, teachers are responsible for practice which is mediated by different theories in the postmethod era, and (2) each theory allows for looking at the learner from one perspective according to which only partial understanding of the learner is within reach (only partial theoretical resource to pave the grounds for effective learning opportunities is available). Furthermore, since depending upon a particular theory there might be an understanding of the learner <b>differnet</b> from and sometimes even the opposite of that formed on the basis of another theory, and because in the postmethod era practice in general and moment by moment instances of practice in particular are quite likely to be subjected to opposing theories, it is concluded that the foreign language learner does not have a particular identity...|$|E

Absorption and inhibition experiments did not give evidence that the SMA activity in seronegative polyarthritis was confined to the gamma-bands in the synovial fluids. The SMA activity in the fluids seemed to be directed against both actin and 'non-actin' muscular antigens. The association between locally produced oligoclonal immunoglobulins and possible locally produced SMA with <b>differnet</b> electrophoretic mobility suggests that in some of thes patients there is a local synovial production of oligoclonal antibodies with different specificities.
