40|$|Purpose: In {{this paper}} the {{mechanical}} properties {{and structure of}} cold rolled austenitic stainless steel X 5 CrNi 18 - 8 with a draft of 17 %- 78 % were presented. Design/methodology/approach: The main methods used for these researches were the static tensile test, microhardness and metallographic observations by optical microscopy. The tested samples have also been analyzed fractographically. The amount of martensite α’ in the obtained microstructures was investigated with X-ray diffraction patterns. The scope {{of this study was}} to achieve the correlations between the mechanical and structural properties of cold rolled stainless steel. Findings: Results showed increasing the mechanical properties (Rm, Rp 0. 2, HV) and decreasing the plasticity (A) with the increasing <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>draft</b> during cold rolling of investigated austenitic stainless steel. Research limitations/implications: In future examinations there is a need to broadening the methodology about the magnetic properties investigations which in the more precise way permit to define the quantity of the martensite α’ phase in the structure of steelX 5 CrNi 18 - 10 and describe its morphology. Practical implications: A wide range of practical applications of austenitic X 5 CrNi 18 - 8 steel sheets is warranted by both their high corrosion resistance and high plastic properties, especially in the supersaturated state. Originality/value: The analytic dependence of the yield point (Rp 0. 2) of the investigated steel on the draft degree in cold rolling has been confirmed...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (MScEng (Mechanical and Mechatronic Engineering)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2007. Vibrating a tillage tool is an {{effective}} way of reducing the draft force required to pull it through the soil. The <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>draft</b> force reduction {{is dependent on the}} combination of operating parameters and soil conditions. It is thus necessary to optimize the vibratory implement for different conditions. Numerical modelling is more flexible than experimental testing and analytical models, and less costly than experimental testing. The Discrete Element Method (DEM) was specifically developed for granular materials such as soils and can be used to model a vibrating tillage tool for its design and optimization. The goal was thus to evaluate the ability of DEM to model a vibratory subsoiler and to investigate the cause of the draft force reduction. The DEM model was evaluated against data obtained from field testing done with a full scale single tine vibratory subsoiler. Soil testing was also done for material characterization and for the calibration of DEM material properties. The subsoiler was simulated using a commercial code, PFC 3 D. The effect on the simulation results of particle diameter, different bonding models and damping models was investigated. The final simulations were evaluated against the experimental results in terms of the draft force and material behaviour. The cause of the draft force reduction due to vibration was also investigated with the aid of the DEM model. From the results it was concluded that DEM is able to model the vibratory subsoiler for its design and optimization. The DEM model also provided valuable insight into the cause of the draft force reduction such as the increased peak stresses due to vibration and the increase in particle kinetic energy...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1957 This study deals {{primarily}} with the evaluation and {{improvement of the}} content <b>of</b> a college-level <b>drafting</b> course for air conditioning engineering students. The necessity for better integration of the mechanical and architectural elements contained in the course, and an adequate coverage <b>of</b> field <b>drafting</b> room practices were the chief evidences {{of the need for}} the study. The {{purpose of this study was}} to develop criteria that could be used to evaluate and improve said drafting course; and the end result was manifested by an improved proposed drafting course, which was included in the Appendix. The study was conducted in the Los Angeles Metropolitan Area. Eighteen carefully selected air conditioning and refrigeration firms were interviewed to determine the per cent frequency of occurrence <b>of</b> selected field <b>drafting</b> room practices. This group represented contracting firms, consulting engineering offices, controls companies, and manufacturing firms. Chapter II presents a brief history of the development of the air conditioning and refrigeration industry. Special attention was given to the contemporary applications and to the need for specialized training on a college level. The collected field data was tabulated, analyzed and classified in Chapter III. This field data represented percent frequency of occurrence responses concerning drafting room practices covering the following nine general areas: (1) floor plans; (2) duct work; (3) piping drawings; (4) controls; (5) equipment rooms; (6) manufacturing; (7) sketching; (8) drafting techniques; and (9) drafting material. Five orders of classification were established: (1) standard practices; (2) common practices; (3) occasional practices; (4) infrequent practices; and (5) obsolete practices. Chapter IV contains the summary, conclusions and recommendations. The conclusions reached the were as follows: (1) ranked practices can be used as an evaluative instrument; (2) greater weight should be given to standard end common field and area practices; (3) many occasional and infrequent practices are essential practices in the individual firms concerned; (4) practices with broad general concepts should be used as instructional vehicles; (5) a <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> standardization <b>of</b> <b>drafting</b> practices has taken place; (6) a few of the practices have become obsolete; (7) the comprehension of control circuits is beyond most freshmen; (8) there is a trend toward more manufacturing in the area investigated; and (9) sketching ability is highly desirable. It was recommended that the course should be so organized as to bring about the following general outcomes: An understanding of and the ability to apply basic drafting techniques and practices as defined by the A. S. A., and also of those common to the selected field. The following specific recommendations were also made: (1) floor plans drawn, using conventional architectural symbols; (2) two-line duct systems drawn, using field techniques; (3) lettering style should progress from formal to a modified style; (4) piping systems drawn in isometric and orthographic, using a single-line diagrammatic form; (5) no control system; (6) equipment rooms drawn with "blocked" equipment shown; (7) manufacturing drawings developed; (8) improvement of sketching ability; (9) maintenance <b>of</b> the highest <b>drafting</b> standards; (10) use <b>of</b> <b>drafting</b> equipment common to the field; and (11) the inclusion of some sheet metal pattern development...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} my thesis, bearing the title "The {{principle}} <b>of</b> <b>draft</b> rigorousness (rigor cambii) in {{the perspective of}} Czech substantive and procedural law", is to analyze the term <b>of</b> <b>draft</b> rigorousness {{as well as to}} consider its influence on chosen institutes <b>of</b> the <b>draft</b> law. The reason to choose such topic for my thesis is my deep interest in this area of law, thanks to its precise regulation and rich history of evolvement <b>of</b> individual <b>draft</b> institutes. The paper is divided into five parts, where the introductory part is followed by three major chapters and the conclusion. The first of the chapters is called The Draft rigorousness, the second The Term <b>of</b> <b>draft</b> rigorousness and the third The Individual categories <b>of</b> <b>draft</b> rigorousness. The first chapter briefly outlines the characteristics <b>of</b> <b>draft</b> law as such with reference to the rigorousness <b>of</b> <b>draft</b> law in comparison to the general legal regulation. Furthermore it provides a comparison of the continental and Anglo-Saxon draft law in terms of formality and rigorousness of the regulation. The second chapter of my thesis focuses on the term <b>of</b> <b>draft</b> rigorousness itself and attempts to define its substantiality. The issue studied is whether to understand the term <b>of</b> <b>draft</b> rigorousness only as an attribute <b>of</b> the <b>draft</b> regulation, or if it should [...] ...|$|R

30|$|In this article, {{the dynamic}} {{behaviour}} <b>of</b> <b>draft</b> pad and draft gear is investigated using finite element method. The <b>draft</b> gear consists <b>of</b> six <b>draft</b> pads which are assembled in series (one above another) and are always under a constant axial compressive prestress in unloaded condition. Prestress influences {{the values of}} the stiffness matrix by causing stress stiffening and affects the response frequencies of the system thus impacting its modal responses [9]. The <b>draft</b> pad consists <b>of</b> a rubber compound/elastomer along with two steel plates. The modal behaviour <b>of</b> <b>draft</b> pad and draft gear assumes significance as it is necessary to identify frequencies at which fatigue failure <b>of</b> <b>draft</b> pads can occur. The vibration characteristics <b>of</b> the <b>draft</b> pad and the draft gear for the first 15 modes have been determined using finite element method. The vibration excitation <b>of</b> an individual <b>draft</b> pad has been compared with the dynamics <b>of</b> <b>draft</b> pads in the draft gear for identifying various frequencies for a given mode shape.|$|R

Utilization <b>of</b> <b>draft</b> sensor as a source for draft force sensing in lower arms is intended and examined. Research was focused on loading <b>of</b> <b>draft</b> sensor in different directions for proper screening of voltage output. Special loading device was designed and used with respect of real mounting conditions and force loading identically to bearing pins of tractor hitch lower arms. With usage of calibrated load cell and National instrument sensing control unit stage loading diagram <b>of</b> <b>draft</b> sensor was obtained. Results show basic feedback of voltage output on force load angle variation. In non-load condition, voltage output fluctuates around 5 V. In the main direction <b>of</b> <b>draft</b> force application voltage drop occurs from 5 V up to 3. 16 V. Reverse direction of loading brings the voltage output increment from 5 V up to 7. 06 V. When the load is applied with angular inclination voltage output changes are diminished up to 90 ° and draft sensor shows voltage output symmetry against the main axis. Based on stage loading diagram the appropriateness <b>of</b> <b>draft</b> sensor usage in design of universal three point hitch dynamometer is discussed in paper summary.
