40|$|Abstract Background Despite the {{morphological}} alterations of {{the deep}} fascia subjected to leg lengthening have been investigated in cellular and extracellular aspects, the impact of leg lengthening on viscoelastic properties {{of the deep}} fascia remains largely unknown. This study aimed to address the changes of viscoelastic properties of the deep fascia during leg lengthening using uniaxial tensile test. Methods Animal model of leg lengthening was established in New Zealand white rabbits. Distraction was initiated {{at a rate of}} 1 mm/day and 2 mm/day in two steps, and preceded until increases of 10 % and 20 % in the initial length of tibia had been achieved. The deep fascia specimens of 30 mm × 10 mm were clamped with the <b>Instron</b> 1122 <b>tensile</b> <b>tester</b> at room temperature with a constant tensile rate of 5 mm/min. After 5 load-download tensile tests had been performed, the specimens were elongated until rupture. The load-displacement curves were automatically generated. Results The normal deep fascia showed typical viscoelastic rule of collagenous tissues. Each experimental group of the deep fascia after leg lengthening kept the properties. The curves of the deep fascia at a rate of 1 mm/day with 20 % increase in tibia length were the closest to those of normal deep fascia. The ultimate tension strength and the strain at rupture on average of normal deep fascia were 2. 69 N (8. 97 mN/mm 2) and 14. 11 %, respectively. The increases in ultimate tension strength and strain at rupture of the deep fascia after leg lengthening were statistically significant. Conclusion The deep fascia subjected to leg lengthening exhibits viscoelastic properties as collagenous tissues without lengthening other than increased strain and strength. Notwithstanding different lengthening schemes result in varied viscoelastic properties changes, the most comparable viscoelastic properties to be demonstrated are under the scheme of a distraction rate of 1 mm/day and 20 % increase in tibia length. </p...|$|R

40|$|Stretchability {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} functional properties of Mozzarella cheese, but no objective and widely accepted technique exists for evaluation; most of the cheese stretchability tests are influenced by the ambient conditions. This paper demonstrates a technique, which is novel and relatively simple, to evaluate the stretchability of Mozzarella cheese objectively. In an oil bath, melted cheese is stretched by a hook probe, controlled by an <b>Instron</b> <b>tensile</b> <b>tester</b> (Instron Corp., Norwood, MA); cheese strands are lifted from the melted cheese reservoir to a stretch length of 300 mm, when the load and extension data are recorded by the <b>Instron</b> <b>tensile</b> <b>tester.</b> This test overcomes other tests' drawbacks, such as subjective stretching speeds and variations in ambient temperature and humidity. Through the test comparison on standard Mozzarella, the modified stretching test in an oil bath has greater repeatability than the original test without oil bath. From the load and extension curve, the yield load is measured to evaluate the stretchability. In the meantime, the inversion point extension of necking is also measured based on polymer study, producing more repeatable results than the yield load. The modified 3 -prong hook test was applied to Mozzarella cheese samples with different processing conditions, including the screw conditions (screw time, speed, and temperature), draining pH, calcium content, and fat content, and significant differences were found between these samples and the control sample...|$|E

The compressive behavior of knitted elastic fabric affects the excellence in comfort. This study aimed to investigate the comfort of knitted elastic fabric based on compressive load. For this purpose, fabrics were produced with three different stitch densities (loop sizes), and compressive load tests were applied at three various penetration depths. According to these parameters, 9 fabric samples were prepared. Each sample was tested 30 times; therefore, the total number of examined cases was 270. The compressive load was measured using special designed tools, which were installed on the <b>Instron</b> <b>tensile</b> <b>tester.</b> The effects of penetration depth and loop size on compressive load were evaluated by using the CCD statistical model with four repeats of each experiment.

Moreover, the performance of fuzzy logic model is compared with that of the artificial neural network (ANN) model. The needle penetration force was measured on the <b>Instron</b> <b>tensile</b> <b>tester.</b> In order to plan the fuzzy logic model, the sewing needle size, number of fabric layers and fabric weight were taken into account as input parameters. The output parameter is needle penetration force. In addition, the same parameters and data are used in artificial neural network model. The results indicate that the needle penetration force can be predicted in terms of sewing parameters by using the fuzzy logic model. The difference between performance of fuzzy logic and neural network models is not meaningful (RFL= 0. 971 and RANN= 0. 982).
