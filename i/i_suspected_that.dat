25|$|<b>I</b> <b>suspected</b> <b>that</b> {{even the}} Australian administrators were praying for {{rain and the}} delaying of the final outcome of a series that was proving a {{financial}} bonanza. A draw in Sydney would do wonders for the Adelaide gate and takings; whereas an Australian win and {{the resolution of the}} rubber might cause a loss of interest in the remaining Tests.|$|E
500|$|Hopkins {{was asked}} in an {{interview}} on the subject of whether or not he believed the idea of Starling and Lecter heading off into the sunset as lovers (as happens in the book). [...] "Yes, I did. Other people found that preposterous. I suppose there's a moral issue there. I {{think it would have been}} a very interesting thing though. I think it would have been very interesting had she gone off, because <b>I</b> <b>suspected</b> <b>that</b> there was that romance, attachment there, that obsession with her. I guessed that a long time ago, at the last phone call to Clarice, at the end of SotL, she said, 'Dr. Lecter, Dr. Lecter...'." ...|$|E
500|$|The British premiere at the 1988 Edinburgh Festival brought {{critical}} praise: [...] "Through its sheer cleverness, wit, lyrical {{beauty and}} sense of theater, it sweeps aside most of the criticism to which it lays itself open." [...] When the work was finally performed in London, 13 years after its Houston premiere and after {{a long period of}} theatrical neglect, Tempos critic Robert Stein responded to ENO's 2000 production enthusiastically. He particularly praised the performance of Maddalena, and concluded that [...] "Adams's triumph... consists really in taking a plot chock-full of talk and public gesture, and through musical characterisation... making a satisfying and engaging piece." [...] Of the ENO revival in 2006, Erica Jeal of The Guardian wrote that [...] "from its early visual coup {{with the arrival of the}} plane, Sellars' production is an all-too-welcome reminder of his best form". In Jeal's view, the cast met admirably the challenge of presenting the work in a non-satirical spirit. Reviewing the 2008 Portland Opera production (the basis of the 2011 Canadian Opera Company presentation in Toronto), critic Patrick J. Smith concluded that [...] "Nixon in China is a great American Opera. <b>I</b> <b>suspected</b> <b>that</b> it was a significant work when I saw it in 1987; I was ever more convinced of its stature when I heard it subsequently, on stage and on disc, and today I am certain that it is one of the small handful of operas that will survive." ...|$|E
5000|$|Although {{proof is}} lacking, from the {{descriptions}} given <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>that</b> Straumsfjord is a fjord in Maine.|$|R
6000|$|... "Would you not, Barney? <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> should be, a little, {{under the}} circumstances; perhaps the old Nigger {{would be more}} so." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hardly," [...] replied Doctor Gray, [...] "if it be true, as <b>I</b> <b>suspect,</b> <b>that</b> {{both the}} father and {{daughter}} are of the Jewish persuasion." ...|$|R
2500|$|... "As {{early as}} 1945 Paul Stern pointed out Fritzi Gordon to me, saying 'There is the partner for you.' I was not enthusiastic. For one thing, I {{already had a}} more than {{satisfactory}} partner in Doris Rhodes, a good friend, and for another <b>I</b> <b>suspected</b> <b>that</b> Mrs. Gordon and I would not hit it off socially, whatever we did at the table. My opinion did not change when she played at the Hamilton Club and I got to know her better. [...] as far as bridge is concerned, I have not a word of complaint about Fritzi Gordon, for she was a wonderful player and an excellent partner, who contributed greatly to my own success." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Godric came as mysteriously {{alive for}} me as Bebb had and, with him, all the people he knew and the whole medieval world he lived in. I had Godric narrate his own life, and despite the problem of {{developing}} a language that sounded authentic on his lips without becoming impenetrably archaic, and despite the difficulties of trying to recapture {{a time and place}} so unlike my own, the book, like Lion Country before it, came so quickly and with such comparative ease that there were times when <b>I</b> <b>suspected</b> <b>that</b> maybe the old saint himself was not entirely uninvolved in the process, as, were I a saint and were somebody writing a book about me, I would not be entirely uninvolved in the process either." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>suspected</b> <b>that</b> his acres {{were not}} as broad, nor his produce as salable, as those of Mount Vernon.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will tell}} you, brute beast," [...] he {{answered}} me. [...] "I question you because <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>that</b> you are hiding something from me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm sorry {{enough for}} her; but <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>that,</b> so far, {{you have been}} the {{principal}} sufferer. She's simply accepted the fact, and survived it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "In {{the cause}} of science!" [...] {{repeated}} Peterkin; [...] "humph! <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>that</b> {{a good deal of}} wickedness is perpetrated under the wing of science." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She is, though. These women can't fool me. I {{told you}} days ago <b>I</b> <b>suspected</b> <b>that.</b> Now I'll gamble on it. And {{you know how}} I play my cards." ...|$|E
6000|$|Algernon. <b>I</b> <b>suspected</b> <b>that,</b> my dear fellow! I have Bunburyed {{all over}} Shropshire on two {{separate}} occasions. Now, go on. Why are you Ernest {{in town and}} Jack in the country? ...|$|E
6000|$|... “I had a {{suspicion}} that you didn’t want to know. You’re a fastidious fellow, you know, and <b>I</b> <b>suspected</b> <b>that</b> you’d rather leave a mean job {{of that kind}} to me.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{would give}} {{something}} to know that," [...] replied the philosopher, musingly; [...] "but <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>that</b> {{in most cases}} the inflammation remains, and is intensified." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{believe they}} have the habit of wine at table. <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>that</b> when they don't drink tea and coffee with their dinner, they drink ice-water." ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>that</b> {{those who}} have read some of my other works {{will be a little}} {{surprised}} by this one. I am a little surprised by this one.|$|R
60|$|That {{evening after}} dinner Tom came in alone, and <b>I</b> <b>suspected</b> <b>that</b> Perry had sent him. He was fidgety, ill at ease, and {{presently}} asked if I {{could see him}} a moment in my study. Maude's glance followed us.|$|E
6000|$|... “Well,” said Mrs. Ruck, “I’m glad you’ve {{had some}} company.” Her husband looked at her, in silence, through narrowed eyelids, and <b>I</b> <b>suspected</b> <b>that</b> her unusually gracious {{observation}} {{was prompted by}} the less innocent aftertaste of her own late pastime.|$|E
6000|$|... "That you've been fooling me!" [...] {{the girl}} interrupted, {{a faint smile}} {{at the corners of}} her lips. [...] "Do you know, {{sometimes}} <b>I</b> <b>suspected</b> <b>that</b> you weren't in earnest! And then one day I saw your wife--and I wasn't sure!" ...|$|E
6000|$|Hip. Now, <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>that</b> love's {{the very}} thing, [...] That I feel too!--Pray tell me truly, sir, [...] Are you not grown unquiet since you saw her? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; staunch ones. They {{showed their}} {{friendship}} {{in a very}} practical way. That's something I owe to you; <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>that</b> you have been prejudicing them in my favor." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “It {{sounds a}} drastic rule. The {{trouble is that}} my {{relatives}} and friends expect too much of me, and <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>that</b> {{some of them are}} pulling opposite ways.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Mrs. Ruck, [...] "I'm glad you've {{had some}} company." [...] Her husband looked at her, in silence, through narrowed eyelids, and <b>I</b> <b>suspected</b> <b>that</b> this gracious {{observation}} on the lady's part {{was prompted by}} a restless conscience.|$|E
6000|$|Then he {{took this}} {{opportunity}} of consulting {{me on the}} chances for Frith, telling of the original offer, and the quiet constancy of his friend, and asking whether I thought Emily would relent. And I answered that <b>I</b> <b>suspected</b> <b>that</b> she would,--'But you must get well first.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You have keen eyes," [...] said Maxwell. [...] "The {{taxidermist}} did {{his best}} to hide it. That hole was made when I first pitted myself against the leopard by shooting one to convince my carriers the thing was mortal. For some time <b>I</b> <b>suspected</b> <b>that</b> {{was the beginning of a}} duel." ...|$|E
6000|$|MR. RICHARDS: [...] "Well, I won't, then. But do {{you know}} what <b>I</b> <b>suspect,</b> Lucy? <b>I</b> wouldn't mention it to everybody, but I will to you--in strict confidence: <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>that</b> you're rather ashamed of your grievance, if you have any. <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> it's nothing at all." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "As to the {{pretension}} {{of civilized}} persons to admire gems or gold for their intrinsic beauty {{apart from their}} value, <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>that</b> was {{a more or less}} unconscious sham." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>that</b> {{this was}} the same place the gardener's son deceived the Lady of Lyons with, but I do not know. You may have heard of the passage somewhere: ...|$|R
60|$|Peter spoke rather squiffily. <b>I</b> <b>suspected</b> <b>that</b> he {{had been}} one of the smitten swains himself. I looked at the photo for a few minutes longer, admiring it more every minute and, when I heard Peter coming out, I did an unjustifiable thing--I took that photo and put it in my pocket.|$|E
6000|$|... "'Indeed,' I answered; {{and then}} as in duty bound I {{proceeded}} to get what I could out of him, {{and that was not}} a little. Of course, however, I did not swallow it all, since that <b>I</b> <b>suspected</b> <b>that</b> Magepa was feeding me with news that he had been ordered to disseminate.|$|E
6000|$|Osmond {{took a sip}} of a {{glass of}} wine; he looked {{perfectly}} good-humoured. [...] "My dear Amy," [...] he answered, smiling as if he were uttering a piece of gallantry, [...] "I don't know anything about your convictions, but if <b>I</b> <b>suspected</b> <b>that</b> they interfere with mine it would be much simpler to banish YOU." ...|$|E
60|$|TANNER. Well, {{perhaps it}} saves unpleasantness to say so. But for my part, <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>that</b> the tables of {{consanguinity}} {{have a natural}} basis in a natural repugnance [he rises].|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know; but <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>that</b> in his meek way Conrad {{would say}} what he {{believed}} to anybody. I suppose we must regard him {{as a kind of}} crank." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I {{doubt whether}} Mrs. Maybough {{wrote to me}} of her own inspiration, entirely. <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>that</b> Wetmore and Plaisdell have been working the affair, and I don't like that." ...|$|R
