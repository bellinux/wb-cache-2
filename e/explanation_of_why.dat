5|$|The {{occurrence}} of these closures {{and the change}} in traditions is the simplest <b>explanation</b> <b>of</b> <b>why</b> many musicians were out of work, and why their style of music had declined before the Buena Vista Social Club made it popular again.|$|E
5|$|In June 1873, Lee left Dublin for London {{and never}} returned. A {{fortnight}} later, Bessie followed him; {{the two girls}} joined her. Shaw's <b>explanation</b> <b>of</b> <b>why</b> his mother followed Lee was that without the latter's financial contribution the joint household had to be broken up. Left in Dublin with his father, Shaw compensated {{for the absence of}} music in the house by teaching himself to play the piano.|$|E
5|$|Cecil {{was drawn}} to {{resemble}} David Hyde Pierce, but still look similar to Bob. According to director Pete Michels, {{it was difficult to}} draw Bob and Cecil standing together because their feet are both so big. There was a scene featuring Hans Moleman and his house, which was cut, but his house can still briefly be seen in the scene where Cecil throws Bart off a cliff. The sequence was cut in order {{to make room for the}} <b>explanation</b> <b>of</b> <b>why</b> Bob was sent back to prison. Ken Keeler has said that it is his favorite deleted scene.|$|E

5|$|Yet it {{also seems}} to many that science will {{eventually}} have to explain such experiences. This follows from an assumption {{about the possibility of}} reductive explanations. According to this view, if an attempt can be successfully made to explain a phenomenon reductively (e.g., water), then it can be explained why the phenomenon has all of its properties (e.g., fluidity, transparency). In the case of mental states, this means {{that there needs to be}} an <b>explanation</b> <b>of</b> <b>why</b> they have the property of being experienced in a certain way.|$|E
25|$|Although {{there are}} {{limitations}} {{in the research}} studies conducted in this area, namely that most have focused primarily on schizophrenia, this theory provides an <b>explanation</b> <b>of</b> <b>why</b> relatively low levels of substance misuse often result in negative consequences for individuals with severe mental illness.|$|E
25|$|In September 2010, PayPal froze {{the account}} of Markus Persson, {{developer}} of independent video game Minecraft.

40|$|This article {{summarizes}} {{and extends}} recent results linking deterministic parsing to observed "locality principles" in syntax.

5000|$|There {{have been}} various <b>explanations</b> <b>of</b> <b>why</b> the Vietnamese, unlike all other {{countries}} who follow the Sino lunar calendar, have the cat instead of the Rabbit as a zodiac animal. One {{explanation is that the}} ancient word for Rabbit (Mao) sounds like cat (Meo).|$|R
25|$|The {{other source}} of power is rank. People of good blood aspire to a title, while people with titles aspire to the peerage.

25|$|When first {{interviewed by}} reporters, Margarita Castillo refused {{to show her}} face but spoke through a closed door. She gave her <b>explanation</b> <b>of</b> <b>why</b> Anjelica was not {{reported}} missing and also described her devastation when she learned of the fate of Anjelica, and her anger toward Juarez. She was subjected to criticism throughout the community for not reporting anything about Anjelica's disappearance.|$|E
25|$|Each of the 50 {{states of}} the United States has passed some form of freedom of {{information}} legislation, which provides a mechanism {{for the general public}} to request information of the government.

25|$|A {{paper in}} Science found that Culex pipiens {{mosquitoes}} existed in two populations in Europe, one which bites birds {{and one which}} bites humans. In North America 40% of Culex pipiens {{were found to be}} hybrids of the two types which bite both birds and humans, providing a vector for West Nile virus.

25|$|Isaac Newton's {{theory of}} {{gravitation}} first enabled an <b>explanation</b> <b>of</b> <b>why</b> there were generally two tides a day, not one, and offered {{hope for a}} detailed understanding of tidal forces and behavior. Although it may seem that tides could be predicted via a sufficiently detailed knowledge of instantaneous astronomical forcings, the actual tide at a given location is determined by astronomical forces accumulated over many days. In addition, precise results require detailed knowledge of the shape of all the ocean basins—their bathymetry, and coastline shape.|$|E
25|$|Habib {{claims he}} became disaffected with Australia, and {{traveled}} to Pakistan and Afghanistan in 2001 {{to find an}} Islamic school to educate his children. When questioned on national television on his return to Australia in 2005, he could offer no <b>explanation</b> <b>of</b> <b>why</b> he had not just allowed his children to attend any number of highly regarded Islamic schools near where he resided, nor why he would be 'disaffected' with a country that provided him with generous social benefits and security for his family when compared to Pakistan and Afghanistan.|$|E
25|$|The unnamed {{narrator is}} brought to trial before {{sinister}} judges of the Spanish Inquisition. Poe provides no <b>explanation</b> <b>of</b> <b>why</b> he is there or of the charges on which he is being tried. Before him are seven tall white candles on a table, and, as they burn down, his hopes of survival also diminish. He is condemned to death, whereupon he faints and later awakens to find himself in a totally dark room. At first the prisoner thinks that he is locked in a tomb, but then he discovers {{that he is in}} a cell. He decides to explore the cell by placing a scrap of his robe against the wall so that he can count the paces around the room, but he faints before he can measure the whole perimeter.|$|E

50|$|Many {{species have}} {{multiple}} sexual ornaments, whereby females select mating partners using several cues instead {{of only one}} cue.

25|$|In July 1994, MacInnis {{organized}} and led six publicly funded dives to the SS Edmund Fitzgerald over a three-day period. Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institution provided the Edwin A. Link as the support vessel, and their manned submersible, the Celia. The Great Lakes Shipwreck Historical Society (GLSHS) paid $10,000 {{for three of}} its members to each join a dive and take still pictures. MacInnis concluded that the notes and video obtained during the dives did not provide an <b>explanation</b> <b>of</b> <b>why</b> the Fitzgerald sank. MacInnis helped organize another series of dives in July 1995 to salvage the bell from the Fitzgerald. Canadian engineer Phil Nuytten's atmospheric diving suit, the Newtsuit, was used to retrieve the bell from the ship, {{replace it with a}} replica, and put a beer can in the Fitzgeralds pilothouse. At MacInnis' suggestion, the replica bell was inscribed with the names of the Fitzgeralds crew.|$|E
25|$|Ondine {{is not a}} {{classical}} construction with great set pieces (except for the wedding divertissement in the third act) or grand formal pas de deux, but a continuous, flowing narrative. However, this narrative is itself not very strong {{and there is no}} real <b>explanation</b> <b>of</b> <b>why</b> the lovers are on a ship in Act 2, or what exactly has passed between Acts 2 and 3 to convince Palemon to return to his mortal lover, Beatrice (Berta). The work uses classical ballet vocabulary, but the form varies a great deal from the 19th century classics. Unlike them, is through-composed: there are no breaks for bows to the audience built in and (at least until the third-act divertissement) no bravura variations to self-consciously elicit the audience's response. Henze's glittering music is the dominating force, although it is a difficult score to dance to, with the pulse well hidden within its general sheen, but it is atmospheric and often exciting, bringing the close of Act I to a climax.|$|E
25|$|Pliny and {{his party}} saw flames coming from several parts of the mountain, which Pliny and his friends {{attributed}} to burning villages. After staying overnight, the party was driven from the building by an accumulation of material which threatened to block all egress. They woke Pliny, who had been napping and emitting loud snoring. They elected {{to take to the}} fields with pillows tied to their heads to protect them from rockfall. They approached the beach again but the wind had not changed. Pliny sat down on a sail that had been spread for him and could not rise even with assistance when his friends departed, escaping ultimately by land. Very likely, he had collapsed and died, which is the most popular <b>explanation</b> <b>of</b> <b>why</b> his friends abandoned him, although Suetonius offers an alternative story of his ordering a slave to kill him to avoid the pain of incineration. How the slave would have escaped to tell the tale remains a mystery. There is no mention of such an event in his nephew's letters.|$|E
