These angles are usually measured using probes that protrude from the vehicle surface out into the ow eld. However, this arrangement {{was found to be}} unacceptable for modern unmanned airplanes whenever stealthiness features are required. In addition, redundant sensor arrangements, when dictated by safety regulations, were also critical because of the possible heavy impact on the airframe of small UAVs. New virtual software-based systems were therefore developed in order to nd a viable solution for reducing the number of traditional hardware-based air data sensors, and they oered the benet of simplifying air data system architectures. The aerodynamic angles were derived from inertial data and by exploiting the airspeed sourced by the Pitot-static system. The relationship between these parameters and the aerodynamic angles was a complex, non-linear function that was not easily described by means of aircraft models.

The three main experiments for observation are the Hopkins Ultraviolet Telescope (HUT), the Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (UIT), and the Wisconsin Ultraviolet Photo-Polarimetry Experiment (WUPPE). The HUT uses spectroscopy to obtain the structure and chemical makeup of ultraviolet targets. UIT is responsible for wide field photographing to capture the hidden view of the ultraviolet universe. The WUPPE gathers data on the polarization of the ultraviolet electromagnetic energy coming from the astronomical targets. The capability of IPS enables the experiments to 'see' faint celestial objects.

Many embedded applications perform computationally intensive tasks such as processing streaming video or audio, wireless communication, or speech recognition and must be implemented within tight power budgets.
