40|$|The Australian Child Support Scheme was {{established}} {{as a means of}} ensuring adequate financial support for children of separated parents. However, within the financial transfer of child support exist notions of &# 039;trust&# 039; and &# 039;fairness&# 039; based on parents navigating their changed relationship post-separation. Previous research has explored the assessment and outcomes of child support for both payee and payer parents, however little attention has been given to how women evaluate the assessment and outcomes of child support. As such, this research aimed to explore payee mothers&# 039; evaluation of their child support experiences based on the value of their child support assessment {{and the extent to which}} these payments were received. Following the methods of constructivist grounded theory, in-depth interviews were conducted with 20 low-income single mothers. Analysis revealed that payee mothers evaluated child support based on the moral assumptions and the rationalities they perceived were underlying payer fathers&# 039; child support compliance. While payee mothers desired arrangements that reflected <b>joint</b> parental <b>financial</b> <b>responsibility,</b> in reality many experienced problematic child support payments, which may ultimately undermine payee parents&# 039; confidence in the Child Support Scheme...|$|R
5000|$|This led Massachusetts and Connecticut {{to create}} the first <b>financial</b> <b>responsibility</b> and {{compulsory}} insurance laws. Connecticut's 1925 <b>financial</b> <b>responsibility</b> law required any vehicle owner involved in a collision with damages over $100 to prove [...] "financial responsibility to satisfy any claim for damages, by reason of personal injury, to, or death of, any person, of at least $10,000." [...] This early <b>financial</b> <b>responsibility</b> requirement only required vehicle owners to prove <b>financial</b> <b>responsibility</b> after their first collision. Massachusetts also introduced a law {{to address the problem}} of collisions, but theirs was a compulsory insurance, not <b>financial</b> <b>responsibility</b> law. It required automotive liability insurance as a prerequisite to vehicle registration.|$|R

40|$|<b>Financial</b> <b>responsibility</b> {{rules are}} an {{increasingly}} {{common form of}} environmental regulation. Currently, the operators of landfills, underground petroleum storage tanks, offshore rigs, and oil tankers must demonstrate the existence of adequate levels of capital as a precondition to the legal operation of their businesses. Environmental <b>financial</b> <b>responsibility</b> ensures that firms possess the resources to compensate society for pollution costs created {{in the course of}} business operations. In addition to providing a source of funds for victim compensation and pollution remediation, <b>financial</b> <b>responsibility</b> is thought to motivate better decision-making, particularly regarding the management of long-term risks.

40|$|<b>FINANCIAL</b> <b>RESPONSIBILITY</b> EVIDENCE. REPEAL OF LAW. INITIATIVE STATUTE. This {{initiative}} repeals the 2 ̆ 2 ROBBINS MC ALISTER <b>FINANCIAL</b> <b>RESPONSIBILITY</b> ACT. 2 ̆ 2 The Robbins-McAlister <b>Financial</b> <b>Responsibility</b> Act requires each {{motor vehicle}} driver to have, and under specified conditions produce, evidence of <b>financial</b> <b>responsibility</b> for the vehicle, meaning proof of liability insurance, a surety bond, self insurance or other specified means of <b>financial</b> <b>responsibility,</b> meeting certain requirements. The act also contains other provisions. This initiative declares automobile insurance {{is to be}} no longer mandatory and that a person 2 ̆ 7 s drivers license shall never be suspended for any cause except unsafe driving. Summary of estimate by Legislative Analyst and Director of Finance of fiscal impact on state and local governments: Annual gross insurance premium tax revenues could be reduced by about 2 million. This fiscal effect may vary significantly, up or down, depending {{on the cost of}} insurance coverage for <b>financial</b> <b>responsibility</b> and motorists 2 ̆ 7 reaction to the repeal. Department of Motor Vehicles would have a net revenue loss of about 1 million, accruing to the State Transportation Fund 2 ̆ 7 s Motor Vehicle Account. Medi-Cal costs could increase by an unknown amount because of medical costs for eligible persons injured in accidents by uninsured motorists. Municipal courts would probably experience reduction in administrative costs, with a corresponding reduction in penalty and assessment revenues...|$|R

25|$|In 1941, {{only about}} a quarter of U.S. drivers had auto {{liability}} insurance. This led to the state of New York passing a law which established the <b>financial</b> <b>responsibility</b> of drivers for damage or injuries resulting from auto mishaps. That law inspired legislation in other states, and by the mid-1950s nearly every state had some sort of <b>financial</b> <b>responsibility</b> law on its books.|$|R
50|$|Before the Oil Pollution was enacted, {{offshore}} {{facilities were}} required to provide evidence that declared <b>financial</b> <b>responsibility</b> of $35 million. After OPA, these offshore facilities had to increase their proof of <b>financial</b> <b>responsibility</b> by 4 times and OPA's requirement of <b>financial</b> <b>responsibility</b> expanded to include facilities in state waters as well. Facilities in state waters that {{are subject to the}} $150 million requirement includes pipelines, marina fuel docks, tanks, and oil production facilities that are located in, on, or under state coastal waters, and are adjacent to inland channels, lakes, and wetlands. The most evident impact of the enactment of OPA, is on the oil producers within the Gulf of Mexico. Many offshore facilities are located in the Gulf of Mexico and in the marshes and wetlands of Louisiana. Major producers are most likely able to meet OPA's requirement of <b>financial</b> <b>responsibility,</b> however, the major oil companies within the Gulf of Mexico have exponentially withdrawled the operation of their offshore facilities.|$|R
