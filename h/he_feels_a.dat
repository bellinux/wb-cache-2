25|$|Eno {{revealed}} {{on radio}} in May 2009 that a skin graft he received as {{treatment for a}} severe burn on his arm was part human skin, part carbon fibre. He explained that as human skin is based on carbon, the experimental treatment was likely {{going to work out}} well for him, {{in spite of the fact}} that <b>he</b> <b>feels</b> <b>a</b> lightness in the affected arm.|$|E
25|$|Wolverine's {{mutation}} also {{consists of}} animal-like adaptations of his body, including pronounced, and sharp fang-like canines and three retractable claws housed within each forearm. While originally depicted as bionic implants {{created by the}} Weapon X program, the claws are later revealed to be {{a natural part of}} his body. The claws are not made of keratin, as claws tend to be in the animal kingdom, but extremely dense bone. Wolverine's hands do not have openings for the claws to move through: they cut through his flesh every time he extrudes them, with occasional references implying that <b>he</b> <b>feels</b> <b>a</b> brief moment of slight pain in his hands when he unsheathes them.During a talk to Jubilee, Wolverine reveals that there are channels inside his forearms through which the claws move when he extrudes them, and that he unsheathes the claws a few times a day to keep the channels open, similar to pierced ears.|$|E
25|$|Reverend William Thorne (Brandon Firla) — Rev. Magee's replacement, {{feels it}} is his {{religious}} duty to compete with Amaar for {{the souls of the}} residents of Mercy. At first, he uses Amaar's forgiving nature to build his congregation and eventually kicks the mosque out, but brings them back because the Archdeacon likes having a mosque in the church to show cultural diversity. It is revealed <b>he</b> <b>feels</b> <b>a</b> great shame over being adopted and dislikes his older brother. Thorne eventually takes Amaar's help in becoming a better person and begins trying to convince Amaar to be his friend. He is jealous of Rev. Magee when he returns to be Amaar's best man because Amaar clearly prefers the old reverend. Thorne shows some weakness when it is revealed that he has a crush on Rose, the town librarian, but is too shy to ask her out. With the help of Rayyan and Amaar, the two begin dating.|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{was very}} well indeed--at least the impulse was--whether the act was {{strictly}} defensible or not. Had deceased any religious convictions? That is to say, did <b>he</b> <b>feel</b> <b>a</b> dependence upon, or acknowledge allegiance to a higher power?" ...|$|R

500|$|<b>He</b> <b>feels</b> <b>a</b> dreamy {{quality in}} the best of Bates's writing, as when he meets a boa constrictor: [...] "On seeing me the reptile {{suddenly}} turned, and glided at an accelerated rate down the path. ...The rapidly moving and shining body looked like a stream of brown liquid flowing over the thick bed of fallen leaves." [...] However he is less impressed with Bates's remarks about the [...] "intellectual inferiority" [...] of the natives, and observes that Bates was wrong about the fertility of tropical soils, which are often poor: the luxuriant growth results from rapid recycling of nutrients. He celebrates the [...] "famous closing passage" [...] of the book, where Bates expresses his [...] "deep misgivings" [...] about returning to England, and writes that recent [...] "progress" [...] in the Amazon is just as shocking.|$|E
500|$|Raj Lyubov is the {{anthropologist}} in the colony, a scholar {{who holds the}} honorary rank of [...] "captain". He is depicted as being from an Indian heritage. Selver is initially a servant in the central camp; Lyubov enlists him as an assistant, and builds a relationship of trust with him. The two of them compile a dictionary of the Athshean and Terran languages. When Selver's wife Thele is raped and killed by Davidson, Selver attacks Davidson, who nearly kills him; Lyubov rescues Selver, and nurses him back to health. During {{the attack on the}} colony's headquarters, Selver tells the Athsheans to leave Lyubov's house alone, but Lyubov leaves his house and is killed by a collapsing building. As he dies, Lyubov warns Selver {{about the impact of the}} killings on the Athshean society. In comparison to Davidson, Lyubov reflects a lot upon his actions, and tries to analyze them in a detached manner. His contradictory position of being a colonial officer despite recognizing the damage that the colony is doing to the Athsheans gives him migraines. <b>He</b> <b>feels</b> <b>a</b> strong sense of guilt at the impacts of the colony, and is willing to destroy his own reputation in order to protect the Athshean people. He is one of the only Terrans to treat the Athsheans as human beings, although this loses him the respect of his fellow Terrans.|$|E
500|$|The Spectator, however, {{criticized the}} {{relationship}} of Presley's character with his love interests: [...] "The girls in his (Michael Curtiz's) latest film, King Creole, are both played by good, serious actresses: Carolyn Jones [...]. and Dolores Hart, ... both are shown to be hungrily, desperately, unpridefully {{in love with him}} (Presley's character). They have no existence, except in him; do nothing but wait for him; hope for nothing but a little rough affection ... Instead of being kissed, they beg for kisses, which Mr. Presley sulkily and reluctantly hands out now and then, with the air of a small, fastidious boy being press to eat marshmallow and, though <b>he</b> <b>feels</b> <b>a</b> bit sick not quite knowing {{how to get out of}} it ... (it) really seems to suggest this is a god come down among us for a spell; and when tender and infinitely patient in spite of the long past of infidelity, nonchalance, and what looks to an observer like plain indifference from him, her lips poised for the kiss that doesn't come ... As the most extreme example of a contemporary idol, Mr. Presley is pretty fascinating, and, though you may be put off at first by his pale, puffy, bruised looking babyish face, by the weary cherubic decadence you might imagine in Nero, and the excessive greasiness of his excessively long, spiky locks, his films, however bad (and King Creole is pretty low on his list), are well worth taking a look at." ...|$|E

2500|$|Michael {{is aware}} that all his {{attempts}} to visualize what Hanna might have been like back then, what happened, are colored by what he has read and seen in movies. <b>He</b> <b>feels</b> <b>a</b> difficult identification with the victims when he learns that Hanna often picked one prisoner to read to her, as she chose him later on, only to send that girl to Auschwitz and the gas chamber after several months. Did she do it to make {{the last months of}} the condemned more bearable? Or to keep her secret safe? Michael's inability to both condemn and understand springs from this. He asks himself and the reader: ...|$|E
50|$|John Kilduff claims his aim {{with the}} series is to make people of all skill levels try their hand at {{painting}} {{or other forms of}} creative self-expression. Kilduff frequently encourages viewers to use very large brushes in order to cover the canvas as quickly as possible before worrying about details, as <b>he</b> <b>feels</b> <b>an</b> empty canvas can be very intimidating to novices.|$|R
