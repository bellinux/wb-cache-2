Alpha may be seen to be quite complexly determined from this perspective. That is, alpha is sensitive not only to general factor saturation in a scale but also to <b>group</b> <b>factor</b> saturation and even to variance in the scale scores arising from variability in the factor loadings.

Similarly, adult victims who blame themselves and are ashamed of being victimized may wish to hide the experience from others, and thus be less willing to seek help.

At the first level, <b>grouping</b> <b>factors</b> are identified as direct bar-bar interaction and orientation interaction. Bar-bar interaction is shortranged and homogeneous. Orientation interaction is locally oriented and mediated by statistics of local visual context. At the second level, <b>grouping</b> <b>factors</b> are global geometric binding effects which arise from geometric redundancy reduction and thus are global effects. Based on them, we present an energy model. Then the extraction of linear features is generally formulated as combinatorial optimization. Since local, global interactions and local context effects all are included in it, the model may capture partially grouping ability of human vision systems. The experiments show that, without selecting any original points, our method can extract linear features from images robustly and quickly. ...|$|R

To do that, we will use the graph W ∗-probability technique to find the moments and cumulants of the identically distributed random variable T with T 0. This will be a good example of an application of Graph W ∗-Probability Theory. We also can see how we can construct the W ∗-subalgebra which is isomorphic to the free <b>group</b> <b>factor</b> L(FN) in the graph W ∗-probability space (W ∗ (G), E). In this paper, we will reformulate the moments and cumulants of the so-called generating operator T 0 = ∑ N j= 1 xj, where x 1, [...] ., xN are free semicircular elements generating the free <b>group</b> <b>factor</b> L(FN), in terms of the graph W ∗-probability theory considered in [14], [15], [16] and [17]. Voiculescu showed that the free <b>group</b> <b>factor</b> L(FN) is generated by N-semicircular elements which are free from each other (See [9]). The moments and cumulants of such elements are known but we will recompute them, by using the graph W ∗-probability technique. We will construct a DG-semicircular subalgebra SG which is isomorphic to the free <b>group</b> <b>factor</b> L(FN) embedded in a certain graph W ∗-algebra W ∗ (G). And, by constructing an operator T which is identically distributed with T 0 in SG, we will recompute the moments and cumulants of T 0.
