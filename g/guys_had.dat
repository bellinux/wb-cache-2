We were on a major label then, we just got signed, and those <b>guys</b> <b>had</b> blown up {{to where they were}} at and John needed to get out. John gets to our pad and we started getting ready to play and I said, ‘You want to use my tuner?’ He said, ‘No, I’ll bend it in.’ It was so far out. Then we jammed but it didn’t come to anything. Maybe he wasn’t in the right place and we were a tight little unit. It just didn’t quite happen but it could have worked." ...|$|E

500|$|Gillom {{signed with}} the Browns in early 1947, making him the third black player to join the team after Bill Willis and Motley. Before the season started, {{he played in the}} College All-Star Game, a now-defunct matchup between the National Football League (NFL) {{champion}} and a selection of the best college players from around the country. Gillom played well in the game as the All-Stars beat the Chicago Bears, 16–0. With the Browns, Gillom was used mostly as a punter and a defensive end. He came in second in the AAFC in punting average in his rookie season at 44.6 yards as Cleveland finished the regular season with a 12–1–1 record and beat the New York Yankees to win the AAFC championship. [...] "Gillom had such a powerful leg and kicked the ball so far; before that punters used to line up 10, 12 yards behind the center", running back Sherman Howard later said. [...] "He started the 15-yard drop. And with Horace, he would kick it so high that by the time guys got down, the ball was coming down, so most <b>guys</b> <b>had</b> to fair catch." ...|$|E

So I think the idea of people overcoming adversity by using their own resources was strongly imprinted in me by those books, because those <b>guys</b> <b>had</b> nothing except their own strength and their own mind power. There's something noble about that." ...|$|E

2500|$|Following {{the success}} of Bloody Kisses, Steele began to receive {{attention}} outside of music. He appeared as a nude centerfold of Playgirl in 1995. Steele later found out via bandmate Kenny Hickey's contacts that only 23% of the magazine subscribers were female, and after being asked by men to sign copies of the magazine, Steele somewhat regretted the decision: [...] "After I did it, I thought, 'Oh my God, what did I do?'. It was more than upsetting that so many <b>guys</b> <b>had</b> it. Girls, OK, but there just seemed {{to be at least}} as many guys. Not that I'm homophobic, but it was certainly irritating." [...] In a 2007 interview, Steele reflected on the posing as merely a naïve publicity stunt.|$|E

He said about this game: [...] "We {{then moved on to}} our second game against India, at Boland Bank Park. In all 236 was quite a decent score, as it wasn't the easiest of pitches to bat on, and Srinath I think bowled the quickest that any of our <b>guys</b> <b>had</b> ever seen. He bowled a really quick spell early on, even quicker than Allan Donald; he was timed at 157 km/h, a good 10 km/h faster than Donald was bowling throughout the tournament. Grant Flower was hit on the thigh pad, and when he came off he said he thought he had broken his leg". (See paragraph 7 of the article by clicking on the below link).|$|E

2500|$|The {{visual effects}} and {{backgrounds}} {{for the film}} were created digitally using Cintiq tablet displays. Marlon West, one of Disney's veteran animation visual effects supervisors, says about the production; [...] "Those <b>guys</b> <b>had</b> this bright idea to bring back hand-drawn animation, but everything had to be started again from the ground up. One {{of the first things}} we did was focus on producing shorts, to help us re-introduce the 2D pipeline. I worked as vfx supervisor on the Goofy short, How to Hook Up Your Home Theater. It was a real plus for the effects department, so we went paperless for The Princess and the Frog." [...] The backgrounds were painted digitally using Adobe Photoshop, and many of the architectural elements were based upon 3D models built in Autodesk Maya. Much of the clean-up animation, digital ink-and-paint, and compositing were outsourced to third-party companies in Orlando, Florida (Premise Entertainment), Toronto, Ontario, Canada (Yowza Digital Animation), and Brooklin, São Paulo, Brazil (HGN Produções) ...|$|E

[...] Mystic's Mark Wilkins, who handled promotion on their first national tour with Dr. Know told Wild Times [...] "I knew those <b>guys</b> <b>had</b> something special. In the middle of the tour Dr. Know's van broke down forcing them to quit the tour but NOFX kept on going and actually completed the tour. That was very rare and in my mind an example of the kind of discipline it takes to be successful." ...|$|E
