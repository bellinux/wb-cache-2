40|$|As {{a result}} of these studies a {{proposal}} for <b>FORCAST</b> was submitted to the SOFIA Announcement of Opportunity for Instruments. <b>FORCAST,</b> a facility instrument, was one of the winning proposals. A short description of <b>FORCAST</b> follows: (1) <b>FORCAST</b> is a dual-channel, high-sensitivity, wide-field camera designed to perform continuum imaging in the mid-infrared (4 - 8 microns) and far-infrared (16 - 40 microns). The pixels map to 0. 75 sec. on the sky and the total field-of-view is 3. 2 min. During normal operation a cold MgO dichroic allows imaging in two bands (16 - 25 and 25 - 40 microns) enabling high efficiency, simultaneous observations. For imaging at shorter wavelengths (4 - 8 microns), a mirror replaces the dichroic. <b>FORCAST</b> simultaneously operates two 256 x 256 Si BIB hybrid arrays from Boeing (formerly Rockwell). A Si:As BIB array is used for lambda less than 25 microns while a Si:Sb BIB array is use for lambda greater than 25 microns, <b>FORCAST</b> allows selection of the bandpass independently for each channel via filter wheels. Several specific filters are needed for the Pi science program. Selection of other filters will be based on input from the SOFIA science community. These can include filters to cover specific lines or dust features (such as the PAH features in the 4 - 8 microns regime). Future upgrades could include a polarimetric capability. The Pi team has extensive experience with all of the technologies used in <b>FORCAST.</b> <b>FORCAST</b> uses mature, low-risk, state-of-the-art technology ensuring highly reliability. In addition, <b>FORCAST</b> will be easy to set up for an observing run and easy to operate (with an intuitive graphical interface). We feel that we can virtually guarantee success on the first flight with <b>FORCAST.</b> <b>FORCAST</b> is designed to complement SIRTF (ISO will no longer be functional). While it cannot achieve the sensitivity levels of SIRTF, <b>FORCAST</b> covers sections of phase space not planned for SIRTF (30 - 40 microns imaging) and has significantly higher spatial resolution than SIRTF at all wavelengths...|$|E

40|$|We are {{constructing}} a facility-class, mid/far-infrared camera for the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA). The Faint Object infraRed CAmera for the Sofia Telescope (<b>FORCAST)</b> is a two-channel camera with selectable filters for continuum imaging in the 5 - 8, 17 - 25 micron, and/or 25 - 40 micron regions. The design supports simultaneous imaging in the two-channels. Using the latest 256 x 256 Si:As and Si:Sb blocked-impurity-band detector array technology to provide high-sensitivity wide-field imaging, <b>FORCAST</b> will sample images at 0. 75 arcsec/pixel {{and have a}} 3. 2 ’x 3. 2 ’ instantaneous field-of-view. Imaging is diffraction limited for lambda> 15 microns. Since <b>FORCAST</b> operates in the wavelength range where the seeing from SOFIA is best, it will provide the highest spatial resolution possible with SOFIA. <b>FORCAST</b> may eventually support a spectroscopy mode (resolving power, R~ 300 and R~ 1000 - 2000) using silicon grisms mounted in the filter wheels. The science projects planned by the investigator team include multicolor imaging of the galactic center, Vega-like dust clouds, and star formation regions in normal spiral galaxies and active galaxies. This instrument will be of great value to the SOFIA community for imaging of protostellar environments, young star clusters, molecular clouds, and galaxies. Multicolor information allows determination of dust temperatures, dust optical depths (and dust masses), dust composition, location of ionizing sources, and the spatial morphology of star forming regions.

The explicit representation of the vegetation canopy within the model allowed us {{to test the hypothesis}} that stomatal conductance regulates emissions of these compounds to an extent that its influence is observable at the ecosystem scale, a process not currently considered in regional- or global-scale atmospheric chemistry models. We found that <b>FORCAsT</b> could only reproduce the magnitude and diurnal profiles of methanol and acetaldehyde fluxes measured {{at the top of the}} forest canopy at Harvard Forest if light-dependent emissions were introduced to the model. With the inclusion of such emissions, <b>FORCAsT</b> was able to successfully simulate the observed bidirectional exchange of methanol and acetaldehyde. Although we found evidence that stomatal conductance influences methanol fluxes and concentrations at scales beyond the leaf level, particularly at dawn and dusk, we were able to adequately capture ecosystem exchange without the addition of stomatal control to the standard parameterisations of foliage emissions, suggesting that ecosystem fluxes can be well enough represented by the emissions models currently used...|$|E
