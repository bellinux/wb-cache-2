40|$|Sodium <b>Fast</b> <b>Reactors</b> {{are one of}} {{the three}} {{candidates}} of GEN-IV <b>fast</b> <b>reactors.</b> <b>Fast</b> <b>reactors</b> {{play an important role in}} saving uranium resources and reducing nuclear wastes. Conventional <b>fast</b> <b>reactors</b> rely on transuranic fuels from reprocessing facilities, which are not available in the U. S. Thus, deployment of <b>fast</b> <b>reactors</b> requires decoupling from reprocessing facilities. This motivates the design and deployment of Uranium Startup sodium <b>Fast</b> <b>Reactors</b> (USFR) on a once-through fuel cycle in order to facilitate the transition to <b>fast</b> <b>reactors</b> by reducing their plant costs and increase capacity factor. Three different fuel types including uranium carbide (UC), metal (UZr) and uranium oxide (U 0 2) are investigated and analyzed using the ERANOS code for potential use in USFR designs. A key enabling factor is use of high-albedo MgO or Zr reflectors in place of fertile blankets to reduce uranium enrichment and improve non-proliferation resistance. The different compositions in different fuel types result in different neutronic performance. The softer spectrum and lower allowable fuel volume fractions of oxide fuel have shorter fuel cycle length due to reactivity constraints, whereas fast neutron fluence plays an important role i...|$|R

The various molten salt reactor projects like FHR, MOSART, MSFR, and TMSR have common themes in basic R areas, according to a 2014 paper giving an overview of the MSR in a GenV context.

25|$|<b>Fast</b> neutron <b>reactors</b> use <b>fast</b> {{neutrons}} {{to cause}} fission in their fuel. They {{do not have}} a neutron moderator, and use less-moderating coolants. Maintaining a chain reaction requires the fuel to be more highly enriched in fissile material (about 20% or more) due to the relatively lower probability of fission versus capture by U-238. <b>Fast</b> <b>reactors</b> have the potential to produce less transuranic waste because all actinides are fissionable with fast neutrons, but they are more difficult to build and more expensive to operate. Overall, <b>fast</b> <b>reactors</b> are less common than thermal reactors in most applications. Some early power stations were <b>fast</b> <b>reactors,</b> as are some Russian naval propulsion units. Construction of prototypes is continuing (see fast breeder or generation IV reactors).|$|R

40|$|In {{the coming}} future, the {{electric}} energy production from {{nuclear power plants}} will be provided by both thermal <b>reactors</b> and <b>fast</b> <b>reactors.</b> In {{order to have a}} sustainable energy production through fission <b>reactors,</b> <b>fast</b> <b>reactors</b> should provide an increasing contribution to the total electricity production from nuclear power plants. <b>Fast</b> <b>reactors</b> have to achieve economic and technical targets of Generation IV. Among these <b>reactors,</b> Sodium cooled <b>Fast</b> <b>Reactors</b> (SFRs) and Lead cooled <b>Fast</b> <b>Reactors</b> (LFRs) have the greatest possibility to be developed as industrial power plants within few decades. Both SFRs and LFRs require a great R&D effort to overcome some open issues which affect the present designs (e. g. sodium-water reaction for the SFRs, erosion/corrosion for LFRs, etc.). The present paper is mainly focused on LFR fuel assembly (FA) design: issues linked with the high coolant density of lead or lead–bismuth eutectic cooled reactors have been investigated and an innovative solution for the core mechanical design is here proposed and analyzed. The solution, which foresees cylindrical fuel assemblies and exploits the buoyancy force due to the lead high density, allows to simplify the FAs locking system, to reduce their length and could lead to a more uniform neutron flux distributio...|$|R

25|$|Some {{proposed}} {{nuclear reactor}} designs however {{such as the}} American Integral <b>Fast</b> <b>Reactor</b> and the Molten salt reactor can use the nuclear waste from light water reactors as a fuel, transmutating it to isotopes that would be safe after hundreds, instead {{of tens of thousands}} of years.

25|$|The high thermal {{conductivity}} and {{high melting point}} makes uranium carbide an attractive fuel. In addition, because {{of the absence of}} oxygen in this fuel (during the course of irradiation, excess gas pressure can build from the formation of O2 or other gases) as well as the ability to complement a ceramic coating (a ceramic-ceramic interface has structural and chemical advantages), uranium carbide could be the ideal fuel candidate for certain Generation IV reactors such as the gas-cooled <b>fast</b> <b>reactor.</b>|$|E
25|$|Despite their {{different}} designs, ORNL and AERE maintained contact {{during this period}} with information exchange and expert visits. Theoretical work on the concept was conducted between 1964 and 1966, while experimental work was ongoing between 1968 and 1973. The program received annual government funding of around £100,000-£200,000 (equivalent to £2m-£3m in 2005).

50|$|The primary {{argument}} for pursuing IFR-style technology {{today is that}} it provides the best solution to the existing nuclear waste problem because <b>fast</b> <b>reactors</b> can be fueled from the waste products of existing reactors {{as well as from}} the plutonium used in weapons, as is the case in the operating, as of 2014, BN-800 reactor.

50|$|<b>Fast</b> neutron <b>reactors</b> use <b>fast</b> fission {{to produce}} energy, unlike most nuclear reactors. In a {{conventional}} reactor, a moderator {{is needed to}} slow down the neutrons so that {{they are more likely to}} fission atoms. A <b>fast</b> neutron <b>reactor</b> uses <b>fast</b> neutrons, so it does not use a moderator.
