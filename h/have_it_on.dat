25|$|In 1997, Palmer {{and fellow}} golfer Tiger Woods {{initiated}} {{a civil case}} {{in an effort to}} stop the unauthorized sale of their images and alleged signatures in the memorabilia market. The lawsuit was filed against Bruce Matthews, the owner of Gotta Have It Golf, Inc. and others. Matthews and associated parties counter-claimed that Palmer and associated businesses committed several acts, including breach of contract, breach of implied duty of good faith and violations of Florida's Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act. On March 12, 2014, a Florida jury ruled in favor of Gotta <b>Have</b> <b>It</b> <b>on</b> its breach of contract and other related claims.

25|$|Following various {{media reports}} in 2012 that Cyprus was {{entertaining}} offers by Israel and Greece to supply two heavy Offshore Patrol Vessels (OPVs), being far {{larger and more}} capable than anything previously operated, it was extensively reported in January 2013 that Cyprus has {{signed an agreement with}} France to purchase two large, stealthy and well-armed vessels based upon the GOWIND corvette design. This frenzy of media speculation was bolstered by the otherwise sudden and unexplained visit to Cyprus by the L'Adroit, which some sources interpreted as a demonstration of the ship design, to be held at Limassol port from 24 to 26 January 2013. Further unconfirmed reports by the Cyprus media claim to <b>have</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> good authority that a $120 million USD down payment for the vessels is factored into the 2013 fiscal budget, justified against the financial crisis by emergency defense requirements.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} hours of the morning on Wednesday, January 23, 1991, at {{approximately}} 1:20a.m., Lunsford spotted a suspicious vehicle travelling along U.S. Highway 59, a white 1981 Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme with Maine license plates. Lunsford pulled the vehicle over to the side of the road and turned on his dashboard camera to record the traffic stop. He then got out of his cruiser and approached the vehicle. Inside the vehicle were three men, Baldemar Sambrano Villarreal, his younger half brother, Reynaldo Sambrano Villarreal, and their accomplice, Jesus Cortez Zambrano. Lunsford questioned the driver, Reynaldo Villarreal, and asked whether he had any ID on him, to which Villarreal replied no. He claimed that he had a driver's license but did not <b>have</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> him. He also said that he was helping his brother, Baldemar, drive the car. Unbeknownst to Lunsford, the three men had loaded the car with 31 pounds of marijuana, and were driving from Houston, Texas, to Chicago, Illinois, where they planned to sell it all. At 1:27a.m., Lunsford asked to look in the trunk of the vehicle and the men reluctantly agreed. Lunsford and Reynaldo opened the trunk and Lunsford could immediately smell the scent of marijuana.|$|E

25|$|Models were well-proportioned {{and looked}} similar in style to {{contemporary}} Matchbox or Budgie Toys. For example, similar to Matchbox, the Land Rover (which {{came with a}} horse trailer) had windows, grey or black plastic wheels and a black base (see photo, Force 1988, p.47).The model in the photograph is a very poor example and any self respecting collector wouldn't <b>have</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> the shelf. Wheels, however, (the Land Rover had one on the bonnet {{as well as one}} underneath) were somewhat flatter and wider than those of Matchbox and their circumference was not ribbed at the beginning but this feature was added later. The baseplate, however, was pressed steel with etched lettering (not diecast with moulded lettering {{as was the case with}} Matchbox, Budgie Toys or Lone Star vehicles). Finally, the Land Rover had a trailer hook behind which was a cut, curved extension of the baseplate. The front and rear axles were held to the vehicle differently. The front was covered by the tube of the baseplate and held pinched on each side by extensions of the diecast body. The rear axle was exposed and run through holes in rounded sections folded over on each side of the plate. The ref. 072 Bedford articulated lorry was a reproduction of the Meccano factory lorry, its articulated flat trailer was dimensioned to receive the Hornby Dublo container.

500|$|Something of the {{reception}} to Wilfrid's expulsion can {{be picked up}} in a Latin letter which has survived only in an incomplete quotation by William of Malmesbury in his Gesta pontificum Anglorum.

In it, Aldhelm asks the clergymen to remember the exiled bishop [...] "who, nourishing, teaching, reproving, raised you in fatherly love" [...] and appealing to lay aristocratic ideals of loyalty, urges them not to abandon their superior. Neither William nor the citation itself gives a date, but the letter has been assigned to Wilfrid's exile under Aldfrith in the 690s.|$|E

500|$|It {{is unclear}} when Kujau {{produced}} his first Hitler diary. Stiefel says Kujau {{gave him a}} diary on loan in 1975. Schulze puts the date as 1976, while Kujau says he began in 1978, after a month's practice writing in the old German gothic script Hitler had used. Kujau used one of a pile of notebooks he had bought cheaply in East Berlin, and attempted to put the letters [...] "AH" [...] in gold on the front—purchasing plastic, Hong Kong-made letters from a department store, he inadvertently used [...] "FH" [...] rather than [...] "AH". He took the black ribbon from a genuine SS document, and attached it to the cover using a German army wax seal. For the ink he bought two bottles of Pelikan ink—one black, one blue—and mixed them with water so it would flow more easily from the cheap modern pen he used. Finally he sprinkled tea over the pages and bashed the diaries against his desk {{to give them an}} aged look. Kujau showed the first volume to Stiefel, who was impressed and thought it a genuine Hitler diary; Stiefel wanted to buy it, but when the forger refused, the pair agreed that the collector could <b>have</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> loan.|$|E
500|$|Speaking in 2000 {{about this}} first session, Harrison {{said that the}} music sounded [...] "really nice" [...] in the room, [...] "with all these nice {{acoustics}} and piano, and no echo on anything", but he was shocked during the playback when he heard how Spector had recorded the track. In Leng's words, Spector [...] " [...] his full armory of reverb-flooded production values" [...] on [...] "Wah-Wah". Harrison dismissed the result as [...] "horrible", and recalled that when Clapton said he liked the way it sounded, he replied, [...] "Well, you can <b>have</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> your album, then." [...] Although Harrison said [...] "I grew to like it", he subsequently reverted to his original opinion that the song, like much of All Things Must Pass, was overproduced. Overdubs {{on many of the}} album's basic tracks were carried out at either Abbey Road or Trident Studios, without Spector's assistance, and completed by 12 August. After receiving Harrison's initial mixes, Spector wrote back with suggestions for each song; in the case of [...] "Wah-Wah", these included the addition of a saxophone solo by Keys, and backing vocals. As well as overdubbing his slide guitar solos, Harrison sang all the various vocal parts, crediting himself as [...] "the George O'Hara-Smith Singers" [...] on the album sleeve.|$|E
500|$|The {{individual}} character arcs {{were laid out}} by the series' creative team, with Marvel's only initial guidelines being to work around Captain America: The Winter Soldier, which sees the organization S.H.I.E.L.D. destroyed. Jed Whedon said on this, [...] "if someone told you that concept, you'd {{think it was a}} great thing to have happen {{at the beginning of the}} show or the end of Season 3. To have it happen in the middle of your first season is an interesting kind of riddle". The writers worked to establish a [...] "regular day at S.H.I.E.L.D." [...] and the existing hierarchy, and then [...] "to blow that up, we knew the way to best illustrate that was by putting it on a personal level with our main man Coulson". Tancharoen elaborated that [...] "We see what it actually looks like for S.H.I.E.L.D. to crumble in Captain America 2, we see the Helicarriers literally barreling through the Triskelion, we see the massive destruction throughout the city, but the benefit of our show is we get to dive into the emotional toll of that." [...] Therefore, it was decided at the beginning of the series that one of the main characters would be a traitor, with Jed Whedon saying [...] "since this is an infiltration based on betrayal on a massive scale, we wanted to <b>have</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> the small scale, and have it be a really personal dagger to the heart." ...|$|E
