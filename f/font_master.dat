5000|$|Others {{had noticed}} the sudden {{growth in the}} {{typesetting}} equipment market. One was Singer Corp. which set up a national sales force for typesetting and graphic arts equipment, including the phototypesetting machines made by another Massachusetts company, Graphic Systems Inc. These machines had a brief but spectacular run in the 1970s until someone at Singer asked {{what they were doing}} in the typesetting equipment business (which they knew nothing about), so little GSI was left to its own devices with no marketing organization. Singer had been responsible for providing the type <b>font</b> <b>masters</b> and the machines were getting a reputation for poor base line regularity. This may have been a hardware problem because strobe timing errors showed up as base line errors on the GSI machines, while on the Mergenthaler VIP such errors showed up between the characters, and unless fairly serious, escaped notice. GSI began producing excellent <b>font</b> <b>masters</b> and the machines continued to find a market. They built a minicomputer into the machine (a Nova), making it capable of setting justified, hyphenated type from a pure text input using a particularly convenient coding system that owed nothing to old Linotype practices. It allowed stored formats, or in-line codes. These machines held four fonts at a time, but had more characters per font than the VIP, so that the asterisks and other common characters were included. They used a rotating turret of lenses and a second [...] "doubler lens" [...] to offer a range of sizes from 5 to 72 points. The GSI machines were particularly popular with the in-house typesetting departments that began to grow in most larger companies. Clark E. Coffee ...|$|R

Although any font can be compressed or expanded by software, the results from a multiple <b>master</b> <b>font</b> are superior.

This means that vertical strokes will be proportionally thicker than the horizontal strokes, giving an uneven appearance.

50|$|Adobe's goal in {{multiple}} <b>master</b> <b>font</b> technology was to allow end-users of fonts {{to create the}} exact font they needed for a situation, by adjusting parameters such as boldness or width. However, multiple <b>master</b> <b>fonts</b> proved unpopular in consumer-facing use due {{to the difficulty of}} writing (or rewriting) consumer desktop publishing applications to support them, and because font designers have generally preferred to release fonts in specific weights and styles, as font files that have been individually fine-tuned. However, the multiple master concept remains heavily used at font design studios, allowing designers to generate a range of weights and styles quickly and then optimise them individually. 'Multiple master' may therefore often be seen as a generic term describing interpolated font design generally, not necessarily using Adobe technology.|$|R
50|$|Prior to {{supporting}} OpenType, Adobe promoted multiple <b>master</b> <b>fonts</b> and expert fonts for high-end typography. Multiple <b>master</b> <b>fonts</b> lacked the controls for alternate glyphs and languages provided by OpenType, but provided smooth transitions between styles within a type family. Expert fonts were intended as supplementary fonts, such {{that all the}} special characters that had {{no place in the}} Adobe Standard Encoding character set - ligatures, fractions, small capitals, etc. - were placed in the expert font instead. Usage in applications was tricky, with, for example, typing a Z causing the ffl ligature to be generated. In modern OpenType fonts all these glyphs are encoded with their Unicode indices and selection method (i.e. under what circumstances that glyph should be used).|$|R
5000|$|OpenType {{variable}} fonts are {{an extension}} to the OpenType specification, introduced in OpenType 1.8.

40|$|The {{hypothesis}} {{was that it}} is possible to create a unique PostScript Multiple <b>Master</b> <b>font</b> which makes a relatively smooth transition between serifed roman and italic letterforms. In the process of creating such a font, the author discovered new principles of Multiple <b>Master</b> <b>font</b> construction and new methodologies for ensuring smooth transitions. The methodology was to first construct a prototype, in order to explore the complications of such a project; the prototype metamorphosed between the roman and italic forms of the Adobe typeface Minion. For the actual project, roman and italic extremes were newly designed, loosely based on historical models dating from around 1540. The initial models for these fonts were found in a 16 th century French edition of Livy 2 ̆ 7 s His tory of Rome, published by the Giunti family, from the Melbert B. Cary, Jr. Graphic Arts Collection. The models were scanned, and the digital bitmaps used as the starting point for the digital masters. Creation of the font involved a variety of software tools, on both Macintosh and Windows, notably Macromedia Fontographer. The written thesis project explores the technical and design problems and solutions uncovered in creation of both the prototype and the thesis project, and explaining how these add to the theory and principles of Multiple <b>Master</b> <b>font</b> construction. The thesis also: reviews the relationship between italic and roman typefaces; analyzes the success of the intermediate fonts between italic and roman; and displays printed samples of various steps in the design process, as well as the two final masters and three intermediate fonts at various levels of italicization...|$|R
5000|$|For example, the Myriad {{multiple}} <b>master</b> <b>font</b> had two axes: [...] "weight" [...] and [...] "width." [...] This font {{would include}} four separate [...] "master designs" [...] of each character: light compressed, light extended, bold compressed, and bold extended. Any weight or width font in between these endpoints {{can be produced}} by interpolating between the character outlines of these master designs. The addition of italics requires another four master designs.|$|R

The wheel's periphery has four such replaceable font film strip sections. A xenon strobe inside the wheel is programmed to flash the characters from the font films through magnification optics to a fiber-optic bundle. The programmable location of the fiber-optic bundle determines the horizontal position of the character image on a scroll of photographic paper or film.|$|R
50|$|OpenType Font Variations re-introduces {{techniques}} {{that were previously}} developed by Apple in TrueType GX, and by Adobe in Multiple <b>Master</b> <b>fonts.</b> The common idea of these formats is that a single font includes data to describe multiple variations of a glyph outline (sometimes referred to as “masters”), and that at text-display time, the font rasterizer is able to interpolate or “blend” these variations to derive a continuous range of additional outline variations.|$|R
5000|$|Multiple {{different}} versions of the same glyph with different widths may be used. This method was used by Gutenberg in the 42-line bible (see [...] ), but is less easy now because few fonts come with multiple versions of the same glyph. It is not practical with narrow variants of a font or with different weights of a font because the glyphs look too different from each other to create good effect. It is possible with some multiple <b>master</b> <b>fonts.</b>|$|R
50|$|Adobe Jenson {{was first}} {{released}} in 1996 as a multiple <b>master</b> <b>font.</b> It was created using sophisticated interpolation or multiple-master technology, {{to create a}} range of weights and optical sizes suitable for different text sizes.

It is now sold in the standard OpenType font format under the name Adobe Jenson Pro.|$|R
