40|$|Most studies {{carried out}} on {{personality}} recognized that personality is defined by behavioural traits consistent through time and/or contexts. In fish, most studies on personality were performed either on juveniles (aged between 6 months and 1 year) or adults, but very few focused on the early life stages. The main goal {{of this study is}} to characterize behavioural syndromes and to highlight the existence of a personality in young juvenile pikeperch, a species with a strong economic value. To study the consistency of behavioural responses of juvenile (50 and 64 days post-hatch) pikeperch Sander lucioperca (n = 41, total length = 5. 8 +/- 1. 0 cm and mass = 1. 6 +/- 0. 7 g), we performed three tests per fish in one day: exploration (cross-maze), dyadic and restraint test. In the cross-maze test, <b>exploratory</b> <b>fish</b> were more active and bolder. In the dyadic test, fish with the highest number of contacts, showed also more approaches, orientations and avoidance behaviours. In the restraint test, bolder fish were more active and tried to escape more often. Consequently, the investigation of the different behavioural responses of each fish highlighted behavioural syndromes in this species. Furthermore, for the first time, we showed, with a cross-context analysis, that young juvenile pikeperch, responded in the same way to exploration and dyadic test but their responses were opposite in the restraint test. Our results opened new opportunities for testing individual personality in very young fish that may help solving some aquaculture problems, such as intra-cohort cannibalism...|$|R

40|$|Behavioral {{variation}} {{has been}} documented both between and within populations {{in a variety of}} traits. Many of these behavioral traits are phenotypically plastic and are conditional on the early environment an animal experiences, yet despite this the role of the environment in generating variation in boldness is not well understood. Here we investigate the importance of early and recent experience of temporal unpredictability in food supply on the behavior of a species of freshwater fish, the Trinidadian guppy Poecilia mticulata. We predict that individuals that experience temporally unpredictable food supplies will engage in more risky behavior than those experiencing a Predictable food supply and find evidence to support this. Fish with early experience of unpredictable environments are generally bolder and more <b>exploratory</b> than <b>fish</b> reared in predictable environments, exploring a significantly greater proportion of a novel maze and spending less time in a refuge during the trial. Individuals with early experience of unpredictability also spent significantly less time associating with conspecifics in a shoaling tendency assay, again suggesting that they are bolder than guppies reared in predictable conditions. These findings suggest that early experience is important in shaping exploratory anti shoaling behavior in this species and that unpredictability in early life can influence boldness in guppies...|$|R

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of BiologyMartha E. MatherDetermining {{patterns}} and drivers of organismal distribution and abundance are fundamental and enduring challenges in ecology, especially for mobile organisms at a ‘scape scale. To {{address the problem}} presented by individuals whose distributions are dynamic across large geographic areas, here I tracked 59 acoustically-tagged migratory striped bass (Morone saxatilis) {{with an array of}} 26 stationary receivers in Plum Island Estuary (PIE), MA. Specifically, I asked (1) how these predators were distributed across the estuarine seascape, (2) if these fish used three types of geomorphic sites (exits, confluences, and non-confluences) differently, (3) if distinct types of individual distributional “types” existed, and (4) if fish within distinct distributional groups used geomorphic site types and regions differently. Based on three components of predator trajectories (site specific numbers of individuals, residence time, and number of movements), striped bass were not distributed evenly throughout PIE. Confluences attracted tagged striped bass although not all confluences or all parts of confluences were used equally. Use of non-confluences sites was more variable than exits or confluences. Thus, geomorphic drivers and regions link mobile organisms to physical conditions across the seascape. Based on spatial and spatial-temporal cluster analyses, these striped bass predators clustered into four seasonally-resident distributional types. These included the (1) Rowley River group (fish that primarily resided in the Rowley River), (2) Plum Island Sound group (fish that primarily resided in the Middle Sound region), (3) Extreme Fidelity group (fish that spent most of their time in PIE at a single receiver location), and (4) the <b>Exploratory</b> group (<b>fish</b> that showed no affiliation with any particular location). These distributional groups used geomorphic site types and regions differently.
