5000|$|In meteorology, <b>irisation,</b> {{a type of}} photometeor, is {{multiple}} mixed iridescent colors {{caused by}} sunlight being diffracted in clouds. The colors are often brilliant and mingled together, sometimes similar to mother-of-pearl. They sometimes appear as bands parallel {{to the edge of}} the clouds. <b>Irisation</b> is caused by very uniform water droplets diffracting light (Within 10 degrees from the Sun) and by first order interference effects (Beyond about 10 degrees from the Sun). It can extend up to 40 degrees from the Sun. <b>Irisation</b> is sometimes seen along the borders of lenticular clouds. Irisations are named after the Greek goddess Iris, goddess of rainbows and messenger of Zeus and Hera to the mortals below.|$|E

It {{has been described}} as crystal clear, with yellow-whitish glows end emerald <b>irisations,</b> filled with liveliness and distinction.|$|R

This is deemed to be pathogenic to a low degree, taking immediate advantage of the environment and triggering diseases at a time when the immunological capability of defense of the organisms is low or, when favorable factors come about. Prototheca is capable to induce disease in man as well as in several other animal species. Twenty strains of Prototheca sp, were sampled from cows with mastitis. The strains are characterized morphologically and developmentally on various culture media: glucose media (broth and agar), blood agar, potato medium, glucose medium of various pH values, medium containing antibiotics, Mac Conkey agar, Smith Baskerville medium (without antibiotics), and engine-oil medium. Growth took place within conditions of aerobic at 37 ° C and the culture became visible within 36 - 48 hours. On liquid media there has been noticed that the medium keeps settled and the tube bottom shelters granular drags, that lend to slight homogenization. On solid media the colonies become visible within 36 - 48 hours. By continuing to maintain them at room temperature, they increase in size. First, they are small, irregular in shape resembling ice crystals reflecting shiny <b>irisations.</b> With lapse of time, they increase in size reaching 3 - 5 mm, displaying pale-white colour. They also increase in height and the surface takes a mulberry or cauliflower shape. Morphological assessment was carried out on wet smear in Lügol solution or in thinned staining solutions (methylene blue, malachite green, Congo red or fuchsine), allowing for good differentiation in the inne...|$|R

50|$|The {{effect is}} similar to <b>irisation.</b> Iridescent clouds are a {{diffraction}} phenomenon caused by small water droplets or small ice crystals individually scattering light. Larger ice crystals do not produce iridescence, but can cause halos, a different phenomenon.|$|E
50|$|A {{photometeor}} is a {{topic in}} atmospheric optics. These can be bright objects or phenomena appearing in Earth's atmosphere when sunlight or moonlight creates a reflection, refraction, diffraction or interference under particular circumstances. The most frequent are halos, rainbows, fogbows, cloud iridescences (or <b>irisation),</b> glories, Bishop's rings, coronas, crepuscular rays, parhelia, light pillars, mirages, scintillations, green flashes, etc.|$|E
5000|$|Cirrocumulus {{lenticularis}} {{is a type}} of cirrocumulus cloud. The name cirrocumulus lenticularis {{is derived}} from Latin, meaning [...] "like a lentil". Cirrocumulus lenticularis are smooth clouds that have the appearance of a lens or an almond. They usually form at the crests of atmospheric waves, which would otherwise be invisible. This species of cirrocumulus can often be quite elongated and normally has very distinguished boundaries. Cirrocumulus lenticularis forms when stable air is forced upward; this is usually due to orographic features, but can occur away from mountains as well. <b>Irisation</b> can occasionally occur with these clouds.|$|E
