40|$|SplitPocket ([URL] is a {{web server}} to {{identify}} <b>functional</b> <b>surfaces</b> of protein from structure coordinates. Using the Alpha Shape Theory, we previously developed an analytical approach to identify protein <b>functional</b> <b>surfaces</b> by the geometric {{concept of a}} split pocket, which is a pocket split by a binding ligand. Our geometric approach extracts site-specific spatial information from coordinates of structures. To reduce the search space, probe radii are designed according to the physicochemical textures of molecules. The method uses the weighted Delaunay triangulation and the discrete flow algorithm to obtain geometric measurements and spatial patterns for each predicted pocket. It can also measure the hydrophobicity on a surface patch. Furthermore, we quantify the evolutionary conservation of surface patches by an index derived from the entropy scores in HSSP (homology-derived secondary structure of proteins). We have used the method to examine ∼ 1. 16 million potential pockets and identified the split pockets in > 26 000 structures in the Protein Data Bank. This integrated web server of <b>functional</b> <b>surfaces</b> provides a source of spatial patterns to serve as templates for predicting the <b>functional</b> <b>surfaces</b> of unbound structures involved in binding activities. These spatial patterns should also be useful for protein functional inference, structural evolution and drug design...|$|R

40|$|Recently, solvent {{exchange}} {{has been}} demonstrated as a simple solution-based approach for the controlled formation of surface nanodroplets over large areas. The as-formed surface nanodroplets provide new opportunities {{for a wide range}} of droplet-based applications. Herein, it is demonstrated that surface nanodroplets can be used as versatile structural templates for the fabrication of <b>functional</b> <b>surfaces</b> with tailored wettability and morphology. Guided by the microstructural and wetting properties of desert beetle&# 039;s back and cactus spine, two types of <b>functional</b> <b>surfaces</b> have been prepared. The first biomimetic surface of desert beetle&# 039;s back, with hydrophilic lumps on a hydrophobic background, was obtained by independent selective surface modification of polymerized surface nanodroplets and the background surface. The second surface, with anisotropic wetting microstructures, was fabricated by controlled deposition of droplets on the rim of polymer lenses. The results showed systematic improvement of wettability and efficiency of water collection by using the as-prepared biomimetic surfaces, compared with substrates without the designed microstructures. This work demonstrates surface nanodroplets as a new type of template in the design and preparation of <b>functional</b> <b>surfaces</b> with controlled wettability and morphology...|$|R
40|$|Both imperatoxin A (IpTx(a)), a 33 -residue peptide toxin from {{scorpion}} venom, and peptide A, {{derived from}} the II-III loop of dihydropyridine receptor (DHPR), interact specifically with the skeletal ryanodine receptor (RyR 1), which is a Ca(2 +) -release channel in the sarcoplasmic reticulum, but with considerably different affinities. IpTx(a) activates RyR 1 with nanomolar affinity, whereas peptide A activates RyR 1 at micromolar concentrations. To investigate the molecular basis for high-affinity activation of RyR 1 by IpTx(a), we have determined the NMR solution structure of IpTx(a), and identified its <b>functional</b> <b>surface</b> by using alanine-scanning analogues. A detailed comparison of the <b>functional</b> <b>surface</b> profiles for two peptide activators revealed that IpTx(a) exhibits a large <b>functional</b> <b>surface</b> area (approx. 1900 A(2), where 1 A= 0. 1 nm), based on a short double-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet structure, while peptide A bears a much smaller <b>functional</b> <b>surface</b> area (approx. 800 A(2)), with the five consecutive basic residues (Arg(681), Lys(682), Arg(683), Arg(684) and Lys(685)) being clustered at the C-terminal end of the alpha-helix. The <b>functional</b> <b>surface</b> of IpTx(a) is composed of six essential residues (Leu(7), Lys(22), Arg(23), Arg(24), Arg(31) and Arg(33)) and several other important residues (His(6), Lys(8), Arg(9), Lys(11), Lys(19), Lys(20), Gly(25), Thr(26), Asn(27) and Lys(30)), indicating that amino acid residues involved in RyR 1 activation make up over the half of the toxin molecule {{with the exception of}} cysteine residues. Taken together, these results suggest that the site where peptide A binds to RyR 1 belongs to a subset of macrosites capable of being occupied by IpTx(a), resulting in differing the affinity and the mode of activation...|$|E
30|$|To be used {{in various}} applications, a nanoneedle surface must be {{modified}} to the desired <b>functional</b> <b>surface.</b> Two methods are used to functionalize nanoneedles: direct functionalization of the nanoneedle bare surface, and functionalization of a nanoneedle surface coated with other materials [13]. Because the bare surface of nanoneedle materials provides only limited chemical functional groups, complex chemical and physical treatments are often used to obtain the desired surface properties. On the other hand, the surface coating method not only affords the desired <b>functional</b> <b>surface,</b> but also improves the mechanical properties of the nanoneedles.|$|E
