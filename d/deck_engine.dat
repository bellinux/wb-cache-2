We began dredging at daybreak and hooked at once every time in rocks; but by capital luck, just as we were deciding it was no use to continue in that place, we hooked the cable: up it came, was tested, and lo! another complete break, {{a quarter of a mile}} off. I was amazed at my own tranquillity under these disappointments, but I was not really half so fussy as about getting a cab. Well, there was nothing for it but grappling again, and, as you may imagine, we were getting about six miles from shore. But the water did not deepen rapidly; we seemed to be on the crest of a kind of submarine mountain in prolongation of Cape de Gonde, and pretty havoc we must have made with the crags. What rocks we did hook! No sooner was the grapnel down than the ship was anchored; and then came such a business: ship's engines going, <b>deck</b> <b>engine</b> thundering, belt slipping, fear of breaking ropes: [...] actually breaking grapnels. It was always an hour or more before we could get the grapnel down again. At last we had to give up the place, though we knew we were close to the cable, and go further to sea in much deeper water; to my great fear, as I knew the cable was much eaten away and would stand but little strain. Well, we hooked the cable first dredge this time, and pulled it slowly and gently to the top, with much trepidation. Was it the cable? was there any weight on? it was evidently too small.

40|$|Abstract Background: In {{their working}} activity, {{seafarers}} {{are exposed to}} high levels of stress that should be accuratelyinvestigated, measured, followed up and, if possible, countered. This is also required by regulations recently entered into force such as the Maritime Labour Convention 2006, recommending to consider special physiological or psychological problems created by the shipboard environment. The choice of the tools for this evaluation is challenging, and a common basic standard usable in a large scale should be identified. Aim: The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate: 1) the suitability of the Psychological General Well-Being Index (PGWBI) questionnaire conducted on board for assessing stress in the sailing seafarers, 2) The presenceof stress in seafarers of different categories (<b>deck</b> officers, <b>engine</b> officers, <b>deck</b> crew, <b>engine</b> crew, chiefstewards/catering staff) monitored by the PGWBI. Materials and methods: 162 male seafarers on board of 7 tankers belonging to the same shipping companywere evaluated through the PGWB questionnaire. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to analyse thedifferences in the scores of the questionnaire. Results: Engine officers exhibited significantly higher anxiety levels than the <b>deck</b> or <b>engine</b> crew, andshowed lower satisfaction than the deck crew. <b>Deck</b> and <b>engine</b> officers revealed higher self-control levelsthan the engine crew. Chief stewards/catering staff showed lower vitality levels than the deck crew. Conclusions: <b>Deck</b> or <b>engine</b> officers should achieve a greater self-control than the crew and this is documentedby the present study. Our findings support the view that management responsibility is more often associated with higher levels of stress. In our opinion, the PGWB questionnaire is a reasonable compromise forobtaining a global evaluation of psychological conditions, including stress of seafarers. It should be therefore considered as a large scale tool for assessing the well-being and eventual stress levels of sailing seafarers...|$|R

Hagan was abusive to Glatkowski when he was home, but was often on duty or cruises and Glatkowski learned to be independent at an early age. As a teenager Glatkowski assumed the role of head of the household when Hagan was at sea and this made Hagan very angry when he returned home. He often took out his frustrations on Glatkowski violently, which led him to leave home at eighteen. Glatkowski went to New York and enrolled in the Seafarers Harry Lundeberg School of Seamanship operated by the Seafarers International Union.

5000|$|From the beginning, the {{construction}} program {{was plagued by}} difficulties which caused it to fall far behind schedule. Unfamiliar with {{the capabilities of the}} Great Lakes yards, Kaiser Cargo used prefabrication techniques unsuited to the Great Lakes yards smaller cranes and had to rework them. Ice prevented patrol frigates built on the Great Lakes from transiting the Soo Locks on the St. Marys River between Lake Superior and Lake Michigan in the winter and spring, requiring them to be floated down the Mississippi River on pontoons to New Orleans or Houston for fitting out, often doubling their construction time. Delays became so lengthy that shipyards began to deliver the ships in such an incomplete state that shakedown and post-shakedown periods of repair and alteration took months for some of them. Bilge keels that cracked in rough seas or cold weather, failures in the welds holding the deckhouse to the <b>deck,</b> <b>engine</b> trouble, and ventilation problems plagued all of the ships. As a result, no Tacoma-class ship was commissioned until late in 1943, none were ready for service until 1944, and the last one, , was not commissioned until March 1945. The ships Consolidated Steel built proved the most reliable, while Kaiser Cargo-built units were the most trouble-prone; among the latter, USS Tacoma (PF-3) took ten months of shakedown and repairs to be ready after her commissioning, and [...] proved equally difficult to make ready for service.|$|E
5000|$|In 1969 Pontiac created four {{versions}} of the Ram Air V engine: a 303 cuin L short deck version for SCCA Trans-Am racing, a 366 cuin L variant for NASCAR, a 400 cuin L version for street use in GTOs and Firebirds, {{as well as a}} 428 cuin L adaptation for drag racing. The cylinder head design is similar to the Ford FE tunnel-port head used in the GT40 and Can-Am series racing. So large are the intake ports that the pushrods run through the center of each port via pressed-in tubes, in addition to streamlined airfoils over the tubes themselves to improve port shape, and increase flow velocity. The 303 had shorter connecting rods, smaller 2.5 in journals and a solid lifter version of the Ram Air IV camshaft. It shared the 4.121 in bore of the 400, but with a 2.84 in stroke for a displacement of 303 cu in. The short <b>deck</b> <b>engine</b> weighed about 40 lb less than the other variants and had an 8000 rpm redline. Pontiac’s SCCA Trans-Am program was promising, with race-ready engines producing [...] to , however the series’ General Competition Rules required the manufacturer to produce no less than 250 vehicles with the 303. Plans were made to produce Firebirds and GTOs with advertised ratings of [...] and [...] respectively but concerns about emissions, the response of the automobile safety lobby, and the warranty implications of a high-revving street engine led to cancellation of the program [...] The total number of Ram Air V engines produced is not known and a handful of Ram Air V 303's may have made their way onto the Pontiac Firebird Trans Am assembly line. Only about 25 303 cu in engines were produced and about a dozen 428s and 366s. More 400 cu in engines were produced by Pontiac than the other versions - estimates range from 80 to 200 units. Quite a few 400s were dealer installed. Ram Air V engines are extremely rare and parts are not readily available. Ram Air V cylinder heads as used on the 400 CID version had a intake port volume of 290cc, nearly twice the size of a typical standard D-port Pontiac head- and flowed in the area of 315cfm @ [...]800" [...] valve lift; {{in the realm of the}} Nascar-dominating Chrysler 426 Hemi.
