Omentectomy (removal of the omentum) is a quick, simple procedure that also greatly decreases the risk of adhesions, since the omentum is one organ that commonly adheres to the intestines. The abdomen is usually lavaged copiously before the abdomen is sutured closed, and anti-inflammatories are given postoperatively. A laparoscope may be used post-surgery to look for and break down adhesions, however there is risk of additional adhesions forming post-procedure. Encouraging motility post-surgery can also be useful, as it decreases the contact time between tissues. Adhesion-induced colic has a poor prognosis, with a 16% survival rate in one study.|$|E

However, despite different endotoxemia therapeutic regimens, {{the lack of an}} effective treatment still remains a clinical problem in sheep. Tyloxapol is a potential pro- and anti-inflammatory molecule to treat endotoxemia in farm animals. Hence, the present study was an attempt to clarify the antiendotoxic effects of tyloxapol in comparison with betamethasone and <b>flunixin</b> <b>meglumine</b> in experimentally induced endotoxemia in sheep. Thirty clinically healthy 1 -year old Iranian fat-tailed ewes were randomly divided into 6 equal experimental (n= 5) groups, comprising Negative and Positive control, <b>Flunixin</b> <b>meglumine,</b> Betamethasone, Tyloxapol 1 and Tyloxapol 2. Phenol extracted lipopolysaccharide from Escherichia coli serotype O 55 :B 5 was infused at 2 μg/kg intravenously. Ninety min after endotoxemia induction, <b>Flunixin</b> <b>meglumine</b> (2. 2 mg/kg), betamethasone (1 mg/kg) and tyloxapol (200 and 400 mg/kg) were injected to respective groups, over 60 min along with intravenous fluids.

Haptoglobin, serum amyloid A, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interferon-gamma, superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase were measured in all samples. Serum concentrations of haptoglobin, serum amyloid A, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interferongamma in <b>Flunixin</b> <b>meglumine</b> group were found to be lower than other experimental ones after hour 3.

ANIMALS: 4 healthy horses for in vitro experiments and 12 healthy horses (6 males and 6 females; 5 Thoroughbreds, 5 Warmbloods, and 2 ponies) undergoing elective surgery for ex vivo experiments. PROCEDURES: 12 horses received <b>flunixin</b> <b>meglumine</b> (1. 1 mg/kg, IV, q 12 h) or firocoxib (0. 09 mg/kg, IV, q 24 h). Blood {{samples were collected}} before (baseline) and 2 and 24 hours after NSAID administration. Prostanoids (thromboxane B 2, prostaglandin E 2, and prostaglandin E metabolites) served as indicators of COX activity, and serum drug concentrations were measured by use of high-performance liquid chromatography. An in vitro coagulation-induced thromboxane B 2 assay was used to calculate drug concentration-COX- 1 inhibition curves. Effect of time and treatment on COX activity was determined.

Intracaveal injection of carrageenan induced prostaglandin (PG) E- 2 production in tissue-cage exudate (maximal concentration, 101 nM) with significant increases in white blood cell (WBC) numbers, skin temperature over the inflamed cage and exudate leukotriene B- 4 (LTB 4) concentration (P < 0. 05). Intravenous PBZ, 4. 4 mg kg(- 1) produced mild inhibition of exudate PGE(2) generation (10 %), but greater inhibition of serum TXB 2 (75. 3 %). The IC 50 for TXB 2 was 36. 0 mu M. Phenylbutazone did not alter effects on skin temperature, WBC numbers or exudate LTB 4 concentrations. Intravenous FM, 1. 1 mg kg(- 1), significantly inhibited carrageenan-induced exudate PGE(2) formation (E-max, 100 %, IC 50, < 0. 4 nM) and serum TXB 2 generation (E-max, 100 %, IC 50, 17 nM) for up to 32 h. <b>Flunixin</b> <b>meglumine</b> significantly inhibited the rise in skin temperature but had a limited effect on exudate WBC. Phenylbutazone and FM have distinct effects on carrageenan-induced cyclooxygenase (COX- 2) and platelet COX (COX- 1). <b>Flunixin</b> <b>meglumine</b> was a more potent COX inhibitor than PBZ and was more selective for the inducible form of COX in vivo...|$|E
40|$|Characterizing the {{variability}} in transcript levels across breeds and sex in swine for genes that {{play a role in}} drug metabolism may shed light on breed and sex differences in drug metabolism. The objective of the study is to determine if there is heterogeneity between swine breeds and sex in transcript levels for genes previously shown {{to play a role in}} drug metabolism for animals administered <b>flunixin</b> <b>meglumine</b> or fenbendazole. Crossbred nursery female and castrated male pigs (n = 169) spread across 5 groups were utilized. Sires (n = 15) of the pigs were purebred Duroc, Landrace, Yorkshire or Hampshire boars mated to a common sow population. Animals were randomly placed into the following treatments: no drug (control), <b>flunixin</b> <b>meglumine,</b> or fenbendazole. One hour after the second dosing, animals were sacrificed and liver samples collected. Quantitative Real-Time PCR was used to measure liver gene expression of the following genes: SULT 1 A 1, ABCB 1, CYP 1 A 2, CYP 2 E 1, CYP 3 A 22 and CYP 3 A 29. The control animals were used to investigate baseline transcript level differences across breed and sex. Post drug administration transcript differences across breed and sex were investigated by comparing animals administered the drug to the controls. Contrasts to determine fold change were constructed from a model that included fixed and random effects within each drug. Significant (P-value < 0. 007) basal transcript differences were found across breeds for SULT 1 A 1, CYP 3 A 29 and CYP 3 A 22. Across drugs, significant (P-value < 0. 0038) transcript differences existed between animals given a drug and controls across breeds and sex for ABCB 1, PS and CYP 1 A 2. Significant (P < 0. 0038) transcript differences across breeds were found for CYP 2 E 1 and SULT 1 A 1 for <b>flunixin</b> <b>meglumine</b> and fenbendazole, respectively.

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were 1) {{to determine the effects of}} flunixin megulmine in combination with caudal epidural anesthesia as a postoperative analgesic in beef calves following surgical castration, and 2) to consider stride length and pedometry as potential behavioral assessment tools for detecting postcastration pain. Surgical castration was performed in 101 beef calves randomly assigned to 3 treatment subgroups: 1) castration without anesthesia (SURG); 2) castration following lidocaine with epinephrine caudal epidural anesthesia (SURG + EPI); 3) castration following lidocaine with epinephrine caudal epidural anesthesia and <b>flunixin</b> <b>meglumine</b> (SURG + EPI + F). Several outcomes, including pedometer counts, changes in stride length, subjective visual assessment of pain, instantaneous scan sampling of the calves’ postoperative activities, and the amount of movement and vocalization during the castration procedure, were measured to identify and quantify pain. The results indicated that stride length and the number of steps taken by calves after castration appear to be good measures of pain.

40|$|Reasons for {{performing}} study: <b>Flunixin</b> <b>meglumine</b> {{continues to be}} used for treatment of equine colic despite evidence of inhibited recovery of mucosal barrier function following small intestinal ischemic injury. This study aimed to characterize an alternative treatment (AHI- 805) for abdominal pain in the horse. Objective: To determine the effect of AHI- 805, an aza-thia-benzoazulene derivative, on the cyclooxygenase enzymes, and the recovery of mucosal barrier function following ischemic injury. Methods: The effect of AHI- 805 on in-vitro COX- 1 and COX- 2 activity was determined by measuring coagulation-induced thromboxane B 2 (TXB 2) and lipopolysaccharide-stimulated prostaglandin E 2 concentrations respectively in equine whole blood. Horses (n= 6) were anesthetized and jejunum was subjected to ischemia for 2 hours. Control and ischemic-injured mucosa was placed in Ussing chambers and treated with Ringer’s solution containing control treatment (DMSO), <b>flunixin</b> <b>meglumine</b> (2. 7 × 10 - 5 M), or AHI- 805 (2. 7 × 10 - 5 M). Trans-epithelial electrical resistance (TER) and mucosal-to-serosal flux of 3 H-mannitol were measured over a 4 -hour recovery period. Bathing solution TXB 2 and prostaglandin E metabolites (PGEM) were measured by enzyme immunoassay (EIA) to assess COX- 1 and COX- 2 function respectively. Results: Treatment with AHI- 805 had no significant effect on coagulation induced TXB 2 production but significantly inhibited production of LPS-induced PGE 2 at a concentration of 1 µM or greater. TER of flunixin or AHI- 805 treated ischemic-injured jejunum was significantly lower than control treated injured tissue over the recovery period. Mannitol flux and grade of histological damage were significantly increased by ischemic injury but not treatment. There was a significant increase in PGEM and TXB 2 in control tissues over the 240 minute recovery period, but not in flunixin or AHI- 805 treated tissues. Conclusions: <b>Flunixin</b> <b>meglumine</b> and AHI- 805 inhibit recovery of barrier function in ischemic-injured equine jejunum in vitro through inhibition of the COX enzymes.

40|$|Testicular {{degeneration}} is a multifactorial process {{increasing the}} concentration of prostaglandins in seminal plasma. Both increase and decrease of these hormones tend to promote loss of seminal quality. <b>Flunixin</b> <b>meglumine</b> is a potent anti-inflammatory drug capable of modulating the production of prostaglandins and is widely used in female reproduction. However, it is rarely used in males with the same objective. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate {{the effects of this}} drug on seminal quality of male lambs and goats with spermatic characteristics unfavorable for reproduction. To this end, a total of 15 breeding animals were evaluated, of which six goats and four sheep with poor seminal quality were selected according to the criteria established by the Brazilian College of Animal Reproduction (CBRA). Three semen samples were collected from each animal. Then, the <b>flunixin</b> <b>meglumine</b> treatment was initiated and ejaculates were collected at two different periods after the drug was administered (from day 21 until day 35 and from day 49 to day 63). Macroscopic and microscopic parameters were assessed in semen samples and scrotal circumference and percentages of sperm pathologies were measured and compared between the three periods. Data with normal distribution were analyzed using ANOVA at 5 % probability, and comparisons between periods within the same species were performed using the Tukey test. An improvement was observed in the analyses of mass motility, percentage motility, and sperm vigor. Scrotal circumference had no variation. Concerning sperm pathologies, {{an increase in the number}} of normal spermatozoids was observed due to a significant reduction in minor and major defects, and the latter remained low even after the treatment was finished.
