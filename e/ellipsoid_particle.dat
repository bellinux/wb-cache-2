40|$|The {{study of}} viscous fluid flow coupled with rigid or {{deformable}} solids has many applications in biological and engineering problems, e. g., blood cell transport, drug delivery, and particulate flow. We developed a partitioned approach {{to solve this}} coupled Multiphysics problem. The fluid motion was solved by Palabos (Parallel Lattice Boltzmann Solver), while the solid displacement and deformation was simulated by LAMMPS (Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator). The coupling was achieved through the immersed boundary method (IBM). The code modeled both rigid and deformable solids exposed to flow. The code was validated with the classic problem of rigid <b>ellipsoid</b> <b>particle</b> orbit in shear flow and demonstrated essentially linear scaling over 16 cores.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{numerical}} {{investigation of the}} dynamics of one falling oblate <b>ellipsoid</b> <b>particle</b> in a viscous fluid, in three dimensions, using a constrained-force technique Kai, Kaih and Esa. We study the dynamical behavior of the oblate for a typical downward motion and obtain the trajectory, velocity, and orientation of the particle. We analyze the dynamics of the oblate generated when the height of the container, the aspect-ratio, and the dynamical viscosity are changed. Three types of falling motions are established: steady-falling, periodic oscillations and chaotic oscillations. In the periodic regime we find a behavior similar to the case of falling flat strips reported in ref. Belmonte. In the chaotic regime the trajectory of the oblate is characterized by a high sensitivity to tiny variations in the initial orientation. The Lyapunov exponent is λ = 0. 052 ± 0. 005. A phase space comparing to the results of ref Nori, is shown. Comment: Submitted to PR...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Interaction of vortex rings {{with solid}} is an {{important}} research topic of hy-drodynamic. In this study, a multiple-relaxation time (MRT) lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) is used to investigate the flow of a vortex ring impacting spheroidal particles. The MRT-LBM is validated through the cases of vortex ring impacting a flat wall. The vortex evolution due to particle size, the aspect ratio of a prolate particle, as well as Reynolds (Re) number are discussed in detail. When the vortex ring impacting a sta-tionary sphere, the primary and secondary vortex rings wrap around each other, which {{is different from the}} situation of the vortex ring impacting a plate. For the vortex ring impacting with a prolate spheroid, the secondary vortex ring stretches mainly along the long axis of the <b>ellipsoid</b> <b>particle.</b> However, it is found that after the vortex wrap-ping stage, the primary vortex recovers along the short axis of the particle faster than that in the long axis, i. e., the primary vortex ring stretches mainly along the short axis of the particle.

40|$|AbstractAcacia gum is a {{branched}} complex polysaccharide {{whose main}} chain consists of 1, 3 -linked β-D-galactopyranosyl units. Acacia gum {{is defined as}} a heteropolysaccharide since it contains ∼ 2 % of a polypeptide. The major molecular fraction (F 1) accounting for ∼ 88 % of the total acacia gum mass is an arabinogalactan peptide with a weight-average molecular weight of 2. 86 × 105 g/mol. The molecular structure of F 1 is actually unknown. From small angle neutron scattering experiments in charge screening conditions, F 1 appeared to be a dispersion of two-dimensional structures with a radius of gyration of ∼ 6. 5 nm and an inner dense branched structure. Inverse Fourier transform of F 1 scattering form factor revealed a disk-like morphology with a diameter of ∼ 20 nm and a thickness below 2 nm. Ab initio calculations on the pair distance distribution function produced a porous oblate <b>ellipsoid</b> <b>particle</b> with a central intricated “network”.

Particles released to the fluid in microsystems are subjected to forces exerted by the fluid, and eventually to the certain external forces.

In the past decades, mixing of granular materials in rotating drums has been extensively investigated, {{but most of the}} studies are based on spherical particles. Particle shape has an influence on the flow behaviour and thus mixing behaviour, though the shape effect has as-yet received limited study. In this work, discrete element method (DEM) is employed to study the transverse mixing of ellipsoidal particles in a rotating drum. The effects of aspect ratio and rotating speed on mixing quality and mixing rate are investigated. The results show that mixing index increases exponentially with time for both spheres and <b>ellipsoids.</b> <b>Particles</b> with various aspect ratios are able to reach well-mixed states after sufficient revolutions in the rolling or cascading regime. Ellipsoids show higher mixing rate when rotational speed is set between 25 and 40 rpm. The relationship between mixing rate and aspect ratio of ellipsoids is established, demonstrating that, particles with aspect ratios of 0. 5 and 2. 0 achieve the highest mixing rates.

40|$|A {{precision}} {{capillary viscometer}} with a photoelectric timer {{has been designed}} and built for these investigations. On {{the assumption that the}} relative viscosity can be expanded in a power series in concentration, the intrinsic viscosity and the coefficient of the second order term have been measured for suspensions of sperical and rigid rodlike macromolecules. The viscosity of a known heterogenous suspension of rods and spheres has been determined and has been interpreted in terms of interaction coefficients. The Einstein theory of viscosity of dilute suspensions of spheres has been modified to form, together with the approaches of Burgers and Jeffery, a logically consistent theory for the intrinsic viscosity of spherical molecules in particular, and <b>ellipsoid</b> <b>particles</b> in general. The second order theory in volume fraction for the viscosity of suspensions was reviewed. Previous work in this field was found to be in error. It was shown that, when properly interpreted, the linear solution of Burgers to the problem of the viscosity of dilute suspensions of spheres fully explains the variation of the relative viscosity with concentration. The linear theory of Burgers did not adequately explain the variation of the relative viscosity of rod-like molecules with concecntration. This was attributed to mutual orientation effects. The study of the system consisting of rods and spheres also indicated that orientation effects might be important. ...|$|R
40|$|Morphology {{evolution}} {{is an important}} process in naturally occurring biominerals. To investigate the interaction between biomolecules and inorganic components {{in the construction of}} biominerals, biomimetic hexagonal prism vaterite crystals were hydrothermally prepared through a reaction of urea with calcium nitrate tetrahydrate, whilst gelatin was added as a structure directing agent. An extraordinary morphology evolution was observed. The time dependent growth was investigated by using X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy and thermogravimetric analysis. In the early stages, vaterite nanocrystallites, ~ 5 nm in diameter, underwent aggregation with gelatin molecules and precursor molecules into 50 nm sized clusters. Some nanoneedles, consisting of self-orientated nanocrystallites embedded within a soft gelatin matrix, were developed on the surface of disordered cores to form spherulite particles, with a similar morphology to natural spherulite biominerals. Further growth was affected by the high viscosity of gelatin, resulting in <b>ellipsoid</b> <b>particles</b> composed of spherulitically ordered needles. It is proposed that surface adsorbed gelatin induces the formation of dipoles in the nanocrystallites and interaction between the dipoles is the driving force of the alignment of the nanocrystallites. Further growth might create a relatively strong and mirror-symmetric dipolar field, followed by a morphology change from ellipsoidal with a cell-division like splitting, to twin-cauliflower, dumbbell, cylindrical and finally to hexagonal prism particles. In this morphology evolution, the alignment of the crystallites changes from 1 D linear manner (single crystal like) to 3 D radial pattern, and finally to mirror symmetric 1 D linear manner. This newly proposed mechanism sheds light on the microstructural evolution in many biomimetic materials and biominerals. PostprintPeer reviewe...|$|R

It relies on a 2 D-Tree domain decomposition in the lens plane combined {{with a description of}} N-Body particles as extended clouds with a non-singular density. This technique is made fully adaptive by the use of a density-dependent smoothing which allows one to probe the lensing properties of haloes from the densest regions in the center or in substructures to the low-density regions in the outskirts. 'Smooth Particle Lensing' has some promising features. First, the deflection potential, the deflection angles, the convergence and the shear are direct and separate end-products of the SPL calculation and can be computed at an arbitrary distribution of points on the lens plane. Second, this flexibility avoids the use of interpolation or a finite differentiation procedure on a grid, does not require padding the region with zeros and focuses the computing power on relevant regions. The SPL algorithm is tested by populating isothermal spheres and <b>ellipsoids</b> with <b>particles</b> and then comparing the lensing calculations to the classical FFT-based technique and analytic solutions. We assess issues related to the resolution of the lensing code and the limitations set by the simulations themselves.

With the emergence and rapid advancement of DNA microarray technologies, constructing gene expression profiles for different cancer types has already become a promising means for cancer classification. In addition to research on binary classification such as normal versus tumor samples, which attracts numerous efforts {{from a variety of}} disciplines, the discrimination of multiple tumor types is also important. Meanwhile, the selection of genes which are relevant to a certain cancer type not only improves the performance of the classifiers, but also provides molecular insights for treatment and drug development. Here, we use Semisupervised Ellipsoid ARTMAP (ssEAM) for multiclass cancer discrimination and particle swarm optimization for informative gene selection. ssEAM is a neural network architecture rooted in Adaptive Resonance Theory and suitable for classification tasks. ssEAM features fast, stable, and finite learning and creates hyperellipsoidal clusters, inducing complex nonlinear decision boundaries. PSO is an evolutionary algorithm-based technique for global optimization. A discrete binary version of PSO is employed to indicate whether genes are chosen or not.

Jeffery’s work has been the basis for current modeling and has been widely applied. The model given above {{is based on the}} assumption that the fibers are rigid. However, it can also be used in describing the orientation of flexible fibers at least from a statistical point of view as discussed in [5] even though it does not take into account the flexibility of the fibers. Some studies have also taken into account the fiber-fluid coupling through an orientation tensor including momentum exchange between the fiber and the fluid phases [13]. This type of approach to model the most probable orientation state of the fibers on different flow conditions has shown to be rather convenient when studying the flows of industrial scales. Naturally, there are some assumptions e.g. about the low enough concentration and rigidity of the fibers which does not necessarily meet the conditions in reality. The latter assumption is violated in the case of papermaking, where the wood fibers are long and flexible, thus causing additional complexity such as possible flocculation for the flow. However, the commonly taken approach gives practical information about the real-life phenomena present under the flows of papermaking and is of importance in trying to improve the papermaking process.|$|R

Due to the absorbing effect, light scattering properties of particles with absorption differ from those without absorption. Simple shaped absorbing particles such as spheres and spheroids have been well studied with different methods but little work on large complex shaped particles has been reported. In this paper, the surface Integral Equation (SIE) with Multilevel Fast Multipole Algorithm (MLFMA) is applied to study scattering properties of large non-spherical absorbing particles. SIEs are carefully discretized with piecewise linear basis functions on triangle patches to model whole surface of the particle, hence computation resource needs increase much more slowly with the particle size parameter than the volume discretized methods. To improve further its capability, MLFMA is well parallelized with Message Passing Interface (MPI) on distributed memory computer platform. Without loss of generality, we choose the computation of scattering matrix elements of absorbing dust particles as an example. The comparison of the scattering matrix elements computed by our method and the discrete dipole approximation method (DDA) for an <b>ellipsoid</b> dust <b>particle</b> shows that the precision of our method is very good.

40|$|A common {{technique}} {{to control the}} grain size of a material is {{by the addition of}} impurities, which leads to the formation of second-phase particles. These particles influence grain boundary movement {{in such a way that}} grain growth is arrested and a limiting grain size is reached. This pinning effect depends on the volume fraction and the shape of the particles, the geometry at the grain boundary-particle intersections and the associated interface energies. Computer simulations are a practical tool, not only to determine the number and the geometry of grain boundary-particle intersections, but also to study the roles of the different characteristics of the second-phase particles separately. Together with the existing analytical theories and the experimental findings, they can provide valuable insights. Until now, the pinning effect of second-phase particles has mostly been studied by two-dimensional simulations and for sphere-shaped particles. In this work, the effect of <b>ellipsoid</b> second-phase <b>particles</b> on grain growth is studied by three-dimensional phase field simulations. The employed model is the phase field model of [1], which was extended in [2] to simulate grain growth in the presence of incoherent second-phase particles with constant properties. Because realistic three-dimensional grain growth simulations with this phase field model demand significant amounts of computation power, a parallel implementation of a sparse bounding box algorithm was made.

The instrument uses measurements of the depolarized component of light scattered by single particles into the near-forward direction (42. 5 ° ± 12. 7 °) to distinguish between spherical and non-spherical particles. This approach allows the differentiation between liquid water droplets (spherical) and ice particles (non-spherical) having similar volume equivalent sizes and therefore can be used to determine the fraction of frozen droplets in a typical immersion freezing experiment. We show that the numerical simulation of the light scattering on non-spherical <b>particles</b> (<b>ellipsoids</b> in random orientation) with account for the actual scattering geometry used in the instrument supports the validity of the approach, even though the cross polarized component of the light scattered by spherical droplets is not vanishing in this scattering angle.

Exploiting the intrinsic relationship between pulse height and pulse width for Gaussian pulses allows us to calculate the fraction of frozen droplets even if the liquid droplet mode dominates the particle ensemble.

Als eine alternative Methode zur Herstellung anisotroper Polymerpartikel wurde im letzten Teil der vorliegenden Arbeit Elektrospinnen eingesetzt. Es konnte gezeigt werden, dass es prinzipiell möglich ist, ellipsenförmige PS-Partikel zu erhalten, deren Aspektverhältnis durch die Höhe der angelegten Spannung und den Abstand zwischen Spitze und Kollektor beeinflusst wurde. Neben PS-Partikeln konnten auch PMMA-Kapseln über Elektrospinnen verstreckt werden. Mittels der Film-Dehnungs-Methode konnte jedoch eine größere Vielfalt an Aspektverhältnissen hergestellt werden. Ein weiterer Nachteil gegenüber der Film-Dehnungs-Methode ist die relativ breite Größenverteilung der verstreckten Partikel. Jedoch ist Elektrospinnen im Gegensatz zur Film-Dehnungs-Methode ein kontinuierlicher Prozess und könnte auch für die Herstellung anisotroper Partikel von Polymeren mit einer hohen Glasübergangstemperatur verwendet werden. In {{the first}} part of the thesis hydrophilic polyurethane particles were synthesized in non-aqueous inverse miniemulsions by polyaddition reaction of oligoethylene glycol and either tolylene- 2, 4 -diisocyanate or isophorone diisocyanate. FT-IR spectroscopy confirmed that the absence of water in the system had circumvented the formation of urea bonds. The molecular weight of the obtained polyurethanes could be influenced by several parameters such as the hydrophobicity of the continuous phase or the addition of DMSO to the dispersed phase. Using Isopar M as continuous phase molecular weights as high as 19, 000 g•mol- 1 (Mn) could be obtained. In the second part of this work anisotropic nanoparticles were prepared using a film stretching method. Spherical PS particles were embedded in a PVA film, which was then stretched uniaxially or biaxially at a temperature above the glass transition temperature of PS and PVA. <b>Ellipsoids</b> or disk-shaped <b>particles</b> could be obtained. The re-dispersibility of the recovered stretched particles in water was found to be strongly dependent on the surface functionalization of the initial spherical particles. The highest re-dispersibility (46 %) was obtained for sulfonate-functionalized particles. In the last part of the thesis electrospinning was explored as a method for the formation of anisotropic polymer particles. It was possible to prepare ellipsoidal PS particles whose aspect ratio depended on the applied voltage and the tip-collector distance. Compared to electrospinning, the film stretching method allowed the formation of nanoparticles with a larger variety of aspect ratios. Another drawback in comparison to the film stretching method was the large polydispersity in size of the stretched particles. However, the electrospinning is a continuous process and can be hence applied for the formation of larger amount of anisotropic particles. Furthermore, the electrospinning technique allows the preparation of anisotropic particles from polymer with a high glass transition temperature because no heating above the glass transition temperature is required, as it is the case for the film stretching method...|$|R
