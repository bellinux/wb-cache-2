5|$|Figs have an obligate {{mutualism}} with fig wasps, (Agaonidae); figs {{are only}} pollinated by fig wasps, and fig wasps can only reproduce in fig flowers. Generally, each fig species {{depends on a}} single species of wasp for pollination. The wasps are similarly <b>dependent</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> fig species in order to reproduce. Ficus aurea is pollinated by Pegoscapus mexicanus (Ashmead).|$|E
5|$|The Agaonidae (fig wasps) are {{the only}} pollinators of nearly 1000 species of figs, and thus are crucial to the {{survival}} of their host plants. Since the wasps are equally <b>dependent</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> fig trees for survival, the coevolved relationship is fully mutualistic.|$|E

Aiming to explore the vast market of the former USSR, they used the situation to make professionals and services totally <b>dependent</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> financial sustenance, turned the major attention to the availability of medicines rather than that of psycho-social rehabilitation services, and stimulated corruption within the mental health sector very much.|$|E

After about 7 weeks they open their eyes. They start to climb after 8 weeks. Kits are completely <b>dependent</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> mother's milk {{for the first}} 8–10 weeks, after which they begin {{to switch to a}} solid diet. After 4 months, kits become intolerant of their litter mates, and at 5 months, the mother pushes them out on their own. After one year, juveniles will have established their own range.|$|E

5|$|Preliminary {{designs for}} the Prophets, {{including}} the Hierarchs, were done by artist Shi Kai Wang. According to The Art of Halo, the Prophets were designed to look feeble, yet sinister. Originally, the Prophets appeared to be fused to the special hovering thrones they use for transport; even in the final designs, the Prophets are made to be <b>dependent</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> technology.

Arriving in Australia in February 1942, the 49th Pursuit Group moved to the Darwin area in March and April 1942. By this time, Darwin had been bombed a number of times. The 49th Pursuit Group became its {{principal}} defense. Conditions in the area were still primitive, and spare parts and equipment were scarce. Lacking adequate logistical support, the Americans were heavily <b>dependent</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> Australian allies. Morale was low, but the sight of Wurtsmith's aircraft patrolling the skies provided an important boost.|$|E
5|$|A character's {{performance}} in battle {{is determined by}} numerical values ("statistics") for four categories. Each statistic has a range of 1 to 99. The categories are strength, the effectiveness of physical attacks; defense, the ability to reduce damage received; agility, the effectiveness of ranged weapons or skills and at avoiding attacks; and mana, the effectiveness of magical attacks. A character's health is measured in hit points (HP), consisting of a current HP statistic and a maximum HP statistic, ranging from 0 to 999. Character statistics are relative to their class—humans have higher HP levels, strength, and defense, and mutants are physically weaker but enjoy a higher mana statistic. Human and mutant statistics can be amplified by worn equipment of different types. Monster-class characters are <b>dependent</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> sub-class, and their statistics vary greatly.|$|E
5|$|A {{nutritional}} {{analysis of}} P.indusiatus (based on specimens collected from Nigeria) {{determined that the}} egg stage of the fungus contains (per 100g of fungus, dry weight) 33.6g of crude protein, 1.66g of fat, and 3.98g of carbohydrates. The egg stage was also measured to comprise 20.9g dietary fibre, and 88.76% moisture. The high levels of protein and fibre (which are comparable to values found in meat and vegetables, respectively) suggest that the egg form of P.indusiatus is a good food source. The concentration of several mineral elements, including potassium, sodium, and iron, was also favourable compared to fruits and vegetables, although the mineral composition in the fungus is <b>dependent</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> corresponding concentrations in the soil in which they grow.|$|E

Therefore the existing socio-spatial relationships in such settlements can be considered as an asset to the settlement that urban designers and Architects must recognize in future resettlement programmes...|$|R

5|$|Alcibiades {{served as}} a {{military}} adviser to Sparta and helped the Spartans secure several crucial successes. He advised them to build a permanent fort at Decelea, just over ten miles (16km) from Athens and {{within sight of the}} city. By doing this, the Spartans cut the Athenians off entirely from their homes and crops and the silver mines of Sunium. This was part of Alcibiades's plan to renew the war with Athens in Attica. The move was devastating to Athens and forced the citizens to live within the long walls of the city year round, making them entirely <b>dependent</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> seaborne trade for food. Seeing Athens thus beleaguered on a second front, members of the Delian League began to contemplate revolt. In the wake of Athens's disastrous defeat in Sicily, Alcibiades sailed to Ionia with a Spartan fleet and succeeded in persuading several critical cities to revolt.|$|E
5|$|Combat in Final Fantasy VI is menu-based, {{in which}} the player selects an action {{from a list of}} such options as Fight, Magic, and Item. A maximum of four {{characters}} may be used in battles, which are based on the series' traditional Active Time Battle (ATB) system first featured in Final Fantasy IV. Under this system, each character has an action bar that replenishes itself at a rate <b>dependent</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> speed statistic. When a character's action bar is filled, the player may assign an action. In addition to standard battle techniques, each character possesses a unique special ability. For example, Locke possesses the ability to steal items from enemies, while Celes' Runic ability allows her to absorb most magical attacks cast until her next turn.|$|E
5|$|It is {{not known}} whether pterosaurs practiced any form of parental care, but their ability to fly {{as soon as they}} emerged from the egg and the {{numerous}} flaplings found in environments far from nests and alongside adults has led most researchers, including Christopher Bennett and David Unwin, to conclude that the young were <b>dependent</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> parents for {{a relatively short period of}} time, during a period of rapid growth while the wings grew long enough to fly, and then left the nest to fend for themselves, possibly within days of hatching. Alternatively, they may have used stored yolk products for nourishment during their first few days of life, as in modern reptiles, rather than depend on parents for food.|$|E
50|$|The Act {{required}} people claiming {{children as}} <b>dependents</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> tax returns to obtain and list a Social Security number for every claimed child, {{to verify the}} child's existence. Before this act, parents claiming tax deductions were on the honor system not to lie {{about the number of}} children they supported. The requirement was phased in, and initially Social Security numbers were required only for children over the age of 5. During the first year, this anti-fraud change resulted in seven million fewer dependents being claimed, nearly all of which are believed to have involved either children that never existed, or tax deductions improperly claimed by non-custodial parents.|$|R

5|$|It was {{expected}} that the change in reaction would quintuple the probability of synthesizing unbinilium, as the yield of such reactions is strongly <b>dependent</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> asymmetry. Three correlated signals were observed on 18 May 2011 that matched the predicted alpha decay energies of 299Ubn and its daughter 295Og, {{as well as the}} experimentally known decay energy of its granddaughter 291Lv: the decay chain could thus be interpreted as beginning from 299Ubn and undergoing four successive alpha decays to the spontaneously fissioning 283Cn, with the final alpha from 287Fl having been missed. However, the lifetimes of these possible decays differed from theoretical expectations, and the results could not be confirmed due to lack of beam time.|$|E
5|$|Male orangutans play {{almost no}} role in raising the young. Females {{do most of the}} caring and socializing of the young.

The mother will carry the infant during travelling, as well as feed it and sleep with it in the same night nest. For the first four months, the infant is carried on its belly and never relieves physical contact. In the following months, the time an infant spends with its mother decreases.|$|E
5|$|Scattered evidence, {{including}} the records in Irish annals {{and the visual}} images like the warriors depicted on the Pictish stone slabs at Aberlemno, Forfarshire and Hilton of Cadboll, in Easter Ross, suggest that in Northern Britain, as in Anglo-Saxon England, the upper ranks of society formed a military aristocracy, whose status was largely <b>dependent</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> ability and willingness to fight. Below {{the level of the}} aristocracy it is assumed that there were non-noble freemen, working their own small farms or holding them as free tenants. There are no surviving law codes from Scotland in this period, but such codes in Ireland and Wales indicate that freemen had the right to bear arms, represent themselves in law and to receive compensation for murdered kinsmen.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{founding}} of the republic, the Centuriate Assembly became the principle Roman assembly in which magistrates were elected, laws were passed, and trials occurred. During his Consulship in 509 BC, Publius Valerius Publicola enacted a law (the lex Valeria) which guaranteed due process rights to every Roman citizen. Any condemned citizen could evoke his right of Provocatio, which appealed any condemnation to the Centuriate Assembly, and which was a precursor to habeas corpus. Also around this time, the Plebeians assembled into an informal Plebeian Curiate Assembly, which was the original Plebeian Council. Since they were organized {{on the basis of the}} Curia (and thus by clan), they remained <b>dependent</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> Patrician patrons. In 471 BC, a law was passed due to the efforts of the Tribune Volero Publilius, which allowed the Plebeians to organize by Tribe, rather than by Curia. Thus, the Plebeian Curiate Assembly became the Plebeian Tribal Assembly, and the Plebeians became politically independent.|$|E

The average size of the egg is , and weighs , of which 6% is shell. The eggs are incubated for 12–15days, mainly by the female. The chicks are altricial and downy, and are fed by both parents. They fledge about 14–16days after hatching. There are normally two broods, except in Siberia, where there is only one, the male feeding the fledglings from the first brood while the female sits on the second clutch. Sometimes the same nest is reused for both broods. The young are <b>dependent</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> parents for 15–20 days after fledging.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of species are surface feeders, obtaining food {{that has been}} pushed to the surface by other predators or currents, or have floated in death. Among the surface feeders some, principally the gadfly petrels, can obtain food by dipping from flight, {{while most of the}} rest feed while sitting on the water. These surface feeders are <b>dependent</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> prey being close to the surface, and for this reason procellariids are often found in association with other predators or oceanic convergences. Studies have shown strong associations between many different kinds of seabirds, including wedge-tailed shearwaters, and dolphins and tuna, which push shoaling fish up towards the surface.|$|E
