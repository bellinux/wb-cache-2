40|$|An {{in vitro}} {{biological}} assay system was utilized {{to evaluate the}} effects of cyclopiazonic acid (CPA) mycotoxin on turkey cardiac papillary muscle performance. Acute exposure to 6 ug CPA/ml of bathing solution significantly decreased five performance criteria of in vitro papillary muscles. These criteria were; maximum weight a muscle could lift, maximum contraction velocity, maximum relaxation velocity, time to peak contraction and total time for muscle contraction and relaxation. These irreversible, altered performances appeared to be intracellular changes partially associated with calcium availability and suggested that physiopathological changes had occurred following acute CPA exposure. A second study demonstrated similar decreases in in vitro muscle performance which were compared with pathological changes. Electron photomicrographs demonstrated that the CPA exposed muscles evaluated in the biological assay system had increased numbers of swollen or lysed mitochondria. Irreversible decreased muscle performance and altered mitochondrial morphology were attributed to altered calcium and ATP availability. Two acute in vivo studies were designed to establish a dose response curve and assess the toxicological changes seen in turkey poults exposed to CPA. These are the first reports of CPA toxicity in turkey poults. Poults were given oral doses of 0, 5, 10, or 20 mg/kg/d for 2 days. Poults given 20 mg/kg/d were sacrificed in extremis 30 h after initial exposure. Clinical signs included: lethargy, ataxia, drooped head and wings, ruffled feathers, marked anorexia, and watery feces of reduced amounts. Total serum proteins and albumin were decreased by CPA ingestion. Major gross lesions noted at necropsy occurred in the gastrointestinal tract and liver. Poults receiving 10 and 20 mg/kg/d had focal erosions in the proventriculus and ventriculus, a fibrino-gelatinous membrane present in the ventriculus, and decreased liver weights. Hematological changes were leukocytosis, heterophilia, and lymphocytosis. Histopathologic changes included mucofibrinous necrotizing proventriculitis and ventriculitis, acute multifocal <b>erosive</b> <b>enteritis</b> and mild multifocal granulomatous hepatitis with bile duct proliferation. Body weight, feed consumption and water intake were significantly decreased by CPA ingestion. No cardiac ultrastructural changes were noted...|$|E
40|$|Peste des petits {{ruminants}} (PPR) is {{an acute}} febrile viral disease of {{sheep and goats}} characterized by mucopurulent nasal and ocular discharge, necrotizing and <b>erosive</b> stomatitis, <b>enteritis</b> and pneumonia. The disease is endemic in Pakistan and causes huge economic losses due to high rates of mortality and morbidity in infected sheep and goats. In the present study, 660 serum samples of sheep and goat were collected from 24 districts of Punjab Province of Pakistan. Competitive Enzyme Linked Immunosorbant Assay (cELISA) was used to detect the presence of antibodies in the serum against PPRV. Findings suggested that the sero-positive cases were significantly higher in sheep than in goats (51. 29 versus 39. 02 %; P= 0. 002). The overall sero-prevalence of PPRV in small ruminants was 43. 33 %. Highest prevalence (35. 71 - 100 %) was observed in Southern districts, while no antibodies were found in serum from some of Northern and Eastern districts of the Punjab Province...|$|R
40|$|Two highly {{contagious}} diseases, Peste des Petits Ruminants and Sheep and Goat Pox, constitute main constraints {{to small}} ruminants production {{in many countries}} in Asia, the Near and Middle East and Africa. Peste des Petits Ruminants (PPR), also known {{in the past as}} goat plague, is a highly contagious viral disease affecting domestic and wild small ruminants. It is caused by a virus which belongs to the Morbillivirus genus of Paramyxoviridae family: the Peste des Petits Ruminants Virus (PPRV). It is a rinderpest-like infection of goats and sheep characterized by <b>erosive</b> stomatitis, <b>enteritis,</b> pneumonia and death. Economically, it is the most important small ruminant disease in areas where it is endemic. In the same regions, there is a second contagious viral disease, Sheep and goat pox. The responsible pathogens, the sheeppox virus (SPPV) and goatpox virus (GTPV), cause acute to sub acute disease of infected sheep and goats respectively. The clinical signs of infection may include generalized pox lesions throughout the skin and mucous membranes, persistent fever, lymphadenitis, and often a focal pneumonia and nodules lesions distributed uniformly throughout the lungs. There is no curative medical treatment against these two viral diseases. Therefore, the only way of tackling them is by means of sanitary and medical prophylaxis. Sanitary prophylaxis to be effective needs the existence of efficient veterinary services, the implementation of animal movement controls with sometimes the stamping out policy. The cost needed for the effective implementation of these means in a short period is too high for most of countries where these diseases are endemic. Therefore the only way for effective control of PPR and sheep and goat pox in those countries is the medical prophylaxis, i. e. the vaccination. Currently, efficient attenuated vaccines exist against each of these diseases. Unfortunately, in most cases they are used only in case of outbreaks to limit their extension. The cost of the logistic needed for systematic vaccination campaigns of small ruminants against either PPR or capripox may be too high for countries if only the individual economic value of goat or sheep, excluding their social value, is considered. The way to cut down this cost is the use of polyvalent vaccine which would enable, in one shot, the protection of animals against more than one economic important disease. The objective of our thesis work was to develop a recombinant thermostable (a characteristic linked to capripoxes) vaccine {{that could be used to}} protect sheep and goats against both PPR and capripox and thereby that would contribute to cut down the cost of vaccination campaigns. For that, the complementary DNA, cDNA, corresponding to the gene of PPRV immune protective proteins, the fusion (F) and the haemagglutinin (H) proteins were inserted into the genome of the attenuated strain capripox virus strain KS 1. Such a recombinant vaccine may be thermotolerant, a characteristic of poxviruses and this may improve the quality of the vaccine for its use in hot climate conditions. Capripox viruses are highly host-specific microorganisms. They are not pathogenic to human and their host range is limited to cattle and small ruminants and possibly buffaloes. Therefore they constitute an ideal and safe vector for the development of recombinant vaccines for use against ruminant diseases. The present manuscript in which we report on the results we have obtained during our thesis work is composed of the following different parts: a general introduction, a literature review of PPR and capripox viruses, the construction of two recombinant vaccines FPPR/Capripox and HPPR/Capripox, the comparison of efficacy of three poxvirus promoters in HPPR...|$|R
