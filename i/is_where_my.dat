He spent time in Bhopal with the people, to listen to their stories. In a later radio interview in February 2010 Rollins summed up his approach to activism, [...] "This <b>is</b> <b>where</b> <b>my</b> anger takes me, to places like this, not into abuse but into proactive, clean movement." ...|$|E

Connecting the lyrics with her own childhood, Fantasia said, [...] "I was very insecure growing up, and even though I'm not that girl anymore, I think that the passion, that not feeling pretty and being insecure <b>is</b> <b>where</b> <b>my</b> soul came from.

500|$|... "Biko" [...] {{was at the}} {{forefront}} of a stream of anti-apartheid music in the 1980s, and sparked a worldwide interest in music exploring the politics and society of South Africa. Along with songs such as [...] "Free Nelson Mandela" [...] by The Specials, and [...] "Sun City" [...] by Artists United Against Apartheid, [...] "Biko" [...] has been described as part of the [...] "soundtrack for the global divestment movement", which sought to persuade divestment from companies doing business in apartheid South Africa. These songs have been described as making the fight against apartheid part of Western popular culture. Gabriel's piece as been credited as the inspiration for many of the anti-apartheid songs that followed it. Steven Van Zandt, {{the driving force behind the}} 1985 track [...] "Sun City" [...] and the Artists United Against Apartheid initiative, stated that hearing [...] "Biko" [...] inspired him to begin those projects; on the cover of the album, he thanked Gabriel [...] "for the profound inspiration of his song ‘Biko’ which <b>is</b> <b>where</b> <b>my</b> ...|$|E

500|$|Jose Sarria {{was born}} in San Francisco, California, to Maria Dolores Maldonado and Julio Sarria. His family was of Spanish and Colombian origin. His mother Maria {{was born in}} Bogotá to an upper class and {{politically}} active family. During {{the events of the}} Thousand Days War and following her mother's death, Maria sought out the protection of her mother's friend, General Rafael Uribe Uribe, to escape Colombia. The general located Maria's surviving uncle, who took her to the American consulate. There she was made a ward of the United States and relocated to Panama. [...] "My mother got to Panama with directions to the home of a family called Kopp. He was the chairman of the big German beer company there", said Sarria. [...] "She {{went to work for the}} Kopps. ... My mother was the upstairs maid and took care of the children." [...] In 1919 she relocated to Guatemala City but remained there for just six months and, in 1920, sailed to San Francisco. As Sarria reported it, [...] "Now on the boat <b>is</b> <b>where</b> <b>my</b> mother met my father, Julio Sarria. He came from a large and very wealthy family, very well known. ...

500|$|Fearnet critic Alyse Wax wrote [...] "This episode made {{my brain}} hurt. [...] And I {{mean that in}} the nicest way possible. They were {{throwing}} a lot of weird shit at us. It was great because I feel like we are finally getting answers, like we will finally get some closure, and just maybe {{get rid of the}} Red universe stiffs. This episode was so ridiculously dense I am sure I missed some of the deeper scientific facts. I got the gist of it, though, and frankly, I much prefer these jam-packed episodes. I like when the puzzle pieces start falling into place. It's calming." [...] SFScope's Sarah Stegall believed the episode [...] "start out interestingly enough", but unlike other reviewers, she was very critical of the First People mythology, stating [...] "This <b>is</b> <b>where</b> <b>my</b> disbelief not only stopped being suspended, it got up {{and walked out of the}} room... I still don't like the premise of the evolution of an entire hominid species that left not one single solitary fossil behind. It's more like fantasy than science fiction." [...] Stegall praised Torv's acting as she plays [...] "two people very subtly, very convincingly", and concluded her review by commenting she will continue to watch the series because she trusts the writers will [...] "supply us with plausible answers from time to time", but is [...] "losing some respect for it".|$|E
500|$|In 1999, Westley {{bought a}} {{controlling}} interest in Farnborough Town and appointed himself as manager. He managed {{the club to}} a 12th-place finish {{in his first season}} in charge, but enjoyed success in the Isthmian Cup; winning the competition in 2000. The following season, Westley guided the club to more success, winning the Isthmian League Premier Division; securing 31 victories out of a possible 42 and amassing a total of 99 points. Westley overhauled the squad shortly after the club's promotion to the Football Conference – something which he now states as a [...] "huge regret". At this point, he also tried to arrange a merger with Kingstonian – citing the club's [...] "Football League rated ground" [...] as the reasoning behind his proposed idea, although it never happened due to [...] "fans resistance". [...] During the 2001–02 season, the club consolidated their position in the first tier of non–league football; with Westley guiding the club to a 7th-place finish in the league. The following season was to be a memorable campaign for Westley, reaching the Third Round of the FA Cup after a 3–0 victory at Southport, where they faced Football League competition in the form of Darlington at Feethams. Westley guided the side to a 3–2 win over Darlington, and the club were rewarded with a Fourth Round tie at home to Arsenal. The tie, however, was controversially moved to Highbury – because the tie stood to make around £600,000 in gate receipts from playing at Highbury, whereas playing at Cherrywood Road would only have generated the club an estimated £50,000. Westley left the club after the sell-out 'home' tie at Highbury, which they lost 5–1. Shortly after his resignation, he became manager at Football Conference rivals Stevenage in January 2003, signing a three-year contract. Westley confirmed he would be leaving his shareholding in Farnborough to other existing shareholders, and would also be withdrawing his financial backing at the club. On moving to Stevenage, Westley said [...] "I've enjoyed my time at Farnborough, but I feel that I need to move on now and that I need to concentrate on football management, which <b>is</b> <b>where</b> <b>my</b> ambitions lie". He went on to state that Stevenage's [...] "long-term potential" [...] was another key factor behind the move.|$|E

2500|$|In June 2008, Ljungberg {{retired from}} the Swedish National team stating, [...] "The simple fact is the {{physical}} strain of playing on the national team and in club football {{for such a long}} time has finally taken its toll.

They want to win, they want to achieve their goals, and of course so do I. The difference is that I put my focus elsewhere. Bushido teaches that to walk [...] "The Path" [...] is a goal in itself. Results are places on the road that will happen as you take the journey, but they are not the focus.

2500|$|Owen has said, [...] "My screen work often funds my theatre career – that's the way I {{think of}} it. Theatre <b>is</b> <b>where</b> <b>my</b> {{heart and soul}} is, where I feel {{absolutely}} vocational. Creatively, theatre is the most democratic forum for an actor because you have near total control over your performance. It's also where the playwright can never be censored and, as such, {{that makes it a}} truly democratic forum for debate. And the communal experience, the chemistry that you get between actors and audience can be extraordinary. It can move you in a way that film can't. That's the power of theatre at its best." [...] The role that he would most like to play is Macbeth; other roles on his wish-list include Iago in Othello, Brick in Tennessee Williams' Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, Lenny in Harold Pinter's The Homecoming, and Hamlet [...] "as long as no one gives it to me because it's completely daunting".|$|E

2500|$|From 1999 to 2005, {{he was on}} {{the faculty}} of Baylor University, where he was a focus of {{attention}} and controversy. During the academic year 2005–2006, he was briefly the Carl F. H. Henry Professor of Theology and Science at the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville, Kentucky, as well as the first director of the school's new Center for Theology and Science (since replaced by prominent creationist Kurt Wise). The seminary teaches creationism but its professors vary on the details, with most adhering to the young Earth creationist viewpoint of a relatively recent creation which occurred literally as described in Genesis; Dembski does not hold to young Earth creationism (YEC). On his position at Southern, Dembski also remarked that [...] "Theology <b>is</b> <b>where</b> <b>my</b> ultimate passion is and I think that is where I can uniquely contribute." [...] He left Southern in May 2006. Starting in June 2006 he became a professor in philosophy at Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary (SWBTS) in Fort Worth, Texas. Since taking up a position within Southwestern's School of Theology in June 2006, Dembski has taught a number of courses within its Department of Philosophy of Religion. For some of his courses, he requires that his students promote intelligent design on [...] "hostile" [...] websites for course credit. The Southern Baptist Convention operates both seminaries.|$|E
