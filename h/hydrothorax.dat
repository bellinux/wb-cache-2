25|$|Several {{different}} {{cells from}} the mesenchyme can give rise to sex-cord or stromal tumors. These include fibroblasts and endocrine cells. The symptoms of a sex-cord or stromal ovarian tumor can differ from other types of ovarian cancer. Common signs and symptoms include ovarian torsion, hemorrhage from or rupture of the tumor, an abdominal mass, and hormonal disruption. In children, isosexual precocious pseudopuberty may occur with granulosa cell tumors since they produce estrogen. These tumors cause abnormalities in menstruation (excessive bleeding, infrequent menstruation, or no menstruation) or postmenopausal bleeding. Because these tumors produce estrogen, they can cause or occur {{at the same time}} as endometrial cancer or breast cancer. Other sex-cord/stromal tumors present with distinct symptoms. Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors cause virilization and excessive hair growth due to the production of testosterone and androstenedione, which can also cause Cushing's syndrome in rare cases. Also, sex-cord stromal tumors occur that do not cause a hormonal imbalance, including benign fibromas, which cause ascites and <b>hydrothorax.</b> With germ cell tumors, sex cord-stromal tumors are the most common ovarian cancer diagnosed in women under 20.|$|E

5000|$|A pleural {{effusion}} is excess fluid that accumulates in the pleural cavity, the fluid-filled space {{that surrounds the}} lungs.

But the dog was treated with oral itraconazole and topical miconazole, which cured the dog after three weeks of medication.In a study, to test the toxicity of OTA in rats, a different dietary dose of OTA was administered to male Fischer rats. Only chronic administration of OTA manifested as renal carcinogensis in these rats. Low levels of Aspergillus ochraceus contamination caused mycotoxic nephropathy in farm pigs and chickens from Bulgaria. Just as in Bulgaria, the mycotoxicoses produced by A. ochraceus is seen in chickens and other animals elsewhere. In this mycotoxicoses we see suppression of hemopoiesis, acute nephrosis, hepatic necrosis and enteritis. The mechanisms by which this fungus causes the nephrotoxicity in animals are cell apoptosis and lipid peroxidation. In the pig population this fungus has caused a number of diseases. Some of these diseased conditions are, subcutaneous edema, <b>hydrothorax,</b> hydroperitoneum, pulmonary atelectasis, edema of the mesentery and perirenal edema. The edema produced in these animals is so massive that ascites, <b>hydrothorax,</b> and hydropericardium develop, in addition to subcutaneous edena and mesenteric edema. Affected animals die {{within a few hours}} generally.In addition to these conditions, renal lesions have been reported, which consist of tubular degeneration, necrosis, hyaline tubular casts, interstitial fibrosis and tubular cell regeneration. Extensive interstitial fibrosis of the cortical labyrinth was another observation in the swine population. Bovine abortions have also been associated with A. ochraceus infection.|$|E

5000|$|Trocars {{are widely}} used by veterinarians not only for {{draining}} <b>hydrothorax,</b> ascites, or for introducing instruments in laparoscopic surgery, but for acute animal-specific conditions as well. In cases of ruminal tympany (bloat) in cattle, a wide-bore trocar may be passed through the skin into the rumen to release trapped gas. In dogs, a similar procedure is often performed for patients presenting with GDV (Gastric Dilatation-Volvulus) in which a wide-bore trocar is passed through the skin into the stomach to immediately decompress the stomach. Depending on the severity of clinical signs on presentation, this is often performed after pain management has been administered but prior to general anaesthesia. Definitive surgical treatment involves anatomical repositioning of the stomach and spleen followed by a right-sided gastropexy. [...] Depending on the severity, partial gastrectomy and/or splenectomy may be indicated if the relevant tissues have necrosed due to ischemia caused by torsion/avulsion of the supplying vasculature. 72hr post-operative supportive care, fluid therapy and ECG monitoring for cardiac arrhythmias is highly recommended.|$|E

The aorta may be completely torn away from the heart, but patients with such injuries rarely survive very long after the injury; thus it is much more common for hospital staff to treat patients with partially torn aortas. When the aorta is partially torn, it may form a [...] "pseudoaneurysm". In patients who do live long enough to be seen in a hospital, a majority have only a partially torn blood vessel, with the outermost adventitial layer still intact. [...] In some of these patients, the adventitia and nearby structures within the chest may serve to prevent severe bleeding.

40|$|SummaryHepatic <b>hydrothorax</b> {{is defined}} as pleural {{effusion}} with liver cirrhosis but no primary cardiopulmonary disease. Hepatic <b>hydrothorax</b> is often resistant to various therapeutic interventions.

40|$|Abstract Introduction Acute <b>hydrothorax</b> is an {{uncommon}} but a well-recognized complication of peritoneal dialysis. No single test is definitive for diagnosis. Although {{it is not}} a life-threatening condition, <b>hydrothorax</b> often requires abandonment of peritoneal dialysis. Delay in diagnosis can lead to worsening of the clinical status. Case Presentation A 33 -year-old Caucasian woman with lupus, who was successfully treated with temporary peritoneal dialysis 17 years previously, presented with acute dyspnea and a right pleural effusion after recommencing peritoneal dialysis. Investigations eliminated infective, cardiac, and primary respiratory causes. Peritoneal dialysis-related <b>hydrothorax</b> was suggested by biochemistry, and a pleuroperitoneal leak was definitively confirmed by using a Tc- 99 m DTPA (diethylene triamine penta-acetic acid) scintigraphy scan. Subsequently, she underwent video-assisted thoracoscopy-guided talc pleurodesis and was able to return successfully to peritoneal dialysis. Conclusion Although our case is not the first report that describes the occurrence of acute <b>hydrothorax</b> in peritoneal dialysis, it is an important condition to recognize for the wider general medical community. Furthermore, this case demonstrates that peritoneal dialysis can be continued with a <b>hydrothorax,</b> provided the underlying cause can be corrected. We review the literature pertaining to the utility and reliability of different diagnostic approaches to <b>hydrothorax.</b> </p...|$|E
40|$|BackgroundUntil now, the {{pathophysiology}} of hepatic <b>hydrothorax</b> {{has been}} moot.

MethodsWe prospectively studied 11 patients (age, 31 – 73 years; 6 men and 5 women) with refractory hepatic <b>hydrothorax</b> (Child-Pugh class B-C) who underwent thoracoscopic repair of diaphragmatic defects. The diaphragmatic defects were examined intraoperatively. ResultsThe diaphragmatic defects stemming from hepatic <b>hydrothorax</b> were classified into 4 morphologic types: type I, no obvious defect (1 patient); type II, blebs lying on the diaphragm (4 patients); type III, broken defects (fenestrations) in the diaphragm (8 patients); and type IV, multiple gaps in the diaphragm (1 patient). The type of diaphragmatic defect did not correlate with the volume occupied by the pleural effusion in the preoperative chest radiograms.

The severity of liver disease was assessed by the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score. Pleural fluid was analyzed [pH, polymorphonuclear (PMN) leucocyte count, total protein level, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level, glucose level, bacterial culture and cytology]. Spontaneous bacterial pleuritis was diagnosed by positive pleural fluid culture or, if negative, a pleural fluid PMN count > 500 cells/μL without radiographic evidence of pneumonia. ResultsOut of 98 cirrhotic patients with <b>hydrothorax</b> enrolled in the study; 14 (14. 3 %) fullfilled the criteria for the diagnosis of spontaneous bacterial pleuritis. Of those 14 patients; 9 were culture positive and 5 were culture negative.
