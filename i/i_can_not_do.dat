60|$|The {{only things}} {{which we can}} observe {{directly}} being our own sensations, or other feelings, a complete descriptive language would be one in which {{there should be a}} name for every variety of elementary sensation or feeling. Combinations of sensations or feelings may always be described, if we have a name for each of the elementary feelings which compose them; but brevity of description, and clearness (which often depends very much on brevity), are greatly promoted by giving distinctive names not to the elements alone, but also to all combinations which are of frequent recurrence. On this occasion <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>do</b> better than quote from Dr. Whewell(222) some of the excellent remarks which he has made on this important branch of our subject.|$|E

It is in Paris now, one may say, but a crumbling old cross in one portion of it reminds one {{that it was not}} always so. The cross marks the spot where a celebrated troubadour was waylaid and murdered in the fourteenth century. It was in this park that that fellow with an unpronounceable name made the attempt upon the Russian Czar's life last spring with a pistol. The bullet struck a tree. Ferguson showed us the place. Now in America that interesting tree would be chopped down or forgotten within the next five years, but it will be treasured here. The guides will point it out to visitors for the next eight hundred years, and when it decays and falls down they will put up another there and go on with the same old story just the same.|$|E

6000|$|Now it {{does give}} me real pain to speak in this almost unappreciative way of the old masters and their martyrs, because good friends of mine in the ship--friends who do {{thoroughly}} and conscientiously appreciate them and are in every way competent to discriminate between good pictures and inferior ones--have urged me for my own sake not to make public the fact that I lack this appreciation and this critical discrimination myself. I believe that what I have written and may still write about pictures will give them pain, and I am honestly sorry for it. I even promised that I would hide my uncouth sentiments in my own breast. But alas! I never could keep a promise. I do not blame myself for this weakness, because the fault must lie in my physical organization. It is likely that such a very liberal amount of space {{was given to the}} organ which enables me to make promises, that the organ which should enable me to keep them was crowded out. But I grieve not. I like no half-way things. I had rather have one faculty nobly developed than two faculties of mere ordinary capacity.

Patience, Pierre, the population of this region is not so immense. No dense mobs of Nineveh confound all personal identities in Saddle Meadows. Patience; thou shalt see it soon again; catch it passing thee in some green lane, sacred to thy evening reveries. She that bears it can not dwell remote. Patience, Pierre.

Or, if you will, go back and get your gloves, and more especially your cane, and begin your own secret voyage of discovery after it. Your cane, I say; because it will probably be a very long and weary walk. True, just now I hinted, that she that bears it can not dwell very remote; but then her nearness may not be at all conspicuous. So, homeward, and put off thy hat, and let thy cane stay still, good Pierre. Seek not to mystify the mystery so.|$|E

6000|$|Among the {{favorite}} intimates of the king, {{perhaps the most}} prominent was the Duchess of Portsmouth. The king himself had raised her to that rank. She was a French girl, who came over, originally, from the Continent with a party of visitors from the French court. Her beauty, her wit, and her accomplishments soon made her a great favorite with the king, and for many {{years of his life}} she had exerted an unbounded and a guilty influence over him. She was a Catholic. Though not allowed to come to his bedside, she remained in her apartment overwhelmed with grief at the approaching death of her lover, and, strange as it may seem, she was earnestly desirous to obtain for him the spiritual succors which, as a Catholic, she considered essential to his dying in peace. After repeated and vain endeavors made in other ways to accomplish her object, she at length sent for the French ambassador to come to her rooms from the king's chamber, and urged him to do something to save the dying sinner's soul. [...] "He is in heart a Catholic," [...] said she. [...] "I am sure he wishes to receive the Catholic sacraments. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>do</b> any thing, and the Duke of York is so full of business and excitement that he does not think of it.

5000|$|Even with Divine {{and human}} help, as Saint Ambrose of Optina notes, [...] "It {{is easier to}} turn every sinner to repentance than to bring a deluded person to reason". However, there are cases when people were {{instantly}} healed of delusion. There is an episode {{in the life of}} St. Niphon of Athos when he was visited by a monk who accepted a false vision as true and became proud considering himself above the others. Through the prayer of the St. Niphon the monk instantly began to see his pride. Another case occurred with Archimandrite Parthenios, hegumen of St. Paul Monastery at Mount Athos. When he was young, he fell into negligence and stopped reading the monastic rule. This went on for a whole year. In the end, he suddenly cried out: [...] "Mother of God, help me, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>do</b> anything. Make it so that I overcome this state!".

Later that day, she won the silver medal in the floor final behind Simone Biles. At the end of the competition she said, [...] "After I lost on beam, it was so difficult for me to come back. It was fortunate that I came back well on floor, and I was happy to finally perform my routine without mistakes. I want to practice and practice so I can hit all of my elements and add difficulty. Time will tell if I am able to someday beat her (Simone Biles). It's hard to say what the future will bring. Next year is next year...we will see then. But I will try my best." ...|$|E

50|$|In an 1868 {{letter to}} his elderly father (still in Vermont), Wheeler {{described}} the device and his hopes for it this way:You will like to know, perhaps, how I succeeded with the mill. I have {{spent a good deal}} of time on it, experimenting and getting it into good shape. It now suits, so far as the general plan of it is concerned. Two points have especially engaged my attention: 1: To get the mill so as to run nicely. 2 : To simplify and improve the construction of it, so that it will be strong and cheaply built. I have, as yet, put up but two hundred-dollar mills, both of which drive pumps in wells fifty feet deep, and give good satisfaction. Practical mechanics and machinists are much pleased with it, — it is so simple in its construction and accomplishes such important ends. It is self-regulating and will take care of itself in any wind, however gusty and strong it may blow. For deep wells on our prairies to raise water for watering stock, it is a mill, we think, which will be much wanted. It is not yet remunerative, the balance has been out of pocket thus far, but I hope the scale will turn it my favor before long. I suffer, as many inventors do, in not having the means to bring it rapidly into notice. But, as in every new thing, we must be contented to move slowly and wait patiently for results. The mill in its present form, is used only to work pumps. I hope soon to get up another form for driving machinery. I feel quite confident I can get one up in a shape that will give better satisfaction than anything now out, though it must be confessed there are not a few difficulties in the way. So you see I continue to keep busy, and, having something of the versatility common to the Yankees, if <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>do</b> one thing I turn my hand to another. I shall never be able to preach any more, but if I can get up a useful mill and provide for the wants of my family, one part of the end of life will be answered.As Wheeler mentions in the letter, a key aspect of his device, although not part of the patent, was the use of inexpensive interchangeable parts, lowering the overall manufacturing costs.|$|E

40|$|There is {{no denying}} {{the fact that one}} of the most {{important}} scientific discoveries of recent years is that science itself is outgrowing the water-tight compartments in which its youth was spent. It has also become evident that as our store of knowledge is accumulating and as our techniques of investigation are getting refined, the multitude of problems have corres-pondingly increased which cannot be solved within the self-imposed limits of a single discipline. Such a need has been especially felt in sciences which deal with &dquo;man&dquo;. It has been almost established that &dquo;economic man&dquo; can best be understood in the context of &dquo;sociological man&dquo;, or that the &dquo;psychology of man’s personality structure&dquo; can best be analysed in the background of culture and society, or that the contemporary cultural pattern can be clearly understood in terms of short and long range history.

40|$|The first {{association}} {{one gets}} when thinking about independence in is that independence is good. We {{all want to}} be independent and free. For me, coming form Slovenia, this feeling is perhaps even deeper. Slovenia regained its independence after a thousand years of being ruled by Germans, Austrians, Italians, Hungarians and Serbs. Nevertheless, we have always cherished {{the fact that we are}} different and have tried hard to maintain our independence as much as possible. What is interesting is that even though it took us a thousand years to reach independence, we are now trying very hard to join the European union. We are trading our independence for a value of belonging to EU. And the feelings of pride that we are achieving its standards are comparable to the feelings of pride when we became independent from Yugoslavia. This is a strange contradiction. When I lecture about independence to medical students, I do that in a context of family as a unit of care.

But <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>do</b> this! The problem has been kept quiet for long years, and almost everybody have become accomplices of a fact that we have been tried to cover during all those years: the lack of two of the most important skills in the communication, in English's teachers, not only of who we have educated ourselves in the University, and we are trying to transmit a knowledge that we do not acquire. The flaw is not alone our but of the same professors that taught us to be excellent grammarians, without any doubt, but they did not have developed its speaking and listening communication level, therefore we had two of the biggest holes in the development of our professionalism. The easiest thing was closing the School of Languages, not forcing teachers of the university to attend seminaries, workshops to demonstrate they are really qualified to be able to teach to teach. Another of the big problems is the fact of not knowing how to use strategies, TICs or any material resources in our classes.
