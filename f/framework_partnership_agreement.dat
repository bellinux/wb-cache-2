In the year of 2000 the Cotonou Agreement ushered in a new phase in the EU-ACP relations: the EU undertook negotiations on a new <b>framework</b> – Economic <b>Partnership</b> <b>Agreements</b> – for its relationship with the ACP region. The EPAs combine trade, development and human rights dimensions, but also work toward the ultimate goal of ‘eradication of poverty’. Adopting Normative Power Europe as a theoretical framework, the thesis includes a comparative politics methodology and investigates the EPA implications for human rights in three African states. The findings confirm that the EU holds regular dialogue and actively encourages human rights promotion in Africa but is wary to invoke essential elements clauses and suspend aid when it comes to its strategic partners or trading concerns...|$|R

40|$|Social exclusion, the {{polarisation}} of {{the types}} of chances life offers to different groups of young people, is increasing, it is spatially concentrated in some regions and neighbourhoods and is arguably linked to social class. Race and gender can also contribute to this phenomenon, as can other inequalities such as disability. Social inclusion is therefore one of the central goals of European policies towards young people, especially in relation to employment, lifelong learning and vocational guidance. This book presents key findings from a research seminar organised by the European Youth Partnership on the theme of "Social inclusion and Young People" The articles included give a picture of the forms of social exclusion affecting young people nowadays and provide evidence of the progress of strategies to promote social inclusion. As part of the <b>framework</b> <b>partnership</b> <b>agreement</b> on youth between the Council of Europe and the European Commission, the research seminar and this publication support efforts in the fields of youth policy, education and training to build a more inclusive society for all. ...|$|E

40|$|The Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs (OMCYA) {{commissioned}} {{this study}} in September 2008. In the <b>Framework</b> Social <b>Partnership</b> <b>Agreement</b> 2006 - 2015, Towards 2016 (Department of the Taoiseach, 2006), the Irish Government {{committed itself to}} study {{the extent to which}} children undertake ‘inappropriate care roles’ and to establish the extent and degree to which this issue arises and the levels of impact it has on the lives of the children concerned. The Government’s approach was two-fold: (1) it requested the Central Statistics Office (CSO) to undertake additional analysis on the 15 - 17 year-old children identified in the 2006 Census as carers; and (2) it commissioned this study through the OMCYA. Of particular interest to the OMCYA (2008) in its Request for Tender was ‘inappropriate’ care. According to the OMCYA, the responsibilities of such young carers may include, from a young age, personal or intimate care, emotional support, help with mobility, domestic tasks and helping to look after younger siblings. It is believed that young carers differ from other children in terms of the extent of their caring, its nature, the time involved and the outcomes for their development and their social and economic participation. The Request for Tender also noted that, even where the development of services for young carers is advanced, as in the UK, there are still low levels of access to those services. What is more, young carers are, it is argued, a largely hidden group within society and this commissioned study was asked to look at ‘mechanisms to empower these young people to come forward to avail of services’...|$|R

The validity is examined with reference to three recent cases. The matter is not new and relates to the informal amendment of the matrimonial property system. The research reveals that a distinction should be made between <b>partnership</b> <b>agreements</b> concluded before the solemnisation of the marriage {{on the one hand}} and between <b>partnership</b> <b>agreements</b> reached after conclusion of the marriage on the other hand. With reference to the first-mentioned <b>partnership</b> <b>agreements</b> a distinction is made between agreements concluded before the antenuptial contract where the parol evidence rule applies and agreements concluded after the antenuptial contract, where the parol evidence rule does not apply. The first-mentioned <b>partnership</b> <b>agreement</b> is void if it changes the written antenuptial agreement because the parol evidence rule prohibits {{the validity of}} extrinsic evidence.

40|$|ReportExecutive summary Introduction This review collates and summarises the {{literature}} on communication campaign evaluation with relevance to the prevention and control of communicable diseases. The purpose of this review is {{to contribute to the}} evidence base on health communication evaluation research in order to aid public health professionals and researchers in the development of future evaluation strategies. The review is divided into two sections. In the first section the focus is on reviewing evaluations of campaigns undertaken in European Union (EU) and European Economic Area (EEA) countries, however, examples from the wider European region are also included. The second section, addressing challenges posed by campaign evaluation, draws on broader international literature pertaining to the identification of health communication campaign evaluation tools, frameworks and models. It would appear that there has been very few high quality European evaluation studies carried out in the last decade in relation to communicable disease prevention campaigns. Nevertheless, it is evident in reviewing {{the literature}} that there are valuable existing frameworks and guidelines that can help guide and inform evaluation research development. Methodology The review examined the international English-language literature published between 2000 and 2011. The search strategy devised included a review of a number of databases of published academic literature using identified key words which included but were not restricted to: health communication public health campaign and evaluation/effectiveness and communicable infectious disease. In addition, specific journals were extensively reviewed for relevant articles. Results The reviewers retrieved 160 references of which 35 were examples of evaluations of health communication campaigns carried out in EU/EEA Member States. A review of examples of campaign evaluations Interventions labelled health communication campaigns vary greatly in their topic focus, activities, design and exposure and this is demonstrated in the breadth of examples identified. The range of approaches to study design include: systematic and exploratory reviews, experimental and randomised, non-randomised, time-series, multiple method, longitudinal, before-after, cross-sectional, content analysis and cost-effectiveness. The critique of these examples reveals evidence of: weak study designs, small sample sizes, lack of control or comparison groups, lack of theoretical foundation, underuse of formative and process evaluation, lack of reference to capturing unintended effects and evaluation aims and outcome measures that do not correspond with campaign objectives. These limitations are not restricted to the European context and have also been recognised as challenges in the international literature on the evaluation of health communication campaigns. Addressing the challenges of campaign evaluation A number of principles, frameworks and guidelines are outlined in the literature that can assist researchers and public health professionals in planning campaign evaluation. Those identified include: Bauman s guidelines for campaign developers [1], Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (US) Framework for Programme Evaluation [2], Audience, Channel, Message, Evaluation (ACME) Framework developed by Noar [3], the US. National Cancer Institute s, Making Health Communications Programs Work [4], and the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation and Maintenance (RE-AIM) Framework [5]. A number of indicators of success have been consistently cited in the literature as contributing to efficient and effective practice in relation to evaluation of health communication campaigns. Identified indicators of success include: be clear about what is being evaluated, be realistic and explicit about the expected direct and indirect effects, consider potential unintended effects, and use appropriate theory to inform campaign development and evaluation. An important factor identified is that evaluation, including cost effectiveness analysis, should be integrated with formative, process and summative evaluation through campaign planning, development and implementation. Preferred evaluation research designs promoting rigour include: pre-post test, cohort designs, time-series designs and natural experiments. The use of post-test only designs is severely compromised but may be the only option in situations of scarce resources. Acknowledging and documenting the context in which campaigns are implemented will facilitate the transfer of knowledge between the diverse EU/EEA states, and sharing experiences will optimise the use of resources and the development of skills. 1 Literature review on health communication campaign evaluation	TECHNICAL REPORT Conclusion The development of a strong evidence base is imperative to drive effective and efficient policy and practice in the use of health communication campaigns for the prevention and control of communicable diseases. The challenge within the context of EU/EEA countries is to develop capacity for evaluation research within countries, while acknowledging and addressing the barriers to the application of this knowledge base to health communication evaluation practice.
