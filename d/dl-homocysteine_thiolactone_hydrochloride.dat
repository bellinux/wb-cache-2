The hearts were retrogradely perfused according to the Langendorff technique at a 70 [*]cm H 2 O and administered 10 [*]μM DL-Hcy TLHC alone or in combination with 30 [*]μM L-NAME, 10 [*]μM DL-PAG, or 10 [*]μM PPR IX. The following parameters were measured: dp/dt max, dp/dt min, SLVP, DLVP, MBP, HR, and CF. Oxidative stress markers were measured spectrophotometrically in coronary effluent through TBARS, NO 2, O 2 -, and H 2 O 2 concentrations. The administration of DL-Hcy TLHC alone decreased dp/dt max, SLVP, and CF but did not change any oxidative stress parameters. DL-Hcy TLHC with L-NAME decreased CF, O 2 -, H 2 O 2, and TBARS. The administration of DL-Hcy TLHC with DL-PAG significantly increased dp/dt max but decreased DLVP, CF, and TBARS. Administration of DL-Hcy TLHC with PPR IX caused a decrease in dp/dt max, SLVP, HR, CF, and TBARS...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{our study}} was to {{investigate}} the effects of ifenprodil and MK- 801 on <b>D,L-homocysteine</b> <b>thiolactone</b> induced seizures in adult rats. Male Wistar rats were divided into following groups: 1. Saline-treated (C, n= 10); 2. <b>D,L-homocysteine</b> <b>thiolactone</b> 8 mmol/kg, i. p. (H, n= 7); 3. Ifenprodil 20 mg/kg i. p. (IF, n= 8); 4. MK- 801 0. 5 mg/kg, i. p. (MK, n= 8) and 5. Groups that received IF or MK 30 minutes prior to H (IFH, n= 8 and MKH, n= 8). Seizure behavior was assessed by incidence, latency, number and intensity of seizure episodes. Seizure severity was described by a descriptive scale with grades 0 - 4. Lethality in experimental group was recorded 90 min and 24 h upon <b>D,L-homocysteine</b> <b>thiolactone</b> administration. There were no behavioral signs of seizure activity in groups C, IF and MK. Pre-treatment with MK- 801 (MKH) showed tendency to reduced incidence of convulsions, latency to the first seizure onset and the severity of seizure episodes, but statistical significance was not attained comparing to the H group. However, median number of seizure episodes was significantly decreased in MKH (p< 0. 05), comparing to the H group. On the other hand, ifenprodil (IFH) decreased the latency to the first seizure onset and increased the median number of seizure episodes (p< 0. 05). The majority of seizure episodes in IFH (72. 1 %, p< 0. 05) and MKH (73. 1 %, p< 0. 05) groups was grade 2 and significantly different comparing to the H (36. 0 %). Our findings suggest that MK- 801 has a mild anticonvulsive effect on <b>D,L-homocysteine</b> <b>thiolactone</b> induced seizures in adult rats...|$|R
40|$|Homocysteine is a {{significant}} but modifiable risk factor for vascular diseases. As gastrointestinal smooth musculature is similar to blood vessel muscles, we investigated how elevated homocysteine levels affect nitric oxide-mediated neurotransmission in the gut. There is accumulated evidence that a dysfunction of NO neurons in the myenteric plexus may cause various diseases in the gastrointestinal tract such as achalasia, diabetic gastroparesis and infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis. In the present study, we aimed to assess the effects of homocysteine on NO-mediated responses in vitro, and {{to examine the effects}} of <b>DL-homocysteine</b> <b>thiolactone</b> on the spontaneous motility of rat duodenum and nitrergic neurotransmission. <b>DL-homocysteine</b> <b>thiolactone</b> concentration of 10 μmol/L leads to the immediate increase in tone, amplitude and frequency of spontaneous movements in isolated rat duodenum. L-NAME (30 μmol/L) leads to an increase in basal tone, amplitude and frequency of spontaneous contractions. The relaxations induced by EFS were significantly reduced in duodenal segments incubated in <b>DL-homocysteine</b> <b>thiolactone</b> compared with the control group. EFS-induced relaxations were inhibited by L-NAME in both experimental and control groups. These results suggest that a high level of homocysteine causes an important impairment of non-adrenergic non-cholinergic innervation of the rat duodenum.

Bacteriol. 85 : 1339 – 1345. 1963. —The {{requirement for}} l-cystine {{in both the}} production of Coxsackie B 3 virus in cultured monkey heart cells and in prolonging {{the survival of the}} cultured monkey heart cells is demonstrated. d-Cystine, dl-homocystine, dl-allo-cystathionine, <b>dl-homocysteine</b> <b>thiolactone,</b> 2 -mercaptoethlyamine, allylglycine, 3, 3 ′-dithiopropionic acid, and dl-ethionine could not replace l-cystine in either supporting Coxsackie B 3 virus production or prolonging monkey heart cell culture survival time. By their ineffectiveness, these compounds suggest the specificity of the l-cystine requirement. Allylglycine, 3, 3 ′-dithiopropionic acid, and dl-ethionine were likewise incapable of inhibiting the l-cystine effect in supporting both virus production and cell survival. Prolonged starvation of cell cultures prior to virus inoculation failed to reveal any additional marked nutritional requirements, but rather tended to accentuate the l-cystine requirement for virus production. Increased cell starvation did, however, lead to the establishment of a latent Coxsackie B 3 virus infection of cultured monkey heart cells, the activation of which is l-cystine–dependent...|$|R

After passing 11 CH 3 I by helium (15  mL/min) through the tC 18 Sep-Pak cartridge, the reaction mixture was eluted off the cartridge with phosphate buffer (50  mM, 2  mL) and purified by HPLC. The eluate fraction (~ 1.5  mL) containing 11 C–MET was collected, diluted with HPLC eluant (12  mL), and passed through a Millex-GS sterile filter into a final product vial.|$|R
40|$|Hyperhomocysteinemia {{produces}} atherosclerotic lesions {{with characteristic}} endothelial desquamation and intimal smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation. In vitro, homocysteine is cytotoxic to endothelial cells and recent observations {{suggest that it}} may directly stimulate VSMC proliferation. Estrogen, on the other hand, inhibits VSMC proliferation both in vivoand in vitro. We evaluated the effect of estradiol 17 β(E 2 β) on homocysteine-induced VSMC proliferation in arterial segments from the rat thoracic aorta. Segments were placed overnight in Dulbecco's Minimum Essential Medium, supplemented with gentamycin(25 μg/ml), glutamine (2 mM) and 0. 4 % fatal bovine serum, before incubation for 30 hours with <b>DL-homocysteine</b> <b>thiolactone</b> (0. 1 – 5. 0 mM). Radiolabelled thymidine uptake was assessed in intact and deendothelialized arterial segments, in presence of E 2 β(30 nM) or vehicle (1 % ethanol). In deendothelialized segments homocysteine elicited a concentration-dependent increase in 3 H-thymidine uptake, expressed as cpm/mg protein. Thymidine uptake increased from a basal value of 8694 ± 1465 to 36338 ± 2025, at 5 mM homocysteine concentration (p< 0. 01). Intact arterial segments showed a significantly attenuated response to homocysteine stimulation. On the other hand, incubation of deendothelialized segments with E 2 β(30 nM) caused a significant inhibition of homocysteinestimulated response, without affecting basal 3 H-thymidine incorporation. These results provide evidence for a direct stimulatory effect of homocysteine on VSMC proliferation in rat aortic segments. Further, our data show estradiol 17 βprotects against homocysteine-induced vascular injury, possibly via a direct effect on VSMC...|$|R
40|$|The {{ability of}} S -adenosyl-l-homocysteine (AdoHcy) to inhibit {{biologic}} transmethylation reactions in vitro has {{led us to}} explore the possibility of pharmacologically manipulating AdoHcy levels in vivo and examining the consequences of these alterations on the transmethylation of some biogenic amines. Swiss-Webster mice were injected intraperitoneally with different doses of adenosine (Ado) and <b>d,l-homocysteine</b> <b>thiolactone</b> (Hcy) and were killed at various times thereafter. S -Adenosyl-l-methionine (AdoMet) and AdoHcy concentrations were determined by using a modified isotope dilution-ion exchange chromatography-high pressure liquid chromatography technique sensitive to less than 10 pmol. Increasing doses of Ado + Hcy (50 - 1000 mg/kg of each) produced a dose-related increase in blood, liver, and brain AdoHcy levels. At a dose level of 200 mg/kg Ado + Hcy, AdoHcy levels were markedly elevated, with minimal concomitant perturbations of AdoMet. This elevation was maximal 40 min after giving Ado + Hcy, returning to control values within 6 h. Ado + Hcy treatment resulted in decreased activities of catechol- O -methyltransferase, histamine- N -methyltransferase, and AdoHcy hydrolase in vitro. The cerebral catabolism of intraventricularly administered [3 H]histamine (HA) was decreased in a dose-related manner by Ado + Hcy treatment as evidenced by higher amounts of nonutilized [3 H]HA in brain, concurrent decreases in [3 H]methylhistamine formation, and decreases in the transmethylation conversion index. Steady state levels of HA also showed dose-related increases after Ado + Hcy treatment. It is concluded that injections of Ado + Hcy can markedly elevate AdoHcy levels in vivo, which can, in turn, decrease the rate of transmethylation reactions...|$|R
