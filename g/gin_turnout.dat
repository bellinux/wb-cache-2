40|$|A field {{experiment}} {{was conducted in}} 2000 to evaluate narrow (30 ") and ultra narrow (10 ") row spacing cotton production systems. The study was conducted at a commercial farm located near Buckeye, AZ. The experimental design was a randomized complete block with three replications. The treatments included 10 " row spacings that were harvested with a finger stripper, 30 " row spacings harvested with a brush stripper, and 30 " row spacings harvested with a spindle picker. Plant growth and development was not affected by row spacing throughout the growing season. No significant difference was observed for lint yield however, <b>gin</b> <b>turnout</b> was slightly lower for stripper harvested treatments. Fiber quality measurements were similar for both row spacing {{with the exception of}} fiber micronaire which was lower in stripper harvested treatments. Bark was a major problem with stripper harvested treatments with at least 92 % of bales receiving a discount compared with 36 % of spindle harvested bales...|$|E
40|$|Studies were {{conducted}} in 2002, 2004, and 2005 at the University of Arizona Maricopa Agricultural Center located near Maricopa, Arizona. Objectives {{of the study were}} to evaluate the efficacy of contact herbicides for defoliation as a second application and evaluate any potential improvement in lint return (<b>gin</b> <b>turnout),</b> fiber quality and overall lint value. In 2002, Delta and Pine cultivar 458 BR was planted on 17 April. In 2004 and 2005 Delta and Pine cultivar 449 BR was planted on 13 May and 12 April respectively. In all years, plots were 13. 33 ft wide and 25 ft long and treatments were arranged in a randomized complete block with four replications. Irrigation was terminated at cutout (NAWF= 5) and defoliation treatments were initiated 22 days later. All plots received an initial defoliation treatment of thidiazuron plus diuron (Ginstar) at 8 oz/A. In 2002 and 2004, follow-up applications occurred seven days after initial defoliation, and included the following treatments: paraquat (Gramoxone Max) at 10. 7 oz/A plus nonionic surfactant at 0. 25 %v/v, flumiclorac (Resource) at 8 oz/A plus crop oil concentrate (COC) at 1 % v/v, pyraflufen (ET) at 1. 5 oz/A plus COC at 1 % v/v or carfentrazone (Aim) at 1. 0 oz/A plus COC at 1 % v/v. In 2005, follow-up application occurred eight days after initial defoliation and included the same treatments as 2002 and 2004 with the addition of fluthiacetmethyl (Blizzard) at 0. 5 oz/A plus COC at 1 % v/v and an adjustment of the Gramoxone Max rate to 20 oz/A. For comparison purposes, in all years, one treatment did not receive a follow-up application. In 2002 and 2004, percent defoliation was significantly higher in treatments that received an application of Ginstar followed by Aim, Resource, ET or Gramoxone Max compared with a single application of Ginstar. However, follow-up treatment with Gramoxone Max at 10. 7 oz/A provided significantly less defoliation than Aim or ET treatments. In 2005, defoliation was significantly increased by follow-up application with all of the contact herbicides evaluated, No significant differences were observed in <b>gin</b> <b>turnout,</b> lint yield or loan value in the years these variables were evaluated...|$|E
40|$|Plant {{breeding}} programs {{involving a}} wide range of crop plants routinely practice selection (directly or indirectly) for genotypes that display stability for a given trait or set of traits across testing environments through the genotype evaluation process. Genotype stability for trait performance is a direct measure of the presence and effect of genotype × environment interactions, which result from the differential performance of a genotype or cultivar across environments. The genotype evaluation process also requires selection of the proper field trial locations that best represent the target environments the breeding program is directed toward. In this study,we assessed the extent to which genotype × environment interactions affected agronomic performance (lint yield, <b>gin</b> <b>turnout)</b> andfiber quality (fiber length, fiber strength, uniformity index,micronaire, fiber elongation) in a series of cotton (Gossypiumhirsutum) performance trials in 12 location–year environments in South Carolina. Genotype × environment interactions affecting lint yield were larger in higher yielding environments, while interactions for fiber strength were greater for genotypes with lower mean fiber strength values. Two regions within the South Carolina cotton production areas were identified as proper testing locations for lint yield performance, while testing for fiber strength can be accomplished in any location within the statewide cotton production areas.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine the interaction of sowing date and plant density in Nazilli 84 cotton cultivar in Aegean Region. It was found that delaying sowing date significantly decreased seed cotton yield but the differences among plant densities were non-significant in both cultivars. The correlation coefficients and path analysis results among yield components, fiber technological characteristics and dry matter accumulation at first true leaf-boll retention showed that the <b>ginning</b> <b>turnout</b> had the highest positive direct effect on seed cotton yield. It was concluded that when the plant has less boll retention, dry matter accumulations between flowering-boll retention had adverse effect on seed cotton yiel...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} carried out to {{determine}} the yield, yield components and the quality characters of two cotton cultivars Ogosta 644 and Sayar 314 and their generations of F 1, F 2, BC 1 P 1, BC 1 P 2 obtained by crossing them in the years between 1996 - 1998 in Diyarbakir. In the study, the number of boll per plant, seed cotton weight of per boll, seed cotton yield, plant height, rate of first picking, <b>ginning</b> <b>turnout,</b> 100 seed weight, fibre fineness, fibre length and fibre strength were determined and heterosis, heritability, F 2 depression, F 2 deviation were estimated. As a result, {{it was determined that}} seed cotton weight of per boll, 100 seed weight, fibre fineness and fibre strength had high heritability degrees, the number of bolls per plant had lower heritability degrees, while the other characters had moderately heritability degrees. The characters which were high heritability degrees have been suggested some possibilities in obtaining required genotypes by selection in early generations (F 2, F 3); delayed selection which had low heritability strongly recommended for some characteristics...|$|R
40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the effectiveness of}} defoliating at various heat unit accumulations: 630 HU, 730 HU, 830 HU, 930 HU, 1030 HU, 1130 HU and 1330 HU and impact on lint yield and fiber quality. American Upland cotton variety DP 449 BR was planted on 12 April 2005 at the University of Arizona Maricopa Agriculture Center in Maricopa, Arizona. The experimental design was a split plot with four replications of each of seven defoliation timings. Final irrigation occurred on 05 August 2005. When heat unit accumulation reached 630 HU (on 20 August 2005), 730 HU (on 01 September 2005), 830 HU (on 04 September 2005), 930 HU (on 08 September 2005), 1030 HU (on 12 September 2005), 1130 HU (on 19 September 2005) and 1330 HU (on 27 September 2005) using the 86 / 55 F model chemical defoliants were applied. A mixture of Def (tribufos) at 24 oz/A, Dropp (thidiazuron) at 0. 2 lb/A and Prep (ethephon) at 24 oz/A was applied using a high clearance research sprayer. The earliest treatments (630 and 730 HU accumulated) had significantly fewer open bolls at defoliation than those that received later treatments. At harvest, this trend disappears: the latest application (at 1330 HU) had significantly fewer open bolls than any other timing. Seven days after defoliant application (7 DAT), highest levels of defoliation were observed in the following treatments in descending order: 830 HU, 630 HU, 1130 HU, 930 HU and 730 HU followed by 1030 HU and 1330 HU. At harvest, {{there were no significant}} differences among mean defoliation percentages with the exception of the 1330 HU timing, which was significantly less defoliated than any of the other timings. Highest lint yield and <b>gin</b> <b>turnout</b> were observed in the earliest defoliation timings, lowest in the later timings. No significant differences in micronaire, length or uniformity were observed between defoliation timings. Differences did occur in fiber strength which was highest in earlier timings and lowest in the last timing, but all were above the discount level...|$|E

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Breeders have made numerous improvements in upland cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) over the past century. The future improvement of yield and quality in upland cotton may rely on greater use of exotic accessions to expand the genetic diversity. The utilization of primitive accessions of Gossypium hirsutum L. has been limited due to their photoperiodic nature, but the release of day-neutral BC?F? lines of these primitive accessions, converted race stocks (CRS), will aid in the investigation and incorporation of variability into modern breeding strains. The primary or initial breeding method used for the introgression of exotic traits from the CRS should be the backcross. Twenty-three populations, each containing a CRS donor parent, TAM 94 L- 25 recurrent parent, their F? generation, and their BC?F? generation were grown in 2000 and 2001. TX 0074 was the only CRS to produce average micronaire readings lower than or equal to the recurrent parent in the BC 1 F 2 generation. The upper half mean fiber length of the recurrent parent was recovered in eight BC?F? populations compared to only one F? population. There was little variability for short fiber content existing in these CRS/TAM 94 L- 25 and CRS/* 2 /TAM 94 L- 25 populations. Eleven BC?F? populations compared with seven F? populations had <b>gin</b> <b>turnout</b> percentages that resembled those of TAM 94 L- 25. A single backcross resulted in the recovery of six populations with either the same or shorter plant height as TAM 94 L- 25 while only one F? population averaged the plant height of the TAM 94 L- 25 parent. Seventeen BC?F? populations exhibited the inter-node length of TAM 94 L- 25 while only two F? populations equaled TAM 94 L- 25 for inter-node length. Broad sense heritability values of 0. 50 or higher were observed along with mean values equal to the desirable parent for seven traits, micronaire, fiber bundle strength, fiber uniformity index, fiber bundle elongation, short fiber content, and seed cotton yield, when TX 0017 was crossed with TAM 94 L- 25...|$|E
