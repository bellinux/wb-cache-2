5|$|Stephen Báthory died on 13 December 1586. Andrew left Rome and <b>hurried</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Poland. He {{inherited}} {{the domains of}} Gyalu, Nagyenyed and Örményes in Transylvania (now Gilău, Aiud and Armeniș in Romania) from his uncle. Stephen Báthory stipulated that Gyalu should serve the reestablishment of the Roman Catholic bishopric in Transylvania.|$|E
5|$|The {{first such}} campaign, an {{attempted}} reconquest of the Emirate of Crete led by Theoktistos in person, made initial gains, but ultimately ended in disaster. After scoring {{a victory over}} the Arabs in Crete, Theoktistos learned of a rumour that Theodora intended to name a new emperor, possibly her brother Bardas. Theoktistos <b>hurried</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Constantinople, where he discovered that the rumour was false, but in his absence, the Byzantine army in Crete was routed by the Arabs.|$|E
5|$|Commander George Eyre {{took over}} command of Speedy in February1794. Speedy {{supported}} the siege and capture of Bastia, after which Eyre {{was ordered to}} join Diadem off Nice. While making his way there on 9June, he ran into a French fleet under Rear-Admiral Pierre Martin, which had sailed from Toulon several days earlier. Eyre attempted to escape, but the wind and sea favoured the larger vessels, and Speedy was chased down and captured. Eyre was brought aboard Admiral Martin's flagship {{and was told that}} the National Convention had recently ordered that no quarter should be given to the English or Hanoverians, and that had Martin's ship been first alongside, he would have sunk Speedy. The sudden appearance of a British fleet curtailed the interview, and the French <b>hurried</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Gourjean roadstead outside Toulon, taking Speedy and the captured British crew with them.|$|E

5|$|Marshal Zhukov {{was rewarded}} for his support with full {{membership}} in the Presidium, but Khrushchev feared his popularity and power. In October, the defense minister was sent {{on a tour of}} the Balkans, as Khrushchev arranged a Presidium meeting to dismiss him. Zhukov learned what was happening, and <b>hurried</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Moscow, only to be formally notified of his dismissal. At a Central Committee meeting several weeks later, not a word was said in Zhukov's defense. Khrushchev completed the consolidation of power by arranging for Bulganin's dismissal as premier in favor of himself (Bulganin was appointed to head the Gosbank) and by establishing a USSR Defense Council, led by himself, effectively making him commander in chief. Though Khrushchev was now preeminent, he did not enjoy Stalin's absolute power.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of Carr Gomm's letters to The Times, Merrick's case {{attracted}} the notice of London's high society. One person who took a keen interest was actress Madge Kendal. Although she probably never met him in person, she was responsible for raising funds and public sympathy for Merrick. She sent him photographs of herself and employed a basket weaver {{to go to his}} rooms and teach him the craft. Other ladies and gentlemen of high society did visit him however, bringing gifts of photographs and books. He reciprocated with letters and hand made gifts of card models and baskets. Merrick enjoyed these visits and became confident enough to converse with people who passed his windows. A young man, Charles Taylor, the son of the engineer responsible for modifying Merrick's rooms, spent time with him, sometimes playing the violin. Occasionally, he grew bold enough to leave his small living quarters and would explore the hospital. When he was discovered, he was always <b>hurried</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> his quarters by the nurses, who feared that he might frighten the patients.|$|E
5|$|Gamble's men mounted {{determined}} {{resistance and}} delaying tactics from behind fence posts with rapid fire from their breech-loading carbines. It {{is a modern}} myth that they were armed with multi-shot repeating carbines. Nevertheless, {{they were able to}} fire two or three times faster than a muzzle-loaded carbine or rifle. Also, the breech-loading design meant that Union troops did not have to stand to reload and could do so safely behind cover. This was a great advantage over the Confederates, who still had to stand to reload, thus providing an easier target. But this was so far a relatively bloodless affair. By 10:20 a.m., the Confederates had reached Herr Ridge and had pushed the Federal cavalrymen east to McPherson Ridge, when the vanguard of the I Corps finally arrived, the division of Maj. Gen. James S. Wadsworth. The troops were led personally by Gen. Reynolds, who conferred briefly with Buford and <b>hurried</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> bring more men forward.|$|E

25|$|In August 1810, Sébastiani's IV Corps {{appeared}} before the city of Murcia. The French corps commander found Blake's troops manning powerful defensive works around the city. When he learned that Spanish guerillas had captured two small Andalusian ports and were {{on the outskirts of}} Granada, Sébastiani quickly abandoned his attempt to capture Murcia and <b>hurried</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> save Granada.|$|E
25|$|Upon his return, {{some of the}} men {{expressed}} {{doubts about}} Boone's loyalty, since after surrendering the salt making party he had apparently lived quite happily among the Shawnees for months. Boone responded by leading a preemptive raid against the Shawnee village of Paint Lick Town {{on the other side of}} the Ohio River. This accomplished little, and the raiding party <b>hurried</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Boonesborough when they discovered that Blackfish had marched south.|$|E
25|$|The colony was {{now without}} a governor. Pérez Dasmariñas {{had brought with}} him to the Philippines a royal order {{directing}} him to choose a temporary successor in the event of his own death. He had shown this order to various prominent Spaniards in the colony, implying to each that he was the designated successor. In particular, both the governor's son and conquistador Captain Estevan Rodríguez de Figueroa expected the appointment. Both were on the expedition to the Moluccas, and both <b>hurried</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Manila to take command of the colony.|$|E

25|$|As {{smallpox}} {{broke out}} among his troops Governor Lyttleton feared the desertion {{of most of}} his force and <b>hurried</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Charleston in great disorder. The Cherokee were still angry, and continued to attack frontier settlements into 1760. In February 1760, they attacked Fort Prince George {{in an attempt to}} rescue their hostages. The fort's commander was killed. The garrison, in panicked retaliation, massacred all of the hostages. And two days later the fort fired artillery into the town of Keowee. The Cherokee now attacked Fort Ninety Six, but it withstood the siege. However, settlements and lesser posts in the South Carolina backcountry quickly fell to Cherokee raids.|$|E
25|$|On {{learning}} of Conrad's assassination, Henry of Champagne, who had meanwhile returned to Acre, <b>hurried</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Tyre. Henry, {{who was the}} nephew of both Richard of England and Philip of France, was acclaimed king by the barons and the citizens of Tyre. According to Ernoul, Henry was hesitant, because Isabella was pregnant, possibly with a son. The barons and the citizens, continued Ernoul, promised him that his children would inherit the Kingdom of Jerusalem to convince him to accept the crown. The betrothal of Henry and Isabella was announced two days after Conrad's death. The marriage was celebrated in Acre on 10 May 1192.|$|E
25|$|Lucius Volumnius <b>hurried</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Samnium {{because the}} proconsulships of Quintus Fabius and Publius Decius {{were about to}} expire. Meanwhile, the Samnites raised new troops and raided Roman territories and allies in Campania around Capua and Falernium. Lucius Volumnius headed for Campania and was {{informed}} that the Samnites {{had gone back to}} Samnium to take their loot. He caught up with their camp and defeated a force which was made unfit to fight by the burden of their loot. The Samnite commander, Staius Minatius, was attacked by the prisoners of the Samnites and delivered to the consul. The senate decided to establish the colonies of Minturnae on the mouth of the River Liris and Sinuessa further inland, in the former territory of the Ausoni.|$|E

25|$|The Elector John Sigismund, Maria Eleonora's father, died on 23 December 1619, and the {{prospect}} of a Swedish marriage seemed gone with him. In the spring of 1620, however, stubborn Gustavus Adolphus arrived in Berlin. The Electress Dowager maintained an attitude of reserve and even refused to grant the Swedish king a personal meeting with Maria Eleonora. All those who were present, however, noticed the princess's interest in the young king. Afterwards, Gustavus Adolphus made a round of other Protestant German courts with the professed intention of inspecting a few matrimonial alternatives. On his return to Berlin, the Electress Dowager seems to have become completely captivated by the charming Swedish king. After plighting his troth to Maria Eleonora, Gustavus Adolphus <b>hurried</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Sweden to make arrangements for the reception of his bride.|$|E
25|$|Stephen Báthory, {{who succeeded}} Zápolya in 1571, {{protected}} {{the interests of}} György Bocskai's orphaned children. At Báthory's request, FerdinandI's successor, Maximilian, restored to them their father's former estates in Zemplén County. The teenager Stephen Bocskai may have already moved to Maximilian's courtit is known that a son of Krisztina Sulyok was reportedly living in Vienna in 1571but {{it is certain that}} he was living in the royal court when his elder brother, Jeromos, died in 1572, because he <b>hurried</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Kismarja from Vienna to console his mother. Initially, he served as a page in the royal court. He received a salary from 1574. He again came back to Kismarja in the summer of 1575 to see his ailing mother and to administer his estates. About a year later, he returned to Vienna where he was made a steward.|$|E

She <b>hurried</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Paris, which was threatened by an approaching German army. In September, Bernhardt was asked by the Minister of War to move to a safer place. She departed for a villa on the Bay of Arcachon, where her physician discovered that gangrene had developed on her injured leg. She was transported to Bordeaux, where on 22 February 1915, a surgeon amputated her leg almost to the hip. She refused the idea of an artificial leg, crutches, or a wheelchair, and instead was usually carried in a palanquin she designed, supported by two long shafts and carried by two men. She had the chair decorated in the Lous XV style, with white sides and gilded trim.|$|E

500|$|After the gunshots ended, Altgens saw several {{armed men}} {{running up the}} grassy slope between Elm Street and the {{railroad}} tracks; he crossed the street toward the activity {{to see if he}} could get a picture of anyone being arrested.

500|$|Even {{before the}} ill-fated rescue attempt, IOC {{officials}} began conferring.

Just before 4pm, Brundage called off {{the remainder of the}} day's events, and announced a memorial service honoring those who had already died for the following morning. Many Olympic leaders were critical of Brundage for his participation in the discussions with the government, feeling that this should have been left for the authorities and the local organizing committee, but all supported the memorial service, which was held the following day in the Olympic Stadium. There, before the audience in the stadium and the millions watching on television, Brundage offered what Guttmann called [...] "the credo of his life": ...|$|E
