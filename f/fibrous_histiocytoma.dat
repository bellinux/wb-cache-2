40|$|The {{present study}} reports the induction, histopathology, immunocytochemistry, growth pattern and proliferative {{behaviour}} of mesenchymal tumours of the urinary bladder of rats induced {{by a single}} intravesical dose (5 mg/kg/body weight) of N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU). In 14 of 283 female Wistar rats (incidence: 4. 9 %). 16 non-epithelial tumours had developed after an experimental period of 14 months. The most common histological type induced was of fibrohistiocytic origin (eight benign-appearing and three malignant <b>fibrous</b> <b>histiocytomas).</b> Furthermore, two pure histiocytomas (one benign and one malignant) and three capillary and cavernous haemangiomas were produced. Since no metastases occurred and no clear-cut distinction between a merely expansive and a truly invasive growth was possible, the diagnosis of malignancy {{was based on the}} degree of cellular atypia and the mitotic activity. The benign-appearing <b>fibrous</b> <b>histiocytomas</b> showed a mean mitotic index of 0. 06 % and the malignant <b>fibrous</b> <b>histiocytomas</b> of 0. 34 %. The mitotic activity of the malignant histiocytoma was threefold (0. 78 %) as high as in the benign-appearing histiocytoma (0. 25 %). There exist close morphological similarities between the induced mesenchymal tumours in the rat and those occurring in the human bladder. Although the spectrum of histological types of mesenchymal tumours seen in the rat bladder was narrower than that encountered in man, MNU seems suitable for further studying the histogenesis, histopathology and biology of experimentally induced non-epithelial bladder neoplasms to gain information for {{a better understanding of the}} pathogenesis of human disease...|$|R
40|$|The {{authors have}} {{investigated}} a possible relationship between tumor cells of malignant <b>fibrous</b> <b>histiocytomas</b> (MFHs) and histiocytes. This relationship was studied {{by means of}} immunophenotyping using monoclonal antibodies specific for the monocyte cell lineage (FMC- 17, Mac- 1, OKM- 1, Leu-M 1, and lysozyme) and mono- and polyclonal antibodies specific for fibroblasts (respectively, FIB- 86 and FSG). The immunophenotypes of the MFH tumor cells were {{compared with those of}} tumor cells of "true" histiocytic tumors. Monocyte lineage-specific determinants could be demonstrated in varying amounts on cells of the "true" histiocytic tumors but not on cells of MFH or other soft-tissue tumors. The reverse was true for determinants on fibroblasts. The absence of these determinants on malignant histiocytes, and their presence on MFH (and also on benign <b>fibrous</b> <b>histiocytomas,</b> fibrosarcomas, schwannomas, osteosarcomas, hemangiosarcomas, leio- and rhabdomyosarcomas) supported the conclusion that MFH tumor cells originate from mesenchymal cells which do not belong to the mononuclear phagocytic system.

40|$|Myxoid liposarcomas have {{a unique}} and {{specific}} t(12; 16) (q 13;p 11) chromosomal translocation. The breakpoint has recently been identified and shown to involve the TLS/FUS gene on chromosome 16 and the CHOP gene on chromosome 12. This translocation causes fusion of these genes resulting in {{the expression of a}} novel chimeric TLS/FUS-CHOP message. Using the polymerase chain reaction with primer sets derived from sequences of TLS/FUS and CHOP cDNAs, we could amplify three types of the fusion transcripts from seven of seven samples of myxoid and round cell liposarcomas. In six of the seven positive samples, two kinds of chimeric messenger RNAs were found that have been reported previously. However, the last sample had a novel chimeric message that had an extra sequence of 33 bp derived from the TLS/FUS gene. Thus, it was shown that these fusion transcripts had a varying extent of the sequence of TLS/FUS gene incorporated {{at the site of the}} fusion. However, the TLS/FUS-CHOP fusion transcripts were not detected in two pleomorphic liposarcomas or in three myxoid variants of malignant <b>fibrous</b> <b>histiocytomas.</b> Our findings indicate that in liposarcomas TLS/FUS-CHOP fusion transcripts have variations at the junction of chimeric messages, which was the case for Ewing's sarcoma. Detection of the chimeric message by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction was also suggested to be a useful approach for the diagnosis of myxoid and round cell liposarcomas that have (12; 16) translocation, and for distinguishing them from pleomorphic liposarcoma and myxoid variant of malignant <b>fibrous</b> <b>histiocytomas...</b>|$|R
40|$|Forty-eight {{benign and}} {{malignant}} soft tissue tumors were investigated immunohistologically {{for the presence}} of laminin, a glycoprotein of basement membranes.

40|$|AIM: To {{describe}} the clinicopathological features of 33 aneurysmal <b>fibrous</b> <b>histiocytomas</b> (AFH), including five cases with a haemangiopericytoma-like pattern. METHODS: Thirty three cases of AFH were studied by using routine histology and immunohistochemistry for factor XIIIa, the "cell activity marker" E 9 (anti-metallothionein), NK 1 C 3 (CD 57), smooth muscle actin (SMA), factor VIII, ulex europaeus agglutinin, JC 70 A (CD 31), and QBEND 10 (CD 34). The time dependent variation in histopathological features was evaluated by statistical methods (Pearson chi 2, likelihood ratio chi 2). RESULTS: Of the AFHs, 29 of 33 {{occurred on the}} extremities of adults (age range 30 to 50 years), six of which were associated with rapid growth, probably caused by trauma, and pain. Twenty one lesions {{were thought to be}} vascular and/or melanocytic lesions, including two melanomas, because of a bluish-black and/or cystic appearance. Histologically, large areas of haemorrhage, up to 50 % of the tumour bulk, lacking an endothelial lining were seen in otherwise typical <b>fibrous</b> <b>histiocytomas.</b> Five cases resembled nodular stages of Kaposi's sarcoma. Variable haemosiderin deposition in histiocytes (18 / 33) and giant cells (11 / 33) was suggestive of haemosiderotic histiocytoma. A haemangiopericytoma-like pattern was seen in five otherwise indistinguishable cases. On immunohistochemistry, variable reactivity was seen for factor XIIIa (18 / 30), with E 9 (18 / 30), NK 1 C 3 (19 / 30), and for SMA (14 / 30), but labelling for vascular markers was not detected. Early lesions without iron deposition were factor XIIIa positive; late lesions with iron deposition were factor XIIIa negative. Labelling for SMA correlated with prominent sclerosis. CONCLUSION: AFHs, including a haemangiopericytoma-like variant, have a characteristic time dependent histological and immunophenotypic profile, clearly different from nodular type Kaposi's sarcoma...|$|R
