2500|$|With the reawakening of town life in {{the twelfth}} century, a wool market, a woollens weaving industry, and the market for cloth all profited from the shelter of city walls, where {{surpluses}} could be safely accumulated under the patronage of the counts of Flanders. The city's entrepreneurs reached out to make economic colonies of England and Scotland's wool-producing districts. English contacts brought Normandy grain and Gascon wines. Hanseatic ships filled the harbor, {{which had to be}} expanded beyond Damme to Sluys to accommodate the new cog-ships. In 1277, the first merchant fleet from Genoa appeared in the port of Bruges, first of the merchant colony that made Bruges the main link to the trade of the Mediterranean. This development opened not only the trade in spices from the Levant, but also advanced commercial and financial techniques and a <b>flood</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> that soon took over the banking of Bruges. The [...] opened in 1309 (most likely the first stock exchange in the world) and developed into the most sophisticated money market of the Low Countries in the 14th century. By the time Venetian galleys first appeared, in 1314, they were latecomers. Numerous foreign merchants were welcomed in Bruges, such as the Castilian wool merchants who first arrived in the 13th century. After the Castilian wool monopoly ended, the Basques, many hailing from Bilbao (Biscay), thrived as merchants (wool, iron commodities, etc.) and established their own commercial consulate in Bruges by the mid-15th century. The foreign merchants expanded the city's trading zones. They maintained separate communities governed by their own laws until the economic collapse after 1700.|$|E
40|$|We {{find that}} VC-backed firms {{receiving}} their initial investment in hot markets {{are less likely}} to IPO, but conditional on going public are valued higher on the day of their IPO, have more patents and have more citations to their patents. Our results suggest that VCs invest in riskier and more innovative startups in hot markets (rather than just worse firms). This is true even for the most experienced VCs. Furthermore, our results suggest that the <b>flood</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> in hot markets also plays a causal role in shifting investments to more novel startups- by lowering the cost of experimentation for early stage investors and allowing them to make riskier, more novel, investments...|$|E

50|$|The main river, and {{connection}} to open sea through the Río de la Plata is the Paraná River. There are also other tributaries to the Paraná including the Salado del Norte, the Carcarañá and the Arroyo del Medio. The plain lands {{tend to be}} flooded after heavy rains due {{to the growth of}} the Paraná and Salado rivers. In 2003 a rapid rise of the Salado produced a catastrophic <b>flood</b> <b>of</b> the <b>capital</b> and many communities in the north-center of the province, prompting the evacuation of no fewer than 100,000 people and major economic losses. In 2007, several days <b>of</b> heavy rainfall <b>flooded</b> more than 60 towns in the center and south of the province, including sections of Santa Fe and Rosario, causing {{tens of thousands of people}} to be evacuated, crop losses, and widespread damage to the physical infrastructure of the area.|$|R
25|$|One {{week after}} the severe <b>flooding,</b> the <b>capital</b> <b>of</b> the state was in {{bankruptcy}} in part because flooding has affected various settlements. According to the local Chamber of Commerce, almost 15,000 establishments in downtown Villahermosa suffered losses of 100% in their infrastructure and inventories. This situation might cause a severe recession in the local economy, because many of these business beside having lost all their invested capital, have obligations with their suppliers, payments delayed {{with the government and}} workers' wages.|$|R
40|$|This article {{examines}} the specific mechanisms that have allowed global financial markets to penetrate deeply into the activities of U. S. cities. A <b>flood</b> <b>of</b> yield-seeking <b>capital</b> poured into municipal debt instruments in the late 1990 s, but not all cities or instruments were equally successful in attracting it. Capital gravitated toward those local governments that could readily convert the income streams of public assets into new financial instruments and that could {{minimize the risk of}} nonpayment due to the actions of nonfinancial claimants. This article follows the case of Chicago from 1996 through 2007 as the city government subsidized development projects with borrowed money using a once-obscure instrument called Tax Increment Financing (TIF). TIF allows municipalities to bundle and sell off the rights to future property tax revenues from designated parts of the city. The City of Chicago improved the appearance of these speculative instruments by segmenting and sequencing TIF debt instruments in ways that made them look less idiosyncratic and by exerting strong political control over the processes of development and property tax assessment. In doing so, Chicago not only attracted billions of dollars in global capital but also contributed to a dangerous oversupply of commercial real estate. Copyright (c) 2010 Clark University. ...|$|R

The work {{is made in the}} context of emerging ideas of environmental and geological change within the <b>flood</b> <b>of</b> unchecked global <b>capital.</b> As with other works and projects undertaken by the artists, the space is used as a platform through which temporality can be explored.

Gonu left US$4billion in damage and killed 50people, making it the worst natural disaster on record in Oman. In 2010, a slightly weaker cyclone named Phet caused US$780million in damage and 24deaths while crossing eastern Oman. Cyclonic Storm Keila in the subsequent year killed 19people while looping near Oman's southern coastline, and left US$80million in damage. In 1890, a storm killed 757people when it <b>flooded</b> much <b>of</b> Oman's <b>capital.</b> A storm in 1959 caused a shipwreck near southern Oman, resulting {{in the loss of}} all 141 crewmembers. Another storm-related shipwreck killed 18people in December 1998. In June 1977, a storm struck Masirah Island, causing 105deaths and becoming Oman's worst natural disaster in the 20th century. Other deadly systems include a storm in 2002 that killed nine and caused US$25million in damage, and Cyclone Nilofar in 2014 which killed four people from its outer rainbands.|$|R

He is based out of San Fernandez, a fictional Caribbean island nation with a history and political background strikingly similar to Haiti. Wyatt is convinced that Hurricane Mabel will strike San Fernandez head-on, with a storm surge that will <b>flood</b> its <b>capital</b> <b>of</b> St Pierre, potentially killing thousands. The United States Navy is not convinced, as their computer models indicate that the hurricane will pass by, and the paranoid, megalomaniacal dictator of San Fernandez, General Serrurier, will hear nothing of it. A hurricane has not struck San Fernandez in over fifty years, and he has much {{more important things to}} worry about - such as an armed revolt against his rule. As civil war erupts, Wyatt struggles to convince his superiors, the government, and eventually the rebels that the hurricane will be their most serious problem...|$|R

50|$|Most of Vietnam's railway infrastructure—including bridges, rail trucks, track beds, rolling stock, {{signals and}} {{communication}} equipment, and maintenance facilities—has suffered severe deterioration, mainly due to damage inflicted during the Vietnam War and a subsequent lack <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> investment and maintenance.
