50|$|CRISPs {{are found}} in the testes and {{epididymis}} of mammals, and are also involved in the process of fertilisation. In the spermatogenesis process (development of the spermatozoa in the testis), the CRISP2 protein is incorporated into the acrosome where it is believed {{to be involved in the}} adhesion of germ cells with Sertoli cells. CRISP2 also forms part of the sperm tail where it is thought to be involved in regulating flagellar beating. Proteins CRISP1 and CRISP4 are both found in the epididymis where they are also incorporated within the spermatozoa as it matures. Protein CRISP3 is found in seminal <b>fluid,</b> <b>excreted</b> <b>from</b> the prostate although its function is unknown.|$|R
40|$|G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are {{composed}} of seven transmembrane domains and play {{an essential role in}} regulating physiological functions and mediating responses to environmental stimuli, biogenic amines, neurotransmitters, peptides, lipids, and hormones. The calcitonin-like diuretic hormone 31 (DH 31) is known to elicit natriuresis from the Malpighian tubules (MTs) of mosquitoes Anopheles gambiae and Aedes aegypti upon blood feeding. However, the contribution of DH 31 cognate receptor, calcitonin receptor 1 (GPRCAL 1), has not been evaluated with respect to postprandial fluid regulation or myostimulatory activity in blood feeding insects. Thus, this dissertation has investigated potential roles of AedaeGPRCAL 1 in the regulation of fluid homeostasis and hindgut muscle contraction in female A. aegypti mosquito. The full length cDNA encoding AedaeGPRCAL 1 was cloned and sequenced. The receptor expression in the MTs and hindgut from female mosquito was analyzed by western blot and immunohistochemistry using anti-AedaeGPRCAL 1 affinity purified antibodies, and subsequently its role in fluid transport and hindgut contraction was evaluated by RNA interference (RNAi). The mosquitoes that underwent knock-down of the AedaeGPRcal 1 exhibited up to 57 % lower rate of MT fluid secretion in presence of Aedae-DH 31 in the in vitro assay and a ~ 30 % reduction in the <b>fluid</b> <b>excreted</b> <b>from</b> live females upon blood feeding. The receptor was immunolocalized in principal cells, predominantly towards the distal end of MTs. Analyses of receptor signal probability indicate the receptor is expressed in a gradient-like fashion {{along the length of the}} MTs. A striking discovery was the fact that not all principal cells express the receptor, contrary to previous belief. Immunolocalization revealed the AedaeGPRCAL 1 is expressed in hindgut circular and longitudinal muscles. The application of DH 31 increased the frequency of hindgut contractions in all female mosquitoes, those injected with AedaeGPRcal 1 dsRNA and controls, as compared to their basal contraction rate, but the percent change in frequency of hindgut contraction from AedaeGPRcal 1 knock-down females was about 2 -fold lower than the controls after application of Aedae-DH 31. To my knowledge, this is first evidence of RNAi-induced phenotypes in any invertebrate that allowed the quantification of the contribution of single family B GPCR to fluid loss and muscle contractility...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1969 Earthworms {{are capable}} of osmotic and ionic {{regulation}} while living in a dilute balanced salt solution. When transferred from soil to pond-water (PW) their body weight increases by 15 percent due to a net uptake of water. This results in an initial dilution of the coelomic fluid (CF). Subsequently, Na and Cl are accumulated in net amounts returning the CF ionic concentration to {{the same level as}} when the animals were in soil (75 mM Na/ 1, 47 mM Cl/ 1). Water is taken up across the skin. Although worms in PW do drink, the amount is minimal. In a steady state, the rate of water uptake and loss must be equal. Water is voided as a hypo-osmotic urine from the nephridia. The clearance of Inulin and Dextran from the CF is about 75 μl/ 10 g-hr. Since some water is probably reabsorbed from the nephridia, this gives a maximum estimate of urine excretion. Worms living in PW use their gastro-intestinal tract as an auxiliary excretory organ. <b>Fluid</b> <b>excreted</b> <b>from</b> the rectum is hypo-osmotic and hypo-ionic to the CF. It is hypothesized that fluid entering the esophagous, {{at the level of the}} calciferous gland, is an ultrafiltrate of the blood. Chloride is reabsorbed from the esophageal fluid in exchange for HCO₃ ions. The esophageal fluid enters the crop. Fluid in the crop is similar in composition to the CF except that the Cl concentration is lower (2 mM/l). As the fluid passes down the intestine Na is reabsorbed in exchange for NH₄, resulting in the formation of a dilute rectal fluid. Earthworms living in a dilute aquatic environment accumulate Na and Cl against an elecrochemical gradient by active transport across the skin. Sodium and Cl are transported independently. To maintain electrical neutrality, Na is probably exchanged for NH₄ or H ions and Cl exchanged for HCO₃. Kinetic analysis of the Na transport system for PW acclimated worms indicates a V[subscript m] of 1. 1 μeq Na/ 10 g-hr and a K[subscript s] of 1. 6 mM Na/ 1. These values suggest the epithelium is less permeable to Na than in most fresh-water animals. The ion transport systems are delicately regulated. A dilution of the CF increases the rate of active transport of both Na and Cl. Sodium efflux is unchanged but the Cl efflux is reduced. The mechanism of regulation is unknown; however, neuroendocrine mediation has been implicated. It is concluded that earthworms can adapt to an aquatic environment. However, they do possess some characteristics which distinguish them from truely fresh-water animals. The use of the gastro-intestinal tract for producing a dilute fluid excreta is unique. The relative low skin permeability to Na results in a Na transport rate much lower in magnitude than fresh-water organisms of comparable size...|$|R
