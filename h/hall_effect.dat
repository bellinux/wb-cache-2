5|$|In 1879, Edwin Herbert Hall {{working at}} the Johns Hopkins University {{discovered}} a voltage developing across conductors transverse to an electric current in the conductor and magnetic field perpendicular to the current. This phenomenon arising {{due to the nature}} of charge carriers in the conductor came to be termed the <b>Hall</b> <b>effect,</b> but it was not properly explained at the time, since the electron was experimentally discovered 18 years later. After the advent of quantum mechanics, Lev Landau in 1930 developed the theory of landau quantization and laid the foundation for the theoretical explanation for the quantum <b>Hall</b> <b>effect</b> discovered half a century later.|$|E
5|$|Harald {{became the}} first of the two Bohr {{brothers}} to earn a master's degree, which he earned for mathematics in April 1909. Niels took another nine months to earn his. Students had to submit a thesis on a subject assigned by their supervisor. Bohr's supervisor was Christiansen, and the topic he chose was the electron theory of metals. Bohr subsequently elaborated his master's thesis into his much-larger Doctor of Philosophy (dr. phil.) thesis. He surveyed the literature on the subject, settling on a model postulated by Paul Drude and elaborated by Hendrik Lorentz, in which the electrons in a metal are considered to behave like a gas. Bohr extended Lorentz's model, but was still unable to account for phenomena like the <b>Hall</b> <b>effect,</b> and concluded that electron theory could not fully explain the magnetic properties of metals. The thesis was accepted in April 1911, and Bohr conducted his formal defence on 13 May. Harald had received his doctorate the previous year. Bohr's thesis was groundbreaking, but attracted little interest outside Scandinavia because it was written in Danish, a Copenhagen University requirement at the time. In 1921, the Dutch physicist Hendrika Johanna van Leeuwen would independently derive a theorem from Bohr's thesis that is today known as the Bohr–van Leeuwen theorem.|$|E

40|$|The energy {{efficiency}} of the spin <b>Hall</b> <b>effects</b> (SHE) can be enhanced if the electrical conductivity is decreased without sacrificing the spin Hall conductivity. The resistivity of Pt films can be increased to 150 - 300 μΩ*cm by mesoscopic lateral confinement, thereby decreasing the conductivity. The SHE and inverse spin <b>Hall</b> <b>effects</b> (ISHE) in these mesoscopic Pt films are explored at 10 K by using the nonlocal spin injection/detection method. All relevant physical quantities are determined in-situ on the same substrate, and a quantitative approach is developed to characterize all processes effectively. Extensive measurements with various Pt thickness values reveal an upper limit for the Pt spin diffusion length: λ_pt< 0. 8 nm. The average product of λ_pt and the Pt spin Hall angle α_H is substantial: α_H*λ_pt=(0. 142 +/- 0. 040) nm for 4 nm thick Pt, though a gradual decrease is observed at larger Pt thickness.

25|$|While quantum {{mechanics}} primarily {{applies to the}} smaller atomic regimes of matter and energy, some systems exhibit quantum mechanical effects on a large scale. Superfluidity, the frictionless flow of a liquid at temperatures near absolute zero, is one well-known example. So is the closely related phenomenon of superconductivity, the frictionless flow of an electron gas in a conducting material (an electric current) at sufficiently low temperatures. The fractional quantum <b>Hall</b> <b>effect</b> is a topological ordered state which corresponds to patterns of long-range quantum entanglement.

40|$|One {{of the key}} {{technologies}} in spintronics is to tame spin-orbit coupling (SOC) that links spin and motion of electrons, giving rise to intriguing magneto-transport properties in itinerant magnets. Prominent examples of such SOC-based phenomena are anomalous and topological <b>Hall</b> <b>effects.</b> However, controlling them by electric field has remained unachieved since electric field tends to be screened in itinerant magnets. Here we demonstrate that both anomalous and topological <b>Hall</b> <b>effects</b> can be modulated by electric field in oxide heterostructures consisting of ferromagnetic SrRuO$_{ 3 }$ and nonmagnetic SrIrO$_{ 3 }$. We observed clear electric-field effect only when SrIrO$_{ 3 }$ is inserted between SrRuO$_{ 3 }$ and a gate dielectric. Our results establish that strong SOC of nonmagnetic materials such as SrIrO$_{ 3 }$ is essential in electrical tuning of these <b>Hall</b> <b>effects</b> and possibly other SOC-related phenomena.

25|$|Speed sensors: A {{speed sensor}} {{is used to}} {{determine}} the acceleration or deceleration of the wheel. These sensors use a magnet and a <b>Hall</b> <b>effect</b> sensor, or a toothed wheel and an electromagnetic coil to generate a signal. The rotation of the wheel or differential induces a magnetic field around the sensor. The fluctuations of this magnetic field generate a voltage in the sensor. Since the voltage induced in the sensor {{is a result of the}} rotating wheel, this sensor can become inaccurate at slow speeds. The slower rotation of the wheel can cause inaccurate fluctuations in the magnetic field and thus cause inaccurate readings to the controller.|$|E
25|$|Electronic {{ignition}} (EI) solves these problems. In {{the initial}} systems, points were still used but they handled only a low current {{which was used}} to control the high primary current through a solid state switching system. Soon, however, even these contact breaker points were replaced by an angular sensor of some kind - either optical, where a vaned rotor breaks a light beam, or more commonly using a <b>Hall</b> <b>effect</b> sensor, which responds to a rotating magnet mounted on the distributor shaft. The sensor output is shaped and processed by suitable circuitry, then used to trigger a switching device such as a thyristor, which switches a large current through the coil.|$|E

It has a 6in, 212PPI E Ink Pearl display (758×1024 resolution) with four built-in LEDs {{to illuminate the}} screen. It was available in Wi-Fi ($120 ad-supported, $140 no ads) and Wi-Fi + 3G ($180 ad-supported, $200 no ads) models, with the ad-supported options only intended to {{be available in the}} United States. The light {{is one of the main}} features of the Paperwhite and it has a manually adjusted light level. The 3G access restrictions are the same as the Kindle Touch, and usage of the 3G data is limited to 50 MB per month and only on Amazon and Wikipedia's websites; additional data may be purchased. Battery life is advertised as up to eight weeks of reading with half an hour per day with wireless off and constant light usage; this usage equals 28 hours. The official leather cover for the Paperwhite uses the <b>hall</b> <b>effect</b> sensor in the device that detects when the cover is closed/opened to turn the screen off/on respectively. This device was the first Kindle to track one's reading speed to estimate when one will finish a chapter or book; this feature was later included with updates to the other Kindles and Kindle Fire tablets. The Kindle Paperwhite lacks physical buttons for page turning and does not perform auto-hyphenation. Except for the lock screen/power button at its bottom, it relies solely on the touchscreen interface. In November 2012, Amazon released the 5.3.0 update that allowed users to turn off recommended content on the home screen in Grid View (allowing two rows of user content) and included general bug fixes. In March 2014, the Paperwhite 5.4.4 update was released that added Goodreads integration, Kindle FreeTime to restrict usage for children, Cloud Collections for organization and Page Flip for scanning content without losing your place, which closely matched the Paperwhite 2's software features.|$|E
