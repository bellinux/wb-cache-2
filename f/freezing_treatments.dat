Therefore, it is important to use a rapid method for assessing the resistant cultivars and wild species of these plants. Evaluation of electrolyte leakage (EL) from freezing damaged tissues of almond is an appropriate method for this purpose. In the present work, the effect of freezing on the rate of electrolyte leakage of 10 cultivated almonds (Amygdalus communis cultivars) and one wild species (A. scoparia) was evaluated in Isfahan province. The perfect and mature flowers of all samples were selected at random, and examined under natural (in nature) and artificial (in laboratory) <b>freezing</b> <b>treatments</b> in 3 replicates. All measurements were done using an Ec meter instrument and the mean of obtained data was analyzed statistically via ANOVA and Tukey's tests. In each treatment, increase in the rate of electrolyte leakage of treated samples in relation to the controls was taken as a criterion for comparison. Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) of the flowers of all samples were also measured, with an accuracy of 0. 001, under natural freezing conditions. The mean of TDS was 390. 8 ± 33. 5 mg/L among cultivated almonds (maximum in Safari cultivar with 439 ± 29. 3 mg/L and minimum in Kababi cultivar with 355 ± 35. 3 mg/L) and 362 ± 55. 8 mg/L in the wild almond (a little less than that of the cultivated ones). Linear regression test showed that there was no correlation between TDS and the rate of electrolyte leakage from freezing damaged tissues of the studied samples. Furthermore, the results showed that the cultivars of Tageri (with 7. 47 % increasing), Azar (with 19. 2 % increasing) and Rabie (with 22 % increasing) are respectively more resistant than other cultivars under natural freezing, and the cultivars of Rabie (with 60. 7 % increasing), Tageri (with 67. 6 % increasing) and Hag Mirzaie (with 71 % increasing) are more resistant than other cultivars under artificial treatment.

In this study, a novel DREB 1 /CBF transcription factor, PnDREB 1, was isolated from Iceland poppy (Papaver nudicaule), a plant adaptive to low temperature environments. It is homologous to the known DREB 1 s of Arabidopsis and other plant species. It also shares similar 3 D structure, and conserved and functionally important motifs with DREB 1 s of Arabidopsis. The phylogenetic analysis indicated that the AP 2 domain of PnDREB 1 is similar to those of Glycine max, Medicago truncatula, and M. sativa. PnDREB 1 is constitutively expressed in diverse tissues and is increased in roots. qPCR analyses indicated that PnDREB 1 is significantly induced by <b>freezing</b> <b>treatment</b> as well as by abscissic acid.

Because deciduous species have a growth season limited in length and also have generally larger conduit volumes, {{they are more likely}} than evergreens to be injured by freeze–thaw-induced cavitation during the growing season. To test whether growth at elevated temperature increases suscepti-bility to freeze–thaw damage, we grew a deciduous arctic shrub species (Salix pulchra Cham.) in simulated Alaskan summer temperatures and at 5 °C above the ambient simulation (+ 5 °C plants) in controlled environments. Stem specific hy-draulic conductivity (ks) and leaf stomatal conductance (gs) were measured in plants grown at both temperatures before and after a <b>freeze</b> <b>treatment</b> simulating a mid-season frost. Before the <b>freeze</b> <b>treatment,</b> specific xylem conductivity was 2. 5 times higher and stomatal conductances were 1. 3 times higher in + 5 °C plants than in ambient-grown plants. Reductions in hy-draulic conductivity and stomatal conductance {{as a result of the}} freeze were 3. 5 and 1. 8 times greater respectively in + 5 °C plants than in ambient- grown plants. Many of the + 5 °C plants showed extensive leaf damage.

The {{main effect of}} fertilisation on nutrient concentrations in the needles was on nitrogen, which showed a marked responce to treatment. Frost hardiness determinations were made by measuring the leakage of electrolytes from the needles. With freezing freatmenfs that caused heavy damage, there was a maximum hardiness at nitrogen concentrations of between 1. 3 to 1. 8 % dw, whilst with moderate damage, no such maximum could be detected. In this case, a tendency towards decreasing hardiness with increasing nitrogen concentration was observed. In the spring, 1971, two relatively hard frosts occurred in late May and early June. The frosts caused damage to several trees at many plots in the fertiliser experiment. The incidence of damaged trees increased above a needle concentration of about 1. 8 - 2. 0 % nitrogen dw, but even at high nitrogen content there were many plots with no damaged trees, suggesting that a factor or factors other than nitrogen content may influence frost hardiness.

In this study we tested the effect of different freezing methods (standard freezing at − 18  °C and fast-freezing with liquid nitrogen) on DOM concentrations measured as organic carbon (DOC) concentrations and on spectroscopic properties of DOM from different terrestrial ecosystems (forest and grassland). Fresh and differently frozen throughfall, stemflow, litter leachate and soil solution samples were analyzed for DOC concentrations, UV-vis absorption and fluorescence excitation–emission matrices combined with parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC). Fast-freezing with liquid nitrogen prevented a significant decrease of DOC concentrations observed after freezing at − 18  °C. Nonetheless, the share of PARAFAC components 1 (EX max  <  250  nm (340  nm), EX max : 480  nm) and 2 (EX max : 335  nm, EX max : 408  nm) to total fluorescence and the humification index (HIX) decreased after both <b>freezing</b> <b>treatments,</b> while the shares of component 3 (EX max : <  250  nm (305  nm), EX max : 438  nm) as well as SUVA 254 increased. The contribution of PARAFAC component 4 (EX max : 280  nm, EX max : 328  nm) to total fluorescence was not affected by freezing. We recommend fast-freezing with liquid nitrogen for preservation of bulk DOC concentrations of samples from terrestrial sources, whereas immediate measuring is preferable to preserve spectroscopic properties of DOM...|$|E
30|$|Six {{bacterial}} cell samples (6 strains × 3 replicates[*]=[*] 18) from each Pseudomonas strain were prepared and each set was grown separately into 5  ml LB medium at two different temperatures 4 and 28 °C (48  h incubation period for 4 °C culture and 24  h for 28 °C culture). Both cultures (4 and 28 °C) were kept separately at preset temperature of - 10 and - 40 °C temperature for 48, 72 and 96  h. Bacterial cultures were thawed at room temperature, appropriate dilutions were plated and incubated at 28 °C for 48  h and CFU counts were measured for 48, 72 and 96  h of freeze shifted bacterial cultures. Freeze-thaw survival of Pseudomonas spp. was determined at - 10 and - 40 °C {{by comparing the}} log CFU counts {{before and after the}} <b>freezing</b> <b>treatment.</b> All experiments were performed in duplicates.|$|R
40|$|Herbarium {{specimens}} preservation: Roma's account. The general conservation {{state of}} the specimens kept in RO has been estimated, the principal causes of deterioration defined and some possible control methods tested. 300 packs out 1373 are being randonmly sorted and each sheet {{assigned to one of}} four deterioration states. By far the main deterioration agent was found to be Lasioderma serricorne (F.). Bad handling of specimens by untrained or careless people is probably the second main deterioration cause. Disinfestants and procedures for an insect-free environment maintenance have been examined. Chemichal agents which have been used in RO seem to be either ineffective or hazardous for regular frequenters. Microwave, heat and deep <b>freezing</b> <b>treatment</b> have been tested. The parameters required by our equipment for the definitive death of infesters have been defined. Plans for disinfestation and for the maintenance of an insect-free condition are suggested...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to evaluate the effect of the aging period prior to freezing on the meat quality of Hanwoo long-issimus dorsi (LD) muscle. Three different combinations of aging and freezing periods (0 / 90, 20 / 70, and 40 / 50) were exam-ined using LD muscle at 24 h postmortem under an identical storage time of 90 d. The pH and lightness slightly increased with increasing aging period. However, there were no significant (p> 0. 05) differences in redness and yellowness. The soli-tary <b>freezing</b> <b>treatment</b> (0 / 90) had the significantly (p 0. 05) difference in shear force and sensorial properties between 20 and 40 d aging prior to freez-ing. Therefore, 20 d aging prior to freezing may be a sufficiently effective strategy to improve the tenderness and sensorial properties of Hanwoo LD muscle Key words: aging, freezing, Hanwoo, tendernes...|$|R
