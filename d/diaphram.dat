2500|$|The early {{earphones}} {{used with}} wireless-era crystal sets had moving iron drivers that {{worked in a}} way similar to the horn loudspeakers of the period; modern loudspeakers use a moving-coil principle. Each earpiece contained a permanent magnet about which was a coil of wire which formed a second [...] electromagnet. Both magnetic poles were close to a steel <b>diaphram</b> of the speaker. When the audio signal from the radio was passed through the electromagnet's windings, current was caused to flow in the coil which created a varying magnetic field that augmented or diminished that due to the permanent magnet. This varied the force of attraction on the diaphragm, causing it to vibrate. The vibrations of the diaphragm push and pull {{on the air in}} front of it, creating sound waves. Standard headphones used in telephone work had a low impedance, often 75 Ω, and required more current than a crystal radio could supply. Therefore, the type used with crystal set radios (and other sensitive equipment) was wound with more turns of finer wire giving it a high impedance of 2000-8000 Ω.|$|E

This also allowed better access to the inside, for painting. Intermittent cross <b>diaphrams</b> were placed across the flange, to maintain its position relative to the main web and avoid distortion by rocking sideways.|$|R

5|$|Birth {{control is}} another consideration: women with SCI {{are usually not}} {{prescribed}} oral contraceptives since the hormones in them {{increase the risk of}} blood clots, for which people with SCI are already at elevated risk. Intrauterine devices could have dangerous complications that could go undetected if sensation is reduced. <b>Diaphrams</b> that require something to be inserted into the vagina are not usable by people with poor hand function.

50|$|The {{traction}} motors are three phase asynchronous machines (DTA-1200 model, developed by NEVZ). They are {{suspended in the}} bogies and decoupled from the non-rotational motions of the driving wheels. The connection between motor and reduction gear is via a <b>diaphram</b> coupling, and the gearbox output drives a hollow shaft connected to the axle via a flexible coupling.|$|E
5000|$|The word [...] "nipple" [...] {{most likely}} {{originates}} as a diminutive of neb, an Old English word meaning [...] "beak", [...] "nose", or [...] "face", {{and which is}} of Germanic origin. The words [...] "teat" [...] and [...] "tit" [...] share a Germanic ancestor. The second of the two, tit, was inherited directly from Proto-Germanic, while the first entered English via Old French. The nipple is also used an anatomical landmark. It marks the T4 (fourth thoracic vertebra) dermatome and rests over the approximate level of the <b>diaphram.</b>|$|E
50|$|Propellants {{are forced}} into the {{combustion}} chamber by compressed air, stored at 200 bar in two steel vessels. This pressure is released through an electrically-fired cartridge that opens a valve with a blow-out disc. This is {{the full extent of}} the electrical control system. Once fired, the valve does not close again. A pressure regulator delivers air at 33 bar, through a shuttle valve that pressurised first the catalyst tanks and then the propellant tank. This delay ensures reliable ignition in the combustion chamber. A non-return valve ensures that no catalyst can flow backwards into the air or propellant plumbing, with an explosive result. A rubber <b>diaphram,</b> broken as propellant pressure builds, ensures that there is no backflow through the combustion chamber either. Z-stoff was known for problems of clogging injectors and so an inline filter was used.|$|E
500|$|Space was {{reserved}} for an unsuccessful French sonar system that was cancelled in September 1930. The NGS also intended to fit a passive Walser acoustic locator system in the Chacal class, but only [...] was actually fitted with one. This consisted {{of a set of}} two steel lenses, one set {{on each side of the}} ship, with a large number of <b>diaphrams</b> that ambient amplified sound for the operator. This proved useless while the ship was moving faster than dead slow and was removed in 1931. The Walser compartment was reused when a British Type 123 ASDIC system was installed aboard the ships in 1939–40, although Panthère did not receive one.|$|R
40|$|A {{data base}} of the algae of Arkansas {{ecoregions}} has been established to describe the numerous taxa that occur within the aquatic ecosystems included in these regions. The organisms were identified {{with the aid of}} diverse literature from throughout the world. These sources are written in multiple languages and the living organisms had to be compared with outline or silhouette drawings. These illustrations may include shading, but none present the true color of the organism but only the characteristics of the descriptive source. Primary characteristics used to identify algae is based upon pigmentation of the plastid and the number and position of the flagella as well as gross morphology. The focus of this research project was to develop a photographic system which would permit the recording of living organisms with various forms of microscopy with correct color and with arrested flagellar movement. These parameters dictated the use of an electronic flash source with metering and control system after the light has passed through the microscope. Most commercially available systems use preset flash intensities and/or durations. These systems require the use of neutral density filters or other adaptions to attain specified magnifications-illumination method- flash settings. The system for this project uses off-the-shelf components with a modified flashtube holder which positions the tube in the axis of the light beam between the field and iris <b>diaphrams.</b> The light is measured off-the-film so that the combined light from the microscope and flash are included. The flash is quenched and shutter closed based upon the combined reading. This system permits the operator to change magnification and/or illumination technique (brightfield, phase-contrast or Nomarski) without adjusting the flash or camera setting...|$|R
5000|$|Since the {{technology}} became {{widespread in the}} 1970s, SLRs have become the main photographic instrument used by dedicated amateur photographers and professionals. Some photographers of static subjects (such as architecture, landscape, and some commercial subjects), however, prefer view cameras because of the capability to control perspective. With a triple-extension bellows 4" [...] × 5" [...] camera such as the Linhof SuperTechnika V, the photographer can correct certain distortions such as [...] "keystoning", where the image 'lines' converge (i.e., photographing a building by pointing a typical camera upward to include {{the top of the}} building). Perspective correction lenses are available in the 35 mm and medium formats to correct this distortion with film cameras, and it can also be corrected after the fact with photo software when using digital cameras. The photographer can also extend the bellows to its full length, tilt the front standard and perform photomacrography (commonly known as 'macro photography'), producing a sharp image with depth-of-field without stopping down the lens <b>diaphram.</b>|$|E

40|$|The two {{accepted}} major {{methods for}} decompression of a pneumothorax are needle aspiration {{in the second}} intercostal space and large bore chest tube insertion in the midaxillary line, sixth, seventh or eight intercostal space. Both of these devices have drawbacks in the emergency management of a tension pneumothorax. Relating to size, case of insertion, volume of air aspirated and cumbersomeness of associated equipment. This evaluation of its effectiveness is both in the prehospital phase and in the Emergency Department by studying 40 patients, 55 % of which were prehospital. Sixty per cent were placed by EMT-Paramedic personnel. All of those patients that survived their multiple trauma long enough to allow x-rays to be made, had partial to total re-expansion of the pneumothorax. Of those patients undergoing autopsy or surgical exploration no indication could be identified of pulmonary injury secondary to the insertion of the device. The only complications were: intercostal artery laceration and a minor laceration of {{the dome of the}} <b>diaphram.</b> In summary this study of 40 patients demonstrates the effectiveness of the use of a device for the management of tension pneumothorax, both prehospital and in-hospital by physician and EMT-Paramedic personnel...|$|E
40|$|Myogenic {{regulatory}} factors (MRFs), muscle-specific transcription factors, are {{implicated in}} the activity-dependent regulation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) subunit genes. Here we show, with immunohistochemistry, Western blotting, and electron microscopy that MyoD, {{a member of the}} MRF family, also plays a role in fetal synapse formation. In the diaphragm of 14. 5 d gestation (E 14. 5) wild-type and MyoD �/ � mice, AChR clusters (the formation of which is under a muscle intrinsic program) are confined to a centrally located endplate zone. This distribution persists in wild-type adult muscles. However, beginning at E 15. 5 and extending to the adult, innervated AChR clusters are distributed all over the diaphragm of MyoD �/ � mice, extending as far as the insertion of the diaphragm into the ribs. In wild-type muscle, motor axons terminate on clusters adjacent to the main intramuscular nerve; in MyoD �/ � muscle, axonal bundles form extensive secondary branches that terminate on the widely distributed clusters. The number of AChR clusters on adult MyoD �/ � and wild-type <b>diaphram</b> muscles is similar. Junctional fold density is reduced at MyoD �/ � endplates, and the transition from the fetal (�, �, �, �) to adult-type (�, �, �, �) AChRs is markedly delayed.

40|$|Particle-image {{velocimetry}} (PIV) {{was used}} to visualize the flow within an optically transparent pediatric ventricular assist device (PVAD) under development in our laboratory The device studied is a diaphragm type pulsatile pump with an ejection volume of 30 ml per beating cycle intended for temporary cardiac assistance as a bridge to transplantation or recovery in children. Of particular interest was the identification of flow patterns, including regions of stagnation and/or strong turbulence that often promote thrombus formation and hemolysis, which can degrade the usefulness of such devices. For this purpose, phase-locked PIV measurements were performed in planes parallel to the <b>diaphram</b> that drives the flow in the device. The test fluid was seeded with 10 Am polystyrene spheres, and the motion of these particles {{was used to}} determine the instantaneous flow velocity distribution in the illumination plane. These measurements revealed that flow velocities up to 1. 0 m/s can occur within the PVAD. Phase-averaged velocity fields revealed the fixed vortices that drive the bulk flow within the device, though significant cycle-to-cycle variability was also quite apparent in the instantaneous velocity distributions, most notably during the filling phase. This cycle-to-cycle variability can generate strong turbulence that may contribute to greater hemolysis. Stagnation regions have also been observed between the input and output branches of the prototype, which can increase the likelihood of thrombus formation. [DOI: 10. 1115 / 1. 4001252...|$|E
40|$|Acute {{and chronic}} {{respiratory}} failure {{is a common}} and potentially life-threatening feature in patients with myotonic dystrophy (MD). The causes may be varied, and can involve both the central and peripheral nervous system. To evaluate the incidence of respiratory muscle involvement and {{the function of the}} central motor inspirator} ' pathway to phrenic motor neurons we performed magnetic stimulation of the cortex and cervical spinal cord, phrenic nerve conduction studies and needle EMG of diaphragm and intercostal muscles in 25 patients with MD. The results were compared with those from 35 healthy subjects. In addition, pulmonary function tests, blood gas analyses and static mouth pressures were evaluated. Abnormalities in response to magnetic stimulation, including a reduced compound muscle action potential (CMAP) from the <b>diaphram</b> and increased excit-ability threshold, indicated impaired central inspiralory drive in 20 % of cases. Phrenic nerve conduction showed a reduced diaphragmatic CMAP amplitude in 20 %, and a delayed negative peak onset latency in 4 % of cases. Abnormalities in diaphragm and intercostal muscle needle EMG were found in 76 % of cases, these were mainly myotonic discharges (68 %) and a {{decrease in the number of}} active motor units (36 %). Patients with abnormal respiratory electrophysiological parameters had a signi-ficantly lower functional vital capacity (FVC; P = 0. 005). The duration of the disease correlated negatively with diaphragmatic CMAP amplitude to phrenic nerve, but not magnetic, stimulation. Our results demonstrate that the involvement of the central inspiratory pathway is common in MD patients.
