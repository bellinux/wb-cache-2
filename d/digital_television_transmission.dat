50|$|Local Multipoint Distribution Service (LMDS) is a {{broadband}} wireless access technology originally designed for <b>digital</b> <b>television</b> <b>transmission</b> (DTV). It was conceived as a fixed wireless, point-to-multipoint technology for utilization in the last mile.LMDS commonly operates on microwave frequencies across the 26 GHz and 29 GHz bands. In the United States, frequencies from 31.0 through 31.3 GHz are also considered LMDS frequencies.|$|E
50|$|The Pontop Pike {{transmitter}} provides <b>digital</b> <b>television</b> <b>transmissions</b> to Tyne and Wear, County Durham, Tees Valley, most of Northumberland {{and parts}} of North Yorkshire.

50|$|Local Multipoint Distribution Service (LMDS) is a {{broadband}} wireless access technology that uses microwave signals operating between 26 GHz and 29 GHz. Originally designed for <b>digital</b> <b>television</b> <b>transmission</b> (DTV), it is conceived as a fixed wireless, point-to-multipoint technology for utilization in the last mile. Data rates range from 64 kbit/s to 155 Mbit/s. Distance is typically limited to about 1.5 mi, but links of up to 5 miles (8 km) from the base station are possible in some circumstances.|$|E
50|$|A <b>digital</b> <b>television</b> adapter, (CECB), or digital-to-analog {{converter}} (box), is {{a device that}} receives, {{by means of an}} antenna, a <b>digital</b> <b>television</b> (DTV) <b>transmission,</b> and converts that signal into an analog television signal that can be received and displayed on an analog television.|$|R
50|$|Broadcast {{television}} stations {{are changing the}} scope and breadth of their services, too. <b>Digital</b> <b>television</b> technology allows broadcasters to provide more programming choices to over-the-air viewers {{as well as to}} cable and satellite subscribers. <b>Digital</b> <b>television</b> stations now provide a mix of high definition and standard definition broadcast signals and may possibly offer interactive television services in the future. More importantly, such stations are able to “multicast” by splitting their digital signals into smaller streams each of which may be independently programmed. It is axiomatic that the <b>digital</b> <b>television</b> <b>transmissions</b> are much different than traditional analog transmissions. For that reason, the existing distant signal licenses, whose foundations were built upon analog broadcast technology, cannot readily accommodate the vibrant capabilities of <b>digital</b> <b>television.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Mount Leinster {{transmitter}} {{is owned}} and operated by 2RN and at 796m ASL it is the highest transmission site in Ireland. It was one of the original five main Telefís Éireann television transmitters when it opened on low power in December 1962. It became fully operational on 12 June 1963 with a 625-line service on VHF Band III Channel F. The new RTÉ Radio FM service was added in 1966, and RTÉ's second television channel RTÉ 2 was carried on VHF when it started in 1978. UHF <b>television</b> <b>transmissions</b> from Mount Leinster began in 1996 with the introduction of Teilifís na Gaeilge. The original 1962 mast was replaced in 2010 with a taller one of 122m in preparation for <b>digital</b> <b>television</b> <b>transmissions.</b> In common with all the other 2RN sites, analogue <b>television</b> <b>transmissions</b> from Mount Leinster ceased on 24 October 2012.Today the site provides the Irish <b>digital</b> <b>television</b> service Saorview, and eight FM radio stations to a large area of South East Ireland.|$|R

50|$|It {{currently}} has a 172 m tall guyed mast, {{owned and operated}} by Arqiva (previously National Grid Wireless). There is a smaller tower on the site belonging to British Telecom. Prior to Digital Switchover (DSO) the station broadcast with a power of 250 kW (ERP) for FM radio, 500 kW for analogue television, and 20 kW for digital television. In July 2007, Ofcom confirmed that Rowridge would remain an A Group transmitter at Digital switchover; the <b>digital</b> <b>television</b> <b>transmission</b> signal was then boosted to 200 kW.|$|E
50|$|The tower {{collapsed}} on September 24, 2002 during reconstruction work. Two tower workers, Lawrence A. Sukalec, 59, of Valier, Illinois, and Daniel E. Goff, 25, of Sesser, Illinois, {{were killed in}} the process, and three were injured on the ground. The collapse occurred as strengthening measures were being taken so the 30+ year-old tower could accommodate the added weight of <b>Digital</b> <b>Television</b> <b>transmission</b> facilities. Investigations later found that the contractors neglected to stabilize the tower while original structural components were being replaced with stronger ones.|$|E
50|$|In 2000, XETV began {{transmitting}} {{a digital}} signal on UHF channel 23, {{becoming the first}} San Diego area station to begin <b>digital</b> <b>television</b> <b>transmissions.</b> It {{was also the first}} television station in Mexico to operate a digital signal; no other Mexican television station had begun digital operations at that time, and a <b>digital</b> <b>television</b> standard was not formally selected until 2004. It maps on digital tuners in both countries as virtual channel 6.1 through PSIP technology. In January 2006, the Secretariat of Communications and Transportation, which at the time still regulated broadcasting in Mexico, gave formal authorization for XETV's digital signal, with the full callsign XETV-TDT (a suffix standing for <b>Televisión</b> <b>Digital</b> Terrestre, or Terrestrial Television) and an effective radiated power of 402.8 kilowatts.|$|R
