40|$|The authors {{hypothesized}} that the pathophysiology of early Parkinson's disease (PD) may selectively target structures that support visual working memory for spatial relations but leave structures that support working memory for featural characteristics of objects relatively intact Fifteen PD and 15 normal control participants took a visual <b>delayed-response</b> <b>test</b> with a spatial condition and a (nonspatial) object condition, equating the perceptual difficulty of the tests for each participant. The stimuli were irregular polygons presented at different locations on a computer screen. Results revealed a selective impairment of spatial delayed response in PD, indicating a disruption of spatial working memory unconfounded by sensory processing difficulties. The selectivity of this deficit may reflect the circumscribed nature of pathophysi-ological change affecting the caudate nucleus in early PD. Working memory {{has been defined as}} "a brain system that provides temporary storage and manipulation of the informa-tion necessary for such complex cognitive tasks as language comprehension, learning, and reasoning " (Baddeley, 1992, p. 556). Recent research has supported a model of working memory as a modular system, consisting, at a minimum, of executive processes that operate on the contents of at least two working memory storage systems, the visuospatial sketchpad and the phonological loop (D'Esposito et al. ...|$|E
