The later carvers didn't learn the technique of making each piece fit so well that it could be removed and put back in again and again. Those pieces have more than tripled in value. The painting on these figures is also more intense and varied.|$|E

Henry Award-winning author) to state in 1991: [...] "His {{is the most}} influential body of work in English prose by anyone since Hemingway." [...] Of the writers in Salinger's generation, Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist John Updike attested that [...] "the short stories of J. D. Salinger really opened my eyes as to <b>how</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> weave fiction out {{of a set of}} events that seem almost unconnected, or very lightly connected... stick in my mind as really having moved me a step up, as it were, toward knowing how to handle my own material." [...] The critic Louis Menand has observed that the early stories of Pulitzer Prize-winner Philip Roth were affected by [...] "Salinger's voice and comic timing".|$|E

Brown discussed Dot's relationship with Jim in 2004: [...] "Initially, Jim wasn't {{the sort of person}} that Dot approved of. He drank, he gambled, he lied– he wasn't reliable at all. But Jim decided that he quite fancied Dot– heaven knows why! I think that you always have to work out for yourself <b>how</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> make the character work in a new situation. I could see that Jim was kind to Dot [...] His kindness drew her towards him. [...] Dot's definitely in control of Jim. She quite enjoys bossing him around." [...] Brown stated that she enjoys her screen partnership with John Bardon, saying [...] "We work very well together– he's got great timing and he can be very tender too." ...|$|E

He is brought back into service by Section 20 seven years later. He is married to Diane, and has a daughter, Alexandra. Armitage described Porter as a [...] "damaged hero", and [...] "sort of like Lucas North, only on some kind of go-faster drug." [...] In order to fit into the role, Armitage had to [...] "bulk up for the role," [...] and performed a lot of training for about ten weeks in the UK, and then flew to Johannesburg the day after filming the eighth series of Spooks wrapped up, where he proceeded with more training. He was trained from [...] "how to hold a gun to <b>how</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> run through a door without getting your head blown off." [...] Armitage had not trained as hard as in the past; the intensity of such training almost made him pass out after the first workout, stating [...] "filming Spooks is demanding, but nowhere near as physical as this." [...] Armitage performed most of his own stunts.|$|E
500|$|In December 1999, he co-authored It's About the Money: <b>How</b> <b>You</b> <b>Can</b> Get Out of Debt, Build Wealth, and Achieve Your Financial Dreams. [...] The {{book is a}} {{self-help}} {{book with}} directions for achieving personal financial independence. The book is targeted toward people of limited means. In the fall of 2001, he co-authored Legal Lynching: The Death Penalty and America's Future, also known as Legal Lynching II. [...] With coauthors, Rev. Jesse Jackson, Jackson Jr., and Bruce Shapiro, the anti-death penalty voice was heard very publicly. The book was published, {{at a time when}} public opposition to the death penalty was at a historically high level, by two of America's most prominent civil rights leaders. It was a follow up to Legal Lynching: Racism, Injustice and the Death Penalty, which was released in 1996 by Jackson Sr. In 2001, Jackson Jr. authored , with his press secretary, Frank Watkins. [...] The book outlines his moral and political philosophies, and it provides an autobiographical sketch. [...] It provides analysis on the link between race and economics from colonial America to the present with a vision for the future. [...] In addition to the analysis, it provides eight proposed constitutional amendments that Jackson sees as essential to pursuit of broader social and economic opportunity. [...] Since the publication of this book, Jackson has refined these and formally proposed these constitutional amendments.|$|E
