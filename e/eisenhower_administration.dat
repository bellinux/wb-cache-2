5|$|Nevertheless, {{pleased by}} the findings, the <b>Eisenhower</b> <b>administration</b> {{proposed}} negotiations on a permanent test ban and announced it would self-impose a year-long testing moratorium if Britain and the Soviet Union did the same. This decision amounted to a victory for John Foster Dulles, Allen Dulles (then the Director of Central Intelligence), and PSAC, who had argued within the <b>Eisenhower</b> <b>administration</b> for separating a test ban from larger disarmament efforts, and a defeat for the Department of Defense and AEC, which had argued to the contrary.|$|E

5|$|After World War II, {{he served}} as the U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union from 1946 to 1948. Then in 1950, Smith became the Director of Central Intelligence, {{the head of the}} Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and other {{intelligence}} agencies in the United States. Smith reorganized the CIA, redefined its structure and its mission, and he gave it a new sense of purpose. He made the CIA the arm of government primarily responsible for covert operations. He left the CIA in 1953 to become an Under Secretary of State. After retiring from the State Department in 1954, Smith continued to serve the <b>Eisenhower</b> <b>Administration</b> in various posts for several years, until his retirement and his death in 1961.|$|E

5|$|In time, the {{ineffectiveness}} of the CIP {{began to}} concern the <b>Eisenhower</b> <b>administration,</b> who {{were worried about}} the lack of industrialization. The corruption that permeated the initiative remained a problem. The rural peasants of Vietnam, who comprised more than 80% of the population, were unaffected by the aid package except for the resentment that it instilled in them when they observed the relative affluence of their city counterparts compared to their own impoverished state. However, the program was credited with transforming the textile industry, as 25,000 sewing machines were imported {{in the first year of}} its operation.|$|E
5|$|After {{retiring}} as Under Secretary of State in 1954, Smith {{continued to}} serve the <b>Eisenhower</b> <b>administration</b> in various posts. He {{was a member of}} the National Security Training Commission from 1955 to 1957, the National War College board of consultants from 1956 to 1959, the Office of Defense Mobilization Special Stockpile Advisory Committee from 1957 to 1958, the President's Citizen Advisors on the Mutual Security Program from 1956 to 1957, and the President's Committee on Disarmament in 1958. Smith was a consultant at the Special Projects Office (Disarmament) in the Executive Office of the President from 1955 to 1956. He also served as Chairman of the Advisory Council of the President's Committee on Fund Raising, and as a member-at-large from 1958 to 1961. In recognition of his other former boss, he {{was a member of the}} George C. Marshall Foundation Advisory Committee from 1960 to 1961.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{two leaders}} had a strong relationship, by 1960 US {{officials}} were becoming concerned by what they viewed as Canadian procrastination on vital issues, such as whether Canada should join the Organization of American States (OAS). Talks on these issues in June 1960 produced little in results. Diefenbaker hoped that US Vice President Richard Nixon would win the 1960 US presidential election, but when Nixon's Democratic rival, Senator John F. Kennedy won the race, he sent Senator Kennedy a note of congratulations. Kennedy did not respond until Canadian officials asked {{what had become of}} Diefenbaker's note, two weeks later. Diefenbaker, for whom such correspondence was very meaningful, was annoyed at the President-elect's slowness to respond. In January 1961, Diefenbaker visited Washington to sign the Columbia River Treaty. However, with only days remaining in the <b>Eisenhower</b> <b>administration,</b> little else could be accomplished.|$|E

5|$|Born in Ely, Nevada, {{she grew}} up with her two {{brothers}} {{in what is now}} Cerritos, California, graduating from high school in 1929. She attended Fullerton Junior College and later the University of Southern California. She paid for her schooling by working multiple jobs, including pharmacy manager, typist, radiographer, and retail clerk. In 1940, she married lawyer Richard Nixon and they had two daughters. Nixon campaigned for her husband in his successful congressional campaigns of 1946 and 1948. Richard Nixon was elected Vice President in the <b>Eisenhower</b> <b>administration,</b> whereupon Pat undertook many missions of goodwill with her husband and gained favorable media coverage. She assisted her husband in both his unsuccessful 1960 presidential campaign and later in his successful 1968 presidential campaign.|$|E
5|$|His spirits buoyed, Nixon {{sought a}} second term, {{but some of}} Eisenhower's aides aimed to {{displace}} him. In a December 1955 meeting, Eisenhower proposed that Nixon not run for reelection {{in order to give}} him administrative experience before a 1960 presidential run and instead become a Cabinet officer in a second <b>Eisenhower</b> <b>administration.</b> Nixon believed such an action would destroy his political career. When Eisenhower announced his reelection bid in February 1956, he hedged on the choice of his running mate, stating that it was improper to address that question until he had been renominated. Although no Republican was opposing Eisenhower, Nixon received a substantial number of write-in votes against the President in the 1956 New Hampshire primary election. In late April, the President announced that Nixon would again be his running mate. Eisenhower and Nixon were reelected by a comfortable margin in the November 1956 election.|$|E
5|$|However, the {{two nations}} were still working at cross-purposes. The British saw the IRBMs as a step {{on the path to}} an {{independent}} nuclear deterrent, while the Americans saw it as an augmentation of the Strategic Air Command (SAC). The Americans originally envisaged the employment of 120 Thor missiles in four USAF squadrons, the 672nd, 673rd, 674th and 675th Strategic Missile Squadrons, and four RAF squadrons, the first two of which would at first be manned by USAF personnel. The October 1957 Sputnik crisis caused this plan to be modified. It placed the <b>Eisenhower</b> <b>administration</b> under great public pressure to act on the deployment of missiles by a shocked and distraught nation. Sputnik demonstrated the Soviet Union's capability to deploy ICBMs. The United States now needed the IRBMs—and British cooperation—more than ever. The proposal to base USAF Thor squadrons in Britain was dropped on 12 October 1957.|$|E
50|$|During the Truman and <b>Eisenhower</b> <b>administrations,</b> the 319th served three {{periods in}} the {{continental}} United States as a reserve organization. It was inactivated in 1957 when its operational squadrons were assigned directly to its parent wing {{as a result of}} the Air Force tri-deputate reorganization.|$|R
50|$|After U.S. Senator Bob Bartlett, {{a fellow}} Democrat, died in office in 1968, then-Republican Governor Walter Joseph Hickel {{appointed}} Ted Stevens, former U.S. Attorney and a high-level {{official in the}} United States Department of Interior during President Dwight D. <b>Eisenhower's</b> <b>administration,</b> to fill the vacancy.|$|R
50|$|Hibbs {{was never}} {{a part of the}} inner White House Group during the <b>Eisenhower</b> <b>administrations.</b> However, he did remain an {{acquaintance}} of the President and was invited to attend stag dinners and other social functions.

5|$|In Germany, {{there were}} major {{issues to be}} decided. Germany was still {{occupied}} by the Soviet Union, the United States, Great Britain and France. Dealing with the wartime allies was a major task for the high commissioner. West Germany, {{made up of the}} zones occupied by the three western powers, had been granted control of its own affairs, except for defense and foreign policy, in 1949. While most Germans wanted a neutral and reunited Germany, the <b>Eisenhower</b> <b>administration</b> sought to reduce its defense spending by rearming Germany and replacing American troops with Germans. Meanwhile, the House Un-American Activities Committee slammed Conant's staff as communist sympathizers and called for books by communist authors held in United States Information Agency (USIA) libraries in Germany to be burned.|$|E
5|$|Several {{figures in}} Eisenhower's administration, {{including}} Secretary of State John Foster Dulles {{and his brother}} CIA Director Allen Dulles, had {{close ties to the}} United Fruit Company. The Dulles brothers had worked for the law firm of Sullivan & Cromwell, and in that capacity had arranged several deals for the UFC. Undersecretary of State Walter Bedell Smith would later become a director of the company, while the wife of the UFC public relations director was Eisenhower's personal assistant. These personal connections meant that the <b>Eisenhower</b> <b>administration</b> tended to conflate the interests of the UFC with that of U.S. national security interests, and made it more willing to overthrow the Guatemalan government. The success of the 1953 CIA operation to overthrow the democratically elected Prime Minister of Iran also strengthened Eisenhower's belief in using the agency to effect political change overseas.|$|E
5|$|There {{was another}} {{political}} consideration. The Lucky Dragon incident had {{touched off a}} storm of protest, and there were calls from trade unions and the Labour Party for a moratorium on nuclear testing, resulting in a stormy debate in the House of Commons on 5 April 1954 in which Churchill blamed Attlee for the McMahon Act. The new <b>Eisenhower</b> <b>administration</b> in the United States looked favourably on the idea, and the Foreign Secretary, Anthony Eden was sounded out about it by the U.S. Secretary of State, John Foster Dulles. The United States had now finished its Operation Castle series of tests, and such a moratorium would restrict further nuclear weapons development by the Soviet Union; {{but it would also}} lock the United Kingdom into a permanent state of inferiority.|$|E
50|$|US {{policy toward}} China during President Lyndon B. Johnson's {{administration}} remained essentially {{what it had}} been during the Kennedy and <b>Eisenhower</b> <b>administrations</b> — non-recognition of the People's Republic of China (P.R.C.), support for Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist government and its possession of China's seat in the United Nations, and a ban on trade and travel to the PRC.|$|R
50|$|In 1953, after Dwight D. Eisenhower became president, {{the office}} of {{commissioner}} for social security was abolished, {{in favor of a}} new office, the commissioner of social security. After public outcry because Altmeyer's job was eliminated a few days before he could retire with benefits, <b>Eisenhower's</b> <b>administration</b> offered him a one-month appointment to a position, but he refused to accept being paid for a non-job.|$|R
5000|$|In April 1953 Hughes was {{appointed}} {{deputy director of}} the Bureau of the Budget. He became Director of the Bureau in April 1954 following the resignation of Joseph Dodge. As Director, Hughes was responsible for preparing the national budget of the U.S. government. Due to his efforts the 1956 budget produced a surplus. This was the first balanced budget of President Dwight D. <b>Eisenhower's</b> <b>administration.</b>|$|R
5|$|Historians {{and authors}} {{writing about the}} 1954 coup have debated the {{relative}} importance {{of the role of the}} United Fruit Company and the worries about communist influence (whether or not these were grounded in reality) in the U.S.'s decision to instigate the coup in 1954. Several historians have maintained that the lobbying of the UFC, and the expropriation of its lands, were the chief motivation for the U.S., strengthened by the financial ties of individuals within the <b>Eisenhower</b> <b>administration</b> to the UFC. Others have argued that the overthrow was motivated primarily by U.S. strategic interest; the knowledge of the presence of a small number of communists close to Árbenz led the U.S. to reach incorrect conclusions about the extent of communist influence. Yet others have argued that the overthrow was part of a larger tendency within the U.S. to oppose nationalist movements in the Third World. Both the role of the UFC and that of the perception of communist influence continue to be cited as motivations for the U.S.'s actions today.|$|E
5|$|Over time, {{the economists}} in the <b>Eisenhower</b> <b>administration</b> became {{frustrated}} with Diem's refusal to devaluate the piaster once the Republic of Vietnam {{had become a}} stable nation. Diem refused to make the CIP exchange rate equivalent to the free market exchange rate for the two currencies. Although the fixed exchange rate meant that Americans were heavily funding the South Vietnamese economy and that the importing firms could obtain more goods for their money, the rate also meant that South Vietnam goods would not be economically competitive on the export market. Diem was reluctant to cut the currency rate, arguing that it would diminish the value of US aid to South Vietnam and undermine the urban middle class support for his regime as they would resent {{the loss of their}} cheap consumer and luxury goods. In 1963, the US Ambassador Frederick Nolting and his economic advisers exhorted Diem to spend more of the CIP funds on rural development in an attempt to shore up peasant support in the face of increasing communist pressure, but were rebuffed.|$|E
5|$|Árbenz's {{enactment}} of Decree 900 in 1952 provoked Truman to authorize Operation PBFORTUNE, a covert operation to overthrow Árbenz. The plan {{had originally been}} suggested by the US-backed dictator of Nicaragua, Anastasio Somoza García, who {{said that if he}} were given weapons, he could overthrow the Guatemalan government. The operation was to be led by Carlos Castillo Armas. However, the US state department discovered the conspiracy, and secretary of state Dean Acheson persuaded Truman to abort the plan. After being elected president of the US in November 1952, Dwight Eisenhower was more willing than Truman to use military tactics to remove regimes he disliked. Several figures in his administration, including Secretary of State John Foster Dulles and his brother and CIA director Allen Dulles had close ties to the United Fruit Company. Undersecretary of State Bedell Smith later became a director of the UFC, while the wife of the UFC public relations director was Eisenhower's personal assistant. These connections made the <b>Eisenhower</b> <b>administration</b> more willing to overthrow the Guatemalan government.|$|E
50|$|Pius {{had left}} the {{initiative}} to the American president, realizing the complicated situation he faced in the American Congress, which had refused to approve a Papal minister in 1868, thus de facto closing the doors for an American presence at the Vatican.

After the war, Pius supported the Truman and Dwight D. <b>Eisenhower</b> <b>administrations</b> to rebuild war-torn Europe and to defend freedom.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{demonstrates}} how the Truman and <b>Eisenhower</b> <b>administrations</b> sought to avoid direct intervention in Indochina and halt {{the spread of}} communism at the same time. This purpose is achieved through careful analysis of primary and secondary sources, with a particular focus on the primary documentation found in Foreign Relations of the United States: 1952 - 1954. Through examination of these day-by-day recordings and memos, the futility of pursuing the two conflicting aims becomes clear...|$|R
