A prototype L-39 {{anti-aircraft gun}} was completed just before the Winter War, but Lahti made some improvements to the design and the mass-production version was designated L-40. Airforce headquarters ordered a series of 50 guns from Valtion Kivääritehdas (VKT, State Rifle Factory) in January 1940 and a further 120 guns in June 1941. Production was delayed, however, and the first guns were finished only in 1943. Of the total number of 174 guns, 155 were produced in 1943 and 19 in 1944. The guns were distributed to units in small batches soon after they were completed.|$|E

It has been produced since 1999 by Kahr Arms of Worcester, Massachusetts. It is officially known as the [...] "Thompson Semi-Automatic Carbine, Model of 1927A1."

[...] The operator console of the JRSCCS is designated as JRMC and consists of two multifunction color displays and a joy stick, and up to five JRMC consoles can be deployed when required. [...] According to the developer, such five consoles arrangement as the emergency backup of combat data system is located separately from the main combat information center where the combat data system is located to ensure survivability, but it is not known for sure if this configuration had been adopted for Type 052C destroyer.|$|E
