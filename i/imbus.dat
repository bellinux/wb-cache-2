[247] {520}[Among the Imperial troops which Charles de Bourbon led against Rome were {{at least}} six {{thousand}} Landsknechts, ardent converts to the Reformed religion, and eager to prove their zeal by the slaughter of Catholics {{and the destruction of}} altars and crucifixes. Their leader, George Frundsberg, had set out for Rome with the pious intention of hanging the Pope (see The Popes of Rome, by Leopold Ranke, translated by Sarah Austen, 1866, i. 72). Brantôme (Memoirs de Messire Pierre de Bourdeille.... Leyde, 1722, i. 230) gives a vivid picture of their fanatical savagery: [...] "Leur cruauté ne s'estendit pas seulement sur les personnes, mais sur les marbres et les anciennes statuës. Les Lansquenets, qui nouvellement estoient <b>imbus</b> de la nouvelle Religion, et les Espagnols encore aussi bien que les autres, s'habilloient en Cardinaux et evesques en leur habits Pontificaux et se pourmenoient ainsi parray la Ville." ...|$|E

Pulmonary {{function}} tests, respiratory questionnaires, and dust measurements {{were made in}} a cotton spinning plant during the processing of steamed cotton and after its discontinuance. During steaming the average drop in FEV 1 (Δ FEV 1) {{from the beginning to}} six hours into the work shift was 19 ml, and after steaming was discontinued 62 ml. In addition, the FEV 1 measurements, before work {{on the first day of}} the work week, were 60 to 100 ml higher during the time of steaming. The improvement in Δ FEV 1 with steaming was much greater for males than for females. Improvement was greatest in the higher dust areas, namely, opening, picking, blending, and carding, and less in spinning, winding, and twisting. Questionnaire results did not reveal any significant difference in the incidence of symptoms of byssinosis during the two periods, the reasons for which are not clear.

40|$|The case of {{a patient}} with sickle cell disease is {{presented}} in which neuropsychological and magnetic resonance imaging studies were completed prior to and after a right hemispheric stroke. The contri-bution of a new MR perfusion technique in understanding the neurological complications in this patient is discussed. This case illustrates the complex pathophysiology of neuropsychological deficits in SCD and underscores {{the need to develop}} models that better eflect this complexity. Sickle cell disease (SCD) is the homozygous tate for a hemoglobinopathy in which deoxygenation distorts red blood cells. These "sickled " cells may occlude blood vessels in various organs of the body resulting in ischemia, pain, and impaired functioning. It is an inherited isorder in which heterozygotes (sickle cell trait) demonstrate no symptoms. Among African-Americans, it is estimated that one in 12 is a carrier of the trait and that the disease afflicts one in every 500 to 600 live births (DesForges, Milner, Wethers, & Whitten, 1978). Stroke {{is one of the major}} complications of SCD, occurring in 5 %- 17 % of homozygous (SS) patients. Average age for occlusive stroke is 7 years, with the greatest risk being before the age of 15 years (Powars, Wilson, <b>Imbus,</b> Pegelow, & Allen, 1978). Hemorrhagic rathe...|$|E
40|$|Software Reliability Growth Models {{assume that}} the {{application}} under test (AUT) is tested according to its operational profile. However, examining the test practices at different industrial test laboratories this is often not the case. Instead, a systematic approach to testing is taken. The differences in systematic versus operational testing, in particular their effect on the failure count model, is the topic of this paper. After a detailed discussion of {{the advantages and disadvantages}} of systematic and operational testing, the hypergeometric failure model by Rivers and Vouk is presented. In our work problems in the original formulation of the model are resolved and the derivation of the continuous form is more stringent. A different approach to the interpretation of testing efficiency is taken. The model is applied to data collected during a test project at <b>imbus</b> AG and the results of the failure prediction are presented. The paper concludes with an outlook on further research activities. 1 Systematic vs. operational testing One possible way of testing software is using it according to its operational profile. This means that the operations- major system tasks of short duration with processing substantially different from other operations [9]-of the application under test (AUT) have to be determined together with their execution probabilities. Based on these probabilities the number of test cases is allocated to the different program functions. The testers shoul...|$|E
