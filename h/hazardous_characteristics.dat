40|$|Many of the wastes {{generated}} by the DOE complex are both hazardous and radioactive. Mixed wastes must be treated to remove the hazardous waste component before they are disposed as radioactive waste. This paper discusses {{the development of a}} treatment process for mixed wastes that exhibit the reactive <b>hazardous</b> <b>characteristic.</b> Specifically, these wastes react readily and violently with water. Wastes such as lithium hydride (LiH), sodium metal, and potassium metal are the primary wastes in this category. Besides their tendency to react with water, the wastes also produce alkaline hydroxides and hydrogen gas as products of the reactions. If in aqueous form and if the pH exceeds 12. 5, the alkaline hydroxides must be further processed to lower the pH to the range of 2 [...] 12. 5 to remove the corrosive <b>hazardous</b> <b>characteristic.</b> The hydrogen gas formed during treatment is not considered a RCRA hazardous waste, but the hydrogen poses a substantial safety hazard because it can form explosive mixtures with air. Tritium may also be substituted for hydrogen in the LiH. If tritium is present, special processing may be necessary to avoid exhausting tritium into the environment. Because of the requirement to control environmental exposure to radioactivity contained in the wastes, the process design requires a reaction within enclosed vessels. These vessels require inert gas purging with subsequent off-gas scrubbing and high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filtration before discharge to the atmosphere. The process described involves directly immersing the water-reactive waste in a volume of water, controlling the reaction rate by the rate of addition of the waste to the reactor.

40|$|Depleted uranium (DU) {{chips and}} {{turnings}} are generated during machining of uranium metal. Because high surface area uranium is pyrophoric, the turnings {{are subject to}} spontaneous ignition in air. The oxidation of uranium to U 0 {sub 2 } and U{sub 3 } 0 {sub 8 } is highly exothermic and therefore the reaction may be self-sustaining. A uranium fire or even rapid oxidation and thermal convection currents will cause emission of radioactive uranium oxides. In the presence of water as liquid or vapor, uranium may also oxidize into U 0 {sub 2 } and U{sub 3 } 0 {sub 8 }-with generation of hydrogen, a flammable and explosive gas. The heat generated the water reaction may ignite the uranium or hydrogen producing a fire, explosion, or convection current resulting in some uranium oxide becoming airborne. Because the high surface area uranium has the <b>hazardous</b> <b>characteristic</b> of reactivity, it is stored immersed in diesel oil preventing contact with water or air. Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) has developed and constructed a process to remove the reactivity characteristic by oxidizing uranium metal to an inert product. This inert form can then be landfilled as a low-level waste. The treatment process consists of draining the packing oils, treating with sodium hypochlorite to wet-oxidize the DU to uranyl hydroxide (UO{sub 2 }(OH) {sub 2 }), using sodium thiosulfate to reduce the (UO{sub 2 }(OH) 2) to U 0 {sub 2 }, neutralizing with sodium hydroxide, and stabilizing the settled slurry in a cement matrix.

Despite the fact that product labels clearly indicate such contents through the appropriate use of pictograms we are often not aware that such substances have {{become a part of}} our everyday life. It is essential to inform primary school pupils from the lower grade about the presence of such substances in products and about the possibility of potential hazards, so as to be able to ensure adequate handling, prevent accidents and contribute towards environmental protection. At the same time, pupils must - with the implementation of preventive measures - develop knowledge about appropriate behaviour in the event of accidents {{associated with the use of}} hazardous substances. This Master's thesis examines the level of knowledge among school children in the field of identification of hazardous substances in their environment, safe handling of these substances and actions to be taken in case of accidents. The study has been carried out on a sample of 545 pupils (4 th to 9 th grade) from Inner Carniola, Upper Carniola and the Central Slovenian region. Results of the study indicate that knowledge regarding the safe handling of hazardous substances among primary school pupils between 4 th and 9 th grade is gradually developing and improving in certain areas (e. g. understanding of the hazardous substances concept and depiction of hazardous substances on labels), but in other areas (e. g. understanding of the importance of the use of personal protective equipment when working with hazardous substances and proper handling in case of accidents involving hazardous substances) there was no noticeable evidence of progress in pupils’ knowledge in both lower grade and upper grades. It would be reasonable - according to the conclusions of the study and the fact that we are surrounded by hazardous substances at every step - for pupils to acquire additional knowledge on the safety of chemical substances through extracurricular activities; and for teachers from lower grade to attend organised training sessions in the field of integration of the topics covered in this study into regular primary school classes. ...|$|R
