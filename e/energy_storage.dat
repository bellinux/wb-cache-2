5|$|Alternatively, where a {{suitable}} {{head of water}} is not available, pumped-storage hydroelectricity {{or other forms of}} grid <b>energy</b> <b>storage</b> such as compressed air <b>energy</b> <b>storage</b> and thermal <b>energy</b> <b>storage</b> can store energy developed by high-wind periods and release it when needed. The type of storage needed depends on the wind penetration level – low penetration requires daily storage, and high penetration requires both short and long term storage – as long as a month or more. Stored energy increases the economic value of wind energy since it can be shifted to displace higher cost generation during peak demand periods. The potential revenue from this arbitrage can offset the cost and losses of storage. For example, in the UK, the 1.7 GW Dinorwig pumped-storage plant evens out electrical demand peaks, and allows base-load suppliers to run their plants more efficiently. Although pumped-storage power systems are only about 75% efficient, and have high installation costs, their low running costs and ability to reduce the required electrical base-load can save both fuel and total electrical generation costs.|$|E

40|$|Micro {{resistance}} welding {{is an effective}} way to reliably join small-scale parts. It is widely used in electronics and instrument-making. The important particularities of micro {{resistance welding}} are pulse character of energy consumption, non-linear load and special form of current pulses. So, these particularities of welding process cause negative influence on the mains. One of the known ways to avoid it is to use autonomous power supplies for micro resistance welding machines. The important task for building autonomous power supplies is to choose effective <b>energy</b> <b>storages,</b> which have high capacity and small internal resistance, and which are capable to be charged and deliver energy to load very quickly. The solution of this task is seen in using hybrid <b>energy</b> <b>storages,</b> which include accumulators and ultracapacitors. The accumulators are able to provide high energy capacitance and the ultracapacitors are able to provide fast energy delivery. The possibility of application of hybrid <b>energy</b> <b>storages,</b> based on accumulator batteries and ultracapacitors, in micro resistance welding machines is confirmed with computer simulation. Two variants of hybrid <b>energy</b> <b>storages</b> are proposed. These hybrid <b>energy</b> <b>storages</b> have high power and dynamic characteristics, which are sufficient to generate current pulses for welding according to necessary settings...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a proposal for}} a new instrument according to § 64 (1. 6) of the German renewable energy sources act (EEG).

The residual load is the difference between the power demand and the RES generation. As a result, the operation of the CRPP increases the capacity for wind energy penetration in the grid and the market value of RES generation. The introduction of such an instrument stimulates the research and development of CRPP and <b>energy</b> <b>storages.</b> It improves the possibility for plant operators to market RES generation at power exchanges on their own responsibili ty.
