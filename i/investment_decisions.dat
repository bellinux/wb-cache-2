25|$|The {{autonomy}} of the local corporations, however, remained limited.

Investments are financed by foreign grants channeled through the central government. Furthermore, the Boards of the local corporations often did not play an active role. For example, in Ibb the Board met infrequently, did not discuss the corporation's accounts and was reluctant to even discuss a tariff increase. In 2009 a study recommended to transform local corporations into public companies with clear business plans and more autonomy, but this recommendation was not implemented.|$|E

25|$|Hedge fund legal {{structures}} {{vary depending}} on location and the investor(s). US hedge funds aimed at US-based, taxable investors are generally structured as limited partnerships or limited liability companies. Limited partnerships and other flow-through taxation structures assure that investors in hedge funds {{are not subject to}} both entity-level and personal-level taxation. A hedge fund structured as a limited partnership must have a general partner. The general partner may be an individual or a corporation. The general partner serves as the manager of the limited partnership, and has unlimited liability. The limited partners serve as the fund's investors, and have no responsibility for management or <b>investment</b> <b>decisions.</b> Their liability is limited to the amount of money they invest for partnership interests. As an alternative to a limited partnership arrangement, U.S. domestic hedge funds may be structured as limited liability companies, with members acting as corporate shareholders and enjoying protection from individual liability.|$|E
25|$|In finance, {{standard}} deviation {{is often used}} {{as a measure of}} the risk associated with price-fluctuations of a given asset (stocks, bonds, property, etc.), or the risk of a portfolio of assets (actively managed mutual funds, index mutual funds, or ETFs). Risk {{is an important factor in}} determining how to efficiently manage a portfolio of investments because it determines the variation in returns on the asset and/or portfolio and gives investors a mathematical basis for <b>investment</b> <b>decisions</b> (known as mean-variance optimization). The fundamental concept of risk is that as it increases, the expected return on an investment should increase as well, an increase known as the risk premium. In other words, investors should expect a higher return on an investment when that investment carries a higher level of risk or uncertainty. When evaluating investments, investors should estimate both the expected return and the uncertainty of future returns. Standard deviation provides a quantified estimate of the uncertainty of future returns.|$|E

40|$|Purpose – This paper aims to {{introduce}} the reader to investigate some aspects of <b>investment</b> <b>decision</b> making from a constructivist perspective. Design/methodology/approach – The constructivist perspective is introduced in its dual nature of epistemology and of modelization. From constructivist epistemology, the paper mentions the corollaries of theoretical pluralism and cognitive pragmatism. From Kruglanski and Ajzen's Lay epistemology theory, the paper presents in more detail a constructivist modelization for the study and improvement of formal processes of <b>investment</b> <b>decision</b> making. Findings – Beginning from the proposed framework, the paper indicates the lines {{for the development of}} a critical (or reflective) investment decision-making attitude. This is an <b>investment</b> <b>decision</b> making which is able to reflect on its own constructs and cognitive processes in order to develop investment processes with a higher “constructivist awareness” and efficacy. Originality/value – The proposed modelization can contribute to the work of those dedicated to the development of better formal processes of investment.

25|$|The {{process of}} {{matching}} hedge funds to investors {{has traditionally been}} fairly opaque, with investments often driven by personal connections or recommendations of portfolio managers. Many funds disclose their holdings, strategy, and historic performance relative to market indices, giving investors some idea of how their money is being allocated, although individual holdings are often not disclosed. Investors are often drawn to hedge funds {{by the possibility of}} realizing significant returns, or hedging against volatility in the market. The complexity and fees associated with hedge funds are causing some to exit the market – Calpers, the largest pension fund in the US, announced plans to completely divest from hedge funds in 2014. Some services are attempting to improve matching between hedge funds and investors: HedgeZ is designed to allow investors to easily search and sort through funds; iMatchative aims to match investors to funds through algorithms that factor in an investor's goals and behavioral profile, in hopes of helping funds and investors understand the how their perceptions and motivations drive <b>investment</b> <b>decisions.</b>|$|E
25|$|Beginning in {{the late}} colonial period, Massachusetts {{leveraged}} its strong seafaring tradition, advanced shipbuilding industry, {{and access to the}} oceans to make the U.S. the pre-eminent whaling nation in the world by the 1830s. Whale oil was in demand chiefly for lamps. By the 1750s whaling in Nantucket had become a highly lucrative deep-sea industry, with voyages extending for years at a time and with vessels traveling as far as South Pacific waters. The British Navy captured most of the whalers during the revolution, {{but at the same time}} many whalers refitted out as privateers against the British. Whaling recovered after the war as New Bedford became the center. Whalers took greater economic risks to turn major profits: expanding their hunting grounds and securing foreign and domestic workforces for the Pacific. <b>Investment</b> <b>decisions</b> and financing arrangements were set up so that managers of whaling ventures shared their risks by selling some equity claims but retained a substantial portion due to moral hazard considerations. As a result, they had little incentive to consider the correlation between their own returns and those of others in planning their voyages. This stifled diversity in whaling voyages and increased industry-wide risk. After 1860 kerosene replaced whale oil—concurrent with the devastation of the whaling fleet by Confederate commerce raiders—and the entrepreneurs shifted to manufacturing.|$|E
