In order to investigate the peculiarities of <b>financial</b> <b>liability</b> of the employer the author considers the essence of the <b>financial</b> <b>liability</b> institution, analyzes the existing legislation and addresses the judicial practice. In particular, some cases of <b>financial</b> <b>liability</b> of the employer to the employee in labour relations are singled out, for example emergence of financial liability: a) in case of illegal dismissal from work; b) in case of illegal transfer to a different job; c) in case of illegal suspending from a job; d) in case of delay in giving back a service record book at dismissal; e) in case of delay in settling accounts at dismissal and others.

500|$|Cabinet {{members are}} {{prohibited}} from holding any office of profit or actively engaging in any commercial enterprise. In addition, {{they are required to}} comply with a Code of Conduct for Ministers. For example, to counter potential allegations of corruption and unexplained wealth and to avoid potential conflicts between private interests and public responsibilities, the Code requires every Minister, upon appointment to office, to disclose in confidence to the President through the Prime Minister all sources of income other than his salary as a Minister and as an MP. This must include all assets, such as financial assets, real property, interests in any company or professional practice, and any other substantial personal assets as well as <b>financial</b> <b>liabilities,</b> including mortgages and borrowings. A Minister must also [...] "scrupulously avoid any actual or apparent conflict of interest between his office and his private financial interests". Thus, a Minister is not permitted to accept any favour of any kind from persons in negotiation with, or seeking to obtain any licence or enter into any contractual relations with, the Government, or to use official information that comes to him as a Minister for his own private profit or the profit of any family member or associate.|$|E

We argue that (1) governments and donors should recognize the magnitude of the problem and develop tools to manage the liability; (2) allocation of aid should be more rational, transparent and sustainable; (3) more fiscal space should be created domestically; (4) borrowing offers some limited potential for prevention interventions characterized by high returns on investment and (5) efficiency gains, while not in themselves likely to bridge the resourcing gap, should be energetically pursued...|$|R
