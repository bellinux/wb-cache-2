5|$|Pather Panchali <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> script; it {{was made}} from Ray's {{drawings}} and notes.

Years later, he donated those drawings and notes to Cinémathèque Française.|$|E

5|$|Seo {{was born}} in Seoul, South Korea. Her mother, aunt, and {{grandmother}} all studied fine arts and she, along with her two older and younger brothers, studied piano and took swimming lessons.

5|$|The Old Bridge was so steep {{that horse}} carts had {{difficulty}} crossing it. By 1857, a new bridge, the Victoria Bridge, was built {{next to the}} Old Bridge, which was {{paid for by the}} people of Pontypridd.

50|$|If <b>a</b> surface <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> {{tangent plane}} at <b>a</b> point, it <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> normal {{at that point}} either. For example, <b>a</b> cone <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> normal at its tip nor does it <b>have</b> <b>a</b> normal {{along the edge of}} its base. However, the normal to the cone is defined almost everywhere. In general, it is {{possible}} to define a normal almost everywhere for a surface that is Lipschitz continuous.|$|R
50|$|The power {{spectrum}} of this example is not continuous, and therefore <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> derivative, and therefore this signal <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> {{power spectral density}} function. In general, the {{power spectrum}} will usually be the sum of two parts: a line spectrum such as in this example, which is <b>not</b> continuous and <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> density function, and a residue, which is absolutely continuous and does <b>have</b> <b>a</b> density function.|$|R

5|$|The {{flag was}} {{designed}} in 1901 by John Eisenmann for the Pan-American Exposition and adopted in 1902.

One unsuccessful proposal called for a design based on the state seal.|$|E
5|$|The game {{originally}} <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> cooperative multiplayer mode, as {{the development}} team {{thought that it}} would distract from the tonally darker levels of the single-player campaign, not matching the game's narrative. However, a cooperative mode was still added to the game in August 2012 as free downloadable content; it does not follow the storyline of the campaign.|$|E
50|$|The Almirante Padilla class <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> hangar facility, {{and thus}} <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> {{embarked}} helicopter.

5|$|The map the Workmans {{made during}} this trip was of low quality. According to Mason, the couple <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> {{good sense of}} {{topographical}} direction, which meant that their measurements were inaccurate and unusable by the Survey of India.|$|E
5|$|The mosque at Ajdabiya in Libya had {{a similar}} plan, {{although}} {{it did not have}} the same monumental entrance. Like the Mahdiya mosque, for the same ideological reasons, the Ajdabiya mosque <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> minaret.|$|E
5|$|The party's {{economic}} policies did not deviate substantially from the generally supported mixed {{economy of the}} Netherlands. Its other demands <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> strong ideological coherency. Supporting a generous welfare state for the Dutch people, it was otherwise sceptical of state interventionism in the economy; notably by high taxes which would hinder private initiative, or overspending on subsidies.|$|E
50|$|Let's consider, {{for further}} explanation, an example used by Bolzano. The idea round square, <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> object, because the object {{that ought to}} be {{represented}} is self-contrary. A different example is the idea nothing which certainly <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> object. However, the proposition idea of <b>a</b> round square <b>has</b> complexity has as its subject-idea idea of a round square. This subject-idea does <b>have</b> <b>an</b> object, namely the idea round square. But, that idea <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> object.|$|R
