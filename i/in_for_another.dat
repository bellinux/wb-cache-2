Resuming her trooping runs on 29 September, Pułaski began a year of almost continuous sailing. During this span, which lasted until mid-September 1944, the ship called at Bombay twice in addition to numerous stops in Aden, Suez, Durban, and Kilindini. Putting in at Durban on 15 September, Pułaski had a general refit {{over the next four}} months.|$|E
5|$|Dhoni {{returned}} to the team as captain for the second match at Brisbane where Kohli scored 19 and 1 in a four-wicket defeat for India. In the Melbourne Boxing Day Test, Kohli was India's top-scorer in both innings. He made his personal best Test score of 169 in the first innings while sharing a 262-run partnership with Rahane, India's biggest partnership outside Asia in ten years. Kohli followed it with a score of 54 in India's second innings on the fifth day, helping his team draw the Test match. Dhoni announced his retirement from Test cricket {{at the conclusion of}} this match, and Kohli was appointed as the full-time Test captain ahead of the fourth Test at Sydney. Captaining the Test team for the second time, Kohli hit 147 in the first innings of the match and became the first batsman in Test cricket history to score three hundreds in his first three innings as Test captain. He was dismissed for 46 in the second innings and India hung <b>in</b> <b>for</b> <b>another</b> draw. Kohli's total of 692 runs in four Tests was the most by any Indian batsman in a Test series in Australia.|$|E
5|$|Schleswig-Holstein was the {{flagship}} {{of the fleet}} until 1932 when she was taken <b>in</b> <b>for</b> <b>another</b> reconstruction that converted her into a training vessel. As a result, Schlesien held the position of fleet flagship afterward. In 1932, Wilhelm Canaris took command of the ship, a post he held for two years. In May 1935, the Reichsmarine was again reorganized as the Kriegsmarine. Shortly after, Schlesien took part in extensive fleet maneuvers with the new heavy cruiser Deutschland. Later that year, Schlesien was converted into a training ship. Among the modifications were the installation of additional anti-aircraft guns and replacement of the ship's boilers. The newer boilers were more efficient, which allowed fewer {{of them to be}} used; the additional space this created was used as crew compartments for the cadets and an instruction room. The crew was also altered; the standard crew had been 35 officers and 708 enlisted men; after the conversion, this was reduced to 29 officers and 559 sailors, supplemented by 214 cadets. The following year, Schlesien toured the Americas; in March 1937 the ship stopped in Halifax, Nova Scotia. Later that year in December, she stopped in Mar del Plata, Argentina. In 1938, the ship visited Samaná Bay in the Dominican Republic.|$|E

5|$|The Browns next {{played the}} Rockets {{for a second}} time in as many weeks, this time in Cleveland. The Rockets opened the scoring with a 74-yard pass from quarterback Jesse Freitas to {{receiver}} Eddie Prokop in the first four minutes of the game, and added a field goal by Jim McCarthy {{near the end of the}} second quarter. The Browns did not score in the first half, but came back to win the game in the second. Rockets defenders were double-teaming Cleveland's ends, and the Browns adjusted by sending halfbacks out to receive deep passes. Cleveland halfbacks Dub Jones and Bill Boedeker both caught long touchdown passes from Graham in the third quarter. Boedeker ran <b>in</b> <b>for</b> <b>another</b> touchdown in the fourth quarter to make the final score 21–10. As in the previous game, there were several cases of rough play: tackle Lou Rymkus was ejected from the game for hitting Jim Pearcy of the Rockets. A Rockets player picked up a handful of sand from the stadium's baseball infield and threw it in Mac Speedie's face during the game, temporarily blinding him. Hirsch was accidentally kicked by a Browns player and suffered a skull fracture.|$|E

25|$|Historians, {{constitutional}} {{scholars and}} biographers all dismiss the claim.

Furthermore, the Constitution doesn't require the President-elect to take {{the oath of office}} to hold the office, just to execute the powers. As Atchison never swore the oath either, that did not make him Acting President. Most historians and scholars assert that as soon as the outgoing President's term expires, the President-elect automatically assumes the office. Some claim instead that the office is vacant until the taking of the oath.|$|E

25|$|Cleveland handily {{beat the}} Steelers {{at home in}} their seventh game of the season. It was a {{breakout}} performance for Motley, who had 11 carries for 188 yards and two touchdown runs. A 61-yard return of the opening kickoff by Phelps set up the Browns' first touchdown, a short rush by Graham {{two and a half}} minutes into the first period. After stopping a pair of long Pittsburgh drives in the second quarter, Cleveland advanced to the Steelers' two-yard line but had to settle for a Groza field goal. Near the end of the half, Motley caught a pass from Graham and ran it <b>in</b> <b>for</b> <b>another</b> touchdown, putting Cleveland ahead 17–0. An interception by Gorgal on Pittsburgh's first drive of the third quarter led to Motley's second touchdown, a 69-yard run. Another interception by Jim Martin and a touchdown catch on the next drive by Phelps gave the Browns their fourth touchdown of the game and a commanding lead. Pittsburgh scored a touchdown on a two-play, 80-yard drive in the fourth quarter, but Cleveland added two more touchdowns {{at the end of the}} game to win 45–7.|$|E
