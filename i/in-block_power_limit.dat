We evaluate RAPL by setting <b>power</b> <b>limits</b> and running a number of standard benchmarks. We quantify RAPL along five metrics: stability, accuracy, settling time, overshoot, and efficiency. The first four are standard measures for evaluating con-trol systems. The last recognizes that any power control approach should deliver {{the highest possible performance}} achievable within the <b>power</b> <b>limit.</b> Our results show that RAPL performs well on the four standard metrics, but some benchmarks fail to achieve maxi-mum performance.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{we look at}} the most cost- {{effective}} trajectory for <b>power</b> <b>limited</b> rockets, i. e. the trajectory which costs the least amount of propellant. First some background information as well as the differences between thrust <b>limited</b> and <b>power</b> <b>limited</b> rockets will be discussed. Then the optimal trajectory for thrust limited rockets, the Hohmann Transfer Orbit, will be explained. Using Optimal Control Theory, the optimal trajectory for <b>power</b> <b>limited</b> rockets can be found. Three trajectories will be discussed: Low Earth Orbit to Geostationary Earth Orbit, Earth to Mars and Earth to Saturn. After this we compare the propellant use of the thrust limited rockets for these trajectories with the <b>power</b> <b>limited</b> rockets. Here we made this comparison between a conventional thrust limited rocket with a specic impulse of 455 seconds and the VASIMR rocket for the <b>power</b> <b>limited</b> rocket. Also the initial mass of both rocket types was taken as 5 * 10 ^ 5 kg. Lastly, {{we take a look at}} a gravity assist. Gravity assists can help reduce propellant use even further. Therefore we will once more look at the trajectory for a <b>power</b> <b>limited</b> rocket from Earth to Saturn. Only this time we use a gravity assist from Jupiter. Then we can see if the propellant use is indeed even lower when using the gravity assist. We find that the the <b>power</b> <b>limited</b> rocket becomes more fuel-effcient as travel time increases. Also using a gravity assist further reduces propellant consumption. Applied Mathematic...|$|R
