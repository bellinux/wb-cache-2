With a complex business structure to unravel, some commentators <b>expect</b> <b>it</b> may take years for the company's collapse to be fully resolved. By April 2010, timber company Gunns had taken over as the responsible entity running most of Great Southern's pulpwood schemes, but the land on which they were being grown was yet to be sold.|$|E

Director Martin Koolhoven said, when Schnitzel Paradise (2005) received the award, {{that he did not}} expect his film to be such a success. Schnitzel Paradise was his first commercially successful film. Fifteen-year-old Sem Veeger, lead actress in the film Keep Off (2006), said she knew that many people had seen the film, but she did not <b>expect</b> <b>it</b> to receive a Golden Film.|$|E

In an interview with IGN in June 2015, game director Warren Spector said he never expected Deus Ex to sell many copies, but he did <b>expect</b> <b>it</b> to become a cult classic among a smaller strong community, and he continues to receive fan mail from players to date regarding their experiences and thoughts about Deus Ex.|$|E

Gray dismisses its positives as merely being {{that he was able to}} complete the poem, which was probably influenced by his experience of the churchyard at Stoke Poges, where he attended the Sunday service and was able to visit the grave of Antrobus.|$|E
5|$|Historian Ramsay Weston Phipps {{believed}} that Charles might have remained along the Rhine and defeated the French armies {{one after the}} other. Unlike the divided command of the French, the Austrians enjoyed unity of command. After Ettlingen, Phipps thought that the correct French strategy was for the two French armies to join. However, this {{was not part of}} Carnot's plan, which was for each army to operate against the Austrian flanks. Carnot's strategy had succeeded in 1794 during the Flanders Campaign and he expected that it would win again. However, in 1794 the Coalition was made up of several countries with different vulnerabilities, while in 1796 Charles could issue a command and <b>expect</b> <b>it</b> to be obeyed. The next clash would be the Battle of Neresheim on 11 August.|$|E
5|$|Zotov {{was not a}} {{religious}} scholar, but he knew the Bible well—an important qualification for Tsaritsa Natalia. Although he did not <b>expect</b> <b>it,</b> he was well rewarded before he had even started his work, receiving from Feodor and the Tsaritsa, as well as Patriarch Joachim, gifts including a set of apartments, two new sets of clothing, and 100 rubles. He was also raised {{to the rank of}} a minor nobleman. Zotov was deeply humbled and overwhelmed by the Tsaritsa's request, and was enthralled at the prospect of teaching Peter. Zotov and Peter quickly became good friends, and Zotov remained close to Peter until the former's death.|$|E

5|$|After {{the capture}} of Breville the {{division}} was not attacked in force again, apart from an almost continuous artillery bombardment between 18 and 20June. Further reinforcements arrived east of the River Orne on 20July, when the 49th (West Riding) Infantry Division moved into {{the line between the}} 6th Airborne and the 51st (Highland) Division. On 7August Gale was ordered to prepare the division to move over to the offensive, with its objective being the mouth of the River Seine. The three divisions east of the Orne together became I Corps; its commander, Lieutenant General John Crocker, knowing that the 6th Airborne had almost no artillery, vehicles or engineer equipment, did not <b>expect</b> <b>it</b> to advance very quickly. To reach the Seine, the division would have to cross three major rivers. There were two main lines of advance, the road running along the coast and another road further inland from Troarn to Pont Audemer. The commando brigade and the two parachute brigades would use the inland route, with the 3rd Parachute Brigade being responsible for the breakout when the time was right.|$|E
5|$|The first Christian {{hard rock}} group was {{possibly}} the California-based band Agape, {{formed in the}} late 1960s. Known for their psychedelic rock and blues influences, the band released an album titled Gospel Hard Rock in 1971, followed by Victims of Tradition in 1972. After Agape, the Resurrection Band was formed in 1972 in Milwaukee's Jesus People community and released the hard rock album Music to Raise the Dead in 1974. The Swedish group Jerusalem was formed in 1975 and is cited as another early Christian hard rock group. In 1978, Resurrection Band released its album Awaiting Your Reply and Jerusalem released Jerusalem (Volume 1). Both albums had a notable impact on Christian music culture. During that time, heavy metal was a new style of music for the Christian music industry, and many Christian labels did not <b>expect</b> <b>it</b> to sell well. However, Awaiting Your Reply hit big in the Christian market, and reached No. 6 on the Gospel album sales charts. Jerusalem also became an instant hit among listeners, and within {{the first six months}} the record sold 20,000 copies, unheard of within the genre of Christian rock in Europe. The Canadian Daniel Band is cited among the first bands, as is Barnabas.|$|E

25|$|Craig Evans {{states that}} an {{argument}} in favor of the partial authenticity of the Testimonium is that the passage does not exaggerate the role played by the Jewish leaders in the death of Jesus. According to Evans, if the passage had been an interpolation after the emergence of conflicts between Jews and Christians, it would have had a more accusative tone, but in its current form reads as one would <b>expect</b> <b>it</b> to read for a passage composed by Josephus {{towards the end of the}} first century.|$|E

Michigan authorities think the lawsuit is frivolous and <b>expect</b> <b>it</b> to be dismissed, noting that it is legally impossible because of Abuelazam's life without parole status, since convicts can not be deported until their full sentence is served.|$|E

Lucy later attempts to return to Narnia via the wardrobe, but Professor Kirke tells her he has tried for many years, and they will probably return to Narnia when they least <b>expect</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
25|$|NWT {{residents}} {{have a right}} to use any of the above languages in a territorial court and in debates and proceedings of the legislature. However, laws are legally binding only in their French and English versions, and the NWT government only publishes laws and other documents in the territory's other official languages when the legislature asks it to. Furthermore, access to services in any language is limited to institutions and circumstances where there is significant demand for that language or where it is reasonable to <b>expect</b> <b>it</b> given the nature of the services requested. In practical terms, English language services are universally available, and {{there is no guarantee that}} other languages, including French, will be used by any particular government service except for the courts.|$|E
25|$|When a court protects an applicant's {{substantive}} legitimate expectation, it {{is effectively}} mandating {{the outcome of}} a public body's decision-making process. One criticism is that this undesirably fetters the body's discretion as it will {{no longer be able to}} formulate policy without constraints. Nevertheless, it has been acknowledged that protecting substantive legitimate expectations ensures good administration. Consistency and fairness are reinforced in decision-making processes where the administrative power to alter policy is not used to unduly frustrate legitimate expectations. Furthermore, when a public body acts contrary to what it had induced an individual to <b>expect,</b> <b>it</b> may cause that individual severe hardship, especially if he or she relied on the representation and there is no satisfactory alternative to the substance of the promise. The problem is alleviated if the court orders that the individual's legitimate expectation be given effect.|$|E
