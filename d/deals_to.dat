5|$|Despite Paramount's {{failure to}} build a {{national}} broadcast television network, the company retained KTLA, and executives at Paramount continued to toy {{with the idea of}} entering the television medium once more. Paramount sold its library of shorts and cartoons in separate <b>deals</b> <b>to</b> U.M. & M. TV Corporation, Associated Artists Productions and Harvey Comics (the Superman cartoons were already sold to National Comics when Paramount's license to Superman expired). In 1957, Paramount sold most of its pre-1950 sound live action feature film library to EMKA, Ltd., a subsidiary of MCA. The live action films would end up with what became Universal Television after MCA bought Universal Pictures in 1962.
