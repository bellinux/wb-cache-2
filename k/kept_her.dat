5|$|An {{elaborate}} and oppressive system of rules regulating {{every facet of}} Victoria's life, it <b>kept</b> <b>her</b> in reclusive isolation most of the time, {{with the goal of}} making her weak, compliant and utterly dependent upon her mother and Conroy. The intention was for the Duchess to be appointed regent upon Victoria's (assumed youthful) ascension and for Conroy to be created Victoria's private secretary and given a peerage.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{problems}} with her powerplant <b>kept</b> <b>her</b> initial service relatively brief and inactive. Assigned to duty with North Atlantic Blockading Squadron, Dictator cruised on the Atlantic coast from 15 December 1864 until placed {{out of commission}} on 5 September 1865 at the League Island Navy Yard. She remained in ordinary there until 1869.|$|E

5|$|She {{suffered}} from poor health and had several surgeries to correct problems with osteoporosis.

5|$|After Dickinson's death, Lavinia Dickinson <b>kept</b> <b>her</b> {{promise and}} burned {{most of the}} poet's correspondence. Significantly though, Dickinson had left no {{instructions}} about the 40 notebooks and loose sheets gathered in a locked chest. Lavinia recognized the poems' worth and became obsessed with seeing them published. She turned first to her brother's wife and then to Mabel Loomis Todd, her brother's mistress, for assistance. A feud ensued, with the manuscripts divided between the Todd and Dickinson houses, preventing complete publication of Dickinson's poetry {{for more than half}} a century.|$|E
5|$|After the Ottoman Empire entered World War I, Berk-i Satvet was {{employed}} in patrols in the Black Sea. These included attacks on Russian ports with the ex-German warships Yavuz Sultan Selim and Midilli. In January 1915, Berk-i Satvet struck a naval mine while escorting a convoy to Zonguldak; the explosion severely damaged {{the ship and}} <b>kept</b> <b>her</b> out of service until April 1918. For {{the remainder of the}} war, she patrolled the Black Sea. The ship was renamed Berk in 1923 and modernized twice, in the mid-1920s and in the late-1930s. She remained in service until 1944, when she was stricken from the naval register. Berk was ultimately broken up for scrap in 1953–55.|$|E

She saw {{communism}} as {{the shape of the}} future, and when the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB) was formed in the summer of 1920, Wilkinson was {{one of a group of}} ILP members with Marxist leanings who became founder members. For the next few years the CPGB was the main focus of her political activity, although she <b>kept</b> <b>her</b> membership in the Labour Party, which at the time accepted dual CPGB/Labour memberships.|$|E

5|$|Areas annexed by France {{during the}} Napoleonic era {{were the first}} to inherit the metric system. In 1812, Napoleon {{introduced}} a system known as mesures usuelles, which used the names of pre-metric units of measure, but defined them in terms of metric units – for example, the livre metrique (metric pound) was 500g and the toise metrique (metric fathom) was 2metres. After the Congress of Vienna in 1815, France lost the territories that she had annexed; some, such as the Papal States reverted to their pre-revolutionary units of measure, others such as Baden adopted {{a modified version of the}} mesures usuelles, but France <b>kept</b> <b>her</b> system of measurement intact.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{her years}} of service, {{she had never}} {{received}} a regular salary and was for years denied compensation. Her unofficial status and the unequal payments offered to black soldiers caused great difficulty in documenting her service, and the U.S. government was slow in recognizing its debt to her. Tubman did not receive a pension for her service in the Civil War until 1899. Her constant humanitarian work for her family and former slaves, meanwhile, <b>kept</b> <b>her</b> {{in a state of}} constant poverty, and her difficulties in obtaining a government pension were especially taxing for her.|$|E

5|$|Freeborn Roman {{women were}} {{considered}} citizens throughout the Republic and Empire, {{but did not}} vote, hold political office, or serve in the military. A mother's citizen status determined that of her children, {{as indicated by the}} phrase ex duobus civibus Romanis natos ("children born of two Roman citizens"). A Roman woman <b>kept</b> <b>her</b> own family name (nomen) for life. Children most often took the father's name, but in the Imperial period sometimes made their mother's name part of theirs, or even used it instead.|$|E
5|$|From late 1918, {{the ships}} {{were used to}} escort convoys part-way across the Atlantic. In late September, Minnesota struck a naval mine laid by the German U-boat U-117, causing serious damage that <b>kept</b> <b>her</b> out of service for five months. Convoy duty was cut short by the German {{surrender}} in November; thereafter, the Connecticuts were used to ferry American soldiers back from the battlefields of France. This work was completed by mid-1919. The ships briefly operated as training ships in the early 1920s, though {{under the terms of}} the Washington Naval Treaty, they were all sold for scrap by 1924 and broken up.|$|E
