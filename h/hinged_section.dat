50|$|As such, gateleg {{tables are}} {{a subset of the}} type known as a dropleaf. The <b>hinged</b> <b>section,</b> or flap, was {{supported}} on pivoted legs joined at the top and bottom by stretchers constituting a gate. Large flaps had two supports, which had the advantage of providing freer leg space in the centre. The earliest gateleg tables of the 16th and 17th century were typically made of oak.|$|E
50|$|The two roller {{coasters}} are raised via a vertical lift {{instead of the}} traditional lifthill. The Winjas feature a unique <b>hinged</b> <b>section</b> of track about halfway through, with Fear collapsing forward and Force banking sideways in order to continue. The two coasters travel on separate tracks and are intertwined in the main hall of Wuze Town. At {{the very end of}} the ride, a little surprise element is built in, which shortly drops a section of track a few feet and raises it again.|$|E
50|$|The Riggenbach {{rack system}} used a ladder rack, formed of steel {{channels}} connected by square rungs at regular intervals, {{to engage the}} pinion wheels of the rack engine. The rungs of the NZASM rack track were spaced 4 in apart. To ensure correct meshing of the gears when entering the rack section, engaging pieces of special section, 6 ft long and fitted with round-bar rungs, were hinged to {{each end of the}} rack, supported by a spiral spring underneath. When the rack engine made contact with the <b>hinged</b> <b>section</b> and the gear wheels did not mesh with the rack correctly, the engaging section would be pressed down until correct meshing was accomplished.|$|E

50|$|In {{common with}} other steroid receptors, the {{progesterone}} receptor has a N-terminal regulatory domain, a DNA binding domain, a <b>hinge</b> <b>section,</b> and a C-terminal ligand binding domain. A special transcription activation function (TAF), called TAF-3, {{is present in}} the progesterone receptor-B, in a B-upstream segment (BUS) at the amino acid terminal. This segment is not present in the receptor-A.|$|R
50|$|The Visa's rear {{parcel shelf}} was in two <b>hinged</b> <b>sections,</b> one in the car, {{the other on the}} tailgate, to allow objects that were {{slightly}} too tall to still fit without removing the shelf. When carrying larger loads, the part of the shelf attached to the tailgate could be folded up, and fixed with the elasticated support strings, to protect the rear window and heated rear screen elements.|$|R
50|$|A {{drop-leaf table}} is a table that has a fixed section {{in the center and}} a <b>hinged</b> <b>section</b> (leaf) on either side that can be folded down (dropped). If the leaf is {{supported}} by a bracket when folded up, the table is simply a drop-leaf table; if the leaf is supported by legs that swing out from the center, it is known as a gate leg table. These tables can be made of a variety of woods from Cherry to Walnut, to Maple or Mahogany. Depending on the style or drop leaf or gate leg tables, the leaves vary from coming almost down to the floor to only coming down slightly. Uses vary from drop leaf dining tables, night stands, side tables, coffee tables,and desks.|$|E
5000|$|A slotted {{plain flap}} where the flap is fixed below the {{trailing}} {{edge of the}} wing, rotating about its forward edge, and usually forming the [...] "inboard" [...] <b>hinged</b> <b>section</b> (closer to the root) of the Junkers Doppelflügel, or [...] "double-wing" [...] style of wing trailing edge control surfaces (including the outboard-mounted ailerons), which hung just below and behind the wing's fixed trailing edge. When not in use, it has more drag than other types, but is more effective at creating additional lift than a plain or split flap, while retaining their mechanical simplicity. Invented by Otto Mader at Junkers in the late 1920s, they were most often seen on the Junkers Ju 52 and the Junkers Ju 87 Stuka dive bomber, though the same wing control surface can be also be found on many modern ultralights, like the Denney Kitfox.|$|E
50|$|The {{fuselage}} of the ES-49 {{is a deep}} sided hexagon {{apart from}} the nose ahead of the cockpit, where an extra singly curved, horizontal panel is inserted for greater visibility. The aft seat is under {{the leading edge of}} the wing. Initially the ES-49 had separate, open cockpits but the first prototype later had a multi-panelled canopy enclosing the forward seat but not that of the instructor. The second prototype had a canopy which enclosed both occupants, an arrangement adopted by production aircraft which have tubular steel framed glazing, with a short, upward <b>hinged</b> <b>section</b> for the instructor who also has under wing side windows and an overhead transparency in the leading edge. The fuselage tapers to the rear, where the straight tapered, blunt tipped tailplane and elevators, covered with a mixture of ply and fabric, are mounted on top. A long trim tab fills the trailing edge of the starboard elevator. Since the elevator hinge is ahead of the fin, only a small cut-out for rudder movement is required. The fin is narrow and short, mounting a balanced rudder with a straight tapered trailing edge and rounded tip which reaches down to the keel. The second prototype had a shorter fuselage and so had a larger area, almost finless, double straight tapered rudder but the production ES-49s reverted to the first prototype's longer fuselage and smaller rudder. The ES-49 lands on a single semi-recessed, unbraked monowheel, assisted under the nose and cockpit by a sprung skid and by a smaller skid under the tail.|$|E

5000|$|A U-nut is {{very similar}} to a J-nut except that both legs are the same length. Because of this a {{retaining}} clip is usually formed on the leg without the threads. This helps keep the nut in place while not screwed down. The thread may be of a speed nut style, integrated nut, or have an extruded portion that is tapped.There are [...] "standard" [...] and [...] "wide-panel" [...] versions; the standard version has a solid <b>hinge</b> <b>section,</b> whereas the wide-panel version has a longer hinge with the center section cut-away to allow for easier installation.|$|R

The deflection of the ailerons {{of the aircraft}} causes the rolling motion. The aileron is a <b>hinged</b> <b>section</b> {{at the rear of}} each wing. The ailerons work in opposition; when the right aileron goes up, the left aileron goes down.|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{elucidate}} the structure-antibiotic activity relationships of the peptides, the three-dimensional structures of two hybrid peptides, CA(1 - 8) - MA(1 - 12) and CA(1 - 8) - ME(1 - 12) in trifluoroethanol-containing aqueous solution were investigated by NMR spectroscopy. Both CA(1 - 8) - MA(1 - 12) and CA(1 - 8) - ME(1 - 12) have strong antibacterial activity but only CA(1 - 8) - ME(1 - 12) has hemolytic activity against human erythrocytes. CA(1 - 8) - MA(1 - 12) has a hydrophobic 310 -helix {{of only two}} turns combined with one short helix in the N-terminus with a flexible <b>hinge</b> <b>section</b> in between. CA(1 - 8) - MA(1 - 12) has a severely bent structure {{in the middle of}} the peptide. These structural features as well as the low hydrophobicity of CA(1 - 8) - MA(1 - 12) seem to be crucial for the selective lysis against the membrane of prokaryotic cells. CA(1 - 8) - ME(1 - 12) has an α-helical structure of about three turns in the melittin domain and a flexible structure with one turn in the cecropin domain connected with a flexible <b>hinge</b> <b>section</b> in between, and these might be the structural features required for membrane distruption against prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. The central hinge region (Gly 9 - Ile 10 -Gly 11) in an amphipathic antibacterial peptide is considered to play an important role in providing the conformational flexibility required for ion channel formation of the C-terminal hydrophobic α-helix on cell membrane. ope...|$|R

5000|$|Eastern {{box turtles}} have many uniquely {{identifying}} characteristics {{as part of}} the box turtle group. While the female's plastron is flat, it is concave in males so the male may fit over the back end of the female's carapace during mating. The front and back of the plastron are connected by a flexible hinge. When in danger, the turtle is able to close the plastron by pulling the <b>hinged</b> <b>sections</b> closely against the carapace, effectively sealing the soft body in bone, hence forming a [...] "box". The shell is made of bone covered by living vascularized tissue and covered with a layer of keratin. This shell is connected to the body through its fused rib cage which makes the shell permanently attached and not removable.|$|R

40|$|Measurements are {{presented}} {{of the initial}} rates of depressurization generated within ductile steel pipes in pneumatic rupture tests. The breach was initiated by failure of an axial, part-through, flat-bottomed defect machined in the outer surface of the pipe. The measured depressurization rates for supercritical defects are shown to be in agreement with values predicted by a theoretical model which assumes that the pipe hinges open. Where the initial defects are longer than two pipe diameters, {{the extent of the}} <b>hinging</b> <b>section</b> is defined by the initial defect length. For short initial defects, a significant breach does not develop until the defect has propagated axially to a length of the order of two pipe diameters, and hence the effective hinging length is two pipe diameters Initial depressurization rates for subcritical defects correlate with the Folias bulging parameters. ...|$|R

40|$|Background : Baksi sloppy hinge elbow is an all metal {{prosthesis}} having 7 0 - 10 0 varus - valgus inherent laxity at the <b>hinge</b> <b>section</b> {{with minimal}} motion bearing contact area. Due {{to the presence}} of laxity at it&#x 2032;s <b>hinge</b> <b>section,</b> any strain on the prosthesis dissipates primarily to the surrounding soft tissues thus protecting the cement bone interfaces. However, from our long term clinical experiences on the use of our sloppy hinge design since 1984 and the knowledge of literature review of the results of using other semi-constrained (sloppy) or unconstrained designs, it was observed that radiolucency or loosening at the bone-cement interface occurred mainly around the humeral stem in the long run due to the continued effect of rotational torque of forearm and hand. Hence, an attempt in the improvement of the design concept is being made. Methods : In this respect one flange each of one cm height and breadth and three mm thickness has been incorporated on either sides of the shank of humeral stem of the sloppy hinge at medio-lateral (coronal) plane which will be seated in the corresponding longitudinal groove cut on either side of humeral shaft extending from its transverse cut end to become single assembly during the rotation of humerus. Results : The preliminary results of clinical application of the modified sloppy hinge elbow in ten cases are found satisfactory. Conclusion : The cyclical compression and distraction forces during flexion and extension of the elbow will be distributed over the larger bony area of lower end of humerus where flanges of the humeral shank being seated. The rotational torque effect of forearm and hand particularly with the arm in abduction will be minimised at the humeral bone cement interface as the humerus and the prosthetic stem act as a single assembly by the snugly fitting of the prosthetic flange in the humural shaf...|$|R

40|$|Cecropin B 1 (CB 1) {{with two}} amphipathic alpha-helical {{segments}} is a derivative {{of the natural}} antibacterial peptide, cecropin B. The assays of cell lysis show that, compared with cecropin A (CA), CB 1 has a similar ability to lyse bacteria with a higher potency (two- to six-fold higher) in killing cancer cells. The difference {{may be due to}} the fact that the peptides possess different structures and sequences. In this study, the solution structure of CB 1 in 20 % hexafluoroisopropanol was determined by two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The H- 1 NMR resonances were assigned. A total of 350 inter-proton distances were used to calculate the solution structure of CB 1. The final ensemble structures were well converged, showing the minimum root mean square deviation. The results indicate that CB 1 has two stretches of helices spanning from residues 3 to 22 and from residues 26 to 33, which are connected by a <b>hinge</b> <b>section</b> formed by Gly- 23 and Pro- 24. Lys- 25 is partially incorporated in the hinge region. The bent angle between two helical segments located in two planes was between 100 and 110 degrees.
