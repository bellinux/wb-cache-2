40|$|Nowadays, {{examination}} {{is one of}} {{the important}} process in education. It is either done orally, in the form of written paper and practiced-based examination as well as participating in a course work. The rapid and constant paces of technology changing are creating both opportunities and challenges for schools and higher education community such as the universities. One of the challenges is the leakage of question papers before the <b>final</b> <b>examination</b> being conducted. The quality of the education system and the achievement of its objective are exposed to a serious threat with actions and practices that weaken the credibility of examination. In some countries, a centralized examination system is used and most education community does not realize the occurrence of <b>final</b> <b>examination</b> question paper leakage. It can affects the candidates in the whole country where the exam can be postponed or cancelled due to the leakage of question papers. The government are losing {{a lot of money to}} replace the leaked <b>final</b> <b>examination</b> question papers. The confidentiality of the question papers must be strictly maintained. Thus, this project emphasize strongly on developing a desktop based application that can hide <b>final</b> <b>examination</b> question paper in a digital bitmap cover image by using Image Steganography technique intended for the use of lecturer during the preparation of <b>final</b> <b>examination</b> question paper. This project focus on the Least Significant Bit algorithm in Image Steganography while providing a practical understanding of what Steganography is and how to accomplish it. The significance of this project is to help prevent unauthorized access, use and modification of the question paper before the <b>final</b> <b>examination</b> being conducted. It can preserve and enhance the confidentiality of the <b>final</b> <b>examination</b> question paper and can save lecturer time and it is cost efficient.

40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} the visual results of vitrectomy for epiretinal membrane in {{eyes with a}} preoperative visual acuity of 20 / 50 or better. Methods: The visual results and complications were analyzed following vitrectomy for idiopathic epiretinal membranes and epiretinal membranes secondary to retinal tears. This study was a retrospective, consecutive case series of 40 eyes of 40 patients treated by a single surgeon. Results: The mean preoperative visual acuity was 20 / 50 + 2 (range, 20 / 30 + 1 to 20 / 50 – 3). The mean visual acuity improved to 20 / 40 + 2 (P =. 02) by the <b>final</b> <b>examination</b> at a mean of 2. 4 years following surgery. The status of the lens at the <b>final</b> <b>examination</b> was correlated with the visual results of surgery. Twenty-one eyes were phakic preoperatively, and 14 of these eyes had cataracts removed by the <b>final</b> <b>examination.</b> The mean preoperative visual acuity in seven eyes that were still phakic at the <b>final</b> <b>examination</b> was 20 / 50, and this decreased to 20 / 50 – 2 (P =. 82). The mean preoperative visual acuity was 20 / 50 + 2 in 33 eyes that were pseudophakic by the <b>final</b> <b>examination,</b> and this improved to 20 / 32 – 2 (P =. 005). The visual acuity improved by 2 or more Snellen lines in only one in seven eyes (14 %) that were still phakic on the <b>final</b> <b>examination</b> and in 14 of 33 eyes (42. 4 %) that were pseudophakic by the <b>final</b> <b>examination.</b> There were no serious surgical complications. Conclusions: Vitrectomy for epiretinal membranes is beneficial in eyes with relatively good preoperative visual acuities, but cataract surgery is necessary in phakic eyes to achieve long-term visual acuity improvement.
