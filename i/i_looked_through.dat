500|$|Chandler left a last {{statement}} with prison officials {{on a piece}} of paper, which was read aloud during a news conference after the execution. It said: [...] "You are killing a (sic) innocent man today." [...] Shortly after signing Chandler's death warrant Governor Rick Scott said: [...] " [...] killed three women, so <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>through</b> different cases, and it made sense to do that one. There's never one thing. It was the right case." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{regard to}} Renesmee's unique name, Meyer wrote that she [...] "couldn't call her Jennifer or Ashley. What do you name the most unique {{baby in the}} world? <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>through</b> a lot of baby name websites. Eventually I {{realized}} that there was no human name that was going to work for me, so I surrendered to necessity and made up my own." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "I {{was called}} by the police on Friday morning at eleven o'clock, and on {{proceeding}} to Miller's Court, which I entered at 11.15. [...] I found a room, the door of which led out of the passage {{at the side of}} 26, Dorset street, photographs of which I produce. It had two windows in the court. Two panes in the lesser window were broken, and as the door was locked <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>through</b> the lower of the broken panes and satisfied myself that the mutilated corpse lying on the bed was not in need of any immediate attention from me, and I also {{came to the conclusion that}} there was nobody else upon the bed, or within view, to whom I could render any professional assistance. Having ascertained that probably it was advisable that no entrance should be made into the room at that time, I remained until about 1.30p.m., when the door was broken open by McCarthy, under the direction of Superintendent Arnold.|$|E

When <b>I</b> <b>look</b> down <b>through</b> the earth {{by means of the}} Artesian ray I reach a certain depth and then I see a void; when <b>I</b> <b>look</b> down <b>through</b> a perfectly open passage to the same depth, I still see a void." ...|$|R

60|$|I {{persisted in}} {{entering}} the house, for all that. Aided by the pony, I easily solved {{the mystery of}} the housekeeper's otherwise unintelligible narrative.

6000|$|... "'You darned old snoozer,' he said, {{with the}} old-time {{look on his}} face, 'I saw you put it there. I watched you open the safe and take it out, and I {{followed}} you. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>through</b> {{the window and saw}} you hide it in that wardrobe.' ...|$|E

5000|$|Ryan {{said that}} his {{favorite}} creative moment in comics was sitting down with Gruenwald {{and coming up with}} the look for D.P. 7: [...] "At Mark’s direction we 'cast' our characters based on real people. This is something that I still do when confronted with new characters.

6000|$|Newman got up {{and walked}} away {{to the end of his}} long room. When he came back Mrs. Bread had got up, and stood by the fire with folded hands. [...] "Tell me this," [...] he said.

60|$|The {{sight of}} horror that met my eyes the instant <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>through</b> {{the hole is}} as present to my memory now as if I had beheld it yesterday. I can hardly write of it at this {{distance}} of time without a thrill of the old terror running through me again to the heart.|$|E
60|$|Before {{another word}} {{could be said}} by anybody, a thundering knock at the street door startled us all. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>through</b> the window, and saw the World, the Flesh, and the Devil waiting before the house--as typified in a {{carriage}} and horses, a powdered footman, {{and three of the}} most audaciously dressed women I ever beheld in my life.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>through</b> {{the gate}} {{and saw that it}} was indeed the general, who, having either seen us or been {{attracted}} by our voices, was hurrying down towards us. As he advanced he would stop from time to time and peer at us through the dark shadow thrown by the trees, as if he were irresolute whether to come on or no.|$|E
5000|$|As a {{literary}} critic, I have no [...] "method," [...] no specialty, but am what is called, in another discipline, a [...] "general practitioner" [...] [...] [...] <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>through</b> my repertory for {{the methods and}} the mixture of methods appropriate to the case before me—in consequence of which the proportion of stylistic analysis to biographical, or biographical to ideological, will be found to vary from essay to essay.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I suppose, Charley, you'll {{have to make}} {{an entry}} about that barge on Monday morning, won't you?' said Linda. 'Mind you put in it how {{beautiful}} <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> sailing <b>through</b> the arch.' ...|$|R

60|$|The person coming was Mary Jane. She {{went to the}} coffin, very soft, and kneeled {{down and}} looked in; then she put up her handkerchief, and I see she begun to cry, though I couldn't hear her, and her back was to me. I slid out, and as I passed the dining-room I thought I'd make sure them watchers hadn't seen me; so <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>through</b> the crack, and {{everything}} was all right. They hadn't stirred.|$|E
60|$|In {{an instant}} I put out my light and slipped behind the window-{{curtains}}. Next moment {{the door was}} flung open and two Spaniards strode into the room, fierce, swarthy men in the dress of citizens, but with muskets slung over their shoulders. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>through</b> the chink in the curtains in an agony of fear lest they had come upon my traces, but {{it was evident that}} their visit was simply in order to feast their eyes upon my unfortunate compatriot.|$|E
60|$|What that fool Rochez {{was doing}} I could not {{definitely}} ascertain. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>through</b> the vasistas of the coach, but {{could see nothing}} in pursuit of us. Then I turned my full attention to my lovely companion. It was pitch dark inside the carriage, you understand; only from time to time, as we drove past an overhanging street lanthorn, I {{caught a glimpse of}} that priceless bundle beside me, which lay there so still and so snug, still wrapped up in the shawl.|$|E
5000|$|Prime Minister Menachem Begin, {{who spent}} 45 minutes with the colonel before {{he asked to}} be {{relieved}} of his command, recalled today that the officer had told him: [...] "I am a brigade commander. <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>through</b> my binoculars and I see children."Mr. Begin said he asked the colonel, [...] "Did you get an order to kill those children?"

5000|$|It {{is little}} I repair to the matches of the Southron folk, Though my own red roses there may blow; It is little I repair to the matches of the Southron folk, Though the red roses crest the caps, I know. For {{the field is}} full of shades as I near a shadowy coast, And a ghostly batsman plays to the bowling of a ghost, And <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>through</b> my tears on a soundless-clapping host [...] As the run stealers flicker to and fro, To and fro: O my Hornby and my Barlow long ago! ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>through</b> {{and stood}} aghast, as well I might. The door was gone, {{and so were}} the outer gates of bronze -- entirely gone. They {{had been taken from}} their hinges, and as we {{afterwards}} found, hurled from the stairway to the ground two hundred feet beneath. There in front of us was the semicircular standing-space, about twice {{the size of a large}} oval dining-table, and the ten curved black marble steps leading on to the main stair -- and that was all.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nothing, lord, or {{at least}} very little. I moved some of the small rocks that we piled up, and crept down the hole till I came {{to a place where}} the blessed light of day fell upon me, only one little ray of it, but still the light of day. I think that {{something}} has fallen upon the tunnel and broken it, perhaps one of the outer walls of the palace. At least <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>through</b> a crack and saw everywhere ruins--ruins that still smoke. From among them I heard the voices of men shouting to each other.|$|E
60|$|In {{half an hour}} I {{had gained}} {{the edge of a}} low bank, well covered by coarse water-grass. Carefully pushing this aside, <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>through,</b> and almost held my breath, they were so near. Just below me, within six feet, was a big drake, with head drawn down so close to his body that I {{wondered}} what he had done with his neck. His eyes were closed; he was fast asleep. In front of him were eight or ten more ducks close together, all with heads under their wings. Scattered about in the grass everywhere were small groups, sleeping, or pluming their glossy dark feathers.|$|E
60|$|Having {{seen this}} rescue accomplished, I was letting my glass roam in the {{opposite}} direction, when one of its shakes brought into view something on my own side of the river. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> at it long, and saw it move slightly. Was it a human being? No, it was a dog. No, it was a dog and something else. I hurried out to see more clearly, and after a first glance the glass shook so in my hands that I had to rest it on the dike. For a full minute, I daresay, did <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>through</b> the glass without blinking, and then <b>I</b> needed to <b>look</b> no more, That black patch was, indeed, Gavin.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>looked</b> back <b>through</b> {{the days}} of my sojourn in the house; I {{questioned}} my own feelings and impressions, on the chance that they might serve me {{as a means of}} solving the mystery of her sudden flight from the room.|$|R
6000|$|... "See!" [...] he said. [...] "What I {{have found}} is nothing; even a camera shows nothing, and when <b>I</b> <b>look</b> down <b>through</b> the glass I see nothing. It {{is just what}} the Artesian ray showed me; it is nothing at all!" ...|$|R
