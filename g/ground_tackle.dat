50|$|Amended ruck {{definition}} - Law 16: A ruck commences when {{at least}} one player is on their feet and over the ball {{which is on the}} <b>ground</b> (<b>tackled</b> player, tackler). At this point the offside line is created. A player on his feet may use his hands to pick up the ball as long as this is immediate. As soon as an opposition player arrives no hands can be used.|$|R
5000|$|Tacklers are not {{required}} to wrap their arms around the ball carrier before bringing him to the ground; in fact, the ball carrier is often [...] "tackled" [...] by the defender taking a running start and hitting the ball carrier to knock them to the <b>ground.</b> <b>Tackles</b> can also be made by grabbing the ball carrier's jersey (or even hair, should it be long enough and allowed to dangle freely from beneath the helmet) and pulling him to the ground. As mentioned above, the referee can declare that a play is dead if the ball carrier's forward progress has been stopped, even if he has not actually been taken to the ground.|$|R

Grampus hull was constructed at Noank, Connecticut, by Robert Palmer & Sons, which launched her on 23 March 1886. Her sails, rigging, blocks, and <b>ground</b> <b>tackle</b> came from E. L. Rowe & Son, of Gloucester; her boats from Higgins & Gifford, of Gloucester; her steam windlass from the American Ship Windlass Company of Providence, Rhode Island; and the boiler for the windlass from M.

5000|$|In American football, tacklers are not {{required}} to wrap their arms around the ball carrier before bringing him to the ground; in fact, the ball carrier is often [...] "tackled" [...] by the defender taking a running start and hitting the ball carrier to knock him to the <b>ground.</b> <b>Tackles</b> can also be made by grabbing the ball carrier's jersey and pulling him to the ground (though pulling down a ball carrier from behind by the pads or jersey behind his neck is known as a [...] "horse collar", a move now illegal {{at all levels of the}} American game). If a ball carrier is stopped for more than a few seconds, the referee can blow the whistle, declare the player's forward progress stopped, and end the play even though the ball carrier is not actually <b>tackled</b> to the <b>ground.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{aim of the}} {{defending}} side is to stop the player with the ball, either by bringing them to <b>ground</b> (a <b>tackle,</b> which is frequently followed by a ruck), or by contesting for possession with the ball-carrier on their feet (a maul).

60|$|We had not, however, rid here so long, {{but should}} have tided {{it up the}} river, but that the wind blew too fresh; and after we had lain four or five days, blew very hard. However, the roads being {{reckoned}} {{as good as a}} harbour, the anchorage good, and our <b>ground</b> <b>tackle</b> very strong, our men were unconcerned, and not in the least apprehensive of danger, but spent the time in rest and mirth, after the manner of the sea; but the eighth day in the morning the wind increased, and we had all hands at work to strike our topmasts, and make every thing snug and close, that the ship might ride as easy as possible. By noon the sea went very high indeed, and our ship rid forecastle in, shipped several seas, and we thought once or twice our anchor had come home; upon which our master ordered out the sheet anchor; so that we rode with two anchors ahead, and the cables veered out to the better end.|$|E
40|$|This chapter {{deals with}} {{lightning}} electromagnetic field calculations in {{presence of a}} lossy <b>ground,</b> <b>tackling</b> {{the problem of the}} efficient and accurate numerical computation of the so-called Sommerfeld’s integrals appearing in the electromagnetic field expressions. From a mathematical standpoint, the Sommerfeld’s integrals are improper integrals (i. e. over a semi-infinite domain) of complex functions characterized by the presence of branch points. The coexistence in the integrand of highly oscillating Bessel functions and of integrable singularities are the main causes of numerical troubles and slow convergence. Here, a method is discussed to treat them without resorting to any kind of approximated formulas. The method is based on a proper subdivision of the integration domain and on the analytical determination of a suitable upper bound for the error due to the integral truncation. The developed analysis refers to the following main configurations: lightning event on 1) homogeneous lossy ground with constant conductivity and permittivity; 2) homogeneous lossy ground with frequency-dependent soil electrical parameters; 3) stratified lossy ground. In all the cases, the exact field expressions are derived starting from the Maxwell equations both in air and in the ground...|$|R

50|$|The {{idea of this}} {{technique}} is to prevent the attacking team gaining any <b>ground</b> by <b>tackling</b> them behind the gain line and forcing interceptions and charged down kicks. However, the defending team can be vulnerable to chip kicks and any player breaking the defensive line will have lots of space to play because the defence are running {{the other way and}} must stop, turn and chase. In many ways, the blitz is similar to the defence used in rugby league which can be explained by Edwards's background in that code.|$|R
60|$|Just {{as the sun}} set le Feu-Follet anchored. She {{had chosen}} a berth {{sufficiently}} within the shallow water to be safe from the guns of the frigate, though scarcely within the river. The latter {{the depth of the}} stream hardly permitted, though there was all the shelter that the season and weather required. The Proserpine manifested no intention to give up her pursuit; for she, too, came off the outlet and brought up with one of her bowers about two miles to seaward of the lugger. She seemed to have changed her mind as to the coasters, having let both proceed after a short detention, though, it falling calm, neither was enabled to get any material distance from her until the land-breeze should rise. In these positions the belligerents prepared to pass the night, each party taking the customary precautions as to his <b>ground</b> <b>tackle,</b> and each clearing up the decks and going through the common routine of duty as regularly as if he lay in a friendly port.|$|E
60|$|In like manner {{the ships}} which {{come from the}} north, leave the shore at Flamborough Head, and stretch away SSE. for Yarmouth Roads; and they first land they make is Wintertonness (as above). Now, {{the danger of the}} place is this: if the ships coming from the north are taken with a hard gale of wind from the SE., or from any point between NE. and SE., so that they cannot, as the seamen call it, weather Wintertonness, they are thereby kept within that deep bay; and if the wind blows hard, are often in danger of running on shore upon the rocks about Cromer, on the north coast of Norfolk, or {{stranding}} upon the flat shore between Cromer and Wells; all the relief they have, is good <b>ground</b> <b>tackle</b> to ride it out, which is very hard to do there, the sea coming very high upon them; or if they cannot ride it out then, to run {{into the bottom of the}} great bay I mentioned, to Lynn or Boston, which is a very difficult and desperate push: so that sometimes in this distress whole fleets have been lost here altogether.|$|E
