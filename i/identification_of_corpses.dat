30|$|While {{the whole}} foot has been {{evaluated}} for ergonomic shoe design (Wunderlich and Cavanagh 2001; Zeybek et al. 2008), {{it has also}} been evaluated for <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> <b>corpses,</b> foot and shoe sizes (Jasuja et al. 1991; Giles and Vallandigham 1991; Gordon and Buikstra 1992; Ozden et al. 2005), and for footprints and foot outline (Krishan 2007, 2008). Krishan and Sharma (2007), for instance, observed that foot length estimate living stature better than foot breadth in Rajputs of Himachal Pradesh, North India. From the foregoing, it appears the attention on foot morphology and anthropometry among forensic scientists is justified. However, the argument for utilizing percutaneous foot measurement presents a number of advantages. It is relatively easy to obtain data sets from live subjects from a variety of population groups, obviating the development of regression models for predictive regression analysis for such target populations (Kanchan et al. 2008).|$|E

This topic is one of issues which belong to criminal science. My work consists of eight chapters including the Introduction and Conclusion. In the beginning I described the basic terms of Forensic Science which relate to death as post-mortem changes, mummification and algor mortis. In the Chapter three I deal with a general procedure when a dead body occurs. In this part {{you can find the}} legal regulations of coroner's inquest, autopsy and search of premises. Next chapter is devoted to regulation of a medicine doctor's activity as an expert and following chapter describes exhumation procedure. Chapter six deals with identification process generally. Chapter seven describes particular methods of identification. The first method what I describe is forensic anthropology. This method use external features of a man for the identification process. These features are: sex, age, body height, DNA analysis or blood group. Then I define method of superprojection which use the skulk and photography of dead persons. With the technical progress this method use nowadays equipment of modern technique as special scanner or digital pictures. After that I define method of portrait [...] ...|$|E

40|$|Human {{remains and}} {{identification}} presents a pioneering {{investigation into the}} practices and methodologies used {{in the search for}} and exhumation of dead bodies resulting from mass violence. Previously absent from forensic debate, social scientists and historians here confront historical and contemporary exhumations with the application of social context to create an innovative and interdisciplinary dialogue. Never before has a single volume examined the context of motivations and interests behind these pursuits, each chapter enlightening the political, social and legal aspects of mass crime and its aftermaths. The book argues that the emergence of new technologies to facilitate the identification of dead bodies has led to a 'forensic turn', normalising exhumations as a method of dealing with human remains en masse. However, are these exhumations always made for legitimate reasons? And what can we learn about societies from {{the way in which they}} deal with this consequence of mass violence? Multidisciplinary in scope, this book presents a ground-breaking selection of international case studies, including the <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> <b>corpses</b> by the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, the resurfacing of human remains from the Gulag and the sites of Jewish massacres from the Holocaust. Human remains and identification will appeal to readers interested in understanding this crucial phase of mass violence's aftermath, such as researchers in history, anthropology, sociology, forensic science, law, politics and modern warfar...|$|E
40|$|After {{attending}} this presentation, attendees will: (1) {{understand how}} body height from computed tomography {{data can be}} estimated; and, (2) gain knowledge about the accuracy of estimated body height and limitations. The presentation will impact the forensic science community by providing knowledge and competence which will enable attendees to develop formulas for single bones to reconstruct body height using postmortem Computer Tomography (p-CT) data. The estimation of Body Height (BH) {{is an important component}} of the <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> <b>corpses</b> and skeletal remains. Stature can be estimated with relative accuracy via the measurement of long bones, such as the femora. Compared to time-consuming maceration procedures, p-CT allows fast and simple measurements of bones. This study undertook four objectives concerning the accuracy of BH estimation via p-CT: (1) accuracy between measurements on native bone and p-CT imaged bone (F 1 according to Martin 1914); (2) intra-observer p-CT measurement precision; (3) accuracy between formula-based estimation of the BH and conventional body length measurement during autopsy; and, (4) accuracy of different estimation formulas available. 1 In the first step, the accuracy of measurements in the CT compared to those obtained using an osteometric board was evaluated on the basis of eight defleshed femora. Then the femora of 83 female and 144 male corpses of a Swiss population for which p-CTs had been performed, were measured at the Institute of Forensic Medicine in Bern. After two months, 20 individuals were measured again in order to assess the intraobserver error. The mean age of the men was 53 ± 17 years and that of the women was 61 ± 20 years. Additionally, the body length of the corpses was measured conventionally. The mean body length was 176. 6 ± 7. 2 cm for men and 163. 6 ± 7. 8 cm for women. The images that were obtained using a six-slice CT were reconstructed with a slice thickness of 1. 25 mm. Analysis and measurements of CT images were performed on a multipurpose workstation. As a forensic standard procedure, stature was estimated by means of the regression equations by Penning & Riepert developed on a Southern German population and for comparison, also those referenced by Trotter & Gleser “American White. ” 2, 3 All statistical tests were performed with a statistical software. No significant differences were found between the CT and osteometric board measurements. The double p-CT measurement of 20 individuals resulted in an absolute intra-observer difference of 0. 4 ± 0. 3 mm. For both sexes, the correlation between the body length and the estimated BH using the F 1 measurements was highly significant. The correlation coefficient was slightly higher for women. The differences in accuracy of the different formulas were small. While the errors of BH estimation were generally ± 4. 5 – 5. 0 cm, the consideration of age led to an increase in accuracy of a few millimetres to about 1 cm. BH estimations according to Penning & Riepert and Trotter & Gleser were slightly more accurate when age-at-death was taken into account. 2, 3 That way, stature estimations in the group of individuals older than 60 years were improved by about 2. 4 cm and 3. 1 cm. 2, 3 The error of estimation is therefore about a third of the common ± 4. 7 cm error range. Femur measurements in p-CT allow very accurate BH estimations. Estimations according to Penning led to good results that (barely) come closer to the true value than the frequently used formulas by Trotter & Gleser “American White. ” 2, 3 Therefore, the formulas by Penning & Riepert are also validated for this substantial recent Swiss population...|$|E

With the savage aftermath the Russian Revolution still fresh in the minds of all concerned, the new German government ordered the immediate destruction of the left-wing uprising: the implementation of this instruction involved the killings by a Freikorps cavalry unit, on 15 January 1919, of both Luxemburg and Liebknecht. Luxemburg's body was thrown into a canal. Not quite five months later, early in June 1919, a body believed to be Rosa Luxemburg's was recovered.

Neither the kinetics of necrosis onset nor the total number <b>of</b> necrotic <b>corpses</b> generated is altered by any C. elegans mutation known to block PCD, which provides genetic evidence that the activating mechanisms for NCD and apoptotic cell death are distinct.

50|$|Schwarzkopf {{suspected}} gang involvement, as kidnapping was {{a common}} criminal enterprise during the Great Depression, and wanted to contact members of the underworld, but {{during the course of}} the investigation, John F. Condon, a 72-year-old retired Bronx school teacher, became an intermediary between Lindbergh and the kidnappers after he placed an ad in Home News, to which the kidnappers responded. Schwarzkopf wanted to place a trace on Condon's telephone, but Lindbergh overruled him, and setting up a trap would have been made difficult or impossible by Lindbergh's management of the case. Schwarzkopf reluctantly agreed to keep law enforcement away from the arranged ransom drop. Although the man Condon gave the ransom money to in Saint Raymond's Cemetery in the Bronx on April 2 gave Condon a note describing a boat where Charlie could be found, no such boat was found. When Charlie's skeletonized corpse was found by a truck driver on May 12, Schwarzkopf inspected the shallow grave, four miles from the Lindbergh home, whose lights were visible from the site. Following <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> the <b>corpse</b> as Charlie, and the determination from the level of decomposition that he was killed immediately after abduction, Schwarzkopf informed Charlie's nursemaid, Betty Gow, and Elizabeth Morrow, who then informed Charlie's mother, Anne Lindbergh. Charles Lindbergh's need for control over the case was now over, and by the time the case was months old, and trails had gone cold, Schwarzkopf was the target of widespread and recurring criticism. Following the suicide of Violet Sharpe, a maid for the Morrows who had been acting suspiciously before the incident and during its investigation, some, such as Violet's sister, Emily Sharpe, accused Schwarzkopf and Jersey City Police Department investigator Harry Walsh of harassing her to death with their rough interrogations, but experts such as Douglas have disputed this notion.|$|R
