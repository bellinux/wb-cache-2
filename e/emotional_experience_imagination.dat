40|$|Alexithymia is a {{psychological}} construct {{that can be}} divided into a cognitive and affective dimension. The cognitive dimension is characterized by difficulties in identifying, verbalizing and analysing feelings. The affective dimension comprises reduced levels of <b>emotional</b> <b>experience</b> and <b>imagination.</b> Alexithymia is widely regarded to arise from an impairment of emotion regulation. This is the first functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study to critically evaluate this by investigating the neural correlates of emotion regulation as a function of alexithymia levels. The aim of the current study was to investigate the neural correlates underlying the two alexithymia dimensions during emotion perception and emotion regulation. Using fMRI, we scanned 51 healthy subjects while viewing, reappraising or suppressing negative emotional pictures. The results support the idea that cognitive alexithymia, but not affective alexithymia, is associated with lower activation in emotional attention and recognition networks during emotion perception. However, in contrast with several theories, no alexithymia-related differences were found during emotion regulation (neither reappraisal nor suppression). These findings suggest that alexithymia may result from an early emotion processing deficit rather than compromised frontal circuits subserving higher-order emotion regulation processe...|$|R

40|$|Orientation: The {{positive}} organisational behaviour movement emphasises {{the advantages}} of psychological strengths in business. The psychological virtues of positive <b>emotional</b> <b>experiences</b> can potentially promote human strengths to {{the advantages of}} business functioning and the management of work conditions. This is supported by Fredrickson’s broaden-and-build theory that emphasises the broadening of reactive thought patterns through experiences of positive emotions. Research purpose: A preliminary psychometric evaluation of a positive measurement of dimensions of <b>emotional</b> <b>experiences</b> in the workplace, by rephrasing the Kiefer and Barclay Toxic <b>Emotional</b> <b>Experiences</b> Scale. Motivation for the study: This quantitative Exploratory Factor Analysis investigates the factorial structure and reliability of the Positive <b>Emotional</b> <b>Experiences</b> Scale, a positive rephrased version of the Toxic <b>Emotional</b> <b>Experiences</b> Scale. Research approach, design and method: This Exploratory Factor Analysis indicates an acceptable three-factor model for the Positive <b>Emotional</b> <b>Experiences</b> Scale. These three factors are: (1) psychological recurrent positive state, (2) social connectedness and (3) physical refreshed energy, with strong Cronbach’s alphas of 0. 91, 0. 91 and 0. 94, respectively. Main findings: The three-factor model of the Positive <b>Emotional</b> <b>Experiences</b> Scale provides a valid measure in support of Fredrickson’s theory of social, physical and psychological endured personal resources that build positive emotions. Practical/Managerial implications: Knowledge gained on positive versus negative <b>emotional</b> <b>experiences</b> could be applied by management to promote endured personal resources that strengthen positive <b>emotional</b> <b>experiences.</b> Contribution/value-add: The contribution of this rephrased Positive <b>Emotional</b> <b>Experiences</b> Scale provides a reliable measure of assessment of the social, physical and endured psychological and personal resources identified in Fredrickson’s broaden-and-build theory. Application of this Positive <b>Emotional</b> <b>Experiences</b> Scale as a diagnostic tool may allow businesses to work towards more positive <b>emotional</b> <b>experiences</b> in the workplace. </p...|$|R

40|$|Emotions play a {{significant}} role in people’s lives, including interactions with portable devices. The research aimed to understand the evolving <b>emotional</b> <b>experience</b> between people and portable interactive devices (PIDs). Activity Theory was the theoretical framework used to contextualise the research approach and findings. Two longitudinal experiments were conducted investigating <b>emotional</b> <b>experiences</b> with PIDs over six months. Experiment 1 focused on media / entertainment PIDs while Experiment 2 focused on medical / health PIDs. Mixed research methods consisting of diaries, interviews and codiscovery sessions were used to collect data. Results identified that more social interactions were experienced with media PIDs than medical PIDs. Different Task Categories, and their emotional responses, were also revealed including Features, Functional, Mediation and Auxiliary Categories. Functional and Mediation categories were characterised as overall positive while Features and Auxiliary Categories were characterised as overall negative. Further, the consequences of Negative Personal and Social interactions on the overall <b>emotional</b> <b>experience</b> were determined. For media PIDs, Negative Social experiences adversely impacted the evolving <b>emotional</b> <b>experience.</b> For medical PIDs, both Negative Social and Negative Personal experiences adversely impacted the evolving <b>emotional</b> <b>experience.</b> As a result of the findings the Designing for Evolving <b>Emotional</b> <b>Experience</b> framework was developed, outlining principles to promote positive, and avoid negative, <b>emotional</b> <b>experiences</b> with PIDs.

We collected weekly measurements among 103 first year university students over several months, resulting in 22 to 30 measurements for each individual. Every week, the students reported an important experience and accompanying positive and negative emotions, their level of educational exploration and commitment. We generated linear growth models for each individual separately, using Dynamic Linear Modeling. These individual models generate regression weights that indicate how strong the impact is of exploration, positive and negative <b>emotional</b> <b>experiences</b> on changes in micro-level commitment for each individual. Our main finding is that both positive and negative <b>emotional</b> <b>experiences</b> are indeed related to changes in educational commitment. Positive experiences, but surprisingly, also negative experiences, are related to increases in educational commitment for the majority of individuals. Moreover, for the large majority of individuals, the impact of <b>emotional</b> <b>experiences</b> is larger than the impact of exploration.

40|$|<b>Emotional</b> <b>experience</b> {{has long}} been ignored or marginalized by the {{philosophical}} tradition because of its irrational or unrationalizable character. Ethical formation, a developmental approach to moral philosophy developed by virtue theorist Sabina Lovibond and others, is a rationalizing approach to character formation which does not ignore or marginalize the affective area of human experience. But neither does it develop in significant detail a method to include <b>emotional</b> <b>experience</b> within its main aims. This thesis intends to eliminate this problem by showing how we can sensibly 'rationalize' our <b>emotional</b> <b>experience</b> without, as some more recent approaches have tended to do, over-rationalizing them. In order to do so, I will focus on Ronald de Sousa's account of emotional rationality and illustrate how his notion of 'paradigm scenarios' can help us to include the emotions within ethical formation. Paradigm scenarios enable us to develop emotional intentionality and, thereby, enable us to give our <b>emotional</b> <b>experiences</b> teleology [...] -the minimal elements necessary for any rationality. In order to best illustrate that <b>emotional</b> <b>experience</b> can helpfully be included within the rational project of ethical formation I go on (in chapters two and three) to show how these paradigm scenarios are acquired and applied. In the end, the thesis stresses that neither project (de Sousa's emotional rationality or Lovibond's ethical formation) is complete without supplementation from the other. My specific focus on the emotions requires situation within a wider perspective just as Lovibond's broad perspective requires a finer-grained focus in order to appropriately value <b>emotional</b> <b>experience...</b>|$|R
