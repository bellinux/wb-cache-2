Command and Control (C 2) by today's embarked commanders requires timely and reliable access to classified data systems at the C 2 node {{provided by the}} ship. Most often, the ship's spaces provided to an embarked staff are inadequate to support the commander's C 2 requirements. Often, {{there are not enough}} classified computers or classified Local Area Network (LAN) connections. To facilitate improved ability to exercise C 2, a ship's company technicians typically place a hub on the network to provide <b>extra</b> <b>connection</b> points. This procedure takes time for the technicians to implement and requires physical connection to the wired network. A potential alternative may be to leverage current IEEE 802. 11 technology to provide wireless connectivity for these clients, yet wireless technology alone will not address this problem.

40|$|Electrical {{interconnection}} networks {{connecting the}} different processors and memory modules in modern largescale multiprocessor machines are running into several physical limitations. In shared-memory machines, where {{the network is}} part of the memory hierarchy, high network latencies cause a significant performance bottleneck. Parallel optical interconnection technologies can alleviate this bottleneck by providing fast and high-bandwidth links. Moreover, new devices like tunable lasers and detectors or MEMS mirror arrays allow us to reconfigure the network at runtime in a data transparent way. This allows for <b>extra</b> <b>connections</b> between distant node pairs that communicate intensely, achieving a high virtual network connectivity by providing {{only a limited number of}} physical links at each moment in time.

It permits {{to take advantage of}} the path and node diversity in the network when the network coding nodes are placed efficiently. In this paper, we investigate networks consisting of nodes that autonomously determine whether they should perform network coding or not as well as their set of parent nodes. Each node makes its decisions that maximize its quality of service. The decisions include the selection of operation mode (i. e., network coding mode, simple data forwarding mode) and the selection of <b>extra</b> <b>connections.</b> The resulting interactions among the nodes are modeled as a congestion game, thereby ensuring an equilibrium, i. e., stable multimedia stream flow. The experimental results show that the proposed scheme is appropriate for distributed multimedia transmission since it provides a stable quality without imposing centralized control.

40|$|Although a {{large number}} of users are using P 2 P systems, the ability of these systems to provide {{services}} with quality is questioned. A load balanced P 2 P system can provide services with smaller failure rate and better performance; hence, service quality of the system can be improved. Cluster systems have been adopted for services which are tolerant to faults. Although a cluster structure could be adopted for improving the reliability and robustness of a P 2 P system, the load unbalancing problem still remains because of the heterogeneities of nodes and requests. Existing dynamic load balancing mechanisms in P 2 P systems require <b>extra</b> <b>connections</b> and overhead on aggregating the load status from the nodes. We propose diffusive load balancing in a clustered P 2 P systems, where a global balance is achieved through balancing the neighbourhoods of all clusters within the existing overlay network. We simulated three load balancing schemes: directory-initiated, sender-initiated, and receiver-initiated; from an initially unbalanced situation, the results show that diffusive load balancing can achieve a global balance comparable to a centralized directory scheme, and the distributed directory-initiated scheme provides better results than the sender- or receiver-initiated schemes. 1...|$|R
40|$|In an ATM network, {{estimating}} cell {{loss probability}} {{is a crucial}} factor in congestion control and traffic management. This thesis proposes a method to estimate the cell loss probability in an ATM multiplexer with heterogeneous traffic sources. We consider an ATM Multiplexer with a finite buffer of size K (cells) and a single link with capacity C (cells/second). Unlike previous work, we approximate the heterogeneous arrival process using a Markov Modulated Deterministic Process (MMDP). We model the ATM multiplexer as MMDP/D/ 1 /K queueing system, then we derive the cell loss probability formula for an ATM multiplexer, and we provide an algorithm to compute it. We consider several classes of traffic sources: voice, low-speed data, high-speed data and image-retrieval. Then, we compute the cell loss probability based on the analysis derived. By simulating the same network, we calculate the cell loss probability. Comparing the analysis and simulation figures proves the accuracy of our results. After examining these results, we observe that a dominant class {{is present in the}} heterogeneous ATM network, and it significantly affects the cell loss probability when <b>extra</b> <b>connections</b> are accepted from this class. Moreover, we demonstrate that our model performs consistently well for large buffer sizes where the burst level congestion is dominant. Therefore, this model is suitable for use in preventing burst level congestion from ATM heterogeneous networks...|$|R
40|$|Multiway {{switching}} {{has become}} nowadays quite frequently used in build-ing wiring. It {{can be defined}} as an interconnection of two or more electricalswitches in order to control an electrical load from more than one location. Although the electrical load is often a lamp, electrical outlets, fans, pumps,heaters or other appliances, it can also be controlled by multiway switching. However, in this paper we will deal only with lighting systems. Special switches are required to implement the system (three-way andfour-way switches) that have additional contacts, and extra wires must berun between them. In this way the light can be controlled from differentspots, e. g. {{the top and bottom of}} stairs or the end of a long hallway. Externally there is a resemblance between these switches and the standardsingle-pole ones. <b>Extra</b> <b>connections</b> make possible the control of a circuit frommultiple locations.

40|$|In this work, a {{prediction}} {{of the effects}} of introducing energy storage systems on the network stability of the distribution network of Cyprus and a comparison in terms of cost with a traditional solution is carried out. In particular, for solving possible overvoltage problems, several scenarios of storage units' installation are used and compared with the alternative solution of <b>extra</b> cable <b>connection</b> between the node with the lowest voltage and the node with the highest voltage of the distribution network. For the comparison, a case study of a typical LV distribution feeder in the power system of Cyprus is used. The results indicated that the performance indicator of each solution depends on the type, the size and the position of installation of the storage unit. Also, as more storage units are installed the better the performance indicator and the more attractive is the investment in storage units to solve power quality problems in the distribution network. In the case where the technical requirements in voltage limitations according to distribution regulations are satisfied with one storage unit, the installation of an additional storage unit will only increase the final cost. The best solution, however, still remains the alternative solution of <b>extra</b> cable <b>connection</b> between the node with the lowest voltage and the node with the highest voltage of the distribution network, due to the lower investment costs compared to that of the storage units...|$|R
