5|$|Chapter 10 states {{meditation}} practice perfects one's {{ability to}} concentrate, wherein the object one concentrates on becomes {{the one of}} attachment, of oneness and one feels one's identity with it. Verses 10.6–15 suggest that one must concentrate on self as the supreme self, oneness with Brahman in <b>everything,</b> <b>and</b> this process of attachment of one's individual self to the supreme self leads to oneness and liberation.|$|E
5|$|Gelsomina's {{difficulties}} with her forced partnership {{are the subject}} of frequent soul searching. Before Zampanò's release from prison, Il Matto proposes that there are alternatives to Gelsomina's servitude, and imparts his philosophy that <b>everything</b> <b>and</b> everyone has a purpose – even a pebble, even her. A nun suggests that Gelsomina's purpose in life is comparable to her own. But, when Gelsomina offers Zampanò marriage, he brushes her off.|$|E
5|$|In {{his pursuit}} of a {{unification}} of the fundamental forces, Einstein ignored some mainstream developments in physics, most notably the strong and weak nuclear forces, which were not well understood until many years after his death. Mainstream physics, in turn, largely ignored Einstein's approaches to unification. Einstein's dream of unifying other laws of physics with gravity motivates modern quests for a theory of <b>everything</b> <b>and</b> in particular string theory, where geometrical fields emerge in a unified quantum-mechanical setting.|$|E

5|$|The {{other three}} songs on Desolate North one was {{recorded}} {{at the same}} place in early 2005, and the other two, the harp pieces, were recorded at Anderson's home. He has said how this was {{the most difficult part of}} the recording. As it happened, Anderson misplaced his microphone stand and so recorded those two songs with the microphone tucked under his chin. Despite the hindrance, Anderson claimed that the microphone picked up <b>everything,</b> <b>and</b> he was happy with the result.|$|E
5|$|Dan {{starts a}} {{relationship}} with Shirley Benson (Robyn Moore), telling her that his wife, Pushpa, is dead. He takes her to a wedding as his guest, but Pushpa arrives, introducing herself and exposing Dan's lie. Shirley then breaks up with him. The Ferreiras help Shirley {{to deal with her}} neighbour from hell, Gavin Sharp (Steve Nicolson), which leads to Shirley and Ash becoming close and starting a secret relationship. Shirley is unhappy that Ash refuses to tell anyone about their relationship, as he knows his father will be furious if he discovers them together. Ash reveals to Shirley that he is a compulsive gambler and he lost his house and ruined his marriage in the process; Dan had bailed him out. He says he owes his father <b>everything</b> <b>and</b> he is not willing to hurt him. Dan attempts to woo Shirley again, forcing her to confess her relationship with Ash. This causes friction between the Ferreiras, and Ash breaks up with Shirley to keep the peace.|$|E
5|$|Flanagan {{observes that}} in Tenebrae, Argento offers two {{characters}} {{who suffer from}} impaired vision. Gianni (Christian Borromeo) is an eyewitness to an axe-murder, but the trauma of seeing the killing causes him to disregard a vital clue. Returning {{to the scene of}} the crime, he suddenly remembers <b>everything,</b> <b>and</b> is murdered before being able to tell anyone. Homicide detective Giermani reveals that he is a big fan of the novels of Agatha Christie, Mickey Spillane, Rex Stout, and Ed McBain, but admits that he has never been able to guess the identity of the killer in any of the books. He is similarly unable to solve the real mystery until the last corpses are piled at his feet – he cannot see Peter Neal for what he really is.|$|E

5|$|I don't see {{the point}} of playing in a band and going just one way when you can do everything. It would be {{impossible}} for us to play just death metal; that is our roots, but we are now a mishmash of <b>everything,</b> <b>and</b> not purists to any form of music. It's impossible for us to do that, and quite frankly I would think of it as boring to be in a band that plays just metal music. We're not afraid to experiment, or to be caught with our pants down, so to speak. That's what keeps us going.|$|E
5|$|Jonny Santos, who is {{best known}} as the vocalist and {{songwriter}} for the Grammy Award nominated industrial metal group Spineshank was displeased with the direction the band was going in and felt it had 'run its course'. Santos felt {{it was time to move}} on and left Spineshank, although he was unsure what direction he wanted with his music career. He would play with local bands and friends, while performing production and engineering duties in studios to 'pay the bills'. However, after leaving Spineshank, Santos lost <b>everything</b> <b>and</b> was basically homeless, 'couch surfing' from friend’s house to friend’s house.|$|E

5|$|McKellar {{was also}} {{considered}} a capable leader in combat. Aggressive and instinctive, his fighting spirit was {{an inspiration to}} his squadron but according to one biographer, he was highly strung, vociferous and blunt with members of his unit. Nevertheless, his directness and socially confident nature singled him out for command. His dedication to {{his job as a}} fighter pilot and leader led him to refuse any leave from his Squadron while the Battle of Britain lasted. Invariably McKellar led from the front of his unit. He spent a large proportion of his time with his squadron practising combat tactics. While intensely loyal to anyone he considered a friend, McKellar's attitude to others outside the squadron was either of utmost friendliness or utter dislike. He is said to have tended to see <b>everything</b> <b>and</b> everyone in black and white.|$|E
5|$|On New Year's Eve, Lydia discovers Zoe's true {{reasons for}} befriending her {{and decides to}} murder her at Sarah's grave, before taking her own life. Zoe and Lydia meet in a church to admit their 'relationship' to Sarah. However, Zoe flees and is knocked unconscious. When she wakes up, she finally gets a {{confession}} from Lydia, who admits why she cut the parachute. Zoe attacks Lydia before leaving. At Sarah's grave, Lydia stabs Zoe, as Charlotte, Mike and Dave arrive to stop her. As Zoe is taken away in an ambulance, Lydia is arrested. Lydia is questioned by D.I. Fletcher (Laura Fletcher) as Zoe recovers in hospital. Lydia admits <b>everything</b> <b>and</b> she is then charged {{for the murder of}} Sarah and attempted murder of Zoe. She is later given a lifetime prison sentence.|$|E
5|$|Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak) {{plans to}} go to his first sales call with Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson). Dwight surprises Ryan by taking him to Dwight's beet farm to both teach and haze. When Ryan, a member of a {{fraternity}} in college, accuses him of trying to haze him into acceptance, Dwight snaps at him, saying the reason Ryan has yet to make a sale is because he thinks he knows <b>everything,</b> <b>and</b> must think otherwise to sell. After Dwight tries to force Ryan to wrestle his cousin Mose (Michael Schur), Ryan gets angry and walks out. Dwight apologizes to Ryan and begins to give Ryan serious sales advice as Ryan takes notes. The two then go on a sales call which ultimately doesn't work out for Ryan. Irritated, Ryan throws eggs at the building housing the company that refused his sale. Dwight and Ryan then go to a bar and return to the office, where it appears they formed a new bond.|$|E

He learns that the man in the picture was extremely wealthy and lucky for a short period, before he died with a giant oversized penis. Mulder believes the woman in the picture is responsible for <b>everything,</b> <b>and</b> determines she is a jinniyah, or a female jinn. Mulder goes to the Stokes residence and asks Leslie to hand her over, presuming her to be kept in a box. It turns out, however, that she is not in the box, but back in the storage facility, where Mulder also finds pictures of the jinniyah next to Benito Mussolini in the 1930s and next to Richard Nixon in the 1960s, two men that had a lot of power and lost it in a bad way.|$|E
5|$|Several other book {{collections}} {{were lost}} as well. Professor Mathias Anchersen {{made the mistake}} of bringing his possessions to safety in Trinitatis Church. Árni Magnússon lost all his books, notes and records, but did manage to rescue his valuable collection of handwritten Icelandic manuscripts. At Borchs Kollegium 3,150volumes burned along with its Museum Rarirorum containing collections of zoological and botanical oddities. The burned out observatory in Rundetårn had contained instruments and records by Tycho Brahe and Ole Rømer. The professors Horrebow, Steenbuch and the two Bartholins lost practically <b>everything.</b> <b>And</b> {{on top of all that}} a large part of the city archive of records burnt along with city hall.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the first}} episodes of Carnivàle, Ben's {{parentage}} {{is one of}} the big puzzles. As a man named Henry Scudder seems connected to <b>everything</b> <b>and</b> everyone, it is Ben's job to piece together the mystery of his own past. The progressing series indicates many characters are more closely interrelated than what both the characters and the audience would imagine at first. Although these links rarely receive plot attention, the immediate genealogy of the main characters is cleared up {{by the end of the}} second season. Other character links that were largely unanswered after Carnivàles cancellation concern the trench war and the Hyde&Teller Company in relation to the emergence of the Carnivàle. Show creator Daniel Knauf, character biographies on the HBO website and the Pitch Document later provided detail for what was originally envisioned. Although the nature of these sources does not qualify them for canon status, they provide a framework for hints dropped in the series.|$|E

5|$|The Celestial Masters {{believed}} that qi pervaded <b>everything,</b> <b>and</b> {{in order to}} achieve immortality, the correct balance of qi had to be present within the body. Having a poor quantity of qi in the body, would result in illness, and eventually death. Meditation could be used to restore qi to the body, but sex was to be avoided, as it could result in the loss of qi. If there was the correct balance of qi within the body upon death, an adherent could 'feign death' and be reborn. If not, an adherent would be transported to an earthly prison where he would face eternal torment.|$|E

The mummy takes immediate interest in Jack, but is rejected and mummifies him. Before Professor Dix can cut up the now-mummified Jack, she returns and saves him. Jack explains <b>everything</b> <b>and</b> the film concludes with Professor Dix marrying the mummy.|$|E
