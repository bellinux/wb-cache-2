25|$|Google Maps {{began as}} a C++ desktop program {{designed}} by Lars and Jens Eilstrup Rasmussen at Where 2 Technologies. In October 2004, the company was acquired by Google, which converted it into a web application. After additional acquisitions of a <b>geospatial</b> <b>data</b> visualization company and a realtime traffic analyzer, Google Maps was launched in February 2005. The service's front end utilizes JavaScript, XML, and Ajax. Google Maps offers an API that allows maps to be embedded on third-party websites, and offers a locator for urban businesses and other organizations in numerous countries around the world. Google Map Maker allowed users to collaboratively expand and update the service's mapping worldwide but was discontinued from March, 2017. However crowdsourced contributions to Google Maps are not ending as the company announced those features will be transferred to Google's Local Guides programme.|$|E

In 2011, the garden was named one of Oregon's Most Endangered Places by the Historic Preservation League of Oregon (now known as Restore Oregon). The [...] "Endangered Places" [...] program raises awareness of the state's [...] "historic treasures in need of the advocacy and support to save them from demise". According to the League, the deteriorating garden needed [...] "maintenance, a business plan and a publicity campaign to ensure stewardship and funds are available to overcome vandalism, theft, and condition issues". In 2012, a contractor accidentally damaged one of the stone bridges, catalyzing an effort to document the garden using laser scanning and other technologies. The Portland-based company i-Ten measured and archived the site's <b>geospatial</b> <b>data,</b> allowing potential future rebuilding to match the original construction.|$|E

2500|$|In the {{literature}} of environmental determinism, the tsetse {{has been linked to}} difficulties during early state formation for areas where the fly is prevalent. A 2012 study used population growth models, physiological data, and ethnographic data to examine pre-colonial agricultural practices and isolate the effects of the fly. A [...] "tsetse suitability index" [...] was developed from insect population growth, climate and <b>geospatial</b> <b>data</b> to simulate the fly's population steady state. Results suggest that the tsetse decimated livestock populations, forcing early states to rely on slave labor to clear land for farming, and preventing farmers from taking advantage of natural animal fertilizers to increase crop production. These long-term effects may have kept population density low and discouraged cooperation between small-scale communities, thus preventing stronger nations from forming.|$|E

[...] Trail Crews known as Advanced Teams are the first Conservation staffers to begin hiking and clearing the trails, one month prior to the first participants' arrival. [...] Conservationists live in staff camps and lead conservation projects for treks passing through their camp. The GIS staff map trails, campsites, and other features of the Philmont Backcountry.

[...] ArcCatalog is the data management application, used to browse datasets and files on one's computer, database, or other sources. [...] In addition to showing what data is available, ArcCatalog also {{allows users to}} preview the data on a map. [...] ArcCatalog also provides the ability to view and manage metadata for spatial datasets. [...] ArcMap is the application used to view, edit and query <b>geospatial</b> <b>data,</b> and create maps. [...] The ArcMap interface has two main sections, including a table of contents {{on the left and}} the data frame(s) which display the map. [...] Items in the table of contents correspond with layers on the map. [...] ArcToolbox contains geoprocessing, data conversion, and analysis tools, along with much of the functionality in ArcInfo. [...] It is also possible to use batch processing with ArcToolbox, for frequently repeated tasks. ArcScene is an application which allows the user to view their GIS data in 3-D and is available with the 3D Analyst License. [...] In the layer properties of ArcScene there is an Extrusion function which allows the user to exaggerate features three dimension-ally. ArcGlobe is another one of ArcGIS's 3D visualization applications available with the 3D Analyst License. ArcGlobe is a 3D visualization application that allows you to view large amounts of GIS data on a globe surface. [...] The ArcGIS Pro application was added to ArcGIS for Desktop in 2015. It had the combined capabilities of the other integrated applications and was built as a fully 64-bit software application.|$|E

40|$|Declustering {{techniques}} {{are widely used}} in distributed environments to reduce query response time through parallel I/O by splitting large files into several small blocks and then distributing those blocks among multiple storage nodes. Unfortunately, however, many small <b>geospatial</b> image <b>data</b> files cannot be further split for distributed storage. In this paper, we propose a complete theoretical system for the distributed storage of small <b>geospatial</b> image <b>data</b> files based on mining the access patterns of <b>geospatial</b> image <b>data</b> using their historical access log information. First, an algorithm is developed to construct an access correlation matrix based on {{the analysis of the}} log information, which reveals the patterns of access to the <b>geospatial</b> image <b>data.</b> Then, a practical heuristic algorithm is developed to determine a reasonable solution based on the access correlation matrix. Finally, a number of comparative experiments are presented, demonstrating that our algorithm displays a higher total parallel access probability than those of other algorithms by approximately 10 - 15 % and that the performance can be further improved by more than 20 % by simultaneously applying a copy storage strategy. These experiments show that the algorithm can be applied in distributed environments to help realize parallel I/O and thereby improve system performance...|$|R

Because of the size of the data and the speed at which it is generated, computing such aggregates over <b>geospatial</b> image <b>data</b> is extremely demanding. Due to the special characteristics of the data, existing spatio-temporal aggregation models and evaluation approaches are not suitable for computing aggregates over such data. In this thesis, we analyze the characteristics of streaming <b>geospatial</b> image <b>data</b> and outline the key challenges of spatio-temporal aggregate computations.
