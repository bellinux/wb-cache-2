5000|$|Apart {{from the}} 1948 Arab-Israeli War, when {{manpower}} shortages saw many Palmach and IDF women taking {{active part in}} land battles, women were historically barred from battle in the IDF, serving {{in a variety of}} technical and administrative support roles. Soon after the establishment of the IDF, the removal of all women from front-line positions was decreed. Decisive for this decision was the very real possibility of falling into enemy hands as prisoners of war. It was fair and equitable to demand from women equal sacrifice and risk, it was argued, but the risk for women prisoners of rape and sexual molestation was infinitely greater than the same risk for men. A majority of women serving in the IDF then were secretaries. The rest served primarily as instructors, nurses, clerks and telephone operators. A few women flew transport missions in the 1950s and a few women were accepted into flight training in the 1970s, but did not complete the program before it was closed to women.Yael Rom, the first female pilot trained by the Israeli Air Force, earned her wings in 1951.Hava Inbar, a lawyer, was appointed the judge of the military court in Haifa in September 1969, thus becoming the first female military judge in the world.
