5|$|A film {{adaptation}} of Dreamgirls, starring Jamie Foxx, Beyoncé, Eddie Murphy, and Jennifer Hudson, {{was released by}} DreamWorks and Paramount Pictures in December 2006. The film contains more overt references to Motown and the Supremes than does the play that inspired it: for example, in the film, many of the Dreams' album covers are <b>identical</b> <b>in</b> design to Supremes album covers, and the Dreams themselves hail from Detroit – not Chicago, as do their Broadway counterparts.|$|E
5|$|Although {{similar in}} size the bridge towers are not <b>identical</b> <b>in</b> design, the Clifton tower having side {{cut-outs}} whilst the Leigh tower has more pointed arches and chamfered edges. Brunel's original plan proposed they be topped with then-fashionable sphinxes, but the ornaments were never constructed.|$|E
5|$|As {{the lead}} ship of the Majestic-class of light {{aircraft}} carriers, Melbourne was {{conceived as a}} modified version of the Colossus-class carrier, incorporating improvements in flight deck design and habitability. Majestic- and Colossus-class carriers were almost <b>identical</b> <b>in</b> hull design and both were considered subclasses of the '1942 design' light aircraft carrier program. These carriers were intended as 'disposable warships': to be disposed of at the end of World War II or within three years of entering service.|$|E

5|$|Gene flow {{involves}} {{the exchange of}} genes between populations and between species. The {{presence or absence of}} gene flow fundamentally changes the course of evolution. Due to the complexity of organisms, any two completely isolated populations will eventually evolve genetic incompatibilities through neutral processes, as in the Bateson-Dobzhansky-Muller model, even if both populations remain essentially <b>identical</b> <b>in</b> terms of their adaptation to the environment.|$|E
5|$|In both corpora {{there were}} many more monosyllables/single glyphs in running text than in the lexicon. That is, in both a {{relatively}} small number of such forms are very frequent, suggesting that rongorongo is compatible with Rapanui, which has a small number of very frequent monosyllabic grammatical particles. Rongorongo and Rapanui are also almost <b>identical</b> <b>in</b> the proportion of syllables/glyphs found in isolation and in initial, medial, and final position within a word/ligature.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after its}} release, Waddingtons, UK {{publishers}} of the Monopoly boardgame, raised {{objections to the}} Automonopoli title, saying {{that there was a}} risk purchasers would confuse the two products. Automata changed the name of the product to Go to Jail in their packaging and advertising, claiming in their advertising that despite being <b>identical</b> <b>in</b> every way, Go to Jail was unrelated to Automonopoli.|$|E

The X chromosome is submetacentric (with one arm slightly longer than the other) and the Y chromosome is small and acrocentric (with one very short and one long arm). The karyotype is conserved among species of Miniopterus; the number of chromosomes and arms is <b>identical</b> <b>in</b> M.griveaudi, the Malagasy M.aelleni and M.gleni, and even the Asian M.fuliginosus.|$|E

In the second stage, the group seeks to free itself from its dependence on the leader and groups have conflicts about goals and procedures (<b>identical</b> to 'Storming' <b>in</b> Tuckman's model). In the third stage, the group manages {{to work through the}} conflicts (<b>identical</b> to 'Norming' <b>in</b> Tuckman's model). And in the last stage, groups focus on team productivity (<b>identical</b> to 'Performing' <b>in</b> Tuckman's model).|$|R
5|$|Variation {{comes from}} {{mutations}} in the genome, reshuffling of genes through sexual reproduction and migration between populations (gene flow). Despite the constant {{introduction of new}} variation through mutation and gene flow, most of the genome of a species is <b>identical</b> <b>in</b> all individuals of that species. However, even relatively small differences in genotype can lead to dramatic differences in phenotype: for example, chimpanzees and humans differ in only about 5% of their genomes.|$|E

The Gatehouse, which was built in 1929 and had served as the headmaster's residence, was remodeled to house the early childhood program in 1988.|$|E

5|$|Armillaria calvescens {{is rather}} similar in appearance, {{and can only}} be {{reliably}} distinguished from A.gallica by observing microscopic characteristics. A.calvescens has a more northern distribution, and in North America, is rarely found south of the Great Lakes. A.mellea has a thinner stem than A.gallica, but can be more definitively distinguished {{by the absence of}} clamps {{at the base of the}} basidia. Similarly, A.cepistipes and A.gallica are virtually <b>identical</b> <b>in</b> appearance (especially older fruit bodies), and are identified by differences in geographical distribution, host range, and microscopic characteristics. Molecular methods have been developed to discriminate between the two species by comparing DNA sequences in the gene coding translation elongation factor 1-alpha.|$|E
5|$|Because Sitta przewalskii {{has long}} been {{regarded}} as a subspecies of the white-cheeked nuthatch, its description has often been made in comparison with it. Though both species lack the black eyestripe typical of other nuthatches, their coloring is distinct, with S. leucopsis being white- or creamy-buff on its throat, cheeks, breast, flanks and belly, where S. przewalskii has varying shades and concentrations of cinnamon. S. przewalskii is also the smaller of the two, and its bill is markedly thinner. Males and females of the species are nearly <b>identical</b> <b>in</b> appearance, except for the male's brighter cinnamon coloring.|$|E
5|$|Each {{heavy chain}} has two regions, the {{constant}} {{region and the}} variable region. The constant region is <b>identical</b> <b>in</b> all antibodies of the same isotype, but differs in antibodies of different isotypes. Heavy chains γ, α and δ have a constant region composed of three tandem (in a line) Ig domains, and a hinge region for added flexibility; heavy chains μ and ε have a constant region composed of four immunoglobulin domains. The variable region of the heavy chain differs in antibodies produced by different B cells, but {{is the same for}} all antibodies produced by a single B cell or B cell clone. The variable region of each heavy chain is approximately 110 amino acids long and is composed of a single Ig domain.|$|E
