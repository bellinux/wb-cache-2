A ratio scale possesses a meaningful (unique and non-arbitrary) zero value. Most measurement in the physical sciences and engineering is done on ratio scales. Examples include mass, length, duration, plane angle, energy and electric charge. In contrast to interval scales, ratios are now meaningful because having a non-arbitrary zero point makes it meaningful to say, for example, that one object has [...] "twice the length" [...] of another (= is [...] "twice as long"). Very informally, many ratio scales can be described as specifying [...] "how much" [...] of something (i.e. an amount or magnitude) or [...] "how many" [...] (a count).

They are therefore much better characterized by fluctuating efficiencies. In this study, using the fluctuation theorem, we identify universal features of efficiency fluctuations. While the standard thermodynamic efficiency is, as expected, the most likely value, we find that the Carnot efficiency is, surprisingly, the least likely in the long time limit. Furthermore the probability distribution for the efficiency assumes a universal scaling form when operating close-to-equilibrium.
