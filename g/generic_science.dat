40|$|Over {{the last}} decade, {{the amount of}} {{attention}} given to quantum physics in physics education research has increased significantly. The main {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the role of multiple representations-based instructions for pre-service physics students toward the students’ quantum physics mastery, <b>generic</b> <b>science</b> skills, and critical thinking disposition. Moreover, it was aimed to find out students’ representations preferences, pre-conceptions about quantum physics, use of multiple representations in quantum physics concepts situations and the reasons of preferring certain modes of representations in solving physics problem. The mixed method study was conducted on 37 pre-service physics students of the Mathematics and Science Education Department, at a public University in Lampung Province in the 2009 - 2010 academic year, who were encouraged to join in this investigation, lasting twelve weeks. For assessing students’ quantum physics performance, two instruments have been developed, called Quantum Physics Survey (QPS) and Re-representation Skills Inventory (RSI). QPS was used to measure students’ quantum physics concept mastery achievement, <b>generic</b> <b>science</b> skills, and critical thinking disposition, whereas RSI was used to assess students’ re-representation ability. Furthermore, as qualitative data, a question list was prepared at the beginning of the research using Focus Group Discussion from experimental and control groups and semi-structured interviews were carried out with the six students from the experimental group. The quantitative data analyses were conducted by using Mann-Whitney U statistics analyses. The results revealed that multiple representations based-instructions had a significant effect toward pre-service physics students’ quantum physics concept mastery of the Photoelectric Effect, Bohr’s Atom Model and Schrodinger’s Equation. This result showed that multiple representation-based instructions was better than the conventional instructions. There were significant differences on students’ <b>Generic</b> <b>Science</b> Skills in indirect observation, sense of scale, symbolic language, logical self-consistency, and mathematical modeling, while there were no significant differences in logical inference and concepts formation. Furthermore, there were significant differences on students’ critical thinking disposition in open mindedness, analyticity, systematicity, self confidence, and maturity of judgment, while contrarily there were no significant differences in truth-seeking and inquisitiveness. There were significant differences in student’s re-representation skills between experimental and control classes after the treatment. The results of the Focus Group Discussion indicated that, before treatment, students’ representation was strongly dependent on teacher/lecturer’s representation; students were more willing to use existing representation from a domain resource than to generate their own representation; most of students were more willing to use mathematical representations in learning and physics problem solving; students’ preconception in quantum physics is strongly influenced by classical physics conceptions; students’ misconceptions in quantum physics concepts have been identified.

40|$|A {{frequent}} task {{within an}} empirical science is {{to search for}} patterns within the phenomena studied by that sci-ence. This paper describes a general and systematic method (PENCHANT) for finding subtle or complex patterned behavior in empirical data. We have ar-gued that the discovery of spatio-temporal patterns is a <b>generic</b> task in <b>science,</b> {{in the sense that}} it arises in multiple sciences, and in the sense that analogous or even identical approaches are appropriate across the sciences. We have applied PENCHANT to data from real experiments in biology, psychology, and as-tronomy. To date, these applications have mostly re-sulted in known patterns, but further applications in the search for novel discoveries are ongoing...|$|R

Some unified models integrating data storage, data management and data analysis do exist, for example the NESSTAR, IPUMS and LIS projects. However all of these services are focused on {{a limited number of}} data resources and functionalities. The Cyberinfrastructure could be exploited to develop and support a more generic workflow environment. In this paper, we build upon earlier work in providing a specialist data access service to social scientists (the GEODE project), to outline a proposed framework for a <b>generic</b> quantitative social <b>science</b> infrastructural service based on open standards...|$|R

We introduce the Julia programming language and its design [...] -a dance between specialization and abstraction. Specialization allows for custom treatment. Multiple dispatch, a technique from computer science, picks the right algorithm for the right circumstance. Abstraction, which is what good computation is really about, recognizes what remains the same after differences are stripped away. Abstractions in mathematics are captured as code through another technique from computer <b>science,</b> <b>generic</b> programming. Julia shows that one can achieve machine performance without sacrificing human convenience. National Science Foundation (U. S.) (CCF- 0832997) National Science Foundation (U. S.)
