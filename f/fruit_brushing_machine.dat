40|$|Servo {{control of}} motors has {{important}} applications m {{such areas as}} robotics, numerically controlled machines and 2 Ì† 7 fly by wire* aircraft systems. The development of high power high coercivity magnetic alloys, such as samarium cobalt, {{has led to the}} advent of the brushless dc machine, which offers a more advantageous alternative to the <b>brush</b> <b>machine.</b> The brushless DC machine eliminates the need for brush contacts, through the use of electronic commutation. It has better thermal characteristics, as the rotor does not carry any current, and the rotor moment of inertia tends to be smaller than an equivalent <b>brush</b> <b>machine.</b> To achieve servo performance with a brushless dc machine requires the control of the motors torque angle. This thesis proposes digital control schemes for torque angle control, presents a simulation of the motor system with the schemes implemented, and concludes that digital schemes are more advantageous than analog control schemes, in the context of torque angle control of a brushless DC system...|$|R

50|$|Electromagnetic-rotor {{machines}} are machines having {{some kind of}} electric current in the rotor which creates a magnetic field which interacts with the stator windings.

5000|$|The SCS process feeds {{hot rolled}} sheet steel, either as {{individual}} blanks or as a continuous strip that is uncoiled, into the SCS [...] "brushing machine". Within the machine the steel is passed between sets of rotating roller brushes that spin on an axis perpendicular to the sheet's direction of travel. The roller brush exterior is an engineered abrasive, similar to Scotchbrite, that makes contact with the steel under pressure. Each roller brush spins against the steel at a speed of 900 to 1000 revolutions per minute, [...] "scrubbing away" [...] the outer layers of mill scale - hematite and magnetite - {{and most of the}} inner layer, wustite. The remaining wustite layer is only a few micrometres thick and highly polished to a smooth surface. Three such roller brushes are typically applied to each surface of the steel sheet, for a total of six roller brushes per SCS <b>brushing</b> <b>machine.</b> Numerous spray nozzles within the <b>brushing</b> <b>machine</b> provide water to rinse the removed scale and any other debris from the steel surface and to cool the friction heat generated in the brushes. The water is filtered and re-used in this closed-loop rinsing/filtering system.|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} whether {{patients should be}} advised to perform toothbrushing before or after an acidic challenge to minimize enamel and dentin wear by brushing abrasion. METHODS: The study was a two-period crossover design (A and B, each 14 days) in which three enamel and dentin specimens were fixed in intraoral appliances of 10 volunteers. The following regimens were performed {{three times a day}} with at least 4 hours in between: A: 20 -second brushing treatment in an automatic <b>brushing</b> <b>machine,</b> 5 minutes intraoral exposure of the specimens, extraoral erosion of enamel and dentin specimens for 40 seconds or B: Extraoral erosion for 40 seconds, 5 minutes intraoral exposure of the specimens, 20 -second brushing treatment in an automatic <b>brushing</b> <b>machine.</b> Enamel and dentin loss {{at the end of each}} 14 -day regimen was assessed by profilometry and statistically analyzed by t-test. RESULTS: For all volunteers, mean enamel and dentin wear was significantly lower when brushing treatment was performed before erosion (A: enamel: 2. 3 +/- 1. 0 microm, dentin: 4. 1 +/- 1. 6 microm) than when brushing was applied after erosion (B: enamel: 6. 4 +/- 3. 0 microm, dentin: 15. 3 +/- 6. 8 microm). It was concluded that patients awaiting an erosive attack should perform toothbrushing prior to rather than after an acidic challenge to minimize enamel and dentin wear...|$|R
50|$|When {{classifying}} electric machines (motors and generators) it {{is reasonable}} to start with physical principle for converting electric energy to mechanical energy. If the controller is included {{as a part of the}} machine all machines can be powered by either alternating or direct current, although some machines will need a more advanced controller than others. Classification is complicated by the possibilities of combining physical principles when constructing an electrical machine. It can, for example, be possible to run a <b>brushed</b> <b>machine</b> as a reluctance machine (without using the rotor coils) if the rotor iron has the correct shape.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Brushed</b> <b>{{machines}}</b> are machines {{where the}} rotor coil is supplied with current through brushes {{in much the}} same way as current is supplied to the car in an electric slot car track. More durable brushes can be made of graphite or liquid metal. It is even possible to eliminate the brushes in a [...] "brushed machine" [...] by using a part of rotor and stator as a transformer which transfer current without creating torque. Brushes must not be confused with a commutator. The difference is that the brushes only transfer electric current to a moving rotor while a commutator also provide switching of the current direction.|$|R
25|$|Blyth's {{original}} {{wind generator}} {{was the first}} known structure by which electricity was generated from wind power, but its lack of a braking mechanism meant it was prone to damage in strong winds. In the winter of 1887, some months after Blyth's first wind generator was built, American, Charles F. Brush built the first automatically operated wind turbine. The design of <b>Brush's</b> <b>machine</b> allowed it {{to be shut down}} manually to protect it from wind damage. The improved design of the turbine built for the Montrose Lunatic Asylum (which was based on Thomas Robinson's anemometer design) went some way towards solving this problem but it could not be guaranteed to stall in very strong winds.|$|R

Regarding abrasion test with Daroghar 3, Nasim, Crest 7 and Crest sensitivity toothpastes, samples were located in V 8 cross <b>brushing</b> <b>machine.</b> After washing and drying, the secondary surface roughness was again measured with the roughness measuring device. Average wear of samples was analyzed by means of ONEWAY ANOVA. Results: The study results indicated no significant difference among the four types of toothpaste (p= 0. 855).

40|$|From 1990 to 1994 the {{research}} institutes of the Agricultural Research Department in the Netherlands (DLO-NL) investigated potential new arable oilseed crops for industrial application {{as part of}} the National Oilseeds Programme (NOP).

This paper describes {{the research}} conducted on the crops Calendula officinalis and Dimorphotheca pluvialis, using three harvesting methods: combining (New Holland 8070), combining after chemical desiccation and combining after windrowing. Gross yield, moisture content of harvested seeds and foliage, seed losses and impurities of the seeds were measured.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to assess the {{thickness}} of softened enamel removed by toothbrushing. Human enamel specimens were indented with a Knoop diamond.

This study examined brushing abrasion of 4 standard toothbrushes (Soft Oral-B, Medium Oral-B, Soft Panbeh-Riz and Medium Panbeh-Riz) in vitro. A specific mold was used to make samples by setting composite on acrylic resin. The samples were subjected to a 200 g force applied by toothbrushes connected to V 8 Cross <b>Brushing</b> <b>Machine</b> for 18000 cycles in the solution of toothpaste with fluoride and distilled water.
