60|$|<b>I</b> <b>laughed</b> <b>with</b> scorn as <b>I</b> lay {{in my bed}} (and so did {{the ghost}} give a ghastly snigger).|$|R
60|$|He laughed {{outright}} this time. It was {{a delightful}} laugh. It rang through the quiet Park, awaking echoes; and caught by it, <b>I</b> <b>laughed</b> <b>with</b> him.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>laughed</b> <b>with</b> Sally, but <b>I</b> disclaimed any {{knowledge}} of George's accident. I hated the thought of Wright, let alone anything concerning the fatal certainty {{that sooner or later}} these cousins of his were to suffer through him.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>laughed</b> <b>with</b> amused confidence. There was {{one among}} them had heard Lampugnani's words {{touching}} the messenger's hat--words that had cost the fellow his life. But my concern was little with the effect my words might produce upon his followers.|$|R
60|$|It {{was my turn}} to flush, but I did not. I {{felt that}} she was poking fun at me, and I admired a brave heart that could look for humour on the road to death, and so <b>I</b> <b>laughed</b> <b>with</b> her.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>laughed</b> <b>with</b> {{him at the}} improbability of {{such things}} befalling. I carried in my bosom too large a heart, and one that was the {{property}} of every wench I met--for just so long as I chanced {{to be in her}} company.|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>laughed</b> <b>with</b> him, but {{his wife}} did not, and in the silence that ensued {{there was nothing to}} prevent the Altrurian from coming in with another of his questions: [...] "How far does this state of things extend downward? Does it include the working classes, too?" ...|$|R
60|$|However, the sun {{which has}} such {{strength}} to kill noxious things, puts {{an end to}} ghosts more quickly even {{than it does to}} other evil vapours and emanations, and when I woke up to find it shining brilliantly in a pure heaven, <b>I</b> <b>laughed</b> <b>with</b> much heartiness over the whole affair.|$|R
60|$|It {{seemed that}} those two Arizona rangers, matured men though they were, would die of convulsions. <b>I</b> <b>laughed</b> <b>with</b> them, and so did Wallace, while he brought his one-handled bowie knife into novel use. Buffalo Jones never cracked a smile, though he did remark about the waste of good flour.|$|R
6000|$|... "Fine!... He {{wrote it}} to me. <b>I</b> <b>laughed.</b> <b>I</b> swelled <b>with</b> pride. It sent my blood racing. It {{filled me with}} fight.... Then I sneaked up here to cry." ...|$|R
50|$|John Vargas {{was cast}} in Neil Simon's film Only When <b>I</b> <b>Laugh,</b> <b>with</b> Marsha Mason and James Coco. The {{following}} year, he featured in the film Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan {{in the role of}} Jedda, and then joined the cast of ABC's At Ease, becoming one of the first Latino actors to star in an American television sitcom.|$|R
60|$|As {{she gazed}} long at the {{portrait}} {{she fell into}} thought, till {{her eyes filled with}} tears, and she touched the cardboard with her lips. Then she <b>laughed</b> <b>with</b> a nervous <b>lightness,</b> and wiped her eyes.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>laughed</b> softly, and <b>with</b> some bitterness, too, for I {{was angry}} with myself.|$|R
60|$|My face fairly tingled, and <b>I</b> heard Nick <b>laughing</b> <b>with</b> unseemly merriment.|$|R
6000|$|... "Very well, sir," [...] Macomber {{replied in}} a tone of content, and <b>I</b> <b>laughed</b> {{inwardly}} <b>with</b> joy, for he would be our prisoner to a certainty if he came down the river alone.|$|R
5000|$|<b>I</b> want to <b>laugh</b> <b>with</b> you, <b>I</b> want {{to trust}} you, and I don't {{care if it}} hurts ...|$|R
60|$|Nay, {{never have}} I felt my spirit lighter within me, so that <b>I</b> <b>laughed</b> and chattered like a fey man. The fresh air, after my long {{lying in a}} chamber, stirred me like wine. The May sun shone warm, yet cooled with a sweet wind of the west. The room was full of women and maids, all waiting to throw flowers before the Maid, whom they dearly loved. Everything had a look of holiday, and all was to end in joy and great victory. So <b>I</b> <b>laughed</b> <b>with</b> the girls, and listened to a strange tale, how the Maid had but of late brought back to life a dead child at Lagny, so that he got his rights of Baptism, and anon died again.|$|R
6000|$|... "How could I," [...] laughed Friedel, [...] "when {{the echo}} was casting {{back in my}} teeth my own shout to thee? <b>I</b> could only <b>laugh</b> <b>with</b> Rudiger." ...|$|R
6000|$|Still, I'd go {{the world}} with Beauty, [...] <b>I</b> would <b>laugh</b> <b>with</b> her and sing, I would shun divinest duty [...] To resume her worshipping. But she'd scorn my brave endeavour, [...] She would not balm the breeze By murmuring [...] "Thine for ever!" [...] As she did upon this leaze.|$|R
60|$|Oh, my joy as I {{heard the}} words! What an end--what an {{end for the}} first swordsman of France! <b>I</b> could have <b>laughed</b> <b>with</b> delight at the thought.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, miss, {{to speak}} equal-like, {{that was about}} the size of it. The old liar said she had seen you before, that you were--well, there you are!--a gold mine, a--a blessed gold mine. Her very words nearabout." [...] At that, in an insuppressible gush of {{happiness}} <b>I</b> <b>laughed</b> out <b>with</b> him, like a flageolet in a concourse of bassoons.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> {{tried to}} <b>laugh</b> <b>with</b> my little friend over his parting jest, but my spirits {{were not to}} be commanded. Something jarred in me almost painfully while he was {{speaking}} his light farewell words.|$|R
6000|$|... "Forgive me, M. de Luynes," [...] he gasped. [...] "Pardieu, 't is {{no matter}} for laughter, and albeit <b>I</b> <b>laughed</b> <b>with</b> more zest than courtesy, I {{give you my}} word that my admiration for you vastly exceeds my amusement. M. de Luynes," [...] he added, rising and holding {{out his hand to}} me, [...] "there are liars in Paris who give you an evil name--men who laughed at me when they heard that I had given you leave to go on parole to St. Sulpice des Reaux that night, trusting to your word of honour that you would return if you lived. His Eminence dubbed me a fool and went near to dismissing me from his service, and yet I have now the proof that my {{confidence}} was not misplaced, since even though you were believed to be dead, you did not hesitate to bring me your sword." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "By Jove, {{and so had}} I. Make no apology. And let me {{tell you}} this,--though perhaps you will not credit me,--that <b>I</b> would sooner <b>laugh</b> <b>with</b> a comrade than cry with him is true enough; but, if {{occasion}} demands, I can do the latter also." ...|$|R
60|$|Distinct, coldly, calmly distinct, fell {{those few}} simple sounds within my ear, and thence like molten lead rolled hissingly into my brain. Years--years may pass away, but {{the memory of}} that epoch never. Nor was I indeed ignorant of the flowers and the vine--but the hemlock and the cypress overshadowed me night and day. And I kept no {{reckoning}} of time or place, and the stars of my fate faded from heaven, and therefore the earth grew dark, and its figures passed by me like flitting shadows, and among them all I beheld only--Morella. The winds of the firmament breathed but one sound within my ears, and the ripples upon the sea murmured evermore--Morella. But she died; and with my own hands I bore her to the tomb; and <b>I</b> <b>laughed</b> <b>with</b> a long and bitter <b>laugh</b> as <b>I</b> found no traces of the first in the channel where I laid the second.--Morella.|$|R
50|$|Ashton played {{numerous}} TV roles; credits include: On the Buses (1971) - subsequently making memorable {{appearances in}} two spin-off films; The Benny Hill Show (1972-80); Both Ends Meet (1972, with Dora Bryan); Don't Drink the Water (1975, an On the Buses spin-off); Yus, My Dear (1976, with Arthur Mullard), Rooms (1977); Only When <b>I</b> <b>Laugh</b> (1980, <b>with</b> James Bolam); The Gaffer (1981-83, with Bill Maynard), and Tripper's Day (1984, with Leonard Rossiter) Beer Hunter Minder Episode 1980 (with Dennis Waterman, George Cole.|$|R
60|$|Well, {{as soon as}} I got out in {{the company}} of others I was driven to melancholy and spiritual tears. <b>I</b> could neither <b>laugh</b> <b>with</b> nor at the solemn utterances of men I esteemed {{ponderous}} asses; nor could <b>I</b> <b>laugh,</b> nor engage in my old-time lightsome persiflage, with the silly superficial chatterings of women, who, underneath all their silliness and softness, were as primitive, direct, and deadly in their pursuit of biological destiny as the monkeys women were before they shed their furry coats and replaced them with the furs of other animals.|$|R
60|$|In {{the village}} graveyard, which lies {{contiguous}} to the street, I {{saw a man}} digging a grave, and one inhabitant after another turned aside from his way {{to look into the}} grave and talk with the digger. <b>I</b> heard him <b>laugh,</b> <b>with</b> the traditionary mirthfulness of men of that occupation.|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} exactly ten years since I first {{set foot in}} South Africa to conduct a {{nationwide}} lecture tour on OBE. That was October, 1997. In venue after venue for four solid weeks, I addressed thousands of educators {{in all parts of}} the country and was often introduced as “The Father of OBE. ” Each time that happened <b>I</b> would <b>laugh</b> <b>with</b> the audience and explain that, for this title to be true, I would have to be at least 500 years old...|$|R
60|$|Thus I pursued my {{way along}} the line of the ancient stone wall that Paul Dudley built, and through white villages, and past {{orchards}} of ruddy apples, and fields of ripening maize, and patches of woodland, and all such sweet rural scenery as looks the fairest, a little beyond the suburbs of a town. Hollingsworth, Zenobia, Priscilla! They glided mistily before me, as I walked. Sometimes, in my solitude, <b>I</b> <b>laughed</b> <b>with</b> the bitterness of self-scorn, remembering how unreservedly I had given up my heart and soul to interests that were not mine. What had I ever had to do with them? And why, being now free, should I take this thraldom on me once again? It was both sad and dangerous, I whispered to myself, to be in too close affinity with the passions, the errors, and the misfortunes of individuals who stood within a circle of their own, into which, if I stept at all, it must be as an intruder, and at a peril that I could not estimate.|$|R
6000|$|... 'If I {{had done}} it myself,' thought Hurree, 'it {{would not have been}} better; and, by Jove, now I think of it, of course I {{arranged}} it myself. How quick I have been! Just when I ran downhill I thought it! Thee outrage was accidental, but onlee me could have worked it--ah--for all it was dam'-well worth. Consider the moral effect upon these ignorant peoples! No treaties--no papers--no written documents at all--and me to interpret for them. How <b>I</b> shall <b>laugh</b> <b>with</b> the Colonel! <b>I</b> wish I had their papers also: but you cannot occupy two places in space simultaneously. Thatt is axiomatic.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why," [...] said my sentimental friend Gregoire, [...] "for {{the matter}} of that, I can answer that the lad was always talking about this young woman: {{he told me the}} whole story himself, and many a good <b>laugh</b> <b>I</b> had <b>with</b> citizen Schneider as we talked about it." ...|$|R
50|$|Asma, {{as seven}} year old {{domestic}} servant from Mardan narrates in the documentary, “I was always unhappy. Especially at night, I would miss {{my sister and}} remember how she would sleep by me at night and remembering her made me cry. When I arrived home, my sister came running towards me calling me “api api”. (Sister) I couldn’t have been any happier that day. Every time my sister would call me “api” <b>I</b> would <b>laugh</b> <b>with</b> joy and remember how much I missed her there.” Several of the tasks are not hazardous under normal circumstances however when they are undertaken {{in a state of}} fatigue due to long hours of work and interrupted sleep even simple tasks become hazardous.|$|R
6000|$|The Lady: [...] "Oh, yes, my flowers. I nearly {{went away}} without deciding. Let me see. Where are those white roses with the pink tinge {{on the edge}} of the petals?" [...] The florist pushes the box towards her, and she looks down at the roses. [...] "No, they won't do. They look somehow--cruel! I don't wonder he wouldn't have them. They are totally out of character. I will take those white Bride roses, too. It seems a fatality, but there really isn't {{anything}} else, and <b>I</b> can <b>laugh</b> <b>with</b> her about them, if it all turns out well." [...] She talks to herself rather than the florist, who stands patient behind the counter, and repeats, dreamily, [...] "Laugh with her!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{say they}} {{sometimes}} attached themselves to very clever women!" [...] <b>I</b> answered, <b>laughing.</b> <b>I</b> spoke <b>with</b> great deliberation, but as my words fell upon the air they {{struck me as}} imprudent. However, I risked them and I was not sorry, for perhaps after all the old woman {{would be willing to}} treat. It seemed to be tolerably obvious that she knew my secret: why therefore drag the matter out? But she did not take what I had said as a confession; she only asked: ...|$|R
25|$|Madhubala {{was quite}} another matter. I {{knew she was}} very sick even before I married her. But a promise is a promise. So I kept my word and brought her home as my wife, even though I knew she was dying from a {{congenital}} heart problem. For 9 long years I nursed her. I watched her die before my own eyes. You can never understand what this means until you live through this yourself. She was such a beautiful woman and she died so painfully. She would rave and rant and scream in frustration. How can such an active person spend 9 long years bed-ridden? And I had to humour her all the time. That's what the doctor asked me to. That's what I did till her very last breath. <b>I</b> would <b>laugh</b> <b>with</b> her. <b>I</b> would cry with her.|$|R
