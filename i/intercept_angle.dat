By stretching {{a line between}} Borkum and List, composing {{the base of a}} triangle and simultaneously the chord, a circular direction finding coverage could be made over the North Sea. At its maximum, the coverage could direction-find the Royal Navy's Home Fleet which was located at Scapa Flow. At that range, a measurement accuracy of ±1° attributed to both stations, would have put location to within an accuracy of around 35 km diameter circle.|$|E

To intercept that course line, the plane turned to a heading of approximately 210 degrees, which was a proper <b>intercept</b> <b>angle</b> of almost 45 degrees. If the pilot had configured his audio selector switches properly, {{he would have been}} able to hear the aural Morse code identifier of [...] "A", for the north side of that low frequency range, and then as he neared the course line itself, he would begin to hear the [...] "N" [...] identifier. That would be the signal that it was time to turn left again, and track the 168 degree course line to the WONT intersection. But, the plane never turned left again. Instead, it remained on that fatal 210 degree intercept heading, until impact.|$|E
50|$|In {{the figure}} above, {{illustrating}} the truncation {{of the incident}} spherical wave by the lens, we may note one very significant fact. In order to measure the point spread function — or impulse response function — of the lens, {{we do not need}} a perfect point source that radiates a perfect spherical wave in all directions of space. This is because our lens has only a finite (angular) bandwidth, or finite <b>intercept</b> <b>angle.</b> Therefore, any angular bandwidth contained in the source, which extends past the edge angle of the lens (i.e., lies outside the bandwidth of the system), is essentially wasted source bandwidth because the lens can't intercept it in order to process it. As a result, a perfect point source is not required in order to measure a perfect point spread function. All we need is a light source which has at least as much angular bandwidth as the lens being tested (and of course, is uniform over that angular sector). In other words, we only require a point source which is produced by a convergent (uniform) spherical wave whose half angle is greater than the edge angle of the lens.|$|E

These flight tests were conducted at NASA's Wallops Flight Center using the Microwave Landing System (MLS) installation on Runway 22. This report is primarily a collection of data plots of all performance variables recorded for the entire five flight tests. A description and source of the performance variables is included. Performance variables include inertial data, air data, automatic control commands, control servo positions, sensor data, DIALS guidance and control parameters, and Kalman filter data.

40|$|Abstract: Nannoconids {{have been}} {{recorded}} in a rock-forming quantity in the uppermost Jurassic-Lower Cretaceous rock units in Northwest Anatolia, Turkey. Samples were collected from seventeen stratigraphic sections spanning the calciturbidities of the Yosunlukbayırı Formation and pelagic micrites of the Soğukçam Limestone. Because of rareness and difficulties for extracting of calcareous nannofossil species particularly zone markers in these type lithologies, nannoconids have particular attention in terms of biostratigraphy. Twenty nine species of nannoconids were recorded in the studied samples. Their taxonomy were revised and their stratigraphic ranges were given. The classification of genus Nannoconus {{is based on the}} gross morphology of the test, presence of central cavity or central canal, proportion of central cavity to thickness of the wall, proportion of height to width. Thickness of calcite elements, degree of horizontal <b>intercept</b> <b>angle,</b> type of apertures and degree of horizontal <b>intercept</b> <b>angle,</b> type of apertures, and degree of angle of apertural elements are also used for description of the species. Fluctuations in nannoconid abundance are related to lithological changes. High abundance of nannoconids in limestones indicates clear surface water palaeoenvironments without terrigenous influx. From the stratigraphical point of view, their importance was clarified by their high abundance peaks. Problematic zonal boundaries of the nannofossil zonation could be determined by major nannoconid bioevents...|$|E

40|$|A {{guidance}} law derived by modifying state dependent Riccati equation technique, {{to enable the}} imposition of a predetermined terminal <b>intercept</b> <b>angle</b> to a maneuvering target, is presented in this paper. The interceptor is assumed to have no knowledge about the type of maneuver the target is executing. The problem is cast in a non-cooperative game theoretic form. The {{guidance law}} obtained is dependent on the LOS angular rotational rate and on the impact angle error. Theoretical conditions which guarantee existence of solutions under this method have been derived. It is shown that imposing the impact angle constraint calls for an increase in the gains of the guidance law considerably, subsequently requiring a higher maneuverability advantage of the interceptor. The performance of the proposed guidance law is studied using a non-linear two dimensional simulation of the relative kinematics, assuming first order dynamics for the interceptor and target...|$|E

It is found that range errors of 4000 to 6000 feet at the entry of MLS coverage which then reduce to 1000 -foot errors at runway centerline intercept are possible for GA operations.

40|$|During {{automatic}} horizontal path captures, the (Terminal Configured Vehicle) B- 737 airplane maintained {{smaller than}} designed path intercept angles and experienced a sawtooth bank angle oscillation during its turn towards the path. From flight data, {{it was determined}} that these anomalies were caused by the improper output of the course cut limiter in the horizontal path control law. The output from the course cut limiter did not obtain its full value and it was calculated stepwise discontinuously. The automatic horizontal path captures were then conducted on the TCV B- 737 airplane real-time simulation. The path intercept angles were maintained properly and no bank angle oscillation was encountered. Data showed that the course cut limiter was calculated at its full value in a continuous manner. The intermediate calculations of the course cut limiter in the airplane's navigation computer were rewritten and rescaled in such a manner that truncation errors could be minimized.

40|$|This {{research}} {{investigates the}} use of Solution Space Diagram (SSD) {{as a measure of}} sector complexity and also as a predictor of performance and workload, focusing on the scenarios regarding Air Traffic Controller (ATCO) ’s ability to detect future conflicts. A human-in-the-loop experiment with varying <b>intercept</b> <b>angle</b> within the same sector layout has been designed and conducted. A short duration and a single predetermined conflict for each scenario were programmed to ensure a controlled experiment environment. The main aim of this experiment is to investigate whether the SSD can predict the workload ratings and subject performance in a conflict detection task. Based on the results, no common pattern can be observed, which can directly associate workload ratings and SSD area properties for various intercept angles. As conflict presented in the experiment between the converging aircraft, it was found that smaller SSD observation angles correlate better with the workload rating. These results were anticipated, as in converging conditions aircraft ahead of the velocity vector will be captured as the main focus. The SSD also does not represent a trigger for conflict detection. There is no consistent SSD area percentage where ATCO would start detecting conflict. Thus, it is concluded that the SSD does not represent a trigger for conflict detection...|$|E
40|$|Pulsed Doppler {{echocardiography}} {{has been}} considered poorly suited for high velocity blood flow measurement, because {{of the problem of}} signal aliasing. Two methods for reduction of aliasing in a pulsed system were evaluated in an attempt to measure flow velocities characteristic of significant pressure gradients. With the angle correction method, carrier frequency, pulse repetition frequency and <b>intercept</b> <b>angle</b> were manipulated using a commercially available two-dimensional pulsed Doppler system. Forty children undergoing cardiac catheterization were studied. Gradients of 60 to 70 mm Hg were accurately predicted by this method, and gradients above 90 mm Hg were underestimated. Overall correlation (r) value was 0. 95. The method is limited primarily by the introduction of potential error in measurement of intercept angle; it is advantageous in that it can be attempted using currently available pulsed Doppler echographic systems. With the multiple sample volume method, pulse repetition frequency was increased through the addition of extra sample volumes. Carrier frequency was minimized and angle correction was not employed. Thirty-nine children underwent cardiac catheterization using a prototype instrument. Excellent agreement between Doppler predictions and actual gradients was found for gradients up to 100 mm Hg (r = 0. 99). Although this method requires new instrumentation, it is advantageous in that gradients are accurately predicted and cannot be overestimated. Both methods retain the advantages of pulsed Doppler study for comprehensive flow evaluation and reference their quantitative application within a two-dimensional echographic format. Neither method is simple, and each has been validated only in pediatric subjects...|$|E
40|$|The Poggendorff {{illusion}} in its classical form {{of parallel}} lines interrupting a transversal is {{viewed from the}} perspective of being related to the everyday experience of observing the light refraction in water. It is argued that, if one considers a transversal to be a light ray in air and the parallel lines to form an occluding strip of a medium with the refractive index being between that of air and water, then one should be able to account, both qualitatively and quantitatively, for most of the features associated with the Poggendorff illusion. Statistical treatment of the visual experiments conducted with 7 participants, each analysing 50 configurations having different <b>intercepting</b> <b>angles</b> and strip widths, resulted in the effective refractive index of the occluding strip N = 1. 13 +/- 0. 15, which is sufficiently close to the average (between that of water and air) refractive index of ~ 1. 17.

The purpose {{of this investigation was}} to measure the four flows in normal subjects using the range-gated pulsed Doppler echocar-diographic technique. Velocities were obtained from 22 subjects aged 4 to 29 years at a beam-flow <b>intercept</b> <b>angle</b> close to 0 ° in the ascending aorta, distal main pulmonary artery and the tricuspid and mitral valve outflow areas. Vessel and orifice sizes of the ascending aorta, main pulmonary artery and tricuspid valve orifice were measured directly from two-dimensional echocardiographic images. The mitral valve orifice was {{measured by}} a previously described method. Results show that flow values for the ascending aorta, main pulmonary artery and tricuspid valve inflow area were similar in absolute magnitude and correlated strongly (r = 0. 93 to 0. 98). Slopes for these relations were approximated at 1. 0. The absolute magnitude of mitral valve flows was highly variable and showed the poorest correlation with flows from the other areas (r = 0. 59 to 0. 67). The high correlation of ascending aorta, main pulmonary artery and tricuspid valve outflow areas was considerably assisted by recording of velocity at a verified angle near 0 ° and obtaining accurate vessel and valve diameters. Improved angle accuracy was possible in the ascending aorta {{with the use of a}} new transducer designed to image anteroinferiorly from the suprasternal notch. A relatively simple method for measuring tricuspid flow was developed.

40|$|In a collider, due to {{the lack}} of {{powerful}} electrostatic separators, the most efficient way to push up the collision frequency and to avoid, at the same time, parasitic interactions is to make the trajectories of the two op-posite beams <b>intercepting</b> at an <b>angle.</b> This scheme was adopted in DORIS I, but its effectiveness was reduced by an unexpected effect: the excitation of synchro-betatron resonances.

For this propose, the R (www. r-project. org) software was used together with a user defined application developed at the University of Minho called RMiner. The factor of safety (FS) and probability of failure (PF) were computed for 365 homogeneous slopes using the software SLOPE/W varying geometric parameters (height, height of the water surface and slope angle) and geotechnical parameters (weight density, cohesion <b>intercept</b> and <b>angle</b> of shearing resistance). Heights between 10 m and 15 m and slope angles between 40 º and 70 º were considered. This data allowed building a database to be analysed using the Data Mining techniques. In this process several algorithms were used for the prediction of FS and PF, namely: multiple regression, regression trees, artificial neural networks, support vector machines and k-nearest neighbours. To evaluate the performance of each technique REC curves (Regression Error Characteristic) and several error measures were used. This application allowed developing reliable models to predict important safety parameters for slopes without having to carry out a classical limit equilibrium calculation. They also allow performing quick parametric studies for the early stages of slope design. To predict FS the support vector machines showed to have the best overall performance. In the case of PF the artificial neural network proved to be more reliable to predict this parameter. With this study it was also possible to conclude that cohesion intercept was the parameter with more influence on the assessed safety parameters...|$|R

40|$|Several {{broadband}} ultraviolet (UV) radiation {{angular distribution}} investigations have been previously presented. As the biologically damaging effectiveness of UV radiation {{is known to}} be wavelength dependent, it is necessary to expand this research into the distribution of the spectral UV. UV radiation is also susceptible to Rayleigh and Mie scattering processes, both of which are completely wavelength dependent. Additionally, the majority of previous measurements detailing the biologically damaging effect of spectral UV radiation have been oriented with respect to the horizontal plane or in a plane directed towards the sun (sun-normal), with the irradiance weighted against action spectra formulated specifically for human skin and tissue. However, the human body consists of very few horizontal or sun-normal surfaces. Extending the previous research by measuring the distribution of the spectral irradiance across the sky for the complete terrestrial solar UV waveband and weighting it against erythemal, photoconjunctivital and photokeratital action spectra allowed for the analysis {{of the differences between the}} biologically effective irradiance (UVBE) values intercepted at different orientations and the effect of scattering processes upon the homogeneity of these UVBE distributions. It was established that under the local atmospheric environment, the distribution profile of the UVBE for each biological response was anisotropic, with the highest intensities generally <b>intercepted</b> at inclination <b>angles</b> situated between the horizontal and vertical planes along orientations closely coinciding with the sun-normal. A finding from this was that the angular distributions of the erythemal UVBE and the photoconjunctivital UVBE were different, due to the differential scattering between the shorter and longer UV wavelengths within the atmosphere.
