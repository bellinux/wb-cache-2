5|$|The woman's veil forms {{a diamond}} shape, {{balanced}} by the inverse flow of a light vest worn beneath her dress. She is shown at a slight angle, but her pose is centred by the interlocked broad lines of arms, décolletage and veil. The woman's head is delicately lit, leaving no strong tonal contrasts on her skin. She has a long, thin face, plucked eyebrows and eyelids, and a plucked hairline to create a fashionably high forehead. Her hair is tightly pinned back {{on the rim of}} the bonnet and rests above <b>her</b> <b>ear.</b> Her high headdress and severe hairline accentuate her elongated face, giving it a sculpted appearance.|$|E
5|$|Besides the Mahavidya Bagalamukhi, Matangi is {{the other}} Mahavidya, whose worship is {{primarily}} prescribed to acquire supernatural powers. A hymn in the Maha-bhagavata Purana asks her grace to control one's foes, while the Tantrasara says that recitation of her mantra, meditation on her form and her ritual worship gives one to the power to control people and make them attracted to oneself. Her devotees, especially Tantric sadhakas, are regarded to have transcend the pollution by offering her left-over or partially eaten food (Ucchishta) and thus overcome their ego. Worship of Matangi is described to allow her devotee to face the forbidden and transcend pollution, leading him to salvation or allowing him to gain supernatural powers for worldly goals. The Purashcharyarnava describes pleasing the goddess would result in her answering all the devotee's queries by whispering in <b>her</b> <b>ear.</b>|$|E

5|$|Randolph Chitwood, a cardiothoracic surgeon with East Carolina, {{performed}} the first minimally invasive robotic-assisted mitral-valve heart {{surgery in the}} United States. East Carolina researchers also developed an electronic fluency device called SpeechEasy; the device is designed to improve the fluency {{of a person who}} stutters by changing the sound of the user's voice in his or <b>her</b> <b>ear.</b> Walter Pories, a faculty member at The Brody School of Medicine developed the standard procedure for gastric bypass surgery. Researchers here also first discovered that 80% of obese/type 2 diabetic patients who underwent this surgical procedure had a reversal of the disease. The Biofeedback Lab is currently developing techniques to help service members recover from posttraumatic stress disorders and traumatic brain injuries they received in Afghanistan and Iraq. The in vitro fertilization program is ranked first in North Carolina and fourth overall in the United States. Jason Bond, a former scientist in the Department of Biology, discovered many new species of spiders, including Myrmekiaphila neilyoungi and Aptostichus stephencolberti.|$|E
5|$|Donna {{is taken}} to a dying TARDIS, which UNIT has managed to use as {{the core of a}} crude time machine. Rose uses energy from the TARDIS to show Donna the beetle on her back, but tells her they do not know what it is. She insists that Donna travel back to the day she made the fateful turn and choose to turn left again. Donna is transported back minutes before she would make that turn, but too far away to contact her past self in time. She makes the {{decision}} to walk out in front of a passing truck and let it hit her, creating a traffic jam that causes her past self to turn left out of impatience. As Donna lies on the ground dying, Rose whispers a message into <b>her</b> <b>ear</b> for the Doctor. The alternate universe disappears, and Donna finds herself back on Shan Shen. The beetle falls off of Donna's back, and the fortune teller runs away after uttering some terrified words about what Donna will become.|$|E
5|$|They realise {{that this}} was a trap {{arranged}} by Kovarian, as the Silence begin to escape confinement and overload the eyedrives (including Madame Kovarian's), killing their users. The Doctor and River escape {{to the top of the}} pyramid while Amy and Rory fight off a wave of Silence and Amy realises who Rory is. Madame Kovarian dislodges her own eyedrive as it begins to overload, but Amy forces it back in place with the intention of killing her as revenge for Kovarian taking her child (Melody Pond) away. Amy and Rory regroup with River and the Doctor. River tries to convince the Doctor that this frozen timeline is acceptable and that he does not have to die, but the Doctor explains that all of reality will soon break down. River claims she'll suffer more than anyone else in the universe if she has to kill the Doctor, despite his horror at the idea. To stop it, the Doctor marries River on the spot and whispers something in <b>her</b> <b>ear,</b> declaring that he had just told her his name. He then requests that River allow him to prevent the universe's destruction. The two kiss, and reality begins to return to normal.|$|E
60|$|For a {{long time}} she nestled to him, and he kissed her softly, her hair, <b>her</b> face, <b>her</b> <b>ears,</b> gently, softly, like dew falling. But this warm breath on <b>her</b> <b>ears</b> {{disturbed}} <b>her</b> again, kindled the old destructive fires. She cleaved to him, and {{he could feel his}} blood changing like quicksilver.|$|R

Colyer was severely injured in the jaw, nearly choking to death on his own blood. Sarah Loughton ran towards her mother, who had been moving between tables. Carolyn Loughton threw herself {{on top of her}} daughter.

25|$|Part of Duffy's talent– besides <b>her</b> <b>ear</b> for {{ordinary}} eloquence, her gorgeous, powerful, throwaway lines, her subtlety– is her ventriloquism. Like {{the best of}} her novelist peers... she slides {{in and out of}} her characters' lives on a stream of possessions, aspirations, idioms and turns of phrase. However, she is also a time-traveller and a shape-shifter, gliding from Troy to Hollywood, galaxies to intestines, sloughed-off skin to department stores while other poets make heavy weather of one kiss, one kick, one letter... from verbal nuances to mind-expanding imaginative leaps, her words seem freshly plucked from the minds of non-poets– that is, she makes it look easy.|$|E
25|$|Her {{battered}} {{body was}} found 18 March 2004, in a rolled-up carpet {{on the grounds of}} Newstead Abbey, Nottinghamshire. It weighed only six stone (84 lb or 36kg), and was covered with burns and bruises. There were a total of 60 separate injuries. <b>Her</b> <b>ear</b> was scarred and swollen, had split in half, and become infected; her mouth was injured so much that her bottom lip had detached. She had eleven broken ribs. The ultimate cause of death had been thrombosis from a blood clot in her brain, brought on by septicaemia, dehydration and repeated assaults. The injuries were such that police at first thought they had found the body of a young boy. Police took weeks to identify her, launching an appeal on the BBC TV programme Crimewatch and consulting Interpol. She was 20 years old.|$|E

25|$|Tiffany, Pat, {{and their}} friends and family arrive at the {{competition}} {{on the night of}} the football game. Tiffany despairs when she finds that Nikki actually is in the audience, invited by Ronnie and Veronica who want Nikki to lift her restraining order on Pat and give Pat the chance to reconcile with her. Tiffany walks to the bar and starts drinking. Pat finds her moments before their dance and drags her onto the dance floor. They begin their routine as the Eagles defeat the Dallas Cowboys. At the conclusion of their set, Tiffany and Pat score exactly 5 points. Amid cheers from friends and family and confused looks from the crowd, Pat approaches Nikki and speaks quietly into <b>her</b> <b>ear.</b> Tiffany sees this and runs off. Pat leaves Nikki behind after a short conversation, and chases Tiffany. He hands her a letter, in which he admits that he knows she forged Nikki's letter and confesses that he loved her from the moment he met her, though it took him so long to come to terms with it. They share a kiss. Patrizio opens a restaurant with the money he has won, Danny grows even closer to the Solitanos, and Pat and Tiffany begin a relationship, no longer wearing their wedding rings.|$|E
500|$|The {{challenge}} for painters of the Annunciation {{was how to}} visually represent the Incarnation, the Word made flesh, or Logos. They often showed rays of light emanating from Gabriel or a nearby window entering Mary's body to depict the concept of Christ [...] "who inhabited and passed through her body". The light rays might sometimes include an inscription, [...] and were sometimes shown entering <b>her</b> <b>ear,</b> {{in the belief that}} it was thus the Word became flesh.|$|E

But, when worn by Griet the pearl is also a directive to the audience {{to look at the}} [...] "... psychological potential within ..." [...] her erotic, unconsummated bond with Vermeer, unclear up to that point if it is real or not.|$|E
