50|$|The <b>prefrontal</b> <b>cortex</b> plays a {{significant}} role in mediating executive functions. Neuroimaging during neuropsychological tests of executive function, such as the stroop test and working memory tests, have found that cortical maturation of the <b>prefrontal</b> <b>cortex</b> correlates with executive function in children. Planning involves activation of the dorsolateral <b>prefrontal</b> <b>cortex</b> (DLPFC), anterior cingulate <b>cortex,</b> angular <b>prefrontal</b> <b>cortex,</b> right <b>prefrontal</b> <b>cortex,</b> and supramarginal gyrus. Working memory manipulation involves the DLPFC, inferior frontal gyrus, and areas of the parietal cortex. Inhibitory control involves multiple areas of the <b>prefrontal</b> <b>cortex</b> as well as the caudate nucleus and subthalamic nucleus. Task shifting doesn't involve specific regions of the brain, but instead involves multiple regions of the <b>prefrontal</b> <b>cortex</b> and parietal lobe.|$|R
5000|$|A {{hierarchical}} {{organization of}} the lateral <b>prefrontal</b> <b>cortex</b> has been developed in which different regions are categorized according to different [...] "levels" [...] of explanation.

40|$|The {{role of the}} <b>prefrontal</b> <b>cortex</b> remains controversial. Neuroimaging studies support modality-specific and process-specific {{functions}} {{related to}} working memory and attention. Its role may also be defined by changes in its influence over other brain regions including sensory and motor cortex. We used functional magnetic imaging (fMRI) to study the free selection of actions and colours. Control conditions used externally specified actions and colours. The <b>prefrontal</b> <b>cortex</b> was activated during free selection, regardless of modality, in contrast to modality-specific activations outside <b>prefrontal</b> <b>cortex.</b> Structural equation modelling (SEM) of fMRI data {{was used to test}} the hypothesis that although the same regions of <b>prefrontal</b> <b>cortex</b> may be active in tasks within different domains, there is task-dependent effective connectivity between <b>prefrontal</b> <b>cortex</b> and non-prefrontal cortex. The SEM included high-order interactions between modality, selection and regional activity. There was greater coupling between <b>prefrontal</b> <b>cortex</b> and motor cortex during free selection and action tasks, and between <b>prefrontal</b> <b>cortex</b> and visual cortex during free selection of colours. The results suggest that the functions of the <b>prefrontal</b> <b>cortex</b> may be defined not only by selection-specific rather than modality-specific processes, but also by changing patterns of effective connectivity from <b>prefrontal</b> <b>cortex</b> to motor and sensory cortices...|$|R
40|$|Dorsomedial <b>prefrontal</b> <b>cortex</b> is {{critical}} for the temporal control of behavior. Dorsomedial <b>prefrontal</b> <b>cortex</b> might alter neuronal activity {{in areas such as}} motor cortex to inhibit temporally inappropriate responses. We tested this hypothesis by recording from neuronal ensembles in rodent dorsomedial <b>prefrontal</b> <b>cortex</b> during a delayed-response task. One-third of dorsomedial prefrontal neurons were significantly modulated during the delay period. The activity of many of these neurons was predictive of premature responding. We then reversibly inactivated dorsomedial <b>prefrontal</b> <b>cortex</b> while recording ensemble activity in motor cortex. Inactivation of dorsomedial <b>prefrontal</b> <b>cortex</b> reduced delay-related firing, but not responserelated firing, in motor cortex. Finally, we made simultaneous recordings in dorsomedial <b>prefrontal</b> <b>cortex</b> and motor cortex and found strong delay-related temporal correlations between neurons in the two cortical areas. These data suggest that functional interactions between dorsomedial <b>prefrontal</b> <b>cortex</b> and motor cortex might serve as a top-down control signal that inhibits inappropriate responding...|$|R

Recently, however, evidence has been presented that lateral <b>prefrontal</b> <b>cortex</b> is also involved in high-level cognitive processes such as task set selection or inhibition {{in the absence of}} awareness. Here, we discuss evidence that not only lateral <b>prefrontal</b> <b>cortex,</b> but also rostral <b>prefrontal</b> <b>cortex</b> is involved in such kinds of implicit control processes.

40|$|Inhibitory {{control is}} subserved {{in part by}} {{discrete}} regions of the <b>prefrontal</b> <b>cortex</b> whose functionality may be altered according to specific trait-based phenotypes. Using a unified model of normal range personality traits, we examined activation within lateral and medial aspects of the <b>prefrontal</b> <b>cortex</b> during a manual go/no-go task. Evoked hemodynamic oxygenation within the <b>prefrontal</b> <b>cortex</b> was measured in 106 adults using a 16 -channel continuous-wave functional near-infrared spectroscopy system. Within lateral regions of the <b>prefrontal</b> <b>cortex,</b> greater activation was associated with higher trait levels of extraversion, agreeableness and conscientiousness, and lower neuroticism. Higher agreeableness was also related to more activation in the medial <b>prefrontal</b> <b>cortex</b> during inhibitory control. These results suggest that personality traits reflecting greater emotional stability, extraversion, agreeableness and conscientiousness {{may be associated with}} more efficient recruitment of control processes subserved by lateral regions of the <b>prefrontal</b> <b>cortex.</b> These findings highlight key links between trait-based phenotypes and neural activation patterns in the <b>prefrontal</b> <b>cortex</b> underlying inhibitory control...|$|R
40|$|Enhanced {{dopamine}} efflux in the <b>prefrontal</b> <b>cortex</b> is a well-documented {{response to}} acute stress. However, the underlying mechanism(s) for this response is unknown. Using in vivo microdialysis, we demonstrate that blocking glucocorticoid receptors locally within the rat <b>prefrontal</b> <b>cortex</b> {{results in a}} reduction in stress-evoked dopamine efflux. In contrast, blocking glucocorticoid receptors in the ventral tegmental area did not affect stress-evoked dopamine efflux in the <b>prefrontal</b> <b>cortex.</b> Additionally, local administration of corticosterone into the <b>prefrontal</b> <b>cortex</b> increased <b>prefrontal</b> dopamine efflux. The functional impact of enhanced dopamine efflux evoked by acute stress was demonstrated using a cognitive task dependent on the <b>prefrontal</b> <b>cortex</b> and sensitive to impairment in working memory. Notably, stress-induced impairments in cognition were attenuated by blockade of glucocorticoid receptors in the <b>prefrontal</b> <b>cortex.</b> Taken together, these data demonstrate that glucocorticoids act locally within the <b>prefrontal</b> <b>cortex</b> to modulate mesocortical dopamine efflux leading to the cognitive impairments observed during acute stress...|$|R

40|$|The <b>prefrontal</b> <b>cortex</b> {{is one of}} the {{key areas}} of the central {{mechanism}} of cardiovascular and respiratory control. Disinhibition of the prelimbic medial <b>prefrontal</b> <b>cortex</b> elicits tachypnoeic responses in anesthetized rats (Hassan et al., J. Physiol. 591 : 6069 â€“ 6088, 2013). The current study examines the effects of inhibition of the prelimbic <b>prefrontal</b> <b>cortex</b> during presentation of stressors of various lengths and intensities in conscious unrestrained rats. 8 Wistar rats were implanted with bilateral guide cannulas targeting the prelimbic <b>prefrontal</b> <b>cortex</b> and received microinjections of either saline of GABAA agonist muscimol prior to recording sessions. Inhibition of the prelimbic <b>prefrontal</b> <b>cortex</b> significantly attenuated respiratory responses to a novel environment stress, 30 s light stimulus and restraint stress. It did not affect respiratory responses to 500 ms acoustic stimuli of varying intensities (40 â€“ 90 dB).

40|$|It {{has long}} been thought that the <b>prefrontal</b> <b>cortex,</b> as the seat of most higher brain functions, is {{functionally}} silent during most of infancy. This review highlights recent work concerned with the precise mapping (localization) of brain activation in human infants, providing evidence that <b>prefrontal</b> <b>cortex</b> exhibits functional activation much earlier than previously thought. A systematic evaluation of the activation patterns in these neuroimaging studies mainly based on functional near-infrared spectroscopy reveals that <b>prefrontal</b> <b>cortex</b> function can be broadly divided into two distinct anatomical clusters with different functional properties. One cluster of activations falls within {{the region of the}} medial <b>prefrontal</b> <b>cortex</b> and is mainly involved in affective processes; another cluster is located in lateral aspects of the <b>prefrontal</b> <b>cortex</b> and shows sensitivity to cognitive processes such as memory and attention. This distinction is in line with adult data and evolutionary models and may represent a developmentally continuous organization principle of <b>prefrontal</b> <b>cortex</b> function.

40|$|The {{projections}} {{from the}} amygdala and hippocampus (including subiculum and presubiculum) to <b>prefrontal</b> <b>cortex</b> were compared using anterograde tracers injected into macaque monkeys (Macaca fascicularis,Macaca mulatta). Almost all prefrontal areas {{were found to}} receive some amygdala inputs. These connections, which predominantly arose from the intermediate and magnocellular basal nucleus, were particularly dense {{in parts of the}} medial and orbital <b>prefrontal</b> <b>cortex.</b> Contralateral inputs were not, however, observed. The hippocampal projections to prefrontal areas were far more restricted, being confined to the ipsilateral medial and orbital <b>prefrontal</b> <b>cortex</b> (within areas 11, 13, 14, 24 a, 32, and 25). These hippocampal projections principally arose from the subiculum, with the fornix providing the sole route. Thus, while the lateral <b>prefrontal</b> <b>cortex</b> essentially receives only amygdala inputs, the orbital <b>prefrontal</b> <b>cortex</b> receives both amygdala and hippocampal inputs, though these typically target different areas. Only inmedial <b>prefrontal</b> <b>cortex</b> do direct inputs fromboth structures terminate in common sites. But, evenwhen convergence occurswithin an area, the projections predominantly terminate in different lamina (hippocampal inputs to layer III and amygdala inputs to layers I, II, and VI).

This finding contributes findings suggesting ventromedial <b>prefrontal</b> <b>cortex</b> being associated with preference judgement, possibly assigning the ventromedial <b>prefrontal</b> <b>cortex</b> a key role in constructing one's self. Studies with Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) also supported the idea that the ventromedial <b>prefrontal</b> <b>cortex</b> is an important component for reactivating past emotional associations and events, therefore essentially mediating pathogenesis of PTSD.

The right half of the ventrolateral <b>prefrontal</b> <b>cortex,</b> being active during emotion regulation, was activated when participants were offered an unfair offer in a scenario.

We hypothesized that (a) the integrity of specific white matter tracts is related to cognitive functioning {{in a manner consistent with}} the dorso-ventral and rostro-caudal organization of the <b>prefrontal</b> <b>cortex,</b> and (b) this would be particularly evident in healthy older adults. We assessed three cognitive processes that recruit the <b>prefrontal</b> <b>cortex</b> and can distinguish white matter tracts along the dorso-ventral and rostro-caudal dimensions â€“episodic memory, working memory, and reasoning. Correlations between cognition and fractional anisotropy as well as fiber tractography revealed: (a) Episodic memory was related to ventral prefrontal cortex-thalamo-hippocampal fiber integrity; (b) Working memory was related to integrity of corpus callosum body fibers subserving dorsolateral prefrontal cortex; and (c) Reasoning was related to integrity of corpus callosum body fibers subserving rostral and caudal dorsolateral <b>prefrontal</b> <b>cortex.</b> These findings confirm the ventrolateral <b>prefrontal</b> <b>cortexâ€™s</b> rol...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{experimental}} lesions of the monkey <b>prefrontal</b> <b>cortex</b> {{have played a}} predominant role in current conceptualizations of the functional organization of the lateral <b>prefrontal</b> <b>cortex,</b> {{especially with regard to}} working memory.

Brain cortical activity was measured using electroencephalography (EEG), and localized to the <b>prefrontal</b> <b>cortex</b> using standard low resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (LORETA). <b>Prefrontal</b> <b>cortex</b> oxygenation was measured using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). A significant increase in <b>prefrontal</b> <b>cortex</b> activity (p < 0. 05) was observed during hypergravity exposure compared to baseline. <b>Prefrontal</b> <b>cortex</b> oxygenation was significantly decreased during hypergravity exposure, with a decrease in oxyhemoglobin levels (p < 0. 05) compared to baseline, and an increase in deoxyhemoglobin levels (p < 0. 05) with increasing +Gz level.
