5|$|Eliot {{began writing}} The Dry Salvages {{at the end}} of 1940 during air-raids on London, and managed to finish the poem quickly. The poem {{included}} many personal images connecting to Eliot's childhood, and emphasised the image of water and sailing as a metaphor for humanity. According to the poem, there is a connection to all of mankind within each man. If we just accept drifting upon the sea, then we will end up broken upon rocks. We are restrained by time, but the Annunciation gave mankind hope that {{it will be able to}} escape. This hope is not part of the present. What we must <b>do</b> <b>is</b> understand the patterns found within the past in order to see that there is meaning to be found. This meaning allows one to experience eternity through moments of revelation.|$|E

5|$|Executive {{producer}} and head writer Steven Moffat wrote the episode as an introduction for Amy {{into the role}} of the Doctor's companion. The episode showcases her first adventure away from her home world and her first time in space. The climax of the episode, where the Doctor decides the best thing he can <b>do</b> <b>is</b> kill the Star Whale as painlessly as possible but Amy comes up with an alternative solution that is more humane, was designed to stand out in the Doctor's memory as a failure of a huge scale. It also reinforced the Doctor's need for a companion and showed how important Amy would be to him.|$|E

5|$|The Court {{added that}} there is a need for the {{decision-maker}} to adduce evidence in court to prove that considerations of national security are involved.

In other words, national security cannot be raised as a plea in bar to prevent the court from considering an application at all. However, what the court cannot <b>do</b> <b>is</b> decide what action national security requires. This is to be left solely to those responsible for it.|$|E

5|$|The band {{formed at}} Manchester University, but settled in London where they signed with Charisma. They {{went through a}} number of incarnations in their early years, {{including}} a brief split in 1969. When they reformed, they found minor commercial success with The Least We Can <b>Do</b> <b>Is</b> Wave to Each Other (February 1970), and after the follow-up album, H to He, Who Am the Only One (December 1970), stabilised around a line-up of Hammill, organist Hugh Banton, saxophonist David Jackson, and drummer Guy Evans. The quartet subsequently achieved significant success in Italy with the release of Pawn Hearts in 1971.|$|E
5|$|The group's {{previous}} album, The Least We Can <b>Do</b> <b>Is</b> Wave to Each Other (February 1970) {{had achieved}} {{a small amount}} of commercial success and critical acclaim in the UK and Europe. The next project the group attempted was recording the soundtrack to the 1970 film Eyewitness, but it was rejected, largely for being too sinister. They started to develop a live following during 1970, counting film director Anthony Minghella as one of their fans, but things backfired after a show at the Royal Festival Hall in June that drew negative reviews from Melody Makers Chris Welch. Around this time, the band decided to write some new material for a follow-up album.|$|E

5|$|Since Purple Tentacle's {{plans are}} {{flawless}} and unstoppable, Dr. Fred decides {{to use his}} Chron-o-John time machines to send Bernard, Laverne and Hoagie to the day before to turn off his Sludge-o-Matic machine, thereby preventing Purple Tentacle's exposure to the sludge.Bernard: Isn't it a little late for that, Doctor?Dr. Fred: Of course! That's why I'll have to do it... YESTERDAY! To the time machine!}} However, because Dr. Fred used an imitation diamond rather than a real diamond as a power source for the time machine, the Chron-o-Johns breaks down in operation. Laverne is sent 200 years in the future, where humanity has been enslaved and Purple Tentacle rules {{the world from the}} Edison mansion, while Hoagie is dropped 200 years in the past, where the motel is being used by the Founding Fathers as a retreat to write the United States Constitution. Bernard is returned to the present. To salvage Dr. Fred's plan, Bernard must acquire a replacement diamond for the time machine, while Hoagie and Laverne must restore power to their respective Chron-o-John pods by plugging them in.Bernard: Well, hurry up and bring them back! Dr. Fred: I will, as soon as I get a new diamond! Then all your buddies have to <b>do</b> <b>is</b> plug in their respective Chron-o-Johns and—Bernard: Plug them in?!? Where is Hoagie going to find an electrical outlet two hundred years in the past!?!Dr. Fred: Yes... well... He'll be needing my patented superbattery then, won't he?}} To overcome the lack of electricity in the past, Hoagie recruits the help of Benjamin Franklin and Dr. Fred's ancestor, Red Edison, to build a superbattery to power his pod, while Laverne evades capture by the tentacles long enough to run an extension cord to her unit. The three send small objects back and forth in time through the Chron-o-Johns and make changes to history to help the others complete their tasks.|$|E
5|$|Snow and the Huntsman walk {{together}} in the forest, and she sees through his disguise and correctly guesses that he was sent by the Queen to kill her. Snow flees, but as the Huntsman catches up with her, he finds her writing a letter, which she requests he deliver to the queen after she is killed. The Huntsman takes out his knife, but instead of killing her, he fashions a whistle out of a bamboo stick, telling her that it will summon help and then telling her to run. The Huntsman then returns to the queen with a deer heart, hoping that she will not know the difference. The queen asks him to read her the letter, which is an apology for past wrongs {{as well as a}} request from Snow that her stepmother rule the kingdom with compassion. The queen burns the letter and takes the box with the heart in it to store in her vault. When she cannot open one of her storage safes, it proves that the Huntsman lied to her; the heart is not human. The Queen has her guards drag him down to the vault and she yanks his glowing heart out of his body. She tells the Huntsman that from now on he will be her pet and will do her bidding forever, and if he ever betrays her, all she has to <b>do</b> <b>is</b> squeeze.|$|E
5|$|The central {{image of}} The Dry Salvages is {{water and the}} sea. The images {{are similar to the}} Odyssey but {{represent}} internal aspects. Humanity loses itself to technology and theories like evolution that separate mankind philosophically from the past. According to Eliot, within each man there is a connection to all of mankind. If we just accept drifting upon the sea, then we will end up broken upon rocks. We are restrained by time, but the Annunciation gave mankind hope that {{he will be able to}} escape. This hope is not part of the present. What we must <b>do</b> <b>is</b> understand the patterns found within the past to see that there is meaning to be found. This meaning allows one to experience eternity through moments of revelation. Through Christ, we are able to overcome time unless we do not know him. Our corruption can be overcome and that we are able to join the eternal.|$|E
