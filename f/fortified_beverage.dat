We studied the efficacy of a new <b>fortified</b> <b>beverage</b> in improving the nutritional status of children in Botswana. We screened 311 lower income urban school children, ages 6 – 11 y, in two primary schools near Gaborone. Children were given seven 240 -mL servings weekly of either an experimental beverage (EXP) fortified with 12 micronutrients or an isoenergetic placebo drink (CON) for 8 wk. Weight, mid-upper arm circumference, hemoglobin, retinol, ferritin, vitamin B- 12, folate and riboflavin status were measured at baseline {{and at the end of}} the study. Plasma zinc and serum transferrin receptors also were measured at study end. A total of 145 children in the EXP group and 118 in the CON group completed the trial. Using multivariate analysis, the changes in mid-upper arm circumference, weight for age and total weight were significantly better in the EXP group than in the CON group (P 0. 01). Ferritin, riboflavin and folate status were significantly better in the EXP group than in the CON group at study end (P 0. 01), but serum vitamin B- 12 was not. Zinc was significantly higher and transferrin receptors were significantly lower at the conclusion of the study in the EXP group than in the CON group (P 0. 001).

40|$|AbstractGossypol, a {{naturally}} occurring terpenoid found in pigment glands located throughout the cotton plant, {{is an effective}} insect deterrent, but is also a cumulative toxin in simple-stomached animals. Plant biotechnology utilizing RNAi was {{used to create a}} plant that has no gossypol in the seed while retaining gossypol in all other plant tissues to prevent predation. Since cotton is drought and heat tolerant, it is well suited to serve as a source of both food and fiber as climate change puts other crops in jeopardy. Agrobacterium transformation was used to insert into the cotton nuclear genome a construct containing a seed specific promoter driving an RNAi hairpin that suppresses delta-cadinene synthase. This enzyme plays a critical role early in building gossypol. This biotechnology-based proof of concept provides strong evidence {{that it is possible to}} produce a plant that retains its natural defense mechanism in the non-seed tissues while producing a drought and heat tolerant source of protein in the gossypol-free cottonseed. The presence of Gossypol in cotton seed means all the protein produced by the cotton plant is relegated to ruminant feed and (in miniscule amounts) aquacultre. Recent research demonstrates 100 % replacement of fishmeal with Ultra-Low Gossypol Cottonseed (ULGCS) in the feeds of several aquaculture species without a decrease in performance. Each year about 10 - 11 million metric tons of cottonseed protein are produced worldwide. Without gossypol, this is enough protein to satisfy the daily, basic protein needs (50 grams/person) of more than 600 million people for one year.

40|$|Iron {{deficiency}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} frequent micronutrient deficiencies around the world. Low iron bioavailability simultaneously with a high iron requirement is a high risk factor for developing iron deficiency. Probiotics are microorganisms that confer a health benefit on the host. Prebiotics are oligosaccharides which provide a health benefit on the host due to a positive modulation of the microflora in the gut. The aim of this paper is to evaluate if there is a connection between pro-and/or prebiotics and iron bioavailability. A literature review of studies published within the last ten years was done together with information from the organizations WHO, FAO and EFSA. In the literature search, only four, published, human studies investigating the correlation between probiotics and iron bioavailability was found. Since the properties of probiotics always are strain specific studies done on different strains cannot be summarized in one conclusion. Lactobacillus plantarum 299 v is a probiotic strain proposed to give enhanced iron absorption. An improvement of iron absorption was observed when the strain was added to a phytate rich meal. Trials with longer intervention periods are needed to assess the strain’s impact on iron absorption. Addition of Lactobacillus acidophilus to an iron <b>fortified</b> <b>beverage</b> did not improve iron status among children. Contrary, a decreased risk of developing iron deficiency anemia was observed when Bifidobacterium lactis HN 019 and prebiotic oligosaccharides were added to an iron-fortified beverage. The positive outcome can be an act of the pro- or the prebiotic or a collaboration of both. The hypothesis that prebiotics can improve iron bioavailability, can unfortunately not be proven since there are not many human studies done to support the theory. Nevertheless there are four plausible biological mechanisms behind the hypothesis. The fermentation products, the short chain fatty acids, SCFA can release iron from complexes by a lowering of the pH, furthermore SCFA can enlarge the absorption area by stimulate the epithelial cells to proliferate. Prebiotics can give a reducing environment where iron can be reduced to the more soluble ferrous form. Additionally prebiotics can give an up regulation of the genes encoding for iron transporters and receptors. Studies performed on pigs indicate a positive outcome of prebiotic inulin on iron status. Additional human studies are required to support this result. Conclusion: The relationship between pro- and/or prebiotics and improved bioavailability of iron requires further human studies to be confirmed...|$|E
40|$|Anaemia was {{investigated}} in a rural Tanzanian community to determine its magnitude and causative factors in different population groups. Nutritional anaemia resulting mainly from a diet with a low bioavailability of iron affected {{more than half of}} the total number of women and children. As in many developing countries, a high consumption of cereals and a vegetable-based diet known to contain phytate, an inhibitor of iron absorption, was common. Household dietary surveys showed that maize, sorghum, millets, peas, beans, nuts and green leafy vegetables made up 80 % of the major sources of dietary iron. This thesis reports on studies of the long-term effects of iron intake from foods in the study area, effects of low dietary iron bioavailability and effects of interventions using a multiple micronutrient beverage on anaemia status in children and pregnant women. In the nutritional survey conducted in a multistage cluster sampling design, 80 % of preschool children (aged 125 µmol/mol haem or serum ferritin Mean dietary iron intake was found to be significantly (p in vitro) from composite meals was very low (A randomised, placebo-controlled efficacy trial with a beverage containing iron, iodine, vitamin A, vitamin C, zinc, riboflavin, niacin, folate, vitamin B 12, vitamin B 6 and vitamin E at physiological doses increased the haemoglobin concentration by 9. 2 g/L in anaemic children and by 8. 6 g/L in pregnant women after a supplementation period of six and two months respectively. The risk for anaemia in the study subjects taking the <b>fortified</b> <b>beverage</b> was reduced by 20 % in children and 50 % in pregnant women (RR= 0. 79 and 0. 49 respectively).

40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertsation. Major: Food science. Advisor: Baraem Ismail. 1 coputer file (PDF); xi, 115 pages, {{appendices}} A-E. Whey protein has numerous nutritional, {{physiological and}} functional benefits. It {{is therefore a}} perfect candidate for high protein beverage applications. Whey protein beverages are gaining popularity among athletes, bodybuilders and health conscientious individuals. In spite of the reasonable solubility of whey proteins in acidic beverages (pH 3. 4 - 4. 5), thermal processing and prolonged ambient storage can result in protein aggregation via hydrophobic and disulfide molecular interactions between denatured proteins, especially at relatively high protein concentration (> 4. 2 %, w/v). Currently, whey protein acidic beverages available in the market contain at most 4 % whey protein. To better deliver the nutritional quality and expand the commercial value, it is desirable to develop shelf stable high whey protein acidic beverages (> 4. 2 % protein). It is also desirable to produce a less acidic beverage, to reduce undesirable sourness and astringency. We hypothesized that glycosylation of whey protein via early stage Maillard reaction results in higher net charge, enhanced thermal stability, increased structural rigidity, and reduced buffering capacity. Partially glycosylated whey protein (PGWP) can thus be used to produce high protein acidic beverages that are shelf stable with acceptable sensory quality. Therefore, our long term goal was to produce a partially glycosylated whey protein with enhanced solubility and thermal stability over a wide pH range, while maintaining nutritional and sensory quality. Glycosylation conditions were optimized to promote glycosylation of whey protein, while minimizing browning and maintaining nutritional quality. Unreacted dextran was removed using liquid chromatography, and the protein fractions, both non-reacted protein and glycosylated protein were collected and labeled as PGWP. Extent of glycosylation, browning, % lysine blockage, % loss in free amine, and in-vitro digestibility were monitored. Solubility and thermal stability of PGWP were compared to whey protein isolate (WPI), at 5 - 10 % (w/v) protein concentration, pH 3. 4, 4. 5, 5. 5 and/or 7. 0, and pre and post thermal treatments. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and SDS-PAGE were employed to monitor onset of denaturation and polymerization, respectively. Exposure of sulfhydryl groups and surface hydrophobicity were monitored during heat treatment of 5 % protein solutions at 75 °C for 60 min. The pI of PGWP was as well. For structural characterization mass spectrometry (MS) analysis and surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) were used. The glycosylation site was determined using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight MS (MALDI-TOF MS). Solutions (5 % protein, w/v) of WPI and PGWP were analyzed by SERS to determine secondary and tertiary structural changes of the protein as affected by glycosylation, pH and heating. The sourness and astringency of protein acidic solutions/beverages formulated with PGWP and WPI at 5 % protein and at different pHs were determined. The storage stability of the formulated solutions/beverages over 6 - 8 weeks was determined, by measuring solubility, turbidity, and protein aggregation using capillary electrophoresis (EC). Overall, results proved that the solubility and thermal stability of whey protein, at relative high protein concentrations, can be enhanced over {{a broad range of}} pH upon partial and limited Maillard-induced glycosylation. The enhanced solubility and thermal stability of PGWP was attributed to structural rigidity, unique glycosylation sites, resistance to denaturation, and shift to a more acidic pI, all of which contributed to reduced protein/protein interactions. The nutritional quality was maintained and advanced stages of Maillard reaction were not detected. Partial glycosylation of whey protein reduced its buffering capacity, and consequently less amount of acid was required to reach the targeted pH of the protein fortified solution/beverage. The reduced acidity of the PGWP <b>fortified</b> <b>beverages,</b> especially at pH 4, resulted in lower perceived sourness and astringency compared to the WPI <b>fortified</b> <b>beverages.</b> In addition, the solubility and turbidity of PGWP solution prepared at pH 4. 5 were maintained fairly well during storage at or below 25 °C. Our findings demonstrate the possibility of using PGWP in the production of shelf stable high protein acidic beverages (> 4. 2 % protein) that can be less sour and astringent than what is currently present in the market. Our results also provided information that is essential to understand the structure/function relationship upon Maillard-induced glycosylation of whey proteins. This basic information is useful for directed structural modification research aiming at improving whey protein functionality...|$|R

40|$|University of Minnesota M. S. thesis. August 2011. Major: Food science. Advisors: Baraem Ismail and Zata M. Vickers. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xiii, 117 pages, appendices A-L. Protein solubility affects {{the quality of}} many food products, especially high-protein beverages (> 4. 2 % protein). Beverages formulated with soy protein at > 4. 2 % protein content are currently unavailable in the market due to thermal challenges affecting the protein solubility and also due to flavor challenges. Enzyme hydrolysis of soy protein may lead to enhanced solubility and thermal stability. However, bitter taste caused by hydrolyzing soy protein is a limiting factor to using SPH in food applications. Therefore, controlled and limited hydrolysis of 2 - 8 % is required to minimize the production of bitter peptides. Another advantage of controlled hydrolysis of soy protein is the release of bioactive peptides. Among the many physiological benefits of bioactive peptides, antihypertensive activity has gained much attention. Therefore the objectives of this work were 1) to optimize hydrolysis conditions of soy protein for enhanced solubility, thermal stability and bioactivity, while maintaining low degree of hydrolysis (DH); and 2) to determine the sensory acceptability of lemon flavored iced tea beverages formulated with soy protein hydrolysate at various concentrations. Soy protein isolate (SPI) was hydrolyzed by papain, bromelain, trypsin, and alcalase at various enzyme levels while keeping other hydrolysis conditions constant. Enzymatic activities were optimized based on DH measurements. Degree of hydrolysis (DH) was measured using O-phthaldialdehyde method. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis to monitor enzyme selectivity. ACE inhibitory activity was measured using a standardized assay. For determination of solubility and thermal stability, solutions (5 % w/v) of hydrolysates and SPI were subjected to heat treatment at 95 °C for 60 min followed by centrifugation and determination of protein content in the supernatant using a nitrogen analyzer. Solubility and thermal stability at different protein concentrations (1 %, 2. 5 %, 5 %, and 7 %) in a black tea beverage were also measured. Alcalase-hydrolyzed SPI was chosen for the sensory study as it had the highest solubility, thermal stability, and antihypertensive activity among the hydrolysates. Nine formulations were prepared, including a control which was a tea with no added protein and the four different protein concentrations containing either SPI or alcalase-hydrolyzed SPI. One-hundred-one subjects rated overall liking, flavor, aroma, appearance, and mouthfeel on an 11 -point hedonic scale and rated intensity of bitterness and off flavor on a line scale. Hydrolysates produced using 2. 654 GDU of bromelain, 0. 012 AU-A of alcalase, 19, 680 USP units of papain, and 235, 000 U of trypsin had DH of 3. 98 %, 3. 57 %, 6. 77 %, and 2. 60 %, respectively, thus were selected for further experiments. Use of different enzymes resulted in distinctive differences in hydrolysis patterns. Among the four produced hydrolysates, alcalase-hydrolyzed SPI was highly soluble (75. 25 %) at relatively high protein concentrations, thermally stable, and possessed the most pronounced antihypertensive activity (IC 50 = 0. 263 mg protein/ mL). Lemon flavored iced tea <b>beverages</b> <b>fortified</b> with alcalase-hydrolyzed SPI at various protein concentrations (1 up to 7 % protein) {{were found to be}} acceptable. The beverages formulated with the hydrolysate at 1 %, 2. 5 %, and 5 % protein content were liked as much as those without added protein. Beverages formulated with up to 5 % hydrolysate also had significantly less bitter taste and off flavors than SPI beverages. These findings can be utilized in the development of high protein <b>fortified</b> <b>beverages,</b> which is acceptable with relatively low bitter taste and noted physiological benefits...|$|R

Waterbased <b>beverages</b> <b>fortified</b> with minerals have made a new connection between the medical and food sciences. Functional beverages include a wide variety of products in the market. They are mainly fortified to be a substitution for what is lost in current diets. However, consumers never scarify tastes for health means, and their expectations of beverage functions depend on cultural differences across the world. In the current study, water-based beverage fortifications have been reviewed and substantiated with scientific data collected from published papers to show the value of adding fortified water with a range of functional ingredients including minerals from the individual and public points of view. Addition of various minerals has also been demonstrated to help establish a beverage market, which can satisfy consumers in any country...|$|R
40|$|Background: During 2005, the Chilean Ministry of Health {{included}} a <b>fortified</b> milk <b>beverage</b> to the Elderly Food Supplementation Program, {{to improve the}} compliance with the program and to increase the provision of micronutrients. This beverage was added to a soup that was distributed since 1999. Aim: To evaluate the long term acceptability, tolerance and consumption of the Milk Beverage and analyze the nutritional contribution of the products provided by the supplementation program to the usual diet of the elderly. Material and methods: One hundred twenty five elderly subjects, aged 77 ± 4 (52 males) living in Metropolitan Santiago, aged over 70 years, beneficiaries of the food supplementation program, were interviewed. The acceptability, consumption and tolerance of the Milk Beverage were evaluated by specially designed surveys. The contribution of the food suplementation products to daily nutrient intake was also analyzed by 24 hours dietary recalls. Results: The mean body mass index of the interviewed elderly subjects was 27. 0 ± 4. 5 Kg/m². Monthly delivery of the products included in the program increased significantly after the incorporation of the Milk Beverage to the program. The milk beverage had a significantly higher daily consumption and a lower family dilution than the soup. The consumption of supplementation products increased significantly the daily intake of energy and most micronutrients. Noteworthy {{was the case for}} vitamin B 12, C, E and zinc, whose intake doubled (p < 0. 01). Conclusions: The Milk Beverage had an excellent approval and consumption rate.

40|$|A whey protein <b>fortified</b> orange <b>beverage</b> was {{developed}} for the Japanese market {{as a result of}} this project. Whey protein concentrates are unique protein ingredients with high nutritional values and varied functionality. They are produced in New Zealand in increasing quantities and, as they are not fully utilised in Japan, the Japanese market is seen as a major potential outlet. Product idea generation techniques were used to create a range of 66 new product ideas for the Japanese market, incorporating whey protein concentrates. After screening, the most promising new product idea was a protein enriched orange juice. The concept of a health food drink enriched with whey protein and vitamin C {{was developed}}. Functionality of the whey proteins in whey protein concentrates (WPC) was studied in a model orange juice system. High protein WPCs were more stable than low protein WPCs in view of serum formation. However, both high and low protein WPCs needed citric acid/sodium citrate to prevent serum formation on storage. Pectin had to be added to give enough heat stability so that the drink could be UHT processed. A pH less than 4 was necessary to give enough sourness to the drink and also for heat stability. Sulphuric WPC gave a more acceptable flavour in the final drink than lactic WPC. Two market trials and storage tests were carried out on the drinks from the pilot scale production runs. The first trial indicated a need for flavour and colour improvements, which led to the second trial. From the results of the second trial, some minor reformulation to improve the flavour and the viscosity of the drink is still required. None the less, the product has a considerable market potential for utilizing the whey protein concentrate, in the order of 600 tonnes/year...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages [37]- 39) This {{study examined}} the effectiveness of using fortified menu items served with the meals instead of liquid supplements between meals in a long-term care setting. Data was collected from the medical records of 30 residents. The {{mean age of the}} sample was 81. 6 years. Subjects included in the study had been on highprotein supplements primarily in the form of liquid milk shakes. The subjects were started on a fortified food program identified as a Food Instead of Supplement (FIS) program and monitored for three months. Weight, calorie, and protein intakes were used to measure changes in nutritional status. Outcomes related to nutritional status such as functional ability and the presence of decubitus ulcers were also monitored for changes. Student t-tests, Wilcoxon's rank sum, and Wilcoxon's signed-rank test were use for the statistical analysis. Statistics, including means and standard deviations, were completed using the SAS statistical package. The analysis indicated a statistically significant increase in weight and protein intake {{with the use of the}} FIS program. Because of the small number of subjects with decubitus ulcers, statistics were not completed regarding the presence of decubitus ulcers. However, the number of subjects with decubitus ulcers was noted to have dropped with the use of the FIS program. Changes in calorie intake and functional ability were not found to be statistically significant. The results of this study indicate the FIS program was an effective method to promote weight gain in a longterm care setting. Recommendations that may improve the outcomes regarding the use of such a program include the use of <b>fortified</b> hot <b>beverages</b> with meals and offering calorie-rich and protein-rich bread items, as opposed to offering honey-butter with wheat bread.

40|$|Nutrition {{offers the}} means to improve health and {{well-being}} and among the predictive factors of successful aging, nutrition appears {{as one of the}} major determinants. Whereas adequate nutrition {{plays a major role in}} a healthy lifestyle that maintains bodily and mental functioning, inadequate nutrition contributes to a loss of function and to the development and progression of disease. At the moment recommended dietary allowance (RDA) is established to cover the needs of populations of the healthy elderly. In the future special recommendations for subgroups of individuals are essential, taking into account individual health status and genetic factors. Nutrient guidelines for elderly are basically the same as for young adults, propagating a balanced varied nutrition that is rich in complex carbohydrate sources, fruits and vegetables providing fiber, antioxidant and functional nutrients, fish providing vitamin D and essential fatty acids, adequate water supply in view of their potentially impaired thirst perception and reduced renal functions. Finally a balanced diet is the best way to avoid deficiencies and maintain health. If in subgroups of the elderly population an adequate nutrition cannot be achieved, low dose dietary supplements and/or <b>fortified</b> foods and <b>beverages</b> can contribute to improve nutrient intake...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In {{the present}} study, rice and millet grains were {{fermented}} with ABT- 2 starter culture (S. thermophilus L. acidophilus and Bifidobacterium BB- 12) to obtain probiotic <b>beverages,</b> <b>fortified</b> with pumpkin and sesame seed milk {{in order to}} combine the high nutritive value of seeds and {{the health benefits of}} the probiotic culture. The levels of several factors, i. e. starter culture concentration, rice and millet level and the amount of honey, affecting the fermentation process, were established for completing a controlled fermentation for 16 hours. 9 The viable cell counts reached at the end of fermentation time about 4. 3 x 10 cfu/ml. Changes were observed in acidity and counts of probiotic bacteria as a result of fortification with pumpkin and sesame milk at 10 %. Sensory properties were also evaluated. Fermentation with ABT- 2 starter culture improved the color, flavor, texture and overall acceptability of the beverages. Slight changes in the count of probiotic, pH and acidity during storage of the beverages at 4 °C were observed. The shelf-life of the rice and millet fermented beverages was estimated to be 15 days under refrigerated storage...|$|R
40|$|Identified as a {{trend that}} will {{transform}} {{health care in the}} 21 " century (Bartlett 1999), the emergence and increased use of alternative health care have potentially dramatic implications for rural pharmacies. Alternative therapies include herbal medicine, massage, megavitamins, folk remedies, energy healing, acupuncture, homeopathy, and a variety of foods and <b>beverages</b> <b>fortified</b> with ingredients that promise a health or medical benefit. Increased usage suggests that providers, including pharmacists, may treat patients without full information, leading to potentially negative outcomes. A reasonable hypothesis is that the use of these alternatives is higher in rural areas due to generally poorer access to traditional health care providers. For pharmacies, increased use may potentially have both negative and positive consequences. This research examines the perspectives of pharmacists practicing in rural communities regarding the opportunities and threats associated with the increased use of alternative therapies. METHOD Surveys were mailed to all active, licensed Division I pharmacies in the 74 Illinois rural counties (list provided by the Illinois Department of Professional Regulation), along with a cover letter from the president of the Illinois Pharmacists Association. Of the 429 surveys mailed, 159 (37 percent) were returned with complete information...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MTech (Food Technology)) [...] Cape Peninsula University of Technology, 2016. In South Africa {{malnutrition}} exists due to inadequate {{dietary intake}} of micronutrients {{which is one}} of the major causes of vitamin deficiencies leading to disease. The treatment of malnutrition over the past years has been a considerable burden on the South African economy. Therefore, food fortification is one of the current strategies used to minimize malnutrition by increasing the nutritional value of staple foods. Commercial dairy products and pharmaceutical nutritional products (food supplements) in South Africa have been developed and produced for affluent consumers. Hence the need to develop an affordable fortified dairy product for the majority of South Africans prompted this study aimed at using a “naturally” <b>fortified</b> kefir <b>beverage</b> with vitamin B 12 and folate to increase B-vitamins levels. Since Propionibacterium freudenreichii and Streptococcus thermophilus are known to be good producers of vitamin B 12 and folate, respectively, and propionibacteria has the ability to grow symbiotically in the presence of lactic acid bacteria, the inclusion of these organisms with the kefir grains was an achievable objective. In order to conduct the analysis of vitamin B 12 and folate in the samples, sample extraction and HPLC assay techniques were developed. The extraction of vitamin B 12 and folate were achieved by using KCN extraction buffer and the trienzymatic method, respectively. The samples were also subjected to purification and concentration using solid phase extraction for optimum results. All standards and samples were flushed with nitrogen gas and stored for a maximum of 2 weeks at – 20 °C to prevent B-vitamin deterioration. The HPLC assembly for the vitamin B 12 analysis included a Luna C 18 column and a diode array detector (DAD) for the detection and quantification. For the folate analysis it included a Zorbax SB-C 18 and Luna C 18 columns in tandem and the fluorescence detector (FLD) was used for the detection and quantification of THF, 5 -CH 3 -THF and 5 -CHO-THF, while the DAD was used for PGA and pteroyltri-γ-L-glutamic acid concentration in the samples...|$|R
40|$|Benzodiazepines (BDZs) {{are widely}} used as tranquilizers and antidepressive drugs in common {{clinical}} practice. However, their ready availability and their synergistic effects with alcohol make them attractive for criminal intentions. To prove criminal action for legal reasons, it is often necessary to analyze beverage residues from a crime scene. Milk-based alcoholic drinks (whiskey creams) are gaining popularity due to their lower alcohol content pleasant taste. However, the complexity of this sample, containing proteins and fatty acids, can mask the presence of drugs or other substances in standard analysis methods. These characteristics make whiskey creams highly suitable for illicit purposes. In this study, eight BDZs, including diazepam, chlordiazepoxide, clobazam, flunitrazepam, bromazepam, flurazepam, nitrazepam and clonazepam, were extracted from whiskey cream using the Quick, Easy, Cheap, Effective, Rugged and Safe (QuEChERS) method and analyzed using GC–MS. The QuEChERS protocol can efficiently separate most of the matrix from the target compounds while maintaining acceptable recoveries. The presented method is simple and rapid and has been validated in terms of precision, accuracy and recoveries.

40|$|SummaryHuman {{bitter taste}} is {{mediated}} by the hTAS 2 R family of G protein-coupled receptors [1 – 4]. The discovery of the hTAS 2 Rs enables the potential to develop specific bitter receptor antagonists that could be beneficial as chemical probes to examine the role of bitter receptor function in gustatory and nongustatory tissues. In addition, they could have widespread utility in food and <b>beverages</b> <b>fortified</b> with vitamins, antioxidants, and other nutraceuticals, because many of these have unwanted bitter aftertastes. We employed a high-throughput screening approach to discover a novel bitter receptor antagonist (GIV 3727) that inhibits activation of hTAS 2 R 31 (formerly hTAS 2 R 44) by saccharin and acesulfame K, two common artificial sweeteners. Pharmacological analyses revealed that GIV 3727 likely acts as an orthosteric, insurmountable antagonist of hTAS 2 R 31. Surprisingly, {{we also found that}} this compound could inhibit five additional hTAS 2 Rs, including the closely related receptor hTAS 2 R 43. Molecular modeling and site-directed mutagenesis studies suggest that two residues in helix 7 are important for antagonist activity in hTAS 2 R 31 and hTAS 2 R 43. In human sensory trials, GIV 3727 significantly reduced the bitterness associated with the two sulfonamide sweeteners, indicating that hTAS 2 R antagonists are active in vivo. Our results demonstrate that small molecule bitter receptor antagonists can effectively reduce the bitter taste qualities of foods, beverages, and pharmaceuticals...|$|R

Little {{is known about the}} effects of combined consumption of micronutrients and sugar on growth and cognitive function. The aim of this thesis was to 1) investigate the effects of micronutrients and sugar, alone and in combination, in a beverage, on growth and cognition in South African children and 2) review recent evidence on iron status and anaemia prevalence in South African children since the National Food Consumption Survey-Fortification Baseline- 2005 (NFCS-FB- 2005). Children (n = 408, 6 − 11 years) were randomly allocated to a beverage containing 1) micronutrients with sugar, 2) micronutrients with non-nutritive sweetener, 3) no micronutrients with sugar, or 4) no micronutrients with non-nutritive sweetener for 8. 5 months. Cognition was assessed using sub-tests from the Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children-II. Growth was assessed as weight-for-age (WAZ), height-for-age and body-mass-index-for-age z-scores. Relevant internet search engines identified studies reporting iron status of South African children after 2005. Secondary analysis was conducted on NFCS-FB- 2005 provincial data for children 7 − 9 years old. Positive intervention effects were observed for micronutrients (0. 76; 95 % CI: 0. 10, 1. 42) and sugar (0. 71; 95 % CI: 0. 05, 1. 37) on Atlantis (measure learning ability), and sugar on Rover (measure simultaneous processing) (0. 72; 96 % CI: 0. 08, 1. 35) test scores. Attenuating micronutrient x sugar interactions were observed on Atlantis, Number Recall (measure sequential processing) and Rover test performance. Micronutrients or sugar alone lowered WAZ. In combination, this effect was attenuated (significant micronutrient x sugar interaction). Four studies from four different provinces were identified. All reported lower anaemia prevalence than the NFCS-FB- 2005 (KwaZulu-Natal (11. 5 % vs 14. 4 %), North West (6. 9 % vs 27 %) Western Cape (17. 2 % vs 18. 8 %) and Northern Cape (5. 4 % vs 22. 2 %). A <b>beverage</b> <b>fortified</b> with micronutrients or added sugar had beneficial effects on cognition, but a lowering effect on WAZ in the children.

40|$|Thesis (M. Sc (Dietetics)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2011. AIM Poor {{iron status}} and under–nutrition among {{children}} are of concern {{not only in}} South Africa but worldwide. Both independent and combined associations between poor iron status, under–nutrition and cognitive development and function have been investigated. This mini–dissertation investigated possible associations between iron status indicators, anthropometric nutritional status and cognitive performance in the <b>Beverage</b> <b>Fortified</b> with Micronutrients (BeForMi) study population (black South African children aged 6 – 11 years in the North–West province of South Africa). METHODS The study was cross–sectional {{and based on the}} BeForMi study baseline data. Primary school children (n = 414) with the highest serum transferrin receptor (STR) and zinc protoporphyrin (ZnPP) levels were included. Anthropometric z–scores - BMI–for–age (BAZ), height–for–age (HAZ), and weight–for–age (WAZ) - and iron status indicators - haemoglobin (Hb), serum ferritin (SF), STR and ZnPP - were determined. The Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children, Second edition (KABC–II) was used to generate cognitive scores. RESULTS Fourteen percent of children were underweight (WAZ <= 2 SDs), 12. 8 % stunted (HAZ <= 2 SDs) and 8. 4 % wasted (BAZ <= 2 SDs). Of the children, 7. 1 % were anaemic (Hb < 11. 5 g/dL), 13 % iron depleted (Hb < 11. 5 g/dL and SF < 12 ug/L) and 2. 7 % had iron deficiency anaemia (Hb < 11. 5 g/dL and SF < 12 ug/L). Low iron stores (SF < 12 ug/L) were observed in 15. 7 % of the children. Positive correlations were found between SF and WAZ (r = 0. 1, p = 0. 047), Hb and HAZ (r = 0. 13, p = 0. 007) and WAZ (r = 0. 13, p = 0. 009). Positive correlations with small effect sizes were observed between some cognitive scores and z–scores (p < 0. 05, r–value range 0. 10 – 0. 24). Negative correlations with small effect sizes were observed for the subtests Triangles and Rover (both subtests on simultaneous processing) with Hb (p = 0. 008, r = – 0. 13) and SF (p = 0. 04, r = – 0. 1) respectively. Higher HAZ, WAZ and education level of the head of household were all significantly associated with the likelihood that a child would fall within the upper quartile of Hb values in our study group (p = 0. 036, p = 0. 032 and p = 0. 036 respectively). CONCLUSION The results suggested that under–nutrition was positively associated with poor iron status and lower cognitive scores in this study population. Further research, investigating specific effects of poor iron status at different stages of growth and the relationship with cognitive function later in life may help explain the negative correlations observed between current iron status indicators and cognitive scores.
