50|$|The Brunswick Street {{elevation}} is four storeys {{high and}} is constructed of rendered and painted masonry. There are thirteen windows on each floor, arranged in vertical panels between flat pilasters and becoming successively less decorated. The first floor windows are casements with semi-circular fanlights and distinctive projecting arched hoods. The {{second and third}} floor windows consist of pairs of rectangular sash windows with decorative moulding below the sill and around the <b>frame.</b> <b>Moulded</b> triangular pediments top the second floor windows. The top of each pilaster consists of a shamrock crest, positioned directly below a dentilled cornice.|$|R

The arched sandstone doorway is 1.64 m above ground level and is <b>framed</b> by <b>moulding.</b> The bell-storey has four lintelled windows facing the cardinal directions. The cap is gone but battlements remain.|$|R
2500|$|The cornice is {{a narrow}} jutting band of complex {{moulding}} which overhangs and protects the ornamented frieze, like {{the edge of}} an overhanging wooden-framed roof. It is decorated on the underside with projecting blocks, mutules, further suggesting the wooden nature of the prototype. At either end of the building the pediment rises from the cornice, <b>framed</b> by <b>moulding</b> of [...] similar form.|$|R
5000|$|With the Trojan {{takeover}} the Mk III {{was introduced}} in 1962 and was sold as a complete car. On the home market a complete car cost £965 or the kit version £716. The chassis was now a box <b>frame</b> <b>moulded</b> into the body. Triumph {{rack and pinion steering}} and front suspension was standardised. A closed coupé body was also available with either a reverse slope Ford Anglia-type rear window or a fastback. In autumn 1962: [...] "Elva Courier Mk IV was shown at London Show. New coupe has all-independent suspension, fiberglass body, MG engine. Mk III Couriers were also shown. Though previously equipped with MG-A engines, new versions will be equipped with 1800cc MG-B engine." [...] Later the Ford Cortina GT unit was available. The final version, the fixed head coupé Mk IV T type used Lotus twin-cam engines with the body modified to give more interior room. It could be had with all independent suspension and four wheel disc brakes. 210 were made.|$|R

50|$|Lead {{frames are}} the metal {{structures}} inside a chip package that carry {{signals from the}} die to the outside. The die inside the package is typically glued to the lead frame, and then bond wires attach the die pads to the leads. In the last stage of the manufacturing process, the lead <b>frame</b> is <b>moulded</b> in a plastic case, {{and outside of the}} lead frame is cut-off, separating all leads.|$|R

50|$|The Dowley-Taylor House {{is set on}} {{the north}} side of Main Street, south of Worcester's {{downtown}} business district. It is a large two story rectangular block with a hip roof topped by an oversized cupola with a surrounding porch. Its front facade consists of a full height portico supported by Corinthian columns. The front door is centered on the five-bay facade, surrounded by sidelight and transom windows and topped by an elaborate entablature supported by pilasters. The building corners are pilastered, and the windows of the front are <b>framed</b> by <b>moulded</b> caps.|$|R
50|$|The Parsons Homestead {{stands in}} the village center of Rye, on the {{southeast}} side of Washington Road, nearly opposite its junction with Lang Road. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a side gable roof and clapboarded exterior. It has two interior brick chimneys, and a five-bay front facade. The central bay is a two-story gabled projection, a distinctive local variant of the Federal style that is now seen {{in only a few}} surviving examples. The main entrance is {{at the base of the}} projection, flanked by sidelight windows and topped by a half-round transom. Sash windows are placed in the other bays, <b>framed</b> by <b>moulded</b> surrounds.|$|R
50|$|Steel, wood, GRP, {{and other}} {{materials}} are used as mould materials for prototyping purposes. The mould can be a male or female mould. To make shower bathtubs, a male mould is used. In the boating industry, a single-sided female mould made from FRP (fibre-reinforced plastic) is used to make yacht hulls. The outer shell of the mould is stiffened by a wood <b>frame.</b> The <b>mould</b> is made by taking the reversal of a male pattern. Several different hull sizes can be made using the same mould. The length of the mould is shortened or lengthened using inserts and mould secondaries such as windows, air vents, and propeller shaft tunnels.|$|R
5000|$|Business boomed {{and in the}} 1880s {{the company}} bought six new Linotype {{machines}} to replace the out-dated presses. Type was then set up as a page in wooden <b>frames,</b> from which <b>moulds</b> of papier-mâché were made. These were used to make stereotype plates, which were lowered by hoist to the ground floor. Here they were fitted to the ‘Victory’ rotary presses ready for printing.|$|R
50|$|The {{windows in}} the body of the church are casements with trefoil heads in <b>moulded</b> <b>frames</b> and are set with clear glass, but a group of seven above the altar are set with stained glass {{depicting}} Christ and the saints Paul, Mary, John, and Barnabus. The baptistery beyond an arch at the southern end of the building is lit by modern stained glass windows.|$|R

50|$|The Charles Baker House {{is located}} one block {{east of the}} former Waltham Watch Company factory, at the {{northwest}} corner of Adams and Cherry Streets. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure with a cross-gable roof and clapboarded exterior. A gable end faces Adams Street, two bays wide, with a projecting single-story bay window in the left bay, its roof eave with small wooden brackets. The main roof has brackets at the corners, and Stick style woodwork in not just the main gable, but in the gables of smaller roof dormers and the projecting side gables. Single-story porches with spindled valances flank the Adams Street facade. Most windows are <b>framed</b> by <b>moulding</b> with shallow cornices above and tab feet below the sill.|$|R
50|$|The {{centre bay}} to Derby Street is {{narrower}} than the centre bay to East Street, however both are detailed {{in a similar}} manner, with gablets to the cornice framing the ground floor entrance, a vertical moulding separating the sash windows to the first floor, and an arch <b>moulding</b> <b>framing</b> low sash windows to the second floor. The ground floor is the tallest, and the second floor the shortest of the three floors.|$|R
50|$|Palazzo Falson {{was built}} during Malta’s medieval {{period in the}} 13th century, over {{the remains of a}} {{defensive}} structure called La Rocca. Changes to the façade, including a shift in the orientation of the building as well as the addition of a double serrated string course separating the two storeys and the hood <b>mould</b> <b>framing</b> the main doorway, were also completed in the 15th century. These features are typical of the Siculo-Norman style, prevalent in the period.|$|R
50|$|The House at 173-175 Ward Street in Newton, Massachusetts, {{is one of}} the city's few Federal style houses. Built c. 1800, it is a 2-1/2 story wood frame {{structure}} with clapboard siding, and twin rear wall chimneys. The house has a five bay facade with windows <b>framed</b> by narrow <b>moulding.</b> The main entrance is flanked by paired pilasters surrounding sidelight windows, topped by an entablature. The house was built by Charles Hyde, and was involved in property disputes attending the construction of tunnels in the area in the mid-19th century.|$|R
50|$|It was Levi {{who first}} reconstructed the machine needed to {{recreate}} the black ripple <b>moulding</b> <b>frames</b> for reframing of Dutch 17th-century paintings. One of Levi's greatest successes after his retirement, and in collaboration with William Adair, was {{the identification of the}} 11 paintings needed to reassemble Filippo Mazzola’s polyptych that formed the altarpiece in the church of S Maria delle Grazie at Cortemaggiore. Levi had purchased the frame in 1967 and his role in and generosity in donating it were recognised in 2003 when he was awarded the rank of Cavaliere.|$|R
50|$|Manufacturers who mass-produce wood {{products}} use automated spray systems, {{allowing them to}} paint materials {{at a very high}} rate with a minimum of personnel. Automated spray systems usually incorporate a paint-saving system which recovers paint not applied to the products. Commonly, linear spray systems are for products which are lying flat on a conveyor belt and then fed into a linear spray system, where automated spray guns are stationed above. When the material is directly below the guns, the guns begin to paint the material. Materials consist of lineal parts usually less than 12 in wide, such as window <b>frames,</b> wood <b>moulding,</b> baseboard, casing, trim stock and any other material that is simple in design. These machines are commonly used to apply stain, sealer, and lacquer. They can apply water- or solvent-based coatings. In recent years ultraviolet-cured coatings have become commonplace in profile finishing, and there are machines particularly suited to this type of coating.|$|R

50|$|The former Madison District No. 1 School {{is located}} in the village center of Madison, {{on the north side of}} NH 113, just west of the Madison Elementary School. It is a single-story wood frame {{structure}} with a gabled roof, clapboarded exterior, and granite foundation. The building corners have simple pilasters, rising to entablatures running along the building sides. Its main facade faces south, and has two symmetrically placed entrances, each <b>framed</b> by simple <b>moulding</b> and topped by four-light transom windows. The interior has two small vestibules, which open into the single classroom. The walls are finished in painted wood.|$|R
60|$|Leaving home in {{the latter}} part of January (1832), with a Wordsworth for a pocket companion, Mr. Gladstone made his way to Oxford, where he laboured through his packing, settled accounts, 'heard a very able sermon indeed from Newman at St. Mary's,' took his bachelor's degree (Jan. 26), and after a day or two with {{relatives}} and friends in London, left England along with his brother John at the beginning of February. He did not return until the end of July. He visited Brussels, Paris, Florence, Naples, Rome, Venice, and Milan. Of this long journey he kept a full record, and it contains one entry of no small moment in his mental history. A conception now began to possess him, that according to one religious school kindled a saving illumination, and according to another threw something of a shade upon his future path. In either view it marked a change of spiritual course, a transformation not of religion as the centre of his being, for that it always was, but of the <b>frame</b> and <b>mould</b> within which religion was to expand.|$|R
60|$|These vagaries {{were of the}} {{spectral}} throng so apt to steal out of an unquiet heart. They partly ceased to haunt me, on my arriving at a point whence, through the trees, I began to catch glimpses of the Blithedale farm. That surely was something real. There was hardly a square foot of all those acres on which I had not trodden heavily, in one or another kind of toil. The curse of Adam's posterity--and, curse or blessing be it, it gives substance to the life around us--had first come upon me there. In the sweat of my brow I had there earned bread and eaten it, and so established my claim to be on earth, and my fellowship with all the sons of labor. I could have knelt down, and have laid my breast against that soil. The red clay of which my <b>frame</b> was <b>moulded</b> seemed nearer akin to those crumbling furrows than to any other portion of the world's dust. There was my home, and there might be my grave.|$|R
40|$|A {{numerical}} {{model for the}} three-dimensional simulation of liquid-gas flows with free surfaces is presented. The incompressible Navier-Stokes equations are assumed to hold in the liquid domain. In the gas domain, the velocity is disregarded, the pressure {{is supposed to be}} constant in each connected component of the gas domain and follows the ideal gas law. The gas pressure is imposed as a normal force on the liquid-gas interface. An implicit splitting scheme is used to decouple the physical phenomena. Given the gas pressure on the interface, the method described in [19, 20] is used to track the liquid domain and to compute the velocity and pressure fields in the liquid. Then the connected components of the gas domain are found using an original numbering algorithm. Finally the gas pressure is updated from the ideal gas law in each connected component of gas. The implementation is validated in the <b>frame</b> of <b>mould</b> filling. Numerical results in two and three space dimensions show that the effect of pressure in the bubbles of gas trapped by the liquid cannot be neglected...|$|R
50|$|Following Robert's {{successful}} model, {{built in}} 1798, Saint-Léger Didot insisted that Robert {{apply for a}} patent. Prior to 1798, paper was made one sheet at a time, by dipping a rectangular <b>frame</b> or <b>mould</b> with a screen bottom into a vat of pulp. The frame {{was removed from the}} vat, and the water was pressed out of the pulp. The remaining pulp was allowed to dry; the frame could not be re-used until the previous sheet of paper was removed from it. Robert's construction had a moving screen belt that would receive a continuous flow of stock and deliver an unbroken sheet of wet paper to a pair of squeeze rolls. As the continuous strip of wet paper came off the machine it was manually hung over a series of cables or bars to dry. With Didot's urging, Robert and Didot went to François de Neufchâteau, the Minister of the Interior and applied for a patent. In 1799, the patent (brevet d'invention) was granted by the French Government, for which Robert paid 8,000 francs.|$|R
60|$|Now {{this man}} Black {{is not easily}} described, for his was a curiously {{compound}} character. To a heart saturated with the milk of human kindness was united a will more inflexible, if possible, {{than that of a}} Mexican mule; a <b>frame</b> of Herculean <b>mould,</b> and a spirit in which profound gravity and reverence waged incessant warfare with a keen appreciation of the ludicrous. Peacefully inclined in disposition, with a tendency to believe well of all men, and somewhat free and easy in the formation of his opinions, he was very unwilling to resist authority; but the love of truth and justice was stronger within him than the love of peace.|$|R
50|$|The William Ingersoll Bowditch House {{stands in}} a {{residential}} area northeast of the commercial area of Brookline Village, {{on the east side}} of Toxteth Street near its southern end.

A single-story shed-roof porch is located in the crook of the L. The windows under the porch are of full length, and the main entrance, also under the porch, has flanking full-length sidelight windows. Window openings are <b>framed</b> by drip <b>moulding,</b> and the roof is adorned with dormers that have steeply pitched roofs in the Gothic style.|$|R
