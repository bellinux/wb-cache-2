5|$|In 2013, Mantle {{performed}} in the black comedy The Ladykillers, playing the part of Major Courtney. He was forced {{to withdraw from the}} touring production in March 2013 after he was attacked at the Travelodge hotel in Newcastle. On the night of Saturday 23 March, he became involved in a brawl after asking a group of fellow guests to keep the noise down, during which part of his right ear was bitten off. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> emergency surgery at the Royal Victoria Infirmary hospital to have it sewn back on. A 32-year-old man from Hamilton, South Lanarkshire was charged over the incident and appeared before a magistrate in April 2013, and another man was released on bail in connection to the incident; a third man has been released without charge. In June 2014 the two accused were found not guilty of all charges.|$|E
25|$|The use of X-rays {{for medical}} {{purposes}} (which developed {{into the field}} of radiation therapy) was pioneered by Major John Hall-Edwards in Birmingham, England.

50|$|Costner:To me, it's like {{picking a}} {{football}} team. The story made sense, {{to play the}} game made sense, and it was obvious that I should play quarterback or end. I mean, Cochran is a role that I should play... The movie needed Anthony Quinn more than it needed me. I mean, there are probably five or six guys who could play Cochran's role, but who else is there who could play the role of Tibbey? The Tiburon character <b>has</b> <b>to</b> be really charming and Anthony has that in spades. <b>He</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> danger and <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> presence. Anthony <b>has</b> that because <b>he's</b> been a leading man all his life. And <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> be that age.|$|R

25|$|While filming Cat Ballou in 1965, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> one of {{his legs}} amputated due to a serious infection, {{originally}} resulting from a minor scrape with a car door, and likely complicated with diabetes. Flippen finished his scenes in that film in great pain, and after the amputation he took {{a short period of}} recuperation and healing, then returned to work, from that period forward taking roles that did not hide his disability.|$|E
25|$|In August 1937 {{he went to}} Singapore under a fake Chinese {{identity}} and became a teacher. After the Dutch surrendered to Japan he returned to Indonesia via Penang. He then sailed to Sumatra arriving in Jakarta in mid-1942, where he wrote Madilog. After he felt <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a job, he applied to Social Welfare Agency and was soon sent to a coal mine in Bayah, on southern coast of West Java.|$|E
25|$|Somerset {{also saw}} action during the Hundred Days: {{he served on}} Wellington's staff at the Battle of Quatre Bras on 16 June 1815 and at the Battle of Waterloo two days later (where <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> his right arm amputated and then demanded his arm back so he could {{retrieve}} the ring {{that his wife had}} given him). Promoted to colonel and appointed an aide-de-camp to the Prince Regent on 28 August 1815, he was appointed a Knight of the Bavarian Military Order of Max Joseph on 3 October 1815.

25|$|After the Emperor's death, Prime Minister Li Si, who {{accompanied}} him, became extremely {{worried that the}} news of his death could trigger a general uprising in the Empire. It would take two months for the entourage to reach the capital, {{and it would not}} be possible to stop the uprising. Li Si decided to hide the death of the Emperor, and return to Xianyang. Most of the Imperial entourage accompanying the Emperor were left ignorant of the Emperor's death; only a younger son, Ying Huhai, who was travelling with his father, the eunuch Zhao Gao, Li Si, and five or six favourite eunuchs knew of the death. Li Si also ordered that two carts containing rotten fish be carried immediately before and after the wagon of the Emperor. The idea behind this was to prevent people from noticing the foul smell emanating from the wagon of the Emperor, where his body was starting to decompose severely as it was summertime. They also pulled down the shade so no one could see his face, changed his clothes daily, brought food and when <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> important conversations, they would act {{as if he wanted to}} send them a message.|$|E
25|$|Patrik Jensen and Jonas Björler had a {{discussion}} at Jonas' own 40th birthday party, as to not letting The Haunted disband, and when Jensen asked Björler {{as to who}} should be the new vocalist in the band, Björler could only think of former member, Marco Aro. A few days after, Jensen phoned Aro to rejoin The Haunted. Aro had missed being in the band and tempted to rejoin but at first was hesitant due hectic touring he had done with the band in the past, which Aro {{was not interested in}} doing, but The Haunted had done it for almost a decade straight after Aro left, getting all the touring out of them. More hesitation came when Aro struggled with drug addiction back then and with him {{to be back in the}} band again, he didn't want it to reoccur as it had also given him problems within his family, who he needed to discuss rejoining the band with also. Aro is also in the band The Resistance and didn't want to have conflicting schedules with both bands, so <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> {{a discussion}} with The Resistance as well. Aro had told Jensen he'd give him a response two weeks later. By then, the band had shown him the a breakdown of future tours, which interested Aro to rejoin The Haunted. Before publicly revealing information of the band's new lineup, Aro only stated there was good news coming from the band. His picture was in a silhouette on the band's official Facebook the day before the band announced a new line-up. Adrian Erlandsson, a former member, returned to the band also and Ola Englund from Six Feet Under was brought in as the band's new lead guitarist. The band then began writing for an EP titled Eye of the Storm which was released on 20 January 2014 in Europe and 21 January 2014 in North America. The band had also been rehearsing before the announcement of the new lineup to perform for the first time live with this lineup at the 70000 Tons of Metal which sat sail 27–31 January 2014.|$|E

500|$|In 1761, Boydell {{decided that}} he would attempt to trade with the French in kind—something they had refused in the past because of the poor quality of British engravings. To inaugurate this change, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a truly {{spectacular}} print. [...] To this end, he hired William Woollett, the foremost engraver in England, to engrave Richard Wilson's Destruction of the Children of Niobe. Woollett had already successfully engraved Claude Lorrain's 1663 painting The Father of Psyche Sacrificing at the Temple of Apollo for Boydell in 1760. Boydell paid him approximately £100 for the Niobe engraving, a staggering amount compared to the usual rates. [...] This single act of patronage raised engravers' fees throughout London. The print was wildly successful, but more importantly, the French accepted it as payment in kind. [...] In fact, it was the first British print actively desired on the Continent. By 1770, the British were exporting far more prints than they were importing, largely due to Boydell.|$|E
500|$|Upon {{return to}} No. 60 Squadron in France, Ball scored {{morning and evening}} {{victories}} on 15September, flying two different Nieuports. On the evening mission, he armed his aircraft with eight Le Prieur rockets, fitted to the outer struts and designed to fire electrically. He intended to use them on an observation balloon. As it happened, he spotted three German Roland C.IIs and broke their formation by salvoing his rockets at them, then picked {{off one of the}} pilots with machine-gun fire. After this he settled into an improved aeroplane, Nieuport 17 A213. He had it rigged to fly tail-heavy to facilitate his changing of ammunition drums in the machine-gun, and had a holster built into the cockpit for the Colt automatic pistol that he habitually carried. Three times during September he scored triple victories in a day, ending the month with his total score standing at 31, making him Britain's top-scoring ace. [...] By this time he had told his commanding officer that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a rest and that he was taking unnecessary risks because of his nerves. On 3October, he was sent on leave, en route to a posting at the Home Establishment in England. A French semi-official report of Ball's successes was issued the same day; it was picked up and repeated in the British aviation journal Flight nine days later.|$|E
500|$|This episode {{originated}} when Al Jean commented to Mike Reiss, [...] "We {{had a lot}} of {{luck with}} Homer stealing cable, which was based on the eighth commandment, so maybe we could look to other commandments. So we thought, 'Honor the Sabbath' would be a good one. So the 'Homer doesn't go to church' storyline was given to George Meyer." [...] Reiss and Jean thought that as a lapsed Catholic, Meyer would [...] "bring the proper degree of rage" [...] to the episode. Meyer {{had a lot of}} fun making the episode, thinking that most people could relate to the bliss of staying home from church. One of the main problems Meyer had writing this episode is that whenever Homer saw God, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> fallen asleep so that it appeared to be a dream. Meyer did not want to show that God was literally appearing to Homer. This resulted in him falling asleep so many times during the first draft of the episode that it was almost as if Homer had narcolepsy. This was also the first episode from season four that was read to the production team. Although first reads on previous seasons had not been well received by the production team, [...] "Homer the Heretic" [...] read very well, particularly some of the visuals in the third act, such as the house on fire and Homer being rescued by Flanders.|$|E

500|$|Brian Donlevy as Professor Bernard Quatermass: Donlevy reprised {{his role}} as the eponymous professor, much to the despair of Nigel Kneale, who had heavily criticised his {{interpretation}} of the role in The Quatermass Xperiment. As had been the case on The Quatermass Xperiment, Donlevy's alcoholism presented challenges for the production. Nigel Kneale recalled visiting the set one day: “He [...] was so full of whiskey he could hardly stand up. He staggered over to the set and looked dazedly around. They held up an idiot board with his lines on and he said, “What's this movie called?” and they said, “Well, it's called Quatermass 2”. He said, “I've got to say all that? There's too much talk. Cut down some of the talk”. He tried to read it and <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> go after go after go, so crippled with drink he hardly knew who he was”. Val Guest has denied Kneale's claims, saying “So many stories have been concocted since, about how he was a paralytic. It's absolute balls, because he was not paralytic. He wasn't stone cold sober either, but he was a pro and he knew his lines”. Guest also recalled, “By after lunch he would come to me and say “Give me a breakdown of the story so far. Where have I just been before this scene?” We used to feed him black coffee all morning but then we discovered he was lacing it. But he was a very professional actor and very easy to work with”.|$|E
500|$|Producers of Mad Men {{approached}} January Jones {{to portray}} Betty Draper, Don's {{wife and the}} mother of their two children. Jones avouched that portraying the character would give the audience an opportunity to see a dark side of her nature. She initially auditioned for the role of Peggy Olson, which was later given to fellow cast member Elisabeth Moss. [...] "It got down between Elisabeth Moss and myself, and it was obviously more suited to her, but Matthew had said, you know, there’s this other role, of the wife." [...] Jones signed a seven-year contract with the show, although her character originally had two lines in [...] "Smoke Gets in Your Eyes." [...] Weiner eventually edited the script to accommodate her desires. [...] "It’s such a testament to his ability," [...] Jones stated. [...] "He just took something out of thin air, which makes me think now that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> had an idea that the wife was {{going to be part of}} the show, because I kind of took the job with the promise that Betty would be a part of the show. When you sign a seven-year contract, you want to make sure you’re in the show." [...] Christina Hendricks was brought in to play Joan Holloway, the office manager and head of Sterling Cooper's secretarial pool. While Hendricks had previously made recurring appearances on ER before being on Mad Men, her acting career had been largely inactive, and Hendricks' agent urged her not to participate in the project. [...] "They said to me, 'AMC [...] doesn't have any other big shows—why would you do this instead of taking something that's a better bet?' I said, 'Look, I've gone with the one that's the better bet in the past—let's go with the really good script this time.'" ...|$|E
