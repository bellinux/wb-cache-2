The vast and undulating surface of the brown and purple moor, varied occasionally by some fantastic rocks, gleamed in the shifting light. Hesperus was the only star that yet was visible, and seemed to move before them and lead them on their journey.|$|R

50|$|Leads and polynyas {{are areas}} of open water that occur within sea ice <b>expanses</b> even though <b>air</b> {{temperatures}} are below freezing, {{and provide a}} direct interaction between the ocean and the atmosphere, which {{is important for the}} wildlife. Leads are narrow and linear - they vary in width from meter to km scale. During the winter, the water in leads quickly freezes up. They are also used for navigation purposes - even when refrozen, the ice in leads is thinner, allowing icebreakers access to an easier sail path, and submarines to surface more easily. Polynyas are more uniform in size than leads and are also larger - two types are recognized: 1) Sensible-heat polynyas, caused by the upwelling of warmer water and 2) Latent-heat polynyas, resulting from persistent winds from the coastline.|$|R

60|$|Meanwhile, {{thanks to}} Mr. Giles and Mr. Quaritch, we have his book to console us, and {{certainly}} it is a most fascinating and delightful volume. Chuang Tzu {{is one of the}} Darwinians before Darwin. He traces man from the germ, and sees his unity with nature. As an anthropologist he is excessively interesting, and he describes our primitive arboreal ancestor living in trees through his terror of animals stronger than himself, and knowing only one parent, the mother, with all the accuracy of a lecturer at the Royal Society. Like Plato, he adopts the dialogue as his mode of expression, 'putting words into other people's mouths,' he tells us, 'in order to gain breadth of view.' As a story-teller he is charming. The account of the visit of the respectable Confucius to the great Robber Che is most vivid and brilliant, and it is impossible not to laugh over the ultimate discomfiture of the sage, the barrenness of whose moral platitudes is ruthlessly exposed by the successful brigand. Even in his metaphysics, Chuang Tzu is intensely humorous. He personifies his abstractions, and makes them act plays before us. The Spirit of the Clouds, when passing eastward through the <b>expanse</b> of <b>air,</b> happened to fall in with the Vital Principle. The latter was slapping his ribs and hopping about: whereupon the Spirit of the Clouds said, 'Who are you, old man, and what are you doing?' 'Strolling!' replied the Vital Principle, without stopping, for all activities are ceaseless. 'I want to know something,' continued the Spirit of the Clouds. 'Ah!' cried the Vital Principle, in a tone of disapprobation, and a marvellous conversation follows, that is not unlike the dialogue between the Sphinx and the Chimera in Flaubert's curious drama. Talking animals, also, have their place in Chuang Tzu's parables and stories, and through myth and poetry and fancy his strange philosophy finds musical utterance.|$|R
40|$|The common ways {{used to find}} leak include {{traditional}} bubbling test, ultrasonic positioning and helium mass-spectrometer detection, etc. However, each of {{them has}} deficiencies of varying degrees, especially low-efficiency in bubbling and mass spectrometry means and poor anti-jamming capability in ultrasonic means. In order to search a better approach to do this job, a new method is introduced in this paper, {{which is based on}} infrared thermography. In the experiment, test vessel is firstly aerated with absolute pressure of 0. 6 - 0. 7 Mpa and then the temperature field surround the vessel is monitored and acquired by an IR camera. On account of leakiness, compressed <b>air</b> <b>expanses</b> from the leak hole to ambient and heat-absorption effect has taken place around it on the basis of Joule-Thomson Effect, so the temperature difference between the leak area and normal area will be reflected in the thermal images. Moreover, Freon cooler is also set in the pneumatic circuit for the sake of enhancing the phenomenon. During the test, several frames of thermal images in time sequence are transferred to the computer for pre-processing and fusion operating by the use of local entropy difference algorithm. From results, it is shown that the method achieves a good resolution and sensitivity in the application of air-leakage detection and localization. Some modeling and simulating work by finite element analysis is also carried out in this paper...|$|R
5000|$|The {{destruction}} of {{the remnants of the}} enemy forces in the Sanananda area concludes the Papuan Campaign. The Horii Army has been annihilated. The outstanding military lesson of this campaign was the continuous calculated application of air power, inherent in the potentialities of every component of the Air Forces, employed in the most intimate tactical and logistical union with ground troops. The effect of this modern instrumentality was sharply accentuated by the geographical limitations of this theater. For months on end, air transport with constant fighter coverage moved complete infantry regiments and artillery battalions across the almost impenetrable mountains and jungles of Papua, and the reaches of the sea; transported field hospitals and other base installations to the front; supplied the troops and evacuated casualties. For hundreds of miles bombers provided all-around reconnaissance, protected the coast from hostile naval intervention, and blasted the way for the infantry as it drove forward. A new form of campaign was tested which points the way to the ultimate defeat of the enemy in the Pacific. The offensive and defensive power of the air and the adaptability, range and capacity of its transport in an effective combination with ground forces, represent tactical and strategical elements of a broadened conception of warfare that will permit the application of offensive power in swift, massive strokes, rather than the dilatory and costly island-to-island advance that some have assumed to be necessary in a theater where the enemy's far-flung strongholds are dispersed throughout a vast <b>expanse</b> of archipelagos. <b>Air</b> forces and ground forces were welded together in Papua and when in sufficient strength with proper naval support, their indissoluble union points the way to victory through new and broadened strategic and tactical conceptions.|$|R
40|$|After {{establishment}} of the Soviet power the Arctic for seven decades {{had been in the}} focus of attention accomplishing the heroic, repressive, “educational”, economic, political and ideological functions. In 1930 - 1950 General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Bolshevik Communist Party I. V. Stalin created the first Soviet Arctic shield that included the economic and military strategic power, transport targeted to protection of entirety and security of the Soviet country. The Stalin’s large-scale project of Arctic development was made public in 1931 and was targeted to the enhanced protection of the polar waters by establishing the naval base on the Barents Sea. For implementation of this project the White Sea-Baltic canal was constructed. The Trust “Arktikugol” was established on the Spitsbergen Archipelago to supply coal to the Northern Navy Fleet. The sea expedition over the Northern Sea Route was also organized to prove the possibility of shipping along this route for one navigation season. Upon its successful completion the Chief Department “Sevmorput” was set up here. The epoch of airship construction was opened to explore the Arctic <b>air</b> <b>expanses.</b> Later on there were expeditions to the North Pole, deployment of army on the Chukotka Peninsula, new expeditions to high latitude terrains, construction of high-capacity icebreakers, aerodromes and military bases on the coast of the Arctic Ocean. Unfortunately, in the 1990 s in the time of the Soviet Union breakup and perestroika many facilities of the Stalin’s Arctic Shield had been lost and ceased to exist. The early 21 st century witnessed the second energetic and goal-oriented breakthrough into the Arctic region and {{establishment of}} the second Arctic Shield or bastion based on the key principles of the Soviet Arctic Shield or, in other words, its upgrade in the new conditions of the polycentric world, which is justly connected with the name of Russian President Putin. The interest to the Arctic was revived after V. V. Putin was elected in 2000 the RF President and this was observed against the sharp changes in the political and economic situation in the country. The underlying stimuli were the opening of large offshore hydrocarbon fields in the Arctic seas and global climate warming. From this time on when the interest to the Arctic was on the rise again the attitude of the Russian president and government to this region had changed enormously. Putin personally keep in the focus of his attention all Arctic issues. One of the strategic goals of the policy formulated by Putin is apparently the revival of the Russian Arctic, creation of own Arctic Shield understanding quite clearly that this would require construction anew of the great part of the Arctic infrastructure. This publication investigates in detail the steps of V. V. Putin taken for development of the Arctic ways.  </p...|$|R
