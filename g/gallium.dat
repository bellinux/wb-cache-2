5|$|Extremely high-purity (99.9999+%) <b>gallium</b> is commercially {{available}} {{to serve the}} semiconductor industry. <b>Gallium</b> arsenide (GaAs) and <b>gallium</b> nitride (GaN) used in electronic components represented about 98% of the <b>gallium</b> consumption in the United States in 2007. About 66% of semiconductor <b>gallium</b> {{is used in the}} U.S. in integrated circuits (mostly <b>gallium</b> arsenide), such as the manufacture of ultra-high speed logic chips and MESFETs for low-noise microwave preamplifiers in cell phones. About 20% of this <b>gallium</b> is used in optoelectronics. Worldwide, <b>gallium</b> arsenide makes up 95% of the annual global <b>gallium</b> consumption.|$|E
5|$|<b>Gallium</b> {{arsenide}} {{is used in}} {{a variety}} of optoelectronic infrared devices. Aluminium <b>gallium</b> arsenide (AlGaAs) is used in high-power infrared laser diodes. The semiconductors <b>gallium</b> nitride and indium <b>gallium</b> nitride are used in blue and violet optoelectronic devices, mostly laser diodes and light-emitting diodes. For example, <b>gallium</b> nitride 405nm diode lasers are used as a violet light source for higher-density Blu-ray Disc compact data disc drives.|$|E
5|$|<b>Gallium</b> is {{predominantly}} used in electronics. <b>Gallium</b> arsenide, the primary chemical compound of <b>gallium</b> in electronics, {{is used in}} microwave circuits, high-speed switching circuits, and infrared circuits. Semiconductive <b>gallium</b> nitride and indium <b>gallium</b> nitride produce blue and violet light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and diode lasers. <b>Gallium</b> is also used {{in the production of}} artificial gadolinium <b>gallium</b> garnet for jewelry.|$|E
5|$|Although <b>gallium</b> has {{no natural}} {{function}} in biology, <b>gallium</b> ions interact with {{processes in the}} body {{in a manner similar}} to iron(III). Because these processes include inflammation, a marker for many disease states, several <b>gallium</b> salts are used (or are in development) as pharmaceuticals and radiopharmaceuticals in medicine. When <b>gallium</b> ions are mistakenly taken up in place of iron(III) by bacteria such as Pseudomonas, the ions interfere with respiration, and the bacteria die. This happens because iron is redox-active, allowing the transfer of electrons during respiration, while <b>gallium</b> is redox-inactive.|$|E
5|$|Because {{germanium}} and <b>gallium</b> arsenide {{have very}} similar lattice constants, germanium substrates {{can be used}} to make <b>gallium</b> arsenide solar cells. The Mars Exploration Rovers and several satellites use triple junction <b>gallium</b> arsenide on germanium cells.|$|E
5|$|Elemental <b>gallium</b> is {{not found}} in nature, but it is easily {{obtained}} by smelting. Very pure <b>gallium</b> metal has a silvery color and its solid metal fractures conchoidally like glass. <b>Gallium</b> liquid expands by 3.1% when it solidifies; therefore, {{it should not be}} stored in glass or metal containers because the container may rupture when the <b>gallium</b> changes state. <b>Gallium</b> shares the higher-density liquid state with a short list of other materials that includes water, silicon, germanium, antimony, bismuth, and plutonium.|$|E
5|$|From its {{discovery}} in 1875 until {{the era of}} semiconductors, the primary uses of <b>gallium</b> were high-temperature thermometrics and metal alloys with unusual properties of stability or ease of melting (some such being liquid at room temperature). The development of <b>gallium</b> arsenide as a direct band gap semiconductor in the 1960s ushered in the most important stage in the applications of <b>gallium.</b>|$|E
5|$|Gallium-67 salts such as <b>gallium</b> citrate and <b>gallium</b> nitrate {{are used}} as {{radiopharmaceutical}} agents in the nuclear medicine imaging known as <b>gallium</b> scan. The radioactive isotope 67Ga is used, and the compound or salt of <b>gallium</b> is unimportant. The body handles Ga3+ in many ways {{as though it were}} Fe3+, and the ion is bound (and concentrates) in areas of inflammation, such as infection, and in areas of rapid cell division. This allows such sites to be imaged by nuclear scan techniques.|$|E
5|$|Metallic <b>gallium</b> is not toxic. However, {{exposure}} to <b>gallium</b> halide complexes {{can result in}} acute toxicity. The Ga3+ ion of soluble <b>gallium</b> salts tends to form the insoluble hydroxide when injected in large doses; precipitation of this hydroxide resulted in renal toxicity in animals. In lower doses, soluble <b>gallium</b> is tolerated well and does not accumulate as a poison, instead being excreted mostly through urine. Excretion of <b>gallium</b> occurs in two phases: the first phase has a biological half-life of one hour while the second has a biological half-life of twenty-five hours.|$|E
5|$|A {{well-known}} practical joke among chemists is {{to fashion}} <b>gallium</b> spoons {{and use them}} to serve tea to unsuspecting guests, since <b>gallium</b> has a similar appearance to its lighter homolog aluminium. The spoons then melt in the hot tea.|$|E
5|$|All {{elements}} {{in this group}} are metals. The similarity of the metallic radii of cadmium and mercury is an effect of the lanthanide contraction. So, the trend in this group is unlike the trend in group 2, the alkaline earths, where metallic radius increases smoothly {{from top to bottom}} of the group. All three metals have relatively low melting and boiling points, indicating that the metallic bond is relatively weak, with relatively little overlap between the valence band and the conduction band. Thus, zinc is close to the boundary between metallic and metalloid elements, which is usually placed between <b>gallium</b> and germanium, though <b>gallium</b> participates in semi-conductors such as <b>gallium</b> arsenide.|$|E
5|$|An alloy of {{aluminium}} and <b>gallium</b> in pellet form added to {{water can be}} used to generate hydrogen. The process also produces alumina, but the expensive <b>gallium,</b> which prevents the formation of an oxide skin on the pellets, can be re-used. This has important potential implications for a hydrogen economy, as hydrogen can be produced on-site and {{does not need to be}} transported.|$|E
5|$|Because <b>gallium</b> wets {{glass or}} porcelain, <b>gallium</b> {{can be used}} to create {{brilliant}} mirrors. When the wetting action of gallium-alloys is not desired (as in Galinstan glass thermometers), the glass must be protected with a transparent layer of gallium(III) oxide.|$|E
5|$|Copper indium <b>gallium</b> {{selenide}} is {{a material}} used in solar cells.|$|E
5|$|During the {{processing}} of bauxite to alumina in the Bayer process, <b>gallium</b> accumulates in the sodium hydroxide liquor. From this it can be extracted {{by a variety of}} methods. The most recent is the use of ion-exchange resin. Achievable extraction efficiencies critically depend on the original concentration in the feed bauxite. At a typical feed concentration of 50 ppm, about 15 % of the contained <b>gallium</b> is extractable. The remainder reports to the red mud and aluminium hydroxide streams. <b>Gallium</b> is removed from the ion-exchange resin in solution. Electrolysis then gives <b>gallium</b> metal. For semiconductor use, it is further purified with zone melting or single-crystal extraction from a melt (Czochralski process). Purities of 99.9999% are routinely achieved and commercially available.|$|E
5|$|Gallane is {{unstable}} above −10°C, decomposing to elemental <b>gallium</b> and hydrogen.|$|E
5|$|<b>Gallium</b> attacks {{most other}} metals by {{diffusing}} into the metal lattice. For example, it diffuses into the grain boundaries of aluminium-zinc alloys and steel, making them very brittle. <b>Gallium</b> easily alloys with many metals, {{and is used}} in small quantities in the plutonium-gallium alloy in the plutonium cores of nuclear bombs to stabilize the plutonium crystal structure.|$|E
5|$|<b>Gallium</b> has {{no known}} natural role in biology. Gallium(III) behaves {{in a similar}} manner to ferric salts in {{biological}} systems, and has been used in some medical applications, including pharmaceuticals and radiopharmaceuticals. <b>Gallium</b> is used in thermometers as a non-toxic and environmentally friendly alternative to mercury and can withstand higher temperatures than mercury.|$|E
5|$|<b>Gallium</b> is {{also used}} as a liquid metal ion source for a focused ion beam. For example, a focused gallium-ion beam was used to create the world's {{smallest}} book, Teeny Ted from Turnip Town. Another use of <b>gallium</b> is as an additive in glide wax for skis, and other low-friction surface materials.|$|E
5|$|<b>Gallium</b> nitrate (brand name Ganite) {{has been}} used as an {{intravenous}} pharmaceutical to treat hypercalcemia associated with tumor metastasis to bones. <b>Gallium</b> is thought to interfere with osteoclast function, and the therapy may be effective when other treatments have failed.|$|E
5|$|Indium is a silvery-white, highly ductile post-transition metal with {{a bright}} luster. It is so soft (Mohs {{hardness}} 1.2) that like sodium, it can be cut with a knife. It also leaves a visible line on paper. It {{is a member of}} group 13 on the periodic table and its properties are mostly intermediate between its vertical neighbours <b>gallium</b> and thallium. Like tin, a high-pitched cry is heard when indium is bent – a crackling sound due to crystal twinning. Like <b>gallium,</b> indium is able to wet glass. Like both, indium has a low melting point, 156.60°C (313.88°F); higher than its lighter homologue, <b>gallium,</b> but lower than its heavier homologue, thallium, and lower than tin. The boiling point is 2072°C (3762°F), higher than that of thallium, but lower than <b>gallium,</b> conversely to the general trend of melting points, but similarly to the trends down the other post-transition metal groups because of the weakness of the metallic bonding with few electrons delocalized.|$|E
5|$|The United States Geological Survey (USGS) {{estimates}} {{that more than}} 1 million tons of <b>gallium</b> is contained in known reserves of bauxite and zinc ores. Some coal flue dusts contain small quantities of <b>gallium,</b> typically less than 1% by weight. However, these amounts are not extractable without mining of the host materials (see below). Thus, the availability of <b>gallium</b> is fundamentally determined by {{the rate at which}} bauxite, zinc ores (and coal) are extracted.|$|E
5|$|The {{physical}} properties of <b>gallium</b> are highly anisotropic, i.e. have different values along {{the three major}} crystallographical axes a, b, and c (see table), producing {{a significant difference between}} the linear (α) and volume thermal expansion coefficients. The properties of <b>gallium</b> are strongly temperature-dependent, particularly near the melting point. For example, the coefficient of thermal expansion increases by several hundred percent upon melting.|$|E
5|$|The unique {{melting point}} of <b>gallium</b> {{allows it to}} melt in the human hand, and then refreeze if removed. The liquid metal has a strong {{tendency}} to supercool below its melting point/freezing point. Seeding with a crystal helps to initiate freezing. <b>Gallium</b> {{is one of the}} four metals (with caesium, rubidium, and mercury) that are known to be liquid at, or near, normal room temperature. Of the four, <b>gallium</b> {{is the only one that}} is neither highly reactive nor highly toxic and can therefore be used in metal-in-glass high-temperature thermometers. It is also notable for having one of the largest liquid ranges for a metal, and for having (unlike mercury) a low vapor pressure at high temperatures. Gallium's boiling point, 2673K, is more than eight times higher than its melting point on the absolute scale, the greatest ratio between melting point and boiling point of any element. Unlike mercury, liquid <b>gallium</b> metal wets glass and skin, along with most other materials (with the exceptions of quartz, graphite, and Teflon), making it mechanically more difficult to handle even though it is substantially less toxic and requires far fewer precautions. <b>Gallium</b> painted onto glass is a brilliant mirror. For this reason as well as the metal contamination and freezing-expansion problems, samples of <b>gallium</b> metal are usually supplied in polyethylene packets within other containers.|$|E
5|$|Devices {{that must}} {{withstand}} extremely high temperatures are often made from iridium. For example, high-temperature crucibles made of iridium {{are used in}} the Czochralski process to produce oxide single-crystals (such as sapphires) for use in computer memory devices and in solid state lasers. The crystals, such as gadolinium <b>gallium</b> garnet and yttrium <b>gallium</b> garnet, are grown by melting pre-sintered charges of mixed oxides under oxidizing conditions at temperatures up to 2100°C.|$|E
5|$|Five metalloids—boron, silicon, germanium, arsenic and antimony—can {{be found}} in cell phones (along with at least 39 other metals and nonmetals). Tellurium is {{expected}} to find such use. Of the less often recognised metalloids, phosphorus, <b>gallium</b> (in particular) and selenium have semiconductor applications. Phosphorus is used in trace amounts as a dopant for n-type semiconductors. The commercial use of <b>gallium</b> compounds is dominated by semiconductor applications—in integrated circuits; cell phones; laser diodes; light-emitting diodes; photodetectors; and solar cells. Selenium {{is used in the}} production of solar cells and in high-energy surge protectors.|$|E
5|$|<b>Gallium</b> has two stable isotopes: gallium-69 and gallium-71. The most commercially {{important}} radioisotopes are gallium-67 and gallium-68.|$|E
5|$|<b>Gallium</b> {{is found}} {{primarily}} in the +3 oxidation state. The +1 oxidation {{is also found in}} some compounds. For example, the very stable GaCl2 contains both gallium(I) and gallium(III) and can be formulated as GaIGaIIICl4; in contrast, the monochloride is unstable above 0°C disproportionating into elemental <b>gallium</b> and gallium(III) chloride. Compounds containing gallium-gallium bonds are true gallium(II) compounds; for example, GaS can be formulated Ga24+(S2−)2, and the dioxan complex Ga2Cl4(C4H8O2)2 contains a Ga–Ga bond.|$|E
5|$|<b>Gallium</b> is {{used for}} {{neutrino}} detection. Possibly the largest amount of pure <b>gallium</b> ever collected in a single spot is the Gallium-Germanium Neutrino Telescope used by the SAGE experiment at the Baksan Neutrino Observatory in Russia. This detector contains 55–57 tonnes of liquid <b>gallium.</b> Another experiment was the GALLEX neutrino detector operated in the early 1990s in an Italian mountain tunnel. The detector contained 12.2 tons of watered gallium-71. Solar neutrinos caused a few atoms of 71Ga to become radioactive 71Ge, which were detected. This experiment showed that the solar neutrino flux is 40% less than theory predicted. This deficit was not explained until better solar neutrino detectors and theories were constructed (see SNO).|$|E
5|$|Indium is a {{chemical}} element with symbolIn and atomic number 49. It is a post-transition metal {{that makes up}} 0.21parts per million of the Earth's crust. Very soft and malleable, indium has a melting point higher than sodium and <b>gallium,</b> but lower than lithium and tin. Chemically, indium is similar to <b>gallium</b> and thallium, and it is largely intermediate between the two {{in terms of its}} properties. Indium was discovered in 1863 by Ferdinand Reich and Hieronymous Theodor Richter by spectroscopic methods. They named it for the indigo blue line in its spectrum. Indium was isolated the next year.|$|E
5|$|Of the {{elements}} less often recognised as metalloids, beryllium and lead are noted for their toxicity; lead arsenate {{has been extensively}} used as an insecticide. Sulfur {{is one of the}} oldest of the fungicides and pesticides. Phosphorus, sulfur, zinc, selenium and iodine are essential nutrients, and aluminium, tin and lead may be. Sulfur, <b>gallium,</b> selenium, iodine and bismuth have medicinal applications. Sulfur is a constituent of sulfonamide drugs, still widely used for conditions such as acne and urinary tract infections. <b>Gallium</b> nitrate is used to treat the side effects of cancer; <b>gallium</b> citrate, a radiopharmaceutical, facilitates imaging of inflamed body areas. Selenium sulfide is used in medicinal shampoos and to treat skin infections such as tinea versicolor. Iodine is used as a disinfectant in various forms. Bismuth is an ingredient in some antibacterials.|$|E
5|$|Several {{paramagnetic}} crystal salts of dysprosium (Dysprosium <b>Gallium</b> Garnet, DGG; Dysprosium Aluminum Garnet, DAG; Dysprosium Iron Garnet, DyIG) {{are used}} in adiabatic demagnetization refrigerators.|$|E
5|$|Since its {{discovery}} in 1875, <b>gallium</b> {{has been used}} to make alloys with low melting points. It is also used in semiconductors as a dopant in semiconductor substrates.|$|E
5|$|The {{melting point}} of <b>gallium,</b> at 302.9146K (29.7646°C, 85.5763°F), is just above room temperature, and is {{approximately}} {{the same as the}} average summer daytime temperatures in Earth's mid-latitudes. This melting point (mp) is one of the formal temperature reference points in the International Temperature Scale of 1990 (ITS-90) established by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM). The triple point of <b>gallium,</b> 302.9166K (29.7666°C, 85.5799°F), is used by the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in preference to the melting point.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} decay mode of a {{radioisotope}} of zinc with mass number higher than 66 is beta decay (β−), which produces an isotope of <b>gallium.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{plutonium}} used {{in nuclear}} weapon pits is stabilized in the δ phase and made machinable by alloying with <b>gallium.</b>|$|E
