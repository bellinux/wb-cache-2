40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to analyse the variables that predicted setting efficacy in complex I (KI) in volleyball, in formative categories and depending on gender. The study sample was comprised of 5842 game actions carried out by the 16 <b>male</b> <b>category</b> and the 18 female category teams that participated in the Under- 16 Spanish Championship. The dependent variable was setting efficacy. The independent variables were grouped into: serve variables (a serve zone, the type of serve, striking technique, an in-game role of the server and serve direction), reception variables (a reception zone, a receiver player and reception efficacy) and setting variables (a setter‘s position, a setting zone, the type of a set, setting technique, a set’s area and tempo of a set). Multinomial logistic regression showed that the best predictive variables of setting efficacy, both in female and <b>male</b> <b>categories,</b> were reception efficacy, setting technique and tempo of a set. In the <b>male</b> <b>category,</b> the jump serve was the greatest predictor of setting efficacy, while in the female category, it was the set’s area. Therefore, in the <b>male</b> <b>category,</b> it was not only the preceding action that affected setting efficacy, but also the serve. On the contrary, in the female category, only variables of the action itself and of the previous action, reception, affected setting efficacy. The results obtained in the present study should be taken into account in the training process of both male and female volleyball players in formative stages...|$|R
