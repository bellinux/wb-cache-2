50|$|Some {{models of}} Zenith's System 3 line of {{televisions}} {{made from the}} late 1970s to the early 1990s had a feature called the Space Phone by Zenith. It was basically a <b>hands-free</b> <b>speakerphone</b> built into the television set. It used the set's speaker and remote control, {{in addition to a}} built-in microphone. A Space Phone-enabled television would connect to a telephone jack (using a built-in phone cord), and making a call was performed by pressing a button on the remote to activate the Space Phone (which would mute and begin controlling the program audio going to the speaker). The telephone number is dialed using the numeric keys on the remote, which then displays the digits being dialed on-screen (using the on-screen display features of the System 3 line). The user could then converse with another caller hands-free, much like a regular speakerphone.|$|E
