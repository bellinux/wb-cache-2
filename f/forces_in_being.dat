5000|$|The prompt {{destruction}} of these targets, {{at the outset}} of a campaign in the west would have had a two-fold benefit to NATO and west in the defense of Western Europe. First, no Soviet/Warsaw Pact tactical follow-on land-force reserves (at Corps or Army-Group strength) would have survived the RAF V-Force tactical strikes in European Russia and the Warsaw Pact border states. Therefore, a Soviet [...] "rush to the Channel" [...] (from Western Poland/East German starting points) would have been denied the follow-on forces (having been destroyed by V-Force tactical air) which would have made the success of such an armored thrust possible. V-Force tactical air would have destroyed both the <b>forces</b> <b>in</b> <b>being,</b> and the communications infrastructure (bridges, roads, railways, air bases) which would be necessary to support such a tactical movement.|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe {{defense of the}} United States {{is based on the}} Total Force concept - including a combination of active duty and reserve <b>forces</b> <b>in</b> <b>being</b> which provide for the security structure essential during national crisis. However, the Naval Reserve forces have been continually attacked and reduced in size over the past ten years. Is this continual reduction totally justified? An analysis of the costs to maintain a Reserve Seabee relative to an active duty counterpart suggests that it costs seven more times to pay, train and support the latter. While trained to meet specialization and conditional requirements, the Reserve Seabee benefits both civic and other military organizations with contributed labor, completing many construction projects during the year. The positive benefits at lower cost make the Reserve Seabee an asset to our country's Total Force. [URL] Commander, United States Naval Reserv...|$|E

40|$|Mehlman and Li offer a {{framework}} for approaching the bioethical {{issues raised by the}} military use of genomics that is compellingly grounded in both the contemporary civilian and military ethics of medical research, arguing that military commanders must be bound by the two principles of paternal- ism and proportionality. I agree fully. But I argue here that this is a much higher bar than we may fully realize. Just as the principle of proportionality relies upon a thorough assessment of harms caused and military advantage gained, the use of genomic research, on Mehlman and Li’s view, will require an accurate understanding of the connection between genotypes and phenotypes – accurate enough to ameliorate the risk undertaken by our armed <b>forces</b> <b>in</b> <b>being</b> subject to such research. Recent conceptual work in evolutionary theory and the philosophy of biology, however, renders it doubtful that such knowledge is forthcoming. The complexity of the relationship between genotypic factors and realized traits (the so-called ‘G→P map’) makes the estimation of potential military advantage, as well as potential harm to our troops, incredibly challenging. Such fundamental conceptual challenges call into question our ability to ever satisfactorily satisfy the demands of a sufficiently rigorous ethical standard...|$|E

Suspicious of leaky security among the Royal Lao Army command, Vang Pao demanded CIA-supported guerrillas for his next offensive. His insistence was problematic, as he lacked the needed manpower in his own CIA guerrilla army. In an unprecedented move, guerrillas were transferred in from other Military Regions.|$|R
