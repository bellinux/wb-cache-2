Judicial decision-making in bankruptcy proceedings is not only an important institute of bankruptcy proceedings, but also of the whole insolvency proceedings as such. Insolvency proceedings are a special type of legal proceedings which solve a <b>debtor</b> <b>s</b> bankruptcy or imminent bankruptcy and a form of its solving. Bankruptcy proceeding is one way of solving bankruptcy and in case of bankruptcy declaration the claims of creditors (which have been found) are relatively satisfied from the revenue of sold <b>debtor</b> <b>s</b> bankruptcy assets and the outstanding claims of creditors or their parts do not extinct, unless the law provides otherwise. In my thesis, I deal with decision-making activities of bankruptcy courts in bankruptcy proceedings. In order to understand the various decisions published by this subject of the insolvency proceedings, firstly I had to focus on explaining the most important concepts, the historical development of not only Czech, but also foreign bankruptcy legislation which affected the current legal [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The {{methods of}} solving the debtor' <b>s</b> <b>insolvency</b> using the "sanitation" {{principle}} It has been 5 years since the Czech Insolvency Act was enacted. Therefore {{is it a good}} opportunity to summarize {{the pros and cons of}} the current situation in this branch of law. The Insolvency Act introduced the concept of two approaches to dealing with the debtor' <b>s</b> <b>insolvency</b> which are new in the Czech legal system: the restructuring and the discharge. Both of them share the "sanitation" principle which enables the debtor to continue their existence after having adopted certain measures. The thesis consists of five major chapters. First section provides the basic explanation of the concept of insolvency and the reasons for the special treatment for the bankruptcy of those who have more creditors. There is also a brief description of the insolvency' s procedure. The second chapter deals with the restructuring, which is the method {{of solving the}} insolvency of big companies (entrepreneurs). The third chapter focuses on discharge which is intended for those who are not engaged in business activities (non-entrepreneurs) and which enables them to get rid of their debts. The discharge can be performed in two modes: either by the liquidation of the assets or through the performance of the payment calendar. The chapter four and [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Modern finance is {{increasingly}} dominated by derivatives and similar contracts that create contingent debts, which become payable only upon {{the occurrence of}} an uncertain future event. This Article identifies a pervasive opportunism hazard created by contingent debt that lawmakers and scholars have overlooked. If liability on a firm 2 ̆ 7 s contingent debt is especially likely to be triggered when the firm is insolvent, the contract that creates the debt transfers wealth from the firm 2 ̆ 7 s creditors to its shareholders. A firm therefore has incentive to engage in correlation-seeking - that is, to incur contingent debts that correlate, or that through asset purchases {{can be made to}} correlate, with the firm 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>insolvency</b> risk. The consequence is an overuse of contingent debt that destroys social wealth through overinvestment, higher borrowing costs, financial distress, and potential systemic risk. Correlation-seeking is especially pernicious because, unlike other forms of shareholder opportunism such as asset substitution, it can reduce risk to shareholders even as it increases shareholder returns. Conduct that is consistent with correlation-seeking {{played a central role in}} the 2008 financial crisis, causing the deep losses suffered by the three firms to receive the biggest bailouts: AIG, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac.

Credit providers offer loans to debtors and often employ unjust methods in an attempt to recover the outstanding debt. The mechanism applicable in this research, which credit providers use to recover the debt, is in fact the emoluments attachment order. It is my finding that legislation needs to be amended to abolish the abuse in the sense that: - The order must be obtained in a court where the debtor resides or works. - The court should have a discretion to grant the emoluments attachment order. It will make provision for judicial oversight and that the order be queried at the application stage of such an order, and not only once the order has already been granted. - A cap should be placed upon the amount deductible, which will ensure that the number of emoluments attachment orders against the <b>debtor</b> <b>s</b> salary is appropriate {{to the extent that the}} debtor will still have sufficient means to maintain himself and the dependants. The implication of these amendments would ensure that the abuse of the process of emoluments attachment orders are abolished. It is also important to note that debtors still need to act in a responsible manner. These amendments would also ensure that creditors are protected to the extent that they follow the correct procedures in order to collect the debt owed to them. It is my submission that amendments by the legislature is the only way to ensure that the abuse is curbed and to establish a balance between the rights of the creditor and the rights of the debtor.

40|$|The headline-grabbing {{business}} {{failures of}} late have brought increased {{attention to the}} relatively unresolved area of multinational bankruptcies. Parmalat, Global Crossing, and United Airlines are among the few international juggernauts that have foundered. In the financial meltdowns of these cross-border institutions, assets and creditors are dispersed throughout commercial environments that rarely end neatly at national borders. There has been heated debate, both in scholarly literature and the practical battlefield, over how best to resolve these transnational insolvencies, {{and there is nothing}} yet approaching a consensus. Reform efforts of various stripes have almost uniformly failed to gain meaningful international support. At the hub of this inability to generate international consensus is a theoretical rift. The essence of disagreement revolves around the competing theories of 2 ̆ 2 territorialism 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 universalism 2 ̆ 2 as the preferred normative models for resolving multinational failures. While territorialism counsels following strict sovereign borders in allocating regulatory jurisdiction among nations over globally dispersed assets, universalism embraces a one-law approach: the application of one 2 ̆ 2 exporting 2 ̆ 2 country 2 ̆ 7 s law extraterritorially to other 2 ̆ 2 receiving 2 ̆ 2 jurisdictions. Given that this theoretical debate between territorialism and universalism remains ongoing and unresolved, we should be unsurprised at the historic inability to craft an international agreement among nations, by treaty or other means. Indeed, we should remain pessimistic in our prognosis. Nevertheless, an important and fresh development in international bankruptcy has recently defied our bearish expectations. After decades of disagreement, one recent attempt at reform has bucked the trend of failure and actually won widespread international support: the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency (Model Law). Since the Model Law, there has been an explosion of international bankruptcy reform. These efforts include UNCITRAL 2 ̆ 7 s best practices Draft Legislative Guide, designed for countries seeking to revise their insolvency laws; the American Law Institute 2 ̆ 7 s (ALI 2 ̆ 7 <b>s)</b> Transnational <b>Insolvency</b> Project (TIP), a series of proposals for crossborder insolvencies in the three NAFTA countries; and the European Union 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Insolvency</b> Regulation, a legal enactment covering intra- European Union multinational bankruptcies. Accordingly, these recent developments present something of a puzzle: why, in the face of so many false starts, and especially in the face of ongoing disagreement over the theoretical benefits of universalism compared to territorialism, did international bankruptcy reform finally take off? Was it simply a matter of fortuitous historical timing? Was there something specific about the mechanism of the UNCITRAL Model Law (perhaps its status as a model law, as opposed to a treaty, or perhaps its substantive content) that accounted for its ability to break the loggerhead? What makes a mechanism such as a model law effective at galvanizing reform in international bankruptcy law...|$|R

If the bankruptcy of B intervenes at this point, before the sheriff has turned over to C the proceeds of the execution sale, it is clear under the decision in Clarke v.

40|$|Includes bibliographical referencesThe {{status of}} a {{creditor}} has always been vitally important in South African law. Our law contains numerous provisions - amongst others in the law of insolvency - to protect creditor's rights, that is, the ability of creditors to collect from <b>debtor</b> <b>s</b> what they are owed. Traditionally secured creditors - that is, creditors who hold some form of real security for their claim - rank higher in priority {{when it comes to}} repayment of their claims by a defaulting debtor, both in individual and collective debt enforcement procedures, and as such are, {{in the vast majority of}} cases, able to recover full or at least partial repayment of their claims. Business rescue was introduced into South African l aw with the commencement of the Companies Act 71 of 2008, which became effective on 1 May 201 1. Business rescue is a relatively new collective debt enforcement mechanism applicable to corporate debtors. There has been considerable uncertainty with regards to the interpretation of some of its provisions, mainly due to important concepts and terms not being defined. This uncertainty has extended to the provisions dealing with the extension of finance to a corporate debtor after commencement of the business rescue proceedings (so-called 'post-commencement finance') and the ranking of priority of creditors of such corporate debtor during the business rescue proceedings. The dissertation firstly seeks to explain the concept of business rescue, with specific emphasis on post-commencement finance. The relevant provisions relating to post-commencement finance are interpreted along the lines of recent principles governing statutory interpretation. An apparent conflict in the interpretation of these provisions is identified through specific reference to the limited number of judicial pronouncements on this subject matter to date. In attempting to resolve the apparent conflict in the interpretation of the relevant provisions, the dissertation then briefly considers the background to business rescue in South Africa. The Companies Act itself is considered, with specific reference to its stated purpose and objects, along with a look at the historical development of the specific provisions in question. A brief review is then undertaken of the role and f unction of real security in a collectively debt enforcement procedure such as business rescue under South African law, with specific reference to the existing distribution rules in insolvency la w. A comparative review of relevant foreign jurisdictions is then carried out. The dissertation concludes with a suggested approach to the interpretation of the ranking of priorities under business rescue...|$|R

40|$|The {{international}} {{investment account}} of the United States has gone through several cycles. Before World War I, the U. S. was a borrower {{most of the time}} and an international debtor. Between the two World Wars, it was first a lender and then a refuge for foreign capital. After World War 11, the U.

S. was still an overall borrower and debtor. The technological leaders among U. S. manufacturing firms pioneered in this technique for exploiting their particular knowledge and skills by producing in other countries. The peak in the importance of foreign assets relative to the domestic assets of U. S. companies was probably reached during the early 1970 s. While the flow of direct investment from the U.

40|$|This paper aims {{to analyse}} the pari passu {{principle}} of insolvency law (which provides that the creditors {{of a company}} in liquidation are to be paid rateably), and to ask how it relates to other principles available {{for the treatment of}} claims in corporate liquidation. The discussion reveals that the principle has rather limited effect in governing distributions of the insolvent 2 ̆ 7 s estate. Not only do various types of secured claim fall beyond its ambit, even unsecured claims are often exempt from its application. Nevertheless, the principle thrives both in judicial rhetoric and in academic arguments. For example, many a challenge to the different priorities accorded to different types of claim in a company 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>insolvency</b> begins with an incantation of the pari passu principle. Commentators see an inherent tension between the 2 ̆ 7 two fundamental principles of credit and insolvency law 2 ̆ 7, that of the freedom of contract which allows one to bargain for priority, and the mandatory pari passu principle. The pari passu principle is said to be 2 ̆ 7 the foremost principle in the law of insolvency around the world 2 ̆ 7. It is thought to be 2 ̆ 7 all-pervasive 2 ̆ 7, and its effect is to 2 ̆ 7 strike down all agreements which have as their object or result the unfair preference of a particular creditor by removal from the estate on winding up of an asset that would otherwise have been available for the general body of creditors. 2 ̆ 7 The principle is said to be supported both by the need for an orderly liquidation of insolvents 2 ̆ 7 estates, and by requirements of fairness. So {{it is not surprising that}} its invocation as the starting point for, say, the debate on the priority of secured or preferential claims, weights the argument in a particular way. Since the pari passu principle has been recognised so widely and for so long as vital, and since it serves such desirable aims as orderliness in liquidation and fairness to all creditors, any deviation from it must be a cause for concern. On this view, the priority (say) of secured or preferential claims is an abnormality, a pathology to be diagnosed and controlled, perhaps even 2 ̆ 7 cured 2 ̆ 7. Since 2 ̆ 7 equality 2 ̆ 7 is the norm, the onus must be on those supporting differing priorities to justify their claim. To the extent that their efforts are unpersuasive, the case for priority must be considered not established, and the 2 ̆ 7 default principle 2 ̆ 7 of 2 ̆ 7 equality 2 ̆ 7 must prevail. This paper seeks to overturn this order of things. It is suggested the pari passu principle does not constitute an accurate description of how the assets of insolvent companies are in fact distributed, has no role to play in ensuring an orderly winding up of such companies, does not explain or justify distinctive features of the formal insolvency regime, and has little to do with fairness in liquidation. The actual role of the principle, it is argued, is merely to provide a low-cost method for dealing with those types of claim which both Parliament and commercial parties themselves have decided should receive little or nothing in most insolvencies. The principle, long regarded as the core distributional principle in corporate liquidation, is more properly understood as a principle of non-distribution. To the extent that these arguments succeed, the initial onus of justifying their position shifts from those arguing in favour of the priority of secured credit, to those who support a more 2 ̆ 7 equal 2 ̆ 7 distribution of the insolvent 2 ̆ 7 s estate...|$|R
40|$|We take a {{class of}} games with two players and two actions which only have mixed {{strategy}} Nash equilibria. We show that such games can only have hybrid equilibria if played sequentially with one player moving first. The hybrid equilibrium has the leader p laying a mixed strategy but the follower playing a pure strategy. We apply this result to a game between a debtor and a lender following a loan contract. The debtor can have high or low revenues and has to report his state to the lender. The lender can choose {{whether or not to}} undertake a costly audit. With simultaneou s play there is only a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium with random cheating in reports and auditing. With sequential play if the debtor moves first, there is zero auditing and the debtor cheats as much as possible without giving the incentive to audit. We argue that the setting of the game and the valuable first mover advantage of the debtor mean that we should expect the game to be played sequentially with this hybrid outcome. This is important {{in the context of the}} loan contract since the hybrid outcome makes the contract renegotiation proof. Alternatively if the timing allowed the lender to move first, then the equilibrium would have the debtor reporting truthfully and the monitor auditing just sufficiently to ensure truthtelling by the <b>debtor.</b> This ha <b>s</b> strong links to the optimal debt contract with no commitment (Mookherjee-Png, 1989 and Jost, 1996).

40|$|The report {{deals with}} the key drivers of {{business}} set-ups, transfers and closures. It considers innovative new business models and entrepreneurial activity. It also examines {{a wide range of}} regulatory, institutional and financial factors that influence primarily set-ups, but ultimately can also impact on the manner and ease with which businesses close. Finally, the report examines the closure of businesses - through voluntary exits, personal insolvency (bankruptcy) or corporate insolvency. This report was released on 21 May 2015. You are invited to examine the draft report, to make written submissions by Friday 3 July 2015 and to register to participate in public hearings. Key Points 	Businesses are set-up {{for a variety of reasons}} and in any one year there is a churn of entries and exits that is comparable with other countries. Most businesses are small and a very low proportion are innovative, producing a product or service new to Australian or international markets. The propensity to be innovative is highest amongst larger businesses. 	While it is generally relatively easy to start a business, a number of longstanding issues with specific regulatory requirements and regulator engagement and funding remain unaddressed and are making new business entry unnecessarily complex or costly. 	Some new business models - particularly those that exploit digital technology to make better use of information - are challenging existing regulatory arrangements or causing others to operate in regulatory grey areas. Regulators should have the capacity to exempt businesses for a fixed period, from particular regulatory requirements where these deter entry but exemption does not threaten consumer, public health and safety, or environmental outcomes. 	Government assistance to business set-ups should not be directed at particular business models, technologies, sectors or locations - criteria based on desired outcomes (such as technology transfer and spillovers) with matching private sector investment, are less likely to distort incentives and behaviours, particularly in a rapidly evolving environment. Any assistance should focus on those areas where there are economy-wide net benefits, and in the absence of a business set-up, there would be a justifiable need for other forms of government assistance. 	Access to finance is generally not a significant barrier to business set-up. 	 		New debt financing platforms, such as peer-to-peer lending, are helping to fill the gap in unsecured debt finance available from the major financial institutions. The voluntary participation by lenders in comprehensive credit reporting should be reviewed. 		A two-tier regulatory structure should be introduced for crowd-sourced equity to balance the financing needs of business against the risk preferences of different types of investors. 	 	 	Most businesses are closed or transferred without financial failure. Governments 2 ̆ 7 role in such situations should be limited to provision of clear guidelines for businesses, associations and advisers on exit and succession planning, and ensuring government processes are timely. 	While some specific reforms to Australia 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> corporate <b>insolvency</b> regime are warranted, a wholesale change to the system, such as the adoption of the United States 2 ̆ 7 chapter 112 ̆ 7 framework, is not justified. 	 		Formal restructuring of companies through voluntary administration should be enabled as an option for when a company may become, but is not yet, insolvent. 		There should be provision for a 2 ̆ 7 safe harbour 2 ̆ 7 to allow company directors to explore restructuring options without liability for insolvent trading. 		A simplified liquidation process should be introduced to reduce the time and expense toward winding up businesses with little or no recoverable assets. 		All directors should be required to obtain a director identification number to enable the easier detection of disqualified or fraudulent directors. 	 	 	The default exclusion period and associated restrictions applying to bankrupts in relation to access to finance, employment (including being a company director) and overseas travel should be reduced from 3 years to 1 year, with the trustee and courts retaining the power to extend this period where necessary to prevent abuse of the bankruptcy process...|$|R
40|$|What is the {{relationship}} between fairness, efficiency, accountability, and expertise? What role, if any at all, do these values play in answering the question whether a part of the law is legitimate? This paper provides an answer by introducing a distinction between the substantive and the procedural goals of any part of the legal system. Substantive goals are the ultimate ends of some part of the law, some values or objectives whose pursuit by that part of the law shows why it is desirable to have that law in the first place. Procedural goals are concerned with the methods the law adopts in pursuit of its substantive goals. It is argued that efficiency, accountability and expertise are procedural goals of the law, and can only make sense as benchmarks of legitimacy if they are connected to the accomplishment of some substantive goal that insolvency law could be shown to be committed to. Fairness, on the other hand, is a substantive goal of the law. One implication of recognising this distinction is that the common assertion that fairness might sometimes have to be traded off against the other three values, must be mistaken. Fairness (as an end) does not compete with efficiency, expertise, and accountability (which are all means), and so cannot be traded off against them. This paper uses these arguments to provide a critique of Vanessa Finch 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> book, ‘Corporate <b>Insolvency</b> Law - Perspectives and Principles’ (Cambridge: CUP 2002). It is shown that Finch does not motivate her choice of technical efficiency (referred to in this paper as transaction cost efficiency) over other understandings of the concept of efficiency, does not explain the sort of costs it is meant to mitigate, nor the desired ends in pursuit of which it is to be harnessed. Because of these deficiencies, Finch fails to notice that expertise and accountability are in fact aspects or components of efficiency. The paper explains how the former is a function of coordination costs, the latter is a method for controlling motivation costs, and the mitigation of both types of cost is very much part and parcel of transaction cost efficiency. Another implication is that Finch 2 ̆ 7 s normative framework would only make sense if she could provide a coherent and attractive theory of fairness, the ultimate end the pursuit by insolvency law of which is facilitated by the other, procedural, values. Having examined the notions of fairness Finch employs throughout the book, the paper concludes that two of them are question begging, a third is probably inconsistent with the others, and none of them withstands scrutiny...|$|R
5000|$|W. <b>S.</b> Bent {{declared}} <b>insolvency</b> in 1908 (and {{again in}} 1913). Soon after, Mayence married Frederick Francis Tate, brother of James William Tate and Dame Maggie Teyte. D. E. Cooper {{moved back to}} Sotik in 1909, dissolving his partnership with Mayence. In 1912, Fred Tate purchased two plots of land and had a new hotel designed by architects Robertson, Gow & Davidson, and built on Delamere Avenue. This building had 60 rooms in three stories. In 1913, with the new hotel's completion, the original site was sold to ex-postmaster Daniel William Noble. The Tates had originally planned to transfer the [...] "Stanley Hotel" [...] name to the new location, but Noble sued and won the use of [...] "Old Stanley Hotel". Thus the [...] "New Stanley Hotel" [...] was born.During the first World War, Fred Tate served as a lieutenant with the local forces. Soon after he returned, he was struck with blindness and general paralysis. In 1926, he and Mayence moved to London, leaving the hotel to be run by Albert Ernest Waterman, his wife Florence Annie, and their daughter Ruby. In 1932, after six years in London, the Tates returned to Nairobi {{for the opening of}} the New Stanley Long Bar. Fred Tate kept busy with the constant appraisal of the hotel's guests, and the minutiae of things such as the daily menu. After Fred's death in 1937, Mayence's interest in managing the hotel's affairs waned. She eventually sold the hotel to Abraham Lazarus Block, a Jewish Lithuanian entrepreneur, in 1947, although she still maintained a financial interest. Mayence later moved to Hove, Sussex, where she died in 1968 at the age of 99.Abraham Block's involvement with the Stanley Hotel had started not in 1947, but in 1903. One of Block's earliest business transactions in Nairobi was a deal with Mayence Bent involving having new mattresses sewn for the Victoria Hotel. Block had originally fled from his homeland of Lithuania to England to escape religious persecution. Seeing that living in London [...] "was taking him nowhere", he soon followed his father, who had fled to South Africa, and later fought in the Second Boer War. Block, convinced that Kenya was a [...] "New Zion" [...] for Jews, travelled to Nairobi via the Post steamer Feldmarschall and overland by train. Soon after arriving, Block met Mayence, who informed him of her need for mattresses. He hired R. A. de Souza to sew covers, hired labourers who were loitering around Tommy Wood's general store to stuff them with residual grass which had been previously cut for railroad clearing, and, when stronger needles were needed to sew the heavy cloth, constructed them from bicycle spokes. In 1958, most of the hotel structure was torn down and rebuilt per Abraham Block's two sons' plans for expansion.|$|R
40|$|Chapter 11 {{is widely}} {{believed}} {{to be among the}} industrialized world 2 ̆ 7 s most debtor-oriented reorganization laws. Critics assert that Chapter 11 is too easily available and that it allows debtors too much control by, inter alia, not requiring appointment of a trustee. One criticism of Chapter 11, low returns to unsecured creditors, resonates with an important theme of this Symposium, the Bebchuk-Fried proposal to reduce secured creditor priority in insolvency proceedings. The Chapter 11 criticisms and the Bebchuk-Fried proposal raise the question whether less easy access to Chapter 11, reduced debtor control, diminished secured creditor priority, or other changes could reduce filings and delays, improve performance, and reduce costs. Directly exploring such issues without repealing or changing Chapter 11 is not possible. Social experiments could help supply an answer. Given political and practical reality, however, such experiments are unlikely to be conducted. Second-best empirical evaluation methods will have to suffice. One method is to compare Chapter 112 ̆ 7 s performance with that of a reorganization system similar to Chapter 11, but differing in some crucial respects, such as whether a trustee or other official must be appointed. Comparing Chapter 112 ̆ 7 s results with those of the second system should yield insights into Chapter 112 ̆ 7 s efficacy. This Article presents the results of such an empirical study. It compares data from prior Chapter 11 studies with new data on Finnish reorganizations. Finnish reorganization law is in many important respects similar to Chapter 11. But it contains two central features that are less favorable to debtors. The first feature is its early detection and termination of cases inappropriate for reorganization. A second noteworthy difference is the U. <b>S.</b> <b>debtors</b> 2 ̆ 7 greater influence over the reorganization plan and the information communicated to creditors. 2 ̆ 2 The United States is probably the only developed nation that leaves the debtor in unsupervised possession of the estate during a reorganization. 2 ̆ 2 This Article examines whether differences in the countries 2 ̆ 7 reorganization laws affect their reorganization systems 2 ̆ 7 performance. In particular, one expects Finnish reorganization proceedings to be more selectively employed, to be quicker, to be less likely to devote time and energy to hopeless firms, and to generate results more favorable to creditors. Our comparative analysis indicates that a greater portion of insolvent firms reorganize in the United States than in Finland. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that Chapter 112 ̆ 7 s prodebtor features attract more filings and induce debtors to file at an earlier stage of financial difficulty. Surprisingly, we find no evidence that the U. S. system leads to reorganization plans that are more favorable to debtors. While Finnish reorganization mechanics are more procreditor, a substantive rule requiring full payment to creditors for owners to retain ownership may generate U. S. plans that are more favorable to creditors. We confirm the favorable treatment of U. S. unsecured creditors by briefly examining results from Canada, Japan, and Australia...|$|R
40|$|PROJECT FINANCING OF NATURAL GAS PIPELINES A STUDY ON NATURAL GAS PIPELINE PROJECT FINANCING UNDER FINANCIAL LAW AND LAW OF SECURITY INTERESTS. 1 Object {{and methods}} of the study Currently, Russia is the only {{supplier}} of natural gas to Finland. This study investigates how can the natural gas markets in Finland be opened by constructing a natural gas pipeline from Norway through Sweden to Finland {{in a manner that}} would be beneficial under financing laws and the law of security interests. Answers have been sought applying traditional analytical doctrine, utilizing as far as possible the questions enabled by the doctrine. In places where the answers have not been found applying traditional analytical doctrine, Juha Karhu s contemporary approach to the law of security interests has been applied. This study discusses various issues under financial law and law related to security interests related to property located in Finland, Sweden and Norway. The main {{purpose of this study is}} to examine whether a project company, as the borrower under a project loan, or the shareholders of a project company, could provide sufficient collateral for loan for a natural gas pipeline project. The legal literature used and discussed in this study includes a large variety of Nordic monographs and general property law books. In addition, Nordic case law concerning certain legal questions about which no literature is available has been studied in detail. 2 Structure of the study The study is divided into sections based on the type of collateral for the project loan. In addition, the study includes a short financing section in which the elements of a natural gas pipeline feasibility study are described, studied and applied to a hypothetical natural gas pipeline project. The discussion of the collateral for the project loan is divided into sections: (i) the property law-related issues concerning the construction of the pipeline and the possibility of pledging real estate owned, leased or expropriated by the project company as collateral for the project loan; (ii) the nature of the intercreditor agreements entered into among the members of the banking syndicate under Finnish, Swedish and Norwegian law; (iii) how the so-called earnings principle would affect the structure of the construction agreement for the natural gas pipeline and the effectiveness of the pledge of natural gas transportation fee receivables in the Nordic countries; (iv) how the pledgee could use the control factor related to a share pledge when the shareholders of the project company pledge the project company s shares as collateral for the project loan. 2. 1 Real property required to construct the natural gas pipeline Due to its length, the natural gas pipeline would be built on real property owned by other parties than the project company. The project company would receive the right to use this property through an expropriation procedure. One of the most valuable assets of the project company has is the turbines that are located at the compressor stations. In order to ensure that the natural gas flowing through the pipeline remains pressurized, it must periodically be compressed along the pipeline at the compressor stations. This section examines the land codes of Finland, Sweden and Norway and discusses the possibilities for the project company to delineate which machine or facility is, or is not, part of a real estate through registration. This registration has proven useful in determining the scope of the real estate mortgage vis-à-vis the scope of a business mortgage established to the project company s assets. The registration should be used to designate that the turbines, for example, are part of the project company s real estate, and therefore, pledged under the real estate mortgage. If this registration is not carried out, there is a risk that the turbines will be considered to be pledged as a part of the business mortgage established to the project company s assets. In Finland, a business mortgage lender may only recover 50 percent of the enforcement proceeds and the remainder is divided among all creditors. 2. 2 Intercreditor agreements t is customary for the members of the banking syndicate that finance a project loan to enter into an intercreditor agreement. This agreement regulates, among other things, the relationship between the senior and junior creditors regarding the terms of loan repayment and the payment order regarding the payment received from the enforcement of the project collateral. In Finland, the Act on Creditors Payment Order (1578 / 1992, as amended) regulates the payment order in a <b>debtor</b> <b>s</b> bankruptcy or foreclosure. Similar acts are in force in Sweden and Norway. However, it is possible for the parties to agree on an alternative payment order and these agreements are binding inter partes. In Finland, in order for the obligations of an intercreditor agreement to bind third parties, the agreement must be construed as a pledge or transfer of receivables with the intention of securing payment to the senior creditor. It may also be construed as a new financing form to which the Finnish Promissory Notes Act (487 / 1987, as amended) would be applied by analogy. 2. 3 The effects of the so-called earnings principle on the collateral securing the repayment of the project loan and on the construction agreement Due to the scale and complexity of natural gas pipeline projects, the construction of a natural gas pipelines usually takes years to complete. The so-called earnings principle affects the structure of the construction agreement. The question discussed in this section is whether it is advisable for the project company to allow the constructor to build the pipeline on its own account or whether the project company would benefit from an agreement under which the pipeline would be constructed in parts and the ownership of individual segments of the pipeline would be transferred to the project company upon their completion. If the constructor files for bankruptcy, this above-mentioned framework could serve as a basis for concluding which parts of the unfinished pipeline would be part of the project company s or the constructor s bankruptcy estate and which part will be covered by a business mortgage established to the project company s or the construction company s assets. In addition, the earnings principle affects the effectiveness of the pledge of natural gas transportation fee receivables in the Nordic countries. If the pledged receivable is not divisible, and the pledgor was unable to earn the receivable before the pledgor s bankruptcy, the pledgor s bankruptcy estate has the right to terminate the underlying pledge agreement, rendering the pledge null and void. If the bankruptcy estate continues the pledgor s business, it is entitled to the pledged assets because no part of the pledge was earned by the pledgor prior to its bankruptcy. If (a) the pledged agreement is divisible, (b) the estate continues the pledgor s business and (c) the estate is unable to terminate the portions of the pledge already earned, the earnings principle divides the pledge into two parts: the pledgee will receive the part of the pledge earned prior to the bankruptcy and the bankruptcy estate is entitled to the part earned after bankruptcy. This study raises arguments against the contemporary view accepted in legal literature in relation to the pledging of future receivables. The contemporary view is to consider that the earnings principle is taken into account when the pledge is established. The view presented in this study is that the earnings principle does not come into effect prior to the execution phase of the pledge agreement. 2. 4 Pledging of the project company s shares The shareholders of a project company usually pledge the project company s shares as collateral for the project loan. The study analyses in detail the problems related to the control function and the collateral function of a share pledge. The control function related to a share pledge affects the possession of the shares from the establishment of the share pledge to the enforcement of the pledge. The thorough examination of the parties risk positions serves as an interesting starting point. The section discusses how the composition of a project company s board of directors may affect the decisions the project company makes and the claw back of the company s pledge/mortgage agreements to the project company s bankruptcy estate. There are jurisdictions in which a project company s sponsors are unable to pledge the project company s shares to the banking syndicate as collateral for the project loan. In such jurisdictions, a floating charge as found in English law may prove a useful tool due to the fact that it covers all of a company s assets (including real property). In such cases, the floating charge would de facto have the same characteristics as a share pledge in terms of controlling the project.

40|$|After the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994, the U. S. banking {{industry}} has significantly transformed its organisation structure from banks into bank holding companies (BHCs) {{as a result}} of the consolidation process, resulting in larger and more complex BHCs. Under the source-of-strength doctrine and the cross-guarantee authority, a BHC is required to inject capital into the bank subsidiary when it is financially distressed. However, these bank-failed resolutions were introduced before the deregulation; therefore, have not taken into account the increased organisational complexity of BHCs since then. Systemic importance of BHCs has recently attracted attention from policymakers and researchers. Accordingly, the complexity of BHCs will generate concerns about the risk implication of their subsidiaries as compared to the stand-alone structure. This thesis consists of three interrelated essays on stand-alone commercial banks, single-bank holding company (SBHC) affiliates and multi-bank holding company (MBHC) affiliates in the U. S. {{banking industry}}. It investigates the role that these financial intermediaries play in (i) banking business activities, (ii) insolvency risk, and (iii) mergers and acquisitions (M&As). The first essay is a qualitative analysis about on- and off-balance sheet analysis, asset securitization and derivatives of these banks which provide a thorough understanding of the difference in permissible scopes of banking business activities among stand-alone banks, SBHC affiliates and MBHC affiliates based on Bank’s Uniform Bank Performance Report. The findings show that SBHC affiliates and MBHC affiliates pursue diversification strategies by running a broad range of activities from traditional lending business to off-balance sheet, asset securitization and derivatives whereas stand-alone banks are more specialised. However, SBHC affiliates show more concentration on taking deposits, issuing loans and demonstrate the most important role in financial intermediation in the U. S. banking system as compared to MBHC affiliates and stand-alone banks. In a striking contrast, MBHC affiliates are dominant in off-balance sheet activities, asset securitization, and derivative activities. This suggests that the MBHC group performs the main role of disintermediation in the U. S. The second essay compares the differences in insolvency risk of stand-alone banks, SBHC affiliates and MBHC affiliates by using U. S. commercial bank data and BHC data from 1994 to 2012. The study’s results show that MBHCs in the U. <b>S.</b> have lower <b>insolvency</b> risk than SBHCs and stand-alone commercial banks at the parent levels, but have significant higher insolvency risk than both at the subsidiary levels. These results suggest that BHC affiliates benefit from an internal capital market and increased diversification from the BHC structure, but face risks of the increased complexity if the number of subsidiaries increases. The third essay investigates the difference in the likelihood of being targets and acquirers among stand-alone banks, SBHC affiliates and MBHC affiliates by using M&A data on U. S. commercial banks from 1997 to 2012. The reported results show that MBHC affiliates exhibit a greater likelihood of being targets than do stand-alone commercial banks, while stand-alone banks have a greater probability of becoming targets than do SBHC affiliates. The findings show that MBHC affiliates tend to have a greater likelihood of being acquirers than do SBHC affiliates. SBHC affiliates have a greater probability of being acquirers than do stand-alone banks. Those banks that acquire another bank within the same MBHC structure tend to be smaller and more financially constrained than those banks acquiring outside the same MBHC structure, whereas targets that are acquired by another bank within the same MBHC structure tend to be smaller, with higher profitability and capital than targets that are acquired by banks from outside the MBHC structure. The results suggest that the MBHC parent attempts to discipline distressed, poorly performing and smaller affiliates by involving them in M&As. To sum up, this study provides four policy implications. First, regulators should devote particular effort to regulating banks at the subsidiary levels to restrict their risk-taking behaviour. In this sense, the regulators should revise the source-of-strength doctrine cross-guarantee authority to ensure that MBHC affiliates can receive their parent’s bail-out in the future when in distress. Second, regarding complexity issues inside BHC structure, regulators should consider risk exposure between banks affiliated with SBHC and MBHC separately. Third, understanding the fact that MBHC parent attempts to hinder inherent risks of their subsidiaries by involving them in successive M&A inside the structure, the bank regulators should put more restrictions on their M&A applications and reveal their problems to the financial market. Finally, stand-alone banks should be encouraged to transform into SBHC affiliates in the future. Consequently, the Federal Reserve should make the path easier for banks to transform into SBHCs to increase their stability in the U. S. banking system...|$|R
