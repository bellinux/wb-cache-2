40|$|Abstract—Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) is a non-parametrical {{method for}} {{evaluating}} the efficiency of Decision Making Units (DMUs) using mathematical programming. But in special cases for the reason of a few difficulties such as weak efficient frontier and computing of non- Archimedean number and etc. this evaluation cannot do exactly. For evaluating the efficiency of DMUs, some of the units are located on the weak bound. In the <b>facet</b> <b>analysis,</b> we can move the units on weak boundary toward the effective frontier by selecting the lower bound for variables. Previously, some {{studies have been done}} to modify weak frontier at basic DEA model. In DEA models it has been assumed that outputs go outside of the system but there are systems in which some part of the outputs possibly used as inputs in the system.

40|$|This {{research}} examines Ranganathan’s postulational {{approach to}} <b>facet</b> <b>analysis</b> {{with the intention}} of manually inducing a faceted classification ontology from a folksonomy. Folksonomies are viewed as a source to a wealth of data representing users’ perspectives. An in-depth study of faceted classification theory is used to form a methodology based on the postulational approach. The dataset used to test the methodology consists of over 107, 000 instances of 1, 275 unique tags representing 76 popular non-fiction history books collected from the LibraryThing folksonomy. Preliminary results of the <b>facet</b> <b>analysis</b> indicate the manual inducement of two faceted classification ontologies in the dataset; one representing the universe of books and one representing the universe of subjects within the universe of books. The ontology representing the universe of books is considered to be complete, whereas the ontology representing the universe of subjects is incomplete. These differences are discussed in light of theoretical differences between special and universal faceted classifications. The induced ontologies are then discussed in terms of their substantiation or violation of Ranganathan’s Canons of Classification. Master i bibliotek- og informasjonsvitenska...|$|E

Although {{the task of}} matching questions to their best answers has been tackled {{for more than a}} decade, the social question-answering practice is a complex process. The factors influencing the accuracy of question-answer matching are many and hard to disentangle. We approach the task from an applicationoriented perspective, probing the space of several dimensions relevant to this problem: features, algorithms, and topics. We gather under a learning to rank framework the most extensive feature set used in literature to date, including 225 features from five different families. We test the power of such features in predicting the best answer to a question on the largest dataset from Yahoo Answers used for this task so far (40 M answers) and provide a <b>faceted</b> <b>analysis</b> of the results along different topical areas and question types. We propose a novel family of distributional semantics measures that most of the time can seamlessly replace widely used linguistic similarity features, being more than one order of magnitude faster to compute and providing greater predictive power.

40|$|This article {{considers}} a particularly knotty aspect of classifying notated music: {{the classification of}} instrumental ensembles, where the term ensemblesis defined as music written for multiple players with only one player per part. <b>Facet</b> <b>analysis</b> is used to examine this area of music classification and {{as the basis of}} a model for classifying ensembles. The conceptual analysis is aided by examples drawn from two classification schemes, British Catalogue of Music Classification (BCMC) and Flexible Classification. First, this exploration reveals that there are conceptually four sub-facets for classifying instrument ensembles, and that the omission of any of these sub-facets causes issues within classification schemes. Next, the different type of relationships between pairs of these sub-facets is delineated, including hierarchical and associative relationships. The classification of ensembles is depicted in a novel way, as a series of inter-connected relationships between sub-facets. Finally, the article ascertains exactly what is being counted, including introducing potential extra sets of sub-facets pertaining to performers and hands. So, <b>facet</b> <b>analysis</b> helps to create a model for classifying instrumental ensembles which provides a novel solution to this historically problematic area of music classification, as well as suggesting a potentially generalizable new way of thinking about complex relationships between sub-facet...|$|E

40|$|Raters play {{a central}} role in rater-mediated assessment, and rater {{variability}} manifested in various forms including rater errors contributes to construct-irrelevant variance which can adversely affect an examinee’s test score. Halo effect as a subcomponent of rater errors is one of the most pervasive errors which, if not detected, can result in obscuring an examinee’s score and threatening validity and fairness of second language performance assessment. To that end, the present study is an endeavor to detect halo effect in L 2 essays, using a relatively newly employed methodology, a many-facet Rasch model (MFRM) in language assessment. The participants in this study consisted of 194 raters—subdivided into self-rater, peer-rater, and teacher rater—who rated 188 essays written by 188 undergraduate Iranian English majors at two state-run universities in Iran. The collected data were rated using a 6 -point analytic rating scale and were analyzed using the latest version of Facets 3. 68. 0 to answer the research question of the study. The results of <b>facets</b> <b>analysis</b> showed that, at group level, the raters did not exhibit any sign of halo effect, but, at individual level, all rater types displayed considerable halo effect. Further analysis revealed that rater types were unanimous about halo effect on four items and that self-rater showed more of a halo effect compared to the other two rater types...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In rater-mediated second {{language}} performance assessments, where human judgment {{is needed to}} evaluate {{the quality of a}} student’s response to a particular task on a set of criteria, raters are error-prone. These unwanted, rater-dependent systematic sources of variability, which are unrelated to the students’ abilities and manifested in various ways, could endanger the fairness and validity of decisions made based on the assigned ratings. Centrality or central tendency effect {{is one of the most}} pervasive sources of rater variability which has been under-researched in EFL classroom-based assessment settings. The present study aims to employ a many-facet Rasch model (MFRM), a relatively newly developed measurement model, to detect central tendency effect in self-assessment, peer-assessment and teacher assessment. To that end, 194 assessors- 188 self-and peer-assessors and 6 teacher assessors-were employed to assess 188 essays written by Iranian English majors at universities in Iran, using a six-point analytic rating scale. The data were collected and analyzed, using Facets 3. 68. 1. The results of <b>Facets</b> <b>analysis</b> showed that the three types of assessor-self-assessor, peer-assessor and teacher assessor-did not exhibit any sign of centrality either at group level or at individual level. The findings are promising in that they provide evidence for the viability of both self-assessors and peer-assessors for rating purposes along with teachers.
