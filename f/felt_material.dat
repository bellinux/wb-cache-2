50|$|A marker pen, fineliner, marking pen, {{felt-tip}} marker, felt-tip pen, flow, marker or texta (in Australia) or sketch pen (in India), is a pen {{which has}} its own ink-source, and a tip made of porous, pressed fibers such as felt. A permanent marker consists of a container (glass, aluminum or plastic) and a core of an absorbent material. This filling serves as a carrier for the ink. The upper part of the marker contains the nib that was made in earlier time of a hard <b>felt</b> <b>material,</b> and a cap to prevent the marker from drying out.

5000|$|Although {{the mid-19th}} century shako was {{impressive}} in appearance and added to {{the height of the}} wearer, it was also heavy and by itself provided little protection against bad weather as most models were made of cloth or <b>felt</b> <b>material</b> over a leather body and peak. Many armies countered this by utilising specially designed oilskin covers to protect the shako and the wearer from heavy rain while on campaign. The shako provided little protection from enemy action as the most it could offer was in giving partial shielding of the skull from enemy cavalry sabres.During the period of general peace that followed the Napoleonic Wars, the shako in European armies became a showy and impractical headdress that was best suited for the parade ground.

40|$|Microbial Fuel Cell (MFC) is a {{promising}} technology to convert biodegradable materials present in wastewater into electricity, under anaerobic conditions. The potential application {{in the near}} future {{is likely to be a}} sustainable process for waste water treatment, stand-alone sensors for long-term operations in low accessibility regions, mobile robot/sensor platforms and renewable energy systems. Conductive materials inside anode and cathode chambers of MFC, assume a fundamental key point for the overall MFC performance. Electrode materials vary in their physical and chemical properties, thus, they also vary in their impact on microbial selection attachment, electron transfer, electrode resistance and the rate of electrode surface reaction. Therefore, in order to promote electrons transfer, the electrode materials should have the following properties: good electrical conductivity, strong biocompatibility, chemical stability and high anti-corrosion, large surface area and adequate mechanical force. In this way, to render MFCs into a cost-effective and energy sustainable technology, efforts have been done to increase power generation. In this respect, focus on low cost commercial materials and up-grade of electrode surface characteristics, in terms of electrical conductivity and morphology structure represent a high challenging task. For this reason, in this work commercial carbon felt has been used as anode electrode after satisfactory pre-treatments. Acid treatment by HNO 3 soaking and polyaniline deposition have been made on carbon felt before to test in MFC. Tests have been conducted by a two-compartment laboratory prototype of MFC under the same operation conditions using Saccaromyces cerevisiae as active microorganisms, varying only the anode electrode: 1) Carbon felt, 2) Carbon felt previously treated by HNO 3 and 3) Carbon felt with PANI depositions. Electrochemical experiments were carried out to determine how the nitric acid and PANI depositions affected the performance of carbon <b>felt</b> <b>material.</b> Results obtained using Linear Sweep Voltammetry technique shows an increase of performance in terms of power density for both pre-treatment processes. Commercial carbon <b>felt</b> <b>material</b> showed a power density of 12 mW L- 1, while carbon felt treated by HNO 3 and PANI depositions showed a power density of 32 mW L- 1 and 35 mW L- 1, respectively. The increase of the performance of carbon <b>felt</b> <b>material</b> by HNO 3 soaking, can be related to an increases of the surface roughness which favour the adhesion of microorganisms, while taking into account the electro-catalytic properties of polyaniline surface, improvement of current generation seems be due to the increase of the carbon source oxidation.

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation of}} flow conditioning devices used to suppress internal rig noise in high speed, high temperature experimental jet facilities is discussed. The aerodynamic and acoustic {{characteristics of a}} number of devices including pressure loss and extraneous noise generation are measured. Both aerodynamic and acoustic characteristics are strongly dependent on the porosity of the flow conditioner and the closure ratio of the duct system. For unchoked flow conditioners, the pressure loss follows conventional incompressible flow models. However, for choked flow conditioners, a compressible flow model where the duct and flow conditioner system is modeled as a convergent-divergent nozzle can be used to estimate pressure loss. Choked flow conditioners generate significantly more noise than unchoked conditioners.

40|$|Carbon fiber based felt {{materials}} {{are widely used}} as gas diffusion layer (GDL) in fuel cells. Their transport properties can be adjusted by adding hydrophobic agents such as polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE). We present a synchrotron X-ray tomographic study on the <b>felt</b> <b>material</b> Freudenberg H 2315 with different PTFE finishing. In this study, we analyze changes in microstructure and shape of GDLs at increasing degree of compression which are related to their specific PTFE load. A dedicated compression device mimicking the channel-land pattern of the flowfield is used to reproduce the inhomogeneous compression found in a fuel cell. Transport relevant geometrical parameters such as porosity, pore size distribution and geometric tortuosity are calculated and consequences for media transport discussed. PTFE finishing results in a marked change of shape of compressed GDLs: surface is smoothed and the invasion of GDL fibers into the flow field channel strongly mitigated. Furthermore, the PTFE impacts the microstructure of the compressed GDL. The number of available wide transport paths is significantly increased {{as compared to the}} untreated material.

The electroplated surface area was estimated from the charge transfer current ratio for Ce(IV) reduction and related to a theoretical electrosorbed hydrogen monolayer surface area. The platinised titanium felt showed a significant enhancement of active surface area in comparison to conventional electrode materials.

This study considers methods to enhance fashion and textile industry sustainability in accordance to clothing types (material, product life and washing properties) and to investigate company strategies. Company strategies are of redesign with stock, volunteering & measuring trash amount, participation by evaluation stores, clerk environment education, hiring QC specialist and reinforcing partnerships. For the case of daily innerwear, throwing away and recycling is more efficient for the environment than laundering in the consumer use stage; subsequently, we recommend the use of polypropylene fiber (a cheap and an eco-friendly material) for this item that can be recycled and reformed after use. For the case of single layer clothing (such as sportswear, blouse or pants) we rec-ommend the use of thermoplastic materials with welding or fuse assembling technology instead of a sewing method of seams {{as well as the}} recycle design that is simply melted and reformed into new clothing without an after use dissembling process.

40|$|This {{investigation}} was initiated {{to study the}} behavior of materials subjected to vibratory motion. In particular, {{the study was to}} be an investigation of the properties of felt influencing the performance of felt as a vibration isolator. The performance of felt as an isolation materials cannot be predicted with much satisfaction by the classical theory of vibratory motion and vibration isolation. It was assumed that this might be due to the internal damping of felt and that this damping was not of viscous nature. Therefore, this study was started to determine the nature of the internal friction of felt and the importance of this friction in vibratory motion and vibration isolation. Since the performance of felt as a vibration isolator could not be determined by calculation in the design stage by common procedures sued with other vibration isolation materials, another goal {{of the study was to}} set up a simple test procedure and calculation method that would more nearly give results that agree with actual performance. S. A. E. F- 6 felt was tested as a vibration isolator. This material was subjected to forced vibrations of 0. 025 inch amplitudes with frequencies of 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60 cycles per second. Data observed, comprising amplitudes and accelerations of the vibration table and a hanging weight suspended on the <b>felt</b> <b>material,</b> were used to calculate the transmissibility of this material. Each specimen of felt was subjected to forced vibrations once daily over a period of eight days because a pronounced creep effect was observed. The sustained testing was an attempt to determine how long a period of time was required or steady state conditions to be reached. These sustained tests also determined what effects the creep had on the physical characteristics of this material. Advisor: W. L. De Baufr...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Sediment-microbial {{fuel cells}} (S-MFC) are bio-electrochemical devices that {{are able to}} oxidize organic matter {{directly}} into harvestable electrical power. The flux of organic matter into the sediment is rather low, therefore other researchers have introduced plants for a continues supply of organic matter to the anode electrode. Until now only interconnected materials have been considered as anode materials in S-MFC. Here granular carbon materials were investigated for their suitability as anode material in sediment microbial fuel cells. Materials and methods: Laboratory microcosms with 8 different electrode materials (granules, felts and cloths) were examined with controlled organic matter addition under brackish conditions. Current density, organic matter removal and microbial community composition were monitored using 16 S-rRNA gene PCR followed by Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (DGGE). The main parameters investigated were the influence of the amount of electrode material applied to the sediment, the size of the granular material and the electrode configuration. Results and discussion: <b>Felt</b> <b>material</b> had an overall superior performance in terms of current density per amount of applied electrode material i. e. felt and granular anode obtained similar current densities (approx. 50 – 60 mA/m 2) but felt materials required 29 % less material to be applied. Yet, when growing plants, granular carbon is more suited because it is considered to restore, upon disturbance, the electrical connectivity within the anode compartment. Small granules (0. 25 – 0. 5 mm) gave the highest current density compared to larger granules (1 - 5 mm) of the same material. Granules with a rough surface had a better performance compared to smooth granules of the same size. The different granular materials lead to a selection of distinct microbial communities for each material, as shown by DGGE. Conclusions: Granular carbon is suited as anode material for sediment microbial fuel cells. This opens the perspective for application of MFC in cultivated areas. In a wider context, the application of granular carbon electrodes can also be an option for in-situ bioremediation of contaminated soils...|$|E
5000|$|Birds vary {{enormously}} in {{the nests}} they make and the materials they use. Among those that use fibres and fibrous {{materials such as}} grass for nesting, many tend to weave the nests, but even nests that initially are purely woven, {{such as those of}} weaver birds, later are lined with downy materials that largely become felted, both {{with each other and with}} the surrounding nest material. Similarly birds such as sparrows, that build large, twiggy nests, line them with downy material. Many kinds of birds however do little weaving in building their nests, but instead construct their nests mainly of fibrous and downy materials such as fine wool, moss, lichen, spiders' nests, tufts of cotton, arachnoid fluff from plants, or bark scales, supported by twigs or the walls of burrows and the like, depending on the circumstances within which they nest. James Rennie remarked: [...] "A circumstance also never neglected, is to bind the nest firmly into the forks of the bush where it is placed, by twining bands of moss, felted with wool, round all the contiguous branches, both below and at the sides. During the nesting season such birds commonly become such avid seekers of suitable materials that down feathers or tufts of wool may be used as bait for trapping them. Birds that concentrate heavily on felted nests include goldfinches (Carduelis species) and related species. Hummingbirds tend to use a lot of spiderweb together with moss and similar material. Small warbler-like birds of many genera such as Prinia and Cisticola make their nests either heavily lined with, or entirely of <b>felted</b> <b>material.</b> Ground nesting birds often use <b>felted</b> <b>material</b> rather than woven; it usually suffices and some of the structures can be deceptively sophisticated. For example, the common eider, famous for the valuable down harvested from its abandoned nests, lays its eggs in very lightly felted bowls of its own down; simple though this seems, the thick, soft layer provides exceptional insulation.|$|R
