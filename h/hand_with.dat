5|$|Another {{characteristic}} {{attributed to}} the ala is extreme voracity; in the Leskovac region, she was imagined as a monster with a huge mouth and a wooden spoon in her <b>hand,</b> <b>with</b> which she grabbed and devoured whatever came her way. According to a widely spread tradition, ale used to seize children and devour them in her dwelling, which was full of children’s bones and spilt blood. Less often, they attacked and ate adults; {{they were able to}} find a hidden human by smell.|$|E
5|$|At the Flophouse, a wild celebration takes place. Fauna, {{at first}} in the costume of a witch, seems to {{transform}} her costume into that of a Fairy Godmother. After some sleight of <b>hand</b> <b>with</b> the tickets, Doc wins the raffle, {{to the surprise of}} some. When Suzy comes out in a white bride's dress and sings her lines, Doc is unimpressed, and Suzy is humiliated. As both stalk off in opposite directions, the party disintegrates into a brawl.|$|E

The body was identified there as Booth's by more than ten people who knew him.

5|$|During the 36 {{nomination}} years, 128 {{authors have}} had works nominated; 37 {{of them have}} won, including ties and co-authors. Only three authors have won more than once: Elizabeth <b>Hand,</b> <b>with</b> three wins out of eight nominations; Richard Bowes, with two wins out of three nominations; and K. J. Parker, who also won twice out of three nominations. Of authors who have won at least once, Hand has the most nominations, followed by George R. R. Martin at five and Ursula K. Le Guin at four. Lucius Shepard has the most nominations without winning and the most overall at ten; he is followed by Kim Newman, who has six nominations without winning.|$|E
5|$|During the Eastern Han, peasants {{could avoid}} {{the month of}} annual conscripted labor by paying a tax in {{commutation}} (gengfu 更賦). This development went hand in <b>hand</b> <b>with</b> {{the increasing use of}} hired labor by the government. In a similar manner, because the Eastern-Han government favored the military recruitment of volunteers, the mandatory military draft for peasants aged twenty-three could be avoided by paying a tax in substitution.|$|E
2500|$|If {{there are}} [...] {{people who can}} shake <b>hands</b> <b>with</b> one another (where [...] ), the {{pigeonhole}} principle shows that {{there is always a}} pair of people who will shake <b>hands</b> <b>with</b> the same number of people. In this application of the principle, the 'hole' to which a person is assigned is the number of hands shaken by that person. Since each person shakes <b>hands</b> <b>with</b> some number of people from 0 to , there are [...] possible holes. On the other hand, either the '0' hole or the [...] hole or both must be empty, for it is impossible (if !) for some person to shake <b>hands</b> <b>with</b> everybody else while some person shakes <b>hands</b> <b>with</b> nobody. This leaves [...] people to be placed in at most [...] non-empty holes, so that the principle applies.|$|R

5|$|England batted {{again and}} Tallon {{dismissed}} George Emmett from Lindwall with a diving one-handed catch. Lindwall pitched an outswinger on the off stump and Emmett edged it to wicket-keeper Tallon, {{who took it}} in his right <b>hand</b> <b>with</b> a dive, leaving England at 1/1. England then declared at 3/174; Tallon conceded nine byes and {{with more than a}} day was lost to rain, Tallon was not required as Australia batted out the last session for a draw.|$|E
5|$|In England's second innings, Gooch {{played a}} lone <b>hand.</b> <b>With</b> the {{exception}} of Foster (34), promoted as nightwatchman {{at the end of}} day two, no-one else passed 15. When Gooch was last man out for 84 on the third day, England had compiled 202. The England bowlers managed to restrain the West Indian batsmen, Childs notably bowling 40 overs for just 79 runs, but, with more than two days left to play, there was little pressure on the West Indies, and they strolled to victory in 91 overs, losing just two wickets, with more than a day to spare.|$|E
5|$|In {{the mid-19th}} century brass bands had a poor {{relationship}} with the Nonconformist chapels, mainly due to the heavy social drinking that came hand in <b>hand</b> <b>with</b> {{being a member of}} a band. This changed {{towards the end of the}} 19th century, and as well as becoming more respectable, many bands had actually joined the temperance movement. Two of the more well known brass bands from the Rhondda both started as temperance bands. The more famous, Cory Band from Ton Pentre, started life as Ton Temperance in 1884; while local rivals The Parc and Dare Band were the Cwmparc Drum and Fife Temperance Band.|$|E

Meechum remains fiercely loyal, however; he warns Underwood's biographer Tom Yates (Paul Sparks) not to write anything that would damage Underwood's reputation. In season 4, Underwood traces Meechum's <b>hand</b> <b>with</b> a marker on one of the walls of the White House when he wants to replace a Confederate painting; Meechum suggests he put up something he likes instead.|$|E
5|$|Research {{work on the}} Book of the Dead {{has always}} posed {{technical}} difficulties thanks {{to the need to}} copy very long hieroglyphic texts. Initially, these were copied out by <b>hand,</b> <b>with</b> the assistance either of tracing paper or a camera lucida. In the mid-19th century, hieroglyphic fonts became available and made lithographic reproduction of manuscripts more feasible. In the present day, hieroglyphics can be rendered in desktop publishing software and this, combined with digital print technology, means that the costs of publishing a Book of the Dead may be considerably reduced. However, a very large amount of the source material in museums around the world remains unpublished.|$|E
5|$|Shepherd was {{the singer}} on Wellwater Conspiracy's 1997 debut studio album, Declaration of Conformity, but left the band in 1998.

Shepherd and Cameron lent a <b>hand</b> <b>with</b> {{recording}} Tony Iommi's album IOMMI (2000).

5|$|The {{holding up}} of one <b>hand</b> <b>with</b> middle and index fingers crossed {{was the usual}} gesture found in New Zealand in 1999–2001. The T-shape was also used when saying {{time-out}}. The time-out gesture is made with two hands - one hand held horizontally, palm down, the other hand vertically with the fingertips touching {{the bottom of the}} horizontal hand. In the US, although the more modern time-out has largely supplanted traditional terms, often accompanied by the time-out gesture, the crossed fingers gesture remains common.|$|E
5|$|The {{improvements}} {{of animal}} husbandry {{in the medieval}} period in Europe went hand in <b>hand</b> <b>with</b> other developments. Improvements to the plough allowed the soil to be tilled to a greater depth. Horses took over from oxen as the main providers of traction, new ideas on crop rotation were developed and the growing of crops for winter fodder gained ground. Peas, beans and vetches became common; they increased soil fertility through nitrogen fixation, allowing more livestock to be kept.|$|E
5|$|The scenes Ubisoft removed depict anal probing by {{aliens and}} the player-character {{performing}} an abortion. In their place, the game displays a still {{image of a}} statue holding its face in its <b>hand,</b> <b>with</b> an explicit description of events depicted in the scene. In Australia, the same scenes were removed because the Australian Classification Board refused to rate the game for release due to the depiction of sexual violencespecifically the child player-character being subjected to anal probing and the interactive abortion scene. Like the European version, these scenes were replaced with a placeholder card with an explanation of what was removed on a background image of a koala crying.|$|E
