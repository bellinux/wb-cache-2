60|$|When the few birds {{had called}} in the August morning, when the cocks had {{finished}} their crowing, when the minute sounds of the early day were astir, Siegmund shivered disconsolate. He felt tired again, yet {{he knew he could}} not sleep. The bed was repulsive to him. He sat in his chair at the open <b>door,</b> <b>moving</b> uneasily. What should have been sleep was an ache and a restlessness. He turned and twisted in his chair.|$|E

50|$|Gap fillers {{were placed}} at <b>doors</b> and <b>moving</b> {{surfaces}} to minimize heating by preventing {{the formation of}} vortices. <b>Doors</b> and <b>moving</b> surfaces created open gaps in the heat protection system {{that had to be}} protected from heat. Some of these gaps were safe, but there were some areas on the heat shield where surface pressure gradients caused a crossflow of boundary layer air in those gaps.|$|R
50|$|About 1960, however, {{a change}} {{occurred}} as Hubley became {{known for its}} detailed metal car kits, which were unique in a market of dominantly plastic offerings. Hubley even set up its Scale Model Division for these products. These metal kits, issued in various scales, were more expensive than plastic models, and, when finished, were naturally quite heavy. Complexity in detail was often seen - with opening hoods, <b>doors,</b> <b>moving</b> phaeton panels, and detailed engines and chassis.|$|R

60|$|By {{this time}} all the engines of the {{district}} in which the fire had occurred, and one {{from each of the}} two adjoining districts, had arrived, and were in full play, and one by one the individual men from the distant stations came dropping in and reported themselves to Dale, Mr Braidwood not being present on that occasion. There was thus a strong force of fresh firemen on the ground, and these, as they came up, were sent--in military parlance--to relieve skirmishers.

The rail safety regulator, the Rail Standards and Safety Board has said that “We have 30 years of data which we have analysed. We have found that the driver performing the task does not increase the risk to passengers at all.” In 2016, the RMT and Aslef unions went on strike over the changes, causing severe disruption to Southern services.

5000|$|A unique [...] "roll-up" [...] system {{generally}} {{defines a}} high-speed door from a conventional roller door. The door's main {{objective is to}} produce a high opening speed and the guiding system must allow smooth operations with minimal friction. Effortless movement will ensure the longevity of the <b>door's</b> <b>moving</b> parts and operating soundness. The latest versions of high quality high-speed doors use a spiral guiding system, thus keeping the door blade apart through a whole operating cycle, ensuring effortless movement of the door's roller devices in the guiding system and contributing to the excessive high speed. Excessive because these doors, by opening so fast and closing very slowly, {{are just trying to}} avoid getting their rigid closing edge caught by a forklift, {{at the expense of the}} insulation.|$|R
50|$|The {{most common}} garage door {{to date in}} Australia is the B&D Rolla Door, having been around since 1956 and still in heavy use today. They are a {{corrugated}} flexible but strong sheet steel door, sliding up tracks and rolling around a drum mounted above the door opening {{on the inside of}} the garage. These come in manual and remote controlled electric (known as the Control-a-Door), with conversion kits available. Locking is provided by a key lock in the centre of the <b>door</b> <b>moving</b> two square sliding lock bars in and out of holes in the door tracks, locking and unlocking it, or by the solenoid lock in the automatic motor.|$|E
50|$|Unloading also poses its {{own special}} hazards, due to the {{requirement}} that the farmer regularly climb the silo to close an upper door and open a lower <b>door,</b> <b>moving</b> the unloader chute from door to door in the process. The fermentation of the silage produces methane gas which over time will outgas and displace the oxygen {{in the top of}} the silo. A farmer directly entering a silo without any other precautions can be asphyxiated by the methane, knocked unconscious, and silently suffocate to death before anyone else knows what has happened. It is either necessary to leave the silo blower attached to the silo at all times to use it when necessary to ventilate the silo with fresh air, or to have a dedicated electric fan system to blow fresh air into the silo, before anyone attempts to enter it.|$|E
5000|$|The job's name {{is derived}} {{from the fact that the}} hotel's front desk clerk rang a bell to summon an employee, who would [...] "" [...] (jump) to {{attention}} at the desk to receive instructions. The term [...] "porter" [...] is used in the United Kingdom and much of the English-speaking world. [...] "Bellboy" [...] or [...] "bellhop" [...] is an American English term. This employee traditionally was a boy or adolescent male, hence the term bellboy. Today's bellhops must be quick-witted, good with people, and outgoing. Bellhops will meet a variety of different people each day and must have the social skills to deal with them. Duties often include opening the front <b>door,</b> <b>moving</b> luggage, valeting cars, calling cabs, transporting guests, giving directions, performing basic concierge work, and responding to the guest's needs. They must be able to escort guests into their rooms while carrying luggage, or help move any baggage a customer needs.|$|E

50|$|Engelbert {{first saw}} Lynne Roberts {{in one of}} her {{pictures}} in 1940 and decided she was the woman for him. But instead of attempting to crash her studio, he obtained her address, 115 N. Kilkea Dr, Los Angeles, CA 90048, where she lived with her parents and brother. Engelbert drove past her house daily. One morning, he saw the family next <b>door</b> <b>moving</b> out. Whereupon Engelbert moved in, got an introduction and wooed and won the pretty actress—all within a month. They married January 5, 1941. On April 6, 1942, their son was born. Scenario writers at Twentieth Century-Fox were put to work preparing an untitled original screen play, based on this real life romance. The studio liked the script and planned to film it, although no film was ever made. Engelbert and Lynne Roberts divorced, December 14, 1944. Lynne Roberts' second marriage to Louis John Gardella also ended in divorce. In court, Gardella's attorney argued that the couple's Arizona wedding was invalid because Roberts was not legally divorced from William Engelbert Jr., although Roberts claimed she had a Mexican divorce decree.|$|E
5|$|Between March 1926 and September 1928, the CLR {{converted}} the remaining gate stock carriages in phases. The end platforms were enclosed {{to provide additional}} passenger accommodation and two sliding doors were inserting in each side. The conversions increased capacity and allowed the CLR to remove gatemen from the train crews, with responsibility for controlling <b>doors</b> <b>moving</b> to the two guards who each managed half the train. Finally, the introduction of driver/guard communications in 1928 allowed the CLR to dispense with the second guard, reducing a train crew to just a driver and a guard. The addition of doors in the sides of cars caused problems at Wood Lane where {{the length of the}} platform {{on the inside of the}} returning curve was limited by an adjacent access track into the depot. The problem was solved by the introduction of a pivoted section of platform which usually sat above the access track and allowed passengers to board trains as normal, but which could be moved to allow access to the depot.|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{motivated}} by the possible benefits of a more precise trawl control system with respect to both environmental impact and fishing efficiency. It considers how the control performance of a pelagic trawl system can be improved, partly by introducing a control architecture tailor-made for the trawl system subject to industrial requirements, and partly by developing a trawl door control concept. A mathematical model of the trawl system is developed, including an accurate model of the hydrodynamic forces on the trawl doors. This model estimates both the steady state and the transient forces on trawl <b>doors</b> <b>moving</b> in six degrees of freedom. The steady state hydrodynamic forces are based on wind tunnel experiments. To estimate the transient forces, a software code based on potential theory is developed. This software estimates the time-dependency of the forces from circulation about the foil, the angular damping forces, and the forces from relative accelerations between the fluid and the trawl door. Various concepts for trawl door control are evaluated. This is done both analytically, by simulations and by towing tank experiments. Based on the results, a new trawl doo...|$|R
5000|$|In April 2016, Southern {{introduced}} a new method of door operation, with control of the <b>doors</b> <b>moving</b> from the conductor to the driver. Southern also proposed that, following the changes to the door operation, that conductors would now take on an [...] "on-board supervisor role", which would enable conductors {{to be able to}} concentrate on the passengers more as opposed to the doors, but the RMT and ASLEF union described this as an attempt to make conductors unnecessary, and would also be unsafe. However, the rail safety regulator, the Rail Safety and Standards Board, said that [...] "We have 30 years of data which we have analysed. We have found that the driver performing the task does not increase the risk to passengers at all." [...] The BBC suggested that the RMT union are particularly worried about the new method of operation because if drivers, rather than conductors, control the doors then trains could run without conductors and any strike by conductors would not have the power to cancel trains. As a result of this, the RMT and Aslef unions went on strike over the changes, causing severe disruption to Southern services.|$|R
