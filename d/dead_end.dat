5|$|After this intersection, Old Baltimore Pike {{continues}} past suburban neighborhoods, {{gaining a}} center left-turn lane and intersecting Salem Church Road. Farther east, the highway reaches a junction with DE 273 in a wooded area. At this point, the road narrows to two lanes again and {{heads into the}} community of Christiana. Here, the highway intersects DE 7, where it turns north and follows that route through residential areas. The road comes to an interchange with DE 1 {{to the west of}} the Christiana Mall, where DE 7 continues north along with DE 1 and Old Baltimore Pike reaches a <b>dead</b> <b>end.</b>|$|E

Here, the highway connects to a pair of dirt roads, one of which leads north alongside Horseshoe Lake to Horseshoe. The two-lane route heads eastward from the trails, following the southern shore of Horseshoe Lake while traversing the deep woods of Adirondack Park. At the southeastern end of the lake, NY421 turns northeastward, crossing a small stream feeding into the lake before curving back toward the east. For the next , the road passes through unabated wilderness as it heads toward the western shoreline of Tupper Lake.|$|E

The washed-out section of Valley Drive was never repaired, leaving Valley Drive as two separate <b>dead</b> <b>end</b> streets. The New York State Department of Transportation has made plans to remove the bridge carrying Valley Drive (former NY31C) over Skaneateles Creek {{in the town of}} Elbridge. Demolition of the structure is scheduled to begin in mid-2014 and cost $300,000. Once removed, the bridge, built in 1921, will not be replaced.|$|E

5|$|The {{entirety}} of SR357 exists {{within the confines}} of South Bass Island in Lake Erie. It is located within Put-in-Bay Township in Ottawa County. In 2012, between 490 and 590 vehicles travel on the road on average each day. SR 357 begins at West Shore Boulevard, and travels southwestward. The route passes by Oak Point State Park, and becomes part of Bayview Avenue. SR 357 then intersects County Route 163, which leads to the Put-in-Bay Airport, and the Put-in-Bay–Catawba Island ferry. The route later leaves Put-in-Bay, near Perry's Victory and International Peace Memorial. SR 357 turns northeast to Columbus Avenue, and later ends at a <b>dead</b> <b>end</b> near the lake, next to a driveway.|$|E

The band then recorded their comeback and final album, the influential Mamatay sa Ingay (1995); it had a sound different from their past materials, having more of a crossover-thrash approach. <b>Dead</b> <b>Ends</b> disbanded in 1996 (because of Jay Dimalanta's passing), after which de Veyra briefly became a member of Al Dimalanta's new band Throw (band); the band also included de Veyra's brother Francis, who played the bass.

By the 25th, 45 days after the beginning of the operation, the remainder of the South Vietnamese force that had survived had left Laos behind. The forward base at Khe Sanh had also come under increasing artillery bombardment and sapper attacks and by 6 April it was abandoned and Operation Lam Son 719 was over.|$|E
5|$|Though sound-on-film would {{eventually}} become the universal standard for synchronized sound cinema, Lauste never successfully exploited his innovations, {{which came to}} an effective <b>dead</b> <b>end.</b> In 1914, Finnish inventor Eric Tigerstedt was granted German patent 309,536 for his sound-on-film work; that same year, he apparently demonstrated a film made with the process {{to an audience of}} scientists in Berlin. Hungarian engineer Denes Mihaly submitted his sound-on-film Projectofon concept to the Royal Hungarian Patent Court in 1918; the patent award was published four years later. Whether sound was captured on cylinder, disc, or film, none of the available technology was adequate for big-league commercial purposes, and for many years the heads of the major Hollywood film studios saw little benefit in producing sound motion pictures.|$|E
5|$|However, Elton ends {{up being}} cornered in a <b>dead</b> <b>end</b> alley. As he resigns himself to being absorbed, the TARDIS materializes and the Doctor and Rose emerge from within. The Abzorbaloff {{attempts}} to ransom Elton {{in exchange for the}} Doctor, but the Doctor feigns disinterest in Elton's fate, while dropping a hint to the absorbed members of LINDA. In response, the absorbed members collectively use their willpower to suppress the Abzorbaloff, who ends up dropping his cane. At Ursula's prompting, Elton breaks the cane, which causes the Abzorbaloff to melt into the ground. The Doctor explains that the cane created a limitation field to suppress the alien's power, but with it broken, he lost control and his power caused him to be absorbed by the ground. The Doctor then recalls his first encounter with Elton, and explains that he was at Elton's house years ago tracking an elemental shade, but he was too late and the shade killed Elton's mother.|$|E
40|$|Stochastic Shortest Path (SSP) MDPs is {{a problem}} class widely studied in AI, {{especially}} in probabilistic planning. They describe {{a wide range of}} scenarios but make the restrictive assumption that the goal is reachable from any state, i. e., that dead-end states do not exist. Because of this, SSPs are unable to model various scenarios that may have catastrophic events (e. g., an airplane possibly crashing if it flies into a storm). Even though MDP algorithms have been used for solving problems with <b>dead</b> <b>ends,</b> a principled theory of SSP extensions that would allow <b>dead</b> <b>ends,</b> including theoretically sound algorithms for solving such MDPs, has been lacking. In this paper, we propose three new MDP classes that admit <b>dead</b> <b>ends</b> under increasingly weaker assumptions. We present Value Iteration-based as well as the more efficient heuristic search algorithms for optimally solving each class, and explore theoretical relationships between these classes. We also conduct a preliminary empirical study comparing the performance of our algorithms on different MDP classes, especially on scenarios with unavoidable <b>dead</b> <b>ends.</b> ...|$|R
