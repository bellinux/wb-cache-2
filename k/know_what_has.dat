Upon {{arriving}} in Angmar, the player finds Corunir safe in a friendly Hillmen village. He begs the player to find his lost company, who passed through Rammas Deluon: a great series of statues that weaken (or even kill) those who pass it. After destroying the spirits within them, the player becomes able to resist the power of Rammas Deluon, and finds a hidden Dwarf settlement, where {{a part of the}} scattered party lives.|$|E
25|$|While {{the family}} may never <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>has</b> {{happened}} to Caylee Marie Anthony, {{they now have}} closure for this chapter of their life. They will now begin the long process of rebuilding their lives. Despite the baseless defense chosen by Casey Anthony, the family believes that the Jury made a fair decision {{based on the evidence}} presented, the testimony presented, the scientific information presented and the rules that were given to them by the Honorable Judge Perry to guide them. The family hopes that they will be given the time by the media to reflect on this verdict and decide the best way to move forward privately.|$|E
500|$|Halo 3 {{was officially}} {{announced}} via a cinematic trailer rendered in real-time, shown at Microsoft's press conference at E3 2006 on May 9. The trailer {{is set in}} the dry plains of Africa, with the ruins of a space elevator and other damage visible. The Master Chief is slowly revealed walking through smoke and dust, occasionally obscured by distorted images of the artificial intelligence Cortana transmitting a message composed of portions of the character's lines in the Cortana Letters, as well as a line from the poem [...] "The Hollow Men". The distorted voice of Cortana was a deliberate clue to the character's predicament in Halo 3, with a Bungie staff member stating, [...] "We don't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>has</b> happened to her...We don't know it's Cortana. It could be any sort of bizarre, almost Satanic sort of voice. Something seems wrong." [...] The trailer featured music by Martin O'Donnell, {{with the addition of a}} piano and brass section to the classic Halo theme.|$|E

2500|$|Bhopal's {{superintendent}} of police was informed by telephone, by a town inspector, that {{residents of the}} neighbourhood of Chola (about 2km from the plant) were fleeing a gas leak at approximately 1 a.m. Calls to the UCIL plant by police between 1:25 and 2:10a.m. gave assurances twice that [...] "everything is OK", and on the last attempt made, [...] "we don't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>has</b> happened, sir". With the lack of timely information exchange between UCIL and Bhopal authorities, the city's Hamidia Hospital was first told that the gas leak was suspected to be ammonia, then phosgene. They were then told that it was [...] "MIC", which hospital staff had never heard of, had no antidote for, and received no immediate information about.|$|E
2500|$|His wife Ellen's failing health, due to kidney failure, worsened in {{the spring}} of 1914; after a fall, she was bedridden, then rallied briefly, but Wilson wrote [...] "my dear one… grows weaker and weaker, with a pathetic {{patience}} and sweetness." [...] He was at her bedside to the end, which came August 6, when Wilson despairingly said [...] "Oh my God, what am I to do." [...] Wilson later wrote accurately of his mourning and depression, [...] "Of course you <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>has</b> happened to me…God has stricken me almost beyond what I can bear". Six months of depression followed for him, though mourning continued. At the same time that Wilson's private world shattered, World War I broke out in Europe, and this momentously changed his political life.|$|E
2500|$|Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy {{said in a}} {{statement}} [...] "the world has a right to know" [...] who fired the missile that brought down Malaysia Airlines plane in pro-Russian separatist territory in eastern Ukraine, the world has a right to know who carried out this [...] "barbaric act" [...] and the world has a right to <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>has</b> happened and everybody will have {{to do everything possible to}} make sure that a savage act like this doesn't happen again". Earlier the Spanish Foreign Ministry expressed its condolences and said it shared the pain of families and loved ones of the 298 victims. Spain hopes an investigation can explain the circumstances of the accident as quickly as possible and we urged the parties involved to participate fully in the investigation.|$|E

2500|$|... 'What is necessary', writes Gleizes, 'is to take {{everything}} up {{again from the}} foundations and to start out from the unquestionable reality of two currents which, unaware of each other, were finally enfolded under a single heading, the movement that was called 'Cubism'. You can then avoid confusion if, right from the start, you make the distinctions that must, in all honesty, be acknowledged. The history of the 'Bâteau Lavoir' belongs {{to those who were}} part of that particular grouping. Personally, I only <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>has</b> been said about this history; I do not know the details, nor did my comrades of the other group Metzinger, Delaunay, Le Fauconnier and Léger... But what I do know well, because I lived it and remember it perfectly, is the origin of our relations and their development to 1914, passing by the notorious Room 41 of the Indépendants of 1911, which provoked the 'involuntary scandal' out of which Cubism really emerged and spread in Paris, in France and through the world...

2500|$|Shakespeare {{also drew}} on various {{sources for the}} names {{of many of his}} characters. For example, Titus could have been named after the Emperor Titus Flavius Vespasianus, who ruled Rome from 79 to 81. Jonathan Bate speculates that the name Andronicus could have come from Andronicus V Palaeologus, co-emperor of Byzantium from 1403 to 1407, but, since {{there is no reason to}} suppose that Shakespeare might have come across these emperors, it is more likely that he took the name from the story [...] "Andronicus and the lion" [...] in Antonio de Guevara's Epistolas familiares. That story {{involves}} a sadistic emperor named Titus who amused himself by throwing slaves to wild animals and watching them be slaughtered. However, when a slave called Andronicus is thrown to a lion, the lion lies down and embraces the man. The emperor demands to <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>has</b> happened, and Andronicus explains that he had once helped the lion by removing a thorn from its foot. Bate speculates that this story, with one character called Titus and another called Andronicus, could be why several contemporary references to the play are in the form Titus & ondronicus.|$|E
