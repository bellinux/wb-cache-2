50|$|Philosophically, Clarke {{demonstrated}} {{an affinity for}} legal realism in his opinions. He often voted with Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. and Louis Brandeis, usually in dissent from the conservative majority dominant on the Court at that time, though Holmes's famous dissent from the Abrams v. United States decision {{was in response to}} Clarke's majority opinion. As a Progressive, he supported the power of both national and state authorities to regulate the economy, particularly with regard to regulating child labor. His dissents on two cases, Hammer v. Dagenhart and Bailey v. Drexel Furniture Company supported Congress's authority under the Commerce Clause (in the <b>Hammer</b> <b>case)</b> and the Taxing and Spending Clause (in the Bailey case) to address what Progressives saw as a major social problem. He also demonstrated his opposition to monopoly in United States v. Reading Company, in a ruling that became a prominent part of anti-trust law.|$|E

40|$|This paper reviews {{a number}} of {{unsteady}} friction models for transient pipe flow. Two distinct unsteady friction models, the Zielke and the Brunone models, are investigated in detail. The Zielke model, originally developed for transient laminar flow, has been selected to verify its effectiveness for "low Reynolds number" transient turbulent flow. The Brunone model combines local inertia and wall friction unsteadiness. This model is verified using the Vardy's analytically deduced shear decay coefficient C* to predict the Brunone's friction coefficient k rather than use the traditional {{trial and error method}} for estimating k. The two unsteady friction models have been incorporated into the method of characteristics water hammer algorithm. Numerical results from the quasi-steady friction model and the Zielke and the Brunone unsteady friction models are compared with results of laboratory measurements for water <b>hammer</b> <b>cases</b> with laminar and low Reynolds number turbulent flows. Conclusions about the range of validity for the three friction models are drawn. In addition, the convergence and stability of these models are addressed.

40|$|This work {{describes}} a coupling between the 1 D {{method of characteristics}} (MOC) and the 3 D finite volume method of computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The coupling method is applied to compressible flow in hydraulic systems. The MOC code is implemented {{as a set of}} boundary conditions in the OpenFOAM open source CFD software. The coupling is realized by two linear equations originating from the characteristics equation and the Riemann constant equation, respectively. The coupling method is validated using three simple water <b>hammer</b> <b>cases</b> and several coupling configurations. The accuracy and robustness are investigated with respect to the mesh size ratio across the interface and to 3 D flow features close to the interface. The method is finally applied to the transient flow caused by the closing and opening of a knife valve (gate) in a pipe, where the flow is driven by the difference in free surface elevation between two tanks. A small region surrounding the moving gate is resolved by CFD, using a dynamic mesh library, {{while the rest of the}} system is modeled by MOC. Minor losses are included in the 1 D region, corresponding to the contraction of the flow from the upstream tank into the pipe, a separate stationary flow regulation valve, and a pipe bend. The results are validated with experimental data. A 1 D solution is provided for comparison, using the static gate characteristics obtained from steady-state CFD simulations...|$|R

Paper is focused on design of protection against water <b>hammer</b> in <b>case</b> of sudden pumps trip. Numerical simulation {{of the most dangerous}} case (when pumps are giving the maximal flow rate) showed that existing air vessels were not able to protect the system and it would be necessary to add new vessels. Special care was paid to influence of their connection to the main pipeline, because the resistance of the connection has {{a significant impact on the}} scale of pressure pulsations. Finally, the pump trip was performed to verify if the system worked correctly. The test showed that pressure pulsations are lower (better) than computation predicted.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} the water distribution systems optimization by selecting the optimal pipe diameters for water hammer transients. The optimization method used is the Genetic Algorithm (GA). The GA’s {{have been used}} in solving the water network optimization for steady state conditions. The GA is integrated with the steady state hydraulic analysis program and a transient analysis program to improve the search for the optimal diameters under certain constraints. These include the minimum allowable pressure head constraints at the nodes for the steady state flow, and the minimum and maximum allowable pressure heads constraints for the water <b>hammer.</b> Three <b>cases</b> are studied including the following causes of water distribution transients: changes in water demands at the nodes, sudden valve closure and pump power failure. The application of the computer program to the studied cases shows the suitability of the method to find the least cost in a favorable number of function evaluations. This technique can be used in the first stages of the design of water distribution networks to protect it from the water hammer damages. The technique is very economical as the network design can be achieved without using hydraulic devices for water hammer control...|$|R

50|$|Like any complex process, {{mistakes}} in handloading {{are easy to}} make. A bullet puller allows the handloader to disassemble mistakes. Most pullers use inertia to pull the bullet; they are shaped like <b>hammers,</b> and the <b>case</b> is locked in place inside. A sharp blow on a hard surface will suddenly stop the case, and the inertia of the heavy bullet will pull it free of the case in a few blows, trapping the powder and bullet {{in the body of}} the puller. Collet type pullers are also available, which use a caliber-specific clamp to grip the bullet, while the loading press is used to pull the case downwards. It is essential that the collet be a good match for the bullet diameter, because a poor match can result in significant deformation of the bullet.|$|R
5000|$|... "The breech-loading carbine {{was invented}} and {{patented}} in Greensboro, N.C. by Jere H. Tarpley. He received a C.S.A. patent on February 14, 1863, {{and his name}} appears on the barrel tang. He joined J. &F. Garrett & Co. to make carbines {{for the state of}} North Carolina. The carbines were made for about one year with their production amounting to only a few hundred. The carbine had a unique design which enabled this arm to be made with a file. The frame was unfinished brass with a copper color. The barrel was blued and the <b>hammer</b> was <b>case</b> hardened. The major flaw in the carbine was that it does not have a gas seal to prevent the escape of highly erosive gases between the breech-block and the barrel when fired. With each firing, the gap between the breech-block and the barrel would be larger. The carbine used paper ammunition. Although the carbine was made mainly for the state, it was also sold commercially. It is the only Confederate firearm sold to the public. The Tarpley was attractive in appearance, but it was not very serviceable. Clap, Gates & Co. was ten miles from the Garrett operation in Greensboro. The hammer and other parts could have been supplied by Clapp, Gates & Co."

40|$|The {{decision}} in the Child Labor Law <b>case,</b> <b>Hammer</b> v. Dagenhart, - U. S. -, 62 L. ed. -, decided June 3, 1918, would have caused much less surprise twenty-five years ago than it did when announced last June, for it is based upon two constitutional provisions concerning which the much wider and more varied experience of the last quarter century had developed theories, better defined and sounder {{than those of the}} earlier period. Those two provisions are the Tenth Amendment regarding the powers reserved to the States and the Commerce Clause. There has been an astonishing amount of faulty reasoning about the Tenth Amendment in its relation to Federal powers. Over and over again courts and writers have argued as if certain powers, or powers of certain kinds had been reserved to the States and therefore that the Federal Government could not possibly have or exercise powers that touched those fields; or, to put it otherwise, that the Federal Government could not exercise even its granted powers, as those over commerce or to make treaties, if such exercise would affect matters concerning which the States also possessed power. But this is a diametrically wrong way to approach the distribution of powers between the Federal and the State Governments. Certain powers have been given to the Federal Government.
