50|$|Crickets {{are usually}} housed in small (4' x 8') containers, {{furnished}} with simple items like egg cartons to provide shelter. Heat {{is a necessity}} for breeding crickets as they require temperatures around 90° Fahrenheit. House crickets live up to about eight weeks. Until they are twenty days old they are fed high protein animal feed, most commonly chicken feed, that contains between 14% and 20% protein. In the days before harvesting the crickets at around forty to fifty days old, they are often fed various vegetables, fruits and other plant matter. This is done to improve {{the taste of the}} insects and reduce the use of expensive, high protein animal feed. Crickets are normally killed by <b>deep</b> <b>freezing,</b> where they feel no pain and are sedated before neurological death. In {{some parts of the world}} crickets are baked or boiled.|$|E
5000|$|Other {{methods used}} {{in modern times}} include the Silicone S 10 Standard Procedure, the Cor-Tech Room {{temperature}} procedure, the Epoxy E 12 procedure, and the Polyester P 35 (P 40) procedure. The Silicone S 10 is the procedure most often used in plastination and creates opaque, natural-looking specimen. Dow Corning Corporation's Cor-Tech Room Temperature Procedure is designed to allow plastination of specimen at room temperature to various degrees of flexibility using three combinations of polymer, crosslinker and catalyst. According to the International Society for Plastination, the Epoxy E 12 procedure is utilized [...] "for thin, transparent, and firm body and organ slices", while the Polyster P 35 (P 40) preserves [...] "semitransparent and firm brain slices". Samples are prepared for fixation through the first method by <b>deep</b> <b>freezing,</b> while the second method works best following 4-6 weeks of preparation in a formaldehyde mixture.|$|E

Will tells the two that he doesn’t {{know anything about the}} ice wall around Storybrooke, but reveals that he went into the ice cream parlor while the electricity was out, and saw that despite the blackout, the products in the back were still frozen. When they arrive at the shop, however, they find the kitchen area in <b>deep</b> <b>freezing</b> temperatures, but Will sneaks off and take the money from the register. Meanwhile, Hook decides to take Elsa to Gold's Pawn Shop instead, where he tells his former archenemy that he knows about the Dagger of Kris that Gold still has in his possession, and promises to keep it a secret, but only on the condition that they find out where they can locate the real suspect, and hopefully, find Anna. Using a piece of Marian's hair strands, Gold casts a spell to serve as a tracer to origin of the freezing spell cast on it. Elsa and Hook are able to trace it back to the Snow Queen in the forest, but as Hook tries to contact Emma with a cellphone, and later by person, the Snow Queen traps Hook's legs in ice, and when she tries to kill Hook with sharp icicles, she tells Elsa that she neutralized her powers, to keep her from interfering. Then, she discovers that Elsa has lost her memories. She tells Elsa that the Rock Trolls wiped her memory, while trying to convince her that it was Anna who had placed her in the urn. As the Snow Queen prepares to use an ice attack on Hook, Emma arrives just in time to use her powers, allowing the Snow Queen to get away upon getting distracted by helping David free Hook before the large icicles could fall on him. Emma was surprised that the Snow Queen knew Emma's name, but Elsa suspects that the Snow Queen might be lying about her remembering their past experience and about her past with Emma, although Emma assures Elsa they'll find out together. Later that night, the Snow Queen is approached by Gold, who asks if Emma remembers her. As it turns out, Gold tells her that Emma will remember her eventually, but when he asked if she needs his help, the Snow Queen declined, and stated that when she's ready to make a deal, she'll come to him. Gold says that he eagerly awaits that moment and walks away. As Emma tries to remember her past encounter with the Snow Queen, Hook confronts her, and explains that after losing Neal, Graham and Walsh, {{she did not want to}} lose Hook either.
