Site Design Group designed the pavilion's ornamentation and railings and obtained its traditional Chinese roof tiles from a source in Japan. The park's entrance is marked by four -tall columns, each etched with Chinese dragons and <b>is</b> <b>modeled</b> after a traditional Chinese courtyard.

5|$|At {{the local}} level, the island's 22 provinces are {{administered}} by a governor and provincial council. Provinces are further sub-divided into regions and communes. The judiciary <b>is</b> <b>modeled</b> on the French system, with a High Constitutional Court, High Court of Justice, Supreme Court, Court of Appeals, criminal tribunals, and tribunals of first instance. The courts, which adhere to civil law, lack {{the capacity to}} quickly and transparently try the cases in the judicial system, often forcing defendants to pass lengthy pretrial detentions in unsanitary and overcrowded prisons.|$|E
5|$|Gunnerkrigg Court {{is set in}} a {{boarding}} school in a country that resembles the United Kingdom, identifiable from the grey skies and mandatory uniforms. The comic contains other clues about the setting, such as the house system that is described {{at the end of the}} first chapter.

5|$|Six Flags designers' {{decorative}} theme {{attempts to}} capture the spirit of Batman's world for those queuing to board the ride. As the queue moves through Gotham City Park, the theme becomes more ominous. Modeled after Anton Furst's award-winning set design for the original Batman film, the atmosphere indicates a crime-ridden and dirty environment, with wrecked cars, discarded pieces of equipment, crumbling concrete, and a Gotham City Police car riddled with bullet holes. The queue then enters the ride structure. The ride passenger loading area <b>is</b> <b>modeled</b> on Batman's Batcave, and features {{a replica of the}} Batsuit from the 1989 film.|$|E
5|$|The Rumtek Monastery on the {{outskirts}} of the town is one of Buddhism's most sacred monasteries. The monastery is the seat of the Kagyu order, one of the major Tibetan sects, and houses some of the world's most sacred and rare Tibetan Buddhist scriptures and religious objects in its reliquary. Constructed in the 1960s, the building <b>is</b> <b>modeled</b> after a similar monastery in Lhasa, Tibet. Rumtek was the focus of international media attention in 2000 after the seventeenth Karmapa, one of the four holiest lamas, fled Lhasa and sought refuge in the monastery.|$|E
5|$|The Sci-Fi Dine-In Theater Restaurant is a theme {{restaurant}} at Disney's Hollywood Studios, {{one of the}} four main theme parks at Walt Disney World in Bay Lake, Florida, United States. Established in May 1991, the restaurant <b>is</b> <b>modeled</b> after a 1950s drive-in theater. Walt Disney Imagineering designed the booths to resemble convertibles of the period, and some servers act as carhops while wearing roller skates. While eating, guests watch a large projection screen displaying film clips from such 1950s and 1960s films as Frankenstein Meets the Space Monster, Plan 9 from Outer Space, and Attack of the 50 Foot Woman.|$|E

In Checkpoint, other vehicles move in accordance with traffic lights, but the player is {{under no obligation to}} obey them.|$|E
5|$|The house {{started as}} a small {{farmhouse}} in 1630 but was enlarged into its current form in the 18th century. The house was {{the property of the}} Napper family for centuries. It was given to the National Trust in 1954. The Arts and Crafts style garden <b>is</b> <b>modeled</b> on that at Hidcote Manor Garden in Gloucestershire. It was originally laid out by Phyllis Reiss and developed by Penelope Hobhouse.|$|E
5|$|When cooled below a point {{called the}} {{critical}} temperature, materials can undergo a phase transition {{in which they}} lose all resistivity to electric current, in {{a process known as}} superconductivity. In BCS theory, this behavior <b>is</b> <b>modeled</b> by pairs of electrons entering a quantum state known as a Boseâ€“Einstein condensate. These Cooper pairs have their motion coupled to nearby matter via lattice vibrations called phonons, thereby avoiding the collisions with atoms that normally create electrical resistance. (Cooper pairs have a radius of roughly 100nm, so they can overlap each other.) However, the mechanism by which higher temperature superconductors operate remains uncertain.|$|E

5|$|Educational {{opportunities}} in emergency medicine {{are not available}} in many countries, and even when present, they are often in their infancy. Botswana opened its first medical school in 2009, with a program in emergency medicine following in 2011. The program aims to train four to six physicians in emergency medicine each year. Limitations on in-country training mean that the program includes six months of training at an international site. The organization of the program <b>is</b> <b>modeled</b> on South Africa's program due to the similarities in resource constraints and disease burdens and the eagerness of College of Emergency Medicine of South Africa and Emergency Medicine Society of South Africa to support the expansion of emergency medicine. Two years of clinical practice are required before entering the residency program, as in the South African and Australian approaches.|$|E
5|$|The {{design of}} the medal <b>is</b> <b>modeled</b> after one used for the Hero of the Soviet Union. Unlike the Hero of the Soviet Union, Hero of Socialist Labor and the Hero of the Russian Federation titles, there is no {{engraving}} on the reverse of the star. The ribbon also copies the Soviet Hero medal's ribbon, since a flag design was also {{used to make the}} ribbon of that medal. The medal is always worn in full {{on the left side of}} the breast above all other medals and orders. Chapter 4, Article 69 of Law N 288-Ð— states that any awards and titles presented by the Soviet Union and the Byelorussian SSR must be placed after awards from the Republic of Belarus.|$|E

Belluschi also designed the Kraushaar Auditorium at Goucher College, which opened in 1962. The Joseph and Rebecca Meyerhoff Auditorium, located at the Baltimore Museum of Art, also opened in 1982, and hosts concerts by the Baltimore Chamber Music Society. Johns Hopkins University's Shriver Hall and the Peabody's Miriam A. Friedberg are also important concert venues, the latter being the oldest still in use.|$|E
