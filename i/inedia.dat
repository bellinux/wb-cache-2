The Australian television programme 60 Minutes challenged Jasmuheen to demonstrate how she could live without food and water. The supervising medical professional Dr Beres Wenck found that, after 48 hours, Jasmuheen displayed symptoms of acute dehydration, stress, and high blood pressure. Jasmuheen claimed {{that this was a}} result of [...] "polluted air". On the third day, she was moved to a mountainside retreat about 15 miles from the city, where she was filmed enjoying the fresh air, claiming she could now successfully practice <b>Inedia.</b> But as filming progressed, Jasmuheen's speech slowed, her pupils dilated, and she lost over a stone (6kg or 14lb) in weight. After four days, she acknowledged that she had lost weight, but stated that she felt fine. Dr. Wenck stated: [...] "You are now quite dehydrated, probably over 10%, getting up to 11%." [...] The doctor continued: [...] "Her pulse is about double what it was when she started. The risk if she goes any further is kidney failure." [...] Jasmuheen's condition continued to deteriorate rapidly due to acute dehydration, despite her contrary insistence. Dr Wenck concluded that continuing the experiment would ultimately prove fatal. The film crew agreed with this assessment and stopped filming.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Inedia</b> (Latin for [...] "fasting") or breatharianism [...] is {{the belief}} that it is {{possible}} for a person to live without consuming food. Breatharians claim that food, and in some cases water, are not necessary for survival, and that humans can be sustained solely by prana, the vital life force in Hinduism. According to Ayurveda, sunlight {{is one of the main}} sources of prana, and some practitioners believe that it is possible for a person to survive on sunlight alone. The terms breatharianism or <b>inedia</b> may also refer to this philosophy when it is practiced as a lifestyle in place of the usual diet.|$|E

5000|$|Bigu (...) is a Daoist fasting {{technique}} {{associated with}} achieving xian [...] "transcendence; immortality". Grain avoidance {{is related to}} multifaceted Chinese cultural beliefs. For instance, bigu fasting was the common medical cure for expelling the sanshi 三尸 [...] "Three Corpses", the malevolent, grain-eating spirits {{that live in the}} human body (along with the hun and po souls), report their host's sins to heaven every 60 days, and carry out punishments of sickness and early death. Avoiding [...] "grains" [...] has been diversely interpreted to mean not eating particular foodstuffs (food grain, cereal, the Five Grains, wugu, or staple food), or not eating any food (<b>inedia,</b> breatharianism, or aerophagia). In the historical context of traditional Chinese culture within which the concept of bigu developed, there was great symbolic importance connected with the five grains and their importance in sustaining human life, exemplified in various myths and legends from ancient China and throughout subsequent history. The concept of bigu developed in reaction to this tradition, and within the context of Daoist philosophy.|$|E

5000|$|The 10th-century Xu xian zhuan 續仙傳 [...] "Continued Biographies of Immortals", by Shen Fen 沈汾, has the {{earliest}} account of Tan Qiao.

His father Tan Zhu 譚洙, {{who was a}} director of the Guozijian [...] "Imperial Academy" [...] during the Tang Dynasty (618-907 CE), educated him in the Confucian classics and histories to prepare him for the Imperial examination. Qiao was an excellent student but more interested in the Daoist classics, particularly the hagiographies of xian 仙 [...] "immortals; transcendents". Tan Qiao left home to study Daoism on Mount Zhongnan and never returned. After travelling through the Sacred mountains of China, he lived for a decade on Mount Song 嵩山 (Henan), where Daoist priests taught him neidan alchemical techniques of bigu 辟穀 [...] "abstention from cereals" [...] and yangqi 養氣 [...] "nourishing qi", roughly corresponding with Western practices of <b>inedia</b> and breatharianism. [...] "He wore furs in summer and thin garments in winter, and he would often lie about in the snow and rain, to all appearances dead" [...] (Herbert Giles 1898:710). This compares with the Himalayan tradition of tummo, which is still practiced by the Kagyu school. Tan's father regularly sent him money and clothing, which he promptly spent on wine and gave away. Tan later went south to Mount Nanyue 南岳, or Mount Heng (Hunan), where he allegedly perfected the jindan 金丹 [...] "golden elixir" [...] and could change shape, become invisible, and enter fire or water without being harmed (all Daoist metaphors for xian transcendence).

Aphids from the genus Dysaphis also caused changes in the chemical composition of the injured plant parts. The presence of predatory arthropods was observed in aphid colonies occurring on hawthorn. The most numerous of these were the larvae of Syrphidae and Coccinellidae. The culture of parasitized aphids gave numerous flights of parasitoids and hyperparasitoids.

40|$|The Savone-Ceva {{motor road}} {{is the last}} section of the great European highway, known as the seventh meridian. It extends from Hamburg to Savona, crosses Switzerland, and enters Italy at Saint Bernard's. This last section has a mean height of more than 400 m, and all the {{characteristics}} of a mountain road. It involves a large number of tunnels, cuttings, and embankments, thanks to which the curves and slopes are gentle. The structures supporting the road are of many kinds, and each type has been separately allocated to contractors, although an initial project was prepared by the technical directors of the whole scheme. This initial project included the choice of the road axis and the obtention of information on the subsoil. Along the more important sections of the road special soundings were carried out, so that there was a considerably unitj/ of initial planning. The arrangement for awarding contracts involved a number of conditions and data which the bidding contractors could check over the proposed site of the motor road. One of the principal conditions required the use of supports in the form of groups of columns with a trapezoidal plan distribution. The purpose of this was to fit better the decks of the large number of viaduct decks, which have a curved outline. As there are many such viaducts, in this article the author summarizes the more significant details, and describes the most important general features. La autopista Savona-Ceva constituye el tramo final de la gran arteria europea, llamada del séptimo meridiano, que se extiende de Hamburgo a Savona pasando por Suiza y entrando en Italia a través del San Bernardo. Este tramo Ceva-Savona, de una altitud <b>inedia</b> que rebasa los 400 m, presenta todas las características de un trazado de montaña, con abundantes obras de fábrica, túneles y fuertes excavaciones, gracias a las cuales las curvas y pendientes son suaves y practicables. Las estructuras son muy variadas y cada uno de los lotes ha sido motivo de un concurso, si bien la dirección técnica de obras redactó un anteproyecto, replanteó el eje y ordenó la toma de datos sobre el terreno. Si a ello añadimos que en las zonas de ubicación de las obras más importantes se realizaron sondeos de reconocimiento, comprenderemos mejor la unificación lograda. Los concursos se apoyaron en una serie de condiciones y datos que las empresas licitantes podían comprobar recorriendo el trazado replanteado. Una de las condiciones principales consistió en el empleo preferente de soportes formando castillete y de planta trapezoidal, con la idea de acoplar mejor los tableros en los múltiples viaductos con eje curvo. Como el número de viaductos es grande, el autor resume las características más importantes de los de mayor interés y se extiende en consideraciones de interés general aplicables a todas ellas...|$|E
