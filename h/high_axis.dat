Fighting continued in this area for the next week, as the Axis tried to recover the small hill that was so important to their defence.|$|E

40|$|We {{present an}} {{interference}} confocal microscope (ICM) {{with a new}} single-body four-step simultaneous phase-shifter device designed to obtain high immunity to vibration. The proposed ICM combines the respective advantages of simultaneous phase shifting interferometry and bipolar differential confocal microscopy to obtain <b>high</b> <b>axis</b> resolution, large dynamic range, and reduce the sensitivity to vibration and reflectance disturbance seamlessly. A compact single body spatial phase shifter is added to capture four phase-shifted interference signals simultaneously without time delay and construct a stable and space-saving simplified interference confocal microscope system. The test result {{can be obtained by}} combining the interference phase response and the bipolar property of differential confocal microscopy without phase unwrapping. Experiments prove that the proposed microscope is capable of providing stable measurements with 1 nm of axial depth resolution for either low- or high-numerical aperture objective lenses...|$|E

40|$|In this study, I {{specifically}} {{looked at}} three major issues regarding 36 target plant species in a fragmented landscape in the Corozal district, Belize: 1) Determine woodlot characteristics {{that tend to}} favor the target species. 2) Determine plant characteristics that tend to favor the target species. 3) Determine whether age and size of a woodlot favors {{the presence of the}} target species. The study area was divided into three areas and each area had woodlots varying in sizes and ages. 36 plant species were sampled in all woodlots upon which woodlot characteristics and species characteristics were associated with the number and frequency of these plants. Data was analyzed using Correlation techniques, Stepwise Regression analysis and Detrended Correspondence analysis. Woodlot and species characteristics seem to be confounding. Woodlot characteristics that yielded greater species richness for the correlation and regression techniques are older, larger, closer to Shipstern Nature Reserve, farther from sugar cane fields and farther away from papaya fields. Woodlots that are older, closer to Shipstern Nature reserve and farther away from papaya fields had <b>higher</b> <b>Axis</b> 1 values for DECORANA. Species were more widespread when they were insect pollinated for the correlations and regression analysis. Species had <b>higher</b> <b>Axis</b> 1 values if they were insect pollinated and <b>higher</b> <b>Axis</b> 2 values if they are perennials. Over all, our data suggest that the Copper Bank area is more species rich because the woodlot and species variables accounted seem to favor the presence of more of the target species in this area, whereas these properties of woodlots are lacking in the other two areas namely San Narciso and Santa Elena...|$|R
40|$|A new {{adaptation}} {{scheme for}} adapting arbitrary normal mutation distributions in evolution strategies is introduced. It can adapt correct scaling and correlations between object parameters. Furthermore, it {{is independent of}} any rotation of the objective function and reliably adapts mutation distributions corresponding to hyperellipsoids with <b>high</b> <b>axis</b> ratio. In simulations, the generating set adaptation is compared to two other schemes which also can produce non axisparallel mutation ellipsoids. It {{turns out to be}} the only adaptation scheme which is completely independent of the chosen coordinate system. 1 INTRODUCTION In evolution strategies (ESs), a mutation is usually carried out by adding a N(0; A) distributed random vector 1. The symmetric and positive semi-definite n Θ n-matrix A represents the parameters of the mutation distribution. Assuming that the landscape of the objective function is unknown, in general A has to be adapted to get reasonable progre [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Pentapod and hexapod {{structures}} {{consist of}} 5 or 6 kinematic chains linked to one another. These chains are generally formed of one strut, the corresponding number of joints and an advance drive. It {{is necessary to}} set up the joints in a very tight space and design struts as slim as possible to generate the best kinematic properties and <b>high</b> <b>axis</b> dynamics. The joints are best formed of pretensible combinations of roller bearings that only dampen slightly. These design constraints mean that the joints are much less rigid than the guide systems for serial machine structures, although they only have slight flexural strength. This results in higher vibration susceptibility with simultaneously limited system damping. At the same time, its vibration properties are substantially more complex and therefore more difficult to capture due to the interlinked kinematic chains, the large number of discrete elasticity points and greater position dependency...|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} the waveguiding by thin patterned slabs {{embedded in a}} homogeneous medium. In the longwave limit, the wave spectra of slabs {{are found to be}} well described by a single frequency-independent parameter, which we call the "guiding power". The guiding power can be evaluated in an effective medium approximation, similar to the Maxwell Garnett theory, but modified for the local field corrections specific to the two-dimensional geometry. The guiding power is different for the transverse magnetic (TM) and transverse electric (TE) polarizations. We show that the confinement factor of TM waves in a porous layer with high index ratio can exceed that for a homogeneous layer. Similarly enhanced confinement of TM waves is demonstrated for a layer of elongated cylinders or elliptic inclusion with a <b>high</b> <b>axis</b> length ratio. The effect originates from the suppression of local field effects and the increasing internal field in the inclusion. It may be useful in the design of far-infrared or THz quantum cascade lasers.

40|$|Abstract: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the relation between low back pain (LBP) outcomes and measures of daily exposure to whole-body vibration (WBV) in professional drivers. In a study population of 202 male drivers, who were not affected with LBP at the initial survey, LBP in terms of duration, intensity, and disability was investigated over a two-year follow-up period. Vibration measurements were made on representative samples of machines and vehicles. The following measures of daily WBV exposure were obtained: (i) 8 -h energy-equivalent frequency-weighted acceleration (<b>highest</b> <b>axis),</b> A(8) max in ms – 2 r. m. s.; (ii) A(8) sum (root-sum-of-squares) in ms – 2 r. m. s.; (iii) Vibration Dose Value (<b>highest</b> <b>axis),</b> VDVmax in ms – 1. 75; (iv) VDVsum (root-sum-of-quads) in ms – 1. 75. The cumulative incidence of LBP over the followup period was 38. 6 %. The incidence of high pain intensity and severe disability was 16. 8 and 14. 4 %, respectively. After adjustment for several confounders, VDVmax or VDVsum gave better predictions of LBP outcomes over time than A(8) max or A(8) sum, respectively. Poor predictions were obtained with A(8) max, which is the currently preferred measure of daily WBV exposure in European countries. In multivariate data analysis, physical work load was a significant predictor of LBP outcomes over the follow-up period. Perceived psychosocial work environment was not associated with LBP...|$|R
40|$|In {{clinical}} practice, {{the combination}} of brief, cost effective, valid and reliable assessment of personality disorders (PDs) is highly important. Substantial budget cuts require optimal use of the clinician's time. PDs are related with <b>high</b> <b>axis</b> I comorbidity, poorer therapy outcome and increased health service costs. In {{an effort to find}} a screening questionnaire that meets both the demands of cost-effectiveness and methodological soundness, we investigated the use of the Personality Diagnostic Questionnaire 4 + (PDQ- 4 +) as a first step in a two-step diagnostic procedure. As the second step, we used the Structured Clinical Interview of DSM-IV Axis II Personality Disorders (SCID-II) as criterion measure. Our results show that the positive predictive power of the PDQ- 4 + is rather low, resulting in a large number of false positives. Therefore, its added value is poor in comparison with administering the SCID-II in the first place. Also, the value of the two validity scales of the PDQ- 4 + is highly questionable. We therefore conclude that the PDQ- 4 + should not be used in clinical practice as a screening instrument for PD assessment. Copyright © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|E
40|$|A high co-occurrence between {{personality}} {{and substance use}} disorders suggests causal relationships between these conditions. Most empirical evidence strongly supports causal pathways in which (pathological) personality traits {{contribute to the development}} of a substance use disorder (i. e., primary personality disorder model). In addition, data support a heuristic model of three developmental pathways, that is, the behavioural disinhibition, stress reduction, and reward sensitivity pathways. No data from prospective studies are available on the primary substance use disorder model. It is therefore unknown as to what extent <b>high</b> <b>Axis</b> II prevalences in addicts can be accounted for by personality disorder symptoms resulting from (chronic) substance abuse. Finally, recent empirical findings with respect to the common factor model suggest a common diathesis for substance use disorder and antisocial personality disorder. In any individual case, more than one model may have explanatory value. It is possible that one model best describes the initiation of a comorbid disorder, while another describes long-term maintenance of the same comorbid association. Personality pathology may also act as a modifier of symptoms, treatment response, outcome, and course of substance use disorder, and thereby account for the strong association between both conditions. This possibility does not involve a causal relationship but may have important implications for treatment plannin...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Knowledge of the {{intrinsic}} shape of molecular clouds and molecular cloud cores provides useful information {{on both the}} formation and collapse mechanisms associated with the objects and on the initial conditions for star formation. We compare the shapes of molecular clouds {{as determined by the}} Heyer et al. (2001, HCS 01) and Brunt et al. (2003, BKP 03) catalogues of 12 CO(J = 1 − 0) emission in the outer Galaxy. The catalogues are based upon different versions of the FCRAO Outer Galaxy Survey and also utilize different techniques for defining both the extent and shape of the clouds, which allows us {{to examine the effects of}} using different cloud definition and shape-fitting algorithms. In order to compare the two catalogues we use a subset of the cloud population where the clouds are well-defined in both data sets. We model the clouds in terms of triaxial ellipsoids and use a Monte Carlo technique to determine the best-fit intrinsic shape distribution which matches the observed axis ratio distributions. Our analysis shows that the observed shapes of molecular clouds can be best described in terms of an intrinsic distribution of triaxial ellipsoids that are intermediate between near-oblate and near-prolate ellipsoids. The lack of <b>high</b> <b>axis</b> ratio clouds seen in the HCS 01 catalogue is shown to be an artifact of the cloud definition algorithm and not an intrinsic property of the molecular clouds...|$|E

40|$|Plant {{community}} {{composition and}} its likely environmental controls were investigated for 200 sample plots (each 100 m 2) from Mediterranean-type vegetation in the Little Desert National Park, Victoria. twinspan classification revealed four readily identifiable vegetation types; mallee-broombush, heathland, stringybark open woodland, and an assemblage intermediate between mallee-broombush and heathland referred to here as broom-heath. Mallee-broombush {{was found on}} Parilla Sands characterized by high Ca levels relative to heathland and stringybark open woodlands on unconsolidated Lowan Sands. The first axis of a 2 dimensional non-metric MDS ordination also divided heathlands (<b>high</b> <b>axis</b> scores) from mallee-broombush (low scores), while the second separated these vegetation types from stringybark woodlands and broom-heath. Vector-fitting revealed significant correlations between the locations of samples in ordination space and exchangeable soil Ca, soil colour, aspect and Shannon–Weiner diversity. Highest species richness/diversity {{was associated with the}} ecotonal area between Parilla and Lowan Sands (i. e. broom-heath) where a number of species characteristic of different assemblages had overlapping ranges. The fire-sensitive conifer, Callitris rhomboidea, was preferentially located in stringybark woodland and broom-heath vegetation types. Its presence was positively associated with high species richness and aspects having a southerly component. Four Callitris stands sampled for population structure were all > 40 years old and showed evidence of interfire recruitment from seeds released by old, serotinous cones. Overall, results suggest that variations in plant community composition and structure in the eastern block of the Little Desert are primarily due to variations in soil properties associated with the distribution of the two dominant substrate types, Parilla Sand and Lowan Sand. However, the interplay of topography and fire behaviour has probably been more important than substrate type in determining the distribution and population structure of longer-lived, fire-sensitive species such as Callitris rhomboidea...|$|E
40|$|In {{architectural}} {{history of}} the Franciscans in north-eastern Brazil, one of the monuments occupying a prominent place is, without doubt, the Convent of Santo Antonio do Paraguaçu, founded in 1649. This old monastic center is settled in Iguape Bay margin (Cachoeira region, Bahia), in the inland sea known as “Recôncavo Bahiano”. The convent is nowadays very neglected and in tumble-down state, following the official restrictions on the admission of novices and the imperial decree of compulsory closing of the Novitiate convents. These compulsory measures eclipsed gradually and inevitably their importance and primitive baroque beauty {{and led to the}} dispersal and squandering of their most notable artistic heritage. After a brief historical, geographical and artistic summary, a preliminary study of the hydrographic conditions of the settlement area was done, {{as well as of the}} hydraulic systems of the convent, from captation to final disposal. If the informations concerning the potable water system are few and vague, other systems show yet important remains as the kitchen system, presenting an arched acqueduct coming from a well where a <b>high</b> <b>axis</b> noria have existed. In the surrounding area of the conventual building several other wells existed, some of them for the irrigation of the monastic kitchen garden and another one, close to the quay, to support clearing operations probably.

Some technical data of other systems are also examined in our study, with a special emphasis in what concerns the main sewerege disposal whose typology can be considered rare, at least in Bazilian territory.

40|$|Within {{the scope}} of the given paper spatial, time and energy {{characteristics}} of a copper vapor laser (CVL|) have been investigated in the mode of one convex mirror using the most powerful industrial sealed-off active elements (AE) of “Kulon” series: 15 W GL- 206 D model and 20 W GL- 206 I model in order to define the capabilities of using its one-beam radiation for effective microprocessing of materials. The carried out calculations and experimental investigations showed that one can vary the radiation beam divergence within a wide range by changing the radius of curvature of CVL convex mirror; and one can reach values close to diffraction limit at radii of curvature one-two orders lower than the distance from the mirror to AE output aperture. At small radii of mirror curvature (R = 6 - 30 mm) the CVL output radiation beam divergence can only 2 - 3 times (0. 15 - 0. 35 mrad) differ from diffraction limit. At these divergences the peak power density in a focused spot can reach 109 … 1010 W/cm 2 values. With the increase of AE discharge channel length the CVL output radiation beam divergence in one-mirror mode decreases and tends to diffraction limit, while power increases, which in the aggregate leads to the sharp increase of peak power density. Therefore, from practical point of view the industrial AEs “Crystal” GL- 205 А and GL- 205 B with 0. 93 and 1. 23 m discharge channel length and 20 mm diameter are the most effective ones. Besides the formation of one high quality beam, the advantages of one-mirror mode include a <b>high</b> <b>axis</b> stability of directivity pattern of this beam and pulsed energy, which increase the quality of microprocessing of materials. Practical experience of using CVL with one convex mirror shows that 109 W/cm 2 peak power density level is sufficient only for efficient microprocessing of foiled materials and solder cutouts (0. 02 - 0. 1 мм). The use of this CVL as a driving oscillator (DO) in a copper vapor laser system (CVLS) of the type: driving oscillator – power amplifier (DO – PA) using 30 - 50 W industrial “Crystal” AEs in PAs allows to increase peak power density up to 1011 W/cm 2, sufficient for efficient and qualitative microprocessing of materials up to 1 mm thick. The main conclusions on the results of CVL investigations are also true for other metals vapor pulsed lasers as well as for gas and solid-state lasers with a short period of population inversion existence. </p...|$|E
