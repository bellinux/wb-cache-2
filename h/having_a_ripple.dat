This represented an incipient libertarian impulse of Yippies and the first example in the United States of this election ballot alternative, in what one of the resolutions two co-sponsors, Matthew Steen, described as an [...] "anti-institutional Yippie up-yours." [...] Years earlier Steen had been a Yippie activist, with Stew Albert, as a reporter with Berkeley Tribe.

40|$|The {{retirement}} age of industrial workers in national pension schemes is being raised. However, many industrial workers {{are not able}} to work until they have reached the increased {{retirement age}}. This problem is decreasing social security, increasing workers anxiety regarding the future and influencing the quality and timing of production processes. Disruptions and lower quality items produced in one activity cell of a supply chain can <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>ripple</b> effect throughout <b>an</b> entire supply chain. To solve this problem, we should put in place supplementary occupational pension schemes, which would compensate firms for the depreciated ability of their elderly workers to work when they have reached the previous retirement age but have not yet reached the new, higher retirement age. This article is introduces a model that is based on extended MRP Theory. The model {{can be used as a}} basis for negotiations between employers and employees to keep production at the same level of quality. The trade-off between higher contributions to supplementary occupational pension schemes and lower added values is considered. Contributions enable the early retirement of industrial workers at one or more workplaces in a supply chain, while lower added value is the result of lower quality and the perturbed timing of items that are produced in one or more activity cells of a supply chain: these issues <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>ripple</b> effect throughout <b>an</b> entire supply chain.
