It has been postulated that in dendrosomes, the poly (propyleneimine) dendrimer-DNA complex is largely protected by multilamelarity of the vesicles. Moreover, it has been hypothesized that the lipoidal layers of the dendrosomes modifies the release pattern of the poly (propyleneimine) dendrimer -DNA complex, while some of the larger vesicles remain at the site of injection following their degradation by tissue phospholipases, the smaller ones delivering and transfecting efficiently the antigen-presenting cells (APC) in the draining lymph nodes.

40|$|Dendritic cells (DCs) {{instruct}} and activate a naive {{immune system}} to mount a response toward foreign proteins. Therefore, it has been hypothesized that an ideal vaccine strategy would be to directly introduce genes encoding antigens into DCs. To test this strategy quantitatively, we have compared the immune response elicited by a genetically transfected DC line to that induced by a fibroblast line, or standard <b>genetic</b> <b>immunization.</b> We observe that a single injection of 500 – 1, 000 transfected DCs can produce a response {{comparable to that of}} standard <b>genetic</b> <b>immunization,</b> whereas fibroblasts, with up to 50 -fold greater transfection efficiency, were less potent.

40|$|The use of {{mammalian}} {{gene expression}} vectors {{has become increasingly}} important for <b>genetic</b> <b>immunization</b> and gene therapy as well as basic research. Essential {{for the success of}} these vectors in <b>genetic</b> <b>immunization</b> is the proper choice of a promoter linked to the antigen of interest. Many <b>genetic</b> <b>immunization</b> vectors use promoter elements from pathogenic viruses including SV 40 and CMV. Lymphokines produced by the immune response to proteins expressed by these vectors could inhibit further transcription initiation by viral promoters. Our objective was to determine the effect of IFN- g on transgene expression driven by viral SV 40 or CMV promoter/enhancer and the mammalian promoter/enhancer for the major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC I) gene. We transfected the luciferase gene driven by these three promoters into 14 cell lines of many tissues and several species. Luciferase assays of transfected cells untreated or treated with IFN- g indicated that although the viral promoters could drive luciferase production in all cell lines tested to higher or lower levels than the MHC I promoter, treatment with IFN- g inhibited transgene expression in most of the cell lines and amplification of the MHC I promoter-driven transgene expression in all cell lines. These data indicate that the SV 40 and CMV promoter/enhancers may not be a suitable choice for gene delivery especially for <b>genetic</b> <b>immunization</b> or cancer cytokine gene therapy. The MHC I promoter/enhancer, on the other hand, may be an ideal transgene promoter for applications involving the immune system...|$|E

40|$|Type II collagen-induced {{arthritis}} (CIA) is an experimentally inducible autoimmune {{disorder that}} is, just like several forms of human arthritis, {{influenced by a}} <b>genetic</b> background. <b>Immunization</b> of young rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) with type II collagen (CII) induced CIA in about 70 % of the animals. One major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I allele was present only in young animals resistant to CIA and absent in arthritic animals. This strong association suggests that the MHC class I allele itself, or a closely linked gene, determines resistance to CIA. The mechanism controlling the resistance to CIA becomes less efficient in aged animals since older rhesus monkeys, which were positive for the resistance marker, developed a mild form of arthritis. At the cellular level it is demonstrated that resistance to CIA is reflected by a low responsiveness of T cells to CII.

In this study B. anthracis strains isolated from cattle carcasses in African countries where anthrax is endemic were tested for their cross-reactivity with monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) specific for anthrose containing oligosaccharides. Unexpectedly, none of the isolates collected in Chad, Cameroon and Mali were recognized by the mAbs.

40|$|In the {{treatment}} of tumors and viral diseases such as HIV- 1 infection, immunotherapeutic strategies {{do not seem to}} have enough capacity to eradicate an already established disease. However, these strategies could play a unique role as adjuvant treatments of therapies that eliminate the main tumor or viral load {{in order to avoid the}} relapse of the disease. Consequently, efforts aimed to improve the current steady state of imunogene-therapy and to find novel therapeutic strategies should be continued. Cytokines are very efficient immunomodulators. Nevertheless, their application is frequently hampered by high toxicity specially, when applied systemically. Cytokines work in a paracrine form and for that reason a highly regulated release of these substances could be desirable for most therapeutic applications. To avoid systemic effects, the target cells can be autoactivated by cytokines produced by the same cells after cytokine gene transfer. However, the uncontrolled cellular secretion of cytokines could even exert adverse bystander effects. Therefore, the development of additional methods for a more restricted administration is still desirable. With the aim of improving the administration and release of cytokines in a strictly localized area, we have designed vectors that express the murine granulocytic macrophage colony stimulating factor (mGM-CSF) with different subcellular localization signals. Using this strategy, we have shown that cytokines can be expressed and targeted to different subcellular compartments as stable and active proteins. We also demonstrated that the mGM-CSF-dependent DA- 3 cell line acquires autonomous growth following gene modification with the plasmids encoding either extracellular or intracellular forms of mGM-CSF. In addition, we showed that the autonomous growth induced by the intracellular forms of rnGM-CSF in these cells, is mediated by a mechanism of restricted autocrine stimulation without release of detectable cytokine to the extracellular medium. Our findings support the concept that intracellular cytokines may be used to provide the desired effect of these substances on the target cells, while avoiding the collateral effects of their uncontrolled secretion. When our plasmids were tested as adjuvants of <b>genetic</b> <b>immunizations</b> with HIV- 1 genes, it was demonstrated that the Th 1 pattern of a primary immune response could be switched toward an enhanced Th 2 response, by plasmids expressing the secreted form of mGM-CSF or by recombinant mGM-CSF. On the other hand, plasmids expressing an intracellular form of the mGM-CSF, induced consistently an enhanced primary Th 1 response. Currently, chemotherapy is being used with good results for {{the treatment}} of some tumors as well as for HIV- 1 infection. Nevertheless, resistance and severe side effects have hampered the use of this approach. A new technology with a potential for treatment of tumors and viral diseases is post transcriptional gene silencing induced by RNA interference (RNAi). By using plasmid-mediated expression of small interfering RNAs (siRNA) against either endogenous transcripts for the primary HIV- 1 coreceptor, CCR 5, or viral transcripts for the Rev gene of HIV- 1, we were able to inhibit efficiently both viral infection and replication, respectively. The possibility of inducing a considerable reduction of the viral load or tumor burden using siRNA technology could have a significant impact on {{the treatment of}} these diseases in the future...|$|R

Tumour growth was profoundly suppressed in C 57 BL/ 6 mice immunized with pGFP-TRP- 2, while mice vaccinated with pTRP- 2 showed rapid tumour growth and died within 40 days after tumour challenge. Splenocytes of mice immunized with pGFP-TRP- 2 showed high CTL activity specific for TRP- 2181 − 188. GFP-TRP- 2 expressed in COS- 7 cells was rapidly degradated in vitro and the degradation was almost completely prevented by adding a proteasome inhibitor, MG- 132, in the culture. Furthermore, the antimelanoma immunity induced by <b>genetic</b> <b>immunization</b> with pGFP-TRP- 2 was completely cancelled in mice deficient in proteasome activator PA 28 α/β. Taken together, GFP-TRP- 2 processed by cytosolic proteasome {{played a central role}} in breaking peripheral tolerance to a melanoma/melanocyte antigen, TRP- 2181 − 188, by activating CD 8 + CTL specific for TRP- 2181 − 188. TRP- 2181 − 188 fused to GFP may be readily cut off from GFP by the ubiquitin-fusion degradation (UFD) pathway and efficiently presented to major histocompatibility complex class I molecules, resulting in effective induction of CD 8 + T cells specific for the CTL epitope. Furthermore, CD 4 + T cells specific for GFP were shown to play a crucial role in the antimelanoma immunity, probably potentiating activity of TRP- 2 -specific CTL and/or the ‘ubiquitin-proteasome pathway’.

40|$|The {{hepatitis}} C virus (HCV) is a {{blood-borne virus}} {{responsible for a}} major part of liver transplants is the US, and 3 % of the population world-wide is infected globally. HCV belongs to the Hepacivirus genus of the Flaviviridae family and is transmitted through infectious blood or blood products. In 85 % of those infected the virus establishes a chronic infection. The reason for the high rate of viral persistence is largely unknown, although the high genetic variability is believed play a major role. Today no vaccine is available to prevent or cure the infection, however interferon-a and ribavirin combination therapy can cure around 50 % of those chronically infected. Unfortunately are the side-effects severe and hard to cope with, whereby development of new more effective and less expensive treatments are urgently needed. HCV can be divided into six genotypes of which HCV genotype 1, which represents approximately 50 percent of all HCV infections globally, is the most difficult to treat. One of the proteins with the lowest genetic variability is the non-structural (NS) 3 protein and, in addition, previous studies have shown that NS 3 -specific CD 4 + T-helper-cell (TH) and CD 8 + cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses are crucial for resolving the viral infection. Previous studies have shown NS 3 to be poorly immunogenic when used as a DNA vaccine. In vivo, NS 3 forms a stable complex with NS 4 A, thereby targeting NS 3 to the endoplasmic reticulum and prolonging the NS 3 half life. By inclusion of NS 4 A to the NS 3 DNA vaccine, we observed stronger humoral and cellular responses with a TH 1 -skewed response, as compared to using NS 3 alone. The enhanced immunogenicity was most probably a result of both higher expression levels and a prolonged half-life of NS 3. HCV lacks proof-reading during replication, thereby creating a swarm of closely related genetic variants of the virus within the same host, termed quasispecies. This ability to rapidly change makes HCV able to quickly generate the fittest variant for each new environmental pressure. Thus, HCV can positively select escape mutants when under immune pressure or antiviral treatment. We therefore investigated the natural variation of HLA-A 2 epitopes within NS 3 in HLA-A 2 positive and negative patients chronically infected with genotype 1. In agreement with previous studies did we find that NS 3 was highly conserved. <b>Genetic</b> <b>immunizations</b> with NS 3 / 4 A in HLA-A 2 transgenic mice showed that the 1073 - 1081 epitope was immunodominant in both genotype (gt) 1 and 3 strains. Fine mapping of the 1073 - 1081 epitope of gt 1 revealed that positions 2, 3, 5, 7 and 9 were essential for immune recognition. Mutations at these positions would therefore mediate immune escape, however, almost no mutations were identified at these positions. Importantly, mutations at these positions disrupted both the protease activity and viral replication. Thus, a positive selection of such escape mutations in nature is prevented by the negative effects on viral fitness. To investigate the true plasticity of the NS 3 protease we next generated a complete fitness map of the NS 3 protease by introducing alanine or glycine substitutions at each of the 181 residues. Surprisingly only 23 (13 %) of the 181 mutants resulted in destroyed protease activity, indicating a much higher plasticity than predicted. Finally, to study the in vivo effects of one of the immune-escape mutations that prevented HLA-A 2 binding and destroyed the protease, IIe 1074 Ala, we generated a transgenic mouse expressing this mutant NS 3 / 4 A protein in the liver. This revealed that the protease activity of NS 3 was responsible for the previously observed resistance to TNF-α seen in Tg mice expressing a functional NS 3 protease. In conclusion, the present studies have increased our understanding of the NS 3 / 4 A complex, which hopefully will aid in the development of new preventive and therapeutic regimens for chronic HCV infections...|$|R
40|$|We {{explored}} the genetic {{basis for the}} differing immune responses observed in inbred strains of mice to a high-molecular-weight polysaccharide (PS) from Pseudomonas aeruginosa immunotype 1 (IT- 1).

BALB/c mice immunized with IT- 1 PS produce both anti-IT- 1 PS antibody and antibody cross-reactive with PS from P. aeruginosa immunotype 2 (IT- 2). In the current study, we observed that, in addition, these two strains differ in their ability to respond to low immunizing doses of IT- 1 PS.

In addition to inhibiting cell-free HCV infection, one antibody was also able to block neutralizing antibody-resistant HCV cell-cell transmission and viral dissemination without displaying any detectable toxicity. A novel anti-CD 81 mAb generated by <b>genetic</b> <b>immunization</b> efficiently blocks HCV spread and dissemination. This antibody will be useful to further unravel the role of virus-host interactions during HCV entry and cell-cell transmission. Furthermore, this antibody may be of interest for the development of antivirals for prevention and treatment of HCV infection...|$|E
40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND AND AIMS: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) {{infection}} {{is a challenge}} to prevent and treat because of the rapid development of drug resistance and escape. Viral entry is required for initiation, spread, and maintenance of infection, making it an attractive target for antiviral strategies. METHODS: Using <b>genetic</b> <b>immunization,</b> we produced four monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against the HCV host entry factor CD 81. The effects of antibodies on inhibition of HCV infection and dissemination were analyzed in HCV permissive human liver cell lines. RESULTS: The anti-CD 81 mAbs efficiently inhibited infection by HCV of different genotypes as well as a HCV escape variant selected during liver transplantation and re-infecting the liver graft. Kinetic studies indicated that anti-CD 81 mAbs target a post-binding step during HCV entry. In addition to inhibiting cell-free HCV infection, one antibody was also able to block neutralizing antibody-resistant HCV cell-cell transmission and viral dissemination without displaying any detectable toxicity. CONCLUSION: A novel anti-CD 81 mAb generated by <b>genetic</b> <b>immunization</b> efficiently blocks HCV spread and dissemination. This antibody will be useful to further unravel the role of virus-host interactions during HCV entry and cell-cell transmission. Furthermore, this antibody may be of interest for the development of antivirals for prevention and treatment of HCV infection...|$|E

40|$|Trypanosoma cruzi is the {{etiologic}} agent of Chagas' disease. Acute T. cruzi infection results in polyclonal B-cell activation and delayed specific humoral immunity. T. cruzi proline racemase (TcPRAC), a T. cruzi B-cell mitogen, {{may contribute to}} this dysfunctional humoral response. Stimulation of murine splenocytes with recombinant protein (rTcPRAC) induced B-cell proliferation, antibody secretion, interleukin- 10 (IL- 10) production, and upregulation of CD 69 and CD 86 on B cells. Marginal zone (MZ) B cells are more responsive to T-cell-independent (TI) rTcPRAC stimulation than are follicular mature (FM) B cells in terms of proliferation, antibody secretion, and IL- 10 production. During experimental T. cruzi infection, TcPRAC-specific IgG remained undetectable when responses to other T. cruzi antigens developed. Conversely, intradermal <b>genetic</b> <b>immunization</b> via gene gun (GG) delivered TcPRAC as an immunogen, generating high-titer TcPRAC-specific IgG without B-cell dysfunction. TcPRAC GG immunization led to antigen-specific splenic memory B-cell and bone marrow plasma cell formation. TcPRAC-specific IgG bound mitogenic rTcPRAC, decreasing subsequent B-cell activation. GG immunization with rTcPRAC DNA was nonmitogenic and {{did not affect the}} generation of specific IgG to another T. cruzi antigen, complement regulatory protein (CRP). These data demonstrate the utility of <b>genetic</b> <b>immunization</b> for the conversion of a protein mitogen to an effective antigen. Furthermore, coimmunization of TcPRAC with another T. cruzi antigen indicates the usefulness of this approach for multivalent vaccine development...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{effect of}} <b>genetic</b> <b>immunization</b> of {{neonatal}} mice was tested with a plasmid vector expressing the rabies virus glycoprotein. Mice inoculated within 24 hr after birth with the plasmid DNA developed antibodies {{as well as}} T helper cells to the rabies virus glycoprotein. The response could not be distinguished from that seen upon vaccination of adult mice. Taken together, these data clearly show that the immune system, known {{to be prone to}} induction of immunological tolerance to some antigens applied during the early neonatal period, can readily respond to rabies virus glycoprotein induced by a plasmid vector...|$|E

40|$|The {{advantages}} of <b>genetic</b> <b>immunization</b> {{of the new}} vaccine using plasmid DNAs are multifold. For example, {{it is easy to}} generate plasmid DNAs, increase their dose during the manufacturing process, and sterilize them. Furthermore, they can be stored {{for a long period of}} time upon stabilization, and their protein encoding sequences can be easily modified by employing various DNA-manipulation techniques. Although DNA vaccinations strongly increase Th 1 -mediated immune responses in animals, several problems persist. One is about their weak immunogenicity in humans. To overcome this problem, various genetic adjuvants, electroporation, and prime-boost methods have been developed preclinically, which are reviewed here...|$|E

HIV subtype envelopes A, B and C have been compared and a detailed analysis made by peptides of the coreceptor-ligand interactions. We identified a direct interaction between HIV- 1 envelope and a cellular receptor at the amino acid level. Both the viral subtype and its tropism appeared to influence inhibition of infection. <b>Genetic</b> <b>immunization</b> induced new cytotoxic responses while proteins appeared to efficiently boost previous responses.

40|$|Thyroid {{eye disease}} (TED) has an {{autoimmune}} etiology, but {{the nature of}} the autoantigen that is the target of the initiating event remains unknown. A number of candidates have been proposed based on Western blotting, library screening, and deduction from sequence similarity. A strong favorite is the thyrotropin receptor (TSHR), which is the target of the thyroid stimulating antibodies (TSAB) of Graves' disease (GD). We have recently demonstrated TSHR transcripts in orbital adipose tissue from a patient with TED by Northern blot, transcripts in normal adipose tissue being at the limit of detection. We have shown that the transcripts are translated into protein by immunohistochemical analysis using two monoclonal antibodies to the TSHR generated by <b>genetic</b> <b>immunization.</b> TSHR immunoreactivity is associated with elongated cells with the appearance of a fibroblast, often adjacent to clusters of adipocytes, in orbital biopsies from patients with TED but not in strabismus or pseudotumor biopsies. In animal studies, we have transferred thyroiditis to naive BALBc and NOD mice, using T cells primed to the human TSHR, either using the receptor expressed as a bacterial fusion protein or by <b>genetic</b> <b>immunization.</b> The BALBc develop a Th 2 -type response to the receptor, but the NOD a Th 1 -type with thyrocyte destruction. Orbital pathology, edema, infiltration by mast cells and lymphocytes, and adipose accumulation was also induced in 68 % of the BALBc but none of the NOD mice. Together these data indicate that the preadipocyte expresses the TSHR and that a Th 2 autoimmune response to the receptor may be an initiating event in TED.
