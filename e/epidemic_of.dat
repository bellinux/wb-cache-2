5|$|A {{graduate}} of the University of Melbourne, Fairley joined the Australian Army Medical Corps in 1915. He investigated an <b>epidemic</b> <b>of</b> meningitis that was occurring in Army camps in Australia. While with the 14th General Hospital in Cairo, he investigated schistosomiasis (then known as bilharzia) and developed tests and treatments for the disease. In the inter-war period he became renowned as an expert on tropical medicine.|$|E

5|$|His {{prolific}} output, {{mainly in}} chemical pathology, included {{research into the}} metabolism of glycogen, uric acid, and urea; studies into an <b>epidemic</b> <b>of</b> cholera in Amsterdam; the toxicity of Atropa belladonna (deadly nightshade); various pigmented substances in the blood (including porphyrins); {{the nature of the}} heart sounds; and several contributions in tropical medicine, in which he was considered an expert. He also described the blood disorder methaemoglobinaemia.|$|E
5|$|In 1481 and 1482, {{earthquakes}} {{destroyed the}} Jewish quarter, {{so that only}} 22 families remained in the city. After an <b>epidemic</b> <b>of</b> plague in 1498–1500, the Knights Hospitaller, who ruled the island at that time, expelled those of the remaining Jews who would not be baptized. In the next two decades, the Hospitallers brought to the island between 2,000 and 3,000 captured Jews who were kept as slaves to work on fortifications.|$|E
5|$|In 17th-century Germany, the {{physician}} Eberhard Gockel discovered lead-contaminated wine {{to be the}} cause of an <b>epidemic</b> <b>of</b> colic. He had noticed that monks who did not drink wine were healthy, while wine drinkers developed colic, and traced the cause to sugar of lead, made by simmering litharge with vinegar. As a result, Eberhard Ludwig, Duke of Württemberg issued an edict in 1696 banning the adulteration of wines with litharge.|$|E

40|$|Many <b>epidemics</b> <b>of</b> {{water-borne}} hepatitis {{have occurred}} throughout India. These {{were thought to}} be <b>epidemics</b> <b>of</b> hepatitis A until 1980, when evidence for an enterically transmitted non-A, non-B hepatitis was first reported. Subsequently, hepatitis E virus was discovered and most recent <b>epidemics</b> <b>of</b> enterically transmitted non-A, non-B hepatitis have been attributed to hepatitis E virus infection. However, {{only a limited number of}} cases have been confirmed by immuno electron microscopy, polymerase chain reaction, or seroconversion. In the present study we have performed a retrospective seroepidemiologic study <b>of</b> 17 <b>epidemics</b> <b>of</b> water-borne hepatitis in India. We have confirmed that 16 <b>of</b> the 17 <b>epidemics</b> were caused at least in part by serologically closely related hepatitis E viruses.

During an <b>epidemic</b> <b>of</b> cholera that spread through Bardstown in 1833, three of Rowan's children (William, Atkinson, and Mary Jane) died. The spouses of William and Mary Jane also died of cholera, as did Mary Jane's daughter, and Rowan's sister Elizabeth and her husband.

5|$|At the time, he had {{his first}} {{confrontation}} with Spanish authorities, since Betances gave last priority of medical treatment to those Spanish-born military rank and officers who were affected by the disease (they demanded preferential and immediate treatment, and he openly despised them for it). For his hard work to save many Puerto Ricans from the ravages of the cholera <b>epidemic</b> <b>of</b> 1856, Betances was commended by the city's government. However, when the central government established a Chief Surgeon post for the city, Betances (who was the acting chief surgeon) was passed over, {{in favor of a}} Spanish newcomer.|$|E

5|$|Efforts {{to control}} the spread of malaria {{suffered}} a major setback in 1930: entomologist Raymond Corbett Shannon discovered imported disease-bearing Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes living in Brazil (DNA analysis later revealed the actual species to be A. arabiensis). This species of mosquito is a particularly efficient vector for malaria and is native to Africa. In 1938, the introduction of this vector caused the greatest <b>epidemic</b> <b>of</b> malaria ever seen in the New World. However, complete eradication of A. gambiae from northeast Brazil and thus from the New World was achieved in 1940 by the systematic application of the arsenic-containing compound Paris green to breeding places, and of pyrethrum spray-killing to adult resting places.|$|E
5|$|Fairley {{joined the}} Australian Army Medical Corps with {{the rank of}} captain on 1 August 1915 and was posted to Royal Melbourne Hospital as a {{resident}} medical officer. He investigated an <b>epidemic</b> <b>of</b> meningitis that was occurring in local Army camps, and his first published paper was an analysis of this disease, documenting fifty cases. In 1916, he co-authored a monograph published by the Federal government detailing 644 cases, of which 338 (52%) were fatal, this being before the invention of antibiotic drugs.|$|E
5|$|Following this, the {{regiment}} undertook basic training including weapons handling, ceremonial drill, mounted and dismounted tactics and regimental manoeuvres. In late April, they marched through {{the centre of}} Sydney {{as part of a}} farewell before deploying overseas. On 11 June, after the brigade had concentrated, {{the regiment}} embarked upon the troopship SS Suevic. After four days steaming, the ship put into Adelaide, South Australia, where the regiment disembarked their horses due to concerns about death rates among horses travelling at that time of year. The men continued on their journey three days later, undertaking rifle and signals training on deck during the day. They crossed the equator in the early afternoon on 5 July; a short time later an <b>epidemic</b> <b>of</b> measles broke out.|$|E

Fairley was soon facing a series of medical emergencies caused by the Kokoda Track campaign. An <b>epidemic</b> <b>of</b> bacillary dysentery was headed off by Fairley's decision to rush all available supplies of sulphaguanadine to New Guinea. On Fairley's advice every man who complained of diarrhoea was given the drug and the epidemic was brought under control in ten days.|$|E
5|$|In the 1980s, a purported {{new species}} of Streptococcus, named S.shiloi, was {{identified}} {{as one of the}} causes of an <b>epidemic</b> <b>of</b> meningoencephalitis (an inflammation of the brain and its surrounding membranes) affecting farmed rainbow trout and tilapia in Israel since 1986. Since S.shiloi was alpha-hemolytic, had a G+C% content of 37% and did not ferment sugar galactose, it was not classified as S.iniae, which is beta-hemolytic, has a G+C% content of 32%, and ferments galactose. In 1995, S.shiloi was found in fact to be beta-hemolytic, and after DNA-DNA hybridization techniques with the ATCC type S.iniae and recalculation of the G+C% content, was reclassified by the same group as a junior synonym of S.iniae.|$|E
