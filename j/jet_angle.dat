The aim of {{this work}} is to {{optimize}} process design parameters of the hot rolling steel strip preposition ultra-fast cooling(UFC) system, and improve the stability and uniformity of micro heat transfer during the high strength cooling process of hot rolling strip. According to the technology and equipment feature of the pre-UFC system for a factory, the convective heat transfer process of single nozzle and strip in UFC system was studied numerically by the fluid-structure interaction finite element method (FEM). The influence of different parameters on the slot impinging jet heat transfer coefficient was obtained, such as <b>jet</b> <b>angle,</b> the jet velocity, the slot nozzle width and water temperature. The results show that on the ultra-fast cooling process of the strip in the initial temperature of 850 oC and thickness of 8 mm, the global average heat transfer coefficient can be increased {{with the increase of}} jet velocity, and decrease of the cooling water temperature. The <b>jet</b> <b>angle</b> and the slot nozzle width have minimal effect on it for the whole heat transfer zone.

40|$|The <b>jet</b> opening <b>angle</b> of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) is an {{important}} parameter for determining {{the characteristics of the}} progenitor, and the information contained in the opening angle gives insight into the relativistic outflow and the total energy that is contained in the burst. Unfortunately, a confident inference of the <b>jet</b> opening <b>angle</b> usually requires broadband measurement of the afterglow of the GRB, from the X-ray down to the radio and from minutes to days after the prompt gamma-ray emission, which may be difficult to obtain. For this reason, very few of all detected GRBs have constrained <b>jet</b> <b>angles.</b> We present an alternative approach to derive <b>jet</b> opening <b>angles</b> from the prompt emission of the GRB, given that the GRB has a measurable Epeak and fluence, and which does not require any afterglow measurements. We present the distribution of derived <b>jet</b> opening <b>angles</b> for {{the first two years of}} the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) operation, and we compare a number of our derived opening angles to the reported opening angles using the traditional afterglow method. We derive the collimation-corrected gamma-ray energy, E_γ, for GRBs with redshift and find that some of the GRBs in our sample are inconsistent with a proto-magnetar progenitor. Finally, we show that the use of the derived <b>jet</b> opening <b>angles</b> results in a tighter correlation between the rest-frame Epeak and E_γ than has previously been presented, which places long GRBs and short GRBs onto one empirical power law.

Through aerodynamic forces, flowfield and velocity profiles measurements, it {{indicates that the}} synthetic jet (SJ) could enlarge the mixing of the shear layer and then enhance the stability of boundary layer, resulting in scope reduction of the flow separation zone. Furthermore, the control effects of dual jet arrays positioned at 15 %c (Actuator 1) and 40 %c (Actuator 2) respectively are systematically investigated with different jet parameters, such as two typical relative phase angles and various incline angles of the jet. The jet closer to {{the leading edge of}} airfoil is more advantageous in delaying the stall of airfoil, and overall, the flow control performances of jet arrays are better than those of single actuator. At the angle of attack (AoA) just approaching and larger than the stall AoA, jet array with 180 ° phase difference could increase the lift coefficient more significantly and prevent flow separation. When momentum coefficient of the jet arrays is small, a larger <b>jet</b> <b>angle</b> of Actuator 2 is more effective in improving the maximum lift coefficient of airfoil.

Flow visualization {{was used to}} determine whether paired synthetic jet modules installed onto the surface of a supply diffuser could significantly impact room air distribution through changing the angle at which supply air left the diffuser when mixing into the room air. Control over the supply <b>jet</b> <b>angle</b> is directly related to how well the supply air mixes with the room air and the overall air quality of the room. A lab with a high air exchange rate (21 ACH) was selected to act as the environment to test the synthetic jets in.

Over the last decade, {{images of the}} ruff reveal that its orientation changes over time {{with respect to a}} fixed sky co-ordinate grid. For example, during two months of daily observations with the VLBA by Mioduszewski et al. (2004), a steady rotation through ∼ 10 ◦ is observed whilst the <b>jet</b> <b>angle</b> changes by ∼ 20 ◦.

40|$|All massive nearby galaxies, {{including}} our own, host supermassive black holes. Active galactic nuclei (AGN) are seen when such black holes accrete, {{and when they}} produce powerful jets of synchrotron-emitting plasma, they are termed radio-loud AGN. The close correlation between black hole mass and galaxy bulge mass in elliptical galaxies indicates that AGN feedback {{may be the key}} to the regulation of galaxy formation. It is thus necessary to fully understand the structure of AGN, the way that they are fuelled, and their duty cycle, in order to study the feedback processes and get a clear picture of galaxy formation. In this thesis, independent methods are developed to constrain the accretion disk and radio <b>jet</b> <b>angles</b> to the line of sight. H IX emission from a sub-sample of high-redshift quasars is measured from near-infrared spectroscopy and modelled as sums of different components, including the characteristic double-peaked profile which results from a thin, rotating accretion disk. Comparing the models using Bayesian evidence, almost all quasars were found to have infrared spectra consistent with the presence of a disk. The <b>jet</b> inclination <b>angles</b> of the same set of quasars were constrained by fitting a model, including the effect of Doppler boosting and the receding torus model for dust obscuration, to the radio spectral energy distribution. The fitted disk and <b>jet</b> <b>angles</b> correlate strongly, and are consistent with a model in which the radio jets are launched orthogonally to the plane of the accretion disk, as expected if the jet is powered by energy drawn from the spin of the black hole. Both disk and <b>jet</b> <b>angles</b> correlate with the observed linear source size, which is a projection effect; when deprojected using the fitted angles, the distribution of source sizes agrees with a scenario in which the sources expand into the surrounding medium at a constant rate up to 1 Mpc and then shut off, probably as the nuclei become quiescent. The accretion disk angle was found to correlate weakly with the low-frequency radio luminosity, which provides direct, albeit tenuous, evidence for the receding torus model.

40|$|Sand erosion {{studies of}} {{thermally}} sprayed WC [...] -Co [...] -Cr (Denotation-Gun LW 45) have been undertaken using a sand/water jet impingement rig. Results are presented which {{show that the}} erosion rate of sprayed compared to sintered tungsten carbide-cobalt-chrome is similar for low energy impacts but the sintered material outperforms by 4 times the sprayed material for high energy impacts. This reflects the anisotropic microstructure of the thermally sprayed coating with a preferred crack propagation parallel to the coating surface followed by crack interlinking and spalling. This is the dominant erosion mechanism present. A minor erosion mechanism consists of micro-cutting and ploughing at low angles of particle impact. The coatings have a relatively high density of defects including thermal stress induced transverse cracks, voids, oxides, and grit blasting remnants. Such defects are shown to accelerate the erosion process considerably because they aid crack initiation and growth leading to partial, mono or multi-splat spalling of loose material. The influence of slurry <b>jet</b> <b>angle</b> {{was found to be}} more pronounced under low energy conditions where maximum erosion occurred at 90 ° and the minimum at 30 ° in contrast to the high energy erosion rates which were independent of <b>jet</b> <b>angle.</b> This {{is a result of the}} lower levels of fluctuating stresses imparted to the coating during low energy impacts leading to the impact angle having a greater effect on sub critical growth rate than for the high energy conditions...|$|E

Hydrogen and helium were injected at pressures ranging from 1. 3 bar to 104 bar into chamber densities ranging from 1. 15 to 12. 8 kg/m 3, resulting in jets spanning from subsonic to highly underexpanded conditions. The jet tip penetration rate {{was found to}} increase with injection pressure, and decrease with increasing chamber density, as expected.

The film-cooling fluid injection from slots or holes into a cross flow produces highly complicated flow,fields. In this paper, the time-averaged Navier-Stokes equations were solved on a collocated body-fitted grid system with the shear stress transport k-omega, V 2 F k-epsilon, and stress-omega turbulence models. The fluid flow and turbulent Reynolds stress fields were compared to the LDV experiments for three <b>jet</b> <b>angles,</b> namely, 30, 60, and 90 deg, and the jet blowing ratio is ranging from 2 to 9. Good agreement was obtained. Therefore, the present solution procedure was also adopted to calculations of 15 and 40 deg jets. In addition, the temperature fields were computed with a simple eddy diffusivity model to obtain the film-cooling effectiveness, which, in turn, was used for evaluation of the various jet cross-flow arrangements.
