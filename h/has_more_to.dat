5|$|Jesus for President {{is divided}} into four chapters, the first two of which {{summarize}} the Bible from a New Monastic perspective. The summary of the Old Testament argues that the Israelites had a unique political philosophy, but that they {{failed to live up}} to its implications. The New Testament summary considers Jesus' politics and the qualities of the Christian Church. The third chapter suggests implications of this narrative for citizens of the United States, who the authors describe as members of an empire similar to that of the Romans. This chapter argues that the Book of Revelation <b>has</b> <b>more</b> <b>to</b> do with living faithfully in an evil empire than with eschatology. The chapter also asserts that Constantinianism had generally negative consequences for the Church. The fourth chapter tells of Christians living in countercultural ways that model divine redemption towards others. Other stories involve heterodox economics, defending the homeless, Amish forgiveness, dumpster diving, missional robotics, Martin Luther King Jr., anti-war protests, and The Simple Way.|$|E
5|$|Malcolm's kingdom did {{not extend}} over the full {{territory}} of modern Scotland: {{the north and west}} of Scotland remained under Scandinavian, Norse-Gael, and Gaelic rule, and the territories under the rule of the Kings of Scots {{did not extend}} much beyond the limits established by Malcolm II until the 12th century. Malcolm III fought a series of wars against the Kingdom of England, which may have had as its objective the conquest of the English earldom of Northumbria. These wars did not result in any significant advances southward. Malcolm's primary achievement was to continue a lineage that ruled Scotland for many years, although his role as founder of a dynasty <b>has</b> <b>more</b> <b>to</b> do with the propaganda of his youngest son David I and his descendants than with history.|$|E
25|$|Latter Day Saints {{generally}} {{share an}} open canon. While different sects believe in different revelations, a {{central theme of}} the Latter Day Saint movement is that God always <b>has</b> <b>more</b> <b>to</b> say to the church, because the church's situation is always changing.|$|E

25|$|The {{suppression}} of the Uyghurs <b>has</b> <b>more</b> <b>to</b> do with separatism than religion. China banned a book, Xing Fengsu (Sexual Customs), which insulted Islam and arrested its authors in 1989 after protests in Lanzhou and Beijing by Chinese Hui Muslims. The Chinese government acceded to their demands because the Hui {{do not have a}} separatist movement. Hui protestors who vandalized property during the protests against the book went unpunished, while Uyghur protestors were imprisoned.|$|E
25|$|Calculable loss: There are two {{elements}} {{that must be}} at least estimable, if not formally calculable: the probability of loss, and the attendant cost. Probability of loss is generally an empirical exercise, while cost <b>has</b> <b>more</b> <b>to</b> do with the ability of a reasonable person in possession of a copy of the insurance policy and a proof of loss associated with a claim presented under that policy to make a reasonably definite and objective evaluation of the amount of the loss recoverable {{as a result of the}} claim.|$|E
25|$|Often, if {{the skill}} {{is being used}} in a common or {{practical}} way, people will consider it a craft instead of art. Likewise, if the skill is being used in a commercial or industrial way, it may be considered commercial art instead of fine art. On the other hand, crafts and design are sometimes considered applied art. Some art followers {{have argued that the}} difference between fine art and applied art <b>has</b> <b>more</b> <b>to</b> do with value judgments made about the art than any clear definitional difference. However, even fine art often has goals beyond pure creativity and self-expression. The purpose of works of art may be to communicate ideas, such as in politically, spiritually, or philosophically motivated art; {{to create a sense of}} beauty (see aesthetics); to explore the nature of perception; for pleasure; or to generate strong emotions. The purpose may also be seemingly nonexistent.|$|E

25|$|Scientists {{agree that}} the event that {{separated}} myoglobin from hemoglobin occurred after lampreys diverged from jawed vertebrates. This separation of myoglobin and hemoglobin allowed for the different functions of the two molecules to arise and develop: myoglobin <b>has</b> <b>more</b> <b>to</b> do with oxygen storage while hemoglobin is tasked with oxygen transport. The α- and β-like globin genes encode the individual subunits of the protein. The predecessors of these genes arose through another duplication event also after the gnathosome common ancestor derived from jawless fish, approximately 450–500 million years ago. The development of α and β genes created the potential for hemoglobin to be composed of multiple subunits, a physical composition central to hemoglobin's ability to transport oxygen. Having multiple subunits contributes to hemoglobin's ability to bind oxygen cooperatively as well as be regulated allosterically. Subsequently, the α gene also underwent a duplication event to form the HBA1 and HBA2 genes. These further duplications and divergences have created a diverse range of α- and β-like globin genes that are regulated so that certain forms occur {{at different stages of}} development.|$|E
25|$|Kebatinan or Kejawen (Javanese beliefs) or Kepercayaan kepada Tuhan Yang Maha Esa (Believer of One Supreme God) is {{an amalgam}} of animism, Hindu-Buddhist, and Islamic — {{especially}} Sufi — beliefs. The beliefs is rooted in Javanese history and spiritualism with the tendency to syncretise aspects of different religions {{in search of the}} common ground. This loosely organised current of thought and practice was legitimised in the 1945 constitution and, in 1973, when it was recognised as Kepercayaan kepada Tuhan Yang Maha Esa (Indonesian: Believer of One Supreme God) that somewhat gain the status as one of the agama, President Suharto counted himself as one of its adherents. The Kebatinan or Kepercayaan have no certain prophet, sacred book, nor distinct religious festivals and rituals; it <b>has</b> <b>more</b> <b>to</b> do with each adherents internalised transcendental vision and beliefs in their relations with others and with the supreme being. As the result there is an inclusiveness that the kebatinan believer could identify themselves with one of six officially recognised religions, at least in their identity card, while still subscribe to their kebatinan belief and way of life.|$|E
25|$|Compared {{to many of}} {{the other}} depictions of Arthur's story, the Alliterative Morte Arthure is a {{relatively}} realistic version of events. There are few of the fantastical elements which often surround the legend and the story focuses more on Arthur's skill as a warrior king. The stress placed on chivalric duty in the contemporary Sir Gawain and the Green Knight is in the Morte Arthure of a more practical nature and <b>has</b> <b>more</b> <b>to</b> do with personal loyalty. Also the Morte Arthure is less clearly part of the romance genre than Sir Gawain and other Arthurian poems and more like a chronicle of the times. It contains little of the magic and symbolism of these other works, with no mention of Merlin, although it does use the literary device of the dream vision common in courtly romance and Chaucer. (In this case, however, the dream vision of a dragon (representing Arthur) fighting a monster is more clearly derived from the Dream of Mordecai in one of the longer Greek versions of the Book of Esther.) Arthur is a more political and also flawed ruler, the story is not just based in a small realm but is always placed within a wider European situation and this Arthur is more clearly Christian than other versions. Arthur also has two legendary swords, the first being Excalibur (referred to as Caliburn, an earlier name of the sword), and the second one being Clarent, a formal sword, stolen by the evil Mordred, with which Arthur receives his fatal blow close to the banks of the Tamar.|$|E

Choe Kwang-shik, the South Korean Minister of Culture, Sports and Tourism, told reporters that [...] "Gangnam Style" [...] had {{played an important role in}} introducing the Korean culture, language, and lifestyle to the rest of the world. However, some have criticized the song for failing to accurately represent South Korean culture. Oh Young-Jin, managing editor of The Korea Times, wrote that the dance <b>has</b> <b>more</b> <b>to</b> do with Americans than Koreans.|$|E

The family currently lives in Los Angeles County, California, having relocated from London. With his children raised in his wife's Jewish faith, McGregor has said, [...] "My involvement in religion <b>has</b> <b>more</b> <b>to</b> do with the Jewish faith now and not the Christian faith, which I was very vaguely brought up in." ...|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} with Shave Magazine, Ben Gibbard commented on his song writing saying that he [...] "never sit down to write an album number one. I just kind of sit down and write songs and the theme kind of makes itself apparent. But I would never say I was writing about searching for something as much as just trying to document with every song where I am in that moment when I’m writing that song. If a theme kind of makes itself apparent in a record, it <b>has</b> <b>more</b> <b>to</b> {{do with the fact}} that just what’s been on my mind recently. So I guess clearly I have been and was and am, but it was never a conscious decision." ...|$|E
500|$|Brian Lowry, {{writing for}} Variety, found the episode to be [...] "OK", finding some {{dialogue}} to be [...] "a little precious and clunky" [...] and feeling the plot to be [...] "yet another twist on a procedural, albeit {{with a few}} mythological elements to sweeten the experience", summing that [...] "with great boxoffice and ostentatious synergy come super-sized expectations." [...] Tim Goodman of The Hollywood Reporter was not sure from the pilot whether the series {{would go on to}} be good or not. He thought that having Joss Whedon's name attached the project would lead to positive reviews for at least a month. Goodman said that [...] "It's a fun hour and calling it 'good but not great' <b>has</b> <b>more</b> <b>to</b> do with expectations {{in the wake of the}} Marvel movies than anything else." ...|$|E

500|$|Walter Jackson Bate {{states that}} the poem has [...] "always puzzled readers [...] But finding the poem so elusive, we return to it only after we know the others far better. If we had hope to use them as keys, we {{discover}} they do not quite fit the lock. Meanwhile they have given us a standard hard to equal. Hence we either feel a disappointment about the 'Ode to Psyche' or else, remembering the care Keats supposedly gave it, we once more put the poem aside for future consideration." [...] However, he also states that [...] "The modern, respectful attitude toward this ode is deserved. But the itch for novelty has encouraged a few critics {{to suggest that the}} poem, in some dark but fundamental way, <b>has</b> <b>more</b> <b>to</b> it as a whole than do the later odes." ...|$|E
500|$|There is {{widespread}} {{frustration with the}} land title system. [...] Privatising home ownership {{and the creation of}} a market economy with long term leases is seen by some commentators as the best option to move forward on Palm. [...] This proposal is described as giving Indigenous people [...] "skin in the game" [...] and empowerment. [...] In the period 1999 to 2007 35houses were replaced due to damage. [...] Noel Pearson of the Cape York Institute for Policy and Leadership argues that housing degradation in these communities <b>has</b> <b>more</b> <b>to</b> do with overcrowding and poor construction than it does with poor tenancy. [...] However he adds that Aboriginal people naturally take much better care of property that they have constructed or paid for themselves, than they do that which has been handed to them 'on a plate' and which they have had little personal engagement in. [...] The push for privatisation of title was led by the Australian Government (through Mal Brough, Indigenous Affairs Minister), Noel Pearson, and some families on the island (the community is very divided on this issue). The proposal had partial (or cautious) support from the then Federal Australian Labor Party Opposition.|$|E
500|$|... "Rumors" [...] {{received}} generally {{mixed reviews}} from music critics, however {{it has become}} one of Lohan's most recognized songs and has now been labeled as [...] "cult pop treasure". Charles Merwin of Stylus Magazine thought that [...] "Rumors" [...] was not a good choice for a single, stating, [...] "in fact, for a girl, that has been tagged as America’s next sweetheart by some media outlets, it might be the worst choice of subject matter for the opening statement from a girl that automatically <b>has</b> <b>more</b> <b>to</b> prove to audiences because of her stature as an actress. Unfortunately, 'Rumors' is about as good as it gets." [...] Erik Missio of ChartAttack thought that the song [...] "presented potential for a semi-palatable debut effort", but further added that it is a [...] "crap of a spectularly unspectacular level." [...] Entertainment Weekly contributor Nicholas Fonseca, however, considered [...] "Rumors" [...] a guilty pleasure, while Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic selected the song a Track Pick in the review of Speak. IGN's Spence D. described it as [...] "pervasively infectious, the kind of track that will no doubt keep the dance floors sweaty and steamy for a few months to come." [...] John Murphy of musicOMH praised [...] "Rumors" [...] as a departure from Speaks soft rock genre.|$|E
