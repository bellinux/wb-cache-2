5|$|Virginia Dare: The {{daughter}} of Ananias Dare, {{and the first}} English child born in the Americas. In this world, the Roanoke Colony did not <b>disappear</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1580s; when Steve Rogers went into this world he saved the colony, {{which would have been}} killed by starvation. Dare touches the rift caused by Roger's arrival. She has the ability to transform into white-furred animals when frightened, which she later learns to control, and appears to be the equivalent to Alpha Flight's Snowbird who has a similar appearance and powers, though Neil Gaiman had denied this.|$|E

5|$|Moving on to 300 AF Cocoon, {{the pair}} find Snow {{fighting}} a giant paradox-fueled monster that is dissolving the crystal pillar. After resolving the paradox, which delays {{the fall of}} Cocoon until 500 AF, Snow disappears again as an anomaly from another time. The pair {{then go to the}} city of Academia on Gran Pulse in 400 AF where they are attacked by the city's AI, which claims they were killed in 200 AF. Traveling to 200 AF, they discover a paradox whereby a man-made fal'Cie meant to re-levitate Cocoon was able to turn on its creators using the AI that designed it and take over the government. Resolving the paradox, Noel and Serah travel to an alternative 400 AF Academia. In this world, the pair find Hope and Alyssa again, who had put themselves in stasis. They explain their new plan to mechanically float a new Cocoon to hold humanity, which Serah and Noel help with before heading to 500 AF Academia. They are betrayed by Alyssa (revealed to be a living paradox doomed to <b>disappear</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> corrected timeline) and trapped by Caius in dream-worlds. Before being trapped, Serah meets the spirit of Yeul, who explains that she is the seeress of Paddra, continually reincarnated throughout history, while Caius is her immortal guardian, gifted with Etro's own heart.|$|E
5|$|The single's {{music video}} was filmed at the Brooklyn Academy of Music {{during the fall}} of 1998. The video begins with Houston {{entering}} a small arena as she begins to sing the song's first verse. As she finishes her part, Carey appears on the stage as well, performing the second verse and chorus. The video {{is set in a}} dark studio accented by Egyptian settings, backdrops, and scenes inspired by The Prince of Egypt. An audience is on hand to emulate a concert-like-setting, cheering on both singers. Occasionally, home video clips of Carey and Houston appear throughout the video, as well as clips of the final moments of the film, during the splitting of the Red Sea. The video ends as the room is illuminated, and the two singers are joined by a large choir. As they complete the song, Carey and Houston receive a standing ovation from the crowd, and exit the studio together, walking side by side as they <b>disappear</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> distance. For the video, Carey and Houston both donned similar low-cut black gowns, while Carey sported a long straight hairstyle, and Houston a pixie cut.|$|E
5|$|Facing {{the task}} force unit, she fights the head of Tower's {{security}} forces Kutō, killing him after he uses a vial of Saya's blood to transform into an Elder Bairn hybrid. Finding Fumito in the building's basement, she also finds Kuroto with him, before succumbing to a drug given by Kuroto. Fumito and Kuroto were working together, with each killing the others' families {{to take control of}} Tower and Seventh Heaven, and Saya also learns that the Elder Bairn who tried to kill Mana was Mana's father. Fumito reveals he intends to dissolve Shrovetide with Saya's help as the ratio of humans to Elder Bairns has shifted drastically due to the Elder Bairn seemingly dying out. When Kuroto attempts to kill him for abandoning his role, Fumito stabs him with a phial of Saya's blood, transforming Kuroto into an Elder Bairn seed. As Saya recovers from the drug, Fumito fuses with the seed, which hatches into a giant Elder Bairn which Saya slays. A weakened Fumito reveals that he transformed himself into an Elder Bairn hybrid to become closer to Saya and free her from her oath not to feed on humans. Accepting that he has lost their wager, he impales himself on Saya's sword. Saddened at being left alone again, Saya does not return to SIRRUT, instead opting to <b>disappear.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> aftermath, Yūka becomes Tokyo's governor and repeals the Youth Ordinance Bill, the members of SIRRUT return to a normal life, and Mana begins searching for Saya.|$|E

5|$|Fei {{sets out}} to destroy Deus and free the Wave Existence and Elly. In Merkaba, the party defeats Deus, but they realize that the energy {{released}} from the Wave Existence's shift will destroy the planet. Elly, inside Deus, tries to move {{it away from the}} planet and Fei, in his Xenogears, follows to save her, but both <b>disappear</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> rift. Krelian confronts them, telling Fei he only sought to end the pain and suffering that comes with human existence by reverting everything back to when it all began, when all was one, to ascend to the realm of God. Fei rejects Krelian's ideology with his love for Elly, but Krelian challenges Fei, telling him to prove this love that could make him independent of God, and calls forth Urobolus, a gigantic serpent-like incarnation of Miang. Xenogears appears and Fei uses it to defeat Urobolus. Krelian releases Elly and reveals to Fei that he had planned to become one with God along with Elly. During her time with Krelian, Elly had seen inside his heart and realized it was full of sadness and despair for all the atrocities he had committed. Despite everything, Elly says that Krelian truly loved people more than anyone else. Because no one will forgive his sins, he declines Fei's offer to return and ascends to a higher plain of existence along with the Wave Existence, telling Fei and Elly that he envies them. Fei and Elly then return to their planet along with Xenogears and reunite {{with the rest of the}} party.|$|E

25|$|Due to the {{hot summer}} and low precipitation, most of Xinjiang is endorheic, i.e. its rivers either <b>disappear</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> desert, or {{terminate}} in salt lakes (within Xinjiang itself, or in the neighboring Kazakhstan), instead of flowing toward an ocean. The only exception is the northernmost part of the region, where the Irtysh River, originating in the Altai Mountains, flows (via Kazakhstan and Russia) toward the Arctic Ocean. Even then, {{a significant part of}} this river's waters is now artificially diverted, via the Irtysh–Karamay–Ürümqi Canal, to the drier areas of southern Dzungarian Basin.|$|E
25|$|It is {{said that}} in a soy sauce shop long ago, in Totsuka-juku of the 53 Stations of the Tōkaidō (now Totsuka-ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa Prefecture), it {{sometimes}} happened that napkins would <b>disappear</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> night one by one. One night, when the proprietor of the soy sauce shop went out on a job, he heard some bustling music from {{a place where there}} should have been no people around. When he looked, there were several cats gathered, and there in the center was a strange sight: the shopkeeper's pet cat, wearing a napkin on its head and dancing. That explained why his napkins had been going missing.|$|E
25|$|Brachiosaurus {{is one of}} {{the best-known}} members of the Brachiosauridae, and was once thought to be the largest land animal to ever live. Brachiosaurids thrived in the regions which are now North and South America, Africa, Europe, and Asia. They first appear in the fossil record in the Late Jurassic Period and <b>disappear</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> late Early Cretaceous Period. The broad {{distribution}} of Brachiosauridae in both northern and southern continents suggests that the group originated prior to the breakup of Pangaea. In the Early Cretaceous the distribution of the group is dramatically reduced. It is still unclear whether this reduction is due to local extinctions or to the limited nature of the Early Cretaceous fossil record.|$|E

25|$|By using fictional biographies, many {{inspired}} by his own experiences, Kabakov has attempted to explain the birth and death of the Soviet Union, which {{he claims to be}} the first modern society to <b>disappear.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> Soviet Union, Kabakov discovers elements common to every modern society, and in doing so he examines the rift between capitalism and communism. Rather than depict the Soviet Union as a failed Socialist project defeated by Western economics, Kabakov describes it as one utopian project among many, capitalism included. By reexamining historical narratives and perspectives, Kabakov delivers a message that every project, whether public or private, important or trivial, has the potential to fail due to the potentially authoritarian will to power.|$|E

25|$|Some comic books, {{especially}} superhero comics of the mid-20th century, routinely use the {{exclamation point}} {{instead of the}} period, which means the character has just realized something; unlike when the question mark appears instead, which means the character is confused, surprised or {{they do not know}} what is happening. This tends to lead to exaggerated speech, in line with the other hyperboles common in comic books. A portion of the motivation, however, was simply that a period might <b>disappear</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> printing process used at the time, whereas an exclamation point would likely remain recognizable even if there was a printing glitch. For a short period Stan Lee, as Editor-in-Chief of Marvel Comics, attempted to curb their overuse by a short-lived ban on exclamation points altogether, which led to an inadvertent lack of ending punctuation on many sentences.|$|E
25|$|Although bark {{paper was}} banned, {{it did not}} {{completely}} <b>disappear.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> early colonial period, there was a shortage of European paper, which made it necessary to use the indigenous version on occasion. During the evangelization process, amate, along with a paste made from corn canes was appropriated by missionaries to create Christian images, mostly in the 16th and 17th century. In addition, among the indigenous, paper continued to be made clandestinely for ritual purposes. In 1569, friar Diego de Mendoza observed several indigenous carrying offerings of paper, copal and woven mats to the lakes inside the Nevado de Toluca volcano as offerings. The most successful at keeping paper making traditions alive were certain indigenous groups living in the La Huasteca, Ixhuatlán and Chicontepec {{in the north of}} Veracruz and some villages in Hidalgo. The only records of bark paper making after the early 1800s refer to these areas. Most of these areas are dominated by the Otomi and the area's ruggedness and isolation from central Spanish authority allowed small villages to keep small quantities of paper in production. In fact, this clandestine nature helped it to survive as a way to defy Spanish culture and reaffirm identity.|$|E
