5|$|The pudús are herbivorous, {{consuming}} vines, {{leaves from}} low trees, shrubs, succulent sprouts, herbs, ferns, blossoms, buds, tree bark, and fallen fruit.

5|$|Adults of {{different}} species infest {{different parts of}} the definitive host, for example the intestine, lungs, large blood vessels, and liver. The adults use a relatively large, muscular pharynx to ingest cells, cell fragments, mucus, body fluids or blood. In both the adults and the stages that live in snails, the external syncytium absorbs dissolved nutrients from the host. Adult digeneans can live without oxygen <b>for</b> <b>long</b> <b>periods.</b>|$|E
5|$|All Operation Crossroads {{operations}} {{were designed to}} keep personnel from being exposed to more than 0.1 roentgen (R) per day. At the time, this {{was considered to be}} an amount of radiation that could be tolerated <b>for</b> <b>long</b> <b>periods</b> without any harmful effects on health. Since there was no special clothing or radiation shielding available, the protection plan relied on managing who went where, when, and for how long.|$|E
5|$|Although Cuban iguanas {{typically}} remain still <b>for</b> <b>long</b> <b>periods</b> of {{time and}} have a slow lumbering gait due to their body mass, {{they are capable of}} quick bursts of speed for short distances. Younger animals are more arboreal and will seek refuge in trees, which they can climb with great agility. The animal is a capable swimmer and will take to nearby water if threatened. When cornered they can bite and lash their tails in defense.|$|E

5|$|During {{this long}} period {{the number of}} the Indians was greatly reduced. Their blood became so mixed that in many of them Indian traits were obliterated. They had no {{internal}} government, and they lived a sort of shiftless life, hunting, fishing, cultivating the ground 'Indian fashion' as a witness called it, and often leaving <b>for</b> <b>long</b> <b>periods</b> and working in some menial capacity for the whites.|$|E
5|$|Evidence {{of attack}} {{may be found}} in the form of tiny piles of book-dust and specks of frass. Damage may be {{concentrated}} in the spine, the projecting edges of pages and the cover. Prevention of attack relies on keeping books in cool, clean, dry positions with low humidity, and occasional inspections should be made. Treatment can be by freezing for lengthy periods, but some insect eggs are very resistant and can survive <b>for</b> <b>long</b> <b>periods</b> at low temperatures.|$|E

5|$|It {{can also}} enter as {{dissolved}} organic carbon through rivers and is converted by photosynthetic organisms into organic carbon. This can either be exchanged throughout the food chain or precipitated into the deeper, more carbon-rich layers as dead soft tissue or in shells and bones as calcium carbonate. It circulates in this layer <b>for</b> <b>long</b> <b>periods</b> of time before either being deposited as sediment or being returned to surface waters through thermohaline circulation.|$|E
5|$|Mercury(II) oxide, {{the main}} oxide of mercury, arises when the metal {{is exposed to}} air <b>for</b> <b>long</b> <b>periods</b> at {{elevated}} temperatures. It reverts to the elements upon heating near 400°C, as was demonstrated by Joseph Priestley in an early synthesis of pure oxygen. Hydroxides of mercury are poorly characterized, as they are for its neighbors gold and silver.|$|E
5|$|Molybdenum {{deficiency}} {{has also}} been reported {{as a consequence of}} non-molybdenum supplemented total parenteral nutrition (complete intravenous feeding) <b>for</b> <b>long</b> <b>periods</b> of time.

However (presumably since pure molybdenum deficiency from this cause occurs primarily in adults), the neurological consequences are not as marked as in cases of congenital cofactor deficiency.|$|E

40|$|By {{considering}} all possible high order diffracted waves, the authors investigate the spectral response of two-dimensional gratings for quantum well infrared photodetectors (QWIPs). A new method is proposed that using <b>long</b> <b>period</b> gratings may improve grating quality {{and reduce the}} resulting cross talk in grating-coupled QWIPs. A sensitivity analysis indicates that the influence of variation of the grating constant on the coupling efficiency is less sensitive <b>for</b> the <b>long</b> <b>period</b> gratings than <b>for</b> the short ones. A large coupling efficiency has been demonstrated <b>for</b> <b>long</b> <b>period</b> gratings. The calculated wide grating response spectra are in good agreement with the experiment result.
