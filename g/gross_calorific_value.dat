40|$|Coal {{mine fire}} {{is a major}} problem {{worldwide}} and has been a great concern both for the industry and researchers in this field. Majority of fires existing today in different coalfields are mainly due to spontaneous combustion of coal. Most mine fires start very small and gradually expand in size, thereby, causing loss of natural property, serious environmental pollution of land, water and air and considerable economic losses to the organisation. Although much research has been done on the subject, a proper assessment of the spontaneous heating susceptibility of coal needs to be done so that mine operators are notified well in advance and plan the working properly. Therefore, the determination of susceptibility of coals to spontaneous heating and their classification is essential to plan the production activities and optimise coal mine production within the incubation period. EXPERIMENTAL INVESTIGATION To carry out this study, coal samples were collected from the field using channel sampling. Samples from many seams from different coal mines were collected, sealed in air tight containers and carefully brought to the laboratory for further preparation. The collected samples were subject to coning, quartering and grinding. They were then screened to a size of - 212 micron and placed inside small air-tight bags.

40|$|Mine {{fires and}} {{spontaneous}} combustion are prime {{issues in the}} coal mining industry and have led to huge coal losses and mine disasters. The property of self-oxidation of coal makes it highly vulnerable to degradation after being exposed to favorable conditions of spontaneous heating. For safe storage and use of coal, {{it is very important}} to know about its liability to spontaneous heating. It is known that, spontaneous heating is dependent upon intrinsic and extrinsic parameters. In the present work, the spontaneous combustion susceptibility of a number of coal samples belonging to different coalfields have been studies and its correlation with different intrinsic properties have been carried out. In order to carry out the above study, 23 coal samples were collected from different Indian coalfields. Coal samples were collected from Singareni Collieries Company Ltd.

(ECL) [...] The experiments carried out to determine the intrinsic properties and susceptibility indices wereProximate analysis, Bomb calorimetry, Crossing point temperature, Differential thermal analysis and Wet oxidation potential. From correlation analysis, it was found that average slopes of stage IIA and IIB obtained from DTA thermograms indicated a fairly accurate measure of spontaneous heating susceptibility as they showed high correlation with the intrinsic properties. Moisture and volatile matter content may also be helpful in assessment of liability of coal to spontaneous heating as they showed better correlation than other intrinsic properties viz., ash content and <b>gross</b> <b>calorific</b> <b>values.</b> Differential thermal analysis was found to give better correlation and so may be accepted as a better method for assessment of spontaneous heating susceptibility of coal than crossing point temperature and wet oxidation potential analysis.

40|$|In view of {{continuous}} increase in energy demand, {{and the environmental}} and economic concerns {{associated with the use}} of conventional fuels have made scientists and technocrats to look for alternative renewable energy sources for power production. The inherent advantages of carbon neutrality, lower ash content, lower SOx and NOx emissions, and wide availability have made biomass as a prime source of power generation. In this article, three different components taken from residues of five different woody plant species have been considered which have no commercial use. These plant species are Ficus benghalensis (local name- Banyan), Azadirachta indica (local name- Neem), Ficus religiosa (local name- Pippal), Madhuca longifolia (local name- Mahua) and Eucalyptus globulus (local name- Eucalyptus). Proximate analyses and <b>gross</b> <b>calorific</b> <b>values</b> (GCV) of all the biomass species including a coal sample have been determined. Among all the five biomass species studied, the fixed carbon content (FC) in Neem bark was observed to be the highest while its leaf has the lowest value, the volatile matter content (VM) in both Mahua branch and Eucalyptus leaf is the highest while Pippal bark has the lowest and the ash content (A) in bark of Mahua is the highest while the leaf of Eucalyptus biomass species has the lowest ash content. Similarly, the leaf of Eucalyptus is the most suitable one with the highest <b>calorific</b> <b>value</b> followed by leaves of Pippal and Mahua. Next in the order, the barks of Banyan and Neem, and the branches of Pippal, Mahua and Eucalyptus were also found to have considerably high amount of energy contents suitable for power generation. In addition, bulk densities of all the biomass species including the coal sample have been determined. Leaves of all the biomass species have been found to have lower bulk densities as compared to their barks and branches. It is worthy to note that among all the studied biomass species, branch of Eucalyptus has the highest bulk density while leaf of Neem has the lowest. Further, the ash fusion temperatures of some selected components of Banyan, Neem, Pippal and Mahua Page | XII biomass have been measured as these temperatures are the influential factors for the determination of bed agglomeration and other boiler fouling related problems. The results showed comparatively higher values of softening temperature ST (1077 - 1329 0 C) and hemispherical temperature HT (1193 - 1450 0 C) indicating safe boiler operation. Leaf and branch of Pippal and leaf and bark of Mahua were separately mixed with coal sample in different ratios, and their various percentage compositions related to proximate analyses and energy values were determined to explore the best coal-biomass mixture for power generation. It is evident from the results that the ash content decreased and volatile matter increased when the biomass percentage increased in the coal-biomass blend. The ultimate analysis has also been carried out on selected biomass species of Banyan, Mahua and Pippal. Carbon and Hydrogen contents of both Pippal and Mahua leaf were found to be higher and their corresponding <b>calorific</b> <b>values</b> were also high. The variation in energy values of plant components is undoubtedly related to the combined effects of their C and H contents. As the <b>calorific</b> <b>value</b> is the most salient property of any fuel, including biomass fuel, an attempt has been made to derive numerous regression equations using proximate and ultimate analysis data for prediction of <b>gross</b> <b>calorific</b> <b>values</b> of studied biomass species. The equations have been obtained statistically using regression analysis. The two linear regression equations with the best results obtained on the basis of proximate and ultimate analyses are GCV = – 49. 02 + 0. 968 ×FC + 0. 719 ×VM + 0. 459 ×A and GCV = 9. 8 + 0. 0613 ×O – 1. 44 ×N – 0. 829 ×C + 8. 18 ×H respectively. The two nonlinear regression equations with best results obtained are GCV = 237. 85 – 8. 278 ×M – 5. 723 ×VM – 3. 098 ×FC – 0. 055 ×M 2 + 0. 129 M×VM + 0. 089 ×M×FC + 0. 0319 ×VM 2 + 0. 061 ×VM×FC – 0. 021 ×FC 2 and GCV = 70. 408 + 0. 153 ×O – 3. 115 ×C + 1. 035 ×H – 0. 041 ×O 2 + 0. 101 ×O×C – 0. 069 ×O×H – 0. 0317 ×C 2 + 1. 217 ×H 2 respectively. The results regarding computation of land requirement show that around 84, 618, 254, 148 and 289 hectares of land area are needed for energy plantation considering Page | XIII Banyan, Neem, Pippal, Mahua and Eucalyptus biomass species respectively. The above calculation serves the purpose of electricity generation of 7300 MWh per year for a cluster of 10 - 15 villages on decentralized power generation mode. Further, the requirements of blends of coal-Pippal branch and coal-Mahua bark to generate 7300 MWh/year of electricity was calculated and it was observed that the requirement of coal decreases with increase in the percentage of biomass in these blends. In case of coal-Pippal branch blend, the requirement of coal decreased from 5798 t/year to 5038 t/year and in coal-Mahua bark blend, coal requirement reduced from 5798 t/year to 5076 t/year as both biomass contents increased from 0 to 15...|$|R

Additionally, the increasing rate of harmful emissions especially carbon dioxide from the increased usage of fossil fuels have led to the need for more environmentally friendly replacement fuels. Presently, bio-oil originating from biomass has been proposed as an alternative fuel to fossil diesel. The aim of this research project is to optimally produce bio-oil in terms of quantity and quality from Jatropha curcas waste by using conventional and fast pyrolysis methods. Jatropha curcas shrub, which can be planted economically in tropical regions like Malaysia, is typically planted as a source of inedible oil for biodiesel production. The leftover pressed cake after oil extraction is an agricultural waste, which can be upgraded into fuel via pyrolysis. In this project, the pyrolysis parameters to achieve optimum quantity and quality of bio-oil from Jatropha curcas waste were determined. To achieve this, two fixed-bed pyrolysis rigs for conventional and fast pyrolysis processes were designed and fabricated, and a corresponding Design of Experiment was performed. By considering yield, <b>calorific</b> <b>value,</b> water content and acidity, the results from both methods were mathematically modelled after comparison and the optimum parameters for both methods were determined. The validated models of conventional and fast pyrolysis showed that optimum combined quantity and quality of bio-oil occur at reaction temperatures of 800 K and 747 K respectively but at the same nitrogen linear velocity of 0. 0078 cm/s. At these optimum conditions, conventional and fast pyrolysis yield 50. 08 wt% and 40. 08 wt% of bio-oil with <b>gross</b> <b>calorific</b> <b>values</b> of 15. 12 MJ/kg and 16. 92 MJ/kg, water contents of 28. 34 wt% and 28. 02 wt%, and pH values of 6. 77 and 7. 01, respectively. The produced bio-oils from both rigs at their optimum points were dehydrated, and the physicochemical characteristics of the dehydrated bio-oils from both rigs were compared to standard specifications for burner biofuels. Based on ASTM D 7554 - 10 standard for burner biofuel specifications, by reducing the sulphur contents, both dehydrated bio-oils can be used as burner fuel without any further processes. Finally, both 10 % of optimised and dehydrated bio-oils emulsified in 90 % diesel were tested and compared to EN 590, the European standards for diesel used in commercial diesel engines and ASTM D 6751 - 01, the standard biodiesel specifications. In addition to sulphur content, if the water content of both of these emulsified dehydrated bio-oils are removed, they can be commercially used as diesel fuel in diesel engines because their solid content, kinematic viscosity, ash content, flash point, cetane number and copper corrosion strip test results are within the range of EN 590 standard...|$|R

The method for the wood fuel property improvement selected in this paper is torrefaction. This study is conducted in order to evaluate the changes in fuel properties of coniferous forest residue, in particular, spruce and pine needles and twigs, influenced by torrefaction. In this study eight different samples are prepared according to a three-factor experimental design. The moisture content, <b>gross</b> and net <b>calorific</b> <b>value</b> and ash content is determined in laboratory conditions. The results are analysed, and a comparison with other biomass types is carried out...|$|R
30|$|Finally, {{optimization}} {{was done}} to determine {{a combination of the}} three factors that produced briquette with the best properties. In this study, <b>gross</b> <b>calorific</b> <b>value</b> was chosen as an optimization parameter to evaluate the thermal property of briquette, whereas ash content was left out because it had a small range. On the other hand, shatter index was used as optimization parameter for evaluating the briquette strength. By utilizing optimization code available in Design Expert software, it was established that optimized values of <b>gross</b> <b>calorific</b> <b>value</b> and shatter index are 29.031  MJ/kg and 80.363 %, respectively, for 50  MPa compaction pressure, 29.512  °C drying temperature and 10 % molasses mass ratio. At this point, ash content, moisture content and relaxed density of briquettes are 3.244, 16.032 % and 1.107  g/cm 3, respectively.|$|E
40|$|In {{recent years}} {{biofuels}} have obtained a considerable interest, {{due to the}} implementation of ruling and gradual replacement of fossil fuels. One of production steps at gaining the oil is a pressing process. Wastes come into being from this process. These wastes are used as feed, fertilizer prospectively as fuel. A contemporary scientific literature pays attention namely to one of prospective produces which is a produce of the tropical and subtropical zones Jatropa curcas. Tests were performed at Jatropha Curcas seeds of a brown colour (that means gnaw). The aim of a research is an analysis of Jatropa curcas seed from the utilization {{point of view of the}} <b>gross</b> <b>calorific</b> <b>value.</b> The basic instrument to evaluate the <b>gross</b> <b>calorific</b> <b>value</b> of each variant of the experiment was a calorimeter PARR 6200 and digital scales for accurate laboratory weighing...|$|E
30|$|The <b>Gross</b> <b>calorific</b> <b>value</b> of the {{biodiesel}} {{was determined}} using an automatic adiabatic bomb calorimeter (Changsha Kaiyuan Instruments Co., 5 E- 1 AC/ML). The sample (1 ml biodiesel) was oxidized by combustion in an adiabatic bomb containing 3.1 Mpsi oxygen under pressure.

40|$|This work {{analysed}} {{the influence}} of storage {{in the quality of}} forest biomass for energy generation in the region of Lages, Brazil. Logs of Pinus taeda L. and Eucalyptus dunnii Maiden were harvested and piled during the four different seasons: spring, summer, fall and winter. The analyses were performed immediately after harvesting (without being stored), after two, four and six months of storage. The evaluated properties were: moisture content, <b>gross</b> and net <b>calorific</b> <b>value,</b> ash content and solubility in cold water, hot water and sodium hydroxide. The species composition, storage span, harvesting season and storage season influenced the forest biomass characteristics. In general, eucalyptus presented better results than pine, losing moisture faster, having less alteration in the chemical composition and producing greater energetic gain over storage time. For both species, the ideal storage time was four months. Furthermore, spring and summer were the best harvesting seasons. Thus, if the forest biomass is harvested at the end of winter or beginning of spring with subsequent storage during the summer, this biomass will have the best performance for energy production.

40|$|With 2020 energy targets set {{out by the}} EU fast approaching, the UK {{is trying}} to source a higher {{proportion}} of its energy from renewable resources. Coupled with this, a growing population and increasing trends in consumer demand have resulted in national waste loads increasing. A possible solution to both issues is energy-from-waste (EfW) technologies. Many studies have focused on municipal solid waste (MSW) as a potential feedstock, but appear to overlook the potential benefits of commercial and industrial waste (C&IW). In this study, samples of C&IW were collected from three North West waste management companies and Lancaster University campus. The samples were tested for their <b>gross</b> and net <b>calorific</b> <b>value,</b> moisture content, ash content, volatile matter, and also elemental composition to determine their suitability in EfW systems. Intra-sample analysis showed there to be little variation between samples with the exception two samples, from waste management site 3, which showed extensive variation with regards to net <b>calorific</b> <b>value,</b> ash content, and elemental analysis. Comparisons with known fuel types revealed similarities between the sampled C&IW, MSW, and refuse derived fuel (RDF) thereby justifying its potential for use in EfW systems. Mean net <b>calorific</b> <b>value</b> (NCV) was calculated as 9. 47 MJ/kg and concentrations of sulphur, nitrogen, and chlorine were found to be below 2 %. Potential electrical output was calculated using the NCV of the sampled C&IW coupled with four differing energy generation technologies. Using a conventional incinerator with steam cycle, total electrical output was calculated as 24. 9 GWh, based on a plant operating at 100, 000 tpa. This value rose to 27. 0 GWh when using an integrated gasification combined cycle. A final aspect {{of this study was to}} deduce the potential total national electrical output if all suitable C&IW were to be used in EfW systems. Using incineration coupled with a steam turbine, this was determined to be 6 TWh, 1. 9 % of the national demand thereby contributing 6. 5 % towards the UK’s 2020 renewable electricity target...|$|R
40|$|Wet and dry <b>calorific</b> <b>values</b> (energy densities) {{and total}} energy content of lesser sandeel Ammodytes marinus, sprat Sprattus sprattus, Atlantic herring Clupea harengus, whiting Merlangius merlangus, saithe Pollachius virens and cod Gadus morhua, were measured. <b>Calorific</b> <b>values</b> varied {{both within and}} between species. Larger fish tended to have higher <b>calorific</b> <b>values</b> than small ones, {{particularly}} when considered in terms of wet weight, but there was considerable temporal variation. The <b>calorific</b> <b>values</b> and body weights of sandeels larger than 10 cm showed marked seasonal trends and in consequence the total energy content of a sandeel of given length in summer is approximately double the spring <b>value.</b> The <b>calorific</b> <b>values</b> of herring and sprat also varied from month to month but seasonal cycles were less obvious. Whiting varied least. Both <b>calorific</b> <b>values</b> and total energy content of individual sprat were very variable in summer (the spawning season of this species). Because {{there is so much}} intraspecific variation, care must be taken when assessing the relative merits (in terms of energy) of different species as prey. The practical difficulties of obtaining reliable data on wet <b>calorific</b> <b>values</b> are discussed and the use of dry <b>calorific</b> <b>values</b> and dry weight/length relationships is recommended. ...|$|R
