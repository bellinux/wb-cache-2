5|$|The {{variety of}} fruits and {{vegetables}} that Bengal has to offer <b>is</b> <b>incredible.</b> A host of gourds, roots and tubers, leafy greens, succulent stalks, lemons and limes, green and purple eggplants, red onions, plantain, broad beans, okra, banana tree stems and flowers, green jackfruit, and red pumpkins {{are to be found in}} the markets popularly known as anaj bazaar. Panta bhat (rice soaked overnight in water) with onion and green chili is a traditional dish consumed in rural areas. Common spices found in a Bengali kitchen are cumin, ajmoda (radhuni), bay leaf, mustard, ginger, green chillies, and turmeric. People of erstwhile East Bengal use a lot of ajmoda, coriander leaves, tamarind, coconut, and mustard in their cooking while those aboriginally from West Bengal use a lot of sugar, garam masala, and red chilli powder. Vegetarian dishes are mostly prepared without onion and garlic.|$|E

25|$|I'm {{not saying}} the whole {{audience}} {{gave us a}} standing ovation, but there was this sizable standing ovation there. And I thought: 'This <b>is</b> <b>incredible,</b> because no one's heard this number yet. This {{is the first time}} they're hearing it!' It obviously touched them, you know. And that was at the L.A. Forum, so I knew we were onto something with that one.|$|E
25|$|Again, like Salerno, {{there were}} serious {{problems}} with the landings. The commander, Lieutenant General John P. Lucas, did not exploit as aggressively as {{he might have done}} and was relieved for it. Lucas believed that if he had pushed too far, his forces could have been cut off by the Germans. But as the whole purpose of the invasion was to attack the German lines behind Monte Cassino and break out into the Italian areas which were undefended, the idea that Lucas thought he should land then sit and do nothing <b>is</b> <b>incredible.</b> The Germans came even closer than Salerno to breaking up the beachhead. They pushed through the defences to the last line before the sea. Again massive firepower on the Allied side saved the beachhead.|$|E
25|$|The vibrato sound <b>is</b> <b>incredible,</b> {{and it took}} a long time. I {{put down}} the rhythm track on an Epiphone Casino through a Fender Twin Reverb without vibrato. Then we played the track back through four old Twins, one on each side. We had to keep all the amps {{vibrating}} in time to the track and each other, so we had to keep stopping and starting the track, recording it in 10-second bursts... I wish I could remember exactly how we did the slide part – not writing it down is one of the banes of my life! We did it in three passes through a harmonizer, set to some weird interval, like a sixth. There was a different harmonization for each pass. For the line in harmonics, I retuned the guitar so that I could play it all at the 12th fret with natural harmonics. It's doubled several times.|$|E

His chest was so large that he required a custom-made girth, and he was noted for his large, powerful, well-muscled hindquarters.

500|$|Tory Christman, {{a critic}} of Scientology and former Scientologist from 1969 to 2000, stated she disapproved of illegal tactics but felt {{encouraged}} by the new influx of critics of Scientology.

[...] Scientology critic Arnaldo Lerma told the St. Petersburg Times he was impressed by a video of a protest against Scientology which took place in Orlando, Florida: [...] "I've never seen anything like that before.

500|$|Musically, A Thousand Leaves was {{considered}} more expansive and relaxed than previous Sonic Youth albums, with less feedback and more guitar playing and improvisation. According to David Browne, the record explored post-rock sounds that were [...] "subtler" [...] and [...] "quirkier" [...] than most mainstream rock at the time. The {{title of the}} album was inspired by Walt Whitman's Leaves of Grass. According to Moore, [...] "The same way he improvises with images and words, we improvise with sounds and notes". He also attributed {{the style of the}} album {{to the fact that the}} band was getting older, commenting, [...] "You also become much involved with your thoughts about life experience in general. Having children <b>is</b> <b>incredible</b> in that way." [...] The song [...] "Snare, Girl" [...] explored these topics. The longest song on the album, [...] "Hits of Sunshine (For Allen Ginsberg)", referenced American poet Allen Ginsberg and contains an instrumental interlude that was described as [...] "a subtle, drawn-out passage of Morse code guitar lines and lazy afternoon with wah-wah pedal licks—bliss in slow motion." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1970, Divine {{played the}} role of Lady Divine, the {{operator}} of an exhibit known as The Cavalcade of Perversion who turns to murdering visitors in Waters's film Multiple Maniacs. The film contained several controversial scenes, notably one which involved Lady Divine masturbating using a rosary while sitting inside a church. In another, Lady Divine kills her boyfriend and proceeds to eat his heart; in actuality, Divine bit into a cow's heart which had gone rotten from being left out on the set all day. At the end of the film, Lady Divine is raped by a giant lobster named Lobstora, an act that drives her into madness; she subsequently goes on a killing spree in Fell's Point before being shot down by the National Guard. Due to its controversial nature, Waters feared that the film would be banned and confiscated by the Maryland Censor Board, so avoided their jurisdiction by only screening it at non-commercial venues, namely rented church premises. Multiple Maniacs was the first of Waters's films to receive widespread attention, as did Divine; KSFX remarked that [...] "Divine <b>is</b> <b>incredible!</b> Could start a whole new trend in films." ...|$|E
500|$|Brown {{said the}} song was {{given to him by}} DJ Frank E {{while he was in the}} studio writing songs for other artists and himself. [...] "I heard the track and I was like man this <b>is</b> <b>incredible.</b> It kind of gave me the 'Forever' feeling so I wanted to do more of a song for my pop {{audience}}. I’ve been doing a lot of mix-tape stuff, a lot of urban records...the pop audience didn’t really have anything to gauge from so I really wanted to give them this and I feel like 'Yeah 3x' is something different, something new and it’s just [...] positive record. It’s not anything too over the top; it’s just right where it needs to be." [...] During a chat with fans on Ustream.tv on September 27, 2010, Brown said that {{the song was}} written in 15minutes; [...] "We actually got the beat and we did it in no time. It was effortless. It was fun. It was sort of like when we wrote 'Forever', so I hope you guys like that record. It's more of a pop record, in the club record." ...|$|E
500|$|The song {{has been}} {{frequently}} covered and remixed by several notable rappers. Roc Nation's Jay Electronica recorded his own freestyle {{and had a}} music video created for his version. Grammy nominated Young Chris did a freestyle over the original version of the song. Fiend released a freestyle onto his mixtape Life Behind Limo Tint and a filmed a music video. Canadian native Shad performed a freestyle of the song during a concert. Fabolous used the song's instrumental to record [...] "Wolves In Sheeps Clothing" [...] which was featured on mix-tape The S.O.U.L. Tape. He directed a music video to promote the song.

Cole performed a freestyle over the song, which he had stated was a tribute to West, writing “That beat <b>is</b> <b>incredible,</b> shout out to Yeezy. Much Love.” The song, titled [...] "Villematic" [...] was featured on his Friday Night Lights mixtape. AllHipHop praised his version, saying [...] "'Villematic', '2 Face', and 'Higher' are all songs which make up a strong midsection – {{it is easy to}} become lost in this mixtape." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1999, Spears {{began work}} on her second studio album, Oops!... I Did It Again (2000), in Sweden and Switzerland. After meeting with Robert Lange in Switzerland, the singer started to record several songs for the album, {{including}} [...] "Don't Let Me Be the Last to Know". After finishing the track, Spears revealed {{in an interview with}} Billboard that [...] "with the first album, I didn't get to show my voice off. The songs were great, but they weren't very challenging. This song <b>is</b> <b>incredible.</b> It's going to surprise people in the best way." [...] "Don't Let Me Be the Last to Know" [...] was written and produced by Robert Lange, while additional lyrics were written by his then-wife Shania Twain and Keith Scott. Spears recorded her vocals for the song between November and December 1999 at Robert Lange's and Shania Twain's chateau in La-Tour-de Peilz, Switzerland, and it was later mixed by Nigel Green and programmed by Cory Churko, Kevin Churko and Richard Meyer. During a live concert at Hawaii, included on her second home video release Live and More! (2000), Spears said the song is one of her favourites on Oops!... I Did It Again. [...] "Don't Let Me Be the Last to Know" [...] was released on January 17, 2001 as the final single from the album.|$|E
500|$|Blakeman {{said that}} she read the book in a single sitting, before [...] "crying her eyes out". The film {{includes}} the themes of bullying, youth crime, domestic violence, unwanted pregnancy, and teenage angst. For Blakeman, April's [...] "heartbreaking journey in searching for her real mum is also about being brave enough to let love in." [...] Tom Sutcliffe, writing for The Independent, spoke {{of the limits of}} taboo themes in family dramas, and said the film's [...] "account of a life lived in care couldn't have had swearing, or casual drug use, and when a shadow fell over a child's bed at night, it wasn't the care-home manager coming to exercise some horrible , as it might have been in an adult drama". The film also addressed the theme of Asperger syndrome through the character of Poppy. The BBC claimed that Clark, who has the condition herself, was able to offer [...] "a unique take" [...] on the role. Steveson summarised the themes of the film, saying that [...] "At the centre of the story, Marion finds out that she loves this girl. And that is an amazing liberation when you discover someone more important to you than you are. That is what <b>is</b> <b>incredible</b> about becoming a parent – you care about your child more than you care about yourself." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{series is}} {{illustrated}} by Fiona Staples, who was introduced to Vaughan by their mutual friend, writer Steve Niles, with whom Staples worked on Mystery Society. Vaughan, who did not meet Staples in person until just before their panel at the 2011 San Diego Comic-Con, explained his selection of Staples by describing his reaction upon first seeing her work, saying [...] "Her artwork <b>is</b> <b>incredible.</b> [...] doesn't look like anyone else. She is very unique. When I opened up this file I was like, 'This is going to work! Staples is co-owner of Saga and was given first billing {{on the cover of}} issue 31. In addition to designing all the characters, vehicles and alien races in the story, she provides painted covers and hand-letters Hazel's narration using her own handwriting, which is the last thing she does after finishing the artwork on a page. Staples renders the characters in a pen-and-ink style line while using all-color settings inspired by video games and Japanese animation. At the 2012 Image Expo, Staples described the process by which she produces her art as harkening back to animation cels, in which emphasis is placed on figures and backgrounds. Vaughan has stated that Staple's style has influenced the direction of the story. The character Ghüs, for example is entirely Staples' creation. Another example is the organic forms of most of the series' technology, such as the main characters' wooden rocket ship, which is derived from Staples' dislike of drawing mechanical objects. To design the series' various planetary settings, Staples looks to the real world for inspiration and then exaggerates some elements of them. Some rooms on the planet Cleave, for example, were inspired by Cambodian architecture.|$|E

60|$|Mary {{spent the}} evening in writing two letters to her nearest {{relatives}} in France, and in making her will. The principal object of these letters was to recommend her servants {{to the attention}} and care of those to whom they were addressed, after she should be gone. She went to bed shortly after midnight, and it is said she slept. This would <b>be</b> <b>incredible,</b> if any thing <b>were</b> <b>incredible</b> in respect to {{the workings of the}} human soul in a time of awful trial like this, which so transcends all the ordinary conditions of its existence.|$|R
