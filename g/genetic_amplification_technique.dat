40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} mucosal expression of INF-gamma and IL- 10 in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC). Fourteen patients with CD and 11 patients with ulcerative colitis participated and 7 healthy subjects were also included. Study of the mucosal expression of INF-gamma and IL- 10 was conducted using biopsies from healthy and damaged colons, using the inverse transcription and <b>genetic</b> <b>amplification</b> (RT-PCR) <b>technique</b> in real time (Taqman). Our results were expressed as ratio between messenger cytokine (mRNA) levels and ribosomal RNA level of a reference molecule (rRNA 18 S), then multiplied by 108. In the cases of Crohn's disease, the mucosa expressed increased INF-gamma and IL- 10 compared with controls (respective medians: 23. 03 vs. 1. 87 p= 0. 04 and 20. 61 vs. 2. 13 p= 0. 08). A strong positive correlation was found in the mucosal expression of IL- 10 and INF-gamma during CD (r= 0. 9 p< 0. 0001). In contrast, in patients with UC, the expression of INF-gamma and IL- 10 were comparable to those observed in the controls (7. 18 vs. 2. 18 p= 0. 36 and 3. 66 vs. 1. 87 p= 0. 44). During Crohn's disease, the expression of both IL- 10 and INF-gamma was increased and strongly correlated, compared with the controls...|$|R

5000|$|Published {{scientific}} literature generally lacks detailed {{comparison of the}} performance of isothermal <b>amplification</b> <b>techniques</b> such as RPA, HDA, and LAMP relative to each other, often rather comparing a single isothermal technique to a [...] "gold standard" [...] PCR assay. This makes it difficult to judge the merits of these techniques independently from the claims of the manufacturers, inventors, or proponents. Furthermore, performance characteristics of any <b>amplification</b> <b>technique</b> are difficult to decouple from primer design: a [...] "good" [...] primer set for one target for RPA may give faster amplification or more sensitive detection than a [...] "poor" [...] LAMP primer set for the same target, but the converse may be true for different primer sets for a different target. An exception is a recent study comparing RT-qPCR, RT-LAMP, and RPA for detection of Schmallenberg Virus and Bovine Viral Diarrhea Virus, which effectively makes the point that each <b>amplification</b> <b>technique</b> has strengths and weaknesses, which may vary by the target, and that the properties of the available <b>amplification</b> <b>techniques</b> need to be evaluated in combination with the requirements for each application.

40|$|The thesis {{presents}} a {{detailed study of}} different Raman fibre laser (RFL) based <b>amplification</b> <b>techniques</b> and their applications in long-haul/unrepeatered coherent transmission systems. RFL based <b>amplifications</b> <b>techniques</b> were characterised from different aspects, including signal/noise power distributions, relative intensity noise (RIN), mode structures of induced Raman fibre lasers, and so on. It was found {{for the first time}} that RFL based <b>amplification</b> <b>techniques</b> could be divided into three categories in terms of the fibre laser regime, which were Fabry-Perot fibre laser with two FBGs, weak Fabry-Perot fibre laser with one FBG and very low reflection near the input, and random distributed feedback (DFB) fibre laser with one FBG. It was also found that lowering the reflection near the input could mitigate the RIN of the signal significantly, thanks to the reduced efficiency of the Stokes shift from the FW-propagated pump. In order to evaluate the transmission performance, different RFL based amplifiers were evaluated and optimised in long-haul coherent transmission systems. The results showed that Fabry-Perot fibre laser based amplifier with two FBGs gave > 4. 15 dB Q factor penalty using symmetrical bidirectional pumping, as the RIN of the signal was increased significantly. However, random distributed feedback fibre laser based amplifier with one FBG could mitigate the RIN of the signal, which enabled the use of bidirectional second order pumping and consequently give the best transmission performance up to 7915 km. Furthermore, using random DFB fibre laser based amplifier was proved to be effective to combat the nonlinear impairment, and the maximum reach was enhanced by > 28 % in mid-link single/dual band optical phase conjugator (OPC) transmission systems. In addition, unrepeatered transmission over > 350 km fibre length using RFL based <b>amplification</b> <b>technique</b> were presented experimentally using DP-QPSK and DP- 16 QAM transmitter...|$|R
40|$|The {{level of}} HIV- 1 RNA in plasma {{has become one}} of the most {{important}} markers in the follow-up of HIV-infected patients. Three techniques are commercially available: both the Amplicor HIV Monitor and the NASBA HIV- 1 RNA QT are target amplification methods, whereas the Quantiplex HIV RNA assay is a branched DNA signal <b>amplification</b> <b>technique.</b> Detection in both target <b>amplification</b> <b>techniques</b> is based on a single primer pair and a single probe in the gag region, whereas multiple probes capture the pol region of the viral RNA in the branched DNA assay. We investigated the discrepant observation of an undetectable viral load in an immunodeficient pregnant HIV- 1 -infected patient of African origin with no prior antiretroviral treatment. Although clinical progression was present in this patient with tuberculosis and a low CD 4 cell count, viral load determinations with both the Amplicor Monitor and NASBA assays revealed no detectable RNA levels. The presence of HIV- 1 RNA in the plasma of the patient was demonstrated by an in-house RNA-PCR. Subsequent HIV- 1 RNA quantification with the branched DNA method revealed a high viremia (460, 000 copies/ml). DNA sequence analysis of the gag gene identified a subtype G HIV- 1 strain (HIV- 1 BL). To our knowledge this is the first report of a patient harboring an HIV- 1 genotype of the main group with a high viral load as quantified by the branched DNA assay, but undetectable with the two commercial HIV RNA <b>amplification</b> <b>techniques</b> because of <b>genetic</b> divergence.

40|$|Abstract: Nucleic acid <b>amplification</b> <b>techniques</b> are {{commonly}} used currently to diagnose viral diseases and manage patients {{with this kind of}} illnesses. These techniques have had a rapid but unconventional route of development during the last 30 years, with the discovery and introduction of several assays in clinical diagnosis. The {{increase in the number of}} commercially available methods has facilitated the use of this technology in the majority of laboratories worldwide. This technology has reduced the use of some other techniques such as viral culture based methods and serological assays in the clinical virology laboratory. Moreover, nucleic acid <b>amplification</b> <b>techniques</b> are now the methods of reference and also the most useful assays for the diagnosis in several diseases. The introduction of these techniques and their automation provides new opportunities for the clinical laboratory to affect patient care. The main objectives in performing nucleic acid tests in this field are to provide timely results useful for high-quality patient care at a reasonable cost, because rapid results are associated with improvements in patients care. The use of <b>amplification</b> <b>techniques</b> such as polymerase chain reaction, real-time polymerase chain reaction or nucleic acid sequence-based amplification for virus detection, genotyping and quantification have some advantages like high sensitivity and reproducibility, as well as a broad dynamic range. This review is an up-to-date of the main nucleic acid techniques and their clinical applications, and special challenges and opportunities that these techniques currently provide for the clinical virology laboratory...|$|R
40|$|The {{technical}} merits of weak value <b>amplification</b> <b>techniques</b> are analyzed. We consider models of several {{different types of}} technical noise in an optical context and show that weak value <b>amplification</b> <b>techniques</b> (which only use {{a small fraction of}} the photons) compare favorably with standard techniques (which uses all of them). Using the Fisher information metric, we demonstrate that weak value techniques can put all of the Fisher information about the detected parameter into a small portion of the events and show how this fact alone gives technical advantages. We go on to consider a time correlated noise model, and find that a Fisher information analysis indicates that while the standard method can have much larger information about the detected parameter than the postselected technique. However, the estimator needed to gather the information is technically difficult to implement, showing that the inefficient (but practical) signal-to-noise estimation of the parameter is usually superior. We also describe other technical advantages unique to imaginary weak value <b>amplification</b> <b>techniques,</b> focusing on beam deflection measurements. In this case, we discuss combined noise types (such as detector transverse jitter, angular beam jitter before the interferometer and turbulence) for which the interferometric weak value technique gives higher Fisher information over conventional methods. We go on to calculate the Fisher information of the recently proposed photon recycling scheme for beam deflection measurements, and show it further boosts the Fisher information by the inverse postselection probability relative to the standard measurement case...|$|R
