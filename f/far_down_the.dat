5|$|Before the Reformation, the {{extensive}} prohibited degrees of kinship, {{up to the}} fourth degree through consanguinity, meant that most noble marriages necessitated a papal dispensation. This could later be used as grounds for annulment if the marriage proved politically or personally inconvenient, {{although there was no}} divorce as such. After the mid-sixteenth century the prohibited degrees were reduced to those in Leviticus 13: 4–13, which limited them to relationships in the second degree of kinship. Separation from bed and board continued to be allowed in exceptional circumstances, usually adultery, and under the Reformed Kirk divorce was allowed on grounds of adultery or desertion. Scotland {{was one of the first}} countries to allow desertion as legal grounds for divorce and, unlike England, where divorce necessitated and act of parliament, divorce cases were initiated relatively <b>far</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> social scale.|$|E
5|$|Marriages, {{particularly}} {{higher in}} society, were often political {{in nature and}} the subject of complex negotiations over the tocher (dowry). Some mothers took a leading role in negotiating marriages, as Lady Glenorchy did for her children in the 1560s and 1570s, or as matchmakers, finding suitable and compatible partners for others.

5|$|Roman Academic Cotta ridicules both {{literal and}} allegorical {{acceptance}} of myth, declaring roundly that myths {{have no place}} in philosophy. Cicero is also generally disdainful of myth, but, like Varro, he is emphatic in his support for the state religion and its institutions. It is difficult to know how <b>far</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> social scale this rationalism extended. Cicero asserts that no one (not even old women and boys) is so foolish as to believe in the terrors of Hades or the existence of Scyllas, centaurs or other composite creatures, but, on the other hand, the orator elsewhere complains of the superstitious and credulous character of the people. De Natura Deorum is the most comprehensive summary of Cicero's line of thought.|$|E

Ravaged by new infectious diseases introduced to the Americas by European contact and by the slaving raids, the surviving Calusa retreated south and east.|$|E
25|$|The {{game was}} opened, as now, by a kick-off. The player of 1880 might, if he chose, drive the ball <b>far</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> field. Or, {{technically}} kicking the ball by merely touching {{it with his}} toe, he might {{pick it up and}} run with it. Players when tackled invariably endeavored to pass the ball back to another member of their side for a further advance, a method of play so highly developed that it was not infrequent to see a ball passed as many as five times during a single play.|$|E
25|$|Specific trap {{sites for}} heavy mineral sand placer {{deposits}} are in beaches on the leeward side of headlands, as this forms a low-energy zone which traps sediments carried {{along by the}} longshore drift. Also, sand bars developed at the mouths of rivers which feed the placer deposits are rich trap sites where the winnowing action of the waves are most efficient, because heavy minerals, {{if they are going}} to be too heavy to be moved, will deposit at an isthmus in preference to drifting too <b>far</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> beach.|$|E

25|$|Mayon Volcano is the Philippines' {{most active}} volcano. It has steep upper slopes that average 35–40° and is capped {{by a small}} summit crater. The {{historical}} eruptions of this basaltic-andesitic volcano dates back to 1616 and ranges from Strombolian to basaltic Plinian eruptions. Eruptions occur predominately from the central conduit and have also produced lava flows that travel <b>far</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> flanks. Pyroclastic flows and mudflows have commonly swept down many of the roughly 40 ravines that radiate from the summit and have often devastated populated lowland areas.|$|E

25|$|Herodotus {{wrote an}} account about 430 BC of Carthaginian {{trade on the}} Atlantic coast of Morocco. The Punic {{explorer}} and suffete of Carthage called Hanno the Navigator led an expedition to recolonise the Atlantic coast of Morocco that may have ventured as <b>far</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> coast of Africa as Senegal and perhaps even beyond. The Greek version of the Periplus of Hanno describes his voyage. Although {{it is not known}} just how far his fleet sailed on the African coastline, this short report, dating probably from the 5th or 6th century BC, identifies distinguishing geographic features such as a coastal volcano and an encounter with hairy hominids.|$|E

25|$|In October 1795 George Bass and Matthew Flinders, {{accompanied}} by William Martin sailed the boat Tom Thumb out of Port Jackson to Botany Bay and explored the Georges River further upstream {{than had been}} done previously by the colonists. Their reports on their return led to the settlement of Banks' Town. In March 1796 the same party embarked on a second voyage in a similar small boat, which they also called the Tom Thumb. During this trip they travelled as <b>far</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> coast as Lake Illawarra, which they called Tom Thumb Lagoon. They discovered and explored Port Hacking. In 1798–99, Bass and Flinders set out in a sloop and circumnavigated Tasmania, thus proving {{it to be an}} island.|$|E
25|$|In early August, Woods won the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational at Firestone for {{the eighth}} time.

Woods finished <b>far</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> leaderboard at the PGA Championship at Oak Hill where Jason Dufner won his first major. Despite hurting his back during The Barclays, Woods finished in second place, one shot behind Adam Scott. Woods did not seriously contend in the remaining FedEx Cup playoff events.

25|$|Though never {{seriously in}} contention, Woods {{finished}} tied for fourth at the Masters Tournament, won by Adam Scott in a sudden-death playoff over Ángel Cabrera.

Woods finished <b>far</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> leaderboard at the U.S. Open at Merion in June won by Justin Rose.
