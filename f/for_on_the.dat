5|$|Robinson's first {{position}} in broadcasting was at Piccadilly Radio in Manchester, {{which he took}} up while recovering from his injuries. He joined the BBC in 1986 as a production trainee, and later worked extensively as a television and radio producer {{for a variety of}} shows including Newsround and Crimewatch. He then became an assistant producer <b>for</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> Record, and in 1993 was promoted to deputy editor of Panorama, a position he held for three years. In 1995, whilst Robinson was at Panorama, he wrote an internal BBC memorandum questioning how an interview with Prime Minister John Major could be defended {{in the run-up to the}} Scottish local elections. When leaked, this gained attention from the Labour Party, which perceived it as the legitimised denial of equal time in the run-up to local elections.|$|E
5|$|The Belgian Air Force ordered five Sea King Mk.48s {{to perform}} Search and Rescue {{missions}} in 1974, which entered service in 1976. They were upgraded with new rotor blades in 1987–1988, and with revised avionics, including new radar and provision of a FLIR turret under the nose from 1995. In 2007 Belgium ordered eight NH90 helicopters in 2007, of which four were navalised NFH helicopters intended {{to replace the}} Sea Kings in the SAR role. Delays in delivery of Belgium's NH90s, together with an increased demand <b>for</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> NH90s to operate from the Belgian Navy's frigates, {{has resulted in the}} retirement date for the Sea Kings being pushed back to at least 2018. Three Sea Kings remain operational as of 2017. Belgian Sea Kings had been carried out over 3300 SAR sorties by the end of 2016, with over 1750 lives saved.|$|E
5|$|The Crédit Mobilier of America scandal {{involved}} {{corruption in}} the financing of the Union Pacific Railroad, part of the transcontinental railroad that was completed in 1869. Union Pacific officers and directors secretly purchased control of the Crédit Mobilier of America company, then contracted with the firm to have it undertake {{the construction of the}} railroad. The grossly inflated invoices submitted by the company were paid by the railroad, using federal funds appropriated to subsidize the project, and the company was allowed to purchase Union Pacific securities at par value, well below the market rate. Crédit Mobilier showed large profits and stock gains, and distributed substantial dividends. The high expenses meant that Congress was called upon to appropriate more funds. One of the railroad officials who controlled Crédit Mobilier was also a congressman, Oakes Ames of Massachusetts. He offered some of his colleagues the opportunity to buy Crédit Mobilier stock at par value, well below what it sold <b>for</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> market, and the railroad got its additional appropriations.|$|E
40|$|Analysis of the {{fingerprints}} of 571 {{members of the}} Habbanite isolate suggest inherited patterns and pattern sequences. A genetic theory has been developed; it assumes that the basic fingerprint pattern sequence is all ulnar loops and {{that a variety of}} genes cause deviations from this pattern sequence. Genes that have been proposed include: (1) a semidominant gene <b>for</b> whorls <b>on</b> <b>the</b> thumbs (one homozygote has whorls <b>on</b> both thumbs, <b>the</b> other has ulnar loops on both thumbs and the heterozygote usually has two ulnar loops or one ulnar loop and one whorl); (2) a semidominant gene <b>for</b> whorls <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ring fingers which acts like <b>the</b> gene <b>for</b> whorls <b>on</b> <b>the</b> thumbs; (3) a dominant gene <b>for</b> arches <b>on</b> <b>the</b> thumbs and often on other fingers; (4) one or more dominant genes <b>for</b> arches <b>on</b> <b>the</b> fingers; (5) a dominant gene <b>for</b> whorls <b>on</b> all fingers except for an ulnar loop <b>on</b> <b>the</b> middle finger; (6) a dominant gene <b>for</b> radial loops <b>on</b> <b>the</b> index fingers, frequently associated with an arch <b>on</b> <b>the</b> middle fingers; and (7) a recessive gene <b>for</b> radial loops <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ring and little fingers.

5|$|The Girls He Left Behind Him and The Iron Clad Lover are two 1910 American silent short comedies {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. Both films were originally released together on a single reel and are two distinct and separate subjects. The Girls He Left Behind Him focuses on a young man, Jack Redfern, who receives a letter from an old sweetheart of his. This prompts him to reminiscence about all the girls he has had affections <b>for</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> eve of his wedding. All the old sweethearts of his life then appear at his wedding to wish him well. The Iron Clad Lover concerns two suitors who are vying for the affections of Bessie. Tom, who plays a game of chess with her father, ends up quarreling {{with him and he}} is thrown out of the house. The next day, Tom attempts to bring flowers and candy for Bessie's birthday, but is dismissed by the angry father. Tom decides to dress up in a suit of armor and ends up breaking a vase when trying to announce himself. The suit of armor is thrown out and Bessie and the other suitor chase down the junk dealer to free Tom from the suit of armor. Both films were released on December 9, 1910 and were met with positive reviews by The Moving Picture World and The New York Dramatic Mirror. Both films are presumed lost.|$|E

The soundtrack was published by Antinos Records in Japan in 1996. Jumping Flash! 2 was re-released as a downloadable game for the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Portable via the PlayStation Network in 2009, with the same controls and interface as the 1996 release.|$|E
5|$|Æthelwig's {{relationship}} with Wulfstan, when Wulfstan was {{acting as the}} abbot's diocesan bishop, {{appears to have been}} tense, <b>for</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> only recorded visitation by Wulfstan to Evesham during Æthelwig's abbacy, Æthelwig was not there. Although in legal matters Wulfstan and Æthelwig were in conflict, personally, Æthelwig is said to have regarded Wulfstan as a father figure, and as the abbot's confessor. The fact that the Evesham's house chronicle appears to have been reworked after 1100 to gloss over embarrassing incidents of the abbots submitting to the bishops of Worcester makes evaluation of Æthelwig's relations with his episcopal superiors more difficult.|$|E

Ericsson needed a small, low-profile engine like the trunk engine to power the U.S. Federal government's monitors, a type of warship developed during the American Civil War that had very little space for a conventional powerplant. The trunk engine itself was however unsuitable for this purpose because the preponderance of weight was {{on the side of}} the engine containing the cylinder and trunk, a problem which could not be compensated <b>for</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> small monitor warships.|$|E
