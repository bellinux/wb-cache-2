To objectively evaluate the long-term efficacy of the AGF, the authors performed a study of children who had undergone AGF between June 1988 and June 1990 (n = 46). Six of them died of unrelated causes. Twenty-two consented to follow-up evaluation that included parental interview, physical examination, upper gastrointestinal series (UGI), 24 -hour <b>esophageal</b> <b>pH</b> probe <b>monitoring</b> (EpH), and a liquid-phase gastric emptying study. Twenty patients (74 %) remained asymptomatic, patients exhibited gastroesophageal reflux (GER) by UGI, and three others by EpH. Three children were noted to have delayed gastric emptying.

40|$|Summary: To {{identify}} behaviors {{associated with}} the onset of gastroesophageal reflux episodes in infants both systematically and prospectively, each of 10 patients (aged 2 to 32 weeks) was studied during 2 hours of intraluminal <b>esophageal</b> <b>pH</b> probe <b>monitoring,</b> using a split-screen audiovisual recording technique. Videotape analysis of eight infants who had scoreable reflux events revealed six discrete behaviors closely associated temporally (P<. 001 to <. 05) {{with the onset of}} reflux events: "discomfort " (crying or frowning), "emission " (of liquid or gas, i. e., regurgitation, drooling, or burping), yawning, stridor, stretching, and mouthing. Three behaviors (hiccuping, sneezing, and thumb-sucking) were infrequent but were significantly associated with onset of reflux events in one or two patients each. A tenth behavior, coughing or gagging, was significantly associated with onset of reflux events in two patients, but not in the rest, despite relatively frequent occurrence. Exploration of temporal relations between reflux and each behavior suggested that discomfort, emission, mouthing, and cough-gag may have caused reflux episodes, and that all 10 of the behaviors may have been caused by reflux episodes.

Here we review our experience with the selective preoperative workup of patients undergoing fundoplication to treat gastroesoph-ageal reflux disease. STUDY DESIGN: A series of 628 consecutive antireflux procedures was reviewed. History and physical examina-tion, upper endoscopy, and upper gastrointestinal videofluoroscopy were obtained preopera-tively on all patients; the first 30 patients also underwent <b>esophageal</b> manometry and <b>pH</b> <b>monitoring</b> (routine evaluation group). Thereafter, <b>pH</b> <b>monitoring</b> only was performed for atypical reflux symptoms, and manometry only was performed for a history of dysphagia, odynophagia, or for abnormal motility on videofluoroscopy (selective evaluation group). All patients underwent a laparoscopic floppy Nissen fundoplication, and then endoscopy and fluoroscopy at 3 months and 12 months postoperatively. RESULTS: Eighty-five of the patients in the selective evaluation group (14 %) required manometry, and 88 (15 %) underwent <b>pH</b> <b>monitoring.</b> Eighteen of the 115 patients who underwent manometry (16 %) had evidence of dysmotility. None of these 18 patients had increased dysphagia postop-eratively; 8 of 18 reported improvement with swallowing.

5000|$|The {{importance}} of refluxed gastric contents in {{the pathogenesis of}} GERD was emphasized by Winkelstein who introduced the term [...] "peptic esophagitis" [...] and by Bernstein and Baker who reported the symptom of heartburn following instillation of hydrochloric acid in the distal esophagus. Formal measurement of acid in the esophagus was first described in 1960 by Tuttle. He used a glass pH probe to map the gastroesophageal pH gradient, and demonstrated a sharp gradient in normal subjects and a gradual sloping gradient in patients with esophagitis. Four years later, Miller used an indwelling esophageal pH electrode to continuously measure esophageal and gastric pH for a period up to 12 hours. This technique required that the patient keep their hands immersed in saline {{to serve as a}} reference. Prolonged monitoring became feasible in 1974 when Johnson and DeMeester developed a dependable external reference electrode. Using this technique to monitor esophageal acid exposure patients for periods up to 24 hours, DeMeester and Johnson were able to identify the most important parameters of esophageal acid exposure and they developed a composite pH score to quantify gastroesophageal reflux.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Both {{long-term}} proton pump inhibitor (PPI) use {{and surgical}} fundoplication have potential drawbacks as treatments for chronic gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). This multi-center, prospective study evaluated the clinical experiences of 69 {{patients who received}} an alternative treatment: endoscopic anterior fundoplication with a video- and ultrasound-guided transoral surgical stapler. METHODS: Patients with well-categorized GERD were enrolled at six international sites. Efficacy data was compared at baseline and at 6 months post-procedure. The primary endpoint was a ≥ 50 % improvement in GERD health-related quality of life (HRQL) score. Secondary endpoints were elimination or ≥ 50 % reduction in dose of PPI medication and reduction of total acid exposure on <b>esophageal</b> <b>pH</b> probe <b>monitoring.</b> A safety evaluation was performed at time 0 and weeks 1, 4, 12, and 6 months. RESULTS: 66 patients completed follow-up. Six months after the procedure, the GERD-HRQL score improved by > 50 % off PPI in 73 % (48 / 66) of patients (95 % CI 60 - 83 %). Forty-two patients (64. 6 %) were no longer using daily PPI medication. Of the 23 patients who continued to take PPI following the procedure, 13 (56. 5 %) reported a ≥ 50 % reduction in dose. The mean percent of total time with <b>esophageal</b> <b>pH</b> < 4. 0 decreased from baseline to 6 months (P < 0. 001). Common adverse events were peri-operative chest discomfort and sore throat.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Physical {{straining}} such as deep inspiration or coughing {{may induce}} gastroesophageal reflux (GER) by overcoming feeble lower esophageal sphincter (LES) pressure. The role of straining as a provocant of GER {{has not been}} analyzed systematically in children. It was our aim to examine the contribution of straining to the occurrence of GER with particular attention to its relationship to transient LES relaxations, which are a major mechanism of the occurrence of GER in pediatric patients. METHODS: Concurrent <b>esophageal</b> manometry and <b>pH</b> <b>monitoring</b> was performed for 4 h postprandially in six children with esophagitis (age 9 months to 12 yr). Analysis was performed on isolated single strain episodes, defined as an increased intragastric pressure > 10 mm Hg. When a drop of <b>esophageal</b> <b>pH</b> < 4. 0 was noted within 15 sec after any part of a strain, this strain was defined as related to the reflux episode. RESULTS: The median value of basal LES pressure was 10 mm Hg (range 1 - 18). In all, 134 analyzable strains and 87 analyzable reflux episodes were recorded. Isolated strains were associated with 20 reflux episodes (23 %). Reflux was observed more frequently with strains that occurred during transient LES relaxations (12 / 40) than straining when the LES was contracted (8 / 94) (p < 0. 01). Sustained strain (35 %) and inspiratory strain (25 %) were the major patterns of straining related to reflux. CONCLUSION: Straining provoked reflux infrequently and simultaneous occurrence of straining and transient LES relaxation was important in determining the occurrence of strain-related reflux in pediatric patients with reflux esophagitis...|$|R
