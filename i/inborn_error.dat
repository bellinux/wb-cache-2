25|$|A {{congenital}} {{metabolic disease}} is {{also referred to as}} an <b>inborn</b> <b>error</b> of metabolism. Most of these are single gene defects, usually heritable. Many affect the structure of body parts but some simply affect the function.|$|E
25|$|Metabolic {{disorders}} {{in either the}} mother or the child can cause neurodevelopmental disorders. Two examples are diabetes mellitus (a multifactorial disorder) and phenylketonuria (an <b>inborn</b> <b>error</b> of metabolism). Many such inherited diseases may directly affect the child's metabolism and neural development but less commonly they can indirectly affect the child during gestation. (See also teratology).|$|E

40|$|AIM: The aim of {{the study}} was to {{investigate}} the frequency and type of cardiac manifestations in a defined group of patients with <b>inborn</b> <b>errors</b> of metabolism. This paper also explores the key role of cardiac manifestations in the diagnosis of <b>inborn</b> <b>errors</b> of metabolism in daily practice. METHODS: Out of the 287 patients with the potential for <b>inborn</b> <b>errors</b> of metabolism who had been referred to the University Hospital of Heraklion (202 children and adolescents and 85 adults), 41 were found to have a variety of cardiac manifestations, including cardiomyopathy, cardiomegaly, atrioventricular conduction disorders and coronary artery disease. RESULTS: In 15 out of the 41 patients a diagnosis of <b>inborn</b> <b>errors</b> of metabolism was established, while the total number of patients with <b>inborn</b> <b>errors</b> of metabolism was 60 out of the 287. In 6 out of the 15 patients the major symptoms were from the cardiovascular system and 7 of them were adults with symptoms initiating in childhood. CONCLUSION: The cardiac findings consist of a neglected area in the diagnosis of the <b>inborn</b> <b>errors</b> of metabolism. Neurologists, pediatricians and internists should cooperate with cardiologists in managing people with unexplained cardiac symptoms and signs and be aware that several <b>inborn</b> <b>errors</b> of metabolism are associated with cardiac abnormalities and mild neurologic findings...|$|R
40|$|Most {{children}} with <b>inborn</b> <b>errors</b> of metabolism are born healthy without malformations as the fetus {{is protected by}} the metabolic activity of the placenta. However, certain <b>inborn</b> <b>errors</b> of the fetus have teratogenic effects although the mechanisms responsible for the malformations are not generally understood. <b>Inborn</b> <b>errors</b> in the mother may also be teratogenic.

25|$|Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an <b>inborn</b> <b>error</b> of {{metabolism}} {{that results}} in decreased metabolism of the amino acid phenylalanine. Untreated PKU can lead to intellectual disability, seizures, behavioral problems, and mental disorders. It may also result in a musty smell and lighter skin. Babies born to mothers who have poorly treated PKU may have heart problems, a small head, and low birth weight.|$|E
25|$|The pathway is {{initiated}} by the synthesis of D-aminolevulinic acid (dALA or δALA) from the amino acid glycine and succinyl-CoA from the citric acid cycle (Krebs cycle). The rate-limiting enzyme responsible for this reaction, ALA synthase, is negatively regulated by glucose and heme concentration. Mechanism of inhibition of ALAs by heme or hemin is by decreasing stability of mRNA synthesis and by decreasing the intake of mRNA in the mitochondria. This mechanism is of therapeutic importance: infusion of heme arginate or hematin and glucose can abort attacks of acute intermittent porphyria in patients with an <b>inborn</b> <b>error</b> of metabolism of this process, by reducing transcription of ALA synthase.|$|E
25|$|Glucose-6-phosphate {{dehydrogenase}} deficiency (G6PD deficiency), a form {{of which}} is known as favism (after the fava bean), is an X-linked recessive <b>inborn</b> <b>error</b> of metabolism that predisposes to hemolysis (spontaneous destruction of red blood cells) and resultant jaundice {{in response to a}} number of triggers, such as certain foods, illness, or medication. It is particularly common in people of Mediterranean and African origin. The condition is characterized by abnormally low levels of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, an enzyme involved in the pentose phosphate pathway that is especially important in the red blood cell. G6PD deficiency is the most common human enzyme condition. There is no specific treatment, other than avoiding known triggers. In the United States, no genetic screening of prospective parents is recommended, as the symptoms only show in part of the carriers and when that is the case, they can be prevented or controlled, and as a result the condition generally has no impact on the lifespan of those affected. However, globally G6PD deficiency has resulted in 4,100 deaths in 2013 and 3,400 deaths in 1990.|$|E

2500|$|Systemic primary {{carnitine}} deficiency (SPCD), {{also known}} as carnitine uptake defect, carnitine transporter deficiency (CTD) or systemic carnitine deficiency is an <b>inborn</b> <b>error</b> of fatty acid transport caused by a defect in the transporter responsible for moving carnitine across the plasma membrane. Carnitine is an important amino acid for fatty acid metabolism. When carnitine cannot be transported into tissues, fatty acid oxidation is impaired, leading {{to a variety of}} symptoms such as chronic muscle weakness, cardiomyopathy, hypoglycemia and liver dysfunction. [...] The specific transporter involved with SPCD is OCTN2, coded for by the SLC22A5 gene located on chromosome 5. [...] SPCD is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, with mutated alleles coming from both parents.|$|E

There may be dramatic symptoms accumulating in succession, which demand rigorous and experienced evaluation. The seizure may be very dramatic, with symptoms accumulating in succession, convulsions may occur and a child who becomes unresponsive and flaccid demands rigorous and experienced evaluation. The most prominent acute disorders in the differential diagnosis include encephalitis or an encephalopathic state from causes such as infections, metabolic derangement (either <b>inborn</b> <b>error</b> or others such as hypoglycaemia), raised intracranial pressure and so forth. A history of a previous similar seizure is reassuring and may prevent further procedures.|$|E
