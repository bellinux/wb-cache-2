40|$|We {{investigate}} improving automatic {{speech recognition}} (ASR) in noisy conditions by enhancing noisy audio features using visual speech captured from the speaker's face. The enhancement is achieved by applying a linear filter to the concatenated vector of noisy audio and visual features, obtained by mean square error estimation of the clean audio features in a training stage. The performance of the enhanced audio features is evaluated on two ASR tasks: A connected digits task and speaker-independent, largevocabulary, continuous speech recognition. In both cases and at sufficiently low signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), ASR trained on the enhanced audio features significantly outperforms ASR trained on the noisy audio, achieving for example a 46 % relative reduction in word error rate on the digits task at- 3. 5 dB SNR. However, the method fails to capture the <b>full</b> visual <b>modality</b> benefit to ASR, as demonstrated by its comparison to discriminant audio-visual feature fusion introduced in previous work...|$|R

Convivo introduces an original approach to maintain voice communication interaction in presence of poor network performance: an Interface-Adaptation mechanism that suggests adjusting the application user interface to conform {{to one of three}} voice communication <b>modalities</b> (<b>full</b> duplex, half duplex, and voice messaging). The thesis proposes that changes in communication modality are an option to sustain voice communication interaction despite poor network performance. The goals of the changes in communication modality are to reduce the impact of high latency and low bandwidth on voice communication interaction, to facilitate turn taking for a high latency connection, and to sustain voice communication for extremely low bandwidth or high error links.

40|$|AbstractWe {{present a}} case of a {{relatively}} common benign tumor that was a diagnostic dilemma because of its atypical appearance in multiple imaging modalities. Our patient was a 22 -year-old man who presented with complaint of three months of shin pain with running. The radiographically demonstrated sclerotic lesion in his right tibia initially was thought most likely to be a stress fracture, but on further evaluation, it had features that suggested a subacute osteomyelitis or Brodie’s abscess with focal sequestra. It was in fact, biopsy proven to be an osteoid osteoma with multiple, closely adjacent nidi. Its elongate, multicentric, “string of beads” arrangement as well as its intramedullary location is uncommon and it was larger than normally expected. Because of the unusual presentation and appearance of this lesion it caused a diagnostic dilemma. This lesion was evaluated with a <b>full</b> spectrum of <b>modalities</b> including radiographs, CT, MRI, Technetium 99 m-MDP bone scan and Indium- 111 white blood cell scan. After biopsy achieved a definite diagnosis, this tumor was successfully treated with radiofrequency ablation of all nidi in one session...|$|R
40|$|Current {{cognitive}} {{models of}} {{spoken word recognition}} and comprehension are underspecified with respect to when and how multimodal information interacts. We compare two computational models both of which permit the integration of concurrent information within linguistic and non-linguistic processing streams, however their architectures differ critically in {{the level at which}} multimodal information interacts. We compare the predictions of the Multimodal Integration Model (MIM) of language processing (Smith, Monaghan & Huettig, 2014), which implements <b>full</b> interactivity between <b>modalities,</b> to a model in which interaction between modalities is restricted to lexical representations which we represent by an extended multimodal version of the TRACE model of spoken word recognition (McClelland & Elman, 1986). Our results demonstrate that previous visual world data sets involving phonological onset similarity are compatible with both models, whereas our novel experimental data on rhyme similarity is able to distinguish between competing architectures. The fully interactive MIM system correctly predicts a greater influence of visual and semantic information relative to phonological rhyme information on gaze behaviour, while by contrast a system that restricts multimodal interaction to the lexical level overestimates the influence of phonological rhyme, thereby providing an upper limit for when information interacts in multimodal task...|$|R

The study found that Interface-Adaptation helped users to maintain voice communication interaction when network performance degrades. Transitions from full duplex to voice messaging were found particularly valuable. Initial results suggest that as users get more experience with the application they would like to manually control transitions based on feedback provided by the application and their own perceived voice quality. by Marco Antonio Escobedo Gonzalez Maiz.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Based on {{the results}} of a {{recently}} accomplished multicenter clinical trial for the incremental value of a dual-tracer (18 F-FDG and 18 F-FLT), dual-modality (PET and CT) imaging in the differential diagnosis of pulmonary lesions, we investigate some issues that might affect the image interpretation and result reporting. METHODS: The images were read in two separate sessions. Firstly the images were read and reported by physician(s) of the imaging center on completion of each PET/CT scanning. By the end of MCCT, all images collected during the trial were re-read by a collective of readers in an isolated, blinded, and independent way. RESULTS: One hundred sixty two patients successfully passed the data verification and entered into the final analysis. The primary reporting result showed adding 18 F-FDG image information did not change the clinical performance much in sensitivity, specifity and accuracy, but the ratio between SUVFLT and SUVFDG did help the differentiation efficacy among the three subgroups of patients. The collective reviewing result showed the diagnostic achievement varied with reading strategies. ANOVA indicated significant differences among (18) F-FDG, (18) F-FLT in SUV (F =  14. 239, p =  0. 004). CT had almost the same diagnostic performance as 18 F-FLT. When the 18 F-FDG, 18 F-FLT and CT images read in pair, both diagnostic sensitivity and specificity improved. The best diagnostic figures were obtained in full-modality strategy, when dual-tracer PET worked in combination with CT. CONCLUSIONS: With certain experience and training both radiologists and nuclear physicians are qualified to read and to achieve the similar diagnostic accuracy in PET/CT study. Making <b>full</b> use of <b>modality</b> combination and selecting right criteria seems more practical than professional back ground and personal experience in the new hybrid imaging technology, at least when novel tracer or application is concerned...|$|R
40|$|Multimodal brain imaging {{data have}} shown {{increasing}} utility in answering both scientifically interesting and clinically relevant questions. Each brain imaging technique {{provides a different}} view of brain function or structure, while multimodal fusion capitalizes on the strength of each and may uncover hidden relationships that can merge findings from separate neuroimaging studies. However, most current approaches have focused on pair-wise fusion and there is still relatively little work on N-way data fusion and examination of the relationships among multiple data types. We recently developed an approach called mCCA+jICA" as a novel multi-way fusion method which is able to investigate the disease risk factors that are either shared or distinct across multiple modalities as well as the <b>full</b> correspondence across <b>modalities.</b> In this paper, we applied this model to combine resting state fMRI (amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation, ALFF), grey matter density (GM) and DTI (fractional anisotropy, FA) data, in order to elucidate the abnormalities underlying schizophrenia patients (SZs, n= 35) relative to healthy controls (HCs, n= 28). Both modality-common and modality-unique abnormal regions were identified in SZs, which were then used for successful classification for 7 modality-combinations, showing the potential for a broad applicability of the mCCA+jICA model and its results. In addition, a pair of GM-DTI components showed significant correlation with the positive symptom subscale of Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), suggesting that gray matter density changes in default model network along with white matter disruption in anterior thalamic radiation are associated with increased positive PANSS. Findings suggest the DTI anisotropy changes in frontal lobe may relate to the corresponding functional/structural changes in prefrontal cortex and superior temporal gyrus that are thought {{to play a role in}} the clinical expression of schizophrenia...|$|R
