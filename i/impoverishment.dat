5|$|The British {{educational}} policies segregating {{the different}} races — providing minimal public education for Malays, and leaving non-Malays {{to their own}} devices — did not help matters. The Malays, predominantly rural-dwellers, were not encouraged to socialise with the more urban non-Malays. The economic <b>impoverishment</b> of the Malays which set them apart from the better-off Chinese also fanned racial sentiments.|$|E
5|$|By the 1820s, animal {{resources}} were in {{decline in the}} area leading to increased competition among the tribes for game and for furs to sell. Collusion among the fur trading companies led to a dramatic drop in fur prices during the late 1820s causing <b>impoverishment</b> for many Sioux hunters. The U.S. government strongly encouraged the tribes to turn from hunting to farming, trading the woodlands for the plains.|$|E
5|$|Concurrently, Bangui {{also became}} the key centre {{for social and}} {{cultural}} activity in the region, when new institutions were established in the city. However, political turmoil in the country, rampant corruption, and the dictatorial rule of President Bokassa centred in the city, brought in economic recession in the 1970s exacerbated by a fall in international prices for its major exports. This caused <b>impoverishment</b> {{of the people and}} severe conflict, further compounded by refugees migrating from troubled neighbouring countries.|$|E
5|$|The local Biodiversity Action Plan {{recommends}} {{land management}} measures {{to control the}} spread of ragwort and bracken and identifies four non-native, invasive species as threatening native biodiversity: Japanese knotweed, rhododendron, New Zealand flatworm and mink. It also identifies problems of over-grazing resulting in the <b>impoverishment</b> of moorland and upland habitats {{and a loss of}} native woodland, caused by the large numbers of red deer and sheep.|$|E
5|$|The longest-serving non-royal head {{of state}} in the 20th and 21st centuries, Castro {{polarized}} world opinion. His supporters view him {{as a champion of}} socialism and anti-imperialism whose revolutionary regime advanced economic and social justice while securing Cuba's independence from American imperialism. Critics view him as a dictator whose administration oversaw human-rights abuses, the exodus {{of a large number of}} Cubans and the <b>impoverishment</b> of the country's economy. Castro was decorated with various international awards and significantly influenced various individuals and groups across the world.|$|E
5|$|The conquering Spanish {{carried out}} several {{operations}} to relocate the Manche to Alta Verapaz, with their relocation being completed in 1697, {{a short time}} after the Spanish finally defeated their Itza Maya neighbours to the northwest. Most of the surviving Manche Ch'ol were forcibly resettled in the Guatemalan Highlands, in the villages of El Chol and Belén, in the Urran Valley near Rabinal. The resettled Manche Ch'ol suffered from the abrupt change of climate from tropical lowland rain forest to the cold highlands. They were often not provided with suitable clothing by their Spanish overlords, and many died. The depopulation of the Manche and Lakandon Ch'ol lands, and the resulting collapse of long-standing trade routes, resulted in the gradual <b>impoverishment</b> of colonial Verapaz.|$|E
5|$|The Przeworsk culture {{populations were}} {{for the most part}} also moving (to a lesser extent) south and east, which by the 4th century caused a {{lessening}} of the population density in northern and central Poland with a simultaneous settlement concentration increases in Lesser Poland and Silesia. The Przeworsk people there {{at this point in time}} are often identified with the Vandals Germanic tribe. The 4th and 5th century Przeworsk societies had to cope with a deterioration of their traditional tribal social structure, caused by the accumulation of wealth and influence in the hands of the rich, the warriors, the tribal elders and rulers, who controlled the trade, imposed contributions and plundered. During these two centuries the number of the Przeworsk culture settlements and cemeteries generally decreases. There are also clear signs of the environment being overly exploited, which provided another motivation for the population to gradually leave. Most burials were getting more poorly equipped, in comparison with the previous periods. Late Przeworsk culture ceramic materials from Greater Poland show <b>impoverishment</b> and lack of differentiation of form, but on the other hand metal 5th century clasps, found at a variety of locations from eastern Lesser Poland, through eastern Greater Poland to Kujawy, demonstrate the usual for mature Germanic societies highest quality of workmanship.|$|E
5|$|The {{residents}} of urban areasin particular Antananarivohave been {{hardest hit by}} economic downturns and economic policy shifts. The national economic crisis in the mid-1970s and early 1980s, and the World Bank's imposition of a structural adjustment program lowered living standards for the average resident of the city. The end of state subsidies, rapid inflation, higher taxes, widespread <b>impoverishment</b> {{and the decline of}} the middle class were especially evident in Antananarivo, as was the growing wealth of a tiny political and economic elite in the city. In 2007, two thirds of Antananarivo residents had access to electricity, while ten percent of households owned a scooter, car or other motor vehicle. Running water was installed in fewer than 25 percent of homes, small restaurants and businesses in 2007, necessitating the collection of water from household wells or neighborhood pumps and the use of outdoor pit toilets detached from the main building. In 2007, 60 percent of households were using shared public latrines. Most homes use charcoal for daily cooking; stocks of charcoal and rice are kept in the kitchen. The average city household spends just under half of its budget on food. Owing to its increasingly high cost, consumption of meat by city residents has sharply declined since the 1970s; the urban poor eat meat on holidays only once or twice a year.|$|E
5|$|While the CPC is {{probably}} the organization with most access to North Korea, writing about North Korea is tightly circumscribed. The few reports accessible {{to the general public}} are those about North Korean economic reforms. While Chinese analysts of North Korea tend to speak positively of North Korea in public, in official discussions they show much disdain for North Korea's economic system, the cult of personality which pervades society, the Kim family, the idea of hereditary succession in a socialist state, the security state, the use of scarce resources on the Korean People's Army and the general <b>impoverishment</b> of the North Korean people. There are those analysts who compare the current situation of North Korea with that of China during the Cultural Revolution. Over the years, the CPC has tried to persuade the Workers' Party of Korea (or WPK, North Korea's ruling party) to introduce economic reforms by showing them key economic infrastructure in China. For instance, in 2006 the CPC invited the WPK general secretary Kim Jong-il to Guandong province to showcase the success economic reforms have brought China. In general, the CPC considers the WPK and North Korea to be negative examples of a communist ruling party and socialist state.|$|E

25|$|In 2000, {{a clandestine}} group {{consisting}} mostly of Darfuris published the , a dissident manuscript detailing {{the domination of}} {{the north and the}} <b>impoverishment</b> of the other regions. It was widely discussed, despite attempts to censor it, and many of the writers went on to help found the rebel Justice and Equality Movement.|$|E
25|$|This crisis-driven {{drop into}} a lower income group {{happened}} in other occupations as well. In absolute numbers, {{the hardest hit}} by post-famine <b>impoverishment</b> were women and landless agricultural labourers. In relative terms, those engaged in rural trade, fishing and transport (boatmen and bullock cart drivers) suffered the most. In absolute numbers, agricultural labourers faced {{the highest rates of}} both destitution and mortality.|$|E
25|$|The Pointe-Noire Grand Market area, the {{district}} Number 1 Lumumba and {{the district}} Number 2 Mvoumvou, once predominantly inhabited by Vili nationals, have become a preempted sector by Muslim populations, who have come from West Africa, increasingly pushing the Vili to the peripheral districts of the district number 4 Loandjili or 5 Mongo-Poukou. Indeed, <b>impoverishment</b> pushes families to sell their properties in order to survive.|$|E
25|$|The {{watershed}} moment {{initiating the}} political emancipation {{process of the}} Eurasian segment of colonial society occurred {{in the middle of}} the 19th century, when Indos massively protested the discriminatory provisions implemented with the introduction of the 'Cultivation System' (1830–1870). The start of the 20th century also saw continued and increasing pauperism among poor Indos increasingly dependent on charity, which created the mental specter of indivertible <b>impoverishment.</b>|$|E
25|$|Others {{who came}} later were from poorer families, {{migrating}} from England in the 19th and early 20th centuries {{to escape the}} poverty of London's East End Huguenot enclaves of Spitalfields and Bethnal Green. Their <b>impoverishment</b> had been {{brought on by the}} Industrial Revolution, which caused the collapse of the Huguenot-dominated silk-weaving industry. Many French Australian descendants of Huguenots still consider themselves very much Huguenots or French, even in the twenty-first century.|$|E
25|$|Because Díaz {{had created}} such an {{effective}} centralized government, {{he was able}} to concentrate decision-making and maintain control over the economic instability. This instability arose {{largely as a result of}} the dispossession of hundreds of thousands of peasants of their land. Communal indigenous landholdings were privatized, subdivided, and sold. The Porfiriato thus generated a stark contrast between rapid economic growth and sudden, severe <b>impoverishment</b> of the rural masses, a situation that was to explode in the Mexican revolution of 1910.|$|E
25|$|The {{abolition}} of the Parliament in 1800 had a major economic impact {{on the life of}} the city. Within a decade, many of the finest mansions (including Leinster House, Powerscourt House, and Aldborough House) had been sold, often to government agencies. Though Parliament itself was based on the exclusion of the vast Irish Catholic majority in Ireland, many nationalist historians and writers blamed the absence of Parliament for the increased <b>impoverishment</b> of Dublin, with many of the large mansions in areas like Henrietta Street sold to property developers and landlords who reduced them to tenements.|$|E
25|$|In the {{long-term}} historical perspective, this marked a seminal {{event in the}} collapse of the Ottoman Empire, despite the small size and the <b>impoverishment</b> of the new Greek state. For the first time, a Christian subject people had achieved independence from Ottoman rule and established a fully independent state, recognized by Europe. Whereas previously, only large nations (such as the British or the French) were judged worthy of national self-determination by the Great Powers of Europe, the Greek Revolt legitimized the concept of small, ethnically based nation-states, and emboldened nationalist movements among other subject peoples of the Ottoman Empire. The Serbs, Bulgarians, Romanians and Armenians all subsequently fought for and won their independence.|$|E
25|$|The result was, on average, no {{long-term}} change {{in per capita}} income levels, though cost of living had grown higher. Agriculture was still dominant, with most peasants at the subsistence level. Extensive irrigation systems were built, providing an impetus for switching to cash crops for export and for raw materials for Indian industry, especially jute, cotton, sugarcane, coffee and tea. India's global share of GDP fell drastically from above 20% to less than 5% in the colonial period. Historians have been bitterly divided on issues of economic history, with the Nationalist school (following Nehru) arguing that India was poorer {{at the end of}} British rule than at the beginning and that <b>impoverishment</b> occurred because of the British.|$|E
25|$|In 1956, artistic self-doubt and {{material}} <b>impoverishment</b> {{led to a}} physical and psychological crisis, and Beuys entered a period of serious depression. He recovered {{at the house of}} his most important early patrons, the van der Grinten brothers, in Kranenburg. In 1958, Beuys participated in an international competition for an Auschwitz-Birkenau memorial, but his proposal did not win and his design was never realised. Also in 1958, Beuys began a cycle of drawings related to Joyce's Ulysses. Completed in ca. 1961, the six exercise books of drawings would constitute, Beuys declared, an extension of Joyce's seminal novel. In 1959 Beuys married Eva Wurmbach. They had two children together, Wenzel (born 1961) and Jessyka (born 1964).|$|E
25|$|No National {{newspaper}} {{exists in}} the daily Press of Ireland, and Irish affairs are therefore treated by the existing Press from the standpoints of rival English parties. A result of this denationalising attitude is political chaos and economic <b>impoverishment.</b> The directors {{are convinced that the}} time is ripe for the foundation of a daily organ in the Press of Ireland which, being free from the influence of any English party, will deal with the affairs of Ireland from the Irish standpoint, and whilst asserting the National distinctiveness and independence of Ireland will promote combination and agreement amongst all political sections in Ireland on the questions of Language, Land, Taxation, Industries, Transit, Poor Law.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{dissolution}} of the Soviet Union in 1991, Yalta has struggled economically. Many of the nouveaux riches of ex-Soviet citizens began going to other European holiday resorts, now that they had the freedom and money to travel; conversely, the <b>impoverishment</b> of many ex-Soviet citizens meant that they could no longer afford to go to Yalta. The town's transport links have been significantly reduced with the end of almost all passenger traffic by sea. The longest trolleybus line in Europe goes from the train station in Simferopol to Yalta (almost 90km). Yalta is crowded in the vacation season (July–August) and prices for accommodation are very high. Most of the tourists are from countries of the former Soviet Union; in 2013, about 12% of tourists to the Crimea were Westerners from more than 200 cruise ships.|$|E
25|$|The forest {{contains}} a somewhat reduced fauna and flora. Due to human influence (encroachment {{from all sides}} of the outer edges as well as the long-established thoroughfare roads and highways cutting deep through the forest) and <b>impoverishment</b> of the ecosystem, various plants and animals have become extinct. The forest was home to 46 different mammal species. Of these, seven have disappeared altogether: the brown bear (around 1,000), the wolf (around 1810), the hazel dormouse (around 1842), the Red Deer, the badger, and the hare. The boar was thought to have been extinct since 1957, but in 2007, new specimens were discovered roaming the wood. According to the Flemish Agency for Nature and Forest (ANB), this is unlikely to be a natural spread, but probably two to four animals that most likely were either released or escaped from captivity.|$|E
25|$|Another {{concern is}} the fact that on more than one occasion, the federal {{government}} has threatened to withhold highway funds from states which did not pass certain articles of legislation. Any state which lost highway funding for any extended period would face financial <b>impoverishment,</b> infrastructure collapse or both. Although the first such action (the enactment of a national speed limit) was directly related to highways and done {{in the face of a}} fuel shortage, most subsequent actions have had little or nothing to do with highways and have not been done in the face of any compelling national crisis. An example of this would be the federally mandated drinking age of 21, upheld in South Dakota v. Dole. Critics of such actions feel that when the federal government does this they upset the traditional balance between the states and the federal government.|$|E
25|$|From the {{beginning}} of the 19th century, the British East India Company's gradual expansion and consolidation of power brought a major change in taxation and agricultural policies, which tended to promote commercialisation of agriculture with a focus on trade, resulting in decreased production of food crops, mass <b>impoverishment</b> and destitution of farmers, and in the short term, led to numerous famines. The economic policies of the British Raj caused a severe decline in the handicrafts and handloom sectors, due to reduced demand and dipping employment. After the removal of international restrictions by the Charter of 1813, Indian trade expanded substantially with steady growth. The result was a significant transfer of capital from India to England, which, due to the colonial policies of the British, led to a massive drain of revenue rather than any systematic effort at modernisation of the domestic economy.|$|E
25|$|This {{led to the}} {{rebellion}} of seven Southern slave states and {{the foundation of the}} Confederacy. Its attack of Fort Sumter against the North started the Civil War (1861–1865). Confederate defeat led to the <b>impoverishment</b> of the South and the abolition of slavery. In the Reconstruction Era (1863–1877), legal and voting rights were extended to freed slaves. The national government emerged much stronger, and because of the Fourteenth Amendment in 1868, it gained the explicit duty to protect individual rights. However, when white Democrats regained their power in the South during the 1870s, often by paramilitary suppression of voting, they passed Jim Crow laws to maintain white supremacy, and new disfranchising constitutions that prevented most African Americans and many poor whites from voting. This continued until gains of the Civil Rights movement in the 1960s and passage of federal legislation to enforce constitutional rights.|$|E
25|$|In {{spite of}} this epiphany, Mussorgsky's music still leaned more toward foreign models; a four-hand piano sonata which he {{produced}} in 1860 contains his only movement in sonata form. Nor is any 'nationalistic' impulse easily discernible in the incidental music for Vladislav Ozerov's play Oedipus in Athens, on which he worked {{between the ages of}} 19 and 22 (and then abandoned unfinished), or in the Intermezzo in modo classico for piano solo (revised and orchestrated in 1867). The latter was the only important piece he composed between December 1860 and August 1863: the reasons for this probably lie in the painful re-emergence of his subjective crisis in 1860 and the purely objective difficulties which resulted from the emancipation of the serfs the following year – as a result of which the family was deprived of half its estate, and Mussorgsky had to spend {{a good deal of time}} in Karevo unsuccessfully attempting to stave off their looming <b>impoverishment.</b>|$|E
25|$|In the 3rd century BC, pirate {{attacks on}} Olympos (city in Anatolia) brought <b>impoverishment.</b> Among {{some of the}} most famous ancient pirateering peoples were the Illyrians, a people populating the western Balkan peninsula. Constantly raiding the Adriatic Sea, the Illyrians caused many {{conflicts}} with the Roman Republic. It was not until 229 BC when the Romans finally decisively beat the Illyrian fleets that their threat was ended. During the 1st century BC, there were pirate states along the Anatolian coast, threatening the commerce of the Roman Empire in the eastern Mediterranean. On one voyage across the Aegean Sea in 75BC, Julius Caesar was kidnapped and briefly held by Cilician pirates and held prisoner in the Dodecanese islet of Pharmacusa. The Senate finally invested the general Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus with powers to deal with piracy in 67BC (the Lex Gabinia), and Pompey, after three months of naval warfare, managed to suppress the threat.|$|E
25|$|The Acts of Union 1800 united the Kingdom of Great Britain and the Kingdom of Ireland as the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, {{abolishing the}} Irish Parliament and giving Ireland {{representation}} in the British Parliament. From early on, many Irish nationalists opposed the union and the ensuing exploitation and <b>impoverishment</b> of the island, {{which led to a}} high level of depopulation. Opposition took various forms: constitutional (the Repeal Association; the Home Rule League), social (disestablishment of the Church of Ireland; the Land League) and revolutionary (Rebellion of 1848; Fenian Rising). The Irish Home Rule movement sought to achieve self-government for Ireland, within the United Kingdom. In 1886, the Irish Parliamentary Party (IPP) under Charles Stewart Parnell succeeded in having the First Home Rule Bill introduced in the British parliament, but it was defeated. The Second Home Rule Bill of 1893 was passed by the House of Commons but rejected by the House of Lords.|$|E
25|$|However, Umayyad rule in Armenia grew in cruelty in {{the early}} 8th century. Revolts against the Arabs spread {{throughout}} Armenia until 705, when under the pretext of meeting for negotiations, the Arab ostikan of Nakhichevan massacred {{almost all of the}} Armenian nobility. The Arabs attempted to conciliate with the Armenians but the levying of higher taxes, <b>impoverishment</b> of the country {{due to a lack of}} regional trade, and the Umayyads' preference of the Bagratuni family over the Mamikonians (other notable families included the Artsruni, Kamsarakan, and Rshtuni) made this difficult to accomplish. Taking advantage of the overthrow of the Umayyads by the 'Abbasids, a second rebellion was conceived although it too was met with failure partly because of the frictional relationship between the Bagratuni and Mamikonian families. The rebellion's failure also resulted in the near disintegration of the Mamikonian house which lost most of the land it controlled (members of the Artstruni house were able to escape and settle in Vaspurakan).|$|E
25|$|A further {{limitation}} of the correlation {{is that it does}} not necessarily imply that the causality runs from income to health. It could actually be that better health, as proxied by life expectancy, contributes to higher incomes, rather than vice versa. Better health can increase incomes because healthier individuals tend to be more productive than sick ones; on average they work harder, longer and are more capable of focusing efficiently on production tasks. Furthermore, better health may affect not just the level of income but also its growth rate through its effect on education. Healthier children spend more time at school and learn faster, thus acquiring more human capital which translates into higher growth rates of incomes later in life. Diseases such as malaria can short circuit these processes. Likewise there is evidence that more healthy individuals save more and thus contribute to the faster accumulation of physical capital of an economy. Jeffrey Sachs in particular has emphasized the role that the disease burden has played in the <b>impoverishment</b> of countries located in the tropical zones.|$|E
25|$|After 1857, {{the colonial}} {{government}} strengthened and expanded its infrastructure via the court system, legal procedures, and statutes. The Indian Penal Code came into being. In education, Thomas Babington Macaulay had made schooling {{a priority for}} the Raj in his famous minute of February 1835 and succeeded in implementing the use of English as the medium of instruction. By 1890 some 60,000 Indians had matriculated. The Indian economy grew at about 1% per year from 1880 to 1920, and the population also grew at 1%. However, from 1910s Indian private industry began to grow significantly. India built a modern railway system in the late 19th century which was the fourth largest in the world. The British Raj invested heavily in infrastructure, including canals and irrigation systems in addition to railways, telegraphy, roads and ports. However, historians have been bitterly divided on issues of economic history, with the Nationalist school arguing that India was poorer {{at the end of}} British rule than at the beginning and that <b>impoverishment</b> occurred because of the British.|$|E
25|$|Numerous {{studies have}} tested these {{hypotheses}} {{and some have}} led to significant discoveries. In The Frozen Echo, Kirsten Seaver contests {{some of the more}} generally accepted theories about the demise of the Greenland colony, and asserts that the colony, towards the end, was healthier than Diamond and others have thought. Seaver believes that the Greenlanders cannot have starved to death, but rather may have been wiped out by Inuit or unrecorded European attacks, or they may have abandoned the colony for Iceland or Vinland. However, the physical evidence from archeological studies of the ancient farm sites does not show evidence of attack. The paucity of personal belongings at these sites is typical of North Atlantic Norse sites that were abandoned in an orderly fashion, with any useful items being deliberately removed; but to others it suggests a gradual but devastating <b>impoverishment.</b> Middens at these sites do show an increasingly impoverished diet for humans and livestock. Else Roesdahl argues that declining ivory prices in Europe due to the influx of Russian and African ivory adversely affected the Norse settlements in Greenland, which depended largely on the export of walrus ivory to Europe.|$|E
25|$|The idea of {{holistic}} planned grazing {{began in}} the 1960s when Allan Savory, a wildlife biologist in his native Southern Rhodesia, set out to understand desertification. This {{can be seen in}} the context of the larger environmental movement. Heavily influenced by the work of André Voisin and the ineffectiveness of mainstream rangeland science of the time, Savory concluded that the spread of deserts, the loss of wildlife, and the human <b>impoverishment</b> that always resulted were related to the reduction of the natural herds of large grazers and even more, the change in behavior of those few remaining herds. Livestock could be substituted to provide important ecosystem services like nutrient cycling when mimicking those uniquely coevolved grasses and grazers. But managers had found that while rotational grazing systems can work for diverse management purposes, scientific experiments had demonstrated that they do not necessarily work for specific ecological purposes. An adaptive management plan was needed for the integration of the experiential with the experimental, as well as the social with the biophysical, to provide a more comprehensive framework for the management of rangeland systems. None of these sources of knowledge could be understood except in the context of the whole. Holistic management was developed to meet that need.|$|E
25|$|The {{most serious}} {{demographic}} imbalance {{is between the}} mountainous areas of the interior and the coastal strip. The largest province, L'Aquila, is situated entirely in the interior and has the lowest population density. The movement {{of the population of}} Abruzzo from the mountains to the sea has led to the almost complete urbanisation of the entire coastal strip especially in the province of Teramo and Chieti. The effects on the interior have been <b>impoverishment</b> and a demographic ageing, reflected by an activity rate in the province of L'Aquila which is the lowest of the provinces in Abruzzo – accompanied by geological degradation {{as a result of the}} absence of conservation measures. In the coastal strip, on the other hand, there is such a jumble of accommodation and activities that the environment has been changed with negative effects. The policy of providing incentives for development has resulted in the setting-up of industrial zones, some of which (Vasto, Avezzano, Carsoli, Gissi, Val Vibrata, Val di Sangro) have made genuine progress, while others (Val Pescara, L'Aquila) have run into trouble after initial success. The zones of Sulmona and Guardiagrele have turned out to be more or less failures. Outside these zones, the main activities are agriculture and tourism.|$|E
25|$|Another {{factor was}} {{the decline of}} the {{traditional}} authority structures. Jewish autonomy remained quite secured; later research debunked Simon Dubnow's claim that the Council of Four Lands' demise in 1746 was a culmination of a long process which destroyed judicial independence and {{paved the way for the}} Hasidic rebbes to serve as leaders (another long-held explanation for the sect's rise advocated by Raphael Mahler, that the Khmelnytsky Uprising effected economic <b>impoverishment</b> and despair, was also refuted). However, the magnates and nobles held much sway over the nomination of both rabbis and communal elders, to such a degree that the masses often perceived them as mere lackeys of the land owners. Their ability to serve as legitimate arbiters in disputes – especially those concerning the regulation of leasehold rights over alcohol distillation and other monopolies in the estates – was severely diminished. The reduced prestige of the establishment, and the need for an alternative source of authority to pass judgement, left a vacuum which Hasidic charismatics eventually filled. They transcended old communal institutions, to which all the Jews of a locality were subordinate, and had groups of followers in each town across vast territories. Often supported by rising strata outside the traditional elite, whether nouveau riche or various low-level religious functionaries, they created a modern form of leadership.|$|E
