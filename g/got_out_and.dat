5|$|Strauss, Teller, Borden, and Robb {{would never}} escape the public {{identification}} {{of them with}} the case. In a 1962 television interview, Eric F. Goldman asked Teller whether he favored restoring Oppenheimer's security clearance. Teller was struck dumb, unable to find an answer. The question was deleted from the version that was aired, but the news <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> made headlines. President John F. Kennedy decided that {{the time had come}} to rehabilitate Oppenheimer. Teller nominated Oppenheimer for the 1963 Enrico Fermi Award. The nomination was unanimously approved by the GAC and AEC, and announced on April 5, 1963. On November 22, the White House confirmed that Kennedy would personally present the award, but he was assassinated later that day. The award was presented by President Lyndon B. Johnson instead. Oppenheimer died of cancer on February 18, 1967.|$|E
25|$|According to {{the republican}} sources, when he {{approached}} the car, two Special Air Service (SAS) soldiers <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> commanded him to halt and drop his gun. Mac Giolla Bhrighde, who was unarmed, informed the SAS of this {{and then one of}} the SAS men stepped forward and shot him on his left side. He was then handcuffed and shot dead.|$|E
25|$|Matsuzaka became {{involved}} in a scandal when he began dating Shibata. On September 13, 2000, he drove to her apartment without a valid license. He illegally parked his car and it got towed, and then had a team official take the blame to avoid a scandal. The truth soon <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> he was fined 195,000 yen {{by the police and}} put under house arrest for one month by the Lions.|$|E

25|$|Cathay's Jurong Drive-In cinema {{opened on}} 14 July 1971 and was, at that time, {{the first of}} its kind in Singapore and Malaysia, and the largest in Asia. The 5.6 hectare site was {{equipped}} with 899 speaker stands, 300 seats at the gallery for walk-in customers and the screen was elevated 25 feet from the ground. Cathay distributed Golden Harvest films and when Jurong Drive-In screened Bruce Lee's Big Boss, the line-up of cars was so long that many <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> walked. The show was scheduled for midnight but didn't start screening until 1am.|$|E
25|$|Long {{arrived at}} Hammond Aire Plaza, a {{shopping}} complex on Airline Highway, sometime before 8:40a.m. CT and began scouting {{the area in}} search of police officers. He first spotted a police patrol vehicle parked at a B-Quik convenience store; it belonged to a sheriff's deputy who was working security in the area. Long parked his vehicle behind an adjacent building, <b>got</b> <b>out,</b> <b>and</b> prepared to shoot, but found that the vehicle was empty. He then drove north and noticed a police officer washing his vehicle a short distance away, but the officer left before Long could get close.|$|E
25|$|Next, Recruit {{sailed to}} the Caribbean under Commander Warwick Lake, {{supposedly}} in July, but clearly later. During the voyage, a young sailor named Robert Jeffery was discovered to have stolen the midshipmen's beer and Lake furiously {{ordered him to}} be marooned {{on the island of}} Sombrero. (Jeffery had been born at Fowey but moved to Polperro before becoming a merchant seaman and was then pressed into the navy.) Some months later, Lake's commanding officer Sir Alexander Cochrane discovered what had happened and immediately ordered Lake to retrieve Jeffery. When Recruit arrived at Sombrero, Jeffery could not be found. Eventually the story <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> a court martial dismissed Lake from the service for his actions. As it turned out, Jeffery had been picked up by an American ship and was eventually discovered in Massachusetts three years later, working as a blacksmith. He returned to Britain and received compensation.|$|E

25|$|Along with Bob Simpson, {{he formed}} an opening {{partnership}} that {{was regarded as}} one of the finest in Test history. Lawry was fast between the wickets, and the pair were especially well known for their understanding, as exemplified by their fluency in rotating the strike with quick singles. Lawry was known for his peculiar stance. He had little bend in his knees, and as a result batted with a stoop over his bat. He used his long reach to blunt spin bowling. He played with a very straight bat, combining well-organised defence with a somewhat limited range of strokes, marked by an efficiency of placement and an unusually heavy reliance on the hook shot. His strengths were regarded as his composure and intense concentration which powered a relentless single-mindedness. His defiant style was accentuated by his habit of tugging on his cap after every ball, as though starting afresh. John Snow wrote that 'He always had to be <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> even if you managed to knock all three stumps over he still stayed at the crease a moment looking round for some excuse to continue batting before reluctantly starting his walk back to the dressing room'. Lawry was also a left-hander during his winter baseball recreation, which equipped him with a powerful throwing arm.|$|E
500|$|Perhaps {{the most}} famous ETNC alumnus was future Democratic {{politician}} and Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives Sam Rayburn, who graduated with a bachelor's degree in 1903. Rayburn spoke positively of the school, especially Mayo's credit system that allowed students to [...] "attend free with a promise to pay when they <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> made some money", which [...] "made it possible for {{hundreds and hundreds of}} young people to go to college who could not have afforded to attend another institution".|$|E
500|$|Assuming {{it was a}} {{legitimate}} checkpoint, McCoy informed the others inside the minibus of a military checkpoint up ahead and pulled in at the lay-by as directed by the armed men. As McCoy {{rolled down the window}} and produced his driving licence, gunmen came up to the minibus and one of them said in a Northern Irish accent, [...] "Goodnight, fellas. How are things? Can you step out of the van {{for a few minutes and}} we'll just do a check". The unsuspecting band members <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> were politely told to line up facing the ditch at the rear of the minibus with their hands on their heads. More uniformed men appeared from out of the darkness, their guns pointed at the minibus. About 10 gunmen were at the checkpoint, according to author and journalist Martin Dillon.|$|E

500|$|Bissell {{was born}} on December 1, 1957 in Corpus Christi, Texas. He {{was one of the}} five {{children}} of Donald and Patricia Bissell; his siblings included his twin brother William, two sisters Susan and Barbara, and brother Donald. The family lived in Palos Park, Illinois for several years. His father was a computer-systems designer with Hiram Walker Inc. Bissell was an athlete who enjoyed performing feats of daring: at the age of 8 he jumped off a -high diving board, even though {{he did not know how}} to swim. He dabbled in many sports baseball, basketball, football, track, etc. He was introduced to ballet at age ten by his sister Susan who paid him to be her ballet partner; thus he was first paid to dance. He found a home and sanctuary in the passion of ballet and decided to make it his life pursuit. He began training in ballet and jazz dance and was soon accepted into a company in Toledo, Ohio. Like many boys who take up ballet, he tried to keep his lessons a secret, but word <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> he was ridiculed and bullied every single day for the rest of his school days. [...] "I was a skinny kid. They could have crushed me in an instant," [...] he stated.|$|E
500|$|After Watermelon Man {{proved to}} be a {{financial}} success, Van Peebles was offered a three-picture contract. While the deal was still up in the air, Van Peebles- still wanting to create the first black power film- developed the story for Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song. The initial idea for the film did not come clearly to him at first. One day, Van Peebles drove into the Mojave desert, turned off the highway, and drove over the rise of a hill. He parked the car, <b>got</b> <b>out,</b> <b>and</b> squatted down facing the sun. [...] He decided that the film was going to be [...] "about a brother getting the Man's foot out of his ass."...Is!. Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song DVD, Xenon Entertainment Group, 2003. [...] Because no studio would finance the film, Van Peebles put his own money into the production, and shot it independently. Van Peebles was given a $50,000 loan by Bill Cosby to complete the film. [...] "Cosby didn't want an equity part," [...] according to Van Peebles. [...] "He just wanted his money back." [...] Van Peebles wound up with controlling ownership of the film. Several actors auditioned for the lead role of Sweetback, but told Van Peebles that they wouldn't do the film unless they were given more dialogue. Van Peebles ended up playing the part himself.|$|E
500|$|Promoted acting wing {{commander}} in June 1943, Arthur became wing leader of No.71 Wing, which controlled No.75 Squadron {{and three other}} combat units. On 5November, {{he was involved in}} a collision at Kiriwina Airfield with a Spitfire of No.79 Squadron. The Spitfire pilot was killed, and Arthur received serious burns. He later recalled, [...] "...I felt my hands disappear, felt my face go but the rest of my body was...was just flames...And {{then all of a sudden}} the flames dropped down a bit and I <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> went like mad and I was running away from the aircraft and trying to guess how far I could go before I'd try to put the flames out..." [...] Although his family was informed that his injuries were [...] "of a very slight nature" [...] and that he had been [...] "burnt but not badly", Arthur was close to death for weeks while he was treated in Kiriwina. [...] He was finally repatriated to Sydney where he underwent plastic surgery at Yaralla Military Hospital (now Concord Hospital). After his recovery in April 1944, he attended a staff course before taking over command of No.2 Operational Training Unit at Mildura, Victoria. In August, at the age of 24, he was promoted to temporary group captain, the youngest in the RAAF. That December he took command of No.81 Wing of the Australian First Tactical Air Force (No.1 TAF), based at Noemfoor and Labuan in the Dutch East Indies.|$|E

500|$|The 1939 season {{took place}} under the looming shadow of the coming Second World War, and the {{schedule}} was only halted with the Invasion of Poland in September. The Championship season began with the Belgian Grand Prix in June. In heavy rain, Caracciola spun at La Source, <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> pushed his car off into {{the safety of the}} trees. Later in the race, Seaman left the track at the same corner, his car bursting into flames upon impact with the trees, where he was burnt alive in the cockpit. He died that night in hospital, after briefly regaining consciousness. The entire Mercedes team travelled to London for his burial. In the rest of the season, Caracciola won the German Grand Prix for the sixth and final time, again in the rain, after starting third on the grid. He finished second behind Lang at the Swiss and Tripoli Grands Prix. The latter race was seen as a major win for Mercedes-Benz. In an effort to halt German dominance at the event, the Italian organisers decided to limit engine sizes to 1.5litres (the German teams at the time ran 3-litre engines), and announce the change at the last moment. The change was, however, leaked to Mercedes-Benz well in advance, and in just eight months the firm developed and built two W165s under the new restrictions; both of them beat the combined might of 28Italian cars, much to the disappointment of the organisers. Caracciola believed that the Mercedes-Benz team were favouring Lang during the 1939 season; in a letter sent to Mercedes' brand owner Daimler-Benz CEO Dr. Wilhelm Kissel, he wrote: ...|$|E

Blood tests later showed that Attias was {{under the influence of}} marijuana and Lidocaine, but neither were deemed significant to the incident.|$|E
