5|$|Combs {{began his}} {{political}} career with his election {{to the office of}} city attorney in Prestonsburg in 1950. Later that year, Governor Lawrence Wetherby appointed him to <b>fill</b> <b>a</b> vacancy in the office of Commonwealth's Attorney for Kentucky's 31st Judicial District. Combs announced, however, that he would serve only until a new election could be held. In April 1951, Governor Wetherby appointed Combs to <b>fill</b> <b>a</b> vacancy on the Kentucky Court of Appeals caused by the death of Judge Roy Helm. Later that year, he sought a full eight-year term on the court. His opponent was Simeon S. Willis, a popular former Republican governor who had previously sat on the court. Combs won the election by a vote of 73,298 to 69,379. In George Robinson's oral history, Combs attributed his victory to Willis's advanced age (68) and {{the fact that many of}} Willis' supporters assumed that their candidate would win and did not vote.|$|E

5|$|In many East Asian cultures, salt is not {{traditionally}} {{used as a}} condiment.

5|$|Tessellation or tiling in two {{dimensions}} {{is a topic}} in geometry that studies how shapes, known as tiles, can be arranged to <b>fill</b> <b>a</b> plane without any gaps, according to a given set of rules. These rules can be varied. Common ones are {{that there must be}} no gaps between tiles, and that no corner of one tile can lie along the edge of another. The tessellations created by bonded brickwork do not obey this rule. Among those that do, a regular tessellation has both identical regular tiles and identical regular corners or vertices, having the same angle between adjacent edges for every tile. There are only three shapes that can form such regular tessellations: the equilateral triangle, square, and regular hexagon. Any one of these three shapes can be duplicated infinitely to <b>fill</b> <b>a</b> plane with no gaps.|$|E
5|$|A {{by-election}} {{need not}} be held to <b>fill</b> <b>a</b> vacancy in any GRC triggered by the death or resignation of an MP, {{even if there are}} no other minority candidates in that GRC, or any other reason. A by-election is required only if all the MPs in a GRC vacate their Parliamentary seats. Assuming that such a situation does arise, the Prime Minister would be obliged to call a by-election within a reasonable time, unless he intends to call a general election in the near future.|$|E

5|$|During the September term, a {{jury was}} finally selected, {{and the trial}} {{consumed}} {{the rest of the}} term. Much of the same evidence was presented, and the second jury also voted for a guilty verdict. The date for Desha's execution was set for July 14, 1826. Harry O. Brown, the judge in the case, had been temporarily appointed by Governor Desha to <b>fill</b> <b>a</b> vacancy. He set aside the verdict, ruling that the prosecution had failed to prove that the murder occurred in Fleming County, as charged in the indictment. The prosecution unsuccessfully argued that because a change of venue had already been granted, the place of the murder was immaterial.|$|E
5|$|Hard {{suction hose}} {{can also be}} used to extend the range of a water tender's dumping capability, if the {{fittings}} of the hard suction hose match those of the tender dumping water. This could be used to <b>fill</b> <b>a</b> portable dump tank not immediately adjacent to the water tender, from which another fire engine can draft. Since water movement during dumping relies on gravity, rather than mechanical pressurization, hard suction hose is useful for this task.|$|E
5|$|His {{political}} reputation {{rose with}} his professional plaudits. Hayes declined the Republican nomination for a judgeship in 1856. Two years later, some Republicans proposed Hayes to <b>fill</b> <b>a</b> vacancy {{on the bench}} and he considered accepting the appointment until the office of city solicitor also became vacant. The city council elected Hayes as city solicitor to fill the vacancy, and he won a full two-year term from the voters in April 1859 with a larger majority than other Republicans on the ticket.|$|E

In 1950, Maryland agreed to <b>fill</b> <b>a</b> vacancy in the Navy schedule left open by a Georgetown cancellation. The high-scoring game was the 12th meeting of the intense in-state rivalry and resulted in just the second-ever Maryland win.|$|E

Because of its position in his Periodic Table, Mendeleev called it ekasilicon (Es), and he estimated its atomic weight to be about 72.0.|$|E

The episode was viewed by 4.06 million viewers and received a 2/6 percent rating among adults {{between the ages of}} 18 and 49. The episode ranked third in its timeslot, and it was the highest-rated NBC series of the night.|$|E

5|$|Some {{robotics}} {{research is}} exploring biomimicry of octopus features. Octopus arms can move and sense largely autonomously without intervention from the animal's central nervous system. In 2015 {{a team in}} Italy built soft-bodied robots able to crawl and swim, requiring only minimal computation. In 2017 a German company made an arm with a soft pneumatically controlled silicone gripper fitted with two rows of suckers. It is able to grasp objects such as a metal tube, a magazine, or a ball, and to <b>fill</b> <b>a</b> glass by pouring water from a bottle.|$|E
5|$|The current M-82 {{dates back}} to 1926. It ran from US31 in Hart to the {{northern}} junction of US131 and M-46 in Howard City. The highway was routed through Ferry, Hesperia and Fremont, replacing M-41. In late 1936, M-46 was extended along the section between Newaygo and Howard City, forming a M-46/M-82 concurrency to <b>fill</b> <b>a</b> gap in the M-46 routing. This concurrent section became just M-46 in 1938, shortening M-82 back to the northern M-37 junction in Newaygo. The highway was {{moved to a new}} alignment west of Ferry in late 1947 or early 1948. Instead of heading northwesterly to Hart, it was continued west to end in Shelby.|$|E

Members of the active reserve have an annual minimum training obligation.

Members of the standby reserve are not required to undertake training, and would only be called up in response to a national emergency or to <b>fill</b> <b>a</b> specialised position. Most standby reservists are former full-time members of the ADF.|$|E

Before the vote, the conservative advocacy group Family Foundation of Virginia lobbied heavily against his nomination due to his homosexuality and past activism. He had served for a time {{on the board of}} Equality Virginia, a gay rights advocacy organization. If his nomination had succeeded, he would have become the first openly gay judge in the state.|$|E
