5|$|Spanish missionary Bartolomé de las Casas {{spoke out}} against the <b>enslavement</b> of the natives and the {{brutality}} of the Spaniards.|$|E
5|$|Stowe, a Connecticut-born {{teacher at}} the Hartford Female Seminary and an active abolitionist, {{featured}} the character of Uncle Tom, a long-suffering black slave around whom the stories of other characters revolve. The sentimental novel depicts the reality of slavery while also asserting that Christian love can overcome something as destructive as <b>enslavement</b> of fellow human beings.|$|E
5|$|The Greeks {{had many}} degrees of <b>enslavement.</b> There was a {{multitude}} of categories, ranging from free citizen to chattel slave, and including Penestae or helots, disenfranchised citizens, freedmen, bastards, and metics. The common ground was the deprivation of civic rights.|$|E
5|$|The slave's freedom {{could be}} either total or partial, at the master's whim. In the former, the emancipated slave was legally {{protected}} against all attempts at re-enslavement—for instance, {{on the part}} of the former master's inheritors. In the latter case, the emancipated slave could be liable to a number of obligations to the former master. The most restrictive contract was the paramone, a type of <b>enslavement</b> of limited duration during which time the master retained practically absolute rights.|$|E
5|$|The title Django Unchained {{alludes to}} the titles of the 1966 Corbucci film Django; Hercules Unchained, the American title for the 1959 Italian epic fantasy film Ercole e la regina di Lidia, about the mythical hero's escape from <b>enslavement</b> to a wicked master; and to Angel Unchained, the 1970 American biker film about a biker {{exacting}} revenge on {{a large group of}} rednecks.|$|E
5|$|By {{the rules}} of war of the period, the victor possessed {{absolute}} rights over the vanquished, whether they were soldiers or not. <b>Enslavement,</b> while not systematic, was common practice. Thucydides recalls that 7,000 inhabitants of Hyccara in Sicily were taken prisoner by Nicias and sold for 120 talents in the neighbouring village of Catania. Likewise in 348 BC the population of Olynthus was reduced to slavery, as was that of Thebes in 335 BC by Alexander the Great and that of Mantineia by the Achaean League.|$|E
5|$|Jennings's salary as governor, {{which was}} the highest for an elected {{official}} in the state, was $1,000. Under the constitution, the governor served a three-year term and was prohibited from serving more that six years in a nine-year period. Jennings's agenda called for establishing court proceedings to secure justice, organizing a state-funded educational systems, creating a state banking system, preventing unlawful seizure and <b>enslavement</b> of free blacks, organizing a state library, and planning internal improvements. His efforts had limited success, due, in part, to the state's limited financial resources and Jennings's limited powers as governor.|$|E
5|$|The {{existence}} of Greek slaves {{was a constant}} source of discomfort for free Greeks. The <b>enslavement</b> of cities was also a controversial practice. Some generals refused, such as the Spartans Agesilaus II and Callicratidas. Some cities passed accords to forbid the practice: {{in the middle of the}} 3rd century BC, Miletus agreed not to reduce any free Knossian to slavery, and vice versa. Conversely, the emancipation by ransom of a city that had been entirely reduced to slavery carried great prestige: Cassander, in 316 BC, restored Thebes. Before him, Philip II of Macedon enslaved and then emancipated Stageira.|$|E
5|$|The last tenet, '{{socialism}}', did {{not mean}} socialism as it is defined in the West, but rather a unique form of Arab socialism. Aflaq coined the word Arab socialism for his variant of socialism. Socialism, in its original form in the Arab world had, according to Aflaq, first come into being {{under the rule of}} Muhammad. The point of Arab socialism was not to answer questions such as: how much state control was necessary, or economic equality; but instead Arab socialism was a system that freed the Arab people from oppression and <b>enslavement,</b> which in turn created independent individuals.|$|E
5|$|The text {{presents}} Cyrus as entering Babylon peacefully {{and being}} welcomed by {{the population as}} a liberator. This presents an implicit contrast with previous conquerors, notably the Assyrian rulers Tukulti-Ninurta I, who invaded and plundered Babylon in the 12th century BC, and Sennacherib, who did the same thing 150 years before Cyrus conquered the region. The massacre and <b>enslavement</b> of conquered people was common practice and was explicitly highlighted by conquerors in victory statements. The Cyrus Cylinder presents a very different message; Johannes Haubold notes that it portrays Cyrus's takeover as a harmonious moment of convergence between Babylonian and Persian history, not a natural disaster but the salvation of Babylonia.|$|E
5|$|While {{there was}} no {{accompanying}} political liberalization, with Gaddafi retaining predominant control, in March 2010, the government devolved further powers to the municipal councils. Rising numbers of reformist technocrats attained positions in the country's governance; best known was Gaddafi's son and heir apparent Saif al-Islam Gaddafi, who was openly critical of Libya's human rights record. He led a group who proposed the drafting of the new constitution, although it was never adopted. Involved in encouraging tourism, Saif founded several privately run media channels in 2008, but after criticizing the government they were nationalized in 2009. In October 2010, Gaddafi apologized to African leaders for the historical <b>enslavement</b> of Africans by the Arab slave trade.|$|E
5|$|After the attack, Selver roams {{through the}} forest for five days before coming upon an Athshean settlement. After {{recovering}} {{from the effects of}} many days of travel, Selver describes {{to the people of the}} town the destruction of his town, known as Eshreth, by the Terrans, who then built their headquarters at the site. He also tells them about the <b>enslavement</b> of hundreds of Athsheans at the various camps. He says that the Terrans are crazy because they do not respect the sanctity of life in the same way that the Athsheans do, which was why he led the attack against camp Smith. After some discussion, the people of the town send messengers to other towns sharing Selver's story, while Selver himself travels back towards the Terran headquarters.|$|E
5|$|In 1514, Las Casas was {{studying}} {{a passage in}} the book Ecclesiasticus (Sirach) 34:18–22 for a Pentecost sermon and pondering its meaning. Las Casas was finally convinced that all {{the actions of the}} Spanish in the New World had been illegal and that they constituted a great injustice. He made up his mind to give up his slaves and encomienda, and started to preach that other colonists should do the same. When his preaching met with resistance, he realized {{that he would have to}} go to Spain to fight there against the <b>enslavement</b> and abuse of the native people. Aided by Pedro de Córdoba and accompanied by Antonio de Montesinos, he left for Spain in September 1515, arriving in Seville in November.|$|E
5|$|To {{varying degrees}} {{throughout}} Roman history, {{the existence of}} a pool of inexpensive labor in the form of slaves was an important factor in the economy. Slaves were acquired for the Roman workforce through a variety of means, including purchase from foreign merchants and the <b>enslavement</b> of foreign populations through military conquest. With Rome's heavy involvement in wars of conquest in the 2nd and 1st centuries BC, tens if not hundreds of thousands of slaves at a time were imported into the Roman economy from various European and Mediterranean acquisitions. While there was limited use for slaves as servants, craftsmen, and personal attendants, vast numbers of slaves worked in mines and on the agricultural lands of Sicily and southern Italy.|$|E
5|$|Alvarado's subjugation of Honduras proved superficial, {{and largely}} limited to Higueras. His {{conquest of the}} Naco valley and the lower Ulúa River firmly {{established}} a Spanish presence there, but beyond that Spanish control was fragile. Expeditions had penetrated deeply across Honduras, and distant native rulers had come to offer homage to the Spanish Crown. The settlement at Gracias a Dios was not as secure as it had appeared when Alvarado left, and no effective assistance {{had been sent to}} Trujillo. Many native rulers, who had been cowed by Alvarado's formidable reputation and military skill, rose in rebellion as soon as he left the province. Alvarado had also encouraged the <b>enslavement</b> of natives that fought against the Spanish, and their subsequent sale, as well as general harsh treatment of the indigenous population; this produced considerable resentment among the Indians, and left them susceptible to rebellion. Many natives resisted passively, by not providing supplies or labour to their encomenderos. Continued slave raids, and ferocious treatment {{at the hands of the}} Achi Maya auxiliaries increased their hatred and resistance, and many Indians abandoned their settlements and fled to the mountains and forests. The greater part of the districts of San Pedro and Gracias a Dios were at war, and the Spanish position was again precarious.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of its}} race-centric {{functions}} during World War II, the SS {{oversaw the}} isolation and displacement of Jews from the populations of the conquered territories, seizing their assets and deporting them to concentration camps and ghettos, where they were used as slave labor or immediately killed. Chosen to implement the Final Solution for Jews and other groups deemed inferior or enemies of the state, the SS led the killing, torture, and <b>enslavement</b> of approximately 12 million people. Most victims were Jews or of Polish or other Slavic extraction. A significant number of victims were members of other racial or ethnic {{groups such as the}} Romani people. The SS was involved in killing people viewed as threats to race hygiene or NSDAP ideology, including the mentally or physically handicapped, homosexuals, and political dissidents. Members of trade unions and those perceived to be affiliated with groups that opposed the regime (religious, political, social, and otherwise), or those whose views were contradictory to the goals of the NSDAP government, were rounded up in large numbers; these included clergy of all faiths, Jehovah's Witnesses, Freemasons, Communists, and Rotary Club members. According to the judgments rendered at the Nuremberg trials as well as many war crimes investigations and trials conducted since then, the SS was responsible for the majority of Nazi war crimes. In particular, it was the primary organization which carried out the Holocaust.|$|E
5|$|At {{the urging}} of both Yeesha and Esher, the player travels across four Ages, {{collecting}} four slates that unlock the tablet's power. Esher occasionally appears in the Ages to offer his counsel, or reveal the histories of his people and the worlds the player explores. Once all four slates are collected, Esher requests that the player bring the tablet {{to him in the}} now-unlocked Age of Myst. The player is then returned to K'veer, where they have four possible choices. Travelling to Myst without the tablet will cause Esher to angrily abandon the player with no way out. If Esher is given the tablet, he will explain he wishes to use the tablet for domination, and will also leave the player trapped. If the player gives the tablet to Yeesha, the tablet simply slips through her hands and disappears into the ground; she walks away, disappointed, leaving the player trapped in D'ni. The only good ending involves giving the Bahro the tablet, ending their <b>enslavement.</b> Arriving at Releeshahn, the new home Age of the D'ni, Yeesha and Atrus thank the player and speak of a new chapter for the D'ni people; Esher is handed over to the Bahro to be punished for his crimes. The game ends on a visit to Releeshahn.|$|E
5|$|Jewish {{settlement}} {{was taking place}} in Poland since very early times. In 1264, Duke Bolesław the Pious of Greater Poland granted the privileges of the Statute of Kalisz, which specified {{a broad range of}} freedoms of religious practices, movement, and trading for the Jews. It also created a legal precedent for the official protection of Jews from local harassment and exclusion. The act exempted the Jews from <b>enslavement</b> or serfdom and was the foundation of future Jewish prosperity in the Polish kingdom; it was later followed by many other comparable legal pronouncements. Following a series of expulsions of Jews from Western Europe, Jewish communities were established in Kraków, Kalisz and elsewhere in western and southern Poland in the 13th century. Another series of communities were established at Lviv, Brest-Litovsk and Grodno further east in the 14th century. King Casimir received Jewish refugees from Germany in 1349, which assisted the acceleration of a Jewish expansion in Poland that was to continue until World War II. German urban and rural settlements were another long-lasting ethnic feature.|$|E
5|$|Pro-slavery advocates {{claimed that}} enslaved Africans were lesser {{human beings who}} benefited from their bondage. Wilberforce, the Clapham Sect and others were anxious to {{demonstrate}} that Africans, and particularly freed slaves, had human and economic abilities beyond the slave trade, {{and that they were}} capable of sustaining a well-ordered society, trade and cultivation. Inspired in part by the utopian vision of Granville Sharp, they became involved in the establishment in 1792 of a free colony in Sierra Leone with black settlers from the United Kingdom, Nova Scotia and Jamaica, as well as native Africans and some whites. They formed the Sierra Leone Company, with Wilberforce subscribing liberally to the project in money and time. The dream was of an ideal society in which races would mix on equal terms; the reality was fraught with tension, crop failures, disease, death, war and defections to the slave trade. Initially a commercial venture, the British government assumed responsibility for the colony in 1808. The colony, although troubled at times, was to become a symbol of anti-slavery in which residents, communities and African tribal chiefs, worked together to prevent <b>enslavement</b> at the source, supported by a British naval blockade to stem the region's slave trade.|$|E
5|$|Władysław's last {{plan was}} to orchestrate a major war between the European powers and the Ottoman Empire. The border with the Empire was in a near {{constant}} state of low-level warfare; some historians estimate {{that in the first}} half of the 17th century, Ottoman raids and wars resulted in the loss (death or <b>enslavement)</b> of about 300,000 Commonwealth citizens in the borderlands. The war, Władysław hoped, would also solve the problem of unrest among the Cossacks, a militant group living in the Ukraine, near the Ottoman border, who could find worth in such a campaign, and turn their attention to fighting for the Commonwealth, instead of against it. As usual, he failed to inspire the nobility, rarely willing to consider sponsoring another war, to agree to this plan. He received more support from foreign powers, from Rome, Venice and Muscovy. With the promise of funds for the war, Władysław started recruiting troops among the Cossacks in 1646. The opposition of the Sejm, demanding that he dismiss the troops, coupled with Władysław's worsening health, crippled that plan as well. Władysław still did not give up, and attempted to resurrect the plan in 1647, and with support of magnate Jeremi Wiśniowiecki (who organized military exercises near Ottoman border), attempted unsuccessfully to provoke the Ottomans to attack.|$|E
5|$|The Prime Minister {{recognized}} that the modernization of Madagascar and its system of state administration could strengthen the country against invasion by a Western power and directed his energy to this end. In 1877, he outlawed the <b>enslavement</b> of the Makoa community. Rainilaiarivony expanded the public education system, declaring school attendance mandatory in 1881 and forming a cadre of school inspectors the following year to ensure education quality. The island's first pharmacy was established by LMS missionaries in 1862, and the first hospital was inaugurated in Antananarivo three years later, followed by the launching in 1875 of a state medical system staffed by civil servant clinicians. Rainilaiarivony enacted a series of new legal codes {{over the course of}} his administration that sought to create a more humane social order. The number of capital offenses was reduced from eighteen to thirteen, and he put an end to the tradition of collective family punishment for the crimes of one individual. Fines were fixed for specific offenses and corporal punishment was limited to being locked in irons. The structure of legal administration was reorganized so that matters that exceeded the authority of the traditional community courts at the level of the fokonolona village collective, administered by local magistrates and village heads, would be referred to the three high courts established in the capital in 1876, although final judicial authority remained with Rainilaiarivony. The Code of 305 Laws established that same year would form the basis of the legal system applied in Madagascar for the remainder of the 19th century and throughout much of the colonial period. To strengthen rule of law, the Prime Minister introduced a rural police force, modernized the court system and eliminated certain unjust privileges that had disproportionately benefited the noble class.|$|E
25|$|Rape {{was first}} {{recognised}} {{as a crime}} against humanity when the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia issued arrest warrants based on the Geneva Conventions and Violations of the Laws or Customs of War. Specifically, it was recognised that Muslim women in Foca (southeastern Bosnia and Herzegovina) were subjected to systematic and widespread gang rape, torture, and sexual <b>enslavement</b> by Bosnian Serb soldiers, policemen, and members of paramilitary groups after the takeover of the city in April 1992. The indictment was of major legal significance and {{was the first time that}} sexual assaults were investigated for the purpose of prosecution under the rubric of torture and <b>enslavement</b> as {{a crime against humanity}}. The indictment was confirmed by a 2001 verdict by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia that rape and sexual <b>enslavement</b> are crimes against humanity. This ruling challenged the widespread acceptance of rape and sexual <b>enslavement</b> of women as intrinsic part of war. The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia found three Bosnian Serb men guilty of rape of Bosniac (Bosnian Muslim) women and girls (some as young as 12 and 15 years of age), in Foca, eastern Bosnia and Herzegovina. Furthermore, two of the men were found guilty of the crime against humanity of sexual <b>enslavement</b> for holding women and girls captive in a number of de facto detention centres. Many of the women subsequently disappeared.|$|E
25|$|<b>Enslavement</b> and slavery, {{civil and}} {{domestic}} violence, sexual abuse, and extreme poverty are also sources of trauma {{that can be}} transferred to subsequent generations.|$|E

25|$|But they {{constantly}} {{sought to}} alleviate the evils of slavery and repeatedly denounced the mass <b>enslavement</b> of conquered populations and the infamous slave trade, thereby undermining slavery at its sources.|$|E
25|$|Cultural anthropologists use {{the spread}} of {{cultural}} items to examine inter-cultural middleman trade, migration, direct trade and intermarriage, <b>enslavement</b> after warfare, and mutual absorption of cultural elements between the prehistoric peoples.|$|E
25|$|The {{presence}} of an increased number of free people of color (free blacks), particularly in the North and Upper South, altered the prevailing racial categories. By 1810, 75 percent of all African Americans in the North were free. By 1840, virtually all African Americans in the North were free. Previously the color of one’s skin was associated with slavery, black (or ethnic African) indicating enslaved and white indicating free. After the Revolution, when {{tens of thousands of}} African Americans gained their freedom, either by having volunteered or being manumitted, racial <b>enslavement</b> appeared inconsistent. Free blacks subverted the logic of racially based <b>enslavement.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{right to}} {{petition}} for freedom descended from English common law and allowed people to challenge their <b>enslavement</b> or indenture. Petitioners challenged slavery both directly and indirectly, even if slaveholders generally viewed such petitions {{as a means to}} uphold rather than undermine slavery. Beginning with the colonies in North America, legislatures enacted slave laws that created a legal basis for “just subjection;” these were adopted or updated by the state and territorial legislatures that superseded them after the United States gained independence. These codes also enabled enslaved persons to sue for freedom based on wrongful <b>enslavement.</b>|$|E
25|$|A secret Nazi plan, the Generalplan Ost {{called for}} the <b>enslavement,</b> {{expulsion}} or extermination of most Slavic peoples in Europe. Approximately 2.8 million Soviet POWs died of starvation, mistreatment, or executions in just eight months of 1941–42.|$|E
25|$|The {{removal of}} the horoi clearly {{provided}} immediate economic relief for the most oppressed group in Attica, and it also brought an immediate end to the <b>enslavement</b> of Athenians by their countrymen. Some Athenians had already been sold into slavery abroad and some had fled abroad to escape <b>enslavement</b> – Solon proudly records in verse the return of this diaspora. It has been cynically observed, however, that few of these unfortunates were {{likely to have been}} recovered. It has been observed also that the seisachtheia not only removed slavery and accumulated debt, it also removed the ordinary farmer's only means of obtaining further credit.|$|E
25|$|Some {{advocates of}} right-libertarianism, among them philosopher Robert Nozick, address this {{inconsistency}} in modern societies, arguing that a consistently libertarian society would allow and regard as valid consensual/non-coercive <b>enslavement</b> contracts, rejecting {{the notion of}} inalienable rights.|$|E
25|$|In 1823, Marshall {{became the}} first {{president}} of the Richmond branch of the American Colonization Society, which was dedicated to resettling freed American slaves in Liberia, on the West coast of Africa. In 1825, as Chief Justice, Marshall wrote an opinion {{in the case of the}} captured slave ship Antelope, in which he acknowledged that slavery was against natural law, but upheld the continued <b>enslavement</b> of approximately 1/3 of the ship's cargo (although the remainder were to be sent to Liberia). In his last will and testament, Marshall gave his elderly manservant the choice either of freedom and travel to Liberia, or continued <b>enslavement</b> under his choice of Marshall's children.|$|E
25|$|As an adult, Osceola {{took two}} wives, as did some other Creek and Seminole leaders. With them, {{he had at}} least five children. One of his wives was an African American, and he {{fiercely}} opposed the <b>enslavement</b> of free people.|$|E
25|$|In February 1609 a royal edict {{arrived in}} Mexico prohibiting {{once again the}} <b>enslavement</b> of the Indians. Velasco hijo rigorously {{enforced}} this decree against the encomenderos and the mineowners. Like his father, this viceroy {{was known as a}} defender of the Indians.|$|E
25|$|In {{a modern}} liberal-capitalist society, the {{employment}} contract is enforced while the <b>enslavement</b> contract is not; the former being considered valid {{because of its}} consensual/non-coercive nature, and the latter being considered inherently invalid, consensual or not. The noted economist Paul Samuelson described this discrepancy.|$|E
25|$|The Spanish {{colonization}} of the Americas sparked {{a discussion about}} the right to enslave Native Americans. A prominent critic of slavery in the Spanish New World colonies was Bartolomé de las Casas, who opposed the <b>enslavement</b> of Native Americans, and later also of Africans in America.|$|E
