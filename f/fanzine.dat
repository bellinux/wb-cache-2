5|$|Brian Moore's Head Looks Uncannily Like London Planetarium– webzine {{devoted to}} the club, which {{previously}} existed from 1988 to 2006 as a paper <b>fanzine.</b> Named in honour of the club's most famous supporter, the late commentator Brian Moore.|$|E
5|$|In an {{interview}} for the <b>fanzine</b> The Disused Yeti, Shanahan stated that although he and Parry had found paper records relating to the censoring of early to mid William Hartnell stories, the excised portions for all stories from An Unearthly Child to The Gunfighters had been destroyed some time before Shanahan and Parry's investigation.|$|E
5|$|The {{sketches}} even {{led to a}} <b>fanzine</b> {{and appreciation}} gatherings, where fans would dress up as the characters. In 2004, in a poll on its website, Channel 4 voted Acorn Antiques the seventh best comedy sketch of all time. In 2005, Acorn Antiques {{was turned into a}} West End musical (see below).|$|E
50|$|KMHL <b>fanzines</b> were {{released}} in April 2010. There are three <b>fanzines</b> that include {{interviews with the}} main cast.|$|R
50|$|Another sizable {{group of}} <b>fanzines</b> arose in {{role-playing}} game (RPG) fandom, where <b>fanzines</b> allowed people to publish {{their ideas and}} views on specific games and their role-playing campaigns. Role-playing <b>fanzines</b> allowed people to communicate in the 1970s, and 1980s with complete editorial control {{in the hands of}} the players, as opposed to the game publishers. These early RPG <b>fanzines</b> were generally typed, sold mostly in an A5 format (in the UK) and were usually illustrated with abysmal or indifferent artwork.|$|R
50|$|Mark Wilkins, the {{promotion}} director for 1982 onwards US punk/thrash label Mystic Records, had over 450 US <b>fanzines</b> and 150 foreign <b>fanzines</b> he promoted to regularly. He and Mystic Records owner Doug Moody edited The Mystic News Newsletter {{which was published}} quarterly and went into every promo package to <b>fanzines.</b> Wilkins also published the highly successful Los Angeles punk humor zine Wild Times and when {{he ran out of}} funding for the zine syndicated some of the humorous material to over 100 US <b>fanzines</b> under the name of Mystic Mark.|$|R
5|$|At {{the same}} time that the first issue of New Worlds appeared, a {{separate}} British magazine called Fantasy was launched by Walter Gillings, a science fiction fan and a reporter by profession. Fantasy lasted for only three issues before dying in 1947, but Gillings had accumulated a substantial inventory of stories—enough to fill nine issues. Gillings followed the demise of Fantasy by publishing a <b>fanzine,</b> titled Fantasy Review, beginning in March 1947.|$|E
5|$|Harry became {{interested}} in science fiction and read comics by candlelight (as the house had no electricity), eventually joining the Liverpool Science Fiction Society. At the age of 13, he produced his own science fiction <b>fanzine,</b> Biped, using a Gestetner machine to print 60 copies. His pen friend {{at the time was}} Michael Moorcock; the writer of science fiction and fantasy novels. After winning a scholarship to the Junior School of Art in Gambier Terrace, Liverpool, Harry started his first school newspaper, Premier.|$|E
5|$|In the December 1934 – January 1935 {{issue of}} Hornig's <b>fanzine,</b> Fantasy Magazine, {{he took the}} unusual step of listing several stories that he had {{rejected}} as lacking novelty, but which had subsequently appeared in print in other magazines. The list includes several by successful writers of the day, such as Raymond Z. Gallun and Miles Breuer. The most prominent story named is Triplanetary by E. E. Smith, which appeared in Amazing.|$|E
50|$|There {{are many}} <b>fanzines</b> {{using the term}} as a title: Ted White, Redd Boggs and Carl Brandon {{published}} science fiction <b>fanzines</b> titled Gafia, Gafia Advertiser and Gafiac. respectively, {{and there are many}} more.|$|R
50|$|In the United States, sports <b>fanzines</b> are {{relatively}} rare. In Boston {{they are a}} bit more common. There are two <b>fanzines</b> sold outside Fenway Park including Yawkey Way Report, which {{is run by a}} former Marine.|$|R
50|$|Kemp edited {{a number}} of science fiction <b>fanzines</b> up until 1965, {{including}} Destiny and SaFari. After a 37-year break, Kemp returned to editing <b>fanzines</b> with e*I*, which focuses on his memoirs of the science fiction world and is available online.|$|R
5|$|The {{club has}} {{published}} an official matchday programme for supporters since 1905. The publication was entitled Albion News for many years, but was renamed Albion from the 2002–03 season until the close season of 2013, {{when it was}} renamed back to Albion News. It won Premier League Programme of the Year in 2002–03 and Third Division Programme of the Year in 1991–92. In 2007–08, it was awarded Championship Programme of the Year by both Programme Monthly and the Football Programme Directory. The programme has a circulation in excess of 8,000 copies. The first West Bromwich Albion <b>fanzine,</b> Fingerpost, was published from 1983 until 1992, and was followed by several others, most notably Grorty Dick (1989–2005) and Last Train to Rolfe Street (1992–1995). Since Grorty Dick ceased publication in 2005, the club now only has one <b>fanzine</b> dedicated to it; 'Baggie Shorts' which is produced by the West Bromwich Albion Supporters' Club London Branch.|$|E
5|$|The {{club was}} founded in 2005 by disaffected {{supporters}} of Manchester United. Although fans had various reasons for dissatisfaction, the catalyst for F.C. United's formation was the 12 May 2005 takeover of Manchester United by American businessman Malcolm Glazer. Supporters first considered forming a breakaway club in 1998 during an attempted takeover of Manchester United by BSkyB. The creation of F.C. United {{in the event of}} a Glazer buyout was first proposed in February 2005 by Manchester United <b>fanzine</b> Red Issue.|$|E
5|$|As well, women {{played an}} active role in the {{underground}} grunge scene, such as riot grrrls who produced zines about grunge bands and indie record labels (e.g., Grunge Gerl #1) and Seattle scene leader Dawn Anderson, who wrote for the Seattle <b>fanzine</b> Backlash. Tina Casale was the co-founder of C/Z Records in the 1980s (along with Chris Hanzsek), an indie label that recorded what has been called earliest grunge record, Deep Six, in 1986, which included Soundgarden, the Melvins, Malfunkshun, Skin Yard, Green River, and the U-Men.|$|E
50|$|AYSTGH set a {{trend in}} indie-pop <b>fanzines</b> by {{including}} flexi-discs including the earliest releases by bands such as Baby Lemonade, Remember Fun, The Clouds, The Bachelor Pad, Razorcuts, Talulah Gosh, The Siddeleys and Reserve {{and several of the}} early Sarah Records bands. The series of flexidiscs - released on the Sha-La-La label - was shared across several <b>fanzines</b> operating at the time, initially Simply Thrilled, Baby Honey, Trout Fishing In Leytonstone and subsequently <b>fanzines</b> in Japan and Germany.|$|R
40|$|This article recovers and contextualizes the {{politics}} of British punk <b>fanzines</b> produced in the late 1970 s and early 1980 s. It argues that <b>fanzines</b> – and youth cultures more generally – provide a contested cultural space {{for young people to}} express their ideas, opinions and anxieties. Simultaneously, it maintains that punk <b>fanzines</b> offer the historian a portal into a period of significant socio-economic, political and cultural change. As well as presenting alternative cultural narratives to the formulaic accounts of punk and popular music now common in the mainstream media, <b>fanzines</b> allow us a glimpse of the often radical ideas held by a youthful milieu rarely given expression in the political arena...|$|R
50|$|As {{technology}} developed, so did <b>fanzines.</b> A {{move from}} photocopying to offset litho printing {{in the early}} 1980s allowed the bigger selling <b>fanzines</b> to improve print quality, although lower-circulation titles continued to use photocopying for many years after this. Bath-based Skaro {{was one of the}} first <b>fanzines</b> to be professionally typeset, but that was virtually the exception as this was such an expensive process. The 1970s-80s <b>fanzines</b> were all produced well before modern, affordable, home computers with crisp laser printers made the revolution that was desktop publishing. Most were produced under difficult conditions, and early editors had to do everything by hand, all their own typing, with no spell check, meaning correcting mistakes was a nightmare, and final lay out could take days, if not weeks.|$|R
5|$|In 1967 {{categories}} for Novelette, Fan Writer, and Fan Artist were added, and a category for Best Novella was added the following year; these new categories {{had the effect}} of providing a definition for what word count qualified a work for what category, which was previously left up to voters. Novelettes had also been awarded prior to the codification of the rules. The fan awards were initially conceived as separate from the Hugo Awards, with the award for Best <b>Fanzine</b> losing its status, but were instead absorbed into the regular Hugo Awards by the convention committee.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} decade of the 21st century some groups reached {{mainstream}} popularity. There are Christian metal bands that perform virtually every subgenre of metal. The Christian metal movement has spread worldwide since it emerged in the early 1980s, and there are now hundreds of active Christian metal bands. Inspired by the metal revival, many 1980s bands have made comebacks including Saint, Bloodgood and Stryper. In October 2004, Doug Van Pelt brought Heaven's Metal back as its own <b>fanzine.</b> The Internet has had a significant role on the revival of Christian metal as well. Many websites and online communities are dedicated to discussions about Christian metal's music, events, and bands.|$|E
5|$|David Boswell was amongst {{those in}} the 1980s who made the jump from the <b>fanzine</b> world when he began self-{{publishing}} Reid Fleming, World's Toughest Milkman in 1980. From {{out of the same}} scene, Bill Marks started publishing the anthology Vortex in Toronto in 1982. Marks' Vortex Comics expanded into publishing other comics. The publisher gained publicity for Mister X, which employed the talents of Dean Motter, Gilberto and Jaime Hernandez and, later, Torontonians Seth and Jeffrey Morgan. Most notably, Marks picked up Chester Brown's Yummy Fur, a taboo-breaking series which started in 1983 as a self-published, photocopied minicomic. It had generated some buzz, and Vortex started publishing it professionally at the end of 1986. Yummy Furs stories were a mix of genres, with the improvised, surreal Ed the Happy Clown, straight adaptations of the Gospels, and revealing, bare-all autobiographical stories. Brown would become a major figure in Canadian comics.|$|E
40|$|This study {{deals with}} the changes within Czech and Slovak hardcore-punk <b>fanzines</b> from the {{beginning}} of 90 s up to the present time. It’s based on research into youth subculture and also on the interpretation of “independent” literature in accordance with media studies. Firstly, it analyzes marginal subculture (or scene) of hardcore-punk and focuses on its production, meaning printed <b>fanzines.</b> Secondly the study asks whether those <b>fanzines</b> could be considered as “contraculture”, therefore an independent or antagonistic sphere against so called mainstream cultural production. The main object of the thesis is the enumeration of Czech and Slovak <b>fanzines</b> in the above mentioned period and mainly interpretations of political topics reflected in that mags, as well as their changes and corrections...|$|R
50|$|Soon {{after the}} fans started to {{communicate}} directly {{with each other}} came the creation of science fiction <b>fanzines.</b> These amateur publications {{might or might not}} discuss science fiction and were generally traded rather than sold. They ranged from the utilitarian or inept to professional-quality printing and editing. In recent years, Usenet newsgroups such as rec.arts.sf.fandom, websites and blogs have somewhat supplanted printed <b>fanzines</b> as an outlet for expression in fandom, though many popular <b>fanzines</b> continue to be published. Science-fiction fans have been among the first users of computers, email, personal computers and the Internet.|$|R

5|$|The {{character}} of Thrud {{was created by}} the then 18-year-old Critchlow in 1981 while he was at foundation art college. His graphic design tutor, Bryan Talbot, gave him the project of producing a comic strip. At the time, Critchlow was reading the Conan books by Robert E. Howard, and this inspired him to produce Thrud. The initial five-page strip was published in comics <b>fanzine</b> Arken Sword. When Critchlow moved on to art college in Liverpool, Thrud made a further appearance in the comic Dead 'Ard, which Critchlow co-authored with artist Euan Smith. Dead 'Ard also featured a strip titled The Black Currant, subsequently re-published in the 26th and final issue of the Warrior comic anthology. The Black Currant would later appear as one of Thrud's many enemies.|$|E
5|$|Writer Howard Weinstein {{had been}} a fan of space {{exploration}} following the flight of NASA astronaut Alan Shepard on Mercury-Redstone 3. He recalled that his first experience of Star Trek was in middle school, where he mixed elements of the show up with Lost in Space. He began watching the show and was inspired to write for television after reading The Making of Star Trek by Gene Roddenberry and Stephen E. Whitfield. While in the 11th grade, he had a Star Trek short story published in the <b>fanzine</b> Probe, which was a yearly publication in East Meadow High School. Weinstein also wrote a script for , but the script was turned down as it was not submitted via an agent. It was returned with a list of suggested agents, and his father recognised Bill Cooper's name on the list from their school years together.|$|E
5|$|Gillings had an {{inventory}} of material that he had acquired while editing Fantasy, and he drew on this for Science Fantasy, as well as incorporating his own <b>fanzine,</b> Science Fantasy Review, into the new magazine. Once Carnell took over, Science Fantasy typically ran a long lead novelette along with several shorter stories; prominent contributors in the 1950s included John Brunner, Ken Bulmer, and Brian Aldiss, whose first novel Nonstop appeared (in an early version) in the February 1956 issue. Fantasy stories began to appear more frequently during {{the latter half of}} the 1950s, and in the early 1960s Carnell began to publish Thomas Burnett Swann's well-received historical fantasies. Carnell felt that the literary quality of Science Fantasy was always higher than that of New Worlds, and in the early 1960s his efforts were rewarded with three consecutive Hugo nominations for best magazine. Under Bonfiglioli more new writers appeared, including Keith Roberts, Brian Stableford and Josephine Saxton. In the opinion of science fiction historian Mike Ashley, the final year of Impulse, as it was titled by that time, included some of the best material ever published in a British science fiction magazine.|$|E

5|$|In 1979, Dave Kelly, who {{had been}} a member of the John Dummer Blues Band formed The Blues Band with ex-Manfred Mann vocalist Paul Jones and Gary Fletcher, who {{continued}} to tour and record rhythm and blues into the new millennium. Roots music, including rhythm and blues, began to enjoy another resurgence of interest towards the end of the 1980s and in the 1990s. Annual blues festivals were established, including The Great British Rhythm and Blues Festival, held at Colne in Lancashire from 1989, which hosts both US and British R acts. In 1994 Jools Holland, former keyboard player with Squeeze and presenter of the highly influential TV show Later..., reshaped his backing band as Jools Holland's Rhythm and Blues Orchestra and, as well as supporting him on the show, they embarked on a series of tours. After leaving the Rolling Stones in 1997 Bill Wyman formed the Rhythm Kings, which featured guitarists Peter Frampton and Albert Lee as well former Procol Harum keyboardist Gary Brooker, touring and producing a series of R based albums. By 2000 the <b>fanzine</b> Blues Matters! had managed to become a regular glossy magazine.|$|E
5|$|On 9 September 2013 in the UK (and a {{day later}} in the US), the Clash {{released}} Sound System, a twelve-disc box set featuring their studio albums completely re-mastered on eight discs with an additional three discs featuring demos, non-album singles, rarities and B-sides, a DVD with previously unseen footage by both Don Letts and Julien Temple, original promo videos and live footage, an owner's manual booklet, reprints of the band's original 'Armagideon Times' <b>fanzine</b> {{as well as a}} brand new edition curated and designed by Paul Simonon and merchandise including dog tags, badges, stickers and an exclusive Clash poster. Both Mick Jones and Paul Simonon oversaw the project including the re-masters. The box set came in a package shaped as an 80s ghetto blaster. The box set was accompanied by 5 Album Studio Set, which contains only the first five studio albums (excluding Cut the Crap), and The Clash Hits Back, a 33-track, two-CD best of collection sequenced to copy the set played by the band at the Brixton Fair Deal (now the Academy) on 19 July 1982.|$|E
