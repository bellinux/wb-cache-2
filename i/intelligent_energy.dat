40|$|Among all {{domestic}} appliances populating our homes, {{it seems}} that hobs are not yet enabled with <b>intelligent</b> and <b>energy</b> efficient systems where people still use hobs {{in the same way}} their parents or grandparents did. This work aims to develop autonomous cooking systems which are able to provide a better cooking practice while increasing the energy efficiency of existing hobs. In this paper, we will present fuzzy logic based agents which could be embedded in normal hobs converting them to <b>intelligent</b> and more <b>energy</b> efficient ones. The realised system is able to self-regulate the heating during the most widely used cooking techniques including boiling, deep-frying, stir-frying, warming and melting. The agent is also capable of identifying when the user intervention is needed where the system continuously controls the cooking pot temperature preventing it from reaching unwanted values and detects when a pan boils-dry switching the appliance off immediately. We will present various real world experiments where it will be shown that the developed intelligent hob is capable of performing autonomous cooking to the satisfaction of the human user(s) while providing an energy saving of around 15 - 20 % when compared to the human cooking practice. © 2013 IEEE...|$|R

40|$|Plug-in Electric Vehicles (PEVs) {{provide new}} {{opportunities}} {{to reduce fuel consumption}} and exhaust emission. PEVs need to draw and store energy from an electrical grid to supply propulsive {{energy for the}} vehicle. As a result, {{it is important to know}} when PEVs batteries are available for charging and discharging. Furthermore, battery energy management and control is imperative for PEVs as the vehicle operation and even the safety of passengers depend on the battery system. Thus, scheduling the grid power electricity with parking lots would be needed for efficient charging and discharging of PEV batteries. This paper aims to propose a new <b>intelligent</b> battery <b>energy</b> management and control scheduling service charging that utilize Cloud computing networks. The proposed intelligent vehicle-to-grid scheduling service offers the computational scalability required to make decisions necessary to allow PEVs battery energy management systems to operate efficiently when the number of PEVs and charging devices are large. Experimental analyses of the proposed scheduling service as compared to a traditional scheduling service are conducted through simulations. The results show that the proposed <b>intelligent</b> battery <b>energy</b> management scheduling service substantially reduces the required number of interactions of PEV with parking lots and grid as well as predicting the load demand calculated in advance with regards to their limitations. Also it shows that the intelligent scheduling service charging using Cloud computing network is more efficient than the traditional scheduling service network for battery energy management and control...|$|R
