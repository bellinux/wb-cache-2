In 2007 Pétrus was awarded its second Michelin star.|$|E

Another Riskbreaker, Rosencrantz, appears during Ashley's battles in Leá Monde, briefing him on the plans of the VKP, Sydney and the Cardinal, and subsequently <b>his</b> <b>take</b> <b>on</b> Ashley's past.

5|$|Caion {{was still}} {{carrying}} on as a publicist and historian, with a study about the ancient Bacchanalia. It was simultaneously published in Paris and Bucharest (1901). That year, with Carol Göbl press, he also published a devotional text, Isus, fragment ("Jesus, A Fragment"). The theme of decadence continued to fuel Caion's essays: in Carmen magazine (September 1902), he covered Castanier's Lotus du Gange, implicitly advertising the book's lewd content and titillating illustrations. <b>His</b> <b>take</b> <b>on</b> the Caragiale affair was {{outlined in the}} Carol Göbl essay Moravuri literare în 1902 ("Literary Morals as of 1902").|$|E
5|$|Irish writer Garth Ennis {{then took}} over the title in 1991, again from 2000 AD, {{where he had been}} working on Judge Dredd. He {{proceeded}} to write the longest run for any writer on the title. <b>His</b> <b>take</b> <b>on</b> the title was more personal than Jamie Delano's, with John's relationships coming to the fore. It also had a strong religious theme, with John's dealings with the First of the Fallen, and some storylines, such as the relationship between an angel, Tali, and a succubus demon, Ellie, would go on to be used again as a major plot device in Preacher, one of his most popular works. He also references the music of The Pogues and the poetry of Brendan Behan, both of these being relevant to Ennis' Irish heritage.|$|E
5|$|The {{restaurant}} was {{moved into the}} Berkeley Hotel in 2003 where it replaced Pierre Koffmann's La Tante Claire, {{in the same year}} that Wareing became Chef Patron of the Grill Room at the Savoy Hotel, and he was named Chef of the Year by Caterer and Hotelkeepers Catey Awards. The return to the Savoy meant that he was competing against Anton Edelmann, his former boss from the River Room at the hotel. Rather than serve a menu similar to the French driven Pétrus, Wareing chose to continue to serve the British cuisine that the Grill Room was known for, including <b>his</b> <b>take</b> <b>on</b> previous menu items such as steak and kidney pudding and potted shrimps. Pétrus went on to be awarded two Michelin stars and five AA Rosettes, while the Savoy Grill achieved its first Michelin star in the hotel's history in 2004.|$|E

25|$|The four-act tragicomedy Le Fou? {{is seen by}} Vianu as {{comparable}} in subject matter and depth to Enrico IV, a celebrated 1922 play by Luigi Pirandello. The plot reflects Macedonski's confrontation with his critics, and his acceptance {{of the fact that}} people saw in him an eccentric. The central figure is a banker, Dorval, who identifies himself with Napoleon Bonaparte {{to the point where he}} sees episodes in his biography as mirrors of early 19th-century battles. Unlike patients with dissociative identity disorder, Dorval does not actually imagine his life has become Napoleon's, but rather joins with him on an intellectual level. Witnesses of this disorder are divided into family, who seek to have Dorval committed, and close friends, who come to see <b>his</b> <b>take</b> <b>on</b> life as a manifestation of genius. The spectator is led to believe that the latter interpretation is the correct one. At a larger level, Vianu indicates, the play is also Macedonski's critique of capitalism, and, using Parisian argot, makes allusive references to famous people of the day.|$|E

500|$|Shane Black {{described}} <b>his</b> <b>take</b> <b>on</b> {{the film}} as not being [...] "two men in iron suits fighting each other," [...] {{and more like a}} [...] "Tom Clancy thriller," [...] with Iron Man fighting real-world type villains. Drew Pearce added that they would avert magic and space, with Iron Man 3 being [...] "a techno-thriller set in a more real world than even The Avengers." [...] The duo spent some time discussing themes and images and ideas before starting the script. While writing, the focus was to avoid scenes of pure exposition, making every moment propel other narrative points forwards. Some elements from the comics were used even if in different connotations, such as making Rhodes wear Norman Osborn's Iron Patriot armor, and naming some characters with names from unrelated people in the Marvel Universe, such as Eric Savin and Jack Taggart.|$|E
500|$|AllMusic editor Janet Rosen gave Romance {{three stars}} out of five, {{saying that it}} [...] "features the usual smooth, well-crafted pop ear candy from Luis Miguel, earnestly sung over strings and polite Latin rhythms". However, she noted that the songs in the album booklet {{and the lack of}} liner notes made it {{difficult}} for listeners to know what [...] "to make of this presentation". Rosen concluded, [...] "It doesn't matter—the title of the release says it all." [...] Achy Obejas of the Chicago Tribune gave the record four stars out of four, praising Miguel's refusal [...] "to get campy, which gives the effort far more integrity than might have been imagined" [...] and calling <b>his</b> <b>take</b> <b>on</b> boleros [...] "vibrant and real." [...] Mark Holston reviewed the album positively in the magazine Américas, praising Miguel's vocals, the choice of songs and Silvetti's arrangements: [...] "Romance is a reminder of the enduring quality of timeless music".|$|E
