5|$|The first {{landmark}} as {{the highway}} approaches downtown Mackinac Island is the island's public school building. As it passes the island's public library on the shoreline {{side of the}} street, Main Street makes a sweeping curve to the north at Windermere, or Biddle's, Point to run through the downtown district. Other than the library, most of the city's public buildings are actually situated along Market Street, one block behind Main Street. Three streets and a city park allow for connections between Main and Market streets. M-185 through downtown Mackinac Island passes through the major business district, featuring dozens of shops, restaurants and lodging establishments; nearly a dozen of these outlets feature the authentic Mackinac Island <b>fudge</b> made fresh daily during tourist season. The passenger ferry docks are all situated along Main Street in the downtown area. At the northeastern end of the downtown district, Main Street intersects Fort Street at the state park visitor center to complete its circuit of Mackinac Island.|$|E

2500|$|Furthermore, the {{government}} {{gives the impression}} of (at various times) either incompetence or malice.

Due to lax security, a group of Hogwarts students, as well as Voldemort, a dozen Death Eaters, and the Order of the Phoenix, all of whom were wanted by {{the government}}, are able to enter the department on a whim and without provoking any response whatsoever, even signing in as a [...] "rescue mission" [...] without attracting attention. However, these events occur under Cornelius <b>Fudge's</b> reign, a Minister who is renowned in the books as incompetent. <b>Fudge's</b> resignation in the next book is a direct result of these events.|$|R
