25|$|A {{substantial}} {{percentage of}} the US homeless population are individuals who are chronically unemployed or have difficulty managing their lives effectively due to prolonged and severe drug and/or alcohol abuse. Substance abuse can cause homelessness from behavioral patterns associated with addiction that alienate an addicted individual's family and friends who could otherwise provide support during difficult economic times. Increased wealth disparity and income inequality causes distortions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>housing</b> <b>market</b> that push rent burdens higher, making housing unaffordable. Dr. Paul Koegel of RAND Corporation, a seminal researcher in first generation homelessness studies and beyond, divided the causes of homelessness into structural aspects and then individual vulnerabilities.|$|E

40|$|Research {{on social}} {{exclusion}} {{has focused on}} the labour markets and on social networks. Relatively little is yet known about social exclusion <b>in</b> <b>the</b> realm of <b>housing.</b> Valuable empirical studies on homelessness and on extreme manifestations of socio-spatial segregation put the emphasis on the results of processes of social exclusion <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>housing</b> <b>markets.</b> By contrast, research has seldom analysed the process of social exclusion itself, in particular in a comparative perspective. Such an approach would require <b>the</b> analysis of <b>housing</b> biographies that are defined as the sequence of dwellings a household occupies during life. Consequently, HASEC defines social exclusion <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>housing</b> <b>markets</b> as a procedural phenomenon. We examine housing biographies of individuals and evaluate the direction of their development. Exclusion <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>housing</b> <b>markets</b> is thus understood as a process of deterioration of <b>the</b> <b>housing</b> conditions (<b>in</b> terms of dwelling size, housing quality, neighbourhood conditions) during housing biographies. Furthermore, exclusion is structured, since <b>the</b> direction of <b>housing</b> biographies depends on the interference of macrostructural and individual factors.

The theory was first developed by Professor John Baugh to explain discriminatory practices <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>housing</b> <b>market</b> based on the auditory redlining of prospective clientele by housing administrators. Linguistic profiling extends to issues of legal proceedings, employment opportunities, and education. The theory is frequently described as the auditory equivalent of racial profiling.

25|$|Compared {{to rural}} parts of California, living in Milpitas is more expensive, {{as it is}} {{throughout}} Silicon Valley. Compared to other South Bay bedroom communities Milpitas is considered affordable. For example, a regular one-story, detached single-family home with a 1,300-square-foot (140 m²) size sells for between $600,000 to $700,000 in the city. These prices are slightly more affordable {{than the rest of}} the San Francisco Bay Area, as a similar sized house may cost well over a million dollars in more affluent cities such as Palo Alto, Cupertino or Saratoga. Reasons for the expensive housing in the South Bay Area include the regional high tech industries, mild climate, strong foreign investment in the West Coast's housing, and a huge demand for limited homes. With the decline <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>housing</b> <b>market,</b> however, median sales prices in Milpitas have declined from nearly $700,000 to less than $500,000, and single-family new house construction building permits have plummeted from a 2004 average price of $949,900 to $269,400 in 2007.|$|E

500|$|The {{issue of}} local {{historic}} districts {{and the impact}} on property values is a concern to many homeowners. The effects have been extensively studied using multiple methodologies including before-and-after analysis and evaluating comparable neighborhoods with and without local designation status. [...] Recent factual analysis has been conducted by independent researchers {{in a number of}} states, including New Jersey, Texas, Indiana, Georgia, Colorado, Maryland, North and South Carolina, Kentucky, Virginia, and elsewhere. As stated by economist Donovan Rypkema, [...] "the results of these studies are remarkably consistent: property values in local historic districts appreciate significantly faster than the market as a whole {{in the vast majority of}} cases and appreciate at rates equivalent to the market in the worst case. Simply put – historic districts enhance property values." [...] In a 2011 study Connecticut Local Historic Districts and Property Values, it was found that [...] "property values in every local historic district saw average increases in value ranging from 4% to over 19% per year." [...] Similarly, in New York City between 1980 and 2000, local historic district properties on a price per square foot basis increased in value significantly more than non-designated properties. [...] Equally important, local historic district property values were found to resist market downturns better than historic non-designated properties. [...] A recent study investigating the data on single-family residential mortgage foreclosures and comparable non-designated neighborhoods found that designated properties were significantly less likely to experience foreclosure. Local historic district designation has proven to protect property values from wild fluctuations and provides stability <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>housing</b> <b>market.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Insufficient {{financial}} resources [...] {{and lack of}} coordination in government bureaucracy [...] are two main causes of poor house planning. Financial deficiency in some governments may explain the lack of [...] affordable public housing for the poor since any improvement of the tenant in slums and expansion of public housing programs involve a great increase in the government expenditure. The problem can also lie on the failure in coordination among different departments in charge of economic development, urban planning, and land allocation. In some cities, governments assume that the housing market will adjust the supply of housing with a change in demand. However, with little economic incentive, the housing market {{is more likely to}} develop middle-income housing rather than low-cost housing.
