5|$|As Mormonism gained {{popularity}} in the Pacific, church-sponsored schools became more common. The Makeke School, founded by Coombs in the 1920s, became {{the foundation for the}} later established Liahona College. The church leased 276 acres near Nuku'alofa. The Liahona School opened in 1952 and led to a great expansion of the church. The Liahona School was intended to allow for more students with more hired faculty members and a broader curriculum. The education provided to Tongan students prepared them for life outside of Tonga, whether it was pursuing a secondary education or a job <b>in</b> <b>America.</b> <b>Today,</b> the school is known as Liahona High School.|$|E

The design source for the Hammond-Harwood House is Villa Pisani at Montagnana (Book II, Chapter XIV), {{and for the first}} Monticello (1770) the design source is Villa Cornaro at Piombino Dese (Book II, Chapter XIV). Thomas Jefferson later covered this façade with additions so that the Hammond-Harwood House remains the only pure and pristine example of direct modeling <b>in</b> <b>America</b> <b>today.</b>|$|E

500|$|The {{politician}} and architect Thomas Jefferson (1743–1826) once referred to Palladio's [...] Quattro Libri as his bible. Jefferson acquired an intense appreciation of Palladio's architectural concepts, and his designs {{for his own}} beloved Monticello, the James Barbour Barboursville estate, Virginia State Capitol, and the University of Virginia were based on drawings from Palladio's book. Realizing the powerful political significance pertaining to ancient Roman buildings, Jefferson designed his civic buildings in the Palladian style. Monticello (remodelled between 1796 and 1808) is quite clearly based on Palladio's Villa Capra, however, with modifications, in a style which is described <b>in</b> <b>America</b> <b>today</b> as Colonial Georgian. Jefferson's Pantheon, or Rotunda, at the University of Virginia is undeniably Palladian in concept and style.|$|E
500|$|Psycho {{has been}} rated and re-rated {{several times over}} the years by the MPAA. Upon its initial release, the film {{received}} a certificate stating that it was [...] "Approved" [...] (certificate #19564) under the simple pass/fail system of the Production Code in use at that time. Later, when the MPAA switched to a voluntary letter ratings system in 1968, Psycho was {{one of a number of}} high-profile motion pictures to be retro-rated with an [...] "M" [...] (Mature Audiences). This remained the only rating the film would receive for 16 years, and according to the guidelines of the time [...] "M" [...] was the equivalent of a [...] "PG" [...] rating. Then, in 1984, during the uproar of increased parental concern regarding violence in [...] "PG" [...] films, Psycho was retro-rated again to its current rating of [...] "R".

Immortalized in the 1970 documentary film, Woodstock, his guitar-driven version would {{become part of the}} sixties Zeitgeist. Pop critic Al Aronowitz of the New York Post wrote: [...] "It was the most electrifying moment of Woodstock, and it was probably the single greatest moment of the sixties." [...] Images of the performance showing Hendrix wearing a blue-beaded white leather jacket with fringe, a red head-scarf, and blue jeans are widely regarded as iconic pictures that capture a defining moment of the era. He played [...] "Hey Joe" [...] during the encore, concluding the 3½-day festival. Upon leaving the stage, he collapsed from exhaustion.

2500|$|Critics of DeLillo {{argue that}} his novels are overly stylized and intellectually shallow. In James Wood's review of Zadie Smith's 2000 novel White Teeth, he {{dismissed}} {{the work of}} authors like Dellilo, Wallace, and Smith as [...] "hysterical realism". Bruce Bawer famously condemned DeLillo's novels insisting they weren't actually novels at all but [...] "tracts, designed to batter us, again and again, with a single idea: that life <b>in</b> <b>America</b> <b>today</b> is boring, benumbing, dehumanized...It's better, DeLillo seems to say in one novel after another, to be a marauding murderous maniac – and therefore a human – than to sit still for America as it is, with its air conditioners, assembly lines, television sets, supermarkets, synthetic fabrics, and credit cards." [...] George Will proclaimed the study of Lee Harvey Oswald in Libra as [...] "sandbox existentialism" [...] and [...] "an act of literary vandalism and bad citizenship." [...] DeLillo responded [...] "I don't take it seriously, but being called a 'bad citizen' is a compliment to a novelist, at least to my mind. That's exactly {{what we ought to}} do. We ought to be bad citizens. We ought to, in the sense that we're writing against what power represents, and often what government represents, and what the corporation dictates, and what consumer consciousness has come to mean. In that sense, if we're bad citizens, we're doing our job." [...] In the same interview DeLillo rejected Will's claim that DeLillo blames America for Lee Harvey Oswald, countering that he instead blamed America for George Will. DeLillo also figured prominently in B. R. Myers's critique of recent American literary fiction, A Reader's Manifesto.|$|E
