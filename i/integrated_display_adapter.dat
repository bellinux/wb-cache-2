From the model 5550-S released in 1988, the <b>Display</b> <b>Adapter</b> II {{was installed}} that had been resolved PS/2 compatibility. In the boot sequence, <b>display</b> <b>adapter</b> enabled VGA on the motherboard and the video signal was output through MCA connector and <b>display</b> <b>adapter.</b> When using Japanese DOS, VGA was disabled and <b>display</b> <b>adapter</b> switched the video signal from VGA to own graphics chip. In addition, 256 color mode (1024x768 pixels in 256 of 262,144 colors) was supported.|$|R

50|$|Advanced file {{managers}} for MS-DOS {{were able}} to redefine character shapes with EGA and better <b>display</b> <b>adapters,</b> giving some basic low resolution icons and graphical interface elements, including an arrow (instead of a coloured cell block) for the mouse pointer. When the <b>display</b> <b>adapter</b> lacks the ability to change the character's shapes, they default to the CP437 character set found in the adapter's ROM. Some popular utility suites for MS-DOS, as Norton Utilities (pictured) and PC Tools used these techniques as well.|$|R
5000|$|Microsoft also {{produces}} and sells mice, keyboards, webcams, headsets, game controllers and wireless <b>display</b> <b>adapters.</b> The production of these accessories is outsourced in most cases.|$|R
50|$|Various {{computer}} {{display standards}} or display modes {{have been used}} {{in the history of the}} personal computer. They are often a combination of aspect ratio (specified as width-to-height ratio), display resolution (specified as the width and height in pixels), color depth (measured in bits per pixel), and refresh rate (expressed in hertz). Associated with the screen resolution and refresh rate is a <b>display</b> <b>adapter.</b> Earlier <b>display</b> <b>adapters</b> were simple frame-buffers, but later display standards also specified a more extensive set of display functions and software controlled interface.|$|R
5000|$|In North American IBM-compatible PCs, the {{hardware}} code {{page of the}} <b>display</b> <b>adapter</b> is typically code page 437. However, various portable machines as well as (Eastern) European, Arabic, Middle Eastern and Asian PCs used {{a number of other}} code pages as their hardware code page, including code page 100 ("Hebrew"), 151 ("Nafitha Arabic"), 667 ("Mazovia"), 737 ("Greek"), 850 ("Multilingual"), encodings like [...] "Roman-8", [...] "Kamenický", [...] "KOI-8", [...] "MIK", and others. Most <b>display</b> <b>adapters</b> support a single 8-bit hardware code page only. The bitmaps were often stored in an EPROM in a DIP socket. At most, {{the hardware}} code page to be activated was user-selectable via jumpers, configuration EEPROMs or CMOS setup. However, some of the <b>display</b> <b>adapters</b> designed for Eastern European, Arabic and Hebrew PCs supported multiple software-switchable hardware code pages, also named font pages, selectable via I/O ports or additional BIOS functions.|$|R

5000|$|Simultaneously announced, The Monochrome <b>Display</b> and Printer <b>Adapter</b> (MDPA), often {{shortened}} to Monochrome <b>Display</b> <b>Adapter</b> (MDA), {{which did}} not support pixel-addressable graphics of any sort, offered a high-quality 80x25 character mode, having a relatively high pixel-resolution of 720x350 (character box size 9x14), {{that could be used}} on a monochrome monitor (originally, specifically the IBM 5151 Personal Computer Display).|$|R

5000|$|EPICenter's {{first two}} cards, the VDA (video <b>display</b> <b>adapter)</b> and ICB (image capture board), used the first incarnations of the TGA file format. The file {{extensions}} [...] ".vda" [...] and [...] ".icb" [...] implied {{information about the}} board specific data contained.|$|R
50|$|For example, the {{monochrome}} video adapter {{memory area}} ran from 704 to 736 KiB (0xB0000-0xB7FFF). If only a monochrome <b>display</b> <b>adapter</b> was used, the address space between 0xA0000 and 0xAFFFF {{could be used}} for RAM, which would be contiguous with the conventional memory.|$|R
50|$|As {{the file}} is {{processed}} during decoding, the child blocks in each parent block are unpacked either into an off-screen buffer if not displaying in native mode, or {{directly into the}} <b>display</b> <b>adapter</b> if in native mode (which results in quicker unpacking).|$|R
50|$|Software making {{extensive}} use of special hardware devices, like high-end <b>display</b> <b>adapters,</b> needs special API or newer device drivers. A good example is DirectX, which {{is a collection of}} APIs for handling tasks related to multimedia, especially game programming, on Microsoft platforms.|$|R
50|$|The Monochrome <b>Display</b> <b>Adapter</b> (MDA, also MDA card, Monochrome <b>Display</b> and Printer <b>Adapter,</b> MDPA) is IBM's {{standard}} {{video display}} card and computer display {{standard for the}} PC introduced in 1981. The MDA {{does not have any}} pixel-addressable graphics modes. It has only a single monochrome text mode (PC video mode 7), which can display 80 columns by 25 lines of high resolution text characters or symbols useful for drawing forms.|$|R
50|$|A 32-bit {{application}} can {{be given}} a full 4 gigabytes of virtual memory on a 64-bit system, whereas on a 32-bit system, some of this addressable memory is lost because it {{is used by the}} kernel and memory-mapped peripherals such as the <b>display</b> <b>adapter.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{tenure of}} MCGA was brief; the PS/2 Model 25 and Model 30 were {{discontinued}} by 1992, and no manufacturer produced a clone of this <b>display</b> <b>adapter</b> except for Epson Equity Ie, since the VGA standard introduced {{at the same}} time was considered superior.|$|R
5000|$|IBM {{recognized}} {{soon after}} the IBM PC's release in 1981 that its five 8-bit [...] "I/O channel" [...] expansion slots (later named Industry Standard Architecture (ISA) by IBM's competitors) were insufficient. An internal IBM publication stated in October 1981 about the number that [...] "In my opinion, {{it could be a}} problem", reporting that others within IBM advised swapping cards if necessary. Virtually every PC required at least a <b>display</b> <b>adapter</b> card and a floppy disk controller card, leaving only three slots available for a parallel printer port card (if the Color Graphics Adapter was used), a serial port card, memory expansion boards, a 3rd-party hard disk controller card, a second <b>display</b> <b>adapter</b> card, or possible other special adapter cards.|$|R
50|$|The MCGA {{supports}} all CGA display modes plus 640×480 monochrome at {{a refresh}} rate of 60 Hz, and 320×200 with 256 colors (out of {{a palette of}} 262,144) at 70 Hz. The <b>display</b> <b>adapter</b> uses a DE-15 connector. The MDA monochrome text mode is not supported.|$|R
50|$|Notably, the <b>display</b> <b>adapters</b> {{of early}} {{personal}} computers stored tables of bitmapped font characters in ROM. This usually {{meant that the}} text display font could not be changed interactively. This {{was the case for}} both the CGA and MDA adapters available with the IBM PC XT.|$|R
5000|$|Modern <b>display</b> <b>adapters</b> have {{dedicated}} calibrating CLUTs, {{which can}} be loaded once with the appropriate gamma-correction look-up table in order to modify the encoded signals digitally before the DACs that output voltages to the monitor. Setting up these tables to be correct is called hardware calibration.|$|R
50|$|All IBM {{personal}} computers are software backwards-compatible {{with each other}} in general, but not every program will work in every machine. Some programs are time sensitive to a particular speed class. Older programs will not take advantage of newer higher-resolution and higher-color display standards, while some newer programs require newer <b>display</b> <b>adapters.</b> (Note that as the <b>display</b> <b>adapter</b> was an adapter card in all of these IBM models, newer display hardware could easily be, and often was, retrofitted to older models.) A few programs, typically very early ones, are written for and require a specific version of the IBM PC BIOS ROM. Most notably, BASICA which was dependent on the BIOS ROM had a sister program called GW-BASIC which supported more functions, was 100% backwards compatible and could run independently from the BIOS ROM.|$|R
40|$|Graphical <b>Display</b> <b>Adapter</b> {{provides}} a real time display for digital computerized experiments. This display uses a memory oscilloscope which records a single trace until erased. It {{is a small}} hardware unit which interfaces with the J-box feature of the SDS- 930 computer to either an X-Y plotter or a memory oscilloscope...|$|R
50|$|The Z-100 had unusually good {{graphics}} for its era, {{superior to}} the contemporary CGA (640×200 monochrome bitmap or 320×200 4-color), IBM Monochrome <b>Display</b> <b>Adapter</b> (MDA) (80×25 text-only), and arguably even the Hercules Graphics Card (720×348 monochrome). Early versions of AutoCAD were released for the Z-100 because of these advanced graphics.|$|R
