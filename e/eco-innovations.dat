5000|$|Literature in {{the field}} of <b>eco-innovations</b> often focuses on policy, regulations, technology, market and firm {{specific}} factors rather than diffusion. However, understanding of diffusion of <b>eco-innovations</b> recently has gained more importance given the fact that some <b>eco-innovations</b> are already at a mature stage. Survey research shows that most customers hold positive attitudes towards various types of <b>eco-innovations.</b> At the same time, adoption rates of solutions such as dynamic electricity tariffs remain unsatisfactorily low. The [...] "Not In My Back Yard" [...] (NIMBY) concept is often used to describe what at first seems to be a confusing intention-behavior gap between high levels of public support for <b>eco-innovations</b> and frequent non-engagement or even local hostility towards specific project proposals. Social psychology and economic behavior models could and should be used to overcome these challenges.|$|E

States and firms established and implemented policies and strategies for <b>eco-innovation</b> as one route to achieving sustainable development. <b>Eco-innovation</b> has been facilitated in developed countries, specifically OECD members and European countries, through action plans. Recently, <b>eco-innovation</b> policies have emerged in developing countries. Thus, this study analyzes <b>eco-innovation</b> policies in Asian countries. Policies related to <b>eco-innovation</b> in 17 Asian countries were investigated using policy instrument categories. National policies for <b>eco-innovation</b> were interpreted and compared with development stage classifications. The results indicate that there are similar and different policy approaches to <b>eco-innovation</b> in Asian countries. Given the balance between a technology push (supply side) and a market pull (demand side) in policy instruments for <b>eco-innovation,</b> 17 countries were identified by four categories: leaders, followers, loungers, and laggards. The results provide insight for designing national strategies for <b>eco-innovation</b> in Asia’s developing countries. Therefore, this research contributes to facilitating and diffusing <b>eco-innovation</b> toward sustainability in Asia...|$|R
40|$|This study {{seeks to}} {{elucidate}} the drivers of and barriers to <b>eco-innovation</b> deployment. In {{order to obtain}} greater insight into the motives for and hindrances to <b>eco-innovation</b> deployment, we employ a case study approach, based on interviews of five Slovenian companies active in <b>eco-innovation.</b> The main insights {{of this study are}} threefold. First, companies seem to be influenced by both internal and external drivers in implementing <b>eco-innovation.</b> Among the internal drivers, the most emphasis has been placed on environmental concerns and cost reduction, while the most important external drivers are customer pressure, competition and regulatory pressure. Second, barriers to <b>eco-innovation</b> also derive from external and internal pressures. Costs (upfront investment for <b>eco-innovation</b> implementation) prevail within the internal barriers, while legislation seems to be the most commonly experienced external barrier. Finally, the outcomes of <b>eco-innovation</b> that companies most often expect are reduction in costs and compliance with legislation, which is coherent with reported outcomes. <b>eco-innovation</b> barriers; case study; <b>eco-innovation</b> drivers; <b>eco-innovation</b> outcomes; external pressures; internal pressures; Slovenia; environmental concerns; cost reduction; customer pressure; competition; regulatory pressure; costs; legislation...|$|R

5000|$|Another {{position}} held (for example, by {{the organisation}} Eco Innovation) {{is that this}} definition should be complemented: <b>eco-innovations</b> should also bring greater social and cultural acceptance. In this view, this [...] "social pillar" [...] added to James's definition is necessary because it determines learning {{and the effectiveness of}} <b>eco-innovations.</b> This approach gives <b>eco-innovations</b> a social component, a status that is more than a new type of commodity, or a new sector, even though environmental technology and eco-innovation are associated with the emergence of new economic activities or even branches (e.g., waste treatment, recycling, etc.). This approach considers eco-innovation in terms of usage rather than merely in terms of product. The social pillar associated with eco-innovation introduces a governance component that makes eco-innovation a more integrated tool for sustainable development.|$|E

In this context, this paper aims to evaluate Romanian <b>eco-innovation</b> performance during the period 2003 – 2013 by constructing a composite index and to also identify the main <b>eco-innovation</b> poles at the European level using multidimensional analysis techniques based on the <b>eco-innovation</b> specific indicators for the year 2013. This approach used the methodology of constructing composite indices proposed by Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) in 2008. The index measured the <b>eco-innovation</b> dimensions in 27 countries over the period 2003 – 2013. The empirical analysis revealed the conclusion that in Romania, the <b>eco-innovation</b> level is low compared with other countries, thus Romania cannot emphasize its <b>eco-innovation</b> performance. The empirical results of the study highlighted that <b>eco-innovation</b> represents a phenomenon leading to significant progress in achieving the objective of sustainable development in Romania, and also at the European level, only if the importance of this area is awarded and <b>eco-innovation</b> measures are enforced through adequate policies, leading to economic growth...|$|R

As a solution, <b>eco-innovation</b> has received {{a great amount of}} attention from European countries and as a result, many efforts to analyze the development of <b>eco-innovation</b> quantitatively have been made. This study aims to evaluate the validity of an <b>eco-innovation</b> index developed to support the sustainable development goal. For this purpose, four factors of eco-innovation—capacity, supportive environment, activity, and performance—were applied to three categories of the Triple-Bottom-Line (TBL) concept in sustainability to compare the <b>eco-innovation</b> development level of 49 Asia-Europe Meeting countries. Factors for <b>eco-innovation</b> and TBL at the country level were organized in quartile and compared to see strength and weaknesses for each nation. In order to test if <b>eco-innovation</b> factors of a nation adequately reflect its sustainability, we used various comparisons of ANOVA. The results of this study are as follows: First, the one-way ANOVA tests present the scores for capacity, supportive environment, and performance as grouped into four quartiles in the same pattern as their economic, social, and environmental scores. The three-way ANOVA tests showed significance for the economic category. Scores for capacity, supportive environment, activity and performance were significant at a nation’s economic level. Lastly, the MANOVA test revealed that TBL significantly explains four <b>eco-innovation</b> factors. In addition, the <b>eco-innovation</b> performance level of European nations and Asian nations were compared. The possibility that many nations still have room to be competitive in their <b>eco-innovation</b> efforts was identified.

40|$|Abstract Purpose - Recent OECD (2010, 2011) reports {{argue that}} <b>eco-innovation</b> {{is the key}} to {{realising}} growth. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to analyse the drivers of <b>eco-innovation</b> and to compare the impact of <b>eco-innovation</b> and non-eco-innovation on firm performance. The paper provides insights into the role government regulation can play in directing and stimulating <b>eco-innovation.</b> Design/methodology/approach - The approach utilised by this paper is empirical in nature. A modified innovation production function is used to assess the impact of regulation, consumer expectations and voluntary agreements on the performance of <b>eco-innovation</b> while a knowledge augmented production function is used to assess the impact of <b>eco-innovation</b> on firm performance. Findings - The findings suggest that regulation and customer perception can explain a firm‟s decision to engage in <b>eco-innovation.</b> <b>Eco-innovation</b> is also found to be more important than non-eco-innovation in determining firm performance. Research limitations/implications - Due to the limited availability of accounting data this paper uses turnover per worker as the measure of firm performance. As a result it is not possible to assess the impact of <b>eco-innovation</b> on firm costs. Social implications - The finding that regulation drives <b>eco-innovation</b> and that there is no trade-off between the optimal outcomes of lower levels of pollution for society and higher profit margins for businesses suggests that regulators and policy makers can stimulate growth and create a greener society.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to define to which extent <b>eco-innovation</b> is {{implemented}} in the strategies of Nordic cleantech companies and to determine the main drivers for ecoinnovation in this sector. <b>Eco-innovation</b> is a rather new field and most of the research on this subject originates from the book “Driving <b>Eco-Innovation</b> - A breakthrough discipline for innovation and sustainability” published by Fussler and James in 1996. <b>Eco-innovation</b> has been researched through case studies in large and small sized companies (E. Jones, 2001; Popoff & DeSimone 1997 et al.), but not in cleantech companies. My purpose was to study how the concept of <b>eco-innovation</b> is perceived in companies producing clean technology by conducting ten focused interviews with Nordic cleantech companies chosen from the Nordic Cleantech 50 list. The results of the interviews show that the Nordic cleantech companies interviewed for this study have insufficient knowledge of <b>eco-innovation.</b> None of the companies confirmed consciously implementing <b>eco-innovation</b> in their strategies. The study suggests that the drivers for <b>eco-innovation</b> listed by the interviewees, including the end-user perspective, are somewhat similar to the drivers for broader innovation. The only driver which is specifically typical for <b>eco-innovation,</b> is the goal to save the planet and to play a part in the pollution reduction process. The regulations were not considered as an essential barrier for <b>eco-innovation,</b> rather as a framework which ensured a healthy competition environment. In order to remain competitive in the global market, Nordic cleantech companies should implement sustainability in the entire value chain of their products. </p...|$|R

This {{initiative}} is a follow up on the concept of Integral Innovation (Al-Jayyousi, 2017). It aspires to deepen and broaden the perspectives of innovation based on case studies and experiences of thinkers and experts from all domains of knowledge. These case studies may cover many dimensions of innovation including innovative universities, firms, individuals, initiatives, and nations.Innovation is underpinned by culture and ecology which is beyond economics and business models. This knowledge-based initiative is intended to present a holistic view for innovation with a focus on ecology and society. It is simply about integral innovation that includes Individual, Community (or city), Organization and National (ICON) innovation as the domain of action and reflection. In terms of theory and practice, I looked at other four dimensions. These include: Cultural (or social), Ecological, Technological and Economic (CETE) innovation (Al-Jayyousi, 2017). The Objectives of this Wilkipedia/Wikimedia (in both languages Arabic and English) are outlined below:• Articulate and frame a new discourse on the drivers and enablers for innovation and renewal for higher education to support AGU as a model for an innovative university.• Seek inspiration form culture and local knowledge for new models of social and <b>eco-innovations</b> to develop an innovative university in GCC and MENA region.• Document case studies on the role of innovation in social renewal and transformation.• Reflect of global experiences and practices of innovation in higher education and private and public sectors.|$|E

40|$|Measuring <b>eco-innovation</b> {{helps us}} {{understand}} the overall trends and raises awareness in society. Measuring <b>eco-innovation</b> {{at the national level}} and making comparisons across countries may allow us to benchmark performance and foster policy learning. This paper assesses two indices developed in two different regions: The ASEM <b>Eco-Innovation</b> Index (ASEI) by the ASEM SMEs <b>Eco-Innovation</b> Center, based in Republic of Korea; and the <b>Eco-Innovation</b> Scoreboard (Eco-IS) developed by the <b>Eco-Innovation</b> Observatory, based in the European Union. This paper aims to examine and compare the features of both and attempts to obtain insights on their strengths and weaknesses. Towards this aim, our paper assesses those scoreboards against four criteria stemming from innovation analysis: (1) relevance of areas and stakeholders covered; (2) ability to indicate changes; (3) directions towards common goals; and (4) ability to facilitate further changes. We conclude both are promising, despite data shortages, and have great potential to contribute towards the sustainable development goals (SDGs), particularly with regard to the SDGs on sustainable industrialization and sustainable consumption and production. In comparison, the ASEI covers more countries than the Eco-IS. However, the ASEI has limitations on measuring indicators due to limited data availability in Asian countries. The Eco-IS is closely linked with the regional and national policies for <b>eco-innovation</b> in Europe, while the ASEI’s impact appears more limited, as of now. In conclusion, the research results give insights into key areas, goals and applications of <b>eco-innovation</b> indices, and can help upgrading <b>eco-innovation</b> indices. This research helps interpret the scores of two indices better and facilitate application of the scores in the multiple ways. It is expected that this research contributes to developing and modifying a global <b>eco-innovation</b> index and enhancing the ability of these indices to facilitate <b>eco-innovation</b> strategies at national levels and across relevant actors...|$|R

This paper brings together the views of these different disciplines and provides empirical insights on the drivers of <b>eco-innovations</b> based on a novel dataset of 1566 UK firms that responded to the Government Survey of Environmental Protection Expenditure by Industry in 2006.

The importance of regions as a level for integrating eco-innovative programs and activities served as the point of interest for this study. Eco-innovative activities and technologies are seen as means to meet sustainable development objective of improving regions’ quality of life. This study is conducted to get an in-depth understanding and learning about <b>eco-innovation</b> at regional level, and to know the basic concepts {{that are important in}} integrating <b>eco-innovation</b> principles into regional policy. Other specific objectives of this study are to know how <b>eco-innovation</b> are developed and practiced in the regions of the EU, and to analyze the main characteristic features of an <b>eco-innovation</b> model that is specifically developed at Päijät-Häme Region in Finland. Paijät-Häme Region is noted for its successful <b>eco-innovation</b> strategies and programs, hence, taken as casework in this study. Both primary (interviews) and secondary data (publicly available documents) are utilized in this study. The study shows that <b>eco-innovation</b> {{plays an important role in}} regional strategy as reviewed based on the experience of other regions in the EU. This is because of its localized nature which makes it easier to facilitate in a regional setting. Since regional authorities and policy-makers are normally focused on solving its localized environmental problems, <b>eco-innovation</b> principles can easily be integrated into regional strategy. The case study highlights Päijät-Häme Region’s <b>eco-innovation</b> strategies and projects which are characterized by strong connection of knowledge-producing institutions.
