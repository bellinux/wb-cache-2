50|$|As {{mentioned}} in the previous section, <b>feed</b> <b>flow</b> rate {{is one of the}} crucial parameters to be controlled to achieve high efficient output. Centrifuge performance is sensitive to <b>feed</b> <b>flow</b> rate. Even though increasing the <b>feed</b> <b>flow</b> rate can prevent from blocking the screens, it is mentioned that wetter solids is achieved. This is due to increase in hydraulic load on the centrifuge when higher feed rate is applied, while differential rotation speed between the cone and scroll, and retention time within dewatering zone of the basket are fixed. In addition, higher feed rate leads to a surge in the effective thickness of the bed since it is dragged down by the scroll.|$|E
50|$|According to Ottino and Khakhar, {{increasing}} the <b>feed</b> <b>flow</b> rate of particles {{resulted in a}} decrease in screening efficiency. Not much is known about why this occurs, however, {{it is suggested that}} this effect is influenced by the thickness of filtergranules packed in the trommel body.|$|E
50|$|Evaporation-condensation stages: Stages are {{composed}} of alternative hydrophobic membrane and foil (Polypropylene, PP) frames. Feed (e.g. seawater) is introduced into stage 1 of the module. <b>Feed</b> <b>flows</b> serially through the evaporation-condensation stages. At {{the end of last}} stage, it is ejected as brine.|$|R
30|$|Experiment # 2 : the auto-induction {{strategy}} was employed in this cultivation. Here, induction occurs naturally after glucose exhaustion, as the cells start consuming the lactose {{present in the}} medium. The supplementary medium, containing glycerol and lactose as carbon sources was supplied at an exponential <b>feeding</b> <b>flow</b> rate (Eqs.  1 and 2), assuming a constant μSET = μcrit.|$|R
30|$|The highest {{recovery}} {{can observe}} when deck tilt angle was 12 o, <b>feed</b> water <b>flow</b> rate and wash {{water flow rate}} were 12 (L/min) (Table  4). Therefore, the following points were selected as the optimal values: deck tilt angle 12 o, <b>feed</b> water <b>flow</b> rate and wash water flow rate 12 (L/min) and size fraction −  5  +  2  mm.|$|R
50|$|At higher <b>feed</b> <b>flow</b> rates, smaller-sized {{particles}} at {{the lower}} layer of the packed bed are able to be screened at designated apertures and remaining small-sized particles adhere to larger particles. On the other hand, {{it is easier for}} smaller-sized particles to pass through the granules thickness in the trommel system at lower feed rates.|$|E
50|$|Fruit juices are {{condensed}} by evaporation for storage, {{transport and}} commercial use. If fruit juices {{are exposed to}} heat, the nutrient content such as vitamin C may be affected. Furthermore, these nutrients are easily oxidized at high temperature. The evaporator can overcome this constraint as it operates at high <b>feed</b> <b>flow</b> rate and small temperature difference. In addition, the change in color and texture of the juices can be prevented via the operation of this evaporator type.|$|E
50|$|One {{application}} in which pressure exchangers {{are widely used}} is reverse osmosis (RO). In an RO system, pressure exchangers are used as energy recovery devices (ERDs). As illustrated, high-pressure concentrate from the membranes C is directed 3 to the ERD D. The ERD uses this high-pressure concentrate stream to pressurize the low-pressure seawater stream (stream 1 becomes stream 4), which it then merges (with {{the aid of a}} circulation pump B) into the highest-pressure seawater stream created by the high-pressure pump A. This combined stream feeds the membranes C. The concentrate leaves the ERD at low pressure 5, expelled by the incoming feedwater flow 1. Pressure exchangers save energy in these systems by reducing the load on the high pressure pump. In a seawater RO system operating at a 40% membrane water recovery rate, the ERD supplies 60% of the membrane <b>feed</b> <b>flow.</b> Energy is consumed by the circulation pump, however, because this pump merely circulates and does not pressurize water, its energy consumption is almost negligible: less than 3% of the energy consumed by the high pressure pump. Therefore, nearly 60% of the membrane <b>feed</b> <b>flow</b> is pressurized with almost no energy input.|$|E
40|$|General {{characteristics}} of the plasma jet device for processing were given for verious operating conditions (ambient pressure, <b>feed</b> gas <b>flow</b> rate etc.). Its device was consist of the forced constricted type plasma jet generator and the feed ring to inject processing materials into the plasma jet. Experiments were made at vessel pressure 200 ∿ 1, 480 Torr, <b>feed</b> gas <b>flow</b> rate (Argon gas) 0 ∿ 30 l/min, arc current 60 ∿ 160 A, arc operating gas flow rate (Argon gas) 20 l/min. The arc voltage-current characteristics was a rising characteristics. The arc voltage and the net input power supplied to the arc were increased with increasing the vessel pressure. The maximum jet power was 3. 9 kW at the vessel pressure 1, 480 Torr. The <b>feed</b> gas <b>flow</b> rate had a marked influence on {{the stability of the}} plasma jet. The <b>feed</b> gas <b>flow</b> rate which did not disturb the plasma jet was decreased as the vessel pressure increased or the arc current decreased...|$|R
40|$|Two {{different}} approaches {{are used to}} control a semi-batch nonlinear reactor dealing with the significant exothermic reaction. This paper compares evolutionary approach represented by the Self - Organizing Migrating Algorithm (SOMA) with PID pole placement controller (PIDPP). The aim of controlled process is to regenerate the largest amount of chromium filter cake (chromium sludge) in the shortest possible time. For safety reasons the temperature inside the reactor should not exceed 100 °C. In this study the reactor is controlled by two manipulating inputs: filter cake <b>feeding</b> <b>flow</b> rate and cooling water temperature. The speed of the whole process depends on the filter cake <b>feeding</b> <b>flow</b> rate - {{in case of a}} large amount filter cake addition a sharp temperature rise follows. The controller must be able to find optimal strategy between the filter cake dosing and the cooling temperature to reach the shortest possible process time.

40|$|In {{continuous}} casting of bronze, macrosegregations cause {{weaknesses in the}} final product. Besides sedimen-tation and flotation of equiaxed grains, <b>feeding</b> <b>flow,</b> ther-mal and solutal buoyancy driven flow, and inlet flow are potential convection mechanisms which cause the for-mation of macrosegregations. Since macrosegregations are formed during solidification processes where relative motion between melt and solidifying dendrites occurs, their formation {{is strongly dependent on}} the flow, espe-cially in the mushy zone. To study and compare the im-pact of the different flow phenomena, a numerical inves-tigation has been carried out. The presented study dis-cusses the impact of different convection types like inlet flow, thermal and solutal buoyancy <b>flow,</b> and <b>feeding</b> <b>flow</b> on the formation of macrosegregations for one highly and one low permeable mushy zone. It is shown that low mush permeability favors positive macrosegregations ad-jacent to the wall and strong negative segregations at the center line. In contrast, a higher permeability favors sig-nificant negative macrosegregations at the wall and at the center line and positive macrosegregations between wall and center line. It is demonstrated how the different flow phenomena contribute to this finding. ...|$|R
50|$|These {{strategies}} work {{to reduce}} the magnitude of concentration polarisation and fouling. There is a range of techniques available however the most common is feed channel spacers as described in spiral wound modules. All of the strategies work by increasing eddies and generating a high shear in the flow near the membrane surface. Some of these strategies include vibrating the membrane, rotating the membrane, having a rotor disk above the membrane, pulsing the <b>feed</b> <b>flow</b> rate and introducing gas bubbling {{close to the surface}} of the membrane.|$|E
50|$|Recent {{fundamental}} {{studies indicate}} that membrane fouling is influenced by numerous factors such as system hydrodynamics, operating conditions, membrane properties, and material property (solute). At low pressure, low feed concentration, and high feed velocity, concentration polarisation effects are minimal and flux is almost proportional to trans-membrane pressure difference. However, in the high pressure range, flux becomes almost independent of applied pressure. Deviation from linear flux-pressure relation is due to concentration polarisation. At low <b>feed</b> <b>flow</b> rate or with high feed concentration, the limiting flux situation is observed even at relatively low pressures.|$|E
50|$|There {{are several}} {{problems}} related to climbing and falling film plate evaporators. One {{of them is the}} energy intensive system. In order to improve the productivity of the plant, the energy consumption needs to be reduced with the intention of reducing the use of steam. New strategies had been proposed by investigator to reduce the utilization of steam to improve the system of economic steam. The examples of operating strategies are flashing of feed, product and condensate, splitting of feed and steam and use of optimum <b>feed</b> <b>flow</b> series.|$|E
30|$|Experiment # 3 : Glycerol {{was used}} as sole carbon source during the batch phase. Induction was done along with feed supply, using a feeding medium {{containing}} glycerol plus lactose. By this protocol, heterologous protein expression was induced gradually as the supplementary medium {{was added to the}} bioreactor. An exponential <b>feeding</b> <b>flow</b> rate was employed based on the actual growth rates of the bacterium to reset both feed control parameters (C 1 and C 2 in Equation  1).|$|R

5000|$|Only {{a part of}} the saline {{feed water}} pumped into the {{membrane}} assembly passes through the membrane with the salt removed. The remaining [...] "concentrate" [...] flow passes along the saline side of the membrane to flush away the concentrated salt solution. The percentage of desalinated water produced versus the saline water <b>feed</b> <b>flow</b> is known as the [...] "recovery ratio". This varies with the salinity of the feed water and the system design parameters: typically 20% for small seawater systems, 40% - 50% for larger seawater systems, and 80% - 85% for brackish water. The concentrate flow is at typically only 3 bar / 50 psi less than the feed pressure, and thus still carries much of the high pressure pump input energy.|$|E
50|$|In {{chemical}} engineering, {{biochemical engineering}} and protein purification, crossflow filtration (also known as tangential flow filtration) {{is a type}} of filtration (a particular unit operation). Crossflow filtration is different from dead-end filtration in which the feed is passed through a membrane or bed, the solids being trapped in the filter and the filtrate being released at the other end. Cross-flow filtration gets its name because the majority of the <b>feed</b> <b>flow</b> travels tangentially {{across the surface of the}} filter, rather than into the filter. The principal advantage of this is that the filter cake (which can blind the filter) is substantially washed away during the filtration process, increasing the length of time that a filter unit can be operational. It can be a continuous process, unlike batch-wise dead-end filtration.|$|E
50|$|Material may be {{separated}} {{by means of}} an elutriator, which consists of a vertical tube up which fluid is passed at a controlled velocity. When the particles are introduced, often through a side tube, the smaller particles are carried over in the fluid stream while the large particles settle against the upward current. If we start with low flow rates small less dense particle attain terminal velocities, and flow with the stream, the particle from the stream is collected in overflow and hence will {{be separated}} from the <b>feed.</b> <b>Flow</b> rates can be increased to separate higher size ranges. Further size fractions may be collected if the overflow from the first tube is passed vertically upwards through a second tube of greater cross-section, and any number of such tubes can be arranged in series.|$|E
5000|$|Curved screens {{are able}} to {{separate}} finer particles (200-3000 µm) than trommel screens. However, binding may occur if the particle size is less than 200 µm [...] which will affect the separation efficiency. The screening rate of a curved screen is also {{much higher than the}} trommel screen as the whole surface area of the screen is utilised. Furthermore, for curved screens, the <b>feed</b> <b>flows</b> parallel to the apertures. This allows any loose material to break up from the jagged surface of the larger materials, resulting in more undersized particles passing through.|$|R

Rm can be interpreted as a membrane resistance to the solvent (water) permeation. This resistance is a membrane intrinsic property and is expected to be fairly constant and independent of the driving force, Δp. R is related to the type of membrane foulant, its concentration in the filtering solution, and the nature of foulant-membrane interactions.

50|$|According to {{the laws}} of heat transfer, {{initially}} the heat transfer rate increases as the temperature difference increases to approach the boiling point of the materials {{in the case of a}} constant <b>feed</b> <b>flow</b> rate. Hence, it is generally good to have a large temperature difference for this process. However, as the vapour bubbles gradually fill the entire centre of the tube, the steam pressure reaches a peak value. Beyond this point, the temperature difference, which acts as the main driving force for the heat transfer and also the rising film, will start reducing if there is any increase in steam pressure. In addition to that, there are other constraints in terms of the product quality and consistency when considering increasing the temperature difference. The temperature difference for driving force is also defined heavily by the properties of steam and the boiling liquid.|$|E
50|$|In {{the vortex}} {{separation}} process {{a mixture of}} uranium hexafluoride gas and hydrogen is injected tangentially into a tube at one end through nozzles or holes, at velocities close to the speed of sound. The tube tapers to a small exit aperture at one or both ends. This tangential injection of gas results in a spiral or vortex motion within the tube, and two gas streams are withdrawn {{at opposite ends of}} the vortex tube; centrifugal force providing the isotopic separation. The spiral swirling flow decays downstream of the feed inlet due to friction at the tube wall. Consequently, the inside diameter of the tube is typically tapered to reduce decay in the swirling flow velocity. This process is characterized by a separating element with a very small stage cut (the ratio of product flow to <b>feed</b> <b>flow)</b> of about 1/20, and high process-operating pressures.|$|E

On contrary, the severity of dilutive internal concentration polarization (DICP) phenomena was aggravated by increasing the draw solution flow rate. It was also found that when increasing the draw solution (DS) temperature from 20 °C to 26 °C the flux increased linearly and then started decreasing when temperature increased over 26 °C due {{to the development of a}} temperature gradient.

50|$|Where {{classical}} {{column chromatography}} uses a solid phase {{made by a}} packed bed, EBA uses particles in a fluidized state, ideally expanded {{by a factor of}} 2. Expanded bed adsorption is, however, different from fluidised bed chromatography in essentially two ways: one, the EBA resin contains particles of varying size and density which results in a gradient of particle size when expanded; and two, when the bed is in its expanded state, local loops are formed. Particles such as whole cells or cell debris, which would clog a packed bed column, readily pass through a fluidized bed. EBA can therefore be used on crude culture broths or slurries of broken cells, thereby bypassing initial clearing steps such as centrifugation and filtration, which is mandatory when packed beds are used. In older EBA column designs, the <b>feed</b> <b>flow</b> rate is kept low enough that the solid packing remains stratified and does not fluidize completely. Hence EBA can be modelled as frontal adsorption in a packed bed, rather than as a well-mixed, continuous-flow adsorber.|$|E
50|$|Foam hydrodynamics {{as well as}} many of the {{variables}} that affect on the success of foaming have limited understanding. This complicates using mathematical calculations to predict protein recovery by foaming. However some trends have been determined; high recovery rates have been linked to high concentrations of protein in the initial solution, high gas flow rates, and high <b>feed</b> <b>flow</b> rates. Enrichment is also known to increase when foaming is performed using shallow pools. Using pools with low heights allows for only a small amount of protein to adsorb from the solution {{to the surface of the}} bubbles in the foam resulting in lower surface viscosity. This leads to coalescence of the unstable foam higher up in the column causing an increase in the bubble size and an increase in the reflux of the protein in the foam. However, an increased velocity of the gas being pumped into the system has been shown to lead to a decrease in the enrichment ratio. Since these calculations are difficult to predict, bench and then pilot scale experiments are often performed in order to determine if foaming is a viable technique for extraction on an industrial scale.|$|E
5000|$|Tumbler {{screening}} is {{a separation}} method that uses three-dimensional elliptical movement to separate very fine particles from larger ones. It {{is an important}} technique applied in many fields dealing with raw materials and building materials for process and reuse. [...] This technique can achieve 99% high efficiency with its circular movement. Machines with tumbler screening techniques are commonly used because of its unique rush design, high life time utility, and the flexible angular velocity the machines can achieve. However, this type of machine requires low <b>feed</b> <b>flow</b> rate and the particles size for separation have to be controlled within a specific range. Furthermore, {{the performance of the}} process also depends on the intensity of the vibration. On the other hand, the water steam treatment is also an issue of this screening technique since this technique is applied worldwide. Presently, the most effective and environment friendly way for processing of the waste treatment is to classify the products.
