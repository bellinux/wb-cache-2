6000|$|The sea {{has been}} unusually rough all day. However, {{we have had}} a lively time of it, anyhow. We have had quite a run of visitors. The Governor-General came, and we {{received}} him with a salute of nine guns. He brought his family with him. I observed that carpets were spread from the pier-head to his carriage for him to walk on, though I have seen him walk there without any carpet when he was not on business. I thought may be he had what the accidental insurance people might call an <b>extra-hazardous</b> polish ("policy" [...] joke, but not above mediocrity,) on his boots, and wished to protect them, but I examined and could not see that they were blacked any better than usual. It may have been that he had forgotten his carpet, before, but he did not have it with him, anyhow. He was an exceedingly pleasant old gentleman; we all liked him, especially Blucher. When he went away, Blucher invited him to come again and fetch his carpet along.|$|E
6000|$|Well, {{we were at}} home in Palestine. It {{was easy}} to see that that [...] was the grand feature of the expedition. We had cared nothing much [...] about Europe. We galloped through the Louvre, the Pitti, the [...] Ufizzi, the Vatican--all the galleries--and through the pictured and [...] frescoed churches of Venice, Naples, and the cathedrals of Spain; [...] some of us said that certain of the great works of the old masters [...] were glorious creations of genius, (we found it out in the [...] guide-book, though we got hold of the wrong picture sometimes,) and [...] the others said they were disgraceful old daubs. We {{examined}} modern [...] and ancient statuary with a critical eye in Florence, Rome, or any [...] where we found it, and praised it if we saw fit, and if we didn't we [...] said we preferred the wooden Indians in front of the cigar stores of [...] America. But the Holy Land brought out all our enthusiasm. We fell [...] into raptures by the barren shores of Galilee; we pondered at Tabor [...] and at Nazareth; we exploded into poetry over the questionable [...] loveliness of Esdraelon; we meditated at Jezreel and Samaria over [...] the missionary zeal of Jehu; we rioted--fairly rioted among the holy [...] places of Jerusalem; we bathed in Jordan and the Dead Sea, reckless [...] whether our accident-insurance policies were <b>extra-hazardous</b> or not, [...] and brought away so many jugs of precious water from both places [...] that all the country from Jericho to the mountains of Moab will [...] suffer from drouth this year, I think. Yet, the pilgrimage part of [...] the excursion was its pet feature--there is no question about that. [...] After dismal, smileless Palestine, beautiful Egypt had few charms [...] for us. We merely glanced at it and were ready for home.|$|E
50|$|Membership {{was open}} to all white persons between 18 and 70, though those over 52 were ineligible for the {{beneficiary}} features. Applicants had to be of good moral character, bodily healthy and socially acceptable. Furthermore, those engaged in <b>extra-hazardous</b> occupations, such as coal miners, electric line men, aeronauts, people engaged in blasting, the manufacture of highly flammable or explosive material and submarine officers were excluded from membership. Also, no one {{who was involved in}} the liquor trade or an alcoholic was admitted. Certain classes of railway employees, expressmen, miners (excluding coal miners) and firemen had to pay an additional 25 cents assessment per each $1,000.|$|E
5000|$|The Northwest Legion of Honor was {{incorporated}} {{in the state of}} Iowa on March 12, 1884. Unlike the Iowa Legion of Honor, this order extended its jurisdiction to the Dakotas, Nebraska, Kansas and Minnesota, as well as Iowa. Membership was open to acceptable white persons eighteen to fifty years of age, who were not engaged in an <b>extra-hazardous</b> profession. Like the ILH it had only Subordinate Councils and a Grand Council. It had a ritual that taught benevolence and its motto was [...] "We Work Together". Its total membership in 1896 was 2,500. The NLH [...] "frankly admited" [...] to being an [...] "offspring" [...] of the American Legion of Honor ...|$|E
5000|$|This version, {{seen by many}} as the [...] "classic" [...] Fantasticar, {{debuted in}} Fantastic Four #12 (Mar. 1963) and {{is said to have been}} built by both Reed Richards and the Human Torch. It is 27 feet long, and can {{separate}} into four individual flying segments. It has VTOL capabilities and is powered by electric fans and jet turbines. It can go up to 550 mph, with a maximum altitude of 30,000 feet. While each individual pod was more clearly defined on this model, it had a number of improvements, including a transparent bulletproof windshield which could cover the entire pod, allowing for travel in <b>extra-hazardous</b> circumstances. This model also had a much better range and top speed, as it was able to traverse nearly the entire continental United States in a short period of time and has a range of over 3000 miles.|$|E
40|$|A {{non-linear}} {{relationship between}} {{maximum ambient temperature}} and number of {{sudden infant death syndrome}} (SIDS) cases had been reported for Montreal, Canada, for the warm season. In particular, high maximum ambient temperatures were found to be <b>extra-hazardous</b> for infants. The study was replicated with data from Vienna, Austria, applying the same statistical approach. Vienna is roughly comparable to Montreal with regard to temperatures in the warm season, size of population, and number of SIDS cases. Although the Viennese study was powerful enough to detect even smaller effects, the Montrealean results could not be confirmed. The Viennese results do not support the hypothesis of a strong effect of maximum ambient temperature on the risk of SIDS during the warm season...|$|E
