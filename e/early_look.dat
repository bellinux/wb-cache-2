500|$|In the May 2009 {{edition of}} Official PlayStation Magazine, Yoshinori Kitase said that Sazh was {{intended}} to be an Eddie Murphy-style comic-relief character as well as a sympathetic character. Toriyama was initially worried about the unconventional afro hairstyle. Due to the character having the largest amount of dialogue in the game, an experienced voice actor was chosen for him. His <b>early</b> <b>look</b> was, as revealed in the a special Ultimania guide released during 25th anniversary celebrations for the series, very different from his final design, with him being white with long brown hair, and wielding a shoulder-cannon rather than machine pistols. He was also named [...] "Baz". He is voiced by Reno Wilson in English and by Masashi Ebara in Japanese.|$|E
500|$|Madonna also enlisted male models Brad Alphonso, Jon Kortajarena, Rob Evans, Sean O'Pry and Simon Nessman. In the video, Madonna {{sported a}} {{brassiere}} designed by Agent Provocateur. The singer's stilettos, which were custom-made by footwear designer Paola Bay, consisted of black silk embroidered with silver threading. [...] "She wanted them {{as high as}} possible {{and to be able}} to dance with them on," [...] stated Bay. [...] "We did three fittings to make sure they were like second skin." [...] Arianne Phillips, dress designer for the video, recalled that she had to create custom-made high-heeled stilettos for Kazaky, because of unavailability of shoes in their size. Artur Gaspar from the band recalled that [...] "By the end of the day on set, our feet were bleeding and we had blisters... But if Madonna can repeat the dancing for the 50th time, why can't we?" [...] Phillips explained that they had created three different looks for Madonna in the video. The first was called a [...] "super vixen" [...] look for which she created short tops that could be worn as brassiere. Hairstylist Andy Lecompte wanted to go for a 1960s style with it. The second look portrayed was called [...] "rockstar" [...] for which designer Michael Smith created T-shirts out of metal mesh, while Lecompte cut the singer's hair short, so that it would resemble her <b>early</b> <b>look.</b> The final look was called the [...] "platinum bombshell", and was inspired by Marilyn Monroe.|$|E

Steamboat Willie, was the third short of the series to be produced but released first on November 18, 1928. Pete was featured as the Captain of the steamboat, Mickey as a crew of one and Minnie as their single passenger.

2500|$|White met Brian Warner on {{numerous}} occasions in the late 1980s. After an unexpected meeting at a used records store in the Coral Springs Mall where White was working, the two realized they had much in common, but had yet {{to work on a}} musical endeavor. White actively attempted to join Manson's band while playing in another project. He became an honorary spooky kid, and went by the groupie name Gordy White. In March 1993, White took part in Manson's side project Mrs. Scabtree and shared vocal duties with then girlfriend Jessicka. Jeordie did not join Marilyn Manson and the Spooky Kids until Gidget Gein was ejected from the band by the manager in December 1993. White was given the Manson band member name Twiggy Ramirez, which was derived by taking the first name from English supermodel Twiggy and the surname from American serial killer Richard Ramirez. Much of Twiggy's <b>early</b> <b>look</b> from the multi colored dreadlocks down to the dress style was taken directly from Jack Off Jill singer Jessicka and Gidget Gein. White never played bass until Manson bought him his first instrument right after he joined Manson's band. In 1998, White made a cameo in Monster Magnet's music video for [...] "Space Lord". In 2001, White appeared on an MTV Cribs episode: the [...] "Ozzfest Edition".|$|E
2500|$|Known for reinventing {{her style}} and image, Rihanna's music and fashion sense are {{noted by the}} media. In 2009, New York {{magazine}} described Rihanna's <b>early</b> <b>look</b> as that of [...] "a cookie-cutter teen queen", noting she has the ability [...] "to shift looks dramatically and with such ease". Around {{the time of the}} release of her second studio album, A Girl like Me (2006), many critics felt that Rihanna's style, sound, and musical material were too similar to those of Beyoncé. In an interview with Look magazine, Rihanna spoke about comparisons to Beyonce: [...] "Beyoncé is a great artist and I feel honored to be mentioned in the same sentence, but we're different performers with different styles". She revealed during Oprah's Next Chapter that Def Jam's pop-princess blueprint made her feel claustrophobic during her early years with the label. According to Rihanna, [...] "I felt like they were giving me a blueprint. [...] They had a brand, they had an idea of what they wanted me to be without figuring out who I was." [...] With the release of her third album, Good Girl Gone Bad (2007), Rihanna dismissed her innocent image for an edgier look with a new hairstyle, which was inspired by Charlize Theron's bob cut in the science fiction thriller Æon Flux (2005). She followed the likes of recording artists Janet Jackson and Christina Aguilera who also shed their innocent image for an edgier look and sound.|$|E
