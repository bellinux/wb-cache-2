40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "In 2002, Congress learned that the Palestinian Authority had collected $ 6. 8 million in taxes on U. <b>S.</b> humanitarian <b>assistance</b> meant {{for the people of}} the West Bank and Gaza and subsequently learned that some other foreign governments were also taxing U. <b>S.</b> <b>assistance.</b> U. <b>S.</b> Agency for International Development (USAID) officials estimate that at least several million dollars in taxes are collected annually on U. <b>S.</b> <b>assistance</b> programs, although some of this amount is reimbursed by recipient governments. This situation raised concerns in Congress that U. <b>S.</b> <b>assistance</b> funds for programs to help developing country populations were instead being diverted to the treasuries of foreign governments. In response to these concerns, Congress included a prohibition against such taxation in its Consolidated Appropriations Resolution for fiscal year 2003, and provided for a 200 percent penalty for taxes levied but not reimbursed. This legislation defines "taxes" and "taxation" as value added taxes (VAT) and customs duties imposed on commodities financed with U. <b>S.</b> <b>assistance</b> for programs for which funds are appropriated by the act. This report responds to a requirement in that legislation that we report to the committees on appropriations concerning these provisions. In discussions with staff of the House Appropriations' Subcommittee on Foreign Operations, Export Financing and Related Programs, we agreed to determine (1) the extent to which USAID bilateral framework agreements or other arrangements include exemption from taxation and (2) the progress that the Department of State has made in developing and distributing guidance to implement the prohibition. ...|$|R

About $ 70 million in U. <b>S.</b> <b>assistance</b> helped Haiti recruit, train, organize, and equip a basic police force, including specialized units. However, despite these achievements, the police and judicial sector have displayed several weaknesses. The Haitian government's lack of a clear commitment to addressing the major problems of its police and judicial institutions has been the key factor affecting {{the success of the}} U. <b>S.</b> <b>assistance</b> provided to these institutions. The United States is reassessing several aspects of its relationship with Haiti because of concerns about how votes were counted in Haiti's May 2000 elections.

40|$|The Freedom House letter {{suggests}} that there is a strong correlation between democratic deficits in Georgia and President Saakashvili’s ability {{to go to war with}} Russia. The letter’s implication is obvious: had more robust democratic institutions been in place, the war between Russia and Georgia might not have occurred. In this paper, I argue that U. <b>S.</b> government <b>assistance</b> to Georgia since 2003 has failed to support robust democratization, focusing too much on strengthening the executive branch of the Georgian government. Once Saakashvili took office, Washington reduced funding to critical democratization programs, especially those that supported independent media and civil society organizations. This shift in U. <b>S.</b> <b>assistance,</b> which contributed to the slowdown of democratic consolidation in Georgia, demonstrates that U. S. aid is critical to Georgia’s political development.
