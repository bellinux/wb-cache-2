5|$|In 1700, the {{population}} of Ashton, the Tame Valley's main urban area, was an estimated 550. The town's 18th-century growth was fuelled by an influx {{of people from the}} countryside attracted by the prospect of work in its new industries, mirroring the rest of the region. In the early 19th century, Irish immigrants escaping from the Great Irish Famine were also drawn to the area by the new <b>jobs</b> <b>created,</b> The availability of <b>jobs</b> <b>created</b> by the growth of the textile industry in the town led to Ashton's population increasing by more than 400% between 1801 and 1861, from 6,500 to 34,886. The population dropped by 9% during the 1860s {{as a consequence of the}} cotton famine caused by the American Civil War. The table below details {{the population}} change since 1851, including the percentage change since the last census.|$|E
5|$|In 1969 Brookley Air Force Base {{was closed}} by the Department of Defense, dealing Mobile's economy a severe blow. The closing {{resulted}} in a 10% unemployment rate in the city. This and other factors related to industrial restructuring ushered {{in a period of}} economic depression that lasted through the 1970s. The loss of <b>jobs</b> <b>created</b> numerous problems and resulted in loss of population as residents moved away for work.|$|E
5|$|The {{public sector}} {{is a major}} {{employer}} in Northern England. Between 2000 and 2008, the majority of new <b>jobs</b> <b>created</b> in Northern England were {{for the government and}} its suppliers and contractors. All three Northern regions have public sector employment above the national average, and North East has the highest level in England with 20.2% of the workforce in the public sector as of 2016 – down from 23.4% a decade earlier. The austerity programme under the government of David Cameron saw significant cuts to public services, and the reduction in public sector employment resulted in job losses for around 3% of the Northern England workforce with significant impact on the regional economy.|$|E

BBC employees started transferring to the development in May 2011, a process that took 36 weeks. BBC Director General Mark Thompson confirmed that up to a further 1,000 jobs could be created or transferred to the site. In January 2012 the BBC was accused of not supporting the community by MP, Hazel Blears, after it was reported that only 26 of 680 <b>jobs</b> <b>created</b> at the development had gone to residents of Salford.|$|E
5|$|By 1999, Lillehammer Olympiapark had {{an annual}} revenue of NOK20 million, {{of which a}} third came from the fund. Commercial {{activities}} contributed half the revenue, while the remaining fraction came from sports activities. Between 80 and 90 percent of the rental time went to sports activities. A report published by Lillehammer University College in 2007 concluded that all the 260 permanent <b>jobs</b> <b>created</b> in the Lillehammer area {{as a result of}} the Olympics were directly dependent on subsidies from the post-Olympic use funds. In the late 2000s, Lillehammer Olympiapark was using between NOK8 and 12 million per year. There was NOK25 million left in the fund in 2012, which was scheduled to be closed in 2014, after it has served for 20 years. Lillehammer Olympiapark started planning the organization of the venues in 2010. The company recommended that the subsidies be equally funded between Lillehammer Municipality, Oppland County Municipality and the Ministry of Culture. Specifically it recommended that the state take over ownership of the bobsleigh and luge track, while the county took partial ownership of Lillehammer Olympiapark. The state would thus continue to finance the track, which is the only such venue in Northern Europe, while the municipality and county finance the other four venues. The venues are recommended held to such a standard that they can host world cup and world championships in relevant sports.|$|E

40|$|Human {{resources}} {{is a critical}} factor in the knowledge-based society. The importance of human resources development is growing in regional areas and so there is a key role to be played by the local government. But there are many obstacles for local government in managing human resources development and <b>creating</b> <b>jobs.</b> One of the obstacles is the lack of central government's assistance. There is not enough manpower to effectively develop human resources and use them. There needs to be provision of institutional support and assistance in budget and manpower, and networks of relevant actors. This project aims at surveying the policies for RHRD (regional human resources development) and job creation within local governments.

25|$|The sizable {{decline in}} U.S. {{manufacturing}} jobs since 2000 has been blamed on various causes, such as trade with a rising Asia, offshoring of jobs with few restrictions to lower wage countries, innovation in global supply chains (e.g., containerization), and other technology improvements. The millions of construction <b>jobs</b> <b>created</b> during the housing bubble that peaked in 2006 helped mask {{some of this}} adverse employment impact initially. Further, households dramatically increased their debt burden from 2001-2007, extracting home equity for use in consumption. However, the housing bubble collapse in 2006-2008 contributed to the subprime mortgage crisis and resulting Great Recession, which resulted in households switching from adding debt to paying it down, a headwind to the economy for several years thereafter.|$|E
