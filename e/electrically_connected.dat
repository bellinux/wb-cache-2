25|$|Earthing – {{to avoid}} {{electrical}} charge accumulation on a conductive coated sample, {{it is usually}} <b>electrically</b> <b>connected</b> to the metal sample holder. Often an electrically conductive adhesive is used for this purpose.|$|E
25|$|Because the {{shielding}} {{is made of}} metal, it {{may also}} serve as a ground. Usually a shielded twisted pair cable has a special grounding wire added called a drain wire which is <b>electrically</b> <b>connected</b> to the shield or screen. The drain wire simplifies connection to ground at the connectors.|$|E
25|$|Supercapacitor {{electrodes}} {{are generally}} thin coatings applied and <b>electrically</b> <b>connected</b> to a conductive, metallic current collector. Electrodes must have good conductivity, high temperature stability, long-term chemical stability (inertness), high corrosion resistance and high surface areas per unit volume and mass. Other requirements include environmental friendliness and low cost.|$|E
50|$|When <b>electrically</b> <b>connecting</b> {{light-emitting}} diodes with thermosonic bonding techniques, an improved {{performance of the}} device has been shown.|$|R

5000|$|In {{electroplating}} tanks, the electrolyte simultaneously deposits metal {{onto the}} object to be plated, and <b>electrically</b> <b>connects</b> that {{object in the}} circuit.|$|R
25|$|The sense coil (6) is a {{differential}} {{current transformer}} which surrounds (but is not <b>electrically</b> <b>connected</b> to) the live and neutral conductors. In normal operation, all the current down the live conductor returns up the neutral conductor. The currents {{in the two}} conductors are therefore equal and opposite and cancel each other out.|$|E
25|$|In contrast, {{electrochemical}} capacitors (supercapacitors) {{consists of}} two electrodes separated by an ion-permeable membrane (separator) and <b>electrically</b> <b>connected</b> via an electrolyte. Energy storage occurs within the double-layers of both electrodes as a mixture of a double-layer capacitance and pseudocapacitance. When both electrodes have approximately the same resistance (internal resistance), {{the potential of the}} capacitor decreases symmetrically over both double-layers, whereby a voltage drop across the equivalent series resistance (ESR) of the electrolyte is achieved. For asymmetrical supercapacitors like hybrid capacitors the voltage drop between the electrodes could be asymmetrically. The maximum potential across the capacitor (the maximal voltage) is limited by the electrolyte decomposition voltage.|$|E
25|$|Displays for a {{small number}} of {{individual}} digits or fixed symbols (as in digital watches and pocket calculators) can be implemented with independent electrodes for each segment. In contrast, full alphanumeric or variable graphics displays are usually implemented with pixels arranged as a matrix consisting of <b>electrically</b> <b>connected</b> rows {{on one side of the}} LC layer and columns on the other side, which makes it possible to address each pixel at the intersections. The general method of matrix addressing consists of sequentially addressing one side of the matrix, for example by selecting the rows one-by-one and applying the picture information on the other side at the columns row-by-row. For details on the various matrix addressing schemes see passive-matrix and active-matrix addressed LCDs.|$|E
40|$|A {{method for}} {{electrostatic}} deposition of graphene on a substrate comprises {{the steps of}} securing a graphite sample to a first electrode; <b>electrically</b> <b>connecting</b> the first electrode to a positive terminal of a power source; <b>electrically</b> <b>connecting</b> a second electrode to a ground terminal of the power source; placing the substrate over the second electrode; and using the power source to apply a voltage, such that graphene {{is removed from the}} graphite sample and deposited on the substrate...|$|R
40|$|The method {{according}} to the invention is directed to manufacturing an electric device (100) {{according to}} the invention, having a body (102) with a resistor comprising a phase change material being changeable between a first phase and a second phase, the resistor having a first electrical resistance when the phase change material is in the first phase, and a second electrical resistance different from the first electrical resistance when the phase change material is in the second phase. The resistor is a nanowire (NW) <b>electrically</b> <b>connecting</b> a first conductor (172, 120) and a second conductor (108, 121).; The method comprises the step of providing a body (102) having the first conductor (172, 120), providing the first conductor (172, 120) with the nanowire (NW) thereby <b>electrically</b> <b>connecting</b> the nanowire (NW) and the first conductor (172, 120), and providing the nanowire (NW) with the second conductor (108, 121) thereby <b>electrically</b> <b>connecting</b> the nanowire (NW) and the second conductor (108, 121) ...|$|R
40|$|In this {{technical}} note the often overlooked issue of <b>electrically</b> <b>connecting</b> screen-printed electrode sensors is considered. The electrical connection of screen-printed electrodes to the potentiostat/electronics {{can be a}} main issue when a true electrochemical response {{is trying to be}} obtained and if one does not have a stable electrical connection, the results that are obtained may lack reproducibility and therefore maybe discredited as "another failed electrochemical probe/analyte". This paper considers the case of <b>electrically</b> <b>connecting</b> screen-printed with crocodile clips and compares that to the use of edge-connectors demonstrating the precise connection of an electrode setup when utilising crocodile clips can result in extremely reproducible electrochemical outputs when applied correctly...|$|R
25|$|Batteries convert {{chemical}} energy directly to electrical energy. A battery consists of some number of voltaic cells. Each cell {{consists of two}} half-cells connected in series by a conductive electrolyte containing anions and cations. One half-cell includes electrolyte and the negative electrode, the electrode to which anions (negatively charged ions) migrate; the other half-cell includes electrolyte and the positive electrode to which cations (positively charged ions) migrate. Redox reactions power the battery. Cations are reduced (electrons are added) at the cathode during charging, while anions are oxidized (electrons are removed) at the anode during charging. During discharge, the process is reversed. The electrodes do not touch each other, but are <b>electrically</b> <b>connected</b> by the electrolyte. Some cells use different electrolytes for each half-cell. A separator allows ions to flow between half-cells, but prevents mixing of the electrolytes.|$|E
25|$|The {{galvanic}} cell uses two different metal electrodes, each in an electrolyte where the positively charged ions are the oxidized {{form of the}} electrode metal. One electrode will undergo oxidation (the anode) and the other will undergo reduction (the cathode). The metal of the anode will oxidize, going from an oxidation state of 0 (in the solid form) to a positive oxidation state and become an ion. At the cathode, the metal ion in solution will accept one or more electrons from the cathode and the ion's oxidation state is reduced to 0. This forms a solid metal that electrodeposits on the cathode. The two electrodes must be <b>electrically</b> <b>connected</b> to each other, allowing for a flow of electrons that leave the metal of the anode and flow through this connection to the ions at {{the surface of the}} cathode. This flow of electrons is an electric current {{that can be used to}} do work, such as turn a motor or power a light.|$|E
25|$|Condenser {{microphones}} {{span the}} range from telephone transmitters through inexpensive karaoke microphones to high-fidelity recording microphones. They generally produce a high-quality audio signal {{and are now}} the popular choice in laboratory and recording studio applications. The inherent suitability of this technology {{is due to the}} very small mass that must be moved by the incident sound wave, unlike other microphone types that require the sound wave to do more work. They require a power source, provided either via microphone inputs on equipment as phantom power or from a small battery. Power is necessary for establishing the capacitor plate voltage, and is also needed to power the microphone electronics (impedance conversion in the case of electret and DC-polarized microphones, demodulation or detection in the case of RF/HF microphones). Condenser microphones are also available with two diaphragms that can be <b>electrically</b> <b>connected</b> to provide a range of polar patterns (see below), such as cardioid, omnidirectional, and figure-eight. It is also possible to vary the pattern continuously with some microphones, for example the Røde NT2000 or CAD M179.|$|E

50|$|Smart {{cards are}} a newer {{generation}} of card that contain an integrated circuit. Some smart cards have metal contacts to <b>electrically</b> <b>connect</b> the card to the reader, and contactless cards use {{a magnetic field}} or radio frequency (RFID) for proximity reading.|$|R

25|$|In May 1952, Sidney Darlington filed {{a patent}} {{application}} in the United States for a structure {{with two or}} three transistors integrated onto a single chip in various configurations; in October 1952, Bernard Oliver filed a patent application for a method of manufacturing three <b>electrically</b> <b>connected</b> planar transistors on one semiconductor crystal. On May 21, 1953, Harwick Johnson filed a patent application for a method of forming various electronic components – transistors, resistors, lumped and distributed capacitances – on a single chip. Johnson described three ways of producing an integrated one-transistor oscillator. All of them used a narrow strip of a semiconductor with a bipolar transistor on one end and differed in the methods of producing the transistor. The strip acted as a series of resistors; the lumped capacitors were formed by fusion whereas inverse-biased p-n junctions acted as distributed capacitors. Johnson did not offer a technological procedure, and it is not known whether he produced an actual device. In 1959, a variant of his proposal was implemented and patented by Jack Kilby.|$|E

2500|$|Healing — The {{windings}} {{which are}} now <b>electrically</b> <b>connected</b> by the schoopage have to be [...] "healed".

50|$|A stamped {{circuit board}} (SCB) {{is used to}} {{mechanically}} support and <b>electrically</b> <b>connect</b> electronic components using conductive pathways, tracks or traces etched from copper sheets laminated onto a non-conductive substrate.

50|$|To {{prevent a}} failure like MR-1 from {{happening}} again, subsequent Mercury-Redstones added a grounding strap about 12 in long to <b>electrically</b> <b>connect</b> the rocket to the launch pad. This strap {{was designed to}} separate from the rocket well after all other electrical connections to the ground had been severed.|$|R
2500|$|In 1983 {{the light}} was {{automated}} and the station was demanned. The apparatus installed consists of four vertical panels, each consisting of four 300-millimetre (12in) rear surfaced parabolic reflectors. The lamps are 12-volt 36-watt quartz halogen lamps, <b>electrically</b> <b>connected</b> in pairs 180° apart. The apparatus is installed on a gear-less pedestal, rotating three times per minute, showing a light characteristic of one white flash every 10 seconds (Fl.W. 10s). The light intensity is 260,000cd and the light is visible for [...] The light is solar powered, {{and it was the}} first of its kind in Australia. At the same time the cottages were handed over to the Northern Territory Conservation Commission.|$|E
2500|$|A {{superior}} solution, and {{one which}} allowed each cathode to [...] "float" [...] at a different voltage, {{was that of the}} indirectly heated cathode: a [...] cylinder of oxide-coated nickel acted as electron-emitting cathode, and was electrically isolated from the filament inside it. Indirectly heated cathodes enable the cathode circuit to be separated from the heater circuit. The filament, no longer <b>electrically</b> <b>connected</b> to the tube's electrodes, became simply known as a [...] "heater", and could as well be powered by AC without any introduction of hum. In the 1930s indirectly heated cathode tubes became widespread in equipment using AC power. Directly heated cathode tubes continued to be widely used in battery-powered equipment as their filaments required considerably less power than the heaters required with indirectly heated cathodes.|$|E
2500|$|Ribbon {{microphones}} use a thin, usually {{corrugated metal}} ribbon suspended in a magnetic field. The ribbon is <b>electrically</b> <b>connected</b> to the microphone's output, and its vibration within {{the magnetic field}} generates the electrical signal. Ribbon microphones are similar to moving coil microphones {{in the sense that}} both produce sound by means of magnetic induction. Basic ribbon microphones detect sound in a bi-directional (also called figure-eight, as in the diagram below) pattern because the ribbon is open on both sides. [...] Also, because the ribbon is much less mass it responds to the air velocity rather than the sound pressure. Though the symmetrical front and rear pickup can be a nuisance in normal stereo recording, the high side rejection can be used to advantage by positioning a ribbon microphone horizontally, for example above cymbals, so that the rear lobe picks up sound only from the cymbals. Crossed figure 8, or Blumlein pair, stereo recording is gaining in popularity, and the figure-eight response of a ribbon microphone is ideal for that application.|$|E

60|$|For {{the sake}} of illustration, it was {{supposed}} that the surrounding sea-bottom was studded with invisible torpedoes, and that the Nettle was a warship, determined to advance into the enemy's harbour. To effect this with safety, {{and in order to}} clear away the supposed sunken torpedoes, a counter-torpedo was floated between two empty casks, and sent off floating in the desired direction by means of the tide. This countermine consisted of an iron cylinder, containing 300 pounds of powder, and was <b>electrically</b> <b>connected</b> with the Nettle. A small charge of gun-cotton was fixed to the suspender that held the torpedo to its casks. When at a safe distance from the ship, this charge was fired. It cut the suspender and let the torpedo sink to the bottom. There it was exploded with terrific violence, as was quickly shown by the mighty fountain of mud, water, and smoke that instantly shot up into the air. It has been proved by experiment that 500 pounds of gun-cotton exploded below water, will destroy all the torpedoes that lie within a radius of 120 yards. It is obvious, therefore, that a warship could advance into the space thus cleared and then send a second countermine ahead of her in the same way. If neither tide, current, nor wind will serve to drift the casks, the operation might be accomplished by a small boat, which could back out of danger after laying each torpedo, and thus, step by step, or shot by shot, the advance could be made in safety through the enemy's defences.|$|E

50|$|The Western Union or Lineman splice was {{developed}} during {{the introduction of the}} telegraph to mechanically and <b>electrically</b> <b>connect</b> wires that were subject to loading stress.
