5|$|Egyptian gods were {{involved}} in <b>human</b> <b>lives</b> {{as well as in}} the overarching order of nature. This divine influence applied mainly to Egypt, as foreign peoples were traditionally believed to be outside the divine order. But in the New Kingdom, when other nations were under Egyptian control, foreigners were said to be under the sun god's benign rule in the same way that Egyptians were.|$|E
5|$|Gods were {{assumed to}} be present {{throughout}} the world, capable of influencing natural events and the course of <b>human</b> <b>lives.</b> People interacted with them in temples and unofficial shrines, for personal reasons {{as well as for}} larger goals of state rites. Egyptians prayed for divine help, used rituals to compel deities to act, and called upon them for advice. Humans' relations with their gods were a fundamental part of Egyptian society.|$|E
5|$|Schiavo {{describes}} how the FAA uses a formula ascribing specific monetary value to <b>human</b> <b>lives,</b> and how the agency allows numbers {{to decide whether the}} cost of extra safety is worth the additional expense. For example, if equipping an airline fleet with smoke detectors would cost $100 million, but would only save 10 lives each worth $1 million, then the expense is ruled out. Schiavo is similarly critical of the internal FAA politics and the FAA's administrators.|$|E

In addition to the six <b>human</b> <b>lives</b> lost, 497 heads of cattle and 21,387 chickens were killed. All six human deaths were indirectly related to Georges; the first death occurred when an 61-year-old woman stepped on a downed wire and was electrocuted; the second occurred when a 56-year-old man drove over another downed wire on his motorcycle and was electrocuted.|$|E
5|$|Resonance of Fate {{takes place}} on Earth in the distant future. When {{atmospheric}} pollution nearly annihilates life on Earth, the remnants of humanity construct a purification system called Basel. In time, the surviving human population create a civilization around Basel's central tower, watched over by its mechanical core Zenith. Zenith ties <b>human</b> <b>lives</b> to quartz stones, making them immune to the pollution while giving them predetermined social status and lifespans. The three protagonists—Zephyr, Leanne, and Vashyron—form a mercenary group that take odd jobs for the populace of Basel. During their missions, they discover a plan by the city's ruling Cardinals to subvert Zenith's rule, and discover their own connections to the Cardinals' plans.|$|E
5|$|A {{storm in}} the {{southern}} Atlantic caused the loss of several ships, and the six remaining ships eventually rendezvoused in the Mozambique Channel before proceeding to Calicut in India. Cabral was originally successful in negotiating trading rights, but Arab merchants saw Portugal's venture {{as a threat to}} their monopoly and stirred up an attack by both Muslims and Hindus on the Portuguese entrepôt. The Portuguese sustained many casualties and their facilities were destroyed. Cabral took vengeance by looting and burning the Arab fleet and then bombarded the city in retaliation for its ruler having failed to explain the unexpected attack. From Calicut the expedition sailed to the Kingdom of Cochin, another Indian city-state, where Cabral befriended its ruler and loaded his ships with coveted spices before returning to Europe. Despite the loss of <b>human</b> <b>lives</b> and ships, Cabral's voyage was deemed a success upon his return to Portugal. The extraordinary profits resulting from the sale of the spices bolstered the Portuguese Crown's finances and helped lay the foundation of a Portuguese Empire that would stretch from the Americas to the Far East.|$|E
