5|$|Modern {{scholars}} {{consider this}} one of the earliest, and most deadly, biological attacks in world history, though in the end the Mongols were forced to retreat. Early sources state that the plague began its spread in the spring of 1346 at the River Don near the Black Sea, then spread throughout Russia, the Caucasus, and the <b>Genovese</b> provinces within the year.|$|E
5|$|An outraged Licavoli has Greene's house blown up, but he survives. He then {{attempts}} to demote Nardi {{and take away}} his crew, {{only to have the}} latter join forces with Greene. Vowing to take over Cleveland together, Greene and Nardi start by organizing the murders of Licavoli’s associates, many of whom are blown up. Thirty-six car bombings occur during the summer of 1976, drawing national attention and humiliating Licavoli. After failing multiple times to kill Greene, Licavoli is forced to humbly ask <b>Genovese</b> boss Anthony Salerno to help him kill Nardi and Greene.|$|E
5|$|Massino testified {{again in}} the 2012 {{extortion}} trial of <b>Genovese</b> capo Anthony Romanello, primarily to provide background as {{an expert on the}} American Mafia. While Massino had not worked closely with Romanello, prosecutors decided to use him after another mobster-turned-witness was dropped; the case ended in an acquittal. Massino had also been considered as a witness in the 2013 murder trial of Colombo acting boss Joel Cacace, but was dropped after he was unable to fully remember the meeting where he claimed Cacace indicated his involvement in the murder of NYPD officer Ralph Dols.|$|E

Both of these areas are popular with wildlife enthusiasts, hikers, artists and photographers, cylists and shepherds grazing their goats and sheep. Amongst the features of Campillo de los <b>Genoveses</b> is a huge fossilised sand dune that once was part of the beach, making this an area of geological importance.|$|R

5|$|Admiralty {{law is the}} {{particular}} body of national laws applied to maritime questions and offenses, as the uncertainty of sea voyages has caused the sea {{to be viewed as}} a unique jurisdiction since antiquity. Rhodian, Roman, Byzantine, Trani, and Amalfian laws were important influences on the French, <b>Genovese,</b> and Hanseatic codes which established the first English courts of admiralty. Unlike the usual English common law system, the courts of admiralty hewed closer to Continental practice, leaving it open for abuse that contributed to the American Revolution. The adoption of the present constitution reintroduced admiralty law to the United States, but with a relatively larger sphere for trials by jury.|$|E
5|$|In the Byzantine {{period the}} {{evolution}} of the port is halted due to the frequent invasions by the migratory people, the trade was fading and the traders were looking for other more secure markets like Venice or Genoa but many constructions in the port maintain the name <b>genovese</b> in the memory of the merchants from the Italian city. After a brief period when the port was under Romanian rule, the Dobruja region was occupied by the Ottoman Empire. In 1857, the Turkish authorities leased the port and the Cernavodă–Constanța Railway to the British company Danube and Black Sea Railway and Kustendge Harbour Company Ltd.|$|E
5|$|In the 15th century, West European mariners—beginning with Portugal—started making still longer voyages of exploration, using {{improvements}} on translated Islamic star {{charts and}} {{a variation on}} African fishing boats called the caravel. In 1473, Lopes Gonçalves crossed the equator and disproved the Aristotelian notion that a ring of fire would bar exploration of the southern hemisphere. Bartolomeu Dias rounded the Cape of Good Hope in 1487; in 1498, Vasco da Gama reached Malindi, where a local pilot showed him how to follow the monsoon to India. In 1492, relying on incorrect estimates of the circumference of the Earth, the <b>Genovese</b> Christopher Columbus sailed from Cadiz to the Canaries and thence into the open Atlantic in a Spanish attempt to reach the Orient. Instead, he made landfall on {{an island in the}} Caribbean Sea. The resulting Columbian Exchange introduced potatoes, corn, and chili peppers to the Old World while smallpox epidemics devastated the indigenous peoples of the Americas. This disruption and depopulation permitted rapid Spanish conquests and led to the widespread adoption of African slavery to man lucrative tobacco, sugar, indigo, and cotton plantations. In 1519, Juan Sebastián Elcano completed Magellan's Spanish expedition to sail around the world. These and other voyages permitted European maps to attain a previously impossible degree of accuracy. In 1538, Gerardus Mercator devised a map projection conveniently making constant bearings (rhumb lines) straight. In the Arctic, in 1594, the Dutch captain Willem Barentsz reached Svalbard and the Barents Sea while, in the south, Anthony de la Roché crossed the Antarctic Convergence in 1675 and three separate expeditions—one British, one American, and one Russian—all claimed to have discovered Antarctica in 1820. Not all voyages of discovery originated in Western Europe. Although accurate charting of the coasts of Russia only began in the 18th century and the archipelago of Severnaya Zemlya was not discovered until 1910, Novgorodians had been sailing the White Sea since at least the 13th century. Despite a long-standing preference for autarky, China briefly opened up under the Song and Mongol Yuan dynasties. In the early 15th century, Zheng He's fleet of treasure ships repeatedly sailed from Ming China with 37,000 men aboard 317 ships, reaching as far as the African coast. Chinese exploration, however, was soon curtailed again and finally outlawed. The peoples of East Asia were introduced to the true shape of the other continents from the maps of Matteo Ricci.|$|E

25|$|Having {{taken control}} of what was now the <b>Genovese</b> crime family in 1957, Vito <b>Genovese</b> decided to {{organize}} a Cosa Nostra conference to legitimize his new position. Held on mobster Joseph Barbara's farm in Apalachin, New York, the Apalachin Meeting attracted over 100 Cosa Nostra mobsters from around the nation. However, local law enforcement discovered the meeting by chance and quickly surrounded the farm. As the meeting broke up, <b>Genovese</b> escaped capture by running through the woods. However, many other high-ranking mobsters were arrested. Cosa Nostra leaders were chagrined by the public exposure and bad publicity from the Apalachin meeting, and generally blamed <b>Genovese</b> for the fiasco. Wary of <b>Genovese</b> gaining more power in the Mafia Commission, Gambino used the abortive Apalachin Meeting {{as an excuse to}} move against his former ally. Gambino, former <b>Genovese</b> bosses Lucky Luciano and Frank Costello, and Lucchese crime family boss Tommy Lucchese allegedly lured <b>Genovese</b> into a drug distribution scheme that ultimately resulted in his conspiracy indictment and conviction. In 1959, <b>Genovese</b> was sentenced to 15 years in prison on narcotics charges. <b>Genovese,</b> who was the most powerful boss in New York, had been effectively eliminated as a rival by Gambino. <b>Genovese</b> would later die in prison.|$|E
25|$|By all accounts, Vito <b>Genovese</b> was angling {{to become}} boss of all bosses, and {{believed}} that Gambino would support him. Gambino, however, had his own mind. He secretly joined forces with Charles Luciano and Frank Costello to get <b>Genovese</b> {{out of the way}} as well. Gambino helped trick <b>Genovese</b> into a lucrative drug deal, then paid a small-time Puerto Rican dealer to testify against him. In April 1959, <b>Genovese</b> was sentenced to 15 years in federal prison, where he died in 1969.|$|E
25|$|When Lucchese became boss, {{he helped}} Vito <b>Genovese</b> and Carlo Gambino in their fights {{to take control}} of their families. The three plotted to take over the Mafia Commission by murdering family bosses Frank Costello and Albert Anastasia. On May 2, 1957 Costello survived an {{assassination}} attempt and immediately decided to retire as boss in favor of <b>Genovese.</b> Then on October 25, 1957, the Gallo brothers (from the Colombo family) murdered Anastasia, allowing Gambino to become boss. Lucchese and Gambino started conspiring to remove their former ally <b>Genovese.</b> After the disastrous 1957 Apalachin meeting of mob leaders in Upstate New York, <b>Genovese</b> lost {{a great deal of respect}} in the Commission. In 1959, with the assistance of Luciano, Costello, and Meyer Lansky, <b>Genovese</b> was arrested.|$|E
