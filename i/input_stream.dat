25|$|Those {{models that}} {{emphasize}} on lexical processes {{can be further}} {{divided into two groups}} based on how attention is allocated in the reading model. The mainstream model E-Z Reader (Reichle, Rayner, & Pollatsek, 2003), along with older ones like Reader (Just & Carpenter, 1980) and EMMA (Salvucci, 2001) assumes that attention is allocated to only one word sequentially. On the contrary, the SWIFT model assumes that attention in reading is distributed among the currently fixated word and its neighbours. Since attention allocation determines the <b>input</b> <b>stream</b> in these models, difference in attention allocation results in fundamental difference in the subsequent processing and simulation output. E-Z Reader incorporates various lexical properties into a complex structure of interaction between lexical processing, saccade programming and attention shifting; it reproduces the widest range of phenomena in reading behaviours and can be generalised to reading behaviours in elder people, in different languages and in different types of text presentation (Reichle, 2011). In contrast, SWIFT resorts to a dynamic field of parallel activation that stochastically triggers saccade programming, yielding parsimonious simulations of refixation, regression (fixate back to a previous word), and neighbouring effects (how neighbouring words affect the current fixation) (Engbert & Kliegl, 2011). The debate is still on whether attention in reading should be relaxed to more than one word.|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn recent years, {{shrinking}} size in {{integrated circuits}} has imposed {{a big challenge}} in maintaining the reliability in conventional computing. Stochastic computing {{has been seen as}} a reliable, low-cost, and low-power alternative to overcome such issues. Stochastic Computing (SC) computes data in the form of bit streams of 1 s and 0 s. Therefore, SC outperforms conventional computing in terms of tolerance to soft error and uncertainty at the cost of increased computational time. Stochastic Computing with uncorrelated <b>input</b> <b>streams</b> requires streams to be highly independent for better accuracy. This results in more hardware consumption for conversion of binary numbers to stochastic streams. Correlation can be used to design Stochastic Computation Elements (SCE) with correlated <b>input</b> <b>streams.</b> These designs have higher accuracy and less hardware consumption. In this paper, we propose new SC designs to implement image processing algorithms with correlated <b>input</b> <b>streams.</b> Experimental results of proposed SC with correlated <b>input</b> <b>streams</b> show on average 37 % improvement in accuracy with reduction of 50 - 90 % in area and 20 - 85 % in delay over existing stochastic designs...|$|R

2500|$|Two {{types of}} ethanol are {{produced}} from corn {{and other plants}} such as sugar cane.

This has resulted in farmers increasing acreage under corn by adopting crop rotations between corn and soybeans; the latter crop's production has thus declined.

40|$|Abstract. Multimodal systems must process several <b>input</b> <b>streams</b> {{efficiently}} {{and represent the}} input {{in a way that}} allows the establishment of connections between modalities. This paper describes a multimodal system that uses Combinatory Categorial Grammars to parse several <b>input</b> <b>streams</b> and translate them into logical formulas. These logical formulas are expressed in Hybrid Logic, which is very suitable for multimodal integration because it can represent temporal relationships between modes in an abstract way. This level of abstraction makes it possible to define rules for multimodal processing in a straightforward way. ...|$|R

50|$|Imagine {{a website}} has 100 text input boxes. A few are {{vulnerable}} to SQL injections on certain strings. Submitting random strings to those boxes for a while hopefully hits the bugged code path. The error shows itself as a broken HTML page half rendered because of an SQL error. In this case, only text boxes are treated as <b>input</b> <b>streams.</b> However, software systems have many possible <b>input</b> <b>streams,</b> such as cookie and session data, the uploaded file stream, RPC channels, or memory. Errors can happen {{in any of these}} <b>input</b> <b>streams.</b> The test goal is to first get an un-handled error, and then understand the flaw based on the failed test case. Testers write an automated tool to test their understanding of the flaw until it is correct. After that, it may become obvious how to package the payload so that the target system triggers its execution. If this is not viable, one can hope that another error produced by the fuzzer yields more fruit. The use of a fuzzer saves time by not checking adequate code paths where exploits are unlikely.|$|R
