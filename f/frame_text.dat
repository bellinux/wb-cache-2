40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} new Fourier-Statistical Features (FSF) in RGB space for {{detecting}} text in video frames of unconstrained background, different fonts, different scripts and different font sizes. This work {{consists of two}} parts namely automatic classification of text frames from a large database of text and non-text frames and FSF in RGB for text detection in the classified text frames. For text frame classification, we present novel features based on three visual cues, namely, sharpness in filter-edge maps, straightness of the edges and proximity of the edges to identify a true text frame. For text detection in video frames, we present new Fourier transform based features in RGB space with statistical features and the computed FSF features from RGB bands are subject to K-means clustering to classify text pixels from {{the background of the}} <b>frame.</b> <b>Text</b> blocks of the classified text pixels are determined by analyzing the projection profiles. Finally, we introduce a few heuristics to eliminate false positives from the frame. The robustness of the proposed approach is tested by conducting experiments on a variety of frames of low contrast, complex background, different fonts, and sizes of text in the frame. Both our own test dataset and a publicly available dataset are used for the experiments. The experimental results show that the proposed approach is superior to existing approaches in terms of detection rate, false positive rate and misdetection rate...|$|E

40|$|Abstract- <b>Text</b> <b>frame</b> {{classification}} {{is needed}} in many applications such as event identification, exact event boundary identification, navigation, video surveillance in multimedia etc. To {{the best of our}} knowledge, there are no methods reported solely dedicated to <b>text</b> <b>frame</b> classifications so far. Hence this paper presents a new approach to <b>text</b> <b>frame</b> classification in video based on capturing local observable edge properties of <b>text</b> <b>frames,</b> by virtue of the strong presence of sharp edges, straight appearances of edges and consistent proximity between edges. The approach initially classifies the blocks of the <b>frame</b> into <b>text</b> blocks and non-text blocks. The true text block is then identified among classified text blocks to detect <b>text</b> <b>frames</b> by the proposed features. If the <b>text</b> <b>frame</b> produces one true text block then it is considered as a <b>text</b> <b>frame</b> otherwise a non-text frame. We evaluate the proposed approach on a large database containing both <b>text</b> and nontext <b>frames</b> and publicly available data at two levels, i. e., estimating recall and precision at the block level and the frame level.

40|$|Lying at {{the heart}} of this volume is the web’s {{enticing}} appeal, but as yet essentially unrealized potential, as the ultimate corpus around which text-based studies of English can be shaped. Key words in this volume are thus web-based text analysis, structured web explorations, ready-made syllabus, focus on e-learning, step-by-step self study, teacher training, development of realistic web-based syllabuses, multimodal concordancing and annotation. As the subtitle indicates, the volume addresses the needs of teachers and students who want to <b>frame</b> <b>text</b> studies in English around the web but need a ready-made guide as to how this can be done. Rather than attempting to adapt traditional language-only concordancing and annotation tools and techniques to web-based studies of English, the volume presents software tools and text analysis techniques which sideline the traditional focus on lemma-based characteristics of corpora; it refocuses attention on an integrated and multimodal model of annotation, concordancing, and web analysis techniques – all of which is particularly useful when analysing web genres. The volume's starting point is an awareness of the need to adapt research on web analysis, concordancing and annotation into a self-access and/or classroom-learning syllabus, whence the volume’s incremental articulation as a series of steps which, as explained in the Introduction, correspond to 2 -hour lesson units that build up into a 30 -to- 40 hour ready-made course responding to the requirements of English language learning and teaching in a wide range of degree courses (e. g. Foreign Languages, Communication Studies, Law, Psychology and Political Sciences). The volume contains descriptions of web concordancing and annotation techniques, illustrations of their application and guided exercises as well as insets providing suggestions for teachers and students on how the resources presented in the book might best be used. The volume is also supported by a website with links to the software tools described, plus additional exercises and materials, many using the McaWeb web annotation and concordancing system (mcaweb. unipv. it) ...|$|E

40|$|In {{the field}} of {{multimedia}} retrieval in video, <b>text</b> <b>frame</b> classification is essential for text detection, event detection, event boundary detection etc. We propose a new <b>text</b> <b>frame</b> classification method that introduces a combination of wavelet and median-moment with k-means clustering to select probable text blocks among 16 equally sized blocks of a video frame. The same feature combination is used with a new Max-Min Clustering at the pixel level to choose probable dominant text pixels in the selected probable text blocks. For the probable text pixels, a so-called Mutual Nearest Neighbor based Symmetry is explored with a four-quadrant formation centered at the centroid of the probable dominant text pixels to know whether a block is a true text block or not. If a frame produces at least one true text block then it is considered as a <b>text</b> <b>frame</b> otherwise it is a non-text frame. Experimental results on different text and non-text datasets including two public datasets and our own created data show that the proposed method gives promising results in terms of recall and precision at the block and frame levels. Further, we also show how existing text detection methods tend to misclassify non-text <b>frames</b> as <b>text</b> <b>frames</b> in term of recall and precision at both the block and frame levels...|$|R

40|$|The aim of <b>text</b> <b>frame</b> {{classification}} {{technique is}} to label a video <b>frame</b> as <b>text</b> or non-text before text detection and recognition. It {{is an essential}} step prior to text detection because text detection methods assume the input to be a <b>text</b> <b>frame.</b> Consequently, when a non-text frame is subjected to text detection, the precision of the text detection method decreases because of false positives. In this paper a new <b>text</b> <b>frame</b> classification approach based on component linearity is proposed. The method firstly obtains probable text clusters from the gradient values of the RGB images of an input video frame. The Sobel edges corresponding to the text cluster are then extracted and used for further processing. Next, the method proposes to eliminate false text components before undertaking a linearity check where the linearity of the text components is determined using their centroids in a piece-wise manner. If the components in a frame satisfy the defined linearity condition, then the frame is considered as a text frame; otherwise it is considered as a non-text frame. The proposed method has been tested on standard text and non-text datasets of different orientations to demonstrate that it is independent of orientation. A comparative study with the existing method shows that the proposed method is superior in terms of classification rate and processing time. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Employing {{the design}} of a prior {{experiment}} by Peleg & Alimi (2005), the present study examines how differently <b>framed</b> <b>texts</b> about the Knesset's approval of the Israeli-Palestinian 'Road Map' influence German students' assessments of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The results of the study confirmed our theoretical hypothesis that information presented in political news reports influences more than just recipients' assessments of the specifically mentioned issues. In addition, it also affects their assessments of issues related only via the structures of the mental models into which they integrate information. Moreover, the influence of political news is not uniform, but rather varies with differences in the mental models recipients have previously formed. These a priori mental models, therefore, can be more powerful predictors of media effects than variables such as recipients' political orientations, their personal views or the relevance they attribute to a conflict. ...|$|R
