5|$|Around {{one-third of}} people with {{psoriasis}} report {{a family history of}} the disease, and researchers have identified genetic loci associated with the condition. Identical twin studies suggest a 70% chance of a twin developing psoriasis <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> twin has the disorder. The risk is around 20% for nonidentical twins. These findings suggest both a genetic susceptibility and an environmental response in developing psoriasis.|$|E
5|$|The {{characters}} (and {{their individual}} stories) are grouped into three main sub-plots. Angela and Duran oppose the Dragon Emperor, Hawk and Lise oppose the Dark Prince, and Kevin and Carlie oppose the Masked Mage.

5|$|After it {{was decided}} that {{passenger}} transport on the railway was to be terminated, both NSB's bus division and other private companies, particularly Sverre Hage, wanted to have the concession to operate the line. Both established a bus services with a frequency as <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> operator did not exist. At the peak of the conflict, NSB's operations were at one point stopped by the police, although in the end, the concession was granted to them. As a response, Haga applied for concession to operate passenger transport on the railway, but this was denied by the authorities. The transfer to bus operations increased the ticket prices and travel time.|$|E
5|$|Dr. Mario {{offers a}} {{multiplayer}} gaming mode {{in which two}} players compete {{against each other in}} separate playing fields. In this mode, the player's goal is to clear their own playing field of viruses before the other player does. Eliminating multiple viruses or initiating chain reactions can cause additional capsules to fall onto the opponent's playing field. A player wins a single game upon eliminating all the viruses or <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> playing field fills up. The first player to win three games wins overall.|$|E

50|$|Judge William B. Ochiltree {{issued the}} opinion of the Court. He noted that Hiram Saddler claimed that he could not be convicted <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> indicted with him were acquitted, and that it took more than one {{individual}} to create an affray, that they had to fight by consent. Ochiltree dismissed this contention, noting that fighting by consent {{was not part of the}} offense, but fight in public was, although not all parties need consent to the fight to be involved. Even <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> were acquitted, <b>the</b> conviction against Hiram Saddler was affirmed.|$|R

5|$|Rather than a single, {{overarching}} plot, {{the story}} of Legend of Mana is composed of a multitude of quests split into three main quest arcs, numerous other quests, and a final quest arc.

Whenever the player completes the required portions of one of the quest arcs they are allowed to begin the final arc and finish the game, even <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> arcs have not yet been started or completed. The three main quest arcs prior to the final arc are: the Jumi arc, the Larc and Sierra arc, and the Matilda and Irwin arc.|$|E
5|$|The {{mayor of}} Paris is elected {{indirectly}} by Paris voters; {{the voters of}} each arrondissement elect the Conseil de Paris (Council of Paris), composed of 163 members. Each arrondissement {{has a number of}} members depending upon its population, from 10 members for each of the least-populated arrondissements (1st through 9th) to 36 members for the most populated (the 15th). The elected council members select the mayor. Sometimes the candidate who receives the most votes citywide is not selected <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> candidate has won the support of the majority of council members. Mayor Bertrand Delanoë (2001–2014) was elected by only a minority of city voters, but a majority of council members.|$|E
5|$|There {{are seven}} types of {{units in the}} game. Each unit has a set of {{statistics}} which is displayed in the interface once selected. The statistics range from combat strength, fatigue, efficiency, supply and movement points. During the game, both sides {{have the option to}} request air support {{that can be used to}} attack enemy units. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> side uses their air support, the player will be given a warning of an oncoming air strike and will have the option to retreat. The game has two endings depending on the side chosen. If playing as NATO, the main objective is to stall Soviet forces long enough until American reinforcements arrive. However, if playing as the Warsaw Pact, the objective is to destroy all NATO forces.|$|E

5|$|There {{have been}} {{subsequent}} claims by Tesla biographers that Edison and Tesla were the original recipients and that neither {{was given the}} award because of their animosity toward each other; that each sought to minimize the other's achievements and right to win the award; that both refused ever to accept the award <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> received it first; that both rejected any possibility of sharing it; and even that a wealthy Edison refused it to keep Tesla from getting the $20,000 prize money.|$|E
5|$|John Koller {{explains}} {{the role of}} intent in Jainism with {{the example of a}} monk, who unknowingly offered poisoned food to his brethren. According to the Jain view, the monk is guilty of a violent act <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> monks die because they eat the poisoned food; but according to the Buddhist view he would not be guilty. The crucial difference between the two views is that the Buddhist view excuses the act, categorising it as non-intentional, since he was not aware that the food was poisoned; whereas the Jain view holds the monk to have been responsible, due to his ignorance and carelessness. Jains argue that the monk's very ignorance and carelessness constitute an intent to do violence and hence entail his guilt. So the absence of intent does not absolve a person from the karmic consequences of guilt either, according to the Jain analysis.|$|E
5|$|Railroad-building expert Earl Vilmer {{created the}} track layout and {{operations}} for the DRR. Roger Broggie hired Vilmer because of his experience building railroads in Iran for the Allies during World War II, in France after the war, and later in Venezuela for U.S. Steel. Vilmer designed {{the operations of the}} DRR {{in such a way that}} each of its two trains would be assigned to a single station on the rail line, making only complete round trips possible. The Retlaw 1 passenger train pulled by the No. 2 locomotive only serviced Main Street, U.S.A. Station while the Retlaw 2 freight train pulled by the No. 1 locomotive only serviced Frontierland Station, and with sidings at both stations, each train would operate simultaneously and continue down the rail line even <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> train was stopped at its station. The first test run of the DRR's trains along the full length of its route occurred on July 10, 1955, one week before Disneyland's opening. The steam trains of the DRR were the first of Disneyland's attractions to become operational.|$|E

5|$|In February 1919, Gandhi cautioned the Viceroy of India with a cable {{communication}} {{that if the}} British were to pass the Rowlatt Act, he will appeal Indians to start civil disobedience. The British government ignored him, passed the law stating it will not yield to threats. The satyagraha civil disobedience followed, with people assembling to protest the Rowlatt Act. On 30 March 1919, British law officers opened fire on an assembly of unarmed people, peacefully gathered, participating in satyagraha in Delhi. People rioted in retaliation. On 6 April 1919, a Hindu festival day, he asked a crowd to remember not to injure or kill British people, but express their frustration with peace, to boycott British goods and burn any British clothing they own. He emphasised the use of non-violence to the British and towards each other, even <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> side uses violence. Communities across India announced plans to gather in greater numbers to protest. Government warned him to not enter Delhi. Gandhi defied the order. On 9 April, Gandhi was arrested. People rioted. On 13 April 1919, people including women with children gathered in an Amritsar park, and a British officer named Reginald Dyer surrounded them and ordered his troops to fire on them. The resulting Jallianwala Bagh massacre (or Amritsar massacre) of hundreds of Sikh and Hindu civilians enraged the subcontinent, but was cheered by some Britons {{and parts of the}} British media as an appropriate response. Gandhi in Ahmedabad, on the day after the massacre in Amritsar, did not criticise the British and instead criticised his fellow countrymen for not exclusively using love to deal with the hate of the British government. Gandhi demanded that people stop all violence, stop all property destruction, and went on fast-to-death to pressure Indians to stop their rioting.|$|E
