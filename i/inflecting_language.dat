25|$|Latvian is an <b>inflecting</b> <b>language</b> {{with many}} {{analytical}} forms. Primary word stress, {{with a few}} exceptions, is on the first syllable. There are no articles in Latvian, however definiteness is expressed by inflection of adjectives. Basic word order in Latvian is subject–verb–object; however, word order is relatively free.|$|E
25|$|Interslavic is an <b>inflecting</b> <b>language.</b> Nouns {{can have}} three genders, two numbers (singular and plural), {{as well as}} six cases (nominative, accusative, genitive, dative, {{instrumental}} and locative). Since several Slavic languages also have a vocative, it is usually displayed in tables as well, even though strictly speaking the vocative is not a case. It occurs only in the singular of masculine and feminine nouns.|$|E

50|$|It is {{important}} to distinguish the paradigm of a lexeme from a morphological pattern. In {{the context of an}} <b>inflecting</b> <b>language,</b> an inflectional morphological pattern is not the explicit list of inflected forms. A morphological pattern usually references a prototypical class of inflectional forms, e.g. ring as per sing. In contrast, the paradigm of a lexeme is the explicit list of the inflected forms of the given lexeme (e.g. to ring, rang, rung). Said in other terms, this is the difference between a description in intension (a morphological pattern) and a description in extension (a paradigm).|$|E

5000|$|This {{artificial}} {{approach to}} the Dutch language remained the prevailing practice through the 17th and 18th centuries, but attitudes began {{to change in the}} 19th century. The rigidity of the written language was satirized in 1865 by Jacob van Lennep in his De vermakelijke spraakkunst, in which he noticed that the case system was hardly used in spoken language. The practice of approaching Dutch {{as if it were a}} classical, <b>inflecting</b> <b>language</b> comparable to Latin and Greek was gradually abandoned in the 19th century, and it was recognized that word order played a far greater role in defining grammatical relationships. R.A. Kollewijn (1857-1942) advocated radical spelling reforms for the whole of the Dutch language, at a time when a rather extensive case system was maintained in the written language by the De Vries-Te Winkel spelling. The table below shows the conventions of the written language in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Only the [...] "strong" [...] inflection is shown here.|$|E
40|$|The use of {{properties}} of the Swedish language when indexing newspaper articles improves clustering results. To show this a clustering algorithm was implemented and language specific tools were used when building {{the representation of the}} articles. Since Swedish is an <b>inflecting</b> <b>language</b> many words have different forms. Thus two documents compared based on word occurrence (i. e. the vector space model and cosine measure of Information Retrieval) do not necessarily become similar although containing the same word(s). To overcome this we have used a stemmer. Compounds are regularly formed as one word in Swedish. Hence indexing on words leaves the information in the components of compounds unused. We use the spell checking program Stava to split compounds into their components. Newspapers sort their articles into sections such as Economy, Domestic, Sports etc. Using these we calculate entropy for the clusterings and use as a measure of quality. We have found that stemming improves clustering results on our collections by about 4 % compared to not using it. Compound splitting improves results by about 10 % (by 13 % in combination with stemming). Keeping the original compounds in the representation does not improve results. ...|$|E

40|$|Inflectional {{classes are}} a {{property}} of the ideal inflecting-fusional language type. Thus strongly <b>inflecting</b> <b>languages</b> have the most complex vertical and horizontal stratification of hierarchical tree structures. Weakly <b>inflecting</b> <b>languages</b> which also approach the ideal isolating type or languages which also approach the agglutinating type have much shallower structures. Such properties follow from principles of Natural Morphology and from the distinction of the descendent hierarchy of macroclasses, classes, subclasses, subsubclasses etc. and homogeneous microclasses. The main languages of illustration are Latin, Lithuanian, Russian, German, French, Finnish, Hungarian and Turkis...|$|R

40|$|We {{describe}} an automatic paraphrase-inference procedure for a highly <b>inflected</b> <b>language</b> like Arabic. Paraphrases {{are derived from}} comparable documents, that is, distinct documents dealing with the same topic. A co-training approach is taken, with two classifiers, one designed to model the contexts surrounding occurrences of paraphrases, and the other trained to identify significant features of the words within paraphrases. In particular, we use morpho-syntactic features calculated for both classifiers, as {{is to be expected}} when working with highly <b>inflected</b> <b>languages.</b> We provide some experimental results for Arabic, and for the simpler English, which we find to be encouraging. Our immediate interest is to incorporate such paraphrases within an Arabic-to-English translation system...|$|R
5000|$|There {{are four}} moods in Icelandic: indicative, imperative, conditional, and subjunctive. As with most <b>inflected</b> <b>languages,</b> the verbs in Icelandic {{determine}} (or govern) {{the case of}} the subsequent nouns, pronouns and adjectives of a sentence. For example: ...|$|R
