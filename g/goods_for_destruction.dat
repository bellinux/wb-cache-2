40|$|This article {{attempted}} to respond pastorally to the rainmaking and rain prevention rituals which are practised among the Pedi tribes – {{also called the}} Northern-Sotho speaking nation of South Africa. The rituals of rainmaking and rain prevention have been practised among the Pedi {{for a long time}} – these rituals are in fact still being practised in some of the villages in and around the Limpopo Province. The rituals are practised in time of drought and also during activities such as weddings or traditional gatherings, this is normally called molato. When the village is experiencing drought, community members, upon instruction from the chief of the village, stage a rain ritual and the moroka [rain making traditional doctor] would take the lead in performing such rituals. Families would also perform rain prevention rituals when a gathering or a wedding is being organised to ensure that the rain does not disturb the gathering and everything goes as planned. Thus the purpose of rainfall rituals is to influence the weather conditions in order to cause rain or drought either <b>for</b> <b>good</b> or <b>for</b> <b>destruction.</b> The mentioned rituals and selected scriptural passages were discussed. This article presented the biblical view of rain and conclusion principles were formulated to understand the Bible’s perspective on the mentioned rituals. These conclusions were used for the formulation of practical guidelines. [URL]...|$|R

5000|$|In an {{interview}} with Pitchfork, drummer Dave Prowse cited Appetite <b>for</b> <b>Destruction</b> as a specific influence on the album's sequencing. Rather than having a traditional ‘Side A’ and ‘Side B’ structure, Appetite <b>For</b> <b>Destruction</b> is split into ‘G’ and ‘R’ sides: the former 'Gun' side dealing with violence and debauchery (‘Welcome To The Jungle’, ‘Paradise City’), while the latter 'Roses' side focused on love and sex (‘Sweet Child o' Mine’, ‘Rocket Queen’). As King further explained, [...] "We had this idea of the album having two sides, where Appetite <b>For</b> <b>Destruction</b> ‘Side A’ is super-intense and ‘Side B’ is softer and poppier." ...|$|R

50|$|With such a {{disastrous}} failure, Anakin decides upon a desperate measure {{by which he}} and a small attack group of two troop transports fly directly to within the ICC to rescue the hostages. Anakin in his element destroys almost all droids in his path, leaving the troops behind him in awe and with nothing to shoot at. Reaching the hostages, Anakin is shocked as a woman reminds him {{so much of his}} mother. As she is killed we see Anakin become an avenger, treading perilously close to the Dark Side of the Force. Jedi Master Nejaa Halcyon, as well as Grand Master Yoda and indeed Darth Sidious feel the disturbances in the force at this, though only one yet understands their meaning. Anakin's rampage only ends before murdering Pors Tonith, as he hears Qui-Gon Jinn's voice reaching him through the Force, telling him to use the Force <b>for</b> <b>good</b> not <b>destruction.</b> Although Anakin initially brings himself out of his rage, we can tell it is only suppressed to be brought out later once again.|$|R
