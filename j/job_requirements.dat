Using data consisting of 311 employee–supervisor pairs from two companies in China, we found that perceived innovation <b>job</b> <b>requirement</b> had a more positive relation with innovative behavior for employees with low intrinsic interest in innovation than for those with high intrinsic interest. In addition, this positive effect for low-intrinsic-interest employees was achieved only when these employees interpreted the <b>job</b> <b>requirement</b> as important either because performance-reward expectancy was high or because perceived value for the organization was high.
