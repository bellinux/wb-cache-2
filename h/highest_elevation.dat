5|$|The most {{prominent}} geographical feature, at the <b>highest</b> <b>elevation</b> in the park, is the mountain range Cordillera de Tarros. This mountain has several caves {{and is the}} origin of several streams. Elevations inside the park range between 1550 and 3500 meters above sea level.|$|E
5|$|The <b>highest</b> <b>elevation</b> forests contain whitebark pine, Engelmann spruce, subalpine fir, and limber pine, {{including}} the largest individual whitebark pine in North America. Based on tree ring chronologies, {{some of the}} whitebark pines {{are believed to be}} 700 to 1000 or more years old. The <b>highest</b> <b>elevation</b> forests typically have understories of grasses and forbs that are resistant to freezing at any point of the growing season. Willows, alders, cottonwoods, and sedges are found in riparian areas. Ponderosa pine occupy the dry, lower elevations near {{the western edge of the}} forest and historically persisted due to the occurrence of frequent non-lethal fires. Ponderosa pine forest understories typically consist of perennial grasses such as Idaho fescue and bluebunch wheatgrass. In the slightly moister ponderosa pine forests grasses such as pinegrass are found with a cover of shrubs including white spirea, common snowberry, and mallow ninebark.|$|E
5|$|State Highway 82 {{traverses}} it, in {{the process}} reaching the <b>highest</b> <b>elevation</b> of a paved Colorado state highway on a through road. After Cottonwood Pass to the south, it is the second-highest pass with an improved road in the state, the fourth-highest paved road {{in the state and}} the highest paved crossing of the Continental Divide in the U.S. Because of the heavy snowfall at its elevation, it is closed in wintertime, isolating Aspen from direct access from the east during the ski season.|$|E

40|$|Low {{levels of}} {{background}} radiation exist around us continuously. These levels increase with increasing land elevation, allowing {{a comparison of}} low <b>elevations</b> to <b>high</b> <b>elevations</b> in regard to an outcome such as cancer death rates. The present study compares archived cancer mortality rates in six low versus six <b>high</b> <b>elevation</b> jurisdictions. The study also compares mortality rates for all causes, heart disease, and diabetes in low versus <b>high</b> <b>elevation</b> jurisdictions {{in an effort to}} see if other mortality outcomes are different in low versus <b>high</b> <b>elevations.</b> Statistically significant decreases in mortality, with very large effect sizes, were observed in <b>high</b> land <b>elevation</b> for three of the four outcomes, including cancer. One possible explanation for the decreased mortality in <b>high</b> <b>elevation</b> jurisdictions is radiation hormesis. Another possible explanation, at least in the case of heart disease mortality, is the physiologic responses that accompany <b>higher</b> <b>elevations</b> regarding decreased oxygen levels. Since this is an ecological study, no causal inferences can be made, particularly when viewpoints on possible effects of low level radiation are diametrically opposed. Further research is indicated...|$|R
50|$|Further {{examples}} of mesic habitats include streamsides, wet meadows, springs, seeps, irrigated fields, and <b>high</b> <b>elevation</b> habitats. These habitats effectively provide drought insurance as land at <b>higher</b> <b>elevations</b> warm due to seasonal or other change.|$|R
5|$|The four-lane {{divided highway}} passes through three major urban centres of Saskatchewan, Regina, Moose Jaw and Swift Current. A {{site in the}} Western Hemisphere Shorebird Reserve Network, an internationally {{acclaimed}} shorebird conservation strategy, is at the village of Chaplin approximately equal distance between Swift Current and Moose Jaw. Located southwest of the Trans–Canada is the Cypress Hills Interprovincial Park, which features Fort Walsh and the <b>highest</b> <b>elevation</b> of Saskatchewan. Highway 1 traverses ranch lands, the Missouri Coteau topographical area, and rolling prairie agricultural plains.|$|E
5|$|A short overlap carries SR57 {{traffic on}} the same roadway as SR60. The two routes head {{northeast}} through {{an arm of the}} San Gabriel Valley; after they split, SR57 ascends slightly and then slopes through the edge of the Puente Hills and into the west end of the Pomona Valley. Here it meets the San Bernardino Freeway (I-10) and Chino Valley Freeway (SR 71) at the four-level Kellogg Hill Interchange. In the north half of that interchange, SR57 enters the San Jose Hills, climbing to its <b>highest</b> <b>elevation</b> before descending back into the connected San Gabriel and Pomona Valleys and ending at the Glendora Curve interchange with the Foothill Freeway (I-210) in Glendora.|$|E
5|$|Sibu town {{is located}} near the Rajang delta at the {{confluence}} of Rajang and Igan rivers. Peat swamp forests and alluvial plains are particularly prevalent in the Sibu Division. The Sibu town is located on a deep peat soil. This has caused problems in infrastructure development because buildings and roads will slowly sink into the ground after its construction completion. The location of Sibu in lowland peat swamps have subjected it to frequent floods which was about 1 to 3 times per year. Therefore, Sibu Flood Mitigation project was started to relieve the area from the floods. The <b>highest</b> <b>elevation</b> in Sibu is a peak at Bukit Aup Jubilee Park measuring 59 m above sea level.|$|E
50|$|There is some {{variation}} in both rainfall throughout Eastern Washington. Generally, lower elevations are both hotter and drier than <b>higher</b> <b>elevations.</b> This is easily {{seen in the}} comparison between low-elevation Richland with <b>higher</b> <b>elevation</b> Spokane.|$|R
50|$|The climate {{varies from}} humid {{continental}} {{in the north}} to humid subtropical in the south. Summers are hot at lower <b>elevations,</b> warm at <b>higher</b> <b>elevations.</b> Winters are cold at <b>higher</b> <b>elevations</b> and cool at lower elevations.|$|R
50|$|Temperatures are {{expected}} to rise more than average in higher latitudes and at <b>higher</b> <b>elevations.</b> Animals living at lower elevations could migrate to <b>higher</b> <b>elevations</b> in response to climate change as temperatures rises. Whereas animals in <b>higher</b> <b>elevations</b> will eventually ‘run out of mountain’. “Results confirmed that protected large-scale elevation gradients retain diversity by allowing species to migrate in response to climate and vegetation change. The long-recognized importance of protecting landscapes has never been greater"(Moritz 2008).|$|R
5|$|The National Weather Service {{forecast}} office in Gray, Maine, operates NOAA Weather Radio station KZZ41 on 162.5MHz {{from the summit}} of Mount Washington. Due to its point as the <b>highest</b> <b>elevation</b> in the Northeast and the frequency range NWR broadcasts on, the station can be heard at very far distances. It has been heard in northwest Vermont (at Vergennes), much of western Maine, and northern Massachusetts (at Dracut and Salisbury, the latter of which had clear reception). Based on the official NWS coverage area map, it can be heard clearly throughout most of New Hampshire, western Maine, northeast Vermont, and portions of southern Canada. During very clear conditions, KZZ41 {{has the potential to}} reach the majority of northern Massachusetts (including some northern areas of Greater Boston and much of the North Shore) as well as the majority of Vermont and Maine.|$|E
5|$|The {{southern}} {{group of}} islands surrounds Scapa Flow. Hoy {{is the second}} largest of the Orkney Isles and Ward Hill at its northern end is the <b>highest</b> <b>elevation</b> in the archipelago. The Old Man of Hoy is a well-known seastack. Burray lies {{to the east of}} Scapa Flow and is linked by causeway to South Ronaldsay, which hosts the cultural events, the Festival of the Horse and the Boys' Ploughing Match on the third Saturday in August. It is also the location of the Neolithic Tomb of the Eagles. Graemsay and Flotta are both linked by ferry to the Mainland and Hoy, and the latter is known for its large oil terminal. South Walls has a 19th-century Martello tower and is connected to Hoy by the Ayre. South Ronaldsay, Burray, Glims Holm, and Lamb Holm are connected by road to the Mainland by the Churchill Barriers.|$|E

40|$|QUESTIONS : The {{richness}} of invasive alien plant species tends to {{decrease with increasing}} elevation. This pattern {{may be due to}} alien plant species requiring traits allowing survival at <b>high</b> <b>elevations</b> (the Abiotic Limitation Hypothesis; ALH). In contrast, the more recent Directional Ecological Filtering Hypothesis (DEFH) suggests that only species with broad environmental tolerances will successfully spread from lowlands (where most introductions occur) to <b>high</b> <b>elevations.</b> Here we test the support for the DEFH and the ALH along an elevational gradient by asking: First, are alien species that occur at <b>higher</b> <b>elevations</b> generalists? Second, do alien species occurring at <b>higher</b> <b>elevations</b> exhibit traits that distinguishes them from lowland alien species? LOCATION : Sani Pass, Maloti-Drakensberg Transfrontier Conservation Area, South Africa. METHODS : A nestedness analysis was conducted to test whether alien species were nested along the elevational gradient, and ANOVA and Chi 2 tests (supplemented by resampling procedures) were used to determine if functional traits differed between <b>high</b> and low <b>elevation</b> alien species. RESULTS : Significant nestedness of the alien flora indicates that alien species occurring at <b>high</b> <b>elevations</b> are generalists, being widespread across the elevational gradient. Compared to low elevation aliens, plant height was lower and cold tolerance weaker for <b>high</b> <b>elevation</b> species. CONCLUSION : We found support for the DEFH with the majority of <b>high</b> <b>elevation</b> aliens being widespread generalists. Overall only two of the 11 functional traits differed between <b>high</b> and low <b>elevation</b> alien species, with only one trait supporting the ALH: shorter plant stature found at <b>higher</b> <b>elevations.</b> Therefore, complementing nestedness analyses with trait data provides a more nuanced insight into the determinants of alien richness patterns along elevational gradients and highlights how the two contemporary hypotheses might not be mutually exclusive.

30|$|The GLTs at {{northern}} Taiwan and <b>high</b> <b>elevations</b> were {{assumed to have}} floristic similarities with temperate ecoregions. However, the assumption is not supported by our analysis. The results of floristic similarity and clustering analysis both concluded floristic dissimilarity among GLTs at <b>higher</b> <b>elevations</b> and ecoregions at higher latitudes in Asia continent. Although some angiosperms in GLTs at <b>higher</b> <b>elevation</b> are observed in higher latitudes, they are not dominant members. A further examination on the floristic lists of GLTs demonstrated that angiosperms with tropical and subtropical distributions (Group B, C, D, E, F) extend their distribution ranges from low to <b>high</b> <b>elevations</b> in Taiwan (see later texts). This is most likely the explanation of the low floristic similarity between Taiwan and temperate ecoregions in Asian continent.|$|R
