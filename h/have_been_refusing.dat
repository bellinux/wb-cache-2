50|$|Bangladesh Government {{claims that}} {{incidents}} of crossfire deaths {{are the result}} of law enforcement officers acting in self-defence. The narrative of the Government comes in either of the following 2 forms: (1) the deceased was caught in crossfire that erupted after miscreants had started shooting at the police, (2) after being challenged by a patrolling police team, few suspected armed persons on motor bikes opened fire; deceased died in the gunfight and few others fled. However, rights group <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>refusing</b> to believe the police version of the crossfire incidents. They have long accused Bangladesh's security forces, especially the elite law enforcement agency Rapid Action Battalion, of arbitrarily picking up people, torturing them, and then killing them in custody. When suspects are shown to journalists, they often wear a bulletproof vest. But, while taking them to raids to arrest their accomplices, the criminals are routinely without any such vest. Media usually reports these incidents as crossfire within quotation marks.|$|E

Companies and individuals have found {{it increasingly difficult to}} borrow money. Investors and pension holders have seen the value of their assets collapse, and government intervention has been largely counterproductive, making matters worse and turning a financial crisis into an economic catastrophe. As the bailouts continue and calls for more regulation are heard around the world, Stacey and Morris review the origins of the crisis and consider which policies might better address the underlying problems. They recommend reducing the regulatory burdens that contributed to the crisis. ‘If financial markets were governed by simple, clear rules, there would be less incentive for regulatory arbitrage and more incentive to generate innovations that create genuine benefits for people. ...|$|E
