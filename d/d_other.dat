25|$|Malnutrition, {{parenteral}} nutrition and malabsorption {{can lead to}} osteoporosis. Nutritional and gastrointestinal disorders that can predispose to osteoporosis include undiagnosed and untreated coeliac disease (both symptomatic and asymptomatic people), Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, cystic fibrosis, surgery (after gastrectomy, intestinal bypass surgery or bowel resection) and severe liver disease (especially primary biliary cirrhosis). People with lactose intolerance or milk allergy may develop osteoporosis due to restrictions of calcium-containing foods. Individuals with bulimia can also develop osteoporosis. Those with an otherwise adequate calcium intake can develop osteoporosis due to the inability to absorb calcium and/or vitamin <b>D.</b> <b>Other</b> micronutrients such as vitamin K or vitamin B12 deficiency may also contribute.|$|E

2500|$|To {{effectively}} {{convert a}} Lehmer code d'n, d'n−1, ..., d2, d1 into {{a permutation of}} an ordered set S, one can start {{with a list of}} the elements of S in increasing order, and for i increasing from 1 to n set σ'i to the element in the list that is preceded by d'n+1−i other ones, and remove that element from the list. To convert an inversion table d'n, d'n−1, ..., d2, d1 into the corresponding permutation, one can traverse the numbers from d1 to d'n while inserting the elements of S from largest to smallest into an initially empty sequence; at the step using the number d from the inversion table, the element from S inserted into the sequence at the point where it is preceded by d elements already present. Alternatively one could process the numbers from the inversion table and the elements of S both in the opposite order, starting with a row of n empty slots, and at each step place the element from S into the empty slot that is preceded by <b>d</b> <b>other</b> empty slots.|$|E
