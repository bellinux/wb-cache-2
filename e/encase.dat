5|$|Over {{the years}} after her sinking, many impractical, {{expensive}} and often physically impossible schemes have been put forward to raise Titanic from her resting place. They have included ideas such as filling the wreck with ping-pong balls, injecting it with 180,000 tons of Vaseline, or using half a million tons of liquid nitrogen to <b>encase</b> it inside a giant iceberg that would float back to the surface. However, the wreck is far too fragile to be raised and is now protected by a UNESCO convention.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{deterioration}} of the wood of the exterior balconies over time, Queen RanavalonaII commissioned James Cameron to reinforce and <b>encase</b> the original structure in a stone shell in 1867. Cameron's exterior replaced the wooden balconies with stone walls three stories high. On each of the three floors, seven arched windows run the length of the two longer side walls while five windows illuminate the shorter front and back walls. A square tower stands at each of the four corners of the stone shell, extending above the level of the walls and forming their junction. A clock and bells were installed in the north-eastern tower.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the mid-19th}} century, all houses and marketplaces in Antananarivo, and {{throughout}} Madagascar, were constructed of woods, grasses, reeds and other plant-based materials viewed as appropriate for structures {{used by the}} living. Only family tombs were built from stone, an inert material viewed as appropriate to use for the dead. British missionaries introduced brick-making to the island in the 1820s, and French industrialist Jean Laborde used stone and brick to build his factories {{over the next few}} decades. It was not until the royal edict on construction materials was lifted in the 1860s that stone was used to <b>encase</b> the royal palace. Many aristocrats, inspired by the royal palace and the two-story, brick houses with wrapped verandas and divided interior spaces built by British missionaries, copied the British model for their own large homes in the haute ville. The model, known as trano gasy ("Malagasy house"), rapidly spread throughout the central highlands of Madagascar, where it remains the predominant house construction style.|$|E

5|$|On February 29, 1960, the New York City Transit Authority (NYCTA) {{began to}} test a new tie-less roadbed on Track 1, which had been {{installed}} since the previous Thursday. The experiment was intended to produce a smoother and more comfortable ride for commuters, in addition to lessening the effect of moisture and erosion. It was planned that if the test succeeded, {{the rest of the}} tracks in the subway system would be retrofitted in such a manner. The set-up included two parallel strips of concrete that would serve as the roadbed. Between them, flat-bottomed steel troughs were installed, cushioned by rubber. Inside the troughs, there were rubber tie plates spaced apart with flaps that <b>encase</b> the rail bottom. The rails were kept in place by lug bolts that were anchored in concrete. The third rail was also mounted on concrete. This differed from the normal roadbeds, which consisted of stone, with wooden ties set into it. The ties, under damp conditions, would rot and the spikes would become loose, resulting in bumpy rides. This test replicated similar roadbeds in Toronto's subway system. In order to construct the new roadbed, Track 1 had to be closed. From May 6 to June 5, 1961, Track 4 was closed for the installation of the same roadbed as was tested on Track 1.|$|E

25|$|The Native Americans {{used two}} kinds of knife traps. One method was to <b>encase</b> a sharp blade in fat and frozen upright on a block of ice. The wolf would cut itself while licking the blade and bleed to death. Some argue that this method is a myth. The other method was a baited torsion spring which when triggered, would stab the wolf in the head.|$|E
25|$|Upper {{extremity}} casts {{are those}} which <b>encase</b> the arm, wrist, and/or hand. A long arm cast encases the arm from the hand to about 2inches below the arm pit, leaving the fingers and thumbs free. A short arm cast, in contrast, stops {{just below the}} elbow. Both varieties may, depending on the injury and the doctor's decision, include one or more fingers or the thumb, in which case it is called a finger spica or thumb spica cast.|$|E
25|$|Mutton {{and pork}} were more common. Poultry, both wild and {{domestic}} and fish {{were available to}} {{all but the most}} destitute. The alternative protein sources would rather have been legumes, eggs, cheese and the amino acids available in the tandem staples of bread and beer. Mice and hedgehogs were also eaten and a common way to cook the latter was to <b>encase</b> a hedgehog in clay and bake it. When the clay was then cracked open and removed, it took the prickly spikes with it.|$|E
40|$|The {{past few}} decades have seen {{outstanding}} advances {{in the use of}} composite materials in structural applications. There can be little doubt that, within engineering circles, composites have revolutionized traditional design concepts and made possible an unparalleled range of new and exciting possibilities as viable materials for construction. In addition to the well-known advantages of composite columns, partially <b>encased</b> composite columns offered simplified beam-to-column connection as well as reduced or omitted shuttering thus achieved more cost effective construction. Some companies have patented these new types of partially <b>encased</b> composite column made of light welded steel shapes; moreover, the Canadian Institute of Steel construction CISC has recognized and codified this type of columns. In This paper, Partially <b>Encased</b> Composite Beam Columns is introduced; experimental studies are made on five partially <b>encased</b> beam columns to investigate the behavior of eccentrically loaded partially <b>encased</b> composite columns using different parameters...|$|R

25|$|Caudal: The {{upper and}} lower jaws are covered with sensory pits, visible as small, black {{speckles}} on the skin, the crocodilian version of the lateral line organs seen in fish and many amphibians, though arising from a completely different origin. These pigmented nodules <b>encase</b> bundles of nerve fibers innervated beneath by branches of the trigeminal nerve. They respond to the slightest disturbance in surface water, detecting vibrations and small pressure changes {{as small as a}} single drop. This makes it possible for crocodiles to detect prey, danger and intruders, even in total darkness. These sense organs are known as domed pressure receptors (DPRs).|$|E

The wall between the exo-narthex and {{the body of the}} original church is of limestone. The great wall that defines the western boundary of the current church is made up of red bricks which <b>encase</b> the original columns and arches. This now is covered with a cream-color stucco layer. The four arches carrying the squinches of the central, original, sanctuary dome are also made up of red bricks except for the one toward the east which is of marble construction.|$|E
25|$|A {{distinguishing}} feature {{that marks the}} Star Sapphires as unique among their peers, in Green Lantern and Green Lantern Corps, is their use of conversion crystals. While other Corps exclusively recruit their members by sending out their rings in search of sentient beings, the Star Sapphires are also shown as being able to convert other Corps members into Star Sapphires. By encasing the members of other Corps within violet rehabilitation crystals on Zamaron, the light of their rings is slowly transformed into violet, whereupon they emerge as newly formed Star Sapphires, such as Yrra Cynril (Fatality). Similarly, violet power rings also momentarily <b>encase</b> new members to the Corps in crystal before granting them their Star Sapphire abilities and uniform. Those imprisoned within the crystals can be freed by an outside force, or free themselves if sufficiently motivated, interrupting the transformation process before it's complete.|$|E

25|$|During a mission, Eren is {{swallowed}} by a Titan when he sacrifices himself {{to save his}} friend Armin Arlert. Inside the Titan, however, he suddenly transforms into a 15-meter class Titan that attacks the other Titans and disregards humans before the Titan collapses and his real body is exposed, unconscious, {{at the back of}} the neck. Though he is distrusted initially by the military, especially due to his inability to control himself in Titan form, Eren earns a place in the Special Operations Squad, a branch of Survey Corps under Levi assigned to watch over him. Shortly after joining, Eren finds himself hunted by a female Titan who kills all of his squadmates to get to him.

Though Eren defeats Annie alongside his allies, they are unable to get answers as they watch her <b>encase</b> herself using her Titan's hardening ability.|$|E
25|$|While New Super Mario Bros. Wii is a 2D platformer, {{some of the}} {{characters}} and objects are 3D polygonal renderings on 2D backgrounds, resulting in a 2.5D effect (also seen in New Super Mario Bros.) that visually simulates 3D computer graphics. Players can play as either Mario, his brother Luigi or two Toad characters: one blue and one yellow (with the first player always as Mario). Controls {{are similar to those}} of New Super Mario Bros., albeit with the added abilities of spinning in mid-air by shaking the Wii Remote; and picking up, carrying, and throwing other players. The game does not feature online multiplayer. In multiplayer mode, there can be up to four players simultaneously. If players lose a life, but have at least one life in reserve, they will re-emerge encased inside a bubble, and can resume play once another player frees them by touching the bubble or tossing a fire ball, ice ball or Koopa shell (the player can shake the Wii Remote to move their bubble closer to an active player, but they cannot free themselves). If players lose a life and do not have any more lives, they must use a Continue and start over from their last save point with five lives left. Players can also <b>encase</b> themselves inside the bubble by pressing the A button while a more skilled player traverses a difficult segment. If every character in a co-op session enters a bubble at the same time (whether through death or by pressing the A button), they will lose the level and must restart.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a study of}} the influence of the geotextile encasement on the behaviour of soft soils improved with fully penetrating <b>encased</b> columns. This influence is analysed by means of measuring soil-column stress distribution, pore pressures and soil deformation during the consolidation process. For this purpose, a horizontal slice of a representative “unit cell” has been analysed by means of small-scale laboratory tests. The tests were carried out in a large instrumented Rowe-Barden oedometric cell. Results showed that the vertical stress supported by <b>encased</b> columns is about 1. 7 times that sustained by the non-encased ones. The stress concentration factor for <b>encased</b> columns is between 11 and 25, which is clearly higher than that obtained in tests with non-encased columns, which are between 3 and 6. Finally, the improvement in relation to settlements is presented by the ratio of settlement in soils reinforced with ordinary or <b>encased</b> columns and the settlement of non-treated soft soil. This settlement reduction factor is around 0. 6 when the soil is treated with <b>encased</b> columns and 0. 8 for soil with non-encased columns...|$|R
