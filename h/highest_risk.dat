5|$|Argentina's geomorphic {{characteristics}} {{make the}} country highly vulnerable to floods. These floods can damage infrastructure, cause loss of life, {{increase the risk of}} diseases, and negatively impact agricultural productivity, {{which is one of the}} main economic activities of the country. Many of the large Argentinean cities and agriculturally productive areas lie near rivers. The plains are at <b>highest</b> <b>risk</b> for flooding, particularly in the northeastern and central parts of the country, including Greater Buenos Aires. This is because these plains, which cover 35% of the land area in the country (including the Chaco and Pampean areas), are characterized by a flat landscape, which can impede proper water drainage. Both the Parana and Paraguay basins have a flat landscape and are thus highly susceptible to flooding due to river overflows following high rainfall. These floods can last for months, particularly in the Parana River, owing to its large basin. In the most extreme case, during the year 1982–1983, the floods in the Parana River persisted for more than a year, negatively impacting the area both socially and economically. Major flooding events in the Parana River include those of 1992 and 1997 and have been more frequent since the 1980s due to higher precipitation trends. Similarly, in Buenos Aires Province, flooding occurs due to river overflows and poor water drainage; major flooding events in the province occurred in 1987, 2002/2003, 2012 and in 2014, causing damage to agriculture production. Most of the flooding events occur in El Niño years owing to higher rainfall. Flooding can also affect Patagonia and urban centers in the northwest, but the number of people affected and economic losses are lower than those in the Pampas owing to lower population densities. Flooding can jeopardize access to safe water. A leptospirosis outbreak occurred following a flood in 1998.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>High</b> <b>risk</b> {{medications}} {{are commonly}} prescribed to older US patients. Currently, less {{is known about}} <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> medication prescribing in other Western Countries, including the UK. We measured trends and correlates of <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> medication prescribing in {{a subset of the}} older UK population (community/institutionalized) to inform harm minimization efforts. METHODS: Three cross-sectional samples from primary care electronic clinical records (UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink, CPRD) in fiscal years 2003 / 04, 2007 / 08 and 2011 / 12 were taken. This yielded a sample of 13, 900 people aged 65  years or over from 504 UK general practices. <b>High</b> <b>risk</b> medications were defined by 2012 Beers Criteria adapted for the UK. Using descriptive statistical methods and regression modelling, prevalence of 'any' (drugs prescribed at least once per year) and 'long-term' (drugs prescribed all quarters of year) <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> medication prescribing and correlates were determined. RESULTS: While polypharmacy rates have risen sharply, <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> medication prevalence has remained stable across a decade. A third of older (65 +) people are exposed to <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> medications, but only half of the total prevalence was long-term (any[*]=[*] 38. 4  % [95  % CI: 36. 3, 40. 5]; long-term[*]=[*] 17. 4  % [15. 9, 19. 9] in 2011 / 12). Long-term but not any <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> medication exposure was associated with older ages (85  years or over). Women and people with higher polypharmacy burden were at greater risk of exposure; lower socio-economic status was not associated. Ten drugs/drug classes accounted for most of <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> medication prescribing in 2011 / 12. CONCLUSIONS: <b>High</b> <b>risk</b> medication prescribing has not increased over time against a background of increasing polypharmacy in the UK. Half of patients receiving <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> medications do so for less than a year. Reducing or optimising the use of a limited number of drugs could dramatically reduce <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> medications in older people. Further research is needed to investigate why the oldest old and women are at greater risk. Interventions to reduce <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> medications may need to target shorter and long-term use separately...|$|R
