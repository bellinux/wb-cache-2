5|$|Stafford Meadow Brook {{has very}} high water quality as far {{downstream}} {{as the old}} Lackawanna and Wyoming Valley Railroad corridor. The stream has received little impact from development above the Williams Bridge Reservoir. However, its banks are affected by urban debris such as yard waste {{in some parts of}} its lower reaches. Municipal sewers also sometimes overflow <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>stream</b> during rainy conditions. The borough of Moosic has a permit to discharge stormwater <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>stream.</b>|$|E
5|$|Roaring Brook has a {{high level}} of water quality {{downstream}} as far as Cobbs Gap. However, in its lower reaches, it is impacted by urban storm impacts and abandoned mining land. Silt from the DeNaples Auto Parts property washed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>stream</b> in 1991. There are also stormwater impacts and combined sewer overflows in its lower reaches. Most of the stormwater flowing <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>stream</b> is associated with a combined sewer system in Scranton and Dunmore. Some highways in the watershed contribute stormwater as well. It is also affected by stormwater from the Daleville Shopping area, the village of Elmhurst, the borough of Moscow, Pennsylvania Route 435, Pennsylvania Route 590, and Pennsylvania Route 690. There are 12 stormwater detention facilities in the watershed's lower reaches.|$|E
5|$|Spring Brook {{provided}} {{power for}} early lumbering in Spring Brook Township, Lackawanna County. In the early 1900s, the main {{industries in the}} watershed of Spring Brook included coal mining and agriculture. The Pennsylvania Coal Company historically had a washery that discharged <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>stream.</b> The Du Pont Powder Company also operated in the watershed at that time. A railroad line along the stream was present by the 1880s. The Wilkes-Barre and Eastern Railroad also crossed the stream's watershed and the Scranton and Spring Brook Railroad followed the stream between Rockdale and its mouth. During this time period, major communities in the watershed included Moosic, which had a population of 3964 at the time. The main stem and several tributaries were also historically used as a water supply by the Spring Brook Water Supply Company. The stream is still used as an important water supply in the Lackawanna Valley, as of 2001. Together with Roaring Brook and Stafford Meadow Brook, {{it serves as a}} water supply to a substantial part of the valley. Some areas of the watershed have been subjected to extensive timbering programs as recently as 2001. The Nesbitt Water Filtration Plant is in the watershed, in Pittston Township, Luzerne County. It is owned by the Pennsylvania American Water Company.|$|E

25|$|Only one {{community}} along the creek, {{the village of}} Warsaw, uses it as a water supply, putting it through a filtration plant before distributing it to residents and other customers. Its wastewater treatment plant is downstream of the intake. Le Roy and Scottsville also have state permits to discharge effluent <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>stream</b> from their wastewater plants, along with the Lapp Insulators plant in Le Roy and the fish hatchery in Caledonia (via the Spring Creek tributary). The latter has the highest permitted discharge of any permit in the Oatka watershed. The villages of Caledonia and Wyoming, and one of Pavilion's water districts, use wells in the watershed.|$|E
40|$|The data {{collection}} of Acoustic Emission (AE) method is typically based on threshold-dependent approach, where the AE system acquires data when {{the output of}} AE sensor is above the pre-defined threshold. However, this approach fails to detect flaws in noisy environment, as the signal level of noise may overcome the signal level of AE from flaws, and saturate the AE system. Time-dependent approach is based on streaming waveforms and extracting features at every pre-defined time interval. It is hypothesized that the relevant AE signals representing active flaws are embedded <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>streamed</b> signals. In this study, a decomposition method of <b>the</b> <b>streamed</b> AE signals to separate noise signal and crack signal is demonstrated. The AE signals representing fatigue crack growth in steel are obtained from the laboratory scale testing. <b>The</b> <b>streamed</b> AE signals in a noisy operational condition are obtained from the gearbox testing at the Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) facility. The signal addition and decomposition is achieved to determine the minimum detectable {{signal to noise ratio}} that is embedded <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>streamed</b> AE signals. <b>The</b> developed decomposition approach is demonstrated on detecting burst signals embedded <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>streamed</b> signals recorded in the spline testing of the helicopter gearbox test rig located at the NAVAIR facility...|$|R

25|$|The sample {{mixture to}} be {{separated}} and analyzed is introduced, in a discrete small volume (typically microliters), <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>stream</b> of mobile phase percolating through the column. The components of the sample move through the column at different velocities, which are a function of specific physical interactions with the adsorbent (also called stationary phase). The velocity of each component depends on its chemical nature, {{on the nature of}} the stationary phase (column) and on the composition of the mobile phase. The time at which a specific analyte elutes (emerges from the column) is called its retention time. The retention time measured under particular conditions is an identifying characteristic of a given analyte.|$|E

25|$|On June 25, 1927, Westchester County opened Tibbetts Brook Park {{near the}} {{northern}} end of the brook, on land previously confiscated from the Tippett estate. Much of the site had been a Yonkers city garbage dump located {{on the banks of the}} western brook tributary. The garbage and residential sewage seeped <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>stream,</b> which fed polluted water into Peckham's Lake. The lake had been used by residents as a swimming hole in spite of recommendations against it by health officials. The area immediately south of the lake had been a swamp which was a haven for mosquitoes. As part of the creation of the park, the original lake was filled in, while the swamp was dredged to form the current Tibbetts Lake. The brook, meanwhile, was diverted into a paved channel. The eastern tributary had been protected by fences and infrastructure from the nearby Old Croton Aqueduct. At the time the park was constructed, the southern portion of the Saw Mill River Parkway was built on top of the dump along the western tributary course.|$|E
25|$|The video {{starts with}} Lightbody, {{who wears a}} dark coat, a grey polo neck sweater, and trousers. He sings as he pushes an old {{motorcycle}} across a farmer's field at dusk. As darkness falls, he abandons the bike and enters a wood. He walks through it, until he descends a short hill and stays in a stream. As the chorus begins, Lightbody lights a distress firelight, he moves it in circles as he sings. In a bridge behind him, two members from Snow Patrol light two flares and move them as well. When the chorus ends, Lighbody throws his flare to the water, in which it continues shining. Lightbody returns to the forest and he sings while he walks. Later, he ascends to a plain, where another two members ignite two distress firelights as the second verse ends. With the flares, they run and move them in circles, and then, they throw them to each other. Nathan Connolly, who wears a grey hoodie, appears riding the motorcycle Lightbody dumped. He drives it in zigzag with the other men. As the video ends, {{he goes to the}} stream, where the motorbike starts to throw smoke; Connolly gets off it, and it fires. The burning bike rolls downhill and it falls <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>stream,</b> where it sinks, with the fire being extinguished.|$|E

500|$|The {{construction}} of Shasta Dam and its afterbay (regulating downstream dam), Keswick Dam, in 1943 and 1950, respectively, severely impaired {{the capability of}} the Sacramento River to flush away pollutants from the mine. Acid mine drainage flowed, unfettered, down Spring Creek directly into the Keswick Reservoir, depositing contaminated sediment and turning {{a portion of the}} water a rusty red shade. Previously, the water would have continued down the creek into the river, and flushed to the Pacific Ocean. The pooling of the water, however, made it extremely difficult for the pollutants to be removed. From 1955 to 1962, open pit mining began on the site. At its peak, the mine discharged 5 tons of iron, [...] of copper, and [...] of zinc <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>stream</b> per day.

500|$|A breaker boy was a coal-mining {{worker in}} the United States and United Kingdom whose job was to {{separate}} impurities from coal by hand in a coal breaker. Although breaker boys were primarily children, elderly coal miners who could no longer work in the mines because of age, disease, or accident were also sometimes employed as breaker boys. The use of breaker boys began around 1866. For 10 hours a day, six days a week, breaker boys would sit on wooden seats, perched over the chutes and conveyor belts, picking slate and other impurities out of the coal. Breaker boys working on top of chutes or conveyor belts would stop the coal by pushing their boots <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>stream</b> of fuel flowing beneath them, briefly pick out the impurities, and then let the coal pass {{on to the next}} breaker boy for further processing. Others would divert coal into a horizontal chute at which they sat, then pick the coal clean before allowing the fuel to flow into [...] "clean" [...] coal bins.|$|E
