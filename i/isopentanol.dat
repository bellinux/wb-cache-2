50|$|The {{synthesis}} of exemestane also {{consists of three}} steps, {{as shown in figure}} 3. First off, a Vilsmeier-Haack reagent is prepared by refluxing paraformaldehyde and dimethylamine hydrochloride in <b>isopentanol</b> at a temperature of 131 °C while removing water from the <b>isopentanol</b> using a Dean-Stark separator. The internal temperature of the reagent is then cooled to 10-15 °C, before adding commercially available boldenone (androsta-1,4-dien-17ß-ol-3-one). The reaction mixture is then refluxed for 15 hours to give the 6-methylene derivative, 6-methyleneandrosta-1,4-dien-17ß-ol-3-one. Subsequently, Jones oxidation of the derivative in acetone at -10 °C gives exemestane in 79% yield after recrystalization. A mixture of 65:35 ethanol and water is used for the recrystalization process.|$|E

However, fuels containing only long, linear, hydrocarbon chains will freeze under cold conditions. To develop fuels suitable for cold applications, Keasling’s laboratory engineered E. coli and S. cerevisiae to produce branched and cyclic hydrocarbons using the isoprenoid biosynthetic pathway: <b>isopentanol,</b> a drop-in replacement for gasoline; pinene, a replacement for jet fuel; and bisabolene, a replacement for diesel fuel. [...] Because isoprenoids add a methyl side chain every four carbons in the backbone, fuels made from isoprenoids have very low freeze and cloud points, making them suitable as cold-weather diesels and jet fuels.|$|E

Rapid developments in biofuel technology {{have made it}} possible to produce C{sub 4 }-C{sub 5 } alcohols efficiently. These higher alcohols could significantly expand the biofuel content and potentially replace ethanol in future gasoline mixtures. This study characterizes some fundamental properties of a C{sub 5 } alcohol, <b>isopentanol,</b> as a fuel for homogeneous-charge compression-ignition (HCCI) engines. Wide ranges of engine speed, intake temperature, intake pressure, and equivalence ratio are investigated. The elementary autoignition reactions of <b>isopentanol</b> is investigated by analyzing product formation from laser-photolytic Cl-initiated <b>isopentanol</b> oxidation. Carbon-carbon bond-scission reactions in the low-temperature oxidation chemistry may provide an explanation for the intermediate-temperature heat release observed in the engine experiments.

The volatile, anthocyanin and ellagitannin profiles were monitored after each step. Aromatic compounds of pomegranates, such as limonene, 1 -hexenol and trans-caryophyllene, were detected in trace levels and showed little contribution to the liquor aroma. The main volatiles of the liquors, namely isobutanol, <b>isopentanols,</b> vitispiranes and volatile esters, are given by the fruit distillate. The anthocyanin contents of the pomegranate juice were around 135 mgL 1 but decreased to about 5 % of this value in the final liquors. Anthocyanin diglucoside compounds showed higher stability than their monoglucoside analogs. Punicalagins and punicalins showed contents between 80 and 135 mgL 1, depending on the used starting pomegranate material. These ellagitannins account for 60 % of the total polyphenols.

Isopropyl alcohol, isobutanol, pentan- 1 -ol and <b>isopentanol</b> alone caused up to a 4 -fold increase in 5 -aminolaevulinate synthase, whereas ethanol and propan- 1 -ol did not. Induction of the synthase by <b>isopentanol</b> was maximal at 8 h, and reached a plateau thereafter, whereas the activity induced by 2 -propyl- 2 -isopropylacetamide {{continued to increase}} for 20 h. In the presence of 3, 4, 3 ', 4 '-tetrachlorobiphenyl, an inhibitor of haem synthesis at the uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase step, synergistic induction of 5 -aminolaevulinate synthase was observed with all the alcohols except ethanol. Ethanol, but not <b>isopentanol,</b> decreased the extent of induction of 5 -aminolaevulinate synthase by 2 -propyl- 2 -isopropylacetamide and 3, 4, 3 ', 4 '-tetrachlorobiphenyl (50 % decrease at 112 mM-ethanol). Total protein synthesis was not inhibited by ethanol in these cells. The composition of porphyrins was determined after treatment of cells with ethanol, <b>isopentanol</b> or 2 -propyl- 2 -isopropylacetamide. Untreated cells, when incubated with 5 -aminolaevulinate for 6 h, accumulated mainly protoporphyrin. However, when cells were pretreated with ethanol, <b>isopentanol</b> or 2 -propyl- 2 -isopropylacetamide for 20 h, and 5 -aminolaevulinate was added, 8 - and 7 -carboxyporphyrins increased, whereas protoporphyrin decreased. The dose responses for induction of either 5 -aminolaevulinate synthase or cytochrome P- 450 after a 20 h exposure to 3 - to 5 -carbon alcohols were identical. The results indicate that: simple alcohols can induce both enzymes; hydrophobicity increases their effectiveness; and induction of both enzymes are probably mediated by a common mechanism...|$|E

We investigated the process of producing higher alcohols from duckweed via fermentation. Results showed that these plants have a promising future as the basis for developing biofuels. This could be achieved through fermentation by yeasts, producing not only traditional forms of energy such as ethanol but also higher alcohols with high energy yields through bioconversion by Clostridium acetobutylicum, mutant yeast strains, and bioengineered strains of Escherichia coli. The concentrations of butanol and total solvent produced via fermentation by C. acetobutylicum CICC 8012 were 12. 03 and 20. 03 g/L using acid hydrolysate of duckweed versus 12. 33 and 20. 05 g/L using enzymatic hydrolysate. The yields obtained of 24. 06 g/L ethanol and 680. 36 mg/L of <b>isopentanol</b> from duckweed using acid hydrolysate are 15 times higher than what could be obtained through the fermentation of the mutation of yeast.

Some alkanols, especially when taken at low concentration, have been found to stimulate the activity of the Ca pump and Ca-ATPase, namely tert-butanol, isopropanol and ethanol (from the group of hydrophilic alkanols), and pentanol, <b>isopentanol</b> and hexanol (from the more hydrophobic alkanols). Methanol (from the first group) and isobutanol, butanol and propanol (from the second) do not stimulate the Ca pump compared with the control. The specific effect of different alkanols cannot be explained in terms of a unitary mechanism based on ‘fluidity’ changes of the membrane.

Cellular levels of glutathione and cytochrome P- 450 were altered by treating the hepatocytes with N-acetyl-L-cysteine, buthionine sulfoximine, <b>isopentanol,</b> or beta-naphthoflavone. A dramatic increase in chromium(VI) -induced DNA strand breaks was observed after increasing glutathione levels in the cells. Chromium(VI) -induced DNA strand breaks were even more numerous when the level of cytochrome P- 450 was also increased. Upon depletion of glutathione levels and induction of cytochrome P- 450 or cytochrome P- 448, little or no DNA strand breaks or DNA interstrand cross-links were observed after chromium(VI) treatment. Chromium(VI) -induced DNA-protein cross-links generally decreased after either increases or decreases in cellular levels of glutathione or cytochrome P- 450 or P- 448.

40|$|Abstract: Ideally, invading {{bacteria}} are detected {{as early as}} possible in critically ill patients: the strain of morbific pathogens is identified rapidly, and antimicrobial sensi-tivity is known well before the start of new antimicrobial therapy. Bacteria have a distinct metabolism, part of which results in the production of bacteria-specific volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which might be used for diagnostic purposes. Volatile metabolites can be investigated directly in exhaled air, allowing for noninva-sive monitoring. The aim of this review is to provide an overview of VOCs produced by the six most abundant and pathogenic bacteria in sepsis, including Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Escherichia coli. Such VOCs could be used as biological markers in the diagnostic approach of critically ill patients. A systematic review of existing literature revealed 31 articles. All six bacteria of interest produce <b>isopentanol,</b> formaldehyde, methyl mercaptan, and trimethylamine.

Multivariate analysis of the NMR metabolite data demonstrated that the differentiation observed among wines produced from three different vineyards was related to microclimate and the carbonate, clay, and organic matter content of soils. In a study of wines produced in the Bordeaux region in France, Pereira et al.

However, the chemical kinetic models for hydrocarbon fuels of practical interest typically have large numbers of species and reactions and exhibit high levels of mathematical stiffness in the governing differential equations, particularly for larger fuel molecules. In order to integrate the stiff equations governing chemical kinetics, generally reactive-flow simulations rely on implicit algorithms that require frequent Jacobian matrix evaluations. Some in situ and a posteriori computational diagnostics methods also require accurate Jacobian matrices, including computational singular perturbation and chemical explosive mode analysis. Typically, finite differences numerically approximate these, but for larger chemical kinetic models this poses significant computational demands since the number of chemical source term evaluations scales with the square of species count. Furthermore, existing analytical Jacobian tools do not optimize evaluations or support emerging SIMD processors such as GPUs.

Triangular phase diagrams were developed for the microemulsion systems using the water titration method, and the solubility values of progesterone and indomethacin were determined using a conventional shake-flask method. The water assimilation capacities were determined to evaluate the effective microemulsion formation in different systems. The alkanols showed higher microemulsion formation rates at higher concentrations. A correlation between the carbon numbers of the alkanol and water assimilation capacity in the microemulsions studied was observed; isobutanol and <b>isopentanol</b> produced the best results. The addition of cyclodextrins showed no effect or had {{a negative effect on}} the microemulsion formation based on the type of cyclodextrin used. Isopropyl myristate-based microemulsion systems alone could increase the solubility values of progesterone and indomethacin up to 3300 -fold and 500 -fold, respectively, compared to those in water. However, the addition of cyclodextrins to the microemulsion systems did not show a synergistic effect in increasing the solubility values of the model drugs. In conclusion, microemulsion systems improve the solubility of progesterone and indomethacin.

Transitions occurred sharply and were fully reversible. The UCST was found to increase with an increasing molecular weight. Hydrophobic (alkyl chain) end groups were found to lower the critical temperature in isopropanol, while rigid aromatic end groups raised the transition temperature. In ternary mixtures of isopropanol/chloroform/POEGMA, the UCST decreased with an increasing chloroform concentration, with 10 vol% of chloroform accounting for a 30 C drop. In mixtures of isopropanol/ hexane/POEGMA, the cloud point increased significantly only with hexane concentrations above 30 vol%, at which level a 2 C transition temperature increase was found.

Rabbit antiserum against the 50 kDa protein inhibited benzphetamine demethylase activity in hepatic microsomes (microsomal fractions) from glutethimide-treated chick embryo. Antiserum to the 57 kDa protein inhibited ethoxyresorufin de-ethylase activity in hepatic microsomes from methylcholanthrene-treated chick embryo. Cultured chick hepatocytes were treated with chemicals known to induce isoenzymes of P- 450 in rodent liver. The induced P- 450 s were quantified spectrophotometrically and characterized by immunoblotting and enzyme assays. From these studies, chemical inducers were classified into three groups: (i) chemicals that induced a P- 450 isoenzyme of 50 kDa and increased benzphetamine demethylase activity: glutethimide, phenobarbital, metyrapone, mephenytoin, ethanol, <b>isopentanol,</b> isobutanol, lindane, lysodren; (ii) chemicals that induced a P- 450 isoenzyme of 57 kDa and increased ethoxyresorufin de-ethylase activity: 3 -methylcholanthrene and 3, 3 ', 4, 4 '-tetrachlorobiphenyl; and (iii) the mono-alpha-substituted 2, 3 ', 4, 4 ', 5 -pentabromobiphenyl, which induced both proteins and both activities.

The conventional method of DRGEP target species selection involves picking an static set of target species based on the expected major combustion processes; however, these static target species may not remain important throughout a combustion simulation. The RII method determines appropriate DRGEP target species solely from the local thermochemical state of the simulation, enabling DAC simulations to better respond to changing combustion conditions while ensuring that accuracy is maintained. Further, the RII method reduces the expertise required of users to select DRGEP target species sets. The RII method was tested on constant volume ignition delay studies as well as single-cell engine simulations under homogenous charge compression ignition (HCCI) conditions for n-heptane and <b>isopentanol</b> reaction mechanisms. It is illustrated that the RII is capable of accurate predictions of constant volume ignition delays {{over a wide range}} of starting conditions. Further, for a similar maximum error in ignition delay predictions, under certain autoignition conditions the RII method produced considerably smaller local skeletal mechanisms compared to those of conventional DRGEP target species selections; however, both methods generated similarly sized local skeletal mechanisms outside these regions.

Ignition delay times of ethanol and dimethyl ether have been measured in the low-pressure shock tube at NUI, Galway at varying fuel concentrations, equivalence ratios and pressures. Laminar burning velocities of ethanol in air have been measured using the flat-flame burner at the Universite de Lorraine at 358 K and 1. 0 atm. Reactions that influence the ignition delay times of ethanol and dimethyl ether include decomposition and hydrogen-abstraction reactions, while those influencing the laminar burning velocities of ethanol involve the secondary ethanol and acetaldehyde radicals. Diethyl ether has been studied in the low-pressure shock tube at equivalence ratios of 0. 5, 1. 0 and 2. 0 and at pressures of 1. 0 and 3. 5 atm, while burning velocities of diethyl ether in air have been reported at 1. 0 atm and at temperatures from 298 to 398 K. Unimolecular decomposition reactions have been found to affect the ignition delay times of diethyl ether, while hydrogen-abstraction reactions affect both ignition delay times and laminar burning velocities of the fuel. Dimethoxymethane has been investigated in the low- and high-pressure shock tubes at NUI, Galway at equivalence ratios of 0. 5, 1. 0 and 2. 0 and at pressures from 1. 0 to 9. 0 atm. Laminar burning velocities of dimethoxymethane in air have been reported at a pressure of 1. 0 atm and at temperatures from 298 to 358 K. The shock tube ignition delay times of dimethoxymethane at 9. 0 atm have been compared with those obtained in a rapid compression machine, with NTC-like behaviour shown from 850 to 950 K. Ignition delay times of sec-butanol and isobutanol have been measured in the low-pressure shock tube at equivalence ratios of 0. 5, 1. 0 and 2. 0 and at a pressure of 3. 5 atm. Reactions that {{have an effect on the}} ignition delay times of both butanol isomers are decomposition and hydrogen-abstraction reactions. The decomposition of sec-butanol produces ethyl and secondary ethanol radicals, while that of isobutanol produces isopropyl and methoxy radicals and water and isobutene. <b>Isopentanol</b> in air has been investigated in the high-pressure shock tube at various equivalence ratios and at pressures of 7. 0 and 20. 0 atm. Hydrogen-abstraction reactions have been found to influence the ignition delay times of <b>isopentanol</b> at the conditions studied. The seven liquid isomers of pentanol in air have been studied in the flat-flame burner at atmospheric pressure and at a temperature of 358 K. 1 -Pentanol has been found to be the most reactive isomer and 2 -methyl- 2 -butanol the least. Laminar burning velocities of 2 -methylfuran in air have been measured in the flat-flame burner at atmospheric pressure and at temperatures from 298 to 388 K, while those of 2, 5 -dimethylfuran in air have been measured in the same facility at the same pressure and at temperatures of 298 and 358 K. Reactions involving the parent fuel molecules have been found to greatly affect the laminar burning velocities, with hydrogen abstraction from the methyl groups and decomposition of the fuel being the most significant. 2016 - 03 - 1...|$|E
40|$|Ideally, invading {{bacteria}} are detected {{as early as}} possible in critically ill patients: the strain of morbific pathogens is identified rapidly, and antimicrobial sensitivity is known well before the start of new antimicrobial therapy. Bacteria have a distinct metabolism, part of which results in the production of bacteria-specific volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which might be used for diagnostic purposes. Volatile metabolites can be investigated directly in exhaled air, allowing for noninvasive monitoring. The aim of this review is to provide an overview of VOCs produced by the six most abundant and pathogenic bacteria in sepsis, including Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Escherichia coli. Such VOCs could be used as biological markers in the diagnostic approach of critically ill patients. A systematic review of existing literature revealed 31 articles. All six bacteria of interest produce <b>isopentanol,</b> formaldehyde, methyl mercaptan, and trimethylamine. Since humans do not produce these VOCs, they could serve as biological markers for presence of these pathogens. The following volatile biomarkers were found for identification of specific strains: isovaleric acid and 2 -methyl-butanal for Staphylococcus aureus; 1 -undecene, 2, 4 -dimethyl- 1 -heptane, 2 -butanone, 4 -methyl-quinazoline, hydrogen cyanide, and methyl thiocyanide for Pseudomonas aeruginosa; and methanol, pentanol, ethyl acetate, and indole for Escherichia coli. Notably, several factors that may effect VOC production were not controlled for, including used culture media, bacterial growth phase, and genomic variation within bacterial strains. In conclusion, VOCs produced by bacteria may serve as biological markers for their presence. Goal-targeted studies should be performed to identify potential sets of volatile biological markers and evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of these markers in critically ill patient...|$|E
40|$|The {{biosynthesis}} of volatiles by 'Golden Delicious' apple fruits {{are highly}} diminshed {{after a long}} term controlled atmosphere (CA) or ultra low oxygen (ULO) storage. To study the mechanisms of volatile production at both harvest time and after long term storage and to explain {{the reasons for the}} inability of fruits to produce adequate amounts of volatiles, aroma precursors were supplied to the fruits at different times during storage. Fruits were supplied with the following aroma precursors: Alcohols (ethanol, propanol, butanol, pentanol, hexanol, isobutanol and <b>isopentanol),</b> acids (acetic-, propionic-, butyric-, pentanoic- and hexanoic acid) and esters (methyl heptanoate and methyl linolenate). Each aroma precursor was applied separately both at harvest time (October) and in March, after the apples were stored in ultra low oxygen conditions (1 % O 2 : 3 % CO 2) for 5 months. Alcohols, except ethanol, induced in both application times a strong increase in the biosynthesis of its volatiles. Butanol enhanced the production of butyl acetate, ethyl butyrate, butanol and pentyl butyrate. Hexanol enhanced the synthesis of butyl butyrate, hexyl acetate, hexyl propionate, hexanol and hexyl hexanoate. The biosynthesis of butyl butirate or propyl acetate by fruits stored for 5 months in ULO-storage after the treatments with hexanol or pentanol is evidence for an active beta-oxiodation process. The influence of acids was negligible at harvest time but they, except acetic and hexanioc acids, induced at the second date the biosynthesis of their esters. It is proposed that the long chain unsaturated fatty acids (linol- and linolenic acids) are the ultimate precursors for aroma (Bartley et al., 1985). The content of both fatty acids were found to be highly and positively correlated with volatile production. They decreased strongly after 6 months in ULO-storage in about the same manner as aroma production...|$|E
40|$|Aims: To {{contribute}} to the improvement of methods for the regulation and production of higher alcohols using micro-organisms, we assessed the yields achieved using 10 decarboxylase genes from three different yeast species (Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Candida tropicalis and Pichia pastoris) by cloning them into vectors and overexpressing them in Escherichia coli hosts of different genotypes. Genes that produced the greatest yields in higher alcohol production were further assessed for the catalytic effects of the decarboxylase enzymes in the different E. coli hosts. Methods and Results: A major metabolic pathway is structured via overexpressing a series of five genes, to detect the effect of decarboxylase on the production of higher alcohols. Results suggested that these genes can facilitate production of specific types of higher alcohols by diverse types of E. coli. We also showed that they play direct roles in the metabolic pathways that lead to production of higher alcohols in E. coli. The gene ARO 10 from S. cerevisiae produced the highest yields for producing isobutanol and <b>isopentanol</b> in the host JM 109. Significant {{differences were found in}} the types of higher alcohols and yields produced within the same host, for the genes PAD 1, GAD 1, SPE 1 from S. cerevisiae. Similar results were observed for the genes ODC 1 and gadB from Candida tropicalis and P. pastoris, respectively. Conclusions: Investigation of these genes for identification of the key enzymatic steps or regulatory pathways involved in the Ehrlich metabolic network to produce higher alcohols is paramount for producing biofuels. The selected genes are promising targets for the development of improved production strains. Significance and Impact of the Study: This is the first published assessment of the effects of decarboxylases from different yeast species that were expressed in E. coli, for the production of higher alcohols. Our results provide guidance for future studies about the use of yeast enzymes for transforming or constructing a new metabolic pathway utilizing E. coli for the production of target higher alcohols...|$|E

Background. The {{accumulation}} of toxic effluent components {{is a considerable}} hazard to water resources potential of the country. It particularly relates to waste water pollutants belonging to II?IV hazard classes such as organic dyes and diluents. Objective. The goal {{of this research was}} to investigate the main principles of Bromphenol Blue remediation from water by solvent sublation technique and to determine optimum process conditions. Methods. Bromophenol blue (BB), an anionic dye, was removed from aqueous solution by solvent sublation of a BB ? hexadecylpyridium complex (sublate) into <b>isopentanol.</b> The pH of the solution was determined by potentiometric method. Dye concentrations of the sample solutions were measured with the use of absorption spectroscopy. Results. The effects of the following parameters on the solvent sublation were experimentally studied: the molar ratio of hexadecylpyridium chloride (HPC) to BB, pH of the aqueous phase, the removal process duration, type of organic solvent, the size of bubbles generated in the sparger and the addition of electrolytes (like KCl) and nonhydrophobic organic compounds (like ethanol). By making central composite orthogonal design and deriving second order mathematical model with the aid of MS Excel 2003 {{it was found that the}} maximum efficiency of depicted process can be attained in a case of carrying it out under the following optimum conditions: temperature 10 ?C, surfactant/dye molar ratio 1. 94 : 1; process duration ? 15. 3 min. Conclusions. Within this research the main principles of Bromophenol Blue removal from water by solvent sublation were investigated. The second order experiment statistical model was derived with the use of central composite orthogonal design. The maximum relative standard deviation was equal to 4, 7 %. Optimum conditions were determined: According to obtained results the highest level of BB elimination reached within the experiment was equal to 97. 5 % and the residual dye content didn?t exceed the maximum allowable concentration (the M. A. C.) of acidic dyes 0. 25 mg/dm?. ????????????. ?????????? ????????? ??????????? ??????? ??? ???????????? ???????????? ????????? ??? ??????? ?????????? ???????????. ??? ???????? ???????? ????????????? ??????? ???, ??????????? ?
