30|$|In summary, combinational {{method of}} site-specifically {{incorporation}} of the unnatural amino acid tfmF into proteins and 19 F NMR could be a reliable method for PPI analysis in cellular cytosols, taking advantage of no natural 19 F background signals from cellular molecules. At the same time, the tfmF incorporations at two residue sites using the pET-Duet plasmids in this report provided a general method for in situ PPI analysis between two tfmF-incorporated proteins. Therefore, conformational and functional studies of other soluble proteins (enzymes, receptors), or interaction <b>interfaces</b> <b>analysis</b> of two proteins in a complex in crude cell lysates could be implemented using the combinational method of site-specific 19 F incorporation and 19 F NMR.|$|R
