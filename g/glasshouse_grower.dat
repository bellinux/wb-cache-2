40|$|In {{order to}} meet the {{changing}} needs and preferences of consumers it will be important for Belgian glasshouse growers to change from a production-driven to a customer-driven strategy. More than ever, use of information and product innovation become critical factors in the changing competitive environment. The aim of the research is to analyse the relationship between business and managerial characteristics, use of information sources, product innovation and financial performance of the firm. The results indicate that the average Belgian <b>glasshouse</b> <b>grower</b> makes low use of external information sources for production decisions. However an important variation in information use can be observed among the growers. The results reveal that vegetable producers make more use of external information than producers of ornamental plants, which can be related to their co-operational organization. Although the predictors of information use can vary substantially across information sources, the results reveal that, independent of sector differences, the value attached to "creativity and innovation" is an important determinant of information use. A significant positive relationship was found between the use of information and product innovation. The results indicate that product innovation and financial performance are associated, however this association was only statistically significant for the growers of ornamental plants.

40|$|Energy is an {{important}} production factor in glasshouse horticulture. However in recent years <b>glasshouse</b> <b>growers</b> are faced with increasing energy prices and growing environmental concerns. In 2000 the Flemish government decided to stimulate environmentally sound investments by means of investment subsidies. In the current research the factors influencing the adoption of environmentally sound and energy saving technologies by <b>glasshouse</b> <b>growers</b> are analysed. Based on the innovation diffusion theory the hypothesis is that external factors, personal characteristics of the firm manager (personal objectives, age, education level, importance attached to subsidies, [...] .) and fixed characteristics (business objectives, business size, modernity, [...] .) determine investment behaviour. Data for the research are obtained from accounting data and interviews at 58 holdings specialised in vegetable production and 79 holdings specialised in production of ornamental plants. These holdings all belong to the Farm Accountancy Data Network of the Centre of Agricultural Economics. PRINCALS and discriminant analysis are used to analyse the data. The most important investments are the conversion from fuel oil to natural gas and the installation or use of energy saving screens. An important obstacle to the conversion to natural gas, as determined by this study, {{is the lack of}} natural gas pipelines in the surroundings of the glasshouse holding. The holdings which currently use natural gas are mainly large, energy-intensive businesses with younger managers. Those who intend to change over to natural gas attach a great importance to investment subsidies as they have smaller but growth-oriented business. Investments in energy saving screens are important for producers of energy intensive ornamental plants. In most of the cases these investments consist of replacement of the existing energy saving screens with more efficient ones...|$|R
40|$|Dalotia {{coriaria}} (Kraatz) (Coleoptera: Staphylinidae) and entomopathogenic nematodes (Rhabditida: Heterorhabditidae and Steinernematidae) are two soil-dwelling {{biological control}} agents used to manage western flower thrips, Frankliniella occidentalis (Pergande) (Thysanoptera: Thripidae) and fungus gnats Bradysis spp. (Diptera: Sciaridae) in <b>glasshouses.</b> <b>Growers</b> often use multiple natural enemies to achieve economic control, but knowledge of interactions among natural enemies is lacking. We conducted a laboratory bioassay {{to test the}} pathogenicity of four commercially available nematode species—Heterorhabditis bacteriophora Poinar (Rhabditida: Heterorhbditidae), Steinernema carpocapsae (Weiser) (Rhabditida: Steinernematidae), S. feltiae (Filipjev), and S. riobrave Cabanillas et al. —to third instar and adult D. coriaria. Third instars were three times more susceptible than the adults to the entomopathogenic nematodes. Mortality for D. coriaria adults and third instars treated with S. feltiae and H. bacteriophora was lower than the mortality for D. coriaria adults and third instars treated with S. carpocapsae and S. riobrave. Neither infective juvenile foraging behavior nor size correlates with D. coriaria mortality. Dalotia coriaria appears to be most likely compatible with applications of S. feltiae and H. bacteriophora...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} the corporate responsibility (CR) management system of the Finnish glasshouse growing industry and suggests areas of development based on the analysis. In order to succeed in this, the thesis also develops a framework to analyse CR management systems. The literature review shows that there are no comprehensive frameworks established for analysing corporate responsibility management systems, and therefore a new framework designed specifically to analyse CR management systems is developed. The framework includes three main analytical parts adapted from Rasche (2009); the content of the system, the processes within the system, and the system’s relation to the context. The CR management system of the Finnish glasshouse growing industry is quite unique; {{there are a couple of}} national horticultural organizations, which guide the CR of the individual <b>glasshouse</b> <b>growers</b> with a CR guideline, audits, internal and external communication and development support. Hence the industry has a cluster approach to managing CR, which is found beneficial in this case, because the growers are all small or medium-sized. The content encompasses all areas of corporate responsibility with a focus on ensuring food quality and safety, preventing risks and ensuring legal compliance. Potential areas of development are also found. The current system does not completely please the growers, who are supposed to pass the CR audits in the near future, due to several reasons. One main area of development is to increase the perceived benefits of the system and the processes, for example by focusing on those areas of CR that bring both financial and sustainability-related improvements. The thesis also introduces the difficulties related to the management of a system for a heterogeneous group of companies albeit within one specific industry. The thesis concludes that the improvements of corporate responsibility amongst Finnish <b>glasshouse</b> <b>growers</b> are highly dependent on the same factors as they are elsewhere in the world; the economic situation allowing the investments for increased sustainability and the demands posed by the food retailers and the consumers. Still, it is noted that the horticultural organizations, which control the CR management system, are in a central position in supporting the individual growers. Perhaps one day the Finnish vegetables and flowers will be known not only for their quality but also the high ethical standards used by the growers...|$|R
40|$|Research on {{competitive}} {{strategies of}} Belgian <b>glasshouse</b> <b>growers</b> reveals that high quality and environmental sound production {{will be required}} in the future. The aim of the current research is to detect the determinants of environmental and quality management at firm level {{and their impact on}} the performance of the enterprise. Based on a theoretical framework the basic hypothesis is that, besides external variables, personal characteristics of the manager (age, education, personal objectives, [...] .) and firm characteristics (sector, size, business objectives [...] .) determine the strategies adopted in operating the business as well as the performance of the firm. Data for the research are obtained from accounting data and interviews using a pre-tested questionnaire at 59 holdings specialised in vegetable production and 89 holdings specialised in production of ornamental plants belonging to the Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN) of the Centre of Agricultural Economics. Cluster analysis, analysis of variance as well as regression analysis are used to analyse the data. Statistical analysis of the data on quality management reveals that high quality management is positively related to 'participation in seminars', 'expressive objectives', 'creativity and innovation', 'economic dimension' and 'vegetable production'. Investments in environmental sound production techniques are influenced by 'economic dimension', 'participation in seminars and the business objectives 'creativity and innovation and 'growth'. Analysis of the financial performance of the glasshouse holdings indicates a positive and significant association with environmental and quality management...|$|R
40|$|Sample {{bottles and}} {{questionnaires}} {{were sent to}} 240 <b>glasshouse</b> <b>growers</b> in 24 counties. A response of 87 % was obtained. The water samples were analysed for pH, Ca, Mg, Na, K, P, Mn, O, specific conductivity (SC) and total hardness. Information {{was obtained from the}} questionnaire on water source, storage, treatment, presence or absence of algae, use of a boiler for heating and sterilising, and type of feeding system used. Calcium and SC readings fluctuated most and, in general, supplies from wells were hard while those caught as 'roof rainwater' were very soft. The linear correlation between Ca contents and SC readings was 0. 91, and the hardness of water was correctly predicted for 157 samples out of 197 by making an SC reading and converting it to ppm Ca using the regression line. Thirty-six percent of samples were obtained from wells, 29. 4 % from 'mains,' 14. 7 % from rivers and the remainder from combinations of these or other sources. Supplies which were stored were more likely to contain algae than those which were not. The hose system of feeding was used most frequently. Forty-five percent of growers used boilers, but of these less than one-fifth treated the water. Of the samples not treated 26. 5 % were classified as moderately hard, 21. 0 % as hard and 4. 2 % as extremely hard...|$|R
40|$|To inform {{current and}} future {{pesticide}} availability to <b>glasshouse</b> vegetable <b>growers,</b> the current project trialled more than twenty products, including existing industry standards, against four key pests of glasshouse tomatoes and bell peppers. These included experimental conventional chemical pesticides as well as alternative biopesticide and biorational products based on phytochemicals, microbials and physically-acting substances. The results suggest that certain biopesticide products, particularly botanicals, provide good levels of pest control, with the same being true of experimental conventional chemical pesticides not yet recommended for use against these pests on these crops. Efforts are on-going to ensure that {{results of the current}} project translate to industry benefit via new pesticide approvals...|$|R
40|$|In Flanders {{glasshouse}} {{vegetables and}} ornamental plants are typically produced at family businesses. At {{this type of}} businesses the objectives and long-term firm developments {{are influenced by the}} so called ‘family-firm life cycle’. In many cases the firm shows a life cycle that corresponds with the life cycle of the entrepreneur. The objective of the paper is to test the hypothesis that the ‘family-firm life cycle’ {{will have an impact on}} the personal and business characteristics, objectives and the quality of the management processes involved in sustainable glasshouse horticulture. As sustainable horticulture integrates the three P’s (People, Planet, Profit) special attention is paid to human resource, environmental and financial management. Data for the research are based on interviews and accounting data at 138 glasshouse holdings situated in Flanders (northern part of Belgium). The results reveal that the glasshouse managers in the different phases of the ‘family-firm life cycle’ show significant differences in age, education level and numbers of seminars attended. The economic dimension, modernity of durable goods, solvency and investment pattern of the firms in the different stages of the ‘family-firm life cycle’ also show significant differences. At the older businesses the availability of a successor has an important influence. The results confirm the hypothesis that the objectives and the quality of the management processes involved in environmental, human resource and financial management are dependent on the phase in the ‘family-firm life cycle’. In the early stages firm managers are more ambitious and attach a higher importance to the management processes involved in sustainable development. In the later stages the availability of a successor has an important influence. Unexpectedly no significant influence of the phase in the ‘family-firm life cycle’ on the income obtained per familial labour unit is found. The insights derived from this research have important implications both for research and practice. They can enable <b>glasshouse</b> <b>growers</b> and advisers to take and/or support correct decisions and may help policy makers to differentiate on the base of the ‘family-firm life cycle’. farm management, horticulture, sustainability, Crop Production/Industries, Farm Management,...|$|R
40|$|Increasing {{energy costs}} force <b>glasshouse</b> <b>growers</b> {{to switch to}} energy saving strategies. In the {{temperature}} integration approach, considerable daily temperature variations are allowed, which not only have an important influence on plant growth {{but also on the}} development rate of arthropods in the crop. Therefore, we examined the influence of two constant temperature regimes (15 A degrees C/ 15 A degrees C and 20 A degrees C/ 20 A degrees C) and one alternating temperature regime (20 A degrees C/ 5 A degrees C, with an average of 15 A degrees C) on life table parameters of Phytoseiulus persimilis and Neoseiulus californicus and their target pest, the two-spotted spider mite Tetranychus urticae at a 16 : 8 (L:D) h photoperiod and 65 +/- A 5 % RH. For females of both predatory mites the alternating temperature regime resulted in a 25 - 30 % shorter developmental time as compared to the corresponding mean constant temperature regime of 15 A degrees C/ 15 A degrees C. The immature development of female spider mites was prolonged for 7 days at 15 A degrees C/ 15 A degrees C as compared to 20 A degrees C/ 5 A degrees C. With a daytime temperature of 20 A degrees C, no differences in lifetime fecundity were observed between a nighttime temperature of 20 and 5 A degrees C for P. persimilis and T. urticae. The two latter species did show a higher lifetime fecundity at 20 A degrees C/ 5 A degrees C than at 15 A degrees C/ 15 A degrees C, and their daily fecundity at the alternating regime was about 30 % higher than at the corresponding mean constant temperature. P. persimilis and T. urticae showed no differences in sex ratio between the three temperature regimes, whereas the proportion of N. californicus females at 15 A degrees C/ 15 A degrees C (54. 2 %) was significantly lower than that at 20 A degrees C/ 5 A degrees C (69. 4 %) and 20 A degrees C/ 20 A degrees C (67. 2 %). Intrinsic rates of increase were higher at the alternating temperature than at the corresponding mean constant temperature for both pest and predators. Our results indicate that thermal responses of the studied phytoseiid predators to alternating temperature regimes used in energy saving strategies in glasshouse crops may have consequences for their efficacy in biological control programs...|$|R
40|$|Although thermal screens {{were already}} {{introduced}} {{more than twenty}} years ago in Western European <b>glasshouse</b> horticulture, <b>growers</b> were discouraged to install them in their glasshouse, since they were not able to quantify the crop's behaviour under a thermal screen. Nowadays, crop monitoring techniques have become commercially available, which might aid growers to support their decision to adapt their climate control set points once a thermal screen is installed. In this study, leaf temperature, stem diameter and sap flow measurements were performed on glasshouse tomato plants (Solanum lycopersicum L. 'Clothilde') grown inside two compartments in Beitem, Belgium during spring 2008. In one compartment, a movable and semi-transparent thermal screen was used during the night. Differences in leaf temperature between the two compartments were observed, which were mainly caused by differences in air temperature, although differences in radiative energy losses also had {{to be taken into account}} in the upper canopy layer in the case of cold nights. Based on these results, it is advised to include leaf temperature measurements in research concerning the effect of the use of thermal screens. Additionally, a reduced water uptake was observed in the morning when the screen was still closed, whereas during the evening hours no difference in water uptake could be revealed. However, when the thermal screen was closed in the evening, stem diameter measurements indicated that the internal water storage pools were restored more quickly under the screen. It is, however, acknowledged that these effects were only observed on sunny days. Consequently, in addition to leaf temperature measurements, sap flow and stem diameter measurements can provide growers and researchers useful feedback from the crop itself, when thermal screen application strategies are to be evaluated. As a general conclusion, it was stated that these crop monitoring techniques are imperative when novel techniques are to be introduced in glasshouse horticulture in a sustainable way...|$|R
