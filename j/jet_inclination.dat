40|$|Experiments were {{conducted}} at the GALCIT supersonic shear-layer facility to investigate aspects of reacting transverse jets in supersonic crossflow using chemiluminescence and schlieren image-correlation velocimetry. In particular, experiments were designed to examine mixing-delay length dependencies on jet-fluid molar mass, jet diameter, and <b>jet</b> <b>inclination.</b> The experimental results show that mixing-delay length depends on jet Reynolds number, when appropriately normalized, up to a jet Reynolds number of 500, 000. <b>Jet</b> <b>inclination</b> increases the mixing-delay length, but causes less disturbance to the crossflow when compared to normal jet injection. This can be explained, in part, {{in terms of a}} control-volume analysis that relates <b>jet</b> <b>inclination</b> to flow conditions downstream of injection. In the second part of this thesis, a combustion-modeling framework is proposed and developed that is tailored to large-eddy simulations of turbulent combustion in high-speed flows. Scaling arguments place supersonic hydrocarbon combustion in a regime of autoignition-dominated distributed reaction zones (DRZ). The proposed evolution-variable manifold (EVM) framework incorporates an ignition-delay data-driven induction model with a post-ignition manifold that uses a Lagrangian convected 'balloon' reactor model for chemistry tabulation. A large-eddy simulation incorporating the EVM framework captures several important reacting-flow features of a transverse hydrogen jet in heated-air crossflow experiment. </p...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this project work is to study experimentally the hydraulic jump with a moving jet impingement on a glass plate surface. The jet strikes the horizontally placed glass plate and the jump occur which is investigated with different flow rate and discussed here in detail. Hydraulic jump of two different variety has been observed in this study when jet is stationary with respect to horizontal glass plate and moving. When jet is stationary with higher angle of <b>jet</b> <b>inclination,</b> smooth curve is appeared at the jump location, and for lower angle of <b>jet</b> <b>inclination,</b> curve with sharp change in profile is observed. Radius of hydraulic jump and the profile formed due to variation in flow rate are studied experimentally.

40|$|We {{present the}} first high {{signal-to-noise}} XMM-Newton {{observations of the}} broad-line radio galaxy 3 C 411. After fitting various spectral models, an absorbed double power-law continuum and a blurred relativistic disk reflection model (kdblur) {{are found to be}} equally plausible descriptions of the data. While the softer power-law component (Γ= 2. 11) of the double power-law model is entirely consistent with that found in Seyfert galaxies (and hence likely originates from a disk corona), the additional power law component is very hard (Γ= 1. 05); amongst the AGN zoo, only flat-spectrum radio quasars have such hard spectra. Together with the very flat radio-spectrum displayed by this source, we suggest that it should instead be classified as a FSRQ. This leads to potential discrepancies regarding the <b>jet</b> <b>inclination</b> angle, with the radio morphology suggesting a large <b>jet</b> <b>inclination</b> but the FSRQ classification suggesting small inclinations.

These {{have investigated the}} fluid mechanics of coolant ejection from {{the leading edge of}} a turbine blade using a large-scale, cylindrical model at engine-representative Reynolds numbers in a low-speed tunnel with ambient-temperature mainstream flow. The coolant trajectories were captured using a fine nylon mesh covered with thermochromic liquid crystal (TLC), allowing the measurement of gas temperature (hence non-dimensional effectiveness) contours in planes perpendicular to the flow. A study was undertaken to determine an appropriate mesh to support the TLC experiments: the pressure loss coefficient and TLC colour-intensity response was measured for five different meshes, and from this two were chosen for further investigation; one with the smallest loss coefficient and the other with the best intensity response. Key features of the coolant jet (i. e. the shape of the contours, the approximate size, and the <b>jet's</b> <b>inclination)</b> were identified using this flow-visualization method. The coolant films featured a core of high gas effectiveness with a strong gradient in temperature {{at the edges of the}} jet. The coolant footprints were observed to lift off the surface at high momentum-flux ratios. Cross-stream injection featured jets with an asymmetric structure due to the lateral component of momentum of the coolant; these jets exhibited a kidney-shaped cross-section created by a vortex structure in the flow. The flow visualization experiments also assessed the interaction of coolant plumes from different rows of holes, clearly illustrating that upstream holes affected the size, shape, and position of downstream films. The shape and trajectory of the coolant films were also shown to depend upon the local acceleration of the mainstream and corresponding boundary-layer thickness...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{have carried}} out {{simulations}} of supersonic light jets {{in order to}} model the features observed in optical and radio images of the western hot-spot in the radio galaxy Pictor A. We have considered jets with density ratios η = 10 − 2 − 10 − 4, and Mach numbers ranging between 5 and 50. From each simulation, we have generated ray-traced maps of radio surface brightness {{at a variety of}} <b>jet</b> <b>inclinations,</b> in order to study the appearance of time-dependent luminous structures {{in the vicinity of the}} western hot-spot. We compare these rendered images with observed features of Pictor A. A remarkable feature of Pictor A observations is a bar-shaped “filament ” inclined almost at right angles to the inferred jet direction and extending 24 ′′ (10. 8 h− 1 kpc) along its longest axis. The constraints of reproducing the appearance of this structure in simulations indicate that the jet of Pictor A lies nearly in the plane of the sky. The results of the simulation are also consistent with other features found in the radio image of Pictor A. This filament arises from the surging behaviour of the jet near the hot-spot; the surging is provoked by alternate compression and decompression of the jet by the turbulent backflow in the cocoon. We also examine the arguments for the jet in Pictor A being at a more acute angle to the line of sight and find that our preferred orientation is just consistent with the limits on the brightness ratio of the X-ray jet and counter-jet. We determine from our simulations, the structure function of hot-spot brightness and also the cumulative distribution of the ratio of intrinsic hot-spot brightnesses. Th...|$|R

The main {{goal of the}} present work is to investigate the flow characteristics of a square jet issuing transversally into a cross-flow at three injection angles of 90 °, 60 ° and 30 °, and thus to provide some deeper insights into the physical flow mechanism governing the normal and inclined jets in cross-flow. The simulation uses the jet to cross-flow velocity ratio of 2. 5 and the Reynolds number based on the free-stream quantities and the jet exit diameter is 225. While the vortical structures predicted from the normally jet were in good qualitatively agreement {{with the findings of}} other researchers, our simulations have shown that both the jet penetration and jet cross-flow mixing are strongly dependent on the <b>jet</b> <b>inclination</b> angle.

40|$|The scour process {{induced by}} {{plunging}} jets {{is an important}} topic for hydraulic engineers. In recent decades, several researchers have developed new strategies and methodologies to control the scour morphology, including different jet arrangements and structures located in the stilling basin. It {{has been found that}} multiple jets can cause less scouring than single plunging jets. Based on this evidence, this study aimed to investigate the equilibrium morphology caused by multiple non-crossing jets. A dedicated laboratory model was built and experimental tests were carried out under different combinations of <b>jet</b> <b>inclination</b> angles, by varying the tailwater level and the virtual crossing point location, which was set below the original channel bed level. It was experimentally shown that the equilibrium scour morphology depends on the jet discharge, the differences in non-crossing <b>jet</b> <b>inclination</b> angles, the downstream water level, and the distance of the virtual crossing point from the original channel bed level. In particular, the last parameter was found {{to be one of the}} most influential parameters, because of the resulting flow patterns inside the water body. Furthermore, the analysis of experimental evidence allowed for a complete and detailed classification of the scour hole typologies. Three different scour typologies were distinguished and classified. Finally, based on previous studies, two novel relationships have been proposed to predict both the maximum scour depth and length within a large range of hydraulic and geometric parameters...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{reports the}} results of an {{experimental}} study into the flow and heat transfers associated with both inclined and orthogonally impinging axisymmetric air jets. The majority of previously reported studies have been mainly confined to orthogonally impinging jets in stagnant surroundings. In this investigation, free jets as well as the effects of crossflows are considered. This investigation is Primarily concerned with local heat transfer variations. The experimental tests were. conducted with a single 12. 7 mm diameter jet impinging on a flat surface, and heat transfers were evaluated using a heat-mass transfer analogy (t e Chilton-Colburn analogy). The sublimation of naphthalene was employed as the mass transfer technique. The flowfield associated with impinging jets has a significant influence on their heat transfer characteristics., In view of the present limited level of understanding of this 'complex' flowfield, extensive flow visualisation techniques were employed in this present investigation. Those were primarily intended to aid interpretation of the experimental heat transfer results, and also to provide further physical understanding of the flowfields resulting from the interactions between impinging jets and crossflowing streams. The flow and heat transfer tests conducted in the programme of work reported in this thesis covered typical ranges of flow parameters of interest in many practical applications of jet impingement systems. <b>Jet</b> <b>inclinations</b> of 45 °, 600, and 90 °, nozzle to target spacings of 2, 11, and 8 nozzle diameters were studied.

Whilst the jet flow is discharged at Re(Dh) = 8. 2 X 10 (3) based on the hydraulic diameter of the orifice, D(h), and the jet exit-to-plate spacing (separation distance) is fixed at 8 D(h). the impingement angle (inclination) is systematically decreased from 90 degrees (normal impinging) to 30, (oblique impinging). A separate experiment is carried out for a two-dimensional cooling jet obliquely impinging on a heated plate (constant heat flux). The results demonstrate that the response of local surface temperature to plate inclination behaves {{in a completely different}} manner. For impinging <b>jet</b> cooling, the <b>inclination</b> (from normal impinging position) reduces the local effective temperature values at corresponding points about actual stagnation point, inclusive of it. For impinging <b>jet</b> heating, the <b>inclination</b> causes, conversely, an increase in local surface temperature including the stagnation point temperature. However, the shifting of the actual stagnation point towards the uphill side of the plate is consistently observed for both hot and cold jet cases.

Our original motivation for this study was to search for systematic differences between BLRGs and their radio-quiet counterparts, the Seyfert galaxies, whose temporal and spectral behavior is better studied. We find that both 3 C 390. 3 and 3 C 120 are highly variable, but in a different way, and quantify this difference by means of a structure function analysis. 3 C 390. 3 is significantly more variable than 3 C 120, despite its <b>jet</b> larger <b>inclination</b> angle, implying either that the X-ray variability is not dominated by the jet or that two different variability processes are simultaneously at work in 3 C 390. 3. We performed an energy-selected and time-resolved analysis based on the fractional variability amplitude and found that the variability amplitude of both objects is strongly anticorrelated with the energy. This last result, along with the correlated change of the photon index with the X-ray continuum flux, can be qualitatively explained within the scenario of thermal Comptonization, generally invoked for radio-quiet active galaxies. Moreover, the time-resolved and energy-selected fractional variability analyses show a trend opposite to that observed in jet-dominated AGN (blazars), suggesting only a minor contribution of the jet to the X-ray properties of BLRGs. Time-averaged spectral analysis indicates the presence of a strong, resolved iron line with centroid at 6. 4 keV and a weak reflection component in both objects.

Precessing jet model fits, together with the assumptions that the jet is intrinsically symmetric and was ejected during or after the major flare, yield the following constraints: the <b>jet</b> <b>inclination</b> to the line of sight must be � 14 ◦; the cone opening angle must be � 12 ◦; and the precession period must be � 60 days...|$|E
40|$|We present {{near-infrared}} integral field spectroscopy of {{the central}} kiloparsec of NGC 1275 {{at the heart of}} the Perseus cluster of galaxies, obtained with the UIST IFU on UKIRT. The nuclear ro-vibrational H_ 2 emission is spatially resolved and is likely to originate approximately 50 pc from the active nucleus. The Pa-alpha emission is, by contrast, spatially unresolved. The requirements for thermal excitation of the H_ 2 by nuclear X-radiation, its kinematics on sub-arcsec scales, and its stability against self-gravity, together suggest that the observed H_ 2 is part of a clumpy disk rotating about the radio-jet axis. The sharp jump in H_ 2 velocity across the nucleus implies a black hole mass of 3. 4 E 8 M(Solar), with a systematic error of 0. 18 dex due to the uncertainty in the radio <b>jet</b> <b>inclination.</b> This agrees well with the value implied by the empirical correlation between black hole mass and stellar velocity dispersion for nearby elliptical galaxies, and is ~ 100 times the stellar mass in this region.

40|$|An {{experimental}} study {{was performed to}} evaluate {{the effect of a}} cold jet on a single trailing vortex. Flow visualization and particle image velocimetry (PIV) measurements were conducted in wind and water tunnels. The main parameters were the ratio of jet-to-vortex strength, the jet-to-vortex distance, the <b>jet</b> <b>inclination</b> angle and the Reynolds number. It was shown that the jet turbulence is wrapped around the vortex and ingested into it. This takes place faster with decreasing jet-to-vortex distance and increasing jet strength. Both time-averaged and instantaneous flow fields showed that the trailing vortex became diffused with its rotational velocity and vorticity levels reduced when the jet is located close to the vortex. The mechanism with which the jet interacts with the vortex is a combination of vortices shed by the jet and the turbulence. No noticeable differences were found within the Reynolds number range tested. The effect of jet on the vortex is delayed when the jet is blowing at an angle to the free stream and away from the vortex such as during take-off...|$|E
40|$|Mixing of reactants, catalysts, etc. in a {{chemical}} reactor may be achieved using jets which offer {{the advantage of}} having no moving parts inside the reactor. While {{there have been many}} experimental studies and thumb rules for the design of jets, the details of mixing process is not properly understood. An experiment was carried out to study the effects of various parameters such as nozzle diameter, angle of <b>inclination,</b> <b>jet</b> position and jet velocity on mixing time. Results show that, for a given geometric arrangement, the angle of the jet injection is significantly more important in determining the time required for 95 % mixing than the length of the jet. The optimum angle was found to be an injection angle of 30 º for jet located either at two-third of the volume of the tank or top and bottom of the tank, which gave the shortest mixing time. The optimum angle is not universal and varies with the location of the jet inlet. An increase in the nozzle diameter was found to reduce the mixing time at a given level of power consumption and in turn the energy efficiency can be improved...|$|R
40|$|A very {{important}} issue concerning protostellar jets is the mechanism behind their formation. Obtaining information on the region {{at the base of}} a jet can shed light into the subject and some years ago this has been done through a search for a rotational signature at the jet line spectrum. The existence of such signatures, however, remains controversial. In order to contribute to the clarification of this issue, in this paper we show that the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) can potentially help to distinguish between rotation and precession effects in protostellar jet images. We apply the PCA to synthetic spectro-imaging datacubes generated as an output of numerical simulations of protostellar jets. In this way we generate a benchmark to which a PCA diagnostics of real observations can be confronted. Using the computed emission line profiles for [O I] 6300 A and [S II] 6716 A, we recover and analyze the effects of rotation and precession in tomograms generated by PCA. We show that different combinations of the eigenvectors can be used to enhance and to identify the rotation features present in the data. Our results indicate that the PCA can be useful for disentangling rotation from precession in <b>jets</b> with an <b>inclination</b> of the <b>jet</b> with respect to the plane of the sky as high as 45 degrees. We have been able to recover the initially imposed rotation jet profile for models at moderate inclination angle (< 15 degrees) and without precession (abridged).

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the differences in}} mechanical feedback from radio-loud and radio-quiet Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) on the host galaxy, we perform 3 D AMR hydrodynamic simulations of wide angle, radio-quiet winds with different inclinations on a single, massive, gas-rich disk galaxy at a redshift of 2 - 3. We compare our results to hydrodynamic simulations of the same galaxy but with a jet. The <b>jet</b> has an <b>inclination</b> of 0 degrees (perpendicular to the galactic plane), and the winds have inclinations of 0, 45, and 90 degrees. We analyze {{the impact on the}} host's gas, star formation, and circum-galactic medium. We find that jet feedback is energy-driven and wind feedback is momentum-driven. In all the simulations, the jet or wind creates a cavity mostly devoid of dense gas in the nuclear region where star formation is then quenched, but we find strong positive feedback in all the simulations at radii greater than 3 kpc. All four simulations have similar SFRs and stellar velocities with large radial and vertical components. However, the wind at an inclination of 90 degrees creates the highest density regions through ram pressure and generates the highest rates of star formation due to its ongoing strong interaction with the dense gas of the galactic plane. With increased wind inclination, we find greater asymmetry in gas distribution and resulting star formation. Our model generates an expanding ring of triggered star formation with typical velocity of order 1 / 3 of the circular velocity, superimposed on the older stellar population. This should result in a potentially detectable blue asymmetry in stellar absorption features at kpc scales...|$|R
