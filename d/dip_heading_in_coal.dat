40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the hyper excitability caused by administration of Fluoxetine which is a highly prescribed antidepressant belonging to a Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor class. Behavioral activities were observed on Cage Crossing, Forced Swim Test, Open Field Test and <b>Head</b> <b>Dip</b> Test. These activities were observed on rodents after 60 days of oral Fluoxetine treatment and were compared with untreated control animals. The results clearly showed that Fluoxetine caused significant increase <b>in</b> number of <b>head</b> <b>dips</b> <b>in</b> <b>head</b> <b>dip</b> test, significant increase in number of cage crosses in cage crossing, significant increase in number of squares crossed in an open field apparatus and significant increase in struggling time in forced swim test. Thus overall results indicated hyper excitability in treated animals. Hence, outcomes suggest that Fluoxetine can lead to hyper excitation in behavior and produce anxiety and therefore strongly implies that Fluoxetine use may also require an anxiolytic drug to antagonize this hyper excitability...|$|R

40|$|The {{impact of}} {{production}} systems {{on the welfare}} of ducks grown for meat is becoming increasingly controversial. In the UK, approximately 18 million ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) were reared for meat in 2006 (British Poultry Council, 2008; [URL] Despite the association between ducks and water in the wild, there are no legal requirements {{for them to have}} water for bathing or swimming. Some have troughs in which they <b>dip</b> their <b>heads</b> and splash water onto their bodies but for some, their only contact with water is drinking water from ball-bearing 'nipples'. The Council of Europe (1999) recommends that ducks should be able to <b>dip</b> their <b>heads</b> <b>in</b> water and spread water over their feathers. We here provide clear evidence that duck welfare is related to {{the nature and extent of}} their access to water. We recorded body and plumage condition and undertook three behavioural techniques to assess the effect of water source on the welfare of ducks. Ducks were reared with access to one of five water sources: a bath (small pond), a trough, an overhead shower, nipple drinkers only or nipple drinkers until 5 weeks and a bath thereafter. Their behaviour was assessed by recording (i) the time spent with a single resource, (ii) rebound in water related behaviour when given access to a bath and (iii) their preference for water source when given a four-way choice of all resources. The results showed that without the opportunity to at least <b>dip</b> their <b>heads</b> and splash their feathers with water, ducks were unable to keep their eyes, nostrils and feathers fully clean. Importantly, there was no difference in the time spent bathing from the bath, trough or shower, indicating resources were equivalent in their provision of bathing water. Very little time, however, was spent showing bathing movements at the nipples. Only ducks in the nipple-only group showed 'compensatory rebound' when finally given access to water in a bath, indicating previous bathing deprivation. There was no rebound in groups reared with a trough or shower, again indicating that the trough and shower were equivalent to the bath in its provision of bathing water. When given choice, the ducks preferred to rest and drink-dabble with the shower, and bathe with the bath; the shower was intermediate to the trough. Little time was spent with the nipples when the ducks were given access to other water sources and little time was spent swimming in the bath. The results suggest that commercial farmers may be able to improve duck welfare as much by providing water in troughs or from overhead showers (both clean and economical of water) as from actual ponds (baths). © 2008 Elsevier B.

Most modern authors recognize one species with three disjunct populations that were previously treated as subspecies, although the status of one extinct population from the Philippines is uncertain. The sarus cranes in India (previously of the sub-species antigone) are the largest, and in the east from Myanmar is replaced by a population that extends into Southeast Asia (previously of the sub-species sharpii). The sarus cranes from the Indian subcontinent are well marked and differentiated from the south-eastern population by having a white collar below the bare head and upper neck, and white tertiary remiges. The population in Australia (initially placed in sharpii (sometimes spelt sharpei but amended to conform to the rules of Latin grammar) was separated and named as the race gilliae, sometimes spelt gillae or even gilli), prior to a genetic analysis. Recent genetic analyses shows these three populations as representatives of a formerly continuous population that varies clinally. The Australian race was designated only in 1988, with the species itself first noticed in Australia in 1969 and regarded as a recent immigrant. Native Australians, however, differentiated the sarus and the brolga and called the sarus [...] "the crane that <b>dips</b> its <b>head</b> <b>in</b> blood".

50|$|He then {{commenced}} {{his attempt}} to take Massagetae territory by force (ca. 529), beginning by building bridges and towered war boats along {{his side of the}} river Jaxartes, or Syr Darya, which separated them. Sending him a warning to cease his encroachment (a warning which she stated she expected he would disregard anyway), Tomyris challenged him to meet her forces in honorable warfare, inviting him to a location in her country a day's march from the river, where their two armies would formally engage each other. He accepted her offer, but, learning that the Massagetae were unfamiliar with wine and its intoxicating effects, he set up and then left camp with plenty of it behind, taking his best soldiers with him and leaving the least capable ones. The general of Tomyris's army, Spargapises, who was also her son, and a third of the Massagetian troops, killed the group Cyrus had left there and, finding the camp well stocked with food and the wine, unwittingly drank themselves into inebriation, diminishing their capability to defend themselves when they were then overtaken by a surprise attack. They were successfully defeated, and, although he was taken prisoner, Spargapises committed suicide once he regained sobriety. Upon learning of what had transpired, Tomyris denounced Cyrus's tactics as underhanded and swore vengeance, leading a second wave of troops into battle herself. Cyrus the Great was ultimately killed, and his forces suffered massive casualties in what Herodotus referred to as the fiercest battle of his career and the ancient world. When it was over, Tomyris ordered the body of Cyrus brought to her, then decapitated him and <b>dipped</b> his <b>head</b> <b>in</b> a vessel of blood in a symbolic gesture of revenge for his bloodlust and the death of her son. However, some scholars question this version, mostly because Herodotus admits this event was one of many versions of Cyrus's death that he heard from a supposedly reliable source who told him no one was there to see the aftermath.|$|R

LPS-exposure resulted {{in the production of}} cytokines and oxidative damage. On the contrary, astaxanthin is a carotenoid compound, showed neuroprotective properties via its antioxidant capacity. This study examines the effect of astaxanthin on the prenatal maternal LPS-induced postnatal behavioral deficit in mice. Results: We found that prenatal LPS-exposed mice showed extensive immobile phase in the tail suspension test, higher frequent <b>head</b> <b>dipping</b> <b>in</b> the hole-board test and greater hypolocomotion in the open field test. All these values were statistically significant (p < 0. 05). In addition, a marked elevation of the level of lipid peroxidation, advanced protein oxidation product, nitric oxide, while a pronounced depletion of antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione) were observed in the adult offspring mice that were prenatally exposed to LPS. To the contrary, 6 -weeks long treatment with astaxanthin significantly improved all behavioral deficits (p < 0. 05) and diminished prenatal LPS-induced oxidative stress markers in the brain and liver. Conclusions: Taken together, these results suggest that prenatal maternal LPS-exposure leads to behavioral deficits in the adults, while astaxanthin ameliorates the behavioral deficits presumably via its antioxidant property...|$|R

Nursing dams of this well-validated genetic animal model of absence epilepsy and control dams were injected with haloperidol or saline at PPD 1 to 6. Maternal behavior was evaluated at PPD 7 to 9. Haloperidol-injected WAG/Rij dams showed more pup carryings compared with saline-injected mothers, this effect was not noticed in control Wistar dams. The offspring of haloperidol-treated WAG/Rij dams, tested during adulthood, showed heightened behavioral activity (time spent into the open arms, <b>head</b> <b>dips)</b> <b>in</b> the elevated plus-maze, as well as shorter spike-wave discharges (SWD) as measured in their electroencephalographic activity compared with saline-treated rats. Overall, {{it can be concluded}} that deviancies in the DA system as induced by haloperidol facilitates pup carrying/retrieval behavior in WAG/Rij rats and reduces seizure activity of the offspring in adulthood.

Apigenin was evaluated for antianxiety activity at {{a dose of}} 2 mg/kg using well established models of anxiety, the hole board test, light/dark test and mirrored chamber test. Apigenin significantly increased <b>head</b> <b>dipping</b> <b>in</b> hole board test. Further, apigenin increased latency to leave light zone and the time spent in light compartment of light/dark model of anxiety.
