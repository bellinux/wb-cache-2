50|$|Born in Walterskirchen in Lower Austria, he was {{the third}} son of Prince August Leopold of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha and his wife Archduchess Karoline Marie of Austria. At {{the time of his}} birth the House of Wettin ruled the <b>Kingdom</b> <b>of</b> Saxony and the Ernestine duchies in Germany, as well as the <b>kingdoms</b> <b>of</b> <b>Belgium,</b> Portugal, Bulgaria and the United Kingdom. He was raised, however, on his family's estates in Austria. After 1933 Prince Philipp {{supported}} financially German émigrés and Resistance to Nazism. 1934 he hired the well-known Christian opponent of the Nazi Party, Eugen Kogon to take over the asset management of the House of Saxe-Coburg-Koháry. After the Anschluss in March 1938 Kogon was arrested and, in September 1939, was deported to BuchenwaldWhen he was a teenager all five of the thrones held by his family in Germany were abolished, but his family retained their lands and private property until those located, after World War II, in East Germany and in other Iron Curtain countries were confiscated.

25|$|Since the {{founding}} of the <b>Kingdom</b> <b>of</b> <b>Belgium,</b> in 1830, Brussels has transformed from being almost entirely Dutch-speaking (Brabantian dialect to be exact), to being a multilingual city with French (specifically Belgian French) as the majority language and lingua franca. This language shift, the Francization of Brussels, is rooted in the 18th century and accelerated after Belgium became independent and Brussels expanded past its original boundaries.|$|E
25|$|The {{conquest of}} most of western Europe by Revolutionary and Napoleonic France led to the franc's wide circulation. Following {{independence}} from the Kingdom of the Netherlands, the new <b>Kingdom</b> <b>of</b> <b>Belgium</b> in 1832 adopted its own Belgian franc, equivalent to the French one, followed by Luxembourg adopting the Luxembourgish franc in 1848 and Switzerland in 1850. Newly unified Italy adopted the lira on a similar basis in 1862.|$|E

25|$|The Treaty of London of 1839, {{also called}} the First Treaty of London, the Convention of 1839, the Treaty of Separation, the Quintuple Treaty of 1839, or the Treaty of the XXIV articles, was a treaty signed on 19 April 1839 between the Concert of Europe, the United Kingdom of the Netherlands and the <b>Kingdom</b> <b>of</b> <b>Belgium.</b> It was a direct {{follow-up}} to the 1831 Treaty of the XVIII Articles which the Netherlands had refused to sign, {{and the result of}} negotiations at the London Conference of 1838–1839.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Kingdom</b> <b>of</b> <b>Belgium</b> signed no {{less than}} 289 {{treaties}} between 1883 and 1884 in the conquest of the valley of Kouilou-Niari, territory ceded to France at the Berlin conference in 1885. It ratifies all these treaties making France the absolute ruler of the part of Central Africa from the right bank of the Congo River to the confines of Gabon, thus completing the sharing of Africa between the colonial powers. The control of coastal bases also allowed the departure of numerous expeditions which took place to Chad and even Sudan (Fashoda incident).|$|E
50|$|Diplomatic {{relations}} were started in 1825 when Mexico established consular {{relations with the}} <b>Kingdom</b> <b>of</b> the Netherlands. <b>Belgium</b> became independent in 1830, and in 1838, representatives were sent to Mexico. The first consulate-level representatives were sent to Mexico in 1842. In 1861, both nations signed a Treaty of Friendship thus formally establishing diplomatic relations.|$|R
50|$|By the {{beginning}} of the 19th century, the royal houses of Bourbon (France, Spain, Sicily and Parma) and Savoy (<b>Kingdom</b> <b>of</b> Sardinia), had adopted this system of exclusively male hereditary succession. Napoleon Bonaparte's conquests then pushed the law into Sweden (beginning in 1810) and much of the Confederation of the Rhine. Other states adopted strict agnatic primogeniture as well, including Denmark (beginning in 1853) and the new <b>kingdoms</b> <b>of</b> Albania, <b>Belgium,</b> Bulgaria, Montenegro, Romania, and Serbia. During this era, Spain (in the Carlist conflicts) fought a civil war which pitted the Salic and female-line heirs of its dynasty against one another for possession of the crown.|$|R
25|$|The Germans in East Africa {{fought for}} the whole of the war, {{receiving}} word of the armistice on 14 November 1918 at 7:30a.m. Both sides waited for confirmation and the Germans formally surrendered on 25 November.

25|$|National {{orders are}} awarded by royal decree at fixed dates: 8 April (birthday of King Albert I), 15 November (King's Feast), {{and in some}} cases on 21 July (Belgian {{national}} holiday) to reward meritorious services to the <b>Kingdom</b> <b>of</b> <b>Belgium</b> based on the career path and age of the recipient. A number of different regulations rule the award of national orders for the various ministries. In addition, the national orders may be awarded by the king for especially meritorious deeds. The royal decrees are published in the Belgian official journal, Moniteur Belge.|$|E
25|$|After the Greek War of Independence (1821–32), Leopold {{was offered}} the crown of Greece but turned it down, believing it to be too precarious. Instead, Leopold {{accepted}} the kingship of the newly established <b>Kingdom</b> <b>of</b> <b>Belgium</b> in 1831. The Belgian government offered the position to Leopold because of his diplomatic connections with royal houses across Europe. In addition, because he {{was seen as a}} British-backed candidate, he was not affiliated to other powers, such as France, which were believed to have territorial ambitions in Belgium which might threaten the European balance of power created by the 1815 Congress of Vienna.|$|E
25|$|In the 1830, the {{southern}} provinces of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands broke off {{to form the}} <b>Kingdom</b> <b>of</b> <b>Belgium.</b> At the outbreak of this Belgian Revolution, most Luxembourgers joined the rebels, and from 1830 to 1839 almost all of Luxembourg was administered as part of Belgium. The fortress and city of Luxembourg, held by the Dutch and Prussian troops, was {{the only part of}} the country still loyal to the Dutch King William I. The stand-off was resolved in 1839, when the Treaty of London awarded the western part of Luxembourg to Belgium, while the rest (including the fortress) remained under William I.|$|E
5000|$|The basin was the {{watershed}} of the Congo River populated by pygmy peoples, and eventually Bantu peoples migrated there and founded the <b>Kingdom</b> <b>of</b> Kongo. <b>Belgium,</b> France, and Portugal later established colonial {{control over the}} entire region by the late 19th century. The General Act of the Berlin Conference of 1885 gave a precise definition to the [...] "conventional basin" [...] of the Congo, which included the entire actual basin plus some other areas. The General Act bound its signatories to neutrality within the conventional basin, {{but this was not}} respected during the First World War.|$|R
40|$|Though the <b>kingdoms</b> <b>of</b> <b>Belgium</b> and The Netherlands share {{a common}} history of only fifteen years (1815 - 30), they are {{nevertheless}} comparable in many respects. A skilful historian could certainly write a comparative history of both countries (Kossmann, 1978). Yet one should not exaggerate the similarities. Even though the Reformation reached the southern parts of the Low Countries (now in Belgium) earlier than the northern parts, it had a much greater impact in the latter area. The Dutch republic in the north gained independence from the Habsburg Empire about 200 years earlier than the southern provinces. The Industrial Revolution affected Belgium earlier than The Netherlands, which remained more dependent on agriculture {{as well as on}} trade and commerce. Dutch is spoken in both countries, but almost half <b>of</b> <b>Belgium</b> speaks another official language (41 per cent French, 1 per cent German), whereas only 3 per cent of its northern neighbour speaks another language (Frisian). These differences have {{had an impact on the}} party systems of the two countries. Even so, their parties can be compared, especially the Christian Democratic parties which have developed closer ties in recent years. According to Horner (1981), the Christian Democratic parties of the Low Countries are still confessional parties (Konjessionsparteien), whereas their sister parties in Germany and Italy are evolving towards liberal-conservative catch-all parties (Volksparteien). In this chapter Horner's thesis will be used to structure our survey of the historical origips and development, organisation, electorate, ideology and governmentrecords of the three parties. In each section, the two Belgian parties and the Dutch party will be treated separately...|$|R
5000|$|Neutral Moresnet or Altenberg (...) {{was a small}} Belgian-Prussian {{condominium}} in central-western Europe {{that existed}} from 1816 to 1920 and was jointly administered by the United <b>Kingdom</b> <b>of</b> the Netherlands (<b>Belgium</b> after its independence in 1830) and the <b>Kingdom</b> <b>of</b> Prussia. After 1830, the territory's northernmost border point at Vaalserberg connected it to a quadripoint shared additionally with the Dutch Province of Limburg, the Prussian Rhine Province, and the Belgian Province of Liège.

25|$|Both the Flemish Community and the Flemish Region are {{constitutional}} {{institutions of}} the <b>Kingdom</b> <b>of</b> <b>Belgium,</b> exercising certain powers within their jurisdiction, granted following a series of state reforms.

The parliament is a directly elected legislative body composed of 124 representatives. The government consists of up {{to a maximum of}} eleven members and is presided by a Minister-President, currently Geert Bourgeois (New Flemish Alliance) leading a coalition of his party (N-VA) with Christen-Democratisch en Vlaams (CD) and Open Vlaamse Liberalen en Democraten (Open VLD).|$|E
25|$|Charles Étienne de Ghigny (14 January 1771 – 1 December 1844) {{commanded}} a Kingdom of the Netherlands light cavalry brigade at the Battle of Waterloo.

He fought in the Peninsular War in 1810–1811 and in the latter year became colonel of the regiment. He fought in the 1812 French invasion of Russia, the 1813 German Campaign and the 1814 French Campaign. In 1814 he led a cavalry regiment at Fère-Champenoise and Paris. He changed his allegiance to the Netherlands in 1815 and was appointed major general. He was promoted to lieutenant general in 1826. He switched allegiance to the <b>Kingdom</b> <b>of</b> <b>Belgium</b> in 1831 and received the Order of Leopold in 1837.|$|E
25|$|Promoted to {{rear admiral}} on 19 July 1821, Gage was {{appointed}} Commander-in-Chief, East Indies Station, with his flag in the third-rate HMS Warspite, in December 1825.

50|$|As the Western Roman Empire {{collapsed}} {{during the}} 5th and 6th centuries, Germanic tribes invaded and established themselves.
