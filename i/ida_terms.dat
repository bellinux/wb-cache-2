40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{an ongoing}} environmental conflict over {{the prospect of}} gold mining at Mount Ida, Turkey, and aims to unpack the valuation languages social actors in the conflict use to either support or oppose gold mining. Based on a field study consisting of 37 in-depth interviews, three focus groups, and a survey administered {{to a total of}} 738 citizens, the factors that affect local public's positions vis-Ã -vis gold mining at Mount Ida and their choice of valuation languages are examined. Assessing the conflict at Mount <b>Ida</b> in <b>terms</b> of valuation languages enables us to better comprehend the various dimensions of the conflict and differentiate between the disagreements that can be controlled and solved via technical measures or bargaining over the amount of monetary compensation and those that cannot. We also intend to provide a useful and general methodology that combines qualitative and quantitative research methods for understanding a broad range of environmental conflicts. The results are in line with earlier findings in that local people oppose such projects for various distinct reasons and monetary and/or technical compensatory schemes do not suffice to solve the disagreements that arise in a satisfactory way.

40|$|AbstractTo {{explore the}} {{structural}} basis {{required for the}} holoenzyme formation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase, we have prepared rabbit anti-peptide antibodies that can block the holoenzyme formation without affecting the catalytic activity of the enzyme. The antibodies were raised against a specific site in the catalytic (C) -subunit, <b>termed</b> <b>IDA</b> (Inter-DFG-APE) region, which lies between the kinase subdomains VII and VIII. Although the C-subunit immunoprecipitated with anti-IDA antibodies could not form a stable complex with regulatory (R) -subunit, it was still susceptible to inhibition by the R-subunit or by PKI, a specific inhibitor peptide containing a pseudosubstrate site. These results indicate that there exists an IDA regionmediated interaction between the R- and C-subunits, which is distinct from that mediated through the substrate site and substrate binding site. In accordance with this idea, association of synthetic IDA peptides with the R-subunit was directly demonstrated by resonance mirror analysis. The calculated association constants of IDA peptides were high enough to suggest a possible involvement of the IDA region in the initial step of holoenzyme formation...|$|R
40|$|Background Iron {{deficiency}} {{childhood is}} a concern due to its potentially detrimental effects on development, {{some of which may}} be irreversible even after iron treatment. Delayed cord clamping may prevent IDA by increasing an infant's iron reserve at birth. Objective We aimed to evaluate the effect of delayed umbilical cord clamping at birth on the iron status in newborns at age 24 hours of life. Methods This randomized, singleblind study was conducted from March to May 2009, at two general hospitals in Medan, North Sumatera Province. Eligible newborn infants were {{randomly assigned to one of}} two groups: early cord clamping (Eee) performed 15 seconds after delivery or delayed cord clamping (DeC) performed 2 minutes after delivery. Infants were placed on their mothers' abdomens before the umbilical cords were clamped. Hematologic status was determined from umbilical cord blood. Results Sixtythree subjects were included in our study, consisting of 31 infants in the Eee group and 32 infants in the Dec group. We found that mean neonatal hemoglobin level was higher in the Dec group than in the Eee group (18. 4 g% and 16. 2 g%, respectively, P=O. OOOl). Also, mean ferritin level was higher in the Dec group than in the Eee group (556 mg/dL and 329 mg/ dL, respectively, p=o. o 15). Other hematological status indicators, including mean hematocrit and mean corpuscular volume (MeV) level, were also higher in the Dec group. However, mean red blood cell levels were not significantly groups. Nor was there a significant level between the Dec and Eee groups.

40|$|Recent seismic events {{occurred}} in Italy (Emilia-Romagna 2012, Abruzzo 2009) and worldwide (New Zealand 2010 and 2011) highlighted {{some of the}} weaknesses of precast concrete industrial buildings, especially those related to the connecting systems traditionally employed to fasten the cladding panels to the internal framing. In fact, {{one of the most}} commons fails it is possible to observe in such structural typologies is related to the out-of-plane collapse of the external walls due to the unsatisfactory behaviour of the connectors used to join the panels to the perimeter beams. In this work, the strengthening of a traditional industrial building, assumed as a case study, made by precast reinforced concrete is proposed by the adoption of a dual system allowing the reinforcement of the structure by acting both internally; by pendular columns and, externally, on the walls. In particular, traditional connections {{at the top of the}} walls are substituted by devices able to work as a slider with vertical axis while, the bottom of the walls is equipped with two or more hysteretic dampers working on the uplift of the cladding panels occurring under seismic actions. By means of this approach, the structure is stiffened; obtaining a reduction of the lateral drifts under serviceability limit states. In addition, its seismic behaviour is improved due to the additional source of energy dissipation represented by the dampers located at the base of the walls. The effectiveness of the suggested retrofitting approach has been checked by comparing the performance of the retrofitted structure with those of the structure unreinforced by means of both pushover and Incremental Dynamic Analyses (<b>IDA)</b> in <b>terms</b> of behaviour factor, assumed as a measure of the ductility capacity of the structure...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{assess the}} level of {{awareness}} about causes, prevention and treatment of iron deficiency anemia among women of reproductive age in Hubei province, a south eastern province of China. Method: Cross sectional study was conducted by using a self designed standardized pretested questionnaire in peripheral areas of Wuhan city, the capital of Hubei province from January 2009 to December 2009. Women aged 18 - 45 years without any previous history of medical or gynecological problems were recruited. Results: A total 385 women were surveyed for Iron Deficiency Anemia (IDA). 77. 9 % women (n= 300) {{were aware of the}} <b>term</b> <b>IDA,</b> with the highest proportion of 88. 1 % falling in age group 25 - 35 years. Most of the women were {{aware of the fact that}} their diet contains iron and its importance in health. Women who had children and of working class had greater knowledge about the iron deficiency anemia. Conclusion: Awareness regarding IDA is directly linked with the educational and social status of a community and is found to be increasing with the passage of time with exploration and accessibility to media and health care facilities. Women of younger ages are more concern about their own health and much careful about their expected babies in terms of nutritional facts as compared to the elder ladies...|$|R
40|$|Primary ciliary {{dyskinesia}} (PCD) is {{a genetically}} heterogeneous disorder caused by cilia and sperm dysmotility. About 12 % of cases show perturbed 9 + 2 microtubule cilia structure and inner dynein arm (<b>IDA)</b> loss, historically <b>termed</b> 'radial spoke defect'. We sequenced CCDC 39 and CCDC 40 in 54 'radial spoke defect' families, {{as these are}} the two genes identified so far to cause this defect. We discovered biallelic mutations in a remarkable 69 % (37 / 54) of families, including identification of 25 (19 novel) mutant alleles (12 in CCDC 39 and 13 in CCDC 40). All the mutations were nonsense, splice and frameshift predicting early protein truncation, which suggests this defect is caused by 'null' alleles conferring complete protein loss. Most families (73 %; 27 / 37) had homozygous mutations, including families from outbred populations. A major putative hotspot mutation was identified, CCDC 40 c. 248 delC, {{as well as several}} other possible hotspot mutations. Together, these findings highlight the key role of CCDC 39 and CCDC 40 in PCD with axonemal disorganisation and IDA loss, and these genes represent major candidates for genetic testing in families affected by this ciliary phenotype. We show that radial spoke structures are largely intact in these patients and propose this ciliary ultrastructural abnormality be referred to as 'IDA and nexin-dynein regulatory complex (N-DRC) defect', rather than 'radial spoke defect'...|$|R
