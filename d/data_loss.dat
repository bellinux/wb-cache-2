Due to the immense size of the Jupiter system and the relative closeness of the Jovian system to Earth in comparison to the closeness of Pluto to Earth, New Horizons sent back more data to Earth from the Jupiter encounter than the Pluto encounter.|$|E
5|$|Although the MSS was {{the most}} useful {{instrument}} on Landsat 2, sometimes the data recorded was anomalous. The U.S. Geological Service (USGS) would identify these anomalies and document them. Known issues on the MSS are: banding, coherent noise, <b>data</b> <b>loss,</b> impulse noise, oversaturation, scan correlated shift (SCS), scan mirror pulse, and transmission striping. Transmission striping occurred when data from an individual sensor was lost. Most commonly, multiple data losses occurred simultaneously, resulting in an image with colored bands on it. This form of data anomaly could not be corrected in post processing.|$|E
5|$|The {{suite of}} pre-loaded apps bundled with Windows 8 were changed in Windows 8.1; PC Settings was {{expanded}} to include options that were previously exclusive to the desktop Control Panel, Windows Store was updated with an improved interface for browsing apps and automatic updates, the Mail app includes an updated interface and additional features, the Camera app integrates Photosynth for creating panoramas, and additional editing tools {{were added to the}} Photos app (while integration with Flickr and Facebook was completely removed). A number of additional stock apps were also added, including Calculator, Food and Drink, Health and Fitness, Sound Recorder, Reading List (which can be used to collect and sync content from apps through OneDrive), Scan, and Help + Tips. For Windows RT users, Windows 8.1 also adds a version of Microsoft Outlook to the included Office 2013 RT suite. However, it does not support <b>data</b> <b>loss</b> protection, Group Policy, Lync integration, or creating emails with information rights management. Windows Store is enabled by default within Windows To Go environments.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the problem of {{attitude}} estimation for an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) with four rotors using an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) when <b>data</b> <b>losses</b> are considered. Actually, this situation may arise when control of the quadrotor is performed through a network. The quadrotor attitude is estimated with measurements from an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) composed of 3 rate gyros, a triaxis accelerometer and a triaxis magnetometer. A modified EKF is proposed that takes into account <b>data</b> <b>losses.</b> To model the <b>data</b> <b>losses,</b> the covariance matrix (R) associated with the measurement equation is modified in order to attach less confidence in the measurement that has been lost...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—The rise of {{the social}} web has brought a series of privacy {{concerns}} and threats. In particular, data leakage is a risk that affects the privacy of not only companies but individuals. Although there are tools that can prevent <b>data</b> <b>losses,</b> they require a prior step that involves the sensitive data to be properly identified. In this paper, we propose a new automatic approach that applies Named Entity Recognition (NER) to prevent data leaks. We conduct an empirical study with real-world data and show that this NER-based approach can enhance the prevention of <b>data</b> <b>losses.</b> In addition, we present and detail {{the implementation of a}} prototype built with these techniques and show how it can be used by both particulars and companies in order to handle <b>data</b> <b>losses.</b> I...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In this work, {{we focus}} on model {{predictive}} control of nonlinear systems subject to <b>data</b> <b>losses.</b> The motivation for consid-ering this problem is provided by wireless networked control sys-tems and control of nonlinear systems under asynchronous mea-surement sampling. In order to regulate {{the state of the}} system to-wards an equilibrium point while minimizing a given performance index, we propose a Lyapunov-based model predictive controller which is designed taking <b>data</b> <b>losses</b> explicitly into account, both in the optimization problem formulation and in the controller im-plementation. The proposed controller allows for an explicit char-acterization of the stability region and guarantees that this region is an invariant set for the closed-loop system under <b>data</b> <b>losses,</b> if the maximum time in which the loop is open is shorter than a given constant that depends on the parameters of the system and the Lya-punov-based controller that is used to formulate the optimization problem. The theoretical results are demonstrated through a chem-ical process example.

40|$|Abstract—In {{distributed}} storage systems, {{a substantial}} {{volume of data}} are stored in a distributed fashion, across {{a large number of}} storage nodes. To maintain data integrity, when existing storage nodes fail, lost data are regenerated at replacement nodes. Regenerating multiple <b>data</b> <b>losses</b> in batches can reduce the consumption of bandwidth. However, existing schemes are only able to achieve lower bandwidth consumption by utilizing a large number of participating nodes. In this paper, we propose a cooperative pipelined regeneration process that regenerates multiple <b>data</b> <b>losses</b> cooperatively with much fewer participating nodes. We show that cooperative pipelined regeneration is not only able to maintain optimal data integrity, but also able to further reduce the consumption of bandwidth as well. I...|$|R
40|$|The {{importance}} of temperature control to HEFLEX, a Spacelab experiment {{designed to measure}} kinetic properties of Helianthis nutation in a low-g environment, is discussed. It is argued {{that the development of}} the HEFLEX experiment has been severely hampered by the inadequate control of ambient air temperature provided by the spacecraft module design. A worst case calculation shows that delivery of only 69 % of the maximum yield of useful data from the HEFLEX system is guaranteed; significant <b>data</b> <b>losses</b> from inadequate temperature control are expected. The magnitude of the expected <b>data</b> <b>losses</b> indicates that the cost reductions associated with imprecise temperature controls may prove to be a false economy in the long term...|$|R

Based on the traffic model, we have developed (i) efficient network techniques for providing application-level delay guarantees, (ii) an admission control algorithm for a statistical service that bounds application <b>data</b> <b>losses</b> below a specified value, and (iii) network techniques for managing application <b>data</b> <b>losses</b> to achieve fairness and protection of high priority data units marked by applications (e. g., I frames of MPEG applications) ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—A {{detailed}} experimental comparison {{study of}} several published algorithms for motion and force control of bilateral teleoperators, {{with emphasis on}} Internet-based teleoperation, is presented. The study investigates the effects of <b>data</b> <b>losses,</b> communication delays, and environmental constraints on a teleoperation system for different control techniques, {{which are based on}} wave variables, Smith predictors, and recent algorithms on synchronization. The controllers are compared on stability, transparency, and complexity using two identical nonlinear robots coupled via a stochastic network model that allowed transmission round-trip delays and data-loss rates to range from 8 to 1088 ms and 0 % to 50 %, respectively. A total of 18 subjects, which were distributed among 26 experiments with the aims of regulating the effects of the operators learning process and dynamic properties, participated in this study. Overall, the comparison study reports a deteriorating effect in the performance (i. e., larger position errors and lower fidelity of contact information) from delays and <b>data</b> <b>losses.</b> Yet, the effect of <b>data</b> <b>losses</b> is less critical when compared with time delays. In addition, the preference for a particular control framework is shown to strongly depend on the operational conditions of the system, such as the characteristics of the coupling channel, the specifics of the remote task, and the computational capabilities of the manipulators.
