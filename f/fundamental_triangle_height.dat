40|$|Aortic interleaflet {{triangle}} reshaping (AITR) is {{a surgical}} approach to aortic valve incontinence that involves placing three stitches at {{half of the}} interleaflet <b>triangles</b> <b>height.</b> In this work, {{the relationship between the}} actual stitch height and valve functioning, and the safety margin that the surgeon can rely on in applying the stitches were systematically investigated in vitro. AITR surgery was applied to six swine aortic roots placing the stitches empirically at 50 %, 60 % and 75 % of the <b>triangle</b> <b>heights.</b> Then the actual stitch heights were measured and the hydrodynamic performances were evaluated with a pulsatile hydrodynamic mock loop. Actual stitch heights were 45 �� 2 % 61 �� 4 % and 79 �� 6 %. As compared to untreated conditions, the 50 % configuration induced a significant variation in the effective orifice area. With stitches placed at 60 %, the mean systolic pressure drop increased significantly with respect to the untreated case, but no significant changes were recorded with respect to the 50 % configuration. At 75 %, all the hydrodynamic parameters of systolic valve functioning worsened significantly. Summarizing, the AITR technique, when performed in a conservative manner did not induce significant alterations in the hydrodynamics of the aortic root in vitro, while more aggressive configurations did. The absence of a statistically significant difference between the 50 % and 60 % configurations suggests that there is a reasonably limited risk of inducing valve stenosis in the post-op scenario due to stitch misplacement...|$|R

There is no explicit discussion on linearity in literature, although some existing shape measures may be adapted.

These linearity measures should also be calculated very quickly and be resistant to protrusions in the data set. The measures of eccentricity and contour smoothness were adapted from literature, the other five being <b>triangle</b> <b>heights,</b> <b>triangle</b> perimeters, rotation correlation, average orientations, and ellipse axis ratio. The algorithms are tested on 30 sample curves {{and the results are}} compared against the linear classifications of these curves by human subjects. It is found that humans and computers typically easily identify sets of points that are clearly linear, and sets of points that are clearly not linear. They have trouble measuring sets of points which are in the gray area in-between. Although they appear to be conceptually very different approaches, we prove, theoretically and experimentally, that eccentricity and rotation correlation yield exactly the same linearity measurements. They however provide results which are furthest from human measurements. The average orientations method provides the closest results to human perception, while the other algorithms proved themselves to be very competitive...|$|R
