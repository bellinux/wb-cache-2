5|$|Although {{set in a}} hospital, it uses {{no medical}} storylines; the action is {{produced}} {{by a series of}} soap opera-style twists and turns <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>personal</b> lives of the characters. They proceed through a series of often absurd sketch-like scenes, or by sequences where the film is slowed down or sped up, often emphasizing the body language of the characters. The show had eight writers. Two series were made by the Talkback Thames production company for Channel 4.|$|E
5|$|Clarke {{composed}} no {{large scale}} {{works such as}} symphonies. Her total output of compositions comprises 52 songs, 11 choral works, 21 chamber pieces, the Piano Trio, and the Viola Sonata. Her work was all but forgotten {{for a long period}} of time, but interest in it was revived in 1976 following a radio broadcast in celebration of her ninetieth birthday. Over half of Clarke's compositions remain unpublished and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>personal</b> possession of her heirs, along with most of her writings. However, in the early 2000s more of her works were printed and recorded. Examples of recent publications include two string quartets and Morpheus, published in 2002.|$|E

5|$|Code of Vengeance is the {{umbrella}} title {{for a series}} of American television programs, produced by Universal Television, that aired on NBC in 1985 and 1986. Charles Taylor stars as David Dalton, a Vietnam veteran who has become a drifter, travelling across the United States in a camper van with only his dog for company. Dalton gets involved <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>personal</b> lives of the people he meets and uses his fighting skills to help them win justice.|$|E
5|$|Digital {{forensics}} (sometimes {{known as}} digital forensic science) is {{a branch of}} forensic science encompassing the recovery and investigation of material found in digital devices, often in relation to computer crime. The term digital forensics was originally used as a synonym for computer forensics but has expanded to cover investigation of all devices capable of storing digital data. With roots <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>personal</b> computing revolution of the late 1970s and early 1980s, the discipline evolved in a haphazard manner during the 1990s, {{and it was not}} until the early 21st century that national policies emerged.|$|E
5|$|Ron, {{who has an}} {{extremely}} deadpan and masculine personality, actively works to make city hall less effective and despises interacting with the public. He loves meat, woodworking, hunting, whisky, and breakfast foods. He hates and fears his two ex-wives, both named Tammy, {{one of whom is}} played by Offerman's real-life wife, Megan Mullally. Ron claims not to be interested <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>personal</b> lives of those around him but actually cares a great deal about his colleagues, and has a particularly strong respect for Leslie.|$|E

5|$|Although Woodfull was {{a devout}} Methodist, {{he would show}} a deep concern <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>personal</b> welfare of all players, which {{extended}} to finding {{the location of the}} nearest Catholic Church for those teammates who followed the religion. At the time, Australian society at large was divided along Catholic-Protestant lines, and while O'Reilly and McCabe were full of praise for Woodfull, they were later accused of leading a Catholic revolt against the leadership of the Protestant Bradman during a divisive period in the late-1930s. While Woodfull himself never touched alcohol due to his strict adherence to his religious principles, he did not impose his beliefs on his team. He would buy drinks for his players, and ask administrators to provide more alcohol for his teammates when they were exhausted. At the time, cricketers widely regarded beer as a highly effective means of rehydration, and on one occasion Woodfull threatened to halt play when administrators refused his players more ale {{on the grounds that they}} had already consumed their quota.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{the other}} kings of the Fifth Dynasty, Shepseskare's name appears neither <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>personal</b> {{names of people}} of the time nor {{in the names of}} funerary estates. He is also absent from the titles and biographies of state {{official}}s. For example, the stela of the Fifth Dynasty official Khau-Ptah lists an uninterrupted sequence of kings whom he served under, namely Sahure, Neferirkare, Neferefre and Nyuserre. The omission of Shepseskare, be it between Neferirkare and Neferefre or between Neferefre and Nyuserre, indicates that his reign must have been very short. Since Manetho's Aegyptiaca dates to the 3rd century BC, Khau-Ptah's contemporary account can be regarded as a more accurate indication of the political situation during the Fifth Dynasty.|$|E
