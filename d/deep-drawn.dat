2500|$|Three-piece can {{construction}} {{results in}} {{top and bottom}} rims. In two-piece construction, one piece is a flat top {{and the other a}} <b>deep-drawn</b> cup-shaped piece that combines the (at least roughly) cylindrical wall and the round base. Transition between wall and base is usually gradual. [...] Such cans have a single rim at the top. Some cans have a separate cover that slides onto the top or is hinged.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Wentworth {{maintained}} {{for a while}} a silence more expressive than a <b>deep-drawn</b> sigh. [...] "You have no children," [...] he said at last.|$|E
6000|$|The tears {{stood in}} poor Kea's eyes, though Frank {{did not notice}} them. [...] "Higher than a chief," [...] she {{answered}} slowly, with a <b>deep-drawn</b> sigh.|$|E
60|$|The {{other men}} shifted {{from one foot}} to another and there were <b>deep-drawn</b> breaths. Jim Cleve alone seemed quiet and cool. But his eyes were ablaze.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well! we owe {{our lives}} to them," [...] said Madame with <b>deep-drawn</b> sigh. [...] "I wonder if we shall ever see any of those fine fellows again!" ...|$|E
6000|$|Thus spake {{the mighty}} Mount, and I [...] Made answer, with a <b>deep-drawn</b> sigh:-- [...] Thou ancient Skiddaw, by this tear, [...] 70 [...] I would, I would that she were here!' ...|$|E
6000|$|Queeker fetched a long <b>deep-drawn</b> sigh at this point, {{the agony}} of intense {{composition}} being for a moment relaxed. Then, catching his breath and glaring, he went on in a somewhat gentler strain-- ...|$|E
60|$|The {{two doors}} slammed {{at the same}} moment, and Weedon Scott waited for Matt to come around to the front. From inside the door came a low whining and sobbing. Then there were long, <b>deep-drawn</b> sniffs.|$|E
6000|$|Among {{the rocks}} and winding crags; [...] Among the {{mountains}} far away; [...] Once more the Ass did lengthen out [...] More ruefully a <b>deep-drawn</b> shout, [...] The hard dry see-saw of his horrible bray! [50] [...] 480 ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's {{only the}} doctor," [...] said Mrs. Rook. She crossed {{her hands over}} her bosom with a <b>deep-drawn</b> sigh. [...] "I want no doctor, now. My peace is made with my Maker. I'm ready for death; I'm fit for Heaven. Go away! go away!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But how dreadful {{it is to}} think, dear," [...] Mrs. Ellis remarked for {{the twentieth}} time since their arrival, with a <b>deep-drawn</b> sigh, [...] "how dreadful {{to think that you}} and Felix should have been all those months alone on the island {{together}} without being married!" ...|$|E
60|$|The wizard paused, {{and looked}} round. There was a <b>deep-drawn</b> sigh, {{as if the}} {{audience}} had been relieved from a severe strain of attention. And so they had; and the wizard accepted that involuntary sigh as an evidence {{of the success of}} his effort to amuse.|$|E
60|$|Somehow the 'never more' overcame him completely. He had {{not before}} been beyond the {{restraint}} of guarding his feelings for Mary's sake; and, tired {{with the long}} day, and torn by the evening's narration, all his self-command gave way, and he fell into a perfect anguish of <b>deep-drawn,</b> almost hysterical sobbing.|$|E
60|$|He {{held up his}} arms, and {{let them}} drop again heavily to his side. It was a gesture full of sad {{dramatic}} pathos, but in that little room {{there was no one}} to observe it, no one to pity him for those white hairs and <b>deep-drawn</b> lines. But that was nothing. It was not pity that he wanted.|$|E
60|$|She hid {{her face}} in her hands, and made no answer, and I too turned away. But as I did so I heard a <b>deep-drawn</b> breath, and looking down {{perceived}} a line of colour creeping up Leo's face, then another and another, and then, wonder of wonders, the man we had thought dead turned over on his side.|$|E
6000|$|The {{young girl}} {{did not look}} round at that <b>deep-drawn</b> sigh of the man's; she did not lift her head even when he cleared his throat: but I was intent upon him, for I thought that these sounds preluded an {{overture}} (I am {{not sure of the}} figure) to my acquaintance, and in fact he actually asked, [...] "Do you know just when the concert begins?" ...|$|E
60|$|Once more he stopped. The frail figure {{which had}} been feebly {{rising out of the}} chair, while he held up the Hair Bracelet, {{suddenly}} and heavily sank back in it--he saw the eyelids half close, and a great stillness pass over the face--he heard one <b>deep-drawn</b> breath: but no cry now, no moaning, no murmuring--no sound whatever, except the steady splash of the fast-falling rain on the pavement outside.|$|E
6000|$|Those picket stars whose {{tranquil}} watch half soothed, half shamed [...] our sleep. [...] What recked we {{then what}} beasts or men around might lurk or creep? [...] We lay and heard with listless ears the far-off panther's cry, [...] The near coyote's snarling snap, the grizzly's <b>deep-drawn</b> sigh, [...] The brown bear's blundering human tread, the gray wolves' yelping [...] choir [...] Beyond the magic circle drawn {{around the old}} camp-fire.|$|E
6000|$|... "Seymour," [...] my {{brother-in-law}} said, with a <b>deep-drawn</b> sigh, {{as we left}} Lake George next day by the Rennselaer and Saratoga Railroad, [...] "no more Peter Porter for me, if you please! I'm sick of disguises. Now that we know Colonel Clay is here in America, they serve no good purpose; so I may as well receive the social consideration and proper respect to which my rank and position naturally entitle me." ...|$|E
60|$|The rest of {{the episode}} passed off quietly. Sebastian, having {{delivered}} his bolt, began to think less of Hilda {{and more of the}} patient. He went on with his demonstration. As for Hilda, she gradually relaxed her muscles, and, with a <b>deep-drawn</b> breath, resumed her natural attitude. The tension was over. They had had their little skirmish, whatever it might mean, and had it out; now, they called a truce over the patient's body.|$|E
60|$|Sound and deep, beyond natural rest, was {{the sleep}} of Hamish MacTavish on that eventful evening, but not such the repose of his mother. Scarce did she {{close her eyes}} from time to time, but she awakened again with a start, in the terror that her son had arisen and departed; {{and it was only}} on {{approaching}} his couch, and hearing his <b>deep-drawn</b> and regular breathing, that she reassured herself of the security of the repose in which he was plunged.|$|E
60|$|She {{held up her}} hand. A slow pulsation, {{that might}} have been the dull, labored beating of their own hearts, was making itself felt {{throughout}} the little cottage. It came nearer,--a deep regular inspiration that seemed slowly to fill and possess the whole tranquil summer twilight. It was nearer still--was abreast of the house--passed--grew fainter and at last died away like a <b>deep-drawn</b> sigh. It was the down boat, that was now separating Mr. Hamlin and his protegee, even as it had once brought them together.|$|E
6000|$|... "What could I do, unaided and unblest? [...] My [61] father! gone {{was every}} friend of thine: [...] 425 [...] And kindred of dead husband are at best [...] Small help; and, after {{marriage}} such as mine, [...] With little kindness would to me incline. [...] Nor was I [62] then for toil or service fit; [...] My <b>deep-drawn</b> sighs no effort could confine; [...] 430 [...] In open air forgetful would I sit [63] [...] Whole hours, with [64] idle arms in moping sorrow knit.|$|E
6000|$|So in {{they bear}} {{her to the}} chimney seat, [...] And busily, though yet with fear, untie [...] Her garments, and, to warm her icy feet [...] 570 [...] And chafe her temples, careful hands apply. [...] Nature reviving, with a <b>deep-drawn</b> sigh [...] She strove, and not in vain, her head to rear; [...] Then said--"I thank you all; if I must die, [...] The God in heaven my prayers for you will hear; [...] 575 [...] Till now I did not think my end had been so near.|$|E
60|$|The {{narrow streets}} roared with {{the wheels of}} cabs and {{carriages}} coming and going; the street before the theatre was so packed that it was some time before they could reach the door. Masks were passing in and out; the nervous joy of the ladies expressed itself in a <b>deep-drawn</b> quivering sigh. Their carriage door was opened by a servant of the theatre, who wished them a pleasant veglione, and the next moment {{they were in the}} crowded vestibule, where they paused a moment, to let Imogene and Effie really feel that {{they were part of a}} masquerade.|$|E
6000|$|Charles {{laid down}} the letter with a <b>deep-drawn</b> sigh. [...] "Sey, my boy," [...] he mused aloud, [...] "no fortune on earth--not even mine--can go on {{standing}} it. These perpetual drains begin really to terrify me. I foresee the end. I shall die in a workhouse. What with the money he robs me of when he is Colonel Clay, and the money I waste upon him when he isn't Colonel Clay, the man is beginning to tell upon my nervous system. I shall withdraw altogether from this worrying life. I shall retire from a scheming and polluted world to some untainted spot in the fresh, pure mountains." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, no; {{not that}} I know." [...] She mounted to the seat, and they drove {{off in a}} silence which endured for a long time. If Libby had been as vain as he seemed light, he must have found it cruelly unflattering, for it ignored his {{presence}} and even his existence. She broke the silence at last with a <b>deep-drawn</b> sigh, as frankly sad {{as if she had}} been quite alone, but she returned to consciousness of him in it. [...] "Mr. Libby, you must think it is very strange for me to ask you to drive me to Corbitant without troubling myself to tell you my errand." ...|$|E
6000|$|Morning {{light was}} {{streaming}} {{into the room}} when one of these swoons had fallen on her, and no means of restoration availed {{to bring her back}} to anything but a gasping condition, in which she lay supported in Rachel's arms. The doctor had his hand on her pulse, the only sounds outside were the twittering of the birds, and within, the ticking of the clock, Alick's <b>deep-drawn</b> breaths, and his uncle's prayer. Rachel felt a thrill pass through the form she was supporting, she looked at Mr. Harvey, and understood his glance, but neither moved till Mr. Clare's voice finished, when the doctor said, [...] "I feared she would have suffered much more. Thank God!" ...|$|E
6000|$|Such was the sad and gloomy hour [...] 55 [...] When anguish'd Care of sullen brow [...] Prepared the Poison's death-cold power. [...] Already to thy lips was rais'd the bowl, [...] When filial Pity stood thee by, [...] Thy fixéd eyes she bade thee roll [...] 60 [...] On {{scenes that}} well might melt thy soul-- [...] Thy native cot she held to view, [...] Thy native cot, where Peace ere long [...] Had listen'd to thy evening song; [...] Thy sister's shrieks she bade thee hear, [...] 65 [...] And mark thy mother's thrilling tear, [...] She made thee feel her <b>deep-drawn</b> sigh, [...] And all her silent agony of Woe.|$|E
6000|$|Those he liked? I {{seemed to}} float not into clearness, but into a darker obscure, {{and within a}} minute there had come to {{me out of my}} very pity the appalling alarm of his being perhaps innocent. It was for the instant {{confounding}} and bottomless, for if he WERE innocent, what then on earth was I? Paralyzed, while it lasted, by the mere brush of the question, I let him go a little, so that, with a <b>deep-drawn</b> sigh, he turned away from me again; which, as he faced toward the clear window, I suffered, feeling that I had nothing now there to keep him from. [...] "And did they repeat what you said?" [...] I went on after a moment.|$|E
60|$|At {{about the}} middle watch of the night a dusky figure crept through the low {{embrasure}} of the Commander's apartment. Other figures were flitting through the parade ground, which the Commander might have seen had he not slept so quietly. The intruder stepped noiselessly to the couch {{and listened to the}} sleeper's <b>deep-drawn</b> inspiration. Something glittered in the firelight as the savage lifted his arm; another moment and the sore perplexities of Hermenegildo Salvatierra would have been over, when suddenly the savage started and fell back in a paroxysm of terror. The Commander slept peacefully, but his right eye, widely opened, fixed and unaltered, glared coldly on the would-be assassin. The man fell to the earth in a fit, and the noise awoke the sleeper.|$|E
60|$|At this time, a Christian cavalier, of Cordova, {{hearing that}} a {{patriotic}} band of his countrymen had raised {{the standard of}} the cross {{in the mountains of}} the Asturias, resolved to join them, and unite in breaking the yoke of bondage. Secretly arming himself, and caparisoning his steed, he set forth from Cordova, and pursued his course by unfrequented mule-paths, and along the dry channels made by winter torrents. His spirit burned with indignation, whenever, on commanding a view over a long sweeping plain, he beheld the mosque swelling in the distance, and the Arab horsemen careering about, as if the rightful lords of the soil. Many a <b>deep-drawn</b> sigh, and heavy groan, also, did the good cavalier utter, on passing the ruins of churches and convents desolated by the conquerors.|$|E
60|$|One night, when, {{after a long}} dispute of this nature, {{the friends}} had {{separated}} and our hero had retired to bed, he was awakened about midnight by a suppressed groan. He started up and listened; {{it came from the}} apartment of Colonel Talbot, which was divided from his own by a wainscotted partition, with a door of communication. Waverley approached this door and distinctly heard one or two <b>deep-drawn</b> sighs. What could be the matter? The Colonel had parted from him apparently in his usual state of spirits. He must have been taken suddenly ill. Under this impression he opened the door of communication very gently, and perceived the Colonel, in his night-gown, seated by a table, on which lay a letter and a picture. He raised his head hastily, as Edward stood uncertain whether to advance or retire, and Waverley perceived that his cheeks were stained with tears.|$|E
60|$|Gabriel, {{leaning on}} his elbow, looked {{for a few moments}} unresentfully on her tangled hair and half-open mouth, {{listening}} to her <b>deep-drawn</b> breath. So she had had that romance in her life: a man had died for her sake. It hardly pained him now to think how poor a part he, her husband, had played in her life. He watched her while she slept, as though he and she had never lived together as man and wife. His curious eyes rested long upon her face and on her hair: and, as he thought of what she must have been then, in that time of her first girlish beauty, a strange, friendly pity for her entered his soul. He did not like to say even to himself that her face was no longer beautiful, but he knew that it was no longer the face for which Michael Furey had braved death.|$|E
60|$|His {{wife did}} not rouse herself to comfort him, but still lay motionless, {{excepting}} for a convulsive movement that passed over her frame at each sound from him, {{and her father}} felt her pulse bound {{at the same time}} with corresponding violence, as if each of his <b>deep-drawn</b> sobs were a mortal thrust. Going to him, Dr. May endeavoured to repress his agitation, and lead him from the room; but he could not, at first, prevail on him to listen or understand, still less, to quit Flora. The attempt to force on him the perception that his uncontrolled sorrow was injuring her, and that he ought to bear up for her sake, only did further harm; for, when he rose up and tried to caress her, there was the same torpid, passive resistance, the same burying her face from the light, and the only betrayal of consciousness in the agonised throbs of her pulse.|$|E
60|$|Dr. W. Ogle {{observed}} {{for me in}} one of the London hospitals about twenty patients, just before they were put under the influence of chloroform for operations. They exhibited some trepidation, but no great terror. In only four of the cases was the platysma visibly contracted; and it did not begin to contract until the patients began to cry. The muscle seemed to contract at the moment of each <b>deep-drawn</b> inspiration; so that it is very doubtful whether the contraction depended at all on the emotion of fear. In a fifth case, the patient, who was not chloroformed, was much terrified; and his platysma was more forcibly and persistently contracted than in the other cases. But even here there is room for doubt, for the muscle which appeared to be unusually developed, was seen by Dr. Ogle to contract as the man moved his head from the pillow, after the operation was over.|$|E
