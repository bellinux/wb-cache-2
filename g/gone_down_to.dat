5|$|The {{game would}} be the first of the 1985–86 season for both teams. Since the return fixture at Hampden Park on 27 March, both teams had played twice, with each playing one of the other teams in the {{qualifying}} group and a friendly. Wales had secured a comfortable home win against Spain in the World Cup qualifying tournament, but had <b>gone</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> defeat in Norway. Scotland meanwhile went into the match {{on the back of a}} pair of wins against England and Iceland.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal {{began the}} 2001–02 season in good form and a win against Liverpool in December 2001 – having <b>gone</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> ten {{men in the}} first half, helped them move second in the table. A draw against Southampton on 2 February 2002 started a run of 13 {{consecutive}} league wins – a new record, beginning against Everton. Arsenal won the league away to Manchester United at Old Trafford on 8 May 2002; the winning goal was scored by Sylvain Wiltord in the second half. The result meant the team were unbeaten away from home all season, and in scoring four goals against Everton on the final day, became {{the first team to}} score in every league match they played. Arsenal completed the double, having beaten Chelsea 2–0 in the 2002 FA Cup Final.|$|E

However, Sunderland {{levelled}} the score at 2–2 with goals from Ross Wallace on the 25th minute and Kenwyne Jones on the 48minute. Arsenal won the game 3–2 after a late Robin van Persie goal. Sunderland suffered back-to-back defeats when they lost 3–1 away to West Ham United on 21 October. Kenwyne Jones got the goal for Sunderland. Fulham came to the Stadium of Light on 27 October, Fulham {{took the lead in}} the 32nd minute with a 30yard free kick from Simon Davies. Sunderland snatched a point when Kenywyne Jones scored an 86th-minute equaliser. The wearsiders had <b>gone</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> ten men in the 67th minute when Greg Halford was sent off.|$|E

25|$|Anti-Americanism is {{felt very}} {{strongly}} in Jordan and {{has been on the}} rise since at least 2003. Despite the fact that Jordan is one of America's closest allies in the Middle East and the Government of Jordan is pro-American and pro-Western, the anti-Americanism of Jordanians is {{among the highest in the}} world. Anti-Americanism rose dramatically after the 2003 invasion of Iraq, when the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia and many other allies, invaded Iraq to remove Saddam Hussein from power. According to several Pew Research Attitudes polls conducted since 2003, 99% of Jordanians viewed the U.S. unfavorably and 82% of Jordanians viewed American people unfavorably. Although negative attitudes have <b>gone</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> 85%, anti-Americanism is still amongst the most widespread in Jordan than any other country in the world.|$|E

25|$|No famous surgeon, {{not even}} John Hunter (1728–1793), {{was likely to}} have founded his {{practice}} deeper in science than Paget did, or waited longer for his work {{to come back to}} him. In physiology, he had mastered the chief English, French, German, Dutch and Italian literature of the subject, and by incessant study and microscope work had put himself level with the most advanced knowledge of his time, so that it was said of him by Robert Owen, in 1851, that he had his choice, either to be the first physiologist in Europe, or to have the first surgical practice in London, with a baronetcy. His physiological lectures at St Bartholomew's Hospital were the chief cause of the rise in the fortunes of its school, which in 1843 had <b>gone</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> a low point.|$|E
25|$|To {{many people}} it {{appeared}} that the trouble in Larut was merely a continuation of the trouble between the Ghee Hin and Tua Pek Kong societies in Ujong Salang in 1859 which later spread to Penang. The Larut Wars were fought between Hakka and Hakka. The Hai San miners were mainly Hakka men from Cheng Sheng. The first two battles (1861 and 1865) were between the Cheng Sheng Hakka of the Hai San and the Hui Chew Hakka of the Ghee Hin. The Last two (1872 and 1873) were between the Cheng Sheng Hakka of the Hai San and the Sin Neng Hakka of the Ghee Hin, the Hui Chew Hakka from the Ghee Hin from the earlier two battles having <b>gone</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> Selangor to join Yap Ah Loy, a Hui Chew Hakka who was head of the Hai San in Selangor. Lee Ah Kun (Lee Ko Yin), Ho Ghi Siu and Chin Seng Yam (陈亚炎, Chin Ah Yam 陳亞炎) were Sin Neng Hakka.|$|E
25|$|On 17 February 2012, Hiddink agreed an 18-month deal {{to manage}} Russian club Anzhi Makhachkala, his first {{permanent}} club post in six years.

In the quarter-finals of the same competition, having <b>gone</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> ten men 55 minutes into the second leg against Newcastle United, Anzhi came close to going through when Mbark Boussoufa's free kick hit the post before Papiss Cissé headed home the winner in the last seconds of the tie, meaning the Magpies won 1–0 on aggregate. This was the second time that the English side have knocked out a team managed by Hiddink in the competition, having beaten his PSV side 3–2 on aggregate in the quarter-finals of the 2003–04 season.

500|$|As usual, the Earps {{carried their}} revolvers in their coat pockets {{or in their}} waistbands. Wyatt Earp was {{carrying}} a [...]44 caliber American 1869 Smith & Wesson revolver. Holliday was carrying a nickel-plated pistol in a holster, but this was concealed by his long coat, as was the shotgun. The Earps and Holliday walked west, down {{the south side of}} Fremont Street past the rear entrance to the O.K. Corral, but out of visual range of the Cowboys' last reported location. Near the corner of Fourth St. and Fremont St., the Earps ran into Sheriff Behan. He had left the Cowboys and came toward them, though he looked nervously backward several times. Virgil testified afterward that Behan told them, [...] "For God's sake, don't go down there or they will murder you!" [...] Wyatt said Behan told him and Morgan, [...] "I have disarmed them." [...] Behan testified afterward that he'd only said he'd <b>gone</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> the Cowboys [...] "for the purpose of disarming them," [...] not that he'd actually disarmed them.

500|$|Lieutenant Ludlow, who {{had been}} {{slightly}} wounded and had <b>gone</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> Chesapeakes cockpit for treatment, now returned to the upper decks, rallying some of the American crew as he did so. Lieutenant Budd joined him with a band of men he had led up the fore-hatch. Ludlow led them in a counter-attack which pushed the British {{back as far as}} the binnacle. However, a wave of British reinforcements arrived, Ludlow received a mortal wound from a cutlass, and the Americans were again thrown back. James Bulger, one of Shannons Irishmen, charged into the Americans wielding a boarding pike and shouting Gaelic curses - [...] "And then did I not spit them, beJaysus!" [...] Lacking officers to lead them (Lieutenant Budd had also been wounded by a cutlass) and lacking support from below, the Americans were driven back by the boarders. American resistance then fell apart, {{with the exception of a}} band of men on the forecastle and those in the tops. A number of the Americans driven from the upper decks jostled each other to get down the main hatchway to the comparative safety of the berth deck. Seeing this, Lt. Cox called to them, [...] "You damned cowardly sons of bitches! What are you jumping below for?" [...] When asked by a nearby midshipman if he should stop them by cutting a few down, Cox replied, [...] "No sir, it is of no use." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{precedence}} for Jews {{to return}} to their ancestral homeland, motivated by strong divine intervention, first appears in the Torah, and thus later adopted in the Christian Old Testament.

Later, as commanded by God, Moses went before Pharaoh, demanded, [...] "Let my people go!" [...] and foretold severe consequences, if this was not done. Torah describes the story of the plagues and the Exodus from Egypt, which is estimated at about 1400 BCE, {{and the beginning of the}} journey of the Jewish People toward the Land of Israel. These are celebrated annually during Passover, and the Passover meal traditionally ends with the words [...] "Next Year in Jerusalem." ...|$|E

2500|$|During the 1850s and 1860s some ore {{was still}} being won from the old levels {{in the top of}} the mountain, but the main ore-producing stopes were above and below the High and Low Levels. By the end of the 1850s the Low Level had been driven [...] north of the Engine Shaft. Below it, the 36Fathom Level was being {{extended}} in both directions. Although ore was at first very patchy in that level, stopes had been opened above it in both headings by 1858, and also a sump had <b>gone</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> 48fathoms, where a new level was being driven. A major rock fall occurred in 1862 (or 1865), known as [...] "The Big Crush." [...] Miners had cut away two parallel strings of lead ore above the High Horse Level, leaving an unsupported pendant of rock between them. This rock, [...] in length and depth, and [...] thick, fell, crushing its way down the stope to the level below, and removing the floor of Gilgower's Level above. Fortunately this happened one Sunday, when no one was in the mine. In 1870 the new Lucy Tongue Level was connected to the south end of the 48Fathom Level, by sinking a sump from above and working a rise from below. Already the new level had discovered some rich ore at the south end of the vein, and in the following years it was steadily driven north.|$|E
