5000|$|Sacred English Dry Vermouth, 21.8%. An <b>extra-dry</b> vermouth, {{made with}} English white wine from Gloucestershire and 16 {{botanicals}} including thyme, {{intended for the}} Dry Martini cocktail, but also usable in other mixed drinks.|$|E
5000|$|... (Colourless) Extra Dry Noilly Prat is a {{less complex}} wine {{formulated}} for the American <b>extra-dry</b> martini cocktail. Extra Dry is only shipped to North America, where it was available from 1979 until 2009. It returned late in 2012. It has supplanted the French Dry, which is now unavailable {{in much of the}} United States.|$|E
5000|$|Historically, {{there have}} been two main types of vermouth: sweet and dry. Responding to demand and competition, vermouth {{manufacturers}} have created additional styles, including <b>extra-dry</b> white, sweet white (bianco), red, amber (ambre or rosso), and rosé. [...] Vermouth is produced by starting with a base of a neutral grape wine or unfermented wine must. Each manufacturer adds additional alcohol and a proprietary mixture of dry ingredients, consisting of aromatic herbs, roots, and barks, to the base wine, base wine plus spirit or spirit only - which may be redistilled before adding to the wine or unfermented wine must. After the wine is aromatized and fortified, the vermouth is sweetened with either cane sugar or caramelized sugar, depending on the style. Italian and French companies produce most of the vermouth consumed throughout the world, although the United States and the United Kingdom are also producers.|$|E
5000|$|Noilly Prat {{is often}} used in cocktails, {{the most common and}} {{well-known}} of which is probably the Martini, consisting of one part Noilly Prat to one or more parts gin or vodka, with a dash of orange bitters, twist of lemon, or olive garnish. Over the years, the American preference for [...] "extra dry" [...] martinis led to the switch from gin to vodka, and to drastically reducing the flavour and quantity of the vermouth employed. However, in 2009, the <b>extra-dry</b> Noilly recipe exported to the USA was replaced by the original dry formula used worldwide. The change in recipe was accompanied by a change in the bottle's design. Some recipes substituted a vermouth from Dolin instead of Noilly Prat for making martinis, which is said to be [...] "every bit as good as, although not by any means identical to, the old Noilly".|$|E
30|$|For the Prosecco CGDO, the {{probability}} that consumers buy the product positively depends on several indicators, for instance, the fact that consumers belong to “new families” and are aged between 35 – 45 and that {{the purchase of the}} product is made at a hypermarket. For this type of Prosecco, brands matter and {{the probability}} that the product is <b>extra-dry</b> and branded Carpené Malvolti and La Gioiosa positively affects the purchase. The probability that the consumers buy Prosecco CGDO negatively depends on the increase of the product price.|$|E
40|$|The van de Graaff {{generator}} in its tank. For voltage-holding, {{the tank}} {{was filled with}} pressurized <b>extra-dry</b> nitrogen. 2 beams emanated from 2 separate electron-guns. The left beam, for injection into the CESAR ring, was pulsed at 50 Hz, with currents of up to 1 A for 400 ns. The right beam {{was sent to a}} spectrometer line. Its pulselength was also 400 ns, but the pulse current was 12 microA, at a rate variable from 50 kHz to 1 MHz. This allowed stabilization of the top-terminal voltage to an unprecedented stability of +- 100 V, i. e. 6 E- 5. Although built for a nominal voltage of 2 MV, the operational voltage was limited to 1. 75 MV in order to minimize voltage break-down events. CESAR was terminated at the end of 1967 and dismantled in 1968. R. Nettleton (left) and H. Burridge (right) are preparing the van de Graaff for shipment to the University of Swansea...|$|E
30|$|Who {{likes it}} sparkling? A wealthy, {{relatively}} young Northern Italian, {{who lives in}} a small household. He/she buys Prosecco at a hypermarket and reacts to price changes at different rates: a 1 % increase in the Prosecco CDO price will decrease the probability that he/she buys the product by 0.36 %. In addition, a 1 % increase in the Prosecco CGDO price will decrease the probability that he/she buys the product by 0.26 %. He/she can choose among 95 brands, but the probability that he/she buys Prosecco CGDO increases if the brand is Carpené Malvolti or La Gioiosa. In addition he/she enjoys the <b>extra-dry</b> taste of the CGDO type. He/she is less interested in the brand nor in the taste when purchasing Prosecco CDO. On the contrary, those who do not like sparkling wine belong to maturing families and/or older couples, are aged between 45 – 54, belong to a segment of low income earners and live in a household composed of three members or more. The preference structure of Prosecco consumers is captured by the definition of the profile. A profiled consumer, characterized by selected socio-economic attributes prefers the product and selected characteristics of the product (selected brand, extra dry). The “black box of preferences” is (partially, within the limitation of the dataset), opened to show who has preference for what.|$|E
30|$|The {{purpose of}} the study is to {{understand}} the profile (if any) of the typical Prosecco wine consumer, for both Controlled Denomination of Origin (CDO) and Controlled and Guaranteed Denomination of Origin (CGDO) types, with a twofold objective. First, the study aims at contributing to the economics literature dealing with opening the “black box of preferences” and understanding consumers’ behavior. Second, more practically, the study aims to advise producers on the design of more targeted industrial strategies and policies. Using Homescan data collected from large-scale retail trade transactions in the period 2009 - 2011, we adopt a probit model and test a set of simple relationships between the probability that Prosecco (in both Geographical Indications) is purchased and selected consumers’ socio-economic characteristics and product attributes. The results allow us to draft a profile of the typical consumer of Prosecco. The Prosecco CDO consumer lives in the North of Italy, is wealthy, relatively young, lives in a small (2 - 3 people) household and reacts to price changes. In addition to the latter feature, the typical Prosecco CGDO consumer has a preference for selected brands and <b>extra-dry</b> wine taste. Marginal effects are computed and predict that a 1 % increase in Prosecco CDO price will decrease the probability that a consumer purchases the product by 0.36 %. In addition, a 1 % increase in Prosecco CGDO price will decrease the probability that a consumer purchases the product by 0.26 %. The different sensitivity to price changes is corroborated by the fact that Prosecco CGDO consumers express a preference for the product characteristics (brand and taste) and might be more “loyal to the product” than Prosecco CDO purchasers. Further research will broaden the scale of analysis and adopt multinomial probit models in order to simultaneously assess the profile of different consumers for other types of sparkling wines, including Champagne and Franciacorta.|$|E
40|$|Background: Distribution of Tuberculosis (TB) has {{a special}} {{template}} affected by geographic and social factors. Nowadays Geographical Information System (GIS) software {{is one of the}} most important and useful epidemiologic devise for identifying geographic areas and high risk population for infection by TB. Aim of this study was assessment of Tuberculosis distribution by GIS in Khuzestan province, Iran. Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, documents of 6363 TB patients identified in Khuzestan province at the beginning of 2005 until the end of the September of 2012 were assessed and sampling method was census. The data was gathered by TB-Register Center. TB incidence was evaluated by GIS maps according to climatic and vegetation with 1 : 25, 000 scale. The data was analyzed in SPSS software and means plot and Independent’s t-test, ANOVA with a significance level of less than 5 % and Eta Correlation. Results: Spread of Tuberculosis in climatic and vegetation were plotted in GIS maps, cumulative incidence rate was calculated separately for each area. There was a statistical significant relationship between cumulative incidence rate of disease and climatic (P= 0. 017) and the Eta correlation coefficient was 0. 379 (P= 0. 011). There was a statistical significant relationship between cumulative incidence rate of TB and vegetation (P= 0. 004) and the Eta correlation coefficient was 0. 388 (P= 0. 188). Mean age and median age of patients were 39. 3 ± 18 and 35 ± 6. 5 years respectively. For women, mean age was 2. 1 years older than men and this difference was statistically significant. (P= 0. 0001). Conclusion: The risk of TB infection is closely associated with the climatic and vegetation. So the risk of TB in <b>extra-dry</b> climate and vegetation of highland meadows is more than other areas. Special care and services to high-risk areas is recommended...|$|E
