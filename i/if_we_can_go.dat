40|$|Abstract: Most of Hume’s {{philosophy}} {{hinges on}} the project of founding a new “science of human nature”, mirrored in the successful “experimental method of reasoning ” introduced in natural philosophy by Galileo, Newton and their contemporaries. In this essay I make some remarks on this project, {{with a view to}} elucidating its nature and exploring its potential fertility {{in the study of the}} human mind. I begin by showing that Hume carefully demarcates the domain in which the new method is applicable, namely, the domain of unobserved matters of fact. I argue that, given his conclusions about the narrow limits of the traditional, a priori philosophical method, naturalism is Hume’s favoured instrument for advancing research in this domain. Then, I draw attention to the epistemic priority that Hume ascribes to the phenomenological level, both in the natural sciences and in his science of man. I argue that he had good reasons not only for making this choice, but also for holding that the phenomena forming the basis of a naturalistic theory of mind should be specifically mental. This is in sharp contrast with the typical forms of epistemological naturalism prevalent in our days, which seek to establish the science of mind either on a behaviouristic basis, or on the theoretical study of neurological processes. In the final section of the article, I consider briefly one of the most difficult questions raised by the adoption of a naturalistic approach in epistemology: whether naturalism leaves room to epistemic norms. I defend the view that the Humean version of naturalism is compatible with a moderate form of normativity in epistemology. “And <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> no farther than this mental geography, or delineation of the distinct parts and powers of the mind, it is at least a satisfaction to go so far; and the more obvious this science may appear (and it is by no means obvious) the more contemptible still must the ignorance of it be esteemed, in all pretenders to learning and philosophy. ” (Hume, EHU 1. 13; SBN 13) ...|$|E

40|$|The OED {{has always}} been a {{historical}} dictionary; but it also includes words without a history: those words for which only one illustrative quotation has been found. Are such words in essence synchronic, without a diachronic dimension, and if so is there something unique about them? Or are they simply accidents of time and usage, all "nonce" formations, suitable to only one particular occasion, and without great significance? Recent editing on OED-Online has been able to find more quotations for entries that previously had only one quotation, giving a large number of words a history they did not have before. This is because of the recent increase in the availability of databases such as EEBO, ECCO and Googlebooks that enable editors to supplement their use of the OED's own archives with reference to a huge array of resources. But there are also many words on OED-Online that are still singletons, apparently unique creations of a particular moment of utterance. Now that we can search over so much of published writing in English, we have a vantage point on 'rare' words that the original compilers of the NED could not have imagined. Is this a difference in kind, or only in degree? We cannot of course definitively say that a word was used in only one text. But it often feels as if this is probable. This paper examines the status of a range of edited entries on OED-Online that are represented by a single quotation. Between the start of the letter R, and RE-, there are 96 such words, from RAMICULOSE a. to RE v.

Two days in a row without flying is enough for me. We’re getting snow up here now, more slush than anything. If it ever freezes we won’t fly this week. It’s sort of hard to land a plane on ice, I hear. Darling, I’ll be seeing you {{tomorrow}} night. It seems too good to be true. Gosh I’ve missed you these past two days, even more than usual. I think of you all the time, how sweet and lovely you are, how happy we’ll be after this thing is over, when we can be together, always. Gosh if only this war could end tomorrow, now, immediately. Well, the harder the struggle, the greater the victory. But I’m not fighting very hard. I feel so helpless and unimportant in this war. That’s one reason why I’ve got to go over, and do what little I can. I’m getting damned sick of sitting around, training 2 ̆ 6 training.

Well maybe I won’t have to wait too much longer, and I can go over and win the war, for us. I called Mom last night. She sounded quite happy. I think she’s beginning to see it our way. I know she will, darling. She’s not really selfish, she just thinks I’m too young, but that will be fixed quick, don’t worry. If God is willing, I’m going to marry you in March (of course, if you’re willing, too). Steve and I were talking about Gini, and marraige [sic]. He doesn’t want to marry her, not yet anyhow.

40|$|Executive Summary “I see {{the linkage}} {{of the water}} crisis {{and the future of}} global poverty, yet I don’t see the general {{awareness}} of this issue. Finally, after 25 years of tragically reduced investment in agricultural development, we hear the talk of food security; we see significant increases in the investment that is necessary. Yet I don’t hear the talk of securing water for food,” Jeff Raikes, {{chief executive officer of the}} Bill 2 ̆ 6 Melinda Gates Foundation, said in his keynote address at the 2010 Water for Food Conference. Hosted by the University of Nebraska with the support of the Robert B. Daugherty Charitable Foundation, the Bill 2 ̆ 6 Melinda Gates Foundation and Monsanto Company, the conference brought together more than 300 scientists and decision makers from universities, the private sector, governments and nongovernmental organizations around the world to discuss the challenge of growing more food using less water. Raikes concluded in his keynote address: “If we don’t change, if we don’t innovate across the spectrum of all the levers that we can pull, if we don’t take an integrated, interdisciplinary approach to this challenge, we are not going to be able to feed the world. ” The need to use all available tools – technological, political, societal and institutional – was echoed throughout the conference and reflected in the diversity of topics, perspectives and expertise represented. Innovating Across the Spectrum The Gates Foundation is concerned about water-scarce areas, Raikes said, because that is where people are hungriest and global poverty is greatest. Business as usual will not suffice in overcoming water shortages, and although Raikes observed limitations in applying past solutions to the future, he also expressed optimism that we can achieve food security for all people by combining the best practices of today – such as seed technology, market access and soil management – with advances to come, particularly in helping small farmers by developing affordable water storage, pumps and micro-irrigation technologies. Policies, including incentives that provide adequate water resources for farmers, also will be key. Pedro Sanchez of Columbia University’s Earth Institute demonstrated that tripling Africa’s rainfed cereal crop production from 1 ton to 3 tons per hectare is not only possible, but achievable. It can be accomplished without increasing water use by reducing losses from evapotranspiration at higher plant densities of 3 tons per acre. “This is what I would like to call the Green Revolution bonus,” Sanchez said. “As you go from 1 to 3 tons per hectare, you can get a lot more water. ” Successes in Malawi and the Earth Institute’s Millennium Villages project have shown that distributing fertilizer and seed increases production dramatically. These successes have led to the Global Food Security Trust Fund, a global fund for smallholder agriculture. “I’d like to redefine the goal of the Green Revolution as going from 1 to 3 tons per hectare,” Sanchez said. Sanchez also described efforts to create a digital soil map of the world to better manage local needs by, for example, pinpointing areas requiring additional nutrients or erosion control and identifying regions with a higher probability of drought stress. David Molden of the International Water Management Institute (IWMI) urged prioritizing water access for the poor, ecosystem enhancement and improved water governance. He reinforced Sanchez’s point that the greatest opportunity lies in low-yield agriculture; increasing yields from 1 ton to 2 tons per cubic meter of water increases water productivity 74 percent. “This is the area for the biggest potential. … This is also the area where there’s high poverty. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> and narrow in on that focus, we get two big wins all at the same time. ” Rather than focusing on the distinction between rainfed and irrigated agriculture, Molden encouraged looking at appropriate available solutions in a given location as well as considering large-scale innovative solutions. He offered six problem sets for the future: 1) upgrade rainfed systems with better water and soil management; 2) revitalize under-performing irrigation systems; 3) learn to manage groundwater sustainably; 4) reuse urban wastewater safely; 5) transform water governance and management; and 6) improve information systems. Irrigation must play a large role in a future Green Revolution for Africa, said Ken Cassman of the University of Nebraska–Lincoln (UNL). The 1960 s Green Revolutions in Asia and Nebraska relied primarily on irrigation, which allowed both areas to successfully and dramatically increase productivity, Cassman said. “If [Sub-Saharan African] agriculture is much more like the harsher rainfed environments of the western Corn Belt, can rainfed agriculture do it alone?” he asked. Sub-Saharan Africa has sufficient water resources to support irrigation, which in turn provides stable yields and generates income to support investment in associated industries and infrastructure. Although irrigation maximizes yields, greatest net income occurs below maximum yields after factoring in additional water costs, said Richard Cuenca of the National Science Foundation (NSF). What incentives, he asked, can be used to encourage growers to consider other objectives besides reaching maximum production? Cuenca also cautioned that climate change will undoubtedly affect future food production, although models disagree by how much. An International Food Policy Research Institute study predicted that by 2050, food production of major rainfed and irrigated cereal crops will decline 13 to 42 percent, eliminating progress made in lowering child malnutrition rates...|$|E

Using a detailed Process Map will aid the person filling in the worksheet to correctly list {{the steps of the}} process being reviewed. The FAILURE MODE is then simply how that step <b>can</b> <b>go</b> wrong. Example, Process Step 1. Pick Up right handed part. Can they pick up the wrong part? (some manufacturing centers have left and right handed parts etc.) FAILURE MODE put left hand part in, EFFECT could be wrecked CNC machine and scrapped part, or hole drilled in wrong location. The cause, keeping inventory of similar parts at the job. Why is it important to do a PFMEA with regard to the process? When a process is examined or <b>if</b> <b>we</b> ask what <b>can</b> <b>go</b> wrong with the process unknown issues are uncovered, solving problems before they occur and tackling root cause issues or at least 2 Y's deep on a 5 Y. Here the manufacturing engineer could possibly poke yoke the tooling to prevent a left handed part in the fixture when running the right handed parts or program a touch off probe in the CNC programming - all before ever making the mistake the first time. If a PFMEA is set up where the FAILURE MODE relates to the feature on the print, example FAILURE MODE drilled hole too big - no further understanding of what caused the problem is gained. Numerous PFMEA's have been examined and show that little to no value is gained when reviewing features off of a print as FAILURE MODES - little understanding of the cause is gained. New PFMEA practitioners often try to relate the PFMEA FAILURE MODE to the FEATURE, numerous authors list this as trying to inspect in quality rather than listing the process step determining how it <b>can</b> <b>go</b> wrong and building in quality through root cause evaluation.|$|R
