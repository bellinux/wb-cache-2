5000|$|The {{ejection}} unit {{is designed}} to take the filled cylinder from the carousel. The ejection unit typically receives a signal from the corresponding <b>filling</b> <b>head</b> (<b>filling</b> <b>head</b> is up)indicating that the cylinder is filled and may {{be taken off the}} carousel. If the filling is not completed, [...] "filling head down" [...] tells the evacuation unit not to activate and the cylinder completes one more cycle on the carousel while being filled. On modern carousels these commands are electronic, but can also be mechanical by means of a dowel which operates a switch.|$|E
50|$|Cans {{are filled}} before {{the top is}} crimped on. The filling and sealing {{operations}} need to be extremely fast and precise. The <b>filling</b> <b>head</b> centers the can using gas pressure, purges the air, and lets the beverage flow {{down the sides of}} the can. The lid is placed on the can, and then crimped in two operations. A seaming head engages the lid from above while a seaming roller to the side curls the edge of the lid {{around the edge of the}} can body. The head and roller spin the can in a complete circle to seal all the way around. Then a pressure roller with a different profile drives the two edges together under pressure to make a gas-tight seal. Filled cans usually have pressurized gas inside, which makes them stiff enough for easy handling.|$|E
40|$|In two {{different}} experimental environments the isolated turtle ventricle {{was found to}} fill and eject blood {{in the absence of}} a positive filling pressure. It is concluded that the ventricle can "suck" fluid using energy liberated from its wall during diastole. THE question of ventricular "suction,"that is "Does energy derived from theventricle contribute to its filling in diastole? " has been debated from the time Erasistratus to the present and has recently been critically reviewed by Brecher. 1 A recent film and abstract by Bloom 2 offer support of the "suction " concept. The ultimate proof of suction as a physio-logic aid to filling should rest on a demonstra-tion that, {{in the absence of a}} <b>filling</b> <b>head,</b> the ventricle develops a drop in intraventricular pressure which is sufficient to and actually does produce inflow. Because of the very low resistance of the A-V orifice the pressure dif-ference necessary for inflow is very small and has not been measurable directly with existing apparatus except when inflow is impeded artificially. The pressure difference, then, must be inferred from the fact of flow. A positive <b>filling</b> <b>head</b> can be eliminated by the total immersion of the ventricle in fluid at any depth. In this way the <b>filling</b> <b>head</b> at any point within the heart chambers is exactly counter-balanced by the external pressure at that depth. In this way any inflow indicates that the heart wall has been instrumental in producing a lowering of intracardiac pressure and the consequent inflow of fluid. Two series of experiments on the excised ventricle of the turtle are here presented to throw light on this question...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{investigate}} the developmental patterns in production of prenominal modification structure in normal Cantonese-speakers. Thirty-four subjects from two groups of children aged from 3; 0 to 6; 0 years and one adult group produced language samples elicited by story retelling task. Language samples were analyzed for differences in use of prenominal modification structure, lexically <b>filled</b> <b>head</b> form, verbal modifier and the embedding of the modified noun phrase in a larger matrix sentence. Results indicate that there are significant developmental differences in the use of prenominal modification, lexically <b>filled</b> <b>head</b> and matrix embedding of complex noun phrase. There is a positive correlation in the use of lexical head and matrix sentence embedding. The prior acquisition of lexically headless form and the relation between the complexity of modifier and the status of the head are discussed. ...|$|R

40|$|The company Akzo Nobel {{is world}} leader in {{coatings}} and has a high capacity. Unfortunately {{in the last couple}} of years the market for paint has been declining in Europe. The business unit Akzo Nobel Decorative Coatings Europe has experienced this declining market, which has led to overcapacity in some factories. As the competition is fierce the business unit wants to reduce costs at all sites; ‘Sell more, spend less’. The management is clear; factories that improve and achieve well keep volume, if not they lose it. Losing a lot of volume can lead to closure, so not improving is not an option. The Advanced Tinting Plant of Akzo Nobel Decorative Coatings Groot-Ammers is a small factory for Akzo Nobel. To ensure the future of the plant it is necessary to improve. The management wants to do this in a continuous way together with the employees to keep on improving in the future. The management of the plant wants bottom line results at the key area of the plant. They want to improve the speed decisive factor of the plant, the <b>filling</b> <b>head</b> of the filling machine in the filling department, a small but important part of the plant. Of course the surroundings of the <b>filling</b> <b>head</b> and of the department must be considered as well. This has led to the objective of the research: Develop a method to continuously improve the efficiency of the filling department of the Advanced Tinting Plant and to gain insight in the factors that influence this efficiency, now and in the future. This will lead to tangible benefits on the Key Performance Indicators of Akzo Nobel and eventually to a lower cost price and better performance in comparison with its competitors. And the entral research question: How can a method be developed to continuously improve the efficiency of the filling department?...|$|E
40|$|A {{hydraulic}} {{model of the}} underground pump suction intake structure of the Calumet Pumping Station was built and tested. The pumping station {{is an element of}} the projected Chicago storm runoff collection and treatment system, to be completed within the next few years. The study was conduoted for DeLeuw, Cather and Co., Consulting Engineers and Planners, Chicago, Illinois, on behalf of the Metropolitan Sanitary District of Greater Chicago. The model was built at a scale of 1 : 14, mostly out of plexiglass to facilitate observation. The model included the downstream end of the Calumet Tunnel, a drop structure, two symmetrically placed ducts, a wet shaft and a suction header with three branch pipes as shown in Figs. 1 through 8. It was the objective of the {{hydraulic model}} study to identify and document (a) problems with flow separation, secondary currents and vortex formation by flow visualization, (b) air entrappment and air entrainment during filling and during pump operation, (c) piezometric heads and head losses throughout the structure, (d) accumulation and entrainment of fuel oil, resulting from accidental spills, throughout the structure (e) transport and deposition of grit throughout the structure. As a result of the initial observations made in the model, the structure was modified in two locations to improve flow characteristics and to reduce grit deposition. The observations made in the model with regard to flow patterns, air entrainment and fuel entrainment have been documented by still pictures (black and white) and color motion picture. Head losses are reported in tabular and graphical form. The performance of the structure (Design C in Fig. 10) with respect to air entrainment, fuel entrainment and head losses appears quite satisfactory. Grit deposition was largely reduced but not fully eliminated. The following specific findings and recommendations were made: At high stages, that is {{at the beginning of the}} pumping cycle, flow through the structure is at low velocity and with little flow separation occurring. At low stages, flow in the drop structure becomes highly turbulent resulting at first in entrainment of floating materials and at W. S. stages below - 320 in entrainment of air into the duct. In the wet shaft, there appears to be no tendency for vortex formation or air entrainment into the suction header. Only the complete blockage of the lower portion of the bar screen caused a vortex in the wet shaft. It was recommended that three air vents be installed on the suction header at the intersection of each of the three branch pipe axis with the suction header wall. These vents will prevent air accumulation in the branch header during <b>filling.</b> <b>Head</b> losses throughout the structure were found to be small. They are summarized on pages 47 and 48. Piezometric grade lines are shown in Figs. 46, 47, and 48. A major grit deposition problem existed in the divided duct due to the large reduction in flow velocities and bed shear stresses in that part of the structure. A reduction in cross-sectional area by raising the invert by several feet resulted in a significant reduction in grit deposition. Complete elimination of grit deposition appears possible with further reductions of duct width. Deleuw, Cather and Company, Chicago, Illinoi...|$|E
40|$|To reveal {{intermediates}} in lambda DNA packaging, infected {{cells were}} osmotically ruptured and the cell lysates were deposited on electron microscope grids by sedimentation through a sucrose/formalin cushion. A fixation procedure that crosslinks head-related structures to DNA {{allowed us to}} study successive stages {{in the process of}} <b>head</b> <b>filling.</b> Three types of head-related structures can be distinguished: (i) empty heads (petit lambda), less angular in outline than complete lambda heads; (ii) <b>heads</b> partially <b>filled</b> with DNA (partially <b>filled</b> <b>heads),</b> having a roundish outline; and (iii) particles tightly packed with DNA (full heads), having a hexagonal outline. DNA-head complexes were bound either at the terminal end of a DNA thread or at a point intermediate along the thread. The terminal complexes were more abundant. No head-related structures could be found in an induced lambda mutant lysogen blocked in the synthesis of petit lambda (amber in lambda gene E). One type of mutant blocked in DNA packaging (amber in gene A) produces empty heads and free tails, whereas another (amber in gene D) produces partially <b>filled</b> <b>heads</b> in addition. Our data suggest that a DNA-petit lambda complex may be an early intermediate in packaging and that the lambda DNA substrate can be a cohesive-ended concatemer or a concatemer with double-stranded cohesive site sequences...|$|R

40|$|With the {{exception}} of mutants in gene 49, all mutants in phage T 4 defective {{in the process of}} <b>head</b> <b>filling</b> accumulate a normal replicative DNA intermediate of 200 S. Mutants in gene 49 produce a very fast-sedimenting (VFS) DNA with s values of greater than 1, 000 S. The intracellular development of the VFS-DNA generated in gene 49 -defective phage-infected cells was followed by sedimentation analysis of crude lysates on neutral sucrose gradients. It was observed that the production of a 200 S replicative intermediate is one step in the development of VFS-DNA. After restoring permissive conditions the development of the VFS-DNA can be reversed, but the 200 S form is not regenerated under these conditions. The process of <b>head</b> <b>filling</b> can take place from the VFS-DNA under permissive conditions. From the absence of other components in the VFS-DNA complexes, its high resistance to shearing, its resistance against the attack of the single-strand-specific nuclease S 1, and from its appearance in the electron microscope, a complex structure of tightly packed DNA is inferred. The demonstration by the electron microscope of branched DNA structures sometimes closely related to partially <b>filled</b> <b>heads</b> is taken in support of the idea that the process of <b>head</b> <b>filling</b> in gene 49 -defective phage-infected cells is blocked by some steric hindrance in the DNA. In light of these results, the role of gene 49 is discussed as a control function for the clearance of these structures. A fixation procedure for cross-linking of gene 49 -defective heads to the VFS-DNA allowed us to study progressive stages in the process of <b>head</b> <b>filling.</b> Electron microscopic evidence is presented which suggests that during the initial events the DNA accumulates in the vertexes of the head...|$|R
