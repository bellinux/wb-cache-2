Few devices {{have been developed}} that fully <b>exploit</b> combining <b>multiple</b> <b>functions</b> in socalled micro total analysis systems (1, 2). Instead of advanced component integration on chip, here we demonstrate that the measurement of alkali metals can be performed in a drop of whole blood using an established type of capillary electrophoresis microchip (3 - 7) by applying the principles of moving boundary electrophoresis. The emphasis {{will be on the}} determination of lithium, which is used in the treatment of manic-depressive mood disorders. The low therapeutic index of lithium in blood is critical throughout the treatment and is therefore an ideal candidate for the demonstration of a microchip for self-testing...|$|R
40|$|Though {{designing}} a data warehouse requires techniques {{completely different from}} those adopted for operational systems, no significant effort has been made so far to develop a complete and consistent design methodology for data warehouses. In this paper we outline a general methodological framework for DW design discussing {{the relationships between the}} different steps and the difficulties in carrying them out. Within this framework, conceptual design is based on the Dimensional Fact Model, while logical design <b>exploits</b> <b>multiple</b> cost <b>functions</b> at increasing levels of detail in order to improve both the efficiency and efficacy of the algorithms. A workload is characterized in terms of data volumes and expected queries, to be used as the input of the logical and physical design phases whose output is the final scheme for the data warehouse. In particular, drill-across queries are explicitly taken into account throughout the design steps. Keywords Data warehouse, design methodology, conce [...] ...|$|R
40|$|We {{propose a}} {{flexible}} approach for the visualization of large, high-dimensional datasets. The raw, highdimensional data is mapped into an abstract 3 D distance space using the FastMap algorithm, which helps, {{together with other}} linear preprocessing steps, to make changes to the resulting 3 D representation within a few seconds. Thus exploration of such datasets is a less tedious task compared to other techniques. We use volumes with four components to enable the user to brush an attribute selection onto the volume for inspection. We <b>exploit</b> <b>multiple</b> transfer <b>functions</b> for displaying these attributes and also to filter one attribute with values of another. An advantage of this volume sampling approach is that the rendering performance is independent of the dataset size. The drawback of limited resolution can be overcome by providing a linked detail view for a freely selectable portion of space. Examples of the inspection and filtering possibilities using a silvicultural dataset illustrate the strengths of our approach...|$|R
40|$|HIV- 1 <b>exploits</b> <b>multiple</b> host {{proteins}} during infection. We {{performed a}} large-scale small interfering RNA screen to identify host factors required by HIV- 1 and identified more than 250 HIV-dependency factors (HDFs). These proteins {{participate in a}} broad array of cellular functions and implicate new pathways in the viral life cycle. Further analysis revealed previously unknown roles for retrograde Golgi transport proteins (Rab 6 and Vps 53) in viral entry, a karyopherin (TNPO 3) in viral integration, and the Mediator complex (Med 28) in viral transcription. Transcriptional analysis revealed that HDF genes were enriched for high expression in immune cells, suggesting that viruses evolve in host cells that optimally perform the functions required for their life cycle. This effort illustrates the power with which RNA interference and forward genetics can be used to expose the dependencies of human pathogens such as HIV, and in so doing identify potential targets for therapy. HIV- 1 encodes only 15 proteins (1) and thus must <b>exploit</b> <b>multiple</b> host cell <b>functions</b> for successful infection (2). Viral entry depends on binding to the recepto...|$|R

40|$|SOBER-like stream ciphers and SSC-like stream ciphers are word-oriented stream ciphers {{that use}} a linear {{feedback}} shift register (LFSR) and a non-linear lter.

The rst example is an attack against the LFSR component of SSC-II. This attack exploitsapower of the bit-wise connection polynomial. The second example is {{an attack on a}} dummy SOBERlike cipher which <b>exploits</b> <b>multiples</b> of the word-oriented connection polynomial.
