5|$|Due to {{the fact}} that the show was {{operating}} on a strict budget, shots of the Chinese freighter were almost entirely created by digital technology or other special effects. For the opening scene of the ship at sea, a matte painting of a boat based on a toy model was superimposed onto a <b>film</b> <b>strip</b> of an empty ocean. Several scenes featuring the boat in port were created by filming an empty harbor and then superimposing a ship via digital technology. Special effects makeup supervisor John Vulich created a latex appliance that enabled the veterinarian to have his throat bitten out.|$|E
5|$|A film studio set {{was created}} by photographing several reel spools with strips of film {{dangling}} {{against a background of}} blinking lights. The casting office {{was created by}} silhouetting strips of cardboard against a white background. To portray the mental anguish of the protagonist, strips of paper were cut into the shape of twisted trees, which were silhouetted against a background of moving shadows and set in motion with an electric fan. To create a scene {{near the end of the}} film, when the protagonist starts becoming delirious, the camera moves through a maze of different sized cubes, with geometric designs inside them, all placed on a flat, shiny service. The heaven setting was also a miniature set created from paper cubes, tin cans, cigar boxes, toy trains, and a motorized Erector Set. No still photos were taken for the film, but illustrations showing prism and kaleidoscope effects have been made by enlarging frames of negative. The paper prints were considerably softer than the movie print in order to avoid graininess. The final film was edited to a one-reel length of 1,200 feet of <b>film</b> <b>strip,</b> featuring about 150 scenes. Florey said it featured the same number of angles as full-length feature films of the time. Although the film was carefully edited to be synchronized with Rhapsody in Blue, much of the original lyrical quality has been lost in shortened and modified versions of the film.|$|E
25|$|During a brief {{transitional}} period (c. 1950s–1990s), photographic technology, known as phototypesetting, utilized tiny high-resolution images of individual glyphs on a <b>film</b> <b>strip</b> (in {{the form of}} a film negative, with the letters as clear areas on an opaque black background). A high-intensity light source behind the <b>film</b> <b>strip</b> projected the image of each glyph through an optical system, which focused the desired letter onto the light-sensitive phototypesetting paper at a specific size and position. This photographic typesetting process permitted optical scaling, allowing designers to produce multiple sizes from a single font, although physical constraints on the reproduction system used still required design changes at different sizes; for example, ink traps and spikes to allow for spread of ink encountered in the printing stage. Manually operated photocomposition systems using fonts on filmstrips allowed fine kerning between letters without the physical effort of manual typesetting, and spawned an enlarged type design industry in the 1960s and 1970s.|$|E

40|$|To {{reduce the}} deep {{percolation}} during greenhouse vegetable cultivation, {{the technique of}} subsurface <b>film</b> <b>strips</b> placement was tested. Four treatments with two kinds of cross-sections (flat and U-shaped) and two different spacings (10 cm and 40 cm) of subsurface <b>film</b> <b>strips</b> were arranged in a greenhouse before planting celery. At the same time, a non-film treatment was arranged for comparison. Soil water content was measured and irrigation time was adjusted according to the soil water content. Evapotranspiration of celery during growth was calculated by the method of energy balance and the deep percolation was calculated by the equation of water balance. Deep percolation was reduced in all experimental treatments. Greater reduction in deep percolation was observed when using U-shaped cross-section strips compared with that using the flat cross-section strips. In addition, greater reduction in deep percolation was observed when the spacing between the <b>film</b> <b>strips</b> was smaller. The results of this test showed that the technique of subsurface <b>film</b> <b>strips</b> placement can reduce deep percolation and conserve irrigation water for greenhouse vegetables cultivation. However, the optimal layout variables {{for the use of}} the technique of subsurface <b>film</b> <b>strips</b> placement need further experimental and numerical analysis. </p...|$|R

25|$|Mickey first {{appeared}} animated in color in Parade of the Award Nominees in 1932, however, the <b>film</b> <b>strip</b> {{was created for}} the 5th Academy Awards ceremony and was not released to the public. Mickey's official first color film came in 1935 with The Band Concert. The Technicolor film process {{was used in the}} film production. Here Mickey conducted the William Tell Overture, but the band is swept up by a tornado. It is said that conductor Arturo Toscanini so loved this short that, upon first seeing it, he asked the projectionist to run it again. In 1994, The Band Concert was voted the third-greatest cartoon of all time in a poll of animation professionals. By colorizing and partially redesigning Mickey, Walt would put Mickey back on top once again, and Mickey would reach popularity he never reached before as audiences now gave him more appeal. Also in 1935, Walt would receive a special award from the League of Nations for creating Mickey.|$|E
25|$|At {{one point}} in the film, Dante {{attempted}} to involve his audience in the story by making it seem as if the gremlins had taken control of the theatre where Gremlins 2 was showing. The <b>film</b> <b>strip</b> appears to be broken by the gremlins, who then engage in shadow puppetry over a white screen before replacing the reel with the vintage nudie film Volleyball Holiday. Hulk Hogan then makes a cameo appearance as an audience member and intimidates the gremlins into running the rest of Gremlins 2. This joke was inspired by a similar stunt in William Castle's film The Tingler (1959). The studio feared that people might leave the theatre if they thought the film had broken; Dante therefore secured the inclusion of the sequence by assembling some people for a preview of the film. When the scene was shown, the real-life audience found it enjoyable and stayed in the theatre. Dante later described this scene {{as one of the most}} widely enjoyed jokes in Gremlins 2. When the film made its debut on home video, the filmmakers replaced the scene, to make it seem as if the viewer's VCR had been broken by the gremlins. In this version, the gremlins do their shadow puppetry over white noise before changing the VCR's channels. Their antics stop at a broadcast of Chisum, where John Wayne forces the gremlins into continuing the film, although voice impersonation was needed since Wayne had been dead since 1979; actor Chad Everett was recommended by Wayne's son Patrick Wayne. Notably, a clip from Falling Hare, a film released in 1943 featuring Bugs Bunny and a gremlin, appears in this version. These sequences occur in lieu of the Hulk Hogan sequence which also featured Paul Bartel; home video audiences would not see these sequences until the DVD release (which includes the reworked VHS scene as a bonus feature).|$|E

The film generated mostly critical reviews, with Manohla Dargis of the Los Angeles Times describing it as [...] "smug and reductive". Her next roles were in smaller independent films: Casa de los Babys (2003), a story about six American women impatiently waiting out their lengthy residency requirements in an unidentified South American country before picking up their adoptive babies, and Criminal (2004), a remake of the Argentinian film Nine Queens, with John C.

500|$|The film's abrupt cuts, {{artificial}} scenery, extreme close-ups, {{and twisted}} angles all metaphorically amplify {{the dark and}} somber narrative. Shots of film producers and critics in A Hollywood Extra are shot from low angles with dark backdrops, giving the characters a powerful and foreboding ambiance. Gregg Toland would make use of similar camera techniques in his later work on Citizen Kane. Due to the lighting, close-ups of the actors' faces are often shadowed, shrouding some of their features and depriving the characters of wholeness. The all-black backdrops in these close-ups also derive the film of a real-world presence. During {{a scene in which}} the protagonist await phone calls to learn about casting decisions, the image of a telephone is superimposed directly onto the actor's forehead, symbolizing his growing obsession with finding work.

500|$|The Silver Age {{began with}} the {{publication}} of DC Comics' Showcase #4 (Oct. 1956), which introduced the modern version of the Flash. At the time, only three superheroesSuperman, Batman, and Wonder Womanwere still published under their own titles. According to DC comics writer Will Jacobs, Superman was available in [...] "great quantity, but little quality." [...] Batman was doing better, but his comics were [...] "lackluster" [...] in comparison to his earlier [...] "atmospheric adventures" [...] of the 1940s, and Wonder Woman, having lost her original writer and artist, was no longer [...] "idiosyncratic" [...] or [...] "interesting." [...] Jacobs describes the arrival of Showcase #4 on the newsstands as [...] "begging to be bought," [...] the cover featured an undulating <b>film</b> <b>strip</b> depicting the Flash running so fast that he had escaped from the frame. Editor Julius Schwartz, writer Gardner Fox, and artist Carmine Infantino were some of the people behind the Flash's revitalization. Robert Kanigher wrote the first stories of the revived Flash, and John Broome was the writer of many of the earliest stories.|$|E
500|$|The promotional {{music video}} for [...] "Ice Hockey Hair" [...] was {{directed}} by Daf Palfrey and appears on the DVD version of the band's 'greatest hits' album [...] The video begins with silent footage of five characters, who appear in a small white rectangle in {{the centre of the}} screen against a black background. The text [...] "I am like a <b>film</b> <b>strip</b> ... and like a child ... in a thousand lunar parks ... someone is always ... cranking the handle" [...] appears as the video cuts between shots of each person. [...] "Ice Hockey Hair" [...] begins playing approximately 17 seconds into the video. Each character is again seen in a white rectangle in the centre of the screen followed by a shot of a pair of hands holding a strip of photos of that particular person during which red text is displayed showing the character's name. A woman with short blonde hair and a red top, seen holding {{her head in her hands}} is introduced as [...] "The wife"; a bald man with blood on his head is [...] "The husband"; a woman in a white jacket with a blonde mullet hairstyle is [...] "The mistress"; a man with thick-rimmed glasses, a white jacket, and red polo neck sweater is [...] "The voyeur"; and a man in a red and black tracksuit top with a large scar running from his left eye to right cheek is [...] "The stalker". The five characters are all seen singing along to the track individually, again framed in a white rectangle in the centre of the screen. [...] "The wife" [...] is twice shown ripping a photograph of her and [...] "The husband", while [...] "The mistress" [...] is seen sitting on the lap of [...] "The husband" [...] in two shots. After 1 minute and 6 seconds the Super Furry Animals are shown playing along to the track on a rotating dancefloor surrounded by photo booths and several dancers in dark clothes. During an instrumental break in the song, at 1 minute 38 seconds, two masked men are shown playing table tennis on another rotating dancefloor with two large fluorescent purple circles in the background. The five characters are then seen walking around the band and stepping into the photo booths that surround them. The text [...] "Act 1: The kiss" [...] is shown, after which footage of the Super Furry Animals playing along to the track is intercut with shots of the characters. [...] "The husband" [...] and [...] "The mistress" [...] kiss while a strip of photos is seen being passed through a pair of hands and [...] "The voyeur" [...] is shown using a video camera. The characters move to different photo booths and the title [...] "Act 2: The stalking" [...] is displayed. Shots of [...] "The stalker" [...] and [...] "The wife" [...] are then intercut with shots of the band. The characters again change booths and the title [...] "Act 3: The murder" [...] is shown. After quick jump cuts between shots of the band, the masked men playing table tennis and the five characters, [...] "The voyeur" [...] is shown pointing his video camera at the motionless body of [...] "The mistress" [...] which is laid in a bathtub covered in film stock.

2500|$|Today, Muybridge {{is known}} for his {{pioneering}} work on animal locomotion in 1877 and 1878, which used multiple cameras to capture motion in stop-motion photographs, and his zoopraxiscope, a device for projecting motion pictures that pre-dated the flexible perforated <b>film</b> <b>strip</b> used in cinematography. In the 1880s, he entered a very productive period at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, producing over 100,000 images of animals and humans in motion, capturing what the human eye could not distinguish as separate movements.|$|E
2500|$|For Riga Minox to Minox B, {{the film}} {{advances}} {{each time the}} camera is closed, regardless of whether a picture is taken or not. Opening the camera causes the pressure plate to press the film into a concave or flat (depending on the model) surface to stiffen thin emulsions for better clarity. When the camera is closed, the pressure plate moves back from the film plane, thus allowing the <b>film</b> <b>strip</b> to move freely {{to advance to the}} next frame. From Minox BL onward, the camera is equipped with a [...] "freewheeling" [...] mechanism, such that the film advances one frame only when a picture is taken, otherwise, closing the camera does not advance a frame.|$|E
