The effect is discussed using ages at marriage in Feuerbach, a wine-growing village near Stuttgart, later an industrial town. From 1807 to 1832, when no legal restrictions were in force, marriage ages rose due to economic pressures. A downward trend occurs only after restrictions were lifted in the 1870 s. Closer inspection reveals social and gender specific differences. From 1840 to 1879, a period of restrictive laws as well as economic upheaval, women of different social groups married at widely differing ages, whereas men’s marriage ages converged. After 1880 women’s marriage ages came closer again, but differences in male marriage ages widened. Men in <b>higher</b> <b>social</b> <b>groups</b> married later, whereas wage-earning workers could marry earlier. Legal restrictions failed to reduce the birthrate.

40|$|All the {{terminology}} related to hair dressing in the Croatian language {{is derived from}} the galicism friseur, for two reasons: (1) the concept of hair dressing didn’t exist in widely spoken language, thus {{there was no need for}} related terminology; and (2) when the concept appeared, it was inherited from the <b>higher</b> <b>social</b> <b>groups,</b> so the lower groups took the already adopted, yet foreign, vocabulary for it. Since the phonetic structure of the adopted semantic system is unnatural to any Slavic language, here we derive the hair-dressing terminology from the Croatian word kòsa, the root of which (kos-) can be found in all Slavic languages and was derived by apophony from the common Indo-European root *kes-. We show that the formation space of this root is free and therefore it is the best choice among the 3 different possibilities (kòsa, vlȃs and šíšati). Consequently, we form a completely new semantic-formation system from it, even introducing new terms which haven’t evolved only due to the mentioned phonetic barriers, and the concepts of which have been expressed only descriptively. Moreover, we have derived an equivalent system from an analogous Old Slavonic root kosmъ. These systems do not only indicate the formation possibilities of substitutions for some loanwords in Croatian; they also reveal the new dimension of the concept-formation relation (1 - 2 above) which we prove to be particularly fruitful for the formation of native substitutes...|$|E

40|$|It is {{a long-standing}} {{belief that the}} size of the {{difference}} between the poor (lower social groups) and the rich (<b>higher</b> <b>social</b> <b>groups)</b> in health outcomes will vary according to the characteristics of the area. However typical approaches to analyses of this kind of question violate standard statistical assumption. The basic problem is how to estimate the size of a 'ward effect ' (the disadvantage of living in a 'poor ' ward over and above effects associated with individual or household circumstances). This is complicated by the hypothesized exist-ence of intra-ward correlated errors; the only way to avoid this bias is to explicitly model the different variance com-ponents using multi-level modelling techniques. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to illustrate this technique. Analysis using several of the health outcomes in the Health and Lifestyle Survey data, suggests that the ward effect is quite substantial, and remains after 'controlling for " age, gender and several other socio-demographic variables. This 'ward effect ' appears to be best represented by the proportions without access to a car and the preponderance of work-ing class members (RGSC IV and V) in the population. Whilst the verdict on the original hypothesis remains 'not proven', the hypothesis has been shown to be more complex than its simplistic statement suggests. The analyses have shown how to unpack these complexities and, more generally, have illustrated the power of the multi-level modelling technique.

40|$|The {{goal of this}} diploma thesis, Marriage Strategies of the Czech Aristocracy in the Pre-White Mountain Period, is to {{introduce}} strategies, which the members of aristocracy, especially the high nobility, exploited in the period before the battle of White Mountain. The choice of partner is understood in this context {{as a means of}} self-presentation of an individual and his or her family, and as symbol of the aristocracy's identity in the early modern period. This diploma thesis is based on a database of marriages of Czech aristocrats between 1500 and 1650, utilising available literature and published sources. The thesis analyses these known facts and observes how the above mentioned strategies differed in dependence on the social and property status of the family. Firstly, the requirements when choosing a partner related to social aspects: for example the social group of the bridesroom and bride; whether their marriage was within their social group, or if marriages between a man from knighthood and woman from nobility and vice versa were common; whether brothers and sisters married partners from the same social group or first-borns married partners from <b>higher</b> <b>social</b> <b>groups</b> than their younger siblings, or vice versa. Secondly, there are geographical aspects: for example the region from which men chose their brides; and whether they preferred women of Czech or foreign origin. Finally, the role of religion will be discussed, to determine whether it was a crucial factor when choosing a partner, and whether marriages of people of different beliefs were possible...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND—The annual {{incidence}} of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL) is increasing by 3 %- 4 % {{in different parts}} of the developed world. Excesses of NHL have been observed in populations exposed to immunosuppressants and to HIV, but these causes do not explain the increasing trends. It is suggested that delayed infection could explain NHL trends, through an impairment of the Th 1 /Th 2 lymphocyte patterns.  METHODS—In a population-based study on 1388  patients with NHL, 354  with Hodgkin's disease (HD) and 1718  healthy controls, the age of first occurrence of bacterial and viral diseases was investigated. Clinical records were perused in one centre to check the anamnestic data.  FINDINGS—The age of occurrence of bacterial and viral diseases was significantly higher among NHL patients than in the controls. The association between later age at first bacterial or viral disease was limited to small families (OR= 1. 95; 95 % confidence intervals 1. 26,  3. 00, for age 4 - 8 at first infection; OR= 1. 91; 1. 19,  3. 06, for age 9 +, compared with less than 4). The association was more obvious for bacterial diseases (possibly for the lower degree of misclassification). High grade lymphomas showed the strongest association. The later age of occurrence of bacterial or viral diseases in NHL patients is consistent with a higher incidence of lymphomas observed in <b>higher</b> <b>social</b> <b>groups.</b> No clear association was found between HD and age at first bacterial or viral diseases.  INTERPRETATION—It is proposed that delayed infection could explain the increasing NHL trends, through an impairment of the Th 1 /Th 2 lymphocyte patterns. The model of delayed infection has been proposed also to explain increasing prevalence rates of asthma. ...|$|E

Razlike u zdravlju, zaštiti zdravlja i zdravstvenom ponašanju koje se medu društvenim skupinama javljaju kao posljedica njihovog stratifikacijskog položaja imaju značenje zdravstvenih nejednakosti. U prvom dijelu rada, rezultati međunarodnih istraživanja pokazuju da je zdravlje, odnosno zdravstveno stanje mjereno negativnim pokazateljima smrtnosti i obolijevanja te preventivno i rizično zdravstveno ponašanje nejednako raspoređeno medu društvenim slojevima. Rezultati istraživanja provedenog u Zagrebu i okolici 1990., prikazani u drugom dijelu rada, ukazuju na postojanje značajnih nejednakosti u zdravlju i zdravstvenoj zaštiti u našoj populaciji. Osnovni oblik zdravstvenih nejednakosti u nas izgleda, uz izvjesna odstupanja kod pojedinih pokazatelja, ovako: na vrhu stratifikacijske ljestvice s najboljim pokazateljima subjektivnog zdravlja, pristupačnosti zdravstvene zaštite te preventivnog zdravstvenog ponašanja nalaze se direktori i stručnjaci, tj. skupine s najvišim socioekonomskim statusom; na dnu, s najlošijim pokazateljima, nalaze se poljoprivrednici i niže skupine radnika. This paper {{deals with}} effect of social {{stratification}} {{on health and}} health care. Differences in health status between social groups {{as the result of}} their position on stratification scale are considered as health inequalities. Results of the international studies which are reviewed {{in the first part of}} the paper show that health, i. e. health status measured by negative indicators such as mortality and morbidity rates as well as health behavior are unequally distributed between social classes. In general, members of <b>higher</b> <b>social</b> <b>groups</b> have better health status (longer life expectancy, lower mortality and morbidity rates, more positive health behavior) than those from the groups with lower socioeconomic status. In the second part of the paper the first empirical evidence on social inequalities in health and health care in the Croatian population is shown. In the research carried out in the Zagreb area in 1990. the considerable inequalities were discovered in health status when measured by self-perceived general state of health, experience of symptoms, pain and worry about health. The social groups reported also significant differing in dental health. Social inequalities are shown when accessibility and utilization of health care services are analyzed. The inequalities are significant in primary health care and high discretionary dental care, while low discretion specialist and hospital services are rather equally distributed. Considerable inequalities were also discovered in preventive behavior.

In an attempt to create an orderly administration through a better understanding of the populace, the Raj authorities instituted various measures of classifying the people of India. One such measure was the Criminal Tribes Act of 1871, under the provisions of which the Meenas were placed. The community remained stigmatised for many years, notably by influential officials of the Raj such as Herbert Hope Risley and Denzil Ibbetson, and were sometimes categorised as animists and as a hill tribe similar to the Bhils. The Meenas remained an officially-designated criminal tribe until 1952, three years after the Act had been repealed.

DESIGN: The Whitehall cohort study and the London cohort of the WHO multinational study of vascular disease in diabetes. SETTING: London. SUBJECTS: 17, 264 male civil servants (17, 046 without diabetes, 218 with diabetes) aged 40 - 64 examined in 1967 - 9, and 300 people with diabetes aged 35 - 55 from London clinics examined in 1975 - 7. Both cohorts were followed up until January 1995. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Mortality from all causes, cardiovascular disease, and ischaemic heart disease. RESULTS: In both cohorts people in the lower <b>social</b> <b>groups</b> were older, had higher blood pressure, and were more likely to smoke. In the Whitehall study, the prevalence of heart disease was higher in the lowest <b>social</b> <b>group</b> compared with the highest group, by 6 % among non-diabetic people (P = 0. 0001) and by 14 % among diabetic subjects (P = 0. 02). In the WHO study proteinuria was more common in the lowest <b>social</b> <b>group</b> compared with the highest (27 % v 15 %, P = 0. 01), as was retinopathy (54 % v 48 %, P = 0. 5). There was a clear socioeconomic gradient in all cause mortality in both cohorts, with death rates being about twice as high in the lowest compared with the <b>highest</b> <b>social</b> <b>groups.</b> In the Whitehall study this gradient was similar in both diabetic and non-diabetic subjects, and it persisted for mortality from cardiovascular disease and from ischaemic heart disease. About half of the increased risk of death in the lowest <b>social</b> <b>group</b> was accounted for by blood pressure and smoking.

40|$|AbstractDespite rising uptake of {{maternal}} healthcare in Pakistan, inequities persist. To-date, attempts {{to explain and}} address these differentials have focused predominantly on increasing awareness, geographic and financial accessibility. However, in a context where 70 % of healthcare is private sector provided, it becomes pertinent to consider the value associated with this good. This study examined patterns {{of maternal}} healthcare use across socioeconomic groups within a rural community, and the meanings and values attached to this behaviour, to provide new insight into the causes of persistent inequity. A 10 -month qualitative {{study was conducted in}} rural Punjab, Pakistan in 2010 / 11. Data were generated using 94 in-depth interviews, 11 focus group discussions and 134 observational sessions. Twenty-one pregnant women were followed longitudinally as case studies. The village was comprised of distinct <b>social</b> <b>groups</b> organised within a caste-based hierarchy. Complex patterns of maternal healthcare use were found, linked not only to material resources but also to the apparent social status associated with particular consumption patterns. The <b>highest</b> <b>social</b> <b>group</b> primarily used free public sector services; their social position ensuring receipt of acceptable care. The richer members of the middle <b>social</b> <b>group</b> used a local private midwife and actively constructed this behaviour as a symbol of wealth and status. Poorer members of this group felt pressure to use the afore-mentioned midwife despite the associated financial burden. The lowest <b>social</b> <b>group</b> lacked financial resources to use private sector services and opted instead to avoid use altogether and, in cases of complications, use public services. Han, Nunes, and Dreze's (2010) model of status consumption offers insight into these unexpected usage patterns. Privatization of healthcare within highly hierarchical societies may be susceptible to status consumption, resulting in unforeseen patterns of use and persistent inequities. To-date these influences have not been widely recognised, but they deserve greater scrutiny by researchers and policy-makers given the persistence of the private sector...|$|R

To improve {{understanding of this}} variation, the article focuses on {{each end of the}} social gradient. It compares the extent of the higher disability prevalence in low <b>social</b> <b>groups</b> (referred to as disability disadvantage) and of the lower prevalence in <b>high</b> <b>social</b> <b>groups</b> (disability advantage); country-specific advantages/disadvantages are discussed regarding the possible influence of welfare regimes. Methods Cross-sectional disability prevalence is measured by longstanding health-related activity limitation (AL) in the 2009 European Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC) across 26 countries classified into four welfare regime groups. Logistic models adjusted by country, age and sex (in all 30 – 79 years and in three age-bands) measured the country-specific ORs across education, representing the AL-disadvantage of low-educated and AL-advantage of high-educated groups relative to middle-educated groups. Results The relative AL-disadvantage of the loweducated groups was small in Sweden (eg, 1. 2 (1. 0 – 1. 4)), Finland, Romania, Bulgaria and Spain (youngest age-band), but was large in the Czech Republic (eg, 1. 9 (1. 7 – 2. 2)), Denmark, Belgium, Italy and Hungary. The high-educated groups had a small relative AL-advantage in Denmark (eg, 0. 9 (0. 8 – 1. 1)), but a large AL-advantage in Lithuania (eg, 0. 5 (0. 4 – 0. 6)), half of the Baltic and Eastern European countries, Norway and Germany (youngest age-band).

Highest risks were in areas of <b>high</b> badger <b>social</b> <b>group</b> density and <b>high</b> rates of persecution, potentially representing both responsive persecution of badgers in high cattle risk areas and effects of persecution on cattle bTB risk through badger <b>social</b> <b>group</b> disruption. Average badger persecution was associated with reduced cattle bTB risk (compared with high persecution areas), so persecution may contribute towards sustaining bTB hotspots; findings with important implications for existing and planned disease control programmes...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{attempts}} to define post-colonial theory {{as a method}} by which we can better understand cultural resistance and the relations of power between <b>social</b> <b>groups.</b> In the thesis, I demonstrate how resistance to a natural environment or to others is the key factor {{in the formation of}} <b>social</b> <b>groups.</b> Consequently, resistance plays an essential role in the <b>social</b> <b>group's</b> culture and how the <b>social</b> <b>group</b> defines itself in contrast to its neighbours. The thesis offers new definitions for some frequently used terms in post-colonial theory. For instance, the First, Second, Third and Fourth Worlds are defined as positions on a hierarchical pyramid upon which the <b>higher</b> a <b>social</b> <b>group</b> is situated, the more power and cultural influence it will have on others. The top of the pyramid is reserved for the <b>social</b> <b>group</b> that has hegemony over all others; the bottom is where we find the <b>social</b> <b>groups</b> that see themselves as most colonized. This positioning relies entirely on the <b>social</b> <b>group</b> tends to perceive itself rather than how it is perceived by others. The text is divided into two parts. The first part develops the theory which is then applied to two works of critical theory in the second part. The two works that are studied are George Grant's Technology and Empire and Pierre Vallières' Nègres blancs d'Amérique. Both of these texts offer a sample of the kinds of resistance that were produced, and still are, by their respective cultures: English Canada and Québec...|$|R

The research was conducted in Gwadar, a coastal town in Makran, Balochistan, Pakistan. ^ The population of Gwadar is primarily of Baloch ethnicity. However, there is significant diversity among the populace based upon socioeconomic status of the families. There are two major categories: the <b>higher</b> <b>social</b> status <b>groups</b> (Mirs, Rinds, Raees, etc.), and the lower <b>social</b> status <b>groups</b> of Maids (fishermen) and Darzadics (laborers). The Mirs, Rinds, and Raees are of white complexion, and are considered 2 ̆ 2 real Baloch. 2 ̆ 2 In contrast, the Maids and Darzadics have Negroid features with dark complexion, and are believed to be the indigenous people of Gwadar. ^ The results of my general survey conducted on a sample of 117 households indicate that 42 (35. 9...|$|R
25|$|The {{proportion}} of females {{as a predictor}} of c was largely mediated by social sensitivity (Sobel z = 1.93, P= 0.03) which is in vein with previous research showing that women score <b>higher</b> on <b>social</b> sensitivity tests. While a mediation, statistically speaking, clarifies the mechanism underlying the relationship between a dependent and an independent variable, Wolley agreed {{in an interview with the}} Harvard Business Review that these findings are saying that groups of women are smarter than groups of men. However, she relativizes this stating that the actual important thing is the <b>high</b> <b>social</b> sensitivity of <b>group</b> members.|$|R
