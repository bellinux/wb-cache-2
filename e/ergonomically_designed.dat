40|$|Quality Function Deployment is {{proposed}} {{as an effective}} design method to integrate ergonomics needs and comfort into hand tool design because it explicitly addresses the translation of customer needs into engineering characteristics. A crucial step during QFD concerns the linking of engineering characteristics to customer needs in the House of Quality by the design team. It is generally assumed (looking at all the QFD success stories) that design teams can accurately predict the correlations between customer needs and engineering characteristics (also referred to as "Whats"/"Hows" correlations). This paper explicitly tests this assumption by comparing the "Whats"/"Hows" correlations estimated by a design team with those observed in a systematic user evaluation study, {{which has not been}} done before. Testing the assumption is important, because inaccurate estimates may lead to <b>ergonomically</b> ineffective (re) <b>design</b> of hand tools and a waste of company resources. Results revealed that the design team's correlation estimates were not as accurate as is generally assumed. Twenty-five percent of the estimates differed significantly with those observed in the user evaluation study. Thus, QFD is a useful method to assist design teams in <b>designing</b> <b>ergonomically</b> more comfortable hand tools, but only on the condition that the correlations between customer needs and engineering characteristics are validated, preferably by means of a systematic user evaluation study. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{introduces}} a user-centered design process and case study {{evaluation of a}} novel wearable visualization system for team sports, coined TeamAwear. TeamAwear consists of three basketball jerseys that are equipped with electroluminescent wires and surfaces. Each jersey can be wirelessly controlled to represent game-related information on the player in real-time, such {{as the amount of}} individual fouls, scores and time alerts. A participatory usercentered approach guided the development process towards a more meaningful, ethically and <b>ergonomically</b> valid <b>design.</b> The system aims to enhance the awareness and understanding of game-related public information for all stakeholders, including players, referees, coaches and audience members. We initially hypothesized that such increased awareness would positively influence in-game decisions by players, resulting in a more interesting and enjoyable game play experience for all participants. Instead, the case study evaluation demonstrated TeamAwear’s perceived usefulness particularly for non-playing stakeholders, such as the audience, referees and coaches, supporting more accurate coaching assessments, better understanding of in-game situations and increased enjoyment for spectators. The high amount of game-related cognitive load on the players during game-play seems to hinder its influence on in-game decisions...|$|R

40|$|We {{are using}} many {{designed}} artefacts {{in our daily}} life. These artefacts are typically in physical interaction with the human body, and cause stresses and deformations inside the tissues. When these stresses exceed a given level, the proper physiological functioning of the tissues is limited, and ergonomics discomfort or even medical complications can appear. It {{is important to consider}} these effects in designing artefacts. However, consideration of these effects is not straightforward, because we need more knowledge about the mechanisms of human-product physical interaction, about the behaviour of the tissues in the contact region, and about the opportunities to influence the interaction in a positive way. There are no means available to directly study the internal effects that appear inside the body of the user when a particular artefact is used. Therefore we have to use a mechanical-physiological model of the human body to generate the information needed for an <b>ergonomically</b> proper <b>designing</b> of artefacts. Apart from the simulation of the internal loads, this model is {{supposed to be able to}} model the physiological functioning. In the past several efforts have been made to develop combined anthropometric and mechanical models, that can approximate the behaviour of the human body. However, these models are not able to represent complex biomechanical properties, anthropometric variability, tissue relocation, complex mechanical properties, and physiological functioning of the involved tissues. The goal of this thesis is to explore knowledge, and to evelop and verify conceptual solutions for complex behavioural modelling of various human bodies and parts of it. The research hypothesis was that this goal can be achieved by the development of a knowledge intensive, multi-representational model of the human body, which has been called advanced human body model. This advanced model (i) considers the anthropometric variability of the whole body and its constituents, (ii) is able to compute the effects of the external loads on the internal structures and tissues of the body, (iii) provides information about the deformed shape of the body when it interacts with the used artefact, and (iv) integrates these aspects into one consistent system of knowledge and processing algorithms. In addition to collecting and structuring the knowledge needed for an advanced human body model, algorithms and procedures have been developed. The knowledge structures and the algorithms have been tested and validated in a pilot application. Commercial software tools were used together with newly developed programs to operationalise the advanced human body model. The software tools are able to support the consideration of anthropometric variability, to represent a cluster of shapes of the human body, to generate instances, to represent the mechanical and biophysical properties, to analyse the restructuring and loading of the internal tissues, to determine the physical deformation of the body being in contact with the artefact, and to facilitate using this information in an <b>ergonomically</b> proper <b>designing</b> of the artefact. In our application the artefacts were various sitting supports. The results obtained with the pilot implementation show that (i) useful shape models can be developed based on a small set of descriptive parameters, (ii) the simulation of the material properties based on the generalised Mooney-Rivlin constitutive equations provides no adequate results, and asks for further research, (iii) the current finite element based simulation packages can not sufficiently cope with the complexities of human body modelling, and (iv) advanced human body models open up new opportunities in optimising the shape of products according to ergonomics criteria.

40|$|The {{accurate}} {{execution of}} bimanual movements {{is important for}} almost all work. At the same time, {{there is only a}} limited amount of appropriate and possible combinations. Limitations arise from the task itself, but the human movement system also causes limitations. They might be due to its mechanical properties or result from central nervous structures that control movement. As a matter-of-fact some movement combinations are impossible to execute, some are difficult, whereas others are easily and accurately executable. Therefore, it is necessary to take limitations and preferences of the human movement system into account when <b>ergonomically</b> <b>designing</b> a workplace. Spijkers and Heuer (1995) developed the hypothesis of transient coupling during the specification of movement parameters to explain (some) interference phenomena that can occur during bimanual movements. It states, that distortions of movement execution (may) result from mutual cross-talk between the two processes that specify the movement parameters. The cross-talk, so the basic assumption, arises from their initial coupling that dissipates when different parameter values are specified but is preserved in case of same values. This leads to the following predictions: First, specification of different values takes more time, because decoupling is necessary. Second, the time courses of the specification processes exhibit mutual assimilation that is strong in the beginning and weakens as specification proceeds and coupling dissipates. Third, the coupling causes the specification processes (and the respective movement characteristics) to covary. Hence, covariation should be observable in case of same values, in case of different values it is only present if specification still is incomplete, because coupling has not yet been abolished. The present study addressed whether the transient coupling hypothesis also holds for the specification of movement direction after it had already been proved for movement amplitude (e. g. Heuer, Spijkers, Kleinsorge, van der Loo, & Steglich, 1998) and isometric forces (Steglich, Heuer, Spijkers, & Kleinsorge, 1999). Five experiments were conducted to test the predictions by means of two experimental methods: the movement precuing technique that is used to estimate the time needed for parameter specification, and the timed response method that traces the time courses of the specification processes. The predictions concerning the delayed specification and the assimilation of the specification processes in case of different values were fully confirmed. A further important result was, that the human movement system treats egocentrically equivalent movement directions as equal (i. e., movements which are symmetrical to the mid-sagittal plane), whereas parallel (i. e., allocentrically equivalent) and incompatible (i. e., neither symmetric nor parallel) are different. Of special interest was, that, opposite to expectation, parallel directions exhibited an allocentric covariation with the coupling mode that caused this covariation being established during the process of specification (initially they were egocentrically coupled, and this coupling mode, as predicted, was preserved in case of symmetric directions). Incompatible directions, on the other hand, did not covary at all, i. e. coupling was abolished here. Recommendations based on current experimental work for workplace design are: 1) Bimanual actions should be executed symmetrically, especially if they have to be performed under time pressure. 2) Parallel execution should be preferred to incompatible combinations, but 3) in both cases there should be enough time for preparation and / or the system should tolerate the resulting error in movement execution...|$|R
