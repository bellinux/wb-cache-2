40|$|AbstractTransdermal drug {{delivery}} {{is an attractive}} route of drug administration; however, there are relatively few marketed transdermal products. To increase delivery across the skin, strategies to enhance skin permeability are widely investigated, with microneedles demonstrating particular promise. Hydrogel-forming microneedles are inserted into the skin, and following dissolution of a drug loaded reservoir and movement of the drug through the created channels, the microneedle array is removed intact, and can then be readily and safely discarded. This study presents the formulation and evaluation of an integrated microneedle patch containing the Alzheimer’s drug, <b>donepezil</b> <b>hydrochloride.</b> The integrated patch consisted of hydrogel-forming microneedles in combination with a <b>donepezil</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> containing film.

40|$|Alzheimer disease (AD) {{involves}} {{neuronal degeneration}} with impaired cholinergic transmission in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus {{in areas of}} the brain particularly associated with memory and higher intellectual functioning. Other neurotransmitter deficits also occur, but the mechanisms underlying the widespread impairment of synaptic functions remain uncertain. Research on the molecular basis of AD has elucidated a pathogenic pathway from which a range of rational pharmacological interventions has emerged. Although at least 3 cholinesterase inhibitors (tacrine <b>hydrochloride,</b> <b>donepezil,</b> and rivastigmine tartrate) are now available and provide patients with modest relief, the most promising strategy involves approaches to retarding, halting, or preventing the formation or accumulation of beta-amyloid (Abeta) plaques. Estrogen is believed to have antioxidant or other anti-Abeta effects, as hormonal replacement therapy in women with menopause is associated with a reduced risk or delayed onset of AD. The association between nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and a reduced risk of AD has not yet been confirmed, but these agents may protect the brain from the reactive glial and microglial responses associated with Abeta deposition. Also, recent studies suggested that antioxidants, such as vitamin E taken alone or in combination with selegiline hydrochloride, can delay the progression of AD. Despite these encouraging results, no current therapy has been shown to halt or reverse the underlying disease process. The proof of the principle that anti-Abeta drugs will work in the transgenic models of AD is eagerly awaited with the expectation that they will eventually prove successful in humans...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{observe the}} effects of early {{intervention}} with effective components from a Chinese herbal formula (Huannao Yicong formula, HNYCF) on behavior and related indicators of cholinergic system in β-amyloid precursor protein (APP) transgenic mice. Methods: Sixty 3 -month-old APP 695 V 717 I transgenic mice were randomly divided into model group, high-dose HNYCF group (2. 80 g/（kg·d）), low-dose HNYCF group (1. 40 g/（kg·d）) and donepezil group (0. 65 mg/(kg·d）), with 15 mice in each group. Fifteen non-transgenic mice of the same genetic background were used as normal group. The model group and normal group were fed with equal volume of distilled water by gavage. After 6 -month continuous medication, the Morris water maze and the passive avoidance test were used to detect the visual spatial learning and memory ability of each mouse. Then the mice were decapitated and their cerebral cortex and hippocampus were isolated to homogenate by sonication. Contents of acetylcholine (ACh) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) activity in the homogenate were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and protein contents of cerebral cortex and hippocampus were measured by Coomassie brilliant blue method. Results: Compared with the model group, high- and low-dose HNYCF and <b>donepezil</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> all improved spatial learning of APP mice in the Morris water maze. The ratio of swimming distance in the central area in the high-dose HNYCF group was longer than that in the model group (P＜ 0. 05). In the passive avoidance test, high- and low-dose HNYCF and <b>donepezil</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> improved memory function of APP mice by improving the escape latency and {{reducing the number of}} errors (P＜ 0. 05, P＜ 0. 01). High- and low-dose HNYCF and <b>donepezil</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> reduced the content of AChE, increased the activity of ChAT (P＜ 0. 01, P＜ 0. 05) and improved the content of ACh in hippocampus (P＜ 0. 05); high- and low-dose HNYCF and <b>donepezil</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> increased the content of ACh in cortex (P＜ 0. 05). <b>Donepezil</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> reduced the content of AChE in cortex (P＜ 0. 05), however, high- and low-dose HNYCF had no obvious influence (P＞ 0. 05). High- and low-dose HNYCF increased the content of ChAT in cortex (P＜ 0. 05), whereas <b>donepezil</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> had no obvious influence (P＞ 0. 05).

40|$|Background: Recent {{evidence}} shows that a confirmed diagnosis of delerium increases both patient morbidity and mortality. Importantly, these increases are independent of patient age, and presence of co-morbid disease. In the last few years, there has been evidence that acetylcholinesterase inhibitors may have a limited role in managing episodes of mild/moderate delirium. Methods: This case study reports a patient, whose behavioral disturbances caused by delirium, responded well to <b>donepezil</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> {{in a nursing home}} in Dundee, United Kingdom. Methods: Our clinical case focuses on a patient who was diagnosed with a mixed picture delirium after developing PUO. This case report notes that Mr A, a patient already prescribed <b>donepezil</b> <b>hydrochloride,</b> saw an improvement in his behavioral symptoms after an increase in his dose. This enabled the patient to avoid receiving neuroleptic or benzodiazepine medication, known to be particularly problematic in older patients. Conclusion: The authors tentatively propose that patients in community care already prescribed acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, may benefit from an increased dose in cases of mild delirium (where there is no clear cause or requirement for hospital admission). In line with the significant impact that delerium has upon older patients in community care, we would call for further studies looking at the inflience that these medications may have on the sequelae of delirium in patients in the community...|$|E

Data were gathered from records of 431 patients; only three patients were younger than 60 years. Results: There was a 1. 94 -fold {{increase in the number of}} prescriptions including DPZ over 6 years. The proportion of patients to whom other medicines were administered along with DPZ was 65. 6 % (n= 283) and the proportion of those taking at least one anticholinergic agent was 24. 1 % (n= 104). The mean number of medicines among subjects taking at least one anticholinergic was 5. 7, and the mean cumulative ACB score for anticholinergics contained in these medicines was 2. 6. Among 104 patients to whom the anticholinergics were administered along with DPZ, two outpatients taking urologic medicines such as oxybutynin hydrochloride or tolterodine tartrate were found.

40|$|ABSTRACT − The {{objective}} of this work is to investigate the effect of chemical enhancer and current on the flux of done-pezil hydrochloride (DH) through skin. Ethanol and N-methyl pyrrolidone (NMP) were used as chemical enhancers in com-bination with iontophoresis. We also have studied the effect of pH on flux and evaluated the role of electroosmosis. In vitro flux study was performed at 33 oC, using side-by-side diffusion cell and full thickness hairless mouse skin. Passive flux of DH without enhancer was very small. As the concentration of enhancer increased, passive flux increased. After current application, flux increased markedly and the time to reach maximum decreased. Without enhancer, maximum flux was about 50 fold larger than that obtained without current. These results indicate that electromigration is playing a major role for the transport. As the enhancer concentration increased, flux also increased. NMP and ethanol increased not only the passive delivery, but also the iontophoretic delivery. Flux results indicate that ethanol has better ability than NMP in enhancing the transport of DH. The magnitudes of increase in flux by these enhancers indicate {{that there is a}} large synergistic effect in flux enhancement. Flux results from pH study showed that electroosmotic flow is reversed at low pH and the flux is hin-dered. These results provided some information on the flux enhancing ability of ethanol and NMP in combination with ion-tophoresis. The data also provided some mechanistic insights into the role of electromigration and electroosmosis on flux through skin.

40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this study was to develop a PLGA microspheres-based {{donepezil}} (DP) formulation which was expected to sustain release of DP for one week with high encapsulation efficiency (EE). DP derived from <b>donepezil</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> was encapsulated in PLGA microspheres by the O/W emulsion-solvent evaporation method. The optimized formulation which avoided the crushing of microspheres during the preparation process was characterized in terms of particle size, morphology, drug loading and EE, physical state of DP in the matrix and in vitro and in vivo release behavior. DP microspheres were prepared successfully with average diameter of 30 [*]µm, drug loading of 15. 92 [*]±[*] 0. 31 % and EE up to 78. 79 [*]±[*] 2. 56 %. Scanning electron microscope image showed it has integrated spherical shape with no drug crystal and porous on its surface. Differential scanning calorimetry and X-ray diffraction results suggested DP was in amorphous state or molecularly dispersed in microspheres. The Tg of PLGA was increased with the addition of DP. The release profile in vitro was characterized with slow but continuous release that lasted for about one week and fitted well with first-order model, which suggested the diffusion governing release mechanism. After single-dose administration of DP microspheres via subcutaneous injection in rats, the plasma concentration of DP reached peak concentration at 0. 50 d, and then declined gradually, but was still detectable at 15 d. A good correlation between in vitro and in vivo data was obtained. The results suggest the potential use of DP microspheres for treatment of Alzheimer's disease over long periods...|$|E
40|$|The {{prevalence}} of {{chronic kidney disease}} (CKD) as well as Alzheimer's disease (AD) increases with age. With {{the aging of the}} population in Japan, there is an increasing likelihood that patients with CKD will receive <b>donepezil</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> (DPZ), an antidementia drug, in the near future. Nevertheless, there have been few reports on how to use DPZ in patients with severe CKD. We report on 2 CKD stage 5 patients who received DPZ under different prescriptions. In case 1, 3 mg/day of DPZ was initially administered for 4 months, after which the dose was increased to 5 mg/day. In case 2, 5 mg was administered twice a week. The plasma concentration of DPZ was measured and the effectiveness was assessed using the Mini-Mental Health State Examination and the Hasegawa Dementia Rating Scale. We found that (1) only a slight increase in the plasma concentration of DPZ was observed with a dose of 3 mg daily, (2) there was {{a significant increase in the}} plasma concentration with a dose of 5 mg daily, and (3) when 5 mg of DPZ was administered twice a week, the plasma concentration did not differ significantly from healthy controls who had received 5 mg daily. Although cognitive function was improved best when the 5 -mg dose was administered daily with no apparent side effects, the plasma concentration came close to reaching a toxic level at this dose. Careful follow-up may be essential when DPZ is used at 5 mg/day or greater in severe CKD patients...|$|E

40|$|Different crystal {{forms and}} {{amorphous}} form of <b>donepezil</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> were prepared and characterized, using various analytical techniques. Hydrate form I is stable only at lower relative humidity (RH), while at higher RH it sorbesadditional water. Forms II, III and V {{were identified as}} polymorphs, whereas form III is thermodynamically stable. Form V was prepared by heating of hydrate IV at high temperature (about 150 °C). Three different forms of hydrate IV were obtained and characterized. Differential scanning calorimetry and X-ray powder diffraction are the most promising analytical methods for differentiation between crystal forms, both polymorphs and hydrates. Methods could be also used in determination of physical form of a drug, incorporated into solid dosage form. Thermal methods explain the most significant difference in dehydration of different forms IVČ transformation to pure polymorphic forms or mixture thereof. On heating of hydrates I and IV- 1, two novel crystal forms were prepared and characterized, namely crystal forms VII and VIII. Pripravili in karakterizirali smo razliène kristalne oblike in amorfno obliko donepezil hidroklorida. Hidrat I je stabilen le pri nizki relativni vlaznosti in pri visji relativni vlaznosti absorbira vodo. Oblike II, III in V so polimorfi, termodinamsko je stabilna oblika III. Oblika V nastane s segrevanjem hidrata IV pri temperaturi okrog 150 °C. Pripravili in karakterizirali smo tri oblike hidrata IV. Kot najprimernejsi metodi za doloèitev kristalnih oblik, tako polimorfov kot hidratov, sta se izkazali diferenèna dinamièna kalorimetrija (DSC) in rentgenska praskovna analiza. Metodi sta uporabni tudi za doloèitev oblike donepezil hidroklorida v trdni farmacevtski obliki. S termièno analizo smo ugotovili razlike v dehidratacijirazliènih oblik hidrata IV, to je prehod v èisto polimorfno obliko ali v zmes polimorfov.

40|$|Patients with Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) {{demonstrate}} a sensitive and specific short-term memory impairment for visual bindings (e. g. {{the combination of}} shapes and colours) that is absent in healthy ageing (Parra et al., 2009) and other dementias (Della Sala et al., 2012). This impairment is also seen in cases of asymptomatic, familial AD (Parra et al., 2010). The visual short term memory binding (VSTMB) impairment in AD has clear clinical and neuropsychological implications which are investigated in this thesis. Firstly, {{the utility of the}} VSTMB paradigm was contrasted with the Free and Cued Selective Reminding Task with Immediate Recall (FCSRT-IR) – which has recently been posited as a useful diagnostic marker of AD pathology (Dubois et al., 2014). The results indicated that the former is not affected by age, where the latter is, suggesting that the VSTMB paradigm provides a suitable baseline to measure cognitive decline associated with AD. The development of a parallel version of the FCSRT-IR is also reported. Secondly, a 24 -week longitudinal study of patients receiving treatment for AD (<b>donepezil</b> <b>hydrochloride)</b> revealed that patients who respond to this treatment on cognitive scales also experience change in VSTMB performance. These responders, however, did not significantly improve on the FCSRT-IR during the study. This suggests that anticholinergic treatment may have an effect on VSTMB performance. Additionally, a meta-analysis that investigates the effect of a study’s funding on donepezil RCT outcome showed that industry-funded studies report larger changes in cognition than independent studies. Lastly, an auditory binding experimental paradigm was developed, with a view to reveal a non-visual binding impairment in AD, investigating whether the binding impairment reflects a general or modality-specific memory impairment. The overall conclusions of this thesis confirm that the VSTMB impairment has significant promise as an index of AD. The auditory binding paradigm, by contrast, shares conceptual similarity with the VSTMB paradigm, but may have restricted clinical use within the AD patient population...|$|E
40|$|Background: Amyloid {{precursor}} protein (APP) forms with apparent molecular weights of 130, 110, and 106 kd {{are present in}} human platelets. It has been demonstrated that Alzheimer disease (AD) is specifically associated with a decreased APP forms ratio in platelets. Objective: To investigate whether acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitor treatment modifies the ratio of platelet APP forms in patients with AD. Patients and Methods: From a large sample of patients with probable AD, 30 with mild to moderate AD were selected. Each patient underwent a clinical evaluation including the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and platelet APP forms analysis at baseline and after 30 days. During this interval, 20 of 30 patients with AD were treated with <b>donepezil</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> (5 mg/d), a piperidine phosphate-based cholinesterase inhibitor. Platelets were subjected to Western blot analysis using monoclonal antibody (22 C 11). The ratio between the immunoreactivity of the higher-molecular-weight APP form (130 kd) and the lower forms (106 and 110 kd) was measured. Results: All patients taking donepezil completed the 30 days of treatment without adverse effects. The platelet APP forms ratio at baseline did not differ between the 2 AD groups (mean±SD optical density ratio: untreated AD, 0. 47 ± 0. 12; treated AD, 0. 38 ± 0. 18), whereas a {{significant difference was found}} at follow-up (mean±SD optical density ratio: untreated AD, 0. 45 ± 0. 17; treated AD, 0. 77 ± 0. 29; P<. 001). A significant improvement in MMSE scores in treated AD patients was observed from baseline (16. 9 ± 3. 8) to 30 days (18. 9 ± 4. 42) (P<. 009, 30 days vs baseline), but no significant correlation was found in treated AD patients between MMSE score improvement and APP forms/ratio increase (P=. 09). Conclusions: Administration of AChE inhibitors increases the ratio of APP forms in platelets of patients with AD, suggesting a potential effect of AChE inhibitors on APP trafficking or processing in a peripheral cell...|$|E
40|$|Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a {{psychiatric}} condition that can develop following {{exposure to a}} traumatic event involving actual or threatened death or serious injury. Responses include intense fear, helplessness or horror. Symptoms are characterised into clusters, described as re-experiencing, avoidance, and arousal. These symptoms, which are also evident in other conditions, {{have been associated with}} dysfunctions in the central acetylcholinergic system. Benefits from administering acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEI) to people suffering these symptoms have been demonstrated. <b>Donepezil</b> <b>hydrochloride,</b> a reversible inhibitor of the enzyme acetylcholinesterase, is used in the treatment of conditions with difficulties in cognitive function, but has not been used in PTSD. The aim of this thesis was to determine (1) whether there was a difference in the ACh system in people with PTSD and (2) whether administration of an AChEI would change the symtomatology. IDEX (I¹ ² ³ iododexetimide) has been useful in imaging muscarinic-ACh receptors using Single Photon Emission Computerised Tomography (SPECT) and was utilised to investigate whether cholinergic activity in PTSD is altered. One hundred and sixty eight potential subjects were screened and eleven PTSD subjects were enrolled in the IDEX SPECT study. Three healthy non-PTSD control subjects also completed the study. Due to technical complications only the data obtained from eight PTSD and two control subjects was available for analysis. Imaging data for 2 further healthy non-PTSD control subjects were obtained from another study. Sixteen subjects were enrolled in the donepezil open label study (assessed at baseline, Week 2, 6 and 10). Nine PTSD subjects completed the 10 -week trial and seven withdrew prematurely (at or after Week 2) due to side effects or a worsening of PTSD symptoms. For the IDEX SPECT study, a voxel-by-voxel statistical analysis of the PTSD subject group versus the control group showed both areas of reduced and increased IDEX uptake. Significant clusters in the PTSD group with a reduced IDEX uptake centred around the bilateral hippocampus, left insula and right precuneus, while increased IDEX uptake appeared in the caudate head. For the donepezil study, in the per-protocol analysis (including only the 9 subjects that completed the protocol), all psychological assessments revealed a difference between the totals obtained at the Week 10 visit compared to those at the Baseline visit and the improvement was in the order of 51 %. The intention-to-treat analysis (including all 16 subjects), a repeated measures Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) with a mixed models approach showed that all psychological measures demonstrated statistically significant benefits of the treatment. All subjects who completed the protocol recounted considerable improvement in their overall PTSD symptom profile, which covered symptoms {{in each of the three}} clusters. The results of the IDEX SPECT study suggest that alterations in ACh binding in PTSD are evident and may begin to explain a part of the altered cognitive symptomatology apparent in this condition. The pilot open label donepezil trial provided some preliminary evidence that treatment with an AChEI can lessen the intrusions and distress associated with traumatic memories in people with PTSD.
