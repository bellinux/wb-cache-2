25|$|Railroads {{generally}} preferred locomotives {{with fewer}} axles, to reduce maintenance costs. The {{number of axles}} required was dictated by the maximum axle loading of the railroad in question. A builder would typically add axles until the maximum weight on any one axle was acceptable to the railroad's maximum axle loading. A locomotive with a wheel arrangement of two lead axles, two <b>drive</b> <b>axles,</b> and one trailing axle was a high-speed machine. Two lead axles were necessary to have good tracking at high speeds. Two <b>drive</b> <b>axles</b> had a lower reciprocating mass than three, four, five or six coupled axles. They were thus able to turn at very high speeds due to the lower reciprocating mass. A trailing axle was able to support a huge firebox, hence most locomotives with the wheel arrangement of 4-4-2 (American Type Atlantic) were called free steamers {{and were able to}} maintain steam pressure regardless of throttle setting.|$|E
25|$|A unique {{feature of}} these units {{is that there}} is a {{variable}} traction control system in their computer systems. One of the differences between an ES44AC and an ES44C4 are the air cylinders and linkages on the truck sideframes of the ES44C4; these are part of the traction control system. Every time a variation in grade, traction, or wheel slip occurs, the computer will adjust the pressure in these cylinders to maintain sufficient adhesion, by varying the weight on the <b>drive</b> <b>axles.</b>|$|E

The {{finite element model}} of <b>drive</b> <b>axle</b> housing was built by using the solid element and the shell element respectively. Vertical bend {{strength}} and stiffness under 2. 5 times of fully load of the <b>drive</b> <b>axle</b> housing were calculated by finite element method. By comparing {{the results of the}} vertical bend strength and stiffness of both models, we could know that both of the two models can be used to analyze the whole stress situation of <b>drive</b> <b>axle</b> housing. Because there were fewer elements of <b>drive</b> <b>axle</b> housing model based on shell element, the amount of final calculation was less. It is more feasible to analyze the whole stress situation of <b>drive</b> <b>axle</b> housing by establishing <b>drive</b> <b>axle</b> housing based on shell element...|$|R

Through the model analysis, the inherent frequencies and mode shapes of front 10 order modes are obtained respectively. According to damage accumulation theory and the rain-flow counting method, and the amplitudes and mean values of counted cycles can be determined. Fatigue analysis of automotive <b>drive</b> <b>axle</b> housing under the sine load spectrum are analyzed by applying ABAQUS/FE-SAFE software, and the overall fatigue life contours and distribution of hazardous area are obtained. Under the results of analysis, the improved design of automotive <b>drive</b> <b>axle</b> housing is made. Therefore, the new methods for improving life distribution and design of automotive <b>drive</b> <b>axle</b> housing are proposed in this paper...|$|R

According to national standard of the Bench Test, with finite element method, the finite element model is built and the static strength analysis is made by the FEM-software ABAQUS 6. 8. On the base of the result of stress-strain analysis and the model validation, with the fatigue software FEMFAT 4. 7 D, the research on the cumulative damage and endurance limit safety factors is studied in terms of the Miner modified fatigue theory in the <b>drive</b> <b>axle</b> housing assemble.

25|$|The {{locomotive}} pinions {{engage the}} rack and {{provide all the}} traction and braking effort; the wheels are free to revolve on the <b>drive</b> <b>axles,</b> {{to allow for the}} inevitable difference between the wheel radius and the effective radius of the pinion. The wheels serve only to support and guide the vehicle; if the pinion were missing, handbrake on and locomotive crank locked, the vehicle would still roll down the mountain. (The wheels are not capable of providing useful adhesion on such a gradient, so this is not the disadvantage it might seem.) The two driving axle pinions on a locomotive are mounted with a half a pitch difference between them. Combined with the half pitch difference in the two rack bars, this feature aims to make the transfer of power more continuous, and thus smooth the hauling of the train. In spite of this, the vehicles still suffer from very high levels of vibration.|$|E
25|$|When the City & South London Railway (C) was {{authorised}} in 1884, it {{was intended}} to be a cable-hauled line, but during the construction phase, the promotors decided to use electric traction, {{despite the fact that the}} technology was in its infancy. Two prototype locomotives were built by Mather & Platt in 1889, to a design by Dr Edward Hopkinson, with Beyer-Peacock supplying many of the mechanical parts. No. 1 used motors mounted directly on the <b>drive</b> <b>axles,</b> while No. 2 had motors driven through gears. Trials were conducted in December 1889 with No. 1 and two passenger cars. No. 2 was also used for testing, but it is not clear whether it pulled any cars. A production run of 14 locomotives was then built, numbered 1 to 14, duplicating the original numbers 1 and 2. Each had four wheels, with Edison-Hopkinson motors fitted to the axles, which were permanently wired in series. A 26-step rheostat was used to control the speed, and a switch which altered the connections to the armature was used to reverse the direction of travel.|$|E

2500|$|At {{the end of}} the 1980s, the Swiss Federal Railways began {{drafting}} a new computer compatible and UIC compliant numbering system for its motive power. The superscript indices in the existing scheme (e.g. Re 4/4IV, V, VIâ€¦) presented a particular problem for this draft new system's planned method of data collection. By 1988, the drafting process had led to a first draft of a UIC compliant numbering scheme, which, however, never came fully into operation. [...] At that time, the plan was that the first digit of a vehicle's number would denote the number of <b>drive</b> <b>axles,</b> and the second digit would correspond with the superscript used for that vehicle's series under the original system (e.g. Re 4/4II would become Re 420). [...] For locomotives with carrying axles, the oblique stroke included in the old name would be replaced by the digit 9 (e.g. Ae 4/7 would become Ae 497).|$|E

50|$|Two motors were {{mounted in}} each bogie frame. The motors drove large cogwheels via {{spring-loaded}} sprockets on each side, and the cogwheels drove a jackshaft. The crank pins of the jackshafts drove - via a coupling rod - the crank pins {{of the two}} outer <b>drive</b> <b>axles</b> of the bogie. The inner side of this coupling rod contained a pin, which drove the crank pins of the two inner <b>drive</b> <b>axles</b> via a second coupling rod. Because {{of the position of}} the motors, and therefore also the jackshaft, the coupling rods were offset slightly relative to the <b>drive</b> <b>axles.</b> From a maintenance point of view this kind of drive was cheaper than a complex split coupling rod, but during service it was considerably more bumpy.
