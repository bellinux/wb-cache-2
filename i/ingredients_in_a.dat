The company has established a preference for purchasing eggs and pork-based products from those suppliers that use cage-free production methods.|$|E

Her curse entailed mixing up <b>ingredients</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> frying pan, and was undertaken in the presence of two colleagues. In another instance, she was claimed to have created a wax image of Kaiser Wilhelm II and then melted it during the First World War.|$|E

25|$|Another medieval {{emphasis}} foreshadowed in Marcellus is {{a concern}} for locating ingredients in their native environment, replacing the exotic flora and fauna prescribed in texts from antiquity with indigenous species. Recipes in both Marcellus and the medieval writers tend toward “polypharmacy,” {{or the use of}} a great number of <b>ingredients</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> single preparation. Many recipes in De medicamentis contain at least ten ingredients, and one, the antidotus Cosmiana (29.11), is compounded of 73.|$|E
25|$|Sephardi-style hamin {{typically}} includes whole {{eggs in the}} shell, {{which are}} placed {{on top of the}} mixture in the stewing pot and turn brown in the course of all-night cooking. The brown eggs, called haminados (güevos haminadavos in Ladino, huevos haminados in Spanish), are shelled before serving and placed {{on top of the other}} cooked <b>ingredients.</b> <b>In</b> <b>a</b> Tunisian version, the brown eggs are cooked separately in a metal pot on the all-night stove with water and tea leaves (similar to tea eggs). Haminados can be cooked in this way even if no hamin is prepared. The addition of tea leaves, coffee grinds, or onion skins to the water dyes the shell purple and the white a light brown, giving the egg a smooth creamy texture. In Israel, brown eggs are a popular accompaniment to ful medames (a dish of mashed broad beans) and they may also be served with hummus (a dip of mashed chickpeas mixed with tahini) and in a Sabich sandwich.|$|E
25|$|After {{the first}} World Trade Center bombing in February 1993, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) began to {{investigate}} Abdel-Rahman {{and his followers}} more closely. An Egyptian informant wearing a listening device for the FBI managed to record Abdel-Rahman saying he preferred attacks be concentrated on US military targets, but also stating acts of violence against civilian targets were not illicit. The most startling plan, the government charged, was to set off five bombs in 10 minutes, blowing up the United Nations, the Lincoln and Holland tunnels, the George Washington Bridge and a federal building housing the FBI. Government prosecutors showed videotapes of the defendants mixing bomb <b>ingredients</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> garage before their arrest in 1993. Abdel-Rahman was arrested on 24 June 1993, along with nine of his followers. On 1 October 1995, {{he was convicted of}} seditious conspiracy, solicitation to murder Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, conspiracy to murder President Mubarak, solicitation to attack a U.S. military installation, and conspiracy to conduct bombings; in 1996 he was sentenced to life in solitary confinement without parole.|$|E

500|$|In French cooking, plums are an <b>ingredients</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> {{significant}} {{tradition of}} cake making: [...] "...throughout {{the districts of}} the Loire, the Dordogne, the Lot and the Périgord, there [...] hardly a celebration, a wedding feast or celebration at which the dessert [...] not include some sort of plum or mirabelle tart, made with fresh or dried plums or jam according to the season." [...] The Mirabelle plum is a specific cultivar used to make Tarte aux mirabelles (plum tart). A Galette aux fruits {{is a type of}} galette made with yeast dough and covered with previously cooked fruit in season, such as plums (or quinces, apples, apricots). The fruit in these open tarts or flans is cut into suitably sized pieces and the cake is glazed: red glaze is recommended for red plum and rhubarb flans, [...] whereas apricot glaze is recommended in yellow plum and apricot flans.|$|E
500|$|In the 1950s some British pubs {{started to}} offer [...] "a pie and a pint", with hot {{individual}} steak and ale pies made easily {{on the premises}} by the landlord or his wife. In the 1960s this was developed into the then-fashionable [...] "chicken in a basket", a portion of roast chicken with chips, served on a napkin, in a wicker basket, by the Mill pub at Withington. Quality dropped but variety increased {{with the introduction of}} microwave ovens and freezer food. [...] "Pub grub" [...] expanded to include British food items such as steak and ale pie, steak and kidney pudding, shepherd's pie, fish and chips, bangers and mash, Sunday roast, and pasties. The gastropub movement of the 21st century, on the other hand, seeks to serve restaurant-quality food, cooked to order from fresh <b>ingredients,</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> pub setting. In 1964, pubs were serving 9.1% of meals eaten outside the home; this rose rapidly to 37.5% by 1997.|$|E
500|$|... "Honey" [...] {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics. Frank Owen of The Village Voice called the song a [...] "mesmerizing floor-filler, arousing memories of Hamilton Bohannon's hypnotic '70s metronome funk." [...] Alexandra Marshall of MTV wrote that its samples of [...] "Sometimes" [...] "work both as <b>ingredients</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> sonic collage and stay totally recognizable {{at the same}} time". A writer for The Guardian praised [...] "Honey" [...] as [...] "joyous, hypnotic, romping blues", while reviews from NME described the song as a [...] "sparkling diamond" [...] and a [...] "natural born dancefloor groove". In his book I Hear America Singing: An Introduction to Popular Music, author David Kastin notes that [...] "Honey" [...] was often singled out in reviews of Play for special praise. Jim Sullivan of The Boston Globe cited [...] "Honey" [...] as a highlight song from Play, while Gene Stout of Seattle Post-Intelligencer called it [...] "one of the album's most riveting tracks." [...] The song ranked at number twenty-four on The Village Voices annual Pazz & Jop critics' poll. On their year-end list, Spin named [...] "Honey" [...] the tenth best single of 1999.|$|E

500|$|An {{important}} part of the game is the accumulation of items, especially rare ones, which allow players to create powerful weapons, armour and food. There are many ways to obtain items, such as harvesting, excavating, logging, mining, defeating monsters, and digging by using Chocobos. Square Enix attempted to increase the opportunity for players to find rare items in order to equalize the game and stop the practice of [...] "gil selling", or exchanging real money for in-game items. The item auction system was shut down temporarily once due to some players exploiting the system. Items can be created by consuming elemental crystals (obtained by fighting monsters) with other <b>ingredients</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> process called [...] "synthesis". Recipe results can vary widely based on the player's skill, the quality of the player's equipment worn, and the ingredients used. There is large speculation (though nothing evidently documented yet) about the moon phase, direction the player is facing, in-game day (every day of the week is assigned an element), and even time of day the synthesis is performed to either increase or reduce the results of the recipe.|$|E

2500|$|Following Carol's eviction, HouseGuests {{competed in}} the [...] "Majority Rules" [...] Head of Household competition. For this competition, the HouseGuests were asked a series of {{questions}} about which of two HouseGuests would adhere to certain situations. The object was not to base the answer on personal opinions, but how they thought the majority would answer. The minority of the voters were eliminated each round; if there was a tie, none of the HouseGuests would be eliminated. Jen was the winner of the competition. On Day 14, HouseGuests {{competed in the}} [...] "Name That Pie" [...] food competition. For this competition, HouseGuests split into two teams and would bid on how many bites it would take to identify the two <b>ingredients</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> pie. If a player correctly identified the pie, they win a point for the team, but if they were unable to identify the pie, they would win a point for the opposing team; the first team to seven points would be the winner. The competition resulted in Amber, Daniele, Jameka, Jessica, Joe, and Kail being on slop for the week. That same day, Jen chose to nominate Daniele and Dick for eviction, claiming {{that the two of them}} were the most negative people in the house. On Day 15, Amber, Mike, and Joe were selected to play for the Power of Veto competition; Dustin was selected to host. Shortly before the competition, Jen made numerous statements to upset Amber, which led to numerous arguments in the house. The HouseGuests then competed in the [...] "Cutthroat Christmas" [...] Power of Veto competition. For this competition, HouseGuests were required to slide a curling stone down an icy path in an attempt to get it closest to the center; the person furthest from the center each round is eliminated. The eliminated HouseGuest from each round earns a prize, which can be taken from them at any time by another eliminated HouseGuest. Daniele was the winner of the Power of Veto for the second consecutive time. On Day 17, Daniele chose to use the Power of Veto to remove herself from the block, with Jen nominating Joe in her place. Fearing he would nominate her if he won Head of Household, Kail began attempting to get the votes to evict Dick from the house. Despite this, not even Kail's own alliance went along with her plan, thus ending the [...] "Mrs. Robinson" [...] alliance. On Day 20, Joe became the second HouseGuest to be evicted from the house in a vote of nine to one.|$|E

60|$|Great {{preparations}} {{were made}} by Amense for the banquet on the following week, for she had resolved that this should completely eclipse the entertainments of Nicotis.

For {{a day or two}} previous large supplies of food arrived from the farm and from the markets in the city; and early {{on the morning of the}} entertainment a host of professional cooks arrived to prepare the dinner. The head cooks superintended their labors. The meat consisted of beef and goose, ibex, gazelle, and oryx; for although large flocks of sheep were kept for their wool, the flesh was not eaten by the Egyptians. There were, besides, great numbers of ducks, quails, and other small fowl. The chief cooks superintended the cutting up of the meat and the selection of the different joints for boiling or roasting. One servant worked with his feet a bellows, raising the fire to the required heat; another skimmed the boiling caldrons with a spoon; and a third pounded salt, pepper, and other <b>ingredients</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> large mortar. Bakers and confectioners made light bread and pastry; the former being made in the form of rolls, sprinkled at the top with carraway and other seeds. The confectionary was made of fruit and other ingredients mixed with dough, and this was formed by a skillful workman into various artistic shapes, such as recumbent oxen, vases, temples, and other forms.
