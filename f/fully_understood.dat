5|$|Because {{pterosaur}} anatomy {{has been}} so heavily modified for flight, and immediate transitional fossil predecessors have not so far been described, the ancestry of pterosaurs is not <b>fully</b> <b>understood.</b> Several hypotheses have been advanced, including links to the avemetatarsalian-like Scleromochlus, an ancestry among the basal archosauriforms, like Euparkeria, or among the protorosaurs.|$|E
5|$|Maple syrup {{is often}} eaten with pancakes, waffles, French toast, oatmeal or porridge. It {{is also used}} as an {{ingredient}} in baking and as a sweetener or flavouring agent.

5|$|Other cell-death {{mechanisms}} include proteasomal and lysosomal system dysfunction {{and reduced}} mitochondrial activity. Iron accumulation in the substantia nigra is typically observed {{in conjunction with}} the protein inclusions. It may be related to oxidative stress, protein aggregation and neuronal death, but the mechanisms are not <b>fully</b> <b>understood.</b>|$|E
5|$|Quantula striata is {{the only}} known bioluminescent {{terrestrial}} mollusc. Pulses of light are emitted from a gland {{near the front of}} the foot and may have a communicative function, although the adaptive significance is not <b>fully</b> <b>understood.</b>|$|E

The official explanation presented later was that Ologun was being paid per the stipulations of his contract, but he did not <b>fully</b> <b>understand</b> the Japanese legalese in it, so he made a deal which he did not have <b>fully</b> <b>understand.</b>|$|R

5|$|The oxazolidinones are protein {{synthesis}} inhibitors: they stop {{the growth and}} reproduction of bacteria by disrupting translation of messenger RNA (mRNA) into proteins in the ribosome.

5|$|The precise {{mechanisms}} by which the effects of carbon monoxide are induced upon bodily systems, are complex and not yet <b>fully</b> <b>understood.</b> Known mechanisms include carbon monoxide binding to hemoglobin, myoglobin and mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase and restricting oxygen supply, and carbon monoxide causing brain lipid peroxidation.|$|E

5|$|Bohr became {{convinced}} that light behaved like both waves and particles, and in 1927, experiments confirmed the de Broglie hypothesis that matter (like electrons) also behaved like waves. He conceived the philosophical principle of complementarity: that items could have apparently mutually exclusive properties, such as being a wave or a stream of particles, depending on the experimental framework. He {{felt that it was}} not <b>fully</b> <b>understood</b> by professional philosophers.|$|E
5|$|Coprinopsis variegata can attack soil bacteria, such as {{species of}} Pseudomonas and Agrobacterium, {{and use them}} as {{nutrient}} sources. The fungus achieves this by growing specialized hyphae {{in the direction of}} the bacteria, sensing them with some chemoattractive mechanism not yet <b>fully</b> <b>understood.</b> The fungus then secretes compounds to digest the bacteria while growing assimilative hyphae to absorb the nutrients. The process is relatively rapid, and bacterial colonies can be assimilated in less than 24 hours.|$|E

5|$|The {{cell lines}} of origin are not <b>fully</b> <b>understood.</b> The {{mechanism}} may involve abnormal activation of stem cells. In the proximal airways, stem cells that express keratin 5 {{are more likely}} to be affected, typically leading to squamous-cell lung carcinoma. In the middle airways, implicated stem cells include club cells and neuroepithelial cells that express club cell secretory protein. Small-cell lung carcinoma may be derived from these cell lines or neuroendocrine cells, and may express CD44.|$|E
5|$|The {{mechanism}} by which a polyubiquitinated protein is targeted to the proteasome is not <b>fully</b> <b>understood.</b> Ubiquitin-receptor proteins have an N-terminal ubiquitin-like (UBL) domain and one or more ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domains. The UBL domains are recognized by the 19S proteasome caps and the UBA domains bind ubiquitin via three-helix bundles. These receptor proteins may escort polyubiquitinated proteins to the proteasome, though the specifics of this interaction and its regulation are unclear.|$|E
5|$|Although {{it is not}} <b>fully</b> <b>understood</b> how it came to his attention, Rochdale Town Hall was {{admired by}} Adolf Hitler. It has been {{suggested}} a visit by Hitler in 1912–13 while staying with his half-brother Alois Hitler, Jr. in Liverpool, or military intelligence on Rochdale, or information from Nazi sympathiser William Joyce (who had lived in Oldham), brought the building to his attention. Hitler admired the architecture {{so much that it}} is believed he wished to ship the building, brick-by-brick, to Nazi Germany had German-occupied Europe encompassed the United Kingdom. Rochdale was broadly avoided by German bombers during the Second World War.|$|E
