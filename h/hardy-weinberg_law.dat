40|$|Restriction {{fragment}} length polymorphism (RFLP) of the L-myc gene {{was examined}} in DNAs from primary tumour tissues and peripheral blood cells (PBC) of 76 Indian patients with {{squamous cell carcinoma}} of the oral cavity, and PBC from 101 normal healthy volunteers. The patients and the normal healthy volunteers were classified into three genetic types according to the polymorphic patterns defined by the two alleles (6. 6 kb, S fragment; and 10. 0 kb, L fragment). DNA isolated from the PBC of each patient always exhibited {{the same pattern of}} L-myc alleles as that observed for the corresponding tumour DNA. However, a striking correlation was found between the RFLP pattern and the stage of differentiation of the tumours, as well as the size of the tumour. Thus, a preponderance of the S fragment was observed in the poor to moderately differentiated tumours and the larger (greater than 4 cm) sized tumours. Further, analysis of L-myc RFLP with the clinical pattern of the malignancy showed no significant correlation with nodal metastasis, TNM staging or recurrence of the tumour. The relative ratios of the three genotypes (L-L, L-S, S-S) in the oral cancer patients were not significantly different from those seen in the healthy Indians, implying no predisposition to oral cancer by either allele. However, our results showed that oral cancer patients with a genotype including an S fragment are more likely to develop a poor to moderately differentiated tumour or a larger tumour than a patient without an S fragment. The L and S alleles were equally distributed in the population, with the frequency of each allele being 0. 50, consistent with <b>Hardy-Weinberg's</b> <b>law...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Centronuclear {{myopathy}} (CNM) is an {{autosomal recessive}} hereditary disease affecting Labrador Retriever dogs. The disease {{is characterized by}} muscle lesions, typically encompassing {{reduction in the number}} and atrophy of type II fibers, and is caused by a short interspersed repeat element insertion in exon 2 of the protein tyrosine phosphatase-like member A. The actual allele frequency is unknown; a study was undertaken to ascertain it using a convenience-sample population composed of 217 Labrador Retrievers. In addition to 3 subjects already diagnosed with CNM, used as positive controls for polymerase chain reaction, only 2 unrelated dogs were heterozygous wild-type/mutation (wild-type/mut). Thus, the frequency of the CNM allele observed {{in the present study was}} 1. 8 % and 0. 47 % when including and excluding the 3 mut/ mut homozygous cases, respectively. Based on the Hardy–Weinberg exact test (P 5 1. 00), the genotype frequency without the CNM-affected dogs was in agreement with the Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium. Assuming the <b>Hardy–Weinberg</b> equilibrium <b>law,</b> the expected frequency of the homozygous mutated genotype was calculated to be approximately 0. 00005, which corresponds to 1 case of CNM out of 20, 000 dogs. In conclusion, the present study indicates that the CNM allele is present but rare in a convenience sample o...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: There is much {{evidence}} involving the KIT tyrosine kinase receptor and its ligand KITLG in the survival and proliferation of germ cells. Animal models and functional studies in humans {{suggest that this}} signalling pathway {{plays a role in}} male infertility. METHODS: We studied three and two single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (rs 3819392, rs 3134885, rs 2237012, rs 10506957 and rs 995030) located within the genomic region of the KIT and KITLG genes, respectively. A total of 167 idiopathic infertile men (sperm counts < 5 million spz/ml) and 465 unre-lated healthy controls from the same geographical region were genotyped for these SNPs. RESULTS: We found a sta-tistically significant association of the rs 3819392 polymorphism, which is located within the KIT gene, with idiopathic male infertility. In addition, a deviation from the <b>Hardy–Weinberg</b> equilibrium (HWE) <b>law</b> was observed for rs 10506957 polymorphism within the KITLG gene only in the infertile group.

The study {{was designed as a}} population-based genetic association study, which involved 153 men and 596 women aged 65 – 101  years, who had been followed for 2. 2  years (range 0. 1 – 5. 5) between 1999 and 2006. During the follow-up period, the incidence of fragility fractures was ascertained. Bone ultrasound attenuation (BUA) was measured in all individuals, as were serum 25 -hydroxyvitamin D and PTH concentrations; 86 % subjects had vitamin D insufficiency. Genotypes were determined for the – 1260 C>A (rs 10877012) and + 2838 T>C (rs 4646536) CYP 27 B 1 polymorphisms. A reporter gene assay was used to assess functional expression of the – 1260 C>A CYP 27 B 1 variants. The association between genotypes and fracture risk was analyzed by Cox’s proportional hazards model. We found that genotypic distribution of CYP 27 B 1 – 1260 and CYP 27 B 1  + 2838 polymorphisms was consistent with the <b>Hardy-Weinberg</b> equilibrium <b>law.</b> The two polymorphisms were in high linkage disequilibrium, with D′ =  0. 96 and r 2  =  0. 94.

The TaqMan probe method was used to determine the genotypes (G/C) of miRNA- 146 a rs 2910164. The frequency of each genotype was compared between the two groups to {{investigate the}} association between the SNP of MicroRNA- 146 a and recurrence after liver cancer surgery. The independent-samples t test was used for comparison of continuous data between the two groups, the chi-square test was used for comparison of categorical data between the two groups, and multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to determine the factors associated with the recurrence of liver cancer. ResultsThe three genotypes of miRNA- 146 a G/C in non-recurrence group conformed to the <b>Hardy-Weinberg</b> equilibrium <b>law</b> (P＞ 0. 05). After the surgery for liver cancer, the frequency of miRNA- 146 a G/C genotype showed a significant difference between the recurrence group and the non-recurrence group (χ 2 = 9. 115, P= 0. 010), and compared with the non-recurrence group, the recurrence group had a significantly higher frequency of miRNA- 146 a (rs 2910164) CG genotype (χ 2 = 4. 013, P= 0. 039) and a significantly lower frequency of GG genotype (χ 2 = 9. 046, P= 0. 003). The multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that tumor diameter (OR= 1. 075, P= 0. 003 9) and miRNA- 146 a (rs 2910164) CG genotype (OR= 6. 215, P= 0. 001 4) were the risk factors for recurrence after the surgery for liver cancer, and that miRNA 146 a(rs 2910164) GG genotype was the protective factor against recurrence after the surgery for liver cancer (OR = 0. 382, P= 0  002 5).

40|$|Releases {{of foreign}} {{specimens}} to wild populations is deteriorating genetic integrity of native populations. Identifying whether {{the origin of}} the individuals in wild populations is native or not, is crucial to improve protection and conservation management strategies. Brown trout (Salmo trutta) is suffering such releases. In this species, it is possible to know the genetic makeup of each individual and estimate the population levels of introgression caused by genetically differentiated foreign fish. Genetic studies allow to identify and to distinguish the different genotypes, the population level of genetic diversity (alleles range and present genotypes) and patterns of distribution of genetic variability among populations. In a large population, where there is random mating and no mutation, neither migration nor selection, allele and genotype frequencies become stable in one generation. This is called the <b>Hardy-Weinberg</b> equilibrium <b>law,</b> which is a crucial genetic model for the conservation of the population diversity and the genetic study of natural populations. By using genotype information at 5 microsatellite loci and at the LDH-C 1 locus, the present study characterized the brown trout (Salmo trutta) population in {{the upper reaches of the}} Ter River. The level of genetic introgression (caused by releases of trout cultivated at the Bagà hatchery) was estimated. The Bagà hatchery stock is used to reinforce wild populations in Catalonian Rivers. Furthermore, we also studied the genetic differentiation of the Ter River brown trout in relation to another population from the Freser River headwaters (the Núria stream), the most important Ter River tributary. Results showed that there is only a single brown trout population at the studied Ter River location. This population did not present any genetic introgression. In relation to the Freser and Bagà fish, it was concluded that there is a significant genetic differentiation between the different studied trout collections. Thus, results showed three clearly differentiated populations: Ter, Núria and Bagà. In spite of this, some individuals from Freser River have genetic traces from the other populations. This finding indicated that the analysed trout population in the Freser River was affected by released Bagà trout, and, on the other hand, that there is natural contact between Ter and Freser brown trout population...|$|R

In an attempt to establish whether {{this is the case}} for Hysterothylacium fabri, which is present in many Mediterranean fish species, we studied its genetic diversity and analysed its population structure. To do this, we used 266 fourth stage larvae of H. fabri collected from three different host species and used two different methods for characterising genetic variability: isoenzyme electrophoresis and RAPD. The four isoenzyme loci studied are polymorphic, with five or six alleles at each. Significant differences in the deviations from the <b>Hardy-Weinberg</b> <b>law</b> were detected, especially at the PGM locus. A total of 92. 1 % of the markers revealed by the RAPD technique were polymorphic, demonstrating a great diversity. The UPGMA dendrogram revealed the {{existence of}} four genetic groups.

Despite its complexity, in a certain range, the model is stable, presenting a rich variety of behavior.

40|$|A novel test {{of spatial}} {{independence}} {{of the distribution of}} crystals or phases in rocks based on compositional statistics is introduced. It improves and generalizes the common joins-count statistics known from map analysis in geographic information systems. Assigning phases independently to objects in RD is modelled by a single-trial multinomial random function Z(x), where the probabilities of phases add to one and are explicitly modelled as compositions in the K-part simplex SK. Thus, apparent inconsistencies of the tests based on the conventional joins{count statistics and their possibly contradictory interpretations are avoided. In practical applications we assume that the probabilities of phases do not depend on the location but are identical everywhere in the domain of de nition. Thus, the model involves the sum of r independent identical multinomial distributed 1 -trial random variables which is an r-trial multinomial distributed random variable. The probabilities of the distribution of the r counts can be considered as a composition in the Q-part simplex SQ. They span the so called Hardy-Weinberg manifold H that is proved to be a K- 1 -affine subspace of SQ. This is a generalisation of the well-known <b>Hardy-Weinberg</b> <b>law</b> of genetics. If the assignment of phases accounts for some kind of spatial dependence, then the r-trial probabilities do not remain on H. This suggests the use of the Aitchison distance between observed probabilities to H to test dependence. Moreover, when there is a spatial uctuation of the multinomial probabilities, the observed r-trial probabilities move on H. This shift can be used as to check for these uctuations. A practical procedure and an algorithm to perform the test have been developed. Some cases applied to simulated and real data are presented.

In the first (section 2) we assume that the distribution of (X,Y) is unspecified but the pairs of observations (x i,y i) i= 1, [...] . ...|$|E
40|$|Genotypes CD 14 gene genotypes {{frequencies}} of in control group and in {{group of patients}} with nosocomial pneumonia (NP) correspond to <b>Hardy-Weinberg</b> <b>law.</b> We revealed a statistically significant increase of genotype Т/Т frequency in the patients with NP (33. 33 %) in contrast to control group (18. 09 %) (р = 0. 008). Notable is a difference in severity of NP cours in the patients with C/С, C/Т and Т/Т genotypes. In first case, the score of discase severity, using CPIS scale, was 7. 81 ± 1. 32, whereas in second case it was 8. 93 ± 1. 48 (р < 0. 05). A positive correlation was found between resolution time of NP and CD 14 genotype, i. e. Т/Т genotype was associated with prolonged respiratory support in NP with mecanical ventilation, as compared with NP cases in the patlents with C/С and C/Т genotypes (r = 0. 70; р = 0. 01). It was shown that the patients with CD 14 Т/Т genotype exhibited hypercytokinemia due to TNFα. IL- 1 β and IL- 1 RN, thus pointing to a key role of CD 14 gene polymorphism in immune pathogenesis of NP. </span...|$|E
40|$|Five highly {{variable}} microsatellite loci {{were used to}} investigate the genetic diversity and population structure of the noble scallop Chlamys nobilis, in the South China Sea. A total of 200 individual scallops from 4 populations were genotyped. All of the 5 microsatellite loci screened in this study showed polymorphism. A total of 32 different alleles were observed over all loci. The number of alleles per locus ranged from 3 to 12. The average allelic number of these polymorphic markers was 6. 4. The averages of observed (H-o) and expected heterozygosity (H-e) ranged from 0. 07 to 032 and from 0. 119 to 0. 459, respectively. A highly significant deviation from the <b>Hardy-Weinberg</b> <b>Law,</b> owing primarily to heterozygote deficiency, was found in all populations studied. The Nanao population exhibited more genetic diversity than the other three populations in terms of allele richness and observed and expected heterozygosity. (c) 2012 Elsevier B. V.
