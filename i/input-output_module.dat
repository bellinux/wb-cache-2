40|$|Abstract — In {{this paper}} we present an {{automated}} task planning methodology to automatically compose multi-robot motion tasks. A motion task {{is defined as}} an <b>input-output</b> <b>module.</b> Primitive motion tasks represented as modules (called primitive modules) are defined based on Linear Temporal Logic specifications. The task planning is then considered as a composition over compatible primitive modules {{in such a way}} that the inverted motion task module and the primitive modules form a closed chain. The problem is posed as an integer programming problem and is reduced to the combinatorial optimization problem of shortest dipath which can be solved in polynomial time. The basic safety and liveness specifications of the primitive task controllers are inherited by the resulting composed system and the requested task specifications are satisfied by construction, ensuring a correct design. The effectiveness of the proposed methodology is shown through computer simulation. I...|$|E
40|$|INFORGE is a German interindustry {{forecasting}} model, that {{is based}} on the INFORUM philosophy. It has been used {{in a wide range of}} applications in the last years and is updated annually. The structure of the model is explained in detail. It contains an <b>input-output</b> <b>module,</b> an SNA and financial module and depicts the labour market in great detail. As almost all variables are endogenous to the model, only a few policy variables have to be set exogenously. Probable assumptions for the next years are discussed, that form a base scenario. Results of the base simulation until 2015 show, that Germany will reach again historical annual growth rates of GDP of about 2 % after overcoming the current crisis. Trade will grow much faster throughout the simulation period. Public consumption is restricted due to the European stability pact. Construction will not recover, as population forecasts show a decline after 2010. Problems on the labour market diminish in the long run because of demographic change. Employment in manufacturing, agriculture and mining will decline in favour of services. But simulation results show that this shift is not caused by changes in the structure of production but due to higher productivity growth in manufacturing. In contrast to other countries, German manufacturers will keep their share in production...|$|E
40|$|Oil and gas {{produced}} from active deepwater leases (over 1000 feet water depth) in the Gulf of Mexico {{as a percentage}} of total output increased from 27 % in 1992 to 54 % in 2005. This increase is requiring more land-based services. Port Fourchon's strategic location provides it with a competitive advantage as a supply base for a diverse set of deepwater oil and gas related activities, ranging from petroleum rig supply boats to the maintenance and repair of mobile drilling rigs. Further development of Port Fourchon as a supply base is expected to markedly impact Lafourche Parish. Community impact models (CIM) quantify the linkages among local economic activity and the demand for, and ability to support, local government services. A CIM developed for Louisiana, including an <b>input-output</b> <b>module</b> of the local economy, is used to evaluate the impact of the deepwater energy industry on the economy and government finances of Lafourche Parish. According to model results, the deepwater energy industry will continue to {{have a significant impact on}} that economy. By 2010, the industry was predicted to be directly and indirectly responsible for 2593 new jobs and $ 571 million in total output. Such activity should not strain the ability of local governments to deliver services. ...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{introduction}} of Ethernet and Internet technologies in the fieldbuses of automation systems widely facilitates vertical integration. Control functions can coexist more easily with higher level {{functions such as}} supervision, production reporting or maintenance. But what does the response time of the control function become when architecture components – e. g. controllers, remote <b>input-output</b> <b>modules</b> or fieldbuses – are requested in parallel by other functions' In this paper, we focus on switched Ethernet-based fieldbuses usingModbus TCP/IP. The evaluation {{of the impact of}} vertical integration on the response time of control functions is obtained from a series of measurements on a real system. A great number of response times were measured with a specific automated equipment that we developed. Three types of load on the control architecture are studied: traffic on fieldbuses, requests on controllers and requests on remote <b>input-output</b> <b>modules.</b> The analysis of the measurement results shows which level of vertical integration can be reasonably allowed, taking into account the required response times...|$|R

40|$|Laser {{beam welding}} {{applications}} {{are widely used}} in the industry. However, laser beam welding applications have a very small position tolerance to an offset. In this project, the offset {{is defined as the}} distance between the point, which the laser tool welds, and the point which laser tool should weld the weld joint. In other words, the offset is the position error in a welding application. To perform successful welding, the laser beam must hit the exact coordinate of the weld joints to weld the parts together. For dealing with these inaccuracy issues, tool manipulation systems can be used. In this project, an external axis is used for the precise manipulation of the laser beam welding tool as a complement to robotic nominal movement. Input data to the external axis system is obtained from an image from a vision system of the work pieces which need to be welded. Tool manipulation systems are used to manipulate tools to ensure certain position accuracy during any application. The tool manipulation system in this project has two main parts; a seam tracking system (outside this project) and an external axis system. The seam tracking system gives an on-line measurement of the offset, {{and that there is a}} feedback loop with a controller, which gives the system information about how much to manipulate the external axis module to the external axis system. The seam tracking system consists of two main parts; a camera and the seam tracking image processing program. In the seam tracking system, a camera takes images of the work pieces which shall be welded. Then the seam tracking program calculates the offset by image processing. This estimated offset is the input for the external axis system. The external axis system has three main parts; the external axis program, <b>input-output</b> <b>module</b> and the external axis module. The external axis program is the system which controls the <b>input-output</b> <b>module</b> for manipulating the external axis module in this project. The external axis module manipulates the laser beam welding tool by changing the orientation of the tool in order to reduce the offset. This project is about the external axis system. There is a relationship between the offset input and the required manipulation angle of the external axis. In this project, the required manipulation angle is the external axis angle. By using this relationship, the laser beam welding tool can be manipulated to weld in the desired position. The same system can be used in applications which require high position accuracy. The evaluation of the external axis system emphasizes that the accuracy demand of the laser beam welding applications can be satisfied by an external axis system. However, the investigated external axis system behaves in a way that when the offset is larger than it supposed to be, the speed of the TCP movement slows down...|$|E
40|$|Aer, the Escherichia coli aerotaxis receptor, {{faces the}} cytoplasm, where the PAS (Per-ARNT-Sim) -flavin adenine {{dinucleotide}} (FAD) domain senses redox {{changes in the}} electron transport system or cytoplasm. PAS-FAD interacts with a HAMP (histidine kinase, adenylyl cyclase, methyl-accepting protein, and phosphatase) domain to form an <b>input-output</b> <b>module</b> for Aer signaling. In this study, {{the structure of the}} Aer HAMP and proximal signaling domains was probed to elucidate structure-function relationships important for signaling. Aer residues 210 to 290 were individually replaced with cysteine and then cross-linked in vivo. The results confirmed that the Aer HAMP domain is composed of two α-helices separated by a structured loop. The proximal signaling domain consisted of two α-helices separated by a short undetermined structure. The Af 1503 HAMP domain from Archaeoglobus fulgidus was recently shown to be a four-helix bundle. To test whether the Af 1503 HAMP domain is a prototype for the Aer HAMP domain, the latter was modeled using coordinates from Af 1503. Several findings supported the hypothesis that Aer has a four-helix HAMP structure: (i) cross-linking independently identified the same residues at the dimer interface that were predicted by the model, (ii) the rate of cross-linking for residue pairs was inversely proportional to the β-carbon distances measured on the model, and (iii) clockwise lesions that were not contiguous in the linear Aer sequence were clustered in one region in the folded HAMP model, defining a potential site of PAS-HAMP interaction during signaling. In silico modeling of mutant Aer proteins indicated that the four-helix HAMP structure was important for Aer stability or maturation. The significance of the HAMP and proximal signaling domain structure for signal transduction is discussed...|$|E

40|$|Algorithms were {{developed}} to control humidity in plant growth chambers used for research on bioregenerative life support at Kennedy Space Center. The algorithms used the computed water vapor pressure (based on measured air temperature and relative humidity) as the process variable, with time-proportioned outputs to operate the humidifier and de-humidifier. Algorithms were based upon proportional-integral-differential (PID) and Fuzzy Logic schemes and were implemented using I/O Control software (OPTO- 22) to define and download the control logic to an autonomous programmable logic controller (PLC, ultimate ethernet brain and assorted <b>input-output</b> <b>modules,</b> OPTO- 22), which performed the monitoring and control logic processing, as well the physical control of the devices that effected the targeted environment in the chamber. During limited testing, the PLC's successfully implemented the intended control schemes and attained a control resolution for humidity of less than 1 %. The algorithms have potential to be used not only with autonomous PLC's but could also be implemented within network-based supervisory control programs. This report documents unique control features that were implemented within the OPTO- 22 framework and makes recommendations regarding future uses of the hardware and software for biological research by NASA...|$|R
40|$|Standard {{accounts}} of vision implicitly {{assume that the}} purpose of the visual system is to construct some sort of internal model of the world outside [...] a kind of simulacrum of the real thing, which can then serve as the perceptual foundation for all visually derived thought and action. The association of rich and distinctive conscious experiences with most of our perceptions gives credence to the idea that they must constitute a vital and necessary prerequisite for all of our visually-based behavior. But even though the perceptual representation of objects and events in the world is an important function of vision, it should not be forgotten that vision evolved in the first place, not to provide perception of the world per se, but to provide distal sensory control of the many different movements that organisms make. Many of the visual control systems for the different motor outputs evolved as relatively independent <b>input-output</b> <b>modules.</b> Thus, the different patterns of behavior exhibited by vertebrates, from catching prey to avoiding obstacles, can be shown to depend on independent pathways from the visual receptors through to the motor nuclei, each pathway processing a particular constellation of inputs and each evoking a particular combination of effector outputs...|$|R

40|$|Bandwidth-hungry {{applications}} such as Cloud computing, video sharing and social networking drive the creation of more powerful Data Centers (DCs) to manage {{the large amount of}} packetized traffic. Data center network (DCN) topologies rely on thousands of servers that exchange data via the switching backbone. Cluster switches and routers are employed to provide interconnectivity between elements of the same DC and inter DCs and must be able to handle the continuously variable loads. Hence, robust and scalable switching modules are needed. Conventional DCN switches adopt crossbars or/and blocks of memories in multistage interconnection architectures (commonly 2 -Tiers or 3 -Tiers). However, current multistage packet switch architectures, with their space-memory variants, are either too complex to implement, have poor performance, or not cost effective. In this paper, we propose a novel and highly scalable multistage packet-switch design based on Networks-on-Chip (NoC) fabrics for DCNs. In particular, we describe a novel three-stage packet-switch fabric with a Round-Robin packets dispatching scheme where each central stage module is based on a Unidirectional NoC (UDN), instead of a conventional single hop crossbar fabric. The proposed design, referred to as Clos- UDN, overcomes all the shortcomings of conventional multistage architectures. In particular, as we shall demonstrate, the proposed Clos-UDN architecture: (i) Obviates the need for a complex and costly input modules, by means of few, yet simple, input FIFO queues. (ii) Avoids the need for a complex and synchronized scheduling process over a high number of <b>input-output</b> <b>modules</b> and/or port pairs. (iii) Provides speedup, load balancing and path-diversity thanks to a dynamic dispatching scheme as well as the NoC based fabric nature. Extensive simulation studies are conducted to compare the proposed Clos-UDN switch to conventional multistage switches. Simulation results show that the Clos-UDN outperforms conventional design under a wide range of input traffic scenarios, making it highly appealing for ultra-high capacity DC networks...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Since the {{pioneering}} work of Glickman on embedding an <b>input-output</b> (IO) <b>module</b> into an econometric framework, {{there has been}} a plethora of studies on combining an IO analysis with an econometric model in the literature. The popularity of the combined framework is due to its superior performance in economic forecasting and higher accuracy in impact analysis. There are a number of approaches through which an IO model is combined with an econometric model. This paper examines three approaches to combine IO analysis with econometric modelling, namely embedded, coupled, and linked. All three approaches are applied to the Illawarra economy in a series of ex-post forecasting experiments. Each approach is applied to a hypothetical scenario of sectoral reallocation of government expenditure, to investigate certain key sectors that provide more jobs per dollar of expenditure relative to the other sectors. The comparative forecasting performance and impact analysis accuracy of each approach is examined. Citation: Masouman, A. 2 ̆ 6 Harvie, C. (2014).
