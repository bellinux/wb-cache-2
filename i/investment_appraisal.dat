40|$|AbstractThe built {{environment}} must {{adapt to a}} rapidly changing context and, since buildings have relatively long lives, this must primarily be achieved through retrofitting the existing building stock rather than by replacing it. We therefore need robust approaches to evaluating the cost-effectiveness of retrofit investments. Some guidance for performing <b>investment</b> <b>appraisals</b> of building retrofit proposals is available for specific types of retrofit, for example, the economic evaluation procedure for energy systems in buildings {{in the form of}} the EN 15459 standard. In this preliminary study, three existing evaluation methods are reviewed and compared. On this basis, recommendations for the development of a robust, general approach to the financial and economic evaluation of building retrofits are made...|$|R
40|$|Does {{the world}} {{experience}} a secular decline in capital productivity? Due to the long-run downward trend in interest rates, some economists do think so. However, this reasoning equates capital productivity with interest, {{which is a}} critical assumption. This paper presents a new proxy {{that can be used}} to estimate capital productivity. It is based on weighted average cost of capital (WACC), which are employed by firms in their <b>investment</b> <b>appraisals</b> as a benchmark return. The paper uses an original WACC data set for many OECD countries and for the time period 2000 - 2015. Data are adjusted for tax distortions and expected inflation. The principle finding is that the data do not indicate a long-run decline in capital productivity...|$|R

40|$|We explore two {{approaches}} (cohort versus hazard) {{to measure the}} probability of investment rate migrations of pension funds in Australia. We also develop validation procedures pertinent to each approach and find that the cohort method is more stable in its forecasts and reports a lesser migration probability to lower investment grades with minimal statistical significance. Conversely, the hazard approach reports a higher migration probability to lower investment grades with statistical significance. This finding has considerable consequences for fund managers as they seek to mitigate any downward trends in their <b>investment</b> <b>appraisals,</b> especially as the cohort approach is the industry’s preferred approach in calculating rating migrations. The fund manager has a choice to make regarding measuring probability investment rate migrations, one between: stability (cohort) or accuracy (hazard) ...|$|R

Acceptable real returns to capital will be found only on relatively good quality sites. A major reduction in the rate of new planting is indicated and a shift away from poorer planting land. The rate and location of new planting will depend critically on farmland prices {{and the extent to which}} better-quality land is released for planting under the normal consultation procedures. ...|$|R

Primarily, there are two competing theories of frontier estimation, known as stochastic frontier estimation and data envelopment analysis (DEA). DEA enables the inclusion of many factors in the analysis in addition to the usual return and risk measures and therefore is widely used in empirical studies in finance. The DEA methodology and its application in the finance sector are discussed in detail. <b>Investment</b> performance <b>appraisal,</b> data envelopment analysis...|$|R

40|$|Use of the {{discounted}} {{cash flow}} (DCF) technique in <b>investment</b> and <b>appraisal</b> situations depends on readily available and reliable estimates of cost of capital and equity rates. Previous research on estimating equity rates and cost of capital from financial data sources is extremely limited and includes no evidence on the consistency of rates derived from alternative data sources. This paper derives estimates of equity rates and cost of capital from three alternative commonly available data sources. Estimates are derived separately for operating properties and for homebuilder/land developers on both a before- and after-corporate tax basis. The alternative data sources are found to yield consistent and reliable estimates of equity rates and cost of capital. Rates estimated from these sources are sufficiently accurate and reliable for most <b>investment</b> or <b>appraisal</b> applications.

5000|$|Following the [...] "merger" [...] with Leyland, the new company's board bore {{an uncanny}} {{resemblance}} to the senior management team that had hitherto headed up the Leyland half of the partnership, so comments of the management team on the profitability of the former BMC elements need to be viewed with caution. However, following a review of company records undertaken {{with the support of}} the new board, author Graham Turner stated that at the time of the merger, 16 versions of the Mini were being produced, yielding an average profit of just £16 per car, while every Morris Minor sold lost the group £9 and every Austin Westminster sold lost £17. This helps to explain why the Westminster and Minor were among the early casualties of the merger, as well as the introduction of the Mini Clubman, capable of being built for less, but sold for more than a standard Mini thanks to simplified ("modernised") front panels. Even the UK's best seller, the Austin/Morris 1100, had to be subjected to an emergency cost-reduction programme which removed about £10 from the cost of each car, applying changes that included the omission of lead sealing from body joints (£2.40 per car), removing provision for optional reversing lamps (£0.10) and [...] "changes in body finish" [...] (£0.75). Rebuilding the Cowley plant to include [...] "new automated body building facilities" [...] saved £2.00 in transport costs per car for bodies that no longer needed to be transported from the corporation's Swindon plant and in the longer term further transport costs were saved by concentrating assembly of the model at a single plant, rather than splitting it between plants at Cowley and Longbridge. Because of the high proportion of auto-production costs represented by fixed costs that needed to be allocated over a planned production volume, and the use in the 1960s of <b>investment</b> <b>appraisal</b> criteria that were ill-suited to accounting for volume fluctuations and the rapidly changing value of the UK currency in the 1960s, the precise figures quoted may be open to challenge, but the new management's diagnosis that BMC's profitability was insufficient to fund support and new model investment to cover its disparate range of brands and models was hard to refute.|$|E

This paper shows, on the one hand, how it changes the {{management}} criteria and, on the other hand, the limits to financialization in the property sector. Between 1992 and 2004, about 15 % of Swiss pension funds' wealth was invested in property. As far as their investment policy is concerned, pension funds have two choices. First, they can directly own, and have management responsibility for, the properties in their portfolios. Alternatively, they can buy shares in mainly Zurich-based investment vehicles.

40|$|In the past, most {{evaluations}} of the electric utility investments {{have been based on}} the assumptions that the suppliers of electricity would provide the quantity of energy demanded at an acceptable level of reliability. The question addressed in most of the <b>investment</b> <b>appraisals</b> has been: “is this investment the least cost way to supply the electricity demanded?” In real life the situation is usually very different in most countries. Shortages, outages and deterred demand have been the rule, rather than the exception. This study of a major rehabilitation program by Comision Federal de Electricidad (CFE) of Mexico (Mexico Public Electric Utility) presents a practical method of analysis for an investment to rehabilitate an existing electricity transmission system. First, the analysis is done in an integrated fashion where the financial, economic, distributive, and risk aspects of the project are examined together on a consistent basis. Second, the value of each of the components of the supply improvement, i. e. reduction in shortages, outages, transmission losses, is considered separately and then combined in the overall appraisal. Third, the risks imposed on these investments from such macro-economic variables as changes in the real exchange rate and the rate of inflation are modeled, based on real world data, and combined with the risks inherent in the project inputs, such as fuel and investment costs to make an assessment of the overall risks associated with the undertaking of these investments.
