25|$|Molecular phylogenies {{indicate}} {{the most recent}} common ancestor of all modern equids (members of the genus Equus) lived ~5.6 (3.9–7.8) mya. Direct paleogenomic sequencing of a 700,000-year-old middle Pleistocene horse metapodial bone from Canada implies a more recent 4.07 Myr before present date for the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) {{within the range of}} 4.0 to 4.5 Myr BP. The oldest divergencies are the Asian hemiones (subgenus E. (Asinus), including the <b>kulan,</b> onager, and kiang), followed by the African zebras (subgenera E. (Dolichohippus), and E. (Hippotigris)). All other modern forms including the domesticated horse (and many fossil Pliocene and Pleistocene forms) belong to the subgenus E. (Equus) which diverged ~4.8 (3.2–6.5) million years ago.|$|E
25|$|Back in the present, an {{encounter}} with <b>Kulan</b> Gath results in Pym being split into his two personas of Pym and Yellowjacket, after a spell cast by Gath temporarily transforms Pym into a swashbuckler-style Yellowjacket, followed by the Yellowjacket persona manifesting a physical presence from the extradimensional bio-mass Pym uses to grow. After the Giant-Man Pym spends some time appearing almost emotionally stunted, reciting facts with no sense of emotional depth even when facing the new threat of a supercharged Count Nefaria, the Yellowjacket Pym replaces him, only for his impulsive nature to making a situation worse when Diablo turns an entire village into variations of the Hulk, Yellowjacket's plan to stop the Hulks resulting in them merging into one massive Hulk before he can shrink {{it down to a}} more manageable level. The two versions begin to deteriorate from being apart, but are restored when the Wasp helps the two halves realize they need each other. Pym is eventually able to resolve his problems and adopts his Yellowjacket persona once again.|$|E
25|$|The {{striped hyena}} is {{primarily}} a scavenger which feeds mainly on ungulate carcasses in different stages of decomposition, fresh bones, cartilages, ligaments and bone marrow. It crushes long bones into fine particles and swallows them, though sometimes entire bones are eaten whole. The striped hyena is not a fussy eater, though it has an aversion to vulture flesh. It will occasionally attack and kill any animal it can overcome. It hunts prey by running it down, grabbing its flanks or groin and inflicting mortal wounds by tearing out the viscera. In Turkmenistan, the species is recorded to feed on wild boar, <b>kulan,</b> porcupines and tortoises. A seasonal abundance of oil willow fruits is an important food source in Uzbekistan and Tajikistan, while in the Caucasus, it is grasshoppers. In Israel, the striped hyena feeds on garbage, carrion and fruits. In eastern Jordan, its main sources of food are feral horse and water buffalo carcasses and village refuse. It {{has been suggested that}} only the large hyenas of the Middle East, Asia minor, central Asia and the Indian subcontinent attack large prey, with no evidence of their smaller Arabian and east African cousins doing so. Because of its scavenging diet, the striped hyena requires more water to survive than most other carnivores. When eating, the striped hyena gorges itself until satisfied, though hyenas with cubs will transport food to their dens. Because of the high content of calcium in its diet, the faeces of the striped hyena becomes white very rapidly, and can be visible from long distances.|$|E

50|$|The first {{reintroduction}} site of Turkmenian <b>kulans</b> in Kazakhstan was the Barsa-Kelmes Nature Reserve. Another 35 were reintroduced to the Aktau-Buzachinsky Sanctuary in 1991, {{which have}} grown to a {{population of more than}} 100 individuals on the Mangishlak Peninsula. Between 1986 and 1990, 105 Turmenian <b>kulans</b> were reintroduced to the Andasai Sancturary, and have since increased to 200.|$|R

500|$|As with Mariah Carey the {{previous}} year, Carey did not {{embark on a}} tour to promote the album, due to the long travel times and strenuous schedules on her voice. However, while not touring the world, Carey promoted Emotions through an array of television and award show appearances, stateside and across Europe. Carey performed [...] "Emotions" [...] live {{for the first time}} at the 1991 MTV Video Music Awards, backed by several male and female back up vocalists. Following the award show appearance, she sang [...] "Emotions" [...] on The Arsenio Hall Show, airing on September 23, 1991. Additionally, Carey performed the song at the 1992 Soul Train Music Awards, and on British music program and talk show Top of the Pops and Des O'Connor. Additional European stops included Sondagstoppet and <b>Kulan</b> in Sweden during mid-September 1991. All of the above-mentioned performances included [...] "Can't Let Go" [...] as a secondary performance in the night. [...] "Can't Let Go" [...] was sung on additional programs such as Saturday Night Live, a pre-filmed studio clip on The Today Show. While the album's final single [...] "Make It Happen" [...] was released only months after Emotions release, the song was not performed during the album's original chart run, however making its way onto the set-list of several of Carey following tours. On February 26, 1992, Carey performed [...] "If It's Over" [...] at the 34th annual Grammy Award, with a full orchestra and several back up singers.|$|E

40|$|Asiatic wild asses and Przewalski 2 ̆ 7 s horses {{initially}} inhabited steppe, semi-desert {{and desert}} areas, but Przewalski 2 ̆ 7 s horses became extinct in the wild, and <b>kulans</b> are {{under threat of}} disappearance. The Bukhara Breeding Centre (Uzbekistan) was created in 1976 for conservation and reintroduction of wild ungulate species. In 1977 - 1978, five <b>kulans</b> (two males and three females) from Barsa-Kelmes Island on the Aral lake {{were introduced to the}} reserve. The group increased to 25 - 30 animals in 1995 - 1998, when five Przewalski 2 ̆ 7 s horses from Moscow and St. Petersburg zoos were introduced to the same territory. We analyzed the home ranges, preferred habitats and social interactions of these closely related species during 1995 - 1999 by season and group composition. Horses and <b>kulans</b> each formed a reproductive group and a secondary bachelor group. The home range of the secondary group in both species was larger then that of the reproductive group and seemed to be less dependent on watering places. <b>Kulans</b> and Przewalski 2 ̆ 7 s horses demonstrated different strategies of habitat use. They can share one area without serious conflicts, avoiding competition by the temporal differentiation in the usage of key sites...|$|R
50|$|Many hooved mammals, like {{reticulated}} giraffes, Somali wild asses, Père David's deer, European and American bison, African buffalo, plains zebras and Turkmenian <b>kulans</b> live {{in large}} enclosures, which {{are embedded in}} the forested, hilly landscape.

50|$|Previously in 2005, the {{population}} was estimated at 1,295-1,345 in Turkmenistan. No other data existed {{on the condition of}} the Turkmenistan populations, but hope remained that small groups of animals still resided in inaccessible areas around Badkhyz, and were thriving in the West Kopetdagh (Sumbar-Chandyr Valley) and Ustyurt Plateau around Lake Sarakamish. However, certain fragmented populations of Transcaspian wild ass are currently on the rise to even more than 2,000 individuals in the wild. It is also estimated that over 6,000 <b>kulans</b> live in Central Asia.|$|R

50|$|The zoo has {{undergone}} two major reductions, {{the first in}} 1981-1985, {{as a result of}} sewage system and motorway feeder construction, which reduced the area of the zoo to one-third, destroying two-thirds of the original exposition area and causing animal relocation within the zoo. As a consequence, a modern enclosure with the largest collection of exotic birds in Czechoslovakia had to be demolished and the birds were sent to other zoos. In 1991, a tiger escaped during the night and was shot within the zoo area. No person was harmed in the incident. In 2002-2003, the new enclosure for Turkmenian <b>kulans,</b> Bactrian camels and Shetland pony was constructed in the forested part of the zoo and the building of a breeding facility for Heptner’s markhor and Barbary sheep had begun.|$|R
50|$|No {{information}} is available for home ranges of Caspian tigers. In search for prey, they possibly prowled widely and followed migratory ungulates from one pasture to another. Wild pigs and cervids probably formed their main prey base. In many regions of Central Asia, Bactrian deer and roe deer were important prey species, as well as Caucasian red deer, goitered gazelle in Iran; Eurasian golden jackals, jungle cats, locusts, and other small mammals in the lower Amu-Darya River area; saiga, wild horses, Persian onagers in Miankaleh peninsula; Turkmenian <b>kulans,</b> Mongolian wild asses, and mountain sheep in the Zhana-Darya and around the Aral Sea; Manchurian wapiti and moose {{in the area of}} Lake Baikal. They caught fish in flooded areas and irrigation channels. In winter, they frequently attacked dogs and livestock straying away from herds. They preferred drinking water from rivers, and drank from lakes in seasons when water was less brackish.|$|R
40|$|The {{history of}} the {{discovery}} and {{the exploration of the}} hemione populations (Equus hemionus PALLAS) from Central Asia (Mongolia, northwest China, northeast Tibet, Kazakhstan, and Russian Siberia) from the 13 th century to approximately 1950 are compiled with the aim to provide materials for a taxonomic and population genetic revision of the dziggetais. Data on their phenotypic differentiation, historical distribution status, and their husbandry history in European zoological gardens, are reviewed, as is the gradual emergence of concepts of how to identify and to classify these populations. Hemiones were an important historical case in the discussion of how to represent the geographical-genetic diversity contained in a large mammal species from a geographically continuous range by taxonomic nomenclature best. The numerous opinions published about this Formenkreis reflect various contemporary concepts of zoological systematics in different periods of its development. In particular the existence and the nature of (transitory?) contact populations between named taxa needs attention, in order to demonstrate the ability of the ternary nomenclature to represent such a Formenkreis. The historical evidence permits the inference of hypotheses for taxonomic and population genetic work. In recent historical times Transbaikalian Siberia has been visited seasonally by dziggetais from Mongolia. For this reason alone the subspecies Equus hemionus hemionus PALLAS, based on a type specimen from Dahuria, comprises the source herds of Gobi dziggetais from south Mongolia too. E. h. bedfordi MATSCHIE is a junior synonym of this same taxon. The genetic introgression of the Central Asian dziggetais from Dzungaria, southwest Siberia, and perhaps northwest Mongolia, by Middle Asian <b>kulans</b> (or the reverse introgression from the dziggetas into the <b>kulans)</b> is assumed, but it has been documented insufficiently. The name E. h. castaneus (LYDEKKER) had been based on the painting of a single zoo animal of doubtfully correct origin, and it cannot be employed until the mysteries around the identity of its type specimen have been clarified. A few hints concerning the possible contact and the (historical) exchange between dziggetai and kiang populations need attention and verification. The identity of a few historically important specimens in zoological gardens and museums could be clarified...|$|R
60|$|For {{a moment}} <b>Kulan</b> Tith was silent. I could see by the {{expression}} of his face that he was sore perplexed. Then he spoke.|$|E

60|$|Thuvan Dihn turned upon <b>Kulan</b> Tith. Rage flamed in his keen eyes; {{but by the}} masterfulness of his {{self-control}} he {{kept his}} tones level as he spoke.|$|E
60|$|Surrounded by guardsmen I marched {{back along}} the {{corridors}} of the palace of <b>Kulan</b> Tith, Jeddak of Kaol, to the great audience chamber {{in the center of}} the massive structure.|$|E
60|$|As I {{turned toward}} {{them it was}} with {{difficulty}} that I controlled my features, for there, listening to <b>Kulan</b> Tith's eulogistic words concerning me, stood my arch-enemies, Matai Shang and Thurid.|$|E
