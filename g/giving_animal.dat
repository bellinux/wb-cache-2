Evidence of personal piety is scant before the New Kingdom. Votive offerings and personal names, {{many of which are}} theophoric, suggest that commoners felt some connection between themselves and their gods. But firm evidence of devotion to deities became visible only in the New Kingdom, reaching a peak late in that era. Scholars disagree about the meaning of this change—whether direct interaction with the gods was a new development or an outgrowth of older traditions. Egyptians now expressed their devotion through a new variety of activities in and around temples. They recorded their prayers and their thanks for divine help on stelae. They gave offerings of figurines that represented the gods they were praying to, or that symbolized the result they desired; thus a relief image of Hathor and a statuette of a woman could both represent a prayer for fertility. Occasionally, a person took a particular god as a patron, dedicating his or her property or labor to the god's cult. These practices continued into the latest periods of Egyptian history. These later eras saw more religious innovations, including the practice of <b>giving</b> <b>animal</b> mummies as offerings to deities depicted in animal form, such as the cat mummies given to the feline goddess Bastet.

From the enormous responses and enthusiasm of the Taro cattle’s breeders, it can be concluded that the activity came into satisfying result. Since the taro cattles are an asset in Bali, in the future the similar activities should be done regularly.

40|$|Meloxicam is a non-steroidal anti {{inflammatory}} drug (NSAIDs). It {{has been}} reported as a safe substitute of diclofenac sodium which has been banned for veterinary use in Pakistan, Nepal and India due to its relay toxicity associated with the catastrophic and unprecedented decline in vulture population during last 17 years. Diclofenac was very cheap and commonly used drug and it was highly toxic when dose of 0. 8 mg /kg was administered directly to the vulture in captivity. Although diclofenac is now regarded as a devastating environmental toxicant in recent times, {{but it is still}} used in veterinary practice. Meloxicam was safe for vultures up to the dose of 2 mg/Kg which is more than its likely maximum level of exposure (MLE) to wild vultures. Marked inter-species differences in the pharmacokinetics (PK) of NSAIDs had been reported and pharmacokinetic data could not be extrapolated from one species to another. However, consequent upon to relentless International pressures for elimination of diclofenac sodium from veterinary practice, the governments in the subcontinent are freely registering meloxicam for veterinary use without giving any due consideration to species specific PK-data. Manufacturers are selling veterinary injections of meloxicam without <b>giving</b> <b>animal</b> specific dosage. There is need to study pharmacokinetics of meloxicam in the domestic target species under local conditions, to enable its rational clinical use...|$|E
40|$|The song {{is about}} riɔ ̈ŋ (spearing) a cow or bull {{as a part}} of an {{offering}} to spirits and for people to eat.

This song of Machok Maper is also a type of age set-song a gentleman tries to boost of his age-hood and how he is loved by women due to his fine and funny ways of talking that attract women as girls of his age. In this song the singer mentions his ancestors spirit calls Atëm in form of snake who helped Dinka people cross the River Nile long time ago to the western part to Greater Bahr El Ghazal at Bahr Giraffe north of Bor town in Jongulei State. In this song, the singer points the importance of the son of a sister and for a person without a son of a sister is like a tree with less branches birds sit on it and it goes wither quickly. Singer mentions Nuer, a neighbouring tribe to Dinka who are farmers and produce durra `a type of sorghum´ and who wear barks of trees (this indicates the song must have been composed a long time back because you cannot find Nuer people wearing barks of trees this days) as their clothes. He sings negatively towards a strange greedy person in a strange place during their trip to strange where the singer and his companion were shared boiled durra and this stranger could take four times into his jaws more than the other two could do. Being gluttonous without shame in Dinka could become an issue of composing a song against you. It is a bad behaviour. The song has two parts mixed up; one part is about a war song expressing courage of the singer´s clan, while the other one is about praising of the ancestors, clan who generous to offer and himself as a man who does not talk behind people. He speaks honestly in the eyes of people, being good or bad...|$|E
