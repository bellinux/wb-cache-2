5000|$|Dippel's oil had {{a number}} of uses which are now mostly obsolete. Its primary use was as an animal and insect repellent. It saw limited use as a {{chemical}} warfare <b>harassing</b> <b>agent</b> during the desert campaign of World War II. The oil was used to render wells undrinkable and thus deny their use to the enemy. By not being lethal, the oil was claimed to not be in breach of the Geneva Protocol.|$|E
50|$|In 1974, NCLC members {{admitted}} {{they had been}} <b>harassing</b> FBI <b>agents</b> for years.|$|R
50|$|There {{have been}} differing interpretations {{over whether the}} {{protocol}} covers the use of <b>harassing</b> <b>agents,</b> such as adamsite and tear gas, and defoliants and herbicides, such as Agent Orange, in warfare. The 1977 Environmental Modification Convention prohibits the military use of environmental modification techniques having widespread, long-lasting or severe effects. Many states do not regard this as a complete ban {{on the use of}} herbicides in warfare, but it does require case-by-case consideration. The 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention effectively banned riot control agents from being used as a method of warfare, though still permitting it for riot control.|$|R
5000|$|In 2000, Ross had {{his lawyer}} {{write a letter}} to the ATF {{claiming}} that their <b>agents</b> <b>harassed</b> him for writing his book, threatened vendors for selling his book and approached his [...] "amicably separated" [...] wife to elicit information against him.|$|R
5000|$|In 1939, Treasury Agents under Secretary Henry Morgenthau, Jr. started {{pursuing}} Carrollo. Carrollo {{responded by}} refusing any warrants and sending his gunmen to <b>harass</b> the <b>agents.</b> However, on October 20, 1939, Carrollo, Higgins, and Tom Pendergast {{were convicted of}} income tax evasion and sent to Leavenworth Federal Penitentiary in Leavenworth, Kansas. While at Leavenworth, Carrollo was discovered trafficking in contraband within the prison and was transferred to Alcatraz, the high security prison in San Francisco Bay.|$|R
25|$|One year later, {{under the}} National Legionary State (the Iron Guard's government), Marinescu and Argeşanu, {{alongside}} other politicians, were executed in Jilava (September 1940); {{it was also}} {{at that time that}} the Călinescu family crypt in Curtea de Argeş was dynamited, while a bronze bust of him which awaited unveiling was chained and dragged through the streets of Piteşti. Călinescu's wife Adela was required to hand all of her husband's personal documents, and, in a letter to Conducător Ion Antonescu, claimed to have been repeatedly <b>harassed</b> by <b>agents</b> of Siguranţa Statului.|$|R
5000|$|Opposition {{candidates}} criticised {{the election}} as having seen {{significant amounts of}} multiple voting and that security forces had <b>harassed</b> opposition <b>agents</b> at polling stations. They described the election as having been rigged and appealed to the Supreme Court to annul the results. However most international observers said that despite some shortcomings the election was mainly satisfactory. These included a group of former United States congressmen who called the election [...] "fair and transparent"; however, the International Federation of Human Rights Leagues dissented {{and said that the}} election had seen many irregularities.|$|R
50|$|FS (1942-1944): Sulfur {{trioxide}} and chlorosulfuric acid, a corrosive chemical {{mix that}} creates a heavy smoke when exposed. The main purpose was to act as screening smoke. It {{could also be used}} as a <b>harassing</b> or casualty <b>agent</b> if it was thrown inside an enclosed vehicle or structure, filling it with acrid, toxic smoke.|$|R
25|$|Vinea and Tzara met a {{final time}} when the latter came to Romania on an {{official}} visit, in 1947. That year, having resumed friendly contacts with the PNȚ, his work hosted by Nicolae Carandino at Dreptatea, Vinea narrowly escaped arrest during the Tămădău Affair clampdown. The full proclamation of a Romanian communist regime in 1948 drove Vinea into the cultural underground. For a while, he earned a meager living as a ghostwriter, {{but also as a}} warehouseman and porter. In 1949, sculptor Oscar Han briefly employed him as his plasterer. While working for the candlemaker Aliciu, alongside other disgraced wartime journalists, Vinea was periodically <b>harassed</b> by <b>agents</b> of the Securitate, who were reexamining his Evenimentul Zilei material.|$|R
50|$|Richard Buyer {{wrote that}} many {{witnesses}} whose statements {{pointed to a}} conspiracy were either ignored or intimidated by the Warren Commission. In JFK: The Last Dissenting Witness, a 1992 biography of Jean Hill, Bill Sloan wrote that Arlen Specter, assistant counsel for the Warren Commission, attempted to humiliate, discredit, and intimidate Hill into changing her story. Hill also told Sloan that she was abused by Secret Service <b>agents,</b> <b>harassed</b> by the FBI, and was the recipient of death threats.|$|R
50|$|<b>Harassed</b> by Securitate <b>agents</b> and {{prevented}} from publishing until the 1960s (during which interval {{he had to}} work in systematization), Henri H. Stahl was eventually allowed to join the editorial staffs of Biblioteca Historica Romaniae and Viitorul Social. He was by then lovingly married to the visual artist Margareta Stahl. His earlier affair with Maria Costin had produced a son, Paul H. Stahl; trained in sociology and art history, he escaped to France in 1969, to teach at the School for Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences. Henri was fully reinstated after the 1989 Revolution, and welcomed into the Romanian Academy shortly before his death, which occurred on September 9, 1991.|$|R
5000|$|Soon after, Joey {{is arrested}} and his {{computer}} is searched, but the Secret Service doesn't find anything, as Joey had hidden the disk containing the files. In response, Dade and Kate decide to settle their disagreements with a bet, with Dade choosing {{a date with}} Kate as his prize and Kate electing to have Dade perform menial computing tasks. The hacking duel focuses on <b>harassing</b> Secret Service <b>Agent</b> Richard Gill (Wendell Pierce), [...] "Hacker enemy number one", {{who was involved in}} Joey's arrest. After various pranks including canceling Gill's credit cards, creating a fake embarrassing personal ad in Gill's name, fabricating a criminal record, and changing his payroll status to [...] "deceased", the duel remains in a tie status.|$|R
500|$|In 1853, {{with the}} party {{increasingly}} divided over the slavery issue, Greeley printed an editorial disclaiming the paper's identity as Whig and declaring it to be nonpartisan. He was confident that the paper would not suffer financially, trusting in reader loyalty. Some in the party were not sorry to see him go: the Republic, a Whig organ, mocked Greeley and his beliefs: [...] "If a party is to be built up and maintained on Fourierism, Mesmerism, Maine Liquor laws, Spiritual Rappings, Kossuthism, Socialism, Abolitionism, and forty other isms, we have no disposition to mix with any such companions." [...] When in 1854, Illinois Senator Stephen Douglas introduced his Kansas-Nebraska Bill, allowing residents of each territory to decide {{whether it would be}} slave or free, Greeley strongly fought the legislation in his newspaper. [...] After it passed, and the Border War broke out in Kansas Territory, Greeley was part of efforts to send free-state settlers there, and to arm them. In return, proponents of slavery recognized Greeley and the Tribune as adversaries, stopping shipments of the paper to the South and <b>harassing</b> local <b>agents.</b> Nevertheless, by 1858, the Tribune reached 300,000 subscribers through the weekly edition, and it would continue as the foremost American newspaper through the years of the Civil War.|$|R
50|$|Following {{instructions}} from a mysterious individual named Dane, she travels to Los Angeles {{to give a}} lecture {{on the existence of}} vampires. Aware that vampires are in attendance when she speaks, she activates overhead ultraviolet lamps that incinerate several of the vampires in the audience, in front of the humans. She is quickly arrested and <b>harassed</b> by <b>Agent</b> Norris, who she learns is one of the human followers of the vampires, charged with keeping their activities covered up. After her release from custody, she returns to her hotel to find Paul (Rhys Coiro), Amber (Diora Baird) and Todd (Harold Perrineau), sent by Dane to recruit her to hunt the vampire queen, Lilith. As Lilith is responsible for the vampires' every move and for keeping them hidden, the hunters are convinced that once she is eliminated, the vampires will fall into dormancy. When Stella learns that Lilith was responsible for the slaughter at Barrow, she agrees to meet Dane (Ben Cotton), and is shocked to discover that he too is a vampire. Due to a superficially inflicted wound, he has maintained a grasp of humanity, only drinking blood from packaged hospital stocks he keeps. Stella hesitates to join a plan to attack a vampire nest, but Paul eventually convinces her, revealing that vampires were responsible for his daughter's death and the resulting divorce from his wife.|$|R
5000|$|Polone {{graduated}} from University of California, Berkeley in three years. He earned a realtor's license {{and applied to}} work for the Central Intelligence Agency. In 1985, he began work as an assistant at International Creative Management. He eventually became a literary agent at ICM. In 1989, ICM suspected that Polone planned to defect and fired him, though Polone says ICM was wrong about its suspicions. He joined Bauer-Benedek Agency, and the agency eventually merged with Leading Artists Agency to form United Talent Agency. Polone eventually became a partner at UTA. He was disappointed in how the agency was run and threatened to leave. In April 1996, UTA fired Polone and alleged that he sexually <b>harassed</b> a female <b>agent.</b> Polone hired Peter Ostroff to sue UTA in a breach of contract lawsuit, and before the lawsuit was filed, UTA gave Polone a $6 million severance package and made a public admission that [...] "'there were insufficient grounds' to fire him." [...] UTA sued Polone a year later for reneging on the severance contract, and another settlement took place. After departing from UTA, Polone launched his own management and production company and managed clients in both film and television. He eventually decided to become a film and television producer, and he dropped all of his clients except for Conan O'Brien. In 2007 and beyond, Polone became a pundit who appeared in media to comment on the 2007-2008 Writers Guild of America strike, Tiger Woods's infidelity scandal and fallout, and Michael Moore's association with Occupy Wall Street. He also writes an online column for New York Magazine.|$|R
6000|$|It {{was well}} Mr Bhaer {{had taken his}} wife into his strong arms, for she looked ready to drop, but bore up after a moment, and sitting by her good man, heard all that there was to tell. Tidings {{had been sent to}} the {{shipowners}} at Hamburg by some of the survivors, and telegraphed at once by Franz to his uncle. As one boat-load was safe, there was hope that others might also escape, though the gale had sent two to the bottom. A swift-sailing steamer had brought these scanty news, and happier ones might come at any hour; but kind Franz had not added that the sailors reported the captain's boat as undoubtedly wrecked by the falling mast, since the smoke hid its escape, and the gale soon drove all far asunder. But this sad rumour reached Plumfield in time; and deep was the mourning for the happyhearted Commodore, never to come singing home again. Mrs Jo refused to believe it, stoutly insisting that Emil would outlive any storm and yet turn up safe and gay. It was well she clung to this hopeful view, for poor Mr Bhaer was much afflicted by the loss of his boy, because his sister's sons had been his so long he scarcely knew a different love for his very own. Now was a chance for Mrs Juno to keep her word; and she did, speaking cheerily of Emil, even when hope waxed faint and her heart was heavy. If anything could comfort the Bhaers for the loss of one boy, {{it would have been the}} affection and sorrow shown by all the rest. Franz kept the cable busy with his varying messages, Nat sent loving letters from Leipzig, and Tom <b>harassed</b> the shipping <b>agents</b> for news. Even busy Jack wrote them with unusual warmth; Dolly and George came often, bearing the loveliest flowers and the daintiest bon-bons to cheer Mrs Bhaer and sweeten Josie's grief; while good-hearted Ned travelled all the way from Chicago to press their hands and say, with a tear in his eye: 'I was so anxious to hear all about the dear old boy, I couldn't keep away.' ...|$|R
