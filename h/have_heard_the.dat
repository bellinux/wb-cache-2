5|$|At {{the time}} of the attack, none aboard Centaur {{witnessed}} what had attacked the ship. Due to the ship's position, the distance from shore, and the depth, it was concluded that she was torpedoed by one of the Japanese submarines known to be operating off the Australian east coast. Several survivors later claimed to <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> attacking submarine moving on the surface while they were adrift, and the submarine was seen by the ship's cook, Francis Martin, who was floating alone on a hatch cover, out of sight from the main cluster of survivors. Martin described the submarine to Naval Intelligence following the survivors' return to land; his description matched the profile of a KD7 type Kaidai-class submarine of the Imperial Japanese Navy.|$|E

25|$|The Choir of Groton School, of Groton, Massachusetts, USA, {{has been}} {{presenting}} a Festival of Nine Lessons and Carols since 1928, {{ten years after}} the service was introduced at King's. Groton holds the distinction of having the oldest tenured Lessons and Carols service in the United States. The school's first organist and choirmaster, Twining Lynes, is believed to <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> service at King's, and shortly thereafter began the tradition with his choir at Groton. Since its inception, only seven organists have presided over the Groton service. Beginning in 2014, the choir has been conducted by Dan Moriarty.|$|E
25|$|Some zoologists hypothesise {{that some}} animal species have {{an ability to}} sense subsonic Rayleigh waves from an {{earthquake}} or a tsunami. If correct, monitoring their behaviour could provide advance warning of earthquakes, tsunami etc. However, the evidence is controversial and is not widely accepted. There are unsubstantiated claims about the Lisbon quake that some animals escaped to higher ground, while many other animals in the same areas drowned. The phenomenon was also noted by media sources in Sri Lanka in the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake. It is possible that certain animals (e.g., elephants) may <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> sounds of the tsunami as it approached the coast. The elephants' reaction was {{to move away from}} the approaching noise. By contrast, some humans went to the shore to investigate and many drowned as a result.|$|E
25|$|Satriani {{was born}} in Westbury, New York, the {{descendant}} of Italian immigrants. His paternal grandparents were from Piacenza and Bobbio, while his maternal grandparents were from Bari. He was inspired to play guitar at age 14, after hearing {{of the death of}} Jimi Hendrix. He has been said to <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> news during football practice, where he then announced to his coach that he was quitting to become a guitarist. In 1974, Satriani studied music with jazz guitarist Billy Bauer and with reclusive jazz pianist Lennie Tristano. The technically demanding Tristano greatly influenced Satriani's playing. Satriani began teaching guitar, with his most notable student at the time being fellow Long Island native Steve Vai (both also went to the same high school). While he was teaching Vai, he was attending Five Towns College for studies in music.|$|E

I believe that the church has helped me much during the short time I have been a member. I am not ashamed to be a Christian, and I am glad to know that the President of the United States is a Christian, for without the help of the Almighty I do not think he could rightly judge in ruling so many people. I have advised all of my people who are not Christians, to study that religion, because {{it seems to me the}} best religion in enabling one to live right.|$|E

500|$|The {{spirits of}} slaves are also said to haunt {{a portion of}} Independence Avenue SW, the site {{of two of the}} city's largest and most notorious slave markets. The Yellow House or Williams Slave Pen (at about 800 Independence Avenue SW, now the site of the {{headquarters}} of the Federal Aviation Administration) was the most notorious slave pen in the capital: A modest, well-maintained, two-story yellow house concealed a very large basement in which slaves were chained to walls in windowless rooms, while a [...] yard surrounded by a [...] high brick wall provided space for the training and selling of slaves. Another large slave market, the Robey Slave Pen, was just a block away at the corner of 7th Street SW and Independence Avenue SW. On dark nights, witnesses say they <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> clinking of chains and screams on Independence Avenue where these slave pens used to operate.|$|E
500|$|Starting on 8 December 1880 at Paardekraal, a farm to the {{south-west}} of Pretoria, 10,000 Boers congregated—the largest recorded {{meeting of}} white people in South Africa up to that time.

To help him in this he turned to Jorissen and Bok, who respectively became State Attorney and State Secretary, and Pretorius and Joubert, who the reconstituted volksraad elected to an executive triumvirate along with Kruger.
