5000|$|The common {{snapping}} turtle is not an ideal pet. Its neck is very flexible, and a wild turtle can bite its handler even if {{picked up by the}} sides of its shell. The claws are about as sharp as those of dogs, but cannot be trimmed as can <b>dog</b> <b>claws.</b> Despite this, a {{snapping turtle}} cannot use its claws for either attacking (its legs have no speed or strength in [...] "swiping" [...] motions) or eating (no opposable thumbs), but only as aids for digging and gripping. Veterinary care is best left to a reptile specialist.

40|$|Here {{we report}} on the structure, {{expression}} and function of a novel cartilage-specific gene coding for a 17 kDa small, highly charged and secreted protein that we termed Ucma (Unique Cartilage Matrix Associated protein). The protein is processed by a furin-like protease into an N-terminal peptide of 37 amino acids and a C-terminal fragment (Ucma-C) of 74 amino acids. Ucma is highly conserved between mouse, rat, human, <b>dog,</b> <b>clawed</b> frog, and zebrafish, but has no homology to other known proteins. Remarkable are 1 - 2 tyrosine sulphate residues per molecule and dense clusters of acidic and basic residues in the C-terminal part. In the developing mouse skeleton Ucma-mRNA is expressed in resting chondrocytes in the distal and peripheral zones of epiphyseal and vertebral cartilage. Ucma is secreted into the extracellular matrix as uncleaved precursor and shows the same restricted distribution pattern in cartilage as Ucma mRNA. In contrast, antibodies prepared against the processed C-terminal fragment located Ucma-C in the entire cartilage matrix, indicating that it either diffuses or is retained until chondrocytes reach hypertrophy. During differentiation of an MC 615 chondrocyte subclone in vitro, Ucma expression parallels largely the expression of collagen II, and decreases with maturation towards hypertrophic cells. Recombinant Ucma-C does not affect expression of chondrocyte-specific genes or proliferation of chondrocytes, but interferes with osteogenic differentiation of osteoblast precursors. These findings suggest that Ucma may be involved in the negative control of osteogenic differentiation of osteo-chondrogenic precursor cells in peripheral zones of fetal cartilage and at the cartilage-bone interface...|$|R

6000|$|It is not {{the less}} certain that, as {{knowledge}} and religion became more widely and brightly displayed over any country, the superstitious fancies of the people sunk gradually in esteem and influence; and {{in the time of}} Queen Elizabeth the unceasing labour of many and popular preachers, who declaimed against the [...] "splendid miracles" [...] of the Church of Rome, produced also its natural effect upon the other stock of superstitions.

Well, thanks be to God, this wretched and cowardly infidelity, since the preaching of the Gospel, is in part forgotten, and doubtless the rest of these illusions will in a short time, by God's grace, be detected and vanish away."[44] ...|$|R

5000|$|In {{the later}} 16th century, {{and into the}} first two decades of the 17th century, 25 people named in {{the records of the}} small parish of St. Botolph's in Aldgate are {{identified}} as [...] "blackamoors." [...] In the period of the war with Spain, between 1588 and 1604, there was {{an increase in the number}} of peoples arriving in England from Spanish colonial expeditions in parts of Africa. Many of these captives were freed from enslavement on Spanish ships. Their presence was largely a by-product of the slave trade. Slaver John Hawkins, for example, arrived with 300 captives from West Africa. 'Blackamoor' servants were seen as a fashionable novelty and popular in the homes of the wealthy. Among the captives was 'John Come-quick,a blackemore', servant to Capt Thomas Love. Others included in parish registers include Domingo [...] "a black neigro servaunt unto Sir William Winter, buried the xxviith daye of August 1587 and ‘Frauncis a Blackamoor servant to Thomas Parker’,  buried in January 1591. Most were employed as servants and entertainers to the wealthy. Some worked in ports, but were invariably described as chattel labour.The black population may have been several hundred. Racism intensified with the economic upward trajectory of the slave trade, which had become entrenched. Given the darker complexion of mulatto individuals, George Best argued in 1578 that black skin was not related to the heat of the sun but was instead caused by biblical damnation. Reginald Scot later associated black skin with witchcraft, describing (in his book Discoverie of Witchcraft) an unprepossessing devil in 1584 as having [...] "horns on his head, fire in his mouth, a tail, eyes like a bison, fangs like a <b>dog,</b> <b>claws</b> like a bear, a skin like a niger and a voice roaring like a lion". These views existed across British society, including among playwrights and royalty, and was exemplified by the fact that black slaves comprised some of the coach porters of King James VI of Scotland. In 1596, Queen Elizabeth I issued letters to the lord mayors of major cities asserting that [...] "of late divers blackmoores brought into this realm, of which kind of people there are already here to manie..." [...] Sir Thomas Sherley and Caspar Van Senden, a merchant of Lübeck, attempted to capitalise on this by petitioning Elizabeth I's Privy Council to allow them to transport slaves they had captured in Africa to Lisbon, presumably to sell them there. The relevant Privy Council Letters of July 1596 and a draft proclamation from the papers of Robert Cecil have been presented as an attempt to deport these captives from England. [...] However, Van Senden and Sherley's efforts were unsuccessful, as they themselves admitted in correspondence with Sir Robert Cecil.|$|R
40|$|In November 1999, {{two female}} lobsters, one with {{external}} egg batch, were {{captured in the}} common lobster fishery in the Oslo fjord, Norway and reported as possible American lobsters, Homarus americanus, to Bergen Aquarium and the Institute of Marine Research. More, but undersized specimens {{were said to be}} present in the fishery. After this six more American lobster has been captured on other part of the Norwegian coast, both escapees from people importing them illegally from abroad. Some were banded, or showed sign of recent banding. Closer inspection confirmed that the two individuals first registered showed a series of American characteristics, as a ventral tooth on the rostrums, longer and sharper teeth inside the <b>cutter</b> <b>claw</b> and the typical greenish-brown colour common in American lobsters. Tissue sample from additional four specimens were analysed by starch gel electrophoresis and all possessed new alleles, never reported in European lobster before, at several allozyme loci. These alleles correspond to common alleles in American lobsters as demonstrated in a reference sample. Origin and time of invasion of the American lobsters are suggested, as well as possible ecological interactions and influence on the original lobster population when invaded by this competitor...|$|R
40|$|Bilateral {{asymmetry}} of the paired claws of {{the lobster}} Homarus americanus is determined {{during the fourth}} and fifth juvenile stages by differential reflex activity; the side with the greater activity becomes the crusher while the contralateral side becomes the cutter. Juvenile lobsters reared during this critical period with a substratum that could not be grasped or with reduced input from predominantly internal mechanoreceptors (proprioceptors) (achieved by cutting the dactyl and its chordotonal organ or by tenotomizing the claw opener or closer muscles) failed to develop a crusher claw and hence remained bilaterally symmetrical: they developed paired <b>cutter</b> <b>claws.</b> Therefore, the proprioceptive component of the reflex activity is implicated in bringing about the initial lateralization of the claw ganglion into a crusher and a cutter side. Moreover, lobsters with a single claw reared without a substratum developed a crusher on the intact side only if the intact claw was exercised. In the unexercised condition, differences in reflex activity between the side with a claw and the side without one were insufficient {{for the development of a}} crusher claw on the intact side. A minimal amount of reflex activity is necessary for the development of a crusher. Lobsters reared with this minimal amount of activity in both claws developed asymmetrical claws rather than paired crusher claws. This means that initial lateralization of the claw ganglion into a crusher side, on a random basis, inhibited the opposite side from also becoming a crusher. This would explain why we failed to produce lobsters with paired crusher claws and why they were seldom found in the wild...|$|R
50|$|Coyotes {{typically}} {{bite the}} throat {{just behind the}} jaw and below the ear when attacking adult sheep or goats, with death commonly resulting from suffocation. Blood loss is usually a secondary cause of death. Calves and heavily fleeced sheep are killed by attacking the flanks or hindquarters, causing shock and blood loss. When attacking smaller prey, such as young lambs, the kill is made by biting the skull and spinal regions, causing massive tissue and bone damage. Small or young prey may be completely carried off, leaving only blood as evidence of a kill. Coyotes usually leave the hide {{and most of the}} skeleton of larger animals relatively intact, unless food is scarce, in which case they may leave only the largest bones. Scattered bits of wool, skin, and other parts are characteristic where coyotes feed extensively on larger carcasses.Tracks are an important factor in distinguishing coyote from dog predation.

40|$|Symmetrical lupoid onychodystrophy (SLO) is an immune-mediated {{disease in}} <b>dogs</b> {{affecting}} the <b>claws</b> with a suggested autoimmune aethiology. Sequence-based genotyping of the polymorphic exon 2 from DLA-DRB 1, -DQA 1, and -DQB 1 class II loci were {{performed in a}} total of 98 SLO Gordon setter cases and 98 healthy controls. A risk haplotype (DRB 1 * 01801 /DQA 1 * 00101 /DQB 1 * 00802) was present in 53 % of cases and 34 % of controls and conferred an elevated risk of developing SLO with an odds ratio (OR) of 2. 1. When dogs homozygous for the risk haplotype were compared to all dogs not carrying the haplotype the OR was 5. 4. However, a stronger protective haplotype (DRB 1 * 02001 /DQA 1 * 00401 /DQB 1 * 01303, OR = 0. 03, 1 /OR = 33) was present in 16. 8 % of controls, but only in a single case (0. 5 %). The effect of the protective haplotype was clearly stronger than the risk haplotype, since 11. 2 % of the controls were heterozygous for the risk and protective haplotypes, whereas this combination was absent from cases. When the dogs with the protective haplotype were excluded, an OR of 2. 5 was obtained when dogs homozygous for the risk haplotype were compared to those heterozygous for the risk haplotype, suggesting a co-dominant effect of the risk haplotype. In smaller sample sizes of the bearded collie and giant schnauzer breeds we found the same or similar haplotypes, sharing the same DQA 1 allele, over-represented among the cases suggesting that the risk is associated primarily with DLA-DQ. We obtained conclusive results that DLA class II is significantly associated with risk of developing SLO in Gordon setters, thus supporting that SLO is an immune-mediated disease. Further studies of SLO in dogs may provide important insight into immune privilege of the nail apparatus and also knowledge about a number of inflammatory disorders of the nail apparatus like lichen planus, psoriasis, alopecia areata and onycholysis...|$|R
40|$|Foi realizado experimento em laboratÃrio para observar a predaÃÃo do caranguejo mÃo-grossa Menippe nodifrons sobre trÃs espÃcies de moluscos gastrÃpodes: Stramonita haemastoma, Tegula viridula e Neritina virginea. Os aspectos observados foram de preferÃncia alimentar do caranguejo, tempo de manipulaÃÃo e manipulaÃÃo das presas, tamanho crÃtico da presa, e ainda, a anÃlise biomecÃnica das quelas dos caranguejos. Os caranguejos e os moluscos foram coletados na praia do Pacheco, localizada no municÃpio de Caucaia-Ce. Menippe nodifrons alimentou-se das trÃs espÃcies de gastrÃpodes, com uma maior preferÃncia alimentar por N. virginea (n = 62) em relaÃÃo aos outros moluscos oferecidos S. haemastoma (n = 41) e T. viridula (n = 35). A predaÃÃo pelos caranguejos foi maior sobre S. haemastoma, do que em T. viridula. Os machos predaram mais ativamente Neritina virginea, enquanto as fÃmeas nÃo tiveram preferÃncia por nenhuma das presas oferecidas, predando-as indistintamente. O tempo de manipulaÃÃo foi menor para N. virginea (44, 2 min.) do que para S. haemastoma (106, 1 min.) e T. viridula (120, 7 min.). Os moluscos foram manipulados atravÃs de duas tÃcnicas: esmagamento e descascamento. O esmagamento foi predominante em Neritina virginea, enquanto que o descascamento foi usualmente maior em Tegula viridula e Stramonita haemastoma. O tamanho crÃtico da presa foi menor para N. virginea (0, 34), seguida por S. haemastoma (0, 38) e T. viridula (0, 50) respectivamente. O caranguejo Menippe nodifrons apresentou vantagem mecÃnica para as duas quelas (Quela Maior = 0, 38) e (Quela menor = 0, 32), que os classificam como especialistas em quebrar conchas mais resistentes e duras. As quelas sÃo dimÃrficas e possuem dentiÃÃes diferentes, com atividades funcionais distintas para quebrar as conchas dos moluscos. O comportamento predatÃrio do caranguejo Menippe nodifrons estÃ diretamente relacionado ao nÃvel de especializaÃÃo de suas quelas, das caracterÃsticas morfolÃgicas e vulnerabilidade de suas presas. {{experiments}} {{were used to}} study {{the effect of the}} predation of the crab Menippe nodifrons on the gastropods Stramonita haemastoma, Tegula viridula and Neritina virginea. Aspects studied were prey preference, handling time, predation techniques, prey critical size and chelal biomechanic analysis of the crabs. The crabs and the clams were collected in Pacheco beach, located in the city of Caucaia-Ce. Menippe nodifrons preferred Neritina virginea over both Stramonita haemastoma and Tegula viridula, and Stramonita haemastoma was strongly preferred over Tegula viridula, possibly because of differences in shell characteristics among the three species. The male crabs preyed more heavily upon Neritina virginea than on both gastropods Stramonita haemastoma and Tegula viridula, while the females had eaten indistinctly the three clams. There were differences in hadling times between Neritina virginea, Stramonita haemastoma and Tegula viridula (handling times: N. virginea < S. haemastoma < T. viridula). Crabs attacked snails using crushing and peeling techniques, the last was used only upon S. haemastoma and T. viridula. The mean critical size for Neritina virginea was significantly smaller than that for Stramonita haemastoma, which in turn was smaller than that for Tegula viridula. The claws of the crab Menippe nodifrons are well designed for breaking shells. Menipppe nodifrons is heterochelous, having one larger crusher claw and one smaller less robust <b>cutter</b> <b>claw.</b> Due to their greater mechanical advantage, crusher claws are able to generate considerably greater forces than cutters. Differences in the morphological and mechanical features of crab claws reflect their function and account for many of the observed differences in prey handling techniques and foraging behavior. Menippe nodifrons seems to be pecialised for attacking hardshelled molluscan prey. The predatory behavior of the crab Menippe nodifrons {{is directly related to the}} level of specialization of its claws, of the morphological characteristics and vulnerability of its prey items...|$|R
