50|$|In {{the late}} 1950s the aerodrome {{was used as}} a venue for motor racing by several Sydney car clubs, with the opening meeting taking place on 6 July 1958. The circuit used was {{approximately}} 2.5 mi in length, and used one main runway and an access road in a roughly oval shape. While fast and open, the temporary nature of the track meant that volunteer officials had to set up and <b>dismantle</b> <b>facilities</b> such as grandstands, covered pits and timing towers all on the same day. The last meeting was in 1959, after which the base was re-commissioned as HMAS Nirimba.|$|R

40|$|Automotive {{shredder}} residue is {{a byproduct of}} the automotive recycling infrastructure and represents 15 % of the overall weight of a vehicle. The byproduct is currently diverted to landfill and although the potential for recycling exists, none are currently being utilized within Canada at this time. Consequently, the possibility of dismantling vehicle seats separately from the current vehicle dismantling process in order to remove {{a large portion of}} automotive {{shredder residue}} before the shredding process is investigated using an industrial engineering systems approach. In order to understand the structural make-up of the vehicle a thorough disassembly was performed and all operations, part types, weights and material compositions were recorded. Disassembly and dismantling times were calculated using time measurement studies and relationships were identified between process times and seat characteristics. Using this relationship a heuristic complexity based model was developed that relates the product components and connections to the disassembly and dismantling times. This model was then applied to develop a business model to determine the profitability of a vehicle seat <b>dismantling</b> <b>facility.</b> Issues such as government regulations, expenses and potential revenues are discussed to determine the economical viability of vehicle seat recycling...|$|E

Recyclers are worlung on broadening the range of reusable components from this waste stream, but the proposed approach would significantly increase the volume of recyclable material used in manufacturing new products. This alternative could potentially reduce recycling cost per product in the event of mandatory recycling as a wide variety of consumer electronics could be actively or self disassembled on the same generic dismantling line.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between {{the parameters of the}} wash-off function and the controlling hydrologic variables are investigated in this paper, assuming that the pollutant generation process basically depends on the watershed rainfall-runoff response characteristics. Data collected during an intense monitoring program carried out by the Department of Environmental Engineering of the University of Genova (Italy) within a residential area, an auto <b>dismantler</b> <b>facility,</b> a tourism terminal and a urban waste truck depot are used to this aim. The observed runoff events are classified into different TSS mass delivery processes and the occurrence of the first flush phenomenon is also investigated. The correlation between the mathematical parameters describing the exponential process and the hydrological parameters of the corresponding rainfall-runoff event is analysed: runoff parameters and in particular the maximum flow discharge over the time of concentration of the drainage network are proposed as the controlling factor for the total mass of pollutant that is made available for wash-off during each runoff event...|$|R

40|$|The {{dismantling}} {{consists of}} the organisational and {{the business side of}} the conducting of the: - dismantling of the technical facilities, their disposal or utilisation, and the - disposal of the hazardous waste, including the oil-contaminated soil. The recycling and disposal of the hazardous waste found at the Las Barrancas site and the sealing (including a draining system for the surface water) of the oil-contaminated area could be completed during the project period. Because of the measures implemented so far during this project, no more hazards to the environment are emanating from the SONNTLAN-Facilities. The 'facility ruins' still exist. During the project period, the Mexican government was unstable to create the legal conditions which would have made the <b>dismantling</b> of the <b>facilities</b> in La Paz and Las Barrancas possible. The Mexican government is still very interested in <b>dismantling</b> the <b>facilities</b> with German help. The decision now lies with the BMBF, whether to carry on with the dismantling of the SONNTLAN-Facilities with financial resources from Germany or not.
