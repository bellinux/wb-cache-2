25|$|Tamburs {{are made}} {{almost entirely of}} wood. The shell (Tekne) is {{assembled}} from strips of hardwood called ribs joined <b>edge</b> <b>to</b> <b>edge</b> to form a semi-spherical body for the instrument. The number of ribs traditionally amounts to 17, 21 or 23, yet examples with slightly wider and consequently fewer ribs (7, 9 or 11) {{can also be found}} among older specimens. Traditionally, thinner strips called fileto are inserted between the ribs for ornamental purposes, but are not obligatory. The most common tonewood veneers used for rib-making are mahogany, flame maple, Persian walnut, Mecca balsam wood (Commiphora gileadensis), Spanish chestnut, Greek juniper, mulberry, Oriental plane, Indian rosewood and apricot. Ribs are assembled on the bottom wedge (tail) and the heel on which the fingerboard is mounted.|$|E
25|$|At the beginning, Spanish {{flagship}} Santa Teresa did {{a warning}} shot without bullet {{and ordered the}} enemy to give up arms and surrender, Haultain's fleet, ordered to not open fire unless attacked, responded quickly with a bullet shot with one of two Dutch captains, thus declaring that the combat was accepted. The Dutch ship had discharged at the midpoint of cannons and muskets, but retained Fadrique vessel to be almost <b>edge</b> <b>to</b> <b>edge</b> with the enemy, to be exploited until the last bullet {{and he had the}} utmost vigor. The Spanish broadside caused a horrible thing to that of those watching from land and sea, getting fire to the garrison of the Dutch tables and causing such damage and casualties to them that the Dutch immediately retreated. The Spanish captain went through the enemy formation, firing in all directions and with great speed and accuracy but receiving numerous discharges from the enemy.|$|E
25|$|Many {{publications}} list tooth wear as {{a consequence}} of bruxism, but some report a lack of a positive relationship between tooth wear and bruxism. Tooth wear caused by tooth-to-tooth contact is termed attrition. This is the most usual type of tooth wear that occurs in bruxism, and affects the occlusal surface (the biting surface) of the teeth. The exact location and pattern of attrition depends on how the bruxism occurs, e.g., when the canines and incisors of the opposing arches are moved against each other laterally, by the action of the medial pterygoid muscles, this can lead to the wearing down of the incisal edges of the teeth. To grind the front teeth, most people need to posture their mandible forwards, unless there is an existing <b>edge</b> <b>to</b> <b>edge,</b> class III incisal relationship. People with bruxism may also grind their posterior teeth (back teeth), which wears down the cusps of the occlusal surface. Once tooth wear progresses through the enamel layer, the exposed dentin layer is softer and more vulnerable to wear and tooth decay. If enough of the tooth is worn away or decayed, the tooth will effectively be weakened, and may fracture under the increased forces that occur in bruxism.|$|E

25|$|VAM's {{decision}} to focus all {{efforts on the}} new two-version Lerma model plus the loss of luxury accessories meant the discontinuation of Rally SST for 1982. The loss of the exemption of 500 units of automobile engines without emission certification forced the retirement of the Rally GT. The only model left for 1982 was the Rally AMX, with substantial differences from the previous two years. The taillight surrounding areas plus the headlight bezels and front hood molding were completely blacked out, the last two parts also having a horizontal red stripe passing from <b>edge</b> <b>to</b> <b>edge.</b> An all-new grille design with a horizontal bar {{at the same height}} of the bezels' division between the parking lights and headlights and a vertical bar at the very center; behind these was a set of smaller narrower horizontal lines. Both bumpers for the year were those of the AMC Eagle SX/4 Sport, being blacked out equipped with thick nerfing strips with central bright moldings and longer more aerodynamic bumper end caps with their respective bright molding. Unlike the previous two years, no decals or stickers of any kind were used. The standard wheel designs for the year were the eight spoke steel units with blacked out volcano hubcaps. Due to the impossibility of having the bullet-type door mirrors reproduced, the model switched to sporty design that was used in the 1978–1980 models. However, the remote controls for these mirrors while still available were moved to the option list. The Recaro-type seats received new patterns with a smaller bucket shape to allow an easier {{in and out of the}} car in the driver's side (due to the lack of a tilt steering column). The door panels were the same units as in 1981 except for the change in the fabric portion from plain to a pattern of vertical stripes and the removal of a fake chrome molding in place of a woodgrain unit. The six-bolt sports steering wheel was replaced by a leather-wrapped three-arm Nardi unit. VAM managed to find a local company to reproduce the center console, but it was reduced to the shifter and gauges portions, deleting the armrest with the rear ashtray. Despite the loss in accessories, two new options arrived for the year in the form of the AM FM stereo tape player radio and the rear wiper and washer. The car received two changes in the mid year, the first being a new wooden sports steering wheel and the second a new set of ten-round-spoke steel wheels. Mechanically, the only novelties for the year were wider gear ratios for the A998 automatic transmission and in the mid year a new head design with rounded internal intake ports and smaller spark plug outlets, still retaining the metal valve cover of the previous years. A different head gasket was used to bring the compression ratio from 8.0:1 to 8.5:1.|$|E
500|$|Four {{pairs of}} [...] wide {{observation}} windows are provided, spaced [...] apart, inner stone <b>edge</b> <b>to</b> <b>edge,</b> all {{just above the}} lowest course of slabs (504-foot level). Six are [...] high while two on the east face are [...] high for easier egress. All were originally provided with thin marble shutters in a bronze frame each {{of which could be}} opened inward, one left and the other right per wall. After two people committed suicide by jumping through the open windows in the 1920s, hinged horizontal iron bars were added to them in 1929. A ninth opening in a slab on the south face just below the capstone is provided for access to the outside of the pyramidion. It is covered by a stone slab which is internally removable. In 1931, four red aircraft warning lights were installed, one per face in one of its observation windows. Pilots complained that they could not be easily seen, so the monument was floodlit on all sides as well. In 1958, eight [...] diameter holes for new red aircraft warning lights were bored, one above each window near the top edge of the fourth course of slabs (516-foot level) in the pyramidion. In 1958 the observation windows were glazed with shatterproof glass. In 1974–76, they were glazed with bulletproof glass and the shutters removed. New bulletproof glass was installed during 1997–2000.|$|E

2500|$|The {{repertoire}} of metal body armour included mail (lōrikion alysidōton), scale (lōrikion folidōton) and lamellar (klivanion). Both mail and scale armours {{were similar to}} equivalent armours found in Western Europe, a pull-on “shirt” reaching to the mid-thigh or knee with elbow length sleeves. The lamellar klivanion was a rather different type of garment. Byzantine lamellar, from pictorial evidence, possessed some unique features. [...] It {{was made up of}} round-topped metal lamellae riveted, <b>edge</b> <b>to</b> <b>edge,</b> to horizontal leather backing bands; these bands were then laced together, overlapping vertically, by laces passing through holes in the lamellae. Modern reconstructions have shown this armour to be remarkably resistant to piercing and cutting weapons. Because of the expense of its manufacture, in particular the lamellae surrounding the arm and neck apertures had to be individually shaped, this form of armour was probably largely confined to heavy cavalry and elite units.|$|E
40|$|In the {{standard}} Category of Graphs, the graphs allow only one <b>edge</b> <b>to</b> be incident to any two vertices, not necessarily distinct, and the graph morphisms must map <b>edges</b> <b>to</b> <b>edges</b> and vertices <b>to</b> vertices while preserving incidence. We refer to these graph morphisms as Strict Morphisms. We relax the condition on the graphs allowing {{any number of}} <b>edges</b> <b>to</b> be incident to any two vertices, as well as relaxing the condition on graph morphisms by allowing <b>edges</b> <b>to</b> be mapped to vertices, provided that incidence is still preserved. We call this broader graph category The Category of Conceptual Graphs, and define four other graph categories created by combinations of restrictions of the graph morphisms as well as restrictions on the allowed graphs.

30|$|It is {{interesting}} to note for the augmented network that although (9, 13) is the highest-ranking <b>edge</b> according <b>to</b> <b>Edge</b> Gravity, edge (9, 13) ranks only 11 th according <b>to</b> <b>edge</b> betweenness. Recall from the case study in the previous section that (9, 13) stood out in the original Krebs network as being included in significantly more paths than any other edge. Since (9, 13) also enjoyed the highest ranking for edge betweenness, we know that the dramatic boost in path inclusion for (9, 13) in the original version was due in part to its inclusion in many shortest paths. The proportion of total path inclusion for (9, 13) was greatly diminished in the augmented network, although (9, 13) remained the top-ranking <b>edge</b> according <b>to</b> <b>Edge</b> Gravity. This suggests that the introduction of new <b>edges</b> provided shorter alternatives <b>to</b> formerly shortest path structures that depended on edge (9, 13). Indeed, the role of edge (9, 13) was as a connector between two serpentine ends of the network. Figure  18 shows that the new edges in the augmented version provide shorter alternate routes from opposite ends of the network that bypass edge (9, 13).|$|R

The accident investigators believed it was likely that Flight 325, while flying west between two mature thunderstorms, encountered strong turbulence that caused the crew to lose control and the aircraft to lose {{a significant amount of}} height and enter the thunderstorm to the south of the airport. While flying north, possibly in an attempt to escape the thunderstorm, the crew encountered continuing strong turbulence that caused control to be lost again. The aircraft accelerated to its maximum safe speed or faster and while the crew were struggling to regain control the aircraft was suddenly subjected to extreme turbulence that caused the right wing and the right tailplane to fail.|$|E
