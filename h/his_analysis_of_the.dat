5|$|The {{excavation}} yielded no finds, {{and thus}} it produced no means of reliably dating {{the construction of the}} site. Wainwright suggested that the ring was Early Bronze Age on the basis of other, dated circles in Britain. Based on <b>his</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> site's stratigraphy, he argued that the stones had likely been removed from their original position amid agricultural development {{in the second half of}} the seventeenth century.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{returning}} to Norway, Koht published three {{books on the}} war-time events in Norway: For fred og fridom i krigstid 1939–1940, Frå skanse til skanse. Minne frå krigsmånadene i Noreg 1940 and Norsk utanrikspolitikk fram til 9. april 1940. Synspunkt frå hendingstida, {{all of which were}} released in 1947. These memoir-like books have been analysed as putting a self-apologetic message forth. His political career was effectively ended, but some of his ideas had prevailed. For instance, <b>his</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> class situation in Norway became a part of the general social-democratic ideology of the post-war years.|$|E

5|$|A {{series of}} {{innovations}} {{have been documented}} by 170–160,000 {{years ago at the}} site of Pinnacle Point 13B on the southern Cape coast of South Africa. This includes the oldest confirmed evidence for the utilization of ochre and marine resources in the form of shellfish exploitation for food. Based on <b>his</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> MSA bovid assemblage at Klasies, Milo reports MSA people were formidable hunters and that their social behavior patterns approached those of modern humans. Deacon maintains that the management of plant food resources through deliberate burning of the veld to encourage the growth of plants with corms or tubers in the southern Cape during the Howiesons Poort (c. 70–55 ka) is indicative of modern human behavior. A family basis to foraging groups, color symbolism and the reciprocal exchange of artifacts and the formal organization of living space are, he suggests, further evidence for modernity in the MSA.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, The Washington Post {{linked with}} {{approval}} to Romm's {{review of the}} scientific literature on climate change. Time magazine explored Romm's critique of Matthew Nisbet and praised <b>his</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> decline of media coverage regarding climate change. National Geographic quoted him about the part that the media has played in the dearth of information about climate reaching the public. The same year, Technology Review quoted Romm regarding the relationship between government-assisted deployment and rapid innovation in energy technologies, and the Toronto Star quoted him regarding President Obama's 2011 State of the Union address. In 2012 in The New York Times, economist Paul Krugman cited Romm on the connection between drought and Climate change, and The Atlantic interviewed and cited him on the reluctance of the Democrats to discuss climate change. National Geographic quoted him about disappearing arctic ice {{and the effect of}} climate change on the polar bear, and Current TV's Bill Press interviewed Romm about record-breaking heat.|$|E
5|$|Monteverdi was, {{at least}} initially, much {{taken with the}} {{potential}} of the plot, and the opportunities the libretto provided for a variety of musical effects. Monteverdi stressed to Striggio the importance of finding a singer with real acting ability {{to play the role of}} Licori, someone capable of playing a man and a woman with appropriate emotions and gestures. Later he enthused about the chance to write a ballet for each of the five acts, all in different styles. Monteverdi's letters continued throughout the summer, but his attitude slowly changed, from one of evident commitment to frustration at the delays in getting the libretto copied. The musicologist Gary Tomlinson, in <b>his</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> opera's genesis, suggests that Monteverdi may have been stalling. In September Striggio, having received, read and presumably not liked the expanded libretto, abruptly cancelled the commission and the work is heard of no more. Monteverdi was told instead to work on the Armida setting.|$|E

5|$|Weber's {{best known}} work in {{economics}} concerned the preconditions for capitalist development, particularly {{the relations between}} religion and capitalism, which he explored in The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism {{as well as in}} his other works on the sociology of religion. He argued that bureaucratic political and economic systems emerging in the Middle Ages were essential in the rise of modern capitalism (including rational book-keeping and organisation of formally free labour), while they were a hindrance in the case of ancient capitalism, which had a different social and political structure based on conquest, slavery, and the coastal city-state. Other contributions include his early work on the economic history of Roman agrarian society (1891) and on the labour relations in Eastern Germany (1892), <b>his</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> history of commercial partnerships in the Middle Ages (1889), his critique of Marxism, the discussion of the roles of idealism and materialism in the history of capitalism in his Economy and Society (1922) and his General Economic History (1923), a notable example of the kind of empirical work associated with the German Historical School.|$|E

25|$|A-wings later {{appear in}} various Star Wars Expanded Universe {{television}} shows, books, and games. Some Expanded Universe material says Jan Dodonna created the A-wing based on <b>his</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> role of speed in the Battle of Yavin, the climactic battle in Star Wars (1977). Later material, {{such as the}} Star Wars Rebels cartoon, depicts the starfighters in use before the events of Star Wars.|$|E
25|$|There is {{circularity}} in Everett's measurement theory. Under {{the assumptions}} made by Everett, {{there are no}} 'good observations' as defined by him, and since <b>his</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> observational process depends on the latter, it is void of any meaning. The concept of a 'good observation' is the projection postulate in disguise and Everett's analysis simply derives this postulate by having assumed it, without any discussion.|$|E
25|$|The arguably most {{influential}} of Pătrășcanu's writings remains <b>his</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Romanian intelligentsia, part of Probleme de bază ale României. Transcending Leninist rhetoric, the work postulates a characteristic inability of Romanian intellectuals in sacrificing petty politics {{for the common}} good, and argues that Romanian elites, while in subservience to the State, have traditionally been attracted to extremism. On one instance in 1945, when theorizing about intellectual déclassés, he proposed their neutralization and systematic supervision".|$|E

25|$|In <b>his</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new art movement, Apollinaire makes a {{distinction}} between four different types of Cubism; scientific, physical, orphic and instinctive. The first, Scientific Cubism, {{is the art of}} painting new ensembles with elements borrowed not from the reality of vision, but from the reality of knowledge. It is the tendency of 'pure' painting. The painters Apollinaire places in this category are: Picasso, Braque, Metzinger, Gleizes, Laurencin and Gris.|$|E
25|$|The {{mechanisms}} {{proved to}} be correct and their naming of the phenomena became the international standard. Wild likened this research {{to the study of}} taxonomy that preceded Darwin's Origin of species. <b>His</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> anatomy of the solar flares and his development of the physical interpretation culminated in a unified model that integrated the apparently complex radio flare phenomena in the solar chromosphere, solar corona, and in the interplanetary space.|$|E
25|$|The film {{generated}} {{a fair amount}} of national publicity. Patterson appeared on a few popular TV talk shows to promote the film and belief in Bigfoot by showing excerpts from it: for instance, on the Joe Pyne Show in Los Angeles, in 1967, which covered most of the western US; on Merv Griffin's program, with Krantz offering <b>his</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> film; on Joey Bishop's talk show, and also on Johnny Carson's Tonight Show.

25|$|There, {{he began}} a {{productive}} and contented period during which he began his lifelong work of bringing true engineering understanding to soil as an engineering material whose properties could be measured in standardized ways. He set up a laboratory, using only the most rudimentary of equipment, and began his revolution. Both his measurements and <b>his</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> force on retaining walls were first published in English in 1919, and they were quickly recognized as an important new contribution to the scientific understanding of the fundamental behavior of soils.|$|E
25|$|Apsley Cherry-Garrard in <b>his</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{expedition}} {{estimated that}} even under optimistic assumptions the summit rations contained {{only a little}} more than half the calories actually required for the man-hauling of sledges. A carefully planned 2006 re-enactment of both Amundsen's and Scott's travels, sponsored by the BBC, confirmed Cherry-Garrard's theory. The British team had to abort their tour due to the severe weight loss of all members. The experts hinted that Scott's reports of unusually bad surfaces and weather conditions might in part have been due to their exhausted state which made them feel the sledge weights and the chill more severely.|$|E
25|$|After {{weeks of}} negotiation, a debate between Salmond and Darling was arranged. The programme, titled as , was {{broadcast}} by STV on 5 August 2014. The debate, moderated by Bernard Ponsonby, saw both politicians make opening statements and cross-examine {{each other before}} taking questions from the audience. At {{the end of the}} clash, they were both given the chance to make a closing speech. Both campaign groups claimed victory in the debate. A snap poll conducted by ICM stated Darling won the debate by 56% to 44%.
