25|$|The British {{squadron}} then {{engaged the}} French warships escorting the convoy {{but were not}} able to bring them to a full battle before having to give up the chase due to the onset of dark and the <b>dangerous</b> <b>location.</b> Galatea was the only vessel in the British squadron to suffer casualties; she lost two men killed and six wounded. The store-ship Etoile, under the command of lieutenant de vaisseau Mathurin-Théodore Berthelin, struck. She was armed with thirty 12-pounder guns and had a crew of 160 men. Four French frigates, a corvette, a brig {{and the rest of the}} convoy escaped.|$|E
500|$|Times {{became more}} {{difficult}} for the Spencers by the late 19th century, and many of their assets had to be sold off. Albert Spencer, 7th Earl Spencer inherited the estate after his father Charles' death in 1922. Albert became a well-known art connoisseur and was a trustee of the Wallace Collection, chairman of the Royal School of Needlework, a Fellow of both the Society of Antiquaries of London and the Royal Society of Arts, and from 1961 until 1969 he was Chair of the Advisory Council of the Victoria and Albert Museum. Despite his keen interest in art, he began selling off paintings and other items to pay off debts. In the 1930s he was forced to sell off a small but immaculate Hans Holbein portrait of Henry VIII (now at the Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum, Madrid) for £10,000 to finance his son's education. Although a large sum at the time, by 1998 it was reputed to be worth around £50 million. Unlike many country houses in Britain during the Second World War which were occupied by the military and converted into hospitals, training camps and barracks, Althorp house remained untouched, thanks to Albert who saw to it that they used the stables instead. A Wellington bomber crashed near the ice house during the war, killing all of its crew. Due to Spencer House being in a <b>dangerous</b> <b>location</b> in London during the Blitz, many of the pieces of furniture and items of the house were brought to Althorp for safekeeping, including numerous fireplaces and doors with curled [...] "S" [...] doorknobs, a signature of the Spencer family dating to the 18th century.|$|E

2500|$|The {{fourth group}} is the [...] "no children" [...] group. Rainey sees couples in this group as believing they are within their Biblical rights to define their lives around non-natal concerns. While not their main {{emphasis}} on the subject, Protestant authors such as Samuel Owen and James B. Jordan support this as an acceptable option, but only when a higher ethical principle intervenes to make child bearing imprudent, such as health concerns or a calling to serve orphans or as missionaries in a <b>dangerous</b> <b>location,</b> etc. A small activist group, the Cyber-Church of Jesus Christ Childfree, argues their position, [...] "Jesus loved children but chose to never have any, {{so that he could}} devote his life to telling the Good News." [...] Jordan also maintains that modern birth control methods, as well as Natural Family Planning, are acceptable tools of prudent family planning. Jordan also strongly supports the option for couples to have very large families, while Owen believes that non-use of birth control in any form should be normative. Rainey sees infertile couples as falling into this group apart from their choice in the matter. Sterilized couples may as well. According to Southern Baptist R. Albert Mohler, Jr., [...] "Couples are not given the option of chosen childlessness in the biblical revelation".|$|E
40|$|As part of {{the thesis}} we studied {{advanced}} spatial statistical methods and used them in determining <b>dangerous</b> <b>locations</b> on the roads. The results were compared {{with the results of}} the Critical accident rate method, which is in use for state roads in Slovenia. <b>Dangerous</b> <b>locations</b> are sections of the road network, with higher probability for traffic accidents. Methods of spatial statistics that we have researched are the local Moran index I and Getis-Ord G-method. We designed and executed several simulations on the test cases. Methods were used also on real cases. For a realistic example, we have selected the section 0262 (Rašica-Žlebič) on the main road G 2 - 106 (Škofljica-Kočevje), which is known as a dangerous section on Slovenian roads, as proved also by the EuroRAP analysis. The results are as expected, the three methods show similar results. In some cases, methods differ and find more <b>dangerous</b> <b>locations</b> than other methods...|$|R

2500|$|As soon as {{the merger}} was complete, the newly named Washington-Hoover Airport came in for harsh {{criticism}} for its <b>dangerous</b> <b>location</b> and other safety concerns. Pilots rated it the most dangerous airport in the nation. Famed aviator Wiley Post declared there were better airstrips in Siberia. Airways Age magazine, then the publication of record for the aviation industry, reported that Hoover-Washington [...] "provided the national capital with probably the poorest aviation ground facilities of any important city in either the United States or Europe." [...] Harold Gatty, [...] "Prince of Navigators" [...] (according to Charles Lindbergh), called it [...] "the worst in the United States in any town of more than 15,000 population. [...] In size, conditions, obstructions, and approach, the field has shortcomings. From {{the point of view}} of national dignity, it is a disgrace." [...] He strongly attacked the field's inability to keep the sod runways and taxiing areas properly drained, and said there was no reason why mere rain should close the airport. [...] Major J. Carroll Cone, assistant director for aeronautic development within the U.S. Department of Commerce, said the airport was [...] "the worst in the United States", said it was [...] "admittedly inadequate", and that [...] "its continuing use is out of the question." [...] James C. Edgerton, an aide to the Assistant Secretary of Commerce, said planes were in [...] "imminent danger" [...] when using the field.
