40|$|In {{this paper}} it is {{investigated}} whether the Flame Surface Density (FSD) model, developed for turbulent premixed combustion, is also applicable to stratified flames. Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) of turbulent stratified Bunsen flames {{have been carried}} out, using the Flamelet Generated Manifold (FGM) reduction method for reaction kinetics. Before examining the suitability of the FSD model, flame surfaces are characterized in terms of thickness, curvature and stratification. All flames are in the Thin Reaction Zones regime, and the maximum equivalence ratio range covers 0. 11. 3. For all flames, local flame thicknesses correspond very well to those observed in stretchless, steady premixed flamelets. Extracted curvature radii and mixing length scales are significantly larger than the flame thickness, implying that the stratified flames all burn in a premixed mode. The remaining challenge is accounting for the large variation in (subfilter) mass burning rate. In this contribution, the FSD model is proven to be applicable for Large Eddy Simulations (LES) of stratified flames for the equivalence ratio range 0. 11. 3. Subfilter mass burning rate variations {{are taken into account}} by a subfilter Probability Density Function (PDF) for the mixture fraction, on which the mass burning rate directly depends. A priori analysis point out that for small stratifications (0. 41. 0), the replacement of the subfilter PDF (obtained from DNS data) by the corresponding <b>Dirac</b> <b>function</b> is appropriate. Integration of the <b>Dirac</b> <b>function</b> with the mass burning rate m=m(), can then adequately model the filtered mass burning rate obtained from filtered DNS data. For a larger stratification (0. 11. 3), and filter widths up to ten flame thicknesses, a ß-function for the subfilter PDF yields substantially better predictions than a <b>Dirac</b> <b>function.</b> Finally, inclusion of a simple algebraic model for the FSD resulted only in small additional deviations from DNS data, thereby rendering this approach promising for application in LES...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. For a {{contravariant}} 4 -metric which changes signature from Lorentzian to Riemannian {{across a}} spatial hypersurface, the mixed Einstein tensor is manifestly nonsingular. In Gaussian normal coordinates, the metric contains a step function and the Einstein tensor contains the Dirac delta function with support at the junction. The coefficient of the <b>Dirac</b> <b>function</b> is a linear {{combination of the}} second fundamental form (extrinsic curvature) of the junction. Thus, unless the junction has vanishing extrinsic curvature, the physical interpretation of the metric is that it describes a layer of matter (with stresses but no energy or momentum) at the junction. In particular, such metrics do not satisfy the vacuum Einstein equations, nor the Einstein-Klein-Gordon equations and so on. Similarly, the d’Alembertian of a Klein-Gordon field contains the <b>Dirac</b> <b>function</b> with coefficient given by {{the momentum of the}} field. Thus, if the momentum of the field does not vanish at the junction, the physical interpretation {{is that there is a}} source (with step potential) at the junction. In particular, such fields do not satisfy the massless Klein-Gordon equation. These facts contradict claims in the literature. PACS: 04. 20. Cv, 02. 40. K...|$|E
