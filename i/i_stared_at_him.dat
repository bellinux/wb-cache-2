60|$|<b>I</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> and {{repeated}} the word. He beamed pleasantly upon me.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> {{thinking}} that the Administrator's champagne had got into his head.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> doubtfully, for {{at times}} a pleasantry {{came out of}} his bitterness.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>stared</b> hard <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> not <b>at</b> first quite {{understanding}} what he meant.|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>stared</b> askance <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> {{in utter}} silence. Then I smiled half tolerantly. [...] "But father, {{yesterday}} {{they were all}} here. Yesterday was..." ...|$|R
60|$|He did {{not offer}} me his hand. <b>I</b> could only <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> for <b>I</b> had {{expected}} anything but this.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> in amazement. And no wonder. The {{young man}} was Duncan Woodward.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> in {{speechless}} amazement. The words, for an instant, absolutely petrified me.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> in {{speechless}} consternation, and for {{a moment}} I seemed forlorn of sense and understanding.|$|E
60|$|A {{horror of}} the spirit came over me, and, as if rapt away from myself, <b>I</b> <b>stared</b> sheer up <b>at</b> <b>him.</b>|$|R
6000|$|As {{we climbed}} out once more, this time into an open, {{beautiful}} pine forest, with little patches of green thicket, I {{seemed to have}} been drugged by the fragrance and the color and the beauty of the wild. For when Copple called low and sharp: [...] "Hist!" [...] <b>I</b> <b>stared</b> uncomprehendingly <b>at</b> <b>him.</b>|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> {{stopped and}} <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> since the lie was so amazing {{that it seemed}} to deprive me of the power of motion. Noting my very obvious disbelief he {{continued}} blandly, ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> speechless. We Woosters are {{as quick}} as lightning, and I saw at once that {{something}} had happened.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>him.</b> It {{was strange}} to hear Bickley, the scoffer at miracles, {{suggesting}} that this greatest of all miracles might be possible.|$|E
60|$|Clearly he had {{not heard}} a word of the anecdote. And this annoyed me, because the anecdote was really good. <b>I</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Samuelson's jewels," [...] he complained, [...] "were {{like his}} wines, all sparkle and outside--no body to them. Two {{thousand}} pounds indeed! Why, {{we shall be}} lucky if we clear four hundred!" [...] The man's coolness absolutely took me aback. For a moment <b>I</b> simply <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>him.</b> [...] "He'll be round to see you this morning, sometime, about my character," [...] Mr. Parker proceeded.|$|R
6000|$|Thorn, <b>I</b> remember, <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> in wonder, and {{afterwards}} observed: [...] "You and I have {{just got to}} keep on trying until we find out {{the best way of}} fixing things, and if our way's certain, it's often expensive. That man just chews on his cigar, and it comes to him. When I take up my located land and get worried about the money, I'm going to try cigar-smoking." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> {{turned and}} <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> but he {{remained}} insensible to my astonishment, {{perhaps because it}} was now too dark {{for him to see}} it. [...] "Our women have no influence in public affairs," [...] I said, quietly, after a moment.|$|R
60|$|What {{on earth}} did he mean, under present circumstances, by putting such a {{question}} to me as that? <b>I</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> instead of answering him.|$|E
60|$|Without {{completely}} understanding it, yet scandalized beyond measure at {{as much as}} I understood, to hear such sentiments {{upon his}} priestly lips, <b>I</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> in candid horror.|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> blankly. It was {{not much}} good, as {{he could not see}} my face, but it {{relieved}} me. [...] "Rather a pretty girl!" [...] What a description! ...|$|E
6000|$|It {{was said}} in an {{extraordinary}} dandified manner which {{in conjunction with the}} matter made me forget my tongue in my head. <b>I</b> could only <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>him.</b> He added more naturally: “2nd Reg. Castille, Cavalry.” Then with marked stress in Spanish, “En las filas legitimas.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Most likely, Heathcliff noticed {{more the}} truth of what was said, than the spirit of the person who said it. His {{attention}} was roused, I saw, for his eyes rained down tears among the ashes, and he drew his breath in suffocating sighs. <b>I</b> <b>stared</b> full <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> and laughed scornfully. The clouded windows of hell flashed a moment towards me; the fiend which usually looked out, however, was so dimmed and drowned that I did not fear to hazard another sound of derision.|$|R
60|$|As I {{stand at}} the street corner, I don't see {{as many as four}} people at once going to church, though I see as many as four churches with their {{steeples}} clamouring for people. I choose my church, and go up the flight of steps to the great entrance in the tower. A mouldy tower within, and like a neglected washhouse. A rope comes through the beamed roof, and a man in the corner pulls it and clashes the bell--a whity-brown man, whose clothes were once black- -a man with flue on him, and cobweb. He <b>stares</b> <b>at</b> me, wondering how I come there, and <b>I</b> <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> wondering how he comes there. Through a screen of wood and glass, I peep into the dim church. About twenty people are discernible, waiting to begin. Christening would seem to have faded out of this church long ago, for the font has the dust of desuetude thick upon it, and its wooden cover (shaped like an old-fashioned tureen-cover) looks as if it wouldn't come off, upon requirement. I perceive the altar to be rickety and the Commandments damp. Entering after this survey, I jostle the clergyman in his canonicals, who is entering too from a dark lane behind a pew of state with curtains, where nobody sits. The pew is ornamented with four blue wands, once carried by four somebodys, I suppose, before somebody else, but which there is nobody now to hold or receive honour from. I open the door of a family pew, and shut myself in; if I could occupy twenty family pews at once I might have them. The clerk, a brisk young man (how does HE come here?), glances at me knowingly, as who should say, 'You have done it now; you must stop.' Organ plays. Organ-loft is in a small gallery across the church; gallery congregation, two girls. I wonder within myself what will happen when we are required to sing.|$|R
6000|$|Aline {{smiled at}} me over her shoulder, and <b>I</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> in amaze, saying, [...] "I never found it either {{particularly}} easy or peaceful. I don't quite understand you." ...|$|E
60|$|To {{my great}} {{surprise}} Mr. Razumov {{sat down again}} suddenly. <b>I</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> and I must say that he returned my stare without winking for quite a considerable time.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>him.</b> Surely {{the war had}} {{affected}} the little man's brain. He was carefully engaged in brushing his coat before putting it on, and seemed wholly engrossed in the task.|$|E
60|$|I did not answer. <b>I</b> {{could only}} <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> mutely {{grateful}} {{for such an}} affection. In all his wild life he had been true to me, and he had clung to me stanchly in this, my greatest peril. Thankful that he was here, I searched his handsome person with my eyes. He was dressed as usual, with care and fashion, in linen breeches and a light gray coat and a filmy ruffle at his neck. But I thought there had come a change into his face. The reckless quality seemed to {{have gone out of}} it, yet the spirit and daring remained, and with these all the sweetness that was once in his smile. There were lines under his eyes that spoke of vigils.|$|R
6000|$|At {{the last}} lock, some little {{way out of}} Landrecies, I refused to go any farther; and sat in a drift of rain {{by the side of}} the bank to have a {{reviving}} pipe. A vivacious old man, whom I take to have been the devil, drew near and questioned me about our journey. In the fullness of my heart I laid bare our plans before him. He said it was the silliest enterprise that ever he heard of. Why, did I not know, he asked me, that it was nothing but locks, locks, locks, the whole way? not to mention that, at this season of the year, we should find the Oise quite dry? [...] "Get into a train, my little young man," [...] said he, [...] "and go you away home to your parents." [...] I was so astounded at the man's malice that <b>I</b> could only <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> in silence. A tree would never have spoken to me like this. At last I got out with some words. We had come from Antwerp already, I told him, which was a good long way; and we should do the rest in spite of him. Yes, I said, if there were no other reason, I would do it now, just because he had dared to say we could not. The pleasant old gentleman looked at me sneeringly, made an allusion to my canoe, and marched off, waggling his head.|$|R
60|$|We {{had already}} risen to go, and the vestiaire {{was on his}} way towards us, bearing my hat and coat, when Monsieur Carvin, who had hurried out a moment before, reappeared, {{ushering}} in a new arrival. The events that followed have always seemed a little confused to me. My first thought was that this was indeed a nightmare into which I had wandered. The slight unreality which had hung like a cloud over the whole of the evening, the strangeness of my being there with such a companion, the curious atmosphere of the place, which so far had completely puzzled me,--these things may all have served to heighten the illusion. Yet it seemed to me then that, dreaming or waking, this thing with which I was confronted was the last impossibility. I suppose that <b>I</b> must have <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> like some wild creature, for the conversation around us suddenly stopped. Standing upon the threshold, looking around him with the happy air of an habitue, I saw this man to whom I owed my presence in Paris, this man concerning whom I had sworn that if ever I should meet him face to face my hand should be upon his throat. I remember nothing of my progress, but I know that I stood before him before he was conscious even of my presence. I addressed him by name. I believe that even my voice was not upraised.|$|R
6000|$|... "Let us {{invoke the}} Fates. Heads we run like heroes; tails we stay here like heroes," [...] and he spun the penny, while <b>I</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> {{open-mouthed}} and not without admiration.|$|E
6000|$|... "Because my god, the Grasshopper, when he {{fashioned}} me a dwarf, {{gave me a}} {{big mouth}} and good teeth," [...] he answered, whereon <b>I</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> thinking that he had gone mad.|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>him.</b> I had not {{suspected}} {{this aspect}} of the matter before. But it came to me at once--a positive craving. [...] "Yes," [...] I said with emphasis. [...] "I am hungry too." ...|$|E
5000|$|Jones's first {{release on}} Mercury Records in 1960 had been George Jones Salutes Hank Williams, which {{features}} twelve sides {{made famous by}} the late country star. My Favorites of Hank Williams includes twelve more recordings {{in much the same}} vein, with strict country arrangements, but Jones's voice has matured and is noticeably lower than it was earlier in his career when his vocal style was more derivative of his doomed idol. Jones always cited Hank Williams as one of his biggest musical influences. In 1949, Jones actually met Williams when Hank appeared on KRIC in Beaumont, a radio station where a teenage Jones had secured a gig backing an old time country duet act Eddie and Pearl. In a 2006 television interview with Bill Cody Jones recalled, [...] "He had to be the nicest guy I'd ever met in my life, so down to earth...He had a big hit out at the time called 'Wedding Bells'. I was gonna play guitar with him on this radio show...I'm standing {{on the other side of}} the mic - that's when the mic came out of the ceiling - I'm standing there ready to kick it off and instead he starts singin'. So that beat me out of the kick off, you know, I'd rehearsed and rehearsed...He finished the song and I hadn't hit a note. Not a note. <b>I</b> just <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>him.</b> <b>I</b> was amazed." [...] In the 1989 video documentary Same Ole Me, Jones admitted, [...] "I couldn't think or eat nothin' unless it was Hank Williams, and I couldn't wait for his next record to come out. He had to be, really, the greatest." [...] In his memoir, Jones recalled learning about Williams death on New Year's Day 1953 while he was serving a stint in the marines stationed in San Jose, California. After a friend showed him the headline in the paper, Jones wrote that he [...] "lay there and bawled", adding that [...] "Hank Williams had been my biggest musical influence. By that thinking you could say he was the biggest part of my life. That's how personally I took him and his songs." ...|$|R
60|$|On {{our return}} into the city, {{we passed through}} Christ Church, which, as regards the number of students, is the most {{considerable}} college of the University. It has a stately dome; but my memory is confused with battlements, towers, and gables, and Gothic staircases and cloisters. If there had been nothing else in Oxford but this one establishment, my anticipations {{would not have been}} disappointed. The bell was tolling for worship in the chapel; and Mr. Parker told us that Dr. Pusey is a canon, or in some sort of dignity, in Christ Church, and would soon probably make his appearance in the quadrangle, on his way to chapel; so we walked to and fro, waiting an opportunity to see him. A gouty old dignitary, in a white surplice, came hobbling along from one extremity of the court; and by and by, from the opposite corner, appeared Dr. Pusey, also in a white surplice, and with a lady by his side. We met him, and <b>I</b> <b>stared</b> pretty fixedly <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> as I well might; for he looked on the ground, as if conscious that he would be <b>stared</b> <b>at.</b> He is a man past middle life, of sufficient breadth and massiveness, with a pale, intellectual, manly face. He was talking with the lady, and smiled, but not jollily. Mr. Parker, who knows him, says that {{he is a man of}} kind and gentle affections. The lady was his niece.|$|R
60|$|Cosimo <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> with round eyes, and <b>I</b> <b>stared</b> too, no {{glimmer of}} the {{enormous}} truth breaking yet upon my bewildered mind. In the court the silence was deathly until Gonzaga spoke.|$|R
