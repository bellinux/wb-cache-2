In this process material is removed by a tubular tool following a predefined path in a layer-by-layer fashion. In this initial study the influence of different process parameters, electrode geometry and electrode rotation on the process performance is investigated. Experiments showed that the best performance in terms of removal rate, surface quality and accuracy can be obtained when using a pulsed voltage input. Moreover, inaccuracies due to the tubular electrode shape can be avoided by using alternative electrodes which distribute the <b>flushing</b> <b>holes</b> over the entire cross section of the electrode or by decreasing the inner diameter of the tubular electrodes. Finally specific milling aspects like performing multiple passes and step-over were investigated. It was shown that further improvements are necessary to obtain a good part accuracy...|$|R

40|$|O processo de rebitagem atual da Embraer não é considerado robusto, mas um processo sob controle estatístico e previsível. Alguns trabalhos foram desenvolvidos com sucesso para garantir a estabilidade do processo, que atualmente apresenta baixos índices de defeitos. No entanto, devido à variabilidade inerente a cada operação de escareamento e cravação e a ordem de grandeza das tolerâncias do processo, uma pequena alteração nas características dos rebites afeta consideravelmente a qualidade da rebitagem e, portanto, a qualidade do produto EMBRAER. Para garantir a estabilidade do processo de rebitagem, analisou-se a influência dos parâmetros de fabricação dos rebites do atual fornecedor nas características de instalação. O trabalho englobou desde engenharia do valor e ensaios dimensionais e metalográficos, até um levantamento estatístico comparativo entre as principais dimensões dos rebites com os limites de tolerâncias das especificações. A capacidade (Cp) e a capacidade real (Cpk) do processo do atual fornecedor foram examinadas, objetivando a inserção de requisitos na especificação EMBRAER capaz de garantir maior controle na qualidade dos rebites, visando otimizar o processo de rebitagem, reduzir custos com reparos, garantir a capacidade de produção e satisfazer as exigências quanto aos aspectos visuais dos clientesThe current {{riveting}} process of EMBRAER {{is not considered}} robust, but a process under statistical and previsible control.

40|$|This {{study shows}} {{the results of}} an attempt to develop a {{transfer}} function of cone resistance measured in medium over-consolidated sands (< 2 MPa) toward relative soil density and absolute porosity solely based on in-situ testing. In a sand pit, a water saturated, Late Pleistocene fluvial section of 15 m thick-ness with homogeneous grain size distribution and comparable emax and emin values, but highly variable cone resistance was selected for testing. Two ~ 25 m deep sampling holes, six CPTs and two approximately 40 m deep neighboring <b>flush</b> drilled <b>holes</b> for downhole logging with a horizontal distance of 2. 5 m to the CPTs were used in this study. Relevant downhole logging parameters are wet bulk density derived from active gamma logs and porosities derived from neutron-neutron logs. The results show a straightforward stratigraphic picture with clear soil package boundaries. However, within the sand formation of interest fluvial foresets bars, top sets and incised channels with local unconformities lead to changes of stratigraphic height over short horizontal distances challenging in turn the correlation of logging and CPT data. Despite these difficulties, the project resulted in a new transfer function for glacially overconsolidated sands not only linking tip values to relative density but also directly to porosity, making sampling at least for stratigraphic equivalent sands no longer a requirement...|$|R
40|$|Cryoconite {{holes in}} the McMurdo Dry Valleys are ice-lidded, thus {{isolating}} the pools {{of water from the}} atmosphere and from potential surface melt. Hourly measurements of ice and water temperature and water electrical conductivity (EC) were recorded to broadly characterize the physical and chemical changes on daily to seasonal timescales. Overall, subsurface ice/water temperatures were typically several degrees warmer than air temperatures, underscoring the importance of subsurface solar heating. At no time was surface melt observed and the holes melted from within. Detailed differences in the timing and magnitude of both temperature and EC variations during melt-out and freezeup existed between holes despite short separation distances (< 1 m). We attribute these differences to small-scale changes in the optical characteristics of the ice and perhaps different efficiencies in hydrologic connections between holes. The holes melt-deepened quickly {{in the first half of}} the summer before slowing to a rate equal to the rate of surface ablation that kept hole depth constant for the remainder of the season. The relatively constant EC of the hole waters during midsummer indicates that these holes were connected to a subsurface water system that <b>flushed</b> the <b>holes</b> with fresher meltwater. The early and late season ECs are dominated by freeze-thaw effects that concentrate/dilute the solutes. We speculate that high solute concentrations imply high nutrient concentrations in early summer that may help alleviate potential stresses caused by the production of new biomass after the winter freeze...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper will}} {{indicate}} of how {{appropriate use of}} aquatic skylight module installed on buildings in the tropical zone compared to {{the ones in the}} subtropical climate. In order for energy saving strategies, the aquatic-polycarbonate skylight system is used in the tropical climate. In the tropical hot humid climate, Indonesia has received huge amount of global direct and diffuse radiations on horizontal roofs throughout the year, approximately 525 watts per square meter of solar radiation will impact on flat roofs or skylights on a clear sunny day in Surabaya city. Ironically, most of the commercial and institution buildings are equipped with Western skylight styles in Surabaya without any modifications. The aquatic-polycarbonate skylight is the system that will control daylight, scatter direct solar heat radiation, cool the indoor polycarbonate surface temperature, and collect solar hot water at the same time. The concept of using the water as shading device has three goals: first of all, the flushing water in the polycarbonate holes tries to scatter horizontal or tiled skylight direct sun-ray radiation, and minimize the direct sun heat temperature on the polycarbonate with flushing water continuously. Secondly, the sparkle flushing water in series of square holes of polycarbonate will bounce and disperse the direct sunlight into the space below enhancing daylight patterns. Finally, while bouncing, sparkling and scattering direct sunlight, those series of <b>flushing</b> water <b>holes</b> would also collect the solar heat radiation as solar hot water. Each system could works nicely to absorb, to scatter, to minimize, and to obtain the solar heat radiation for solar hot water in buildings. This strategy aims to provide a clean environment living zones with applying passive heating and cooling systems...|$|R
50|$|It {{was only}} when the DTH system came along {{that many of the}} {{problems}} associated with the other systems were overcome - with the DTH system the energy source is constantly behind the drill bit, the drill tubes (or drill string) are rigid being only slightly less in diameter than the drill bit, copious amounts of air can be passed through the drill string to operate the DTH Hammer which is then used to efficiently <b>flush</b> the bore <b>hole</b> clean. DTH did not require heavy down thrusts or high rotational speeds and as such a light, cheap machine could be employed to carry out the drilling process - the machine could also be worked by one man, whereas some other systems required two operatives. The benefits that DTH brought to the industry were enormous - {{for the first time a}} drill hole could be placed where it was required because DTH gave a truly aligned, straight, accurately placed, clean bore hole that could be easily charged with explosive to provide good control over the blasting process that was safer and which provided good fragmentation of the rock. Holes could be drilled to increasing depths without the loss of performance since the energy source was always directly behind the drill bit. The system was able to drill in almost all rock conditions that other systems were unable to do. Quarry faces became safer, well profiled and quarry floors were level and easier for loading equipment to operate and move across.|$|R
