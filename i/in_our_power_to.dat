500|$|Tickets for the Best of Both Worlds Tour {{were selling}} out quite rapidly. Nevertheless, ticket {{scalping}} {{was one of}} the primary reasons for it. Many tickets were immediately found for purchase on secondary markets, such as eBay or StubHub, selling for well over the face value of the tickets. Broker prices ranged from $350 to $2,000 for the tickets originally sold for $29 to $66. The shortage of tickets for the tour became so pronounced it gained national attention, with parents frequently expressing their outrage, discontent, and disappointment on behalf of their children. Vice president of Ticketmaster, Joe Freeman commented, [...] "Hell hath no fury like the parent of a child throwing a tantrum.

What, however, is meant by 'our bloods no more obey the heavens?'--Dr. Johnson's assertion that 'bloods' signify 'countenances,' is, I think, mistaken both in the thought conveyed--(for it was never a popular belief that the stars governed men's countenances,) and in the usage, which requires an antithesis of the blood,--or the temperament of the four humours, choler, melancholy, phlegm, and the red globules, or the sanguine portion, which was supposed not <b>to</b> be <b>in</b> <b>our</b> own <b>power,</b> but, <b>to</b> be dependent on the influences of the heavenly bodies,--and the countenances which are <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>power</b> really, though from flattery we bring them into a no less apparent dependence on the sovereign, than the former are in actual dependence on the constellations.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{finds its}} {{inspiration}} {{in the work}} of the seventeenth century philosopher Benedict de Spinoza. My objective is to briefly examine three crucial aspects of Spinoza’s philosophy which are not only extremely useful to our understanding of philosophy for children but also inspirational as they challenge some of our ingrained modes of thinking and create space for new relations with knowledge, others and the self. Firstly, Spinoza’s relational ontology allows us to perceive ourselves as moments in a process of integration. In his philosophy, the understanding of connectedness is crucial to the expansion of <b>our</b> <b>powers</b> or activity. I thus suggest that the collective practice of philosophy can contribute to the enhancement of rational systems of sociability in which the understanding of connectedness is crucial. Secondly, reason and affectivity are not separate <b>in</b> Spinoza’s philosophy. <b>Our</b> <b>power</b> <b>to</b> think and affect is directly associated with <b>our</b> <b>power</b> <b>to</b> be affected or our openness to others. These first two aspects are also directly associated with his ethical and political project. Since, for Spinoza, joy is the passage from a lesser <b>to</b> a greater <b>power</b> <b>to</b> act, and virtue is equated with activity, I argue that the collective practice of philosophy can be understood in this perspective as essentially joyful, in a political and ethical sense: it increases one’s powers through the increase of power also experienced by others...|$|R
