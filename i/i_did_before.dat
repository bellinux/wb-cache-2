500|$|In 1972, Takemitsu, {{accompanied}} by Iannis Xenakis, Betsy Jolas, and others, heard Balinese gamelan music in Bali. The experience influenced the composer on a largely philosophical and theological level. For those accompanying Takemitsu on the expedition (most {{of whom were}} French musicians), who [...] "... could not keep their composure as <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>before</b> this music: it was too foreign {{for them to be}} able to assess the resulting discrepancies with their logic", the experience was without precedent. For Takemitsu, however, by now quite familiar with his own native musical tradition, there was a relationship between [...] "the sounds of the gamelan, the tone of the kapachi, the unique scales and rhythms by which they are formed, and Japanese traditional music which had shaped such a large part of my sensitivity". In his solo piano work For Away (written for Roger Woodward in 1973), a single, complex line is distributed between the pianist's hands, which reflects the interlocking patterns between the metallophones of a gamelan orchestra.|$|E

2500|$|As a child, Abramović's mother beat her. In an {{interview}} published in 1998, Abramović described how her [...] "mother took complete military-style control {{of me and}} my brother.
