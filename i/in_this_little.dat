It featured a short ballet called Ballet of the Nuns. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>little</b> ballet, scantily clad nuns rise from their graves to dance wantonly in the moonlight.

His performance was described as characteristically powerful in The Independent. He also played tabloid journalist Dave Dewston in the four-part BBC serial Murder, and prison officer Mike in the part-improvised single drama Out of Control. He researched the latter part by shadowing prison officers in a young offenders' institution for a week. At the beginning of 2003, he {{played the role of}} Richie MacGregor <b>in</b> <b>This</b> <b>Little</b> Life, a television drama about a mother who has to cope with her 16-week-premature baby. Morrissey researched premature births by speaking to paediatricians at the Royal Free Hospital in Hampstead.|$|E

The title track {{was influenced by}} Goldfrapp's [...] "idea of a wolf being whipped <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>little</b> Tudor house overlooking a snowy landscape". [...] "Oompa Radar", the seventh track, was inspired by Roman Polanski's 1966 film Cul-de-Sac. The cabaret-influenced song uses a flugelhorn and a cuckoo clock to switch between tempos. [...] "Utopia" [...] was released as the album's second single. The album closes with [...] "Horse Tears", a minimalist piano ballad with filtered vocals.|$|E

2500|$|Huntley's The Dream Child, a {{study of}} occult phenomena, was {{published}} in 1892 by the Arena Publishing Company, Boston. The story was written to especially set forth the philosophic truth of universal brotherhood and endless progression. After years of study and investigation, Huntley sought answers to the two age-long problems “What is Truth?” and “If a man die shall he live again?" [...] The philosophy described in The Dream Child was the view of Huntley, with the profound belief that the philosophy enunciated is the Truth. According to the Cleveland Daily Leader, [...] "Florence Huntley has taken a fancy to depict the life to come. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>little</b> book, nearly perfect but {{for a lack of}} the requisite imagination to firmly place before the reader the heavens and what they hold, a very daring project, a mother, after losing her daughter, goes into a mysterious trance-like condition, in which she sees and communications with the child in heaven. This continues for a good many years, until the child grows to girlhood, when a change in her surroundings makes it necessary for them to separate." ...|$|E

2500|$|Andrea Towers of Entertainment Weekly {{notes in}} her {{assessment}} of the review: [...] "Once Upon a Time has taken us pretty much everywhere {{in and out of}} fairy tale lore over the past five years: Storybrooke, the Enchanted Forest, Arendelle, Neverland. Tonight, with a return marking the show's midseason premiere, as well as its landmark 100th episode, Once gave us something old (daddy issues), something new (the Underworld), something borrowed (a potion) and something blue (that classic Hades hair)," [...] but later sums up the entire episode: [...] "I know we're going to be dealing with a lot of returning cast in the coming weeks, but admittedly, I was a wee bit let down by the fact this was touted as Once's big reunion episode, and the only significant people we saw from the past were Neal, Cora, and Pan. What I am happy about, though, is the prospect that Regina may end up being wholly important to this Underworld story line. Maybe she'll finally get an arc that's more than just waffling between good and evil. More importantly, it seems like everyone in the Underworld is either in cahoots with Hades or being manipulated by him in some way. Both Pan and Cora were keen on persuading their still-living significant family members, with Cora asking Regina to leave and Pan asking Rumple to save him. I'm interested in seeing exactly what's going on <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>little</b> corner of hell and exactly how Once is going to wade through this new road of storytelling.|$|E

Spanbauer {{took a job as}} an {{apartment}} building supervisor in the East Village, and began abusing alcohol and taking cocaine. He began writing The Man Who Fell in Love with the Moon in 1987, and by 1988 was deep into the manuscript. [...] The writing process was a very difficult one for Spanbauer. [...] He had so little money that he lived like [...] "a subway rat, pale and frail, trying hard to believe in" [...] the novel he was writing. He later said, [...] "A lot of the stuff I came up with was pretty fearsome, facing some personal devils head-on. I couldn't distinguish between the world and the book. At one point, I was so stressed out, I passed out in Penn Station." [...] As he told the Seattle Post-Intelligencer after the book's publication, [...] "It's all a matter of trust. You're {{right in the middle of}} this story. [...] You don't know the end of it. It's this preposterous tale about these preposterous people, and you don't know what's going to happen next, and you're tired of eating chicken livers and fettuccine, and you're alone <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>little</b> square concrete apartment, there's no air or earth, and pretty soon it was hard for me to distinguish what was going on in my head and what was going on on the outside."

2500|$|For a {{time the}} Creeks {{resisted}} mission work and schools, even outlawing Christianity and preaching. But in 1843, Rev. Robert [...] Loughridge was granted permission to open the Koweta Mission, primarily because Creek leaders recognized a need for education for their children. The Koweta Mission was well received by Creek families who sent their children to study there. Rev. Loughridge {{wrote in a letter}} to the white Creek agent, Colonel James Logan, which described the beginning of his work with the Creek people: [...] "Although the old chief at first had a manifested some fears of our religious influence interfering with their old customs, yet he gave us a cordial welcome, and requested me to locate the mission in his town. This I did and called the station Koweta, after the name of his home town. It was situated about 24 miles northwest of Fort Gibson, and one and one-half miles east of the Arkansas River. There was on the place selected a vacant Indian cabin 14x24 feet, with a dirt floor and covered with clapboards. Connected with it was a small unfenced field and a few fruit trees. For the whole premises, I paid the owner ten dollars. As planks could not be hauled a great distance, I had hired some men to split out 'luncheons' and floor the house. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>little</b> cabin we lived happily for more than a year, and in this cabin our first child was born. As by agreement I could only preach at the Mission station. My first object was to build a log house to answer the double purpose of school and church. As soon therefore as it was ready for use, my wife commenced teaching a school of fifteen or twenty children, and the neighbors were invited to attendance at the Mission, while the most of them were devotedly attached to their old customs and superstitions. The outlook was very discouraging." [...] The school operated for about 3 months until sickness and a lack of inadequate accommodations caused the school to be closed temporarily. After a while Rev. Loughridge started to overcome Indian objections and more and more Creeks began to attend his services. Loughridge's wife Olivia gave birth to her second child on September 5, 1845, unfortunately the nearest physician who lived in Fort Gibson was not in the area. Olivia died of puerperal fever on September 17, at the age of twenty-nine. One year later on September 26, 1846 the child died and was buried next to Olivia. Creek officials granted permission for a second school to be built called Tullahassee Mission. It was located 16 miles east of Koweta Mission and 10 miles west of Fort Gibson, it was completed in 1859. The Rev. and Mrs. William Robertson were in charge of this boarding school.|$|E
