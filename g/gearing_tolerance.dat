40|$|To {{ensure the}} gear precision, {{industries}} need a coherent model to express, to analyse and to check geometrical specifications. Most <b>gear</b> <b>tolerance</b> representations are directly {{driven by the}} convenience of dimensional metrology and not by the convenience of the set of activities of the tolerancing process. Therefore, to ensure the coherence of all tolerancing process activities, there is a necessity to develop a complete <b>gear</b> <b>tolerance</b> model which should: represent standard tolerance practices; be integrated in the Computer-Aided systems of design, manufacturing and metrology; be controlled by CMM; and support automated tolerance analysis. The proposed model extends capabilities of a vectorial dimensioning & tolerancing model {{in order to satisfy}} the four requirements. This model is based on GeoSpelling [1].

Theapproach {{is based upon the}} classical one-degree-of-freedom model, with backlash and time varying stiffness. Manufacturing errors are treated stochastically, starting from the knowledge of the <b>gear</b> <b>tolerance</b> class. A randomprofile error distribution is given for each tooth; then teeth errors are combined in order to span all possible reciprocalteeth contacts. The result is an analytical forcing, in terms of transmission error, which includes statistically the effect oflocal errors. Finally, a full dynamic analysis is carried out in the case of perfect and imperfect gears, in order to show theeffect of profile errors and their variance on the gear vibration...|$|R
40|$|To {{improve the}} {{tolerancing}} process {{in an industrial}} context, there exists a strong need for tolerance analysis to estimate the ppm (defected product per million - probability of scrap) in an acceptable computer time and managing {{the accuracy of the}} results. The developed approaches for <b>gear</b> <b>tolerance</b> analysis based on simulation, depend on the type of geometrical model - the Skin Model representation, and on the type of behavior model, which impact the accuracy of the results and the computer time of the simulation. Therefore, this paper proposes a comparison of four Skin Model representations (discrete shape, discrete shape with Vectorial Dimensioning & Tolerancing (VD&T), parametric surface, parametric surface with VD&T), and three Tooth Contact Analysis (TCA) techniques based on minimization of the distance between the two discrete representations of the two teeth, minimization of the distance between the two projected discrete representation in the meshing plane, simulation of tangency of tooth surfaces with a continuous representation being in mesh, regarding accuracy of results, computation time and the adequacy with the standard tolerance practices. The assessment of the accuracy of the results is based on a comparison between the numerical simulation results and the experimental results, and a comparison with the literature results. The assessment of the adequacy with the standard tolerance practices is based on the mapping between the parameters of the Skin Model representation and the standardized tolerances.

40|$|International audienceTolerancing {{decisions}} can profoundly {{impact the}} quality and cost of gears. To evaluate the impact of <b>tolerance</b> on <b>gear</b> quality, designers need to simulate the influences of tolerance {{with respect to the}} functional requirements. To do so, they use AGMA or ISO tables, or they perform experimentations. The first approach is not very flexible on the other hand the second approach is expensive. We have proposed an approach to analyze the tolerances.

40|$|International audienceThe {{purpose of}} {{functional}} tolerancing {{process is to}} define the geometrical specifications (tolerances) of parts ensuring functional requirements. An important distinction in tolerance process is that engineers are more commonly faced {{with the problem of}} tolerance synthesis rather than tolerance analysis. In tolerance analysis the parts tolerances are all known and the resulting geometrical requirement respect is calculated. In tolerance synthesis, on the other hand, the geometrical requirement is known from design requirements, whereas the magnitudes of the parts tolerances to meet these requirements are unknown. In this paper, we focus on the <b>gear</b> <b>tolerances,</b> and we propose an approach based statistical analysis for tolerance analysis and genetic algorithm for tolerance synthesis. Usually, statistical tolerance analysis uses a relationship between parts deviations and functional characteristics. In the case of <b>tolerance</b> analysis of <b>gears,</b> thus relationship is not available in analytic form, the determination of a functional characteristic (kinematic error,...) involves a numerical simulation. Therefore the Monte Carlo simulation, as the simplest and effectual method, is introduced into the frame. Moreover, to optimize the tolerance cost, genetic algorithm is improved. Indeed, this optimization problem is so complex that for traditional optimization algorithms it may be difficult or impossible to solve it because the objective function is not available in analytic form. For the evaluation of the fitness of each individual based on Monte Carlo simulation, the number of samples is the key of precision. By a large number of samples, the precision can be improved, but the computational cost will be increased. In order to reduce the computational cost of this optimization based on Monte Carlo simulation and genetic algorithms, the strategy is to adopt different precision of fitness; different numbers of samples during the optimization procedure are introduced into our algorithms...|$|R

40|$|To {{increase}} the absolute position accuracy of industrial robots {{it is necessary}} to identify the reasons for position errors. The calibration process realizes the specification of geometrical errors due to manufacturing <b>tolerances,</b> <b>gear</b> transmission errors and deviation of the kinematic elements due to compliance and elastic of gears. A sophistocate function for the motion planning is the spline interpolation. Given a path and path velocity the interpolation function realizes a jerk-free velocity profile. Basis for the interpolation are polynoms of higher order. An example is shown for a cubic spline. For tasks in which the robot is in contact with the work piece surface the actuator control must be done by force/torque controllers. Dependent on the specified task the controller must realize an appropriate control strategy. For deburring processes a hybrid position/force/torque control is presented, in which the activ force vectors can be switched by matrices.

40|$|Ultraviolet (UV) {{radiation}} suppresses systemic immunity. We explored these cellular {{mechanisms by}} exposing mice to systemically immunosuppressive doses of UV radiation and then analyzing cell phenotype and {{function in the}} lymphoid organs. Although UV radiation increased total cell number in the draining lymph nodes (DLN), it did not alter the activation state of dendritic cells (DC). Rather, UV radiation selectively activated lymph node B cells, with these cells being larger and expressing higher levels of both anti-major histocompatibility complex II and B 220 but not co-stimulatory molecules. This phenotype resembled that of a B cell <b>geared</b> toward immune <b>tolerance.</b> To test whether UV radiation-activated B cells were responsible for immunosuppression, DC and B cells were conjugated to antigen ex vivo and transferred into naïve hosts. Although DC by themselves activated T cells, when the B cells from UV radiation-irradiated mice were co-injected with DC, they suppressed DC activation of immunity. Interleukin (IL) - 10 -activated B cells also suppressed DC induction of immunity, suggesting that IL- 10 {{may be involved in}} this suppressive effect of UV radiation. These results demonstrate a new mechanism of UV radiation immunosuppression whereby UV radiation activates B cells in the skin-DLN that can suppress DC activation of T cell-mediated immunity...|$|R
40|$|External {{involute}} {{helical gears}} are usually manufactured through hobbing, commonly with a subsequent grinding or skiving operation. One way towards the industrial pursuit of more competitive and sustainable manufacturing {{is to reduce}} the number of processes, while retaining functionality and quality. In the hobbing of gears, the manufacturing errors are most often connected to the tool and/or the fixture. These errors need to be kept within tight tolerances to achieve sufficient quality of a finished hobbed gear. It would therefore be of great interest to be able to predetermine the quality of a finished hobbed <b>gear,</b> based on <b>tolerances</b> of the manufacturing process. Thereby the motivation is to analyze the impact of these errors, on the tooth surface of a hobbed gear. In this paper the manufacturing process is simulated, using an analytical geometric mathematical model, to determine the geometry of the hobbed gear tooth flank in three dimensions. Various errors, linked to the manufacturing process, are introduced in the software implementation of the mathematical model. An experimental study was performed, with errors of same type and magnitude, to validate the simulation results. The simulation model allows determining the geometry and the quality of the gear tooth, prior to manufacturing, at any section over both profile and helix...|$|R
40|$|One of the {{advantages}} of epicyclic transmissions is that the input torque is divided in a number of parallel paths. For n planet epicyclic system, each sun–planet–ring path is to transmit 1 /n of the input torque. However, this is only true in the ideal case when there is equal load sharing between all the planets in the epicyclic system. Because of manufacturing errors, equal load sharing is not possible and the degree of inequality in load sharing has major role for <b>gear</b> system sizing, <b>tolerancing</b> schemes, and torque ratings. Therefore {{it is important to understand}} the fundamental cause of the unequal load sharing behavior in epicyclic gear sets. Load sharing behavior is associated with positional errors causing one or more planets to lead or lag the other planets. When the error is positive the planet with error lead the other planet while when the error is negative planet with error lags the other planet. Several manufacturing errors can introduce positional errors. Some of the common contributors are carrier pinhole position error, planet size variation, and run out of the gears. A set of precision planetary gear set is selected with the objectives of experimental and theoretical investigation of the load sharing behavior by introducing the position errors for the planets, the load shared by each planet is estimated by maximum stresses induced in each pin. The results of the experimentation are then validated with the FEM (Finite Element method) results...|$|R
40|$|AbstractLow {{incidence}} of graft-versus-host disease provides the major rational for pursuing umbilical cord blood (UCB) stem cell transplantation (SCT). Considerable evidence also suggests {{a lower rate}} of recurrence after UCB SCT than after transplantation from adult donors. Recent advances in understanding of the human fetal immune development provide a rational underpinning for these clinical outcomes. The fetal immune system is <b>geared</b> toward maintaining <b>tolerance</b> to foreign antigens, particularly to the maternal antigens {{to which it is}} exposed throughout gestation. To this purpose it is dominated by a unique population of peripheral T regulatory cells that actively maintain tolerance. This and other features of the UCB lymphoid system explains the low {{incidence of}} graft-versus-host disease and superior outcomes of UCB SCT with noninherited maternal antigen–matched grafts. At the same time, highly sensitized maternal microchimeric cells are frequently detected in UCB and likely contribute to superior graft-versus-leukemia effects and low rates of disease recurrence in inherited paternal antigen–matched UCB recipients. However, historically erratic and slow hematopoietic recovery after UCB SCT leads to increased early morbidity and mortality, excessive hospitalization, and increased costs. This has held up the widespread utilization of UCB SCT in adults. Here we summarize recent data on UCB SCT with an emphasis on studies of co-infusion of adult CD 34 selected hematopoietic stem cells with UCB SCT. This procedure, through transient engraftment of adult hematopoietic stem cells, largely overcomes the problem of delayed engraftment. It also results in predictable engraftment of a UCB with the desired characteristics. We also briefly discuss unresolved issues and possible future applications of this technology...|$|R
40|$|Product {{tolerancing}} {{decisions made}} in product design {{have a significant}} effect on manufacturing environmental and cost performances by strongly influencing both the selection and operation of processing machinery. These decisions however are typically made without quantitative knowledge of their effects in manufacturing. With estimates of environmental and cost performances of manufacturing processes required to achieve specific part designs earlier in the product design cycle, designers may make more informed, and potentially better, design decisions with respect to manufacturing environmental and cost performance goals. In this thesis a method for quantifiably relating product tolerancing decisions to environmental and cost performances in manufacturing in order to provide decision support for cost and environmentally conscious design for manufacturing is developed. The method is instantiated as an Excel-based tool and exercised by two illustrative examples of increasing complexity, as well as a study of the manufacture of automotive transmission pinion <b>gears</b> with differing <b>tolerance</b> requirements. Uncertainty analysis is performed through the use of @RISK software; the uncertainty of parameters associated with manufacturing operations and machinery is captured through the use of probability density functions and Monte Carlo simulation is performed. Simulation results provide insight into the uncertainty of performance estimates and the risks associated with ensuing decision making. This method may be useful to product designers, as well as process planners, to support decision making efforts related to cost and environmental consciousness in the manufacturing phase of the product life cycle.

40|$|The modern {{requirements}} on power transmissions focus on energy efficiency, low noise and dynamic vibrations, and power density. In {{order to meet}} these requirements, the gear wheels must be manufactured to very high precision. Additionally, it should be economical to manufacture these gears within the tight requested <b>tolerances.</b> <b>Gears</b> manufactured within automotive, truck, and construction equipment are usually cut using milling tools. The profile accuracy and the surface roughness achieved after manufacturing, which determines the gear quality, {{are connected to the}} process parameters and possible manufacturing related errors. Prediction models to accurately determine gear quality, where tool and process related errors are taken into account, are needed in order to improve the manufacturing process. Tool life has also a strong economic impact in machining operations. Tool life prediction is an important part in optimization of the machining processes, where tool life is strongly connected the cutting forces and the geometry of the cut chips. In this work mathematical models are established in parametric form, based on analytical differential description. These models are developed in order to increase knowledge and understanding of the complex machining processes involved in gear manufacturing.
