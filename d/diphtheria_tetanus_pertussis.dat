40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis antibody titers after antineoplastic treatment and to suggest an appropriate vaccination approach for pediatric hemato-oncologic patients. A total of 146 children with either malignancy in remission after cessation of therapy or bone marrow failure were recruited. All children had received routine immunization including diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis vaccination before diagnosis of cancer. The serologic immunity to <b>diphtheria,</b> <b>tetanus</b> and <b>pertussis</b> was classified as: completely protective, partially protective, or non-protective. Non-protective serum antibody titer for <b>diphtheria,</b> <b>tetanus</b> and <b>pertussis</b> was detected in 6. 2 %, 11. 6 %, and 62. 3 % of patients, respectively, and partial protective serum antibody titer for <b>diphtheria,</b> <b>tetanus</b> and <b>pertussis</b> was seen in 37 %, 28. 1 %, and 8. 9 % of patients. There was no significant correlation between the severity of immune defect and age, gender or underlying disease. Revaccination after antineoplastic therapy showed significantly higher levels of antibody for each vaccine antigen. Our data indicates that a large proportion of children lacked protective serum concentrations of antibodies against <b>diphtheria,</b> <b>tetanus,</b> and <b>pertussis.</b> This suggests that reimmunization of these patients is necessary after completion of antineoplastic treatment. Also, prospective studies should be undertaken with the aim of devising a common strategy of revaccination...|$|R

40|$|This {{supplementary}} statement {{provides information}} on and recommendations {{for the use of}} <b>diphtheria</b> and <b>tetanus</b> toxoids and acellular pertussis vaccine (DTaP).

40|$|The {{combination}} of <b>diphtheria,</b> <b>tetanus,</b> and <b>pertussis</b> vaccines {{into a single}} product has been central {{to the protection of}} the pediatric population over the past 50 years. The addition of inactivated polio, Haemophilus influenzae, and hepatitis B vaccines into the combination has facilitated the introduction of these vaccines into recommended immunization schedules by reducing the number of injections required and has therefore increased immunization compliance. However, the development of these combinations encountered numerous challenges, including the reduced response to Haemophilus influenzae vaccine when given in combination; the need to consolidate the differences in the immunization schedule (hepatitis B); and the need to improve the safety profile of the <b>diphtheria,</b> <b>tetanus,</b> and <b>pertussis</b> combination. Here, we review these challenges and also discuss future prospects for combination vaccines...|$|R

50|$|In addition, IFFIm helped GAVI fund {{breakthrough}} vaccines {{quickly and}} securely. IFFIm financed more than 90% of the guaranteed payment to UNICEF for initial doses of a pentavalent vaccine which immunises against five infectious diseases: <b>diphtheria,</b> <b>tetanus,</b> <b>pertussis,</b> haemophilus influenzae type B (Hib) and hepatitis B. GAVI {{could not have}} made that commitment and upfront cash payment without IFFIm.|$|E
50|$|Effective {{vaccines}} for Haemophilus influenzae Type B {{have been}} available since the early 1990s, and is recommended for children under age 5 and asplenic patients. The World Health Organization recommends a pentavalent vaccine, combining vaccines against <b>diphtheria,</b> <b>tetanus,</b> <b>pertussis,</b> hepatitis B and Hib.

50|$|Hib {{vaccines}} {{cost about}} seven times {{the total cost}} of vaccines against measles, polio, tuberculosis, <b>diphtheria,</b> <b>tetanus,</b> and <b>pertussis.</b> Consequently, whereas 92% of the populations of developed countries was vaccinated against Hib as of 2003, vaccination coverage was 42% for developing countries, and only 8% for least-developed countries.|$|R
40|$|Immunization {{interventions}} {{taken over}} the years have influenced the epidemiology of the various diseases with a reduction in morbidity and generally a lower spreading of the corresponding infectious agents. In some cases, problems related to the length of protection provided by the vaccines and the consequent need not just to optimise vaccinations in newborns but also to plan booster vaccinations have been observed. Boosters are essential to avoid the creation of clusters of newly susceptible subjects among adolescents and adults, previously successfully vaccinated, due both to the decay of immunity and the reduced spreading of microrganisms. The 2005 - 2007 Italian National Vaccination Plan (INVP) has underlined the importance of reaching and maintaining high vaccination coverage rates in childhood and of planning booster vaccinations for <b>tetanus,</b> <b>diphtheria,</b> <b>pertussis</b> and polio, beginning from pre-school age and every ten years in adult life. Two timeframes of intervention have been identified: 5 - 6 years (for <b>tetanus,</b> <b>diphtheria,</b> <b>pertussis</b> and polio) and 11 - 15 years of age (for <b>tetanus,</b> <b>diphtheria</b> and <b>pertussis).</b> The availability of combined vaccines for <b>tetanus,</b> <b>diphtheria,</b> <b>pertussis</b> and polio boosters is therefore an important resource. Two products, differing in antigen content and indications for use (DTaP-IPV and dTap-IPV), have been developed for booster immunisation against <b>tetanus,</b> <b>diphtheria,</b> <b>pertussis</b> and polio. The combined DTaP-IPV and dTap-IPV vaccines, with an excellent safety and immunogenicity profile, represent an important resource to guarantee vaccination continuity...|$|R

5000|$|Since {{the first}} {{economic}} analysis of routine childhood immunizations in the United States in 2001 that reported cost savings over {{the lifetime of}} children born in 2001, other analyses of the economic costs and potential benefits to individuals and society have since been studied, evaluated, and calculated. In 2014, the American Academy of Pediatrics published a decision analysis that evaluated direct costs (program costs such as vaccine cost, administrative burden, negative vaccine-linked reactions, and transportation time lost to parents to seek health providers for vaccination). The study focused on <b>diphtheria,</b> <b>tetanus,</b> <b>pertussis,</b> Haemophilus influenza type b conjugate, poliovirus, measles/mumps/rubella (MMR), hepatitis B, varicella, 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate, hepatitis A, and rotavirus vaccines, but excluded influenza.
