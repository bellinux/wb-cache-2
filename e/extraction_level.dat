Air blast can result in injury to mine personnel, damage to equipment or disrupts mine operation. Evaluation of air blast parameters is, therefore, an essential part to develop strategies to mitigate the hazard. The properties of a muckpile or a caved zone are significant factors affecting the magnitude of air blast in particular on the undercut and <b>extraction</b> <b>levels.</b> This research investigates the effect of muckpile properties on air flow using the numerical code, PFC 2 D. The critical parameters such as thickness, block size and porosity (swell factor) of the muckpile have been studied to quantify how much they could change the magnitude of air pressures and velocities while the air flows through the muckpile. It {{was found that the}} porosity of the muckpile is the most effective parameter on the magnitude of air blast and by designing a thick layer of blasted rock with low porosity in the caved zone, the intensity of the air blast can be significantly reduced.
