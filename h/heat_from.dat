5|$|The {{standard}} {{method of cooling}} is passing a coolant (usually water) {{through a series of}} holes drilled through the mould plates and connected by hoses to form a continuous pathway. The coolant absorbs <b>heat</b> <b>from</b> the mould (which has absorbed <b>heat</b> <b>from</b> the hot plastic) and keeps the mould at a proper temperature to solidify the plastic at the most efficient rate.|$|E
5|$|There is a {{small power}} station {{comprising}} three Cummins B and C series diesel engines, offering an approx 150 kVa 3 phase supply {{to most of the}} island buildings. Waste <b>heat</b> <b>from</b> the engine jackets is used for a district heating pipe. There are also plans to collect the waste <b>heat</b> <b>from</b> the engine exhaust heat gases to feed into the district heat network to improve the efficiency further. The Power is normally switched off between 0000 and 0630.|$|E
5|$|Owing to air {{compression}} {{in front of}} the plane as it travelled at supersonic speed, the fuselage heated up and expanded by as much as 300mm (almost 1ft). The most obvious manifestation of this was a gap that opened up on the flight deck between the flight engineer's console and the bulkhead. On some aircraft that conducted a retiring supersonic flight, the flight engineers placed their caps in this expanded gap, wedging the cap when it shrank again. To keep the cabin cool, Concorde used the fuel as a heat sink for the <b>heat</b> <b>from</b> the air conditioning. The same method also cooled the hydraulics. During supersonic flight the surfaces forward from the cockpit became heated, and a visor was used to deflect much of this <b>heat</b> <b>from</b> directly reaching the cockpit.|$|E
40|$|Geoid {{anomalies}} {{and surface}} and lower-boundary topographies are calculated for numerically generated thermal convection for an infinite Prandtl number, Boussinesq, axisymmetric spherical fluid shell with constant gravity and viscosity, for <b>heating</b> both entirely <b>from</b> below and entirely from within. Convection solutions are obtained for Rayleigh numbers Ra up to 20 times the critical Ra in <b>heating</b> <b>from</b> below and 27 times critical for <b>heating</b> <b>from</b> within. Geoid parallels surface undulations, and boundary deformation generally increases with increasing cell wavelength. Dimensionless geoid and topography in <b>heating</b> <b>from</b> below are about 5 {{times greater than}} in <b>heating</b> <b>from</b> within. Values for <b>heating</b> <b>from</b> within correlate more closely with geophysical data than values <b>from</b> <b>heating</b> <b>from</b> below, suggesting a predominance of internal heating in the mantle. The study emphasizes that dynamically induced topography and geoid {{are sensitive to the}} mode of heating in the earth's mantle...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{instability}} of {{a layer of}} fluid confined between two horizontal parallel planes and <b>heated</b> <b>from</b> above or below under the action of a gravitational field varying with height is investigated analytically. It is found that if gravity remains downward (upward) throughout the flow domain, neutral modes do not exist. A sufficient condition for stability of a layer <b>heated</b> <b>from</b> above is that gravity remain directed downward over a sufficiently {{large part of the}} flow domain. A circle theorem limiting the growth rate of a arbitrary oscillatory mode (whether stable, neutral or unstable) is established. A sufficient condition for {{instability of}} a layer <b>heated</b> <b>from</b> below is found to be that gravity remain directed downward and the gravity profile have concave curvature throughout most of the flow domain. For a linearly varying gravity field with the downward gravitational acceleration increasing with height or decreasing with height slowly, (i) a layer <b>heated</b> <b>from</b> above is stable, (ii) a layer <b>heated</b> <b>from</b> below is unstable, and (iii) the circle theorem is modified depending on whether the gravitational acceleration is increasing or decreasing with height...|$|R

5|$|After the cyclone has passed, devastation often continues. Standing {{water can}} cause the spread of disease, and {{transportation}} or communication infrastructure may have been destroyed, hampering clean-up and rescue efforts. Nearly two million people have died globally due to tropical cyclones. Despite their devastating effects, tropical cyclones are also beneficial, by potentially bringing rain to dry areas and moving <b>heat</b> <b>from</b> the tropics poleward.

5|$|As {{with other}} welding {{processes}} such as gas metal arc welding, shielding gases are necessary in GTAW to protect the welding area from atmospheric gases such as nitrogen and oxygen, which can cause fusion defects, porosity, and weld metal embrittlement if they {{come in contact with}} the electrode, the arc, or the welding metal. The gas also transfers <b>heat</b> <b>from</b> the tungsten electrode to the metal, and it helps start and maintain a stable arc.|$|E
5|$|Clouds {{intercept}} both <b>heat</b> <b>from</b> the sun {{and heat}} radiated from the Earth. Their effects are complex and vary in time, location, and altitude. Usually during the daytime the interception of sunlight predominates, giving a cooling effect; however, at night the re-radiation of heat to the Earth slows the Earth's heat loss, this causes storms and subsequent flood rains and flooding.|$|E
50|$|The {{atmosphere}} is <b>heated</b> <b>from</b> below, {{which leads to}} convection, the largest expression {{of which is the}} Hadley circulation. By contrast the ocean is <b>heated</b> <b>from</b> above, which tends to suppress convection. Instead ocean deep water is formed in polar regions where cold salty waters sink in fairly restricted areas. This {{is the beginning of the}} thermohaline circulation.|$|R

5|$|Dimetrodon was {{probably}} one of the apex predators of the Cisuralian ecosystems, feeding on fish and tetrapods, including reptiles and amphibians. Smaller Dimetrodon species may have had different ecological roles. The sail of Dimetrodon may have been used to stabilize its spine or to heat and cool its body as a form of thermoregulation. Some recent studies argue that the sail would have been ineffective at removing <b>heat</b> <b>from</b> the body, and was most likely used in courtship display.|$|E

The Comet's high cabin pressure and fast operating speeds were unprecedented in commercial aviation, making its fuselage design an experimental process.

This external heating differs from the internal heat source for volcanism on Earth, which {{is a result of}} radioactive isotope decay and residual <b>heat</b> <b>from</b> accretion. In the Earth, these internal heat sources drive mantle convection, which in turn causes volcanism through plate tectonics.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} found that the western cicada killer wasp is capable of {{thermoregulation}} which enables them to maintain territories during the day. A study by Joseph R.

Dead wasps that were placed in the sun reached abnormally high temperatures when compared to those on nearby plants.|$|E
