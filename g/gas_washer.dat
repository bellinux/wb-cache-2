The {{purification system}} was mainly composed of spray tower, <b>gas</b> <b>washer</b> and desulfurizer. The product gas suffered from purification process and was combusted at flare stack. Partial the syngas flow was led to the online gas chromatograph for component analysis. Before the sample gas entered into chromatographic columns it need be further purified by the dehumidifier and gas filter made of quartz.|$|E

40|$|To {{examine the}} {{suitability}} for use of different absorbers for desulphurisation, a technical-scale experimental plant was erected for operating conditions of 20 bar and a maximum of 730 C. The site for this plant is the Technical-Scale Test Hall of the RWE Company for Research and Development (RFE) {{on the site of}} DEA Mineraloel AG, UK Wesseling Works. RFE was entrusted with erecting the technical-scale plant and carrying out the experiments. The crude gases of an HTW gasifier with air or oxygen/steam operation are simulated by mixing desulphurized synthetic gas from oil pressure gasification with nitrogen and carbon dioxide. Setting different hydrogen sulphide, ammonia and water contents is done by dosing and joint evaporation of suitably concentrated ammonium hydrogen sulphide solutions. There is a heated mixing chamber and a superheater identical to the evaporator after the evaporator, where the gases can be heated to a maximum of 650 C. These flow into the reactor (inside diameter 60 mm, clear height 1360 mm) from the top, via a heated transfer pipe. To measure the temperature profile, there is a pipe with a total of 12 thermocouples in the reactor longitudinal axis. Below the absorbent heap, a heated analysis pipe opens into the reactor, through which a part flow of the gas flows to the analysers after pressure relieving. The main flow of the hot gas is cooled to 180 C in a sulphur cooler after the reactor and then reaches the water cooler via the sulphur separator and the pressure control valve. The separated condensate is locked out via the water separator, while the gases either flow directly to the torch or reach a <b>gas</b> <b>washer.</b> To regenerate the absorber, a gas containing oxygen (air/nitrogen or air/steam mixture) or steam is passed through the reactor along the same route. (orig. /GL) Vorliegender Abschlussbericht fasst die Ergebnisse der Untersuchungen im Rahmen des EGKS-Vorhabens 7220 -ED/ 106 'Technikumsversuche zur Heissgasentschwefelung des Rohgases eines HTW-Vergasers im Hinblick auf die Integration in ein Kombikraftwerk' zusammen. Die Rohgase eines HTW-Vergasers bei Luft- bzw. Sauerstoff/Dampf-Fahrweise werden durch Mischen von entschwefeltem Synthesegas aus einer Oeldruckvergasung mit Stickstoff und Kohlendioxid simuliert. Die Einstellung unterschiedlicher Schwefelwasserstoff-, Ammoniak- und Wassergehalte erfolgt durch Zudosieren und gemeinsames Verdampfen entsprechend konzentrierter Ammoniumhydrogensulfid-Loesungen. Hinter dem Verdampfer befindet sich eine beheizte Mischkammer sowie ein zum Verdampfer baugleicher Ueberhitzer, in dem die Gase auf maximal 650 C aufgeheizt werden koennen. Ueber eine beheizte Transferleitung stroemen diese von oben in den Reaktor (Innendurchmesser 60 mm, lichte Hoehe 1360 mm). Zur Erfassung des Temperaturprofils befindet sich in der Reaktorlaengsachse ein Huellrohr mit insgesamt 12 Thermoelementen. Unterhalb der Sorbensschuettung muendet eine beheizte Analysenleitung in den Reaktor, ueber die nach Entspannung ein Teilstrom des Gases zu den Analysatoren stroemt. Der Hauptstrom des heissen Gases wird nach dem Reaktor im Schwefelkuehler auf 180 C abgekuehlt und gelangt ueber den Schwefelabscheider und das Druckregelventil zum Wasserkuehler. Das abgeschiedene Kondensat wird ueber den Wasserabscheider ausgeschleust, waehrend die Gase entweder direkt zur Fackel stroemen bzw. in einen Gaswaescher gelangen.

40|$|Energy {{and global}} warming indices for ten major {{appliances}} have been examined. A two-page summary report for each appliance category has been written {{as well as a}} combined summary for major appliances. The appliances studied are: refrigerators, room air conditioners (RACs), freezers, gas ranges, electric ranges, microwave ovens, clothes <b>washers,</b> <b>gas</b> dryers, electric dryers, and dishwashers. This report contains copies of the summary reports, bibliographical data, assumptions, and data tables developed by this investigation. Computational spreadsheets have been developed that allows new data to be easily incorporated for future reports. In general terms, most major appliance categories have reduced energy requirements over the past two decades. At the same time, increased appliance production causes overall energy demand {{and global warming}} effects to remain relatively constant. "Direct" global warming effects decrease significantly after the year 2010 as appliances using chlorinated refrigerants (primarily R 11 and R 12) are scrapped...|$|R
40|$|Performing {{accurate}} vehicle vibration simulations {{is imperative}} to understanding the adequacy of a packaged product’s ability to withstand the rigors of transportation. Over the past several years, various vehicle vibration analysis techniques have been proposed {{in order to provide}} better correlation to actual field shipments. Some of these new techniques allow for the vibration data collected to be analyzed in a manner that reduces the duration of the laboratory vibration simulation. This paper discusses the discoveries made when an independent laboratory utilized these techniques to reduce test durations for vertical vibration simulation. A field data recorder was employed to collect and record over-the-road vibration of a fully loaded steel spring truck traveling over interstates and highways. The collected data was analyzed independently for each of the different simulation techniques and the resulting simulations were conducted using a servo-hydraulic vibration table. This paper is unique in it evaluates the simulation techniques using actual packaged products, and by use of a damage assessment tool, determines how well the techniques correlated with actual field study results. The three packaged products used for these evaluations were as follows: top-mount refrigerator, electric hedge trimmer, and <b>gas</b> powered pressure <b>washer.</b> Results indicate it is possible to reduce the vibration test durations during vertical vibration simulation, while still correlating with results collected from field studies...|$|R
