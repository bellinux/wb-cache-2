60|$|For {{some days}} {{the mother and}} her two daughters lived very happily together, for Lizina had given them {{everything}} she had brought away except her golden clothing, for that would not come off, {{in spite of all}} the efforts of her sister, who was madly jealous of her good fortune. The golden star, too, could not be removed <b>from</b> <b>her</b> forehead. But all the gold pieces she drew <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>pockets</b> had found their way to her mother and sister.|$|R

6000|$|I saw the indignation {{rising in}} the old woman's face. She was insulted. This boy was making fun of her. That was her thought. She thrust her hands into <b>her</b> <b>pockets</b> and {{straightened}} up {{to give him a}} piece of her mind. Her temper was all up, and hot. Her mouth came open and let out three words of a bitter sentence,... then it fell silent, and the anger in her face turned to surprise or wonder or fear, or something, and she slowly brought out <b>her</b> hands <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>pockets</b> and opened them and held them so. In one was my piece of money, in the other lay four silver groschen. She gazed a little while, perhaps to see if the groschen would vanish away; then she said, fervently: ...|$|R

25|$|As a child, Birley {{developed}} {{an interest in}} geology and on her family holidays on the Isle of Man she would collect stones showing unusual peculiarities.

60|$|At this suggestion, {{every one}} set about an examination. The result was, that neither Mrs. Budd nor Rose had a {{particle}} of food, of any sort, about their persons. Biddy produced <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>pockets,</b> however, a whole biscuit, a large bunch of excellent raisins {{that she had}} filched from the steward's stores, and two apples,--the last being the remains of some fruit that Spike had procured a month earlier in New York. Mulford had half a biscuit, at {{which he had been}} accustomed to nibble in his watches; and Jack lugged out, along with a small plug of tobacco, a couple of sweet oranges. Here, then, was everything in the shape of victuals or drink, that could be found for the use of five persons, in all probability for many days. The importance of securing it for equal distribution, was so obvious, that Mulford's proposal to do so met with a common assent. The whole was put in Mrs. Budd's bag, and she was intrusted with the keeping of this precious store.|$|R

Then beating the damaru and holding the kapala in her hand she made a mystic dance while gazing into the sky.

50|$|There {{were many}} {{challenges}} and obstacles throughout {{the early years}} of Brooke’s efforts.

Driscoll paid the initial $500 deposit out of her personal funds, and when fundraising efforts fell far short (only raising slightly over $1,000 of the needed $4,500), Driscoll paid the balance of the $4,500 <b>from</b> <b>her</b> own <b>pocket.</b>|$|R
60|$|Philip did {{not find}} living in Paris as cheap {{as he had been}} led to believe and by February had spent most of the money with which he started. He was too proud to appeal to his guardian, nor did he wish Aunt Louisa to know that his {{circumstances}} were straitened, since he was certain she would make an effort to send him something <b>from</b> <b>her</b> own <b>pocket,</b> and he knew how little she could afford to. In three months he would attain his majority and come into possession of his small fortune. He tided over the interval by selling the few trinkets which he had inherited from his father.|$|R
