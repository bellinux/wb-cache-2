A combined fixed-wing and helicopter hangar {{was completed in}} 1983. The contract changed to Lufttransport from 1984. Operations remained limited and in 1989 the airport only saw 34 helicopter flights. The exploration resulted in a positive <b>find</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Norne field, which started production in 1997. Norsk Helikopter, later renamed Bristow Norway, established a helicopter base at Brønnøysund Airport n 2002 and took over flights to the Skarv Oil Field.|$|E
5|$|The diet of {{the bird}} can be varied. They eat various forms of foliage and other grassy {{material}} that they <b>find</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground on in trees and shrubs. Dusky woodswallows have been seen eating termites, butterflies and other insects. They also eat nectar from flowers. One notable aspect of their feeding habits {{is the way they}} hunt flying insects, which is done by picking them up on their wing. They do, however, also eat their prey from the ground, and they often find inconspicuous places to perch while waiting for prey, such as utility lines and the like. They have also been observed engaging in kleptoparasitism, working as a group to rob a restless flycatcher of its prey. Kleptoparasitism is extremely unusual in passerine birds, as is cooperative kleptoparasitsim in general.|$|E
5|$|In 1957, American News Company, by far {{the largest}} {{magazine}} distributor, was liquidated. Almost all the science-fiction magazines had to find a new distributor, and the smaller independent companies remaining in the market often demanded monthly publication and a larger format from the magazines they took on. Many of the magazines did not have the advertising revenue required to support these changes, and within two or three years, many of them had disappeared: the number of science-fiction magazines being published dropped from a high of 46 in 1953 to less than a dozen {{by the end of the}} decade. For a while If was hard to <b>find</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> news stands, but it survived. Quinn did try the slick format (using glossy paper, unlike the cheaper paper used for pulps and digests) for a companion magazine, Space Age, which he launched in November 1958; the experiment was unsuccessful, however. In an attempt to improve Ifs circulation, Quinn hired writer Damon Knight, whose first issue was October 1958. Circulation failed to increase, though this was at least partly due to the problems with distribution, and by early 1959, Quinn decided to sell the magazine. Knight's last issue was his third, dated February 1959.|$|E

500|$|According to {{lead singer}} Gruff Rhys the track is [...] "a song about gambling" [...] and was {{originally}} {{going to be}} left off Hey Venus! for being [...] "too generic" [...] before Rough Trade boss Geoff Travis persuaded the band to reconsider their decision.

West wrote that The Face was {{on the same level}} as the works of Jamie xx, Bobby Tank and SBTRKT, making Disclosure [...] "the country's most exciting new producers". He also honored the EP for being one of the few releases to combine different styles together [...] "cleverly". Jackson also compared The Face to SBTRKT's material, given that the record successfully works for both a club environment and a mainstream pop audience. However, his major criticisms were that all the tracks were too similar to each other, a problem further hurt by the EP's longer-than-20-minute runtime, and the vocal features were [...] "underwhelming". One negative review from a Drowned in Sound critic called The Face a [...] "disappointing miscalculation of overegged trends with little real personality of its own" [...] that could only be enjoyed in a club setting, writing that the same [...] "soulfulness" [...] that was a major part of music by Joy Orbison was hard to <b>find</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> EP.|$|E
500|$|Harold Edward Elliott {{was born}} 19 June 1878 in West Charlton, Victoria, the third son and fifth child of eight {{children}} of a farmer and prospector, Thomas Elliott, and his wife Helen, née Janvrin. To his family, he was nicknamed [...] "Harkey". He {{grew up on the}} family farms, and attended the local school, known as the Rock Tank. In 1894, his father was one of six men who made a sensational <b>find</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> goldfields at Coolgardie, Western Australia. They sold their claim to the Earl of Fingall for £180,000 and a sixth interest. Fingall then floated it in London as a company valued at £700,000. This changed the family's circumstances. Debts were paid, and the farms acquired outright. The family moved to a new house named [...] "Elsinore" [...] near Lake Wendouree in Ballarat, Victoria. In January 1895, Elliott commenced at Ballarat College, a private Presbyterian boys' school, where one of the school houses, [...] "Elliott", is now named after him. [...] Despite concerns about the adequacy of his Rock Tank education, Elliott topped his class in Latin, bookkeeping, and Bible studies in his first year. He topped the class in seven of his eight subjects in 1896, and went on to become dux of the school in 1897.|$|E
500|$|The first {{performances}} of She Has a Name in the United States were produced by FreeFall Stage {{in a rented}} space at Victory Life Church in Folsom, California in 2014 {{under the direction of}} Emma Eldridge, who was a 23-year-old college student at the time. She and her sister had become passionate about the issue of human trafficking {{as a result of their}} involvement with the organization Run for Courage, and the two sisters considered writing a play about human trafficking in the United States. Because they were both college students, they did not find the time to write a play, so in 2013, their mother, Deedee Eldridge, began looking for a human-trafficking-related play that had already been written and she discovered She Has a Name. It was the only play she was able to <b>find</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> subject of human trafficking. Emma Eldridge later said of She Has a Name, [...] "I've never read something and been so compelled to do it." [...] The family decided to stage the play, and Deedee Eldridge served as producer and executive director. To have the rights to produce the play, FreeFall Stage made a special arrangement with the Playwrights Guild of Canada.|$|E

500|$|Until he was fifteen, Elgar {{received}} a general education at Littleton (now Lyttleton) House school, near Worcester. However, his only formal musical training beyond piano and violin lessons from local teachers consisted of more advanced violin studies with Adolf Pollitzer, during brief visits to London in 1877–78. Elgar said, [...] "my first music was learnt in the Cathedral ... from books {{borrowed from the}} music library, when I was eight, nine or ten." [...] He worked through manuals of instruction on organ playing and read every book he could <b>find</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> theory of music. He later {{said that he had}} been most helped by Hubert Parry's articles in the Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians. Elgar began to learn German, in the hope of going to the Leipzig Conservatory for further musical studies, but his father could not afford to send him. Years later, a profile in The Musical Times considered that his failure to get to Leipzig was fortunate for Elgar's musical development: [...] "Thus the budding composer escaped the dogmatism of the schools." [...] However, it was a disappointment to Elgar that on leaving school in 1872 he went not to Leipzig but to the office of a local solicitor as a clerk. He did not find an office career congenial, and for fulfilment he turned not only to music but to literature, becoming a voracious reader. Around this time, he made his first public appearances as a violinist and organist.|$|E
500|$|Napoleon faced Archduke Charles's Austrian army at the Battle of Eckmühl, on 21–22 April 1809. On 22 April, {{the second}} day of the battle, Nansouty was at first sent to the Schierling plain, in support of Bavarian General Deroy, who, after several failed attempts, managed to take the town of Eckmühl from the enemy. Apart from the Schierling plain, the terrain at Eckmühl was very uneven and hilly, with dangerously steep slopes, which made cavalry action here improper. Yet, it was here that one of the most memorable cavalry actions of the entire Napoleonic Wars was to take place. It all began on the slopes next to Eckmühl, where a first brief cavalry {{engagement}} occurred, as Bavarian and Württemberger cavalry encountered and charged Austrian cavalry. The Austrians won out and the Bavarians and Württembergers retreated and reformed in the vicinity of the two French heavy cavalry divisions present. These two divisions, the 1st under Nansouty (1st and 2nd Carabiniers-à-cheval, 2nd, 3rd, 9th and 12th Cuirassiers) and the 2nd under Saint-Sulpice (four regiments strong), were placed next to one another, forming five lines, with their regiments in column, one in front of the other. These men were ordered forward, up the slope and onto the plateau where the light cavalry had been repulsed moments earlier. Arriving on the plateau at a gallop, the cavalry overtook Marshal Lannes's infantry, who admiringly cheered [...] "Vive les cuirassiers" [...] ("Long live the cuirassiers") and applauded as the cavalry galloped past them,. With their two frontline regiments now deployed in line and with the German light cavalry protecting their flanks, the two heavy cavalry divisions clashed into whatever Austrian cavalry they could <b>find</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> plateau, repulsing them with ease. This was, however, only the prelude of a much larger cavalry combat.|$|E
500|$|Part of the game's {{concept is}} {{a balance between}} puzzle-solving and perception, giving the player the freedom to explore The Witnesss world and {{creating}} a non-linear approach to gameplay. Two of the first puzzles Blow had created involved [...] "clues in objects that populate the world", which led him to recognize he needed to create a world to support these puzzles. This would form a dichotomy between exploration and puzzle solving, which [...] "made a lot of sense" [...] to Blow. Blow created the island as open world, so that players can leave puzzles they are stuck at and work at other ones, as to avoid punishing the player {{for not being able}} to solve a key puzzle, a common issue with other adventure games according to Blow. Blow wanted puzzles to be clearly presented in the open and without any red herrings, an approach he had taken with Braid. Exploration is encouraged through the game's narrative, which are told by audio logs the player can <b>find</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> unpopulated island; through these, Blow attempted to create a [...] "feeling of loneliness in a beautiful space" [...] for the player. Because these logs can be found in any order, Blow hopes that each player may have a different perception of the narrative depending on how they have approached the game. Initially, these audio logs were to be more story-driven, but Blow opted later to change these out for more obfuscated and obtuse information, similar to the text elements used in Braid, as to avoid directly relating out the story of the game for the player and let them think about what the narrative means instead. Blow's team designed the narrative that those that solve more of the puzzles will gain more of a concrete understanding of the story.|$|E

500|$|Reviews were mixed, and {{the camp}} tone had a mostly {{negative}} reaction. The film currently has a 67% [...] "fresh" [...] rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Connery was applauded by Kevin A. Ranson of MovieCrypt and Michael A. Smith of Nolan's Pop Culture. Critic Roger Ebert noted, {{in a positive}} review, the irrelevance of the plot and [...] "moments of silliness", such as Bond finding himself driving a moon buggy with antennae revolving and robot arms flapping. He praised the Las Vegas car chase scene, particularly the segment when Bond drives the Mustang on two wheels. Twenty-five years after its release, James Berardinelli criticised {{the concept of a}} laser-shooting satellite and the performances of Jill St. John, Norman Burton and Jimmy Dean. Christopher Null called St. John [...] "one of the least effective Bond girls – beautiful, but shrill and helpless". Steve Rhodes said, [...] "looking and acting like a couple of pseudo-country bumpkins, they (Putter Smith and Bruce Glover) seem to have wandered by accident from the adjoining sound stage into the filming of this movie." [...] But he also extolled the car chase as [...] "classic". According to Danny Peary, Diamonds are Forever is [...] "one of the most forgettable movies of the entire Bond series" [...] and that [...] "until Blofeld's reappearance we must watch what is no better than a mundane diamond-smuggling melodrama, without the spectacle we associate with James Bond: the Las Vegas setting isn't exotic enough, there's little humour, assassins Mr. Kidd and Mr. Wint are similar to characters you'd <b>find</b> <b>on</b> <b>The</b> Avengers, but not nearly as amusing – and the trouble Bond gets into, even Maxwell Smart could escape." [...] IGN chose it as the third worst James Bond film, behind only The Man with the Golden Gun and Die Another Day. Total Film listed Mr. Wint and Mr. Kidd, and Bambi and Thumper, as the first and second worst villains in the Bond series (respectively). The film was more positively received by Xan Brooks of the Guardian, who said it was [...] "oddly brilliant, the best of the bunch: the perfect bleary Bond film for an imperfect bleary western world." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Mathura sculptures {{incorporate}} many Hellenistic elements, such as {{the general}} idealistic realism, and key design elements {{such as the}} curly hair, and folded garment.

Also, facial types also tend to become more Indianized.
