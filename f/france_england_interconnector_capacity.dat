50|$|The UK grid is {{connected}} as a wide area synchronous grid nominally running at 50 hertz. There are also undersea interconnections to northern France (HVDC Cross-Channel), Northern Ireland (HVDC Moyle), the Isle of Man (Isle of Man to <b>England</b> <b>Interconnector),</b> the Netherlands (BritNed) and the Republic of Ireland (EirGrid).|$|R
50|$|Since 1999, the Isle of Man has {{received}} electricity through the world's longest submarine AC cable, the 90 kV Isle of Man to <b>England</b> <b>Interconnector,</b> {{as well as}} from a natural gas power station in Douglas, an oil power station in Peel and a small hydro-electric power station in Sulby Glen.|$|R
50|$|In December 2007, the Manx Electricity Authority and its {{telecoms}} subsidiary, e-llan Communications, {{commissioned the}} lighting {{of a new}} undersea fibre-optic link. It was laid in 1999 between Blackpool and Douglas {{as part of the}} Isle of Man to <b>England</b> <b>Interconnector</b> which connects the Manx electricity system to the UK's National Grid.|$|R
50|$|The UK grid is {{connected}} to adjacent European and Irish electrical grids by submarine power cables, including for links to northern France (HVDC Cross-Channel), Northern Ireland (HVDC Moyle), Republic of Ireland (East-West Interconnector), the Isle of Man (Isle of Man to <b>England</b> <b>Interconnector),</b> and the Netherlands (BritNed). There are also plans to lay cables to link the UK with Iceland and Norway (Scotland-Norway interconnector) in the future.|$|R
50|$|The National Grid is the {{high-voltage}} {{electric power}} transmission network in Great Britain, connecting power stations and major substations and ensuring that electricity generated anywhere in mainland England, Scotland and Wales {{can be used to}} satisfy demand elsewhere. There are also undersea interconnections to northern France (HVDC Cross-Channel), Northern Ireland (HVDC Moyle), the Isle of Man (Isle of Man to <b>England</b> <b>Interconnector),</b> the Netherlands (BritNed) and the Republic of Ireland (EWIC).|$|R
40|$|Interconnections {{can be an}} {{effective}} way to increase competition in wholesale electricity markets in particular for smaller markets with few actors. This paper quantitatively examines the potentials for interconnections in the Irish Single Electricity Market (SEM). We use a time-varying Kalman filter technique to assess the degree of market integration between SEM and other large, mature and interconnected wholesale electricity markets in Europe. The results indicate a low degree of market integration between SEM and other European markets and thereby raising the possibility to benefit from increased electricity trade. As wholesale prices in SEM remain relatively high and volatile; a larger <b>interconnector</b> <b>capacity</b> can promote competition, close the gap with the European wholesale prices, improve security of supply, and mitigate price volatility. The results indicate that wholesale spot trading of renewable may not increase market integration. The results suggest that an <b>interconnector</b> <b>capacity</b> amounting to about 21 % of generation capacity in SEM is likely to achieve an integration coefficient of 0. 86 similar to what currently exists between the markets in Austria and the Netherlands. ...|$|R
50|$|The Isle of Man to <b>England</b> <b>Interconnector</b> is a {{submarine}} power cable connecting the transmission {{system of the}} Manx Electricity Authority to that of Great Britain. With an undersea section of approximately 104 km, it is the longest AC undersea cable in the world. It was laid in 1999 between Bispham, Blackpool, England, and Douglas Head on the Isle of Man, commencing commercial operations in November 2000. It is capable of continuous operation of 40 MW at 90 kV.|$|R

40|$|Integrating {{national}} {{markets is}} a major regulatory target in the European en-ergy market. Yet, wholesale prices for electricity still differ significantly. Whether these price differences are caused only by limited <b>interconnector</b> <b>capacities</b> or also by lack of cross-border competition, is an open question. To address this ques-tion, we develop {{a new approach to}} determine to which extent price differences stem from limited participation in cross-border trade. We derive a theoretical in-tegration benchmark, using Grossman’s (1976) notion of a rational expectations equilibrium. We compare the benchmark to data from European electricity mar-kets. The data reject the integration hypothesis and indicate that well informed traders do not engage in cross-border trade...|$|R
40|$|Scarce <b>interconnector</b> <b>capacities</b> are {{a severe}} {{obstacle}} to transregional competition and a unified market for {{electricity in the}} European Union. However, physically the interconnectors are rarely used up to capacity. This {{is due to the}} fact that the current allocation schemes make only limited use of the fact that currents in opposing directions cancel out. We propose a "netting" auction mechanism which makes use of this and in which even small transmission capacities can generate large competitive pressure in adjacent markets. Netting increases the usage of capacity and reduces the auctioneer's incentive to withhold capacity from the auction.

40|$|Abstract: The {{problem of}} optimal {{management}} {{of a water}} reservoir by a hydropower producer is necessarily a dynamic one since water can be transferred between periods. A hydropower producer being a monopolist cannot reduce output in the classical way without spilling water. He will follow a strategy of setting marginal revenues equal between time periods and thus shift water from relatively inelastic periods to relatively elastic ones. If the monopolist has thermal capacity the strategy is the same, but the utilization of thermal capacity is reduced. If the monopolist has control over external trade import is reduced and export increased compared with the social solution. Technical constraints of limited reservoir and <b>interconnector</b> <b>capacity</b> and a competitive fringe may reduce markedly the consequences of exercising market power...|$|R

This paper surveys the issues currently under discussion and provides a framework for the remaining papers in this issue. We conclude that signalling the efficient location of generation investment might require even a competitive LMP system to be complemented with deep connection charges. Although a Europe-wide LMP system is desirable, it appears politically problematic, so an integrated system of market coupling, possibly evolving by voluntary participation, should have high priority. Merchant investors {{may be able to}} increase <b>interconnector</b> <b>capacity,</b> although this is not unproblematic and raises new regulatory issues. A key issue that needs further research is how to better incentivize TSOs, especially with respect to cross-border issues...|$|R

40|$|Using {{generating}} {{and demand}} resources across national borders brings synergies and improves supply adequacy in Europe as a whole. However, national capacity remuneration mechanisms (CRMs) may pose barriers for {{the participation of}} energy resources across borders. This ultimately challenges {{the idea of a}} common internal market. Given the current experience with the newly imposed CRMs, indeed the integration of foreign capacities seems challenging as certain regulatory requirements, for instance on <b>interconnector</b> <b>capacity,</b> have to be met. Although all current CRMs in the EU are explicitly of temporary nature, given the current divergence in EU power market design, the question will be not whether but how to agree and coordinate on different forms of capacity remuneration in the EU for the years to come...|$|R
