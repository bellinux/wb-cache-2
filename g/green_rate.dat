" Includes bibliography. Illustrations and maps. Approved: Dr. John Katers, Major Professor and Dr. Gregory J. Davis, Director of Graduate Studies; thesis committee members: Dr. Steven J. Meyer, Robert D. Benninghoff. LC classification: TJ 828. Print version: OCLC# 884963872. Wind turbines are an increasing source of renewable electricity generation. This increase can be attributed in part to growth in voluntary renewable energy markets. Those who contribute to the voluntary market before a potential crossover point (where the cost of renewable energy is {{less than that of}} after than non-renewable generation) are providing a benefit to all who use the energy market in the future, because contributions to the voluntary market allow for the purchase of renewable capacity that will be operational for several decades. In order for contributors to the voluntary energy market to financially benefit from their contributions, the cost of wind energy could be fixed by establishing a <b>green</b> <b>rate.</b> In order to accurately fix a <b>green</b> <b>rate</b> based on wind, the uncertainty regarding monthly wind energy generation and capacity availability must be analyzed. This study explored methods that estimate monthly wind energy generation and capacity values with associated levels of certainty on those values. The results suggest that even with robust data sets (20 + years), the sample size of the monthly data is too low to accurately estimate the quantiles needed for the 95 % confidence level. The bootstrap method of simulating additional months succeeded in more completely populating the extreme quantiles and succeeded when compared with the holdout year. In regards to capacity, this study suggests that no capacity can be counted on from a single wind facility at a 95 % level of certainty. In summary, it is concluded that a single wind project?s contribution to a fixed <b>green</b> <b>rate</b> product must exclude any capacity claims and be that of an energy-producing asset only and that the P 99. 6 quantile should be utilized for confidently estimating monthly energy generatio...|$|E
40|$|With a {{continued}} emphasis on designing for sustainability in architecture, {{it is important}} to see what role <b>green</b> <b>rating</b> systems are playing and what differences they are making. There are many options when it comes to choosing a <b>green</b> <b>rating</b> system for a particular project, and their metrics can vary greatly. Names such as LEED and BREEAM have a large global presence and a long standing relationship with green design. Others, like the Living Building Challenge, are pushing criteria to higher standards. By examining popular <b>green</b> <b>rating</b> systems, one can get a better idea of their fundamentals -what concepts each system evaluates and emphasizes. Comparatively analyzing specific projects certified under these various rating systems then reveals how such systems manifest themselves in the built environment. Finally, crossreferencing this data with practicing academic and professional subjects' views helps to formulate a clearer image of what implications <b>green</b> <b>rating</b> systems are having today and what their continued role may be in the future of architectural design.

Effects of {{promoting}} rainwater infiltration {{and the impact}} factors of concave herbaceous field were analyzed in urban area of Jinan at different scenarios of designed rainfall frequencies, <b>greening</b> <b>rates</b> and concave depths. The capability of rainwater storage and infiltration is correlated negatively with designed rainfall frequency, and positively with concave depth, <b>greening</b> <b>rate</b> and soil infiltration coefficient. The results show that when the ratio of green space is 30 % and the concave depth is 100 mm, the rainwater collection rate of concave herbaceous field is 76. 55 % and 63. 45 % respectively under the rainfall of 1 - year and 3 - years return periods...|$|R

Studies indicate that <b>green</b> <b>rated</b> buildings may bring higher rents and sales prices. One reason for this inequity is that the indoor environment of these buildings may outperform conventional buildings. The main objective {{of this paper is to}} conduct a post-occupancy evaluation (POE) to compare the indoor environment in a LEED certified, on-campus residence hall with a similar, non-green rated residence hall. Results are evaluated to determine if green buildings really outperform. The results suggest that the <b>green</b> <b>rated</b> building outperformed the conventional building in the majority of the indoor environmental aspects, but not all. These results can inform a cost-benefit analysis of green features for new construction and refurbishments...|$|R
