5|$|Cotto {{returned}} to action on February 21, 2009, in a card {{held at the}} Madison Square Garden, sporting {{the first of his}} trademark tattoos which he has expanded on ever since. This time competing against Michael Jennings for the vacant WBO welterweight title. After both pugilists used the first round to study their opponent's style, the tempo accelerated during the second. In the third, Cotto pursued the offensive more <b>fluidly,</b> <b>connecting</b> with jabs and hooks. One round later, Cotto scored two knockdowns on Jennings, who was able to continue until the recess. In the fifth, Jennings was trapped against the ropes, which Cotto utilized to connect a right hook to score a third knockdown. Jennings incorporated, but the referee decided to stop the fight. With this action, Cotto was awarded a technical knockout victory, in the process winning his second championship in the welterweight division. On April 8, 2009, Cotto fired his uncle from the team's staff, following a violent discussion where his property was damaged. However, neither side expressed interest in pursuing any sort of legal action. Consequently, Cotto named Joe Santiago, who had served as the team's nutritionist as his new trainer.|$|R
40|$|A {{method and}} {{apparatus}} for evaluating low differential pressure transducers includes a pressure generator {{in the form}} of a piston-cylinder assembly having a piston that may be manually positioned precisely within the cylinder to change the volume and thus the pressure at respective sides of the piston. At one side of the piston the cylinder communicates with a first chamber and at the other side of the piston the cylinder communicates with a second chamber, the first and second chambers being formed within a common tank by a partition wall. The chambers each communicate with the transducer to be evaluated and a standard pre-calibrated transducer the transducers being <b>connected</b> <b>fluidly</b> in parallel so that a pressure differential between air in the two chambers resulting from movement of the piston within the cylinder is communicated to both the transducer to be evaluated and the standard transducer, and the outputs of the transducers is observed and recorded...|$|R

40|$|Creative {{metaphor is}} a {{phenomenon}} that stretches and bends the conventions of semantic description, often to humorous and poetic extremes. The computational modeling of metaphor thus requires a knowledge representation that is just as stretchable and semantically accommodating. We present here a flexible knowledge representation for metaphor interpretation and generation, called Talking Points, and describe how talking points can be acquired {{on a large scale}} from WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) and from the web. We show how talking points can be <b>fluidly</b> <b>connected</b> to form a slipnet, and demonstrate that talking points provide an especially concise representation for concepts in general. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{multiplicity}} of computing and display devices currently available presents {{new opportunities for}} how visual analytics is performed. One of the significant inherent challenges {{that comes with the}} use of multiple and varied types of displays for visual analytics is the sharing and subsequent integration of information among different devices. Multiple devices enable analysts to employ and extend visual space for working with visualizations, but this requires users to switch intermittently between activi-ties and foci of interest over different workspaces. We present a visual analytics system, VisPorter, developed for use in a multiple display and device environment, and a user study that explores the usage and benefits of this system. VisPorter enables seamless cross-device activity through lightweight touch interactions, and allows multiple displays and devices to be <b>fluidly</b> <b>connected</b> for sensemaking...|$|E
