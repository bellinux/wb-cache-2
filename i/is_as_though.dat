Usually the {{differences}} are minor—matters of spelling and the like—but occasionally they are significant, {{as in the case}} of the Comma Johanneum, a clause in the First Epistle of John that bears explicit witness to the doctrine of the Christian Trinity, but is not found in any manuscript earlier than the 10th century (codex 221), where it is shown as a marginal note. A similar example from the Old Testament is the difference between the Septuagint and Masoretic descriptions of the battle of David and Goliath: the Septuagint version is shorter and avoids the narrative inconsistencies of the familiar Masoretic story, notably the famous incident of Saul asking who David <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> he does not know his own harpist and shield-bearer.|$|E
500|$|The Swimming Hole {{represented}} {{the full range}} of Eakins' techniques and academic principles. He used life study, photography, wax studies, and landscape sketches to produce a work that manifested his interest in the human form. Lloyd Goodrich (1897–1987) believed the work was [...] "Eakins' most masterful use of the nude", with the solidly conceived figures perfectly integrated into the landscape, an image of subtle tonal construction and one of the artist's [...] "richest pieces of painting". Another biographer, William Innes Homer (b.1929), was more reserved and described the poses of the figures as rigidly academic. Homer found inconsistencies in paint quality and atmospheric effect, and wrote that the painting was unsuccessful in reconciling antique and naturalistic ideals. For him, [...] "it <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> these nudes had been abruptly transplanted from the studio into nature".|$|E
500|$|The {{union of}} song and symphonic form in Mahler's music is, in Cooke's view, organic; [...] "his songs flower {{naturally}} into symphonic movements, being already symphonic in cast." [...] To Sibelius, Mahler expressed {{the belief that}} [...] "The symphony must be like the world. It must embrace everything." [...] True to this belief, Mahler drew material from many sources into his songs and symphonic works: bird calls and cow-bells to evoke nature and the countryside, bugle fanfares, street melodies and country dances to summon the lost world of his childhood. Life's struggles are represented in contrasting moods: the yearning for fulfilment by soaring melodies and chromatic harmony, suffering and despair by discord, distortion and grotesquerie. Amid all this is Mahler's particular hallmark—the constant intrusion of banality and absurdity into moments of deep seriousness, typified in the second movement of the Fifth Symphony when a trivial popular tune suddenly cuts into a solemn funeral march. The trite melody soon changes its character, and in due course re-emerges {{as one of the}} majestic Brucknerian chorales which Mahler uses to signify hope and the resolution of conflict. Mahler himself recognised the idiosyncrasies in his work, calling the Scherzo in the Third Symphony [...] "the most farcical {{and at the same time}} the most tragic piece that ever existed... It <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> all nature is making faces and sticking out its tongue." ...|$|E

2500|$|Shimon ben Lakish deduced {{from the}} {{proximity}} of the discussions of appointment of judges in [...] and the Canaanite idolatrous practice of the Asherah in [...] that appointing an incompetent judge <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> planting an idolatrous tree. Rav Ashi said that such an appointment made in a place where there were scholars <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> planting the idolatrous tree beside the Altar, for [...] concludes [...] "beside the altar of the Lord your God.".

2500|$|Yet it did {{provoke the}} {{beginning}} of the great period of exception in Picasso’s life. Nobody can know exactly how the change began inside Picasso. We can only note the results. Les Demoiselles d’Avignon, unlike any previous painting by Picasso, offers no evidence of skill. On the contrary, it is clumsy, overworked, unfinished. It <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> his fury in painting it was so great that it destroyed his gifts… ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{first piece}} {{completed}} at IRCAM was Répons (1980–84). In this forty-minute work an instrumental ensemble {{is placed in}} the middle of the hall, while six soloists encircle the audience: two pianos, harp, cimbalom, vibraphone and glockenspiel/xylophone. It is their music which is transformed electronically and projected through the space. Peter Heyworth described the moment at which they enter, some ten minutes into the piece: “it <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> a great window were thrown open, through which a new sound world enters, and with it a new world of the imagination. Even more impressive is the fact that there is no longer a schism between the worlds of natural and electronic sounds, but rather a continuous spectrum.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Rav Chisda {{was also}} an {{authority}} in aggadah, and employed special assistants to lecture in that department. Many ethical sentences by him have been preserved for students, such as: [...] "Forbearance {{on the part of}} a father toward his child may be permitted, but not forbearance {{on the part of a}} master toward his disciple" [...] and [...] "He who opposes his master <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> he opposed the Shekinah". It was said that the Angel of Death, not being able to approach Rav Chisda because he never ceased from studying, cleft the trunk of a cedar-tree. Terrified by the noise, Rav Chisda interrupted his studies, whereupon the angel took his soul.|$|E
2500|$|Eiseley's writing often {{includes}} {{his belief}} that mankind {{does not have enough}} evidence to determine exactly how humans came to be. In The Immense Journey, he writes, “…many lines of seeming relatives, rather than merely one, lead to man. It <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> we stood {{at the heart of a}} maze and no longer remembered how we had come there.” According to Wentz, Eiseley realized that there is nothing below a certain depth that can truly be explained, and quotes Eiseley as saying that there is [...] "nothing to explain the necessity of life, nothing to explain the hunger of the elements to become life [...] [...] [...] [...]" [...] and that [...] "the human version of evolutionary events [...] perhaps too simplistic for belief." ...|$|E

2500|$|For Barbara Brend: Superficially the {{illustrations}} to Jami's stories {{are very similar}} to those of works for Tahmasp; they are complex compositions of a high level of finish, but there are more figures which are slightly grotesque, more youths with a slightly louche, pussycat smile, and a palette which admits more brown and purple tertiary colours. [...] The eye is pulled restlessly over the page from detail to detail. It <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> the painters had lost confidence {{in the power of the}} ostensible narrative subject to interest the viewer, and were searching for other means to hold the attention. [...] Innocence had been lost; the classic works would continue to be illustrated, but only as a vehicle for the painters' skill; they seem no longer to have a mythic hold on the imagination. [...] The future of painting was to lie in more realistic subjects, though their treatment often disguises that realism from us.|$|E
2500|$|Here he, {{like many}} other writers, notes the {{elements}} of musical form (then often described as [...] "closed forms") which characterize the opera and make it appear {{to be something of}} a return to the language of earlier times, [...] "the veritable apotheosis of bel canto with its demands for vocal beauty, agility and range," [...] notes Charles Osborne. Thus, the cantabile-cabaletta two-part arias, the use of the chorus, etc., which Verdi had originally asked Cammarano to ignore, are evident. But Verdi wanted something else: [...] "the freer the forms he presents me with, the better I shall do," [...] he wrote to the librettist's friend in March 1851. It was not what he received from his librettist, but he certainly demonstrated his total mastery over this style. Osborne's take on Il trovatore is that [...] "it <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> Verdi had decided to do something which he had been perfecting over the years, and to do it so beautifully that he need never to do it again. Formally, it is a step backward after Rigoletto".|$|E
2500|$|In the {{new year}} of 1942, Ryle took Wittgenstein {{to his home in}} Sussex to meet his wife who had been adamant to meet him. Ryle's son {{recorded}} the weekend in his diary;Wink is awful strange – not a very good english speaker, keeps on saying ‘I mean’ and ‘its “tolerable”’ meaning intolerable. The hospital staff were not told {{he was one of the}} world's most famous philosophers, though some of the medical staff did recognize him—at least one had attended Moral Sciences Club meetings—but they were discreet. [...] "Good God, don't tell anybody who I am!" [...] Wittgenstein begged one of them. Some of them nevertheless called him Professor Wittgenstein, and he was allowed to dine with the doctors. He wrote on 1 April 1942: [...] "I no longer feel any hope for the future of my life. It <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> I had before me nothing more than a long stretch of living death. I cannot imagine any future for me other than a ghastly one. Friendless and joyless." [...] It was at this time that Wittgenstein had an operation at Guy's to remove a gall-stone that had troubled him for some years.|$|E

2500|$|Sothern's {{next great}} role was the title role, Fitzaltamont, in a hit revival of Byron's The Crushed Tragedian (1878, {{originally}} named The Prompter's Box) at the Haymarket. [...] The Era admired [...] "the sepulchral tones, the glaring eyeballs, the long hair, the wonderful 'stage walk', the melodramatic attitudes" [...] of his portrayal. [...] He next appeared in The Hornet's Nest by Byron at the Haymarket. [...] The Crushed Tragedian {{was not a}} great success in London, but it became a hit in New York. [...] The Philadelphia Inquirer raved, [...] "With what elaboration of detail does the actor embody his conception! There is not a gesture, not an intonation, not a movement, but seems to illustrate the character portrayed. He strides across the stage and it <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> he were wading through a sea of gore; he mutters to himself ‘Ha! ha!’ {{and you know that}} he is cursing fate with a bitterness loud and deep. always and in all things poor Altamont is exquisitely, indescribably ludicrous." [...] In April 1879, he was still at the Haymarket, appearing in Lord Lytton's play Money as Sir Frederick Blount.|$|E
2500|$|Interpreting the words, [...] "And {{they shall}} make an Ark," [...] in [...] Rabbi Judah ben Rabbi Shalom taught that God {{said that all}} should come and occupy {{themselves}} with the Ark so that they all might merit the Torah.

The table is the crown of kingship, of which [...] says, [...] "And make thereto a crown of gold round about." [...] The altar is the crown of priesthood, of which [...] says, [...] "And you shall make unto it a crown of gold round about." [...] And the Ark is the crown of the Torah, of which [...] says, [...] "And you shall make upon it a crown of gold round about." [...] The word for [...] "crown" [...] (zer, [...] ) can also be read as zar (stranger), to teach that if a person has merit, it becomes like a crown, but if a person does not have merit, then it becomes alien to that person. Of the other furnishings, Scripture says, [...] "And you shall make," [...] whereas of the Ark, [...] says, [...] "And they shall make," [...] to teach that the crown of the Torah stands above all; when a person acquires the Torah, it <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> that person has acquired all the rest.|$|E
