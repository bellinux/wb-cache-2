50|$|Dolly Parton {{made her}} album debut in 1967 (she'd {{previously}} achieved {{success as a}} songwriter for others), with her album <b>Hello,</b> <b>Im</b> Dolly. With steady success during {{the remainder of the}} 1960s (both as a solo artist, and with a series of duet albums with Porter Wagoner), her sales and chart peak came during the 1970s and continuing into the 1980s; Parton's subsequent albums in the later part of the 1990s were lower in sales. At this time, country pop ruled the country albums and singles chart. However, in the new millennium, Parton achieved commercial success again. She has released albums on independent labels since 2000, including albums on her own label, Dolly Records.|$|E
5000|$|After {{releasing}} two unsuccessful singles as a teenager, Parton {{signed a}} recording contract with Monument Records in 1964, {{and moved to}} Nashville, Tennessee shortly afterward, releasing a series of singles on the label, the highest charting being her 1965 single [...] "Happy Happy Birthday Baby". In 1967, Monument released Partons debut solo album, <b>Hello,</b> <b>Im</b> Dolly, which spawned the hits, [...] "Dumb Blonde" [...] and [...] "Something Fishy", which reached No. 24 and No. 17 respectively. Shortly after official debut, Parton was asked to replace country vocalist Norma Jean as the co-host of the syndicated country music television show The Porter Wagoner Show, alongside country star, Porter Wagoner. The pair recorded 12 albums together for RCA Victor, and in the late 1960s and early 1970s {{had a series of}} Top 10 hits on the country charts, including [...] "The Last Thing on My Mind", [...] "Tomorrow is Forever", and [...] "Daddy Was an Old Time Preacher Man". On Wagoners television series, Parton gained a national audience of millions of viewers, and her own singles began to move up the country chart. By the early 1970s, her solo hits regularly appeared in the top ten, as did her duets with Wagoner. Her first chart-topper, 1970s [...] "Joshua", followed by 1971s [...] "Coat of Many Colors", 1972s [...] "Touch Your Woman", and [...] "Traveling Man" [...] and [...] "Jolene", both from 1973, all reached the top-ten on the U.S. country singles charts, with [...] "Jolene" [...] becoming her second No. 1 single in February 1974. In mid-1974, Parton split with Wagoner and his show in order to expand her career as a solo artist, writing and recording the No. 1 hit, [...] "I Will Always Love You" [...] as a tribute to Wagoner.|$|E
