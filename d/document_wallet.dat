30|$|The {{information}} search criterion (a) is also {{closely related}} to the type of test and differs between PBA and CBA. While in CBA the necessary information to solve tasks must be partially filtered by the test-takers themselves, as part of the task, the relevant documents in the PBA are bundled beforehand into a <b>document</b> <b>wallet.</b> Disadvantages can arise by interacting with CBA, especially when the simulation is not intuitive to use and/or when the effort of searching for information triggers temporal limitations.|$|E
50|$|This is the {{advanced}} {{and more sophisticated}} version of Folder Lock for Android. Unlike Folder Lock (Android), it allows users to encrypt files using the AES-256 military-grade encryption. Apart from this, the app has a user-friendly interface, new and improved features and is superior in overall functionality. It locks users' personal files, folders, photos, videos, audio files, <b>documents,</b> <b>wallet</b> cards, notes and every other kind of data {{that needs to be}} secured. Moreover, users can back up the safeguarded information on the cloud. Finally, the app has additional security features which prevent unauthorized access.|$|R
500|$|ICAO also {{interviewed a}} number of these divers for its 1993 report: [...] "In {{addition}} to the scraps of metal, they observed personal items, such as clothing, <b>documents</b> and <b>wallets.</b> Although some evidence of human remains was noticed by the divers, they found no bodies." ...|$|R
5000|$|Finland - Finland's {{national}} airline Finnair cancelled {{two of its}} flights to London Heathrow on Thursday and one from Heathrow to Helsinki on Sunday, the remaining flights only had slight delays. Other airlines flying to and from Finland have experienced only delays. Passengers are forbidden to carry anything more than personal <b>documents</b> and <b>wallets</b> in flights to Britain.|$|R
40|$|Objectives: The {{purpose of}} this study was 1) to {{investigate}} if travellers from North Queensland/Australia to destinations in developing countries seek travel health advice and, if so, what kind of advice they receive; and 2) to ascertain the ideal type and source of travel health advice from the travellers' perspective. Methods: For this descriptive study, a questionnaire was developed consisting of three parts, 1) demographic data and information on the impending travel, 2) data on travel health advice seeking behaviour, advice sought for this specific trip and content of this advice, and 3) data on the ideal situation of receiving travel health advice. Staff of participating travel agents in Townsville and Cairns included a copy of the questionnaire in the travel <b>document</b> <b>wallets</b> of clients travelling to destinations in Central and South America, Africa, Asia and the Pacific Region. Completed forms were returned via pre-paid envelopes. Results: Fifty-seven percent of the respondents (n= 106) claimed to always seek advice, 4...|$|R
25|$|Immediately {{following}} the raids, no hand luggage was allowed except for essentials such as travel <b>documents</b> and <b>wallets.</b> Limited hand baggage was reintroduced at some smaller airports on 14 August, {{but was not}} permitted at Heathrow and Gatwick Airports until 15 August. Some restrictions were relaxed in September 2006, and on 6 November 2006 restrictions were again relaxed to allow limited volumes of liquids to be carried into the cabin.|$|R
50|$|Following the raids, {{the terror}} alert level {{was raised by}} Britain's Joint Terrorist Analysis Centre from 'severe' to 'critical', {{signalling}} an attack {{was believed to be}} imminent. Security at all British airports was raised to the highest level, with all property having to go into the aircraft's hold, except for essentials such as travel <b>documents</b> and <b>wallets.</b> Passengers travelling with small children were permitted to carry baby food but had to taste it in front of staff.|$|R
5000|$|A {{number of}} {{civilian}} divers, whose first dive was on September 15, {{two weeks after}} the shootdown, state that Soviet military divers and trawls had been at work before them:Diver Viyacheslav Popov: [...] "As we learned then, before us the trawlers had done some ‘work’ in the designated quadrant. It is hard to understand what sense the military saw in the trawling operation. First drag everything haphazardly around the bottom by the trawls, and then send in the submersibles?...It is clear that things should have been done in the reverse order.”ICAO also interviewed a number of these divers for its 1993 report: [...] "In addition to the scraps of metal, they observed personal items, such as clothing, <b>documents</b> and <b>wallets.</b> Although some evidence of human remains was noticed by the divers, they found no bodies." ...|$|R
5000|$|A Diving {{certification}} or C-card is a <b>document</b> (usually a <b>wallet</b> sized plastic card) {{recognizing that}} an individual or organization authorized to do so, [...] "certifies" [...] that the bearer has completed a course of training {{as required by the}} agency issuing the card. This is assumed to represent a defined level of ability and knowledge in underwater diving. Divers carry a qualification record or certification card which may be required to prove their qualifications when booking a dive trip, hiring scuba equipment or filling diving cylinders.|$|R
25|$|Mallory's {{daughter}} said that Mallory carried {{a photograph of}} his wife on his person {{with the intention of}} leaving it on the summit. This photo was not found on Mallory's body. Given the excellent preservation of the body, its garments and other items including <b>documents</b> in his <b>wallet,</b> this points to the possibility that he may have reached the summit and deposited the photo there. On the other hand, Wang (who is known to have taken Mallory's ice-axe) might also have taken the photograph for identification purposes, and no one who has subsequently reached the summit has reported seeing any evidence of the photograph, or any other trace of their presence there.|$|R
50|$|On 8 November 1997, he {{was killed}} in mysterious circumstances. His charred body was found on wasteground 20 yards from a {{burnt-out}} boat that had blown up as he was towing it on a trailer. Police and firemen made the discovery after rushing {{to the scene of the}} explosion and subsequent fireball which had consumed the craft. This occurred on the main Newry to Warrenpoint road. Kerr was 54 years old at the time of his death, and his body was so badly damaged by the flames that he had to be identified by the <b>documents</b> in his <b>wallet.</b> According to McPhilemy he had made loose arrangements to meet Kerr immediately prior to his death. By that time he had become disillusioned with loyalism.|$|R
5000|$|Peter and {{his friends}} attend a Barry Manilow concert. After the concert, Peter realizes that he has left his wallet at the stadium. He soon discovers that someone is using his credit card to buy very {{expensive}} items. After receiving a bank statement, Peter and Brian track the culprit to a restaurant and discover him to be James Woods. Naturally, Woods is bitter towards Peter and, having stolen his wallet, is maxing out his credit card in his plan for revenge. Peter and Brian return home to find Woods there, having claimed property of his house and possessions with the <b>documents</b> in Peter's <b>wallet.</b> Woods calls Joe over to remove Peter from [...] "his" [...] house. The Griffins are outraged by this, but Joe has no other choice but to abide his request now that Woods has stolen Peter's identity. The Griffins are resentful of Woods for what he has done, especially Lois and Brian. As Brian swears that Woods will not get away with what he has done, Woods responds by calling him an 'outdoor dog' and ties Brian up to a pole outside, much to Brian's anger. Unfortunately, Peter is forced to stay off of Woods' property, as Woods threatens to shoot Peter {{with a gun and}} sets up one of Peter's cutaway gags.|$|R
40|$|Fluoro Dynel Northwest (FDNW) was {{authorized}} to address flammable gas issues by reconciling the unexplained surface level increases in Tank 24 1 -S- 1 1 1 (S-I 1 1, typical). The trapped gas evaluation document (ref 1) states that Tank SX- 102 exceeds the 25 % {{of the lower}} flammable limit (FL) criterion (ref 2), based on a surface level rise evaluation. The Waste Storage Tank Status and Leak Detection Criteria document, {{commonly referred to as}} the ``Wallet Report`` is the basis for this letter report (ref 3). The Wallet Report is also a part of the trapped gas evaluation <b>document</b> criteria. The <b>Wallet</b> Report contains various tank information, including: physical information, status, levels, and dry wells, see Appendix A. The unexplained waste level rises were attributed to the production and retention of gas in the column of waste corresponding to the unacquainted for surface level rise. From 1973 through 1980, the Wallet Report tracked Tank S- 102 transfers and reported a net cumulative change of 19. 95 in. This surface level increase is from an unknown source or is unacquainted for. Duke Engineering and Services Hanford (DASH) and Leached Martin Hanford Corporation (LMHC) are interested in determining the validity of the unexplained surface level changes reported in the 0611 e Wallet Report based upon other corroborative sources of data. The purpose of this letter report is to assemble detailed surface level and waste addition data from daily tank records, logbooks, and other corroborative data that indicate surface levels, and to reconcile the cumulative unacquainted for surface level changes as shown in the Wallet Report from 1973 through 1980...|$|R
