5|$|Rockstar based Trevor's {{appearance}} on Ogg's physical appearance, while his personality {{was inspired by}} Charles Bronson. Grand Theft Auto V co-writer Dan <b>Houser</b> described Trevor as purely driven by desire and resentment. To make players care for the character, the designers gave the character more emotions. Trevor is shown to truly care about people very close to him, despite his psychotic actions.|$|E
5|$|Another company, <b>Houser</b> Vending Co., Inc., {{developed}} a French fry vending machine named Mr. Crispy's, {{which was used}} in various locations such as college campuses and factories since at least September 1990. The fries were cooked in 365°F sunflower oil for around 40 seconds, and 500 orders of fries were prepared before the oil was changed. The machine had a feature that automatically turned it off {{in the event of}} a malfunction, and it also had a fire extinguisher built into it.|$|E
5|$|On 21 July 1944, around 0830, 3rd Battalion hit the Asan beaches on Guam. Landing on {{the extreme}} left of the entire 3rd Marine Division, their mission was to take Chonito Cliff and Adelup Point, which marked the left flank of the division. Within minutes the Japanese {{defenders}} opened up with mortars and machine guns, hitting many 3rd Battalion Marines coming ashore. By 0912 battalion commander Lieutenant Colonel Ralph <b>Houser</b> reported many casualties caused by both mortars and sniper fire. Both Kilo and India Companies rushed the Chonito Cliffs but the Japanese defenders (Elements of the 2d Battalion, 18th Regiment and 320th Independent Infantry Battalion) resisted strongly, in some cases rolling grenades down the hillside. Supported by flamethrowers, half-tracks, and armor from the 3rd Tank Battalion, 3rd Battalion fought a bloody, three-hour battle {{up the side of}} Chonito Cliff. <b>Houser</b> then ordered Lima Company to flank the cliffs to the north by dashing down an exposed beach road. Having secured Chonito Cliff, the battalion then moved on to Adelup Point. The US Navy sent a destroyer to blast the Japanese caves at point-blank range and 3rd Battalion flamethrowers burned out Japanese soldiers who still remained. After securing Adelup Point, 3rd Battalion finished the day providing flank security {{for the rest of the}} 3rd Marines during the Battle for Bundschu Ridge and became the only unit in the regiment to accomplish its objectives by the end of W-Day.|$|E

5|$|The {{film was}} {{directed}} by Robert Mulligan, and starred Gary Grimes as Hermie, Jerry <b>Houser</b> as his best friend Oscy, Oliver Conant as their nerdy young friend Benjie, Jennifer O'Neill as Hermie's mysterious love interest, and Katherine Allentuck and Christopher Norris {{as a pair of}} girls whom Hermie and Oscy attempt to seduce. Mulligan also has an uncredited role as the voice of the adult Hermie. Maureen Stapleton (Allentuck's real-life mother) also appears in a small, uncredited voice role (calling after Hermie as he leaves the house in an early scene, and after he enters his room in a later scene).|$|E
5|$|A major {{difficulty}} {{the team}} encountered was converting all game elements into a fully-3D world, including {{the sound and}} radio stations, as well as designing and voicing the non-player characters, due to the amount that existed within the open world; producer Dan <b>Houser</b> {{said that there was}} about 8,000 lines of recorded dialogue in the game, while audio programmer Raymond Usher estimated about 18,000. The basic technical elements of the game began to work together in mid-2000, with a carjacking mechanic prototype and stable streaming model. Streaming was initially intended to be reserved for music and map geometry, but other elements were eventually included when it became apparent to the team as more data was entered.|$|E
5|$|In 1973, {{the film}} was {{followed}} by Class of '44, a slice-of-life film made up of vignettes about Herman Raucher and Oscar Seltzer's experiences in college. Class of '44 involves the boys facing army service {{in the last year}} of World War II. The only crew member from Summer of '42 to return to the project was Raucher himself, who wrote the script; a new director and composer were brought in to replace Mulligan and Legrand. Of the principal four cast members of Summer of '42, only Jerry <b>Houser</b> and Gary Grimes returned for prominent roles, with Oliver Conant making two brief appearances totaling less than two minutes of screen time. Jennifer O'Neill did not appear in the film at all, nor was the character of Dorothy mentioned.|$|E

5|$|The {{first night}} of 21–22 July, the Marines of 3rd Battalion came under a concerted counterattack by the {{survivors}} of the Japanese 320th Independent Infantry Battalion, as well as the 319th, committed by Japanese commander General Kiyoshi Shigematsu to retake the Chonito Cliffs. The Japanese managed to infiltrate past many 3rd Battalion units through ravines and dry river beds and briefly threatened to overrun the battalion command post. The fighting was so heavy that parts of the Division Reserve were committed and the destroyer USS McKee was unable to provide close fire support, as the Japanese and Marines were so closely intermingled. However the Marines held firm and managed to repulse the attack by 0830. During the counterattack, a mortarman with Kilo Company, Private First Class Luther Skaggs, Jr., was critically wounded in the leg by a Japanese grenade. After applying a tourniquet, Skaggs continued to fight for another eight hours before moving unassisted to the rear where most of his leg was amputated. For this he became the first Marine from 3rd Battalion to be awarded the Medal of Honor. Over the next two days the 3rd Battalion fought a savage battle with the Japanese defenders for the Chonito Cliffs and Fonte Plateau area, as the battalion struggled to capture the Mt. Tenjo Road. On 23 July, 3rd Battalion seized the last ridge leading to the Fonte Plateau, provoking a heavy Japanese counterattack. LtCol <b>Houser</b> himself was seriously wounded in this engagement and the Executive Officer, Major Royal Bastian, took command. Then 3rd Battalion, now reinforced with tanks, took part in the assault on the Fonte Plateau on 25 July, seizing the key position after just an hour of fighting. The night of 25–26 July saw the climax of the fighting on Guam when the Japanese launched an all-out counterattack against the Americans. In the 3rd Battalion's sector, Japanese sailors of the 54th Keibitai launched a series of failed attacks against the now-well defended Marine positions. Backed up with artillery, the Marines easily repulsed the Japanese.|$|E
25|$|<b>Houser</b> {{is said to}} {{have entered}} Louisiana around July 2 or 3 and spent his time {{exploring}} the state along Interstate 10, apparently searching for a location to attack. During the week of July 13, <b>Houser</b> visited a food bank in Lake Charles twice and requested aid from them. He had been at the Grand 16 theater at least once before, and had also visited several other movie theaters in the state. According to witnesses at one theater, <b>Houser</b> was dressed up to look like a woman and was behaving erratically. <b>Houser</b> also appeared to have made some getaway plans.|$|E
25|$|<b>Houser</b> {{was said}} to have mental health issues, for which he was treated in 2008 and 2009. In 2008, <b>Houser</b> {{underwent}} a mental health evaluation. According to his wife, he suffered from bipolar disorder.|$|E
