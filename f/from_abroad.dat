5|$|After {{returning}} <b>from</b> <b>abroad,</b> Laurer held {{several different}} jobs: a cocktail waitress in a strip club, singer in a band, and a 900-number chat line worker. In her mid-to-late 20s, {{while living in}} the Florida Keys, she took a six-week class to train to be a flight attendant. On {{the way to her}} first flight, she was in a car accident and spent four days in the hospital. After recovering from the accident, Laurer's sister Kathy helped her get a job selling pagers, and both women also worked as belly dancers.|$|E
5|$|Although Charles {{had been}} criticised {{severely}} for granting the large ransom payment to the Vikings, {{he had other}} more critical issues to deal with at the same time, including disputes with his brothers, regional revolts and disgruntled nobles, as well as pressure <b>from</b> <b>abroad.</b> Since he would have trouble trusting his own counts to assemble and lead troops to defeat Ragnar's large force militarily, paying them off instead would buy Charles time, and possibly peace from further Viking raids—at least in the near future.|$|E

In 2004, a Canadian Falun Gong practitioner on a book tour was denied entry to the territory, and in 2008, two Falun Gong practitioners from the United States and Switzerland were separately denied entry while on professional and research trips.|$|E

5|$|Early {{on in the}} force's history, most of its {{equipment}} and weapons had to be imported <b>from</b> <b>abroad,</b> {{due to the lack}} of indigenous Canadian industry. Its early saddlery and wagons were imported from the United States, although the police's uniforms were made locally. After 1887, political pressure grew to use Canadian suppliers whenever possible. Supplies of food and similar goods were initially bought from the major trading companies in the west, such as the Hudson's Bay Company, but this gradually changed once more of the territories were settled and goods could be purchased from smaller, local firms, with the police becoming an important source of business. Equipment and supplies had to be bought from companies that supported the government of the day, and after 1896 a formal list of politically approved suppliers was kept by the comptroller's office. All of the police's guns had to be imported, {{due to the lack of}} indigenous manufacturers, and by 1890s the force was still buying most of its ammunition <b>from</b> <b>abroad,</b> as Canadian-manufactured cartridges remained substandard.|$|E

5|$|The {{development}} of sales was overestimated; in 1956, 525 Vanajas were sold and in March 1957, the volume {{for the whole}} year was estimated to reach about 400units.

5|$|A {{total of}} 112 fictional films {{are known to}} have been {{produced}} in the Dutch East Indies (modern day Indonesia) between 1926 and the colony's dissolution in 1949. The earliest motion pictures, imported <b>from</b> <b>abroad,</b> were shown in late 1900, and by the early 1920s imported serials and fictional films were being shown, often with localised names. Dutch companies were also producing documentary films about the Indies to be shown in the Netherlands. The first reports of fictional film production in the Indies date from 1923, although the work in question was not completed. The first locally produced film, Loetoeng Kasaroeng, was directed by L.
