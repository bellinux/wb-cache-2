60|$|We {{must now}} glance backward, in quest of the {{beautiful}} daughter of Fauntleroy's prosperity. What had become of her? Fauntleroy's only brother, a bachelor, and with no other relative so near, had adopted the forsaken child. She grew up in affluence, with native graces clustering luxuriantly about her. In her triumphant progress towards womanhood, she was adorned with every variety of feminine accomplishment. But she lacked a mother's care. With no adequate control, on any hand (for a man, however stern, however wise, can never sway and guide a female child), her character was left to shape itself. There was good in it, and evil. Passionate, self-willed, and imperious, she had a warm and generous nature; showing {{the richness of the}} soil, however, chiefly by the weeds that flourished in it, and choked up the <b>herbs</b> <b>of</b> <b>grace.</b> In her girlhood her uncle died. As Fauntleroy was supposed to be likewise dead, and no other heir was known to exist, his wealth devolved on her, although, dying suddenly, the uncle left no will. After his death there were obscure passages in Zenobia's history. There were whispers of an attachment, and even a secret marriage, with a fascinating and accomplished but unprincipled young man. The incidents and appearances, however, which led to this surmise soon passed away, and were forgotten.|$|R

60|$|We paid a {{visit to}} Fort Ellsworth, and from its ramparts (which have been heaped up out of the muddy soil within the last few months, and will require still a year or two to make them verdant) we had a {{beautiful}} view of the Potomac, a truly majestic river, and the surrounding country. The fortifications, so numerous in all this region, and now so unsightly with their bare, precipitous sides, will remain as historic monuments, grass-grown and picturesque memorials of an epoch of terror and suffering: they will serve to make our country dearer and more interesting to us, and afford fit soil for poetry to root itself in: for this is a plant which thrives best in spots where blood has been spilt long ago, and grows in abundant clusters in old ditches, such as the moat around Fort Ellsworth will be a century hence. It may seem to be paying dear for what many will reckon but a worthless weed; but the more historical associations we can link with our localities, the richer will be the daily life that feeds upon the past, and the more valuable the things that have been long established: so that our children will be less prodigal than their fathers in sacrificing good institutions to passionate impulses and impracticable theories. This <b>herb</b> <b>of</b> <b>grace,</b> let us hope, will be found in the old footprints of the war.|$|E

60|$|As Redclyffe sat one day {{watching}} {{the old man}} in the garden, he could not help being struck by the scrupulous care with which he attended to the plants; {{it seemed to him that}} there was a sense of justice,--of desiring to do exactly what was right in the matter, not favoring one plant more than another, and doing all he could for each. His progress, in consequence, was so slow, that in an hour, while Redclyffe was off and on looking at him, he had scarcely done anything perceptible. Then he was so minute; and often, when he was on the point of leaving one thing to take up another, some small neglect that he saw or fancied called him back again, to spend other minutes on the same task. He was so full of scruples. It struck Redclyffe that this was conscience, morbid, sick, a despot in trifles, looking so closely into life that it permitted nothing to be done. The man might once have been strong and able, but by some unhealthy process of his life he had ceased to be so now. Nor did any happy or satisfactory result appear to come from these painfully wrought efforts; he still seemed to know that he had left something undone in doing too much in another direction. Here was a lily that had been neglected, while he paid too much attention to a rose; he had set his foot on a violet; he had grubbed up, in his haste, a little plant that he mistook for a weed, but that he now suspected was an <b>herb</b> <b>of</b> <b>grace.</b> Grieved by such reflections as these, he heaved a deep sigh, almost amounting to a groan, and sat down on the little stool that he carried with him in his weeding, resting his face in his hands.|$|E

Se obtuvieron los extractos por el método Soxhlet, utilizando agua, etanol y cloroformo como solventes. Los extractos obtenidos se evaluaron en tres diluciones (0, 5 y 10 %) en pruebas de germinación de semillas de las arvenses y del cultivo. Se emplearon tres repeticiones de 50 semillas cada una y el testigo se regó con agua destilada. Los extractos etanólicos y clorofórmicos de coquito y fique en las diluciones al 5 y 10 % presentaron el mayor efecto inhibitorio en la germinación a los 21 días. El ensayo de campo demostró el efecto inhibitorio de los extractos etanólicos de fique y coquito en la emergencia de las semillas del cilantro. El análisis de metabolitos secundarios comprobó la presencia de compuestos reportados como altamente tóxicos en fique y en menor cantidad en coquito, aunque los extractos de éste fueron los que más inhibieron la germinación.

Three replications of 50 seeds each one were used and the control was watered only with destilled water. The results showed that the ethanolics and chlorofórmics extracts of nut sedge and cuban hemp at two evaluated dilutions presented high inhibiting effect on the seed germination of the three species at 21 days. The field test verified the inhibiting effect on seed germination of the ethanolics extracts of cuban hemp and nut sedge on coriander.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} historical and theological context of the means <b>of</b> <b>grace</b> in the theology of John Wesley {{with the aim of}} identifying its central role in his soteriology. Examining the means <b>of</b> <b>grace</b> in its historical context requires locating the emergence of the means <b>of</b> <b>grace</b> in the English theological lexicon prior to Wesley and tracing Wesley's own inheritance of that tradition. The task of placing the means <b>of</b> <b>grace</b> within the context of Wesley's broader theological framework involves explaining how the means <b>of</b> <b>grace,</b> as disciplined practices engaged within the community of faith, {{lie at the heart of}} his soteriology as it finds expression in the Christian life. It is argued that the best way to conceive of the means <b>of</b> <b>grace</b> in Wesley's theology is as the "sacramental grammar" of his thought, grounded in the Wesleyan idea of social holiness, which names both the communal arena in which the means <b>of</b> <b>grace</b> are practiced and the salvific reality experienced by those joined together in such practice. Chapter 1 introduces the topic and explains the thesis. It describes the plan and scope of the dissertation, which is to locate John Wesley's doctrine of the means <b>of</b> <b>grace</b> in its historical and theological context. It lays out the approach, method, and sources for the project with reference to major scholarly texts that are engaged as well as the primary source material utilized. The chapter concludes by noting that, in addition to elucidating aspects of John Wesley's understanding of the means <b>of</b> <b>grace</b> not present in scholarship up to this point, it also intends to serve as a way to bring discipline to the use of Wesleyan language for the means <b>of</b> <b>grace</b> in contemporary Wesleyan scholarship. Chapter 2 - "The History of the Means of Grace: 16 th and 17 th Centuries" - analyzes the emergence of the language of the means <b>of</b> <b>grace</b> in the Church of England after the period of the Reformation. The chapter argues that the concept of the means <b>of</b> <b>grace</b> emerged as a way to describe the way God can be experienced through activities of devotion and worship, specifically after the loss of the full Roman Catholic sacramental system. It traces the particular use of the means <b>of</b> <b>grace</b> in Puritan practical divinity and examines its inclusion in the Book of Common Prayer. The chapter concludes with a study of John Norris' use of "means of grace" as an example of doctrinal development at the beginning of the 18 th century. Chapter 3 - "The Reception and Development of the Means <b>of</b> <b>Grace</b> in John Wesley" - demonstrates Wesley's reception of the means <b>of</b> <b>grace</b> during the period of Oxford Methodism. It then goes on to trace Wesley's development of the means <b>of</b> <b>grace</b> specifically in relation to the influences of mysticism and Moravianism. The period it covers is from 1731 to 1746, at which time, it is argued, Wesley's doctrine of the means <b>of</b> <b>grace</b> had reached a level of maturity as embodied in his publication of the sermon, "The Means <b>of</b> <b>Grace.</b> " Chapter 4 - "The Content of the Means <b>of</b> <b>Grace</b> in John Wesley's Theology" - analyzes the means <b>of</b> <b>grace</b> in Wesley's theology with respect to two main considerations: the nature <b>of</b> <b>grace</b> and the nature of the means themselves as "practices. " It also examines Wesley's categories of instituted means, prudential means, and general means, noting aspects of Wesley's distinctive understanding of each category. Chapter 5 - "The Character and Context of the Means of Grace" - brings the preceding work of the dissertation into a consideration of the nature of salvation in Wesley, specifically in relation to Wesley's understanding of present salvation as the recovery of holiness of heart and life. It then argues that Wesley's doctrine of the means <b>of</b> <b>grace</b> is best characterized through an intersection of the notion of "social holiness" as the environmental context in which the means <b>of</b> <b>grace</b> are practiced and holiness becomes manifest in the Christian community. Conclusion - The dissertation ends with a conclusion that summarizes the preceding chapters and underscores the significance of social holiness in understanding the context of the means <b>of</b> <b>grace</b> in Wesley's theology and practice of ministry.
