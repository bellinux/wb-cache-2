25|$|That 800 m final {{proved to}} be her last race. X-rays {{revealed}} inflammation of the bladder and her condition was initially diagnosed as Crohn's Disease, forcing her to halt training and ruling her out of July's Commonwealth Games in Edinburgh. However, after further X-rays, tests and two biopsies she was correctly diagnosed with terminal colorectal cancer (or bowel cancer) in September 1970. An exploratory operation at St. Mark's Hospital, London, on 8 October, revealed that the cancer had spread to <b>her</b> <b>stomach</b> <b>and</b> she was given two months to live.|$|E
25|$|Oral sex alone cannot {{result in}} {{pregnancy}} and heterosexual couples may perform oral sex as their method of contraception. For conception to take place, sperm from the penis must enter the uterus and fallopian tubes and fertilize the female's egg. In humans, {{there is no}} connection between the gastrointestinal system and the reproductive system, and sperm ingested by the woman would be killed and broken down by acids in <b>her</b> <b>stomach</b> <b>and</b> proteins in the small intestine. The breakdown products are then absorbed as a negligible quantity of nutrients. However, {{there is a potential}} risk of pregnancy if semen comes in contact with the vaginal area in some way, such as semen in the ejaculate finding its way onto fingers, hands, or other body parts, which then comes in contact with the vaginal area.|$|E

25|$|Once bonded, a {{male and}} female kiwi tend to live their entire lives as a monogamous couple. During the mating season, June to March, the pair call to each other at night, and meet in the nesting burrow every three days. These {{relationships}} may last for up to 20years. They are unusual among other birds in that, along with some raptors, they have a functioning pair of ovaries. (In most birds and in platypuses, the right ovary never matures, so that only the left is functional.) Kiwi eggs can weigh up to one-quarter {{the weight of the}} female. Usually, only one egg is laid per season. The kiwi lays the biggest egg in proportion to its size of any bird in the world, so even though the kiwi {{is about the size of}} a domestic chicken, it is able to lay eggs that are about six times the size of a chicken's egg. The eggs are smooth in texture, and are ivory or greenish white. The male incubates the egg, except for the great spotted kiwi, A. haastii, in which both parents are involved. The incubation period is 63–92days. Producing the huge egg places significant physiological stress on the female; for the thirty days it takes to grow the fully developed egg, the female must eat three times her normal amount of food. Two to three days before the egg is laid there is little space left inside the female for <b>her</b> <b>stomach</b> <b>and</b> she is forced to fast.|$|E

In Dickerson's room, a hidden cache of souvenirs is found, along with a journal and a stack of letters marked [...] "return to sender".|$|E

500|$|In the {{conclusion}} of the [...] "Inside the Episode" [...] segment Weiss spoke about Arya's story, saying [...] "Arya is in danger, she's got an open wound in <b>her</b> <b>stomach,</b> <b>and</b> the one person who has protected her to this point unfortunately gets murdered. The fact that the Many-Faced God gets {{the people who have been}} promised to him really makes you think that there's almost an inevitability about what happens to people who run afoul of the Faceless Men, as Arya has done." [...] Weiss continued about the final part of the sequence, [...] "Arya's telling Jaqen by putting the face on the wall that 'this account is settled, and we're good here, and now I'm going to walk away,' and I think she knows what the answer's going to be. The implication, obviously, is that Jaqen was, on some level, rooting for the outcome that he got. He may be [...] "no one," [...] but there's still enough of a person left in him to respect, and admire who this girl is and what she's become. Arya finally tells us something that we've kind of known all along, that she's not no one, she's Arya Stark of Winterfell." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{first public}} protest {{after the coup}} {{attracted}} between 20 and 100 protesters in front of Siam Center {{on the evening of}} Friday, 22 September 2006. Nobody was arrested, but police recorded the protest on video and noted that the tape would be examined to determine if protesters broke martial law. [...] It is unknown whether the police or junta will arrest those it had recorded. [...] Demonstrators wore black to mourn the death of democracy, and urged people who opposed the coup to also wear black. Protester Giles Ungphakorn noted, [...] "We believe we speak for a significant number of Thais who are too worried or too afraid to speak." [...] The protest was not reported on Thai television channels. The Independent reported that when the first protester, a female student, began reading out a statement, armed police forced their way through the crowd and grabbed her.

60|$|Yes, it is a bee: and I wish I were as worthy in {{my place}} as that bee is in hers. I wish I could act up {{as well as she}} does to the true wisdom, which is self-sacrifice. For whom is that bee working? For herself? If that was all, she only needs to suck the honey as she goes. But she is storing up the wax under <b>her</b> <b>stomach,</b> <b>and</b> bee-bread in her thighs--for whom? Not for herself only, or even for her own {{children}}: but for the children of another bee, her queen. For them she labours all day long, builds for them, feeds them, nurses them, spends her love and cunning on them. So does that ant on the path. She is carrying home that stick to build for other ants' children. So do the white ants in the tropics. They have learnt not to compete, but to help each other; not to be selfish, but to sacrifice themselves; and therefore they are strong.|$|E
60|$|For a while I puzzled {{over the}} {{significance}} of this outgoing and incoming. Shortly a bird soared overhead, circled with powerful sweep, and alighted within ten feet of me. The bird watched me with gray, unintelligent eyes. They were stupid, uncanny eyes, yet somehow so fixed and staring as to seem accusing. One of the little white balls of wool waddled up and, rubbing its fuzzy head against the booby, proclaimed the filial relation. After a few rubs and wabbles the young bird opened wide its bill and let out shrill cries. The mother bobbed up and down in evident consternation, walked away, came back, and with an eye on me plainly sought to pacify her fledgling. Suddenly she put her bill far down into the wide-open bill, effectually stifling the cries. Then the two boobies stood locked in amazing convulsions. The throat of the mother swelled, and a lump passed into and down the throat of the young bird. The puzzle of the flying boobies was solved in the startling realization that the mother had returned from the sea with a fish in <b>her</b> <b>stomach</b> <b>and</b> had disgorged it into the gullet of her offspring.|$|E
60|$|But neither {{were the}} two misers for their gold, the virgin for a first husband, nor the widow for a second, half so eager as another married woman there was {{for the death of}} her spouse. She had put the {{question}} in so expecting a manner for a lucky answer, and with so much keen desire appearing plainly in her looks, that no big-bellied woman was ever more eager for devouring fruit; no young, hasty bridegroom, just married to a beauty, more impatient for night and enjoyment, than she was to know what she thought a more happy moment, the moment of her husband's last agonising gasp. As her expectation was the greatest, so was her disappointment, too, and consequently her disorder upon his going and leaving her unresolved. She was frantic, raging, and implacable; she was in such a fury at the delay of putting off her answer to the day following, that in her fury she acted as if she would have given herself an answer which of the two should die first, by choking herself upon the spot, with the indignation that swelled in <b>her</b> <b>stomach</b> <b>and</b> rose into her throat on that occasion. It may look like a romance to say it, but indeed they were forced to cut her lace, and then she threw out of the room with great passion; but yet had so much of the enraged wife left, beyond the enraged woman, as to return instantly up stairs, and signify very calmly, she would be certain to be there next day, and beseeched earnestly that she might not meet with a second disappointment.|$|E

6000|$|But now, {{how shall}} this man be {{reclaimed}} from this sin? How shall he be brought, wrought, and made, {{to be out}} of love with it? Doubtless it can be by no other means, by what we can see in the Word, but by the wounding, breaking, and disabling of the heart that loves it, and by that means making it a plague and gall unto it. Sin may be made an affliction, and as gall and wormwood to them that love it; but the making of it so bitter a thing to such a man, will not be done but by great and sore means. I remember we had in our town some time since, a little girl that loved to eat the heads of foul tobacco-pipes, and neither rod nor good words could reclaim her, and make her leave them. So her father takes advice of a doctor, to wean her from them, and it was this: Take, saith he, a great many of the foulest tobacco-pipe heads you can get, and boil them in milk, and make a posset of that milk, and make your daughter drink the posset-drink up. He did so, and gave his girl it, and made her drink it up; the which became so irksome and nauseous to <b>her</b> <b>stomach,</b> <b>and</b> made her so sick, that she could never abide to meddle with tobacco-pipe heads any more, and so was cured of that disease. Thou lovest thy sin, and neither rod nor good words will as yet reclaim thee. Well, take heed; if thou wilt not be reclaimed, God will make thee a posset of them, which shall be so bitter to thy soul, so irksome to thy taste, so loathsome to thy mind, and so afflicting to thy heart, that it shall break it with sickness and grief, till it be loathsome to thee. I say, thus he will do if he loves thee; if not, he will suffer thee to take thy course, and will let thee go on with thy tobacco-pipe heads! ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{could see}} for himself that Mr. and Mrs. Day had {{not at all}} her grand air. They were fat plain serious people who {{sat side by side}} on the deck for hours and looked {{straight}} before them. Mrs. Day had a white face, large cheeks and small eyes: her forehead was surrounded with a multitude of little tight black curls; her lips moved as if she had always a lozenge in her mouth. She wore entwined about her head an article which Mrs. Dangerfield spoke of as a [...] "nuby," [...] a knitted pink scarf concealing her hair, encircling her neck and having among its convolutions a hole for her perfectly expressionless face. Her hands were folded on <b>her</b> <b>stomach,</b> <b>and</b> in her still, swathed figure her little bead-like eyes, which occasionally changed their direction, alone represented life. Her husband had a stiff grey beard on his chin and a bare spacious upper lip, to which constant shaving had imparted a hard glaze. His eyebrows were thick and his nostrils wide, and when he was uncovered, in the saloon, it was visible that his grizzled hair was dense and perpendicular. He might have looked rather grim and truculent hadn't it been for the mild familiar accommodating gaze with which his large light-coloured pupils--the leisurely eyes of a silent man--appeared to consider surrounding objects. He was evidently more friendly than fierce, but he was more diffident than friendly. He liked to have you in sight, but wouldn't have pretended to understand you much or to classify you, and would have been sorry it should put you under an obligation. He and his wife spoke sometimes, but seldom talked, and there was something vague and patient in them, as if they had become victims of a wrought spell. The spell however was of no sinister cast; it was the fascination of prosperity, the confidence of security, which sometimes makes people arrogant, but which had had such a different effect on this simple satisfied pair, in whom further development of every kind appeared to have been happily arrested.|$|E

Thurston stressed that the overdose had been unintentional and that no evidence suggested she had committed suicide.
