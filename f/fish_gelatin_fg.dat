The synthesis of FG-GMA was confirmed by 1 H NMR spectroscopy, and photopolymerization of FG-GMA was achieved successfully by irradiation with ultraviolet (UV) light for 3 min to yield translucent composite hydrogels. The concentration of FG-GMA varied from 10 % to 30 % without imogolite, and that of imogolite varied from 0 % to 2. 0 %. A microtomed gel sample was observed with a transmission electron microscope (TEM), and imogolite nanofibers were found to be dispersed finely in the gelatin matrix. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) observation of the lyophilized gel revealed that it had a porous morphology.

30|$|Gelatin {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{versatile}} gelling agents in food applications due to its special texture and the ‘melt-in-mouth’ perception. In addition, gelatin has a variety of applications in the pharmaceutical and photographic industry (Haug et al. [2004]). Gelatin has been used as an additive for improving elasticity, consistency, and stability of foods (Arvanitoyannis [2002]). <b>Fish</b> <b>gelatin</b> (<b>FG)</b> was added into surimi gel, but it resulted in the decrease in gel strength (Hernandez-Briones et al. [2009]). Gelatin is obtained by hydrolyzing the collagen present in the bones and skin, which are generated as byproducts during animal slaughtering and processing. Bovine and porcine skin and bone are the important sources for gelatin production. Recently, fish bones and skins have gained increasing attention as alternative raw material. Those byproducts generated by fish filleting can account for as much as 75 % of the total weight of catches (Shahidi and Botta [1994]). Gelatin from different sources has varying properties, mainly related not only to the amino acid composition but also to the α-chain, β- or γ-component, and molecular-weight distribution (Johnston-Banks [1990]). The intrinsic differences between mammalian and fish gelatins employed may determine different properties of gel (Benjakul et al. [2009]).|$|E

A primary emulsion containing anionic SDS-coated droplets (ζ ≈ − 40 mV) was prepared by homogenizing oil and emulsifier solution using a high-pressure valve homogenizer (20 wt % corn oil, 0. 46 wt % SDS, 100 mM acetic acid, pH 3. 0). A secondary emulsion containing cationic SDS−FG-coated droplets (ζ ≈ + 30 mV) was formed by diluting the primary emulsion with an aqueous <b>fish</b> <b>gelatin</b> solution (10 wt % corn oil, 0. 23 wt % SDS, 100 mM acetic acid, 2. 00 wt % <b>fish</b> <b>gelatin,</b> pH 3. 0). The stabilities of primary and secondary emulsions with the same oil concentration to thermal processing, ionic strength, and pH were assessed by measuring particle size distribution, ζ potential, microstructure, destabilized oil, and creaming stability. The droplets in secondary emulsions had good stability to droplet aggregation at holding temperatures from 30 to 90 °C for 30 min, [NaCl] ≤ 100 mM, and pH values from 3 to 8.

Phosphorylation time was inversely proportional to tan δ; gelling and melting points of <b>fish</b> <b>gelatin</b> gels; however gel properties could be improved by short time of phosphorylation. Scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy revealed that longer time of phosphorylation resulted in looser gel network with more aggregation.

40|$|<b>Fish</b> <b>gelatin</b> (<b>FG)</b> is more {{suitable}} for consumption by religious people than mammalian gelatin. One common modification method of FG is mixing FG with polysaccharides. However, the mechanism is not clear. We found that FG gel containing 0. 1 g/ 100 mL gellan, 20 mmol/L CaCl 2 and 6. 67 g/ 100 mL FG (180 Bloom) matched gel strength, hardness, cohesiveness, chewiness as well as gelling temperature (T-g) and melting temperature (T-m) of commercial beef gelatin (BG) (240 Bloom). The modified FG was also observed by the result of helix/coil ratio and spherical aggregates. The modification decreased the diameter of FG 2 ̆ 7 s aggregates from 472 to 249 nm, which matched with BG (272 nm, P < 0. 05). Coexistence of segregative gellan-gellan fibrous aggregates and associated FG-gellan amorphous structure were also identified at the modified FG by atomic force microscope (AFM). The helix/coil ratio and diameter of spherical aggregates were inversely correlated, the mechanism behind was the strength of gelatin association. The involvement of hydrogen bond and presence of FG-gellan complex have been validated by urea addition and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. A schematic model was proposed. As modified FG successfully matched the of texture properties of BG, {{it is promising to}} replace BG with FG. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of molecular {{weight on the}} ability of <b>fish</b> <b>gelatin</b> (<b>FG)</b> to form and stabilize oil-in-water emulsions was examined. Low molecular weight fish gelatin (LMW–FG, ∼ 55 kDa) and high molecular weight fish gelatin (HMW–FG, 120 kDa) were used to prepare 20 wt% corn oil-in-water emulsions (pH 3. 0, 10 mM imidazole-acetate buffer). Emulsions with monomodal particle size distributions and small mean droplet diameters (d 43 ≈ 0. 35 μm for LMW–FG and 0. 71 μm for HMW–FG) could be produced at protein concentrations ≥ 4. 0 wt%. However, optical microscopy showed that there was always a small population of large droplets present in the emulsions after homogenization and some oil destabilization (≥ 2 wt%). The presence of these large droplets was attributed to the relatively low surface activity (c 1 / 2 = 0. 1 – 0. 2 wt%) of fish gelatin compared to globular proteins such as β-lactoglobulin (c 1 / 2 = 0. 004 wt%). Emulsions stabilized by LMW–FG contained a bigger population of large droplets than HMW–FG emulsions, but were more stable to creaming, which was attributed to depletion flocculation. Fish gelatin stabilized emulsions remained moderately stable to droplet aggregation and creaming after they were subjected to changes in holding temperature (30 or 90 °C for 30 min), salt concentration (NaCl≤ 250 mM) and pH (3 – 8). This study demonstrates that fish gelatin may have some limited use as a protein emulsifier in oil-in-water emulsions...|$|E

Protein solutions (0. 1 – 10  wt. %) were sonicated at an acoustic intensity of ∼ 34  W cm− 2 for 2  min. The structural and physical properties of the proteins were probed in terms of changes in size, hydrodynamic volume and molecular structure using DLS and SLS, intrinsic viscosity and SDS-PAGE, respectively. The emulsifying performance of ultrasound treated animal and vegetable proteins were compared to their untreated counterparts and Brij 97. Ultrasound treatment reduced the size of all proteins, {{with the exception of}} RPI, and no reduction in the primary structure molecular weight profile of proteins was observed in all cases. Emulsions prepared with all untreated proteins yielded submicron droplets at concentrations ≤ 1  wt. %, whilst at concentrations > 5  wt. % emulsions prepared with EWP, SPI and RPI yielded micron sized droplets (> 10  μm) due to pressure denaturation of protein from homogenisation. Emulsions produced with sonicated FG, SPI and RPI had the similar droplet sizes as untreated proteins at the same concentrations, whilst sonicated BG, EWP and PPI emulsions at concentrations ≤ 1  wt. % had a smaller droplet size compared to emulsions prepared with their untreated counterparts. This effect was consistent with the observed reduction in the interfacial tension between these untreated and ultrasound treated proteins...|$|E

40|$|The pure {{mammalian}} gelatin soft gel capsules on {{the market}} today dissolve after a short time in the acidic environment in the ventricle. Problems related to this are loss of functionality of the drug contained in the capsule and discomfort due to reflux when ingesting e. g. capsules containing fish oil. One of the aims {{of this study was to}} improve the composition of gelatin soft gel capsules, so the release of capsule content is delayed until it reaches the small intestine. This controlled release will give more efficient delivery of certain acid-sensitive drugs, and reduce discomfort for the consumer. It was also desirable to incorporate <b>fish</b> <b>gelatin</b> (<b>FG)</b> in the capsules, while retaining the gel strength. In order for the systems to be used in capsule production, the gel strength must be adequate for the gels to with stand the strain inflicted on them during the encapsulation process. Based on the promising results of previous work on kappa-carrageenan (κCG) /gelatin mixtures, the approach of this study was to apply iota-carrageenan (ιCG) in mixture with gelatin. The greater net negative charge of ιCG compared to κCG indicated that it would interact stronger with net positively charged gelatin, resulting in stronger films. The second main objective of this work was to gain better understanding of the interaction between ιCG and gelatin and the phase separation that occurs in these mixtures. ιCG/gelatin mixtures of different compositions were tested as films in diffusion/dissolution experiments that mimic the in-vivo conditions in the ventricle, and the rate of release of paracetamol through the films was measured. From small strain oscillatory measurements the gel strength (G’), melting temperature and gelling temperature for the gels was obtained. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was performed on films under different conditions, giving denaturation temperature and enthalpy change related to denaturation on a molecular level and phase transition. The mean percent released paracetamol in the diffusion/dissolution experiments was decreased from 100 % for the pure mammalian gelatin (MG) films, to 4. 4 % for the most acid-resistant MG/ιCG films. The gel strength of the gels with ιCG was lower than for the pure mammalian gelatin, due to lower content of mammalian gelatin. A strong correlation between gel strength and concentration of MG was observed. The FG/ιCG films had relatively low release of paracetamol, but the gel strength was too low for capsule production. Diffusion experiments and rheology measurements were performed on ιCG/MG and κCG/MG systems of constant composition except from varying type of cation present. This revealed that the properties of the ιCG/MG films were relatively independent of the salt concentration and cation type present. In comparison, the κCG/MG systems showed high dependence of the κCG specific cation K+. DSC measurements showed an increase in denaturation temperature for the films with ιCG. This indicates that the ιCG participates in stabilization of the helical junction zones in gelatin, so more energy is required for denaturation of the gel network. Visual observation of type A MG/ιCG and type B MG/ιCG mixtures, as well as of films of the same type in artificial gastric juice, showed increased turbidity when the pH was lower than the IEP of the respective gelatin. This indicates that an associative phase separation occurs due to electrostatic interaction between gelatin and ιCG. </p...|$|E

Method: We have been examining the use of <b>fish</b> <b>gelatin</b> and agarose as naturally gelling materials of marine origin as alternative ingredients in dermal tissue regeneration scaffolds. By formulating these materials into cryogels we have produced highly macroporous, morphologically uniform and elastic materials. Results: A range of gel formulations with varying degrees of cross-linking were examined for their rheological properties. The most favoured formulation was assessed for its ability to accommodate the attachment and proliferation of human dermal fibroblasts in cell culture over a defined time interval. Confocal laser scanning microscopy revealed that the cells readily infiltrated and proliferated within the scaffolds. Discussion: Cryogel formulations containing cross-linked <b>fish</b> <b>gelatin</b> and agarose show promise as dermal tissue replacement materials...|$|R
40|$|A three-layer {{laminate}} fi lm {{was developed}} {{with the following}} structure: polyethylene terephthalate (PET) /fi sh <b>gelatin</b> (<b>FG)</b> –nanoclay composite/low-density polyethylene (LDPE). The FG–nanoclay composite material functioned as the oxygen barrier layer and demonstrated comparable oxygen barrier properties when compared with a similar laminate utilizing ethylene vinyl alcohol as the barrier layer at a relative humidity (RH) of up to 50 %. The introduction of nanometer-sized fi ller clay into the FG matrix lowered the oxygen permeability (OP) because of the tortuosity effect of the clay particles. In addition, the FG–nanoclay composite fi lm exhibited bond strengths similar to both LDPE and PET. The hydrophilic nature of FG signifi cantly increases OP under high (> 50 %) RH conditions. However, this new FG laminate fi lm could be a possible alternative for packaging designers desiring a more sustainable packaging material for low-R...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Microbial {{activity}} {{is a primary}} cause of deterioration in many foods and is often responsible for reduced quality and safety. Food-borne illnesses associated with E. coli O 157 :H 7, S. aureus, S. enteritidis and L. monocytogenes are a major public health concern throughout the world. A number of methods have been employed to control or prevent the growth of these microorganisms in food. Antimicrobial packaging {{is one of the}} most promising active packaging systems for effectively retarding the growth of food spoilage and pathogenic microorganisms. The aim of this study was to determine the mechanical, physico-chemical properties and inhibitory effects of the <b>fish</b> <b>gelatin</b> films against selected food spoilage microorganisms when incorporated with catechin-lysozyme. Results The effect of the catechin-lysozyme combination addition (CLC: 0, 0. 125, 0. 25, and 0. 5 %, w/v) on <b>fish</b> <b>gelatin</b> film properties was monitored. At the level of 0. 5 % addition, the CLC showed the greatest elongation at break (EAB) at 143. 17 % with 0. 039 mm thickness, and the lowest water vapor permeability (WVP) at 6. 5 x 10 − 8 g·mm·h - 1 ·cm - 2 ·Pa - 1, whereas the control showed high tensile strength (TS) and the highest WVP. Regarding color attributes, the gelatin film without CLC addition gave the highest lightness (L * 91. 95) but lowest in redness (a *- 1. 29) and yellowness (b * 2. 25) values. The light transmission of the film did not significantly decrease and nor did film transparency (p> 0. 05) with increased CLC. Incorporating CLC could not affect the film microstructure. The solubility of the gelatin based film incorporated with CLC was not affected, especially at a high level of addition (p> 0. 05). Inhibitory activity of the <b>fish</b> <b>gelatin</b> film against E. coli, S. aureus, L. innocua and S. cerevisiae was concentration dependent. Conclusions These findings suggested that CLC incorporation can improve mechanical, physico-chemical, and antimicrobial properties of the resulting films, thus allowing the films to become more applicable in active food packaging. </p...|$|R
