A screen analysis is performed to distinguish sites for which only small ground deformations are likely from sites for which larger, more damaging landslide movements could occur.

The novel feature of the present screen procedure is that it accounts not only for the effects of ground motion amplitude on slope displacement, but also accounts for duration effects indirectly via the site seismicity. This formulation enables a more site-specific screen analysis than previous formulations that made a priori assumptions of seismicity/duration.

Standard blank was also used to remove the errors during standards preparation; it consists of reagent water and all reagents that are normally in contact with standard preparation. Calibration curve was used to determine the expected ion concentration of a measured sample. This curve contains at least three concentrations of each standard ion solution. By plotting the absorbance of the desired certified standard with its concentration, the curve must have a linear relationship with regression value (R 2) greater than 99  %.

40|$|GC/MS based {{metabolite}} profiling {{was used}} to explore potential metabolite biomarkers for Madison lung carcinoma 109 (M 109) in Balb/c mice. Newly discovered biomarkers could be beneficial to both detection and follow up therapy with novel antitumor agents such as EC 0225. Metabolites that were statistically significant and showed meaningful trends in <b>duplicate</b> <b>analyses</b> <b>were</b> categorized into two main groups. In the first group, the metabolite signal intensity decreased after tumor growth, but increased after treatment with EC 0225, while in the second group the intensity increased after tumor inoculation and decreased after EC 0225 was applied. ^ Urine from mice with M 109 tumors showed elevated levels of quinolinic acid, phenylpyruvic acid, 2, 3 -dihydroxybenzoic acid, and lactic acid. In addition, these samples showed lower levels of oxalic acid, L-homoserine, and 4 -hydroxy- 3 -methoxybenzoic acid. These results are valuable for understanding the metabolic basis of tumorigenesis and its possible reversal with drug therapy. The validation of these potential metabolite biomarkers could enhance the application and efficacy of existing and new treatment methods against the deadliest cancer. ...|$|R

30|$|Independent of the {{approach}} selected, either displacement or force-based, most of the seismic designs of civil structures are performed using variations of the response spectrum method, where the ground motion is represented as a design response spectrum that {{is representative of the}} seismic hazard on the site. The (pseudo-accelerations or relative displacements) design response spectrum is used to estimate the force or deformation demand imposed on the structure. The main goal of this technique is to translate the ground motion into forces acting on the building. Nevertheless, for some special tasks or structures, dynamic time history <b>analyses</b> <b>are</b> <b>required.</b> In the standard American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) 7 – 10, for example, if the structure meets the characteristics necessary to be considered as irregular, dynamic analyses (either modal response spectrum or time history) <b>are</b> <b>required</b> to verify the design of the structure. In the nuclear industry, dynamic time history <b>analyses</b> <b>are</b> <b>required</b> in the design, verification, and seismic assessment of critical buildings. In addition, they are needed for the development of floor (or in-structure) response spectra and free-field ground response spectra. When dynamic time history <b>analyses</b> <b>are</b> to be performed, the seismic input needs to be defined as a time history of accelerations. To comply with code requirements, the acceleration series used should be compatible with the design spectrum, i.e., the response spectrum of the acceleration time history should match with the design spectrum in average.|$|R
