25|$|Magee fled to England, {{where he}} was part of an IRA active service unit. On 7 June 1992 Magee and another IRA member, Michael O'Brien, were {{travelling}} in a car on the A64 road between York and Tadcaster, when they were stopped by the police. Magee and O'Brien were questioned by the unarmed police officers, who became suspicious and called <b>for</b> <b>back-up.</b> Magee shot Special Constable Glenn Goodman - who died later in hospital - and then shot the other officer, PC Kelly, four times. PC Kelly escaped death when a fifth bullet ricocheted off the radio he was holding to his ear, and the IRA members drove away. Another police car began to follow the pair, and came under fire near Burton Salmon. The lives of the officers in the car were in danger, but Magee and O'Brien fled the scene after a member of the public arrived. A manhunt was launched, and hundreds of police officers, many of them armed, searched woods and farmland. Magee and O'Brien evaded capture for four days by hiding in a culvert, before they were both arrested in separate police operations in the town of Pontefract.|$|E

25|$|When Allen read Robert Daley's book, Prince of the City (1978), she was {{convinced}} it was a Sidney Lumet project, but the film rights had already been sold to Orion Pictures for Brian De Palma and David Rabe. Allen {{let it be known}} that if that deal should fall through, then she wanted the picture for Sidney. Just as Lumet was about to sign for a different picture, they got the call that Prince of the City was theirs. Allen hadn't wanted to write Prince of the City, just produce it. She was put off by the book's non-linear story structure, but Lumet wouldn't make the picture without her and agreed to write the outline for her. Lumet and Allen went over the book and agreed on what they could use and what they could do without. To her horror, Lumet would come in every day for weeks and scribble on legal pads. She was terrified that she would have to tell him that his stuff was unusable, but to her delight the outline was wonderful and she went to work. It was her first project with living subjects, and Allen interviewed nearly everyone in the book and had endless hours of Bob Leuci's tapes <b>for</b> <b>back-up.</b> With all her research and Lumet's outline, she eventually turned out a 365-page script in 10 days. It was nearly impossible to sell the studio on a three-hour picture, but by offering to slash the budget to $10 million they agreed.|$|E

25|$|The Canucks had two {{competitors}} <b>for</b> the <b>back-up</b> goaltender position, Eddie Läck and Joacim Eriksson.

Eriksson was signed to a two-year, two-way, entry level contract with the Canucks in the off-season after helping Skellefteå AIK to the Swedish Hockey League championship. Though neither player had any NHL experience, Läck {{was seen as the}} front runner because of his one-way contract, which paid him the same at the NHL or AHL level.|$|R

2500|$|Weatherby Rifles {{such as the}} Dangerous Game Rifle {{and other}} Weatherby factory custom offerings are {{provided}} with open sights. Open sights tend to sight in quicker than scoped rifles {{and for this reason}} open sighted rifles are preferred by hunters <b>for</b> <b>back-up</b> work—when the hunter and/or guide must mount and discharge their firearm to ensure a charging game animal does not injure a client or to deliver a coup de grâce to a wounded game animal. It also has the added benefit of preventing the hunter from getting his eyebrow cut by the scope, which is not uncommon with a firearm with as much recoil as the [...]460 Weatherby Magnum.|$|E
2500|$|The International Energy Agency {{says that}} there has been too much {{attention}} on issue of the variability of renewable electricity production. The issue of intermittent supply applies to popular renewable technologies, mainly wind power and solar photovoltaics, and its significance depends on a range of factors which include the market penetration of the renewables concerned, the balance of plant and the wider connectivity of the system, as well as the demand side flexibility. Variability will rarely be a barrier to increased renewable energy deployment when dispatchable generation is also available. But at high levels of market penetration it requires careful analysis and management, and additional costs may be required <b>for</b> <b>back-up</b> or system modification. Renewable electricity supply in the 20-50+% penetration range has already been implemented in several European systems, albeit {{in the context of an}} integrated European grid system: ...|$|E
