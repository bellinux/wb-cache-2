50|$|The {{cost of this}} {{technology}} depends {{on a combination of}} factors, including the cost of paper, toner, drum replacement, as well as the replacement of other items such as the <b>fuser</b> <b>assembly</b> and transfer assembly. Often printers with soft plastic drums can have a very high cost of ownership that does not become apparent until the drum requires replacement.|$|E
50|$|The paper {{passes through}} rollers in the <b>fuser</b> <b>assembly,</b> where {{temperatures}} up to 200 C and pressure {{are used to}} permanently bond the toner to the paper. One roller is usually a hollow tube (heat roller) {{and the other is}} a rubber backed roller (pressure roller). A radiant heat lamp is suspended in the centre of the hollow tube, and its infrared energy uniformly heats the roller from the inside. For proper bonding of the toner, the fuser roller must be uniformly hot.|$|E
5000|$|Different {{printers}} implement {{these steps}} in distinct ways. LED printers use a linear array of light-emitting diodes to [...] "write" [...] {{the light on}} the drum. The toner is based on either wax or plastic, so that when the paper passes through the <b>fuser</b> <b>assembly,</b> the particles of toner melt. The paper {{may or may not be}} oppositely charged. The fuser can be an infrared oven, a heated pressure roller, or (on some very fast, expensive printers) a xenon flash lamp. The warmup process that a laser printer goes through when power is initially applied to the printer consists mainly of heating the fuser element.|$|E
