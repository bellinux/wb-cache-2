This extract was reduced to an aqueous phase in vacuo and partitioned with ethyl acetate at pH 7. 3 (NF, neutral fraction), pH 2. 8 (AF, acidic fraction), and again at pH 2. 8 following hydrolysis at pH 11 (HF, hydrolyzed fraction). Thin layer chromatography (TLC) on silica gel H in chloroform:ethyl acetate:formic acid (CHCl₃:EtOAc:HCOOH) produced a region between R(f) 's 0. 5 to 0. 6 from AF of B. sarothroides which inhibited wheat seed coleoptile and radicle growth 52. 7 % and 66. 5 %, respectively, using 500 ul of a 1. 9 mg/ul extract. This section inhibited wheat coleoptile straight growth 38. 6 % at the same concentration. Additional TLC, UV spectrophotometry, spray reagents, NMR, and GC/MS indicated that the compound was 3, 8 -dihydroxy- 5, 6, 7 -trimethoxy- 2 -(4 -methoxyphenyl) - 4 H- 1 -benzopyran- 4 -one at a concentration of 265 ug/g fresh weight. This compound significantly inhibited the wheat coleoptile straight growth bioassay 18. 4 % using 2 to 3 ug/ul. An 80 % methanol extract of H. acradenius leaves evaporated in vacuo produced an aqueous insoluble brown resin. This resin dissolved in absolute methanol and separated by TLC in CHCl₃:EtOAc:HCOOH contained a region between R(f) 's 0. 6 to 0. 7 that inhibited wheat seed coleoptile growth 71. 8 % and radicle growth 90. 7 % using 200 ul of 1. 5 mg/ul solution. Wheat coleoptile straight growth was inhibited 53. 7 % in this region at the same concentration. Further examination of this region by the same methods as those used for B. sarothroides indicated {{the presence of a}} C- 12 alkenyl alcohol (2 mg/ml), an aromatic <b>heterocyclic</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> (4 mg/ml), and an alkyl substituted version of 7 -hydroxycoumarin (5 mg/ml) at a concentration of 0. 7, 1. 4, and 1. 8 ug/g fresh weight, respectively.

The scheme includes a liquid-liquid partition to eliminate the aliphatics, a solid phase extraction on SiO 2 cartridge to remove the polar compounds and an HPLC fractionation to isolate the aromatic fraction. The purified extract enables the determination of PAH profile from 2 to 7 rings including their methyl derivatives and 3 carcinogenic benzonaphthothiophene isomers. The reproducibility of the method was estimated by analyzing 6 bitumen replicates and is around the 30 % overall uncertainty or less. In bitumen fumes generated at 170 °C under standardized conditions, VOC and semi-volatile PAH were sampled with XAD- 2 tubes and were also determined in six replicates. The VOCs are mainly monoaromatic derivatives (4 % of fumes) and aliphatics essentially from C 6 to C 17 (27 %). With regards to the particulate phase PAC, the coefficients of variation from 6 replicates are 5 - 24 % for PAH and 6 - 10 % for PASH. Data on VOC and PASH represent new contribution in the characterization of bitumen fumes.

30|$|Autoxidation is a {{conversion}} pathway {{that has the}} potential to add value to multinuclear aromatic-rich coal liquids, heavy oils and bitumens, which are typically considered low-value liquids. In particular, autoxidation of these heavy materials could lead to products that may have petrochemical values, e.g., lubricity improvers and emulsifiers. Proper assessment of an oxidative transformation to ring-open the multinuclear aromatics present in heavy feeds relies on the understanding of the fundamentals of aromatic oxidation. This work reviews the selective oxidation chemistry of atoms that form part of an aromatic ring structure using oxygen (O 2) as oxidant, i.e., the oxidation of aromatic carbons as well as heteroatoms contained in an aromatic ring. Examples of industrially relevant oxidations of aromatic and <b>heterocyclic</b> aromatic <b>hydrocarbons</b> are provided. The requirements to produce oxygenates involving the selective cleavage of the ring C–C bonds, as well as competing non-selective oxidation reactions are discussed. On the other hand, the Clar formalism, i.e., a rule that describes the stability of polycyclic systems, assists the interpretation of the reactivity of multinuclear aromatics towards oxidation. Two aspects are developed. First, since the interaction of oxygen with aromatic hydrocarbons depends on their structure, oxidation chemistries which are fundamentally different are possible, namely, transannular oxygen addition, oxygen addition to a carbon–carbon double bond, or free radical chemistry. Second, hydrogen abstraction is not necessary for the initiation of the oxidation of aromatics compared to that of aliphatics.|$|R

Here, we present a study focusing on the identification and quantification of clastogenic and aneugenic effects in the micronucleus assay with the fish liver cell line RTL-W 1 that was originally derived from rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). Real concentrations of the test items after incubation without cells were determined to assess chemical losses due to, e. g., sorption or volatilization, by means of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.

40|$|Crude {{oils and}} 			sediments {{extracts}} from Kohat-Potwar Basin (Upper Indus Basin) were 			examined for polycyclic aromatic <b>hydrocarbons</b> (PAHs), <b>heterocyclic</b> 			aromatic <b>hydrocarbons,</b> biomarkers and stable isotope compositions. 			The first four chapters provide background to the research. Chapter 			 5 discusses the petroleum geochemistry of Potwar Basin where three 			groups of oils were recognized {{on the basis}} of diagnostic 			biomarkers, distribution of PAHs and stable bulk carbon and hydrogen 			isotopes. In chapter 6, PAHs distributions and compound specific 			stable hydrogen isotope compositions have been used to assess minor 			biodegradation in Potwar Basin oils. The final chapter of this 			thesis (chapter 7) describes the formation of <b>heterocyclic</b> aromatic 			<b>hydrocarbons</b> and fluorenes in sedimentary organic matter through 			carbon catalysis reactions. 			Diagnostic biomarker parameters along with stable bulk 13 C and D 			isotope abundance reveal three groups of oils in Potwar Basin. Group 			A contains terrestrial source of OM deposited in highly oxic/fluvio-deltaic 			clastic depositional environment shown by high Pr/Ph, high diahopane/hopane, 			high diasterane/sterane, low DBT/P ratios and higher relative 			abundance of C 19 tricyclic and C 24 tetracyclic terpanes. Aliphatic 			biomarkers for rest of the oils indicate marine origin however two 			ranges of values for parameters differentiate them into two 			sub-groups (B and C). Group B oils are generated from clastic rich 			source rocks deposited in marine suboxic depositional environment 			than group C oils which are generated from source rocks deposited in 			marine oxic depositional environment. Group C oils show higher 			marine OM (algal input) indicated by extended tricyclic terpanes (upto 			C 41 or higher) and higher steranes/hopanes ratios. Distribution of 			PAHs classified Potwar Basin oils into similar three groups based on 			depositional environments and source OM variations. Abundant 			biphenyls (BPs) and fluorenes (Fs) are observed in group A oils 			while group B oils showed higher abundance of dibenzothiophenes (DBTs) 			and negligible presence of dibenzofurans (DBFs) and Fs and group C 			oils showed equal abundance of DBTs and Fs. This relative abundance 			of <b>heterocyclic</b> aromatic <b>hydrocarbons</b> in Potwar Basin oils broadly 			indicate that the distribution of these compounds is controlled by 			depositional environment of OM where sulfur compounds (i. e. DBTs) 			are higher in marine source oils while oxygen compounds (DBFs) and 			Fs are higher in oxic/deltaic depositional environment oils. Higher 			abundance of aromatic biomarkers the 1, 2, 5 -trimethylnaphthalene 			(1, 2, 5 -TMN), 1 -methylphenanthrene (1 -MP) and 			 1, 7 -dimethylphenanthrene (1, 7 -DMP) indicate major source of OM for 			group A oil is higher plant supported by abundance of conifer plants 			biomarker retene. Variations in distribution of triaromatic steroids 			(TAS) in Potwar Basin oils clearly indicate source dependent of 			these compounds rather than thermal maturity. Higher abundance of 			C 20 and C 21 TAS and substantional difference in distribution of long 			chain TAS (C 26, C 27, C 28) between the groups indicate different 			source origin of these compounds. Group A shows only C 27 and C 28 TAS 			while group B shows C 25 to C 28 TAS and absence of these compounds in 			group C oils revealed that the sterol precursors for these compounds 			are most probably different. Aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbon 			maturation parameters indicate higher (late oil generation) thermal 			maturity for all oils from the Potwar Basin. The crude oils of group 			A and C are typically non-biodegraded mature crude oils whereas some 			of the oils from group B showed minor biodegradation indicated by 			higher Pr/n-C 17, Ph/n-C 18 and low API gravity. 			Distribution of PAHs and stable hydrogen isotopic composition (D) 			of nalkanes and isoprenoids has been used to assess the minor 			biodegradation in a suite of eight crude oils from Potwar Basin, 			Pakistan (group B). The low level of biodegradation under natural 			reservoir conditions was established {{on the basis of}} biomarker 			distributions. Bulk stable hydrogen isotope of saturated fractions 			of crude oils show an enrichment in D with increase in 			biodegradation and show a straight relationship with biodegradation 			indicators i. e. Pr/n-C 17, API gravity. For the same oils, D values 			for the n-alkanes relative to the isoprenoids are enriched in 			deuterium (D). The data are consistent with the removal of 			D-depleted low-molecular-weight (LMW) n-alkanes (C 14 -C 22) from the 			oils. The D values of isoprenoids do not change during the minor 			biodegradation and are similar for all the samples. The average D 			enrichment for n-alkanes with respect to the 			isoprenoids is found to be as much as 35 for the most biodegraded 			sample. The relative susceptibility of alkylnaphthalenes and 			alkylphenanthrenes at low levels of biodegradation was discussed. 			Alkylnaphthalenes are more susceptible to biodegradation than 			alkylphenanthrenes while extent of biodegradation decreases with 			increase in alkyl substitution on both naphthalene and 			phenanthrenes. A range of biodegradation ratios (BR) are purposed 			from dimethylnaphthalene (DNBR), trimethylnaphthalenes (TNBR) and 			tetramethylnaphthalene (TeNBR) that show significant differences in 			values with increasing biodegradation and are suggested as good 			indicators for assessment of low level of biodegradation. 			Laboratory experiments have shown that activated carbon catalyses 			the reactions of biphenyls (BPs) with surface adsorbed reactants 			that incorporate S, O, N or methylene forming some common 			constituents of sedimentary organic matter namely, dibenzothiophene 			(DBT), dibenzofuran (DBF), carbazole (C) and fluorene (F).

The de-sorption volume, the desorption temperature, and the desorp-tion flow are compared, together with the suitability of both methods for analytes of varying volatilities.

40|$|Consumers demand, in {{addition}} to excellent eating quality, high standards of microbial and chemical safety in shelf-stable foods. This requires improving conventional processing technologies and developing new alternatives such as pressure-assisted thermal processing (PATP). Studies in PATP foods on the kinetics of chemical reactions at temperatures (approximately 100 to 120 Â°C) inactivating bacterial spores in low-acid foods are severely lacking. This review focuses on a specific chemical safety risk in PATP foods: models predicting if the activation volume value (V a) of a chemical reaction is positive or negative, and indicating if the reaction rate constant will decrease or increase with pressure, respectively, are not available. Therefore, the pressure effect on reactions producing toxic compounds must be determined experimentally. A recent model solution study showed that acrylamide formation, a potential risk in PATP foods, is actually inhibited by pressure (that is, itsV avalue must be positive). This favorable finding was not predictable and {{still needs to be}} confirmed in food systems. Similar studies are required for other reactions producing toxic compounds including polycyclic aromatic <b>hydrocarbons,</b> <b>heterocyclic</b> amines, N-nitroso compounds, and hormone like-peptides.

40|$|AbstractThe {{objectives}} of {{present study were}} to assess the antimicrobial and antioxidant potential of Capsicum frutescens L. seeds and to characterize the chemical constituents of the crude extracts. The n-hexane and chloroform extracts were analyzed using gas chromatography–mass spectroscopy (GC–MS), which showed the presence of many biologically important volatile constituents, including <b>heterocyclic</b> compounds, β-diketones, <b>hydrocarbons,</b> long chain aliphatic carboxylic acids, and their derivatives, such as esters, hydroxy ester, and aromatic compounds. The amounts of the total phenolic content and the total flavonoid content in same the extracts were in the ranges of 7. 95 – 26. 15 gallic acid equivalents (GAE mg/g) and 4. 64 – 12. 84 rutin equivalents (RU mg/g) of dry weight of extract, respectively. In {{the determination of the}} in vitro antimicrobial activity, seed extracts prevented the growth of most of the tested pathogens by forming significant inhibition zones. The inhibitory activity was especially remarkable (inhibition zone≥ 13 mm) against Pesudomaonas aeruginosa, Klebsilla pneumonae, Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans. During the evaluation of the in vitro antioxidant activity via DPPH assay, n-hexane and chloroform extracts showed 26. 9 % and 30. 9 % free radical scavenging abilities, respectively, at the concentration of 1 mg/mL.

40|$|The large {{variety of}} {{microbial}} {{species in the}} human microbiome plays an impor-tant role in human health by affecting tissue differentiation, modulation of the immune system, {{as well as the}} general response against infectious pathogens. The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) contributes to immune homeostasis as having an antimi-crobial role on the one hand – owing to AhR-dependent IL- 22 transcription – and, on the other, an anti-inflammatory role in that it mediates the differentiation of regulatory T cells (Tregs). Here, we have examined the multifaceted physiological role of AhR as resulting from the vast array of recently described AhR ligands and of the multiplicity of AhR-expressing cells in host-microbial symbiosis in mammals. THE PROMISCUOUS NATURE OF AhR AGONISTS Aryl hydrocarbon receptor is a ligand-dependent transcription factor activated by a variety of synthetic and natural molecules. In particular, ligands of AhR include <b>hydrocarbons,</b> <b>heterocyclic</b> amines, and indole-derived compounds. Dioxin (2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin; TCDD) represents the prototypical envi-ronmental and most potent AhR ligand known (1). In addition, a variety of herbal extracts – such as ginseng, licorice, and gingko biloba – stimulate AhR DNA bind-ing and the downstream transcription of numerous genes, thus indicating that AhR might have evolved to respond to mainly dietary products to which animals and humans are chronically exposed (2).

40|$|Opaque, viscous tars {{derived from}} the {{carbonization}} of fossile carbon feedstocks, such coal tars and creosote, are long-term sources of groundwater contamination, predominantly with poly- and <b>heterocyclic</b> aromatic <b>hydrocarbons</b> (PAH). The dissolution, ageing and migratory behavior of dense, non aqueous phase liquid (DNAPL) coal tar blobs and pools forming at the aquitard is not sufficiently understood to estimate the risk and adequately design groundwater treatment measures at a contaminated site. In this study, we investigate the composition and dissolution of a migrated, aged creosote DNAPL and corresponding experimental and groundwater profiles using comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography (GCxGC-MS). GC-FID unresolved compounds were attributed to methylated homocyclic species using GCxGC-MS in the Methylanthracene weight range. Equilibrium concentrations were estimated using Raoult’s law, assuming non-ideal behavior. Low molecular weight compounds {{were found to be}} prevalent even after decades of weathering, with Naphthalene (8 % by mass) representing the most abundant identified compound, contrary to the expected preferential depletion of hydrophilic compounds. Morevoer, dimethylnaphthalenes were relatively more abundant in the aqueous boundary layer than in the DNAPL. DNAPL migration over 400 m with the groundwater flow effected lower viscosity and specific gravity of the migrated phase body in a superposition of weathering, transport and aquifer chromatography effects. Based on a decomposition of analysed and estimated constituents using the group contribution approach, reference DNAPL values for activity coefficients γi were used to model aqueous solubilities for selected compounds. Anthracene was close to its theoretical precipitation limit in the bulk DNAPL. While laboratory and modelled DNAPL dissolution behavior agree well, field data imply the presence of specific interfacial in situ processes significantly impacting dissolution processes. Based on aqueous GCxGC-MS profiles over the DNAPL, a hypothetical interfacial in situ film was calculated to be composed primarily of Phenanthrene, with minor contribution by Naphthalene, possibly forming a viscous barrier for the dissolution of lower molecular weight PAH. The main advances and gaps in electron donor DNAPL understanding are discussed regarding our conception of weathered, migrating hydrophobic DNAPL bodies in the aquifer of historic contaminated sites for the adequate treatment of contaminated water...|$|R
40|$|The {{assessment}} of chemicals and new compounds {{is an important}} task of ecotoxicology. In this thesis a newly developed zero-valent iron material for nanoremediation of groundwater contaminations was investigated and in vitro bioassays for high throughput screening were developed. These two elements of the thesis were combined to assess the remediation efficiency of the nanomaterial on the groundwater contaminant acridine. The developed in vitro bioassays were evaluated for quantification of the remediation efficiency. Within the NAPASAN project developed iron based nanomaterial showed in a model field application its nanoremediation capabilities to reduce organic contaminants in a cost effective way. The ecotoxicological evaluation of the nanomaterial in its reduced and oxidized form was conducted with various ecotoxicological test systems. The effects of the reduced nanomaterial with field site resident dechlorinating microorganisms like Dehalococcoides sp., Desulfitobacterium sp., Desulfomonile tiedjei, Dehalobacter sp., Desulfuromonas sp. have been investigated in batch und column experiments. A short-term toxicity of the reduced nanomaterial was shown. However, in a prolonged investigation the NZVI did not show any chronic toxic effects to dechlorinating microorganisms in a time-frame up to 300 days. The contribution of this thesis was the toxicological {{assessment of}} the oxidized nanomaterial with ecotoxicological model organisms like Desmodesmus subspicatus, Daphnia magna, Danio rerio and Salmonella typhimurium. The oxidized NZVI showed a toxicity at elevated concentrations of > 100 mg/L. The most sensitive test system was the Daphnia acute toxicity test with an EC 50 value of 163 mg/L. All other test systems showed a lower or no toxicity of the nanomaterial. Therefore, the nanomaterial can be applied in nanoremediation applications without comprehensive constrains. Especially, as these elevated concentrations will only occur at the contaminated hot spots during the application of this technology {{as it has been}} shown that a transport away from the remediation site is not probable. As a second element of this thesis the development of in vitro bioassays to elucidate toxicity in high throughput applications have been conducted. Therefore, the micro-EROD bioassay to determine the CYP 1 A-inducing potential of samples was developed. Recently, its protocol to investigate environmental sample was presented in Nature protocols in detail. This protocol can be applied to a multitude of samples types (feed and food, chemicals, sediments etc.) und has the advantage of sensitivity and ready to use methodology. Evolving this bioassay new cell lines in a serum-free animal component-free chemically defined medium and suspension culturing conditions have been developed. The investigations with reference compounds like TCDD showed that these newly developed cell lines were highly comparable to the established adherent cell lines. The EC 50 value for the newly developed H 4 IIE-S cell lines was 11 pM, which was comparable to the adherent H 4 IIE cell line. The adherent cell line was presented in literature with EC 50 values ranging from 5 pM to 47 pM. The newly developed system showed the feasibility of high throughput with clear financial benefits in comparison to the established technology, as the cultivation in suspension is more cost efficient. In this cultivation mode the whole volume is used for cultivation compared to adherent cell lines for which only the surface of a culturing vessel can be used. As synthesis the effect of the newly developed NZVI on a model compound in co-exposure has been investigated. The <b>heterocyclic</b> polyaromatic <b>hydrocarbon</b> acridine was applied as a model contaminant as it showed in literature mechanism specific toxicity. It was selected to evaluate the application of bioassays for the assessment of the remediation efficiency of the newly developed nanomaterial. At first the co-exposure of the iron nanomaterial with acridine was evaluated in the fish embryo toxicity test with accompanying instrumental analysis. The results showed a toxicity of acridine with an EC 50 value of 1 mg/L, which was comparable to results obtained in literature. The newly developed NZVI did not show any effects on acridine in the fish embryo toxicity test and the instrumental analysis. Additionally, the micro-EROD bioassay did not indicate any dioxin-like potential for this compound. These results were not expected as acridine showed dioxin-like activity and NZVI were applied for remediation of <b>heterocyclic</b> polyaromatic <b>hydrocarbons</b> like acridine in literature. Various factors like passivation of the nanomaterial or a high stability of the model compound could have influenced the outcome of the investigations. For the in vitro investigations of the dioxin-like potential of acridine a substrate inhibition or a species related low receptor affinity could have caused this results. Both elements should be investigated in follow-up studies. The application of a dioxin-like activity monitoring in vitro bioassay to elucidate the remediation efficiency was not successful. Therefore, another compound should be applied as the model groundwater pollutant. Possible candidate substances are PAHs or β-naphthoflavone or TCDD as they are more potent CYP 1 -inducer. Nevertheless, in vitro bioassays can be applied as monitoring tools for remediation applications. Especially, for effect directed analysis in vitro bioassays are suitable to elucidate the fraction with a specific toxicity. For this application the newly developed cell lines in suspension are especially beneficial. They can be used to investigate extracts of environmental samples with reduced handling effort and thus improve the analytical throughput significantly...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine whether inoculating a hybrid fixed-film bioreactor with exogenous bacterial and diatoma species would increase the removal of chemical oxygen demand, nitrogenous compounds and suspended solids from a real-time coal gasification wastewater to meet environmental discharge requirements specified for petrochemical refineries. The COD removal increased by 25 % (45 % to 70 %) at a relatively high inoculum dosage (370 g∙m− 3) and unit treatment cost (12. 21 €∙m− 3). The molar ratio of monovalent cations to divalent cations (M/D > 2) affected nitrification, settling of solids and dewatering of the sludge. The use of a low-charge cationic flocculant decreased the suspended solids in the effluent by 70 % (180 mg∙L− 1 to 54 mg∙L− 1) and increased the sludge dewatering rate by 88 % (61 s∙L∙g− 1 to 154 s∙L∙g− 1) at a unit treatment cost of 2. 5 €∙t− 1 dry solids. Organic compounds not removed by the indigenous and exogenous microbial species included benzoic acids (aromatic carboxylic acids), 2 -butenoic acid (short-chain unsaturated carboxylic acid), I(2 H) -isoquinolinone (heterocyclic amine), hydantoins (highly polar <b>heterocyclic</b> compounds), long-chain <b>hydrocarbon</b> length (carbon length > C 15) and squalene. These organic compounds can thus be classified as poorly degradable or nonbiodegradable which contributed to the 30 % COD not removed by the H-FFBR. The use of exogenous microbial species improved the quality of CGWW; however, not sufficiently to meet discharge requirements. The cost of such treatment to meet discharge requirements would be unsustainable. Alternative technologies need to be investigated for reusing or recycling the CGWW rather than discharging.

40|$|Asphalt has an {{important}} share in the road construction {{as it is the}} major material used to build roads. Roads are assets to the society and an integral component {{in the development of a}} nation’s infrastructure. The production of asphalt and the different phases it goes through before it becomes a road have a massive impact on the environment. For the asphalt production bitumen binder is used. Bitumen is a complex mixture of organic compounds, primarily composed of high boiling point and high molecular weight hydrocarbons, whose molecules are combinations of the familiar petroleum structural building units. Its physical behavior can be explained by considering it a colloidal system whose properties are influenced by the interactions of various empirically defined generic compound classes. Bitumen overall composition depends on the composition of the crude petroleum oil from which it is obtained, as well as the techniques used to refine and process it. Bitumens are used to form produce for many applications, including the use of hot-mix, warm mix, reclaimed asphalt mixing in road construction and maintenance. At ambient temperatures bitumen is a stable, semi-solid substance and does not present any health risks. In road construction industry during manufacturing, storage, transportation and use bitumen is heated giving off hydrocarbon emissions, to which workers may be exposed. Bitumen emissions are complex and variable mixtures of inorganic particulate and organic compounds that include aliphatics, polycyclic aromatic <b>hydrocarbons</b> (PAHs) and <b>heterocyclic</b> aromatic compounds containing sulfur, nitrogen, and oxygen. In recent years there has been increasing interest in investigating the potential of bitumen emissions to cause health effects in exposed workers. Bitumen remains a focus for health effects research however, primarily due to the presence of small amounts of PAHs in the product and uncertainty about the associated health risks from exposure to emissions from hot bitumen. The bitumen industry is working closely with regulatory and scientific bodies to resolve remaining questions. Further studies are in progress, employing state of the art techniques, as Warm Mix Asphalt (WMA), which should resolve finally the question whether exposure to bitumen emissions presents a cancer risk. In addition to the health effects research discussed has been active in promoting strategies to reduce worker exposure to emissions from hot bitumen work. Warm-mix asphalts are produced and placed at temperatures typically 10 - 40 °C lower that conventional rolled asphalt. With the decreased production temperature comes the additional benefit of reduced emissions from burning fuels, fumes, and odors generated at the plant and the paving site. Disadvantages of WMA are elevate costs and it is only about 3 to 8 years (depending on method) since the earliest WMA field tests were started and therefore its long-term performance is still unproven. Workers in road construction industry include asphalt plant workers, ground construction workers and road paving workers. These individuals can be exposed to a wide range of potentially hazardous substances emitted from hot bitumen. Modern road paving workers are typically exposed to 0. 1 to 2 mg/m 3 of bitumen fume which includes 10 to 200 ng/m 3 of benzo(a) pyrene. Information on determinants of other exposures in road construction is either absent or limited. International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) historical cohort study of asphalt industry since 1993, evaluated in 2011 bitumen emissions as possible carcinogenic to humans during road paving. Bitumen fume exposures during asphalt plants or outdoor hot mix paving and surface dressing can be expected to be similar. This comparison can be confounded by presence on organic matter of non-bitumen origin. Exposure to PAH can be anticipated to be elevated, when coal tar is added to paving mixtures. There is also some evidence that the exposures have been higher in the past. However, misclassification of exposure in such grouping can be expected to be substantial and its magnitude and direction would be impossible to quantify. Assembling industrial hygiene measurements from various studies into a single database and obtaining access to unpublished data may help refine exposure assessment in road construction industry. Very little information is available regarding environmental exposure to asphalt emissions. Results from direct human exposure monitoring indicate that the physical character of asphalt emissions released to the atmosphere during paving operations is composed of mineral particulate matter and hydrocarbons, including higher molecular weight PAHs. Estimates of total atmospheric PAH emissions suggest that the contributions from the paving industry are very small. The PAHs that are released will primarily adsorb to airborne particulate matter. Some of these PAHs will be deposited in a few days, while some may remain in the atmosphere for several weeks. No information is available concerning the deposition of airborne asphalt emissions onto land. Various methods are used to monitor bitumen-derived vapors, aerosols and fumes from heated bitumen. The more conventional methods are Total Particulate Matter (TPM) or solvent soluble/organic particulate matter (e. g., Benzene-Soluble Matter (BSM)). Recently more often the amount of total organic matter (TOM) in both aerosol and vapor is determined. Different official methods for PAH analysis in bitumen fumes have been propose. Due to the existence of numerous structural isomers of the PAHs, chromatographic separation either by Gas Chromatography (GC) coupled with universal Flame Ionization Detection (FID), Mass Spectrometry (MS) or High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) coupled with ultraviolet or Fluorescence Detection (FD) is generally employed for isomer-specific identification and quantification. At present, no international standard for the assessment of exposure to bitumen fume exists. As a result, reported values of exposures over time, between studies within the same country, and between the various countries vary significantly and must be considered carefully as to the intended use. In order to personal study of bitumen emissions, a special fume generation system has been developed to identify the polycyclic aromatic <b>hydrocarbons</b> and <b>heterocyclic</b> aromatic compounds, emitted from different types of Reclaimed Asphalt Pavement (RAP) regarding two temperature regimes 300 °C and 500 °C. The ten types of <b>heterocyclic</b> aromatic <b>hydrocarbons</b> and seventeen types of PAHs were identified and analyzed in this experiment. This study shows that increasing temperature leads to an increase of PAHs and heterocyclic aromatic compound emissions. Regarding the assessment of bitumen emissions as possible indicator of carcinogenic exposure, bitumen fumes generated at high temperatures (for 500 °C in our experiment) are more likely to generate polycyclic aromatic <b>hydrocarbons,</b> carcinogenic PAHs, <b>Heterocyclic</b> Aromatic <b>Hydrocarbons</b> than fumes generated at lower temperatures (for 300 °C in our experiment). However, from our results we can note that low temperature produces low emissions, but with higher percent of carcinogenic PAHs and benzene emissions of total emissions. This result seems quite surprising for us. The obtained results of Relative Carcinogenic Factor (RCF) show that decreasing of temperature leads to a decrease of RCF. Several studies have dealt with fumes from bitumen emissions, there was report that chemical composition of bitumen fumes varies and depends on crude petroleum sources, type of asphalt, temperature and mixing during the manufacturing process, unfortunately, we do not know the composition of RAP in this experiment, in that case we cannot give more well interpretation of fumes emitted from bitumen. We can just highlight that the temperature of heated bitumen is the key parameter in order to control the emission, and low temperature reduces the possible carcinogenic effect of heated bitumen. This study would be helpful to monitor health impacts of workers involved in road construction industry...|$|R
40|$|The {{volatile}} aroma {{compounds in}} the green plant tissue and grain of five Australian rice varieties were studied in detail. Selected volatile aroma compounds, including 2 -acetyl- 1 - pyrroline (AP), observed in three fragrant varieties, YRF 203, YRF 205 and Kyeema and two non-fragrant varieties, Pelde and Langi, were compared. The development of volatile aroma compounds in the rice plant was followed from early tillering to full maturity. The effect of nitrogen fertilisation level on the volatile aroma compound composition was evaluated. Volatile compounds were extracted by the Likens-Nickerson simultaneous distillation-extraction technique. GC-MS, GC-FID and GC-O were used to separate, identify and quantify the volatile aroma compounds in the rice grain and plant extracts. The 127 volatile compounds identified in rice plant tissue and grain included 28 aldehydes, 23 ketones, 20 alcohols, 8 phenolic compounds, 17 <b>heterocyclic</b> compounds, 7 <b>hydrocarbons,</b> 2 sulphur compounds, 5 terpenes, 11 acids and 6 esters. Most of the homologous series of aliphatic aldehydes, ketones and alcohols that were identified in cooked rice were also identified in plant tissue, but in different proportions. AP was the major volatile compound in fragrant rice plant and grain and was probably the major factor {{that contributed to the}} difference between fragrant and non-fragrant varieties. Relative levels of AP in rice plant correlated with the relative level of AP in the rice plant of the same variety. Therefore, AP concentration in rice plant tissue can be used as an early indicator of aroma in rice grain. The non-fragrant whole rice contained more pent-l-en- 3 - one, D-Limonene and hepta- 2, 4 -dienal than fragrant rice, while fragrant rice contained more but- 2 -enal, hex- 2 -en-l-ol, pyridine and AP. Milled fragrant rice contained more but- 2 -enal, pyridine, AP and pyrrole than non-fragrant rice. The increase in nitrogen fertilisation resulted in an increase of AP in rice plant tissue and grain in fragrant varieties. In addition, the increase in nitrogen fertilisation resulted in an increase in pyridine, hepta- 2, 4 -dienal and 2 -methoxyphenol in the mature rice plant and an increase of pentanal, hexanal, pyridine, heptan- 2 -one, pentan-l-ol, hexan-l-ol, oct-l-en- 3 - ol and furfural in milled rice. AP concentration was relatively high at the beginning of plant development and then decreased during plant development. Therefore, AP can be detected at the early stages of plant development, without having to wait until grain maturity...|$|R
40|$|An {{attempt was}} made to {{evaluate}} the importance of smoke and toxic gas inhalation in fires by comparing the volatile constituents in blood taken from fire fatalities with those of normal healthy and post-mortem controls. At the initial stage of the project, particular attention was given to the measurement of carbonyl compounds which represent a series of toxic and strongly irritant thermal degradation products from many polymeric materials. Three analytical methods, namely, i) gas chromatographic analysis of carbonyls after conversion to their corresponding 2, 4 -dinitrophenyl hydrazone derivatives, ii) direct static headspace gas chromatography, and iii) dynamic headspace gas chromatography, were compared for their applicability to the measurement of carbonyls in blood. Problems associated with binding of carbonyls to blood proteins were experienced in the first two methods which precluded their use for this application. The latter method was found to be most suitable in this respect since the bound carbonyls were released during the purging process. The method was also the most sensitive and when used in conjunction with a mass spectrometer, a detection limit in the nanogram per millilitre range was obtained. Volatiles in blood were extracted by purging the samples (1 ml) with 0. 6 litre of helium and collecting the components on a small Tenax-GC column. The volatiles were then thermally desorbed and analysed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry using a 100 m x 0. 5 mm i. d. Carbowax 20 M SCOT column. The sorption technique was found to extract a wide range of volatile components from blood enabling a comparison of volatile profiles to be made. Thus initially organic nitriles as well as the carbonyl compounds were quantified. Volatile components were identified by comparison of their retention indices and mass spectra with those of authentic standards. Where the latter were not available, tentative identifications were made 9 n the basis of their mass spectral data only. Quantification of carbonyls and nitriles was achieved by comparing their response ratios to those from an external standard under identical conditions. During the period from August 1981 to May 1982, thirty-one blood volatile profiles were studied. These included four normal healthy controls and six post-mortem controls. In general, more complex profiles were found in fire fatalities than those of the controls. Over 140 chemical species have been identified in these! profiles and these include series of carbonyls, nitriles, alcohols, esters, aliphatic and aromatic <b>hydrocarbons,</b> halogenated <b>hydrocarbons,</b> <b>heterocyclic</b> compounds and sulphur-containing compounds. A detailed examination of the profiles has indicated that those compounds which might be of significance fell into two main catagories: those which were strong sensory and respiratory irritants, and those which were depressants of the central nervous system. Quantitative measurements of carbonyls in blood have shown that the mean levels of 2 -butanone, butandione, 2 -pentanone, cyclopentanone, cyclohexanone and hexanal were higher in fire fatalities than those in the controls. Of particular concern were the very high levels of acetonitrile and the presence of acrolein Ca highly toxic and strong sensory irritant) in the blood of some of the fire fatalities. Although the toxicological significance of these gaseous toxicants in causing fire fatalities has yet to be established, the results have clearly demonstrated that most of the fire deaths included in this exposed {{to a wide range of}} toxicants. these compounds may have played a vital incapacitation during the fire...|$|R
40|$|Earth’s {{accessible}} freshwater {{resources are}} under constant pressure. Most of the 35 million cubic kilometers freshwater are bound in glaciers (over 68 %), permanent snow und not accessible groundwater resources. Accessible freshwater {{is crucial for}} mankind as well as ecosystems functions in general. At the same time, over 50 % of all renewable and accessible freshwater flows are already used by mankind. In Europe only 21 % of the available freshwater are used {{and most of it}} is not consumed but restored. Therefore, Europe’s problems related to freshwater supply do not depend on absolute quantity but on distribution, alterations of the hydromorpholgy and an increasing number of (anthropogenic) pollutants. Because of their potential to disrupt the reproduction over altering the endocrine system one important and heavy discussed group of micropollutants are the endocrine disruptive compounds (EDCs). In the last years more and more (potential) EDCs have been detected in the environment as well as organic tissues of humans and wildlife. For the prediction of a substance’s endocrine activity a first screening with QSAR tools (e. g. OECD QSAR Toolbox, VirtualToxLab) is useful. These predictions actually are good in case of receptor binding properties if the chemical structure is known. To screen samples for known EDCs, chemical analysis is a fast and sensitive approach. For example, to date it is possible to detect estrogens in the low ng∙L- 1 range (e. g. 0. 3 ng∙L- 1 17 ß-Estradiol) in groundwater samples with a LC system coupled to a triple-stage quadrupole mass spectrometer with electrospray ion source (LC-ESI-MS 2). Nevertheless, to detect unknown endocrine disruptive potentials of a substance or to screen an environmental sample with unknown composition, bioassays are the methods of choice. In the present study, the two recombinant receptor-reporter assays lyticase assisted yeast estrogen screen (LYES) and “estrogen receptor mediated chemical activated luciferase gene expression” (ER CALUX®) assay as well as the H 295 R steroidogenesis assay, that allows the detection of effects on the whole steroid synthesis pathway, were applied. Additionally, a variation of the in vivo reproduction test with the New Zealand mudsnail Potamopyrgus antipodarum (Pa-Repro) has been used. This bioassay battery therefore covers receptor-mediated activities as well as activities on the process of steroid genesis and impacts on whole organisms as well as populations. To get insights into the development as well as international validation of knew test systems for the detection of EDCs the validation of the newly developed H 295 R was scientifically attended. It could be shown that the H 295 R successfully detected all suspected or known EDCs with good correlations between the different laboratories. Nevertheless, beside the number of advantages of this test system some disadvantages were also figured. Those were the high variability of steroid concentration between different passages as well as the high costs for the detection of produced steroids. To overcome the disadvantages several approaches to improve the test system were pursued. At first cells were adapted to chemical defined media which lead to a more stable production of steroids. With {{the development of a new}} ELISA method for the detection of steroids in the exposure medium both costs as well as working time could be saved. Hereafter, the selected bioassay battery was applied to various sample matrices as well as single substances. Both LYES and ER CALUX® were used to assess the estrogenic activity of <b>heterocyclic</b> aromatic <b>hydrocarbons</b> (hetero-PAHs). While none of the hetero-PAHs showed estrogenicity in the LYES, nine (indole, 1 benzothiophene, benzofuran, 2 -methylbenzofuran, 2, 3 -dimethylbenzofuran, quinoline, 6 methylquinoline, carbazole, dibenzothiophene, dibenzofuran, acridine, and xanthene) out of twelve showed significant estrogenic activity in the ER CALUX®. With the help of liquid chromatography with diode array detection (LC-DAD) and high resolution tandem mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS 2), it could be demonstrated that the used T 47 Dluc cell line was capable for metabolizing of the parent substances. To assess the endocrine disrupting potential of the biological larvicide VectoBac®, which is extracted out of Bacillus thuringienses var. israelensis (Bti), the whole bioassay battery was used. With both receptor-mediated assays LYES and ER CALUX® the previously detected estrogenic activity of three commercial available tablet formulas could be confirmed. From the subsequently investigated active substance VectoBac® TP as well as the formula WDG only TP showed dose-dependent estrogenic activity in both assays. Neither for TP nor WDG clear influences on the steroidogenesis could be detected in the H 295 R. The investigation of surface and groundwater samples which were taken after the application of both TP and WDG also showed no estrogenic activity in the receptor-mediated bioassays. To elucidate the potential effect of the suspected xenoestrogen VectoBac® TP on a complex aquatic community a microcosm study was performed. Within this microcosm, the impact on phytoplankton and zooplankton as well as the grazer P. antipodarum could be studied. While no effects on the zooplankton were detected, a clear shift from green to blue algae could be detected at concentrations which also showed significant estrogenic activity in the LYES. No clear effects on the reproduction of P. antipodarum could be observed, but it is assumed that this was a result of the limited food supply due to the community shift within the phytoplankton. Nevertheless, the concentrations used in the microcosm study were ten to 50 times higher than it would be expected in the field and therefore, a shift in the ecosystem structure of routinely treated areas seems unlikely. In the last approach the three selected in vitro bioassays were used to assess the performance of advanced sewage treatment processes with regard to the removal of pharmaceuticals from hospital sewage before discharge into the public sewerage. The high estrogenic activity of the raw sewage sample detected in the LYES could be significantly reduced by a full scale membrane bioreactor (MBR). After subsequent ozonation the estrogenicity was reduced to the level of the solvent controls in both receptor-mediated assays. By means of liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS 2) it could be verified that after ozonation concentrations of estrone (E 1) were significantly reduced. In contrast, there was a significant increase of 17 ß-estradiol production as well as aromatase activity in H 295 R cells after ozonation. It is hypothesized that this is partly due to formation of active by-products during ozonation. Overall, the selected in vitro bioassays were suitable for the detection of endocrine activity in various sample matrices as well as single substances. The receptor-mediated bioassay ER CALUX® was able to detect estrogenic activity in all matrices used. These included groundwater, surface water and sewage as well as single substances (hetero-PAHs). Additionally, in case of the hetero-PAHs, the estrogenic activity of single substances which require metabolic activation could be detected. With the LYES investigation of medium to highly contaminated water samples was possible, low contaminated water samples could not be investigated due to the high limit of detection (LOD) as well as the relatively high estrogenicity of the solvent controls. The H 295 R was applicable for medium contaminated samples as well as single substances. Performance of the bioassays markedly varied throughout the present study. The ER CALUX® provided the most stable performance (very good), followed by the H 295 R (good), the LYES (good to moderate) and P. antipodarum (moderate). Problems occurred with the consistent production of testosterone (H 295 R), the background of the solvent controls (LYES) as well as food supply and response to the positive control (P. antipodarum). Concluding, it can be stated that the selected bioassay battery is suitable to detect (potential) endocrine disrupting substances in different water sample matrices such as groundwater, surface water and wastewater.
