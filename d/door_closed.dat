At approximately 8:00pm, a warning light flashed in the cockpit, indicating that the aft airstair apparatus had been activated.

According to Pfarrer, neither helicopter crashed {{at the beginning of}} the raid. Instead, the SEALs jumped onto the roof from the hovering Razor 1 helicopter and entered a third-floor hallway from the roof terrace. Osama's third wife, Khairah, was in the hallway, headed towards the SEALs. She was blinded by a strobe light and pushed to the floor as the SEALs went past her. Osama bin Laden stuck his head out of a bedroom door, saw the SEALs, and slammed the <b>door</b> <b>closed.</b> At the same time, Osama's son Khalid bin Laden ran up the stairs to the third floor and was killed with two shots.|$|E
50|$|The {{operation}} of the door open button is transparent, immediately opening and holding the door, typically until a timeout occurs and the <b>door</b> <b>closes.</b> The {{operation of}} the <b>door</b> <b>close</b> button is less transparent, and it often appears to do nothing, leading to frequent but incorrect reports that the <b>door</b> <b>close</b> button is a placebo button: either not wired up at all, or inactive in normal service. Working door open and <b>door</b> <b>close</b> buttons are required by code in many jurisdictions, including the United States, specifically for emergency operation: in independent mode, {{the door open and}} <b>door</b> <b>close</b> buttons are used to manually open or <b>close</b> the <b>door.</b> Beyond this, programming varies significantly, with some <b>door</b> <b>close</b> buttons immediately <b>closing</b> the <b>door,</b> but in other cases being delayed by an overall timeout, so the <b>door</b> cannot be <b>closed</b> until a few seconds after opening. In this case (hastening normal closure), the <b>door</b> <b>close</b> button has no effect. However, the <b>door</b> <b>close</b> button will cause a hall call to be ignored (so the door won't reopen), and once the timeout has expired, the <b>door</b> <b>close</b> will immediately <b>close</b> the <b>door,</b> for example to cancel a door open push. The minimum timeout for automatic <b>door</b> <b>closing</b> in the US is 5 seconds, which is a noticeable delay if not overridden.|$|R

5|$|The {{music video}} is {{inspired}} by horror films and extensively features gothic and horror related imagery, including references to Michael Jackson's Thriller. The video features references to horror cult films such as American Psycho and Saw {{as well as the}} supposedly haunted painting The Hands Resist Him. The Hand Resists Him is a painting created by artist Bill Stoneham in 1972, depicting a young boy and female doll {{standing in front of a}} glass paneled door against which many hands are pressed. The painting became famous for apparently being haunted. The painting is referenced during a scene in the video where West attempts to hold a <b>door</b> <b>closed,</b> from the monsters outside attempting to enter. The video features mostly naked corpse looking models, some of which are decapitated. West's role in the video is similar to Doctor Frankenstein, with the video set in a castle. Jay-Z appears in the video dressed in a tuxedo, standing in front of a nude corpse in a darkly-lit library. The video contains two versions of Minaj; a vampire version who is dressed in a gothic inspired outfit (representing her alter ego Roman Zolanski), and a pink-haired version (representing her alter ego Barbie) which the other half tortures during the video. Zombies also appear in the video, with hanging corpses and blood-splattered furniture.|$|E

25|$|The {{house had}} a major roof leak that forced {{an end to the}} house tours in 1998. An {{architectural}} assessment was performed on the house and the cost to reconstruct the house was estimated between $116,020 and $126,220. Before the roof was repaired, there was a broken pipe in the dining room. The break happened in January 1999. It dumped 500,000 gallons of water through the first floor and into the basement. The rising basement waters extinguished the furnace, causing the water in the pipes and the radiators to freeze, then burst. City water meters knew there was a problem somewhere in the city, but no one could find the source of the leak. A volunteer at the house discovered the leak. The volunteer arranged for a heating repairman to stop the flooding. When the repairman left, he slammed the <b>door</b> <b>closed.</b> The door frame was so swollen that the volunteer was stuck inside. She had to go upstairs and call for help through a front window.|$|E

But as Eliza progresses through the district bee and prepares for the national bee, the troubled lives of her family come into sharp focus. Saul, who has tried to reach God, first through drugs and then through study, becomes convinced that Eliza's talent shows a propensity for mysticism greater than his, which has the potential to lead her to shefa, the influx of the Divine. He gradually introduces her to the writings of Abraham Abulafia, a Medieval kabbalist writer, and it becomes clear that his ambitions for her go far beyond the winning of the spelling bee.|$|E

40|$|<b>Door</b> <b>closing</b> {{sound is}} one of the most {{influential}} parameters to the customer while buying a car. It {{is one of}} the first impressions one can get while interacting with the vehicle and this contributes to the overall quality perception. Thus, it is very interesting for automotive developers to understand the influence of several parameters on the <b>door</b> <b>closing</b> sound quality. Various experimental and simulation research has already been performed in this field. This thesis is focusing on the experimental part, where classical methodologies, such as standard vibration and acoustical measurements were applied. However, alternative methods, like the acoustic camera, have hardly ever been used. The acoustic camera is typically implemented to measure stationary sound sources. On the other hand, the <b>door</b> <b>closing</b> sound is a transient phenomenon. In this thesis, both, the classical and the acoustic camera approach were used to develop a methodology to quantify the <b>door</b> <b>closing</b> sound quality. The measurements with the acoustic camera identified various sound sources, distributed over the complete door. The main hot-spots are localized at the striker and around the junction of the upper rail and the B-pillar. The other sources are less contributing to the overall <b>door</b> <b>closing</b> sound. These results have been used to choose adequate measurement positions for accelerometers and were ultimately verified by the classical approach. Based on that, the influence of variations of the door seal stiffness and the inclination of the car were investigated. The main outcome of this was that the <b>door</b> <b>closing</b> sound can be damped or amplified within certain frequency ranges by changing these parameters...|$|R

500|$|Due to {{the tension}} between them, James leaves {{to go for a}} drive and {{purchase}} a pack of cigarettes for Kristen; before he departs, he starts a fire in the hearth. Shortly after he leaves, Kristen realizes the chimney flue is closed, and attempts to open it; while she does this, smoke emanating from the fire triggers a smoke alarm. Kristen attempts to disarm the smoke alarm when she is startled by another knock at the door; she drops the alarm on the floor and retreats to the bedroom, unnerved. She calls James' cellphone from the landline, but their call is cut short. When she returns to the living room, she sees the smoke alarm now sitting on a chair, and realizes someone else has been in the house.
