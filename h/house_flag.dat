5|$|As {{she was not}} a Royal Naval vessel the Admiralty {{would not}} allow Discovery to fly the White Ensign. She {{eventually}} sailed under the Merchant Shipping Act, flying the RGS <b>house</b> <b>flag</b> and the Blue Ensign and burgee of the Royal Harwich Yacht Club.|$|E
5|$|The St George's Cross defaced {{with the}} arms of Dunkirk flown from the jack staff is the {{warranted}} <b>house</b> <b>flag</b> of the Association of Dunkirk Little Ships.

5|$|El Sol {{settled on}} the bottom at a 45° angle with only the tops of her masts {{protruding}} above the surface; the Morgan Line house flag—a blue <b>house</b> <b>flag</b> with a red M inside a white star—still fluttered in the breeze. Even though the sunken vessel was not considered a hazard to navigation, in another fog two days later a Staten Island Ferryboat nearly hit El Sols wreck.|$|E

25|$|Robert G. Cook, Head Master from 2000–10, {{introduced}} a new <b>house</b> <b>flag</b> system. At {{the beginning of each}} month, a flag on the turrets of Victoria College is changed according to the successes of houses at certain events. The flag bears the colour of the house.|$|E
25|$|The group {{announced}} in November 1998 that the HSBC brand and the hexagon symbol would be adopted as the unified brand {{in all the}} markets where HSBC operates, {{with the aim of}} enhancing recognition of the group and its values by customers, shareholders and staff throughout the world. The hexagon symbol was originally adopted by the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation as its logo in 1983. It was developed from the bank's <b>house</b> <b>flag,</b> a white rectangle divided diagonally to produce a red hourglass shape. Like many other Hong Kong company flags that originated in the 19th century, and because of its founder's nationality, the design was based on the cross of Saint Andrew. The logo was designed by Austrian graphic artist Henry Steiner.|$|E
2500|$|Thereafter {{the hull}} was {{returned}} to its original white colour with the flag {{on the side of}} the funnel becoming a stylized fluttering company <b>house</b> <b>flag</b> without the red lettering. Following customer feedback and comments about the change of colour, the colour scheme {{was returned to}} the original white and buff, but with the addition of the fluttering <b>house</b> <b>flag,</b> complete with the red lettering. For much of the first decade of the 21st century, Scillonian III remained in this appearance.|$|E
50|$|As of 2008 {{new house}} banners were {{introduced}} to the school. These were chosen from a banner making competition and replaced the old <b>house</b> <b>flags.</b> Along with the new banners every student was given badges for their house with the image of their house's banner.|$|R

2500|$|The {{priority}} of hoisting locations {{depends on the}} rig of the vessel. With sloops, ketches and schooners the starboard yardarm or spreader of the highest or main mast {{is the second most}} honoured position. (That is, after the ensign at the stern.) [...] Next after the starboard spreader is the port spreader. House flags (those defining the owner) are usually flown from the mainmast truck. When a club burgee is flown, it will normally be hoisted to the truck of the most forward mast. On a sloop, then, not having a foremast, the <b>house</b> <b>flag</b> could be moved to the port spreader if the starboard spreader was in use, and a burgee was being flown. On a ketch, the <b>house</b> <b>flag</b> would be moved to the mizzen.|$|E
2500|$|A {{courtesy}} flag (or courtesy ensign) is flown by a visiting ship in foreign waters as {{a token of}} respect. It is often a small (that is, smaller than the ship's own national ensign) national maritime flag of the host country, although there are countries (such as Malta) where the national, rather than the maritime flag is correct. [...] The flag is customarily worn at the foremasthead of multi-masted vessels, the dockside yardarm or crosstree of the mast of single-masted vessels, while the <b>house</b> <b>flag</b> would be outboard. [...] It may be flown from the jackstaff of vessels without masts.|$|E
2500|$|In 1977 Scillonian III {{went into}} service with her hull and {{superstructure}} painted white, her crane, funnel davits and masts were buff (yellow) without further markings. Some time after Gry Maritha was acquired, Scillonian IIIs funnel and crane were painted blue to closer match the colours {{of the other}} ship, despite the Gry Maritha being a lighter colour blue with a white superstructure. For two seasons after the change of schedule post 1990, {{the lower half of}} her hull was painted dark blue with the upper half and superstructure, remaining white. The funnel was painted blue and white striped with a [...] <b>house</b> <b>flag,</b> painted on the sides in the white stripe. The crane, davits and masts were painted blue.|$|E

50|$|Despite this, all Cunard Line ships flew {{both the}} Cunard and White Star Line <b>house</b> <b>flags</b> on their masts until late 1968. This {{was most likely}} because Nomadic {{remained}} in service with Cunard until November 4, 1968, and {{was sent to the}} breakers' yard, only to be bought for use as a floating restaurant. After this, all remnants of the company were dissolved.|$|R
2500|$|Over {{the course}} of some 44 years, the Southard {{shipyard}} built between 75 and 100 wooden-hulled sailing ships of all kinds, large and small, including schooners, barks, brigs and full-rigged ships, his vessels having [...] "an industry-wide reputation for reliability of workmanship and trimness of line." [...] T. J. Southard owned shares {{in many of the}} ships he built, and was the first local shipbuilder to own 100% of a ship (the ship's captain in this era usually being obliged to own at least one-sixteenth of his command). By these means, Southard became not only a shipbuilder but the head of his own merchant fleet, his ships flying the Southard <b>house</b> <b>flag</b> with a design incorporating an anvila pictorial reference to the proprietor's smithing origins.|$|E

The historical traditions of the university {{are reflected in the}} coat of arms, its academic regalia and its <b>house</b> <b>flag.</b> The BA hood is of solid red, a colour that recalls the early affiliation with McGill, as do the martlets in the coat of arms. The BSc hood, of gold, and the BEd hood, of blue, show the colours of the University of British Columbia. Blue and gold have been retained as the official colours of the University of Victoria. The motto {{at the top of the}} Arms of the University, in Hebrew characters, is [...] "Let there be Light"; the motto at the bottom, in Latin, is [...] "A Multitude of the Wise is the Health of the World." ...|$|E
