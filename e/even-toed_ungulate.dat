5|$|The giraffe (Giraffa) is a genus of African <b>even-toed</b> <b>ungulate</b> mammals, {{the tallest}} living {{terrestrial}} {{animals and the}} largest ruminants. The genus currently consists of one species, Giraffa camelopardalis, the type species. Seven other species are extinct, prehistoric species known from fossils. Taxonomic classifications of one to eight extant giraffe species have been described, based upon research into the mitochondrial and nuclear DNA, as well as morphological measurements of Giraffa, but the IUCN currently recognizes only one species with nine subspecies.|$|E
25|$|A pig is any of {{the animals}} in the genus Sus, within the <b>even-toed</b> <b>ungulate</b> family Suidae. Pigs include the {{domestic}} pig and its ancestor, the common Eurasian wild boar (Sus scrofa), along with other species; related creatures outside the genus include the peccary, the babirusa, and the warthog. Pigs, like all suids, are native to the Eurasian and African continents. Juvenile pigs are known as piglets. Pigs are highly social and intelligent animals.|$|E

50|$|The {{anatomy of}} the Suina differs from other <b>even-toed</b> <b>ungulates.</b> For example, they have maxillary (upper) teeth in front, which allows for the proper chewing of food. In contrast, other <b>even-toed</b> <b>ungulates,</b> such as goats and deer, have front teeth only on the bottom; this does not let them chew very well, thus they swallow and regurgitate their food to allow rumination.|$|R
