40|$|Peritoneal exudate {{cells were}} induced in mice 4 days after {{immunization}} with SRBC. A low dose of SRBC (10 (6) i. v.) caused T lymphocytes {{to appear in}} <b>inflammatory</b> <b>exudates.</b> These cells, not only transferred DTH reactions, but also functioned as helper T cells in antibody production after transfer to syngeneic nu/nu recipient mice. After a high dose of SRBC (10 (9) i. v.), very few helper T cells and no DTH transferring T cells were found in <b>inflammatory</b> <b>exudates,</b> although they {{were present in the}} spleen. It is postulated that T cells mediating DTH reactions and helper T cells behave similarly as far as those dose dependency of appearance in <b>inflammatory</b> <b>exudates</b> is concerned. A high dose of sensitizing antigen causes retention of helper and effector T cells in the spleen, in this way favouring antibody formation; low doses of antigen allow them to leave the spleen, thus favouring mediation of DTH reactions in the periphery...|$|R
40|$|Although cyclo-oxygenase {{products}} {{have been detected}} at inflammatory sites the tissue of origin remains uncertain. <b>Inflammatory</b> <b>exudates</b> were collected from rats 4, 6, 8, 12 or 24 h after subcutaneous implantation of carrageenin-impregnated sponges. Concentrations of the cyclo-oxygenase products prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2), 6 -oxo-PGF 1 alpha and thromboxane B 2 (TXB 2) in <b>inflammatory</b> <b>exudates</b> and serum (obtained from blood clotted at 37 degrees C) were measured by specific radioimmunoassays. TXB 2 concentrations in exudates increased to about 100 ng ml- 1 at 8 h but decreased to less than 20 ng ml- 1 after 24 h. PGE 2 concentrations increased from 4 - 12 h and remained between 80 and 120 ng ml- 1 from 12 - 24 h. 6 -oxo-PGF 1 alpha had the same time course as that of PGE 2 but concentrations were approximately one third of PGE 2 values. TXB 2 concentrations in serum from thrombocytopaenic rats were less than 5 % of control values. Thrombocytopaenia did not affect TXB 2, PGE 2 or 6 -oxo-PGF 1 alpha concentrations or total leukocyte numbers in <b>inflammatory</b> <b>exudates.</b> Methotrexate-induced neutropaenia did not affect serum TXB 2 concentrations but cyclo-oxygenase products (including TXB 2) in 6 h <b>inflammatory</b> <b>exudates</b> were reduced by 60 - 95 %. Colchicine (1. 0 mg kg- 1 s. c.) prevented leukocyte accumulation in sponge exudates and this {{was accompanied by a}} reduction in TXB 2, PGE 2 and 6 -oxo-PGF 1 alpha concentrations at 6 h. These results indicate that platelets are the source of TXB 2 in clotting blood but do not contribute to cyclo-oxygenase activity in experimental inflammation. The results also suggest that migrating leukocytes are the major source of thromboxane and to a lesser degree prostaglandins in acute 6 h <b>inflammatory</b> <b>exudates...</b>|$|R

40|$|Among the nonsteroid {{antiinflammatory}} drugs {{there is}} generally a close {{correlation between the}} potency of their inhibition of arachidonate cyclooxygenase, and thus prostaglandin production, and their antiinflammatory activity. One anomaly in this generalization is that whereas aspirin and salicylate are equipotent as antiinflammatory agents, salicylate is less active than aspirin in inhibiting prostaglandin production in vitro. Using rats, we have now measured the concentrations of aspirin and salicylate in plasma and in <b>inflammatory</b> <b>exudates</b> after their oral administration and determined their effects on thromboxane B 2 production in clotting blood and prostaglandin (PG) E 2 concentrations in the exudates. We have also investigated the effects of both drugs, at concentrations achieved in the exudates, on PGE 2 production by nonproliferative explants of acutely inflamed tissues. Aspirin is rapidly metabolized, resulting in peak concentrations of salicylate in the plasma and exudate that exceeded peak concentrations of aspirin by 30 - to 50 -fold. Furthermore, concentrations of aspirin rapidly declined, whereas high concentrations of salicylate persisted in the plasma and in the exudate for up to 6 hr after a single administration of aspirin. Both drugs reduced PGE 2 concentrations in <b>inflammatory</b> <b>exudates</b> by 50 - 70 %, but aspirin was considerably more potent than salicylate in inhibiting thromboxane B 2 production in clotting blood. The concentration of salicylate found in <b>inflammatory</b> <b>exudates</b> 6 hr after the administration of aspirin was sufficient to reduce PGE 2 production in explants by more than 50 %. We conclude that the antiinflammatory action of both drugs depends on the inhibition of PGE 2 synthesis by salicylate...|$|R
40|$|This work is {{to study}} the {{anti-inflammatory}} effect and its mechanisms of sophoridine in vitro and in vivo. For this aim, the influences of sophoridine on several inflammatory mediators were investigated. Excessive inflammatory response in vitro model was developed by using lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to stimulate the mouse peritoneal macrophages and HL- 60 cells to produce IL- 6 and IL- 8. Carrageenin-induced mouse paw edema model was used as inflammatory response in vivo model.

50|$|Inflammation, such as {{that caused}} by sepsis, causes endothelial dysfunction, fluid leakage from the {{capillaries}} and impaired drainage of fluid from the lungs. Elevated inspired oxygen concentration often becomes necessary at this stage, and may facilitate a 'respiratory burst' in immune cells. In a secondary phase, endothelial dysfunction causes cells and <b>inflammatory</b> <b>exudate</b> to enter the alveoli. This pulmonary edema increases {{the thickness of the}} alveolocapillary space, increasing the distance the oxygen must diffuse to reach the blood, which impairs gas exchange leading to hypoxia, increases the work of breathing and eventually induces fibrosis of the airspace.|$|E

40|$|Because {{inflammation}} is appreciated as {{a unifying}} basis of many widely occurring diseases, the mechanisms involved {{in its natural}} resolution are of considerable interest. Using contained, self-limited <b>inflammatory</b> <b>exudates</b> and a systems approach, novel lipid-derived mediators and pathways were uncovered in the resolution of <b>inflammatory</b> <b>exudates.</b> These new families of local mediators control both the duration and magnitude of acute inflammation {{as well as the}} return of the site to homeostasis in the process of catabasis. This new genus of specialized proresolving mediators (SPM) includes essential fatty acidâ€“derived lipoxins, resolvins, protectins, and, most recently, maresins. These families were named based on their unique structures and potent stereoselective actions. The temporally initiated biosynthesis of SPM and their direct impact on leukocyte trafficking and macrophage-directed clearance mechanisms provide clear evidence that resolution is an active, programmed response at the tissue level. Moreover, SPM that possess anti-inflammatory (ie, limiting PMN infiltration) and proresolving (enhance macrophage uptake and clearance of apoptotic PMN and microbial particles) actions as well as stimulating mucosal antimicrobial responses demonstrate that anti-inflammation and proresolution are different responses of the host and novel defining properties of these molecules. The mapping of new resolution circuits has opened the possibility for understanding mechanisms that lead from acute to chronic inflammation, or to the resolution thereof, as well as to potential, resolution-based immunopharmacological therapies...|$|R

50|$|The diagram Mite {{infestation}} {{sites on}} skin shows where typical infestations of different taxonomic groups mites on livestock animals occur on {{or in the}} host's skin. The position of these mites {{in relation to the}} skin or other organs is crucial for their feeding and also for their veterinary diagnosis and options for treatment. The mites either feed on the tissues of the skin using penetrating mouthparts or on the <b>inflammatory</b> <b>exudate</b> that results from the action of the mouthparts and saliva of the mites on the skin. Demodectic mites have mouthparts adapted to penetrate and suck out the contents of individual cells of hair follicles. It is usual for all active stages of the mite lifecycle to feed as parasites, but the trombiculid mites are an exception. Most of the parasitic mites do not feed directly on blood, but the dermanyssid mites and larval trombiculid mites directly suck up capillary blood as their exclusive food. The tube through which food is ingested and saliva excreted during feeding is formed in most mites by apposing the sheath that contains the chelicerae against the hypostome. However, the trombiculids are an exception. Some species of mites (Analgidae) have adapted to feeding on keratin and skin debris amongst the feathers of birds, and other species have adapted to feed directly on internal tissues such as air-sacs or lungs (Cytoditidae and Laminosioptidae).|$|E
