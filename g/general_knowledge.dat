5|$|Fishers {{have been}} {{captured}} live for fur farming, zoo specimens, and scientific research. From 1920–1946, pelt prices averaged about $137 CAN. Since pelts were relatively valuable, {{attempts were made}} to raise fishers on farms. Fur farming was popular with other species such as mink and ermine, so it was thought that the same techniques could be applied to fishers. However, farmers found it difficult to raise fishers due to their unusual reproductive cycle. In <b>general,</b> <b>knowledge</b> of delayed implantation in fishers was unknown at the time. Farmers noted that females mated in the spring but did not give birth. Due to declining pelt prices, most fisher farms closed operations by the late 1940s.|$|E
5|$|Geographers in the Roman Empire such as Ptolemy {{provided}} a rough {{sketch of the}} eastern Indian Ocean, including the Malay Peninsula and beyond this the Gulf of Thailand and South China Sea. Ptolemy's Cattigara was most likely Óc Eo, Vietnam, where Antonine-era Roman items have been found. Ancient Chinese geographers demonstrated a <b>general</b> <b>knowledge</b> of West Asia and Rome's eastern provinces. The 7th-century AD Byzantine historian Theophylact Simocatta wrote of the contemporary reunification of northern and southern China, which he treated as separate nations recently at war. This mirrors both the conquest of Chen by Emperor Wen of Sui (reigned 581–604 AD) {{as well as the}} names Cathay and Mangi used by later medieval Europeans in China during the Mongol-led Yuan dynasty and Han-Chinese Southern Song dynasty.|$|E
5|$|In a {{range of}} studies, {{participants}} have been requested to answer <b>general</b> <b>knowledge</b> questions, each of which had two possible answers, and also to estimate their chances of answering each question correctly. If the participants had a sufficient degree of self-knowledge, their level of confidence in regard to each answer they gave would be high for the questions they answered correctly and lower for the ones they answered wrong. However, this generally is not the case. Many people are overconfident; indeed, studies show that most people systematically overestimate their own abilities. Moreover, people are overconfident {{about their ability to}} answer questions that are deemed to be hard but underconfident on questions that are considered easy.|$|E

40|$|AbstractGlobal {{warming and}} climate change have become {{emerging}} issues for marketing to promote ecologically conscious consumer behavior. Past studies investigated the role of <b>general</b> environmental <b>knowledge</b> in attitude-behavior relationship of pro-environmental consumer behavior. Using the Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA) as a guiding framework, this study takes {{a fresh look at}} attitude-behavior relationship that integrates both <b>general</b> environmental <b>knowledge</b> and knowledge of eco-labels in the model to investigate their role in predicting ecologically conscious consumer behavior. The study finds that both <b>general</b> environmental <b>knowledge</b> and eco-label knowledge positively influence consumer attitudes towards environment in driving ecologically conscious consumer behavior. The findings suggest that marketing strategy, specifically communication strategy, needs to focus on educating consumers about issue-specific environmental knowledge (e. g., eco-label <b>knowledge)</b> along with <b>general</b> environmental <b>knowledge.</b> Further research should integrate more issue-specific dimensions to investigate pro-environmental consumer behavior...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Knowledge-intensive CBR {{assumes that}} cases are enriched with <b>general</b> domain <b>knowledge.</b> In the system Creek, {{developed}} in our group, {{there is a}} strong coupling between cases and <b>general</b> domain <b>knowledge,</b> in that cases are embedded within a semantic network of domain concepts and relations. Although mostly used for decision support, this architecture is also being explored for the purpose of interactive learning support. The theme of the talk is twofold: Integration of cases and <b>general</b> domain <b>knowledge</b> within the knowledge-intensive CBR system Creek, and a discussion of different ways this framework can be used to build intelligent computer-assisted learning systems. ...|$|R
5|$|Integrated {{education}} {{models are}} {{emerging in the}} academic world, a model which {{is referred to as}} T-shape and π-shaped education. T-shaped professionals are taught <b>general</b> <b>knowledge</b> in a few disciplines (e.g. management and engineering) and specific, deep knowledge in a single domain (e.g. design). This model also applies to companies, when they shift their focus from small T innovations (innovations involving only one discipline, like chemists) to big T innovations (innovations involving several disciplines, like design, ethnography, lead user, etc.). Like in education, this shift makes breaking down silos of departments and disciplines of knowledge essential.|$|E
5|$|Jeopardy! is an American {{television}} {{game show}} created by Merv Griffin. The show features a quiz competition in which contestants {{are presented with}} <b>general</b> <b>knowledge</b> clues {{in the form of}} answers, and must phrase their responses in the form of questions. The original daytime version debuted on NBC on March 30, 1964, and aired until January 3, 1975. A weekly nighttime syndicated edition aired from September 1974 to September 1975, and a revival, The All-New Jeopardy!, ran on NBC from October 1978 to March 1979. The current version, a daily syndicated show produced by Sony Pictures Television, premiered on September 10, 1984, and is still airing.|$|E
5|$|Past {{experiences}} or <b>general</b> <b>knowledge</b> {{is often}} called upon in conversation, {{so it is a}} useful context for children to learn words. Recalling past experiences allows the child to call upon their own visual, tactical, oral, and/or auditory references. For example, if a child once went to a zoo and saw an elephant, but did not know the word elephant, an adult could later help the child recall this event, describing the size and color of the animal, how big its ears were, its trunk, and the sound it made, then using the word elephant to refer to the animal. Calling upon prior knowledge is used not only in conversation, but often in book reading as well to help explain what is happening in a story by relating it back to the child's own experiences.|$|E

5|$|Similarly {{to other}} Brazilian public universities, admissions to {{undergraduate}} programs are through a comprehensive general examination, called vestibular. While other Brazilian public universities, specially federally managed ones, which use the National High School Exam (ENEM, in Portuguese Exame Nacional do Ensino Médio) as an entrance exam, Unicamp {{has its own}} national entrance exam applied yearly by its Vestibular Commission (COMVEST, in Portuguese Comissão Permanente para os Vestibulares) in two rounds. Generally, the first round happens in November and is a test composed of 90 multiple-choice <b>general</b> <b>knowledge</b> questions. Students applying to programs that require specific skills (such as music, architecture, dance, and others) must take a specific knowledge test even before the first phase.|$|E
5|$|Had Flight 19 {{actually}} been where Taylor believed it to be, the flight {{would have made}} landfall with the Florida coastline within 20 minutes, depending on how far down they were. However, a later reconstruction of the incident showed that the islands visible to Taylor were probably the Bahamas, well northeast of the Keys, and that Flight 19 was exactly where it should have been. The board of investigation found that because of his belief {{that he was on}} a base course toward Florida, Taylor actually guided the flight farther northeast and out to sea. Further, it was <b>general</b> <b>knowledge</b> at NAS Fort Lauderdale that if a pilot ever became lost in the area to fly a heading of 270° west (or in evening hours toward the sunset if the compass had failed). By the time the flight actually turned west, they were likely so far out to sea they had already passed their aircraft's fuel endurance. This factor combined with bad weather, and the ditching characteristics of the Avenger, meant that there was little hope of rescue, even if they had managed to stay afloat.|$|E

40|$|Autobiographical {{knowledge}} is stored hierarchically, at both specific and general levels of representation. It {{has also been}} proposed that the self is the structure around which autobiographical memories are organised. The current series of studies assessed whether the autobiographical memory difficulties observed in adults with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) {{could be due to}} problems in using the self as an effective memory cue. A series of cueing paradigms were used to assess the accessibility of both specific and <b>general</b> autobiographical <b>knowledge</b> relating to (i) currently pursued goals (either high or low in self-concordance) and (ii) goals that participants were not currently pursuing. Results demonstrated that while event-specific knowledge was impaired in the ASD group, <b>general</b> event <b>knowledge</b> appeared relatively intact. Moreover, while both event-specific and <b>general</b> event <b>knowledge</b> were organised around goals of the self in control participants, a corresponding relationship was only observed for <b>general</b> event <b>knowledge</b> in the ASD group...|$|R
