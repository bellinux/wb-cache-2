50|$|CSN {{primarily}} {{operates as}} an integrated steel producer in Brazil. It produces {{a line of}} steel products, including slabs, which are semi-finished products used for processing hot-rolled, cold-rolled, or coated coils and sheet products; hot-rolled products comprising heavy-gauge <b>hot-rolled</b> <b>coils</b> and sheets, and light-gauge <b>hot-rolled</b> <b>coils</b> and sheets; cold-rolled products, including cold-rolled coils and sheets; and galvanized products consisting of flat-rolled steel coated with zinc or a zinc-based alloy. The company also offers tin mill products, including tin plate, tin free steel, low tin coated steel, and black plate products. CSN also mines iron ore, limestone, and dolomite, and maintains strategic investments in railroads and power supply companies. The company sells its steel products to customers in Brazil and 71 other countries in North America, Europe, and Asia through its sales force and distributors. It {{is considered one of}} the most productive steel-makers in the world, producing more than 6 million tons of raw steel and more than 5 million tons of laminates per year.|$|R
50|$|In 2003, Lisco {{exported}} 373 kn of {{finished products}} (48.5% of production). 881 kn of various products were exported in 2004, including 477 kn of HBI (54% of exports) and 72 kn of rebar. It {{is considered the}} only Arab company manufacturing this material. Flat products were 59% of exports in 2004. Europe received about 64.4% followed by Asian and Arab countries. Higher domestic demand for rebar resulted in exports declining to 20 kn in 2004. Exports {{in the first half}} of 2005 was approximately 384 kn; mostly HBI (54%) and flat products (31.7%). Exports fell for long products (81%), flat products (20%) and HBI (5%). This drop is due to the fact that the company stopped exporting rebar as well as a global recession, which led to a demand contraction for iron and steel products, particularly <b>hot-rolled</b> <b>coils</b> and HBI. Exports in 2006 exceeded one million tons, including 449 kn of flat products. During the first quarter of 2006 Lisco increased <b>hot-rolled</b> <b>coils</b> exports by 125% and exported sponge iron for the first time.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{recrystallization}} of hot-rolled aluminum strips was monitored inline after inline annealing at Commonwealth Aluminum Corporation (CAC) using laser-ultrasonics. The noncontact measurement {{is based}} on sensing {{the ratio of the}} compressional to the shear sound velocity in the strip thickness direction. This ratio is insensitive to strip thickness variations and varies with crystallographic texture and temperature. Therefore, recrystallization is sensed as a change of texture, from a rolling to an annealing texture. A pyrometer is used to decouple temperature and texture effects on the velocity ratio. The measurements were made on two alloys: AA 5754 and AA 5052. The capabilities and limitations of the sensor are discussed. Introduction: Aluminum sheets are often made by melting scrap aluminum, adjusting the chemistry, casting using a twin belt caster, hot rolling, cooling, batch annealing, and cold rolling. Clearly, letting the <b>hot-rolled</b> <b>coil</b> cool to subsequently anneal in a batch anneal furnace is less energy efficient than would be a new process involving hot rolling followed immediately by inline annealing. Moreover, energy savings and sheet quality would be optimal if the degree o...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (MBA) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2015. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: The 2008 / 2009 {{economic}} downturn {{had a major}} impact on the international steel industry. With economic activities declining, the demand for steel decreased and subsequently, prices started to tumble. This put a great deal of pressure on steel manufacturing companies’ financials and they had to focus on cost reduction initiatives to survive. Steel companies who did not follow a turnaround strategy were not able {{to keep up with the}} competition. This research study focused on determining the details pertaining to the ArcelorMittal Saldanha Works turnaround strategy, as it is viewed as one of the most successful in the steel industry. Data was obtained from discussions with various role players and managers at ArcelorMittal Saldanha Works. The aim of the interviews was to get the detail of all the steps taken by the company to turn around its performance. Quantitative data describing the operational as well as financial and cost performance was sourced from the ArcelorMittal Saldanha Works Key Performance Indicator (KPI) system and from financial statements and progress reports. It was found that the basis for the turnaround strategy of ArcelorMittal Saldanha Works was World Class Manufacturing as it provided the vehicles through which improvements were managed with the aid of mainly the Autonomous Maintenance (AM), Professional Maintenance(PM), People Development (PD), Focused Improvement (FI), Product Quality (PQ) and Safety Pillars. The Cost Deployment (CD) Pillar was used to identify the biggest losses that needed to be addressed. ArcelorMittal Saldanha Works moved from one of the highest-cost producers in the ArcelorMittal group during 2010 to the second-lowest-cost producer in the group at the end of 2013. It reduced its total cost of production with $ 70 per ton over this period, without any major capital expenditure. The study concluded that the turnaround of ArcelorMittal Saldanha Works was successful and it is sustainable. This can be seen from the increase in the overall equipment availability, amount of <b>hot-rolled</b> <b>coil</b> tons produced, as well as the EBITDA figures reported in the study...|$|E
40|$|This report compares {{estimated}} {{production costs}} from four energy-intensive industries (steel, cement, chemical and non-ferrous metals) in the European Union and some third countries. Production costs have been estimated following a bottom-up approach, i. e. using information at facility level from a representative number of facilities. Costs are broken down to key factors, such as material, labour and energy costs and exclude capital costs (depreciation and interest). Moreover, the energy costs are estimated considering {{the effect of}} the state of technologies and the fuel mix in each country. For the iron and steel industry the production costs of <b>hot-rolled</b> <b>coil</b> and wire rod are analysed as representative flat and long products, respectively. The production costs of these products have been estimated for both the integrated route (blast furnace-basic oxygen furnace) and the recycling route (electrical arc furnace). For the chemical industry, the products analysed are ammonia, methanol, ethylene and propylene; whereas for the non-ferrous metals the analysis is focused on primary aluminium production, copper cathodes and slabs of zinc. Most of the EU 28 production costs are ranked (when compared with certain competitor countries) between the 75 th percentile and the maximum production cost. These costs are highest in the EU relative to other countries or regions in the case of flat products from the recycling route, ammonia and methanol. For long products -from the recycling route-, flat products -from the integrated route-, ethylene, propylene -refinery grade- and copper anode the EU 28 production costs are between the median (the median separates the higher half of the costs from the lower half) and the 75 th percentile of all production costs estimated. In the case of cement, the EU 28 production cost is quite similar to the value of the median cost. There are also cases in which the EU 28 production costs were among the lowest costs, namely for copper cathode and zinc slabs. It is worth noting that the contribution of energy costs to production costs is the highest in the EU only for methanol and ammonia. For all other products and industries analysed (including methanol and ammonia), other components of the cost (raw materials, labour and others or feedstock) contribute more to final costs than energy (natural gas is considered as a feedstock for methanol and ammonia). It is also noteworthy that, in most industries and products, the behaviour of credits (by-products, home scrap, electricity production from waste gases or from combined heat and power) contributes to reduce production costs more in the EU than it does in other countries or regions.

50|$|In 2003, Lisco {{produced}} 835 kn of {{long and}} flat products (444kt long products; 391 kn of flat products), including 412 kn of rebar, 391 kn of <b>hot-rolled</b> <b>coils,</b> and 412 kn of HBI. Production of long and flat products grew 18% in 2004; mainly rebar (460kt); <b>hot-rolled</b> <b>coils</b> (429kt) and HBI (606kt). Lisco produced over 574 kn of finished {{products in the}} first half of 2005, increasing 65% over the first half of 2004. The company also increased liquid steel production 52%. Rebar was 57.3% of finished products, <b>hot-rolled</b> <b>coils</b> was 39.3%. Sponge iron production was 579.407 tons, 348.243 tons of HBI, 376.239 tons of billets and blooms and 281.832 tons of slabs. During the first nine months of 2005, Lisco reached its highest production ever; 1 million tons of liquid steel. This was confirmed by Secretary of the Popular Committee, Dr. Mohammad Abu Ojeila Al-Mabrouk at celebrations in September 2005 on the occasion of the passage of 15 years since the company’s mills began production, which concurs with the anniversary of the Al-Fatah Revolution in Libya. In 2005, Lisco achieved the highest rate of increase in steel production among Arab companies, which amounted to 34.8%. Its production increased by 65% in the period from January to June 2005 compared with the same period of 2004. Production of both long and flat products was 1.070 tons in 2006. Flat products achieved a new output record for the company of 564kt, 13% higher than 2005. Production of bars and rods was 26% lower than 2005. Long product sales were 642 kn in 2006, a sizeable increase from 634 kn in 2005, forcing the company to import 168 kn of long products, mostly from Ukraine.|$|R
