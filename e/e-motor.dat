50|$|An {{electric}} motor (<b>E-motor)</b> test stand (also {{referred to as}} bench) is a test stand for reproducible testing of {{electric motor}}s. In addition to the mechanical design, an electric motor test stand consists of accompanying measurement devices, sensors and application software. The bus systems used to control and monitor the test objects are {{also included in the}} test stand.There are a variety of different types of test stands, such as developmental test stands, endurance test stands, end-of-line (EoL) test stands, and hardware-in-the-loop (HiL) test stands.|$|E
50|$|Starting from 1996 the Dutch oil and {{gas company}} NAM {{installed}} {{over a period of}} 10 years 20 large <b>E-motor</b> driven (with variable speed drive) gas compressors of 23 MW fully equipped with active magnetic bearings on both the <b>E-motor</b> and the compressor. These compressors are used in the Groningen gas field to extract the remaining gas from this large gas field and to increase the field capacity. The motor-compressor design was done by Siemens and the active magnetic bearings were delivered by Waukesha Bearings (owned by Dover Corporation). (Originally these bearings were designed by Glacier, this company was later taken over by Federal Mogul and is now part of Waukesha Bearings.) By using active magnetic bearings and a direct drive between motor and compressor (without the gearbox in between) and applying dry gas seals, a full dry-dry (oil free) system has been installed. Applying active magnetic bearings in the driver and in the compressor (compared to the traditional configuration with a gearbox, plain bearings and a gasturbine-driver) results in a relatively simple system with a very wide operating range and high efficiencies (particularly at partial load). As done in the Groningen field, the full installation can additionally be placed outdoors without the need for a large compressor building.|$|E

40|$|We {{have created}} an {{accelerated}} corrosion environment for sintered Nd–Fe–B magnets in <b>e-motor</b> applications. <b>E-motor</b> working conditions are complex, and standard magnet corrosion tests only cover a small subset of possible parameters (e. g., samples are usually tested in the demagnetized state). In this work magnetized and demagnetized sintered Nd–Fe–B magnets were placed in gearbox oil, and exposed to temperature cycles (θmax[*]=[*] 130 [*]°C) using an autoclave. Beforehand the magnets were pre-immersed in saturated water-based salt solution to account for water and de-icing salt that might interfuse gearbox oil over time. The corrosive behavior was studied for two commercial magnet grades, “high grade” (8. 9 [*]wt% dysprosium) and “low grade” (3. 1 [*]wt% dysprosium); and monitored by weight loss, structural analysis (scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray) as well as magnetic characterization. The magnetized samples corroded significantly faster than their demagnetized counterparts. Strong differences in the corrosion rates of the “low grade” and “high grade” material are discussed. We concluded that the magnetization state is one key parameter {{that needs to be}} considered in corrosion tests for <b>e-motor</b> applications...|$|E

The paper argues that {{in the absence of}} credible data on the likelihood and payload of cyber attacks on newly developed devices a sensible approach would be to separate the concerns: (i) the payloads that may affect the device’s safety can be identified using standard hazard analysis techniques; (ii) the difficulty with the parameterization of a stochastic model can be alleviated by applying sensitivity analysis for a plausible range of model parameter values...|$|E
40|$|The {{weight of}} a {{catamaran}} boat floats on two hulls. This allows each hull to be slimmer and shallower in cross-section than the single hull of an equivalent mono-hull, so it has less weight, small draught, less water resistance, much more deck area for passengers or marine activities, stable and less power usage. Especially, if it powered by hybrid energy (diesel and solar), then it could be more economical because of relentless rise in oil prices in the world. The increasing of fossil’s fuel oil prices urges people to try to complement {{a part of it}} with alternative energy such as solar energy using photovoltaic (PV) cells which could power the electric motors (<b>E-motor)</b> as the prime mover of the boat. Powering boats by hybrid energy in tropical countries like Indonesia where solar energy is freely available on average for six to eight hours a day could reduce operational cost {{and at the same time}} reduce the carbon emission. In addition, the low noise generated by the <b>E-motor</b> is more suited to passengers and less likely to frighten fishes during the catching operation. The major drawback of this technology is that it needs more investment because of high cost of PV system, but it could be beneficial over a long period. In term of operation the boat can be powered by solar energy directly and during night time the power can be supplemented from batteries charged during the day by solar energy. The hybrid technology using for powering catamaran boats would be future potential especially for daily inter-island sea activities...|$|E
40|$|During the {{start-up}} {{and shut down}} phase of reciprocating compressors the loads on all components of driven train system are very high. In this paper a method for the calculating the forces on coupling, <b>e-motor,</b> crank shaft as well other components of the system will be described. The modelling of the electrical induction motor, coupling, crank shaft, damper {{as well as the}} compressor resistance torque are extremely important in simulating start-up and shut down of reciprocating compressor. Equally important, are the switching torque of the electrical motor and the instantaneous moment of inertia of the reciprocating compressor crank gear. The transient start-up and shut down process under loaded and unloaded is described using a non-linear differential equation for driven train system: EMotor – Coupling – Flywheel – Reciprocating compressor - Damper. Shaft torsional moments on the drive train and especially on the coupling, whether elastic or stiff, can then only be calculated using numerical simulation...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAll {{segments}} of stakeholders in society {{need to understand}} economic, environmental and social connections and implications {{in order to facilitate}} sustainable development. Currently many people - especially in emerging countries - are not aware of the challenges associated with sustainability. In addition new technology has to be developed to find solutions for providing growth without exceeding the resource boundaries of our planet. This demands a drastically increased learning and teaching productivity and thus new approaches for education. Exemplarily for engineering education, the authors present a concept in which simulation-games are applied in order to support training for assembly processes on manual workplaces. The Assembly Game and the Gaming System are introduced. The first game is played on portable devices. Learners acquire knowledge of the assembly sequence of a bicycle <b>e-motor.</b> The second game is played on a manual assembly workplace. It encourages practice based learning by combining gaming software with a manual assembly workplace. Both games are implemented in education oriented software with strong visual features. Motion capture technology is used in order to support the immediate response to the user's actions...|$|E
40|$|The {{use of a}} {{regenerative}} braking mode can reduce overall vehicle energy usage {{for most of the}} most common drive cycles. However, a number of technical issues restrict the use of {{regenerative braking}} for all possible braking situations. These issues are concerned with two key limitations. The first is related to physical limitations of the applied regenerative braking system, e. g. Electric Motor (<b>E-Motor)</b> power limits; energy storage device capacity and vehicle load transfer etc. The second limitation results from the potentially detrimental interaction between regenerative braking and the Anti-locking Braking System (ABS). The first type of limitation can, to some extent, be alleviated by suitable choice of hardware and, as a consequence, will not be discussed further in this paper. The second type of limitation concerns the regenerative braking strategies during an ABS event. Some of the regenerative braking strategies designed and investigated within the Low Carbon Vehicle Technology Project (LCVTP) will be described and analyzed in this paper. A comparison of competing strategies is made and conclusions are drawn together with suggestions for further research. The work has been progressed {{as a part of a}} major research programme; namely the LCVTP, which has been conducted within an extensive industrial and academic partnership, mutually funded by the European Regional Development Found and Advantage West Midlands...|$|E
40|$|Based on the {{fundamental}} principle of teaching psychology that retentiveness increases if students actively apply learning topics rather than only attend oral or visual presentations, {{the concept of}} learning factories {{becomes more and more}} popular. Academic education in the field of production science is imparted by means of real-world manufacturing facilities. By applying the manufacturing process of a real product, students or professionals incorporate the learning contents effectively and gain consciousness about their practical implications. Most learning factories are focused on lean manufacturing, lean administration or resource efficiency. As today manufacturing is not only subject to a single factory, but a network of globally distributed production sites, at the wbk Institute of Production Science,currently, a learning factory dealing with the topic of global production is developed. On the one hand, the curriculum of the Learning Factory Global Production (LGP) involves the specifics of local production sites with different location factors, such as different degrees of automation, cost structures and qualification levels, and their effects on the reconfigurability of the production systems. On the other hand, the interaction of the production sites in a globally distributed production network and the strategic configuration of the network are also subject to the curriculum. The manufacturing processes are exemplified by the assembly of an automotive <b>e-motor</b> with transmission in the learning factory on global production. The learning factory is realized in cooperation with the Robert Bosch GmbH...|$|E
40|$|EU {{cities are}} {{increasingly}} congested {{due to the}} demand and usage of motor vehicles. Future scenarios for EU urban centers see a modal shift in personal mobility from cars to lighter, smaller, more specialized and environmental-friendly alternatives. Electric L-category Vehicles (ELVs) are viable alternatives that can fulfill the commuter needs due to their small size and light-weight: by consequence the energy requirement, battery size and related costs can be strongly reduced respect to conventional electric cars. However, this modal shift must overcome one main challenge: most car drivers do not consider Lcategory vehicles as a suitable option mainly due to L-vehicle dynamic limitations. To achieve that, the RESOLVE (Range of Electric SOlutions for L-category VEhicles) project, funded in the Horizon 2020 framework - Green Vehicles GV 5 - 2014 call, will develop components and systems aimed to meet the low cost target required for this segment. At the same time, the project will deliver an exciting and attractive ELV driving experience by proposing new concepts (tilting and narrow track), while containing {{as much as possible}} the vehicle energy consumption. In this paper, the dynamics analyses carried out to develop the architecture of ELV vehicles are presented. A stability analysis of the vehicles in straight line was firstly carried out and the results were compared to tilting two and three-wheelers {{for a wide range of}} speed. A detailed multibody model was developed to simulate the steady-state behavior of the 4 -wheelers during turning and to perform further dynamic analyses. In addition, an entire vehicle model including electrical and mechanical components (battery, power electronics, <b>e-motor,</b> driveline, etc.) was developed to assess the ELVs energy needs during reference and real-world driving maneuver. The results demonstrated the feasibility of this novel kind of vehicles, confirming the exciting driving experience typical of tilting vehicles, combined with comfort, low environmental impact and limited energy requirements...|$|E
40|$|In {{recent years}} the number of {{bicycles}} with e-motors has been increased steadily. Within the pedelec – bikes where an <b>e-motor</b> supports the pedaling – a special group of transportation bikes has developed. These bikes have storage boxes {{in addition to the}} basic parts of a bike. Due to the space available on top of those boxes it is possible to install a PV system to generate electricity which could be used to recharge the battery of the pedelec. Such a system would lead to grid independent charging of the battery and to the possibility of an increased range of motor support. The feasibility of such a PV system is investigated for a three wheeled pedelec delivered by the company BABBOE NORDIC. The measured data of the electricity generation of this mobile system is compared to the possible electricity generation of a stationary system. To measure the consumption of the pedelec different tracks are covered, and the energy which is necessary to recharge the bike battery is measured using an energy logger. This recharge energy is used as an indirect measure of the electricity consumption. A PV prototype system is installed on the bike. It is a simple PV stand alone system consisting of PV panel, charge controller with MPP tracker and a solar battery. This system has the task to generate as much electricity as possible. The produced PV current and voltage aremeasured and documented using a data logger. Afterwards the average PV power is calculated. To compare the produced electricity of the on-bike system to that of a stationary system, the irradiance on the latter is measured simultaneously. Due to partial shadings on the on-bike PV panel, which are caused by the driver and some other bike parts, the average power output during riding the bike is very low. It is too low to support the motor directly. In case of a similar installation as the PV prototype system and the intention always to park the bike on a sunny spot an on-bike system could generate electricity to at least partly recharge a bike battery during one day. The stationary PV system using the same PV panel could have produced between 1. 25 and 8. 1 times as much as the on-bike PV system. Even though the investigation is done for a very specific case it can be concluded that anon-bike PV system, using similar components as in the investigation, is not feasible to recharge the battery of a pedelec in an appropriate manner. The biggest barrier is that partial shadings on the PV panel, which can be hardly avoided during operation and parking, result in a significant reduction of generated electricity. Also the installation of the on-bike PV system would lead to increased weight of the whole bike and the need for space which is reducing the storage capacity. To use solar energy for recharging a bike battery an indirect way is giving better results. In this case a stationary PV stand alone system is used which is located in a sunny spot without shadings and adjusted to use the maximum available solar energy. The battery of the bike is charged using the corresponding charger and an inverter which provides AC power using the captured solar energy...|$|E
