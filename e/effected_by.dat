5|$|Further {{purification}} is <b>effected</b> <b>by</b> {{a chemical}} transport reaction developed by Arkel and de Boer: In a closed vessel, hafnium reacts with iodine at temperatures of 500°C, forming hafnium(IV) iodide; at a tungsten filament of 1700°C the reverse reaction happens, and the iodine and hafnium are set free. The hafnium forms a solid coating at the tungsten filament, and the iodine can react with additional hafnium, {{resulting in a}} steady turn over.|$|E
5|$|Proper post-harvest storage {{aimed at}} {{extending}} and ensuring shelf life is best <b>effected</b> <b>by</b> efficient cold chain application. Cold storage is particularly useful for vegetables such as cauliflower, eggplant, lettuce, radish, spinach, potatoes, and tomatoes, the optimum temperature {{depending on the}} type of produce. There are temperature-controlling technologies that do not require the use of electricity such as evaporative cooling. Storage of fruit and vegetables in controlled atmospheres with high levels of carbon dioxide or high oxygen levels can inhibit microbial growth and extend storage life.|$|E
5|$|The {{absence of}} {{physical}} dividers between the sites occupied by individual oligonucleotides, {{a very limited}} space {{on the surface of}} the microarray (one oligonucleotide sequence occupies a square 25×25μm) and the requirement of high fidelity of oligonucleotide synthesis dictate the use of site-selective 5'-deprotection techniques. In one approach, the removal of the 5'-O-DMT group is <b>effected</b> <b>by</b> electrochemical generation of the acid at the required site(s). Another approach uses 5'-O-(α-methyl-6-nitropiperonyloxycarbonyl) (MeNPOC) protecting group, which can be removed by irradiation with UV light of 365nm wavelength.|$|E

5|$|Giganotosaurus was {{discovered}} in the Candeleros Formation, which was deposited during the Early Cenomanian age of the Late Cretaceous period, approximately 98 to 97 million years ago, although Holtz provided an earlier lower bound for its age of 99.6 million years. This formation is the lowest unit in the Neuquén Group, wherein {{it is part of}} the Río Limay Subgroup. The formation is composed of coarse and medium-grained sandstones deposited in a fluvial environment (associated with rivers and streams), and in aeolian conditions (<b>effected</b> <b>by</b> wind). Paleosols (buried soil), siltstones, and claystones are present, some of which represent swamp conditions.|$|E
5|$|In 1850, Kentuckians {{ratified}} {{their third}} constitution. One of many changes <b>effected</b> <b>by</b> this document {{was that the}} office of superintendent became elective. Though the election belonged to the Democrats, Breckinridge, a Whig, was elected over five challengers for the office. His tenure would be a short one, however. Unlike his early reforms, his calls for parental selection of textbooks {{and use of the}} Bible as the primary reading material were not heeded. He also opposed the abolition of tuition charges and unsuccessfully lobbied for a pay increase for his position. (The salary was only $750.) With little prospect of further reform under his leadership, Breckinridge resigned in 1853.|$|E

During his visit he met with William D. Coolidge. Coolidge was shocked when Oliphant informed him that the British had predicted that only ten kilograms of uranium-235 would be sufficient to supply a chain reaction <b>effected</b> <b>by</b> fast moving neutrons. While in America, Oliphant discovered that the chairman of the OSRD S-1 Section, Lyman Briggs, had locked away the MAUD reports transferred from Britain entailing the initial discoveries and had not informed the S-1 Committee members of all its findings.|$|E
5|$|Some parasites feed on giraffes. They {{are often}} hosts for ticks, {{especially}} {{in the area around}} the genitals, which has thinner skin than other areas. Tick species that commonly feed on giraffes are those of genera Hyalomma, Amblyomma and Rhipicephalus. Giraffes may rely on red-billed and yellow-billed oxpeckers to clean them of ticks and alert them to danger. Giraffes host numerous species of internal parasite and are susceptible to various diseases. They were victims of the (now eradicated) viral illness rinderpest. Giraffes can also suffer from a skin disorder, which {{comes in the form of}} wrinkles, lesions or raw fissures. It appears to be caused by a nematode and may be further <b>effected</b> <b>by</b> fungal infections. As much as 79% of giraffes show signs of the disease in Ruaha National Park.|$|E
5|$|The first {{mention of}} an organ in the abbey dates to 1634, {{but nothing is}} known of that instrument. The first {{properly}} recorded organ in Bath Abbey was built by Abraham Jordan in 1708. It was modified in 1718 and 1739 by Jordan's son. The specification recorded in 1800 was one of twenty stops spread over three manuals. The compasses of the manuals were extended, {{one and a half}} octaves of pedals were added and the instrument renovated in 1802 by John Holland; further repairs were <b>effected</b> <b>by</b> Flight & Robson in 1826. This instrument was removed first to the Bishop's Palace at Wells in 1836, then to St Mary's Church, Yatton, where it was subsequently rebuilt and extensively modified.|$|E

Everyone did as he was directed and there was not a murmur or cry amongst them until the ship made her final plunge – all received their orders and carried them out as if they were embarking instead of going to the bottom – I never saw any embarkation conducted with so little noise or confusion.|$|E
5|$|Both the 1930s episode and the {{outbreak}} of competitive devaluation that began in 2009 occurred during global economic downturns. An important difference with the 2010s period is that international traders are much better able to hedge their exposures to exchange rate volatility due to more sophisticated financial markets. A second difference is that during the later period devaluations have invariably been <b>effected</b> <b>by</b> nations expanding their money supplies—either by creating money to buy foreign currency, {{in the case of}} direct interventions, or by creating money to inject into their domestic economies, with quantitative easing. If all nations try to devalue at once, the net effect on exchange rates could cancel out leaving them largely unchanged, but the expansionary effect of the interventions would remain. So while there has been no collaborative intent, some economists such as Berkeley's Barry Eichengreen and Goldman Sachs's Dominic Wilson have suggested the net effect will be similar to semi-coordinated monetary expansion which will help the global economy.|$|E
5|$|During the Battle of Dogger Bank in 1915, the aftermost barbette of the German {{flagship}} Seydlitz {{was struck}} by a British 13.5-inch shell from HMS Lion. The shell did not penetrate the barbette, but it dislodged a piece of the barbette armour that allowed the flame from the shell's detonation to enter the barbette. The propellant charges being hoisted upwards were ignited, and the fireball flashed up into the turret and down into the magazine, setting fire to charges removed from their brass cartridge cases. The gun crew tried to escape into the next turret, which allowed the flash to spread into that turret as well, killing the crews of both turrets. Seydlitz was saved from near-certain destruction only by emergency flooding of her after magazines, which had been <b>effected</b> <b>by</b> Wilhelm Heidkamp. This near-disaster was due to the way that ammunition handling was arranged and was common to both German and British battleships and battlecruisers, but the lighter protection on the latter made them more vulnerable to the turret or barbette being penetrated. The Germans learned from investigating the damaged Seydlitz and instituted measures to ensure that ammunition handling minimised any possible exposure to flash.|$|E

5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the hurricane, president George W. Bush declared 13counties–Bay, Calhoun, Escambia, Franklin, Gulf, Holmes, Jackson, Monroe, Okaloosa, Santa Rosa, Wakulla, Walton and Washington– in Florida as federal disaster areas. Applicants, including units of local government, in 19counties became eligible for Public Assistance funds for emergency services and debris removal and to help restore or rebuild essential public facilities. On July 10, President Bush ordered the release of federal disaster funds and emergency resources for Florida to aid people <b>effected</b> <b>by</b> Dennis. One day after the storm made landfall, four disaster recovery centers were opened by disaster officials, two in Escambia County, and two in Santa Rosa County. Supplies of food, water and ice were supplied from staging areas to distribution centers throughout the Florida Panhandle. The American Red Cross and other voluntary agencies assisted with food and water distribution as well as emergency needs and housing. Subsequently, an additional disaster relief center was opened in Santa Rosa County. Just days after the storm, six additional counties became eligible for federal disaster aid.|$|E
5|$|The viper dogfish feeds {{primarily}} on bony fishes, notably lanternfishes in the genera Benthosema and Diaphus, and also takes crustaceans. Its long jaws and slender teeth are adapted for grasping rather than cutting, {{in contrast to}} the short jaws and saw-like lower teeth of other dogfish sharks that are suited for excising chunks of meat. Prey is seized by a rapid extension of the jaws and swallowed whole; the shark can consume fish close to 40% as long as itself. The viper dogfish is the only dogfish species that lacks a suborbital muscle, which is normally responsible for pulling the jaws forward when biting. Jaw protrusion is instead <b>effected</b> <b>by</b> the hyomandibular bone, which is articulated to the skull in a manner that allows it to swing down and forward. This unique arrangement serves to increase the distance the shark can protrude its jaws, as well as the size of its gape both vertically and horizontally.|$|E
5|$|There {{are almost}} no {{reliable}} sources {{with which to}} track the population of Scotland before the late seventeenth century. Estimates based on English records suggest {{that by the end}} of the Middle Ages the Black Death and subsequent recurring outbreaks of the plague may have caused the population of Scotland to fall as low as half a million people. Price inflation, which generally reflects growing demand for food, suggests that this probably expanded in the first half of the sixteenth century, levelling off after the famine of 1595, as prices were relatively stable in the early seventeenth century. Calculations based on Hearth Tax returns for 1691 indicate a population of 1,234,575. This level may have been seriously <b>effected</b> <b>by</b> the famines of the 1690s. The first reliable information available on national population is from the census conducted by the Reverend Alexander Webster in 1755, which showed the inhabitants of Scotland as 1,265,380 persons.|$|E
