500|$|The third {{draft of}} the script added cameos by two actors from the sister {{television}} series [...] Robert Picardo appears as the Enterprises Emergency Medical Hologram; Picardo played the holographic Doctor on Voyager. His line [...] "I'm a doctor, not a door stop", is an allusion to the Star Trek original series character Dr. Leonard McCoy. Picardo's fellow Voyager actor Ethan Phillips, who played Neelix, cameos as a nightclub Maitre d' in the holodeck scene. Phillips recalled that the producers wanted the fans to be left guessing whether he was the person who played Neelix or not, as he did {{not appear in the}} credits; [...] "It was <b>just</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> goofy thing to do." [...] During production there were incorrect rumors that Avery Brooks would reprise his role as [...] captain Benjamin Sisko. As with many Star Trek productions, new and disposable redshirt characters are killed off {{over the course of the}} plot.|$|E

5000|$|Regarding {{the band}} name, Brett {{said in an}} interview: [...] "It's <b>just</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> stupid name. We used to have this really obnoxious drummer, {{and he used to}} call me 'Handsome', that was his {{nickname}} for me, I think for sarcastic reasons... And he wanted to call it the Handsome Family... and we thought it was funny, too. We {{thought it was a good}} name." ...|$|E

5000|$|Some {{visitors}} and Denver residents appreciate the design, {{such as the}} Andreesons, who said, “We’re in normal looking buildings every single day. It’s <b>just</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> experience {{to walk into a}} room that doesn’t look like rooms that we would normally be in.” [...] Sharp said that was exactly what the museum was looking for in their expansion. He said the museum’s board was seeking the opportunity to draw people to the city.|$|R
5000|$|Miller {{said of the}} album, [...] "This is a party record, man. It's {{about getting}} up and getting ready to dance. It's like the {{fraternity}} party gigs I used to play in college. I went through and picked all my favorite tunes that I really, really loved. I wanted to make this record forever; it started off as <b>just</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> goof, and then it got real serious." ...|$|E
5000|$|New Wave is the band's {{first album}} with major label Sire Records. Some fans responded {{negatively}} to the decision, calling them [...] "sell-outs". Singer/guitarist Laura Jane Grace commented on this, saying [...] "It's <b>just</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> self-defeating, shoot {{yourself in the}} foot-like attitude to have. I find it completely frustrating and off-putting and it turns me off of the punk scene really because people are very closed minded." ...|$|E
5000|$|Lucas {{needs to}} come back to combat some drama that is going on in Haley's life and we kind of get {{a little bit of an}} {{opportunity}} to see what we really loved in the relationship between Haley and Luke. It's <b>just</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> little throwback and a little visit for our fans and for our wonderful following. It's a solution to a problem. —Chad Michael Murray on Lucas' return, in an interview with E!.|$|E
6000|$|... "To sea," [...] Joe {{answered}} demurely, {{not sure}} <b>of</b> <b>just</b> what <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> reception {{he was to}} get, and fingering his sou'wester nervously.|$|R
500|$|Previously a kiss between Lana Crawford (Bridget Neval) and Sky Mangel (Stephanie McIntosh) in 2004 {{received}} {{complaints from}} conservative groups. The show's producers called the kiss between Sunny and Donna [...] "impulsive" [...] and Robbie agreed, saying [...] "It's {{really not a}} big deal at all. It's not an actual gay storyline, it's <b>just</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> impulsive peck". The storyline came weeks after rival soap Home and Away endured a backlash to its own same-sex romance.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{certainly}} am," [...] replied Kitty. [...] "Mrs. Catbird {{was delayed}} {{a day or}} two. I hope she'll get here to-day and then we'll get busy at once. I think we shall build in these bushes here somewhere. I'm glad Farmer Brown has sense enough to let them grow. They are <b>just</b> the <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> place I like for a nest. They are near enough to Farmer Brown's garden, and the Old Orchard is right here. That's <b>just</b> the <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> combination that suits me." ...|$|R
5000|$|Ronald Reagan told {{journalist}} and presidential scholar Theodore White that [...] "There {{was a feeling}} that I was <b>just</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> spokesman for John Sears." [...] Sears had been attempting to consolidate power in the Reagan campaign in 1980. He overstepped his bounds and was fired. William Casey was hired to take his place. Casey demanded administrative control of the campaign, but {{had no desire to}} control policy and by extension the personnel choices of the Reagan Administration—something John Sears was boldly attempting to control.|$|E
5000|$|In 2009, vocalist Perry Farrell {{stated that}} [...] "the box set was {{supposed}} to be released two years ago. It just took so long. We cut that deal on the box set when we were still together on the last record, and it took that long to get it co-ordinated and gathered and all those other things and it was <b>just</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> happenstance that we were together at this time. When Rhino saw that we were together they thought, 'Let’s just really work day and night and get the thing out.'" ...|$|E
5000|$|Fargo {{revealed}} to Tom Roland in The Billboard Book of Number One Country Hits that she originally offered comedian George Lindsey {{the chance to}} record the song first, but he turned it down. [...] "It was a natural song for me to write, cause my husband {{used to call me}} funny face and I used to call him fuzzy face because he always wore a beard," [...] she told Roland. [...] "It was <b>just</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> little song to him." [...] She wrote 16 verses to it but decided to use only the first two in her record.|$|E

6000|$|... "I should think, Harry," [...] said Kate directly, [...] "that George Purvis {{would want}} to be Secretary. He's <b>just</b> the <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> boy to like to be <b>an</b> officer <b>of</b> some kind." ...|$|R

5000|$|On August 11, 2016, Diva {{released}} a video poking fun of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton for the Super Deluxe channel. The video depicted a fictionalized Clinton attempting {{to connect with}} the millennial generation by various internet memes such as Dat Boi, Damn Daniel, and Nyan Cat, as well as performing The Dab and telling her supporters to [...] "Pokémon Go to the polls". The video was said to be paid for by [...] "Hillary for America", although that wasn't the case. In an interview with Creativity, Diva explained that the purpose of his video was to show that [...] "Hillary is <b>just</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> dorky mom, and it's so hilariously cringey when she tries to appeal to a younger audience,".|$|E
5000|$|Ebell {{has been}} given {{extensive}} media coverage, frequently cited or interviewed by journalists {{in a way that}} presents a false balance by giving Ebell's lay views equal weight with those of expert climatologists, and thus misrepresents the consensus of scientific opinion on climate change. A study of false equivalence in the media used as an example the Scripps Howard media company [...] "incredibly" [...] giving equal space to Ebell's comments that reports of recent warming from the World Meteorological Organisation and the National Climatic Data Center were unsurprising because of the Little Ice Age, so [...] "it isn’t much to worry about", and of a Science paper by Thomas R. Karl and Kevin Trenberth that [...] "the Karl-Trenberth analysis is nothing new — it's <b>just</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> summary of what the establishment thinks is true".|$|E
5000|$|In a MTV News {{interview}} {{while on}} the music video set for [...] "Me Haces Falta", the album's second single, Lopez announced {{she was working on}} the follow-up to [...] "Como Ama una Mujer" [...] and her first English-language album since Rebirth. According to Jayson Rodriguez of MTV News, the album would see Lopez returning into the pop, R&B, and hip hop world. Lopez stated, [...] "My Spanish album was kind of an opportunity to get away from what I do on my English albums, to kind of express a different side of myself. This next album is more of what people and my fans are used to — you know, <b>just</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> dance, funk, R&B, hip-hop, all that stuff, all mixed up together to make some great pop music. Basically it's just danceable music," [...] she said.|$|E
3000|$|... “No {{one really}} has a solution, and you <b>just</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> hear <b>a</b> lot <b>of</b> sad stories about people just jumping from {{relationship}} to relationship, or from friendship to friendship, so like no one {{really has a}} solution for it.” [...]...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't cry, Toby. Sometime, when I get big enough, I'll make Mr. Lord {{sorry that}} he whipped you as he did; and I'm big enough now {{to tell him}} <b>just</b> what <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> man I think he is." ...|$|R
60|$|It was <b>just</b> the <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{morning for}} a ride, and Abner {{appeared}} {{to enjoy it}} so much that Toby turned the little steeds {{in the direction of the}} village, driving fully a mile before going to the pasture.|$|R
5000|$|Mike Luce on Sermon [...] "We're {{fans of the}} 80s {{and back}} in the day there used to be that whole {{undertone}} .... oh, if you play that song backwards, you'll hear this message! So I guess I could tell you what it says. It really doesn't say anything. It recites a lyric from the same song, from [...] "Sermon." [...] We just play it backwards {{at the end of the}} song. It's just a homage. A tribute back to the old school.", [...] "It was completely done on a whim and we took a line that Davie (Williams) sang and just ran it in reverse at the tail end of the song. <b>Just</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> ... here you go. No hidden meaning; you don't have to play the song backwards to hear it. We'll just play it right out here for you." ...|$|E
5000|$|In {{the spring}} of 1987, Paul Kelly wrote a column in the Stanford Daily lamenting the lame stature of the school's mascot since it was, at that time, <b>just</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> big green dress. Responding to the dare, the drum major and others responded by having [...] "Tree Tryouts" [...] at the Shak at 2am on a Sat morning. Kelly {{was the only one}} who showed up. They put a song on the tape while the keg flowed freely. Kelly made a fool of himself dancing. At 5am, {{approximately}} 25 band members were outside his dorm with [...] "All I Ever.." [...] They gave Kelly one week to prepare a costume before a men's home basketball game. Kelly spent the following summer designing and building the first true Stanford Tree complete with surf shorts and white tails (as a tribute to the drum major Jimmy Jet).|$|E
5000|$|In Super Bowl XLIX, Baldwin {{was held}} to one catch for three yards and scored Seattle's last {{touchdown}} of the season as they failed to repeat as Super Bowl champions. Baldwin celebrated the touchdown with a vulgar pantomime which gained significant attention on social media as the [...] "poopdown", and which earned a 15-yard penalty for unsportsmanlike conduct. He commented after the game that the celebration was directed at an unnamed group, who were not present at the game. He was later fined $11,025 for his actions by the NFL. [...] The Seahawks did not score again in the game, {{and went on to}} lose 28-24 to the New England Patriots. Baldwin later apologized for the incident, clarifying that the gesture was directed at opposing star cornerback Darrelle Revis, and that [...] "it was <b>just</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> built-up frustration I was letting out in that sequence, between him and I." ...|$|E
5000|$|Oaths {{are also}} being {{confused}} with [...] "vows", but vows are really <b>just</b> <b>a</b> special <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> oath.|$|R
6000|$|... "Going {{to marry}} with her, hey? Well, {{if either of}} 'em gets sick they won't have to go far for advice, and they won't have any doctor's bills to pay. Still, I shouldn't ha' picked out <b>just</b> that <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> wife for him." ...|$|R
60|$|So {{then the}} {{camel-driver}} {{was in a}} sweat; and he cried, and begged, and took on, and went down on his knees, {{and said he was}} <b>just</b> that <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> man, and said he could fetch a thousand people that would say he wasn't ever described so exact before.|$|R
5000|$|According to drummer Andrew Cook:"I was a cook at a {{place called}} McCarthy's Pub in Massachusetts. A bunch of police cars and {{ambulances}} went screaming by and the name popped in my head. Like, thinking about how people never really think what's 'on the receiving end of sirens,' because its such a common thing just to hear the sirens. Especially {{if you live in a}} city, it just becomes this commonplace thing, nobody thinks twice about it anymore. Even though there's so much awful stuff going on in the world, and horrible things that happen to people, it's kind of like 'out of sight, out of mind.' It's <b>just</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> sad thing. So it's kind of a commentary on that. It also works on a couple levels. It can be taken as the Greek mythology example with the Sirens that lure sailors in with their singing, so being on the receiving end of those sirens isn't a great thing. It works both ways." ...|$|E
5000|$|Kayti Burt of Den of Geek wrote, [...] "What, exactly, {{does this}} accomplish? It {{probably}} makes Lee hurt less, but I've never considered {{her to be}} a coward or someone that would put her own feelings above the safety of others. (After all, she did date Jim Gordon.) This felt like a contrived move for a character Gotham wasn't quite sure what to do with. That being said, as a character that Gotham wasn't quite sure what to do with, I'm pretty darn eager to see what Lee does next." [...] MaryAnn Sleasman of TV Guide wrote, [...] "It's <b>just</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> lot, all at once, with varying degrees of success in the realm of grabbing our interest. This is the part of the season where the wheels come precariously close to falling off, and I need Gotham to keep it together for just a few more episodes. We're so close to the end of what has generally been a strong season." ...|$|E
5000|$|The third {{draft of}} the script added cameos by two actors from the sister {{television}} series Star Trek: Voyager.

50|$|In 2005, Blu began {{a project}} in Los Angeles, {{recording}} some swing and jazz songs which he had written over the years along with some classic standards which had been favorites of his. Heavily influenced by artists like Harry Connick Jr. in his early life (and more recently Elvis Presley, Dean Martin and Brian Setzer), Blu recorded his first independent Swing/Jazz album In <b>Just</b> That <b>Kind</b> <b>Of</b> <b>A</b> Mood. After finding licensing opportunities for some of his songs, including In <b>Just</b> That <b>Kind</b> <b>Of</b> <b>A</b> Mood and Ooh-Wee, which were featured on The Young and the Restless in 2007 and 2008, Blu decided to drop everything in China, {{move back to the}} United States and take a risk on initiating his music career back home. Returning to his musical roots in Swing and Smooth Jazz, Blu began writing and recording more original songs in the genre which would ultimately set him apart from major label singers like Michael Bublé, Jamie Cullum, and Harry Connick Jr.. Blu has since had his album In <b>Just</b> That <b>Kind</b> <b>Of</b> <b>A</b> Mood released in Eastern Europe by Universal Music Group (2008), released a new Swing/Jazz EP In A Groove (2008), been featured on multiple Swing and Smooth Jazz Compilation CDs (see Discography) and recorded a Latin Standards project with Peer Music, slated for possible release in 2009.|$|R
