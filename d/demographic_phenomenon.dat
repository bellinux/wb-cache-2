25|$|The ageing of Europe, {{also known}} as the greying of Europe, is a <b>demographic</b> <b>phenomenon</b> in Europe {{characterized}} by a decrease in fertility, a decrease in mortality rate, and a higher life expectancy among European populations. Low birth rates and higher life expectancy contribute to the transformation of Europe's population pyramid shape. The most significant change is the transition towards a much older population structure, resulting in a decrease in the proportion of the working age while the number of the retired population increases. The total number of the older population is projected to increase greatly within the coming decades, with rising proportions of the post-war baby-boom generations reaching retirement. This will cause a high burden on the working age population as they provide for the increasing number of the older population.|$|E

The causes of baby booms involves various fertility factors. The most well-known baby boom occurred immediately after World War II during the Cold War.

By 1980, the population of the Sun Belt had risen to exceed that of the industrial regions of the Northeast and Midwest—the Rust Belt which steadily lost industry, and had little population growth. The rise of the Sun Belt was the culmination of changes that began in American society starting in the 1950s, as cheap air travel, automobiles, the interstate system, and the advent of air conditioning all spurred a mass migration south and west. Young, working-age Americans and affluent retirees all flocked to the Sun Belt.|$|E

40|$|The study {{presents}} a structural form of demoeeonometric model of Polish economy. Generally, demoeeonometric models are mathematical ones, which are coding relations existing between basic economic and demographic values in formalized way. They allow to examine mechanisms of interactions {{of economic and}} demographic factors and to establish whether changes in demography are determined by economic phenomena and vice versa. The described model is linear {{with the exception of}} equasion determining variables Y 5, Y 6. It consists of 58 variables, 39 out of which are endogenous. The endogenic sphere of a model is divided into 6 blocks i. e. : employment, GNI, investments, foreign trade, consumption and <b>demographic</b> <b>phenomena.</b> Dynamic series of the period of 1960 - 1981 (21 years) became a basis of model estimation. Demo econometric model of Polish economy will be used for ex-ante simulation and construction of variant prognoses. Having assumed defined sequences of describing variables for future periods, {{it would be possible to}} calculate expected values for endogenous variables representing basic economic and <b>demographic</b> <b>phenomena</b> and to find their paths of growth.

The indicators that are included in mortality studies usually come from population indicators, social indicators or indicators of standard of living, inequality, and poverty (Lora 2008). Among the indicators that relate to mortality and current population trends are life expectancy at birth, life expectancy at age 65, the modal age at death, the Lorenz mortality curve, and the Gini mortality index.|$|R
