The First Assembly in December 1920 recommended that the Council take action aiming at the international organisation of <b>intellectual</b> <b>work,</b> which it did by adopting a report presented by the Fifth Committee of the Second Assembly and inviting a Committee on Intellectual Cooperation to meet in Geneva in August 1922. The French philosopher Henri Bergson became the first chairman of the committee. The work of the committee included: inquiry into the conditions of intellectual life, assistance to countries where intellectual life was endangered, creation of national committees for intellectual co-operation, co-operation with international intellectual organisations, protection of intellectual property, inter-university co-operation, co-ordination of bibliographical work and international interchange of publications, and international co-operation in archaeological research.|$|E

With regard to Hieracas (Haer., lxvii), he makes known a curious Egyptian sect by whom asceticism and <b>intellectual</b> <b>work</b> were equally esteemed. In connection with the Meletians of Egypt (Haer., lxviii), he has preserved important fragments of contemporary Egyptian history of this movement. With regard to Arianism (Haer., lxix), if he gives an apocryphal letter of Constantine, he transcribes two letters of Arius. He {{is the only one}} to give us any information concerning the Gothic sect of the Audians (Haer., lxx), as well as the Arabian sect of the Collyridians. He has made use of the lost report of the discussion between Photinus (Haer., lxxi), and Basil of Ancyra. He has transcribed a very important letter from Bishop Marcellus of Ancyra (Haer., lxxii) to Pope Julius, and fragments of the treatise of Acacius of Caesarea against Marcellus. With regard to the Semiarians (Haer., lxxiii), he gives in the Acts of the Council of Ancyra (358) a letter from Basil of Ancyra and one from George of Laodicea, and the stenographic text of a singular sermon of Melitius {{at the time of his}} installation at Antioch. In the chapter dealing with the Anomeans (Haer., lxxvi) he has preserved a monograph of Aetius.|$|E

2500|$|Several of Balzac's characters, {{particularly}} Louis Lambert, traverse mystical crises and/or develop syncretic spiritual philosophies {{about human}} energy and action that are largely modelled {{on the life}} and work of [...] Emanuel Swedenborg (1688–1772). [...] As depicted in his works, Balzac's spiritual philosophy suggests that individuals have a limited quantity of spiritual energy and that this energy is dissipated through creative or <b>intellectual</b> <b>work</b> or through physical activity (including sex), and this is made emblematic in his philosophical tale La Peau de chagrin, in which a magical wild ass's skin confers on its owner unlimited powers, but shrinks each time it is used in science.|$|E

Ironically, this time Cardoso was against the latter group, generating uproar among former academic colleagues and political allies who accused him of reneging his previous <b>intellectual</b> <b>work.</b> Economists still contend over its long-term effects; research shows that companies sold by the government achieved better profitability {{as a result of their}} disengagement from the state.|$|E

2500|$|Seeking {{a passage}} to a [...] "post-Marxist world", Brown began {{his turn to}} {{psychoanalysis}} partly because he had become disenchanted with politics after the failure of Henry Wallace's 1948 Presidential candidacy. In Life Against Death, Brown wrote that he had begun a careful study of Freud in 1953, because he {{felt the need to}} reconsider both human nature and the human race's future prospects. Commenting that he had inherited from Protestantism a conscience which dictated that <b>intellectual</b> <b>work</b> should be directed toward ending or minimizing human suffering, Brown addressed the book to everyone ready to consider new ideas and possibilities. Brown proposed a synthesis of psychoanalysis, anthropology, and history, calling analyst Géza Róheim's efforts in that direction pioneer work of significance second only to Freud's. Brown also commended Marcuse's Eros and Civilization (1955), calling it [...] "the first book, after Wilhelm Reich's ill-fated adventures, to reopen the possibility of the abolition of repression." ...|$|E

In Chomsky's view {{there is little reason}} to believe that academics are more inclined to engage in profound thought than other members of society and that the designation [...] "intellectual" [...] obscures the truth of the intellectual division of labour: [...] "These are funny words actually, I mean being an 'intellectual' has almost nothing to do with working with your mind; these are two different things. My suspicion is that plenty of people in the crafts, auto mechanics and so on, probably do as much or more <b>intellectual</b> <b>work</b> as people in the universities. [...] There are plenty of areas in academia where what's called 'scholarly' work is just clerical work, and I don't think clerical work's more challenging than fixing an automobile engine—in fact, I think the opposite.... So if by 'intellectual' you mean people who are using their minds, then it's all over society" [...] (Understanding Power, p.96).|$|E

2500|$|In {{the late}} 1980s Wilton {{came out as}} a lesbian, which gave her {{a strong sense of}} {{identity}} and politics as well as informing her <b>intellectual</b> <b>work,</b> although she never felt completely accepted by lesbians who had come out earlier in life because of her personal history of heterosexuality. She wrote in 1993, [...] "the positionality of [...] "lesbian" [...] offers a potent site from which to investigate the social, cultural and political interlocution of gender and sexuality". She saw herself as having a distinctly lesbian perspective on the issues she researched in a way that challenged the assumptions of colleagues and gay men, particularly in relation to gendered behaviour. In the lesbian edition of Sexualities (3, May 2000), Wilton noted the marginalisation of lesbian issues within sexuality studies and the journal. This conflictual approach was contra-punctuated by a warms in her personal relationships, which embodied a strong sense of solidarity with co-workers on sexuality, especially with gay men. She was keen to rework the debates on the relationship between gender and sexuality, and sought to integrate them as a focus for interdisciplinary study that included health policy, film theory, sociology of sexuality, as well as feminist and queer theory. Wilton's writing was aimed at both academic and lay audiences. Her published material reflected theoretical work on sexuality aimed at academics, a book designed for practitioner training, an introductory text for policy makers, discussion about the self-fashioning required by women who transition from heterosexuality to lesbianism, books for lay members of the communities involved in her research, and an edited volume on lesbians and film.|$|E
