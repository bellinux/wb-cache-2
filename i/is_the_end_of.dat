Midway Airport <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the line, which crosses the southwest part of the city before ending at the Loop. The Orange Line does not run 24 hours a day (unlike the Blue Line, which has 24-hour service to O'Hare), but does operate from about 4:00am to 1:00am, at an average of 8-minute intervals. The trip from Midway to the Loop takes 25 minutes.|$|E

25|$|The {{body of a}} fibula {{is known}} as either the bow or the plate, {{depending}} on the basic form. A bow is generally long and narrow, and often arched. A plate is flat and wide. Plates could be solid or openwork. The body was often decorated. The head <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the fibula with the spring or hinge. The foot <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the fibula where the pin closes. Depending {{on the type of}} fibula, and the culture in question, the head of the fibula could be worn facing up, down or sideways.|$|E

25|$|Signage present {{along the}} road {{indicates}} that SH-14 ends at US-64. However, both the Oklahoma state highway map and ODOT's internal control section maps show SH-14 turning east at this intersection. SH-14 then overlaps US-64, unsigned, into Alva, the county seat. The route continues through Alva, where US-64 and unsigned SH-14 overlap US-281. On {{the east side of}} the town, US-281 splits off to the north; this intersection <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> SH-14.|$|E
25|$|Dharmakaya is like space. You cannot {{say there}} is any limit to space in any direction. No matter how far you go, you never {{reach a point where}} space stops and that <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> space. Space is {{infinite}} in all directions; so is dharmakaya. Dharmakaya is all-pervasive and totally infinite, beyond any confines or limitations. This is so for the dharmakaya of all buddhas. There is no individual dharmakaya for each buddha, as there is no individual space for each country.|$|E
25|$|Thereafter, Waterton {{moved back}} to Canada to his {{hometown}} of Owen Sound, Ontario and largely led a life {{out of the public}} eye. During his later years, he continued to fly as an instructor and taught Eddie Sargent, the colourful and popular Owen Sound mayor, member of provincial parliament, newspaper publisher, promoter and record-holding swimmer, to fly. Waterton died in 2006, and was buried in Oxenden cemetery; his final wish was to be buried with water close by, and even closer <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the runway of the nearby Wiarton Airport, Wiarton, Ontario.|$|E

25|$|Though {{currently}} {{only known}} on Earth, life {{need not be}} restricted to it, and many scientists speculate {{in the existence of}} extraterrestrial life. Artificial life is a computer simulation or man-made reconstruction of any aspect of life, which is often used to examine systems related to natural life. Death is the permanent termination of all biological functions which sustain an organism, and as such, <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> its life. Extinction is the process by which an entire group or taxon, normally a species, dies out. Fossils are the preserved remains or traces of organisms.|$|E
25|$|Finally, we {{actually}} don't need uDummy because it's there {{just to put}} all unmatched vertices of U in queue when BFS starts. That we can do as just as initialization. The vDummy can be appended in U for convenience in many implementations and initialize default pairing for all V to point to vDummy. That way, if final vertex in V doesn't have any matching vertex in U then we finally end at vDummy which <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> our augmented path. In above pseudocode vDummy is denoted as Nil.|$|E
25|$|For Epicurus, {{the purpose}} of {{philosophy}} was to attain the happy, tranquil life, characterized by ataraxia—peace and freedom from fear—and aponia—the absence of pain—and by living a self-sufficient life surrounded by friends. He taught that pleasure and pain are measures of what is good and evil; death <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> both body and soul and therefore should not be feared; the gods neither reward nor punish humans; the universe is infinite and eternal; and events {{in the world are}} ultimately based on the motions and interactions of atoms moving in empty space.|$|E

25|$|The Sacrifice DLC {{campaign}} {{takes place}} before the main events of Left 4 Dead 2; and after the events of The Sacrifice comic. The original survivors of Left 4 Dead—Bill, Francis, Louis, and Zoey—arrive at the portside town of Rayford, in order {{to search for a}} boat that can take them to the Florida Keys. After finding an adequate sailboat, the Survivors have to manually start up generators in order to lift a bridge for their boat to pass through. One Survivor (canonically Bill) sacrifices himself in order to kick-start a generator once it gives out, so that the others may reach safety. This <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> Bill's story in the Left 4 Dead video game series.|$|E
25|$|He {{returned}} to sea in 1948 as Air Officer aboard {{the aircraft carrier}} Boxer. He {{was in the first}} group to check out in the McDonnell Phantom (later the Phantom I), the first carrier-borne jet fighter. After that tour, he was offered command of Boxer. With the absolute independence he was known for, he said, “No thank you. I have been at sea since 1934, I’d like a stateside tour, then I’ll be happy to take her to sea.” Turning down a command is never good; turning down command of a carrier, particularly Boxer, the newest of the best, <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> a career.|$|E
25|$|At Junction 8 a spur off the M40 with two-lane carriageways {{leaves the}} {{mainline}} of the motorway and continues {{for a few}} miles before ending (motorway restrictions ending) at a trumpet junction for Wheatley and the A418(A40) (the old junction 8), with the road continuing as a two lane dual carriageway as the A40 towards Oxford and farther on to Cheltenham and Wales. The spur can be accessed only via the M40 northbound, and traffic heading towards the M40 can join only the southbound carriageway. Traffic going {{in the other direction}} has to use the trumpet junction, and follow the A418 past Wheatley services. This short spur <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the original M40, prior to the building of the current Junction 8 and extension to Birmingham.|$|E

When completed with the speech, Lehman removed the flagpole that had blocked entrance to the roadway in front of 2,000 people, including 500 guests from the LISPC. Flags were raised and the Star-Spangled Banner was played by a band. Lehman noted that this <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> isolation for Long Island, but concerned if the city could afford maintenance as control of the Grand Central would be turned over from the LISPC to the city. The governor and state officials moved out to Mineola after the ceremony, where Lehman headed off for Albany, the rest went for a dinner. However, the first segment of the Northern State was opened, nine years after first proposed.|$|E
25|$|Recently emerged {{individual}} young wasps {{have black}} or brown eyes, while older individuals have pink eyes and grow wings to fly. When workers are first born, they often huddle {{together in a}} corner to avoid aggressive acts from other workers. Workers do not perform dominance actions until they are around 17 days old. Also, the emerging young B. petiolata body sizes increase from January through March, which <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> adult emergence. Since worker production extends {{until the end of}} January, workers arising this month were bigger in size than those born in the earlier part of the season, around November and December. Variations in reproductive capacity and body size of the female young are due to changes in the amount of food given to them when they were larvae.|$|E
25|$|Among Sephardi Jews, prayers {{known as}} Selichot (forgiveness) are recited before the regular morning service (these {{are the same}} prayers recited before Rosh Hashanah). In the {{different}} prayers of this day, Syrian Jews pray in the same maqam (melody) as on the high holidays. In Amsterdam {{and in a few}} places in England, America, and elsewhere, the shofar is also sounded in connection with the processions. The latter practice reflects the idea that Hoshana Rabbah <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the High Holy Day season, when the world is judged for the coming year. Because Hoshanah Rabbah is also linked to the high holidays as well as being a joy filled day some Hasidic communities such as Satmar have the custom of having Birchat Cohanim/Priestly Blessing recited during the Mussaf service. Some communities such as Bobov will only do this if it is on Friday. However this practice is not generally done.|$|E
