500|$|The {{race was}} umpired by former Cambridge Blue Mike Sweeney, his fourth {{appearance}} in the role. He had advised the coxes {{that he would not}} be afraid to disqualify either crew should he need to: [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>warn</b> them, it's irrelevant what their opinion is. [...] If they respond, fine. [...] If not, they're in trouble." [...] The race was sponsored by Beefeater Gin who, prior to the race, had signed a three-year contract to continue their involvement in the race, worth £250,000. The BBC also extended their deal with a new five-year contract to broadcast the race in the United Kingdom.|$|E
500|$|When {{the former}} Drummond G14 and P14 4-6-0s were rebuilt to Maunsell’s N15 {{specification}} in February 1925, the Southern Railway {{decided to give}} names to all express passenger locomotives. Because of the railway's association with the West of England, the Public Relations Officer, John Elliot suggested {{that members of the}} N15class should be named after characters and places associated with the legend of King Arthur. When Maunsell was told of the decision to name the locomotives, he replied: [...] "Tell Sir Herbert [...] I have no objection, but <b>I</b> <b>warn</b> you, it won't make any difference to the working of the engines". Walker was the General Manager of the Southern Railway, who had told Elliot that Maunsell's permission was required. The first G14 to be rebuilt, No.E453, was given the first name and christened King Arthur. The Urie locomotives (hitherto referred as N15s rather than King Arthurs) were also given names connected with Arthurian legend and were referred to as [...] "Urie Arthurs"; the Maunsell batches of N15s were nicknamed the [...] "Eastleigh" [...] and [...] "Scotch Arthurs".|$|E

2500|$|One anecdote, {{taken from}} the Purana, narrates that the {{treasurer}} of Svarga (paradise) and god of wealth, Kubera, went one day to Mount Kailash {{in order to receive}} the darshan (vision) of Shiva. Since he was extremely vain, he invited Shiva to a feast in his fabulous city, Alakapuri, so that he could show off to him all of his wealth. Shiva smiled and said to him: [...] "I cannot come, but you can invite my son Ganesha. But <b>I</b> <b>warn</b> you that he is a voracious eater." [...] Unperturbed, Kubera felt confident that he could satisfy even the most insatiable appetite, like that of Ganesha, with his opulence. He took the little son of Shiva with him into his great city. There, he offered him a ceremonial bath and dressed him in sumptuous clothing. After these initial rites, the great banquet began. While the servants of Kubera were working themselves to the bone in order to bring the portions, the little Ganesha just continued to eat and eat and eat. His appetite did not decrease even after he had devoured the servings which were destined for the other guests. There was not even time to substitute one plate with another because Ganesha had already devoured everything, and with gestures of impatience, continued waiting for more food. Having devoured everything which had been prepared, Ganesha began eating the decorations, the tableware, the furniture, the chandelier. Terrified, Kubera prostrated himself in front of the little omnivorous one and supplicated him to spare him, at least, the rest of the palace.|$|E
