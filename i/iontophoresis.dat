25|$|Cystic {{fibrosis}} may {{be diagnosed}} by many different methods, including newborn screening, sweat testing, and genetic testing. As of 2006 in the United States, 10% of cases are diagnosed shortly after birth {{as part of}} newborn screening programs. The newborn screen initially measures for raised blood concentration of immunoreactive trypsinogen. Infants with an abnormal newborn screen need a sweat test to confirm the CF diagnosis. In many cases, a parent makes the diagnosis because the infant tastes salty. Immunoreactive trypsinogen levels can be increased in individuals who have a single mutated copy of the CFTR gene (carriers) or, in rare instances, in individuals with two normal copies of the CFTR gene. Due to these false positives, CF screening in newborns can be controversial. Most U.S. states and countries do not screen for CF routinely at birth. Therefore, most individuals are diagnosed after symptoms (e.g. sinopulmonary disease and GI manifestations) prompt an evaluation for cystic fibrosis. The most commonly used form of testing is the sweat test. Sweat testing involves application of a medication that stimulates sweating (pilocarpine). To deliver the medication through the skin, <b>iontophoresis</b> is used, whereby one electrode is placed onto the applied medication and an electric current is passed to a separate electrode on the skin. The resultant sweat is then collected on filter paper or in a capillary tube and analyzed for abnormal amounts of sodium and chloride. People with CF have increased amounts {{of them in their}} sweat. In contrast, people with CF have less thiocyanate and hypothiocyanite in their saliva and mucus (Banfi et al.). In the case of milder forms of CF, transepithelial potential difference measurements can be helpful. CF can also be diagnosed by identification of mutations in the CFTR gene.|$|E

2500|$|Galvanic {{treatment}} in the beauty industry has been described {{since at least the}} 1970s and earlier. Sometimes called galvanism, the treatment aims to improve the skin in two ways: (1) cleansing: a process called desincrustation, and (2) nourishing the skin condition, through an electro-chemical process [...] called <b>iontophoresis</b> [...] (also called ionisation). This is achieved by the application of a small, constant, direct current. The treatment works on the principle that charged ions in the skin are either attracted or repelled from the electrodes, resulting in certain chemical effects.|$|E
2500|$|A gentle, passive range-of-motion {{program should}} be started to help prevent {{stiffness}} and maintain range of motion during this resting period. Exercises, for the anterior, inferior, and posterior shoulder, {{should be part of}} this program. Codman exercises (giant, pudding-stirring), to [...] "permit the patient to abduct the arm by gravity, the supraspinatus remains relaxed, and no fulcrum is required" [...] are widely used. The use of NSAIDs, hot and cold packs, and physical therapy modalities, such as ultrasound, phonophoresis, or <b>iontophoresis,</b> can be instituted during this stretching period, if effective. [...] Corticosteroid injections are recommended two to three months apart with a maximum of three injections. Multiple injections (four or more) have been shown to compromise the results of rotator cuff surgery which result in weakening of the tendon. However, before any rotator cuff strengthening can be started, the shoulder must have a full range of motion.|$|E
50|$|Tap water <b>Iontophoresis</b> as a {{treatment}} for palmoplantar hyperhidrosis was originally described in the 1950s. Studies showed positive results and good safety with tap water <b>iontophoresis.</b> One trial found it decreased sweating by about 80%. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved tap water <b>iontophoresis</b> devices for the treatment of hyperhidrosis.|$|E
50|$|<b>Iontophoresis,</b> {{also known}} as Ionization, is a {{physical}} process in which ions flow diffusively in a medium driven {{by the use of}} an electric current. <b>Iontophoresis</b> is to be distinguished from the carriage of uncharged molecules by diffusive fluxes of other molecules, especially of solvent molecules, for example by electro-osmosis, that is to say by flux of uncharged solvent molecules carried as a cross-effect of <b>iontophoresis.</b> These phenomena, directly and indirectly, constitute active transport of matter due to an applied electric current. The transport is measured in units of chemical flux, commonly µmol/cm2h. <b>Iontophoresis</b> has experimental, therapeutic and diagnostic applications.|$|E
50|$|<b>Iontophoresis.</b> <b>Iontophoresis</b> drives {{anesthetic}} {{through the}} skin by using an electric current. It provides effective anesthesia, but is generally unavailable to consumers on the commercial market and some regard it as inconvenient to use.|$|E

50|$|Use of {{lidocaine}} <b>iontophoresis</b> is {{an effective}} method for reducing pain and alleviating distress during venipuncture in pediatric patients. Rapid dermal anesthesia {{can be achieved by}} local anesthetic infiltration, but it may evoke anxiety in children frightened by needles or distort the skin, making vascular access more difficult and increasing the risk of needle exposure to health care workers. Dermal anesthesia can also be achieved without needles by the topical application of local anesthetics or by lidocaine <b>iontophoresis.</b> By contrast, noninvasive dermal anesthesia can be established in 5-15 min without distorting underlying tissues by lidocaine <b>iontophoresis,</b> where a direct electric current facilitates dermal penetration of positively charged lidocaine molecules when placed under the positive electrode.|$|E

5000|$|EMLA. EMLA is {{a topical}} {{anesthetic}} cream {{that is a}} eutectic mixture of lidocaine and prilocaine. It is a prescription cream in the United States, and is available without prescription in some other countries. Although not as effective as <b>iontophoresis,</b> since EMLA does not penetrate as deeply as iontophoresis-driven anesthetics, EMLA provides a simpler application than <b>iontophoresis.</b> EMLA penetrates much more deeply than ordinary topical anesthetics, and it works adequately for many individuals.|$|E
50|$|Reverse <b>iontophoresis</b> is a {{technique}} by which molecules are removed from within the body for detection. The negative charge of the skin at buffered pH causes it to be permselective to cations such as sodium and potassium ions, allowing <b>iontophoresis</b> which causes electroosmosis, solvent flow towards the anode. Electroosmosis then causes electrophoresis, by which neutral molecules, including glucose, are transported across the skin. This is currently being used in such devices as the GlucoWatch, which allows for blood glucose detection across skin layers.|$|E

50|$|<b>Iontophoresis</b> of {{acetylcholine}} is used {{in research}} {{as a way to}} test the health of the endothelium by stimulating endothelium-dependent generation of nitric oxide and subsequent microvascular vasodilation. Acetylcholine is positively charged and is therefore placed in the anode chamber.|$|E
50|$|In studies, {{acetic acid}} <b>iontophoresis</b> {{combined}} with ultrasound provided no better clinical results or shrinkage of the calcific deposits than did no treatment.

50|$|A 2012 study {{reviewed}} ten technologies: bioimpedance spectroscopy, electromagnetic sensing, fluorescence technology, mid-infrared spectroscopy, {{near infrared}} spectroscopy, optical coherence tomography, optical polarimetry, raman spectroscopy, reverse <b>iontophoresis,</b> and ultrasound technology, concluding with {{the observation that}} none of these had produced a commercially available, clinically reliable device and that therefore, much work remained to be done.|$|E
50|$|Plica {{syndrome}} treatment {{focuses on}} decreasing {{inflammation of the}} synovial capsule. A nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) is often {{used in conjunction with}} therapeutic exercise and modalities. <b>Iontophoresis</b> and phonophoresis have been utilized successfully against inflammation of the plica and synovial capsule. Failing these, surgical removal of the plica of the affected knee may be necessary.|$|E
50|$|<b>Iontophoresis</b> {{is useful}} in {{laboratory}} experiments, especially in neuropharmacology. Transmitter molecules naturally pass signals between neurons. By microelectrophoretic techniques, including microiontophoresis, neurotransmitters and other chemical agents can be artificially administered very near living and naturally functioning neurons, the activity {{of which can be}} simultaneously recorded. This is used to elucidate their pharmacological properties and natural roles.|$|E
50|$|In {{physiology}} research, {{sodium nitroprusside}} is frequently {{used to test}} endothelium-independent vasodilation. <b>Iontophoresis,</b> for example, allows local administration of the drug, preventing the systemic effects listed above but still inducing local microvascular vasodilation.

5000|$|Iontocaine was an {{anesthetic}} medication, marketed {{under the}} two brand names Numby and Phoresor PM900 by IOMED inc. It {{is a local}} anesthetic with vasoconstrictor, administered via <b>iontophoresis</b> through the skin. It can numb up to 10 mm of skin {{in as little as}} 10 minutes. It is a 2% lidocaine, 0.01 mg/ml epinephrine solution. It was manufactured by IOMED, Inc.|$|E

50|$|One study {{concluded}} that the iontophoretic administration of lidocaine was safe and effective in providing dermal anesthesia for venipuncture in children 6-17 years old. This technique may not be applicable to all children. Future studies may provide information on the minimum effective iontophoretic dose for dermal anesthesia in children and the comparison of the anesthetic efficacy and satisfaction of lidocaine <b>iontophoresis</b> with topical anesthetic creams and subcutaneous infiltration.|$|E
50|$|This can {{be tested}} {{by a variety of}} methods {{including}} <b>iontophoresis</b> of acetylcholine, direct administration of various vasoactive agents to segments of blood vessels, localised heating of the skin and temporary arterial occlusion by inflating a blood pressure cuff to high pressures. Testing can also take place in the coronary arteries themselves but this is invasive and not normally conducted unless there is a clinical reason for intracoronary catheterisation.|$|E
50|$|Another {{treatment}} technique {{known as}} plantar <b>iontophoresis</b> involves applying anti-inflammatory substances such as dexamethasone or acetic acid topically {{to the foot}} and transmitting these substances through the skin with an electric current. Moderate evidence exists to {{support the use of}} night splints for 1-3 months to relieve plantar fasciitis pain that has persisted for six months. The night splints are designed to position and maintain the ankle in a neutral position thereby passively stretching the calf and plantar fascia overnight during sleep.|$|E
50|$|Joint and spine mobilization/manipulation, dry {{needling}} (similar to acupuncture), therapeutic exercise, neuromuscular techniques, muscle reeducation, hot/cold packs, {{and electrical}} muscle stimulation (e.g., cryotherapy, <b>iontophoresis,</b> electrotherapy) are modalities employed to expedite {{recovery in the}} orthopedic setting. Additionally, an emerging adjunct to diagnosis and treatment {{is the use of}} sonography for diagnosis and to guide treatments such as muscle retraining. Those who have suffered injury or disease affecting the muscles, bones, ligaments, or tendons will benefit from assessment by a physical therapist specialized in orthopedics.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to topical antiperspirants (whose main active ingredients usually are aluminum or zirconium salts) treatment options include: <b>iontophoresis</b> (hands, feet), onabotulinumtoxinA (Botox) injections (underarms, hands, feet, and other localized areas), electromagnetic/microwave energy thermolysis of underarm sweat glands, laser-assisted {{removal of the}} sweat glands (underarms), other local procedures such as liposuction and curettage of the sweat glands (underarms), medications of the anticholinergic type that are taken by mouth, and sympathectomy surgery for sweating of the hands or head that can't be controlled by other means.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the late}} 1990s Whiteley began {{administering}} the hyperhydrosis surgery using the keyhole technique to treat patients with over-active sweat glands. In the mid-2000s Whiteley began administering <b>iontophoresis</b> at his clinic {{in order to}} treat the problem. In 2009 Whiteley became the first British medical doctor to offer the Laser Sweat Ablation service, which treats axillary hyperhidrosis. The process starts with a local anesthetic, followed by a laser surgery that permanently kills sweat glands involved in the condition and removes them via suction. The result is a reduction in excessive sweating in those with over-active sweat glands. According to Whiteley full recovery from the surgery is completed within four to seven hours for most patients. However Whiteley stopped performing LSA in 2016 {{with the advent of}} the non-invasive method [...] "Miradry".|$|E
5000|$|Sonophoresis is {{a process}} that {{exponentially}} increases the absorption of semisolid topical compounds, usually consisting of hydrophilic molecules and macromolecules, (transdermal delivery) into the epidermis, dermis and skin appendages. Sonophoresis occurs because ultrasound waves stimulate micro-vibrations within the skin epidermis and increase the overall kinetic energy of molecules making up topical agents. This technology {{has been found to be}} most effective at low frequencies (less than 100 kHz). [...] It is widely used in hospitals to deliver drugs through the skin. Pharmacists compound the drugs by mixing them with a coupling agent (gel, cream, ointment) that transfers ultrasonic energy from the ultrasound transducer to the skin. The ultrasound probably enhances drug transport by cavitation, microstreaming, and heating. Sonophoresis is also used without drug delivery in physical therapy, and as a complementary modality for <b>iontophoresis.</b>|$|E
