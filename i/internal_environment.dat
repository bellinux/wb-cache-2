5|$|Homeostasis is {{the ability}} of an open system to {{regulate}} its <b>internal</b> <b>environment</b> to maintain stable conditions by means of multiple dynamic equilibrium adjustments that are controlled by interrelated regulation mechanisms. All living organisms, whether unicellular or multicellular, exhibit homeostasis.|$|E
5|$|Enzymes can {{be either}} {{activated}} or inhibited by other molecules. For example, the end product(s) of a metabolic pathway are often inhibitors {{for one of the}} first enzymes of the pathway (usually the first irreversible step, called committed step), thus regulating the amount of end product made by the pathways. Such a regulatory mechanism is called a negative feedback mechanism, because the amount of the end product produced is regulated by its own concentration. Negative feedback mechanism can effectively adjust the rate of synthesis of intermediate metabolites according {{to the demands of the}} cells. This helps with effective allocations of materials and energy economy, and it prevents the excess manufacture of end products. Like other homeostatic devices, the control of enzymatic action helps to maintain a stable <b>internal</b> <b>environment</b> in living organisms.|$|E
5|$|Genes are {{regulated}} {{so that they}} are expressed only when the product is needed, since expression draws on limited resources. A cell regulates its gene expression depending on its external environment (e.g. available nutrients, temperature and other stresses), its <b>internal</b> <b>environment</b> (e.g. cell division cycle, metabolism, infection status), and its specific role if in a multicellular organism. Gene expression can be regulated at any step: from transcriptional initiation, to RNA processing, to post-translational modification of the protein. The regulation of lactose metabolism genes in E. coli (lac operon) was the first such mechanism to be described in 1961.|$|E
50|$|Environmental {{engineering}} can be branched {{into two}} main areas <b>internal</b> <b>environments</b> and outdoor environments.|$|R
50|$|The {{opening of}} these {{channels}} {{is central to}} a neuron’s response to pressure, often osmotic pressure and blood pressure, to regulate ionic flow in <b>internal</b> <b>environments.</b>|$|R

25|$|Some glial cells {{function}} {{primarily as}} the physical support for neurons. Others regulate the <b>internal</b> <b>environment</b> of the brain, especially the fluid surrounding neurons and their synapses, and nutrify neurons. During early embryogenesis, glial cells direct {{the migration of}} neurons and produce molecules that modify the growth of axons and dendrites.|$|E

50|$|Wholeness - {{the concept}} of wholeness {{maintains}} that a nurse must strive to address the client's external and <b>internal</b> <b>environments.</b> This allows the client {{to be viewed as}} a whole person, and not just an illness.|$|R
50|$|It {{has been}} argued that plants should also be {{classified}} as intelligent based on their ability to sense and model external and <b>internal</b> <b>environments</b> and adjust their morphology, physiology and phenotype accordingly to ensure self-preservation and reproduction.|$|R
25|$|Homeostasis is the {{property}} of a system, either open or closed, that regulates its <b>internal</b> <b>environment</b> so as to maintain a stable, constant condition. It was first proposed and coined by Walter Bradford Cannon, a former professor {{and chairman of the}} Department of Physiology at Harvard Medical School, and popularized it in his book The Wisdom of the Body.|$|E
25|$|The {{astrocyte}} is bidirectional, {{meaning that}} it can communicate and exchange information with both pre- and postsynaptic elements. Communication is primarily controlled by the change in Ca2+ concentrations, causing excitability within the astrocyte. The capability of a human to respond to change in both the external and <b>internal</b> <b>environment</b> is increased due to the hormonal regulation of the tripartite synapse.|$|E
25|$|The yeast S. cerevisiae was {{the model}} {{organism}} {{used during the}} two-hybrid technique's inception. It {{is commonly known as}} the Y2H system. It has several characteristics that make it a robust organism to host the interaction, including the ability to form tertiary protein structures, neutral internal pH, enhanced ability to form disulfide bonds and reduced-state glutathione among other cytosolic buffer factors, to maintain a hospitable <b>internal</b> <b>environment.</b> The yeast model can be manipulated through non-molecular techniques and its complete genome sequence is known. Yeast systems are tolerant of diverse culture conditions and harsh chemicals that could not be applied to mammalian tissue cultures.|$|E

40|$|A person applies her {{knowledge}} when she performs a cognitive task. The {{representation of a}} person’s knowledge of a task is accessible from a cognitive task analysis. The think-aloud method is useful for carrying out a cognitive task analysis because think -aloud data represent closely a person's knowledge. Various cognitive tasks were analyzed and models of cognitive tasks were developed based on the external and <b>internal</b> <b>environments</b> of tasks. Comparison between models of cognitive tasks shows similarities between the models. Further analysis suggests common features which {{formed the basis for}} the construction of a generalized model of cognitive tasks. This study proposed a generalized model which has four major categories referred to as (a) properties, (b) events, (c) essence and (d) rules of a task. These categories represent information and knowledge in the external and <b>internal</b> <b>environments</b> of cognitive tasks...|$|R
25|$|The low leakage {{and high}} {{capacity}} of tantalum capacitors favor {{their use in}} sample and hold circuits to achieve long hold duration, and some long duration timing circuits where precise timing is not critical. They are also often used for power supply rail decoupling in parallel with film or ceramic capacitors which provide low ESR and low reactance at high frequency. Tantalum capacitors can replace aluminum electrolytic capacitors in situations where the external environment or dense component packing results in a sustained hot <b>internal</b> <b>environment</b> and where high reliability is important. Equipment such as medical electronics and space equipment that require high quality and reliability makes use of tantalum capacitors.|$|E
500|$|Biology is {{the natural}} science that {{involves}} the study of life and living organisms, including their physical and chemical structure, function, development and evolution. [...] Modern biology is a vast field, composed of many branches. Despite the broad scope and {{the complexity of the}} science, there are certain unifying concepts that consolidate it into a single, coherent field. In general, biology recognizes the cell as the basic unit of life, genes as the basic unit of heredity, and evolution as the engine that propels the creation of new species. It is also understood that all organisms survive by consuming and transforming energy and by regulating their <b>internal</b> <b>environment.</b>|$|E
500|$|For any animal, {{survival}} requires {{maintaining a}} variety of parameters of bodily state within a limited range of variation: these include temperature, water content, salt concentration in the bloodstream, blood glucose levels, blood oxygen level, and others. The ability of an animal to regulate the <b>internal</b> <b>environment</b> of its body—the milieu intérieur, as pioneering physiologist Claude Bernard called it—is known as homeostasis (Greek for [...] "standing still"). Maintaining homeostasis is a crucial function of the brain. The basic principle that underlies homeostasis is negative feedback: any time a parameter diverges from its set-point, sensors generate an error signal that evokes a response that causes the parameter to shift back toward its optimum value. (This principle is widely used in engineering, for example in the control of temperature using a thermostat.) ...|$|E

2500|$|Most {{of these}} factors serve {{biological}} functions. [...] For example, the process of satiation helps the organism maintain a stable <b>internal</b> <b>environment</b> (homeostasis). When an organism has been deprived of sugar, for example, the taste of sugar is a highly effective reinforcer. However, when the organism's blood sugar reaches or exceeds an optimum level the taste of sugar becomes less effective, perhaps even aversive.|$|E

2500|$|Proteins {{interact}} with different protein partners and other macromolecules to achieve functions that support different functions in cells that support {{survival of the}} organism. Identifying these interactions may provide clues to their effects on cell processes. [...] As these interactions can be affected by both the <b>internal</b> <b>environment</b> and external stimuli, studying these interactions in vivo and at endogenous levels, as is recommended in BiFC, provides a physiologically-relevant context from which to draw conclusions about protein interactions.|$|E
2500|$|In {{order to}} detect weakly {{electric}} fields, animals must possess electroreceptors (receptive organs) that detect electric potential differences. For electric fishes, receptive organs are groups of sensory cells rooted in epidermal pits, which look like small {{spots on the}} skin. In each receptive organ, there are sensory cells embedded {{in the bottom of}} the opened [...] "pit" [...] that faces outside. Electroreceptors detect electric signals by building up a potential difference between the outside environment and the fish body's <b>internal</b> <b>environment.</b> Current flow due to such potential difference further results in a receptor potential that is presynaptic to the sensory fibers. Finally, this receptor potential leads to action potential fired by sensory cells.|$|E
50|$|Recovery {{distinguishes between}} the External Environment, {{the realities of}} a situation, and the <b>Internal</b> <b>Environment,</b> one's own {{subjective}} feelings, thoughts, impulses, and sensations. Two components of the <b>Internal</b> <b>Environment,</b> thoughts and impulses, can be directly controlled by Will. Control of thoughts and impulses allows indirect control over sensations and feelings. For instance, thoughts of insecurity and anxiousness can be replaced with thoughts of security. Similarly, a feeling of fear can be disposed by removing the associated belief of danger (symptomatic idiom). While the <b>Internal</b> <b>Environment</b> can be changed with cognitive reframing, changing one's External Environment {{may or may not}} be possible.|$|E
