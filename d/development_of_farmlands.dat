The results reveal the presence of economies of scale and artificial inefficiency in these farms. Further, an analysis of the short- and long-run efficiencies of all the cohorts by area, size and year dummy variables indicates that even the areas where agriculture is well developed and topographic conditions are suitable have better long-run cost efficiencies, and large-scale farmland have lower long-run but higher short-run efficiencies. Due to the inefficient use <b>of</b> <b>farmland</b> in the long run, farmers do not have the incentive to expand production scale; they are unable to enjoy the economies of scale, which shows minimum cost.

This process fragments the periurban agricultural landscape as it progresses outwards. A key aspect of this dissertation is to include metrics of size and dispersion as critical determinants of the returns to agricultural production. ^ We examine the crop allocation decisions of periurban farmers in the extended Indianapolis metropolitan area by estimating a system of simultaneous equations while also allowing for residual spatial autocorrelation. We specifically show that the creation a farmers 2 ̆ 7 market fosters the conversion <b>of</b> nearby <b>farmland</b> to specialized crops.

40|$|During the {{production}} of agricultural commodities, an agricultural landscape is simultaneously being produced. In many regions, agriculture is no longer valued for just {{the production}} of food and fibre {{but also for the}} social, cultural and environmental amenities associated with the landscape. The paradigm of multifunctional agriculture has become concerned with the joint production of agricultural products and these rural amenities. The loss of agricultural land especially in areas around the urban-rural fringe has greatly affected the demand for these rural amenities. In response, governments and volunteer organizations have developed programs to preserve farmland. The Niagara Region is home to some of the best fruit growing land in Canada but {{has a long history of}} fighting to maintain its farmland. Drawing from the multifunctional paradigm, this study analyzes the preference for different rural amenities and farmland preservation in this unique region.

40|$|Farmland {{conservation}} policies typically use zoning and differentiated {{taxes to}} prevent urban <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>farmland,</b> but {{little is known}} about the effectiveness of these policies. This study adds to current knowledge by examining the impact of British Columbia’s Agricultural Land Reserve (ALR), established in 1973, which severely restricts subdivision and nonagricultural uses for more than 4. 7 million hectares <b>of</b> <b>farmland.</b> To determine the extent to which the ALR preserves farmland by reducing or removing the development option, a multilevel hedonic pric-ing model is used to estimate the impact of land use, geographic, and zoning characteristics on farmland value near the capital city of Victoria on Vancouver Island. Using sales data from 1974 through 2008, the model demonstrates a changing ALR impact over time that varies consider-ably by improved and unimproved land types. In 2008, landowners paid 19 % less for the typical improved farmland parcel within the ALR versus that outside it. This suggests that would-be developers expect permanency in the zoning law, and prefer non-ALR zoned land. However, ALR land that is unimproved has a premium of 55 %, suggesting that this land is more valuable for agriculture than for development. Farmland located closer to the city or the commuting highway commands a premium if it has a residence on it, with a residence also explaining why smalle...|$|R

40|$|Changes in {{constitution}} {{and quality of}} the German agricultural landscapes and their effects on the population trends of common breeding-bird species are summarised and interpreted. Out of the 112 most common species, 30 species are considered as typical farmland birds. The majority <b>of</b> these <b>farmland</b> birds showed declining trends. A distinct recovery of a part of the species after the German reunification in the early 1990 s, in East Germany in particular, was followed by a decline of most species since c. 1996. In the latest period (after 2007) the declines seem to accelerate. Population decreases are stronger in West Germany compared to East Germany. Periods with a high proportion of set-asides (fallows) and organic farming (1993 - 1995, 2002 - 2005) were favourable for the population <b>development</b> <b>of</b> many <b>farmland</b> bird species whilst a high proportion of maize crops had a negative effect. The strong increase of maize crops for biofuel production after 2005 (caused by the new German Renewable Energies Act) and the abolition of the obligatory EU set-asides since 2007 led to declines in the majority <b>of</b> <b>farmland</b> species, also <b>of</b> species that benefited from the set-asides over a long period.

But the County continues to be developed into residential subdivisions. This thesis explores the inconsistency in the perspectives and actions <b>of</b> residents regarding <b>farmland</b> preservation and development. Contrary to what you might expect, those in the County who want to preserve farmland and those who are developing the land are often the same people. Individuals talk about the importance <b>of</b> saving <b>farmland,</b> even though they just bought a home that was built on what was an active farm. Farmers, who have a deep connection with the County's land and know its importance, choose to develop their farms. It's not a complete mystery as to why this is happening, but it is a wonder how these individuals deal with their personal inconsistencies. How do such individuals confront the inconsistencies that they face? Furthermore, how do they justify their actions regarding the <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>farmland?</b> How do these groups of people as individuals see themselves in relation to the conflict between farmland preservation and development? Are they simply ambivalent?(cont.) In an attempt to find out, I interviewed Lancaster County residents in two locations in the County where a farm had been developed into their single family homes. The farmer owners/developers were interviewed as well. The interviewees respond in numerous ways, but they all expressed a desire for balance. They support farmland preservation efforts, but they also believe that growth is necessary. This "balance" is how they expressed their ambivalence towards the subject. The interviews showed specific ways that information can enlighten the balance between development and farmland preservation. The County government is encouraged to take on the provision of information as a tool of intervention in this area. An informed public can then make better choices as to what the "balance" will look like. Local governments are responsible for implementing this balance by using zoning to control and direct development away from the County's agricultural land.
