5|$|The <b>DeKalb</b> <b>County</b> Courthouse serves <b>DeKalb</b> <b>County,</b> Illinois as {{its main}} {{judiciary}} building. As such, {{it is the}} location of any trials and court proceedings in the county. The <b>DeKalb</b> <b>County</b> Circuit Court falls under the Illinois 16th Judicial Circuit, along with the circuit courts in Kendall and Kane Counties. Through its 100-year history prominent criminal trials and other events have occurred at the courthouse.|$|E
5|$|Possibly the gem of the Sycamore Historic District is the <b>DeKalb</b> <b>County</b> Courthouse. The Courthouse sits in {{the center}} of a square facing Illinois Route 64, {{directly}} across the north/south street, Main, from the Sycamore Public Library. It is a stunning example of Classical Revival architecture. The current structure was erected in 1905 being the third in a line of courthouses to serve <b>DeKalb</b> <b>County.</b>|$|E
5|$|Today's <b>DeKalb</b> <b>County</b> Courthouse is {{the third}} {{in a line of}} {{structures}} to carry that name. In 1839 a log structure was built and called the county courthouse; the log building stood {{across the street from the}} current courthouse. Ten years later, in 1850, the second <b>DeKalb</b> <b>County</b> Courthouse was erected. From December 13, 1902 until April 17, 1924, DeKalb-Sycamore Electric Traction Company operated a trolley route between the two cities (DeKalb and Sycamore), which ended at the <b>DeKalb</b> <b>County</b> Courthouse. The current courthouse, which sits on the same site as the 1850 building, was erected in 1905.|$|E

5|$|Vernon Jones (born October 31, 1960) is an African-American Democratic {{politician}} {{from the}} US state of Georgia. Jones was {{chief executive officer}} of <b>Dekalb</b> <b>County,</b> Georgia, from 2001 until 2009, and in the Georgia House of Representatives from 1993 to 2001. As <b>Dekalb</b> <b>County</b> CEO, Jones presided over the Board of Commissioners, oversaw a 7,000 employee county workforce, and managed a $2.6 billion county operating budget. He unsuccessfully ran for the US Senate in 2008. After unsuccessful runs for the US House of Representatives (2010) and <b>DeKalb</b> <b>County</b> Sheriff (2014), Jones was elected to the Georgia House in 2016.|$|E
5|$|He {{was elected}} as chief {{executive}} officer of <b>Dekalb</b> <b>County,</b> Georgia in 2000, winning 64% of the vote, and was re-elected in 2004 with 54% of the vote. Jones is the first African American to serve as CEO of the county, and the youngest ever elected in the county. In April 2001, shortly after Jones became CEO, he voted, along with five other <b>DeKalb</b> <b>County</b> Commissioners, to offer life and health insurance benefits to the domestic partners of gay and unmarried County employees. DeKalb was the first county in Georgia to offer such benefits. During his administration, <b>Dekalb</b> <b>County</b> established the first local Homeland Security Office in 2001. Under Jones, <b>DeKalb</b> <b>County</b> approved creation of a new senior center, increased funding for roads, libraries, and park improvements while maintaining a balanced budget, and increasing the County's credit rating to AAA. As CEO, Jones promoted and achieved passage of a $125 million bond referendum that allowed for the acquisition of 2,735 acre expansion of the DeKalb County's green space, increasing the county's parks and green space by 70%. He requested and received Congressional designation of Arabia Mountain as a National Heritage Area. Jones was also primarily responsible for creation of Dekalb County’s first economic development department, which generated $4 billion in new investments.|$|E
5|$|The <b>DeKalb</b> <b>County</b> Circuit Court {{came into}} {{existence}} in June 1839 when the first session of court met in Sycamore's first courthouse building, though the building was somewhat incomplete. At first, it seemed, that Sycamore {{might not be the}} location of the <b>DeKalb</b> <b>County</b> Courthouse; other towns were vying for the county seat title. A now defunct town called Brush Point was the choice of a Dr. Henry Madden and Rufus Colton would have preferred Coltonville, where he made his home.|$|E

5|$|The {{third and}} current <b>DeKalb</b> <b>County</b> Courthouse was {{constructed}} in 1905 at an approximate cost of $137,000. The project reignited {{the debate over the}} county courthouse's location and, once again, the debate over which town would hold the coveted title of county seat. The county Board of Supervisors authorized the project in 1901 and appropriated $100,000 for the new building. The idea for a new courthouse originated as early as 1900, when the essential design elements of the Lee County courthouse were chosen as the model for the new <b>DeKalb</b> <b>County</b> Courthouse. Though the courthouse was modeled after the Lee County structure it does differ; the Lee County building, in Dixon, Illinois, has a rooftop dome and also is longer and wider than the <b>DeKalb</b> <b>County</b> building. By 1903, the appropriation had been upped to $140,000 and the battle over the county seat had begun.|$|E

5|$|Colton, the Clerk of the Court and {{preparer}} of the writs {{and process}} of the court, had set the first session of county court {{to be held at}} his home, in Coltonville. In his attempt to make Coltonville the county seat, Colton decided to hold a new election for the status. Colton made sure that Coltonville would win the election by telling only the population of Coltonville about it. His political tactics were eventually cancelled by an act of the Illinois General Assembly, after the <b>DeKalb</b> <b>County</b> court intervened. When court convened the sheriff served a court order declaring a courthouse be built in Sycamore. Afterward, Coltonville eventually suffered the same fate as Brush Point and disappeared from the map. These events seemingly settled the issue of where the courthouse and, in turn, the <b>DeKalb</b> <b>County</b> seat was going to be located.|$|E

5|$|From November 1984 to June 1987 the <b>DeKalb</b> <b>County</b> Courthouse {{underwent}} {{an interior}} restoration, which {{was completed in}} time for the sesquicentennial celebration for <b>DeKalb</b> <b>County.</b> The restoration, at an approximate cost of $100,000, was undertaken by Conrad Schmitt Studios of New Berlin, Wisconsin. The modern front doors to the courthouse hide the original, beveled glass front doors from view. Once inside the modern doors, the nonfunctional original doors can be seen, standing wide open, to be admired; each door weighs several hundred pounds. Past the doors, in the building's main lobby, is the large, marble staircase to the second floor. The staircase, as well as the lobby's wainscoting, is done in gray Tennessee marble. Most of the first floor is original to the building, including the hexagonal marble flooring, stained glass windows and two original, first floor courtrooms. The plasterwork along the walls and ceilings of the lobby is ornately decorated.|$|E
5|$|The {{north side}} of the <b>DeKalb</b> <b>County</b> Courthouse is not as ornately {{decorated}} as the south face but each has its own distinctive qualities. The courthouse drive, entering from Exchange Street, crosses below a stone porte-cochere on the courthouse property.

5|$|While, Jones and his {{attorneys}} initially hailed the verdict {{as a victory}} for the county because of the relatively low damages award, after the judge awarded the plaintiffs an additional $1.9 million in legal fees, <b>DeKalb</b> <b>County</b> ultimately agreed to pay the plaintiffs a total of $1.3 million for legal fees and damages in April 19, 2011 post-trial settlement.|$|E
