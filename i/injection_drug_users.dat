25|$|The {{distribution}} of naloxone to <b>injection</b> <b>drug</b> <b>users</b> and other opioid drug users decreases {{the risk of}} death from overdose. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that U.S. programs for drug users and their caregivers prescribing take-home doses of naloxone and training on its utilization are estimated to have prevented 10,000 opioid overdose deaths. Healthcare institution-based naloxone prescription programs have also helped reduce rates of opioid overdose in the U.S. state of North Carolina, and have been replicated in the U.S. military. Nevertheless, scale-up of healthcare-based opioid overdose interventions is limited by providers' insufficient knowledge and negative attitudes towards prescribing take-home naloxone to prevent opioid overdose. Programs training police and fire personnel in opioid overdose response using naloxone have also shown promise in the US.|$|E

2500|$|As {{a result}} of [...] "spillover" [...] along the US-bound drug {{trafficking}} routes and more stringent border enforcement, Mexico's Northern Border states have seen increased levels of drug consumption and abuse, including elevated rates of drug injection 10 to 15 times the national average. These rates are accompanied by mounting rates of HIV and STIs among <b>injection</b> <b>drug</b> <b>users</b> (IDUs) and sex workers, reaching a 5.5% prevalence {{in cities such as}} Tijuana and Ciudad Juárez, which also report STI rates of 64% and 83%, respectively. Violence and extortion of IDUs and sex workers directly and indirectly elevate the levels of risk behavior and poor health outcomes among members of these groups. Marginalization of these vulnerable groups by way of physical and sexual violence and extortion by police threatens the cross-over of infection from high-prevalence groups to the general population. In particular, decreased access to public health services, such as syringe exchange programs, and confiscation of syringes, even in view of syringe access and possession being legal, can precipitate a cascade of health harms. Geographic diffusion of epidemics from the Northern Border states elsewhere is also possible with the rotation of police and military personnel stationed in drug conflict areas with high infection prevalence.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{criminal}} justice system creates particular challenges for persons with HIV and Hepatitis C, {{many of whom have}} a history of <b>injection</b> <b>drug</b> use. The case of Scott Ortiz, taken from public trial and sentencing transcripts, reveals the manner in which incarceration may delay learning of important health problems such as Hepatitis C infection. In addition, the case of Mr. Ortiz suggests the bias in sentencing that a former <b>injection</b> <b>drug</b> <b>user</b> may face. Collaboration between the Montefiore Medical Center residency in Social Medicine and a Bronx legal services agency, Bronx Defenders, yielded the discovery that a decade after diagnosis with HIV and after long term incarceration, Mr. Ortiz was infected with Hepatitis C. Mr. Ortiz only became aware of his advanced Hepatitis C and liver damage during his trial. The second important aspect of this case centers on the justification for lengthy sentence for a burglary conviction. The presiding Judge in Mr. Ortiz's case acknowledged that because of his advanced illness, Mr. Ortiz posed no threat to society as a burglar (the crime for which he was convicted). But the Judge elected to use his discretion to sentence Mr. Ortiz to a term of 15 years to life (as opposed to a minimum of two to four years) {{based on the idea that}} the public health would be served by preventing Mr. Ortiz from returning to the life of a street addict, sharing dirty needles with others. Mr. Ortiz reports distant <b>injection</b> <b>drug</b> use, no evidence of current or recent drug use was presented during Mr. Ortiz's trial and he reports no <b>injection</b> <b>drug</b> use for over a decade. In this case, bias against a former <b>injection</b> <b>drug</b> <b>user,</b> masquerading as concern for public health, is used to justify a lengthier sentence. Mr. Ortiz's lack of awareness of his Hepatitis C infection despite long term incarceration, combined with the justification for his dramatically increased sentence, provide examples of how persons within the {{criminal justice}} system may face particular challenges to their health. </p...|$|R

40|$|BackgroundPerformance of the BED assay in {{estimating}} HIV- 1 incidence {{has previously}} been evaluated by using longitudinal specimens from persons with incident HIV infections, but questions remain about its accuracy. We sought to assess its performance in three longitudinal cohorts from Thailand where HIV- 1 CRF 01 _AE and subtype B 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 dominate the epidemic. DesignBED testing was conducted in two longitudinal cohorts with only incident infections (a military conscript cohort and an <b>injection</b> <b>drug</b> <b>user</b> cohort) and in one longitudinal cohort (an HIV- 1 vaccine efficacy trial cohort) that also included long-term infections. MethodsIncidence estimates were generated conventionally (based {{on the number of}} annual serocoversions) and by using BED test results in the three cohorts. Adjusted incidence was calculated where appropriate. ResultsFor each longitudinal cohort the BED incidence estimates and the conventional incidence estimates were similar when only newly infected persons were tested, whether infected with CRF 01 _AE or subtype B 22 ̆ 0 ac 2. When the analysis included persons with long-term infections (to mimic a true cross-sectional cohort), BED incidence estimates were higher, although not significantly, than the conventional incidence estimates. After adjustment, the BED incidence estimates were closer to the conventional incidence estimates. When the conventional incidence varied over time, as in the early phase of the <b>injection</b> <b>drug</b> <b>user</b> cohort, {{the difference between the two}} estimates increased, but not significantly. ConclusionsEvaluation of the performance of incidence assays requires the inclusion of a substantial number of cohort-derived specimens from individuals with long-term HIV infection and, ideally, the use of cohorts in which incidence remained stable. Appropriate adjustments of the BED incidence estimates generate estimates similar to those generated conventionally...|$|R
