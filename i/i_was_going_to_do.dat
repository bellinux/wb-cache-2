500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Tim Minear and [...] Vince Gilligan, and {{directed}} by Daniel Sackheim. Minear's original idea for the episode involved a convicted criminal {{who happened to be}} an atheist. While in prison, he would have heard the voice of God, commanding him to kill a truly evil man, and then he would have suddenly found himself mystically transferred out of the prison. Although the police would be after him, only Mulder would believe he was working for the greater good. Minear noted that [...] "I pitched it and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it, eventually, until we found ourselves at a point in the year where we needed a script really fast." [...] Executive producer Frank Spotnitz suggested to Minear that the [...] "convicted atheist" [...] should actually be Robert Modell from the third season episode [...] "Pusher". After this was decided, Minear put aside the [...] "Word of God" [...] story, as it was called, teamed up with Gilligan, and the two wrote the final script.|$|E
500|$|John Tobias {{said that}} his inspirations for the game's story and {{characters}} came from the Chinese mythology {{and some of the}} stories and rumored events about the Shaolin monks. Regarding the film Big Trouble in Little China, Tobias wrote that although this movie [...] "kind of Americanized my obsession for supernatural kung fu films from China, it was not my biggest influence. My biggest influences came from Tsui Hark films -- Zu Warriors & The Swordsman. We had to get them from bootleggers in Chicago's Chinatown." [...] Tobias' writing and artistic input on the series ended in 1997. Fifteen years later, he said: [...] "I knew exactly what <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with a future story. A few years ago I [...] a sort of sequel to the first MK film and an advancement to the game's mythological roots.

I did it for fun as an exercise in screenwriting, but it felt good to get that out of my system." ...|$|E
500|$|Unlike Stewart, who {{essentially}} hosted The Daily Show as himself, Colbert {{developed a}} correspondent character for his {{pieces on the}} series. Colbert has described his correspondent character as [...] "a fool who has {{spent a lot of}} his life playing not the fool– one who is able to cover it at least well enough to deal with the subjects that he deals with". Colbert was frequently pitted against knowledgeable interview subjects, or against Stewart in scripted exchanges, with the resultant dialogue demonstrating the character's lack of knowledge of whatever subject he is discussing. Colbert also made generous use of humorous fallacies of logic in explaining his point of view on any topic. Other Daily Show correspondents have adopted a similar style; former correspondent Rob Corddry recalls that when he and Ed Helms first joined the show's cast in 2002, they [...] "just imitated Stephen Colbert for a year or two". Correspondent Aasif Mandvi has stated [...] "I just decided <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> my best Stephen Colbert impression".|$|E

[...] He is the oldest of three siblings. McCormack has Scottish ancestry. McCormack states while he was growing up, he was shy and did not play sports. McCormack attended Stephen Leacock Collegiate Institute High School in Scarborough, Ontario. There, he enrolled in theatre and performed in high school productions of Godspell and Pippin, and decided {{to pursue a career}} in acting. McCormack recalls after performing in Godspell, his feelings towards becoming an actor solidified. [...] "...I remember after the first performance of that... I knew where to fit in. That was the beginning of my life as an actor. It changed me in that the concept of any other options disappeared. From that moment there was no question.

He really challenges you as an actor, and he really pushes you, and he really puts a lot of faith in actors to be able to — I think go further than they’ve ever gone before. Certainly for me on Nip/Tuck. You know, for obvious reasons…things I never thought I’d do. (laughs) But also just emotionally and character-wise and comedically. Every script was just this amazing emotional gymnastics. So that first of all: I was like great, I’d love to work with Ryan. And for me, the opportunity to do a comedy is something that I’ve been itching to do for many years now and also if <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> that–which is kind of a big risk for me–to be able to do that with Ryan, who I know so well, and then so much of the crew that I was familiar with from Nip/Tuck was kind of a dream scenario I would say." ...|$|E

In May 2000, The Smashing Pumpkins disbanded and Auf der Maur did not have plans to continue her music career. In an interview with Jam!, Auf der Maur said: [...] "one {{of the reasons why}} I took 2001 off is I didn't even know what <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with music. Maybe I was going to play in a cover band the rest of my life" [...] and that her [...] "relationship to music had become very army-oriented.

500|$|In 1943 Arthur Freed, the {{successful}} producer of musical films at Metro Goldwyn Mayer, bought the film rights to Best Foot Forward {{and made a}} film version starring Lucille Ball and William Gaxton. Donen moved to Hollywood to audition for the film and signed a one-year contract with MGM. In Best Foot Forward, Donen appeared as a chorus dancer and was made assistant choreographer by Charles Walters. At MGM Donen renewed his friendship with Kelly, who was quickly becoming a popular supporting actor in musicals. When Kelly was loaned to Columbia Pictures for a film with Rita Hayworth, he was offered the chance to choreograph his own dance numbers and asked Donen to assist. Kelly stated, [...] "Stanley needed a job. I needed someone to count for the cameraman, someone who knew the steps and could explain what <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so the shot was set up correctly." [...] Donen accepted and choreographed three dance sequences with Kelly in 1944's Cover Girl. Donen {{came up with the}} idea for the [...] "Alter Ego" [...] dance sequence where Kelly's reflection jumps out of a shop window and dances with him. Director Charles Vidor insisted that the idea would never work, so Donen and Kelly directed the scene themselves and Donen spent over a year editing it. The film made Kelly a movie star and is considered by many film critics to be an important and innovative musical. Donen signed a one-year contract with Columbia and choreographed several films there, but returned to MGM the following year when Kelly wanted assistance on his next film.|$|E
500|$|After {{the success}} of his 2002 {{documentary}} Spellbound, Jeffrey Blitz was encouraged by his agents to write fiction because of the larger revenue brought in by fiction films.

What if we met a kid that was lured into the spelling bee because {{he was in love with}} a girl?" [...] He had compiled a mental list of characters who he expected to encounter while making Spellbound, several of whom eventually became Rocket Science characters. Despite claiming to be [...] "allergic" [...] to autobiographical films, he was persuaded by HBO executive Maud Nadler to write a screenplay based on his own adolescence when he told her that, as a teenager, he joined his school's debate team to try and overcome his stutter. He says that he is uninterested in teen films, so [...] "the only way <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> a teen movie is if I felt like I could try to be more honest about what the actual experience of being a teenager is like." [...] He was aware of the clichés in teen films, so [...] "tried to undo them without wrecking them". Blitz wrote the script [...] "off and on" [...] over a year in between stints of commercial directing. He cites directors Hal Ashby and Billy Wilder as his greatest influences with their absurdist comedies, though critics have suggested influence from Gary Larson, Alexander Payne, Mike Nichols and Wes Anderson—the latter despite Blitz specifically saying, [...] "I did not want a Wes Andersen [...] snowglobe artificial world." ...|$|E
