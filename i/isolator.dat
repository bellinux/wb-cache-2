5|$|Isolation {{manifolded}} twin sets or manifolded doubles {{with two}} regulators, consist of two back mounted cylinders with their pillar valves {{connected by a}} manifold, with a valve in the manifold that can be closed to isolate the two pillar valves. In {{the event of a}} problem with one cylinder the diver may close the <b>isolator</b> valve to preserve gas in the cylinder which has not failed. The advantages of this configuration include: a larger gas supply than from a single cylinder; automatic balancing of the gas supply between the two cylinders; thus, no requirement to constantly change regulators underwater during the dive; and in most failure situations, the diver may close a valve to a failed regulator or isolate a cylinder and may retain access to all the remaining gas in both the tanks. The disadvantages are that the manifold is another potential point of failure, and there is a danger of losing all gas from both cylinders if the isolation valve cannot be closed when a problem occurs. This configuration of cylinders is often used in technical diving.|$|E

25|$|Scramjet (supersonic {{combustion}} ramjet) engines {{present a}} much different situation for the combustor than conventional gas turbine engines (scramjets are not gas turbines, they generally have few or no moving parts). While scramjet combustors may be physically quite different from conventional combustors, they face {{many of the same}} design challenges, like fuel mixing and flame holding. However, as its name implies, a scramjet combustor must address these challenges in a supersonic flow environment. For example, for a scramjet flying at Mach 5, the air flow entering the combustor would nominally be Mach 2. One of the major challenges in a scramjet engine is preventing shock waves generated by combustor from traveling upstream into the inlet. If that were to happen, the engine may unstart, resulting in loss of thrust, amongst other problems. To prevent this, scramjet engines tend to have an <b>isolator</b> section (see image) immediately ahead of the combustion zone.|$|E

25|$|The {{microwave}} bridge contains {{both the}} microwave source and the detector. Older spectrometers used a vacuum tube called a klystron to generate microwaves however modern spectrometers use a Gunn diode. Immediately after the microwave source {{there is an}} <b>isolator</b> which serves to attenuate any reflections back to the source which would result in fluctuations in the microwave frequency. The microwave power from the source is then passed through a directional coupler which splits the microwave power into two paths, one directed towards the cavity and the other the reference arm. Along both paths there is a variable attenuator that facilitates the precise control {{of the flow of}} microwave power. This in turn allows for accurate control over the intensity of the microwaves subjected to the sample. On the reference arm, after the variable attenuator there is a phase shifter that sets a defined phase relationship between the reference and reflected signal which permits phase sensitive detection.|$|E

The straightforward construction techniques of the Do 228 were also reproduced for the 328, despite making increased use of composite materials {{in areas such as}} the rear fuselage and empennage. The 328 reportedly made greater use of composites than any of its direct competitors at launch, the use of the Kevlar-carbon fiber composites is claimed to have reduced its weight by 20 per cent. Various materials are used across the airframe; amongst these, an aluminium alloy is used for the pressure fuselage and much of the wingbox, a titanium alloy for the tail cone, and glass fibre reinforced plastic for the radome and leading edge of the vertical stabilizer. Noise-absorbent material is located across the fuselage, while the cabin wall is hung from <b>isolator</b> brackets to reduce vibration and noise transference.|$|E
500|$|If {{isolation}} is high, directional couplers {{are good for}} combining signals to feed a single line to a receiver for two-tone receiver tests. [...] In figure 20, one signal enters port P3 and one enters port P2, while both exit port P1. [...] The signal from port P3 to port P1 will experience [...] of loss, and the signal from port P2 to port P1 will have [...] loss. [...] The internal load on the isolated port will dissipate the signal losses from port P3 and port P2. [...] If the isolators in figure 20 are neglected, the isolation measurement (port P2 to port P3) determines the amount of power from the signal generator F2 that will be injected into the signal generator F1. [...] As the injection level increases, it may cause modulation of signal generator F1, or even injection phase locking. [...] Because of the symmetry of the directional coupler, the reverse injection will happen with the same possible modulation problems of signal generator F2 by F1. [...] Therefore, the isolators are used in figure 20 to effectively increase the isolation (or directivity) of the directional coupler. [...] Consequently, the injection loss will be {{the isolation of the}} directional coupler plus the reverse isolation of the <b>isolator.</b>|$|E
50|$|Alternative <b>isolators</b> are {{typically}} built using ultra thin (0.01 mm - 0.02 mm) insulation layers, whereas optocouplers have insulation thicknesses up to 2 mm. The thinner insulation barrier means that alternative <b>isolators</b> experience much higher electric-field stress than optocouplers, {{and could be}} less robust under high voltages. Currently, there are no IEC component level safety standard available for such <b>isolators.</b> As a result, some manufacturers might seek IEC 60747-5-2 (older revision) or IEC 60747-5-5 (current revision) certification (a standard originally intended for optocouplers). Alternative <b>isolators</b> are structurally different from optocouplers and thus do not qualify for full IEC60747-5-2/5 certification, but only for BASIC insulation.|$|R

[...] Referring to this figure, power from a test equipment source (not shown) [...] enters the apparatus through the co-axial cable on the left and is converted to waveguide format by means of a launcher (1). [...] This is followed by a section of waveguide (2) providing a transition to a smaller size of guide. [...] An important component in the setup is the <b>isolator</b> (3) which prevents power being reflected back into the source. [...] Depending on the test conditions, such reflections can be large and a high-power source may be damaged by the returning wave. [...] The power entering the slotted line is controlled by a rotary variable attenuator (4).

40|$|Dynamic substructuring {{is often}} {{employed}} {{to reduce the}} size of numerical models for structural dynamic analysis. In this paper, we discuss how elastomeric vibration <b>isolators</b> can be modelled within the framework of dynamic substructuring in order to obtain accurate and efficient reduced order models. For several reasons, it is beneficial to divide a structure containing elastomeric <b>isolators</b> into substructures at the interfaces between elastomers and surrounding parts of the structure. Therefore, we consider the elastomeric <b>isolators</b> as reduced coupling elements in the connections of substructure models. The coupling elements are established by reducing the number of degrees of freedom of 3 D finite element models of elastomers. The main purpose of the studies presented in the paper is to evaluate the performance of different reduction method when applied to elastomer models. In addition, the effects of modelling features such as rotational coupling and frequency-dependent material properties of elastomeric <b>isolators</b> are investigated. A model of a wooden building structure with elastomeric <b>isolators</b> is used as an example case, considering steady-state dynamic analysis in the low-frequency range.

2500|$|A {{significant}} {{point is that}} the erbium gives up its energy in the form of additional photons which are exactly in the same phase and direction as the signal being amplified. So the signal is amplified along its direction of travel only. This is not unusual - when an atom “lases” it always gives up its energy in the same direction and phase as the incoming light. Thus all of the additional signal power is guided in the same fiber mode as the incoming signal. There is usually an <b>isolator</b> placed at the output to prevent reflections returning from the attached fiber. Such reflections disrupt amplifier operation and in the extreme case can cause the amplifier to become a laser. [...] The erbium doped amplifier is a high gain amplifier.|$|E
