5|$|The {{first time}} he cheated on me, I thought there was {{something}} wrong with me or the relationship, but when someone makes a habit of it, you know the problem lies with him. Yet I was foolish enough to give him a second chance because he begged and pleaded, despite the fact that everyone around me said he was still straying. I guess I really wanted to believe in him. Then I actually caught him red-handed. <b>It</b> <b>took</b> <b>me</b> a while to get out. But having done that, nothing can make me go back.|$|E
5|$|Nobody {{has ever}} cut {{anything}} from Andrei Rublev. Nobody except me. I made some cuts myself. In {{the first version}} the film was 3 hours 20 minutes long. In the second — 3 hours 15 minutes. I shortened the final version to 3 hours 6 minutes. I am convinced the latest version is the best, the most successful. And I only cut certain overly long scenes. The viewer doesn't even notice their absence. The cuts have in no way changed neither the subject matter nor what was for us important in the film. In other words, we removed overly long scenes which had no significance. We shortened certain scenes of brutality in order to induce psychological shock in viewers, {{as opposed to a}} mere unpleasant impression which would only destroy our intent. All my friends and colleagues who during long discussions were advising me to make those cuts turned out right in the end. <b>It</b> <b>took</b> <b>me</b> some time to understand it. At first I got the impression they were attempting to pressure my creative individuality. Later I understood that this final version of the film more than fulfils my requirements for it. And I do not regret at all that the film has been shortened to its present length.|$|E
25|$|I scored 114 in {{the first}} innings and 97 in the second. I will not claim that the first innings was a {{particularly}} good one, as <b>it</b> <b>took</b> <b>me</b> almost seven hours. But neither would I pretend {{that it was not}} immensely satisfying. I took ball after ball, blow after blow on that improvised body-shield but was able to stand firm...The second innings was the best I ever played. From the firm foundations of real confidence I was able to get after the bowling and repay Hall, particularly, for some of the anguish he had caused me. I had one glorious hour against him...I hooked him twice in a row and reduced him to the kind of despair which, but a fortnight earlier, had been exclusively mine.|$|E

I kinda had this whole fantasy {{of being in the}} car, and this whole movie played in my head. I didn't have a pen and paper. I got to the mic, I'm like, 'Oh, press Record.' ...|$|R

25|$|I thought I {{would write}} Memories and the City in six months, but <b>it</b> <b>took</b> <b>me</b> {{one year to}} complete. And I was working twelve hours a day, just reading and working. My life, because of so many things, was in a crisis; I don’t {{want to go into}} those details: divorce, father dying, {{professional}} problems, problems with this, problems with that, everything was bad. I thought if I were to be weak I would have a depression. But every day I would wake up and have a cold shower and sit down and remember and write, always paying attention to the beauty of the book. Honestly, I may have hurt my mother, my family. My father was dead, but my mother is still alive. But I can’t care about that; I must care about the beauty of the book.|$|E
500|$|In 2001, Chabon {{reflected}} {{on the success of}} his first novel by saying that while [...] "the upside was that I was published and I got a readership, ... downside ... was that, emotionally, this stuff started happening and I was still like, 'Wait a minute, is my thesis done yet?' <b>It</b> <b>took</b> <b>me</b> a few years to catch up." [...] In 1991, Chabon published A Model World, a collection of short stories, many of which had been published previously in The New Yorker.|$|E
500|$|Bill Nighy as General of Infantry Friedrich Olbricht: Nighy {{was cast}} {{to give a}} {{sympathetic}} quality, so Olbricht {{would not be the}} [...] "fall guy". Nighy wanted to convey Olbricht as divided between complaining about Hitler's regime and actually doing something about it. The actor described his portrayal, [...] "One of the most disconcerting things imaginable is to put on a Nazi uniform. It's so associated with evil that <b>it</b> <b>took</b> <b>me</b> several days to get used to being in costume." ...|$|E

500|$|Also {{present at}} the session was David Crosby of the Byrds. He {{recalled}} his reaction to hearing the completed song: [...] "man, I was a dish-rag. I was floored. <b>It</b> <b>took</b> <b>me</b> several minutes {{to be able to}} talk after that." [...] Due to the multiple takes required to perfect the orchestral cacophony and the final chord, the total time spent recording [...] "A Day in the Life" [...] was 34hours. In contrast, the Beatles' debut album, Please Please Me, had been recorded in its entirety in only 10hours, 45minutes.|$|E
500|$|Some {{evidence}} shows that the idea for SpongeBob SquarePants dates back to 1986, during Hillenburg's time at the Orange County Marine Institute. Hillenburg indicated that children's television series such as [...] (19871988) and Pee-wee's Playhouse (19861991) [...] "sparked something in [...]" [...] He continued, [...] "I don't {{know if this is}} true for everybody else, but it always seems like, for me, I'll start thinking about something and it takes about ten years to actually have it happen, or have someone else believe in it... <b>It</b> <b>took</b> <b>me</b> a few years to get [...] together." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1960 Leigh {{recalled}} her ambivalence {{towards her}} first experience of critical acclaim and sudden fame, commenting, [...] "that some critics saw {{fit to be}} as foolish as to say that I was a great actress. And I thought, that was a foolish, wicked thing to say, because it put such an onus and such a responsibility onto me, which I simply wasn't able to carry. And <b>it</b> <b>took</b> <b>me</b> years to learn enough to live up to what they said for those first notices. I find it so stupid. I remember the critic very well and have never forgiven him." ...|$|E

500|$|... "I {{just feel}} like this record is really different- youve got club bangers to more 70s glam to more singer-songwriter records to rock music. [...] The Fame is not about who you are—it's about how {{everybody}} wants to know who you are! Buy it and listen to it before you go out or in the car. [...] I think you've really got to allow artists' creativity to marinate. <b>It</b> <b>took</b> <b>me</b> a while but really delving into myself I finally got it. I couldn't be more proud of it. It's not just a record it's a whole pop art movement It's not just about one song." ...|$|E
500|$|In the {{beginning}} <b>it</b> <b>took</b> <b>me</b> {{a little while}} {{to get used to the}} new idea of the sound, not having any screaming vocals and stuff like that. [...] But I think the album was necessary for us to do. Maybe the band wouldn't have continued if we hadn't done Heritage. [...] I think the old Opeth fans understand this album. There's always going to be some haters, but you can't be loved by everyone. Opeth has always been about not repeating ourself. A lot of people don't think Heritage is metal but I think it's metal to go somewhere people don't expect. It doesn't mean we're not embracing the past sound of Opeth.|$|E
500|$|On November 24, 2014, Sandoval [...] {{came to an}} {{agreement}} with the Boston Red Sox on a five-year, $90 million contract with a sixth year club option of $17 million or a $5 million buy-out.

It was a great experience <b>It</b> <b>took</b> <b>me</b> about a good two weeks to put all of the ideas that we had together.

500|$|The Klingon Targ {{was created}} by {{dressing}} a tamed wild boar (named Emmy Lou) in an outfit created by costume designer William Ware Theiss. Executive producer Robert Justman later recalled, [...] "That pig smelled horrid. A sweet-sour, extremely pungent odor.

[...] To appear as the Traveler, Eric Menyuk wore a prosthetic piece (created by Michael Westmore) on his forehead which ran into his hairline.

500|$|Fellow Jezebel writer Jia Tolentino {{wrote an}} {{analysis}} of Erdely's story and reported on fraternity rush after the Rolling Stone article was discredited.

So <b>it</b> <b>took</b> <b>me</b> {{a day or two}} to admit that I found many of Erdely's details unrecognizable. No one says 'UVrApe'; no one I know has ever heard the Rugby Road-themed 'traditional fight song' that poetically ('fuck for 50 cents'/'panties on the fence') separated the article's sections...

500|$|In a 2015 {{interview}} with The Pitchfork Review, Björk expressed frustration {{over to the}} lack of recognition for all of her work on Vespertine and her other albums. She said:I did 80% of the beats on Vespertine and <b>it</b> <b>took</b> <b>me</b> three years to work on that album, because it was all microbeats — it was like doing a huge embroidery piece. Matmos came {{in the last two weeks}} and added percussion on top of the songs, but they didn't do any of the main parts, and they are credited everywhere as having done the whole album.

[...] Richter scored 623.8 out of a possible 654.0 points during the qualification round of the 10 m air rifle. He would have needed a score of at least 625.5 to qualify for the finals.
