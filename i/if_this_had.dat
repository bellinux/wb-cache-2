Even <b>if</b> <b>this</b> <b>had</b> been reported from many different places, so that one would have to exclude the possibility that all agreed upon a lie, yet, we would not accept this as proof to the contrary, for the moon is not seen in the same way by different people...

5|$|Some {{scholars}} {{have tried to}} reconcile the conflicting accounts of the Chronicle and the De administrando imperio as implying a first recovery of Patras c. 805 {{as the result of}} Skleros' campaign, which was probably concurrent with the establishment of the Peloponnese as a separate theme from Hellas, <b>if</b> <b>this</b> <b>had</b> not been done slightly earlier. According to this interpretation, the Slavic revolt and attack on Patras followed as a reaction a few years later, between 807 and 811.|$|E
5|$|Engine failure causes {{problems}} on conventional subsonic aircraft; {{not only does}} the aircraft lose thrust on that side but the engine creates drag, causing the aircraft to yaw and bank {{in the direction of the}} failed engine. <b>If</b> <b>this</b> <b>had</b> happened to Concorde at supersonic speeds, it theoretically could have caused a catastrophic failure of the airframe. Although computer simulations predicted considerable problems, in practice Concorde could shut down both engines on the same side of the aircraft at Mach 2 without the predicted difficulties. During an engine failure the required air intake is virtually zero. So, on Concorde, engine failure was countered by the opening of the auxiliary spill door and the full extension of the ramps, which deflected the air downwards past the engine, gaining lift and minimising drag. Concorde pilots were routinely trained to handle double engine failure.|$|E

5|$|For {{the second}} match, Fuerza Guerrera was {{designated}} {{the captain of}} the rudo team while Heavy Metal served as {{the captain of the}} tecnico team. To win the match, a team would either pin or force the captain to submit, or pin both of the other team members. The two captains started off the match fighting each other before Rey Misterio Jr. and Psicosis quickly took over. Under the Lucha Libre rules, a tag team partner can enter the ring when the other wrestler tags out or leaves the ring, unlike normal tag team rules. At one point, Rey Misterio Jr. threw Psicosis to the outside; Psicosis then ran away from ringside to avoid falling victim to a diving attack from his opponent. Moments later, Madonna's Boyfriend entered the ring and used his superior size to throw Rey Misterio Jr. around before Latin Lover took over for him. After about 10 more minutes of wrestling, Heavy Metal missed a dive, which Fuerza Guerrera took advantage of by locking in an arm submission hold that quickly caused Heavy Metal to tap out. In Lucha Libre, submissions quickly end the first or second fall, but in this case, the end came off so quickly that the announcers questioned <b>if</b> <b>this</b> <b>had</b> turned into a best-of-three falls match. This was one clear example of how plans had changed from three falls to one right before the show.|$|E

Investigators initially believed that Urban might still have been alive when the truck reached Breitscheidplatz and might have been stabbed because he tried to stop the attack.

During his campaign Yushchenko emphasized that his being painted as a proponent of the closure of Russian schools frequently made by his opponents is entirely baseless and stated his view that the issue of school language, as well as the churches, should be left to local communities. Nevertheless, during Yuchshenko's presidency the transfer of educational institutions from Russian to Ukrainian continued.|$|E
25|$|Empedocles {{attempted}} {{to explain the}} separation of elements, the formation of earth and sea, of Sun and Moon, of atmosphere. He also dealt with the first origin of plants and animals, and with the physiology of humans. As the elements entered into combinations, there appeared strange results– heads without necks, arms without shoulders. Then as these fragmentary structures met, there were seen horned heads on human bodies, bodies of oxen with human heads, and figures of double sex. But most of these products of natural forces disappeared as suddenly as they arose; only in those rare cases where the parts {{were found to be}} adapted to each other did the complex structures last. Thus the organic universe sprang from spontaneous aggregations that suited each other as <b>if</b> <b>this</b> <b>had</b> been intended. Soon various influences reduced creatures of double sex to a male and a female, and the world was replenished with organic life. It is possible to see this theory as an anticipation of Darwin's theory of natural selection, although Empedocles was not trying to explain evolution.|$|E

25|$|In spring 1885 tension {{had been}} growing between Britain and Russia because of the Penjdeh {{incident}} in Afghanistan. This raised considerable concern in Australia of possible Russian raids on shipping, {{which could not be}} prevented by the small Australian squadron. The effect was to concentrate minds on the formation of a larger squadron financed by the colonies. Following orders from the Admiralty, Tryon argued the case that defence might best be achieved by a single strong squadron free to move around the whole area, rather than smaller squadrons paid for and attached to individual colonies. That local land forces could be provided to defend individual ports against raids, but that the best way of providing trained and up to date crews and ships for a naval force was to give the task to the Royal Navy rather than forming local ones. Colonies differed in their views on what was best, in particular New Zealand was concerned that part of the force ought permanently to be based at Auckland because of its distance from most of the others. Tryon proposed that a system of indemnity should be introduced, so that anyone whose property was destroyed resisting an attack would be compensated by the colonies as a whole, accepting that local resistance wherever it might occur was to the benefit of all. After the Russian scare had subsided, Tryon continued to assist with the development of land fortifications for major towns, emphasising the importance of preparedness in advance of any military situation arising, and of giving the impression of a united defence even <b>if</b> <b>this</b> <b>had</b> not in reality been entirely achieved.|$|E

Telford made a second bid, and <b>if</b> <b>this</b> <b>had</b> been successful, Smith would have become the club's record signing, as the eventual payment would have exceeded the £5,000 paid for Lee Moore in 2006.

He received his 10th yellow card of the season during a 1–0 defeat away to Stalybridge on 22 March 2008, resulting in a two-match suspension.

The latter source, however, is often highly unreliable, and cannot be fully trusted. The historian Archie Duncan was cautious about a date as firm and early as 1221, and wrote that Clement [...] "had entered the Dominican order by the later 1220s". Although [...] "Clement" [...] is neither a Scottish nor an English name, the large number of French-speakers in both Scotland and England during this period means that this consideration carries limited weight; indeed [...] "Clement" [...] need not even have been his birth-name. The diocese of Dunblane was entirely Gaelic-speaking in Clement's day, and in this era it was often frowned upon for a bishop to be ignorant of the language of his diocese. <b>If</b> <b>this</b> <b>had</b> been a consideration in Clement's later appointment, then this would strongly suggest that Clement was in fact a Scot. It is worth adding that Clement was later noted for his skill in languages.
