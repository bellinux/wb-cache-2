50|$|<b>Electronic</b> <b>balance,</b> or active balance, is {{achieved}} using differential amplifiers {{at each end}} of the line. An op-amp implementation of this is shown in figure 6, other circuitry is possible. Unlike transformer balance, there is no isolation of the circuitry from the line. Each of the two wires is driven by an op amp circuit which are identical except that one is inverting and one is non-inverting. Each one produces an unbalanced signal individually but together they drive the line with a symmetrical balanced signal.Because the currents in the two lines are equal and opposite, this has the further advantage that radiated signals cancel each other except in the near field of the conductors, thereby reducing cross-talk onto other conductors.|$|E

5000|$|The flavor {{creation}} {{is done by}} a specially trained scientist called a [...] "flavorist", whose job combines scientific knowledge of the chemical palette with creativity to develop new and distinctive flavors. The flavor creation begins when the flavorist receives a brief from the client. In the brief, the clients attempt to communicate exactly what type of flavor they seek, in what application it will be used, and any special requirements (e.g., must be all natural). The communication barrier can be quite difficult to overcome since most people are not experienced at describing flavors. The flavorist uses his or her knowledge of the available chemical ingredients to create a formula and compound it on an <b>electronic</b> <b>balance.</b> The flavor is then submitted to the client for testing. Several iterations, with feedback from the client, may be needed before the right flavor is found.|$|E
50|$|The classic {{laboratory}} {{method of}} measuring high level moisture in solid or semi-solid materials is {{loss on drying}} (LOD). In this technique a sample of material is weighed, heated in an oven for an appropriate period, cooled in the dry atmosphere of a desiccator, and then reweighed. If the volatile content of the solid is primarily water, the LOD technique gives a good measure of moisture content. Because the manual laboratory method is relatively slow, automated moisture analyzers have been developed that can reduce the time necessary for a test from a couple hours {{to just a few}} minutes. These analyzers incorporate an <b>electronic</b> <b>balance</b> with a sample tray and surrounding heating element. Under microprocessor control the sample can be heated rapidly and a result computed prior to the completion of the process, based on the moisture loss rate, known as a drying curve.|$|E

40|$|Background: Precise bone {{resection}} {{and appropriate}} soft tissue balancing are considered indispensable in total knee arthroplasty (TKA).

In the present study, {{a combination of both}} an accelerometer-based navigation system and an <b>electronic</b> knee <b>balancing</b> force sensor were applied to attempt to obtain optimal outcomes. Materials and Methods: An accelerometer-based navigation system and an <b>electronic</b> knee <b>balancing</b> force sensor were applied in combination in 5 TKAs. Thereafter, the incidence of radiographical outliers of the lower-extremity mechanical axis and the alignments of femoral and tibial components, and the incidence of intraoperative lateral retinacular release were evaluated and compared against those of 5 TKAs performed with the force sensor alone as a control. Results: The posterior slope of the tibia was significantly improved in the TKAs performed with the combination of both devices (P= 0. 004). No lateral release was performed in any TKAs of either group.
