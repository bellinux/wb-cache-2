40|$|This first {{worldwide}} <b>interlaboratory</b> <b>study</b> on {{the determination}} of perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) in environmental and human matrices was conducted in 2005. The main objective {{was to assess the}} betweenlaboratory reproducibility for various PFCs in a number of matrices: fish muscle tissue, freshwater, human plasma and whole blood. In addition, a standard solution and a clean fish extract were included in the study to evaluate instrumental and quantitation performance. Thirty-eight laboratories from 13 countries participated in the analysis of one or several matrices. In general, the level of agreement between the participating laboratories decreased with increasing complexity of the matrix. Relatively good agreement between the laboratories was obtained for the study standard, the fish extract, the whole blood and plasma sample. On the other hand little agreement was obtained for the fish tissue and the water sample. Extraction and clean-up showed large effects on the results for the more difficult matrices. Although much information was gained from this first <b>interlaboratory</b> <b>study,</b> a second <b>interlaboratory</b> <b>study</b> is recommended to further improve the PFC data quality.

40|$|This study {{examines}} formally {{the proposition that}} validation of analytical procedures can be best undertaken by <b>interlaboratory</b> <b>study.</b> It approaches the task by considering the fundamental nature of validation {{and the meaning of}} ‘procedure’ in relation to uncertainty. The contention is that (a) only procedures as such can be validated, (b) the results of a procedure are empirical, (c) empirical procedures are unbiased, and (d) the interlaboratory reproducibility standard deviation (SDR) associated with an unbiased procedure is an unbiased estimate of the uncertainty. The definitive <b>interlaboratory</b> <b>study</b> for estimating SDR is the collaborative trial, but the case is made that, with due caution, data from proficiency tests can also provide useful estimates of SDR and thence estimates of uncertainty...|$|E
40|$|Erythromycin is {{a mixture}} of {{macrolide}} antibiotics produced by Saccharopolyspora erythreas during fermentation. A new method for the analysis of erythromycin by liquid chromatography has previously been developed. It makes use of an Astec C 18 polymeric column.

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Aerospace EngineeringDynamic {{mechanical}} analysis (DMA) is {{the most}} preferred thermal analysis technique for determining the glass transition temperature (Tg) of polymer matrix composites {{because it is more}} sensitive to Tg measurements than other thermal analysis techniques. An <b>interlaboratory</b> <b>study</b> was developed and conducted by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) for its D 7028 - 07 test standard (Tg by DMA). The results of the study indicated that reproducibility was poor between DMA instruments and laboratories. A reproducibility standard deviation of 15. 09 degree F and 14. 72 degree F for dry Tg and wet Tg measurements, respectively, was found. Poor reproducibility of Tg measurements creates uncertainty in cases where Tg measurements are utilized. Service temperature and process control determinations may be difficult to establish if reproducibility of Tg measurements remains poor. The goal of this research was to improve laboratory-to-laboratory and instrument-to-instrument reproducibility. To accomplish this, several potential influencers of Tg measurements, such as, thermocouple positioning, dimensional variation of specimens, and temperature calibration configurations and methods were evaluated. These evaluations were the framework to the development of thermocouple guidelines and temperature calibration procedures to aid test operators in areas where the test and calibration standards are not specific. To assess whether this goal was achieved, a follow-on <b>interlaboratory</b> <b>study</b> was conducted. A reproducibility standard deviation of 7. 86 degree F and 7. 30 degree F for dry Tg and wet Tg measurements, respectively, was determined. When compared with the <b>interlaboratory</b> <b>study</b> conducted by ASTM, the follow-on <b>interlaboratory</b> <b>study</b> indicated a 50 % improvement in the reproducibility of Tg measurements was achieved with the implementation of the developed thermocouple guidelines and temperature calibration procedures...|$|E

40|$|The {{robustness}} {{testing of}} a normal-phase liquid chromatographic (LC) method for {{the determination of}} R-timolol and other related substances in S-timolol maleate was performed applying a two-level Plackett-Burman design. Two qualitative and five quantitative factors were examined. Two types of responses were considered, qualitative, i. e. chromatographic performance criteria, and quantitative ones. The latter were taken into account {{to determine if the}} analytical procedure was robust. The quantitative responses were the contents of R-timolol in two S-timolol maleate samples. Even though some significant factor effects were observed on the qualitative responses, the R-timolol contents were not significantly different from those observed at nominal conditions, which demonstrated the robustness of the procedure. Since the experiments of the Plackett-Burman design can be assimilated to laboratories in an <b>interlaboratory</b> <b>study,</b> uncertainty can be evaluated using the robustness test data. The robustness test was set-up {{in such a way that}} the required variances could be estimated.
