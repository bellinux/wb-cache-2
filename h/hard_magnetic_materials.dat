For pure <b>hard</b> <b>magnetic</b> grains in high density media with an average diameter of 5 nm and a height of 10 nm the switching probability is not sufficiently high for the use in bit-patterned media. Using a bilayer structure with 50 % <b>hard</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>material</b> with low Curie temperature and 50 % soft <b>magnetic</b> <b>material</b> with high Curie temperature to obtain more than 99. 2 % switching probability, leads to very large jitter.

50|$|Rao pioneered {{research}} {{activities in the}} area of rapid solidification, an area pertaining to the solidification of liquids at the rate of a million degrees per second, in India in the mid 1960s. Such a process leads to the formation of extensive solid solutions, metastable intermediate phases and metallic glasses. He was the first outside the United States of America to conduct research in this technologically important area. Rao discovered novel intermetallic phases and also the hitherto unexpected phases with 5-fold rotational symmetry. His interests then shifted to identifying the theoretical basis of the formation of such phases and he began to model their formation from a thermodynamic standpoint. Some of the expressions developed for the free energy of undercooled liquids are being used extensively by modellers. The techniques of rapid solidification which were once a matter of scientific curiosity have now been industrially exploited by the advanced countries in the form of novel metallic glass-based transformer core materials, fine grained high strength alloys, new <b>hard</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>materials</b> etc. Many noteworthy contributions made by Rao, his students and erstwhile colleagues at the Banaras Hindu University have brought immense recognition to India as an important centre for rapid solidification studies.|$|E

The important hard ferrites are only briefly treated. Emphasis, however, is laid on the rare earth (RE) intermetallics and the <b>hard</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>materials</b> based on them. Experimental techniques for the measurement of the basic properties of <b>hard</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>materials,</b> e. g. the ordering temperature, the magnetization, the anisotropy field, the physical and technical hysteresis loop and the properties, derived from this loop are discussed. Examples of modern permanent magnets, based on RE–cobalt alloys, on RE–Fe–B alloys and RE–Fe–nitrides, etc are explained. The principles of the production of sintered and bonded magnets are given. Finally some typical applications of these modern permanent magnets are discussed with respect to the different properties of the materials. Future developments and the possibility of superconducting permanent magnets are briefly discussed.
