40|$|Thesis Summary This thesis' {{primary concern}} is that of human {{interaction}} with <b>entertainment,</b> <b>information</b> and communication <b>technology</b> in the home. Its aim is to explore the situated realities of living with so-called ubiquitous computing technology through the study of an equivalent form of <b>technology</b> - <b>entertainment,</b> <b>information</b> and communication <b>technologies.</b> The thesis explores what <b>entertainment,</b> <b>information</b> and communication <b>technologies</b> {{are found in the}} home, how they get there and how they are incorporated into everyday life. The thesis takes an historical and theoretical look at the emergence of the ubiquitous computing paradigm and the growing interest in designing <b>entertainment,</b> <b>information</b> and communication <b>technologies</b> for the home. Through an in-depth qualitative study of five households in the UK conducted during a period of significant life-change, the thesis explores the ad-hoc nature of contemporary home ubiquitous computing environments. Using the conceptual framework of domestication theory as its starting point, the study analyzes the moral, economic, social, material and practical dimensions to owning, using and maintaining an ad-hoc <b>entertainment,</b> <b>information</b> and communication environment using specific empirical examples drawn from ethnographic data. Such an account of technology in the home provides for a necessary and contemporary view of living with ubicomp in the 21 st Century in the UK, a perspective that reveals just how involving (practically, financially and emotionally) living with technologies can actually be. As consumer interest in computing devices for gaming, communicating and information- gathering grows, ubiquitous computing visions articulated in research labs have been slow to understand the generative nature of home technology environments. The thesis provides not only empirical insights that have implications for the design of new ubiquitous computing devices and infrastructures for the home but also argues that a sociological study of the everyday realities of living with technology can provide the. field of ubiquitous computing research with the heuristic tools by which it can understand the everyday 'messiness' of technology appropriation, incorporation and use.

40|$|Computer {{ethics is}} a new branch of ethics that is growing and {{changing}} rapidly as computer technology also grows and develops. The term &quot;computer ethics &quot; is open to interpretations both broad and narrow. On the one hand, for example, computer ethics might be understood very narrowly as the efforts of professional philosophers to apply traditional ethical theories like utilitarianism, Kantianism, or virtue ethics to issues {{regarding the use of}} computer technology. On the other hand, it is possible to construe computer ethics in a very broad way to include, as well, standards of professional practice, codes of conduct, aspects of computer law, public policy, corporate ethics [...] even certain topics in the sociology and psychology of computing. In the industrialized nations of the world, the &quot;information revolution &quot; already has significantly altered many aspects of life [...] in banking and commerce, work and employment, medical care, national defense, transportation and <b>entertainment.</b> Consequently, <b>information</b> <b>technology</b> has begun to affect (in both good and bad ways) community life, family life, human relationships, education, freedom, democracy, and so on (to name a few examples).

40|$|This {{article focuses}} on the mobile phone’s {{permeation}} into ‘everyday life’ through products, knowledge and cultural processes. The convergence and blurring of industry boundaries increasingly see <b>entertainment,</b> <b>information</b> and communication <b>technologies</b> (ICTs) and lifestyle products and services combine. The possibilities that digital economies (via products and services) provide in shaping our experiences - and how others experience us - lend support to Featherstone’s comment that the ‘aestheticisation of everyday life’ has arrived. The resulting consumption is an experience economy, where {{a broad range of}} mobile phone users, with or without technical savvy, expendable income and aesthetic ambitions, can harvest from the ever-increasing palette of the digital domain. Throughout the 20 th century, visions of utopia and dystopia have often run alongside such major developments in technology, especially those that have the capacity or likelihood to transform and disturb conceptions of the everyday. Outlining a number of current states of play and future scenarios for the mobile phone in the everyday, we suggest that mobile phone analytics will shift from the utopian and dystopian towards analyses by more conventional theoretical and methodological tools and approaches found in media, cultural and policy studies, {{as well as in the}} social sciences and other disciplines. ...|$|R

A questionnaire was sent to <b>information</b> <b>technology</b> managers and experienced professionals {{in the area of}} <b>information</b> <b>technology</b> governance, who work in public organizations. Based on the collected data, we used the structural equations technique to verify the impact of the following mechanisms on the effectiveness of <b>information</b> <b>technology</b> governance: top management support; performance of the <b>information</b> <b>technology</b> steering committee; use of <b>information</b> <b>technology</b> strategic planning; performance of the <b>information</b> <b>technology</b> investment portfolio management. The study indicates that the first three mechanisms do not influence the perceived effectiveness of <b>information</b> <b>technology</b> governance in the Brazilian public sector. However, the performance of the <b>information</b> <b>technology</b> investment portfolio management has a direct and positive consequence on effectiveness; also, as a mediating variable, it significantly affects the performance of the <b>information</b> <b>technology</b> steering committee, increasing the effectiveness of Brazilian public <b>information</b> <b>technology</b> governance.
