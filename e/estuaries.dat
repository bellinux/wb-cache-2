5|$|The sand whiting is an inshore species, inhabiting exposed {{coastal areas}} such as beaches, sandbars and surf zones as well as quieter bays, <b>estuaries</b> and coastal lakes. Sand whiting enter <b>estuaries,</b> {{including}} intermittently open ones, and penetrate far upstream to the tidal limits of rivers and creeks where juveniles and adolescent fish may be abundant. The adults congregate around the mouths of <b>estuaries,</b> bars, and spits, in depths down to 5 m where they may constitute {{a large percentage of}} the icthyofauna of such regions. As implied by their name, they are often found exclusively over sandy substrates, with occasional appearances in Zostera seagrass beds. Individuals are occasionally taken in offshore waters to 40 m during winter.|$|E

40|$|The fish use {{of three}} main areas (east, west, and impounded west sections) of the Elwha <b>estuary</b> was {{assessed}} using standard seining techniques from March-September 2007. Species diversity, richness, and evenness were all highest in the connected section of the west <b>estuary</b> which constitutes only 20 % of the total Elwha <b>estuary.</b> Further, over 60 % of total fish, 90 % of salmonids, and 94 % of juvenile Chinook salmon were collected from connected west <b>estuary,.</b> Species diversity and richness of the Elwha east <b>estuary</b> and impounded west <b>estuary</b> were very similar for months both were sampled. Juvenile salmon were the same size {{in the east and}} west connected <b>estuary.</b> We theorize that sediment processes closed off fish access the majority of the east <b>estuary.</b> Migrating juvenile salmon are theorized to have responded to this closure by using the small proportion of west <b>estuary</b> left to them. These results indicate that: 1. Use of the Elwha <b>estuary</b> is complex and even fragments of connected <b>estuary</b> are critically important for migrating salmon; 2.

40|$|Graduation date: 1975 Seasonal data on tides, {{water quality}} and sediments in the Siuslaw <b>Estuary</b> were collected.

5|$|The American {{black duck}} is a habitat generalist {{as it is}} {{associated}} with tidal marshes and present throughout the year in salt marshes from the Gulf of Maine to coastal Virginia. It usually prefers freshwater and coastal wetlands throughout northeastern America, including brackish marshes, <b>estuaries</b> and edges of backwater ponds and rivers lined by speckled alder.

Populations in Vermont have also been found in glacial kettle ponds surrounded by bog mats. During winter, the American black duck mostly inhabits brackish marshes bordering bays, agricultural marshes, flooded timber, agricultural fields, <b>estuaries</b> and riverine areas.

40|$|The Blackwood River <b>estuary</b> is {{the largest}} river by flow volume in south west Australia.

This study aimed to determine {{the current state of}} the <b>estuary</b> and the dominant estuarine processes, and to make predictions about the future of the <b>estuary.</b> To fulfill the objectives of the study, field work and hydrodynamic modeling were undertaken. Initial field measurements revealed that bottom waters in the tidal river of the <b>estuary</b> were saline and low in oxygen, most likely due to low rainfall throughout the catchment in the previous six months.
