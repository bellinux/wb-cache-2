500|$|He {{directed}} Leoš Janáček's From the House of the Dead, again {{conducted by}} Boulez, first {{shown at the}} Vienna Festival in 2007, [...] and later at the <b>Holland</b> <b>Festival,</b> the Aix-en-Provence Festival, the Metropolitan Opera (his debut there in 2009) and La Scala. Chéreau's last film was Persécution (2009), [...] "a gloomy, episodic film" [...] {{about a man who}} is [...] "haunted by a love-hate relationship with his girlfriend". His last production was Elektra by Richard Strauss, conducted by Esa-Pekka Salonen, shown at the Aix-en-Provence Festival in July 2013 and scheduled for the MET's 2015–16 season. A review noted: [...] "The clichés of Fascist brutality and expressionist exaggeration are astutely avoided: this is a situation that involves human beings, not caricatures, in a visually neutral environment of bare walls, windows and doors (designed by Richard Peduzzi) which is also blackly portentous in atmosphere." ...|$|E
500|$|Berio {{described}} the main structure of Laborintus II as a [...] "catalogue, in its medieval meaning" [...] (exemplified by the Etymologies of Isodore of Seville), using Dante's themes of [...] "memory, death and usury". Members of the Dutch choir Nederlands Kamerkoor, which {{performed in the}} recording, have also cited usury as a key theme in the work, describing the composition as [...] "an indictment against the practice". Of the form, Berio wrote: [...] "Individual words and sentences are sometimes {{to be regarded as}} autonomous entities, and sometimes to be perceived as part of the sound structure as a whole." [...] The instrumentation of LaborintusII was written as an [...] "extension" [...] of the vocal material; its electronic section is likewise an extension of the instrumental music. [...] Berio used car tyres and a blow-up doll on stage in a performance of the work at the <b>Holland</b> <b>Festival</b> in 1973.|$|E
500|$|Ferrier resumed {{her career}} on 19 June 1951, in the Mass in B minor at the Royal Albert Hall. She then made her usual {{visit to the}} <b>Holland</b> <b>Festival,</b> where she gave four {{performances}} of Orfeo, and sang in Mahler's Second Symphony with Otto Klemperer and the Concertgebouw Orchestra. Through the summer her concert schedule was interspersed with hospital visits; however, she was well enough to sing at the Edinburgh Festival in September, where she performed two recitals with Walter and sang Chausson's Poème with Barbirolli and the Hallé. In November she sang Land of Hope and Glory at the reopening of Manchester's Free Trade Hall, a climax to the evening which, wrote Barbirolli, [...] "moved everyone, not least the conductor, to tears". After this, Ferrier rested for two months while she underwent radiation therapy; her only work engagement during December was a three-day recording session of folk songs at the Decca studios.|$|E

500|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} {{live at the}} <b>Holland</b> <b>Festival</b> on June18, 2010, in the Muziekgebouw aan'tIJ. The work was performed by Mike Patton and the Belgian Ictus Ensemble conducted by Georges-Elie Octors. Solos were performed by Ictus Ensemble clarinetist Dirk Descheemaeker, trumpeter Loïc Dumoulin, trombonist Michel Massot, double bass player Géry Cambier, and percussionists Michael Weilacher and Gerrit Nulens. Nederlands Kamerkoor provided the choral accompaniments. The album marks only the third recording of the composition to have been released since it was first broadcast on French radio by Office de Radiodiffusion Télévision Française. Patton has said of the work, [...] "I can listen to Berio and Nono as easily as I can to Morricone but like all modern music of Italy, it is unfortunately marginalized... Maybe because of the language barrier, maybe because it’s not easily understood. Berio, who was teaching in California when he wrote this piece, was listening to jazz, pop and folk music and incorporated all of it in his works without prejudice." ...|$|E
500|$|The Dutch {{theater company}} Toneelgroep Amsterdam {{presented}} an adaptation {{for the stage}} (in Dutch) at the <b>Holland</b> <b>Festival</b> in June 2014. The company's artistic director Ivo van Hove wrote and directed the adaptation. Ramsey Nasr starred as Howard Roark, with Halina Reijn as Dominique Francon. After its debut the production went on tour, appearing in Barcelona, Spain, in early July 2014 and at the Festival d'Avignon in France later that month. The play appeared at the Odéon-Théâtre de l'Europe in Paris in November 2016. The four-hour production used video projections to show close-ups of the actors and Roark's drawings, as well as backgrounds of the New York skyline. The Festival d'Avignon production received several positive notices, including reviews from the French newspapers La Croix, Les Échos, and Le Monde, {{as well as from}} the English newspaper The Guardian, whose reviewer described it as [...] "electrifying theatre". The French magazine Télérama gave the Avignon production a negative review, calling the source material inferior and complaining about the use of video screens on the set, while another French magazine, , complimented the staging and acting of the Odéon production.|$|E
