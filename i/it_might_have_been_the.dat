5|$|The {{origin of}} the jockey {{creature}} was not explored in the film, but Scott later theorized that <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> ship's pilot, and that the ship {{might have been a}} weapons-carrier capable of dropping alien eggs onto a planet so that the aliens could use the local lifeforms as hosts. In early versions of the script, the eggs were to be located in a separate pyramid structure which would be found later by the Nostromo crew and would contain statues and hieroglyphs depicting the alien reproductive cycle, contrasting the human, alien, and space jockey cultures. Cobb, Foss, and Giger each created concept artwork for these sequences, but they were eventually discarded due to budgetary concerns and the need to make the film shorter. Instead, the egg chamber was set inside the derelict ship and was filmed on the same set as the space-jockey scene; the entire disc piece supporting the jockey and its chair were removed and the set was re-dressed to create the egg chamber. Light effects in the egg chamber were created by lasers borrowed from English rock band The Who. The band was testing the lasers for use in their stage show on the sound-stage next door.|$|E

25|$|The {{next two}} decades were a time of steady growth and {{prestige}} for Alpha Epsilon Pi, {{as well as other}} fraternities. Expansion was occurring at an incredible rate for the Greek system as a whole. However, with the onset of fighting in Vietnam in the early 1960s, fraternity life faltered. Liberal student bodies revolted against authority and the Greek system, which was seen as a conservative, elitist group. Membership plummeted and nearly half the chapter roll was lost.

In his autobiography, I, Me Mine, he recalls working on the melody on a piano, while Paul McCartney carried out overdubs in a neighbouring studio at London's Abbey Road Studios.

500|$|Secretary McAdoo had {{originally}} rejected the submissions. Acting Mint Director Mary M. O'Reilly wrote to Philadelphia Mint Superintendent Adam M. Joyce on June 24, 1918, relaying the Treasury Secretary's concerns. McAdoo [...] "specifically direct" [...] that the Illinois state motto be deleted from the scroll in the eagle's beak on the reverse, {{to be replaced}} with the national one. Joyce was told to follow {{the provisions of the}} Coinage Act of 1873 requiring that on one side there be the word LIBERTY, a design emblematic of it, and the year of striking, with the other side an eagle with the name of the country and the denomination of the coin. Despite McAdoo's order, the Illinois inscription was retained on the scroll.

500|$|After a {{long series}} of delays, Friendship 7 lifted off from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station on February 20, 1962. There were eleven delays during the {{countdown}} due to equipment malfunctions, improvements to equipment functioning properly and the weather. During Glenn's first orbit, a failure of the automatic-control system was detected. This forced Glenn to operate in manual mode for the second and third orbits, and for re-entry. Later in the flight, telemetry indicated that the heat shield had loosened. If this reading were accurate, Glenn and his spacecraft would burn up on re-entry. After a lengthy discussion {{on how to deal with}} this problem, ground controllers decided that leaving the solid-fueled retrorocket pack in place might help keep the loose heat shield in place. They relayed these instructions to Glenn, but did not tell him that the heat shield was possibly loose; although confused at this order, he complied. Leaving the retrorocket pack on made large chunks of flaming debris fly past the window of his capsule during re-entry, which Glenn thought <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> heat shield. He told an interviewer, [...] "Fortunately it was the rocket pack—or I wouldn't be answering these questions." [...] After the flight, it was determined that the heat shield was not loose, but rather that the sensor was faulty.|$|E

500|$|Joseph McCabe of Nerdist stated on the episode, [...] "This week’s Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. is so {{good that}} it leaves me {{in a state of}} pessimism. Because I can’t see any way to follow it up that gives a {{satisfying}} resolution to the story it so beautifully presents." [...] He called it [...] "one of the very finest episodes S.H.I.E.L.D. has given us, {{and one of the few}} a viewer with almost no prior knowledge of the show can fully appreciate", and praised the handling of Simmons' and Daniels' relationship, saying that Henstridge and Casey [...] "complement one another marvelously". Discussing the episode for Vox, Caroline Framke called it [...] "astonishing", praising the decision to dedicate an episode to Simmons' ordeal rather than just reveal it through flashbacks in [...] "normal" [...] episodes, as well as the efforts of Bochco, Titley, and Henstridge, and the use of the [...] "sinister" [...] on-screen hour counter. Also reviewing the episode for Den of Geek, Marc Buxton scored it 4.5 stars out 5, calling it [...] "the most experimental episode of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. to date, and ... <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> finest hour of the series so far". Buxton felt that the episode retroactively improved the earlier season three episodes, which he had called [...] "anticlimactic" [...] due to their handling of Simmons' storyline, and praised Henstridge's performance. He also positively compared the episode's villain, which he described as [...] "hard to grasp, mysterious, and ever present", to [...] "the best Steven Moffat Doctor Who villains".|$|E

2500|$|William Hayes Ward (1910) {{discovered}} that symbols {{similar to the}} classical caduceus sometimes appeared on Mesopotamian cylinder seals.

Frothingham incorporated Dr. Ward's research into his own work, published in 1916, in which he suggested that the prototype of Hermes was an [...] "Oriental deity of Babylonian extraction" [...] represented in his earliest form as a snake god. From this perspective, the caduceus was originally representative of Hermes himself, in his early form as the Underworld god Ningishzida, [...] "messenger" [...] of the [...] "Earth Mother".|$|E

2500|$|The {{monument}} has {{its original}} entrance {{at the northern}} side and contains three chambers: at the top, the burial chamber of the king (king's chamber), in the middle, the statue chamber (erroneously called queen's chamber), and an unfinished subterranean chamber (underworld chamber) under {{the foundation of the}} pyramid. Whilst the burial chamber is identified by its large sarcophagus made of granite, the use of the [...] "queen's chamber" [...] is still disputed – <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> serdab of the Ka-statue of Khufu. The subterranean chamber remains mysterious. It was left unfinished; a tight corridor heading south at the western end of the chamber and an unfinished shaft at the eastern middle might point out that the subterranean chamber was the eldest of the three chambers and that the original building plan contained a simple chamber complex with several rooms and corridors. But for some unknown reasons the works were stopped and two further chambers had been built inside the pyramid. Remarkable is the so-called Great Gallery leading to the king's chamber: It has a niched ceiling and measures 28.7ft in height and 151.3ft in length. The gallery has an important static function, it diverts the weight of the stone masses above the king's chamber into the surrounding pyramid core.|$|E

Carrie Battan of The Boston Globe viewed that [...] "the album’s real sweet spots lie somewhere in the brief, breezy middle ground" [...] between [...] "angsty rap-metal crossover tracks" [...] and [...] "clubby, bass-thumping radio-rap jams". The A.V. Clubs Kyle Ryan gave the album a B- and commented that its synthesizers [...] " [...] it an au courant hip-hop sound", but criticized its lyrics and called it [...] "schizophrenic". Steve Jones of USA Today gave the album {{three out of four}} stars and wrote that it [...] "has several shining moments but falls short of the overall excellence" [...] of his previous albums.

Jon Caramanica of The New York Times expressed a mixed response towards its music and called Lasers [...] "a chaotic album full of gummy rhymes that look better on the page than they sound to the ear, delivered with a tone of tragic bombast". Slant Magazine's Matthew Cole perceived [...] "no bridging the gap between Laserss radical message and its utterly conventional sound", commenting that [...] "In moments of dazzling clarity, Lupe spits hip-hop prophecy, but too much of Lasers is given over to self-serious jeremiads on race, rap, and politics, or pop-rap pandering".|$|E
