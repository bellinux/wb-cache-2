5|$|In {{his book}} King Solomon's Ring, Konrad Lorenz {{described}} and analysed the complex social interactions {{in a western}} jackdaw flock that lived around his house in Altenberg, Austria. He ringed them for identification and caged them in the winter to prevent their annual migration. He found that the birds have a linear <b>hierarchical</b> <b>group</b> structure, with higher-ranked individuals dominating lower-ranked birds, and pair-bonded birds sharing the same rank. Young males establish their individual status before pairing with females. Upon pairing, the female assumes the same social position as her partner. Unmated females are the lowest members in the pecking order, and are the last {{to have access to}} food and shelter. Lorenz noted one case in which a male, absent during the dominance struggles and pair bondings, returned to the flock, became the dominant male, and chose one of two unpaired females for a mate. This female immediately assumed a dominant position in the social hierarchy and demonstrated this by pecking others. According to Lorenz, the most significant factor in social behaviour was the immediate and intuitive grasp of the new hierarchy by each of the western jackdaws in the flock.|$|E

25|$|The Imperial Harem (Harem-i Hümayûn) {{occupied}} one of {{the sections}} of the private apartments of the sultan; it contained more than 400 rooms.

The harem consists of a series of buildings and structures, connected through hallways and courtyards.

40|$|Automatic road {{centerline}} extraction from high-resolution {{satellite imagery}} has gained considerable interest recently {{due to the}} increasing availability of commercial high-resolution satellite images. In this paper, a <b>hierarchical</b> <b>grouping</b> strategy is proposed to automatically extract main road centerlines from high-resolution satellite imagery. Here <b>hierarchical</b> <b>grouping</b> means that, instead of grouping all segments at once, the selective segments are grouped gradually, and multiple clues are closely integrated into the procedure. By this means, the computational cost can be reduced significantly. Through the stepwise grouping, the detected fragmented line segments eventually form the long main road lines. The proposed method has been tested and validated using several Ikonos and QuickBird images both in open areas and build-up urban environments. The results demonstrate its robustness and viability on extracting salient main road centerlines...|$|R
40|$|Organizations {{that are}} {{characterized}} by vertical authority structures, where decisions are made and implemented through a clear chain-of-command, are commonly seen as less responsive, less innovative, and less dynamic than organizations that have authority distributed more horizontally. This study takes aim at this presumption by miniaturizing authority structures {{to the level of}} the group, where group process theory can be marshaled to predict, measure, and assess outcomes for group innovation in an experimental setting. Using status theory, I propose that <b>hierarchical</b> <b>groups</b> will be more rather than less innovative than egalitarian groups. I conduct an experimental test by manipulating hierarchy in groups instructed to complete a common task, with outcomes mapped to innovative performance. Findings show that <b>hierarchical</b> <b>groups</b> are actually no more, and no less, innovative than egalitarian groups. Irrespective of authority structure, innovation appears to be most likely in groups in which a clear leader emerges who makes others in the group feel like her equal during group interaction. Other findings are presented to explain the apparent no-effect of authority structure on innovation. I will show that status processes advantage each type of group differently with respect to innovation. <b>Hierarchical</b> <b>groups</b> are advantaged by the presence of a clear leader; egalitarian groups are advantaged by the participative interaction that comes naturally to status peers. But the two conditions must occur together to maximize the likelihood for innovation, and this poses a problem for groups who seek to innovate, because status dynamics that promote one of the conditions undercut the status dynamics that promote the other. In egalitarian groups, when authority seekers try to take charge and lead, participative interaction is endangered because members resent the status move. In <b>hierarchical</b> <b>groups,</b> when higher ranking members act participatively, group leadership is contested because others feel empowered to take charge. Each group type therefore faces a dilemma of participative leadership, and because the dilemma is reversed across group types, the net effect of authority structure on innovation is no apparent effect. Implications of the findings for theory and practice are discussed...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} Flower menu, a {{new type}} of Marking menu that does not only support straight, but also curved gestures for any of the 8 usual orientations. Flower menus make it possible to put many commands at each menu level and thus to create as large a hierarchy as needed for common applications. Indeed our informal analysis of menu breadth in popular applications shows that a quarter of them have more than 16 items. Flower menus can easily contain 20 items and even more (theoretical maximum of 56 items). Flower menus also support within groups as well as <b>hierarchical</b> <b>groups.</b> They can thus favor breadth organization (within groups) or depth organization (<b>hierarchical</b> <b>groups)</b> : as a result, the designers can lay out items in a very flexible way in order to reveal meaningful item groupings.
