When questioned about his views on life after death, {{he wrote in his}} 1905 autobiography, As to the future state, the teachings of our tribe were not specific, that is, we had no definite idea of our relations and surroundings in after life. We believed that there is a life after this one, but no one ever told me as to what part of man lived after death... We held that the discharge of one's duty would make his future life more pleasant, but whether that future life was worse than this life or better, we did not know, and no one was able to tell us. We hoped that in the future life, family and tribal relations would be resumed. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>we</b> believed this, but we did not know it.|$|E

500|$|Although {{the use of}} MotionScan was {{critically}} acclaimed for its highly realistic capture of faces, it was criticised for its inability to capture body movements. Many players considered that characters are [...] "dead from the neck down". Game director Brendan McNamara attributed this to players' expectations of realism; [...] "people expect to see clothes moving {{and the rest of}} the body moving <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>we</b> can't replicate in video games," [...] he said. [...] "We would have loved to have spent more time on fine-tuning that for L.A. Noire but it wasn't feasible due to the scope of the scripting and talent involved," [...] said Bao.|$|E
500|$|An {{interview}} with actress Kristin Chenoweth, who was originally cast as Rapunzel, reveals {{that at some}} point Rapunzel was intended to be a squirrel. As directors, Greno and Howard felt it essential that Rapunzel resemble a less [...] "passive" [...] heroine than the way she is depicted in the original fairy tale. [...] "We knew we were making this movie for a contemporary audience and we wanted Rapunzel to be a real role model <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way.</b> <b>We</b> wanted all this girl power and to really drive this story, so she doesn't wait around for anything ... she's a smart girl, she has these hopes and dreams and she's going to get what she wants out of life." [...] Tangleds production was surrounded by rumors that it would be Disney's last princess film.|$|E
500|$|On August 28, 1974, Louis Peraino of Bryanston {{agreed to}} {{distribute}} the film worldwide, from which Bozman and Skaaren would receive $225,000 (about $ inflation-adjusted) and 35% of the profits. Years later Bozman stated, [...] "We {{made a deal with}} the devil, , and I guess that, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way,</b> <b>we</b> got what we deserved." [...] They signed the contract with Bryanston and, after the investors recouped their money (with interest),—and after Skaaren, the lawyers, and the accountants were paid—only $8,100 (about $ inflation-adjustedn) was left to be divided among the 20 cast and crew members. Eventually the producers sued Bryanston for failing to pay them their full percentage of the box office profits. A court judgment instructed Bryanston to pay the filmmakers $500,000 (about $ inflation-adjusted), but by then the company had declared bankruptcy. In 1983 New Line Cinema acquired the distribution rights from Bryanston and gave the producers a larger share of the profits.|$|E

500|$|The German word [...] "Achtung" [...] (...) in {{the album}} title {{translates}} into English as [...] "attention" [...] or [...] "watch out". U2's sound engineer Joe O'Herlihy {{used the phrase}} [...] "achtung baby" [...] during recording, reportedly taking it from the Mel Brooks film The Producers. The title was selected in August 1991 {{near the end of}} the album sessions. According to Bono, it was an ideal title, as it was attention-grabbing, referenced Germany, and hinted at either romance or birth, both of which were themes on the album. The band was determined not to highlight the seriousness of the lyrics and instead sought to [...] "erect a mask", a concept that was further developed on the Zoo TV Tour, particularly through characters such as [...] "The Fly". Of the title, Bono said in 1992, [...] "It's a con, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way.</b> <b>We</b> call it Achtung Baby, grinning up our sleeves in all the photography. But it's probably the heaviest record we've ever made... It tells you a lot about packaging, because the press would have killed us if we'd called it anything else." ...|$|E
500|$|Responding to {{criticism}} that accused the character's bodies of being lifeless, despite the game's use of motion capture, Brendan McNamara, the game's director and writer, stated {{in an interview}} with Eurogamer, [...] "People were saying people were dead from the neck down. That's because we had all this animation in the neck and all this animation in the face, but the clothes don't move. Once you get to the level that people can actually see that level of realism, then people expect to see clothes moving {{and the rest of the}} body moving <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>we</b> can't replicate in video games." [...] In the same interview McNamara also responded to queries about why Phelps sometimes responds with particularly aggressive lines of dialogue during interrogation scenes. [...] "It's funny. A lot of people say Aaron turns into a psycho. When we originally wrote the game the questions you asked were coax, force and lie. It was actually force because it was a more aggressive answer. That's the way we recorded it. But when the game came out it was truth, doubt or lie. Everyone always says Aaron on the second question is a psycho. So that's not his fault." ...|$|E
500|$|Apart from {{a change}} in musical style, the band changed the way they recorded. [...] "It {{was the first time}} we sort of jammed," [...] Coxon revealed. [...] "We've never really jammed before. We've been quite white-coaty, overall about recording, like in a laboratory. Yeah, we did {{actually}} feel our way through just playing whatever came to our minds and editing, which was really exciting." [...] "We just played together for two weeks <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>we</b> hadn't done since 1991," [...] Dave recalls. [...] "We wanted to purify the sound, to not have anything there not played by us. We reasoned that if we made small changes at the input end, we could effect large changes in the output." [...] According to producer Stephen Street, [...] "Blur had decided that commercial pressures and writing hit singles wasn't going to be the main consideration any more. The mood in the studio was very different to when I'd first worked with them." [...] "In the studio, once we got past those first few days, where I felt everyone was treading on eggshells, there was a great atmosphere. I think it was because they didn't want to be competing with anyone on this record, they wanted to make a record that would help keep the band together." [...] Street had acquired a new piece of hardware, described as [...] "muso-ish to talk about but really useful" [...] which enabled him to sample loops and otherwise cut-and-paste entire sections of the band's jam sessions.|$|E

Galbraith of Otaku2.com {{compared}} {{the design of}} OZ to Takashi Murakami's artwork, specifically [...] "the flatness, or slick, polished surfaces" [...] and then contrasted them with the sequences in Nagano noting, [...] "it has a warm and lived in feel to it, aided by a scrupulous attention to detail." [...] Of the story and characters Galbraith wrote that [...] "scenes such as the large family coming together and talking over dinner are heartwarming and hilarious." [...] and {{compared the}} movie to [...] "a moving picture book, a family photo album turned back a few decades." [...] He also noted the audience response, reporting sold-out screenings two nights in a row, and highlighting handwritten notes left at the theater by [...] "hoardes of fans who on the spot {{decided to move to}} Nagano" [...] In conclusion, Galbraith wrote [...] "there is an innocence and purity to this work that really reminds [...] of Miyazaki Hayao and Studio Ghibli back in the day, and the stellar backgrounds invoke Shinkai Makoto." [...] Justin Sevakis of Anime News Network gave the film an 'A' rating and wrote that [...] "decades from now, Summer Wars will be seen as the official arrival of [...] Mamoru Hosoda into the realm of historically important anime directors." [...] He called the film [...] "a near-perfect blend of social satire and science fiction, at once timely and timeless, sardonic and optimistic." [...] and noted that the film is [...] "practically overflowing with sharp social insight <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>we</b> have not seen from anime in years." [...] Sevakis praised Yoshiyuki Sadamoto's character designs and highlighted the visuals as [...] "sharp and consistently great". In summing the film up he called Summer Wars [...] "Incredibly entertaining, and intriguingly intelligent. Accessible and fast-paced. Pretty much perfect." [...] Similarities have been commented on between the film and a previous work of Hosoda, [...] Neo magazine has stated that Our War Game is [...] "plainly a prototype" [...] of Summer Wars.|$|E
2500|$|In Japan, in {{the early}} 1960s, a toy called Dakkochan became hugely popular. Dakkochan was a black child with large red lips and a grass skirt. There were boy and girl dolls, with the girls being {{distinguished}} by a bow. The black skin of the dolls {{was said to have}} been significant and in-line with the rising popularity of jazz. Novelist Tensei Kawano went as far as to state, [...] "We of the younger generation are outcasts from politics and society. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>we</b> are like Negroes, who have a long record of oppression and misunderstanding, and we feel akin to them." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{painting}} was rehung in a new, wider frame in 2002; {{according to the}} NGV conservators this was in line with Roberts' original frame, which had been trimmed down {{over the years as}} framing fashion changed. In 2006, the NGV began a major restoration of the picture, the first in over 80 years. The painting had slowly lost its cover as the natural resin used in the previous restoration gradually degraded. The restoration revealed much of Roberts' original colour palette as well as background details previously not recognised. After the {{painting was}} cleaned, Lane claimed that he [...] "could see the way the space and light flowed across the back reaches of the shearing shed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>we</b> really hadn't been aware of before."

[...] The site of the decisive battle against the Echthroi in A Wind in the Door, it serves to demonstrate L'Engle's premise that variations in size [...] "are in reality, quite unimportant," [...] as Blajeny states in the book; and that macrocosm and microcosm are both part of the interdependence of everything in the Cosmos. [...] "If a butterfly winging over the fields around Crosswicks should be hurt, the effect would be felt in galaxies thousands of light years away," [...] L'Engle says in A Stone for a Pillow. [...] "The interrelationship of all of Creation is sensitive <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>we</b> are just beginning to understand."

Jerry Atkins stated [...] "What happened was so tragic and for many of us who lived through it, the frustration and sadness will always be there." [...] Mrs. Brown said, [...] "I trust the men who are handling the investigation into my daughter's death. I'm sure they'll find who ever did it. If he is caught, I would like to kill him.

2500|$|Bill Gibron of PopMatters {{believes}} that the song [...] "proved that the pen and ink designs that drove the company for nearly 80 years could transcend the genre and turn into something seminal ... something special ... something sensational." [...] The ballroom sequence continues {{to be held in}} high regard as one of Disney's crowning achievements. Famous for successfully combining volumetric depth with dancing animated characters, the scene is now revered by film critics as a classic, groundbreaking and iconic moment in animation history, responsible for [...] "chang the game" [...] of contemporary animation. Gaye Birch of Den of Geek pegged the scene as a Disney landmark because its accomplishments were [...] "visually impressive <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>we</b> hadn't experienced in a Disney movie before". Huw Evans of Bournemouth University hailed the scene as [...] "quite possibly the best piece of animation done on any feature film." [...] On the sequence's pioneering use of computer-generated imagery, Annie Ellingson of Paste wrote that the ballroom was [...] "innovative at the time for compositing hand-drawn characters on a computer-generated backdrop to enable dramatic sweeping camera moves." [...] Similarly, Empires Helen O'Hara {{believes that}} the scene [...] "paved the way for the new digital style of animation." [...] Mike Scott of The Times-Picayune holds the scene responsible for the subsequent success of Pixar' computer-animated films, concluding that [...] "the warm reaction to that single scene would serve as a major springboard for the computer-animation industry -- and a major blow to hand-drawn animation." [...] In his 1995 review of Toy Story, film critic Roger Ebert encouraged audiences to re-watch Beauty and the Beasts ballroom sequence to better understand the newer computer-animated film's technology. According to Moving Innovation: A History of Computer Animation author Tom Vito, the scene [...] "made many skeptics in Hollywood begin to look at CG seriously," [...] inspiring formerly [...] "hostile" [...] studio executives to pursue the new art form. Additionally, the scene is also appreciated as a dance sequence. The Houston Press Adam Castaneda extolled it as [...] "one of the finest dance sequences in the history of film." [...] In 2012, architect Mehruss Jon Ahi and filmmaker Armen Karaoghlanian designed an accurate floorplan of the ballroom, which was published in the Daily Mail. The golden ballgown Belle wears in the scene is now revered as iconic, with Vogue ranking it among the most famous dresses in history.|$|E
