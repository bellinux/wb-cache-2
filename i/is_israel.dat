500|$|Harold Pinter {{earned a}} {{reputation}} for being notoriously pugnacious, enigmatic, taciturn, terse, prickly, explosive and forbidding. Pinter's blunt political statements, and the award of the Nobel Prize in Literature, elicited strong criticism and even, at times, provoked ridicule and personal attacks. [...] The historian Geoffrey Alderman, author of the official history of Hackney Downs School, expressed his own [...] "Jewish View" [...] of Harold Pinter: [...] "Whatever his merit as a writer, actor and director, on an ethical plane Harold Pinter seems to me to have been intensely flawed, and his moral compass deeply fractured." [...] David Edgar, writing in The Guardian, defended Pinter against what he termed Pinter's [...] "being berated by the belligerati" [...] like Johann Hari, who felt that he did not [...] "deserve" [...] to win the Nobel Prize. [...] Later Pinter continued to campaign against the Iraq War and on behalf of other political causes that he supported. [...] As Alderman points out, for example, Pinter signed the mission statement of Jews for Justice for Palestinians in 2005 and its full-page advertisement, [...] "What <b>Is</b> <b>Israel</b> Doing? A Call by Jews in Britain", published in The Times on 6 July 2006, and he was a patron of the Palestine Festival of Literature.|$|E

2500|$|A Midrash {{taught that}} God {{instructed}} Moses {{to cause a}} lamp to burn in the Tabernacle not because God needed the light, but so that the Israelites {{might be able to}} give light to God as God gave light to the Israelites. The Midrash likened this to the case of a man who could see, walking along with a blind man. The seeing man offered to guide the blind man. When they came home, the seeing man asked the blind man to kindle a lamp for him and illumine his path, so that the blind man would no longer be obliged to the seeing man for having accompanied the blind man on the way. The seeing man of the story is God, for 2 Chronicles [...] and [...] say, [...] "For the eyes of the Lord run to and fro throughout the whole earth."

God illumined the way for the Israelites (after they stumbled with the Calf) and led them, as [...] says, [...] "And the Lord went before them by day." [...] And then when the Israelites were about to construct the Tabernacle, God called to Moses and asked him in [...] "that they bring to you pure olive oil." ...|$|E

6000|$|The natural Theology of {{the future}} must take count of these {{tremendous}} and even painful facts. She may take count of them. For Scripture has taken count of them already. It talks continually--it has been blamed for talking so much--of races; of families; of their wars, their struggles, their exterminations; of races favoured, of races rejected; of remnants being saved, to continue the race; of hereditary tendencies, hereditary excellencies, hereditary guilt. Its sense of the reality and importance of descent is so intense, that it speaks of a whole tribe or a whole family {{by the name of}} its common ancestor; and the whole nation of the Jews <b>is</b> <b>Israel,</b> to the end. And if I be told this is true of the Old Testament, but not of the New: I must answer,--What? Does not St Paul hold the identity of the whole Jewish race with Israel their forefather, as strongly as any prophet of the Old Testament? And what is the central historic fact, save One, of the New Testament, but the conquest of Jerusalem; the dispersion, all but destruction of a race, not by miracle, but by invasion, because found wanting when weighed in the stern balances of natural and social law? ...|$|E

But the Israel under {{consideration}} in the text, <b>is</b> <b>Israel</b> after God, or the Spirit; hence they are called 'the Israel of God,' because they are made so of him, not by generation, nor by fancy, but by Divine power (Can 6:16). And thus {{was the first of}} this name made so, 'Thy name shall be called no more Jacob but Israel' (Gen 32:28). This then is the man concerned in the text, 'Let Israel hope in the Lord'; to wit, Israel that is so of God's making, and of God's allowance: for men are not debarred from calling themselves after this most godly name, provided they are so indeed; all that is dangerous is, when men shall think this privilege comes by carnal generation, or that their fancying of themselves to be such will bear them out in the day of judgment. Otherwise, if men become the true servants of God by Christ, they have, as I said, an allowance so to subscribe themselves. 'One shall say, I am the Lord's and another shall call himself by the name of Jacob, and another shall subscribe with his hand unto the Lord, and surname himself by the name of Israel' (Isa 44:5). But then, for the further describing of such, they must be men of circumcised and tender hearts; they must be such 'which worship God in the spirit, and that rejoice in Christ Jesus, and that have no confidence in the flesh' (Phil 3:3), for these are the Nathaniels, the Israelites indeed in whom there is no guile (John 1:47), and these are they that are intended in the exhortation, when he saith, 'Let Israel hope in the Lord.' ...|$|E
