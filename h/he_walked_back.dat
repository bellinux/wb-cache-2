25|$|Prior to European settlement, Noongar Aboriginal of the Mooro tribe {{had lived}} {{in what has become}} the {{northern}} Perth metropolitan region for more than 40,000 years, taking advantage of the abundant food and water around the chain of wetlands on the Swan Coastal Plain. According to local legend, Pipidinny Swamp, located in eastern Eglinton, was created from the blood and meat of the crocodile's tail as <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>back</b> towards the Swan River after his fight with the shark.|$|E
25|$|The 1965 Southern 500 at Darlington Raceway {{was one of}} {{the wildest}} races in NASCAR history. Rookie driver Buren Skeen died after two cars ran into the side of his car in the early laps. Sam McQuagg was leading the race, when Cale Yarborough tried to muscle past McQuagg for the lead. Yarborough flew over the guardrail, rolled around six times, and ended {{up at the end of}} the parking lot by a light post. Yarborough waved to the crowd as <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>back</b> to the pits. A video clip of the wreck was used on ABC's Wide World of Sports for several years. With 44 laps left, Fred Lorenzen and Darel Dieringer were {{fighting}} for the lead far ahead of Jarrett. Lorenzen's motor expired, and even before he could get into the pits Dieringer's motor started smoking too. Dieringer continued at a slower pace to finish third. The race was won by Ned Jarrett by 14 laps and 2 car lengths or 19.25 miles, which is the farthest margin of victory in NASCAR history (in terms of miles).|$|E
25|$|Pietersen {{played in}} the first Test against India {{and in the first}} innings, he made 37 but not without controversy. He edged the ball behind of Zaheer Khan to Dhoni. He walked, but after seeing replays on the screen, <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>back</b> to the middle and the {{decision}} was overturned. Ironically, he was out shortly afterwards caught Dhoni, bowled Khan. In the second innings he was top scorer with a knock of 134 to set up a potential England victory. Pietersen described this as his best century, in very testing conditions. In the second test, he was twice lbw to RP Singh for 13 and 19 in a defeat which subsequently cost them the series. After making 41 in the first innings, Pietersen scored his 10th Test century in the third and final Test at the Oval, helping England to draw the game with 101. In the one-day series that followed, he struggled at the start with a top score of 33 not out in the first five matches of the series. He scored two half-centuries in the final matches including 71 not out in the final match at Lord's, hitting the winning runs to give England the series.|$|E

500|$|During a 1990 on-field brawl, West {{attempted}} {{to break up}} the fight by throwing Phillies pitcher Dennis Cook to the ground. The matter ultimately was handled among West, NL President Bill White, then-Commissioner Fay Vincent and the umpires union. West said White supported his actions in the brawl, but White quickly issued a statement saying he had prohibited West from making further physical contact with players. White was reported to have nearly resigned due to lack of support from Vincent, but the NL president remained in his post after receiving support from league owners. West met more controversy the next year when Chicago Cubs outfielder Andre Dawson bumped him after a called third strike during a game at Wrigley Field. After Dawson was ejected from the game, <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>back</b> to the dugout and tossed 14 bats onto the field. Chicago fans threw debris onto the field, causing a delay in the game. Dawson received a one-game suspension and a $1,000 fine. On his check to the league, Dawson wrote [...] "donation for the blind." ...|$|E
500|$|On June 7, 1977, Bundy was transported [...] {{from the}} Garfield County jail in Glenwood Springs to Pitkin County Courthouse in Aspen for a {{preliminary}} hearing. He had elected {{to serve as}} his own attorney, and as such, was excused by the judge from wearing handcuffs or leg shackles. During a recess he asked to visit the courthouse's law library to research his case. Concealed behind a bookcase, he opened a window and jumped from the second story, spraining his right ankle as he landed. After shedding an outer layer of clothing he walked through Aspen as roadblocks were being set up on its outskirts, then hiked southward onto Aspen Mountain. Near its summit he broke into a hunting cabin and stole food, clothing, and a rifle. The following day he left the cabin and continued south toward the town of Crested Butte, but became lost in the forest. For two days he wandered aimlessly on the mountain, missing two trails that led downward to his intended destination. On June 10, he broke into a camping trailer on Maroon Lake, [...] south of Aspen, taking food and a ski parka; but instead of continuing southward, <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>back</b> north toward Aspen, eluding roadblocks and search parties along the way. Three days later, he stole a car {{at the edge of}} Aspen Golf Course. Cold, sleep-deprived, and in constant pain from his sprained ankle, he drove back into Aspen, where two police officers noticed his car weaving in and out of its lane and pulled him over. He had been a fugitive for six days. In the car were maps of the mountain area around Aspen that prosecutors were using to demonstrate the location of Caryn Campbell's body (as his own attorney, Bundy had rights of discovery), indicating that his escape was not a spontaneous act, but had been planned.|$|E

5000|$|The term [...] "bucket brigade" [...] is {{also used}} for a certain method of {{organizing}} manual order picking in distribution centers.

2500|$|In cricketing parlance, {{the word}} [...] "chinaman" [...] {{is used to}} {{describe}} the stock delivery of a left-arm [...] "unorthodox" [...] spin bowler (though some reserve it for the googly delivery [...] ). The origin of the term is uncertain. One version relates to a Test match played between England and the West Indies at Old Trafford in 1933. Ellis [...] "Puss" [...] Achong, a player of Chinese origin, was a left-arm orthodox spinner, playing for the West Indies. He had Walter Robins stumped off a surprise delivery that spun into the right-hander from outside the off stump. As <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>back</b> to the pavilion, Robins reportedly said to the umpire, [...] "fancy being done by a bloody Chinaman!", leading to the popularity of the term in England, and subsequently, {{in the rest of the}} world. However, it has been suggested that the term originated earlier than this, in Yorkshire.|$|E
2500|$|Near Deraa a {{captured}} British airman who {{had been}} a prisoner of the Ottoman Empire was liberated: [...] "Two British airmen of No. 144 Squadron, captured by the Turks on September 17, marched with their captors in the retreat from Es Salt. They were found later near Deraa with a wounded light horseman, whom they had carried or pushed in a cart from Mafrak to Deraa. They described the ghastly terror of the retreat under constant bomb–attacks from Es Salt to Mafrak; they had no food rations issued to them after leaving Amman, where the Turks, they said, abandoned all stores and all further desire to fight. They left Deraa in a Turkish train; at a destroyed part of the line the train ahead of them ran off the rails, and their own train collided with it. Only one of the airmen had strength enough to escape. <b>He</b> <b>walked</b> <b>back</b> to Deraa to get help, and there found the British cavalry." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the second}} to last game of the 1910 season, a {{scoreless}} tie with the University of Pennsylvania, Wells made his second start as an end. [...] It appeared Wells had scored the winning touchdown, but the play was called back. [...] The 1911 Michiganensian described the play this way: [...] "'Shorty' McMillan sent 'Stan' Wells down the side lines. [...] Then the Michigan team opened up and Bill Edmunds was given the ball. [...] Bill stepped back and sent a beautiful long pass to 'Stan' Wells. [...] The pigskin came sailing through the air on a perfect line, Wells grabbed it and ran for a touchdown. [...] Instantly the small Michigan rooting contingent rose as one man and cheered until their voices failed. [...] Then Umpire Crowell asked for the ball. [...] It was handed him, and <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>back</b> to {{where it had been}} put in play and told the Michiganders to start anew. [...] Wells had stepped out of bounds for an instant, just as he received the ball." ...|$|E

2500|$|One Fw 189 survives today.

Approximately 31 minutes after taking off, V7+1H was attacked by Lend-Lease-acquired Soviet Hawker Hurricane fighters. The aircraft dived to escape the fighters, but owing to damage already suffered, could not pull out in time, and it struck the treetops. The tail was torn off, and the crew nacelle left hanging upside down within the trees. The pilot, Lothar Mothes, survived but one crewman was killed in the crash and the third died from blood loss {{as a result of a}} severed leg. Incredibly, Mothes was able to survive two weeks in sub-zero temperatures, evading Soviet patrols while eating bark and grubs as <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>back</b> to his base. Mothes spent the next nine months in a hospital recovering from severe frostbite before returning to the front line, eventually to fly another 100 missions.|$|E
