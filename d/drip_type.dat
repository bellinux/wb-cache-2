40|$|A <b>drip</b> <b>type</b> {{rainfall}} simulator and an existing watershed study {{were used to}} assess relationships between runoff, infiltration, erosion and associated risk thresholds on a range watershed in Brazos County, Texas. The focus of the research was determining erosion risk associated with seasonal variations in precipitation and vegetation. The objectives were to (1) develop a climatic profile for Brazos County, Texas, (2) evaluate relationships between vegetative cover, infiltration, runoff, and climatic events, (3) quantify erosion/ runoff risk associated with measured vegetation, soil moisture, and climatic events, and (4) identify potential managerial thresholds for erosion risk management on similar range watersheds. The current year climatic profile showed the wettest season was summer with thirty-two percent of the precipitation coming from one rainfall event. Also, October through December was higher than the long-term rainfall average. Pair wise correlations identified season, initial time to runoff, percent litter, annual as the dominant species, soil moisture, amount to runoff and amount to storage as significant (p< 0. 05) variables affecting runoff and infiltration. Percent saturation and annuals as the dominant species were significant variables affecting sediment yield. During the current study, seasonal variations in precipitation patterns influenced runoff, infiltration, and sediment yield. Spring and summer had the highest infiltration rates while the largest runoff events were in fall and winter. The highest percent of soil saturation coincided with the largest runoff and sediment losses. Minimums of two centimeters (winter and fall) and three centimeters (spring and summer) initiated runoff. This rainfall threshold would be exceeded 20 percent of the time based on the climatic profile developed for Brazos County. Peak biomass production for the watershed site was 170. 61 g/m 2. This was above the recommended biomass threshold of 134. 5 to 168. 1 grams/m 2 to minimize sediment loss for tallgrass rangeland. Annual sediment loss was 10. 8 grams/m 2, which is negligible. Additional research across a wider array of site variation is needed to identify appropriate thresholds for the Post Oak Savanna ecosystem...|$|E

40|$|The {{identification}} of vadose zone hydrological pathways that most accurately transmit climate signals through karst aquifers to stalagmites {{is critical for}} accurately interpreting climate proxies contained within individual stalagmites. A three-year cave drip hydrochemical study across a spectrum of <b>drip</b> <b>types</b> in Crag Cave, SW Ireland, reveals substantial variability in drip hydrochemical behaviour. Stalagmites fed by very slow drips (2 ml/min) sites, apparently unconnected with local meteorological events. Water from these drips was typically undersaturated with respect to calcite, and thus {{did not result in}} calcite deposition. Data presented here suggest that drips in this flow regime also experience flow re-routing and blocking, and that any stalagmites developed under such drips are unsuitable as mid- to high-resolution paleoclimate proxies. Most drip sites demonstrated seasonal [Ca 2 +] and [Mg 2 +] variability that was probably linked to water excess. Prior calcite precipitation along the flowpath affected the chemistry of slowly dripping sites, while dilution predominantly controlled the water chemistry of the more rapidly dripping sites. This research underscores the importance of understanding drip hydrology prior to selecting stalagmites for paleoclimate analysis and before interpreting any subsequent proxy data...|$|R

40|$|High-frequency, spatially-dense {{discharge}} monitoring {{was conducted}} over fifteen months to characterise unsaturated zone flow at Harrie Wood Cave (HWC), in the Snowy Mountains, Yarrangobilly (SE Australia). The cave {{was formed in}} the Late Silurian Yarrangobilly Limestone, a fractured rock associated with very low primary porosity due to past diagenesis. Over our monitoring period we simultaneously measured rainfall, soil moisture saturation and drip discharge rate at fourteen sites to characterise infiltration–discharge relationships. All drip discharge sites exhibited non-Gaussian distributions, indicating long periods where low discharge predominates, punctuated by short infrequent periods of high discharge. However, there was significant variability in discharge between sites and consequently no spatial correlation in the cave. We investigated the depth–discharge relationship at HWC and found a moderate relationship between depth and drip discharge lag (response) times to soil moisture content, but only weak relationships between depth and mean and maximum discharge. This highlights that the karst architecture {{plays an important role}} in controlling drip discharge dynamics. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Agglomerative Hierarchal Clustering (AHC) were used to classify similar <b>drip</b> <b>types,</b> revealing five unique drip regimes. Two-phase flow and non-linear response to recharge behaviour were observed, suggesting secondary porosity is controlling unsaturated zone flow in mature limestone environments with low primary porosity. Using the data presented here, the first coupled conceptual and box hydrological flow model was developed. This study highlights the heterogeneous nature of hydrological flow in karst and the need to understand unsaturated zone hydrology at the individual drip discharge level, to inform speleothem studies for high-resolution paleoclimate reconstruction. © 2015, Elsevier B.

40|$|The {{nature of}} cave {{ventilation}} {{is of interest}} to cavers, speleologists, and paleoclimatologists working with stalagmites. Because cave ventilation systematics may change over the growth span of a stalagmite, understanding what factors affect them is critical for determining events that may have affected climate proxies within the stalagmite. Similarly, understanding how the hydrology of the drips feeding a stalagmite evolves through time is key to building robust records of paleoclimate, particularly because stalagmite records have become critical archives of climate change information of the last 500, 000 years. Here we present data from an extensive, on-going monitoring effort at Yok Balum Cave, Belize, initiated in 2011, that characterizes high-resolution ventilation dynamics at this site. Clear seasonal ventilation regimes exist, driven by thermally induced inside-outside air density differences. The winter regime is dominated by air inflow into the cave, decreased drawdown from the epikarst into the cave, and a limited diurnal signal. Conversely, summer ventilation is dominated by air outflow from the cave, greater CO 2 drawdown and drip water degassing, and a strong diurnal signal. Active monitoring during a large (M 7. 4) earthquake in November 2012 provides {{a unique opportunity to}} assess the response of the cave atmosphere and hydrology to substantial seismic activity. Cave atmosphere dynamics and hydrology are found to be highly resilient to seismic activity, with no observable disturbance occurring around the earthquake, despite there being considerable evidence of physical disruption in the cave. Monitoring included different kinds of drips, and the earthquake affected none of the monitored <b>drip</b> <b>types.</b> This suggests that stalagmite-derived paleoclimate records are not affected by seismic activity, except in extreme cases where the stalagmite or conjugate stalactite is damaged or reoriented...|$|R
40|$|Drip {{irrigation}} {{techniques have}} been used in the agricultural production industry as an advanced water-saving irrigation method in recent decades. However advantageous this method, there are still some difficulties in projecting the efficiency of such systems. Most especially, determination of the losses because of the emitters is very important in order to set up an efficient irrigation system. This study is focused on determining head losses for agricultural drip irrigation systems with cylindrical in-line <b>type</b> <b>drip</b> emitters using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) techniques. In the study, three-dimensional solid models of five in-line <b>type</b> <b>drip</b> emitters, which have a volumetric flow capacity of 4. 0 [l h- 1] and placed in a pipe with 250 [mm] intervals between each other, were considered and CFD analyses were carried out with different inlet pressure values. According to the results of the CFD analyses, hydraulic losses were calculated globally and locally and analysis outputs were presented to determine the head losses due to the inclusion of the emitters. Validations for results of the simulation were also achieved by using empirical equations taken from related literature. As a result, maximum simulation error rate of 8. 824 [%] was observed between simulations and empirical equations taken from related literature results. This accordance between simulation and empirical results can be interpreted that CFD analyses could be used to calculate the critical flow parameters such as total head losses of drip irrigation pipes integrated with in-line emitters...|$|R

40|$|The cost of reusing {{water in}} {{micro-irrigation}} {{at the field}} level has not been studied in depth although the use of effluents in agriculture is a viable alternative in areas where water is scarce or there is intense competition for its use. The aim {{of the present study}} is to analyse the private costs of water reuse in micro-irrigation in an experimental plot. This analysis is intended to provide information about the decision a farmer would make when the choice to use conventional or re-claimed water is guided by cost criteria. The components of the total costs of different combinations of four types of filters and five emitters that can be installed in micro-irrigation systems using reclaimed water have been studied with the data obtained from an experimental plot in conditions similar to those of fruit orchards. Different scenarios that compared the costs of using conventional or reclaimed water in terms of water price and nutrient content were also studied. The results show that a proper combination of filters and emitters can save up to 33 % in irrigation costs. Capital costs and maintenance costs were the most variable among the different combinations. Scenario analysis showed that the greater price of reclaimed water could be compensated by high nutrient contents, which would reduce fertilizer costs.

40|$|AbstractMicro-irrigation, fertigation, and {{mulching}} {{have been}} proposed to improve the nutrient and water-use efficiency of crop production. The effect of these management practices on the emission of nitrous oxide (N 2 O) from vineyards is not well understood and most prior studies were short-term (< 1 year). To investigate longer-term effects, a {{study was conducted in}} grape (Vitus vinifera L. cv. Merlot planted in a sandy loam soil in British Columbia, Canada. The experiment was a factorial treatment design consisting of two micro-irrigation <b>types</b> (<b>Drip</b> or Micro-sprinkler), two nitrogen sources (surface applied Compost or fertigated Urea at a rate of 40 kgNha− 1), and two vineyard floor managements (bark Mulch or “Clean”—meaning bare soil). Frequent measurements of N 2 O flux and soil and environmental variables were made over two complete years (2013 and 2014). A considerable portion (37 % in 2013 and 61 % in 2014) of the annual cumulative N 2 O emission (ΣN 2 O) occurred during the pre-growing season particularly within the thaw period. In 2013, the annual area-scaled ΣN 2 O emissions for Drip was ≈ 1. 8 ×Micro-sprinkler, Urea was ≈ 1. 5 ×Compost and Clean was ≈ 1. 7 ×Mulch. In 2014, ΣN 2 O emissions were over 14 % higher, likely due to more freeze–thaw events, higher soil mineral N availability (47 % higher), but treatments differences were not significantly different. Analysed over two years, micro-sprinkler reduced growing season emissions by 29 % and surface application of bark mulch decreased annual area-scaled and yield-scaled ΣN 2 O emissions by 28 % and 23 %, respectively, suggesting bark mulch as a strategy for mitigating N 2 O emission. The observed interannual variability in the total N 2 O emissions suggests that at least a minimum of 2 years of continuous study may be required to estimate representative annual N 2 O emission budgets and to recommend N 2 O mitigation strategies in vineyard systems...|$|R
40|$|A pilot tube farm {{has been}} {{installed}} at the Mililani Sewage Treatment Plant, O'ahu, Hawai'i, to study the necessary treatment of activated sludge effluent for <b>drip</b> irrigation. Four <b>types</b> of effluent will be processed: 100 % effluent, 50 % effluent diluted with 50 % Waiahole Ditch water plus the 100 % effluent and the 50 % to 50 % mix after a 3 -day detention in reservoir storage. Efficacy of treatment {{will be determined by}} the rate of plugging of the holes in the drip irrigation tubes {{and the quality of the}} post-treated water. The present posttreatment system consists of two-stage pressure filtration: first through No. 3 anthracite, then through No. 11 crushed granite. Filtration rate is 0. 001 36 - 0. 002 7 m^ 3 /s/m^ 2 (2 - 4 gpm/ft^ 2). The filtrate is given chemical treatment by chlorine, bromine chloride, or chlorine dioxide at a dosage equivalent to a 10 mg/l chlorine residual at the end of the drip tube line. The system and the dosages will be varied to a level that will yield least plugging. Both single-chamber and dual-chamber tubing will be tested. The tube farm is automated and is operated on a 24 -hr day schedule, processing 100 % effluent for 12 hr and 50 to 50 % dilution for 12 hr. Backwash takes place at the end of the run. Mean values for the effluent and ditch water were respectively, suspended solids, 31 and 23 mg/l; total plate count, 3 and 30 organisms x 10 ^ 3 /ml; total coliform, 34 and 970 organisms/ml; and total organic carbon, 56 and 27 mg/l.

40|$|An {{integrated}} {{assessment of}} the potential of different management practices for mitigating specific components of the total GHG budget (N 2 O and CH 4 emissions and C sequestration) of Mediterranean agrosystems was performed in this study. Their suitability regarding both yield and environmental (e. g. nitrate leaching and ammonia volatilization) sustainability, and regional barriers and opportunities for their implementation were also considered. Based on its results best strategies to abate GHG emissions in Mediterranean agro-systems were proposed. Adjusting N fertilization to crop needs in both irrigated and rain-fed systems could reduce N 2 O emissions up to 50 % compared with a non-adjusted practice. Substitution of N synthetic fertilizers by solid manure can be also implemented in those systems, and may abate N 2 O emissions by about 20 % under Mediterranean conditions, with additional indirect benefits associated to energy savings and positive effects in crop yields. The use of urease and nitrification inhibitors enhances N use efficiency of the cropping systems and may mitigate N 2 O emissions up to 80 % and 50 %, respectively. The type of irrigation may also have a great mitigation potential in the Mediterranean region. Drip-irrigated systems have on average 80 % lower N 2 O emissions than sprinkler systems and drip-irrigation combined with optimized fertilization showed a reduction in direct N 2 O emissions up to 50 %. Methane fluxes have a relatively small contribution to the total GHG budget of Mediterranean crops, which can mostly be controlled by careful management of the water table and organic inputs in paddies. Reduced soil tillage, improved management of crop residues and agro-industry by-products, and cover cropping in orchards, are the most suitable interventions to enhance organic C stocks in Mediterranean agricultural soils. The adoption of the proposed agricultural practices will require farmers training. The global analysis of life cycle emissions associated to irrigation <b>type</b> (<b>drip,</b> sprinkle and furrow) and N fertilization rate (100 and 300 kg N ha− 1 yr− 1) revealed that these factors may outweigh the reduction in GHG emissions beyond the plot scale. The analysis {{of the impact of}} some structural changes on top-down mitigation of GHG emissions revealed that 3 – 15 % of N 2 O emissions could be suppressed by avoiding food waste at the end-consumer level. A 40 % reduction in meat and dairy consumption could reduce GHG emissions by 20 – 30 %. Reintroducing the Mediterranean diet (i. e. ∼ 35 % intake of animal protein) would therefore result in a significant decrease of GHG emissions from agricultural production systems under Mediterranean conditions...|$|R
40|$|This report {{describes}} a full-scale grouting {{test in the}} Törnskog Tunnel. The tunnel {{is part of the}} Nordlänken project north of Stockholm, which has two separated tunnel tubes. The test was conducted during production of the tunnel during spring 2005 in chainage from 12012 to 12112. A new concept of grouting was designed and executed based on the grouting material silica sol with the brand name Meyco MP 320. Silica sol has been succesfully tested before in field tests in Hallandåsen 2003 and in Äspö HRL 2004. This test is the first test with silica sol in full production of a tunnel in hard rock. The initiative was taken by the National Road Administration, Oden Anläggningsentreprenad and AB BESAB. Design of the grouting procedure were based on a standard tests for characterisation of the rock mass. With use of a pareto-distribution curve, the hydraulic apertures of the fractures could be computed, further the hydraulic apertures was used to estimate the inflows to the tunnel. The demands set on the allowable leakage into the tunnel resulted that hydraulic apertures down to 14 &# 956;m needed to be sealed. Cement can penetrate and seal apertures down to 0. 05 - 0. 1 mm and therefore it was necessary to use a grout material that has a better penetrability, like silica sol. The grout, named Meyco MP 320, was chosen and the design parameters were established: grout pressure, gel time, grouting time. The desired penetration was 1. 2 m in order to limit unnecessary spread of the grout. The design was different than the traditional grouting methods with demands set on the effective grouting time at a prescribed pressure. All grout fans were carefully monitored using hydraulic tests, before and after grouting as well as control of the actual grouting. Last, the result of the grouting was complemented with a <b>drip</b> characterisation. Two <b>types</b> of grout fans were used. One with the above mentioned grout procedure and one based on the grouting procedure normally used in the Törnskogs Tunnel, but with silica sol instead of cement. The first type fan was used when the rock quality was poor. The other when the rock quality was better. The test with these type fans with silica sol were conducted in one tunnel tube, T 201, the other tube was grouted with cement following the standard procedure used in the project. This enabled a comparison of the sealing effect between the cement grouted tunnel tube and silica sol grouted tube. The results of the grouting showed that 8 out of totally 9 grouting fans were successful. The designed fans were used in five cases were the rock mass were presumed to be of poor quality, that is with larger fracture zones present. The objective for this field test was to limit the inflow of water to tunnel corresponding to value of the transmissivity of 3. 2 &# 1468; 10 - 7 m 2 /s for the grouted section of 100 m. After grouting the achieved transmissivity was calculated to be 6. 2 &# 1468; 10 - 7 m 2 /s. The achieved value of the transmissivity is rather close to the desired; the achieved value considers all fans, including the unsuccessful one. No significant conclusion could be made with the comparison of the sealing effect using cement or silica sol as a grouting agent. The conclusion is that the technique of grouting is very important and more effort needs to be done regarding the grouting time...|$|R
