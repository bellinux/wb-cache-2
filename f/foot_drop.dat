Given this new knowledge about the riverbed, some interested parties, including Summit County, campaigned for complete removal of the dam. The revised plan, initially denied on September 20, 2005, {{was approved by the}} Munroe Falls City Council on a week later. The 11.5 foot sandstone dam has since been removed, and in its place now is a natural ledge with a 4.5 <b>foot</b> <b>drop</b> at its greatest point.|$|E

Employing the digital backlot technique, Snyder shot at the now-defunct Icestorm Studios in Montreal using bluescreens. Butler said that while he did not feel constrained by Snyder's direction, fidelity to the comic imposed certain limitations on his performance. Wenham said there were times when Snyder wanted to precisely capture iconic moments from the comic book, and other times when he gave actors freedom [...] "to explore within the world and the confines that had been set." [...] Headey said of her experience with the bluescreens, [...] "It's very odd, and emotionally, there's nothing to connect to apart from another actor." [...] Only one scene, in which horses travel across the countryside, was shot outdoors.

500|$|In adults, {{symptoms}} {{can occur}} at levels above 40μg/dL, but {{are more likely}} to occur only above 50–60μg/dL. Symptoms begin to appear in children generally at around 60μg/dL. However, the lead levels at which symptoms appear vary widely depending on unknown characteristics of each individual. At blood lead levels between 25 and 60μg/dL, neuropsychiatric effects such as delayed reaction times, irritability, and difficulty concentrating, as well as slowed motor nerve conduction and headache can occur. Anemia may appear at blood lead levels higher than 50μg/dL. In adults, abdominal colic, involving paroxysms of pain, may appear at blood lead levels greater than 80μg/dL. Signs that occur in adults at blood lead levels exceeding 100μg/dL include wrist drop and <b>foot</b> <b>drop,</b> [...] and signs of encephalopathy (a condition characterized by brain swelling), such as those that accompany increased pressure within the skull, delirium, coma, seizures, and headache. In children, signs of encephalopathy such as bizarre behavior, discoordination, and apathy occur at lead levels exceeding 70μg/dL. For both adults and children, it is rare to be asymptomatic if blood lead levels exceed 100μg/dL.|$|E

[...] Orongo, the site of the cult’s festivities, was a dangerous landscape which consisted of a “narrow ridge between a 1,000 <b>foot</b> <b>drop</b> into the ocean {{on one side and a}} deep crater on the other”. Considered the sacred spot of Orongo, Mata Ngarau was the location where birdman priests prayed and chanted for a successful egg hunt. “The purpose of the birdman contest was to obtain the first egg of the season from the offshore islet Motu Nui. Contestants descended the sheer cliffs of Orongo and swam to Motu Nui where they awaited the coming of the birds.

50|$|The {{causes of}} <b>foot</b> <b>drop,</b> as for all causes of {{neurological}} lesions, should be approached using a localization-focused approach before etiologies are considered. Most of the time, <b>foot</b> <b>drop</b> {{is the result}} of neurological disorder; only rarely is the muscle diseased or nonfunctional. The source for the neurological impairment can be central (spinal cord or brain) or peripheral (nerves located connecting from the spinal cord to an end-site muscle or sensory receptor). <b>Foot</b> <b>drop</b> is rarely the result of a pathology involving the muscles or bones that make up the lower leg. The anterior tibialis is the muscle that picks up the foot. Although the anterior tibialis {{plays a major role in}} dorsiflexion, it is assisted by the fibularis tertius, extensor digitorum longus and the extensor halluces longus. If the drop foot is caused by neurological disorder all of these muscles could be affected because they are all innervated by the deep fibular (peroneal) nerve, which branches from the sciatic nerve. The sciatic nerve exits the lumbar plexus with its root arising from the fifth lumbar nerve space. Occasionally, spasticity in the muscles opposite the anterior tibialis, the gastrocnemius and soleus, exists in the presence of <b>foot</b> <b>drop,</b> making the pathology much more complex than <b>foot</b> <b>drop.</b> Isolated <b>foot</b> <b>drop</b> is usually a flaccid condition. There are gradations of weakness that can be seen with <b>foot</b> <b>drop,</b> as follows: 0=complete paralysis, 1=flicker of contraction, 2=contraction with gravity eliminated alone, 3=contraction against gravity alone, 4=contraction against gravity and some resistance, and 5=contraction against powerful resistance (normal power). <b>Foot</b> <b>drop</b> is different from foot slap, which is the audible slapping of the foot to the floor with each step that occurs when the foot first hits the floor on each step, although they often are concurrent.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Foot</b> <b>drop</b> is a gait {{abnormality}} {{in which}} the dropping of the forefoot happens due to weakness, irritation or damage to the common fibular nerve including the sciatic nerve, or paralysis of the muscles in the anterior portion of the lower leg.
