5|$|Though the oil {{industry}} has historically dominated Tulsa's economy, efforts in economic diversification have created a base in the sectors of aerospace, finance, technology, telecommunications, high tech, and manufacturing. A number of substantial <b>financial</b> <b>corporations</b> are headquartered in Tulsa, the largest being the BOK Financial Corporation. Among these financial services firms are energy trading operations, asset management firms, investment funds, {{and a range of}} commercial banks. The national convenience store chain QuikTrip, fast-casual restaurant chain Camille's Sidewalk Cafe, and pizza chain Mazzio's are all headquartered in Tulsa, as is Southern regional BBQ restaurant Rib Crib.

25|$|Deane J wrote a {{vigorous}} dissenting judgement {{in which he}} said that the words of the Constitution itself were authoritative, not the views expressed by the participants at the Constitutional Conventions. Deane J, in opposition to the majority of the court, considered that the wording of s51(xx) could be interpreted so as to give the Commonwealth a general power to incorporate trading and <b>financial</b> <b>corporations.</b>|$|E
25|$|Section 51(xx) {{provides}} {{that the federal}} government has powers to make laws regarding foreign, trading and <b>financial</b> <b>corporations.</b> Tasmania argued that this head of power could not apply to its Hydro-Electric Commission since it was in effect a department of the Tasmanian government, and not a trading corporation. However, as the HEC was engaged in the widespread production and sale of electricity, and had a degree of independence from the government, it was held to be a trading corporation.|$|E

25|$|The Providencia Avenue area {{became an}} {{important}} commercial hub in the eastern sector. This development was extended to Barrio Alto, which became an attractive location {{for the construction of}} high-rise buildings. Major companies and <b>financial</b> <b>corporations</b> were established in the area, which gave rise to a thriving modern business center known as Sanhattan. The departure of these companies to Barrio Alto and the construction of shopping centers all around the city created a crisis in the city center. To reinvent the area, the main shopping streets were turned into pedestrian walkways, such as the Paseo Ahumada, and the government instituted tax benefits for the construction of residential buildings, which attracted young adults.|$|E
25|$|The High Court {{upheld the}} {{validity}} of the inquiry provisions and of those based on the trade and commerce power, thus upholding the conviction of Appleton. The conviction of Huddart Parker however was set aside, with the majority, Griffith CJ, Barton & O'Connor JJ, holding that the provisions based on the corporations power were invalid. Their Honours were strongly influenced by the now discredited doctrine of reserved State powers, holding that the corporations power was to be construed narrowly because the trade and commerce power did not include intrastate trade and commerce such that the Parliament could not make a valid law controlling the intra-State trading operations of foreign, trading or <b>financial</b> <b>corporations.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Court {{held that}} the Corporations power did not enable the Parliament to make a valid law {{controlling}} the intra-State trading operations of foreign, trading or <b>financial</b> <b>corporations.</b> In giving their reasons, {{each member of the}} Court {{held that the}} corporations power does not confer on the Commonwealth Parliament power to create corporations. While four of the judges agreed as to the outcome, there was no majority view of the meaning of the corporation power. As all five members of the Court had been leading participants in the Constitutional Conventions and are properly seen as among the framers of the Constitution, these differences of opinion deny that there was then any settled understanding, accepted by these framers of the Constitution, of what meaning or effect was to be given to the corporations power. Three of the judges, Griffith CJ, Barton & O'Connor JJ, relied upon the doctrine of reserved powers, holding that intra-State trading activities were reserved to the States. The importance of the reserved powers doctrine does not however explain all aspects of the differences in opinion about the ambit of the corporations power, in particular the distinction between regulating a corporations relations with outside parties and regulating the internal affairs of a corporation.|$|E

2500|$|The {{town was}} once home to several large {{businesses}} and industries.

2500|$|A {{professional}} {{book review}} by Maximiliano Korstanje, an economist from Argentina, posits {{a more radical}} criticism on Why Nations Fail. Far from being objective, he claims, the argument of this book is based on Ethnocentrism, or Anglocentrism—that other non-Western civilizations will converge to the universal Western ideal of development, democracy and human rights. Acemoglu and Robinson, he argues, fail {{to recognize that there}} are many other nations that are free to choose to live in another way; there is no imperative stating that all nations should be democratic to enjoy the “benefits” of modern life and a capitalist economy. Indeed, paradoxically, envisaging democracy as a [...] "universal value" [...] is a betrayal to the self-determination of others, which Korstanje sees as the very cornerstone of democratic ideology. In his view, defining a nation's success as a function of its degree of wealth or per capita income corresponds directly to an [...] "ethnocentric" [...] mechanism within the discipline, aimed at creating a need in non-western societies, namely, the [...] "need" [...] to be [...] "economically developed," [...] "modern" [...] and [...] "democratic." [...] There is no genuine attempt for a critical discussion of the role of international <b>financial</b> <b>corporations</b> like the World Bank in issuing an unlimited number of loans to the world. Lastly, Acemoglu and Robinson are not treating the problem of inequality with accuracy and detail. The Gini coefficient list shows how some Latin American countries such as Uruguay are more egalitarian than the United States. Moreover, inside the United States, despite the high level of economic development and the democratic system, black people are often excluded from such benefits, reaffirming the ethnocentric nature of democracy and development.|$|E
