25|$|A 1935 {{article in}} Popular Aviation magazine, which renewed {{interest}} in Whitehead, said winter weather ruined the Number 22 airplane after Whitehead placed it unprotected in his yard following his claimed flights of January 1902. The article said Whitehead did not <b>have</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> build a shelter for the aircraft because of a quarrel with his financial backer. The article also reported that in early 1903 Whitehead built a 200-horsepower eight-cylinder engine, intended to power a new aircraft. Another financial backer insisted on testing the engine in a boat on Long Island Sound, but lost control and capsized, sending the engine to the bottom.|$|E

500|$|Days {{prior to}} this announcement, state Emergency Management Director Frank Siracusa noted that [...] "there is no {{precedent}} where government will go after people for costs just because they <b>have</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> pay for it. You get lost, and we look for you. It is a service your taxpayer dollars pay for", although he conceded that legally any decision would rest with Gibbons. At an April 10, 2008 Legislature's Interim Finance Committee hearing, Siracusa indicated that he had hired an independent auditor to review costs incurred by the state in searching for Fossett, but added, [...] "We are doing an audit but not because we are critical of anybody or suspect something was done wrong". Chairman Morse Arberry queried Siracusa as to why, since they lacked funds, had the state not billed the Fossett family for its search costs, to which Siracusa did not directly respond. In his later interview with the Las Vegas Review-Journal, he stated that his comments to the Committee may have given the false impression that he had hired an auditor {{for the purpose of}} later challenging the state's financial burden incurred on its behalf by the National Guard during the search operation. Upon interview regarding reports that the state would seek payment, Arberry was recorded as stating that he was glad to hear steps were being taken to try to recoup some of the costs.|$|E

500|$|In October 2007, Lukashenko {{was accused}} of making anti-Semitic and anti-Israel comments; {{addressing}} the [...] "miserable state {{of the city of}} Babruysk" [...] on a live broadcast on state radio, he stated: [...] "This is a Jewish city, and the Jews are not concerned for the place they live in. They have turned Babruysk into a pigsty. Look at Israel – I was there and saw it myself ... I call on Jews who <b>have</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> come back to Babruysk." [...] Members of the US House of Representatives {{sent a letter to the}} Belarusian ambassador to the US, Mikhail Khvostov, addressing Lukashenko's comments with a strong request to retract them, and the comments also caused a negative reaction from Israel. Consequently, Pavel Yakubovich, editor of Belarus Today, was sent to Israel, and in a meeting with the Israel Foreign Ministry said that Lukashenko's comment was [...] "a mistake that was said jokingly, and does not represent his positions regarding the Jewish people" [...] and that he was [...] "anything but anti-Semitic," [...] and had been [...] "insulted by the mere accusation." [...] The Belarusian Ambassador to Israel, Igor Leshchenya, stated that the president had a [...] "kind attitude toward the Jewish people", and Sergei Rychenko, the press secretary at the Belarusian Embassy in Tel Aviv, said parts of Lukashenko's comments had been mistranslated.|$|E
500|$|Since García Márquez was eighteen, he {{had wanted}} to write a novel based on his grandparents' house where he grew up. However, he {{struggled}} with finding an appropriate tone and put off the idea until one day the answer hit him while driving his family to Acapulco. [...] He turned the car around and the family returned home so he could begin writing. [...] He sold his car so his family would <b>have</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> live on while he wrote, but writing the novel took far longer than he expected, and he wrote every day for eighteen months. His wife had to ask for food on credit from their butcher and their baker as well as nine months of rent on credit from their landlord. During the eighteen months of writing, García Márquez met with two couples, Eran Carmen and Álvaro Mutis, and María Luisa Elío and Jomí García Ascot, every night and discussed the progress of the novel, trying out different versions. Fortunately, when the book was finally published in 1967 it became his most commercially successful novel, One Hundred Years of Solitude, which sold more than 30 million copies (Cien años de soledad) (1967; English translation by Gregory Rabassa 1970) and was dedicated “Para (to) Jomí García Ascot y María Luisa Elío”. The story chronicles several generations of the Buendía family from the time they founded the fictional South American village of Macondo, through their trials and tribulations, instances of incest, births and deaths. The history of Macondo is often generalized by critics to represent rural towns throughout Latin America or at least near García Márquez's native Aracataca.|$|E

[...] Priestley's friend from Leeds, Theophilus Lindsey, decided to try. He gave up his church, sold his books {{so that he would}} <b>have</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> live on and established the first Unitarian chapel in London. The radical publisher Joseph Johnson helped him find a building, which became known as Essex Street Chapel. Priestley's patron at the time, Lord Shelburne, promised that he would keep the church out of legal difficulties (barrister John Lee, later Attorney-General, also helped), and Priestley and many others hurried to raise money for Lindsey.|$|E

2500|$|Boeing {{began work}} on {{pressurized}} long-range bombers in 1938, {{in response to a}} United States Army Air Corps request. Boeing's design study for the Model 334 was a pressurized derivative of the Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress with nosewheel undercarriage. Although the Air Corps did not <b>have</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> pursue the design, Boeing continued development with its own funds as a private venture. In April 1939, Charles Lindbergh convinced general Henry H. Arnold to produce a new bomber in large numbers to counter the Nazi production. The Air Corps issued a formal specification for a so-called [...] "superbomber", capable of delivering [...] of bombs to a target [...] away and capable of flying at a speed of [...] in December 1939.

On 11 July, Fernández criticized the administration of the Buenos Aires province because the provincial government didn't <b>have</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> pay their workers wages. The province requested a transfer of funds from the federal government but were initially denied by the President. On 20 July, the federal government agreed to transfer funds to the province. Moyano claimed the denial to transfer funds was to harm Scioli's image, as Scioli has the highest rate of approval of any governor in the nation.|$|E
2500|$|On 30 June 1994, Palmer {{was playing}} at a neighbour's house in Henrietta Street, Hartlepool, after being {{collected}} from nursery school by her stepfather, John Thornton. At approximately 15:30, Gary Amerigo, the local ice cream vendor, arrived and Palmer went to ask Thornton {{if she could}} <b>have</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> buy an ice pop. She was the only customer, and after serving her, the ice cream salesman left and continued his route. Amerigo said later: [...] "Only Rosie came up to my van that day. She didn't have enough money but I gave her the ice-cream anyway. She seemed just her usual self, bright and cheerful." [...] Armstrong — who was celebrating his 32nd birthday that day — abducted her as she walked away after making her purchase. It was approximately two hours before Thornton realised Palmer was no longer at the neighbour's or playing outside the house. He and other local residents began to search the local area for her, and at 20:45 she was reported missing to the police.|$|E
