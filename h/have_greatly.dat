5|$|A severe {{regression}} would <b>have</b> <b>greatly</b> {{reduced the}} continental shelf area, {{which is the}} most species-rich part of the sea, and therefore could have been enough to cause a marine mass extinction, however, research concludes that this change would have been insufficient to cause the observed level of ammonite extinction. The regression would also have caused climate changes, partly by disrupting winds and ocean currents and partly by reducing the Earth's albedo and therefore, increasing global temperatures.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} of Bojić's birth, his parents {{were living in a}} small flat at No. 4 Sremska Street, {{situated}} just above his father's shop in Belgrade's Stari Grad. Over the next decade, they had four more children– Jelica (b. 1894), Danica (b. 1896), Radivoje (b. 1900) and Dragoljub (b. 1905). All of their children survived to adulthood. When Bojić was a child, he and his family were frequently visited by his mother's cousin Jovan Sremac, the brother of humourist Stevan Sremac. Jovan is said to <b>have</b> <b>greatly</b> influenced the young Bojić, having introduced him to Serbian folk tales and medieval legends at an early age.|$|E
5|$|Bivalves {{vary greatly}} in overall shape. Some, {{such as the}} cockles, have shells that are nearly globular; cockles can jump by bending and {{straightening}} their foot. Others, such as the razor clams, are burrowing specialists with elongated shells and a powerful foot adapted for rapid digging. The shipworms, in the family Teredinidae <b>have</b> <b>greatly</b> elongated bodies, but their shell valves are much reduced and restricted to the anterior end of the body, where they function as scraping organs that permit the animal to dig tunnels through wood.|$|E
5|$|Cimon {{then moved}} to pre-emptively attack the Persian forces near the Eurymedon. Sailing {{into the mouth of}} the river, Cimon quickly routed the Persian fleet {{gathered}} there. Most of the Persian fleet made land-fall, and the sailors fled to the shelter of the Persian army. Cimon then landed the Greek marines and proceeded to attack the Persian army, which was also routed. The Greeks captured the Persian camp, taking many prisoners, and were able to destroy 200 beached Persian triremes. This stunning double victory seems to <b>have</b> <b>greatly</b> demoralised the Persians, and prevented any further Persian campaigning in the Aegean until at least 451 BC. However, the Delian League do not appear to have pressed home their advantage, probably because of other events in the Greek world that required their attention.|$|E

5|$|Côte d'Ivoire so that {{he could}} organise {{opposition}} to the Sankara regime. In 1987, Sankara was overthrown and assassinated in a coup. The coup may have had French involvement, since the Sankara regime had fallen into disfavour in France. Houphouët-Boigny was also suspected of involvement in the coup and in November, the PDCI asked the government to ban the sale of Jeune Afrique following its allegations of Houphouët-Boigny's participation. The Ivorian president would <b>have</b> <b>greatly</b> benefited from the divisions in the Burkina Faso government. He contacted Blaise Compaoré, the second-most powerful man in the regime; it is generally believed that they worked in conjunction with Laurent Dona Fologo, Robert Guéï and Pierre Ouédraogo to overthrow the Sankara regime.|$|E
5|$|Foresters and ecologists {{argue that}} large {{controlled}} burns in Yellowstone {{prior to the}} fires would not <b>have</b> <b>greatly</b> reduced the area that was consumed in 1988. Controlled burns would quickly become uncontrolled if {{they were allowed to}} burn with the intensity that many tree and plant communities need for proper regeneration. Consequently, natural fires, rather than controlled burns, are the park's primary maintenance tool. Since the late 1970s, some 300 natural fires have been allowed to burn themselves out. In rare circumstances, natural fires are supplemented by controlled burns that are deliberately started to remove dead timber under conditions which allow fire fighters an opportunity to carefully control where and how much wood fuel is consumed.|$|E
5|$|Four bee {{families}} (Andrenidae, Colletidae, Halictidae, and Apidae) {{contain some}} {{species that are}} crepuscular. Most are tropical or subtropical, {{but there are some}} which live in arid regions at higher latitudes. These bees <b>have</b> <b>greatly</b> enlarged ocelli, which are extremely sensitive to light and dark, though incapable of forming images. Some have refracting superposition compound eyes: these combine the output of many elements of their compound eyes to provide enough light for each retinal photoreceptor. Their ability to fly by night enables them to avoid many predators, and to exploit flowers that produce nectar only or also at night.|$|E

5|$|In 1998 the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group {{published}} a phylogeny for flowering plants {{based on an}} analysis of DNA sequences from most families of flowering plants. As {{a result of this}} work, many questions, such as which families represent the earliest branches of angiosperms, have now been answered. Investigating how plant species are related to each other allows botanists to better understand the process of evolution in plants. Despite the study of model plants and increasing use of DNA evidence, there is ongoing work and discussion among taxonomists about how best to classify plants into various taxa. Technological developments such as computers and electron microscopes <b>have</b> <b>greatly</b> increased the level of detail studied and speed at which data can be analysed.|$|E
5|$|Malaysia's cuisine {{reflects}} the multi-ethnic makeup of its population. Many cultures {{from within the}} country and from surrounding regions <b>have</b> <b>greatly</b> influenced the cuisine. Much of the influence comes from the Malay, Chinese, Indian, Thai, Javanese, and Sumatran cultures, {{largely due to the}} country being part of the ancient spice route. The cuisine is very similar to that of Singapore and Brunei, and also bears resemblance to Filipino cuisine. The different states have varied dishes, and often the food in Malaysia is different from the original dishes.|$|E
5|$|Maryland {{entered the}} game having been {{knocked out of}} the running for the Atlantic Division title the {{previous}} week, but able to play spoiler for Boston College. The Eagles were playing to earn a berth to the ACC Championship Game for the second consecutive year. Additionally, competing within a closely contested ACC, Maryland could <b>have</b> <b>greatly</b> improved its standing for bowl selection with an eighth win. The Eagles were the fifth ranked team to face Maryland. The Terrapins were, to that point, 4–0 against top-25 opposition and the only team to beat four ranked opponents in 2008. Boston College was fielding second-string quarterback Dominique Davis in his first career appearance. He replaced starter Chris Crane, who had suffered a broken collarbone the previous week.|$|E

Some of these were already introduced at the Chess World Cup 2015 (also in Baku), which included transmission delay of (some) games, random security checks of players, ban for bringing pens and watches into the playing hall and installment of electronic checkpoints for players {{at the entrance of}} the playing hall (see below).|$|E
5|$|Pilgrim numbers <b>have</b> <b>greatly</b> {{increased}} in recent years, {{which has led}} to numerous accidents and deaths due to overcrowding. The first major accident during Hajj in modern times occurred in 1990, when a tunnel stampede led to the death of 1,462 people. Afterwards, various crowd-control techniques were adopted to ensure safety. Because of large crowds, some of the rituals have become more symbolic. For example, it is no longer necessary to kiss the Black Stone. Instead, pilgrims simply point at it on each circuit around the Kaaba. Also, the large pillars used for pebble throwing were changed into long walls in 2004 with basins below to catch the stones. Another example is that animal sacrifice is now done at slaughterhouses appointed by the Saudi authorities, without the pilgrims being present there.|$|E
5|$|Specific {{instances}} include removing {{of parts}} from the mould {{immediately after the}} parts are created, as well as applying machine vision systems. A robot grips the part after the ejector pins have been extended to free the part from the mould. It then moves them into either a holding location or directly onto an inspection system. The choice depends upon the type of product, {{as well as the}} general layout of the manufacturing equipment. Vision systems mounted on robots <b>have</b> <b>greatly</b> enhanced quality control for insert moulded parts. A mobile robot can more precisely determine the placement accuracy of the metal component, and inspect faster than a human can.|$|E

5|$|Synthetic nitrogen, {{along with}} mined rock phosphate, {{pesticides}} and mechanization, <b>have</b> <b>greatly</b> increased crop yields {{in the early}} 20th century. Increased supply of grains has led to cheaper livestock as well. Further, global yield increases were experienced later in the 20th century when high-yield varieties of common staple grains such as rice, wheat, and corn were introduced {{as a part of}} the Green Revolution. The Green Revolution exported the technologies (including pesticides and synthetic nitrogen) of the developed world to the developing world. Thomas Malthus famously predicted that the Earth would not be able to support its growing population, but technologies such as the Green Revolution have allowed the world to produce a surplus of food.|$|E
5|$|The actual {{degree of}} {{authority}} any pirate captain exercised over his crew was questionable, {{as he had}} no access to the procedures and sanctions of admiralty law that supported government captains. Many pirate captains were elected by their crews and could be deposed in the same manner. Because of his ignorance of nautical matters, Bonnet was in an even weaker position than other pirate captains, as is demonstrated by the utter domination Blackbeard exercised over him during their collaboration. During Bonnet's early career, his crew {{seems to have been}} less than loyal to him and to <b>have</b> <b>greatly</b> preferred the more charismatic and experienced Blackbeard.|$|E
5|$|The {{river was}} {{formerly}} a food source with yabbies, mussels and small fish, however {{the reduction in}} water quality, changing of the river's habitat, and introduction of European fish species {{has led to a}} reduction in fauna quantity and diversity. Exotic pest species such as the European carp, redfin perch and trout <b>have</b> <b>greatly</b> reduced native fish populations like the big headed gudgeon (Philypnodon grandiceps) but native waterfowl are common along the river with Pacific black ducks, Australian wood ducks, black swans, ibis, egrets and herons amongst the more than 100 species seen. The number of exotic waterfowl species such as mallards has reduced in recent years. In places the steep banks of the river are an ideal habitat for long-necked tortoises.|$|E
