The correlation of decrease of deuterium pressure with time was attained by the experiment of alloys absorbing deuterium. According to the results，the main factors that decide kinetics of Ti-Hf alloys absorbing deuterium were put forward and discussed. In the temperature range of 473 to 873 K, the deuteration curves of Ti-Hf alloys present two distinct figure in the higher or lower temperature region, which implies dissimilar reaction mechanism.

The calculated metastable extension of the phase boundaries on the Nb-rich side of the phase diagram by Lipschutz et al. [1] indicates that upon suppression of the formation of the Nb 5 Si 3 phase, the intermediate phase, Nb 3 Si becomes a congruently melting compound. In such a case the Nb 3 Si phase does not undergo the above mentioned eutectoid decomposition, and is retained at room temperature. Various investigations have shown that following solidification at cooling rates normally observed in conventional castings, the cast microstructure consists of Nb and Nb 3 Si phases [3, 4]. The presence of Nb 3 Si has been attributed to difficulties in initiation of the eutectoid reaction Nb 3 Si → Nb 5 Si 3 + Nb [4]. The phase diagram also predicts that the Nb 3 Si phase should have an ordered tP- 32 (Ti 3 P type, space group # 86) structure over the entire temperature range of its stability (1770 ° to 1990 °C).

Results indicate that the ratio of pearlite/ferrite is about 9 : 1 and the graphite size is less than 40 μm in diameter in the as-cast QT 700 - 6 alloy. The predominant refinement mechanism is attributed to the formation of niobium carbides, which increases the heterogeneous nucleus and hinders the growth of graphite.

The tensile strength and elongation of the as-cast QT 700 - 6 alloy reach over 700 MPa and 6 %, respectively, when the addition amount of niobium is 0. 8 %.

Tempering involves reheating quenched steel to a temperature below the <b>eutectoid</b> <b>temperature</b> then cooling.

This allows quenching to start at a lower temperature, making the process much easier.

50|$|Alloying {{elements}} {{are added to}} achieve certain properties in the material. As a guideline, alloying {{elements are}} added in lower percentages (less than 5%) to increase strength or hardenability, or in larger percentages (over 5%) to achieve special properties, such as corrosion resistance or extreme temperature stability.Manganese, silicon, or aluminum are added during the steelmaking process to remove dissolved oxygen, sulfur and phosphorus from the melt.Manganese, silicon, nickel, and copper are added to increase strength by forming solid solutions in ferrite. Chromium, vanadium, molybdenum, and tungsten increase strength by forming second-phase carbides. Nickel and copper improve corrosion resistance in small quantities. Molybdenum helps to resist embrittlement. Zirconium, cerium, and calcium increase toughness by controlling the shape of inclusions. Sulfur ({{in the form of}} manganese sulfide) lead, bismuth, selenium, and tellurium increase machinability.The alloying elements tend to form either solid solutions or compounds or carbides. Nickel is very soluble in ferrite; therefore, it forms compounds, usually Ni3Al. Aluminium dissolves in the ferrite and forms the compounds Al2O3 and AlN. Silicon is also very soluble and usually forms the compound SiO2•MxOy. Manganese mostly dissolves in ferrite forming the compounds MnS, MnO•SiO2, but will also form carbides in the form of (Fe,Mn)3C. Chromium forms partitions between the ferrite and carbide phases in steel, forming (Fe,Cr3)C, Cr7C3, and Cr23C6. The type of carbide that chromium forms depends on the amount of carbon and other types of alloying elements present. Tungsten and molybdenum form carbides if there is enough carbon and an absence of stronger carbide forming elements (i.e., titanium & niobium), they form the carbides W2C and Mo2C, respectively. Vanadium, titanium, and niobium are strong carbide forming elements, forming vanadium carbide, titanium carbide, and niobium carbide, respectively.Alloying elements also {{have an effect on the}} <b>eutectoid</b> <b>temperature</b> of the steel. Manganese and nickel lower the <b>eutectoid</b> <b>temperature</b> and are known as austenite stabilizing elements. With enough of these elements the austenitic structure may be obtained at room temperature.

In case of the non-pearlitic modes of transformation this concerns intermetallic phases of the general description A 3 B-A 3 C. The application of intensive deformation like HPT may introduce opposite mechanisms introducing some degree of the metastable disordered phase structure at room temperature. The paper presents results of the phase composition and microstructure studies of the alloys of composition Ni 75 AlxVy (where x = 15, 10, 5 and y = 10, 15, 20), which undergo the solid-state <b>eutectoid</b> decomposition at <b>temperature</b> 1281 K, in the equilibrium conditions.

The average size of the Sherrer’s coherent diffraction volumes did not exceed 9 nm, suggesting nano-structure of the material. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high resolution electron microscopy (HRTEM) revealed that the micro- and nano- deformation twins were the main feature of the microstructure, dividing volume into cells of the sizes similar to the coherent volumes.

40|$|In a Pu- 2. 0 at% Ga alloy, it is {{observed}} experimentally {{that the amount of}} the martensitic alpha-prime product formed upon cooling the metastable delta phase below the martensite burst temperature (M{sub b}) {{is a function of the}} holding temperature and holding time of a prior conditioning (''annealing'') treatment. Before subjecting a sample to a cooling and heating cycle to form and revert the alpha-prime phase, it was first homogenized for 8 hours at 375 C to remove any microstructural memory of prior transformations. Subsequently, conditioning was carried out in a differential scanning calorimeter apparatus at temperatures in the range between - 50 C and 370 C for periods of up to 70 hours to determine the holding time and temperature that produced the largest volume fraction of alpha-prime upon subsequent cooling. Using transformation peak areas (i. e., the heats of transformation) as a measure of the amount of alpha-prime formed, the largest amount of alpha-prime was obtained following holding at 25 C for at prime least 6 hours. Additional time at 25 C, up to 70 hours, did not increase the amount of subsequent alpha-prime formation. At 25 C, the Pu- 2. 0 at% Ga alloy is below the <b>eutectoid</b> transformation <b>temperature</b> in the phase diagram and the expected equilibrium phases are {alpha} and Pu{sub 3 }Ga, although a complete eutectoid decomposition of delta to these phases is expected to be extremely slow. It is proposed here that the influence of the conditioning treatment can be attributed to the activation of alpha-phase embryos in the matrix as a beginning step toward the eutectoid decomposition, and we discuss the effects of spontaneous self-irradiation accompanying the Pu radioactive decay on the activation process. Subsequently, upon cooling, certain embryos appear to be active as sites for the burst growth of martensitic alpha-prime particles, and their amount, distribution, and potency appear to contribute to the total amount of martensitic product formed. A modeling approach based on classical nucleation theory is presented to describe the formation of alpha-phase embryos during conditioning. The reasons why the holding times during conditioning become eventually ineffective in promoting more alpha-prime formation on cooling are discussed in terms of the differences in the potency of the embryos created in the delta matrix during conditioning and in terms of growth-impeding volume strains in the matrix resulting from an increasing number of martensite particles, thus opposing further growth. It is suggested that the disparate amounts of the alpha-prime formation reported in the literature following various studies may be in part a consequence of the fact that conditioning times at ambient temperatures are inevitably involved in any handling of radioactive samples prior to testing...|$|R

This thesis examines the interplay between crystallisation kinetics, crystal structure and phase behaviour using model C 18 /C 16 alkane mixtures. Computational systematic search modelling in combination with high resolution synchrotron X-ray powder data yields its crystallographic structure for C 18 and C 16 together with their volume thermal expansion coefficients: 4. 39 ±(1. 94) × 〖 10 〗^(- 4) ˚C- 1 and 4. 17 ±(2. 48) × 〖 10 〗^(- 4) ˚C- 1. Morphological analysis of C 18 crystals reveals a plate-like morphology dominated by the 001 habit plane with smaller side faces (depending upon supersaturation). Analysis of C 18 /C 16 binary phase diagram reveals five single phases (liquid, R 1, Mdcp, Op and T 18) and five three-phase-equilibrium invariants (eutectic and peritectic at high <b>temperature,</b> <b>eutectoid</b> and peritectoid at low temperature). Kinetic studies reveal the crossover behaviour of the R 1 existed in a transient to metastable to stable phase, which the stability is affected by both composition and alkane chain length. Studies of the ternary C 18 /C 16 /kerosene system reveal a variety of different structures with compositions close to that of its pure components forming solid-solution in triclinic structures, whilst high relative fractions result in its formation of multiple phases (triclinic and two higher symmetry structures). Rotator induced crystallisation observed in melt phase crystallisation is also formed in solution crystallisation but only for C 18 /C 16 mixtures with its metastability depending on the composition. Solubility studies reveal the closest to the ideal condition with highest solubility in n-dodecane followed by kerosene and toluene respectively. Calculated activity coefficients reflect the non-identical phase formation in the solution phase with higher deviations for C 18 molar compositions of x= 0. 1, 0. 5 - 0. 7. Solvents type is not found to have any significant effect on its solid for structure behaviour for C 18 /C 16 mixtures. Crystallisation of C 18 /C 16 mixtures for most compositions in the three solvents are found to be mediated by progressive nucleation mechanism. Cases of instantaneous nucleation are also seen in particularly compositions with higher C 18 concentration. Progressive nucleation reveals well correlated with wider metastable zone width and concomitant larger interfacial tension (1. 33 - 1. 64 mJ/m^ 2). Higher solubility is found to accelerate the instantaneous nucleation by increasing effective solute concentration, whilst inhibit the progressive nucleation by causing larger interfacial tension. ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{purpose of}} heat {{treating}} carbon steel {{is to change}} the mechanical properties of steel, usually ductility, hardness, yield strength, or impact resistance. Note that the electrical and thermal conductivity are only slightly altered. As with most strengthening techniques for steel, Young's modulus (elasticity) is unaffected. All treatments of steel trade ductility for increased strength and vice versa. Iron has a higher solubility for carbon in the austenite phase; therefore all heat treatments, except spheroidizing and process annealing, start by heating the steel to a temperature at which the austenitic phase can exist. The steel is then quenched (heat drawn out) at a moderate to low rate allowing carbon to diffuse out of the austenite forming iron-carbide (cementite) to precipitate leaving ferrite, or at a high rate, trapping the carbon within the iron thus forming martensite. The rate at which the steel is cooled through the <b>eutectoid</b> <b>temperature</b> (about 727°C) affects the rate at which carbon diffuses out of austenite and forms cementite. Generally speaking, cooling swiftly will leave iron carbide finely dispersed and produce a fine grained pearlite and cooling slowly will give a coarser pearlite. Cooling a hypoeutectoid steel (less than 0.77 wt% C) results in a lamellar-pearlitic structure of iron carbide layers with α-ferrite (nearly pure iron) between. If it is hypereutectoid steel (more than 0.77 wt% C) then the structure is full pearlite with small grains (larger than the pearlite lamella) of cementite formed on the grain boundaries. A eutectoid steel (0.77% carbon) will have a pearlite structure throughout the grains with no cementite at the boundaries. The relative amounts of constituents are found using the lever rule. The following is a list of the types of heat treatments possible: ...|$|E

30|$|The {{presence}} of alloying elements significantly affects the phase transformation kinetics. At the atomic level, {{almost all the}} commonly used alloying elements (with the exception of cobalt, which is too expensive {{to be considered in}} steel wheels) tend to delay the transformation to pearlite and allow the austenitic structure to persist to lower temperatures during cooling. This is equivalent to increasing undercooling. Since the effect of these alloying elements is essentially to retard carbon redistribution, the solute additions used to delay pearlite transformation also slow down the spheroidisation process. Another way to further increase the undercooling is to add elements that raise <b>eutectoid</b> <b>temperature,</b> so a higher driving force is provided at a same given temperature. Coincidently, the increased <b>eutectoid</b> <b>temperature</b> serves the same purpose as increasing re-austenitisation temperature that reduces martensite formation tendency. Due to these common features, the selection of alloying compositions should aim to delay pearlite transformation and raise <b>eutectoid</b> <b>temperature.</b> It is emphasised again that delay and acceleration of pearlite transformation cannot be achieved together by manipulating alloying elements.|$|E

The effect of aging treatments below the <b>eutectoid</b> <b>temperature</b> on both RS and IM microstructures was also studied...|$|E
40|$|On-heating {{transformation}} kinetics were investigated for several steels {{by using a}} Gleeble capable of programmable power input as well as programmable temperature cycling. Transformation kinetics determined in both modes are reported. The temperature cycles are significantly different between the two modes due to the latent heat associated with the phase transformations. Both diffusion rates and transformation driving force increase with temperature above the <b>eutectoid</b> <b>temperature,</b> therefore the latent heat can potentially {{have a significant impact}} on the {{transformation kinetics}}. Experiments with plain carbon steels illustrate that the latent heat of austenite formation causes an appreciable temperature arrest during transformation, and the dilatation response is similarly altered. A kinetic transformation model, based on the decomposition of pearlite and the diffusional growth of austenite, reproduced the transient dilatation data obtained from both control modes reasonably well using the same kinetic parameter values...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Effects of high {{magnetic}} fields (HMF) up to 19. 81 T on pearlite phase transformation are studied by {{examination of the}} microstructures of a Fe- 0. 47 C- 2. 3 Si- 3. 2 Mn (wt %) alloy partially isothermally processed above the <b>eutectoid</b> <b>temperature.</b> The results show that granular pearlite (GP) can be obtained at earlier transformation stages. The evolution of the granular pearlite is always accompanied by the formation of lamellar pearlite. TEM analysis reveals the existence of sub-grain boundaries within GP colonies and indicates that the nucleation of ferrite matrix in GP belongs to multiple nucleation mechanism. Most of carbides at the early stage of pearlite formation are found to precipitate at the α/γ interface [...] the growing front of ferrite phases, and some of coarse carbides can further develop into thin lamellar cementite...|$|E
40|$|The {{coarsening}} behaviour of a unidirectionally transformed Cu-In eutectoid alloy {{has been}} studied at 829 K (0 · 98 T where T is the <b>eutectoid</b> <b>temperature).</b> The as-transformed microstructure consisted of nearly perfect alternating lamellae of α-and δ-phasesaligned generally in the growth direction, but contained lamellae terminations and fault lines, or mismatch surfaces; a characteristic zig-zag lamellar structure was also occasionally observed. Ageing the as-transformed structure resulted in two mechanisms of microstructural coarsening: a continuous reaction within the grains, and a discontinuous reaction at the grain boundaries. The kinetics of the continuous coarsening reaction were consistent with a diffusion-controlled fault migration mechanism. Only {{a limited amount of}} discontinuous coarsening occurred at 0 · 98 T. The coarsening ratio, the ratio of the interlamellar spacing of the discontinuously coarsened lamellae to the original lamellae, was measured as 3 · 3 ± 0 · 4...|$|E
