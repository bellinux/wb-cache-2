40|$|Nandrolone, an {{anabolic}} steroid, is {{used for}} the treatment of several diseases and is available in various pharmaceutical formulations. The most widely used pharmaceutical formulation is Deca-Durabolin (R), but other products, such as Keratyl (R) <b>eye</b> <b>drops</b> <b>solution,</b> are also currently administered. Nandrolone {{is one of the most}} abused anabolic steroid in sports. Analyses for this anabolic steroid according to the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) protocol are based on the identification of the nandrolone two main urinary metabolites which, in humans, are glucuronides of 19 -norandrosterone and 19 -noretiocholanolone. A positive cut off limit of 2 ng/mL has been set by the anti-doping code for the first metabolite, 19 -norandrosterone. In this preliminary study, an <b>eye</b> <b>drops</b> <b>solution</b> (Keratyl (R)) containing a therapeutic dose of a nandrolone sodium sulphate was administered to several male volunteers during 3 days and urines were collected during 3 weeks. Surprisingly, contrary to all expectations, the urinary concentrations measured in urines reached 450 ng/mL and 70 ng/mL for norandrosterone and noretiocholanolone, respectively. Moreover, concentration levels near to 2 ng/mL were found, more than 2 weeks after the last administration, depending on individual metabolism. Inter-variability as well as intra-variability of nandrolone excretion kinetic, regarding this particular administration mode, were also evaluated. Quantification of nandrolone metabolites was performed by GC-MS. The method was previously validated in terms of specificity, precision, linearity, LOD, LOQ, robustness, accuracy and the expanded uncertainty was also evaluated...|$|E

Topically applied carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (CAIs) in <b>eye</b> <b>drop</b> <b>solutions</b> are commonly used to treat glaucoma. However, local eye irritation and multiple daily administrations may hamper their clinical usefulness. Aqueous <b>eye</b> <b>drop</b> formulations that improve their topical bioavailability and reduce their eye irritation can improve their clinical efficacy. Earlier studies showed that dorzolamide and closely related CAIs are more effectively delivered into the eye from acidic <b>eye</b> <b>drop</b> <b>solutions</b> than from comparable neutral solutions. Consequently, dorzolamide was marketed as an aqueous pH 5. 6 <b>eye</b> <b>drop</b> <b>solution</b> (Trusopt(®), Merck). Later, it was shown that increasing the pH of the <b>eye</b> <b>drops</b> from pH 5. 6 to physiologic pH significantly reduced their local irritation. Earlier attempts to use cyclodextrins (CDs) as ocular penetration enhancers in dorzolamide <b>eye</b> <b>drop</b> <b>solutions</b> failed since; although the CDs were able to enhance the aqueous solubility of dorzolamide, increasing the pH from 5. 6 to physiologic pH reduced {{the ability of the}} drug to permeate into the eye. Later, it was discovered that formulating the drug as aqueous dorzolamide/γCD <b>eye</b> <b>drop</b> microparticle suspension resulted in significant bioavailability enhancement. The solid dorzolamide/γCD microparticles are mucoadhesive and release dorzolamide into the aqueous tear fluid for extended time period. Consequently, sustained high dorzolamide concentrations in aqueous humour and various eye tissues were observed after single administration of the aqueous dorzolamide/γCD <b>eye</b> <b>drop</b> microsuspension.

(Homoeopathy) Abstract: Computer-induced {{asthenopia}} (eyestrain) {{is defined}} as fatigue of the ciliary and extraocular muscles from prolonged near vision work on a visual display unit (Tiwari et al., 2011). Common symptoms associated with asthenopia include: ocular discomfort; dry, red, itchy or irritated eyes; eye fatigue; intermittent diplopia at near fixation; blurred vision; and frontal headache (Sheedy et al., 2003). About 70 % of computer user’s worldwide experience eye discomfort and there are {{an increasing number of}} people affected by it (Barthakar, 2013). Current conventional treatment for asthenopia involves ergonomic measures, <b>eye</b> <b>drops</b> to help with eye moisture, occupational glasses, correction of refractive errors and punctal occlusion (Garin, 2014). The homoeopathic complex <b>eye</b> <b>drop</b> <b>solution</b> is a commercially available <b>eye</b> <b>drop</b> <b>solution</b> indicated for the relief of computer-induced asthenopia symptoms and contains Conium maculatum 6 X, Natrum chloratum 6 X, Ruta graveolens 6 Xand Senega officinalis 6 X.

The aim {{of the study was to}} determine the effect of a homoeopathic complex <b>eye</b> <b>drop</b> <b>solution</b> on the symptoms of computer-induced asthenopia using a Symptom Index Questionnaire. This was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, one day study. The study took place at the University of Johannesburg (UJ) Doornfontein campus. Fifty participants between the ages of 18 - 35 years were recruited by means of purposive sampling. The sample group was shared with another researcher focusing on rating ocular discomfort using a visual analogue scale and assessing tear breakup time (TBUT). Participants were recruited by means of advertisements placed at the UJ Doornfontein campus with permission given. An initial consultation took place at the UJ Optometry Clinic; all potential participants were requested to read and sign the Participant Information and Consent Form and complete the Participant Selection Questionnaire. The participants who met the criteria were screened for any refractive errors using an autorefractor by a qualified optometrist. The participants who had significant refractive errors were excluded from the study. Participants proceeded to the computer lab at UJ to play a computer game for a two hour period, after which they then completed the Symptom Index Questionnaire (SIQ), evaluating the symptoms of asthenopia.

METHODS: Twenty cataract patients who underwent phacoemulsification and intraocular lens implantation were randomly divided into two postoperative treatment groups. Postoperative medication in group I included 0. 1 % dexamethasone sodium phosphate <b>eye</b> <b>drops</b> three times daily and in group II 0. 7 % dexamethasone-cyclodextrin <b>eye</b> <b>drop</b> <b>solution</b> once daily. Testing of visual acuity, biomicroscopic examination, applanation tonometry and laser flare cell meter (LFCM) examination were carried out before operation and days 1, 3, 7 and 21 after surgery. RESULTS: Preoperative and postoperative visual acuity, aqueous flare and cells in biomicroscopic examination, and the mean intraocular pressure did not show any statistically significant differences between the treatment groups. LFCM examination showed that the mean postoperative photon count values (P= 0. 032) and the median cell count values on the 1 st (P= 0. 014), 3 rd (P= 0. 031), 7 th (P= 0. 034), and 21 st (P= 0. 0097) postoperative days in group I were more elevated than in group II.

40|$|Abstract: Visual {{display units}} (VDU’s) such as laptops, tablets, smartphones, computers, game {{consoles}} and televisions {{have become an}} essential part of our modern life both in school and at work places (Izquierdo & Townsend, 2008). Up to 90 % of computer users may experience visual symptoms {{at one time or another}} with the use of VDU’s (Barthakur, 2013). Asthenopia (eyestrain) is typically associated with near-work and symptoms include dry eyes, eye fatigue and difficulty focusing. The major cause of computer-induced asthenopia is fatigue of the ciliary and extra-ocular muscles due to prolonged accommodation and vergence required by near-vision work (Tiwari et al., 2011). The severity of the symptoms is proportional to the time spent using a VDU device and symptoms are substantially reduced after discontinuing usage; even so, the symptoms can affect work productivity and quality of life (Barthakur, 2013). Conventional treatment for asthenopia includes correction of refractive errors, use of occupational glasses, <b>eye</b> <b>drops</b> and punctal occlusion (Garin, 2014); ergonomic measures can also be helpful (Barthakur, 2013). Homoeopathy is a holistic treatment modality based on the “Law of Similars” (Dekkers, 2009). Homoeopathic remedies enhance the body’s own curative abilities, enabling the body to heal itself (Ahmad, 2005). Homoeopathic remedies may provide a safe complementary treatment option for asthenopia.

40|$|Cyclodextrins are cyclic {{oligosaccharides}} {{that are}} able to form water-soluble complexes with many lipophilic drugs. Thus, through cyclodextrin complexation it is possible to formulate lipophilic water-insoluble drugs as aqueous <b>eye</b> <b>drop</b> <b>solutions.</b> The ocular barrier to topical drug delivery into the eye consists of the aqueous tear film and lipophilic epithelium, and most drugs permeate this barrier via passive diffusion. Cyclodextrins enhance permeation of lipophilic drugs through the aqueous tear film to the epithelial surface increasing drug availability immediately to the membrane surface. However, since hydrophilic cyclodextrins and cyclodextrin complexes do not readily permeate lipophilic membranes, excess amounts of cyclodextrin will hamper drug penetration into the eye.

In this study, we evaluated the efficacy {{of a combination of}} sodium hyaluronate and autologous serum <b>eye</b> <b>drops</b> and treatment for obstructive meibomian gland dysfunction as a therapy for late-onset bleb leaks after trabeculectomy with mitomycin C. Methods: This was a retrospective, interventional, nonsimultaneous study of 12 subjects (12 eyes) of mean age of 64. 3 &plusmn; 18. 3 years with OSD and apparent late-onset bleb leaks following trabeculectomy with mitomycin C between 1998 and 2008. We compared patients diagnosed with leakages before July 2005, who had been treated with separate <b>eye</b> <b>drop</b> <b>solutions</b> containing 0. 1 % sodium hyaluronate, 50 % autologous serum, and 0. 3 % ofloxacin (sodium hyaluronate and autologous serum group, n = 7), with patients diagnosed from August 2005 to December 2008, who were treated with a combination of <b>eye</b> <b>drops</b> (0. 1 % sodium hyaluronate, 50 % autologous serum, and 0. 08 % levofloxacin hydrate) and eyelid massage and warm compresses for obstructive meibomian gland dysfunction (combination <b>eye</b> <b>drop</b> group, n = 5). Results: Leakage was resolved in one patient (14. 3 %) in the separately treated sodium hyaluronate and autologous serum <b>eye</b> <b>drop</b> group and in five patients (100 %) in the combination <b>eye</b> <b>drop</b> group (P = 0. 015). The period after resolution of leakage with conservative treatment was 23 months in the one eye in the sodium hyaluronate and autologous serum group and 36 &ndash; 61 (mean 52. 4 &plusmn; 10. 1) months in the five eyes in the combination <b>eye</b> <b>drop</b> group. Conclusion: Late-onset bleb leaks following trabeculectomy with mitomycin C can be treated effectively using a combination of sodium hyaluronate and autologous serum <b>eye</b> <b>drops,</b> eyelid massage, and warm compresses.

40|$|Ophthalmic {{delivery}} {{systems such as}} ocular inserts are useful strategies to improve the ocular bioavailability of topically administered drugs. In the present study polyvinyl alcohol and sodium carboxymethylcellulose based ocular inserts were prepared by solution casting for sustained drug delivery of ciprofloxacin for treatment of topical infections. The polymers were esterified {{and the formation of}} ester bonds was confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The inserts had a smooth structure with a surface roughness of 7. 3 nm. Inserts were found to be wettable by simulated tear fluid with contact angle < 45 degrees. Mechanical testing results indicated that the tensile strength of polyvinyl alcohol-sodium carboxymethylcellulose (10 : 2 wt. %) inserts was up to 8. 9 +/- 1. 9 MPa. which is adequate to resist the pressure likely to be exerted during application. In vitro drug release kinetics showed sustained release of ciprofloxacin for up to 48 h from the inserts.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{feasibility}} of using irreversible electroporation (IRE) as a non-chemical method for eliminating microorganisms of liquid drugs. The studied drug was a topical ophthalmic medication, a pharmaceutical field in which the problem of microbial contamination has not yet been adequately solved, especially in the case of <b>eye</b> <b>drops</b> prescribed for chronic use. Commercially available Hylo-Comod® preservative-free <b>eye</b> <b>drop</b> <b>solution</b> was subjected to contamination with Escherichia coli bacteria (106 colony forming units/mL). Electroporation parameters for bacterial control were investigated by comparing the effects of electrical fields of 5. 4, 7. 2, and 10  kV/cm, delivered as 100 -µs square pulses at 1  Hz in sequences of 10 pulses, 20 pulses, or 20 pulses delivered as four sets of five pulses with 1 -min intervals between each set. Microorganism survival after treatment was determined by pour plate counting. Effects of the treatment parameters on temperature and pH were recorded. Bacterial survival was lowest (0. 14 %[*]±[*] 0. 03 %) after application of 20 pulses delivered as four separate sets. With that application mode, the solution remained at pH 7. 5 and the temperature rose to 35. 6 °[*]±[*] 0. 2 °C. Because IRE can be efficiently delivered under conditions that avoid the potentially deleterious effects of electrical pulses on temperature and pH, it appears to be a feasible method for bacterial control of drugs in solution. The principles established in this study can be applied to any drug in solution and optimized individually according to the solution's composition...|$|R
40|$|Purpose. Lubricant <b>eye</b> <b>drops</b> that restore {{physiological}} osmolarity {{represent a}} promising strategy for dry eye syndrome as hyperosmolarity plays {{a central role}} in this disease. This preliminary study compared three lubricant <b>eye</b> <b>drop</b> <b>solutions</b> with different osmolarities and compositions in subjects with this condition. Methods. Subjects with dry eye syndrome undergoing treatment with benzalkonium chloride-containing lubricant <b>eye</b> <b>drops</b> were randomized to Carnidrop (n = 9), Optive (n = 9), or Blu Sal (n = 9). Fluorescein break-up time (FBUT) and Ocular Protection Index (OPI) were measured at baseline, 15 min, and 60 min after instillation to evaluate the stability and quality of the tear film. Results. At 15 min, a significant increase in FBUT vs. baseline was reported with Carnidrop (from 2. 0 +/- 0. 8 to 4. 8 +/- 2. 0; p = 0. 004) but not in patients who received Optive or Blu Sal. At 60 min, FBUT was significantly increased vs. baseline with Carnidrop (from 2. 0 +/- 0. 8 to 6. 0 +/- 2. 8, p = 0. 001) and Optive (from 2. 9 +/- 2. 8 to 4. 3 +/- 2. 9, p = 0. 004) but not with Blu Sal. At 15 min, OPI was significantly increased from baseline in only the Carnidrop group (from 0. 4 +/- 0. 2 to 1. 0 +/- 0. 4, p = 0. 003). This increase was significantly greater with Carnidrop than with Blu Sal (p = 0. 003). At the 60 min evaluation, OPI remained significantly increased from baseline in only the Carnidrop group (p = 0. 003). Conclusions. Carnidrop produces a larger increase in FBUT and OPI than Optive and Blu Sal in subjects with dry eye syndrome over a 1 h period, possibly because of its hypo-osmolarity and high osmolyte (in particular l-carnitine) content. The instillation of compounds that improve the quality and stability of the tear film, which are impaired in dry eye syndrome, could be effective in the treatment of this conditio...|$|R

The parent compound 39 exhibited a good inhibitory activity with an IC 50 value of 0. 85 μM, {{similar to that}} of the well-known ARI sorbinil (IC 50 0. 50 μM). The concurrent introduction of a halogen and a lipophilic group in the 5 - and in the 1 -positions, respectively, of the indole nucleus of 39, gave compound 55, cyano[5 -fluoro- 1 -(4 -methylbenzyl) - 2 -oxo- 2, 3 -dihydroindol- 3 -yl] acetic acid, which displayed the highest activity (IC 50 0. 075 μM, very close to that of tolrestat IC 50 0. 046 μM), with a good selectivity toward ALR 2 compared with aldehyde reductase (ALR 1) (16. 4 -fold), and no appreciable inhibitory properties against sorbitol dehydrogenase (SD), or glutathione reductase (GR). The isopropyl ester 59, a prodrug of 55, was found to be almost as effective as tolrestat in preventing cataract development in severely galactosemic rats when administered as an <b>eye</b> <b>drop</b> <b>solution.</b> Docking simulation of 55 into a three-dimensional model of human ALR 2 made it possible to formulate the hypothesis that the 2 -hydroxy tautomer was the active species binding into the catalytic site of the enzyme.

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this study}} is to {{evaluate}} the therapeutic potential of a newly synthesized calpain inhibitor, CAT 0059, using a naturally occurring in vivo sheep cataract model. Methods: The selectivity of CAT 0059 was investigated by an in vitro protease assay. The efficacy of CAT 0059 in preventing proteolysis of lens cytoskeletal proteins by calpain 2 was investigated using a lens-based cell-free method. The cytotoxicity and stability of CAT 0059 in physiological conditions were examined using cultured sheep lenses. Protein binding of CAT 0059 by ocular proteins was assessed and quantified by a modified high-performance liquid chromatography assay. CAT 0059 was formulated in an <b>eye</b> <b>drop</b> <b>solution</b> and as an eye ointment. These were applied in vivo daily to one eye of the cataract lambs, over a 67 - and 97 -day trial period, respectively. The progression of cataracts in the treated and untreated eyes was assessed by an independent veterinary ophthalmologist using a slit-lamp microscope. Results: In vitro assays revealed that CAT 0059 was selective for cysteine proteases and also protected lens cytoskeletal proteins from degradation. CAT 0059 was stable in physiological conditions and non-toxic to the lens. Only 15 % of CAT 0059 is bound to proteins in the aqueous humour but > 90 % bound to lens homogenate. The 67 -day CAT 0059 <b>eye</b> <b>drop</b> treatment was not effective in slowing the rate of cataract development. However, application of CAT 0059 in an eye ointment initially slowed cataract development compared with the untreated eye. This effect was temporary. Conclusions: In vitro assays confirmed CAT 0059 to be a potent calpain inhibitor. The two in vivo trials addressed the ability of CAT 0059 to reach the lens and established its limitations as a therapeutic molecule for cataract treatment.

A control group was given deionised water as <b>eye</b> <b>drops</b> and the other groups of rabbits were given <b>eye</b> <b>drops</b> of <b>solution</b> of 2 mg kg - 1 body wt. cadmium (as 3 CdSO 4. 8 H 2 O). The control and a test group were fed with the normal chow and animals in the other test groups were fed with the chow fortified with either 5 % or 10 % palm oil. Treatment of the rabbit with cadmium significantly (p< 0. 05) reduced their weight compared with the control and PO supplementations of the diets improved the weights of the animals. Brain, liver and kidney levels of lipid peroxidation were raised by cadmium and PO significantly (p< 0. 05) reduced the level of lipid peroxidation of these tissues. Cadmium significantly (p< 0. 05) reduced antioxidant enzymes and ATPases in the tissues compared with the control. Feeding the rabbits with PO significantly (p< 0. 05) increased the activities of these enzymes to levels comparable with the control, with the 10 % supplementation producing a more pronounced effect.

40|$|Purpose: In this study, we {{investigated}} the biochemical pharmacology of pirenoxine (PRX) and catalin under in vitro selenite/calcium- and ultraviolet (UV) -induced lens protein turbidity challenges. The systemic effects of catalin were determined using a selenite-induced cataractogenesis rat model. Methods: In vitro cataractogenesis assay systems (including UVB/C photo-oxidation of lens crystallins, calpain-induced proteolysis, and selenite/calcium-induced turbidity of lens crystallin solutions) {{were used to}} screen the activity of PRX and catalin <b>eye</b> <b>drop</b> <b>solutions.</b> Turbidity was identified as the optical density measured using spectroscopy at 405 nm. We also determined the in vivo effects of catalin on cataract severity in a selenite-induced cataract rat model. Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS–PAGE) was applied to analyze the integrity of crystallin samples. Results: PRX at 1, 000 μM significantly delayed UVC-induced turbidity formation compared to controls after 4 h of UVC exposure (p< 0. 05), but not in groups incubated with PRX concentrations of < 1, 000 μM. Results were further confirmed by SDS–PAGE. The absolute γ-crystallin turbidity induced by 4 h of UVC exposure was ameliorated {{in the presence of}} catalin equivalent to 1 ~ 100 μM PRX in a concentration-dependent manner. Samples with catalin-formulated vehicle only (CataV) and those containing PRX equivalent to 100 μM had a similar protective effect after 4 h of UVC exposure compared to the controls (p< 0. 05). PRX at 0. 03, 0. 1, and 0. 3 μM significantly delayed 10 mM selenite- and calcium-induced turbidity formation compared to controls on days 0 ~ 4 (p< 0. 05). Catalin (equivalent to 32, 80, and 100 μM PRX) had an initial protective effect against selenite-induced lens protein turbidity on day 1 (p< 0. 05). Subcutaneous pretreatment with catalin (5 mg/kg) also statistically decreased the mean cataract scores in selenite-induced cataract rats on post-induction day 3 compared to the controls (1. 3 ± 0. 2 versus 2. 4 ± 0. 4; p< 0. 05). However, catalin (equivalent to up to 100 μM PRX) did not inhibit calpain-induced proteolysis activated by calcium, and neither did 100 μM PRX. Conclusions: PRX at micromolar levels ameliorated selenite- and calcium-induced lens protein turbidity but required millimolar levels to protect against UVC irradiation. The observed inhibition of UVC-induced turbidity of lens crystallins by catalin at micromolar concentrations may have been a result of the catalin-formulated vehicle. Transient protection by catalin against selenite-induced turbidity of crystallin solutions in vitro was supported by the ameliorated cataract scores in the early stage of cataractogenesis in vivo by subcutaneously administered catalin. PRX could not inhibit calpain-induced proteolysis activated by calcium or catalin itself, and may be detrimental to crystallins under UVB exposure. Further studies on formulation modifications of catalin and recommended doses of PRX to optimize clinical efficacy by cataract type are warranted. Peer reviewe...|$|R
