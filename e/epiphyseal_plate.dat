5|$|In skeletally {{immature}} individuals, {{the blood}} supply to the epiphyseal bone is good, supporting both osteogenesis and chondrogenesis. With disruption of the <b>epiphyseal</b> <b>plate</b> vessels, varying degrees and depth of necrosis occur, resulting in a cessation of growth to both osteocytes and chondrocytes. In turn, this pattern leads to disordered ossification of cartilage, resulting in subchondral avascular necrosis and consequently OCD.|$|E
2500|$|Endochondral {{ossification}} {{begins with}} {{points in the}} cartilage called [...] "primary ossification centers." [...] They mostly appear during fetal development, though a few short bones begin their primary ossification after birth. [...] They {{are responsible for the}} formation of the diaphyses of long bones, short bones and certain parts of irregular bones. [...] Secondary ossification occurs after birth, and forms the epiphyses of long bones and the extremities of irregular and flat bones. [...] The diaphysis and both epiphyses of a long bone are separated by a growing zone of cartilage (the <b>epiphyseal</b> <b>plate).</b> At skeletal maturity (18 to 25 years of age), all of the cartilage is replaced by bone, fusing the diaphysis and both epiphyses together (epiphyseal closure). In the upper limbs, only the diaphyses of the long bones and scapula are ossified. [...] The epiphyses, carpal bones, coracoid process, medial border of the scapula, and acromion are still cartilaginous.|$|E

40|$|The {{growth and}} {{structure}} of <b>epiphyseal</b> <b>plates</b> was studied in normal kittens, and in kittens given an excess of vitamin A for 7 days prior to necropsy. Growth measurements were made on 10 different <b>epiphyseal</b> <b>plates</b> from each animal by means of in vivo labelling with a fluorescentdye. It {{was found that the}} growth of all plates was retarded in kittens which had received an excess of vitamin A. The absolute retardation of growth of each plate was directly proportional to its normal rate of growth as assessed in the control animals. The opposite limbs of each kitten were used for the study of histopathological changes and the measurement of various cellular parameters. <b>Epiphyseal</b> <b>plates</b> from the test animals were reduced in depth, contained fewer chondrocytes arranged in shorter, irregular columns and the hypertrophic cells were smaller. The cartilaginous matrix exhibited a diffuse loss of basophilia and of metachromasia, and coarse fibrillation. Measurements of growth rate and various cellular parameters were used to calculate the rate of cell formation per column and the average cell life span in <b>epiphyseal</b> <b>plates</b> from the control animals. Owing to the rapid development of pathological changes upsetting the state of dynamic equilibrium in the test plates, similar estimations in these would not have been valid. However, arguments are presented to suggest that an excess of vitamin A retards the growth of <b>epiphyseal</b> <b>plates</b> by affecting the rate of formation of new chondrocytes and, either directly or indirectly, the maximum size reached by the chondrocytes in the hypertrophic cell zone. It was further concluded that, although differential susceptibility of certain <b>epiphyseal</b> <b>plates</b> to an excess of vitamin A has been reported in kittens dosed for longer periods, it is most likely that vitamin A primarily affects <b>epiphyseal</b> <b>plates</b> in proportion to their normal rates of growth. With increasing time secondary factors probably act on the abnormal plates, accounting for differences in the severity of lesions exhibited by them. Reasons are put forward to suggest that the stress of weight bearing may well be the most important factor involved in this process...|$|R

50|$|A unicameral bone cyst, {{also known}} as a simple bone cyst, is a cavity filled with a yellow-colored fluid. It is {{considered}} to be benign since it does not spread beyond the bone. Unicameral bone cysts can be classified into two categories: active and latent. An active cyst is adjacent to the <b>epiphyseal</b> <b>plate</b> and tends to grow until it fills the entire diaphysis, the shaft, of the bone; depending on the invasiveness of the cyst, it can cause a pathological fracture or even destroy the <b>epiphyseal</b> <b>plate</b> leading to the permanent shortening of the bone. A latent cyst is located away from the <b>epiphyseal</b> <b>plate</b> and is more likely to heal with treatment. It is typically diagnosed in children from the aged 5 to 15. Although unicameral bone cysts can form in any bone structure, it is predominantly found in the proximal humerus and proximal femur; additionally, it affects males twice as often as females.|$|E

50|$|Endochondral {{ossification}} {{is responsible}} for the initial bone development from cartilage in utero and infants and the longitudinal growth of long bones in the <b>epiphyseal</b> <b>plate.</b> The plate's chondrocytes are under constant division by mitosis. These daughter cells stack facing the epiphysis while the older cells are pushed towards the diaphysis. As the older chondrocytes degenerate, osteoblasts ossify the remains to form new bone. In puberty increasing levels of estrogen, in both females and males, leads to increased apoptosis of chondrocytes in the <b>epiphyseal</b> <b>plate.</b> Depletion of chondrocytes due to apoptosis leads to less ossification and growth slows down and later stops when the entire cartilage have become replaced by bone, leaving only a thin epiphyseal scar which later disappears.|$|E

40|$|SummaryWe {{examined}} in vitro collagen biosynthesis by organ cultures from human fetal <b>epiphyseal</b> growth <b>plate</b> cartilage. The biosynthetic products {{were characterized by}} NaCl fractional precipitation, limited proteolytic digestion, and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide slab gel electrophoresis. Organ cultures of human fetal <b>epiphyseal</b> growth <b>plate</b> cartilage synthesized large amounts of type X collagen in addition to type II, type IX, and type XI collagens. The individual polypeptide chains of human type X collagen migrated with an apparent Mr of 45 kDa after proteolytic digestion with pepsin. The migration pattern of these molecules did not change when examined under reducing and nonreducing conditions, indicating {{that they did not}} contain intrahelical disulfide bonds. Comparison of the rates at type X collagen biosynthesis at weeks 20 and 24 of human fetal development showed a marked increase of 24 weeks. Northern hybridization analysis of total RNA from freshly isolated <b>epiphyseal</b> growth <b>plate</b> chondrocytes with a cDNA corresponding to the carboxyl terminus of human type X collagen indicated that the developmental increase of type X collagen production is determined by pre-translational mechanisms...|$|R
5|$|Horses, {{particularly}} colts, {{sometimes are}} physically capable of reproduction at about 18months, but domesticated horses are rarely allowed to breed {{before the age}} of three, especially females. Horses four years old are considered mature, although the skeleton normally continues to develop until the age of six; maturation also depends on the horse's size, breed, sex, and quality of care. Larger horses have larger bones; therefore, not only do the bones take longer to form bone tissue, but the <b>epiphyseal</b> <b>plates</b> are larger and take longer to convert from cartilage to bone. These plates convert after the other parts of the bones, and are crucial to development.|$|R
