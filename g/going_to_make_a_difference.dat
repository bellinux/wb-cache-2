40|$|The recent {{progress}} of the 3 G technology and the up-coming 3 G mobile telecommunication market environment of Korea were reviewed. On {{the basis of this}} knowledge, a simple system dynamics model was constructed. From the analysis of previous Korean mobile plethora, the model found that the network effect was the most important factor for the diffusion of mobile service in Korea. To investigate the competition on of 2 G and 3 G businesses, a more complicated model was designed. After its results, the initial large number of service contents of 3 G will be helpful for expanding its market share for a short term, and the degree of technology performance and social demand is more helpful for a long term business. The model says the success of 30 businesses is quite dependent on how to quickly and effectively switch 2 G subscribers into 3 G subscribers. To do that just early entree to the market is not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>difference</b> from 2 G services. The 3 G service providers have to decide whether it is right time to start the business by considering the technology performance differentiation from existing technology and the social need for bandwidth simultaneously. by Jae Hwang Yi.
