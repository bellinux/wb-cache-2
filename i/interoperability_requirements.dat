40|$|International audienceThe growing {{complexity}} of modern organisations poses {{a series of}} challenges, among them the cooperation between autonomous and heterogeneous information systems in distributed networks. Actually, Information Systems (IS) {{are said to be}} cooperative if they share common goals in their environment and jointly contribute to achieve these common goals. Obviously, this presupposes the ability to exchange information and then to use it in accordance with each information system required. In the literature, these features refer to interoperability. In this context, one of the main issues concerns the evaluation of the lack of interoperability between Cooperative Information Systems (CIS) through the measurement of their semantic gaps. In order to achieve this purpose, this paper proposes a mathematical formalisation of the semantic relationships between CIS conceptual models. The resulting formal model is then analysed for evaluating the lack of interoperability implications to the global information systems shared goals. The proposed approach is illustrated through a case study dealing with a B 2 M (Business to Manufacturing) <b>interoperability</b> <b>requirement</b> between an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system and a Manufacturing Execution System (MES) application...|$|R

40|$|International audienceNowadays, {{more and}} more the {{complexity}} of product has increased. Moreover, product development must meet all costumers' needs. This complexity has required the establishments of different patterns with additional enterprises to complement their skills. However, {{the definition of the}} different patterns with heterogeneous knowledge can share information is important to avoid the risk of misinterpretation. So, product requirements must consider all constraints during the product realization. In this way, researches have identified that there are different issues related to requirement analysis and maintenance during the product realisation. In order to cope with these issues, a conceptual approach to formally model the <b>requirements</b> <b>interoperability</b> is proposed in terms of transformations and traceability. Initially, the authors have proposed a characterisation of product to identify the <b>requirements</b> <b>interoperability</b> issues and the results were: (i) domains; (ii) product life cycle; and (iii) product requirements. Based on these characterisation, the conceptual approach used a formal logic descriptions and ontology application to transform requirements written in natural language to requirements written in formal language (mathematical language). As a result, the research presented an overview of the existing gaps in one or more <b>requirements</b> <b>interoperability</b> to cope with the requirements inconsistency problem in multiples perspectives in product development...|$|R
30|$|In {{terms of}} the {{middleware}} layer, its main shortcomings are its lack of compatibility to a standard specification and its dependency on a specific technology platform. These characteristics make these solutions inflexible, since once an application is developed to comply with such a middleware, the application cannot be migrated to other alternative solutions without major modifications. In this way, these solutions do not represent the desired <b>interoperability</b> (portability) <b>requirement.</b> The middleware presented in [7] overcomes this problem by offering HA at the application level by using an open-source and standardized implementation, named OpenSAF, which is a flexible and platform-independent solution.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Military {{tactical}} {{communications systems}} will be facing great {{challenges in the}} near future. Performance of commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) technologies is improving at fast pace {{while at the same}} time life cycles of military equipment seem to remain long. The goal of this paper is to highlight a few interesting applications where development efforts of cognitive radio (CR), wireless sensor networks (WSNs), mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) and commercial communications technologies would provide practical solutions from military point of view. The further work will focus on evaluation of CR as a part of heterogeneous military network. Importance of situational awareness on tactics and different technologies and their correspondence to tactical applications are discussed. Cognitive radio will find many applications in tactical networks but technical readiness is still lacking in some areas. A key issue in understanding the requirements of tactical networks is that the latest technology that is the most capable is not necessarily the most appropriate alternative. The focus should be on technologies whose effects on own actions and systems are understood thoroughly. This paper sets the groundwork for the research that aims at answering the question of what kind of military communications system should be built in the future if there are several requirements that limit the solution alternatives. The requirements to be considered are: 1) cost limitation, 2) limitation on number of units, 3) <b>interoperability</b> <b>requirement,</b> 4) mobility requirement and 5) performance requirement.
