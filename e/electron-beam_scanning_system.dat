The reasons these steps led to significant improvements in patterning resolution are discussed. IST/Imaging Science and TechnologyApplied Science...|$|R

40|$|The {{detection}} of surface particles has become important in contamination {{control over the}} years. However, the minimum particle size required to be detected has been becoming smaller as IC geometries shrink. Current visible-light detection systems can detect particles down to around 60 nm in polystyrene-latex-equivalent size and so should be adequate for geometries down to around 0. 18 µm, but {{a quick glance at}} the National Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors shows that geometries are expected to become as small as 0. 07 µm in a little over ten years, requiring the ability to detect particles around 20 nm in diameter. This is beyond the capability of current visible-light scanners, so the Semiconductor Research Corporation has recently commissioned our group to conduct research into the limits of optical defect detection and potential of alternative detection technologies. This research centers on short-wavelength optical <b>systems</b> and <b>scanned</b> <b>electron-beam</b> <b>systems</b> as the most likely candidate technologies for high-speed nanoparticle detection.

Usually a CeD vision system is a necessary part for these systems. This thesis considers the design of a fast mechanical <b>scanning</b> <b>system</b> for a CCD vision system and the synthesis of the optimal control for this system. The mathematical model of the transport subsystem for mobile robots subjected to an external disturbance is created. The correctness of this model is proved on the base of simulation and experimental results. Regression coefficients are calculated and an estimate of model accuracy is carried out. The approach of power calculation for the actuators for the fast mechanical <b>scanning</b> <b>system</b> is considered. Implementation of this approach extends the use of a general mathematical model of the transport subsystem of the mobile robot and as such considerably reduces the design time. The main features for estimation of external disturbances are determined. Limitations of implementation of some technical solutions for mobile robot sensors are defined according to an analysis conducted of different factors for external disturbances. Di erent kinematic schemes of the <b>scanning</b> <b>systems</b> have been analysed in this thesis. Practical recommendations of the kinematic scheme used in <b>scanning</b> <b>systems</b> are given. The essential features of a kinematic scheme for the fast mechanical <b>scanning</b> <b>system</b> have been developed and verified.

To satisfy these demands with regard to a <b>scanning</b> <b>system,</b> a new mechanical target <b>scanning</b> <b>system</b> was developed and tested. Concept In contrast to the magnet raster <b>scanning</b> <b>system,</b> where the beam is actively moved to the next raster point when the planned number of particles is detected [2], the target scanner moves the target to the appropriate position using fast, position controlled, linear motors [3] and a special target holder. Operation method Digital inputs of the step motor drivers are wired to the NXT-output (Next Point), which is sent if a raster point’s planned number of particles is reached, of SAMS [4]. The drivers are programmed in a way that, that each time they detect a NXT signal the target is moved one step in the horizontal direction. After a planned number of signals occurred, the drivers trigger a line break and a new line is irradiated.

Systems used {{so far in the}} literature for scanning a focused laser spot on a substrate are: (a) galvanomirror preobjective scanning, (b) galvanomirror postobjective scanning and (c) 'off-axis' lens <b>scanning</b> <b>system</b> (originally proposed by coauthors). Major performance criteria due to end application, (say for example, to obtain high resolution microdevices in MSL) translates into the following criteria on optical scanning system: (i) uniform spot size and (ii) uniform intensity profile over the entire range of scan. This paper presents comparative optical analysis, both theoretical and experimental, of these systems based on the proposed performance criteria. Optical analysis of the optomechanical <b>scanning</b> <b>systems</b> is carried out by using geometric ray tracing method. Image evaluation in this case is done using diffraction wave optics. Simulations are carried out to determine spot characteristics at image plane when scan distances are changed by moving optics in the above mentioned optomechanical <b>scanning</b> <b>systems.</b> Simulation and experimental results clearly show that there is lesser distortion of spot characteristics (size and intensity profile) in case of proposed off-axis lens <b>scanning</b> <b>system</b> as compared to other <b>systems</b> over wider <b>scan</b> range.
