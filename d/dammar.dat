25|$|Many {{vegetable}} oils {{are used to}} make soaps, skin products, candles, perfumes and other personal care and cosmetic products. Some oils are particularly suitable as drying oils, and are used in making paints and other wood treatment products. <b>Dammar</b> oil (a mixture of linseed oil and <b>dammar</b> resin), for example, is used almost exclusively in treating the hulls of wooden boats. Vegetable oils are increasingly {{being used in the}} electrical industry as insulators as {{vegetable oils}} are not toxic to the environment, biodegradable if spilled and have high flash and fire points. However, vegetable oils are less stable chemically, so they are generally used in systems where they are not exposed to oxygen, and they are more expensive than crude oil distillate. Synthetic tetraesters, which are similar to vegetable oils but with four fatty acid chains compared to the normal three found in a natural ester, are manufactured by Fischer esterification. Tetraesters generally have high stability to oxidation and have found use as engine lubricants. Vegetable oil is being used to produce biodegradable hydraulic fluid and lubricant.|$|E
2500|$|According to a 2002 {{report by}} staff from the Yemeni Environment Protection Agency, there were 10 {{wastewater}} treatment plants in Yemen {{at the time in}} Sana’a, Taiz, Ibb, Hajaa, Aden, Amran, Al Hodaida, <b>Dammar,</b> Yarem, and Radaa. Most of the plants use the stabilization pond technology, a low-cost technology particularly suitable for a hot climate. Some use Imhoff tanks or the activated sludge procedure commonly used in many developed countries. While data on the quality of treated effluent are limited, those data that are available show that the effluent of at least two plants complies with the relatively lenient national standard of 150mg/l of Biological oxygen demand, a measure of organic pollution. However, none of the four analyzed plants complied with the standard for fecal coliform, a measure of biological contamination. Reuse of treated and untreated wastewater in agriculture is common in Yemen. Wastewater from hospitals and medical laboratories is discharged into the sewer system, but cannot be adequately treated in the existing municipal {{wastewater treatment plants}}. The largest wastewater treatment plant in the country, located in Sana'a, was completed in 2000, but it had to be upgraded between 2003 and 2005 due to [...] "deficiencies in its operation, unacceptable odor emissions, and inadequate management of the generated sludge".|$|E
50|$|The hard {{transparent}} resins, {{such as the}} copals, <b>dammars,</b> mastic, and sandarac, are principally {{used for}} varnishes and adhesives, while the softer odoriferous oleo-resins (frankincense, elemi, turpentine, copaiba), and gum resins containing essential oils (ammoniacum, asafoetida, gamboge, myrrh, and scammony) are more used for therapeutic purposes and incense. The resin of the Aleppo Pine is used to flavour retsina, a Greek resinated wine.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Be {{it as it}} may, Jim's slumbers were {{disturbed}} by a dream of heavens like brass resounding with a great voice, which called upon him to Awake! Awake! so loud that, notwithstanding his desperate determination to sleep on, he did wake up in reality. The glare of a red spluttering conflagration going on in mid-air fell on his eyes. Coils of black thick smoke curved round the head of some apparition, some unearthly being, all in white, with a severe, drawn, anxious face. After a second or so he recognised the girl. She was holding a <b>dammar</b> torch at arm's-length aloft, and in a persistent, urgent monotone she was repeating, [...] "Get up! Get up! Get up!" ...|$|E
60|$|Afterwards, I found a path {{which led}} for {{a mile or}} more through a very fine forest, richer in palms than any I {{had seen in the}} Moluccas. One of these {{especially}} attracted my attention from its elegance. The stein was not thicker than my wrist, yet it was very lofty, and bore clusters of bright red fruit. It was apparently a species of Areca. Another of immense height closely resembled in appearance the Euterpes of South America. Here also grew the fan-leafed palm, whose small, nearly entire leaves are used to make the <b>dammar</b> torches, and to form the water-buckets in universal use. During this walk I saw near a dozen species of palms, as well as two or three Pandani different from those of Langundi. There were also some very fine climbing ferns and true wild Plantains (Musa), bearing an edible fruit not so large as one's thumb, and consisting of a mass of seeds just covered with pulp and skin. The people assured me they had tried the experiment of sowing and cultivating this species, but could not improve it. They probably did not grow it in sufficient quantity, and did not persevere sufficiently long.|$|E
6000|$|All {{along the}} beach here, and in the {{adjacent}} strip of sandy lowland, is a remarkable display of Pandanaceae or Screw-pines. Some are like huge branching candelabra, forty or fifty feet high, and bearing {{at the end of}} each branch a tuft of immense sword-shaped leaves, six or eight inches wide, and as many feet long. Others have a single unbranched stem, six or seven feet high, the upper part clothed with the spirally arranged leaves, and bearing a single terminal fruit ac large as a swan's egg. Others of intermediate size have irregular clusters of rough red fruits, and all have more or less spiny-edged leaves and ringed stems. The young plants of the larger species have smooth glossy thick leaves, sometimes ten feet long and eight inches wide, which are used all over the Moluccas and New Guinea, to make [...] "cocoyas" [...] or sleeping mats, which are often very prettily ornamented with coloured patterns. Higher up on the bill is a forest of immense trees, among which those producing the resin called <b>dammar</b> (Dammara sp.) are abundant. The inhabitants of several small villages in Batchian are entirely engaged in searching for this product, and making it into torches by pounding it and filling it into tubes of palm leaves about a yard long, which are the only lights used by many of the natives. Sometimes the <b>dammar</b> accumulates in large masses of ten or twenty pounds weight, either attached to the trunk, or found buried in the ground at the foot of the trees. The most extraordinary trees of the forest are, however, a kind of fig, the aerial roots of which form a pyramid near a hundred feet high, terminating just where the tree branches out above, so that there is no real trunk. This pyramid or cone is formed of roots of every size, mostly descending in straight lines, but more or less obliquely-and so crossing each other, and connected by cross branches, which grow from one to another; as to form a dense and complicated network, to which nothing but a photograph could do justice (see illustration at Vol. I. page 130). The Kanary is also abundant in this forest, the nut of which has a very agreeable flavour, and produces an excellent oil. The fleshy outer covering of the nut is the favourite food of the great green pigeons of these islands (Carpophaga, perspicillata), and their hoarse copings and heavy flutterings among the branches can be almost continually heard.|$|E
60|$|My first {{business}} was to send {{for the men}} who were accustomed to catch the Birds of Paradise. Several came, and I showed them my hatchets, beads, knives, and handkerchiefs; and explained to them, as well as I could by signs, the price I would give for fresh-killed specimens. It is the universal custom to pay for everything in advance; but only one man ventured on this occasion to take goods to the value of two birds. The rest were suspicious, and wanted to see the result of the first bargain with the strange white man, the only one who had ever come to their island. After three days, my man brought me the first bird--a very fine specimen, and alive, but tied up in a small bag, and consequently its tail and wing feathers very much crushed and injured. I tried to explain to him, and to the others that came with him, that I wanted them as perfect as possible, and that they should either kill them, or keep them on a perch with a string to their leg. As they were now apparently satisfied that all was fair, and that I had no ulterior designs upon them, six others took away goods; some for one bird, some for more, and one for as many as six. They said they had to go a long way for them, and that they would come back as soon as they caught any. At intervals of a few days or a week, some of them would return, bringing me one or more birds; but though they did not bring any more in bags, there was not much improvement in their condition. As they caught them a long way off in the forest, they would scarcely ever come with one, but would tie it by the leg to a stick, and put it in their house till they caught another. The poor creature would make violent efforts to escape, would get among the ashes, or hang suspended by the leg till the limb was swollen and half-putrefied, and sometimes die of starvation and worry. One had its beautiful head all defiled by pitch from a <b>dammar</b> torch; another had been so long dead that its stomach was turning green. Luckily, however, the skin and plumage of these birds is so firm and strong, that they bear washing and cleaning better than almost any other sort; and I was generally able to clean them so well that they did not perceptibly differ from those I had shot myself.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dammar</b> {{is used in}} foods, as a {{clouding}} or glazing agent, and in incense, varnish {{and other}} products. <b>Dammar</b> varnish, made from <b>dammar</b> gum mixed with turpentine, was introduced as a picture varnish in 1826; commonly used in oil painting, both during the painting process and after the painting is finished.|$|E

50|$|<b>Dammar</b> gum, or damar gum, is {{obtained}} from the Dipterocarpaceae family of trees in India and East Asia, principally those of the genera Shorea, Balanocarpus or Hopea. Most is produced by tapping trees; however, some is collected in fossilised form from the ground. The gum varies in colour from clear to pale yellow, while the fossilised form is grey-brown. <b>Dammar</b> gum is a triterpenoid resin, containing {{a large number of}} triterpenes and their oxidation products. Many of them are low molecular weight compounds (dammarane, dammarenolic acid, oleanane, oleanonic acid, etc.), but <b>dammar</b> also contains a polymeric fraction, composed of polycadinene.|$|E

Frightened by Talib's fate, Sanip confesses both his sins and Talib's. They establish camp and spend the night uneasily, worried that the tiger will attack.|$|E
5000|$|Many {{economically}} important timber trees {{belong to}} Shorea.

50|$|Seven <b>dammar</b> {{collectors}} from Air Jernih village, Pak Haji, Sutan, Sanip, Talib, Buyung, and Pak Balam, {{venture into}} the forests of Sumatra, led by the dukun Wak Katok. After two weeks collecting <b>dammar</b> and staying at Wak Hitam's nearby house, they prepare to return home. However, upon departure Buyung realizes that he has forgotten to check his kancil trap and returns to Wak Katok's. Upon his arrival, he removes the kancil from the trap and goes to a nearby stream to have a drink. At the stream, he meets Wak Hitam's young wife Siti Rubiyah, who is crying. After comforting her and giving her the kancil, they have sex two times. It is Buyung's first time. Buyung later arrives at the camp in the evening, just before maghrib prayers.|$|E

50|$|Fifty-year-old Wak Katok is {{the leader}} of the <b>dammar</b> {{collectors}} and a much-respected and feared dukun and pencak expert. He is the teacher of Buyung, Sutan, Sanip, and Talib. A charismatic leader, during the 1926 rebellion against the Dutch colonial government he committed war crimes, including rape, murder, and killing one of his injured soldiers so the rest of his unit could escape. Although prior to the tiger attacks all of the <b>dammar</b> collectors trust him, after the attacks begin he is slowly driven to insanity by worrying about the damage to his public image caused by his inability to stop them. After he kills Pak Haji, he is arrested by Buyung and Sanip, then used as bait for the tiger. He is to be turned over to the police upon arrival at Air Jernih village.|$|E
