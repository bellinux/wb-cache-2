5|$|Marge is irritated when Homer's snoring (so loud, it can {{be heard}} {{throughout}} most of the city) keeps <b>her</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> night. She sees Dr. Hibbert about the problem, and asks about a surgery, but he says it is expensive and tells them to get out when Homer asks him to do it for free. Developing a sleep problem, she sleeps for a night with Patty and Selma, and hears on the news that her old boyfriend, Artie Ziff, is one of America's five richest people. She drunkenly dictates an e-mail to Artie to congratulate him on his appearance, but Patty and Selma doctor it to use sexual terms in an attempt to split up Marge and Homer, much to Marge's horror (for using the word sex on the Internet). Artie, who over the years seems to have developed a rather frightening obsession with Marge (his house is decorated with a large number of 'Marge' sculptures/paintings), flies in his helicopter to the Simpson house to see Marge.|$|E

When Kathy tells Donna {{to stay away from}} Ian, Donna reveals that she is her daughter. Donna thinks Kathy will be pleased but Kathy is horrified and demands she leave Walford. Donna stays and causes various problems for Kathy. Finally Kathy tells Donna that she is actually the product of rape; Kathy gave <b>her</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> birth and wants {{nothing to do with her}} now. Donna spends the rest of the year in a downward spiral.|$|E

60|$|Ingleby, who lay nearest <b>her,</b> looked <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> with {{a little}} smile.|$|R
60|$|Birkin helped <b>her</b> <b>up,</b> amused <b>at</b> sending Gerald {{to sit by}} Gudrun in {{the body}} of the car.|$|R
6000|$|She looked <b>up</b> <b>at</b> {{him from}} where she sat as he could imagine <b>her</b> looking <b>up</b> <b>at</b> the curate at Bognor. [...] "Thank you, sir! If that's all you want----!" ...|$|R
500|$|When Leigh {{returned}} from the beach, she was bleeding between her legs, distressed, crying and seeking assistance. Some people at the party reported trying to console Leigh {{and find out what}} had happened to her; Leigh [...] "asserted she had been raped", replying [...] " [...] fucked me" [...] and [...] "I hate him". After witnessing Leigh's complaints, Webster is quoted as saying to a group of boys [...] "she's a bit of a slut and why don't all of us have a go". Nineteen-year-old Guy Wilson then approached Leigh, placed his arm around her and asked her for sex. Wilson pushed Leigh to the ground when she refused, and was joined by Webster and around ten other boys who surrounded Leigh. They yelled abuse, kicked her, poured beer on her and spat both beer and saliva on her. Several people witnessed the assault, yet nobody came to help her or attempted to contact the police, her parents or other adults. The assaults continued for approximately five minutes; Leigh stood up when they stopped and staggered away before picking up an empty beer bottle and throwing it at the group of boys, missing them. Guy Wilson threw a beer bottle back at her as she left, which either hit her in the leg or missed, according to different witness accounts. The group of boys followed her inside the crowded clubhouse where she sought refuge, and similar assaults continued. Leigh was seen leaving the club and walking towards the beach at about 10:30pm. Leigh's stepfather arrived at the party to pick <b>her</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> 10:50pm. He and several of the party-goers searched for Leigh, but she could not be found. After repeated search attempts, Leigh's mother and stepfather decided to wait for her to return home, assuming she had gone to a friend's house for the night. Leigh's stepfather recommenced the search for Leigh the following morning, aided by several youths from the party. Her body was found in the sand dunes about [...] north of the surf club. Leigh's invitation to attend the party was still in her pocket.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "Principal Officers and Commissioners of His Majesty's Navy" [...] sold Nile on 18 October 1810. However the {{purchaser}} {{withdrew from}} the sale. The Navy then broke <b>her</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> Plymouth in November 1811.|$|E
2500|$|Leela and Fry's growing {{relationship}} is marred by Fry's constant [...] After arriving {{late for work}} and standing <b>her</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> her birthday lunch date, Fry is determined {{to make it up}} to Leela by skipping a party hosted by Hedonismbot and meeting Leela for a birthday dinner date at [...] "Cavern on the Green," [...] a fancy restaurant situated in a deep cave with naturally occurring stalagmites. As Fry prepares to leave for the date, Professor Farnsworth forces him to test his newly invented one-way time machine, which is only able to travel to the future (to prevent changing the past and the creation of paradoxes), by moving one minute forward in time. As the Professor, Bender, and Fry prepare the machine, Fry records a message in a video birthday card for Leela, apologizing for being one minute late and explaining the situation. As he is about to finish, the Professor accidentally pulls the lever too far, sending them forward into the year 10,000 AD. During the trip, Fry loses the card in the time stream. Meanwhile, a nuclear accident at Hedonismbot's party kills all but Hedonismbot, leading Leela {{and the rest of the}} crew, who think Fry and the others had gone there, to believe the trio are now dead.|$|E
60|$|She rose as she spoke, and, {{screwing}} <b>her</b> face <b>up</b> <b>at</b> Joan {{with great}} significance, asked her whether she wouldn’t care {{to see the}} garden.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{know the}} way," [...] said Wyndham. [...] "Mrs. Evans {{will give the}} girls a room; we have got <b>her</b> <b>up</b> late <b>at</b> night before. Ask them what they think?" ...|$|R
50|$|In 1921, a {{movement}} was begun {{to preserve the}} battleship {{as an object of}} historic and sentimental interest, and to lay <b>her</b> <b>up</b> permanently <b>at</b> some port in the state of Oregon.|$|R
2500|$|On January 3, 1958, at 6:15 pm, a {{few days}} before Frances was {{scheduled}} to lead a junket of editors to Brazil, the Rushmores met inside the lobby of their apartment building in a final attempt at reconciliation. Frances was due to have dinner at the Dobbins' at 8 pm. When an argument broke out between the couple, Frances left to hail a taxi. Taxi driver Edward Pearlman picked <b>her</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> Madison Avenue and 97th Street. Simultaneously, Howard entered the cab. As the two continued arguing, Pearlman ordered him out of the cab to which he replied, “I’m her husband, don’t worry about it.” “Where do you want to go?” Pearlman asked. “Take me to a police station,” Frances said. As the cab raced to the 23rd Precinct at Third and 104th, they were only two blocks away when Frances screamed, “Oh my God!” Suddenly, three gunshots fired inside the cab. Rushmore had shot his wife in {{the right side of the}} head and neck then put the pistol to his temple and shot himself. At the police station, an unregistered [...]32 Colt revolver was found in Rushmore's hand and a seven-inch commando knife inside the waistband of his trousers. Jean Dobbins speculated that her mother's refusal to take Rushmore to Brazil might have started the argument that ended in the shooting. Contrary to general expectations, Dobbs said her parents quarreled [...] "over personal things, not Rushmore's controversial public life ... 'He was very possessive, very jealous, and wanted to go everywhere with her." [...] Frances Rushmore's father, Louis Everitt, the owner of a women's shoe store in Charlotte, brought his daughter's body back to North Carolina.|$|E
60|$|James, most averse at {{the first}} blush to {{accepting}} any news confirmatory of his own poignant suspicions, took <b>her</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> once.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I am {{pretty sure}} he picked <b>her</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> Rome; but never mind where--somewhere. Now (this is entirely between ourselves), is she very plebeian?' ...|$|E
60|$|Dane {{leaned forward}} a little, and forced <b>her</b> to look <b>up</b> <b>at</b> him.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Exactly. Jasper {{called her}} {{so when he}} wanted to lash <b>her</b> <b>up,</b> till <b>at</b> lash she got hold of his 'Holiday House' and threw it into the sea, and it was in Malta and we couldn't get another,' said Mysie.|$|R
6000|$|... "Poor Dolly!--I {{do think}} she passed quite half <b>her</b> time <b>up</b> <b>at</b> the beech-tree, where you first saw her, looking if brother was not coming home. It is a cruel {{thing to a}} wife to have a truant husband!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Surely she can," [...] John Petersham said. [...] "The squire dines at five. If {{you will}} bring <b>her</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> six, I will {{take her in}} to him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's {{precisely}} what it is," [...] he admitted. [...] "I thought we'd be married at Nice. My sister {{is waiting to}} go along with us. I said we'd pick <b>her</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> the Hotel de Paris." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Put <b>her</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> the back, {{or leave}} her behind," [...] he directed. [...] "Man and wife {{have never been}} {{separated}} on this coach since I started running it fifteen year ago, and they ain't going to be now." ...|$|E
60|$|I set {{more food}} before the famished child and kissed <b>her.</b> She looked <b>up</b> <b>at</b> me with {{wondering}} eyes.|$|R
6000|$|NORA [tossing <b>her</b> chin <b>up</b> <b>at</b> once]. Oh, I'm {{not expecting}} him particularly. It's a wonder he's {{come back at}} all. After staying away {{eighteen}} years he can harly expect us to be very anxious to see him, can he now? ...|$|R
60|$|She {{dropped her}} hands from <b>her</b> face, looking <b>up</b> <b>at</b> him, {{and there were}} tears shining in her {{beautiful}} eyes.|$|R
6000|$|It {{seemed as}} though she {{expected}} him to lift <b>her</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> once in his two palms. She had lost the notion of all impossibility. Anything could happen on this night of wonder. As he made no movement, she almost cried aloud-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of {{course you}} must see her," [...] said Frank. [...] "Let me {{get out of}} the house, and then tell the servant to show <b>her</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> once. Don't be weak now, Lizzie, and I'll come and find out all about it to-morrow." ...|$|E
60|$|DOOLITTLE. Me! I {{never brought}} <b>her</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> all, except {{to give her}} a lick of a strap now and again. Don't put it on me, Governor. She ain't {{accustomed}} to it, you see: that's all. But she'll soon pick up your free-and-easy ways.|$|E
60|$|Then {{she felt}} the man's hand on her shoulder, {{and that he was}} {{compelling}} <b>her</b> to look <b>up</b> <b>at</b> him.|$|R
50|$|HMS Electra was a British Royal Navy 16-gun brig-sloop of the Seagull class {{launched}} in 1806. She wrecked off Port Augusta, Sicily, on 25 March 1808. The Navy {{was able to}} salve her, but then had <b>her</b> broken <b>up</b> <b>at</b> Malta later that year.|$|R
60|$|She shrank, {{and dropped}} her head. The soft, {{penetrating}} grip {{of his hand}} on her arm distressed <b>her.</b> She looked <b>up</b> <b>at</b> him.|$|R
60|$|Thus they slowly went {{towards her}} home. He {{had left his}} cottage at half-past three, {{intending}} to be sitting down again to the New Testament by half-past five. It was nine o'clock when, with another embrace, he stood to deliver <b>her</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> her father's door.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I mean to say,' Hugh interposed, 'that {{they hung}} <b>her</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> Tyburn. What {{was good enough}} for her, is good enough for me. Let them do the like by me as soon as they please--the sooner the better. Say no more to me. I'm going to sleep.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Because she's {{one of my}} performers, of course. But, come! I've {{had enough}} of this; I can't stop talking here all day; I want the child--so just deliver <b>her</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> once, will you?--and turn out Peck {{as soon as you}} like after. I'll cure them both of ever doing this sort of thing again! I'll make them stick tight to the circus for the future! I'll show them--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ah Gerald,' she said, in a strong, slow, almost man-like way. '-All that, and more.' <b>Her</b> {{eyes looked}} <b>up</b> <b>at</b> him with {{shocking}} nonchalance.|$|R
60|$|He {{hated the}} {{emotional}} drain {{of having to}} appear fond of her. He stroked <b>her</b> hand, smiled <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>her</b> dutifully, and sank back.|$|R
60|$|He let {{his hand}} drop to his side, and stood still {{with his eyes}} fixed on <b>her.</b> Anthea looked <b>up</b> <b>at</b> him with a smile.|$|R
