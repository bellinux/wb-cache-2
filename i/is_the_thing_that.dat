As {{they began to}} read, the duo noticed {{that it had a}} {{tendency}} to take [...] "readers on a lot of side trips"—"from detailed explanations of surveillance techniques to angry attacks on corrupt Swedish industrialists," [...] professed The Hollywood Reporter Gregg Kilday. Fincher recalled of the encounter: [...] "The ballistic, ripping-yarn thriller aspect of it is kind of a red herring in a weird way. It <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> throws Salander and Blomkvist together, but it is their relationship you keep coming back to. I was just wondering what 350 pages Zaillian would get rid of." [...] Because Zaillian was already cultivating the screenplay, the director avoided interfering. After a conversation, Fincher was comfortable [...] "they were headed in the same direction".|$|E
500|$|MacDonald {{cites the}} lyrics to the first bridge – [...] "But if I seem to act unkind / It's only me, it's not my mind / That is {{confusing}} things" [...] – {{as an example of}} Harrison applying an Eastern philosophical approach to difficulties in communication, by presenting them as [...] "contradictions between different levels of being". In Laing's interpretation, the entities [...] "me" [...] and [...] "my mind" [...] represent, respectively, [...] "individualistic, selfish ego" [...] and [...] "the Buddhist not-self, freed from the anxieties of historical Time". In I, Me, Mine, however, Harrison states that, with hindsight, the order of [...] "me" [...] and [...] "my mind" [...] should be reversed, since: [...] "The mind <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> hops about telling us to do this and do that – when what we need is to lose (forget) the mind." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written and {{directed}} by series creator Rob Thomas, marking his seventh writing credit and second and final directing credit for the series (after [...] "Donut Run"). Starting with this episode, Thomas and the crew's plan for the season changed—while they had initially scheduled three major story arcs for the season, this number was now bumped down to two, while the last few episodes would be standalone. The creative team decided that their choices for major mysteries had not worked since season one; Thomas elaborated, [...] "One feeling is that the big mysteries keep away the casual TV viewers, and the other <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> has been the least successful since season one [...] the big mysteries." [...] Thomas also recalled that his major design for the first season that was because Lilly had been murdered, everyone had a stake in the solving of the mystery and that the crew were finding it impossible to keep the same amount of emotional involvement since the first season; Thomas thought that the new format would be a way of trying to return to a more emotionally driven format.|$|E

500|$|Regarding the {{resolution}} of the character at season four and dropping of Kartheiser from regular cast, Minear says that they had an idea at the conception of teenage Connor that he would only last a season, and [...] "it was time to end the character's story". But, they changed his original [...] "violent, morbid" [...] sendoff to a relatively happy one, citing their likability of actor and character as the reason. Also it was [...] "nice to give someone a happy ending for once." [...] Kartheiser was satisfied with the sendoff, particularly because the issue between Angel and Connor was confronted: [...] That to me is the soul of the character. The name of the show is Angel so it all comes back to him. For Connor, everything stems from this place with Angel and Holtz, and when we got the opportunity for him to let that out, I think he came out of his tough shell and showed a little bit of his sensitivity. He showed that he was hurt by his father and that he was hurt by Holtz. The last scene of Angel watching memory-wiped Connor dine with his new family and slipping away quietly was Whedon's idea, derived from 1937's classic movie Stella Dallas: [...] "I've given up my child. I see my child is happy, and does not know me, and I'm happy. That <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> made Stella Darlas the greatest, the thing that made this episode work." ...|$|E

2500|$|As {{the habit}} is forming, {{it can be}} {{analysed}} in three parts: the cue, the behavior, and the reward. The cue <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> causes the habit to come about, the trigger of the habitual behavior. This could be anything that one's mind associates with that habit and one will automatically let a habit come to the surface. The behavior is the actual habit that one exhibits, and the reward, a positive feeling, therefore continues the [...] "habit loop". A habit may initially be triggered by a goal, but over time that goal becomes less necessary and the habit becomes more automatic.|$|E
2500|$|His reason, which Shakespeare {{compares to}} the only {{knowledgeable}} [...] "physician" [...] or mind around, <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> offers him a way of easing its mad fever. The poet's reason can't bear the fact the poet is so foolish and reckless with his body and mind, and abandons the poet entirely. David West contends that [...] "Abandoned and despairing, [...] he is proving by experience that desire is death." [...] A reader is left to assume without a doctor, reason, around, the ill and fever affecting the poet are doomed to take over completely, leaving death as the only possible outcome. Shakespeare seems to accept this inevitable outcome and writes the final line of the quatrain saying [...] "Desire is death". The final line of the quatrain may hint at a biblical allusion and reference Romans 8:6, where a very similar line appears stating, [...] "For to set the mind on the flesh is death, but to set the mind on the Spirit is life and peace", correlating with the inference that the Dark Lady is morally dark as well as physically dark, and is darkening her lovers morals as well.|$|E
2500|$|Work on Rowland's fourth studio album {{reportedly}} {{began in}} 2011, {{after the release}} of her third studio album Here I Am. In March 2012, Lonny Bereal told Kempire Radio that the album would see Rowland returning to her R roots. [...] "She's going in so hard with the R Of course, she is going to give the Pop crowd what they're looking for. But, she really is returning to R on this album. Her delivery is real confident now. It's definitely a new Kelly Rowland. She wouldn't even let me put autotune on her voice this time round. She was like 'No, I want people to really get me'." [...] The following month, Rowland told MTV News that the album would have a theme and that she had been documenting the recording process of the album for her fans to see. During an interview with Vegas magazine in June 2012, she described the album as a dedication to [...] "my ladies". She explained, [...] "I want to tell women how incredible we are, how our intuition is so spot-on. Sometimes we don't listen to it, but it <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> can actually make us happier." [...] Rowland cited Whitney Houston, Marvin Gaye, and Stevie Wonder as the album's inspirations.|$|E

2500|$|Music {{plays an}} {{integral}} {{role in the}} film. [...] "In the story, music <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> launches them into these fantasy worlds", Snyder explains. Composer Tyler Bates said that the songs [...] "function as the subconscious mind of Baby Doll and her journey", and musical producer Marius de Vries considered [...] "an important task of the songs to signplace which particular world you are inhabiting at a particular moment". Music becomes {{the backbone of the}} film. They used actual songs for Sucker Punch that would create suitable moods. It plays an important factor in the film and is used as it was in Moulin Rouge!, according to Snyder. Dance choreography was spearheaded by Paul Becker. Emily Browning did the vocals for the songs [...] "Sweet Dreams", [...] "Asleep" [...] and [...] "Where Is My Mind" [...] that are played during the movie. Carla Gugino had to take singing lessons for her scenes as a choreographer madam in the brothel. The brothel scenario has [...] "sexy" [...] songs, as Jamie Chung described, and dance fantasy scenes. Due to time constraints, Snyder was forced to cut most of the dance sequences for the theatrical release of the film, but there is one during the credits. He did mention that for the home media release of the film's [...] "director's cut", the dance scenes will be re-inserted.|$|E
2500|$|The matter {{became the}} object of student protest in 1922, when 6 banned black freshmen, led by a recent alumnus who was {{studying}} at the Business School, protested their exclusion. Lowell wrote this explanation to Roscoe Conkling Bruce, himself an African American Harvard alumnus {{and the father of}} an incoming freshman: [...] "We have not thought it possible to compel men of different races to reside together." [...] Bruce’s lengthy reply underscored the irony of Lowell's position: [...] "The policy of compulsory residence in the Freshman Halls is costly indeed if it <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> constrains Harvard to enter open-eyed and brusque upon a policy of racial discrimination." [...] Lowell stood his ground: [...] "It is not a departure from the past to refuse to compel white and colored men to room in the same building. We owe to the colored man the same opportunities for education that we do to the white man; but we do not owe it to him to force him and the white into social relations that are not, or may not be, mutually congenial." [...] He accused Bruce of insisting on a change of policy and employed an argument about minority presence provoking prejudice that he also used about the same time in the Jewish quota dispute. [...] "For the colored man to claim that he is entitled to have the white man compelled to live with him is a very unfortunate innovation which, far from doing him good, would increase a prejudice which, as you and I will thoroughly agree, is most unfortunate and probably growing." ...|$|E
2500|$|In September 2011, Ahern said he {{believed}} {{that he would have}} [...] "done all right" [...] in the presidential election but for the decline in the popularity of Fianna Fáil. Ahern confirmed he considered running in the election. [...] "I still would have done all right. I mean they have done some figures and I would probably sit in around 30 per cent, which you haven’t a hope with as the party is on 20 per cent." [...] He added that [...] "the party popularity <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> snookers it, because if your party isn’t winnable..." [...] Mr Ahern said: [...] "If there was no downturn and if it wasn’t all the hassle of the tribunals and everything else, then you could have had a good run at it." [...] He predicted that [...] "nobody is going to win it outright – like Mary McAleese had it won on the first count". Asked about a possible future candidacy in the following presidential election, he said: [...] "Normally what happens in this country, if a president does a good job they stay on, so that’s 14 years, so that ends any chance that I’ll have." [...] He also rejected suggestions that the Mahon tribunal would reject the evidence he gave on his personal finances. [...] "The only thing that is important to me is the central allegations. And what the tribunal says about the other trash is irrelevant." [...] Michael Martin said the former taoiseach was [...] "out of touch with reality" [...] if {{he believed}} he could have won the presidency for Fianna Fáil. Martin also said expenses paid to Mr Ahern in his capacity as a former taoiseach were too high and should be reduced. He was commenting on reports that Mr Ahern had claimed €265,000 for [...] "secretarial services" [...] and €7,500 on mobile phone bills since he stepped down in May 2008. Under the current expenses regime, a former taoiseach may employ two secretarial assistants for up to five years after leaving office and one indefinitely after that.|$|E

2500|$|So it was, on {{the next}} morning, that the people rose early and built an altar there, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. The {{children}} of Israel said, [...] "Who is there among all the tribes of Israel who did {{not come up with}} the assembly to the Lord?" [...] For they had made a great oath concerning anyone who had not come up to the Lord at Mizpah, saying, [...] "He shall surely be put to death." [...] And the children of Israel grieved for Benjamin their brother, and said, [...] "One tribe is cut off from Israel today. What shall we do for wives for those who remain, seeing we have sworn by the Lord that we will not give them our daughters as wives?" [...] And they said, [...] "What one is there from the tribes of Israel who did not come up to Mizpah to the Lord?" [...] And, in fact, no one had come to the camp from Jabesh Gilead to the assembly. For when the people were counted, indeed, not one of the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead was there. So the congregation sent out there twelve thousand of their most valiant men, and commanded them, saying, [...] "Go and strike the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead with the edge of the sword, including the women and children. And this <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> you shall do: You shall utterly destroy every male, and every woman who has known a man intimately." [...] So they found among the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead four hundred young virgins who had not known a man intimately; and they brought them to the camp at Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan. Then the whole congregation sent word to the children of Benjamin who were at the rock of Rimmon, and announced peace to them. So Benjamin came back at that time, and they gave them the women whom they had saved alive of the women of Jabesh Gilead; and yet they had not found enough for them. And the people grieved for Benjamin, because the Lord had made a void in the tribes of Israel.|$|E
