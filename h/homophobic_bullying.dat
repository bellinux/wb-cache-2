50|$|As a boy, Robinson loved Marilyn Monroe's image, and Marilyn {{became his}} school nickname. While the name {{originated}} from <b>homophobic</b> <b>bullies</b> at school, Robinson decided to appropriate {{it to his}} advantage. As a teenager, he was a regular nightclub-goer and wanted to look different, so he adopted a Marilyn Monroe image wearing vintage dresses with bleached blond hair. He {{became part of the}} British New Romantic movement which emerged in the late 1970s club scene and was popularised in the early 1980s.|$|R

Kurt is at his bedside when he finally wakes, and takes charge of his father's recovery once Burt is back home. The eighth episode, entitled [...] "Furt", opens with Burt and Carole telling their sons that they are engaged. Kurt insists that New Directions perform at the wedding and reception. At the wedding, New Directions perform [...] "Marry You" [...] by Bruno Mars as they, and then Burt and Carole, dance down the aisle. The couple marry, but use their honeymoon savings to transfer Kurt to Dalton Academy when a <b>homophobic</b> <b>bully</b> who has threatened Kurt's life is allowed to resume attending McKinley High.|$|R

25|$|Proponents of LGBT sex {{education}} argue that encompassing homosexuality into the curricula would provide LGBT {{students with the}} sexual health information they need, and help to ameliorate problems such as low self-esteem and depression that research has shown can be present in LGBT individuals.

25|$|In education, {{classes on}} LGBT {{human rights are}} sought and schools are {{required}} to take action against <b>homophobic</b> <b>bullying.</b> The media are called upon to assist in breaking down stereotypes and to portray LGBT people in a realistic manner. The necessity of access to health care in general and for the specific needs of LGBT people is stressed. In particular funding for sex reassignment surgery is expected to be provided to the same extent that it is for other medically necessary treatments. Finally, religious groups are encouraged to be tolerant towards LGBT people.|$|E
25|$|The {{anxiety of}} {{heterosexual}} individuals (particularly adolescents whose construction of heterosexual masculinity {{is based in}} part on not being seen as gay) that others may identify them as gay has also been identified by Michael Kimmel as an example of homophobia. The taunting of boys seen as eccentric (and who are not usually gay) is said to be endemic in rural and suburban American schools, and has been associated with risk-taking behavior and outbursts of violence (such as a spate of school shootings) by boys seeking revenge or trying to assert their masculinity. <b>Homophobic</b> <b>bullying</b> is also very common in schools in the United Kingdom.|$|E
500|$|Lana was a student, who {{had been}} closeted due to <b>homophobic</b> <b>bullying</b> at her high school. Upon moving to Erinsborough, Lana befriended Serena Bishop (Lara Sacher) and her cousin Sky Mangel (Stephanie McIntosh), who she {{developed}} a crush on. The storyline between Lana and Sky was billed as a relationship story between two close female friends, [...] "made compelling by {{the complexity of the}} feelings involved." [...] Lana and Sky's friendship eventually culminated in Neighbours first lesbian kiss.|$|E

Kurt tells Blaine that he is being tormented by a <b>homophobic</b> <b>bully</b> at his high school, and Blaine convinces him {{to stand up for}} himself. When the bully, Dave Karofsky, throws Kurt against a locker, Kurt confronts him, and an increasingly agitated Karofsky abruptly grabs Kurt and kisses him. Before Karofsky can initiate a second kiss, Kurt shoves him away. Kurt and Blaine try to talk to Karofsky about being gay and closeted, but he denies the kiss. The bullying intensifies, and Karofsky threatens to kill Kurt if Kurt reveals their kiss to anyone. After Burt learns about Karofsky's threat to his son, Karofsky is expelled. Burt and Carole get married, but when Karofsky's expulsion is reversed by the school board, the newlyweds decide to spend the money they had saved for their honeymoon on tuition to transfer Kurt to Dalton Academy, which enforces a zero-tolerance policy against bullying.|$|R
500|$|Former New Directions member Kurt Hummel (Chris Colfer) {{attends the}} concert, {{accompanied}} by his boyfriend Blaine Anderson (Darren Criss). They are confronted by closeted <b>homophobic</b> <b>bully</b> Dave Karofsky (Max Adler), who is forced to back down by Santana Lopez (Naya Rivera), in retribution for previously throwing a slushie in her face. Sunshine and her followers {{pull out of the}} concert on Dustin's orders, and Sandy and McKinley students Jacob Ben Israel (Josh Sussman), Azimio (James Earl) and Becky Jackson (Lauren Potter)—the only other members of the audience—heckle the glee club. Tina is reduced to tears by their booing; Mike fares better as the hecklers are given taffy to keep their mouths full. During the intermission, Holly talks with the three students about the hidden cost of insults and suggests they cheer as opposed to jeering, but they opt to leave instead. Holly performs Adele's [...] "Turning Tables" [...] to Will. Mercedes Jones (Amber Riley), who on the advice of Lauren Zizes (Ashley Fink) has spent the lead-up to the concert making outrageous demands on her fellow club members to gain greater respect from them, performs the final number: a powerhouse version of Aretha Franklin's [...] "Ain't No Way". She wows a stoned Sandy, who donates some of his drug profits to fund the academic decathlon team.|$|R
25|$|In {{addition}} to public expression, legislation has been designed, controversially, to oppose homophobia, as in hate speech, hate crime, and laws against {{discrimination on the}} basis of sexual orientation. Successful preventative strategies against <b>homophobic</b> prejudice and <b>bullying</b> in schools have included teaching pupils about historical figures who were gay, or who suffered discrimination because of their sexuality.|$|R
500|$|Glee club {{director}} Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison) {{announces the}} second New Directions boys against girls singing competition. He later sees a shaken Kurt Hummel in the hallway—he had been slammed against a locker by school bully Dave Karofsky (Max Adler)—and takes Kurt {{to his office}} to recover. Kurt criticizes both the school's failure to act against <b>homophobic</b> <b>bullying</b> {{and the lack of}} challenge in the club's competition; Will decides to modify the assignment to have the teams perform songs by groups of the opposite gender. Kurt is happier with the new spin, but the other boys are unreceptive to his ideas for their team. Puck is especially dismissive, and suggests that he go spy on the Dalton Academy Warblers, one of their competitors at the forthcoming Sectionals round of show choir competition. The girls' team decides on and sings a mash-up of [...] "Start Me Up / Livin' on a Prayer".|$|E
500|$|Lana was a [...] "pretty" [...] Canadian {{high school}} student. She left her {{old high school}} due to <b>homophobic</b> <b>bullying,</b> {{and as a result}} she became [...] "very closeted". Describing the character, Natasha Norton from AfterEllen stated [...] "She comes across at first as a touch flighty, as if she can't quite make up her mind as to who she wants to be, but it soon becomes abundantly clear that Lana's {{carefully}} constructed façade has a purpose." [...] Following her arrival in Erinsborough, Lana befriended Serena Bishop (Lara Sacher). They both learned that they had been taken advantage of by [...] "sleazy" [...] photographer Chris Cousens (Simon Mallory). Serena's cousin, Sky, took an instant dislike to Lana. Sky had learned that Lana had flirted with her boyfriend, leaving her [...] "less than impressed". During a game of basketball, Sky began feuding with Lana, and they started a brawl on the court. Of filming the fight, Neval stated, [...] "We wanted to make it look spontaneous, and really gritty and brawly. It {{was a lot of fun}} learning how to choreograph a fight and how to be aware of the other actor and not actually hurt them." ...|$|E

[...] She confirmed that she voted against Proposition 8, an amendment (ultimately ruled unconstitutional) that legally defined marriage as a union solely {{between a man and a}} woman in California. In June 2012, Perry expressed her hopes for LGBT equality, commenting [...] "hopefully, we will look back at this moment and think like we do now concerning [...] civil rights issues. We'll just shake our heads in disbelief, saying, 'Thank God we've evolved.' That would be my prayer for the future."

25|$|The second series premiered on E4 on 11 March 2008, {{however the}} first episode was {{available}} in four parts to MySpace users prior to airing. 'Maxxie and Tony' starts the series, showcasing Tony's impairments following his accident and Maxxie's involvement to his recovery. The episode also reveals more about Maxxie's life; we learn of his ambitions to be a dancer, his surname, his difficulties with <b>homophobic</b> <b>bullies,</b> and encounter his parents (played by Bill Bailey and Fiona Allen). The second episode introduces a new character in Maxxie's stalker, young carer Lucy, also known as 'Sketch'. Sketch disrupts the school play organised by drama lecturer Bruce (Shane Richie) to steal a kiss from Maxxie. To spite Maxxie, Sketch begins {{a sexual relationship with}} Anwar. Episode three focuses on Sid's life, coping with Cassie's departure to Scotland, and he suspects her of cheating. Sid's Scottish relatives visit. Sid's father, Mark, stands up to his own father's abuse and ultimately reconciles his relationship with Sid; allowing for the unforeseen, peaceful death of Mark. Sid reconnects with brain-damaged Tony when he is able to open up to him about his father's death. For 'Michelle', the group go on a camping trip to a beach. Maxxie discovers Sketch having sex with Anwar, and Sid sleeps with Michelle, starting a relationship; he comes home to find Cassie waiting for him. In 'Chris', Chris agrees to start a job and Jal learns to start being more open to new things, and the two end up in a relationship. Chris cheats on her with Angie after Cassie tells Chris that Jal left him, but they move back in together, and Jal discovers she is pregnant.|$|R
40|$|This chapter {{draws on}} {{findings}} from a European project, ‘Rights through alliances: Innovating and networking both within homes and schools’ (RAINBOW-HAS), conducted during 2013 – 2015. RAINBOW-HAS involved collaboration between six European Union countries to analyse {{and improve the}} rights of children, young people and their families experiencing bullying in relation to sexual and gender identities in educational settings (Arateko, 2015). We {{share some of the}} key findings emerging from a review of the education policy literature on <b>homophobic</b> and transphobic <b>bullying</b> in the UK, and then use this to foreground a practice example led by the English project team which developed and piloted a family and student led intervention within two secondary schools aimed at preventing <b>homophobic</b> and transphobic <b>bullying.</b> We reflect on the potential of such an intervention as a model for community engagement with secondary schools and lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) young people and their families. Finally, we discuss the implications for social work where there is tendency for silence on LGBT issues more broadly and conclude with some suggestions for how social workers can be more active in their contribution to young people’s well-being in education through LGBT rights-based advocacy...|$|R

In this paper, I examine how the It Gets Better Project discourse has opened a space for the participation of heterosexual individuals in a movement directed at LGBT youth. I ask how heterosexual It Gets Better Project video contributors participate in, appropriate, and expand upon the movement discourse in order to include their voices and stories {{in spite of the}} absence of the commonality of experience of belonging to a marginalized sexual identity category. I present a discourse analysis of a non-random sample of It Gets Better videos contributed by heterosexual individuals, utilizing a social constructionist perspective in examining how individuals are narrating meaning into their experiences through their It Gets Better videos...|$|R
