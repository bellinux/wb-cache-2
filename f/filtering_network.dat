40|$|Abstract <b>Filter</b> <b>networks</b> {{are used}} as a {{powerful}} tool used for reducing the image processing time and maintaining high image quality. They are composed of sparse sub-filters whose high sparsity ensures fast image processing. The <b>filter</b> <b>network</b> design is related to solving a sparse optimization problem where a cardinality constraint bounds above the sparsity level. In the case of sequentially connected sub-filters, which is the simplest network structure of those considered in this paper, a cardinality-constrained multilinear least-squares (MLLS) problem is to be solved. Even when disregarding the cardinality constraint, the MLLS is typically a large-scale problem characterized by {{a large number of}} local minimizers, each of which is singular and non-isolated. The cardinality constraint makes the problem even more difficult to solve. An approach for approximately solving the cardinality-constrained MLLS problem is presented. It is then applied to solving a bi-criteria optimization problem in which both the time and quality of image processing are optimized. The developed approach is extended to designing <b>filter</b> <b>networks</b> of a more general structure. Its efficiency is demonstrated by designing certain 2 D and 3 D <b>filter</b> <b>networks.</b> It is also compared with the existing approaches...|$|R

40|$|Filtering is a {{fundamental}} operation in image science in general and in medical image science in particular. The most central applications are image enhancement, registration, segmentation and feature extraction. Even though these applications involve non-linear processing {{a majority of the}} methodologies available rely on initial estimates using linear filters. Linear filtering is a well established cornerstone of signal processing, which is reflected by the overwhelming amount of literature on finite impulse response filters and their design. Standard techniques for multidimensional filtering are computationally intense. This leads to either a long computation time or a performance loss caused by approximations made in order to increase the computational efficiency. This dissertation presents a framework for realization of efficient multidimensional filters. A weighted least squares design criterion ensures preservation of the performance and the two techniques called <b>filter</b> <b>networks</b> and sub-filter sequences significantly reduce the computational demand. A <b>filter</b> <b>network</b> is a realization of a set of filters, which are decomposed into a structure of sparse sub-filters each with a low number of coefficients. Sparsity is here a key property {{to reduce the number of}} floating point operations required for <b>filtering.</b> Also, the <b>network</b> structure is important for efficiency, since it determines how the sub-filters contribute to several output nodes, allowing reduction or elimination of redundant computations. <b>Filter</b> <b>networks,</b> which is the main contribution of this dissertation, has many potential applications. The primary target of the research presented here has been local structure analysis and image enhancement. A <b>filter</b> <b>network</b> realization for local structure analysis in 3 D shows a computational gain, in terms of multiplications required, which can exceed a factor 70 compared to standard convolution. For comparison, this <b>filter</b> <b>network</b> requires approximately the same amount of multiplications per signal sample as a single 2 D filter. These results are purely algorithmic and are not in conflict with the use of hardware acceleration techniques such as parallel processing or graphics processing units (GPU).
