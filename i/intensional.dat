2500|$|By 1910–1913 and Principia Mathematica Russell {{had given}} up on the {{requirement}} for an <b>intensional</b> definition of a relation, stating that [...] "mathematics is always concerned with extensions rather than intensions" [...] and [...] "Relations, like classes, are to be taken in extension". To demonstrate the notion of a relation in extension Russell now embraced the notion of ordered couple: [...] "We may regard a relation ... as a class of couples ... the relation determined by φ(x, y) is the class of couples (x, y) for which [...] φ(x, y) is true". [...] In a footnote he clarified his notion and arrived at this definition: ...|$|E
2500|$|... "There is {{a temptation}} to regard a {{relation}} as definable in extension {{as a class}} of couples. This is the formal advantage that it avoids the necessity for the primitive proposition asserting that every couple has a relation holding between no other pairs of terms. But {{it is necessary to}} give sense to the couple, to distinguish the referent [...] from the relatum : thus a couple becomes essentially distinct from a class of two terms, and must itself be introduced as a primitive idea[...] [...] [...] It seems therefore more correct to take an <b>intensional</b> view of relations, and to identify them rather with class-concepts than with classes." ...|$|E
5000|$|It will {{be noted}} that the <b>intensional</b> {{statements}} above feature expressions like [...] "knows", [...] "possible", and [...] "pleased". Such expressions always, or nearly always, produce <b>intensional</b> statements when added (in some intelligible manner) to an extensional statement, and thus they (or more complex expressions like [...] "It is possible that") are sometimes called <b>intensional</b> operators. A large class of <b>intensional</b> statements, but by no means all, can be spotted from the fact that they contain <b>intensional</b> operators.|$|E
50|$|An <b>intensional</b> statement-form is a statement-form with {{at least}} one {{instance}} such that substituting co-extensive expressions into it does not always preserve logical value. An <b>intensional</b> statement is a statement that is an instance of an <b>intensional</b> statement-form. Here co-extensive expressions are expressions with the same extension.|$|E
50|$|An extensional {{statement}} is a non-intensional statement. Substitution of co-extensive expressions into it always preserves logical value. A language is <b>intensional</b> if it contains <b>intensional</b> statements, and extensional otherwise. All natural languages are <b>intensional.</b> The only extensional languages are artificially constructed languages used in mathematical logic or for other special purposes and small fragments of natural languages.|$|E

50|$|Natural {{languages}} abound with <b>intensional</b> functors, {{this can}} be illustrated by <b>intensional</b> statements. Extensional logic cannot reach inside such fine logical structures of the language, it stops at a coarser level. The attempts for such deep logical analysis have a long past: authors as early as Aristotle had already studied modal syllogisms. Gottlob Frege developed a kind of two dimensional semantics: for resolving questions like those of <b>intensional</b> statements, he has introduced a distinction between two semantic values: sentences (and individual terms) have both an extension and an intension. These semantic values can be interpreted, transferred also for functors (except for <b>intensional</b> functors, they have only intension).|$|E

Thus sometimes similar patterns repeated themselves for the history of development of <b>intensional</b> logic like earlier for that of extensional logic.|$|E

50|$|<b>Intensional</b> {{logic is}} an {{approach}} to predicate logic that extends first-order logic, which has quantifiers that range over the individuals of a universe (extensions), by additional quantifiers that range over terms that may have such individuals as their value (intensions).
