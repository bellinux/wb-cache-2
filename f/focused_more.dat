According to Arinn Dembo from Computer Gaming World, the game is <b>focused</b> <b>more</b> around the story and the frightening atmosphere, rather than on a difficult gaming experience, and therefore the puzzles are relatively easy, logical, and straightforward.|$|E

The transitional constitution was still in effect, which meant the president was elected by government ministers and the national assembly rather than by a direct election.|$|E

5|$|The {{episode was}} written by Norm Hiscock and {{directed}} by Paul Feig.

However, Hiscock said he was <b>focused</b> <b>more</b> strongly on comedy than making a political or social statement.|$|E

5|$|As a student, Kincaid showed {{exceptional}} {{aptitude for}} the natural sciences and achieved national attention for his scientific achievements.

Back in Washington, Kincaid's interests <b>focused</b> <b>more</b> on insect life, and a report that year in the Boston Evening Transcript noted that he had discovered 41 new species of bees, including 22 of the genus Osmia. Theodore Dru Alison Cockerell, at the time one of America's leading entomologists, directed a portion of the sizable Kincaid bee collection to the Smithsonian Institution.|$|E

5|$|Despite reservations, Hitler {{remained}} {{committed to}} the offensive. He and the OKW, early in the preparatory phase, were hopeful that the offensive would revitalise German strategic fortunes in the east. As the challenges offered by Citadel increased, he <b>focused</b> <b>more</b> {{and more on the}} expected new weapons that he believed were the key to victory: principally the Panther tank, but also the Elefant tank destroyer and greater numbers of the Tiger heavy tank. He postponed the operation in order to await their arrival. Receiving reports of powerful Soviet concentrations behind the Kursk area, Hitler further delayed the offensive to allow for more equipment to reach the front.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{political}} upheaval, the Egyptian temple style continued to evolve without absorbing much foreign influence.

New architectural forms continued to develop, such as covered kiosks in front of gateways, more elaborate column styles, and the mammisi, a building celebrating the mythical birth of a god. Though {{the characteristics of the}} late temple style had developed by the last period of native rule, most of the examples date from the era of the Ptolemies, Greek kings who ruled as pharaohs for nearly 300 years.|$|E

Critics have discussed similarities between Pod and the Pixies' music, and commented favorably or unfavorably on Pods relative quality to that band's work. The album has been noted for its minimal instrumentation, and for its sexual, dark, girl-like lyrics.|$|E
