40|$|Abstract. Compiling a solver-independent {{constraint}} {{model to}} solver input usually involves <b>flattening,</b> the decomposition of complex constraints into simpler expressions {{to suit the}} solver, introducing additional variables and constraints. In previous work [8], we have proposed extending <b>flattening</b> with common subexpression elimination (CSE) which can reduce the overhead introduced during <b>flattening.</b> In this work, we formally analyse the cost of standard <b>flattening</b> and CSEbased flattening: we compare time and space complexity and investigate the potential variable and constraint reduction from CSE-based <b>flattening,</b> its scope and limitations. Furthermore, we discuss <b>flattening</b> whole problem classes and show how to integrate CSE into class-wise <b>flattening.</b> We highlight the differences to instance-wise <b>flattening</b> and discuss open questions. Finally, our empirical analysis confirms our theoretical findings and demonstrates the benefits of CSE-based <b>flattening.</b> ...|$|R

5|$|Pouring mercury onto a {{horizontal}} flat sheet of glass {{results in a}} puddle that has a perceptible thickness. The puddle will spread out only {{to the point where}} it is a little under half a centimetre thick, and no thinner. Again this is due to the action of mercury's strong surface tension. The liquid mass <b>flattens</b> out because that brings as much of the mercury to as low a level as possible, but the surface tension, at the same time, is acting to reduce the total surface area. The result of the compromise is a puddle of a nearly fixed thickness.|$|E

When she threatens to throw Toto into a fiery cauldron, Dorothy nearly gives in until the Scarecrow hints to her to activate a fire sprinkler switch, which she does. The sprinklers put out the fire but also melt Evillene. She is flushed down into her throne, the lid of which slams shut like a toilet. With Evillene finally gone, her spells lose their power: the Winkies are freed from their permanent costumes (revealing attractive humans underneath) and their sweatshop tools disappear. They rejoice in dance and praise Dorothy as their emancipator. The Flying Monkeys give her and her friends a triumphant ride back to the Emerald City.|$|E

5|$|Coprinopsis atramentaria, {{commonly}} known as the common ink cap or inky cap, is an edible (but sometimes poisonous, when combined with alcohol) mushroom found in Europe and North America. Previously known as Coprinus atramentarius, it is the second best known ink cap and previous member of the genus Coprinus after C.comatus. It is a widespread and common fungus found throughout the northern hemisphere. Clumps of mushrooms arise after rain from spring to autumn, commonly in urban and disturbed habitats such as vacant lots and lawns, as well as grassy areas. The grey-brown cap is initially bell-shaped before opening, after which it <b>flattens</b> and disintegrates. The flesh is thin and the taste mild. It can be eaten but is poisonous when consumed with alcohol – hence another common name, tippler's bane.|$|E
5|$|In Amanita abrupta, as {{with most}} mushrooms, {{the bulk of the}} {{organism}} lies unseen beneath the ground as an aggregation of fungal cells called hyphae; under appropriate environmental conditions, the visible reproductive structure (fruit body) is formed. The cap has a diameter of , and has a broadly convex shape when young, but eventually <b>flattens.</b> The central portion of the cap becomes depressed in mature specimens. The cap surface is verrucose—covered with small angular or pyramidal erect warts (1–2mm tall by 1–2mm wide at the base); the warts are smaller and more numerous near the margin of the cap, and small fragments of tissue may be hanging from the margin of the cap. The cap surface, the warts, and the flesh are white. The warts can be easily separated from the cap, and in mature specimens they have often completely or partly disappeared. The white gills are placed moderately close together, reaching the stem but not directly attached to it.|$|E

5|$|The lungs {{of mammals}} are spongy and honeycombed. Breathing is mainly {{achieved}} with the diaphragm, which divides the thorax from the abdominal cavity, forming a dome convex to the thorax. Contraction of the diaphragm <b>flattens</b> the dome, increasing {{the volume of}} the lung cavity. Air enters through the oral and nasal cavities, and travels through the larynx, trachea and bronchi, and expands the alveoli. Relaxing the diaphragm has the opposite effect, decreasing {{the volume of the}} lung cavity, causing air to be pushed out of the lungs. During exercise, the abdominal wall contracts, increasing pressure on the diaphragm, which forces air out quicker and more forcefully. The rib cage is able to expand and contract the chest cavity through the action of other respiratory muscles. Consequently, air is sucked into or expelled out of the lungs, always moving down its pressure gradient. This type of lung is known as a bellows lung due to its resemblance to blacksmith bellows.|$|E
5|$|I-215 {{begins at}} an {{interchange}} {{at the mouth}} of Parley's Canyon in Millcreek near the southeast corner of Salt Lake City that connects I-80, Foothill Drive (State Route 186, or SR-186) and Parleys Way. At this point, I-215 splits into three legs, connecting I-80 toward Salt Lake City, Foothill Drive and Parleys Way, and I-80 through Parley's Canyon. From here, the freeway travels southeast along the Salt Lake Valley's east bench with three lanes in each direction. The route enters a residential area of East Millcreek and turns south. Then, the first exit appears, an incomplete diamond interchange with 3300 South (SR-171) that lacks an off-ramp from northbound I-215. Past this interchange, an on-ramp connects 3800South to northbound I-215. A block further south is a partial interchange lacking an off-ramp from northbound I-215 onto 3900South. Entering Holladay, I-215 is heading south but soon turns southwest. An off-ramp here allows northbound motorists to connect to Wasatch Boulevard. However, this exit is signed as 3900South and 3300South because of the incomplete interchanges on both roads. Past an interchange at 4500 South (SR-266) that serves southbound I-215, the road turns south again and begins descending toward Knudsen's Corner and Cottonwood Heights. At this point, the southbound lanes are lower than the parallel northbound lanes. The belt route <b>flattens</b> out upon reaching an interchange at 6200 South at Knudsen's Corner.|$|E
5|$|The thighbone is {{straight}} in front view. Seen {{from the same}} direction its head is perpendicular to the shaft, seen from above it is orientated 20° to the front. The greater trochanter is relatively wide and separated from the robust lesser trochanter in front of it, by a fissure. At the front base of the lesser trochanter a low accessory trochanter is present. At {{the lower end of}} the thighbone a distinct front, extensor, groove separates the condyles. At the upper inner side of this groove a rough area is present continuing inwards into a longitudinal ridge, a typical megalosauroid trait. The shinbone, or tibia, is relatively straight, slightly curving inwards. To below, its shaft progressively <b>flattens</b> from front to rear, resulting in a generally oval cross-section. For about an eighth of its length the front lower end of the shaft is covered by a vertical branch of the astragalus. Of the foot, only the second, third and fourth metatarsals are known, the bone elements that were connected to the three weight-bearing toes. They are straight and robust, showing ligament pits at their lower sides. The third metatarsal has no clear condyles at its lower end, resulting in a more flexible joint, allowing for a modicum of horizontal movement. The top inner side of the third metatarsal carries a unique ridge that fits into a groove along the top outer side of the second metatarsal, causing a tighter connection.|$|E

5|$|The Ridge Route {{crosses the}} West Branch California Aqueduct with SR 138, {{splitting}} {{to the northwest}} on Gorman Post Road. It rejoins the path of I-5 at Gorman, and, from Gorman to the end at Grapevine, most of the old road has been covered over by the Ridge Route Alternate or I-5. The path of the Ridge Route is now named Peace Valley Road and Lebec Road, passing over Tejon Pass and past Lebec and Fort Tejon. Past Fort Tejon, the route descends through Grapevine Canyon to Grapevine (named for grapevines in the area). The best-known curve on the road, Deadman's Curve or Death Curve, is visible from Digier Road {{on the west side}} of I-5. The next part of the old road that still exists is near the bottom of the grade, where a number of curves brought the road down to Grapevine. The original plan was to build the road nearer to the center of the canyon, but a March1914 flood destroyed the work, and the grading was redone higher up. Deadman's Curve and the Grapevine loops were both bypassed by the Ridge Route Alternate, which was built directly over most of the old road in this area. At Grapevine, the land suddenly <b>flattens</b> out, and the road north of Grapevine was the longest straight section of road in the state——in 1926.

40|$|Most {{programming}} languages {{support a}} call stack in the programming model {{and also in}} the runtime system. We show that for applications targeting low-power embedded microcontrollers (MCUs), RAM usage can be significantly decreased by partially or completely eliminating the runtime callstack. We present <b>flattening,</b> a transformation that absorbs a function into its caller, replacing function invocations and returns with jumps. Unlike inlining, <b>flattening</b> does not duplicate the bodies of functions that have multiple callsites. Applied aggressively, <b>flattening</b> results in stack elimination. <b>Flattening</b> is most useful in conjunction with a lifting transformation that moves global variables into a local scope. <b>Flattening</b> and lifting can save RAM. However, even more benefit can be obtained by adapting the compiler to cope with properties of <b>flattened</b> code. First, we show that <b>flattening</b> adds false paths that confuse a standard live variables analysis. The resulting problems can be mitigated by breaking spurious live-range conflicts between variables using information from the unflattened callgraph. Second, we show that the impact of high register pressure due to <b>flattened</b> and lifted code, and consequent spills out of the register allocator, can be mitigated by improving a compiler’s stack layout optimizations. We have implemented both of these improvements in GCC, and have implemented <b>flattening</b> and lifting as source-tosource transformations.

30|$|Roll <b>flattening</b> is an {{important}} component in the roll stack elastic deformation, which has important influence on controlling of the strip crown and flatness. Foppl formula and semi-infinite body model are the most popular analytical models in the roll <b>flattening</b> calculation. However, the roll <b>flattening</b> calculated by traditional <b>flattening</b> models has a great deviation from actual situation, especially near the barrel edges. Therefore, in order to improve the accuracy of roll <b>flattening,</b> a new model is proposed based on the elastic half plane theory. The calculation formulas of roll <b>flattening</b> are deduced respectively under the assumptions of plane strain and plane stress. Then, the two assumptions are combined through the method of introducing an transition coefficient, and the distribution rules of roll <b>flattening</b> for different rolling force, <b>flattening</b> width, roll length and roll diameter are analyzed by using the FEM analysis software Marc. Regarding the ratio of the length to roll end and the roll diameter as variable to fit the transition coefficient, the new model of roll <b>flattening</b> is established based on the elastic half plane theory. Finally, the transition coefficient is fitted to establish the model. Compared with the traditional models, the new model can effectively improve the calculation deviation in the roll end, which has important significance for accurate simulation of plate shape, especially for the distribution of rolling force between rolls.|$|R
