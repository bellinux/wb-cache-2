5|$|While the Ordainers {{were at work}} {{drafting}} their reform document, Edward {{decided to}} address {{one of the main}} causes behind the discontent: the Scottish situation. Edward II had, almost immediately after his accession, abandoned the relentless Scottish campaigns of his father. As a result, Robert the Bruce had been able to regain the initiative in the war, reconquer lost territory, and stage destructive raids into the north of England. To aggravate matters, Edward had continued to raise extortionate taxes, ostensibly for the war in Scotland, but without showing any result. If the King could produce victory against the Scots, this would <b>go</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>way</b> towards undermining the work of the Ordainers. In June, the King summoned the magnates for a military campaign, but most of the Ordainers refused {{on the basis of the}} work they were performing. When the King departed for Scotland in September, only Gloucester, Warenne and Gaveston among the earls accompanied him. The campaign proved frustrating for Edward, when Bruce refused to engage in open battle, or even get involved in negotiations. In February, Gaveston was sent with an army north from Roxburgh to Perth, but he failed to track down the Scottish army.|$|E

25|$|In {{the first}} Test in Perth, De Villiers scored a match-winning century to help South Africa chase down {{the second highest}} ever fourth innings target of 414 with six wickets in hand. This was South Africa's first Test victory in Australia in 15 years and {{appeared}} to <b>go</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>way</b> towards tilting world cricket's balance of power after over a decade of Australian dominance. De Villiers also took four diving catches {{in the course of}} the match, including one to dismiss Jason Krejza, a stunner at backward point.|$|E

[...] At the time of the autobiography's release, architecture historian Robert Bruegmann opined that the Pond brothers [...] "have remained relatively obscure because they didn't fit in with narratives that wished to see Chicago architecture of the late 19th and early 20th centuries as a prelude to European modernism of the 1920s." [...] Nevertheless, Bruegmann noted that [...] "Chicago architecture was always a great deal more than that" [...] and expressed his satisfaction that the publication of Pond's autobiography [...] "should <b>go</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>way</b> toward bringing back into focus one of America's most interesting and important architectural practices." ...|$|E

500|$|The Hi-5 brand was {{originally}} owned by its creators, Harris, and Graeme-Evans, under their joint privately owned production company Kids Like Us. Unlike peer entertainers the Wiggles, {{the cast of}} Hi-5 did not hold equity, but were rather employees of the brand. Because of this, the original cast in early years stated that they had financial difficulties, even though the Hi-5 brand was earning millions. Crawford stated, [...] "the money system has to <b>go</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>way</b> around before it gets to us." [...] In March 2008, the Nine Network, along with production company Southern Star, purchased the Hi-5 brand. The franchise was placed {{under the direction of}} Martin Hersov and Cathy Payne, also Nine and Southern Star executives, while Harris and Graeme-Evans ended their involvement with the company along with the sale.|$|E
500|$|Syphon Filter {{received}} [...] "critical acclaim" [...] reviews, {{according to}} video game review aggregator Metacritic. Edge stated that, although the game borrows elements from both GoldenEye 007 and Metal Gear Solid and that [...] "the execution {{could have been}} better accomplished, Eidetic [...] a few ideas of its own, and these <b>go</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>way</b> towards providing the game with its own identity." [...] The blend of a stealth-action hybrid gameplay was praised by most critics. Doug Perry of IGN enjoyed the implemented skill-based action that he considered was [...] "hard to come by in a PlayStation game". Perry praised the game's detail and advanced graphics, but criticised the low resolution and noting that the game's frame rate was [...] "not perfect". Despite this, he noted that what Syphon Filter [...] "gives up in frame rate [...] provides in character and environment detail".|$|E
500|$|Negative reviews {{came from}} Salon.com and The Scotsman. Louis Bayard of Salon.com {{disagreed}} with the delivery of the final chapter, on ecological debt, writing that Atwood [...] "forsakes artistic engagement for ideological reflex". William Skidelsky in The Guardian agreed that the chapter was [...] "by no means {{the highlight of the}} book". [...] He also wrote: [...] "Because Atwood constantly veers off in new directions she doesn't always give herself time to sink her claws deep into a topic. The result is that, although Payback is packed with information, it can seem oddly thin... Still, Atwood's enthusiasm for her subject and lively style <b>go</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>way</b> toward making up for these flaws. She can be a brilliant phrase-maker, and has a gift for summing up an idea with a single vivid image." [...] Allan Massie, reviewing for The Scotsman, could not find a coherent argument being presented and found her writing style [...] "veering uncomfortably between the academic and the jokily colloquial, [...] tiresome, [...] some of her writing is pretentious, much obvious and platitudinous". The reviewers in Salon.com and The Scotsman, as well as The Economist, were all uncomfortable with Atwood not distinguishing or contrasting 'good' and 'bad' debt.|$|E

500|$|God of War: Ghost of Sparta was {{received}} positively by various media outlets. Nicole Tanner of IGN stated {{that in terms}} of gameplay, [...] "there's nothing unique here, but that's not a bad thing." [...] 1UP's Chris Pereira said that the controls are [...] "largely the same" [...] as Chains of Olympus, but it [...] "is still an extremely well-paced action game." [...] He said that it is put together so well that it is worth playing, [...] "unless you've become truly tired of the franchise". Joystiq's Randy Nelson stated that the scope of the game seems like it [...] "was planned for release on consoles", but [...] "if you were hoping for something really innovative, you're out of luck." [...] Joe Juba of Game Informer stated that [...] "the other core fighting mechanics are familiar, but the tweaks <b>go</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>way</b> toward improving gameplay". [...] stated [...] " [...] Sparta offers an immersive experience on par with many of the best PS3 games". Simon Parkin of Eurogamer praised the battle system as strong, however, he stated [...] "There is a sense that Ghost of Sparta is a step back for the series" [...] and claimed that it is [...] "best enjoyed by newcomers" [...] or [...] "those yet to play" [...] God of War III.|$|E
500|$|Schmidt criticises Cochrane's liberty {{thesis on}} the grounds that nonhuman animals may have a {{non-specific}} instrumental interest in freedom, meaning that although freedom is not intrinsically valuable for these animals, it may be that they can achieve other things that are intrinsically valuable only through possessing freedom. Thus, Cochrane's thesis underestimates the value that freedom could have for nonhuman animals. Hadley criticises Cochrane's non-pragmatic approach, arguing that Cochrane, as an animal advocate, is wrong to deny that nonhuman animals possess an [...] "intrinsic" [...] interest in freedom. Hadley links freedom to the value of nonhuman animals, arguing that the latter can be undermined by arguing against the former. Garner criticises Cochrane's thesis {{on the grounds}} that Cochrane has, Garner claims, underestimated the weight of the argument from marginal cases. To the extent that Cochrane's argument works for nonhuman animals, Garner suggests, it will also work for many humans, leading to counter-intuitive consequences. Garner ties autonomy not merely to liberty, but also life, which means that Cochrane's argument would imply that some humans have less of an interest in life than others. Nonetheless, Garner argues that Cochrane's liberty thesis is not destructive of animal rights, and that animal rights positions can still make claims of significance without endorsing the claim that nonhuman animal use is, in itself, problematic. Indeed, merely a right against suffering, Garner suggests, could <b>go</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>way</b> towards achieving the abolitionist goal of the end of animal industry. All three authors praise Cochrane for drawing attention to the previously under-examined issue.|$|E
