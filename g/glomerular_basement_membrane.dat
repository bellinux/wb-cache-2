25|$|Anti-dsDNA {{antibodies}} {{are highly}} associated with glomerulonephritis in SLE, although some patients with high titers of anti-dsDNA antibodies do not develop renal disease. This {{is most likely}} {{due to the fact}} that anti-dsDNA are a heterogeneous population, some of which have been found not to be pathogenic. Anti-dsDNA antibodies can be present in normal individuals, however these antibodies are usually low avidity IgM isotype. In contrast, pathogenic anti-dsDNA antibodies found in SLE are usually of IgG isotype and show high avidity for dsDNA. One possible mechanism for anti-dsDNA and their role in nephritis is the formation of immune complexes that arise by indirect binding to DNA or nucleosomes that are adhered to the <b>glomerular</b> <b>basement</b> <b>membrane</b> (GBM). Another mechanism is direct binding of antibodies to GBM antigens such as C1q, nucleosomal proteins, heparin sulphate or laminin, which can initiate an inflammatory response by activating complement. They can also be internalised by certain molecules on the GBM cells and cause inflammatory cascades, proliferation and alteration of cellular functions.|$|E
25|$|Anti-double {{stranded}} DNA (anti-dsDNA) antibodies {{are highly}} associated with SLE. They {{are a very}} specific marker for the disease, with some studies quoting nearly 100%. Data on sensitivity ranges from 25–85%. Anti-dsDNA antibody levels, known as titres, correlate with disease activity in SLE; high levels indicate more active lupus. The presence of anti-dsDNA antibodies is also linked with lupus nephritis and there is evidence they are the cause. Some anti-dsDNA antibodies are cross reactive with other antigens found on the <b>glomerular</b> <b>basement</b> <b>membrane</b> (GBM) of the kidney, such as heparan sulphate, collagen IV, fibronectin and laminin. Binding to these antigens within the kidney could cause inflammation and complement fixation, resulting in kidney damage. Presence of high DNA-binding and low C3 levels {{have been shown to}} have extremely high predictive value (94%) for the diagnosis of SLE. It is also possible that the anti-dsDNA antibodies are internalised by cells when they bind membrane antigens and then are displayed on the cell surface. This could promote inflammatory responses by T-cells within the kidney. It {{is important to note that}} not all anti-dsDNA antibodies are associated with lupus nephritis and that other factors can cause this symptom in their absence. The antigen of anti-dsDNA antibodies is double stranded DNA.|$|E

40|$|A {{monoclonal}} antibody marker for Alport syndrome identifies the Alport antigen as the α 5 chain of type IV collagen. The nephropathy of Alport syndrome {{is associated with}} unique abnormalities of <b>glomerular</b> <b>basement</b> <b>membranes</b> and is caused in many families by mutations in the X-chromosomal gene COL 4 A 5, which encodes the α 5 chain of type IV collagen. We have previously reported that Alport epidermal and <b>glomerular</b> <b>basement</b> <b>membranes</b> fail to bind a {{monoclonal antibody}}, Mab A 7, that reacts with normal epidermal and <b>glomerular</b> <b>basement</b> <b>membranes,</b> and that this abnormality is unique to Alport syndrome. The molecule in normal tissues that reacts with Mab A 7 was termed the “Alport antigen”. In the present study we used recombinant carboxyterminal noncollagenous (NCI) domains of the α 1, α 2, α 3, α 4 and α 5 chains of type IV collagen to determine the molecular identity of the Alport antigen. Mab A 7 was found to bind specifically to the NCI domain of the α 5 chain of type IV collagen, by ELISA and immunoblotting studies. This finding provides a molecular explanation for the utility of Mab A 7 as a marker for the Alport <b>basement</b> <b>membrane</b> defect. Mab A 7 can identify the Alport <b>basement</b> <b>membrane</b> defect in those patients in whom COL 4 A 5 mutations prevent incorporation of α 5 (IV) into <b>basement</b> <b>membranes...</b>|$|R

Scanning electron microscopy was performed before and after removal of podocytes and endothelial cells with enzyme and detergent, producing cellular and acellular glomeruli respectively. Cellular glomeruli of unaffected dogs showed podocytes with normally arranged foot processes, while in acellular glomeruli, the subepithelial surface of <b>glomerular</b> capillary <b>basement</b> <b>membranes</b> appeared smooth to finely granular.

40|$|Remodelling of the {{extracellular}} matrix requires tight control {{not only of}} matrix synthesis, but also of matrix degradation. Control of matrix degradation is achieved mainly through the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) enzymes. In the glomerulus, MMP- 2 and MMP- 9 {{are believed to be}} particularly important, as they have activity against type IV collagen. This study has demonstrated by immuno-electron microscopy that most of the immunoreactivity for MMP- 2 in the normal glomerulus is located within the <b>glomerular</b> <b>basement</b> <b>membranes</b> and mesangial matrix. mRNA for MMP- 2 is also detectable in normal glomeruli, but the other main gelatinase, MMP- 9, could not be localized by immuno-electron microscopy. In the normal glomerulus, it seemed likely that MMP- 2 is present in an inactive form. To confirm this, in situ zymography was carried out using frozen sections of normal kidney. Baseline activity of normal kidney was relatively weak, but this was dramatically increased by chemical activation of metalloproteinases. The results imply that MMP- 2, in an inactive form, is a normal constituent of the {{extracellular matrix}} and <b>glomerular</b> <b>basement</b> <b>membranes.</b> Activation would presumably render the matrix 'self-degrading'; membrane-bound MMPs (MT-MMPs) seem particularly likely to be involved in leukocyte penetration of <b>basement</b> <b>membranes</b> in inflammation. 7819...|$|R
