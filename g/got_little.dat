5|$|The {{launch of}} the Expedition 1 crew {{occurred}} {{a week before the}} United States presidential election, so it <b>got</b> <b>little</b> attention in the United States. At the time of the mission, the station was expected to be completed in 2006, and be continuously inhabited until at least 2015. Due to several delays, including the fallout from the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster, the station was completed in late 2011, thanks to STS-134.|$|E
5|$|The Origin of Birds is {{an early}} {{synopsis}} of bird evolution written in 1926 by Gerhard Heilmann, a Danish artist and amateur zoologist. The book was born {{from a series of}} articles published between 1913 and 1916 in Danish, and although republished as a book it received mainly criticism from established scientists and <b>got</b> <b>little</b> attention within Denmark. The English edition of 1926, however, became highly influential at the time due to the breadth of evidence synthesized as well as the artwork used to support its arguments. It was considered the last word on the subject of bird evolution for several decades after its publication.|$|E
25|$|With {{this new}} line-up, Inearthed {{proceeded}} {{to record their}} third demo, entitled Shining. This demo did not impress record labels {{any more than the}} previous ones had, and none took interest in the band. Despite their efforts, their music <b>got</b> <b>little</b> exposure and managed only to play at local events. As a last resort, the band decided to record an independent, self-funded album. Considering that none of the musicians had much money to begin with, it was an audacious move.|$|E

25|$|Major gaps {{remain in}} the {{implementation}} of the rehabilitation measures, with villagers alleging that they have <b>got</b> <b>little</b> of the rehabilitation package they were promised. The negative economic impact of the displacement to villagers from Kuno sanctuary has raised a controversy over the merits of species preservation via dislocation of human populations living inside Protected Areas. NGOs, such as the Samrakshan Trust, have been working for better rehabilitation of villagers who agreed {{to move out of the}} Kuno Wildlife Sanctuary.|$|E
25|$|Cook and Stokes {{continued}} to rebuild for England {{on the third}} day, but the wicket of Stokes just before lunch dented England's progress. Apart from a knock of 39 by Moeen Ali, Cook <b>got</b> <b>little</b> support from the remaining batsmen and was dismissed four runs short of hundred. England were eventually bowled out for 312 after tea. Instead of enforcing the follow on, Australia decided to bat their second innings. Both their openers started to score rapidly and took the team score to 108 without loss at stumps.|$|E
25|$|Bathsheba Lincoln {{was left}} a widow with five underage children.

25|$|When the 7th Brigade {{withdrew from}} the hill, the {{artillery}} stopped and Syrian tanks mounted the hill to fire at them. Ben-Gal's 7th Battalion had only six tanks and was acting as a brigade reserve, Nafshi had six tanks, and the operations officer was patrolling Buq'ata for the commandos. Zamir was fighting on Tel Git and {{was running out of}} ammunition, so he asked for permission to withdraw and reload. Ben-Gal refused at first, but relented when he was told there was only one shell per tank. Ben-Gal consulted Eitan and decided to counterattack. The 7th Battalion began to move up the hill and saw the Syrian tanks. Kahalani called the other Israeli tanks behind the ramp and <b>got</b> <b>little</b> response, since they were from different units and were operating on different frequencies. The brigade communications officer cut into every company's net, but they still did not respond to Kahalani. Kahalani's gunner knocked out the Syrian tank {{at the top of the}} hill, and another one was hit by an Israeli tank from the rear of the ramp.|$|E
25|$|His finest {{moment as}} a bowler arguably {{came at the}} 1983 World Cup in England, where he used the helpful {{conditions}} to register his two only ODI five-wicket-hauls. First, at Headingley against Pakistan, he took five for 39, but <b>got</b> <b>little</b> help from his team-mates and couldn't quite carry the team to the target, being last out as Sri Lanka needed 12 more to win off 10 balls. Two days later, however, they moved to The County Ground, Derby, and de Mel once again took five wickets - this time for only 32 runs, as New Zealand crumbled to 181 and Sri Lanka won by three wickets, their only win in the tournament. De Mel returned Sri Lanka's best bowling figures in every match. He was the tournament's second highest wicket taker with 17 wickets, one behind India's Roger Binny. Many years later, {{it was discovered that}} one of the wickets credited to Rumesh Ratnayake in Sri Lanka's first round match against England was actually taken by De Mel, but the scorecards still don't reflect that.|$|E
500|$|At {{the very}} end of its history, the {{economics}} of the Restoration spectacular spiralled out of control with the magnificent production of The Fairy Queen in the 1691–92 season. It was a great popular success, but so stuffed with special effects and so expensive that it nevertheless proved impossible to make money from it. As Downes recalls: [...] "Though the court and town were wonderfully satisfied with it ... the expenses in setting it out being so great, the company <b>got</b> <b>little</b> by it." [...] Its twelve-foot-high working fountain and six dancing real live monkeys have become notorious in theatre history.|$|E

500|$|This episode, {{like many}} other Itchy & Scratchy themed episodes, was written by John Swartzwelder, {{although}} the plot was originally pitched by Sam Simon. During the table read of the script, the first act received many laughs, but the second act <b>got</b> <b>little</b> positive reaction, leading Al Jean {{to believe that the}} script would require a huge rewrite, although the third act also received a positive reaction. For The Itchy & Scratchy Movie shown {{at the end of the}} episode, Mike Reiss felt that it should top all other Itchy & Scratchy cartoons in terms of violence, and John Swartzwelder wrote the [...] "most disturbing, horrible sequence", none of which was used in the final cut.|$|E
500|$|Charlotte's {{pregnancy}} {{was the subject}} of the most intense public interest. [...] Betting shops quickly set up book on what sex the child would be. [...] Economists calculated that the birth of a princess would raise the stock market by 2.5%; the birth of a prince would raise it 6%. Charlotte spent her time quietly, spending much time sitting for a portrait by Sir Thomas Lawrence. [...] She ate heavily and <b>got</b> <b>little</b> exercise; when her medical team began prenatal care in August 1817, they put her on a strict diet, hoping {{to reduce the size of}} the child at birth. [...] The diet, and occasional bleeding, seemed to weaken Charlotte. [...] Stockmar was amazed at a treatment he saw as outdated, and declined to join the medical team, believing that, as a foreigner, he would be blamed if anything went wrong.|$|E
500|$|In October 1948, the Progressive Conservatives also {{elected a}} new leader, Ontario Premier George A. Drew. Drew had won three {{consecutive}} provincial elections, taking even francophone ridings, and the Tories, perennially weak in Quebec, hoped that Drew could repeat his success {{on a national}} scale. [...] Drew defeated Diefenbaker for the leadership. [...] St. Laurent called an election for June 1949, and Howe again was successful in fundraising from corporate backers. Major corporations from the CPR to Eaton's contributed to the well financed Liberal campaign. The Liberals won a huge victory, taking 190seats to 40 for the Tories, and Howe again won Port Arthur easily. [...] Drew had used Howe's record as an election issue, accusing him of being power mad and of selling off Crown Corporations for bargain prices, but the allegations <b>got</b> <b>little</b> traction. According to Howe, the only result of Drew's attacks [...] "was {{to give me a}} record majority in Port Arthur!" ...|$|E

500|$|Maurice marched towards Lyme Regis in March 1644, and {{initially}} {{set up a}} garrison {{in the town of}} Beaminster. From there a detachment of troops captured and then razed Stedcombe House, a property of Erle's that he had garrisoned. On 19 April, a fire devastated Beaminster and forced the Royalist troops to move, establishing their new quarters at Axminster. The following day, Maurice marched his army of around 4,000 men to around [...] of Lyme Regis, and then after some posturing between the opposing forces, the Royalists captured Haye House, roughly [...] from the town, which had been garrisoned with around thirty defenders. On the third day of the siege, the attackers set up their artillery {{on the west side of}} town, and began a bombardment, but the next day Ceeley sent a force of 190 men to attack the battery, and forced the Royalists from their position. New batteries were set up around the town, and the besieging forces continued to attack the town with their ordnance. On 28 April, Maurice ordered an advance on the town, but the attack <b>got</b> <b>little</b> further than the range of musket-shot. The next day, the town was restocked with ammunition and food, and reinforced with just over a hundred men from two Parliamentarian ships, the Mary Rose and the Ann Joyce.|$|E
500|$|When Mary Godwin, Claire Clairmont, and Shelley {{returned}} from the Continent in September 1814, they took a house together in London, enraging Godwin still further. Imlay felt pulled between the two households: she felt loyal both to her sisters and to her father. Both despised her decision not to choose a side in the family drama. As Seymour explains, Imlay was in a difficult position: the Godwin household felt Shelley was a dangerous influence and the Shelley household ridiculed her fear of violating social conventions. Also, her aunts were considering her for a teaching position at this time, but were reluctant because of Godwin's shocking Memoirs of the Author of A Vindication of the Rights of Woman (1798). [...] Seymour writes, the [...] "few timid visits Fanny made to see Mary and [...] in London were acts of great courage; she <b>got</b> <b>little</b> thanks for them". Although instructed by Godwin not to speak to Shelley and her sisters, Imlay warned them of creditors who knew of Shelley's return (he also was in debt). Her attempts to persuade Clairmont {{to return to the}} Godwins' convinced Shelley that she was of Godwin's party and he began to distrust her. Imlay was also still responsible for soliciting money from Shelley in order to repay her father's debts; despite Shelley's essential elopement with two of his daughters, Godwin agreed to accept £1,200 from Shelley. When Mary Godwin gave birth to a daughter in February 1815, she immediately sent for Imlay, particularly as both she and the infant were ill. Godwin chastised Imlay for disobeying his orders not to see her half-sister and her misery increased. After the death of the child, Imlay paid more frequent visits to the couple.|$|E
