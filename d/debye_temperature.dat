50|$|In general {{there are}} two types of heat {{carriers}} in materials: phonons and electrons. The free electron gas found in metals is a very good conductor of heat and dominates thermal conductivity. All materials though exhibit heat transfer by phonon transport so heat flows even in dielectric materials such as silica. Interfacial thermal conductance is a measure of how efficiently heat carriers flow from one material to another. The lowest room temperature thermal conductance measurement to date is the Bi/Hydrogen-terminated diamond with a thermal conductance of 8.5 MW m−2 K−1. As a metal, bismuth contains many electrons which serve as the primary heat carriers. Diamond on the other hand is a very good electrical insulator (although it has a very high thermal conductivity) and so electron transport between the materials is nil. Further, these materials have very different lattice parameters so phonons do not efficiently couple across the interface. Finally, the <b>Debye</b> <b>temperature</b> between the materials is significantly different. As a result, bismuth, which has a low <b>Debye</b> <b>temperature,</b> has many phonons at low frequencies. Diamond on the other hand has a very high <b>Debye</b> <b>temperature</b> and most of its heat-carrying phonons are at frequencies much higher than are present in bismuth.|$|E
