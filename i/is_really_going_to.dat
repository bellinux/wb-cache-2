500|$|Looking {{back at the}} {{creation}} of the album, guitarist Frank Iero was blasé about [...] the band received for this decidedly [...] "non-scene" [...] record. [...] "When we did Three Cheers For Sweet Revenge, we didn't fit in," [...] he said. [...] "There was a little less screaming and a little more melody, but it was still us. Never was it a case of, 'Don't put that melody there because Hardcore Chuck, who took me to my first show at Fairfield American Legion Hall, <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be bummed at me.' I don’t give a shit: If I had to work at McDonald's {{for the rest of my}} life to play shows and ride in a shitty van on tour? I've done it. I'll do it again." ...|$|E
500|$|In April 2016, {{on moving}} the {{universe}} to Phase Four and reflecting on the first three, Feige said, [...] "I {{think there will be}} a finality to moments of Phase Three, as well as new beginnings that will mark a different, a [...] different, a distinctively different chapter in what will someday be a complete first saga made up of three phases." [...] Joe Russo added, [...] "You build things up and people enjoy the experiences you've built up. But then you kind of reach an apex or you reach a climax, a moment where you go, 'This structure <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> start to be repetitious if we do this again, so what do we do now?' So now, you deconstruct it. We're in the deconstruction phase with [...] and leading into , which are the culmination films." [...] A year later, Feige felt after the conclusion of Phase Three, Marvel might abandon grouping the films by phases, saying, [...] "it might be a new thing." ...|$|E
500|$|Rex Britten, {{portrayed by}} Dylan Minnette, is Michael's son who is {{featured}} in Michael's [...] "green reality". Green is Rex's favorite color. He is a teenage school student. Outside of school, Rex claims {{he is going}} to the beach, although he <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> his best friend Cole's house to work on a motorbike with him. Like Hannah, Rex is also very emotional, and often gets angry, due to Hannah's death in the crash. He kept a tennis racket to remain, and make him deal with Hannah's death. However, Cole accidentally broke it, Rex fights with him because of this. He later apologizes to him. He hates [...] "cereal and soda night" [...] because Michael doesn not cook [...] "actual food" [...] for dinner. Rex has an aunt named Carol, who is mentioned in [...] "Two Birds", in Michael's [...] "green reality". She wants {{to spend more time with}} Rex since the crash.|$|E

5000|$|The music video, {{directed}} by Evan Bernard, features Winona Ryder, Giovanni Ribisi and John C. Reilly as the Blues Explosion with Judah, Russell and Jon acting. The singer told MTV Online: [...] "I {{think that people}} <b>are</b> <b>really</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> surprised {{when they see the}} acting {{on the part of the}} Blues Explosion. When people get a load of some of the heavy, dramatic, really very intense scenes that we pulled out from our souls, I think people <b>are</b> <b>really</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> blown away...".|$|R
500|$|Rachel informs Monica (Courteney Cox) {{that she}} has managed to find two male nurses who {{would be willing to}} go out on a date with either of them. Monica declines the offer at first, not wanting to {{jeopardize}} her secret relationship with Chandler (Matthew Perry) but when he assumes she is willing to go out with nurse Dan, Monica decides to date him after all. Chandler in response asks a female nurse {{to go out on a}} date with him; she declines immediately, adding to his embarrassment. After Phoebe gives birth, Chandler approaches Monica in a hallway to ask if she <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> date Dan. She replies to him that since both of them are just [...] "goofing around", she figured why not [...] "goof around" [...] with Dan too; Chandler asks if Monica had checked up the term in the dictionary, noting the technical definition is “two friends who care a lot about each other, and have amazing sex, and just want to spend more time together”. Monica, smitten by Chandler's words, kisses him and goes to call off her date with Dan.|$|E
500|$|Because {{the use of}} {{medicinal}} {{marijuana is}} prominently featured in the episode, Fox had [...] "incredible fears" [...] about it and were very hesitant to have it broadcast. They especially disapproved of {{a scene in which}} Homer smokes marijuana for the first time, since {{they did not want to}} instruct children how to smoke. The staff discussed the scene for a long time with the network until they came up with a compromise. Just before the joint touches Homer's lips, the scene cuts to a psychedelic sequence that transpires from the joint's tip. Despite their concerns, Jean opined that the network gave the staff a [...] "pretty good amount" [...] of creative freedom with the episode. [...] " [...] obviously, the network didn't want us glorifying casual marijuana use", he said in an interview with the music magazine Relix. [...] " [...] like we usually do, we look at everything from two sides and it's supposed to be a thoughtful look at a serious thing". Despite the modification of the scene, the network and the series' staff members were still worried about how the episode would be received. [...] "Weeks before it aired, we were going 'This <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> kill everything...'", Jean said in the episode's DVD commentary.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{originally}} {{set to be}} {{filmed in}} Jakarta, permission to film in Indonesia was denied, so {{the bulk of the}} film was shot in the Philippines. Death threats against Weir and Gibson from Muslims who believed the film would be anti-Islam forced the production to move to Australia. Gibson downplayed the death threats, saying, [...] "It wasn't really that bad. We got a lot of death threats to be sure, but I just assumed that when there are so many, it must mean nothing <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> happen. I mean, if they meant to kill us, why send a note?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Of course I shouldn't do that," [...] she {{returned}} quietly. [...] "All the same, I do believe he <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do it--or something else. Do look!" ...|$|E

60|$|Hal smiled, {{and turned}} {{at once to}} the desk. A strange feeling filled his breast. He <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> turn detective--he, a country boy, and that, too, in New York.|$|R
6000|$|... "By the way, Colonel Colby, if it isn't {{asking too}} much, {{would you mind}} letting us know if Slugger Brown and Nappy Martell <b>are</b> <b>really</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> return here?" [...] {{questioned}} Fred.|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{she were}} {{going to stay in}} Paris--yes!" [...] he said. [...] "If she <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> Brazil, it matters little what she does. A Parisian, of course, would never bring his womankind here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How do {{you find}} yourself, my love?" [...] said Zenobia, lifting {{a corner of the}} gauze, and peeping beneath it with a mischievous smile. [...] "Ah, the dear little soul!

6000|$|... "It is so {{pleasant}} {{once more}} {{to be among the}} big things," [...] she declared. [...] "In Berlin I think they are not fond of me, and they are so pompous and secretive.

6000|$|... "In God's name, Auberon," [...] he {{suddenly}} volleyed out, startling the quiet hall, [...] "you don't {{mean that you}} <b>are</b> <b>really</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have these city guards and city walls and things?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No coffee, thanks," [...] Julien decided. [...] "If we <b>are</b> <b>really</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> {{spend the}} evening visiting places of {{entertainment}} {{of a similar}} class, let us reserve our coffee. A large cigar, I think." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "If this <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be {{a lesson}} to you, my boy, never to bet on {{the result of a}} golf-match, it will be a blessing in disguise. There {{is no such thing as}} a {{certainty}} in golf. I wonder if I ever told you a rather curious episode in the career of Vincent Jopp?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{glad the}} thaw is so complete," [...] said Hendrick, [...] "for it may perhaps clear away the snow altogether. It {{is too early}} for winter to begin in earnest. I would suggest now that we encamp again for a few days, {{to see whether the}} weather <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> change; hunt a little, and rest a while. What say you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{mean that}} there is any hurry about it, today; but we ought {{certainly}} to lay in as large a store as we can, of things that will keep. Some things we may get cheaper, in a short time, than we can now. A lot of the Jew and native traders will be leaving, if they see there <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be a siege; for you see, the town is quite open to the guns of batteries, {{on the other side of}} the neutral ground.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yet what is that, {{when one}} thinks, but {{just what she}} struck one as more or less persuaded that she herself <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be?"--this memory, for the full view, Fanny found herself also invoking.|$|R

6000|$|Mr. Giles seemed moved, for {{him almost}} a little embarrassed; {{he seemed to}} blush, and then he cleared his throat.

6000|$|The {{room was}} steady enough now, {{but she had}} lost the preternatural acuteness of her senses, and felt confused. She heard Barbara say: [...] "I can {{take you to the}} door in my cab," [...] and murmuring: [...] "I will get ready," [...] went into her bedroom. For a moment she was so utterly bewildered that she did nothing. Then every other thought was lost in a strange, soft, almost painful delight, as if some new {{instinct}} were being born in her; and quickly, but without confusion or hurry, she began packing. She put into a valise her own toilet things; then flannel, cotton-wool, eau de Cologne, hot-water bottle, Etna, shawls, thermometer, everything she had which could serve in illness. Changing to a plain dress, she took up the valise and returned to Barbara. They went out together to the cab. The moment it began to bear her to this ordeal at once so longed-for and so terrible, fear came over her again, so that she screwed herself into the corner, very white and still. She was aware of Barbara calling to the driver: [...] "Go by the Strand, and stop at a poulterer's for ice!" [...] And, when the bag of ice had been handed in, heard her saying: [...] "I will bring you all you want--if he <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be ill." ...|$|E
