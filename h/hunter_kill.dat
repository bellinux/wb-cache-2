50|$|The name koonj {{is derived}} from the Sanskrit word kraunch, which is a cognate Indo-European term for crane itself. In the mythology of Valmiki, the {{composer}} of the Hindu epic Ramayana, it is claimed that his first verse was inspired by the sight of a <b>hunter</b> <b>kill</b> the male of a pair of demoiselle cranes that were courting. Observing the lovelorn female circling and crying in grief, he cursed the hunter in verse. Since tradition held that all poetry prior to this moment had been revealed rather than created by man, this verse concerning the demoiselle cranes is regarded as the first human-composed meter.|$|E
40|$|The {{size of the}} {{population}} of ringed seals (Phoca hispida) inhabiting Baffin Bay and associated waters was estimated by two methods. An approximate model of the energetics of the polar bear (Ursus maritimus) estimated an energetic need of about 16, 000 MJ/bear per year. Modelled estimates of the energetic yield of a ringed seal population showed that a stable standing population of 140 - 170 ringed seals per bear would be needed to provide that much energy, assuming that all mortalities were due to polar bear predation. This result was sensitive to assumptions about the Field Metabolic Rate (FMR) of the bears and the energetic yield of individual ringed seals, but less sensitive to assumptions about relative incidence of predation on different age classes of seal or the age structure of the polar bear population. Estimated sizes of polar bear populations in Baffin Bay and associated waters (total about 4, 025), and of the standing population needed to support an estimated <b>hunter</b> <b>kill</b> of 100, 000 yielded a population estimate of, very roughly, 1. 2 million ringed seals. Estimates of ice areas and of the density of hauled out seals from aerial surveys were used to generate another approximate figure for the ringed seal population, which was about the same. The density of seals in the pack-ice area of Baffin Bay, which is imperfectly known, has a large influence on the latter estimate...|$|E

40|$|The Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem in the {{northern}} Rocky Mountains provides the context for a natural experiment to investigate the response of consumers to resources with differing spatial and temporal dispersion regimes. Grey wolves (Canis lupus) and human hunters both provide resource subsidies to scavengers by provisioning them with the remains of their <b>kills.</b> Carrion from <b>hunter</b> <b>kills</b> is highly aggregated {{in time and space}} whereas carrion from wolf kills is more dispersed in both time and space. We estimated the total amount of carrion consumed by each scavenger species at both wolf and <b>hunter</b> <b>kills</b> over 4 years. Species with large feeding radii [bald eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) and ravens (Corpus corax) ], defined as the area over which a consumer can efficiently locate and integrate resources, dominated consumption at the highly aggregated <b>hunter</b> <b>kills</b> whereas competitively dominant species [coyotes (Canis latrans) ] dominated at the more dispersed wolf kills. In addition, species diversity and the evenness of carrion consumption between scavengers was greater at wolf <b>kills</b> than at <b>hunter</b> <b>kills</b> while the total number of scavengers at <b>hunter</b> <b>kills</b> exceeded those at wolf kills. From a community perspective, the top-down effect of predation is likely to be stronger in the vicinity of highly aggregated resource pulses as species with large feeding radii switch to feeding on alternative prey once the resource pulse subsides...|$|R
