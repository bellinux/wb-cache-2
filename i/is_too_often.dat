When Burt's son Kurt (Chris Colfer) accuses her of lying, Sue defends her tactics, and tells Kurt that his own campaign for senior class president is boring and lacks edge. When the presidential candidates make their assembly speeches, Kurt pledges to ban dodgeball, a sport he says <b>is</b> <b>too</b> <b>often</b> used to bully. Rachel (Lea Michele) withdraws her candidacy and urges everyone to vote for Kurt. Rachel later confesses to Kurt that she quit {{so that he could}} have something important to put on his college application, and because she missed being his friend. The two make up, and go to work on Kurt's campaign.|$|E

500|$|In {{addition}} to Dixon's commercial {{role as a}} model and representative for the cosmetics company Avon on International Women's Day 2012, Dixon launched the company's Pass It On campaign to highlight domestic abuse issues in the UK by encouraging {{the purchase of a}} necklace, described by her as [...] "a symbol of women's empowerment, and infinite possibilities for women". All the proceeds from Avon's necklace campaign were donated to Refuge and Women's Aid. In March 2013 Dixon led a walk down Westminster Bridge to the Houses of Parliament to raise awareness of domestic violence. Regarding the walk, Dixon commented that [...] "awareness of domestic violence is still shockingly low and that's why it's so important that we raise awareness about a subject that <b>is</b> <b>too</b> <b>often</b> ignored".|$|E
500|$|Stuart Jones of The Times {{concluded}} in his match report that The Football Association (FA) were given no choice, [...] "but to charge Arsenal and Manchester United with misconduct and with bringing the game into disrepute." [...] United took immediate action by conducting an internal enquiry. Ferguson ordered his players {{to the training}} ground, where they rewatched the match. It is believed the club later fined Irwin, McClair and Ince. Arsenal followed United's example; participants Davis, Rocastle, Thomas, Limpar and Winterburn were all penalised, as well as manager Graham, who was fined £9,000. Arsenal chairman Peter Hill-Wood said of his decision: [...] "Twice in two years <b>is</b> <b>too</b> <b>often.</b> The name of Arsenal has been sullied {{and that is why}} I have taken this action." ...|$|E

500|$|However, {{there were}} some {{criticism}} directed at the list of drugs used in the chorus of [...] "Devil Pray". Chris Richards from The Washington Post criticized {{the fact that the}} [...] "lyrics on Rebel Heart feel almost violently resistant to wisdom", citing the menu of intoxicants used in the chorus and asking, [...] "Which one will best help us forget that this is happening?" [...] Andrew Unterberger of Spin also wrote about the [...] "laundry list of intoxicants" [...] referenced in the song, noting that it [...] "makes 'Devil Pray' sound like a mid-80s PSA." [...] Jessica Hopper of Pitchfork Media went on to criticize the list for being [...] "a strange, tender, comical thing, [...] but ultimately, it's a boring stadium-throb lite-EDM song about seeking sobriety and/or big-G, God. It's also a Madonna-doing-Madonna cliche , which <b>is</b> <b>too</b> <b>often</b> the downfall of Rebel Heart." [...] Alexis Petridis of The Guardian was negative about [...] "Devil Pray"'s production, claiming that [...] " [...] a pretty transparent attempt by Avicii {{to come up with something}} along the lines of his hit 'Wake Me Up'." ...|$|E
500|$|Benson Lee Grayson {{suggested}} that the Fillmore administration's ability to avoid potential problems <b>is</b> <b>too</b> <b>often</b> overlooked. Fillmore's constant attention to Mexico avoided a resumption {{of the war and}} laid the groundwork for the Gadsden Treaty during Pierce's presidency. Meanwhile, the Fillmore administration resolved a controversy with Portugal left over from the Taylor administration, [...] smoothed over a disagreement with Peru over guano islands, and peacefully resolved disputes with Britain, France, and Spain over Cuba. All of these crises were resolved without the United States going to war or losing face. Grayson also applauded Fillmore's firm stand against Texas' ambitions in New Mexico during the 1850 crisis. Fred I. Greenstein and Dale Anderson praised Fillmore for his resoluteness in his early months in office, noting that Fillmore [...] "is typically described as stolid, bland, and conventional, but such terms underestimate the forcefulness evinced by his handling of the Texas–New Mexico border crisis, his decision to replace Taylor's entire cabinet, and his effectiveness in advancing the Compromise of 1850".|$|E
500|$|Taft {{has been}} rated among the {{greatest}} of the chief justices; later Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia noted that this was [...] "not {{so much on the}} basis of his opinions, perhaps because many of them ran counter to the ultimate sweep of history". A successor as chief justice, Earl Warren, concurred: [...] "In Taft's case, the symbol, the tag, the label usually attached to him is 'conservative.' It is certainly not of itself a term of opprobrium even when bandied by the critics, but its use <b>is</b> <b>too</b> <b>often</b> confused with 'reactionary.'" [...] Most commentators agree that as chief justice, Taft's most significant contribution was his advocacy for reform of the high court, urging and ultimately gaining improvement in the court's procedures and facilities. Mason cited enactment of the Judges' Bill of 1925 as Taft's major achievement on the court. According to Anderson, Taft as chief justice [...] "was as aggressive in the pursuit of his agenda in the judicial realm as Theodore Roosevelt was in the presidential".|$|E
5000|$|He {{continues}} later: [...] "The weakest {{points of}} the team were: (1) The absence of a reliable wicket-keeper, and (2) The bad judgment that <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>often</b> displayed when running".|$|R

500|$|The BBC's own website {{regarded}} Quatermass II unfavourably when reviewing its DVD {{release in}} 2005. [...] "The script <b>is</b> <b>too</b> <b>often</b> let {{down by the}} production's rougher edges. Your heart will break halfway through episode six as it all falls apart. And then there's Monica Gray [...] — less an actress than a finishing school on legs." [...] Writing in The Times in 2006, Morgan Falconer claimed to find racist undertones in the serial. [...] "Quatermass, for instance, often seemed to have an unhealthy preoccupation with blackness, a barely veiled commentary on racial change in Britain. In one scene in Quatermass II, the Professor stands outside a pub and watches the sky fill with dark asteroids. 'They’re coming in their thousands,' he says, 'this is it.'" [...] However, this interpretation of the serial is not widespread, and is undermined in episode five where an Irish immigrant helps Quatermass sabotage the aliens' food supply system. In any case, it is in direct contrast with Kneale's deliberate attack on racial intolerance in Quatermass and the Pit.|$|E
500|$|The {{production}} reached New York in January 1985, {{running for}} 191 performances at the Broadway Theatre, with Brynner, Peil, Welch and West still playing their roles. The part of Eliza was {{played by the}} leading man's fourth wife, Kathy Lee Brynner, and newcomer Jeffrey Bryan Davis played Louis. During the run, Brynner was unable to sing [...] "A Puzzlement", due to what was announced as a throat and ear infection, but he [...] "projected bursting vitality {{to the top of}} the balcony." [...] He received a special Tony Award for his role as the King and had come to dominate the musical to such an extent that Peil was nominated merely for a featured actress Tony as Anna. Leigh was nominated for a Tony for his direction. New York Times critic Frank Rich praised Brynner but was ambivalent about the production, which he called [...] "sluggish", writing that Brynner's [...] "high points included his fond, paternalistic joshing with his brood in 'The March of the Siamese Children,' his dumb-show antics while attempting to force the English schoolteacher Anna to bow, and, of course, the death scene.... The star aside, such showmanship <b>is</b> <b>too</b> <b>often</b> lacking in this King and I." [...] The last performance was a special Sunday night show, on June 30, 1985, in honor of Brynner and his 4,625th performance of the role. [...] Brynner died less than four months later, on October 10, 1985.|$|E

2500|$|Statues honoring de Gaulle {{have been}} erected in Warsaw, Moscow, Bucharest and Quebec.

2500|$|In 1978 he {{published}} an essay entitled The Pleasure of Architecture {{in which he}} used sexual intercourse as a characterizing analogy for architecture. He claimed that architecture by nature is fundamentally useless, setting it apart from [...] "building". He demands a glorification of architectural uselessness in which the chaos of sensuality and the order of purity combine to form structures that evoke the space {{in which they are}} built. He distinguishes between the forming of knowledge and the knowledge of form, contending that architecture <b>is</b> <b>too</b> <b>often</b> dismissed as the latter when it can often be used as the former. Tschumi used this essay as a precursor to a later eponymous series of writings detailing the so-called limits of architecture.|$|E
2500|$|In Canada and abroad, the {{linguistic}} policy of Quebec <b>is</b> <b>too</b> <b>often</b> negatively perceived. The {{business community and}} the media in particular know it very little. For their part, the Americans remain opposed to a legislation that appears to them to reduce individual liberties and limit the use of English. For them, language and culture are two separate elements, {{they do not see}} how the protection of Quebec culture also includes the protection of the French language, even though 35 American States have adopted declarations proclaiming English the official language. Thus, must be developed the perception that Quebec culture {{is a part of the}} North-American heritage and that it is necessary to preserve it. It is also important to correct the erroneous perceptions regarding the Quebec language policy and its application.|$|E
50|$|During {{investigations}} of USDA policies and operations, the USDA's Secretary of Agriculture {{reported that the}} process for resolving discrimination complaints had failed. He testified that the USDA has not acted in good faith on the complaints: appeals <b>were</b> <b>too</b> <b>often</b> delayed and for too long; favorable decisions <b>were</b> <b>too</b> <b>often</b> reversed. The USDA Inspector General reported that the discrimination complaint process lacked integrity, direction, and accountability. There were staffing problems, obsolete procedures, and little direction from management, {{which resulted in a}} climate of disorder. In response, in 1998, Congress tolled the statute of limitations for USDA discrimination complaints, which allowed the Pigford class to bring this suit.|$|R

[...] Stylus magazine wrote that Duff's attempt to follow [...] "the [...] template that she previously softened" [...] yielded [...] "mixed results ... to a certain extent, [...] is a prisoner of her image and her attempts at Chrissie Hynde-intensity fall far short of even Ashlee Simpson's gravelly vocal cords."

But {{there is much more}} to the Jewish state than missiles and prayers. In his debut as a documentary filmmaker, adult-film entrepreneur and political columnist Michael Lucas examines a side of Israel that <b>is</b> <b>too</b> <b>often</b> overlooked: its thriving gay community. Undressing Israel features interviews with a diverse range of local men, including a gay member of Israel’s parliament, a trainer who served openly in the army, a young Arab-Israeli journalist, and a pair of dads raising their kids. Lucas also visits Tel Aviv’s vibrant nightlife scene—and even attends a same-sex wedding—in this guided tour of a country that has emerged as a pioneer for gay integration and equality." ...|$|E
