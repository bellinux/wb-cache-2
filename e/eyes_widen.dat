6000|$|That, old mare, {{at sight}} whereof your wise <b>eyes</b> <b>widen</b> till {{they are ready}} to burst, and your ears are first shot forward towards your nose, and then laid back with vicious intent. Stand still, old woman! Do you think still, after fifteen winters, that you can catch a fox? ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{thought that}} I saw Thurid's <b>eyes</b> <b>widen</b> a bit during the narrative, and several times I {{surprised}} him gazing intently {{into my face}} through narrowed lids. Was he commencing to suspect? And then Kulan Tith told of the savage calot that fought beside me, and after that I saw suspicion {{in the eyes of}} Matai Shang--or did I but imagine it? ...|$|E
60|$|The lady {{started as}} {{she gazed at}} me, and her tired <b>eyes</b> <b>widened.</b> She {{clutched}} Mr. Riddle's arm.|$|R
60|$|Although Victoria {{said this}} very simply, the mother's <b>eyes</b> <b>widened</b> until one might almost {{have said they}} {{expressed}} a kind of terror.|$|R
6000|$|... "Pan! Pan!" [...] she cried, {{and moved}} toward him, her <b>eyes</b> <b>widening,</b> shining with a light {{he had never seen}} in another woman's.|$|R
6000|$|He had {{forgotten}} where he sat, {{but he was}} not neglecting his hostess. He took a satanic satisfaction in seeing her lovely <b>eyes</b> <b>widen</b> and glow as he went on. Subtly flattering her by including her among the very few who could understand his ideals, he seemed to draw her apart to his side--appealing to her for support against the coarse and foolish hosts represented by the Mosses, while Marshall Haney sat in a kind of stupor, his eyes alone speaking, as if to ask: [...] "What the divil is the little man with the cough so hot about?" ...|$|E
60|$|Sinister beauty! Dorn soon {{lost sight}} of that. There came a gnawing at his vitals. The far scene of action could not hold his gaze. That dark, uneven, hummocky break in the earth, which was a goodly number of rods distant, yet now seemed close, drew a startling attention. Dorn felt his <b>eyes</b> <b>widen</b> and pop. Spots and dots, shiny, illusive, bobbed along that break, behind the mounds, beyond the farther banks. A yell as from one lusty throat ran {{along the line of}} which Dorn's squad held the center. Dorn's sight had a {{piercing}} intensity. All was hard under his grip--his rifle, the boards and bags against which he leaned. Corporal Owens rose beside him, bareheaded, to call low and fiercely to his men.|$|E
50|$|When Nene sees Jojo, her <b>eyes</b> <b>widen</b> and {{her heart}} seems to have dropped.But when Jojo {{tried to talk to}} her, nothing else came out of her but anger.|$|E
60|$|Pantaloon's great countenance grew pale, {{his little}} <b>eyes</b> <b>widened</b> to their fullest extent as he conned {{the face of}} his companion. Then he exploded.|$|R
60|$|But he {{was quite}} dumb. She fetched him a sharp slap on the face. He started, and his <b>eyes</b> <b>widened.</b> Then his face darkened with defiance, after all.|$|R
6000|$|Jeb Case's {{jaw dropped}} and his <b>eyes</b> <b>widened.</b> [...] "You're {{in the wrong}} pasture, bub," [...] he remarked feelingly. [...] "What yer lookin' fer is Sears, Roebuck & Company." ...|$|R
50|$|Jeffrey {{will be on}} {{the local}} radio station and able to tell the entire town the secret. Sayers cannot make it to the station to stop the {{disclosure}} but he is able to reach Amanda in time to smash her radio. She then points out that she has already been visited by two townspeople, and that she has something very important to tell him. She whispers in his ear, and his <b>eyes</b> <b>widen</b> in dawning comprehension.|$|E
5000|$|Watching Bill suffer unimaginable pain is {{more than}} Liz can bear, and despite her scruples, her love for Bill surmounts everything. She hears him beg for mercy and she pulls the plug out of his respirator. Within seconds he is dead. Snapper discovers his father had died and his <b>eyes</b> <b>widen</b> when he sees Liz {{standing}} in the shadows, the wall plug on the floor. Thinking quickly, he takes her home, warning her {{to say nothing of}} what has happened. But he forgot to replug the respirator! ...|$|E
50|$|Eddie gets {{involved}} with a struggling bar band, and his passion for music—along with his desperate anger—resurface. He decides to confront Eddie's talents once and for all. Eddie ("Joe West") challenges the bar band's talent, accepts an invitation to play and quickly dazzles the audience and the band's members. Eddie abruptly leaves the stage, disturbed by memories of Wendall Newton while Hilton plays a brief sax solo. Guitarist Rick Diesel pursues Eddie and badgers him about joining the band. Eddie finally begins to play again and the two circulate through Montreal's music scene, hand-picking musicians for a new band, Rock Solid. One of the recruits, saxophone player Hilton Overstreet, remarks at his audition that you can always identify a guitarist {{by the way he}} plays. His <b>eyes</b> <b>widen</b> when he hears Eddie on guitar, but he says nothing about his suspicions.|$|E
60|$|He stopped. His china-blue <b>eyes</b> <b>widened.</b> His {{shoulders}} shot {{forward to}} a rigid stoop of astonishment. His mouth opened. He gasped as they ran to join the gathering crowd.|$|R
60|$|She {{began to}} be alarmed. Her <b>eyes</b> <b>widened</b> in fear. All sorts of vague horrors sprang unbidden into her brain. She still had the mist of sleep in her brain.|$|R
60|$|The rising {{tears were}} checked by terror at {{this change in}} Tito's voice. Tessa turned very pale, and sat in {{trembling}} silence, with her blue <b>eyes</b> <b>widened</b> by arrested tears.|$|R
5000|$|Coca-Cola {{released}} a television ad in Argentina called [...] "Parents" [...] to promote Coca-Cola Life. Marketing in Argentina was focused, much {{like in the}} U.K, around healthy lifestyles. [...] "Parents" [...] is a humorous commercial featuring a young married couple receiving news about their first pregnancy. The commercial shows the parents going through common hardships of young parenthood, such as getting little sleep, having a toddler make a mess in the house, etc. Toward {{the end of the}} commercial, the father closes his eyes and takes a long drink from a Coca-Cola Life bottle. He opens his eyes, and while still drinking, his wife shows him a [...] "positive" [...] pregnancy test result. What appears to be a look of horror on the father's face (his <b>eyes</b> <b>widen)</b> turns into a look of joy and excitement.|$|E
5000|$|Peter arrives safely at the {{monorail}} with Walter and Olivia, {{without telling}} them how he escaped. Walter worries {{that he sees}} Cecil's death as an acceptable loss, an attitude that his former self used to have and worries that he is reverting to this colder personality, as a side-effect of having the previously removed portions of his brain restored (as occurred in [...] "Letters of Transit"). Peter gently reassures him {{that he will not}} let that happen, as he holds Walter's hands between his. Olivia, seated further down the aisle, looks at them and smiles tenderly; Peter gives a slight smile then returns his attention to Walter. A few seconds later, he looks back up down the aisle and sees the world the way the Observers see it, machine-like and devoid of most colors. His <b>eyes</b> <b>widen</b> in surprise as the episode ends.|$|E
5000|$|Jedahs {{offensive}} arsenal {{features a}} level of graphic violence previously unseen in the otherwise comedic atmosphere of the Darkstalkers games. He uses no traditional punches or kicks; instead, his special moves (which all have Italian names, in allusion to Dantes Inferno) involve self-mutilation: he uses his own blood as a weapon in conjunction with him beheading himself, ripping his hands from his arms to strike opponents at a distance, or extending from his fingertips long claws composed entirely of blood, with his appendages promptly regenerating each time. His [...] "Finale Rosso" [...] super move (an unblockable special used by all the games characters that inflicts heavy damage onto opponents) features opposing players being forcefully submerged into a deep pool of blood and then pummeled {{by a series of}} disembodied hands as Jedah laughs manically. His personalized stage in the games final boss fight is the cavernous interior of an alien uterus that contains phallic imagery and a demonic humanoid fetus (named the [...] "Fetus of God") with an exposed brain. When players emerge victorious on this level, the background shakes as the fetuss <b>eyes</b> <b>widen</b> and its body begins spasming. Capcom producer Derek Neal called the stage [...] "possibly the most disturbing thing in these Darkstalkers games." ...|$|E
6000|$|The girl's <b>eyes</b> <b>widened</b> {{with awe}} of the big, silent, dark world he indicated. [...] "Aren't you afraid to start out on such a trip alone--I mean, don't you dread it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|She had put {{her hand}} up to her breast, her face was colourless, her <b>eyes</b> <b>widened</b> by alarm. Then seeming to master herself, she {{inclined}} her head, and said: [...] "Very well." ...|$|R
6000|$|Her <b>eyes</b> <b>widened</b> just a line, {{but they}} did not waver. [...] "I should like to hear from you," [...] she said cordially. [...] "I'd like {{to know what you think}} of those pamphlets, which I'll surely send." ...|$|R
50|$|At this point, {{lead singer}} Dero enters {{disguised}} as a clown, although with no bright or colorful makeup, rather black lipstick and eyeliner and black clothing with a priest's collar. He smirks briefly at twin girls by the doorway and the twins' eyes flash black for a moment. He then proceeds to perform magic tricks for the party guests, however the tricks are not particularly astounding and rather this sequence features him with a handkerchief in his mouth, smiling demonically at the children whilst the adults applaud enthusiastically. Dero continues to smile freakishly as he gestures for the birthday boy's mother to come closer. He blindfolds her and spins her in a circle, much like she were about to play Blind man's bluff or a similar game. The boy's mother begins to walk forwards into the small crowd of children, who are watching her. Trying to feel her way with her hands outstretched, the mother wanders into a small windowless cell, where her son is standing. He is holding a small gift-wrapped box, perhaps one of his birthday gifts. His mother removes her blindfold and her <b>eyes</b> <b>widen</b> in fear {{at the sight of}} her son standing there. What happens to her from then is unknown, however there is a short split-second shot of her hand limply dropping the blindfold she was holding.|$|E
5000|$|Flagg’s {{character}} has its detractors. In his essay [...] "The Glass-Eyed Dragon", author L. Sprague de Camp criticizes Flagg in Eyes of the Dragon, {{saying that he}} is one of the least-believable characters in the book and too evil to be credible. According to de Camp, absolute evil is hard to envision; whereas Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin believed they were improving the world, Flagg only enjoys causing destruction and chaos. De Camp notes that Flagg fails to see that there is no advantage to his actions. Walter's <b>eyes</b> <b>widen,</b> and for a moment he looks deeply hurt. This may be absurd, but Callahan is looking into the man's deep eyes and feels sure that the emotion is nonetheless genuine. And the surety robs him of any last hope that all this might be a dream, or a final brilliant interval before true death. In dreams—his, at least—the bad guys, the scary guys, never have complex emotions. Stephen King, Wolves of the Calla Flagg's embodiment of evil is not the only characteristic seen by critics. Author Joseph Reino commented that the character's presence in The Stand was [...] "Stephen King's version of a pestilential Big Brother". Tony Magistrale revisits the character in a second book, this time comparing him to Norman Mailer. Here, Magistrale states that in The Stand Flagg gives the reader an [...] "illustration of King’s jaundiced perspective of modern America” as he presents the consequences of technology-worship and the sacrifice of [...] "moral integrity to the quest for synthetic productivity".|$|E
5000|$|Steffy's {{tribute to}} Brooke reveals Oliver and Brooke's mistaken hook up and Hope's <b>eyes</b> <b>widen</b> in embarrassment and terror as Ridge tries {{to calm down}} and stop the media and camera flashes from going out of control. She sees the guilty look on Brooke's face and Oliver's and is shocked when she realizes it's true. Hope who still is a virgin comes close to having a nervous {{breakdown}} as she constantly imagines her mother and boyfriend having sexual intercourse {{over and over again}} in her mind.Also what angered her was that he would think she'd be so freaky enough to want her first time to be in public being banged up against a wall. She was a romantic and had a romantic soul and thought he understood that about her and she'd want it to be special with roses, soft music and candlelight, not with loud obnoxious music and lights flashing everywhere. That she felt she couldn't forgive him for and it was a sign to her that he really didn't know her. According to Oliver, the music and lights disoriented him and he heard her say the words [...] "I'm ready." [...] And she told him she'd say that when she wanted to have that moment. And when he heard her mom say it to him and he was dressed up like her dad he had no idea it was Brooke since the four of them were dressed alike. She tells him it doesn't matter. He should have known by her eye color and by her personality. He tells her he just loved her so much and wanted her so bad and that that's how he loved her. If she wanted him to love her anywhere then he'd love her there. It still didn't faze Hope who was disappointed with him and she tells him, [...] "You just wanted to get laid." [...] Several times she tries to forgive him but is unable to do so since Brooke raised her to have a moralistic mindset as opposed to the loose carefree mindset her mother has. Hope was raised in a conservative manner while her mother exhibits more of a liberal mentality.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is Cliff!" [...] {{she cried}} out. [...] "He's on our trail!" [...] And {{into her face}} came a look of alarm. Her lips paled, her <b>eyes</b> <b>widened.</b> [...] "He's mad--he's dangerous! Leave him to me," [...] she added, in a low, tense voice.|$|R
60|$|There was {{no doubt}} or {{hesitation}} about the date this time. It was grappled to his memory by hoops of steel owing to the singular coincidence of it being also his telephone number. He gave {{it out with a}} roll, and the girl's <b>eyes</b> <b>widened.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Her bright <b>eyes</b> <b>widened</b> to {{an almost}} {{electric}} glare; and yet it seemed rather bewilderment than confusion or fear. [...] "Why, what can you mean?" [...] she cried. [...] "All the servants {{were out of the}} house, seeing the theatricals. And we don't keep a butler, thank goodness!" ...|$|R
6000|$|He added this {{question}} in a soothing tone, as he saw her <b>eyes</b> <b>widening</b> sorrowfully, and {{the corners of her}} mouth falling. She said nothing at first; she only opened her apron and looked down at her apricots and sweetmeats. Then she looked up at him again and said complainingly-- ...|$|R
6000|$|Her <b>eyes</b> <b>widened.</b> Her gaze deepened. She clipped her {{forefinger}} in sign of agreement. [...] "It {{was very}} cold {{up there in}} winter. We were often hungry, for the game had all been driven to the plain and we could not follow. Many of our children died. All died but one." ...|$|R
60|$|A {{woman was}} {{watering}} flowers {{at the edge}} of a lawn. She straightened up as his team of horses came near. Her <b>eyes</b> <b>widened</b> in astonishment--and then fear. Her mouth fell open in a soundless O and her sprinkling can slipped from her fingers and rolled silently onto the lawn.|$|R
60|$|The {{newcomer}} had addressed her in Spanish, and as {{he heard}} her reply, in pure and liquid English, his <b>eyes</b> <b>widened</b> a trifle; but the familiar smile with which he had greeted her left his face, and his parting bow was much more dignified though no less profound than its predecessor.|$|R
60|$|Miriam {{looked at}} him, her large black <b>eyes</b> <b>widening</b> and kindling. For an instant she felt for her poniard--and then burst into an agony of tears, hid {{her face in}} her {{withered}} hands, and rushed from the room, as a crash and shout below announced the bursting of the door.|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Harding {{sinks into}} a chair. He keeps {{shivering}} and saying, [...] "I tell you, I can't; I can't. She wouldn't understand." [...] The letter is fluttering in his hand. His face is contemptible. He does it splendidly. Lady Cicely picks {{the letter from}} his hand. She reads it aloud, her <b>eyes</b> <b>widening</b> as she reads: ...|$|R
