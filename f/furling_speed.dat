40|$|AbstractThe Bees Algorithm is a {{recently}} developed optimization technique that mimics the foraging behavior of honey bees in nature. This study investigates {{the use of}} the Bees Algorithm for the selection of the optimal operating speed parameters for wind power units. Three speed parameters need to be optimized, namely, the rated, cut-in, and cut-off (<b>furling)</b> <b>speed</b> of the turbine. The aim of the optimization process is to maximize the yearly power yield and turbine usage time. The choice of the best parameters depends from the wind frequency distribution at the site of installation. Eleven locations on the coastal areas of Egypt were chosen as case studies. The well-known Particle Swarm Optimization was used as a control optimization algorithm. A popular classical approach based on the manual optimization of the sole rated speed was used as baseline for the comparison of results. The optimization of all the three speed parameters and the use of intelligent optimization techniques represent the novelties of this paper. The study showed that the Bees Algorithm outperformed the other two optimization methods. The proposed algorithm was able to find speed parameters that greatly enhanced the power yield, without compromising the usage time or significantly increasing the capital costs. The comparison between the standard manual optimization method and the two intelligent optimization techniques proved the superiority of the latter ones...|$|E

This system can avoid the wind turbine damage from high wind <b>speeds.</b> <b>Furling</b> {{automatic system}} work based on wind speed, if wind speed exceeds the maximum limit the automatic furling system will work with moving the surface of the blade against the wind direction, so the result the blade surface area (A) which deal with the direction the wind is making wind turbine moves vertical or horizontal. This system uses two methods, vertical system method is by using the hinge spring mounted in the turbine body that moves up and down, when the wind speed exceeds the maximum limit then the system will slow movement of the blade, and method of the horizontal system where using the simple hinge mounted at the tail pivot (shaft tail), when wind speed exceeds the maximum limit the turbine will move horizontally, so that will slow the blade rotation. Furling automatic system has not been widely used in wind turbine, so that its development has not been so widespread, especially in Indonesia which is currently developing wind turbine technology for alternative energy. Benefits of use this system can prevent wind turbine damage caused by excessive wind speeds. Technology used in this system is very efficient because it does not require a complicated design. This system also functions as a controller of the blade rotation rate caused wind speed and used in small-scale wind turbines horizontal axis type. One of the standard horizontal wind turbine blade from the USA is the NREL (National Renewable Energy Laboratory, USA) consists of 25 airfoil design. Selection of the blade type based on blade length and power generators that will be used. This design has been developed since 1984. This research will use this type of blade from NREL Thick-Airfoil Family for Small blade type S 822 and S 823. Based on the calculation of automatic furling system, the obtained results blade used to modeling is the NREL Thick-Airfoil Family for Small blade type S 822 and S 823 with tail length 104. 5 cm and weight 8. 50 kgm/s 2. The focus of the tail is located at coordinates Xc = 81. 84 cm, Yc = 3. 73 cm with the left end as a reference. Tail pivot angle of 20 Â°, so that the corners of the minimum and maximum permitted by the design include a pivot point of the tail are 20 Â°- 110 Â°, blade angle 0 Â°- 90 Â°, and angle of tail lift 0 Â°- 45 Â°. And obtained the connection between the tail blade angle to angle with the motion equation y = 0. 5 x...|$|R
