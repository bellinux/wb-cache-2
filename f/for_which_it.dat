5|$|In January 1945, XXBomber Command began {{preparations}} to redeploy to the Mariana Islands.

As there were few industrial targets within range of Kharagpur, the highest priority was given to attacking shipping in major ports such as Rangoon, Bangkok and Singapore as well as smaller harbours. Attacks were conducted through both conventional bombing and laying naval mines. As part of the transition, LeMay departed for the Mariana Islands on 18 January {{and was replaced by}} Brigadier General Roger M. Ramsey.|$|E
