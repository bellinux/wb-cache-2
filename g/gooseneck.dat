5|$|Buffalo Creek {{begins in}} Hartley Township, in Union County, near the Union County/Centre County border. It flows east and {{slightly}} north between Buffalo Mountain and Branch Mountain before falling steeply through two geographical features {{known as the}} <b>Gooseneck</b> and Buffalo Gap. The creek then turns southeast and flows out of Hartley Township. Upon leaving Hartley Township, the creek enters Lewis Township and meanders eastward, south of Jones Mountain. It passes through the Mifflinburg Reservoir. The creek then flows into southern West Buffalo Township and northern Mifflinburg. Shortly before exiting West Buffalo Township, Buffalo Creek picks up its tributary North Branch Buffalo Creek and briefly turns northwards before turning eastward again and leaving the township.|$|E
25|$|The M1000 has 40 wheels (215/75R 17.5 tires) across five axle lines, {{these with}} two {{half-width}} axles per line. Each axle has hydraulic pendular suspension providing a 254mm stroke with lateral oscillation accommodating surface undulations. A hydraulic suspension system is also provided on the pivoting <b>gooseneck</b> to equalise fifth wheel loads. Weight of the M1000 is 22,882kg. Payload {{according to the}} U.S. Army is 63,560kg, although the manufacturer quotes 80,000kg at reduced speeds. Overall length is 15.8 m, deck length is 10.58 m; deck width is 3.05 m, 3.66 m for a wide deck version.|$|E
25|$|The spars are {{designed}} by C and fabricated by Offshore Spars. The standard boat has a keel stepped non-tapered double spreader masthead sloop rig, with rod rigging and a hydraulic backstay adjuster. the R and XL variants have a tapered triple-spreader mast with all rod rigging, plus runners, checkstays, and an adjustable babystay for mast bend control. The backstay is split, with two hydraulic rams, on the boats with walk through transom (37+ and XL). The masthead, <b>gooseneck</b> and boom end are custom machined aluminum, welded {{to the one}} piece extrusion. The aerodynamic spreaders are secured to the mast via machined, continuous aluminum spreader bars. They precisely fit the spreader bases and traverse the mast and along with separate support bars carry the compression loads exerted by the shrouds. On the 37R (and 37XL) mast the middle and lower spreaders are slightly swept back, 2° for the middle spreaders, 4° for the lowers.|$|E

50|$|The route descends Cedar Mesa at Moki Dugway, {{and enters}} the scenic Valley of the Gods. A few miles through the valley is the turnoff for <b>Goosenecks</b> State Park; shortly after, UT-261 ends at U.S. Route 163.|$|R
25|$|Probably {{the best}} known closed {{captioning}} option for film theaters is the Rear Window Captioning System from the National Center for Accessible Media. Upon entering the theater, viewers requiring captions are given a panel of flat translucent glass or plastic on a <b>gooseneck</b> stalk, which can be mounted {{in front of the}} viewer's seat. In the back of the theater is an LED display that shows the captions in mirror image. The panel reflects captions for the viewer but is nearly invisible to surrounding patrons. The panel can be positioned so that the viewer watches the movie through the panel, and captions appear either on or near the movie image. A company called Cinematic Captioning Systems has a similar reflective system called Bounce Back. A major problem for distributors has been that these systems are each proprietary, and require separate distributions to the theater to enable them to work. Proprietary systems also incur license fees.|$|E
25|$|During the 1938 racing season Meier, rode a BMW RS 255 Kompressor in both European and German Championships. For the 1938 Isle of Man TT, Meier {{was entered}} by the BMW team along with Jock West and Karl Gall. The BMW team {{suffered}} setbacks when Karl Gall {{was injured in}} a crash during an unofficial practice, {{was found in a}} ditch above the <b>Gooseneck,</b> and was unable to race. On the startline for the 1938 Senior TT Race, one of the BMW mechanics stripped a cylinder-head thread during a spark plug change on the engine of Meier's Type 255 machine. Trying to start the 1938 Senior race on one cylinder, Meier soon retired on lap one at the bottom of Bray Hill. The race was won Harold Daniell riding for Norton at an average race speed of 89.11mph and Jock West riding the works supercharged BMW finished in 5th place at an average race speed of 85.92mph. In 1938, Meier {{went on to win the}} 500cc Belgium Grand Prix at Spa-Francorchamps, the 500cc Dutch TT, the German Grand Prix at the Hohenstein-Ernstthal (or Sachsenring) road course and the Italian Grand Prix at Monza. The 500cc 1938 Ulster Grand Prix was won by BMW teammate Jock West and Meier became the 1938 500cc European Motor-Cycle Champion.|$|E
500|$|Hot-chamber die casting, {{also known}} as <b>gooseneck</b> machines, rely upon a pool of molten metal to feed the die. At the {{beginning}} of the cycle the piston of the machine is retracted, which allows the molten metal to fill the [...] "gooseneck". The pneumatic- or hydraulic-powered piston then forces this metal out of the <b>gooseneck</b> into the die. The advantages of this system include fast cycle times (approximately 15 cycles a minute) and the convenience of melting the metal in the casting machine. The disadvantages of this system are that it is limited to use with low-melting point metals and that aluminium cannot be used because it picks up some of the iron while in the molten pool. Therefore, hot-chamber machines are primarily used with zinc-, tin-, and lead-based alloys.|$|E

500|$|Through West Valley, {{the route}} remains residential, quickly leaving the hamlet. North of West Valley, NY240 and CR32 {{intersect}} with the eastern terminus of CR86 (Thornwood Drive). Crossing through another {{long stretch of}} residences, the routes cross a railroad track at-grade, where they turn to the northwest, paralleling the tracks until turning north and away once again. NY240 and CR32 bend northwest at Fox Valley Road, intersecting with the eastern terminus of CR86-2 (Buttermilk Road) and the eastern terminus of CR55 (<b>Gooseneck</b> Road) in Ashford. After CR55, the routes bend northwest once again, crossing as a two-lane road through wide fields.|$|E
500|$|The 1849 {{church is}} a small, one-and-a-half-story, front-gable building. The main façade (northwestern elevation) has two main entrances, {{enclosed}} by white-painted wood, recessed panel doors, and capped by white-painted stone lintels with two stone corner blocks. The church's exterior is brickwork, laid in Flemish bond on the main façade and a five-course American bond on the northeastern, southeastern and southwestern elevations. Two blue-gray stained glass windows (installed in 1905) are symmetrically placed above the main entrances, each capped by stone lintels with two stone corner blocks. The main façade is crowned by a white painted entablature molding with two cornice returns, exemplifying Greek Revival architectural design. In {{the top of the}} gable, a square date stone engraved [...] "1849" [...] is embedded in the brickwork above a <b>gooseneck</b> light fixture. Although the church is now topped by a metal standing-seam roof, it was originally sheathed by wooden shakes.|$|E
2500|$|To {{facilitate}} {{making the}} mouthpiece accessible to players of different height or body shapes, most sousaphones contain a detachable tubing <b>gooseneck</b> which {{arises from the}} lead pipe on the upwind side of the valves. [...] One or two slightly-angled bit(s) (short tubing lengths) are inserted into the <b>gooseneck,</b> and then the mouthpiece is inserted into the terminal bit. [...] This arrangement may be adjusted in height and yaw angle to place the mouthpiece comfortably at the player's lips.|$|E

2500|$|Though the {{full-sized}} AMC Ambassador {{was also}} {{offered as a}} police car, the Matador {{would prove to be}} very popular. The largest user of Matador patrol cars was the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD), primarily from 1972 to 1974, with some staying in service until the mid-1980s. After extensive testing of the special police models offered by Chevy, Ford, and Chrysler, the LAPD chose the AMC Matador because they [...] "out handled and outperformed all the other cars." [...] The LAPD police Matadors included among other special equipment: T-2 can lights, a five-channel Motorola Motrac 70 radio, a Federal siren, and a [...] "Hot Sheet Desk" [...] with a Roster <b>gooseneck</b> lamp.|$|E

There Wolcott worked without a secretary, writing his opinions in longhand. Pearson attributed Wolcott's conduct to his determination to ask for nothing. It was during Wolcott's tenure that Delaware's Court of Chancery gained the high regard and respect of lawyers and corporate boards throughout the country. It was Wolcott's judicial wisdom and judgment that first attracted lawyers and litigants from around the nation to Delaware as a preferred forum for litigation." ...|$|E

2500|$|He also {{invented the}} {{inverted}} BMX racing bicycle stem (also {{known as a}} [...] "gooseneck"). Unlike the standard [...] "quill gooseneck" [...] stem, BMX bicycles {{in need of a}} stem with a much tighter clamping force on the bars to eliminate movement forward or back. That could be caused by the more violent physical abuse racers put upon it like pulling with maximum force during racing and jumping their bicycles, these stems were four-point block clamps secured with Allen bolts, unlike the single point quill <b>gooseneck</b> that had a single [...] "pinchbolt" [...] configuration to clamp the bars. Most other stems of this type, like the standard <b>gooseneck,</b> raised the bottom level of the handlebars up, the inverted stem dropped them down. Breithaupt was heading to an NBA National in Las Vegas, Nevada in 1979 to race cruiser class a new division in BMX that at the time was made up of BMX bicycles (during this time most were converted Beach Cruisers with 26" [...] diameter wheels, built for the larger rider as opposed the standard 20" [...] vehicle). As he was fitting his handle bars onto the stem of the bicycle he noticed that it was to high for his liking and presumably it couldn't be lowered far enough down to get the feel and leverage he desired. he then removed the clamp the part that actually held fast to the handlebars, from the stem, that was inserted into the head tube and into the fork's neck. He flipped it over and reattached it. He was able then to drop the bottom of the bars another few millimeters to his liking. He later won his Cruiser class at this national using that configuration. He would then persuade [...] "Tuff Neck", a leading manufacturer of BMX bicycle parts at the time, to mass-produce the new component.|$|E
2500|$|In civil use, {{the longest}} {{available}} runway was [...] long. The {{western part of}} the airfield was separated from the main landing ground by a ditch, which was bridged over a [...] length to allow access for aircraft. The Bessonneau hangar had been removed by the RAF. A windsock was located in the north eastern corner of the airfield. The airfield was identified by a circle of whitewashed stones [...] diameter with the word MARDEN spelled out in the centre. It was lit at night. Telegraph wires at a height of [...] were an obstacle at the west end of the airfield. A navigational beacon was installed at Marden. It was powered by clockwork and had to be wound daily. Lighting at Marden progressed from Chance lights to <b>Gooseneck</b> flares and Money flares over the years. In the latter years of operation, night landing was possible by giving four hours notice to Lympne Airport not later than 4pm.|$|E

40|$|Spraying {{of winter}} wheat was done October 30 {{by use of}} a PT 17 biplane. Dosages as low as 0. 15 pound of butyl ester type of 2, 4 -D in 2. 5 gallons of Diesel fuel diluent {{resulted}} in 100 per cent kill of pennycress (Thlaspi arvense) and treacle mustard (Erysimum repandum). None of {{the three types of}} 2, 4 -D resulted in satisfactory kill when water was used as the diluent. <b>Goosenecking</b> of the top internode and in some cases the rachis was the greatest effect caused by 2, 4 -D on the wheat. Approximately fifty per cent of the tillers on the treated plants showed <b>goosenecking.</b> Sterility as well as light shriveled berries resulted from the <b>goosenecking</b> of the rachis. There was no consistent correlation between the rates of 2, 4 -D used and the yields obtained. However, yields varied, a few being higher than those of the check plots, but most yields were somewhat reduced in these experiments. No reduction in germination resulted in these experiments. No reduction in germination resulted from 2, 4 -D. Spraying of soybeans was done August 7 using a hand sprayer. When observed 24 hours after spraying, all sprayed plants were showing characteristic wilting of the leaves as well as a lax condition of the stems which resulted in lodging. Within a few days recovery from wilting {{as well as from the}} lax condition was apparent. However, definite 2, 4 -D injury was evident. Leaf-burning and chlorosis occurred with the two higher dosages of the ester formulations. All type formulations expressed epinastic curvature of the stems. Dosage levels below ½ pound for the salts and ¼ pound for the esters continually recovered more from early 2, 4 -D effects, whereas dosages above ½ pound and ¼ pound for the salts and esters respectively continued to show more injury. No killing of the plants resulted from any type formulation at the 1 / 8 -pound level nor for dosages of ¼ pound and ½ pound of the amine and sodium salts. Advisor: F. D. Kei...|$|R
