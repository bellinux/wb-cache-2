50|$|Although these {{consequences}} of the exchange interaction are magnetic in nature, the cause is not; it is due primarily to electric repulsion and the Pauli exclusion principle.

50|$|Electrons {{and many}} {{elementary}} particles also have intrinsic magnetic moments, {{an explanation of}} which requires a quantum mechanical treatment and relates to the intrinsic angular momentum of the particles as discussed in the article <b>Electron</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>moment.</b> It is these intrinsic magnetic moments {{that give rise to}} the macroscopic effects of magnetism, and other phenomena, such as electron paramagnetic resonance.|$|E

50|$|Schwinger {{developed}} {{an affinity for}} Green's functions from his radar work, and he used these methods to formulate quantum field theory in terms of local Green's functions in a relativistically invariant way. This allowed him to calculate unambiguously the first corrections to the <b>electron</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>moment</b> in quantum electrodynamics. Earlier non-covariant work had arrived at infinite answers, but the extra symmetry in his methods allowed Schwinger to isolate the correct finite corrections.Schwinger developed renormalization, formulating quantum electrodynamics unambiguously to one-loop order.|$|E

5000|$|A Penning trap stores charged {{particles}} using a strong homogeneous axial magnetic field to confine particles radially and a quadrupole electric field to confine the particles axially. The Penning Trap {{was named after}} Frans Michel Penning by Hans Georg Dehmelt who built the first trap. Penning traps are well suited for measurements of the properties of ions and stable charged subatomic particles. Precision studies of the <b>electron</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>moment</b> by Dehmelt and others are an important topic in modern physics.|$|E
5000|$|Electron spin resonance, {{also known}} as {{electron}} paramagnetic resonance, {{is due to the}} coupling of <b>electron</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>moment</b> [...] to the external magnetic field [...] through the Hamiltonian [...] describing its Larmor precession.

For a free electron in vacuum [...] Larmor interaction quantizes electron spin energy levels in a dc magnetic field [...] as , and a resonant ac magnetic field [...] of a frequency [...] results in electron paramagnetic resonance.|$|E
50|$|A Penning trap is {{a device}} for {{the storage of}} charged {{particles}} using a homogeneous axial magnetic field and an inhomogeneous quadrupole electric field. This kind of trap is particularly well suited to precision measurements of properties of ions and stable subatomic particles. Geonium atoms have been created and studied this way, to measure the <b>electron</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>moment.</b> Recently these traps {{have been used in}} the physical realization of quantum computation and quantum information processing by trapping qubits. Penning traps are used in many laboratories worldwide. For example, at CERN to store antimatter like antiprotons.|$|E
2500|$|Diamagnetism {{appears in}} all materials, {{and is the}} {{tendency}} of a material to oppose an applied magnetic field, and therefore, to be repelled by a magnetic field. However, in a material with paramagnetic properties (that is, with a tendency to enhance an external magnetic field), the paramagnetic behavior dominates. Thus, despite its universal occurrence, diamagnetic behavior is observed only in a purely diamagnetic material. In a diamagnetic material, there are no unpaired electrons, so the intrinsic <b>electron</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>moments</b> cannot produce any bulk effect. In these cases, the magnetization arises from the electrons' orbital motions, which can be understood classically as follows: ...|$|R

5000|$|The {{electron}} is a {{charged particle}} of charge −1e, where e is {{the unit of}} elementary charge. Its angular momentum comes from two types of rotation: spin and orbital motion. From classical electrodynamics, a rotating electrically charged body creates a magnetic dipole with magnetic poles of equal magnitude but opposite [...] This analogy holds as an electron indeed behaves like a tiny bar magnet. One consequence is that an external magnetic field exerts a torque on the <b>electron</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>moment</b> depending on its orientation {{with respect to the}} field.|$|E
5000|$|QED is not {{the full}} theory, and the {{standard}} model does not have many possible Pauli terms. A {{good rule of thumb}} is that a Pauli term is like a mass term in order to generate it the Higgs must enter. But in the ADD model, the Higgs vacuum expectation value is comparable to the Planck scale, so the Higgs field can contribute to any power without any suppression. One coupling which generates a Pauli term {{is the same as the}} electron mass term, except with an extra [...] where Y is the U(1) gauge field. This is dimension-six, and it contains one power of the Higgs expectation value, and is suppressed by two powers of the Planck mass. This should start contributing to the <b>electron</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>moment</b> at the sixth decimal place. A similar term should contribute to the muon magnetic moment at the third or fourth decimal place.|$|E
5000|$|The {{gyromagnetic ratio}} γ is the {{constant}} of proportionality between the frequency ν of nuclear magnetic resonance (or electron paramagnetic resonance for electrons) and the applied magnetic field B: ν = γB. It is difficult to measure gyromagnetic ratios {{precisely because of the}} difficulties in precisely measuring B, but the value for protons in water at [...] is known to better than one part per million. The protons are said to be [...] "shielded" [...] from the applied magnetic field by the electrons in the water molecule, the same effect that gives rise to chemical shift in NMR spectroscopy, and this is indicated by a prime on the symbol for the gyromagnetic ratio, γ′p. The gyromagnetic ratio is related to the shielded proton magnetic moment μ′p, the spin number I (I = [...] for protons) and the reduced Planck constant.The ratio of the shielded proton magnetic moment μ′p to the <b>electron</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>moment</b> μe can be measured separately and to high precision, as the imprecisely known value of the applied magnetic field cancels itself out in taking the ratio. The value of μe in Bohr magnetons is also known: it is half the electron g-factor ge. HenceA further complication is that the measurement of γ′p involves the measurement of an electric current: this is invariably measured in conventional amperes rather than in SI amperes, so a conversion factor is required. The symbol Γ′p-90 is used for the measured gyromagnetic ratio using conventional electrical units. In addition, there are two methods of measuring the value, a [...] "low-field" [...] method and a [...] "high-field" [...] method, and the conversion factors are different in the two cases. Only the high-field value Γ′p-90(hi) is of interest in determining the Planck constant.Substitution gives the expression for the Planck constant in terms of Γ′p-90(hi): ...|$|E
40|$|This report {{reviews the}} general problem of cage {{reactions}} of radical pairs and diradicals. Based on Wigner's spin conservation rule and {{the expectation that}} only singlet radical pairs can undergo cage reactions, a natural consequence is the expectation {{that it should be}} possible to observe magnetic effects on the reactions of radical pairs. It is shown that two types of magnetic effects should be possible: (1) Effects due to the application of the magnetic field of a laboratory magnet during a reaction; (2) Effects due to the interactions of nuclear <b>magnetic</b> momemts and <b>electron</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>moments.</b> The experimental consequences of these magnetic effects are separation of isotopes based on differing nuclear <b>magnetic</b> <b>moments</b> and variation of the extent of cage reaction by variation of an applied field or by variation of nuclear <b>magnetic</b> <b>moments.</b> Striking experimental examples of these magnetic effects are provided by the photolysis of ketones in micellar solution and by the thermolysis of endoperoxides...|$|R
2500|$|The {{observed}} {{hyperfine structure}} of atomic spectra was {{inconsistent with the}} proton–electron hypothesis.

5|$|The orbital angular {{momentum}} of electrons is quantized.
