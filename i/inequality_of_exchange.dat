40|$|The {{phenomena}} {{of friendship and}} giftship in antiquity have {{been the focus of}} much anthropological interest, yet those terms are still used much too broadly, wherein any one can be friends and anything exchanged is a gift. This article argued that proper friendship requires equality of exchange and status. When <b>inequality</b> <b>of</b> <b>exchange</b> is present, we will almost always also have inequality of status. These two things together naturally and necessarily result in the absence of frank speech. At this point, proper friendship (defined by frank speech) and the exchange of gifts (defined by equality of value) are impossible, and we have fictivefriendship, a term I have introduced in this article. Fictive-friendship refers to the practice, often but not exclusively amongst elites, of using friendship language to mask relationships of dependence (patronage and clientage). I closed my argument by looking at two examples of fictive-friendship in the Gospel of John. How to cite this article: Crook, Z.

40|$|Comparative Law {{means not}} only {{travelling}} in space, but travelling in time as well. It’s {{the essence of}} legal evolution: Law undergoes changes in different countries at different times. The story of <b>inequality</b> <b>of</b> <b>exchange</b> serves as a good example. Inequality in exchange as a legal figure of the old Roman laesio enormis {{has long been a}} popular topic for comparative studies. However, the comparison was mostly limited to the French, German and English legal systems, even though they form model solutions for their legal families. In the historical perspective, it meant tracing the legal evolution of laesio enormis and the unfair advantage (unconscionable contract) until the implementation of the German BGB in 1900 only. But it is not how the whole story goes. This paper aims at showing how Comparative Law has served to shape the legal consequences of unfair advantage in the 20 th century. Its modern “legal geography” is a perspective of so called “derived legal systems”: the Swiss, the Polish, the Italian and the Dutch. Each of them marks a new stage in the legal evolution of the institution of unfair advantage. The path of development starts from the Swiss Code of Obligations of 1911 and proceeds gradually towards the soft law of the 21 st century. Its main feature is the striving for more flexibility meaning favour of private autonomy and certainty of contractual relations...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to uncover the {{philosophical}} foundations of the defendant's duty of restitution in the law of unjust enrichment. I argue that the current dominant account for the duty of restitution – that it is best explained by the model of corrective justice – is inadequate as it fails to accommodate two key features of an action in unjust enrichment, namely, the irrelevance of fault {{and the absence of}} causation. In place of corrective justice, I suggest three alternative models: distributive justice, equity, and commutative justice. The first two candidates ultimately prove unsatisfactory, but in their respective failures help identify certain fundamental elements of unjust enrichment. The third is the most promising, but care must be taken not to conflate it with corrective justice. I argue that corrective and commutative justice are not synonymous since, while corrective justice exemplifies an intrapersonal equality, the relevant form of equality for commutative justice is interpersonal. I define commutative justice as exemplifying the principle of equality in exchange, specifically, equality of the things exchanged. Unjust enrichment, I conclude, is a manifestation of <b>inequality</b> <b>of</b> <b>exchange,</b> of commutative in justice. Although commutative justice accurately describes situations of unjust enrichment, I admit that it cannot alone justify the existence or imposition of the duty of restitution on the defendant. Something more is required: a normative theory for preserving the status quo of initial entitlement distribution. As such, I canvas two alternative theories as exemplified by Hegelian and Aristotelian conceptions of property, respectively. These two theories map onto a corresponding distinction between private (pre-institutional) rights and public (post-institutional) values. I conclude that given the legal duty of restitution {{and the fact that it}} is difficult to conceptualize a private right that could justify this type of duty on the defendant, the Aristotelian understanding is preferable...|$|E

40|$|The medieval {{notion of}} the just price was an outcome of neither an {{exclusively}} economic analysis nor a completely ethical argument, but an amalgam of some features of each. At issue is the significance the medievals attached to the concepts of price and justice and how an integrated economics and ethics made for a mode of reasoning about price different from the endogenousty focused price theory and limited boundaries of modern economics. It is argued in 'The Justice of the Just Price' that the treatment of price in medieval economic thought cannot be grasped without a comprehensive approach to its determination. The argument will first focus separately on {{the description of the}} medieval notions of price (cost of production, need, etc.) and of justice (virtue/vice) as features of the medieval concept of the just price. It proposes that, by virtue {{of the fact that the}} premises of the medieval system of analysis assumed greed as a nefarious part of human economic behaviour and presupposed the necessity of justice prior to exchange, medieval intellectuals justified on ethical grounds the interference of the just price in market activity and attempted to rectify the <b>inequalities</b> <b>of</b> <b>exchange</b> and distribution through the institutional regulations of Church and court. just price, Price, price, price mechanism, economics, ethics, institutional regulation, justice,...|$|R

30|$|What we {{consider}} here however is <b>inequality</b> <b>of</b> opportunities, which {{is distinct from}} <b>inequality</b> <b>of</b> outcomes.

We develop a new definition of equality of opportunity and show {{how it can be}} implemented empirically. Equality of opportunity is defined as the situation where income distributions conditional on social origin cannot be ranked according to stochastic dominance criteria. Stochastic dominance is assessed using non-parametric statistical tests. We measure social origin by parental education and occupation and use national household surveys to assess <b>inequality</b> <b>of</b> income and opportunities. USA and Italy show up as the most unequal countries both in terms of outcome and opportunity. At the opposite extreme, income distributions conditional on social origin are very close in Scandinavian countries even before any redistributive policy. The analysis highlights that <b>inequality</b> <b>of</b> outcome and <b>inequality</b> <b>of</b> opportunity can sometimes lead to different pictures. For instance, France and Germany experience a similar level <b>of</b> <b>inequality</b> <b>of</b> income but the former country is much more unequal than the latter {{from the point of view}} of equality of opportunity.
