50|$|An {{application}} development language {{was needed to}} provide timing and process interrupt capability, analog and digital input and output commands to allow data acquisition from and control of external laboratory instruments along with basic computational functions, direct access data storage and host communications in a hierarchical environment. Not only did a programming language need to be defined but also an associated program preparation facility such as a compiler. It was decided {{that the use of}} a syntactical model which could be processed by the System/360 Macro Assembler would obviate the need for writing a compiler. Machine language instructions were created to interpret the object code, the output of the assembler. In effect, this was a high level instruction set, or programming language, for a hypothetical or virtual real-time sensor-based computer and LABS/7 provided a language interpreter implemented in System/7 machine language which mimicked, or, in today's language, emulated, the virtual machine. Another element of LABS/7 was a package of general purpose utility programs; today these would probably be called apps. Finally, a System/360 software package known as the <b>Host</b> <b>Communication</b> Facility (HCF) was developed to provide bi-directional data transfer between a host System/360 and multiple satellite System/7s. All together, LABS/7 provided an environment where 1) an application program could be written and compiled on a host System/360, downloaded from the host to a System/7 in a scientist's laboratory, 3) invoked to control a laboratory apparatus/instrument/machine, 4) acquire measurement results from the instrument, 5) send the data to the host computer, 6) start a program on the host to analyze the data and 7) return and display the results of the analysis for the scientist in the laboratory. Of course, the System/7 could be operated in a completely standalone, i.e. non-hierarchical, environment.|$|E

QoS guarantees on end-to-end communication are potentially useful for a large class of distributed multimedia and real-time applications. Building QoS-sensitive <b>host</b> <b>communication</b> subsystem software requires, in addition to significant architectural enhancements, an intimate knowledge of the overheads and {{costs associated with the}} host hardware and software platform.

40|$|Abstract — Over {{the last}} few years, a variety of access {{technologies}} have been deployed. In a multiple access technology environment, mobile hosts have multiple network interfaces. We have proposed a SHAring multiple paths procedure for a cluster networK Environment (SHAKE) to achieve high-speed data transmission in such heterogeneous network environments. In SHAKE, mobile hosts that are connected by a fast local link –we call this type of network a cluster network – use multiple long-range wireless links co-owned by all hosts simultaneously to communicate with hosts on the Internet. In this paper, we describe a SHAKE Cluster Control Manager (SCCM) that sets up the cluster network autonomously and provides suitable shared network resource information for SHAKE. In some basic experiments, we show the features of SCCM and demonstrated that each <b>host’s</b> <b>communication</b> performance is guaranteed even when a competitor appears within the cluster network.

30|$|<b>Host</b> <b>communication</b> {{competence}} can {{be thought}} of then as “the degree to which the newcomer can encode and decode verbal and nonverbal messages within the host environment” (Neuliep 2012, p. 408). Gaining communication competence about ways of communicating in a host culture includes “a refinement of insights and predictions about host behavior. The individual tends to enter the host culture with simple, gross stereotypes that are fine-tuned through face- to-face or mediated interaction” (Reece and Palmgreen 2000, p. 809). One way a sojourner may try to develop their communication competence in trying to understand the host culture is by making comparisons to that with which the sojourner knows and is familiar.|$|E
40|$|The {{advent of}} {{high-speed}} networks {{and demand for}} distributed multimedia applications now requires that the communication subsystems in end hosts (or simply hosts) be designed and implemented to facilitate and provide certain quality-of-service (QoS) guarantees. An application specifies its QoS requirements for each active connection in terms of several parameters such as end-to-end delay, delay jitter, and bandwidth; additional requirements regarding packet loss and in-order delivery can also be specified [1, 2]. Additionally, the application may need to specify its traffic characteristics on each connection {{in order for the}} <b>host</b> <b>communication</b> subsystem and network to provide the required guarantees.

Symbiotic microbes within the gastrointestinal tract provide an array of benefits to the host, including promotion of host immunity. A coordinated effort of the host and symbiotic microbes deters the colonization and survival of many invading pathogens. However, pathogens have devised strategies to overcome these mechanisms. Furthermore, some pathogens can hijack host hormones and bacterial autoinducers to induce virulence traits.

We motivate and describe the components constitut-ing our integrated service architecture that together ensure QoS-sensitive handling of network traffic at both sending and receiving hosts and demonstrate a communication framework that can im-plement alternative QoS models by applying appropriate policies. An experimental evaluation in a controlled configuration demon-strates the efficacy with which QoS guarantees are maintained, despite limitations imposed by the underlying operating system. ...|$|E

In particular, two visual representations of the flow data are compared: a TreeMap visualization of local net-work hosts, which are linked through hierarchical edge bun-dles with the external hosts, and a graph representation us-ing a force-directed layout to visualize {{the structure of the}} <b>host</b> <b>communication</b> patterns.
