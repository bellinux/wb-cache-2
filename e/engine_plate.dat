5000|$|Rupp's {{greatest}} {{change to}} their mini bike lineup in any year was arguably 1970. The frame was entirely redesigned and spoke-type wheels were introduced. The Roadster and Scrambler's 6" [...] wheels were augmented to 10" [...] spoke wheels {{and a new}} model, the Enduro was manufactured. These 10" [...] wheel bikes were outfitted with 4HP Tecumseh HS40 engines {{and for the first}} time Rupp used a slanted <b>engine</b> <b>plate</b> with diaphragm carburetor. Many features of the bikes were changed including the gas tank, seat (notably manner of attachment), handlebars, exhaust pipe, taillight, chain guard, decals, new motorcycle style center kickstand, among others.|$|E

5000|$|Roadster - Many {{changes were}} made to the Roadster in 1970. It now used the new Rupp frame with the slanted <b>engine</b> <b>plate</b> and {{diaphragm}} carburetor. The wheels were upgraded from the 6" [...] turbine style to a new 10" [...] chrome wire wheel. The engine size was decreased from the 5 HP Tecumseh H50 to a 4 HP Tecumseh HS40. The engine had a lighting coil and still ran lights front and rear. The Roadster had front and rear drum brakes. Rupp marketed the Roadster as street legal. (ref) The Roadster, Enduro and Scrambler were available in blue, orange or red. All had silver gas tanks and silver engines.|$|E
50|$|Some owners {{realised}} {{that the}} long stroke 2.5-litre engine fitted to the TR5/6 and 2.5PI had the same dimensions as the 2-litre engine, and could be fitted to the Vitesse simply by swapping the rear <b>engine</b> <b>plate,</b> input shaft bush, and clutch, then bolting on Vitesse engine mounts. In fact it was practical (and virtually undetectable!) to strip the Vitesse Mk2 engine and rebuild with 2.5 crankshaft, pistons, and cylinder head to achieve this capacity increase. Some repowered 2.5-litre cars were fitted with the original Stromberg CD150s, some with Webers or Dellortos, and some even kept the problematic but effective mechanical Lucas petrol injection system. Unfortunately the Vitesse gearbox and diff were not really up to a 150 hp 2.5 litre engine's output. Fitting the gearbox from the 2.5 was {{not as simple as}} the engine so this remained a problem for most with the 2.5.|$|E
40|$|Two cowling systems {{intended}} {{to reduce the}} drag and improve the low-speed cooling characteristics of conventional radial engine cowlings were tested in model form to determine the practicability of the methods. One cowling included a blower mounted on the rear face of a large propeller spinner which drew cooling air in through side entrance ducts located behind the equivalent engine orifice plate. The air was passed through the equivalent engine orifice plate from rear to front and out through a slot between the spinner and the <b>engine</b> <b>plate.</b> The blower produced substantially all the power necessary to circulate the cooling air in some cases, so the quantity of air flowing was independent of the air speed, Two types of blowers were used, a centrifugal type and one using airfoil blades which forced the air outward {{from the center of}} rotation. The other cowling was similar to the conventional N. A. C. A. cowling except for the addition of a large propeller spinner nose. The spinner was provided with a hole in the nose to admit cooling air and blower blades to increase the pressure for cooling at low speeds. The tests show that with both cowling types the basic drag of the nacelle was reduced substantially below that for the N. A. C. A. cowling by virtue of the better nose shape made possible by the spinner. The drag due to the side-entrance ducts was nearly zero when the openings were closed or when the blower was drawing in a certain quantity of air in proportion to the air speed. The drag increased, however, when air mas allowed to spill from the openings. The nose-entrance blower showed considerable promise as a cooling means although the blower tested was relatively inefficient, owing {{to the fact that the}} blower compartments evidently were expanded too rapidly under the conditions imposed. by the design...|$|E

50|$|A similar {{engine to}} the {{swashplate}} engine is the wobble <b>plate</b> <b>engine,</b> {{also known as}} nutator or Z-crank drive. This uses a bearing that purely nutates, rather than also rotating as for the swashplate. The wobble plate is separated from the output shaft by a rotary bearing.

5000|$|The number {{plates were}} cast in brass, in a {{horizontal}} rectangular format with radiused corners. The size was about 18in x 10in and a raised ½in edge surrounded the plate.

The plates of the first BNCR number series (Nos.69 and 70) which was current to 1897 contained polished, raised, boldly serified numbers alone. The BNCR 1897 renumbering introduced a series of plates which had [...] "BNCR" [...] in small block capitals above the digits. The BNCR style of plates was used throughout both MR and LMS days. The MR (NCC) renumbering of 12/102 and 113/101, and numbering of 103 and 104, gave these <b>engines</b> <b>plates</b> with digits alone, but otherwise they were similar to the earlier series, and this principle was maintained in the last renumbering to Nos.43 and 44.|$|R
