The bible curriculum bill, which came {{a few years after}} Democrats opposed Republican attempts to promote teaching a translation of the scriptures, was an attempt to preempt a Republican attempt to display the Ten Commandments in schools. Faith <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>area</b> <b>where</b> Georgia Democrats differ from the national party. The bill passed in the State Senate by a 50–1 margin on February 3, and it eventually became law.|$|E

25|$|These time {{intervals}} {{would seem}} to be reversed; this <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>area</b> <b>where</b> public policy trumps science. The idea is that for women beyond age 35, every month counts and if made to wait another 6 months to prove the necessity of medical intervention, the problem could become worse. The corollary to this is that, by definition, failure to conceive in women under 35 isn't regarded with the same urgency as it is in those over 35.|$|E

The most visible of these has been the Erasmus Programme, a university exchange programme which began in 1987. In its first 20years, it has supported international exchange opportunities for well over 1.5million university and college students and has become a symbol of European student life.|$|E

Bitter struggles took place between Germans and partisans in this area. The land became part of Pavese's personal mythology.|$|E

Nanban dishes are not American or European, but an odd variety not using soy sauce or miso but rather curry powder and vinegar as their flavoring, a characteristic derived from Indo-Portuguese Goan cuisine. Some of these dishes resemble Southeast Asian cuisines but are so heavily changed to fit Japanese tastes like ramen that they should be considered separate.|$|E
25|$|In {{the sport}} of cricket, the {{corridor}} of uncertainty <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>area</b> <b>where</b> a cricket ball can pitch during a delivery: a narrow line on and just outside a batsman's off stump. The name {{is derived from the}} opinion that this is the area in which a batsman struggles most to determine whether to play forward or back, or to leave the delivery. If a batsman leaves the ball, there's a chance the ball will turn inward and either bowl him or hit him with an increased chance of leg before wicket. If a batsman plays the ball, there's a chance the ball will go to the outside instead, leading to an outside edge that can be easily caught.|$|E
25|$|Despite a {{great deal}} of {{publicity}} and promises, the history of human gene therapy has been characterized by relatively limited success. The effect of introducing a gene into cells often promotes only partial and/or transient relief from the symptoms of the disease being treated. Some gene therapy trial patients have suffered adverse consequences of the treatment itself, including deaths. In some cases, the adverse effects result from disruption of essential genes within the patient's genome by insertional inactivation. In others, viral vectors used for gene therapy have been contaminated with infectious virus. Nevertheless, gene therapy is still held to be a promising future area of medicine, and <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>area</b> <b>where</b> there is a significant level of research and development activity.|$|E

In the centre <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>area</b> <b>where</b> the Emperor would rest, and on the east side of the hall, an area of two tatami was set aside for dignitaries and aristocrats to sit.

On the north side of the hall was an enclosed area where the Emperor would sleep at night; later, Emperors began to use the official residence. The west side was set aside for the Emperor's breakfasts, and also contained the lavatories, while the south side was used by the keeper of the Imperial Archives. This area contained paintings by the masters of the Tosa school, and just outside, various rare bamboos were planted.|$|E

500|$|Historically, {{a system}} has been {{classified}} as a depression if it <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>area</b> <b>where</b> the barometric pressure is low compared with its surroundings. Other classifications historically used include: cyclonic storm where the winds did not exceed force 10 on the Beaufort scale and a Cyclone where the winds are either force 11 and 12 on the Beaufort scale. Between 1924 and 1988, tropical cyclones were classified into four categories: depression, deep depression, cyclonic storms and severe cyclonic storms. However, a change was made during 1988 to introduce the category [...] "severe cyclonic storm with core of hurricane winds" [...] for tropical cyclones, with wind speeds of more than [...] During 1999 the categories Very Severe Cyclonic Storm and Super Cyclonic Storm were introduced, while the severe cyclonic storm with a core of hurricane winds category was eliminated. During 2015 another modification to the intensity scale took place, with the IMD calling a system with 3-minute maximum sustained wind speeds between 90–119kn (166–221km/h, 104–137mph): an extremely severe cyclonic storm. The United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center also monitors the basin, and issues warnings on significant tropical cyclones {{on behalf of the}} United States Government. These warnings use a 1-minute sustained wind speed and can be compared to the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale, however, regardless of intensity in this basin the JTWC labels all systems as tropical cyclones.|$|E
