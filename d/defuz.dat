The developed library includes the main blocks: MIN (minimum operation), MAX (maximum operation), MFG (membership function generator), FUZ (fuzzifier to convert a crisp input into a fuzzy labels), F-RULES (fuzzy rules matrix), F-INF (Min-Max fuzzy inference), <b>DEFUZ</b> (defuzzifier to obtain a crisp output) and other blocks to simulate easily the fuzzy systems. The developed fuzzy logic library provides additional features for: education of fuzzy logic concepts for undergraduate engineeing students, simulation of fuzzy logic controllers with ease and verifying the analog hardware implementation of fuzzy logic components. Simulation examples are included to show the potential of the developed simulink fuzzy logic library. F 1...|$|E
