5|$|In January 2014, Elite Systems, who {{produced}} a successful range of {{software for the}} original ZX Spectrum in the 1980s, announced plans for a Spectrum-themed bluetooth keyboard that would attach to mobile devices such as the iPad. The company provided a crowdfunding campaign in order to fund the project, which would be compatible with games already released on iTunes and Google Play. Elite Systems took down its Spectrum Collection application the following month, due to complaints from authors of the original 1980s game software {{that they had not}} been paid for the content. Later that year, a Â£100 Sinclair ZX Spectrum Vega retro video game console was announced by Retro Computers and crowdfunded on IndieGogo, with the apparent backing of Clive Sinclair as an investor, but without a <b>full</b> <b>keyboard</b> and manufactured in a limited capacity.|$|E

Time Outs Scott Meek noted that [...] "Argento's own over-the-top score [...] {{has been replaced by}} religioso thunderings from the keyboards of Keith Emerson".

2500|$|While Apple's MacBook {{lines have}} been {{affected}} towards consumer trend to smartphones, they still managed to ship 2.8M Macs in Q2 2012, notably Air, compared to 500K total Ultrabooks, despite there being dozens of Ultrabooks from various manufacturers on the market while Apple only offered 11" [...] and 13" [...] models of it. While several Ultrabooks were able to claim individual distinctions such as being the lightest or thinnest, the Air was regarded by reviewers as the best all-around Ultrabook in regard to [...] "OS X experience, <b>full</b> <b>keyboard,</b> superior trackpad, Thunderbolt connector and the higher-quality, all-aluminum unibody construction". The Air {{was among the first}} to receive Intel's latest CPUs before other PC manufacturers, and Apple OS X has gained market share on Windows in recent years. Through July 1, 2013, the MacBook Air took in 56% of all Ultrabook sales in the United States, despite being one of the higher-priced competitors.|$|E
2500|$|In October 1961, the world's first all-electronic desktop calculator, the British Bell Punch/Sumlock Comptometer ANITA (A New Inspiration To Arithmetic/Accounting) was announced. This machine used vacuum tubes, cold-cathode {{tubes and}} Dekatrons in its circuits, with 12 cold-cathode [...] "Nixie" [...] tubes for its display. Two models were displayed, the Mk VII for {{continental}} Europe and the Mk VIII for Britain {{and the rest}} of the world, both for delivery from early 1962. The Mk VII was a slightly earlier design with a more complicated mode of multiplication, and was soon dropped in favour of the simpler Mark VIII. The ANITA had a <b>full</b> <b>keyboard,</b> similar to mechanical comptometers of the time, a feature that was unique to it and the later Sharp CS-10A among electronic calculators. The ANITA weighed roughly [...] due to its large tube system. Bell Punch had been producing key-driven mechanical calculators of the comptometer type under the names [...] "Plus" [...] and [...] "Sumlock", and had realised in the mid-1950s that the future of calculators lay in electronics. They employed the young graduate Norbert Kitz, who had worked on the early British Pilot ACE computer project, to lead the development. The ANITA sold well since it was the only electronic desktop calculator available, and was silent and quick.|$|E

2500|$|Although the PC market declined, Apple {{still managed}} to ship 2.8 million MacBooks in Q2 2012 (the {{majority}} of which are the MacBook Air) compared to 500,000 total Ultrabooks, although {{there were dozens of}} Ultrabooks from various manufacturers on the market while Apple only offered 11-inch and 13-inch models of the MacBook Air. The Air has been the best-selling ultra-portable in certain countries over Windows Ultrabooks, particularly the United States. While several Ultrabooks were able to claim individual distinctions such as being the lightest or thinnest, the Air was regarded by reviewers as the best all-around subnotebook/ultraportable in regard to [...] "OS X experience, <b>full</b> <b>keyboard,</b> superior trackpad, Thunderbolt connector and the higher-quality, all-aluminum unibody construction". The Air {{was among the first to}} receive Intel's latest CPUs before other PC manufacturers, and OS X has gained market share on Windows in recent years. Through July 1, 2013, the MacBook Air took in 56 percent of all Ultrabook sales in the United States, although being one of the higher-priced competitors, though several Ultrabooks with better features were often more expensive than the MacBook Air. The competitive pricing of MacBooks was particularly effective when rivals charged more for seemingly equivalent Ultrabooks, as this contradicted the established [...] "elitist aura" [...] perception that Apple products cost more but were higher quality, which made these most expensive Ultrabooks seem exorbitant no matter how valid their higher prices were.|$|E
