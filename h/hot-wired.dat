500|$|USA Today Robert Bianco {{acknowledged}} that the episode managed to avoid repeating many of the second season's mistakes noting that the four main characters spend more time together and the annual mystery [...] "is <b>hot-wired</b> into the housewives themselves." [...] Bianco remarked that Cross successfully maintained her position as the series' most prominent lead and was pleased with Susan's storyline, calling it [...] "a conflict that gives Teri Hatcher a genuinely funny, rather than forced, sight gag." [...] He approved of the writers' decision to distance the characters from their second season storylines, but opined: [...] "The harder mistake to overcome is the damage the show did to its main characters — allowing them to behave in ways that made them seem weak, selfish, stupid and, at times, despicable." [...] Bianco concluded: [...] "It {{will take more than}} one good episode to win us back after all that. But it's certainly a good place to start." [...] Jen Creer of TV Squad was mixed in her review. She criticized the lack of originality in the storylines, writing that the episode was similar to Sex and the City. Nevertheless, Creer complimented the main actresses, concluding, [...] "I'll be tuning in next week [...] for all of its camp and unoriginality, the show does continue to have that certain something, those little twists of genius that make it worth watching." [...] Andy Dehnart of MSNBC was slightly more positive in his review, acknowledging that while [...] "most of the housewives are stuck in their second-season ruts," [...] the show's overall quality has improved, citing the Orson storyline as a welcomed change from the slow-moving Applewhite mystery arc. Overall, Dehnart approved of the episode and felt that the show [...] "may be on track to finally pleasuring its audience in new, albeit familiar ways." ...|$|E

Report discusses factors affecting readings of <b>hot-wire</b> anemometer in turbulent supersonic boundary layer. Presents theoretical analysis of responses of <b>hot-wire</b> probe {{to changes in}} flow; also compares measurements by <b>hot-wire</b> probe with measurements of same flows by laser-induced fluorescence (LIF).

40|$|The {{analytical}} {{solution for}} the frequency response of a constant temperature <b>hot-wire</b> system at given turbulent velocity fluctuations is used to investigate the effects on the cut-off frequency of the <b>hot-wire</b> system at different operating conditions. It is found that the optimal frequency response of the <b>hot-wire</b> system determined by the traditional square-wave test, under certain circumstances, cannot guarantee {{the stability of the}} <b>hot-wire</b> system from velocity perturbations. It is also found that the cut-off frequency depends not only on the <b>hot-wire</b> length to diameter ratio, the mean velocity, the <b>hot-wire</b> materials and the overheat ratio as previously found, but also on the gain bandwidth product of the amplifiers in the feedback circuit, the resistances used in the Wheatstone bridge and the gain of the amplifier in the feedback loop. <b>Hot-wire</b> systems with preferred operating conditions are recommended...|$|R
40|$|A <b>hot-wire</b> {{anemometer}} {{and a new}} nonintrusive laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) technique {{are used}} to survey a Mach 2 turbulent boundary layer. The <b>hot-wire</b> anemometer's ability to accurately measure mass flux, temperature, and density fluctuations in a compressible flow is examined by comparing its results with those obtained using LIF. Several methods of <b>hot-wire</b> calibration are used, and the uncertainties in their measurements of various fluctuating flow parameters are determined. The results show that although a <b>hot-wire</b> operated at high overheat can measure mass flux fluctuations, temperature and density fluctuations are not determined accurately from such measurements. However, a <b>hot-wire</b> operated at multiple overheats {{can be used to}} measure static and total temperature fluctuations. The presence of pressure fluctuations and their correlation with density can prevent the use of <b>hot-wire</b> data to determine density fluctuations...|$|R

40|$|Pulsed <b>Hot-Wire</b> Anemometry (PHWA) {{measurements}} are performed in well defined two- and three-dimensional turbulent wall jets. For the two-dimensional wall jet {{the objective is}} to study reported differences between conventional <b>Hot-Wire</b> Anemometry (HWA) and Laser Doppler Anemometry (LDA) results. In the three-dimensional wall jet, new improved data are provided, employing a measuring technique suitable for highly turbulent flows. This, since only <b>hot-wire</b> results previously have been published for this flow. The pulsed wire results show good agreement with existing Laser Doppler anemometer data in the two-dimensional wall jet, both reporting significantly higher turbulence levels in the outer region of the flow than <b>hot-wires</b> do. The <b>hot-wire</b> anemometer errors generally increase with increasing local turbulence intensity and since the three-dimensional wall jet has a higher turbulence level than its two-dimensional equivalent, the new pulsed <b>hot-wire</b> results improve the information available for the turbulence field in this flow significantly...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose is}} to re-examine the heat {{transfer}} from a <b>hot-wire</b> probe in the compressible subsonic flow regime; describe the three-wire <b>hot-wire</b> probe calibration and data reduction techniques {{used to measure the}} velocity, density, and total temperature fluctuation; and present flow quality results obtained in the Langley 0. 3 meter Transonic Cryogenic Wind Tunnel and in flight with the NASA JetStar from the same three-wire <b>hot-wire</b> probe...|$|R
40|$|The sensors, {{which use}} the {{convective}} heat transfer at hot wires {{in order to}} measure the flow rate of gases, are well known. <b>Hot-Wire</b> Anemometry (HWA), which is operated in either constant-current mode or in constant temperature mode, represents the most popular methods to measure the velocity and the flow rate of the fluid flow. Generally, the <b>hot-wire</b> sensors are calibrated against the flow velocity under atmospheric pressure conditions. To calibrate <b>hot-wire</b> sensors under different air densities; a special calibration test rig is needed. In the present paper, calibrations are shown to yield the same <b>hot-wire</b> response curves for density locations in the range of 1 to 7 kg/m 3 and its usable mass flow rate range (rU) is 0. 1 to 25 kg/m²s. Also, a neural network has been trained with the output data for the <b>hot-wire</b> sensor and tested on our measurements. It was observed that the quality of the results depends on the number of hidden neurons. The predicted values are close to the real ones which indicate the neural net model gives a good approximation for the calibration curves of the <b>hot-wire</b> anemometer under different flow densities. The <b>hot-wire</b> sensor that {{used in the present study}} has 5 mm diameter and 1. 25 mm length so its aspect ratio is 250...|$|R
40|$|Differential {{equations}} {{of constant}} temperature <b>hot-wire</b> systems are solved numerically under various perturbation methods. The {{results show that}} cut-off frequencies determined from traditional square wave tests are inconsistent with those from velocity impulses at hot wires, with the latter being the proper method for dynamic systems such as <b>hot-wire</b> anemometers. It is also found that normalized energy spectral densities of responses of <b>hot-wire</b> systems to various perturbations {{can be used to}} determine the frequency responses and cut-off frequencies of the systems. Based on this finding, a new procedure is proposed to experimentally determine the frequency response and approximately estimate the cut-off frequency of the <b>hot-wire</b> systems. The frequency responses of <b>hot-wire</b> systems determined from square wave perturbations show the <b>hot-wire</b> attenuation below the cut-off frequency. This offers opportunities of possible experimental determination of this attenuation, which so far has been out of reach and denied the possibility of correcting its effects in turbulence measurements. The effects of this attenuation on the experimental results of small-scale turbulence could be large...|$|R

40|$|Accurate {{calibration}} {{is imperative}} to obtain reliable flow measurements using <b>hot-wire</b> anemometry. Calibration errors owing to temperature drift, wire degradation, changes in ambient conditions etc can lead to substantial uncertainties in <b>hot-wire</b> measurements. A new calibration procedure is implemented here to account for most forms of drift that are typically encountered during high quality flow measurements using <b>hot-wires.</b> The method involves obtaining single point recalibrations of the <b>hot-wire</b> (in the free-stream) at regular intervals {{during the course of}} an actual experiment, and using these during post-processing to correct for any drift encountered. Unlike many other existing schemes, this proposed calibration correction method is not solely restricted to correcting temperature drift...|$|R

40|$|In single-wire <b>hot-wire</b> measurements, {{velocity}} fluctuations acting {{normal to}} the <b>hot-wire</b> and its prongs will cause additional heat transfer known as binormal cooling. With respect to wall turbulence, {{the influence of}} this additional cooling is well-studied for crossed wires, while it is commonly ignored in single <b>hot-wire</b> measurements. The latter view is challenged in the recent work by Dróżdż and Elsner (2014) that claims significant errors in variance measurements when using single-wire probes in turbulent boundary layers.
