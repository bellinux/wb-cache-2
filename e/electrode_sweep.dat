For irreversible kinetics, a Green’s function technique is used to obtain an analytical solution to the diffusion equation.

During the improved mode, the position of the maximum electric field stayed on the n/m = 5 / 3 rational surface. After the H-L transition the local maxima shifted outward to the plasma periphery of ρ ~ 0. 8. The low order magnetic islands were formed resonating the magnetic Fourier components of (n, m) = (5, 3) by external perturbation coils. As widths of magnetic island were increased, the biasing electrode current required for the improved mode transition increased. It suggested that the ion viscosity increased according to the increase of the magnetic island width. The increase in the biasing electrode current is equivalent to the increase in the driving force for the poloidal rotation. This suggests the possibility of an active plasma rotation assisted by the externally controlled magnetic islands rotation. 1...|$|R

However, a very promising technique, {{which has not been}} explored much in the characterization of EDLCs, is the use of density function theory (DFT) to determine the mesopore size dis-tribution and the corresponding cumulative surface area of carbon materials. 10 Therefore, the objectives here are to demonstrate the use of DFT in determining the PSD and cumulative surface area of carbon mate-rials that are being evaluated as EDLCs, and to show how this infor-mation can be used to identify the pore sizes that are contributing to the DLC. The carbon material chosen for this purpose is a car-bonized resorcinol-formaldehyde (R-F) resin derived from a sol-gel process. This material has been receiving considerable attention in the recent literature, 1, 6, 11 - 17 In this study, the DLCs of a series of car-bon xerogels fabricated from R-F resins, carbonized at different tem-peratures and CO 2 -activated to different extents, are correlated with their corresponding PSDs and cumulative surface areas determined ically separated from the disk using a porous glass fiber filter.

This thesis concerns {{different aspects of the}} antioxidant properties of bovine milk, with emphasis on measurement of the total antioxidant capacity (TAC), the activity of the selenium-containing glutathione peroxidase (GSHPx), and the bioavailability of selenium from bovine milk in humans. The TAC measurements were based on the scavenging of the cation radical of 2, 2 ?-azinobis(3 -ethylenebenzothiazoline- 6 -sulphonic acid) (the ABTS method), the reduction of the complex of ferric ion and 2, 4, 6 -tripyridyl-s-triazine (the FRAP method), or the amperometric signal registered at a glassy carbon electrode at an oxidation potential of + 700 mV (versus AgôAgCl) in a flow-injection assay (the FIAmp method). Milk, whey, high-molecular-weight (HMW, > 10 kDa) fraction and low-molecular-weight (LMW, 0. 8, P< 0. 001). The major antioxidant in the LMW fraction was identified as urate by specific enzyme treatment. Other electrochemical techniques such as cyclic voltammetry (CV) and rotating disk <b>electrode</b> (RDE) linear <b>sweep</b> voltammetry were also employed to characterise the antioxidant capacity in milk. Extracellular glutathione peroxidase (eGSHPx) is one of the antioxidant enzymes in bovine milk, and a coupled enzymatic assay has been optimised for measuring its activity. The activity of GSHPx was monitored during heat treatment of milk and whey. The activity of GHSPx in milk and whey was maintained at 72 °C for 2 min, implying that the enzyme was stable at this common pasteurisation temperature used in dairy industry. The activity of purified cellular glutathione peroxidase (cGSHPx) was less stable than that of purified eGSHPx, and both purified enzymes were less stable than the GSHPx activity in milk. Selenium {{is an integral part of}} GSHPx, as well as of other selenoproteins with redox enzymatic activities and it is probably also related to the antioxidant status in humans. Therefore, the bioavailability of selenium from bovine milk was studied in humans using the ileostomy model. It was found that the fractional absorption of selenium was significantly higher for milk than for fermented milk, 73. 3 (16. 1) versus 64. 1 (11. 2) %, mean (SD), and selenium from bovine milk was thus highly bioavailable to humans...|$|R

The motivation {{of this work}} was {{to better understand the}} characteristics and electrochemical properties of metal nanostructures with different sizes and shapes. We synthesized Au nanoparticles with average diameters ranging from 5 to 45 nm by a chemical seed-mediated growth method and electrostatically attached them to amino-functionalized glass/ITO <b>electrodes.</b> Linear <b>sweep</b> voltammograms (LSVs) obtained on electrodes coated with Au NPs in 0. 01 M potassium bromide plus 0. 1 M HCI 04 showed a positive shift in oxidation potential from 680 ± 1 mV to 773 ± 6 m V with increasing Au NP diameter, consistent with increasing NP stability with increasing size. In copper underpotential deposition (UPD) studies, Au NPs were chemically-synthesized in solution by seed-mediated growth, and Au NPs were electrochemically deposited directly on the glass/ITO electrode from HAuCl 4 in H 2 S 04 by chronocoulometry. Potentials used were - 0. 2 V, 0. 4 V, and 0. 8 V versus Ag/AgCI and charges employed well 6 x 10 - 4 Coulombs (C), 1 x 10 - 3 C, and 6. 6 x 10 - 3 C. Cyclic voltammograms (CV s) obtained on the electrodes in 0. 01 M Cu(CIO 4) 2 plus 0. 1 M HCIO 4 in the region from 0. 1 to 1. 6 V vs. Hg/HgO showed that the UPD-peak is highly sensitive {{to the size of the}} Au NPs. The amount of Cu deposited onto the Au surface was inversely proportional to the size of the NP. This shows that a more dense Cu UPD layer forms on smaller NPs, likely due to a greater number of defects with decreasing NP size. CVs obtained in the region from 0. 8 to - 0. 7 V revealed a decrease in the reduction potential of Cu 2 + from - 508 m V to - 553 m V with increasing NP size. This directly shows that smaller NPs are better catalysts for metal deposition. We also electrochemically deposited Au NPs directly on the surface of the glass/ITO electrode from HAuCl 4 in H 2 S 04 at a potential of 0. 8 V versus Ag/AgCl using chronocoulometry for - 3 x 10 - 3 C, 6 x 10 - 3 C, 9 x 10 - 3 C, and 1. 2 x 10 - 2 C. We compared the yield of nanoplates formed under the different conditions and studied the mechanism of their growth. In addition, we obtained UV-vis spectra of the Au NPs and Au nanoplates. The growth mechanism involves: formation of uniformly distributed flower-like nanostructures, smashing into an irregular-shaped nanoplate and their growing, then etching and aggregation of the nanoplates with the nanoparticles. The maximum yield was observed 40 - 50 %. In this thesis, we describe the experimental setup used in this research and the results. The results of this research are very important for understanding the fundamental electrochemical properties of NPs, which could lead to applications in several different fields. It is very important to study the dependence of the properties of NPs on their size, shape, and composition as they possess a very different reactivity.

40|$|Diamond film on {{titanium}} substrate {{has become}} extremely attractive {{because of the}} combined properties of these two unique materials. Diamond film can effectively improve the properties of Ti for applications as aerospace and biomedical materials, as well as electrodes. Effects of process parameters, including gas composition, substrate temperature, gas flow rate and reactor pressure on diamond growth on Ti substrates has been studied using the hot filament chemical vapor deposition (HFCVD) method. The nucleation density, nuclei size, the diamond purity and growth tendency indices were used to quantify these effects. The crystal morphology of the material was examined with scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Micro-Raman spectroscopy provided information {{on the quality of}} the diamond films. The growth tendency of TiC and diamond film was determined by X-ray diffraction analysis. The optimal HFCVD conditions were found to be: CH 4 :H 2 = 1 %, gas flow rate= 300 sccm, substrate temperature Tsub= 750 oC, reaction pressure= 40 mbar. Under these conditions, high-quality diamond film was deposited on Ti with a growth rate of 0. 4 μm/hr and sp 2 carbon impurity content of 1. 6 %. The challenge for Ti/BDD is the stability especially when it is used as an electrode. In order to meet this challenge, two staged substrate temperature (2 -T) HFCVD method was newly developed. The accelerated working life time was significantly increased to 804 hours for the 2 -T electrode, compared with 244 hours for the electrode obtained under one substrate temperature (1 -T). With the characterization of micro-Raman, XRD, and cross-sectional SEM, a multilayer of Ti/TiC/(Diamond+Amorphous Carbon) /Diamond can be found in the 2 -T sample and the structure of Ti/TiC/Diamond in the 1 -T sample. There was less void space observed in the interlayer of the 2 -T sample. The multi-layered compact structure plays an important role in improving the adhesion of diamond film to the titanium substrate which in turn increases the electrode working life time by over 2 times. Needle shape diamond film electrode was fabricated with tantalum wire as substrate. Electrochemical quantitative analysis of nonylphenol (nine) ethoxylates (NP 9 EO) in water was realized using this <b>electrode</b> with linear <b>sweep</b> voltammetry method. High linear relationship (R 2 ≥ 0. 99) between the peak current with NP 9 EO concentration in the range from 162 nM to 40. 6 μM (or 100 μg/L to 25 mg/L) was obtained. Electrochemcial pretreatment influences the redox Fe(CN) 63 -/ 4 - behavior. After cathodic amperimetric polarization, the redox shows quasireversible behavior, instead of irreversible behavior on the electrode without polarization treatment.

40|$|Sensors {{incorporating}} zirconia electrolytes {{have been}} widely used for monitoring oxygen concentration and the air-to-fuel ratio of combustion systems. The aim of this work was to investigate the extension of this technology to other gases and to gas mixtures. Initial work was done on single zirconia. discs with porous metal electrodes on each face. Platinum, silver and gold electrodes were tested in controlled Atmospheres at temperatures between 300 *C and 850 *C. It was shown, as expected, that in 02 /N 2 mixtures electrode activity/conductance decreased as oxygen concentration and temperature were reduced. In CO/CO 2 /N, 2 atmospheres reproducibility was poor. Interestingly, an increase in electrode conductance of 1 - 2 orders of magnitude was observed as the temperature was reduced through around 700 *C which {{does not appear to have}} previously been reported. Is is thought to be related to the corrresponding change in the thermodynamic stability of CO at this temperature, ie 2 CO; ==t C 1 + C 02. Zirconia pump-gauges with small enclosed volume (< Imm 3) and laser drilled diffusion holes were constructed with the novel addition of reference electrodes. These were operated with current-interruption circuitry and rapid subsequent data aquisition. This enabled, for the first time, the overvoltage due to charge transfer on the internal pumping electrode to be isolated: interesting behaviour was revealed. The overvoltage increased as oxygen-containing gases were, reduced and then. in the case of NO, decreased as the reduction reached completion. The gauge EMF remained remarkably stable while NO was being reduced. Reduction of S 02 was shown to generate electronic conductivity in the yttria-stabilised zirconia. A potentially important result was obtained when operating a sensor in CO/CO 2 / 02 /N 2 mixtures where there was sufficient 02 present to oxidise all the CO present to C 02. With the application of zero pumping current the gauge EMF showed a substantial, non-zero, value. It was suspected that a mixed potential developed on the external electrode while the diffusion hole prevented its formation on the internal electrode. Based upon'the results obtained, two sensor designs are proposed. The first is a lean-bum combustion sensor eliminating the possibility of an ambiguous response in rich- and lean-bum conditions. By reducing the activity of the external pumping electrode while maintaining a highly active internal pumping electrode the response in rich-bum conditions would be insignificant while the response in leanbum conditions would be maintained. The second design concerns multi-gas sensing; it is based upon previous designs but the need for minimising electrochemical leakage was pinpointed by this work. Because overvoltages on the internal electrodes were shown to reach high values electrode activitity should be high and a gauge cell should be incorporated to provide information about the oxygen partial pressure within the sensor. If operated by sweeping the voltage applied it was shown that because of the slow <b>electrode</b> response the <b>sweep</b> rate would need to be less than 0. 2 mV/s. Consequently, it is proposed that an array of sensors operating at a range of fixed pump voltages would greatly reduce the response time. A computer-controlled apparatus was built with which to perform the experimental work. The apparatus controlled the furnace temperature, gas mixing apparatus and a potentiolstat/gaivanostat. The latter was purpose built so that all current and voltage ranges could be selected by the computer and current interruption performed automatically. Using software written in Turbo Pascal the apparatus was capable of performing a wide range of tests, unattended over periods of months...|$|R
40|$|The {{subject of}} this work {{is the study of}} the {{electrochemical}} promotion of catalysis (EPOC), also called non-Faradaic electrochemical modification of catalytic activity (NEMCA). In this phenomenon, application of small currents or potentials on catalysts in contact with solid electrolytes leads to very pronounced strongly non-Faradaic and reversible changes in catalytic activity and selectivity. This work concerns the system composed of platinum film electrodes, deposited on the YSZ electrolyte (ZrO 2 doped with 8 % Y 2 O 3), in contact with an oxygen containing atmosphere (the O 2 (g),Pt/YSZ system). The aim of this work was to focus on two points in the phenomenon of EPOC: 1) The nature of the species present {{on the surface of the}} catalyst and their impact on the catalytic activity. 2) The phenomenon of permanent promotion of catalysis (P-EPOC), for which the catalytic rate enhancement is not totally reversible, leading to a long lasting activated state. The Pt electrodes were prepared via three different methods (sputtering, thermal decomposition and screen-printing) and, as expected, the resulting microstructure, observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), was found to depend greatly on the preparation technique. The electrochemical response of each electrode was characterized by the technique of cyclic voltammetry. Due to the occurrence of different site-related electrochemical reactions, the voltammogram shape was highly influenced by the microstructure of the Pt/YSZ contact. Based on the preliminary studies, the cermet electrode was chosen for additional electrochemical experiments, using chronoamperometry, chronopotentiometry, cyclic voltammetry, steady state polarization and impedance spectroscopy. The results of all these techniques suggest that under anodic polarization, two parallel reactions take place. The first reaction is the oxygen evolution, giving rise to a steady state current under a constant applied potential. The other reaction is the oxygen storage (oxygen injection) in the form of Pt-O species. This second process gives rise to a time dependant current under a constant applied potential, and is therefore responsible for the pseudocapacitive behavior of the <b>electrode.</b> Moreover, linear <b>sweep</b> voltammetry measurements indicated that, by application of an anodic potential, at least three types of Pt-O species were stored, following distinct kinetics. Based on the amount of stored Pt-O and on the corresponding storage kinetics, they were attributed to three different locations on the electrode: 1) at the Pt/YSZ interface, 2) diffusing from the tpb toward the Pt/gas interface, 3) diffusing from the Pt/YSZ interface toward the bulk of the platinum electrode. It has been shown that the Pt film exhibited various activity states toward the catalytic oxidation of ethylene, depending on the oxygen species present at its surface. As evidenced by XPS measurements and in agreement with the thermodynamic data for the given system, the inactive (deactivated) state has been attributed to the formation of surface platinum oxide at T > 550 °C. Decreasing the reaction temperature to 525 °C caused the slow spontaneous reactivation of the catalyst and several days were necessary to reach the active state, where most of the catalyst was present in its metallic state. The catalyst activity recovery could be accelerated by the application of anodic potential pulses. In agreement with the mechanism of EPOC, this was explained by the oxide destabilizing effect of the anodically produced Oδ- species. Anodic polarization also caused reversible electrochemical promotion of catalysis at unusual high temperature (600 °C). In addition, very intriguing catalytic relaxation transients were observed after prolonged anodic polarization times. Indeed, it was found that enhanced catalytic activity could be maintained for up to 10 hours after current interruption. Combination of these latter results, the related literature, the state of the art model of EPOC, and the results obtained by electrochemical techniques led to the proposition of an original model based on the processes of Pt-O storage/release at various locations of the O 2 (g),Pt/YSZ system. According to this model, anodic polarization produces Oδ- back-spillover species, promoting the catalytic activity, in agreement with the mechanism of EPOC. In parallel, hidden oxygen species are stored at the Pt/YSZ interface and diffuse toward the Pt phase. When the polarization is switched off, these hidden oxygen species diffuse to the gas-exposed surface and cause non-Faradaic promotion, as back-spillover Oδ- do. The large amount of stored charge and its slow diffusion controlled emergence causes the rate enhancement to last for hours...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: There {{is little}} {{agreement}} on {{the age at which}} visual acuity (VA) and contrast sensitivity (CS) become adult-like. The ultimate purpose of this thesis was to determine whether VA and CS are adult-like at the age of 6 - 8 or 9 - 12 years by using both objective and subjective methods in the same individuals. The objective method (sweep visually evoked potentials [sVEP]) has many parameters that may affect the measurement of VA or CS and previously these had not been studied systematically, especially in children. Therefore, a second purpose was to study the effects of these parameters on VA and contrast thresholds and to determine the parameters that give the most repeatable measurements and the greatest number of viable readings in children, to be compared to previous data obtained in adults. Methods: The effect of five criteria (C 0 -C 4) for choosing the endpoint for the regression line fitting and three luminance levels (25, 50, and 100 cd/m 2) on the sVEP VA and contrast thresholds (at 1 and 8 cpd) was investigated in six 6 - 8 year old children. Additionally, the effect of these parameters on the number of viable readings obtained from five active electrodes was investigated. C 0 was derived from the sVEP software (PowerDiva), C 1 used the best fit by eye to determine the range over which the regression line was fitted, C 2 used the data point between signal peak and the last data point with an SNR ≥ 1, C 3 was similar to C 2 but was defined so that the threshold should be within the sweep range, and C 4 was similar to C 2 except that the SNR should not fall below one at any point within the range used for the regression line fitting. The effects of two electrode placements, three temporal frequencies (6, 7. 5, and 10 Hz), sweep direction (low to high and high to low), presence or absence of a fixation target, three stimulus areas (6, 4, and 2 ° for VA and 15, 10, and 6 ° for contrast thresholds) and three sweep durations (10, 15, and 20 sec) on VA and contrast thresholds (at 1, 4, or 8 cpd) measured with sVEP were also investigated in six 6 - 8 year-old children and six adults with normal vision. Additionally, the effect of these parameters on the number of viable readings obtained from five active electrodes was investigated. The sVEP parameters that were found to give the best threshold measurements were employed in a cross sectional study of the development of VA and CS. In this study the objective sVEP technique and two psychophysical techniques were used. The psychophysical techniques were comprised of a two-alternative forced choice (2 AFC) staircase for measuring VA and contrast thresholds and signal detection theory (SDT) for measuring contrast threshold. Crowded and uncrowded logMAR VA were also measured with a Bailey-Lovie logMAR chart. The study included three age groups (6 - 8, 9 - 12 year olds and adults). The criterion employed by each age group as indicated by the SDT was compared. Results: There was a significant effect of the criterion for choosing the endpoint for the regression line fitting (p < 0. 05) on all the measures and a significant effect of luminance (p = 0. 036) on contrast threshold at 1 cpd. Criterion C 2 (in which the range for the regression line fit was defined to include all the data between the signal peak and the last data point [furthest from the peak] with an SNR ≥ 1) consistently gave more viable readings and better thresholds (i. e. higher VA and lower contrast thresholds) than the other criteria. Also C 2 was the best criterion in terms of repeatability in children, and repeatability and validity in adults (Yadav et al., 2009). The luminance of 25 cd/m 2 gave higher contrast thresholds than 50 or 100 cd/m 2. There was a significant effect of temporal frequency on the number of viable readings for VA (p < 0. 0001) and for contrast thresholds (p = 0. 0001), with more viable readings at 7. 5 Hz than at either 6 or 10 Hz. The adults gave more readings with the fixation target than without it (p = 0. 04) for contrast threshold at 1 cpd. The smallest stimulus area used gave rise to fewer viable readings in both adults and children (p = 0. 022 for VA and 0. 0001 for contrast threshold). The other parameters (<b>electrode</b> placement, <b>sweep</b> direction and sweep duration) did not result in significant differences. There was a significant effect of age on crowded (p = 0. 0001) and uncrowded (p < 0. 0001) VA. The 6 - 8 year olds gave poorer VA than the 9 - 12 year olds or adults for both crowded and uncrowded VA. For the grating VA (sVEP and 2 AFC staircase) there was a significant effect of age (p = 0. 002). The 6 - 8 year olds had poorer VA than the 9 - 12 year olds or adults. For contrast threshold at 1 cpd, a significant effect of age was found for the 2 AFC (p = 0. 008) and SDT (p = 0. 0003). The 6 - 8 year olds gave poorer contrast thresholds than adults with each procedure. For contrast thresholds at 8 cpd, there was a significant effect of age with the 2 AFC staircase (p = 0. 036). The 6 - 8 year olds gave poorer contrast thresholds than the 9 - 12 year olds. For SDT, there was a significant effect of age on criterion (p < 0. 05), with adults being more likely to say “no” in the yes-no SDT procedure than both the 6 - 8 year olds and the 9 - 12 year olds for contrast threshold at 1 cpd. Adults {{were also more likely to}} say “no” than the 9 - 12 year olds for contrast thresholds at 8 cpd. Conclusions: This thesis has shown that VA and CS are not adult-like until the age of 9 - 12 years by these measures and that children do show differences in criterion compared to adults in psychophysical testing. This difference in criterion indicates the use of SDT or force-choice procedures to avoid this problem in any psychophysical developmental study. It has also shown that criterion for choosing the endpoint for the regression line fitting in the sVEP technique has the greatest effect on VA and contrast thresholds measurements and viable readings, while the other sVEP parameters have little effect on the thresholds...|$|R
40|$|Producer gas {{derived from}} biomass {{is one of}} the most {{environment}} friendly substitutes to the fossil fuels. Usage of producer gas for power generation has effect of zero net addition of CO 2 in atmosphere. The engines working on producer gas have potential to decrease the dependence on conventional fuels for power generation. However, the combustion process is governed by complex interactions between chemistry and fluid dynamics, some of which are not completely understood. Improved knowledge of combustion is, therefore, of vital importance for both direct use in the design of engines, and for the evolution of reliable simulation tools for engine development. The present work is related to the turbulent combustion of producer gas in closed vessels and engine cylinders. The main objective of the work was multi-dimensional simulation of turbulent combustion in the bowl-in-piston engine operating on producer gas fuel and to observe the flame and flow field interaction. First, the combustion model was validated in constant volume combustion chamber with experimental results. Experimental turbulent combustion data of producer gas (composition matching with engine operating conditions) was presented. The required data of laminar burning velocity of producer gas was computed and used in the simulation of turbulent combustion in closed vessel. The effect of squish and reverse squish flow on flame propagation in the bowl-in-piston engine cylinder was described. Laminar burning velocity of unstretched flame was computed using flame code which was developed earlier in this laboratory. One dimensional computations of unstretched planar flame were made to calculate laminar burning velocity of the producer gas-air mixture at pressures (1 - 10 bar) and temperatures (300 - 600 K). A correlation of laminar burning velocity of producer gas as a function of pressure and temperature was fitted and compared with experiments. A fixed composition and equivalence ratio of producer gas-air mixture, typical of the engine operating conditions, was considered. The correlation was used in simulation of turbulent combustion in closed vessel. The turbulent combustion experiments with producer gas-air mixture were conducted in a closed vessel. The aim of experiments was to generate pressure-time data, in closed vessel during turbulent flame propagation, which was required to validate turbulent combustion models. Determination of (ST /SL) was made from pressure-time data which requires corresponding laminar combustion data with same initial conditions. For this purpose a set of laminar combustion experiments was conducted. Experimental setup consists of a constant volume combustion chamber of cubical shape and size 80 x 80 x 80 mm 3. The initial mixtures pressure and temperature were 1 bar and 300 K respectively. A fixed composition and equivalence ratio of producer gas-air mixture, typical of the engine operating conditions, was used. The composition of producer gas was H 2 - 19. 61 %, CO 2 - 19. 68 %, CH 4 - 2. 52 %, CO 2 - 12. 55 % and N 2 - 45. 64 % on volume basis. Fuel-air mixture was ignited with electric spark at the center of the cube. Initial turbulence in the chamber was created by moving a perforated plate with specified velocity. Perforated plate was placed in chamber so that the central hole in the plate passes over the spark <b>electrodes</b> as it <b>sweeps</b> across the chamber. Two geometrically similar plates with hole diameter of 5 and 10 mm were used. The new experimental setup constructed as a part of this work was first tested with one set of experiments each with methane and propane data of SL and ST /SL from the literature. Maximum turbulent intensity (u’) achieved was 1. 092 ms− 1. The ratios of turbulent to laminar burning velocity (ST /SL) values were determined at six different turbulence intensity levels. Laminar combustion experiments were extended to elevated initial pressures 2 - 5 bar and temperature 300 K. The value of SL was calculated from the pressure-time history recorded during laminar stretching flame propagation inside closed vessel. These SL values were compared with computed SL,∞ after accounting for stretch. Turbulent combustion simulations were carried out to validate combustion models suitable for multi-dimensional CFD simulation of combustion in constant volume closed chamber. Two models proposed by Choi and Huh, based on Flame Surface Density (FSD) were tested with the present experimental results. User FORTRAN code for the source terms in transport equation of FSD was implemented in ANSYS-CFX 10. 0 software. First model called CFM 1, grossly under-predicted the rate of combustion. The second model called CFM 2, predicted the results satisfactorily after replacing the arbitrary length scale with turbulent integral length scale (lt) having a limiting value near the wall. The modified CFM 2 model was able to predict the propagation phase of the developed flame satisfactorily, though the duration for initial flame development was over-predicted by the model. CFD simulation of producer gas engine combustion process was carried out using ANSYSCFX software. Mesh deformation option was used to take care of moving boundaries such as piston and valve surfaces. The fluid domain expands during suction process and contracts during compression process. In order to avoid excessive distortion of the mesh elements, a series of meshes at different crank angle positions were generated and checked for their quality during mesh motion in the solver. For suction process simulation, unstructured meshes having 0. 1 to 0. 3 million cells were used. During the compression and combustion process simulations, structured meshes having 40, 000 to 0. 1 million cells were used. k-ε model was used for turbulence simulation. The suction, compression and combustion processes of an SI engine were simulated. Initial flame kernel was given by providing high flame surface density in a small volume comparable to the spark size at the time of ignition. The flame surface density model, CFM- 2, was adapted with the modification of length scale tested against constant volume experiments. A suitable limiting value was used to avoid abnormal flame propagation near the wall. The limiting value of integral length scale (lt) near the wall was determined by linear extrapolation of the integral length scale in the domain to the wall. Engine p - θ curves of three different ignition timings 26 °, 12 ° and 6 °before top dead center (TDC) were simulated and compared with earlier experimental results. The effects of flow field on flame propagation have been observed. A comparison of the simulated and experimental p - θ diagram of the engine for all above cases gave mixed results. For the ignition timing at 26 ° before TDC case, predicted peak pressure value was 17 % higher and at 3 ° earlier than those of the experimental peak. For the other two cases, the predicted peak pressure value was 28 % lower and 5 ° later than those of the experimental peak. The reason for under-prediction of the pressure values could be due to the delay in development of initial flame kernel. Simulated pressure curves have offset about 3 - 4 ° compared to the experimental pressure curves. It was observed that in all predicted p - θ cases, there was a delay in the initial flame development. It is evident from the under-prediction of pressure values, especially in the initial flame kernel development phase and it also affects the p - θ curve at later stage. The delay was about 3 - 4 ° of crank angle rotation in various cases. The delay in predicting the initial flame development needs to be corrected in order to predict the combustion process properly. The proposed FSD model seems to have capability to predict p - θ values fairly in the propagation phase of developed flame. Reasonably good match was obtained by advancing the ignition timing in the computation by about 3 - 4 ° compared to the experimental setting. In the bowl-in-piston engine cylinders, the flow in the cylinder is characterised by squish and reverse squish when the piston is moving towards and away from the top dead center (TDC) respectively. The effect of squish and reverse squish flow on flame propagation has been assessed. For the more advanced ignition case, i. e., 26 ° before TDC, The flame propagation did not have favorable effect by the flow field. The direction of flame propagation was against the squish and reverse squish flow. This resulted in suppressed peak velocities in the cylinder compared the motoring process. Hence the burning rate was not augmented by the turbulence inside the cylinder. For the ignition 12 ° before TDC case, the flame propagation did have favorable effect by the flow field. During the reverse squish period, the flame had reached the bowl wall. At this stage, the flame was pushing the reactants out and this augments the reverse-squish flow, and hence the maximum reverse-squish velocity was increased to 2. 03 times the peak reverse-squish velocity of motoring case. The reverse-squish flow was distorting the flame from spherical shape and the flame gets stretched. Flame surface enters the cylindrical region faster compared to the previous case. The stretched flame in the reverse-squish flow may be considered as reverse squish flame, as was proposed earlier by Sridhar G. The burn rate during the reverse squish period may be 2 to 2. 5 times the normal burn rate. For the ignition 6 ° before TDC case, the flame was very small in size and it did not affect the flow in squish period. During the reverse squish period, the flame radius was moderate compared to the bowl radius. The flame was pushing the reactants out and it increased the maximum reverse-squish velocity to 1. 3 times by the flame. In this case, the reverse-squish flow moderately affecting the flame shapes. The results of this study could give an idea of what ignition timing must be kept for favorable use of flow field inside the engine cylinder. Main contributions from the present work are: Multi-dimensional simulation of combustion process inside the engine cylinder operating on producer gas was carried out to examine flame/flow field interactions. Two models based on FSD were first tested against present experimental results in constant volume combustion chamber. In CFM 2 model; a modification of replacing the arbitrary length scale by integral length scale with a limiting value near the wall was suggested to avoid prediction of abnormally large turbulent burning velocity near the wall. This combustion model has been implemented in ANSYS-CFX 10. The required data of laminar and turbulent burning velocities of producer gas-air mixture has been determined by experiments and computations at varied initial pressures and turbulent intensities. Finally, the simulated engine pressure data has been compared with earlier experimental data of the engine operating on producer gas. The proposed FSD model has the capability to match well with the experimental results except for the initial flame kernel development phase. Even though this issue needs to be resolved, the work has brought out the important interaction between the flame propagation and flow field within the bowl-in-piston engine cylinder...|$|R
