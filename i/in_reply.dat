He took 2/76 including opposition captain Errol Holmes. <b>In</b> <b>reply</b> to the hosts' 221, Toshack made one in Australia's total of 389.

5|$|Australia's streak {{looked in}} danger during the First Test in Mumbai when they fell to 5/99 <b>in</b> <b>reply</b> to India's 171 when Gilchrist {{came to the}} crease.

5|$|Despite their {{differences}} on other matters, discussed at length in Carl von Clausewitz's {{study of the}} Campaign of 1815 and Wellington's famous 1842 essay <b>in</b> <b>reply</b> to it, the Prussian Clausewitz agreed with Wellington on this assessment.

5|$|In the First Test at Trent Bridge, Hassett {{came in on}} {{the second}} day with Australia at 4/185 <b>in</b> <b>reply</b> to England's 165. Australia had been scoring slowly due to England's use of leg theory. Hassett almost holed out early when he edged a ball just wide of the wicket-keeper. Hassett and Bradman were heckled for their slow batting but they {{remained}} unhurried in the face of England's stifling tactics Australia had plenty of time after bowling out their opponents easily. Hassett had a period of 20 minutes without scoring.|$|E

At the other end Johnston bowled his left arm orthodox spin and took 4/22 from 26 overs. Together the pair bowled almost unchanged, delivering 49.3 of 54.3 overs. Australia struggled <b>in</b> <b>reply</b> and stumps were called when they fell to 4/38.|$|E

He then stumped former England captain Bob Wyatt from McCool. <b>In</b> <b>reply</b> to the hosts' 233, Tallon was promoted to No. 6, but managed only six in a collapse of 4/38 before Australia recovered to declare at 8/462. He took a further three dismissals in the second innings, two of them stumpings from McCool's bowling, as Australia crushed the hosts by an innings and 17 runs. Tallon conceded 11 byes in the match.|$|E
