My impression is, {{after many years of}} consideration, that there never can have been anybody in the world who played worse. He made the most dismal sounds I have ever heard produced by any means, natural or artificial. I don't know what the tunes were--if there were such things in the performance at all, which I doubt--but the influence of the strain upon me was, first, to make me think of all my sorrows until I could hardly keep my tears back; then to take away my appetite; and lastly, to make me so sleepy that I couldn't keep my eyes open. They begin to close again, and I begin to nod, as the recollection rises fresh upon me. Once more the little room, with its open corner cupboard, and its square-backed chairs, and its angular little staircase leading to the room above, and its three peacock's feathers displayed over the mantelpiece--I remember wondering when I first went in, what that peacock would have thought if he had known what his finery was doomed to come to--fades from before me, and <b>I</b> <b>nod,</b> and sleep. The flute becomes inaudible, the wheels of the coach are heard instead, and I am on my journey.

She fades in her turn, and he fades, and all fades, and there is no flute, no Master, no Salem House, no David Copperfield, no anything but heavy sleep.|$|E

I love to pour out all myself, as plain As downright Shippen, or as old Montaigne: In them, as certain to be loved as seen, The soul stood forth, nor kept a thought within; In me what spots (for spots I have) appear, Will prove at least the medium must be clear. In this impartial glass, my muse intends Fair to expose myself, my foes, my friends; Publish the present age; but where my text Is vice too high, reserve it for the next: My foes shall wish my life a longer date, And every friend the less lament my fate.

[...] F. Alas, young man! your days can ne'er be long, In flower of age you perish for a song! Plums and directors, Shylock and his wife, Will club their testers, now, to take your life! [...] P. What? armed for virtue when I point the pen, Brand the bold front of shameless guilty men; Dash the proud gamester in his gilded car; Bare the mean heart that lurks beneath a star; Can there be wanting, to defend her cause, Lights of the Church, or guardians of the laws? Could pensioned Boileau lash in honest strain Flatterers and bigots even in Louis' reign? Could Laureate Dryden pimp and friar engage, Yet neither Charles nor James be in a rage? And I not strip the gilding off a knave, Unplaced, unpensioned, no man's heir, or slave? I will, or perish in the generous cause: Hear this, and tremble! you, who 'scape the laws.

This is my plea, on this I rest my cause-- What saith my counsel, learned in the laws? [...] F. Your plea is good; but still I say, beware! Laws are explained by men--so have a care. It stands on record, that in Richard's times A man was hanged for very honest rhymes. Consult the Statute: quart. I think it is, Edwardi sext. or prim. et quint. Eliz. See libels, satires--here you have it--read. [...] P. Libels and satires! lawless things indeed! But grave epistles, bringing vice to light, Such as a king might read, a bishop write; Such as Sir Robert would approve-- F. Indeed?

The work received mixed reception. Joseph Kraus felt it was the peak of Busch's life's work, his nephews called it a masterwork of world literature, and the publisher of a critical collective edition spoke of a narrative style that is not found in contemporary literature. Eva Weissweiler saw in the play Busch's attempt to prove himself in the novella genre, believing that everything that angered or insulted him, and his accompanying emotional depths, are apparent in the story. The 1895 story The Butterfly (Der Schmetterling) parodies themes and motifs and ridicules the religious optimism of a German romanticism which contradicted Busch's realistic anthropology influenced by Schopenhauer and Charles Darwin. Its prose is more stringent in narrative style compared to Edwards Dream. Both were not popular amongst readers, because of their unfamiliar style.|$|E

These invading microorganisms are recognized by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) of the innate immune system. This study assessed whether genetic variation in genes encoding PRRs influences the susceptibility to cSSSIs. Methods.   318 cSSSI patients and 328 healthy controls were genotyped for 9 non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in PRR genes coding for Toll-like receptors (TLR) 1 / 2 / 4 / 6, NOD-like receptor 2 and signaling adaptor TIRAP. PBMCs obtained from 74 SNP-genotyped healthy individuals were stimulated with Staphylococcus aureus. IL- 6 cytokine concentrations were determined in supernatants by ELISA. Results.  Polymorphisms in TLR 1 (S 248 N and R 80 T), TLR 2 (P 631 H) and TLR 6 (P 249 S) increased susceptibility to cSSSIs. Furthermore, PBMCs from individuals bearing the TLR 1 248 N or 80 T allele showed lower IL- 6 secretion upon stimulation with S. aureus.

40|$|Hydrogen {{sulphide}} (H 2 S) {{has been}} involved in cardiovascular homoeostasis but data about its role in animal models of diabetic pathology are still lacking. Here, we have analysed H 2 S signalling in a genetic model of diabetes, the non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice. NOD mice exhibit a progressive endothelial dysfunction characterized by a reduced reactivity of blood vessels as diabetes develops. NOD mice were divided into three groups according to different glycosuria values: NOD <b>I,</b> <b>NOD</b> II and NOD III. Age-matched non-obese resistant (NOR) mice were used as controls. H(2) S levels in plasma and aortic tissue were measured. Functional studies in aorta were carried out in isolated organ baths using both an exogenous source of H 2 S (NaHS) and the metabolic precursor (L-cysteine). Real time PCR and western blot analysis were also carried out on aortic tissues. NOD mice exhibited a progressive reduction of H 2 S plasma levels, which paralleled disease severity. L-cysteine-induced H 2 S production by aortic tissues was also progressively reduced. L-cysteine-induced vasorelaxation was significantly reduced in NOD mice while NaHS-induced relaxation was unaffected. ODQ (guanylate cyclase inhibitor), L-NAME (NO synthase inhibitor) or PAG, an inhibitor of cystathionine-gamma-lyase (CSE) inhibited H 2 S production induced by L-cysteine. In NOD mice, endogenous H 2 S production is significantly impaired. Also, the ability of isolated aorta to respond to exogenous H 2 S is enhanced and endothelium-derived NO appears {{to be involved in the}} enzymatic conversion of L-cysteine into H 2 S...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: The incretin-based therapy {{might be}} {{effective}} in patients possessing certain levels of preserved pancreatic beta-cells. However, doubts still exist regarding the efficacy of this atment in the recovery of tissues damaged by type 1 diabetes. Thus, {{the objective of this}} study was to evaluate the treatment with MK 0431 in salivary glands of spontaneously diabetic mice, focusing mainly on the possible therapeutic and hypoglycaemic effects of this dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitor in the recovery of these salivary tissues. Methods and results: Twenty mice were divided into two groups of 10 animals each: group <b>I</b> (<b>NOD</b> diabetic/untreated) and group II (NOD diabetic MK 0431 /treated). The group II was treated during 4 weeks with MK 0431 mixed in the food. The group I was maintained in the same way without receiving, however, any treatment. Glucose levels were monitored during treatment and salivary glands samples were collected at the end of treatment for the histological examination under both transmitted and polarized light microscopy. High glucose levels were observed in untreated animals, while in animals with treatment, reduction of these levels was observed. Tissue restructuring was also observed in animals submitted to therapy with MK 0431, mainly in relation to the attempt to extracellular matrix reorganization. Conclusions: According to results, the treatment with this dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitor contributed to the general homeostasis of the organism and to the reestablishment of both epithelial and stromal compartments which were damaged by the hyperglycaemic condition, demonstrating that the incretin-based therapy may be an important complementary treatment for the type 1 diabetic condition. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{interaction}} between proteins and cell receptors {{is related to}} tissue homeostasis such as in salivary glands. In this respect, alterations in hormone levels caused by hyperglycaemic conditions may interfere with this interaction, intensifying {{the damage caused by}} diabetes mellitus. Hormone replacement therapy is an option to reverse this damage, but doubts still exist regarding the efficacy of this procedure. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effect of oestrogen replacement therapy combined with insulin treatment on the expression of oestrogen (ER-alpha) and insulin receptors (INS-R) in the salivary glands of spontaneously diabetic mice. Twenty-five mice were divided into five group of 5 animals each: group <b>I</b> (<b>NOD</b> diabetic), group II (NOD diabetic treated with insulin), group III (NOD diabetic treated with oestrogen), group IV (NOD diabetic treated with insulin and oestrogen), and group V (control BALB/c mice). Group II received insulin, group III received oestrogen, and group IV received insulin plus oestrogen administered daily for 20 days. Groups I and V received saline for the same period of time to simulate treatment. Glucose and oestrogen levels were monitored during the experimental period and salivary gland samples were collected at the end of the experiment for fluorescence microscopy analysis of ER-alpha and INS-R. Animals receiving oestrogen replacement therapy plus insulin showed regulation of the expression of oestrogen and insulin receptors. Oestrogen treatment alone contributed to the recovery of these cell receptors. These results indicate that oestrogen replacement therapy alone, and especially when combined with insulin, is important for the recovery of the {{interaction between}} functional proteins and their receptors, thus contributing to the reestablishment of tissues damaged by the hyperglycaemic condition...|$|E

Associations between susceptibility to cSSSIs and a SNP were investigated by means of logistic regression models. In an additional cohort of 74 healthy individuals in whom the same SNPs were genotyped, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were obtained and stimulated with Staphylococcus aureus. Interleukin 6 concentrations were determined in supernatants by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to determine the correlation between genotypes and levels of IL- 6 secretion. RESULTS: In the genetic association analysis, polymorphisms in TLR 1 (S 248 N and R 80 T), TLR 2 (P 631 H), and TLR 6 (P 249 S) were associated with an increased susceptibility to cSSSIs.

I speak from a somewhat different place-as a woman of color who teaches Legal Writing and who, like most faculty who teach Legal Writing, is untenured. Of course, <b>I</b> <b>nod</b> my head with recognition as I read the stories shared by tenured or tenure-track women of color who teach 2 doctrinal courses, including challenges they face from students and colleagues. At the same time, I also know (1) that untenured women of color who teach Legal Writing face additional challenges because of their lower status in the academic hierarchy; (2) that those additional challenges are often invisible to, or ignored by, others, even those who might be allies on issues of race and gender; and (3) that their lack of status can demean and silence them, as well as prevent their institutions from benefiting from all they can contribute as scholars, teachers, and colleagues. In this essay, I share some of the voices of women of color who teach Legal Writing to illuminate the ways in which their status as skills faculty combines with their status as women of color to affect their experience within the legal academy. In doing so, I hope to remind us that, as we seek to challenge systems that devalue women of color in the academy based on their gender and race, we should also challenge systems of status that impact and marginalize this often overlooked group in the academy. 3 Part I situates this essay in my own experience and explains my purpose in writing it. Part II addresses ways in which women of color who teach Legal Writing can experience multiple marginalizations, based on their status as skills faculty as well as their race and gender, and shares some of their voices to illustrate those experiences of marginalization. In Part III, I explore some ways to address the barriers that undermine women of color who teach Legal Writing and to be more inclusive of them as respected colleagues in the academy...|$|E
