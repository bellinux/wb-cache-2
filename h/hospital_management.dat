Under the 1948 National Health Act, King's Medical and Dental School split from King's {{and became an}} independent school, but the school remerged with King's in 1983. The school further merged with the United Medical and Dental Schools of Guy’s and St Thomas’ Hospitals in 1998.|$|E

50|$|The {{models of}} <b>hospitals</b> <b>management</b> have major {{influences}} on HIS construction. HIS implementation requires both technical structural and behavioral sense, {{and development of}} HIS should be carried out {{within the context of}} the development itself. Application with HIS but without studying and absorbing has become one bottle neck for HIS development. Compared with hospitals' directors with MBA diploma in developed countries, who manage the hospitals, most of hospitals directors in China are good medicine experts, however, they aren’t familiar with modernization management. They have experience in management methods, but didn’t know normative and science management. When constructing HIS in their hospitals, they usually requested the HIS accommodate with their existing management modes in spite of their management modes were nonscientific and unreasonable. Besides the complexity of <b>hospital’s</b> <b>management,</b> workflows and circumstances in different hospitals differ very much. To meet the need of the <b>hospitals</b> <b>management,</b> the developers had to act according to actual circumstance, which lead to the HISs can’t meet the need of information communication and share because of low currency and commercialization. Good HIS should optimize hospital process, but in many Chinese hospitals, this was not the case, poor hospital process flow compromises the good HIS.|$|R

In 1948, under the National Health Service Act (1946), Coventry <b>Hospital</b> <b>Management</b> Committee took over the control of 23 institutions and annexes, 10 of which lay {{within the boundaries of}} the city.

50|$|Despite a decade-old court {{decision}} in its favor, the Jewish community {{was unable to}} regain possession of a state-run hospital in central Sofia until May 2009, when the Ministry of Health made the premises available and the hospital was relocated to another building. Prior to the relocation, the <b>hospital's</b> <b>management</b> contested in court the Jewish community's ownership over the building. On March 5, 2009, the court terminated the case based on {{a letter from the}} Health Ministry confirming the relocation, but the <b>hospital</b> <b>management's</b> appeal of the {{court decision}} was pending {{at the end of the}} reporting period. This paved the way for the Jewish community to take physical possession of the building, although its ownership remained contested. The pending court case made it difficult for them to profitably use this property.|$|R

The skyscraper-ish hospital buildings were designed mainly for housing short-term patients; therefore it has inadequate space for residents to move around freely. Moreover, the <b>hospital</b> <b>management</b> team forbids the patients from bringing with them personal belongings, from cooking, and from coming over to the front building, which policy is nothing less than discriminative.|$|E
500|$|Theme Hospital was {{released}} in March 1997 (although it was originally due for release in November 1996), and is part of Bullfrog's Designer Series. The game attracted some controversy from NHS managers, the Houses of Parliament, and The Daily Telegraph, who published an article criticising the game as [...] "sick" [...] because the British Medical Association was using it to train management staff. The NHS argued that the game mocked <b>hospital</b> <b>management.</b> Webley was invited to appear on a local radio station; he did not consider the game {{to make light of}} real-world health management because it featured fictional diseases rather than real ones. Theme Hospital was a commercial success, which surprised Bullfrog and Electronic Arts. It repeatedly appeared in the top five of budget charts and sold over 4 million copies. In 2014, Molyneux stated that he wanted the game to make a comeback, and described Theme Hospital as [...] "a great game that I and many people remember".|$|E

40|$|We {{develop a}} new {{methodology}} for measuring <b>management</b> practices in <b>hospitals,</b> and use this in 182 interviews of physicians and managers {{in public and private}} hospitals (covering 61 % of English acute trusts). We find our management measure is strongly correlated with hospital performance, both clinical outcomes like survival rates from heart attacks, and general operational and financial outcomes. Management in publicly owned hospitals (the National Health Service) compares poorly with management in manufacturing. These public hospitals also appear to have significantly worse management practices than private hospitals. Among publicly owned <b>hospitals</b> <b>management</b> scores are relatively higher for Foundation Trusts (hospitals with greater autonomy from the government), for larger hospitals and where managers have more clinical expertise. We also find some evidence that competition is associated with better <b>hospital</b> performance. <b>management,</b> <b>hospitals,</b> competition, productivity...|$|R

In the mid-19th century, hospitals and the medical profession became more professionalised, with a reorganisation of <b>hospital</b> <b>management</b> along more bureaucratic and administrative lines.

2500|$|Despite this, O'Connor {{agreed with}} Churchill and the Seventh Circuit that Mihm had erred in {{granting}} summary judgement against the nurse.

Every form, distinguished by procedure (surgical, pharmacological, anesthesiologic or related to blood transfusions) was evaluated for the accuracy and validity of information related to: diagnosis, prognosis, diagnostic and therapeutic opportunities, expected benefits, adverse-side effects, iatrogenic risks, privacy policy on personal data. The forms were judged by information completeness criteria "conformed" or "not conformed" with standards. Our analysis demonstrate that physicians often are unaware of legal and ethical topics related to constructing informed consent forms.

2500|$|Also {{published}} on 26 February 2015 was Kate Lampard's report into {{lessons to be}} learned from the health service's handling of the Savile scandal. [...] She concluded that:"Savile was a highly unusual personality whose lifestyle, behaviour and offending patterns were equally unusual. As a result of his celebrity, his volunteering, and his fundraising he had exceptional access to a number of NHS hospitals and took the opportunities that that access gave him to abuse patients, staff and others on a remarkable scale. Savile’s celebrity and his roles as a volunteer and fundraiser also gave him power and influence within NHS hospitals which meant that his behaviour, which was often evidently inappropriate, was not challenged as it should have been. Savile’s ability to continue to pursue his activities without effective challenge was aided by fragmented <b>hospital</b> <b>management</b> arrangements; social attitudes of the times, including reticence in reporting and accepting reports of sexual harassment and abuse, and greater deference than today towards those in positions of influence and power; and less bold and intrusive media reporting. [...] While it might be tempting to dismiss the Savile case as wholly exceptional, a unique result of a perfect storm of circumstances, the evidence we have gathered indicates that there are many elements of the Savile story that could be repeated in the future. There is always a risk of the abuse, including sexual abuse, of people in hospitals. There will always be people who seek to gain undue influence and power within public institutions including in hospitals. And society and individuals continue to have a weakness for celebrities.
