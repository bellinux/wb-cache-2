25|$|Tom Bombadil {{is not an}} {{important}} person—to the narrative. I suppose he has some importance as a 'comment.'

5000|$|As well as Stanislavski's early work, {{the ideas}} and {{techniques}} of his student Yevgeny Vakhtangov (who had died in 1922 {{at the age of}} 39) were also an important influence {{on the development of the}} Method. Vakhtangov's [...] "object exercises" [...] were developed further by Uta Hagen as a means for actor training and the maintenance of skills. Strasberg attributed to Vakhtangov the distinction between Stanislavski's process of [...] "justifying" [...] behaviour with the inner motive forces that prompt that behaviour in the character and [...] "motivating" [...] behaviour with imagined or recalled experiences relating to the actor and substituted for those relating to the character. Following this distinction, actors ask themselves [...] "What would motivate me, the actor, to behave in the way the character does?" [...] rather than the more Stanislavskian question [...] "Given the particular circumstances of the play, how <b>would</b> <b>I</b> behave, what <b>would</b> <b>I</b> do, how <b>would</b> <b>I</b> feel, how <b>would</b> <b>I</b> react?" ...|$|R
