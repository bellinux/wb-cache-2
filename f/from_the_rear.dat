5|$|During the Battle of Vergas, Ibrahim {{decided to}} attack the Maniots <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>rear.</b> His plan was to send a small fleet with a few {{soldiers}} to land at the Bay of Diros, 2 kilometers south of Areopolis. The aim of this was to capture the unguarded Areopoli, which cut the communication lines of the defenders at Vergas and demoralize them as well. He would then be able {{to attack the}} Maniots <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> and control the mountain passes to eastern Mani and Gytheio. Authors Peter Greenhalgh and Edward Eliopoulos describe this plan as excellent.|$|E

5|$|With the cataphracts' {{attention}} fixated elsewhere, Lucullus formed two cohorts into maniples {{and then}} {{ordered them to}} ford across the river.

5|$|Aphids: There {{are five}} species of aphids {{commonly}} found on apples: apple grain aphid, rosy apple aphid, apple aphid, spirea aphid and the woolly apple aphid. The aphid species {{can be identified}} by their color, {{the time of year}} when they are present and by differences in the cornicles, which are small paired projections <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> of aphids. Aphids feed on foliage using needle-like mouth parts to suck out plant juices. When present in high numbers, certain species reduce tree growth and vigor.|$|E
5|$|Brigade Headquarters was {{attacked}} by a force of Germans that had infiltrated through the woods. Informed of the attack, Lieutenant Colonel Terence Otway, the commanding officer of 9th Parachute Battalion, collected 'C' Company, his own headquarters staff and a small group armed with captured German MG 42 machine-guns. They approached the Germans <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> and trapped them in a crossfire, killing nineteen and capturing one. That afternoon two infantry platoons attacked 'A' Company, but were fought off by a counter-attack from 'C' Company's position.|$|E
2500|$|The Bijou Theatre {{building}} {{consists of}} two parts the original hotel section, completed in 1817, and <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> theater section, built in 1909.

[...] <b>From</b> <b>the</b> foyer, <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> entrance opens into a bar, with passageways {{to the left and}} right leading to the theater's orchestra floor, and stairways to the left and right accessing the theater's balconies and the original building's second floor (now offices for the theater).|$|R

5|$|Due to {{the steep}} slope {{on which the}} {{building}} is situated, {{it had to be}} specially designed out of concrete to fit into its foundations correctly. From the front, the building appears to have only three floors. However, <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>rear,</b> all of its six floors can be seen. One part of the building's foundation was made of concrete piles, and the other as a continuous foundation. Usually, these two approaches do not mix well but Horodecki somehow succeeded in overcoming this technical problem.|$|E
5|$|Hannibal {{intended}} {{that his}} cavalry, comprising mainly medium Hispanic cavalry and Numidian light horse, and positioned on the flanks, would defeat the weaker Roman cavalry and swing around {{to attack the}} Roman infantry <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> as it pressed upon Hannibal's weakened center. His veteran African troops would then press in from the flanks at the crucial moment, and encircle the overextended Romans.|$|E
5|$|Having been forewarned {{about the}} attack, the Portuguese {{commander}} {{had been able}} to begin preparations for the assault; however, he had planned on receiving a frontal assault and when the force came under attack <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> he was completely surprised. The Portuguese attempted to entrench themselves in rifle pits, but they became disoriented after Pinto and several other officers were slain early in the engagement.|$|E

5|$|Rather than {{turn left}} towards Concord, Marine Lieutenant Jesse Adair, {{at the head}} of the advance guard, decided on his own to protect the flank of the British column by first turning right and then leading the {{companies}} onto the Common itself, in a confused effort to surround and disarm the militia. Major Pitcairn arrived <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> of the advance force and led his three companies to the left and halted them. The remaining companies under Colonel Smith lay further down the road toward Boston.|$|E

5|$|The mid-engine {{complicated}} {{the design of}} the four-wheel drive system, and an innovative solution was needed to get drive <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> of the engine to the front wheels. The chosen design took the front-wheel drive from the central differential on the rear transaxle and sent it through the V in the centre of the engine using a quill drive, before joining an inverted differential. The clutch was a twin-plate unit designed by AP Racing.|$|E
5|$|Alexios {{advanced}} from Salonica {{and pitched}} {{camp on the}} river Charzanes near Dyrrhachium on October 15. He held a war council there and sought advice from his senior officers; among them was George Palaiologos, who had managed to sneak out of the city. A majority of the senior officers, including Palaiologos, urged caution, noting that time was with the Emperor. Alexios, however, favoured an immediate assault, hoping to catch Guiscard's army <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>rear,</b> {{while they were still}} besieging the city. Alexios moved his army to the hills opposite the city, planning to attack the Normans the next day.|$|E
5|$|As in all arthropods, the chelicerate {{body has}} a very small coelom {{restricted}} to small areas round the reproductive and excretory systems. The main body cavity is a hemocoel that runs most {{of the length of}} the body and through which blood flows, driven by a tubular heart that collects blood <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> and pumps it forward. Although arteries direct the blood to specific parts of the body, they have open ends rather than joining directly to veins, and chelicerates therefore have open circulatory systems as is typical for arthropods.|$|E

5|$|BMNH R.3078 {{was found}} at Peterborough, Cambridgeshire, in strata of the Upper Oxford Clay and {{consists}} {{of a series of}} vertebrae <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> half of the skeleton. Other remains, including a front leg with fossilized cartilage in its joint, a hind leg, and a partial sacrum have been referred to and accepted as C. stewarti. A whiplash tail from the same locality was thought by Charig as possibly belonging to Cetiosauriscus, but the assignment is not fully accepted by paleontologists.

5|$|Berkeley House on Piccadilly {{was named}} after John Berkeley, 1st Baron Berkeley of Stratton who had {{purchased}} its land, and that surrounding it, shortly after the Restoration of the Monarchy in 1660. In 1696, the Berkeley family sold the house and grounds to the 1st Duke of Devonshire (who renamed it Devonshire House) on the proviso that the view <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> of the house should not be spoiled. Berkeley Square was laid out {{to the rear of}} the house in the 1730s; because of the conditions of sale, houses were only built on the east and west sides of it. The west side still has various mid-18th century buildings along it, while the east side now contains offices including Berkeley Square House.|$|E
5|$|By 20:00, Scheer {{ordered the}} German line to {{complete}} a 180-degree turn eastward to disengage from the British fleet. The maneuver, conducted under heavy fire, caused disorganization in the German fleet. Kaiserin had come too close to Prinzregent Luitpold {{and was forced to}} haul out of line to starboard to avoid a collision. The latter vessel came up alongside Kaiserin at high speed. As a result, Kaiserin had to remain out of line and could not return to her assigned position. The turn reversed the order of the German line; Kaiserin was now the seventh ship <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> of the German line. At around 23:30, the German fleet reorganized into the night cruising formation. Kaiserin was the eleventh ship, {{in the center of the}} 24-ship line.|$|E
