500|$|The Special Edition DVD was {{released}} on November 16, 2004. In 2014, Brad Bird went to Warner Bros. {{to talk about the}} possibility of releasing The Iron Giant on Blu-ray. [...] "WB & <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>talking.</b> But they want a bare-bones disc. I want better," [...] Bird said on his Twitter account. He also said that fans can log on to their Twitter accounts and post a tweet on the Twitter homepage of Warner Bros. Home Entertainment, demanding a Collector's Edition Blu-ray for the film. On September 6, 2016, the movie {{was released}} on Blu-ray for the first time titled the [...] "Signature Edition".|$|E
500|$|In September 2007, Gavin Hood, {{director}} of , speculated {{that there would}} be a sequel, which would be set in Japan. During one of the post-credits scenes Logan is seen drinking at a bar in Japan. Such a location was the subject of Chris Claremont and Frank Miller's 1982 limited series on the character, which was not in the first film as Jackman felt [...] "what we need to do is establish who [...] is and find out how he became Wolverine". Jackman stated the Claremont-Miller series is his favorite Wolverine story. Of the Japanese arc, Jackman also stated, [...] "I won’t lie to you, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> to writers... I’m a big fan of the Japanese saga in the comic book." [...] Before X-Men Origins: Wolverines release, Lauren Shuler Donner approached Simon Beaufoy to write the script, but he did not feel confident enough to commit. By May 4, 2009, Jackman's company Seed Productions was preparing several projects, including a sequel to X-Men Origins: Wolverine to be set in Japan, but neither Jackman nor Seed has a production credit on the completed 2013 sequel. On May 5, 2009, just days after the opening weekend of X-Men Origins: Wolverine, the sequel was officially confirmed.|$|E
6000|$|She did {{not seem}} {{surprised}} or concerned at that. [...] "Imogene, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> to Mr. Colville about you and Mr. Morton." ...|$|E
60|$|In {{the half}} hour during which I {{remained}} alone upon the bluff, awaiting the return of Walkirk and the fishing party, I thought {{as much of the}} lady with whom <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> as the lady of whom <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>talking.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "But I did not advise him. I {{only said}} that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> {{to her about}} it. If he were {{to say to you}} that he <b>had</b> <b>been</b> recommending my mother to do this or that, you would not take it amiss?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I turned indignantly {{to see who}} was speaking. The {{opinions}} {{sounded like}} those of a theatrical manager. No one was in the room but I and the cat. No doubt <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> to myself, but the voice was strange to me.|$|R
6000|$|... "I can {{understand}} that, monsieur. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> to the maid, {{and it seems}} that they have no friends in these parts." ...|$|E
6000|$|THE PRINCESS. Excuse me. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> {{through the}} telephone: and I heard quite well, though I have never ventured before. Won't you sit down? ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> of {{his method}} and manner; the matter the reader has here before him; {{and it is}} good matter, glad, honest, kind, just.|$|E
6000|$|... "'Well,' I said, as unconcernedly {{as though}} <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> {{of the death}} of a lamb, though {{inwardly}} I was sick with horror and boiling with rage, 'and what do you mean to do about the matter, Maiwa, wife of Wambe?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not a word," [...] said Brooke. [...] "I {{came away}} {{a day or}} so after Gibson was settled; and as <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>talked</b> to all through the affair by both of them, I couldn't turn round and offer myself the moment he was gone. You won't object;--will you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps so, partly; but no--I wrong {{myself in}} that. It <b>has</b> not <b>been</b> Harcourt. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>talked</b> over; <b>I</b> <b>have</b> weakly {{allowed myself to}} <b>be</b> <b>talked</b> {{out of my own}} resolve, but it <b>has</b> not <b>been</b> done by Harcourt. I must tell you all: it is for that that I came here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Guest," [...] he said, [...] "there is a {{lady with}} whom <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> {{who wishes to}} renew her {{acquaintance}} with you. May I take you to her?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{glad that}} you came this afternoon," [...] Rachael continued. [...] "Bertrand and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>talking.</b> We think it well {{that you should be}} married very soon." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Good afternoon. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> to Sam Fisher. If you wait, {{you will}} see him passing away down the drive. He is leaving the house. I am coming back.' ...|$|E
60|$|When I {{said good}} night and went below {{it was with the}} feeling that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> with the one half of some sort of a dual creature. The other half had not spoken. Yet I sensed it there, {{fluttering}} and quick, behind the mask of words and flesh.|$|R
6000|$|He {{resumed his}} cigar with defiance, {{and was about}} turning away when Staniford spoke. [...] "Captain Jenness, my friend and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> this little matter over just before you came up. Will you {{let me say that}} I'm rather proud of having {{reasoned}} in much the same direction as yourself?" ...|$|R
60|$|I rested my chin on my {{knee and}} looked before {{me on the}} ground. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> until then to hold her; but I was now not sorry she should go: an {{impression}} is a thing so delicate to produce and so easy to overthrow! Presently she seemed to make an effort.|$|R
60|$|And {{here it was}} I {{found out}} that my Lunar Philosopher was only so in Disguise, {{and that he was}} no Philosopher, but the very Man <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> of.|$|E
60|$|Any fair {{critical}} {{account of}} Dickens must always make him out {{much smaller than}} he is. For any fair criticism of Dickens must take account of his evident errors, as I have taken account {{of one of the}} most evident of them during the last two or three pages. It would not even be loyal to conceal them. But no honest criticism, no criticism, though it spoke with the tongues of men and angels, could ever really talk about Dickens. In all this that I have said I have not been talking about Dickens at all. I say it with equanimity; I say it even with arrogance. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> about the gaps of Dickens. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> about the omissions of Dickens. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> about the slumber of Dickens and the forgetfulness and unconsciousness of Dickens. In one word, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> not about Dickens, but about the absence of Dickens. But when we come to him and his work itself, what is there to be said? What is there to be said about earthquake and the dawn? He has created, especially in this book of David Copperfield, he has created, creatures who cling to us and tyrannise over us, creatures whom we would not forget if we could, creatures whom we could not forget if we would, creatures who are more actual than the man who made them.|$|E
6000|$|... 'It is a pity that Miss Gardner {{has had to}} do with it,' said Violet. 'When <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> to her, I always am {{left with}} a worse {{impression}} of people than they deserve.' ...|$|E
60|$|Ransome {{gave me one}} of his attractive, intelligent, quick glances {{and went}} away with the tray. It {{occurred}} to me that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> somewhat in Mr. Burns' manner. It annoyed me. Yet often in darker moments I forgot myself into an attitude toward our troubles more fit for a contest against a living enemy.|$|R
6000|$|When, a {{few minutes}} afterwards, we left the house, Arthur's first remark was {{certainly}} a strange one. [...] "We've been there just twenty minutes," [...] he said, [...] "and I've done nothing but listen to you and Lady Muriel talking: and yet, somehow, I feel exactly as if <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> with her for an hour at least!" ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{gave her}} every assistance. [...] "It was when, after the music, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> to Lady John. You {{were on a}} sofa, not far from us, with Gilbert Long; and when, on Lady John's {{dropping}} me, I made a slight movement toward you, you most graciously met it by rising and giving me a chance while Mr. Long walked away." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I don't know {{anything}} about the hare, but you certainly have no right to complain because <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> to Mrs. Smith;--unless indeed you tell me {{that you are going to}} make her Mrs. Shand.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I'm {{very sorry}} I said such horrid {{things to you}} just now. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> to Mr Mifflin, and I want to say I think it was ever so nice and {{thoughtful}} of you. I understand everything.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'That instant,' said Ralph. 'I {{was coming}} to call for you, making sure to catch you before you left; but your mother and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> over family affairs, and the time has slipped away so rapidly--' ...|$|E
60|$|I spurred {{my horse}} {{like a man}} possessed. When I turned my head at the Reservoir works, {{the black and white}} liveries were still waiting--patiently waiting--under the grey hillside, and the wind brought me a mocking echo of the words <b>I</b> <b>had</b> just heard. Kitty bantered me a good deal on my silence {{throughout}} the remainder of the ride. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> up till then wildly and at random.|$|R
60|$|When I reached home it was late--so {{late that}} my mother, who seldom betrayed any {{interest}} or curiosity in my doings, asked me questions. I felt a curious reluctance {{at first to}} tell her with whom <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>talking,</b> and it <b>was</b> justified when I saw the effect which my words had upon her. A look almost of horror filled her eyes {{and her face was}} white with anger. It was as though a long-expected blow had fallen.|$|R
6000|$|By what {{accident}} I {{was left}} behind I cannot tell. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> to the second mate and telling him of a rather similar experience of mine in the China Sea, and holding him by the coat as I did so, when quite suddenly he took me by the shoulders, and rushing me into the deserted smoking-room said, [...] "Sit there, Mr. Borus, till I come back for you." [...] The fellow spoke in such a menacing way that I thought it wiser to comply.|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't {{you know}} that because you've been getting so savage about Frazer the whole team 's getting mad?" [...] said the coach. [...] "Cowles and Griffin and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> over the whole proposition. Your {{boosting}} Frazer----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Some of it. While {{you were}} {{dressing}} yourself, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> {{to the officer}} who was in command of your boat. He was a brave man, Benita, and I am sorry to tell you he is gone." ...|$|E
6000|$|The girl nodded. [...] "They are splendid. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> to them, {{and made}} one sit still while I drew him. Please don't trouble about supper. I have seen cookie, and he's {{going to make}} the very things I like." ...|$|E
60|$|Once--it {{was in the}} old harbour, {{just before}} the Tremolino's last voyage--he {{vanished}} thus overboard to my infinite consternation. Dominic and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> business together aft, and Cesar had sneaked up behind us to listen, for, amongst his other perfections, he was a consummate eavesdropper and spy. At {{the sound of the}} heavy plop alongside horror held me rooted to the spot; but Dominic stepped quietly to the rail and leaned over, waiting for his nephew's miserable head to bob up for the first time.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, now, I should say, Never wade {{across a}} South American river at all," [...] said Miss Millet; [...] "but, brother, that's not what I meant. Before you arrived, Jeff and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> about God's ways with man, and I {{was trying to}} show that {{disasters}} and what we call misfortunes are not necessarily evil, but are often the means of great blessing. I don't think Jeff quite sees that. I can't explain myself clearly, brother; {{but you know what}} I mean." ...|$|R
6000|$|Had he been awake, while Miss Jillgall and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> {{outside his}} door? Had {{he heard her}} ask me if Mr. Gracedieu had said nothing of Helena's infamous conduct to her sister, while he was {{speaking}} of Eunice? The way to the lost remembrance <b>had</b> perhaps <b>been</b> found there. In any case, after that bitter allusion to his [...] "wicked daughter" [...] some result must follow. Helena Gracedieu and a day of reckoning might be nearer to each other already than <b>I</b> <b>had</b> ventured to hope.|$|R
