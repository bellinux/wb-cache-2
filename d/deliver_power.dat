25|$|The {{adoption}} of high power fiber lasers as an industrial material processing tool has been ongoing {{for several years}} and is now expanding into other markets including the medical and scientific markets. One key enhancement enabling penetration into the scientific market has been the improvements in high finesse fiber amplifiers, which are now capable of delivering single frequency linewidths (<5nbsp&kHz) together with excellent beam quality and stable linearly polarized output. Systems meeting these specifications, have steadily progressed {{in the last few years}} from a few Watts of output power, initially to the 10s of Watts and now into the 100s of Watts power level. This power scaling has been achieved with developments in the fiber technology, such as the {{adoption of}} stimulated brillouin scattering (SBS) suppression/mitigation techniques within the fiber, along with improvements in the overall amplifier design. The latest generation of high finesse, high power fiber amplifiers now <b>deliver</b> <b>power</b> levels exceeding what is available from commercial solid-state single frequency sources and are opening up new scientific applications as a result of the higher power levels and stable optimized performance.|$|E

Lewis Corner for Digital Spy praised the song, writing that Lewis combined her ability to <b>deliver</b> <b>power</b> ballad lyrics into a dance orientated song. Corner compared the song to Katy Perry's [...] "Firework", also produced by Sandy Vee; however, Corner noted that Lewis performs [...] "Collide" [...] in a way which distances the comparison. Katherine St. Asaph for Popdust was critical of the song. Whilst she noted that Lewis was venturing into dance music, where artists such as David Guetta and Kylie Minogue have experienced great success, and that Lewis has an iconic voice compared to both, she felt that the delivery still lacked. St. Asaph wrote [...] "The lethargic, two-note verses make her voice sound less husky than bored, an emotion that a comeback single should never evoke." [...] Michael Cragg for The Guardian felt that the song seemed to build and drop at the wrong times, and that its structure was not cohesive. Cragg continued to say that Lewis does a [...] "passable job as a dance diva," [...] and noted the resemblances between [...] "Collide" [...] and [...] "Penguin".|$|E

40|$|The {{capacity}} of deterministic, complex and discrete time memoryless Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) channel under three constraints, namely, channel input average power, channel input amplitude and <b>delivered</b> <b>power</b> at the channel output is considered. The <b>delivered</b> <b>power</b> constraint is modelled as a linear combination of even-moment statistics {{of the channel}} input being larger than a threshold. It is shown that the {{capacity of}} an AWGN channel under transmit average <b>power</b> and receiver <b>delivered</b> <b>power</b> constraints {{is the same as}} the capacity of an AWGN channel under an average power constraint, however, depending on the two constraints, it can be either achieved or arbitrarily approached. It is also shown that under average <b>power,</b> amplitude and <b>delivered</b> <b>power</b> constraints, the optimal capacity achieving distributions are discrete with a finite number of mass points. To establish the results, the confluent hypergeometric functions as well as the output rate of decay of complex Gaussian channels are utilized extensively. As an application, a simultaneous information and power transfer (SWIPT) problem is studied, where an experimentally-validated nonlinear model of the harvester is used. Relying on small signal analysis approximation, a general form of the <b>delivered</b> Direct-Current (DC) <b>power</b> in terms of system baseband parameters is derived for independent and identically distributed (iid) inputs. It is shown that the <b>delivered</b> <b>power</b> depends on higher order statistics of the channel input.
