40|$|Abstract: Particle coating is {{becoming}} increasingly important in fertilizer, pharmaceutical and food industries. The demand for coating granular fertilizers with minerals is increasing. Urea is coated with PhosphoGypsum, neem oil, polymeric suspensions and micronutrients like sulfer, zinc etc. Coating of PhosphoGypsum on urea fertilizer is a important application of coating process. Coating of urea particles is done to increase nitrogen use efficiency of urea. Nitrogen losses due to leaching, surface volatilization, and denitrification can be minimized by controlling the dissolution rate. Coating also helps to <b>impart</b> <b>strength,</b> increase in bulk density and lowering of caking tendency, thus improving the handling properties. The objective of present paper is to present the improvement in properties of urea obtained by fluidized bed coating of urea with Phosphogypsum using wet and dry methods.

40|$|Abstract: The {{investigation}} of the present work brings out the effect of Raichur Fly Ash (RFA) and Nyveli Fly Ash (NFA) on California Bearing Ratio (CBR) of two extreme soils, Black Cotton soil and Red earth. CBR of soil fly ash mixtures assume great importance in their use for road construction. CBR are modified depending on the soaking condition. Thus the CBR of soil fly ash mixtures are determined as compacted and also in soaked condition. CBR of fly ashes under un-soaked conditions exhibit higher values because of additional resistance from capillary forces, for instance when 20 % of RFA is added to black cotton soil under Unsoaked condition, blend has shown CBR of 10. 38 % as found in results. In presence of water fly ashes loose capillary forces and gives lesser CBR, where blend has shown CBR of 4. 56 % for addition of same quantity of RFA. Same additions when it is made to Red earth, the corresponding results are 11. 74 % for Unsoaked and 4. 74 % for soaked conditions. In cases of fly ash with calcium, they generate cementitious gel and <b>impart</b> <b>strength</b> to mix, which increases the CBR even in soaked condition[1]. Addition of cement to RFA and lime to NFA, the resistance of blends increases. CBR of soils with RFA exhibits pronounced peaks at fly ash contents of 20 % and 80 %.

40|$|Three Dimensional Printing (3 DP) is {{a process}} that enables the {{fabrication}} of geometrically complex parts directly from computer-aided design (CAD) models. The success of 3 DP as an alternative manufacturing technology to bulk machining of materials for complex parts has been demonstrated. By proof of concept, 3 DP has demonstrated the ability to create parts with Local Control of the Composition (LCC). LCC allows tailoring the material properties in regions of a part for functional purposes. In this work, LCC was studied and demonstrated by fabricating bimetallic bars consisting of two layers of Fe-Ni alloys with different composition and, hence, different thermal expansion properties; the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) of Fe-Ni system is sensitive to its composition. Two types of the binder/dopant slurries were made for making the LCC bars. One type consisted of dispersions of Fe₂O₃ particles in water, and the other consisted of dispersion of NiO in water. The LCC bars were successfully made by printing the Fe₂O₃/NiO slurries into Fe- 30 Ni base powders. After heat treatment to <b>impart</b> <b>strength</b> to the printed bars, the bars were successfully retrieved from unbound powders. The bars, then, were annealed at 1400 ⁰C for 2 hours for sintering and homogenization. The final composition of the base powders were changed accordingly. In the layers on which an Fe₂O₃ slurry was printed, the Fe composition of the layers increased on average to 72 wt%. Similarly, the Ni composition of the Ni-enriched layers of the bars increased on average to 33 wt%. The densification and local homogenization resulting from reduction and sintering treatments were not satisfactory. (cont.) The major problem was presumably caused by the oxide residues. The presence of the oxide powders was evident from the microprobe measurement. The oxide residues caused the local compositions to be inhomogeneous. As a result, the compositional profiles showed considerable scatter. Moreover, the residues impeded the sintering rate of the bars; the sintering densities of the bars were as small as 78 % of the theoretical density. The resulting bimetallic bars did exhibit bending deflection on uniform heating. However, the bending deflections were much smaller than expected. Evidently, the compositional profiles of the bars critically influence their thermal bending properties. The scatter in the compositional profiles resulted in local variations of CTE in the bars, which degraded the thermal bending properties. A linear elastic model that allows prediction of the deflection as a function of composition profile shows good agreement with the observed deflections in the bimetallic bars with LCC. by Ratchatee Techapiesancharoenkij.

40|$|As {{the global}} {{population}} rises {{to an estimated}} 9. 4 bn by 2050, the pressure for food, fuel and freshwater will continue to increase. Current renewable energy technologies are not widely applicable to the transport sector, which requires energy dense liquid fuels that drop into our existing infrastructure. Algal biofuels promise significantly higher yields than plants, without the displacement of valuable agricultural resources and {{have the potential to}} meet the global demand for transport fuel. Fossil fuel energy is largely ‘a legacy of algal photosynthesis’, with algae accounting for ~ 50 % of global CO 2 fixation today. In addition, these curious organisms show remarkable diversity in form, behaviour and composition. Recently there has been a global resurgence of interest in microalgae as a resource of biomass and novel products. With the present level of technology, knowledge and experience in commercial scale aquaculture, the capital cost and energy investment for algal biomass production is high. Culturing, harvesting and disrupting microalgal cells account for the largest energy inputs with more positive energy balances requiring low energy designs for culture, dewatering and extraction, efficient water and nutrient recycling with minimal waste. Little is known about the variable cell wall of microalgae, which presents a formidable barrier to the extraction of microalgal products. Staining, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and enzymatic digestion were all utilised in an attempt to visualise, digest and characterise the cell wall of stock strains of Chlorella spp. and Pseudochoricystis ellipsoidea. The presence of algaenan, a highly resistant biopolymer, rendered staining and enzymatic digestion techniques ineffective. TEM revealed that algaenan is present in the outer walls of microalgae in a variety of conformations which appeared to <b>impart</b> <b>strength</b> to cells. A preliminary investigation utilising Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. elaeidis as a novel source of enzymes for the digestion of algaenan has also been described. Methods were developed for the mutagenesis of Chlorella emersonii and P. ellipsoidea using EMS and UV with the intent of generating cell-wall mutants. Although no viable cell wall mutants were produced, a viable pale mutant of C. emersonii was recovered 5 from UV mutagenesis. Growth rates of the pale mutant were significantly slower than the wild type, yet FAME profile was largely unaffected. Fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) was also investigated as a means for the rapid screening of mutagenized cells for cell wall mutants. In an attempt to reduce cooling costs of closed-culture systems, temperature tolerant species of microalgae were sought by bioprospecting the thermal waters of the Roman Baths. Numerous methods for isolation and purification of microalgae from the Baths were employed, ultimately yielding seven diverse isolates including cyanobacterial, eukaryotic, filamentous and single celled species. Despite some species possessing an increased tolerance to higher temperatures, none showed marked temperature tolerance coupled with high productivity. Further improvements to the culture conditions may have improved the productivity at higher temperatures. All seven isolates were deposited to the Culture Collection of Algae and Protozoa (CCAP). A variety of extraction methods including soxhlet, beadbeating, sonication and microwaving was investigated for efficacy of extracting fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) from C. emersonii. Beadbeating proved most effective in the extraction of FAMEs from C. emersonii. Microwaving showed potential as a rapid method of extraction yet was coupled with degradation of FAMEs, requiring further method development to resolve this issue. Method development has been a significant component of the work described in this thesis. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
