50|$|Delta Velorum is {{a triple}} star system. The outward {{components}} A and B {{have a wide}} orbit with a 142-year orbital period. The primary component A has an apparent magnitude of 1.99, while the secondary component B is magnitude 5.57, with a combined magnitude measured at 1.96. In 1978 the primary component {{was reported to be}} a spectroscopic binary in the Proceeding of the Australian Astronomical observatory, and this was confirmed by the Hipparcos satellite. Observations of variability in the Î´ Velorum system were made independently by ground-based astronomers and the <b>Galileo</b> <b>spaceprobe</b> at Jupiter.|$|E
40|$|Space dust {{consists}} of particles typically 0. 1 mm in diameter or less. They overlap with {{the sizes of}} the smallest radar meteor particles. Clouds of space dust can be observed by scattered sunlight, such as that scattered by comet tails, planetary rings or the faint zodiacal cloud. The size distribution of interplanetary dust from a few micrometers to millimeters {{was determined by the}} analysis of lunar microcraters and verified by near-Earth satellites. In situ measurements of space dust provide information on spatial and orbital distributions, and on physical and chemical properties of dust in interplanetary space. Spaceprobes measured interplanetary dust at distances of 0. 3 to 18 AU from the Sun. Models of the interplanetary dust cloud have been developed on the basis of zodiacal light, thermal infrared observations, in situ measurements, microcrater statistics, and radar meteor observations. These models provide spatial density, dust flux, and line-of-sight brightness of interplanetary dust. Dust rings have been observed orbiting all giant planets. In situ studies of dust in the jovian system found various sources of dust: all the larger satellites and even the volcanoes on Jupiter's moon Io. The dust detectors on board the Ulysses and <b>Galileo</b> <b>spaceprobes</b> identified submicron-sized interstellar dust sweeping through the solar system...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{present the}} mass {{distribution}} of interstellar grains measured in situ by the <b>Galileo</b> and Ulysses <b>spaceprobes</b> as cumulative flux. The derived in situ mass distribution per logarithmic size interval {{is compared to}} the distribution determined by fitting extinction measurements. Large grains measured in situ contribute significantly to the overall mass of dust in the local interstellar cloud. The problem of a dust-to-gas mass ratio that contradicts cosmic abundances is discussed. ...|$|R
40|$|The <b>Galileo</b> and Ulysses <b>spaceprobes</b> carry two similar dust {{detectors}} through {{interplanetary space}} from Venus to Jupiter. Impacts are reported which correspond to dust particles above a mass threshold of about 10 exp 13 g for which complete records exist. Between December 1989 and January 1992 Galileo repeatedly traversed interplanetary space between 0. 7 and 2. 26 AU and recorded 374 impacts. The observed impact rates ranged from 0. 1 to about 3 impacts per day strongly dependent {{on whether the}} spacecraft moved toward or away from the sun. From October 1990 to January 1992 the Ulysses spacecraft had reached a distance of 5. 17 AU {{from the sun and}} had recorded 72 impacts at rates between 0. 1 and 0. 5 per day. Inside about 2 AU the observed fluxes are compatible with a population of interplanetary dust particles moving on low to moderately eccentric and low inclination orbits. Outside this distance a dust particle population on different orbits is required in order to explain the Ulysses data...|$|R

40|$|Signatures {{indicative}} of a subglacial ocean on the Jovian satellite Europa have been discovered by the <b>Galileo</b> <b>spaceprobe.</b> The structure and chemistry of this postulated ocean, have received considerable attention, and its exploration {{is seen as an}} important goal for the fields of comparative planetology and astrobiology. Terrestrial subglacial lakes (e. g., Lake Vostok) have been considered as analogues for several aspects of a Europan ocean and the means of exploring such an environment will be discussed. We review the concept of melting probes, i. e. small probes with a heated tip ("hot point"), that melt through the ice. Such devices can carry instruments for in-situ measurements, or act as sample-return probes by a new concept of melting "upwards" once the sampling in the liquid ocean has been performed. Experience with melting probes in Antarctica exists; a demonstration mission to, e. g., Lake Vostok is proposed, and a possible design for a mission to Europa is outlined. Although, for Europan mission, a probe capable of in-situ analysis might differ substantially from the terrestrial "sample-return" version. ...|$|E
