2500|$|In January it {{was decided}} to {{manufacture}} a longer suspension. Schneider had, already before 9 December 1915, devised a system thirty centimetres longer with seven road wheels instead of five. Mourret ordered to build an alternative system. [...] Two Baby Holt tractors, part of the order of fifteen by Schneider on 21 September 1915, and property of the French State, were during two weeks from 2 February onwards in an army workshop combined into a single elongated vehicle, a caterpillar offensif allongé, by Lieutenant Charles Fouché, assisted by a small team of mechanics. The workshop was in the Farman factory at Billancourt appropriated from the l'Automobilette company. It was again about a foot longer than the Schneider type, and featured three bogies with a total of eight road wheels. The new suspension system was not based on exact blueprints but improvised by private Pierre Lescudé. On 17 February the eight-wheeled system, which prototype was later designated L'appareil n° 1 Type A ("Device Number 1 Type A") was tested at Vincennes, easily crossing trenches up to 1.75 metres wide and overcoming barbed wire obstacles. On 21 February successful tests were held at Vincennes, the Schneider company providing a non-elongated Baby Holt chassis for comparison. From this it was concluded that the tank was sufficiently developed to justify a production order. On 25 February 1916 the War Ministry secretly ordered the production of four hundred tracteurs-chenilles type Schneider & Cie blindés ("tracked and armoured tractors of the Schneider type"), at a price of 56,000 French francs per vehicle. For security reasons it was pretended these were simple towing vehicles, tracteurs Estienne. The earlier order of 15 December for ten vehicles was <b>hereby</b> <b>replaced.</b> Fouché was ordered to improve the prototype, which resulted in a slightly changed L'appareil n° 1 Type B, tested on 2 March. Further changes, now including improvised side armour extending to the front in a bow, created the L'appareil n° 1 Type C or Machine Profilée which was tested on 17 March. On 27 February, Schneider had been asked to provide a first armoured superstructure made of boiler steel, which was late March placed on the eight-wheeled chassis. Pictures of this vehicle have often been presented in books as showing the [...] "first Schneider CA prototype". However, this entire development line, even though its official order had been based on it, would not be ancestral to the Schneider tank. In the Spring of 1916, for reasons that are not entirely clear, there was a fundamental falling-out between the French Army and Schneider Cie. The latter company would develop and produce its Schneider tank {{on the basis of its}} seven-wheeled chassis, which had been patented on 17 January; the Army would develop the eight-wheeled system into the Saint-Chamond heavy tank.|$|E

40|$|International audienceFor several decades, {{a growing}} number of protohistoric sites in Auvergne (MassifCentral, France) - mostly {{excavated}} through preventive archaeology - have beensubject to the collection of archaeobotanical analysis. This study presents thearchaeobotanical results from ten La Tène sites dating from the last five centuriesbefore the Roman conquest. In addition to providing an inventory of taxa, this paperconcerns crops and crop cultivation methods. These results are interpreted in a widercontext, dealing with crop husbandry, arable farming, storage and consumptionpractices. The sites are located in the Limagne plain within a fifty kilometre radiusaround the city of Clermont-Ferrand. A total of 23, 579 carpological remains wereidentified from 163 sediment samples totalizing a volume of 1096 liters. Comparable toother sites in Gaul, the spectrum of cereals and pulses is restricted. Spelt (Triticumspelta), einkorn (Triticum monococcum) and foxtail millet (Setaria italica) aredisappearing or become rare. A better control of agricultural techniques and increasedyields are supposed during the ca. five centuries of the La Tène period. Mixedcultivation is <b>hereby</b> <b>replaced</b> by the sowing of monocrops. At the beginning of thisperiod, farming systems are dominated by a polyculture of cereals and pulses.

30|$|From Definition 1, {{the generic}} {{framework}} {{we are seeking}} requires an ontological representation that can achieve CG distribution over properties whose value spaces are continuous. In this pursuit, all continuous quantities in the domain should have multivariate Gaussian distributions, i.e. CG, of the type CondG. Thus, for each property with a continuous value space in ontology, we specify two types of distributions: discrete distribution over an equivalent property that has a discrete value space of the continuous domain; and a CG distribution over the continuous value space of the property. This fictitious (equivalent) discrete property serves as the sole parent of the continuous property in the equivalent DAG of HyProb-Ontology. The fictitious discrete property <b>hereby</b> <b>replaces</b> the continuous property in all dependencies in the ontology, and its representation follows those of the discrete setting.|$|R
40|$|The {{authors would}} like to amend this article based on the {{discovery}} that the originally pub-lished Acacia ligulata sequence contains assembly errors, which came to light after the publica-tion of the article. We have since re-sequenced part of the original genome, and in a separate project, sequenced the chloroplast genome of another individual from the same species, using an improved sequencing and assembly protocol. Based on the new results, we can confirm that the original sequence we released contained assembly errors. We have corrected the errors and the European Nucleotide Archive has accepted the revised sequence under the same accession number. The main differences concern the genome size, which was discovered to be nearly 16 kb larger, and the content and structure of repeated sequences; more sequences are repeated than we initially realised. One tRNA gene has been added (encoding tRNA-Ser(GCU)). To bring the published description fully into line with the revised genome sequence, we <b>hereby</b> <b>replace</b> Figs 1, 2 and 3 and S 1 and S 2 Tables, and update S 3 Table to include the primers used for the additional sequencing that was needed to resolve the assembly problems...|$|R
40|$|The {{classical}} ironing {{process by}} which walls of cups (or cans, etc.) are thinned is <b>hereby</b> <b>replaced</b> by a new fluid-pressure assisted process. This "hydrostatic ironing process " {{has the advantage of}} providing, under some restrictions, an unlimited amount of wall-thickness reduction. The analysis offered here is intended to explain why and how this can be achieved and to provide guidelines for designing such a process. Essentially, the analysis relates the governing variables of the process (geometrical variables, material variables, operating speed, and various friction parameters) with the applied fluid pressure via lower and upper bounds solutions. Based on these solutions, the technological advantages (and limitations) of this process are shown. Some generality is obtained by allowing the material to behave, not only as ideally perfect, but also as visco-plastic (to simulate warm temperature conditions) and as a power-law hardening material. The dynamic response to high speeds is predicted, showing that operating at high speeds is not recommended if the fluid pressure source is limited in its power. The two bounds of the solution, presented here, are relatively close to each other and coincide at small die angles. They provide, subsequently, a useful engineering tool for predetermining the operating fluid pressure for a given situation. The solutions match satisfactorily preliminary tests generated by a semi-industrial hy-drostatic ironing machine with fluid pressure drive of 600 MPa. Presently, the process proves its capabilities by ironing wall-thickness of steel cups to 60 percent of its initial thickness, at relatively slow speeds (few centimeters per second) ...|$|E
40|$|Mapping can be {{intense and}} {{laborious}} {{with the current}} method in term of the work environment, manpower, cost, time, and obviously, the equipment used for the work. Traditional mapping technique uses photogrammetry, total station and GPS. The level for detailing and levelling is not convincing fast enough {{to catch up with}} the revolution of the world. However, aerial photogrammetry had been introduced to improve the mapping method in terms of accuracy, work done and speed. Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) is the latest realization of aerial photogrammetry to the mapping world. This technique is capable of mapping large area compared to conventional technique of mapping in short time with less work and effort, while the accuracy is maintained. This paper highlights the capability of UAS to replace the conventional technique of mapping. To test the accuracy of this product, the technique used in determining the ground control point (GCP) is studied. The accuracy of GPS plays big impact in the accuracy of the map produced, due to its role in establishing the GCP for the map. In this study, the conventional technique in determining the GCP is <b>hereby</b> <b>replaced</b> with better technique to produced better accuracy. The technique of GPS observation used is static with network processing which is never been used before in UAS. The concept here is the accuracy of map is improved by improving the accuracy of GCP. Furthermore the technique of GPS observation determined the accuracy of GCP. This paper, presents a new procedure using UAS for precise mapping and this method is expected to replace the conventional technique of producing topographic map...|$|E
40|$|This article {{describes}} a neural network model, called the VITEWRITE model, for generating handwriting movements. The model {{consists of a}} sequential controller, or motor program, that interacts with a trajectory generator to move a. hand with redundant degrees of freedom. The neural trajectory generator is the Vector Integration to Endpoint (VITE) model for synchronous variable-speed control of multijoint movements. VITE properties enable a simple control strategy to generate complex handwritten script if the hand model contains redundant degrees of freedom. The proposed controller launches transient directional commands to independent hand synergies at times when the hand begins to move, or when a velocity peak in a given synergy is achieved. The VITE model translates these temporally disjoint synergy commands into smooth curvilinear trajectories among temporally overlapping synergetic movements. The separate "score" of onset times used in most prior models is <b>hereby</b> <b>replaced</b> by a self-scaling activity-released "motor program" that uses few memory resources, enables each synergy to exhibit a unimodal velocity profile during any stroke, generates letters that are invariant under speed and size rescaling, and enables effortless. connection of letter shapes into words. Speed and size rescaling are achieved by scalar GO and GRO signals that express computationally simple volitional commands. Psychophysical data concerning band movements, such as the isochrony principle, asymmetric velocity profiles, and the two-thirds power law relating movement curvature and velocity arise as emergent properties of model interactions.

40|$|AbstractThe {{intercellular}} {{stratum corneum}} (SC) lipids form the main barrier for diffusion of substances through the skin. A porous substrate covered with synthetic SC lipids {{would be an}} attractive model to study percutaneous penetration, <b>hereby</b> <b>replacing</b> native human SC. Prerequisite is that this stratum corneum substitute (SCS) is prepared with a uniform lipid composition and layer thickness. Furthermore, the lipid organization and orientation should resemble that in SC. The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate the utility of an airbrush spraying device to prepare a SCS composed of cholesterol, ceramides and free fatty acids on a polycarbonate filter. The results demonstrate that a proper choice of solvent mixture and lipid concentration is crucial to achieve a uniform distribution of the applied lipids over the filter surface. A smooth and tightly packed lipid layer is only obtained when the equilibration conditions are appropriately chosen. The SCS possesses two crystalline lamellar phases with periodicities similar to those present in native SC. The orientation of these lamellae is mainly parallel to the surface of the polycarbonate filter, which resembles the orientation of the intercellular SC lipids. In conclusion, the airbrush technique enables generation of a homogeneous SCS, which ultimately may function as a predictive in vitro percutaneous penetration model...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} two algorithms, one monocular-camera and one multiple-view camera based, {{to estimate}} several anthropometric parameters of human skeletons underlying the human avatar {{consisting of a}} human skeleton and a mesh model. This results in an on-line implementation, which can use cheap sensors to give adequate results for biomechanical tracking with only four to seven parameters in the estimation process. The first, single-view camera based (monocular-camera), algorithm uses the MakeHuman (Bastioni and Flerackers, 2007) mesh model to estimate several anthropometric parameters that are directly or indirectly observable, such as length, hip and waist circumference, age …. The second, multiple-view camera based, algorithm uses a voxel-based method to estimate both the length parameters {{and the weight of}} the person. This is achieved by a multiple-view visual hull reconstruction that overfits the person in order to iteratively increase the number of voxels to better match the actual human's shape. This voxel-technique is furthermore used for person segmentation (head, torso, arms, and legs). The proposed methods are currently being extended to combine visual images with a depth image (Microsoft Kinect) or a laser range image (Hokuyo), since these sensors directly provide a point cloud of the person, <b>hereby</b> <b>replacing</b> the otherwise computational expensive voxel technique...|$|R
40|$|This {{article is}} about S-estimation for penalized {{regression}} splines. Penalized regression splines {{are one of}} the currently most used methods for smoothing noisy data. The estimation method used for fitting such a penalized regression spline model is mostly based on least squares methods, which are known to be sensitive to outlying observations. In real-world applications, outliers are quite commonly observed. There are several robust estimation methods taking outlying observations into account. We define and study S-estimators for penalized regression spline models. <b>Hereby</b> we <b>replace</b> the least squares estimation method for penalized regression splines by a suitable S-estimation method. By keeping the modeling by means of splines and by keeping the penalty term, though using S-estimators instead of least squares estimators, we arrive at an estimation method that is both robust and flexible enough to capture nonlinear trends in the data. Simulated data and a real data example are used to illustrate the effectiveness of the procedure. Software code (for use with R) is available online. status: publishe...|$|R
