40|$|<b>Homologous</b> <b>recombination</b> is a {{universal}} mechanism that allows DNA repair and ensures the efficiency of DNA replication. The substrate initiating the process of <b>homologous</b> <b>recombination</b> is a single-stranded DNA that promotes a strand exchange reaction resulting in a genetic exchange that promotes genetic diversity and DNA repair. The molecular mechanisms by which <b>homologous</b> <b>recombination</b> repairs a double-strand break have been extensively studied and are now well characterized. However, the mechanisms by which <b>homologous</b> <b>recombination</b> contribute to DNA replication in eukaryotes remains poorly understood. Studies in bacteria have identified multiple roles for the machinery of <b>homologous</b> <b>recombination</b> at replication forks. Here, we review {{our understanding of the}} molecular pathways involving the <b>homologous</b> <b>recombination</b> machinery to support the robustness of DNA replication. In addition to its role in fork-recovery and in rebuilding a functional replication fork apparatus, <b>homologous</b> <b>recombination</b> may also act as a fork-protection mechanism. We discuss that some of the fork-escort functions of <b>homologous</b> <b>recombination</b> might be achieved by loading of the recombination machinery at inactivated forks without a need for a strand exchange step; as well as the consequence of such a model for the stability of eukaryotic genomes...|$|R
500|$|Decreased {{rates of}} <b>homologous</b> <b>recombination</b> cause inefficient DNA repair, {{which can also}} lead to cancer. [...] This is the case with BRCA1 and BRCA2, two similar tumor {{suppressor}} genes whose malfunctioning has been linked with considerably increased risk for breast and ovarian cancer. Cells missing BRCA1 and BRCA2 have a decreased rate of <b>homologous</b> <b>recombination</b> and increased sensitivity to ionizing radiation, suggesting that decreased <b>homologous</b> <b>recombination</b> leads to increased susceptibility to cancer. [...] Because the only known function of BRCA2 is to help initiate <b>homologous</b> <b>recombination,</b> researchers have speculated that more detailed knowledge of BRCA2's role in <b>homologous</b> <b>recombination</b> may be the key to understanding the causes of breast and ovarian cancer.|$|R

500|$|As {{part of the}} {{transformation}} process, the RecA protein interacts with entering single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) to form RecA/ssDNA nucleofilaments that scan the resident chromosome for regions of homology and bring the entering ssDNA to the corresponding region, where strand exchange and <b>homologous</b> <b>recombination</b> occur.

40|$|We {{tested the}} role of histone deacetylases (HDACs) in the <b>homologous</b> <b>recombination</b> process. A tissue-culture based homology-directed repair assay was used in which repair of a {{double-stranded}} break by <b>homologous</b> <b>recombination</b> results in gene conversion of an inactive GFP allele to an active GFP gene. Our rationale was that hyperacetylation caused by HDAC inhibitor treatment would increase chromatin accessibility to repair factors, thereby increasing <b>homologous</b> <b>recombination.</b> Contrary to expectation, treatment of cells with the inhibitors significantly reduced <b>homologous</b> <b>recombination</b> activity. Using RNA interference to deplete each HDAC, we found that depletion of either HDAC 9 or HDAC 10 specifically inhibited <b>homologous</b> <b>recombination.</b> By assaying for sensitivity of cells to the interstrand cross-linker mitomycin C, we found that treatment of cells with HDAC inhibitors or depletion of HDAC 9 or HDAC 10 resulted in increased sensitivity to mitomycin C.

40|$|A {{vast amount}} of data {{suggests}} that <b>homologous</b> <b>recombination</b> in mammalian cells is relatively rare as compared to random integration, imposing the need for sophisticated selection protocols to enrich for cells in which <b>homologous</b> <b>recombination</b> has occurred. We here show {{that one of the}} key factors in efficient <b>homologous</b> <b>recombination</b> is the use of isogenic DNA to prepare the targeting vectors. <b>Homologous</b> <b>recombination</b> at the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene (Rb) in embryonic stem cells derived from mouse strain 129 was 20 -fold more efficient with a 129 -derived targeting construct than with a BALB/c-derived construct. The two constructs were identical, except for a number of base sequence divergences between 129 and BALB/c DNA, including base-pair substitutions, small deletions/insertions, and a polymorphic CA repeat. Transfection with an isogenic DNA construct, containing 17 kilobases of homology, yielded a targeting frequency of 78 % (of a total of 20, 000 drug-resistant colonies), without the use of an enrichment protocol for <b>homologous</b> <b>recombination.</b> This result indicates that, also in mammalian cells, <b>homologous</b> <b>recombination</b> rather than random integration can be the predominant event...|$|R
50|$|P. patens is an {{excellent}} model in which to analyze repair of DNA damages in plants by the <b>homologous</b> <b>recombination</b> pathway. Failure to repair double-strand breaks and other DNA damages in somatic cells by <b>homologous</b> <b>recombination</b> can lead cell dysfunction or death, and when failure occurs during meiosis, it can cause loss of gametes. The genome sequence of P. patens has revealed the presence of numerous genes that encode proteins necessary for repair of DNA damages by <b>homologous</b> <b>recombination</b> and by other pathways. RpRAD51, a protein {{at the core of}} the <b>homologous</b> <b>recombination</b> repair reaction, is required to preserve genome integrity in P. patens. Loss of RpRAD51 causes marked hypersensitivity to the double-strand break-inducing agent bleomycin, indicating that <b>homologous</b> <b>recombination</b> is used for repair of somatic cell DNA damages. RpRAD51 is also essential for resistance to ionizing radiation.|$|R

40|$|Mitotic <b>homologous</b> <b>recombination</b> is a {{critical}} pathway for the repair of DNA double-strand breaks and broken replication forks. Although <b>homologous</b> <b>recombination</b> is generally error-free, recombination between misaligned sequences can lead to deleterious sequence rearrangements, and conditions that stimulate <b>homologous</b> <b>recombination</b> are {{associated with an increased}} risk of cancer. To study <b>homologous</b> <b>recombination</b> in vivo, we used Fluorescent Yellow Direct Repeat (FYDR) mice in which a <b>homologous</b> <b>recombination</b> event at a transgene yields a fluorescent cell. To study <b>homologous</b> <b>recombination</b> using FYDR mice, we developed one- and two-photon in situ imaging techniques that reveal both the frequency and the sizes of isolated recombinant cell clusters within intact pancreatic tissue. We then applied these tools to analyze the effects of cancer risk factors such as exposure, genetic predisposition and age on <b>homologous</b> <b>recombination</b> in vivo. To determine the effect of exposure to exogenous carcinogens on <b>homologous</b> <b>recombination,</b> FYDR mice were treated with two different chemotherapeutic agents, cisplatin and mitomycin-C. (cont.) Results show that exposure to these DNA damaging agents causes an induction of recombinant pancreatic cells in vivo, indicating that <b>homologous</b> <b>recombination</b> is an active repair pathway in adult pancreatic cells and that exposure to certain carcinogens stimulates recombinational repair. As a first step towards exploring the effect of genetic predisposition to genomic instability on <b>homologous</b> <b>recombination</b> in vivo, FYDR mice were crossed with mice carrying a defect in p 53, {{a critical}} tumor suppressor that is mutated in almost 50 % of all human tumors. Although loss of p 53 is known to promote genomic instability, results show that p 53 status does not significantly affect the spontaneous recombinant cell frequency in the pancreas in vivo or the rate of <b>homologous</b> <b>recombination</b> in cultured fibroblasts in vitro. Age is a risk factor for many types of cancers. Here we examined the effect of age on <b>homologous</b> <b>recombination</b> in two tissues of FYDR mice, pancreas and skin. In the pancreas, a dramatic accumulation of recombinant cells is seen with age, resulting from both de novo recombination events and clonal expansion of recombinant cells. In contrast, the skin shows no increase in recombinant cell frequency with age. (cont.) In vitro studies using primary fibroblasts indicate that the ability to undergo <b>homologous</b> <b>recombination</b> in response to endogenous and exogenous DNA damage does not significantly change with age, suggesting that these skin cells are able to undergo de novo <b>homologous</b> <b>recombination</b> events in aged mice. Thus, we propose that tissue-specific differences in the accumulation of recombinant cells with age result from differences in the ability of these cells to persist and clonally expand within the tissue. To further characterize the FYDR mice as a tool for studying <b>homologous</b> <b>recombination,</b> we exploited positive control FYDR-Recombined mice in which all cells carry the full-length coding sequence for enhanced yellow fluorescent protein. Studies show that expression of the FYDR transgene varies among mice, among tissues, and even among cells within a tissue. However, the variation in FYDR expression does not significantly change with age or exposure to exogenous carcinogens. Furthermore, positive control mice reveal that several tissues, in addition to the pancreas and skin, may be amenable for studying <b>homologous</b> <b>recombination</b> in the FYDR mice. (cont.) Thus, our studies demonstrate that FYDR mice combined with in situ imaging technology provide powerful tools to study the effects of cancer risk factors on <b>homologous</b> <b>recombination</b> in vivo. Ultimately, by applying these techniques to study additional cancer risk factors, we may better understand the relationship between DNA damage, <b>homologous</b> <b>recombination</b> and cancer. by Dominika M.

40|$|Many {{recent studies}} have {{demonstrated}} recruitment of chromatin-modifying enzymes to double-strand breaks. Instead, we wanted to examine chromatin modifications during the repair of these double-strand breaks. We show that <b>homologous</b> <b>recombination</b> triggers the acetylation of N-terminal lysines on histones H 3 and H 4 flanking a double-strand break, followed by deacetylation of H 3 and H 4. Consistent with a requirement for acetylation and deacetylation during <b>homologous</b> <b>recombination,</b> Saccharomyces cerevisiae with substitutions of the acetylatable lysines of histone H 4, deleted for the N-terminal tail of histone H 3 or H 4, deleted for the histone acetyltransferase GCN 5 gene or the histone deacetylase RPD 3 gene, shows inviability following induction of an HO lesion that is repaired primarily by <b>homologous</b> <b>recombination.</b> Furthermore, the histone acetyltransferases Gcn 5 and Esa 1 and the histone deacetylases Rpd 3, Sir 2, and Hst 1 are recruited to the HO lesion during homologous recombinational repair. We have also observed a distinct pattern of histone deacetylation at the donor locus during <b>homologous</b> <b>recombination.</b> Our results demonstrate that dynamic changes in histone acetylation accompany <b>homologous</b> <b>recombination</b> and {{that the ability to}} modulate histone acetylation is essential for viability following <b>homologous</b> <b>recombination...</b>|$|R
40|$|The studies {{presented}} in this thesis have been performed {{in order to improve}} our understanding of the molecular background of HSV- 1 DNA metabolism. Specifically, it attempts to address the role of <b>homologous</b> <b>recombination</b> in the viral life cycle and to identify host enzymes that take part in viral DNA metabolism. We investigated the effects of ICRF- 193, an inhibitor of topoisomerase II, on the replication of HSV- 1. Then we examined mechanisms of recombination in cells infected with HSV- 1 to establish the mechanism of circularization of HSV- 1 genome. Finally, we investigated the coupling between HSV- 1 DNA replication and <b>homologous</b> <b>recombination</b> as well as requirements for cellular gene products in <b>homologous</b> <b>recombination.</b> Plasmids containing HSV- 1 oriS were constructed as the substrates for viral replication and recombination. Uninfected and HSV- 1 infected cells with different genetic backgrounds were used. Transient replication assays were utilized to detect virus-dependent DNA replication and recombination. Furthermore, two other assays were developed for detecting homologous recombination: recombination-dependent expression of luciferase and recombination between HSV- 1 tsS and tsK strains. To study the enzymatic background of <b>homologous</b> <b>recombination</b> HSV- 1 amplicons were used to express recombination genes in human cells. We found that HSV- 1 replication was specifically inhibited by ICRF- 193 early in infection suggesting that topoisomerase II decatenates early replication intermediates. We have seen that linear DNA provided with directly repeated HSV- 1 a sequences at the ends replicated as efficiently as circular DNA. The results indicate that linear HSV- 1 DNA might be circularized by a sequences-mediated <b>homologous</b> <b>recombination</b> before replication. The reaction was not dependent on XPF/ERCC 4 protein, suggesting that it does not proceed by a single strand-annealing pathway. <b>Homologous</b> <b>recombination</b> occurred also in absence of HSV- 1 dependent DNA replication and viral gene products, which implies that DNA replication and <b>homologous</b> <b>recombination</b> may be coordinated but mechanistically independent events. We also demonstrated that <b>homologous</b> <b>recombination</b> was cell type dependent. Linear DNA with non-homologous ends induced p 53 dependent apoptosis and failed to recombine in Balb/c 3 T 3 cells. It appears that <b>homologous</b> <b>recombination</b> is controlled by p 53. Furthermore, <b>homologous</b> <b>recombination</b> may protect HSV- 1 -infected cells from initiating apoptosis and stimulate viral DNA replication. Finally, <b>homologous</b> <b>recombination</b> of replicating HSV- 1 genomes was profoundly reduced by overexpression of a non-functional RAD 51 in human primary fibroblasts. Our results suggest that RAD 51 dependent <b>homologous</b> <b>recombination</b> is an important, but not necessarily exclusive, mechanism for promoting recombination of replicating HSV- 1 DNA...|$|R
40|$|Mammalian RAD 51 protein plays {{essential}} {{roles in}} DNA <b>homologous</b> <b>recombination,</b> DNA repair and cell proliferation. RAD 51 activities are regulated by its associated proteins. It was previously {{reported that a}} ubiquitin-like protein, UBL 1, associates with RAD 51 in the yeast two-hybrid system. One function of UBL 1 is to covalently conjugate with target proteins and thus modify their function. In the present study we found that non-conjugated UBL 1 forms a complex with RAD 51 and RAD 52 proteins in human cells. Overexpression of UBL 1 down-regulates DNA double-strand break-induced <b>homologous</b> <b>recombination</b> in CHO cells and reduces cellular resistance to ionizing radiation in HT 1080 cells. With or without overexpressed UBL 1, most <b>homologous</b> <b>recombination</b> products arise by gene conversion. However, overexpression of UBL 1 reduces the fraction of bidirectional gene conversion tracts. Overexpression of a mutant UBL 1 that is incapable of being conjugated retains the ability to inhibit <b>homologous</b> <b>recombination.</b> These results suggest a regulatory role for UBL 1 in <b>homologous</b> <b>recombination...</b>|$|R

30|$|Another {{obstacle}} for conditional mutant strain {{construction in}} Mycobacteria is the {{low rate of}} <b>homologous</b> <b>recombination.</b> Gordhan and Parish described three methods to pretreat DNA to enhance the <b>homologous</b> <b>recombination</b> (Gordhan and Parish 2001). Single-stranded phagemid DNA can abolish unwanted recombination {{but the problem is}} the generation of sufficient amount of single-stranded DNA especially for the GC rich Mtb genome. UV pretreated DNA can raise the <b>homologous</b> <b>recombination</b> events, however, additional point mutations are inevitable. Alkali-denaturation will lead to no additional mutations but lower the <b>homologous</b> <b>recombination</b> events. Lineated double-stranded DNA may also cause higher <b>homologous</b> <b>recombination</b> probability, but lineated DNA is not stable in bacteria. Plasmid pJV 53, an Escherichia–Mycobacteria shuttle plasmid, can generate Che 9 c mycobacteria phage gp 60 and gp 61 proteins, which are homologous to recombinant protein RecE and RecT respectively. These recombinant proteins promote foreign genes to recombine with homologous genes in Mycobacteria with high efficiency (van Kessel and Hatfull 2007). In this study, before the lineated DNA was introduced into Mtb, plasmid pVJ 53 was therefore electroporated into Mtb to improve <b>homologous</b> <b>recombination.</b> Only the double cross-over mutants could form colonies on the 7 H 10 agar media, the single cross-over mutants were not viable.|$|R
40|$|Although <b>homologous</b> <b>recombination</b> {{is a major}} {{mechanism}} for DNA rearrangement in most living organisms, it {{has been difficult to}} detect in slowly growing mycobacteria by a classical suicide vector approach. Among the possible reasons for this are the low levels of transformation efficiency, the relatively high levels of illegitimate recombination, and the peculiar nature of the recA gene in slowly growing mycobacteria. In this report, we present an efficient <b>homologous</b> <b>recombination</b> system for these organisms based on the use of replicative plasmids which facilitates the detection of rare recombination events, because the proportions of recombined molecules increase over time. Intraplasmid <b>homologous</b> <b>recombination</b> in Mycobacterium smegmatis and Mycobacterium bovis BCG was easily selected by the reconstitution of an interrupted kanamycin resistance gene. Chromosomal integration via <b>homologous</b> <b>recombination</b> was selected by the expression of the kanamycin resistance gene under the control of a chromosomal promoter that was not present in the plasmid before recombination. This technique was termed STORE (for selection technique of recombination events). All the clones selected by STORE had undergone <b>homologous</b> <b>recombination,</b> as evidenced by PCR analyses of the kanamycin-resistant clones. This technique should be applicable to all organisms for which <b>homologous</b> <b>recombination</b> has been difficult to achieve, provided the gene of interest is expressed...|$|R
40|$|<b>Homologous</b> <b>recombination</b> {{functions}} universally in {{the maintenance}} of genome stability through the repair of DNA breaks and in ensuring the completion of replication. In some organisms, <b>homologous</b> <b>recombination</b> can perform more specific functions. One {{example of this is}} in antigenic variation, a widely conserved mechanism for the evasion of host immunity. Trypanosoma brucei, the causative agent of sleeping sickness in Africa, undergoes antigenic variation by periodic changes in its variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) coat. VSG switches involve the activation of VSG genes, from an enormous silent archive, by recombination into specialized expression sites. These reactions involve <b>homologous</b> <b>recombination,</b> though they are characterized by an unusually high rate of switching and by atypical substrate requirements. Here, we have examined the substrate parameters of T. brucei <b>homologous</b> <b>recombination.</b> We show, first, that the reaction is strictly dependent on substrate length and that it is impeded by base mismatches, features shared by <b>homologous</b> <b>recombination</b> in all organisms characterized.
