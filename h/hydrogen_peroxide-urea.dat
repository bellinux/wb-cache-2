50|$|The {{peroxide}} anion is {{a stronger}} nucleophile than hydroxide and displaces hydroxyl from oxyanions e.g. forming perborates and percarbonates. Sodium perborate and sodium percarbonate are important consumer and industrial bleaching agents; they stabilize hydrogen peroxide and limit side reactions (e.g. reduction and decomposition note below). The peroxide anion forms an adduct with urea, <b>hydrogen</b> <b>peroxide-urea.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Hydrogen</b> <b>peroxide-urea</b> is a readily water-soluble, odorless, {{crystalline}} solid, {{which is}} available as white powder or colorless needles or platelets. Upon dissolving in various solvents, the 1:1 complex dissociates back to urea and hydrogen peroxide. So just like hydrogen peroxide, the (erroneously) so-called adduct is an oxidizer but the release at room temperature {{in the presence of}} catalysts proceeds in a controlled manner, thus the compound is suitable as a safe substitute for the unstable aqueous solution of hydrogen peroxide. Because of the tendency for thermal decomposition, which accelerates at temperatures above 82 °C, it should not be heated above 60 °C, particularly in pure form.|$|E
40|$|At the {{molar ratio}} of 1 : 1. 25 and the {{reaction}} temperature of 45 °C, Dipyrithion was obtained through reacting 2 -pyridinethiol-N-oxide with 30 % <b>hydrogen</b> <b>peroxide-urea</b> adduct for 1. 75 h. The yield and purity were 91. 6 % and 99. 6 % respectively. The structures were characterized by elementary analysis, IR and 1 H NMR...|$|E
