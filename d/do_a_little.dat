She hosted 56 state dinners over eight years. She remarked that hosting the dinners is [...] "the easiest thing in the world. You don't have to do anything. Just {{have a good time}} and <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> business. And that's the way Washington works." [...] The White House residence staff found Reagan demanding to work for during the preparation for the state dinners, with the First Lady overseeing every aspect of meal presentations, and sometimes requesting one dessert after another be prepared, before finally settling on one she approved of.|$|E
500|$|Cody {{stated that}} when writing the script, she was [...] "simultaneously {{trying to pay}} tribute to some of the {{conventions}} that we've already seen in horror, yet, at the same time, kind of turn them on their ear". One of her influences from the 1980s horror genre was the film The Lost Boys. She wanted to [...] "honor that, and at the same time, [...] had never really seen this particular subgenre done with girls and [...] tried to <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> of both". Despite this, she said she had noticed that [...] "the last survivor standing in the typical horror film is a woman" [...] and that because of this she feels [...] "horror has always had kind of a feminist angle to it in a weird way and, at the same time, it's kind of delightfully exploitative". Jennifer's Body could play on both of these aspects.|$|E

[...] According to Broderick, Ferris's singing [...] "Danke Schoen" [...] in the shower was his idea. [...] "Although it's only because of the brilliance of John's deciding that I should sing [...] "Danke Schoen" [...] on the float in the parade. I had never heard the song before. I was learning it for the parade scene. So we're doing the shower scene and I thought, 'Well, I can <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> rehearsal.' And I did something with my hair to make that Mohawk. And you know what good directors do: they say, 'Stop! Wait till we roll.' And John put that stuff in." ...|$|E

Ben then starts to call Will [...] "Dewey" [...] (just as other students did at his old school), which stands for [...] "DWI" [...] ("Driving While Intoxicated"). Will detests this nickname because it reminds him of his father, whom he is ashamed of. What is more, Charlotte's father dies and she decides to quit the band. As she explains to Will, her father hated how she acted when she was with her ex-boyfriend, so after he got sick, she decided to change her image and be nicer to [...] "people like [...] ", meaning outcasts, hoping that this good behavior would cause her dad to get well. The band members are hurt by this discovery, as it means she did not genuinely like them, but they decide to go on nonetheless, with Sa5m taking over as lead singer.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to funding research into various extended range munitions, the navy {{is also working}} on developing railguns for use with the fleet {{at some point in}} the future. The United States Naval Surface Warfare Center Dahlgren Division demonstrated an 8 MJ rail gun firing 3.2 kilogram (slightly more than 7 pounds) projectiles in October 2006 as a prototype of a 64 MJ weapon to be deployed aboard navy warships. The main problem the navy has had with implementing a railgun cannon system is that the guns wear out due to the immense heat produced by firing. Such weapons are expected to be powerful enough to <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more damage than a BGM-109 Tomahawk missile at a fraction of the projectile cost. Since then, BAE Systems has delivered a 32 MJ prototype to the Navy. On January 31, 2008, the US Navy tested a magnetic railgun; it fired a shell at 2520m/s using 10.64 megajoules of energy. Its expected performance is over 5800m/s muzzle velocity, accurate enough to hit a 5-meter target from [...] away while shooting at 10 shots per minute. It is expected to be ready between 2020 and 2025.|$|E

Familiar with singers Cheryl Freeman, Lillias White, Vaneese Y. Thomas, LaChanze and Roz Ryan's Broadway work, Egan felt intimated by their powerful voices and riffing abilities. Egan recalled, [...] "Alan would say, 'Okay Lillias (White), just do a riff over there and LaChanze, you <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> something over here and Susan, just at the end, get from this note to this note and just do a riff.' I raise my hand and I'm like, 'Umm, can you plunk {{it out on the}} piano?' He looks at me like, 'Are you kidding?'" [...] While it took Egan half an hour to solidify only one of her riffs, the other singers recorded multiple takes of theirs within that same time; Egan was greatly humbled by the experience. On the film's soundtrack, only Egan and Freeman are credited as vocalists on the track. Menken also produced the song. Danny Troob arranged the song while Michael Kosarin conducted the orchestration.|$|E

500|$|The Smith family {{initially}} {{lived on}} a small farm in Sewickley, Pennsylvania but moved in 1872 to Allegheny City when George Smith was 10 years old. The Smiths eventually settled {{in the neighborhood of}} Pleasant Valley, which was located across the Ohio River from Pittsburgh in the present day city neighborhood of California-Kirkbride. George Smith's father died within a year (in late 1872 or 1873), which created financial hardships for his mother and sisters and resulted in George going to work at the age of 12 at the local cork cutting factory (possibly Armstrong Cork Co.) for $5 per week. [...] Smith was not happy with this occupation, once remarking on the banality of the profession later in life: [...] " [...] thought [...] could <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> better than cutting corks, inasmuch as [...] knew how to divide six by two." [...] Smith set aside money from his weekly pay (after giving the majority to his mother) to purchase and train gamecocks, hiding the fowl from his devout Roman Catholic mother and sisters who greatly disapproved of gambling. He also bet on the outcomes of National League baseball games in Pittsburgh pool halls and would attribute his often sizable winnings to pay raises at the cork factory.|$|E

[...] Mike Wass of Idolator, while reviewing Reclassified, said that, [...] "Of the trio of fuck-you anthems, 'Iggy SZN' is the most light-hearted and upbeat.

O'Hara stated that Parra [...] "saved me from the darkness of an abusive marriage and brought me back into the warm light of life again. Leaving him {{was one of the most}} painful things I have ever had to do." [...] As her relationship with Parra progressed, she began to learn Spanish and even enrolled her daughter in a Mexican school. She moved in 1953 to a smaller property at 10677 Somma Way in Bel Air, amid frequent visits to Mexico City, where she and Parra were very well-known celebrities. She hired a detective to follow Parra in Mexico and found that he was being fully honest about the relationship with his ex-wife and that she could trust him. John Ford intensely disliked Parra, and it affected her relationship with Ford in the 1950s as he often interfered in her affairs and frowned upon the demise of her marriage to Price, being a devout Catholic like O'Hara. Price also continued to harass O'Hara for dating Parra and filed a case against her on 20 June 1955, seeking custody of Bronwyn and accusing her of immorality. O'Hara filed a countersuit, charging him with contempt of court for refusing to pay $50 a month in child support and a $7 a month alimony. During the publicity stage of The Long Gray Line in 1955, Ford insulted O'Hara and her brother Charles when he remarked to Charles, [...] "if that whore sister of yours can pull herself away from that Mexican long enough to <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> publicity for us, the film might have a chance at some decent returns".|$|E

So, in other words, somebody takes on a persona that completely sounds like he's someone else and acts like he's someone else but he's really, you know, as you see me. That added a dimension to the larger-than-life aspect of the characterâ€¦ I'm playing somebody very close to my own origins. But a completely made-up personaâ€¦ which makes him even more full of shit. And I think that's the charm of the guyâ€”that he's kind of elusive, hard to pin down." [...] Pacific Rim marks Perlman's fifth appearance in a del Toro film. The director stated: [...] "I think the moment you have a guy that is called Hannibal Chau and Ron shows up, and he's from Brooklyn and he's been selling black market organs, you know the whole storyâ€¦ That's all I need to know. If it's any other actor, there's a lot more explaining to do. But when Ron comes in with that look, {{you can make your own}} story and it'll be as compelling as anything I can invent.
