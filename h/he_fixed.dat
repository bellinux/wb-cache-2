5|$|At {{this time}} many Christians {{performed}} daring feats to rescue captives from Seringapatnam {{and take them}} to places of safety. A captive named Domingo Pinto (brother of Salvador Pinto, who rose to high rank in the services of Tipu), was particularly proficient in this. He rescued many people and took them secretly to Mangalore or Tellicherry. He proposed that those anxious to regain their liberty could be rescued on payment to him of a certain sum of money. <b>He</b> <b>fixed</b> the rescue price per captive at 8 hoons (Rs. 32) for a male, and 4 hoons (Rs. 16) for a female.|$|E
5|$|Two years later, in 1991, Withers {{bought a}} {{derelict}} rowhouse {{from the city}} of Philadelphia for $1 and parted ways with McKenna. This would become his hermitage. <b>He</b> <b>fixed</b> the building, which lacked doors, windows, or a working roof and then went on to build furniture for it by himself. After the 1983 revision of Canon 603, the option of being a consecrated hermit while independent of the system of religious orders had been permitted. In 1995, Withers attempted to be consecrated by the Archdiocese of Philadelphia but was rejected. In 2001, Withers was finally approved and consecrated as a hermit by Cardinal Anthony Bevilacqua and took his public vows. Withers was the first hermit to be consecrated by the Archdiocese.|$|E
5|$|Diocletian {{divided the}} empire into four regions, each {{ruled by a}} {{separate}} emperor, the Tetrarchy. Confident that <b>he</b> <b>fixed</b> the disorders that were plaguing Rome, he abdicated along with his co-emperor, and the Tetrarchy soon collapsed. Order was eventually restored by Constantine the Great, who became the first emperor to convert to Christianity, and who established Constantinople as the new capital of the eastern empire. During the decades of the Constantinian and Valentinian dynasties, the empire was divided along an east–west axis, with dual power centres in Constantinople and Rome. The reign of Julian, who attempted to restore Classical Roman and Hellenistic religion, only briefly interrupted the succession of Christian emperors. Theodosius I, the last emperor to rule over both East and West, died in 395 AD after making Christianity the official religion of the empire.|$|E

5|$|Earp was {{a lifelong}} gambler {{and was always}} looking for a quick way to make money. After leaving Tombstone, Earp went to San Francisco, where he reunited with Josephine Earp. She became his common-law wife. They joined a gold rush to Eagle City, Idaho, where they owned mining {{interests}} and a saloon. They left there to race horses and open a saloon during a real estate boom in San Diego, California. Back in San Francisco, Wyatt raced horses again, but his reputation suffered irreparably when he refereed the Fitzsimmons–Sharkey boxing match and called a foul that led many to believe that <b>he</b> <b>fixed</b> the fight. They moved briefly to Yuma, Arizona, before joining the Nome Gold Rush in 1899. In partnership with Charlie Hoxie, they opened a two-story saloon called the Dexter and made an estimated $80,000 (about $2 million in 2017 dollars). Returning to the lower 48, they opened another saloon in Tonopah, Nevada, the site of a new gold find. Around 1911, Earp began working several mining claims in Vidal, California, retiring in the hot summers with Josephine to Los Angeles. Earp made friends among early Western actors in Hollywood and tried to get his story told. He was portrayed in film only once before he died, and very briefly, in the 1923 film Wild Bill Hickok.|$|E

25|$|Despite taking pole {{position}} {{in the first two}} rounds, mechanical problems halted his chances of victory. He spun numerous times in South Africa, and at Monaco, his engine blew up at the start, and the win went to his teammate Denny Hulme. At the Dutch Grand Prix, he scored his first podium of the season, with second place, behind Scotsman Jim Clark. He retired in the Belgian Grand Prix with another blown engine. <b>He</b> <b>fixed</b> this by winning the French Grand Prix at the Bugatti Circuit in Le Mans. He came fourth at the British Grand Prix, behind Chris Amon, his teammate Hulme, and Clark. At the German Grand Prix, he had a huge battle with Amon, and Brabham eventually finished ahead of the New Zealander, by only half a second. Hulme was the winner. At the first ever Canadian Grand Prix at Mosport Park, he took a huge win, ahead of Hulme, in cold and rainy conditions. At the Italian Grand Prix at Monza, Brabham had to finish second, only a few car lengths behind John Surtees, who took his last GP win. Hulme retired from the race, cutting the gap to 3 points between the two, as the circus headed for the United States, at Watkins Glen for the United States Grand Prix. Brabham outqualified his teammate, and finished fifth in the race, and with Hulme on the podium, this meant the championship chances were looking slim for Black Jack, as the circus went to Mexico for the championship deciding and final race of the season. Once again, Black Jack outqualified his teammate, and needed to win, with Hulme fifth or lower. But Jim Clark was simply too fast during the whole weekend, and dominated the race from pole to win, with Brabham finishing over 1 minute and 25 seconds behind. Hulme finished third, and so the New Zealander won the championship, while Brabham settled for second place. The team secured the Constructors' Championship, with 67 total points scored, and 23 points ahead of Lotus which scored a total of 44 points.|$|E
500|$|His nickname, [...] "One Arm" [...] Daily, is a {{reference}} to his left arm; {{he had lost his}} left hand to a gun accident earlier in his life. [...] To compensate for this injury, <b>he</b> <b>fixed</b> a special pad over the affected area and caught the baseball by trapping it between the pad and his right hand. Sometimes, after long games of having to catch baseballs this way, his stump would become sensitive – so sensitive in fact, that he once punched his catcher for not heeding his warning to throw the balls back to him softer.|$|E
500|$|The use {{of motion}} capture {{to control the}} {{position}} and orientation of a virtual camera enables the operator to intuitively move and aim the virtual camera by simply walking about and turning the virtual camera rig. [...] A virtual camera rig consists of a portable monitor or tablet device, motion sensors, optional support framework, and optional joystick or button controls that are commonly used to start or stop recording and adjust lens properties. [...] In 1992, Michael McKenna of MIT's Media Lab demonstrated the earliest documented virtual camera rig when <b>he</b> <b>fixed</b> a Polhemus magnetic motion sensor and a 3.2 inch portable LCD TV to a wooden ruler. [...] The Walkthrough Project at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill produced a number of physical input devices for virtual camera view control including dual three-axis joysticks and a billiard-ball shaped prop known as the UNC Eyeball that featured an embedded six-degree of freedom motion tracker and a digital button.|$|E

500|$|With Robey's {{popularity}} came an {{eagerness to}} differentiate {{himself from his}} music hall rivals, and so he devised a signature costume when appearing as himself: an oversized black coat fastened {{from the neck down}} with large, wooden buttons; black, unkempt, baggy trousers and a partially bald wig with black, whispery strands of unbrushed, dirty-looking hair that poked below a large, dishevelled top-hat. He applied thick white face paint and exaggerated the redness on his cheeks and nose with bright red make-up; his eye line and eyebrows were also enhanced with thick, black greasepaint. He held a short, misshaped, wooden walking stick, which was curved at the top. Robey later used the costume for his character, The Prime Minister of Mirth. The outfit helped Robey become instantly recognisable on the London music hall circuit. He next made a start at building his repertoire and bought the rights to comic songs and monologues by several well-established music hall writers, including Sax Rohmer and Bennett Scott. For his routines, Robey developed a characteristic delivery described by Cotes as [...] "a kind of machine-gun staccato rattle through each polysyllabic line, ending abruptly, and holding the pause while <b>he</b> <b>fixed</b> his audience with his basilisk stare." ...|$|E
500|$|Charles Ellet and {{his team}} tied a heavier line to the kite string and pulled the joined lines across. [...] They pulled {{successive}} heavier and stronger lines across until the final bridge cable— thick—was hanging across the gorge. [...] The cable was suspended between two wooden towers [...] tall, and it was attached to an iron basket. Ellet planned to use this system as a basket ferry to shuttle workers and materials across the gorge, saving time that {{would otherwise have been}} spent on land and ferry travel. [...] Through media coverage and word-of-mouth, many people knew of Ellet's efforts and flocked to the site to watch the construction. [...] On March 13, 1848, the system was completed, and the team planned to test it by pulling the empty basket across. [...] They hit a snag when the basket kept getting stuck halfway and could not move ahead. [...] Pulling back the basket, Ellet decided to assure the watching crowd that the system was workable. [...] He stepped into the basket, and it moved towards the opposite shore. [...] When Ellet reached the problematic spot, he spotted the issue; the basket's rollers could not pass over a portion of the cable that had been accidentally flattened during the construction. [...] <b>He</b> <b>fixed</b> the problem and proceeded to cross to the Canadian side and back, becoming the first person to cross the gorge. [...] Although the bridge companies had prohibited Ellet from collecting tolls, he charged each person $1.00 for the chance to [...] "observe first hand the engineering wonder of bridging the Niagara". [...] On some days, the basket ferry conveyed up to 125 people across the gorge.|$|E
500|$|On December 31, 1999, Dick Clark {{is celebrating}} New Year's Rockin' Eve in Springfield. Homer, the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant's Y2K {{compliance}} officer, declares that <b>he</b> <b>fixed</b> {{all the possible}} Y2K problems at the plant, including the computers. Unfortunately, Homer forgot to fix his own computer, {{and in the process}} sends a virus across the world. Chaos ensues, and widespread looting begins. Krusty's malfunctioning pacemaker apparently kills him in front of the family. Bart tearfully mourns his hero, but he perks up, after finding a note. The letter in Krusty's pocket states that a rocket (codenamed Exodus) is being populated with humanity's [...] "best and brightest", and will be launched in order to preserve human civilization on Mars. When they reach the shuttle, Homer fails to bluff his way on board by claiming to be the famous pianist from the film Shine but the armed guard recognizes Lisa as the ship's designated proofreader. Lisa is only able to take one parent with her, and quickly chooses Marge. Homer and Bart find a second, unguarded rocket and board just before it launches. They quickly notice that the spaceliner is filled with such notoriously obnoxious and mediocre celebrities as radio psychologist Dr. Laura, film director Spike Lee, skating champion Tonya Harding, former vice president Dan Quayle, grunge rock singer Courtney Love, politician Ross Perot, civil rights activist Al Sharpton, actor Tom Arnold, MTV VJ Pauly Shore, and actress/talk show host Rosie O'Donnell. Although the craft is headed directly for the sun, Homer and Bart eject themselves from the spacecraft and die of explosive decompression, to their relief.|$|E

[...] That meant a speed of 350 kilometres an hour – although the world's fastest train at that time, the French TGV, only travelled at 270km/h. (Later he was to set his sights on a symbolic speed, just as 60 miles per hour had been the target in his youth: 360 kilometres an hour, because it represented 100 metres per second.) ...|$|E

2500|$|During {{the winter}} of 1815–16 Peacock was {{regularly}} walking over to visit Shelley at Bishopgate. There he met Thomas Jefferson Hogg, and [...] "the winter was a mere Atticism. Our studies were exclusively Greek". In 1816 Shelley went abroad, and Peacock {{appears to have been}} entrusted with the task of finding the Shelleys a new residence. <b>He</b> <b>fixed</b> them near his own home at Great Marlow. Peacock received a pension from Shelley for a time, and was put into requisition to keep off wholly unauthorised intruders upon Shelley's hospitable household. Peacock was consulted about alterations in Shelley's Laon and Cythna, and Peacock's enthusiasm for Greek poetry probably had some influence on Shelley's work. Shelley's influence upon Peacock may be traced in the latter's poem of Rhododaphne, or the Thessalian Spell, published in 1818 and Shelley wrote a eulogistic review of it. [...] Peacock also wrote at this time the satirical novels Melincourt published in 1817 and Nightmare Abbey [...] published in 1818. Shelley made his final departure for Italy and the friends' agreement for mutual correspondence produced Shelley's magnificent descriptive letters from Italy, which otherwise might never have been written.|$|E
