40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis was to {{determine}} how the quality of coordinates of the ground control points affects the volume calculation of construction excavation voids calculated from a point cloud. The point cloud was generated based on the photographs taken by an unmanned drone. The ground control points were initially measured using the faster but less accurate GNSS RTK method. Subsequently, we then measured the ground control points using a more precise classical geodetic measurement. The accuracy of the results of these measurements was then evaluated according to the ISO standard. The coordinates of the ground control points were determined by levelling the horizontal and vertical geodetic network. The volume calculation of the construction <b>excavation</b> <b>void</b> was carried out using the 3 D Survey software, where the coordinates of the ground control points were defined with various methods of measurement. The volume measurement results obtained were then compared. The results showed the difference in volume amounting to less than 1 percent, proving the GNSS RTK method is accurate enough to be effectively used for georeferencing of a point cloud in order to accurately measure volume...|$|E

40|$|Operated by lignite mine “Adams” coal {{deposits}} {{are located}} in the upland area of ​​the Turkish, belonging to the South Plains macro-region of Wielkopolska. A feature of this region are not only low rainfall, but also the lack of water reservoirs and large rivers. Mining activity has caused major changes in the hydrological network, not just for liquidation, postpone or reconstruction of riverbeds, but also the creation of new objects that collect water. These include settling the waters “dirty”, as well as reservoirs formed in <b>excavation</b> <b>voids</b> as part of a water reclamation. After the end of coal mining operation of these facilities is dependent on hydrology and hydraulic engineering conditions. This problem will be shown on the example of dirty water clarifier and final excavation undergoing water reclamation opencast mining areas Władysławów. Outcrop ended its activities in 2013. The final excavation is no outflow basin with a capacity of 42 million m 3, located within the river basin Topiec constituting the left-hand tributary of the Warta...|$|R
40|$|After the Aznalcóllar and Baia Mare {{disasters}} {{the regulation}} of the envi-ronmental impacts from the extractive industries has become a focus of at-tention for European environmental policy. The EC Framework 5 project ERMITE has specifically supported the development of European policies on the management {{of water in the}} mining sector. One component of the project was the review of mine water policies in six case study countries in Europe and their links with European policy. This paper presents a sum-mary of the findings of the UK case study. A key element of the project was the establishment a National Stakeholder Group with regulators, in-dustry, consultants and representatives of civil society. Four main open is-sues for mine water management in the UK were identified: closure of coal mines and large coalfields, abandoned metal mines, spoil heaps and im-provement of working mines and quarries. From the analysis of the UK position on the consultations for the proposed Directive on waste from the extractive industries three critical questions are discussed: water pollution from <b>excavation</b> <b>voids,</b> establishment of programmes of abandoned site remediation and inclusion of all structures for stability and water pollution purposes. Finally, based on the conclusions of the study the UK ERMITE team proposes a set of seven specific recommendations for mine water management in the UK...|$|R
