2500|$|On June 29, [...] "Now, {{about the}} issue of host nation expenditures. When <b>I</b> <b>explained</b> <b>to</b> Secretary Brown that {{although}} {{we may not be able}} to promise anything specific in terms of numbers yet, our agency will, from a sympathetic position, put effort into presenting a more detailed view on the issue within the scope of SOFA prior to his visit to Japan. He was very pleased and no further request was made from the American side." ...|$|E
2500|$|After I {{had been}} {{studying}} with him for two years, Schoenberg said, [...] "In order to write music, {{you must have a}} feeling for harmony." [...] <b>I</b> <b>explained</b> <b>to</b> him that I had no feeling for harmony. He then said that I would always encounter an obstacle, that it would be as though I came to a wall through which I could not pass. I said, 'In that case I will devote my life to beating my head against that wall.' [...] " ...|$|E

2500|$|... "Imitation" [...] was Darnell's {{response}} {{to people who}} were constantly telling him about new British bands they felt were ripping off Kid Creole's music, and also a riposte to ZE label boss Michael Zilkha who had told him to write something less obviously Latin-sounding and [...] "more funky": [...] "As <b>I</b> <b>explained</b> <b>to</b> Zilkha later I'd been inspired by funk, just like I'd been inspired by salsa, but you don't find me writing pure cha-cha's or pure reggae because why should I do that?... I'd rather take pride in knowing I've created a fusion of those worlds... My motto has been 'Emulation not imitation is the healthy way to go'." ...|$|E
2500|$|As {{with all}} emotions, saudade {{has been an}} {{inspiration}} for many songs and compositions. [...] "Sodade" [...] (saudade in Cape Verdean Creole) is {{the title of the}} Cape Verde singer Cesária Évora's most famous song. Étienne Daho, a French singer, also produced a song of the same name. The Good Son, a 1990 album by Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, was heavily informed by Cave's mental state at the time, which he has described as saudade. He told journalist Chris Bohn: [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>explained</b> <b>to</b> someone that what I wanted to write about was the memory of things that I thought were lost for me, I was told that the Portuguese word for this feeling was saudade. It's not nostalgia but something sadder." ...|$|E
2500|$|Over {{the next}} two years at Dargomyzhsky's, Mussorgsky met several figures of {{importance}} in Russia's cultural life, among them Stasov, César Cui (a fellow officer), and Mily Balakirev. Balakirev had an especially strong impact. Within days he took it upon himself to help shape Mussorgsky's fate as a composer. He recalled to Stasov, [...] "Because I am not a theorist, I could not teach him harmony (as, for instance Rimsky-Korsakov now teaches it) ... <b>I</b> <b>explained</b> <b>to</b> him the form of compositions, and to do this we played through both Beethoven symphonies [...] and much else (Schumann, Schubert, Glinka, and others), analyzing the form." [...] Up to this point Mussorgsky had known nothing but piano music; his knowledge of more radical recent music was virtually non-existent. Balakirev started filling these gaps in Mussorgsky's knowledge.|$|E

2500|$|The writers {{decided the}} plot of the game would begin shortly after the opening of the film, with Deckard having already been {{assigned}} to track down Roy Batty and the other replicants. The game's plot was imagined {{in such a way that}} the player would occasionally hear about Deckard, but would never meet him. For example, when visiting the Tyrell building, Rachael mentions that she has already spoken to another Blade Runner, and Tyrell tells McCoy, [...] "as <b>I</b> <b>explained</b> <b>to</b> Mr. Deckard earlier, I've given the Nexus 6 a past." [...] Another example is a photograph taken in Animoid Row, which shows Deckard in the background, and prompts McCoy to exclaim [...] "He looks familiar." [...] Additionally, while searching Leon's room in the Yukon hotel, McCoy discovers Det. Holden's badge, and Lt. Guzza questions how Deckard missed it, going on to say, [...] "Deckard, he feels too much, ya' know?" [...] The developers were also keen to include locations from the film, such as the Bradbury Building, the Tyrell Corporation Pyramid, and the L.A.P.D.'s cylindrical skyscraper. They also enlisted many of the actors from the film to make cameos in the game; Sean Young as Rachael, Brion James as Leon, James Hong as Hannibal Chew, Joe Turkel as Dr. Eldon Tyrell, and William Sanderson as J.F. Sebastian.|$|E
2500|$|Having {{spent his}} early years {{in front of the}} cameras on Leave it to Beaver as [...] "Gilbert Bates" [...] (56 episodes), Talbot {{abandoned}} acting for a career as a journalist. In an article in Salon.com he looked back with a sense of humor about his past role. [...] "In the interests of historical accuracy I should say that, yes, Gilbert was a troublemaker and an occasional liar, but my character was certainly no Eddie Haskell – that leering teenage hypocrite who spoke unctuously to parents ('Well, hello Mrs. Cleaver, and how is young Theodore today?') and venomously to the Beav ('Hey, squirt, take a powder before I squash you like a bug')."! [...] "I have spent my adult life trying to conceal my Leave it to Beaver past or correcting the historical record. Either way the series has become inescapable. When I was a kid, I loved acting; in fact, I badgered my father and mother until they allowed me to work. But how could I have known as an innocent 9-year-old that I was taking part in a television program that would live on for 40 years as an icon for baby boomers? In the early '80s, I turned down an offer to revive my role as Gilbert in a dreadful Beaver reunion series. [...] "I'm trying to establish myself as a documentary filmmaker and an investigative reporter," [...] <b>I</b> <b>explained</b> <b>to</b> the producers. [...] "I can't go back to being Gilbert!" ...|$|E

60|$|But, as <b>I</b> <b>explain</b> <b>to</b> them, {{it is the}} law of {{literature}} never to write except about what you really know. I want to mix with the aristocracy, study them, understand them; so that I may earn my living in the only way a literary man nowadays can earn his living, namely, by writing about the upper circles.|$|R
