Resources available to sustain Malta were reduced when Japan declared war in December 1941 and conducted the Indian Ocean raid in April, 1942. Malta was neutralised as an offensive base against Italian convoys by the attacks of the Regia Aeronautica and the Luftwaffe in early 1942. Several warships were sunk in Valletta harbour and others were withdrawn to Gibraltar and Egypt.

A German national, Waldemar Maximilian Nestor, was the first Roman Catholic priest killed in World War II in Yugoslavia. In early October 1942 {{in the village of}} Gata near Split, an {{estimated}} one hundred people were killed and many homes burnt purportedly as reprisal for the destruction of some roads in the area and carried out on the Italians' account. In that same October, formations under the command of Petar Baćović and Dobroslav Jevđević, who were participating in the <b>Italian</b> <b>Operation</b> Alfa in the area of Prozor, massacred over five hundred Croats and Muslims and burnt numerous villages. Baćović noted that [...] "Our Chetniks killed all men 15 years of age or older. ... Seventeen villages were burned to the ground."

40|$|By {{reflecting}} {{on both the}} exclusionary and the inclusionary role of humanitarian migration and border management in the Central Mediterranean, this paper explores the relationship of humanitarianism with the delocalization of the EU border and with human rights. First, the paper analyses the role {{of human rights in}} the institutional humanitarian discourse about migration and border management at the Mediterranean EU border. The paper then analyses the <b>Italian</b> <b>operation</b> Mare Nostrum and, more generally, Italian humanitarianized border management in the Central Mediterranean. In doing this, it shows that humanitarianism contributes to the discursive legitimation and spatial delocalization of exclusionary policies and practices. Moreover, humanitarianism contributes to a symbolically and legally subordinate inclusion of migrants in the European space. While such humanitarian inclusion can be more inclusive than what human rights would require, it is posited as an act of grace rather than an enhancement of human rights. In both its exclusionary and inclusionary dimension, humanitarianism transcends and expands territorial boundaries by outsourcing responsibilities and enhancing delocalized border management...|$|E
40|$|There is, {{among some}} of your {{reviewer}} 2 ̆ 7 s friends, an abhorrence of tax competition, and a fascination with tax harmonization, that defies simple understanding. The way that the case is typically presented, European tax harmonization is desirable because eliminating tax differences between European nations would promote economic efficiency. With greater economic efficiency, there is more of everything to go around, so it becomes possible to maintain life exactly as it currently is, except that now, instead of every family having one toaster, they can have two. A wise goal, a worthy goal, this economic efficiency-though the drive to eke more out of existing resources {{in order to give}} every household that second toaster hardly seems the stuff of vicious and prolonged political controversy. Since the potential output benefits of European tax harmonization, if they are positive at all, are likely to be very small, perhaps this is not, ultimately, an argument about the kind of efficiency you can get when a firm slightly contracts its German operation in order to expand slightly its <b>Italian</b> <b>operation.</b> Quite possibly this is, in fact, an argument about the future of European society-about whether, and how, to sustain government expenditures at the levels to which they grew in the late twentieth century. Economic efficiency is just intellectual cover for what the fight really concerns, which is the cost and desirability of the modern welfare state...|$|E

30|$|Italy {{recently}} attempted {{but ultimately}} abandoned a more humane effort in managing people movements from North Africa. The <b>Italian</b> <b>Operation</b> Mare Nostrum began in October 2013 {{with the aim}} of intercepting people in distress and carrying them back to Italian reception centres (Mare Nostrum, no date). Because of its emphasis on rescuing and assisting, the operation Mare Nostrum received strong support from intergovernmental agencies such as the International Organisation for Migration but no support from other EU member states with the UK harshly criticising the operation as being a pull factor (Travis, 2014). While Italy was seeking support from the EU to continue the Operation, according to Amnesty International ‘the EU and its member states avoided any decisions which could help refugees and migrants leaving North Africa {{for as long as they}} could’ (Amnesty International, 2015, p. 34). On 27 August 2014, Operation Triton, an EU border patrol-only operation managed by Frontex, the European border agency, effectively replaced the Operation Mare Nostrum (European Commission, 2014). Operation Triton only monitors the ‘external border’ (European Commission, 2014), up to 30 nautical miles from the European coasts, and is not a rescuing migrants at sea but ‘render[s] assistance to persons in distress’ (European Commission, 2014). Centred on these points, Operation Triton was criticised as it was evident it resumed the harsher approach (“Frontex Launches Joint Operation Triton”, 2014). More recent tragedies on the Mediterranean have prompted the UN High Commissioner for Refugees Antonio Guterres to say that Triton is a ‘woefully inadequate replacement for Italy's Mare Nostrum’ (“Hundreds of Migrants”, 2015, para. 4).|$|E
