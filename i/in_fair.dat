5|$|In 1977, the church, rectory, {{and schools}} were {{recorded}} by a historic preservation program {{run by the}} Ohio Historical Society, known as the Ohio Historic Inventory. This survey found the church in excellent condition, the elementary school <b>in</b> <b>fair</b> condition, and {{the high school and}} rectory in good condition. Although no historic preservation program was in effect, no threats to historic integrity were identified for any of the buildings, except for the elementary school, which was deemed to be in danger from being outdated.|$|E
5|$|Many {{improvements}} {{have been}} made to the existing Route 4 arterial. The Route 17 interchange in Paramus was rebuilt at a cost of $120 million in 1999, replacing the 1932 cloverleaf interchange by adding several flyover ramps. In 2002, construction was completed on a $32 million project that improved the interchange with Route 208 <b>in</b> <b>Fair</b> Lawn. This interchange saw improvements of the ramps and bridges, including the Route 208 bridge over Saddle River Road.|$|E

5|$|The Division Street Bridge {{was last}} rehabilitated in 1985, {{but it remains}} open under no {{restrictions}} after its inspection in May 2012.

The scour condition is critical, but the recommended work is rehabilitation of the structure.|$|E
5|$|The force out: {{recorded}} {{against a}} runner who {{is required to}} attempt to advance—either because the runner is on first base and a batted ball lands <b>in</b> <b>fair</b> territory, or because the runner immediately behind on the basepath is thus required to attempt to advance—but fails to reach the next base before a fielder touches the base while holding the ball. The ground out is technically a special case of the force out.|$|E
5|$|The ground out: {{recorded}} {{against a}} batter (in this case, batter-runner) who hits a ball that lands <b>in</b> <b>fair</b> territory which, before the batter-runner can reach first base, is retrieved by a fielder who touches first base while holding the ball or relays {{it to another}} fielder who touches first base while holding the ball.|$|E

5|$|Whatever {{the nature}} of the Ghoorkhas may have been found in other quarters, there was here no cruelty to wounded or to prisoners; no {{poisoned}} arrows were used; no wells or waters were poisoned; no rancorous spirit of revenge seemed to animate them: they fought us <b>in</b> <b>fair</b> conflict, like men; and, in intervals of actual combat, showed us a liberal courtesy worthy of a more enlightened people.|$|E
5|$|A {{home run}} {{is a hit}} in which the player reaches home plate, and scores a run on the same play without being called out. Most often in modern baseball, this occurs when a player hits the ball over the outfield wall <b>in</b> <b>fair</b> territory. However, it can occur on a ball hit to the outfield with a fast runner when the ball does not leave the field of play; this is called an inside-the-park home run. Home-run hitters are often likely to be larger, slower players due to their strength, {{and may not be}} fast enough to {{complete}} the triple. The MLB single-season and all-time leader in home runs is Barry Bonds, who hit 73 home runs in the 2001 season and notched 762 in his 22-season career. Bonds never hit for the cycle. The highest on the list to do so is Alex Rodriguez (fourth all-time; 696 home runs as of January 16, 2017), who hit for the cycle on June 5, 1997.|$|E
5|$|Any runners {{already on}} base may attempt to advance on batted balls that land, or contact the ground, <b>in</b> <b>fair</b> territory, {{before or after}} the ball lands. A runner on first base must attempt to advance if a ball lands in play. If a ball hit into play rolls foul before passing through the infield, it becomes dead and any runners must return to the base they were at when the play began. If the ball is hit in the air and caught before it lands, the batter has flied out and any runners on base may attempt to advance only if they tag up or touch the base they were at when the play began, as or after the ball is caught. Runners may also attempt to advance to the next base while the pitcher {{is in the process of}} {{delivering}} the ball to home plate—a successful effort is a stolen base.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of each half-inning, the nine players on the fielding team arrange themselves around the field. One of them, the pitcher, stands on the pitcher's mound. The pitcher begins the pitching delivery with one foot on the rubber, pushing off it to gain velocity when throwing toward home plate. Another player, the catcher, squats {{on the far side of}} home plate, facing the pitcher. The rest of the team faces home plate, typically arranged as four infielders—who set up along or within a few yards outside the imaginary lines (basepaths) between first, second, and third base—and three outfielders. In the standard arrangement, there is a first baseman positioned several steps to the left of first base, a second baseman to the right of second base, a shortstop to the left of second base, and a third baseman to the right of third base. The basic outfield positions are left fielder, center fielder, and right fielder. With the exception of the catcher, all fielders are required to be <b>in</b> <b>fair</b> territory when the pitch is delivered. A neutral umpire sets up behind the catcher. Other umpires will be distributed around the field as well, though the number will vary depending on the level of play; amateur or children's games may only have an umpire behind the plate, while as many as six umpires can be used for important major league games.|$|E
5|$|MD 213 enters Elkton at the {{intersection}} with US 40 (Pulaski Highway). Past this intersection, the route heads northwest on Bridge Street, passing through commercial areas. The route intersects Main Street, which continues east of MD 213 as a one-way street eastbound. Past Main Street, the road continues north and passes over Amtrak's Northeast Corridor before intersecting MD 545 (Elkton Boulevard). MD 213 continues past commercial areas {{to the west and}} residential areas to the east before its intersection with MD 279 (Elkton Road/Newark Avenue). Past the MD 279 intersection, the route leaves Elkton and becomes Singerly Road, which continues past residences. MD 213 enters a mix of woods and farms and passes over Interstate 95 (John F. Kennedy Memorial Highway) and CSX's Philadelphia Subdivision within a short distance of each other. It continues through a mix of farms and residences before the road reaches the Leeds roundabout with Leeds Road. Past the roundabout, the route resumes north, intersecting MD 273 (Telegraph Road) <b>in</b> <b>Fair</b> Hill west of the Fair Hill Training Center, where the Atlantic to Appalachians Scenic Byway leaves MD 213 and heads west along MD 273. From here, MD 213 continues northwest and west as Lewisville Road through a mix of rural areas and residences before ending at the Pennsylvania border. Here, the road continues north as PA 841 into Lewisville, intersecting the southern terminus of PA 472 just north of the state line.|$|E
