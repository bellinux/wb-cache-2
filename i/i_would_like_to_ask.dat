5|$|Because I {{always try}} {{so hard to}} win and had my {{troubles}} in Boston, I was suspended. At playoff time it hurts {{not be in the}} game with the boys.

2500|$|Raeder's last speech {{occurred}} as Commander-in-Chief occurred on 30 January 1943 before the Reichstag, where {{he asserted that}} he had brought the Navy [...] "smoothly and completely" [...] into {{the service of the}} Führer in 1933. Raeder argued that: [...] "This was possible only because, despite all outside efforts to influence it, the training of the Navy [...] derived from an inner attitude that was itself truly National Socialist. For this reason, we did not have to change, but could become followers of the Führer with open hearts. I find it particularly satisfying that the Führer has always attributed this to me, and <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> all of you {{to see to it that}} the Navy remains a strong and reliable support of the Führer in this regard". Though Hitler had cordial relations with Raeder, the two had never been close, and there was nothing like the mutual admiration that Hitler and Dönitz shared.|$|E
2500|$|Government {{efforts to}} lower {{subsidies}} to unprofitable enterprises and {{to shrink the}} money supply caused the semi-official exchange rate for the Cuban peso to move {{from a peak of}} 120 to the dollar in the summer of 1994 to 21 to the dollar by year-end 1999. The drop in GDP apparently halted in 1994, when Cuba reported 0.7% growth, followed by increases of 2.5% in 1995 and 7.8% in 1996. Growth slowed again in 1997 and 1998 to 2.5% and 1.2% respectively. One of the key reasons given was the failure to notice that sugar production had become uneconomic. Reflecting on the Special period Cuban president Fidel Castro later admitted that many mistakes had been made, [...] "The country had many economists and it is not my intention to criticize them, but <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> why we hadn’t discovered earlier that maintaining our levels of sugar production would be impossible. The Soviet Union had collapsed, oil was costing $40 a barrel, sugar prices were at basement levels, so why did we not rationalize the industry?" [...] Living conditions in 1999 remained well below the 1989 level.|$|E
