40|$|Abstract Background To {{evaluate}} medicine prices, {{availability and}} affordability in Brazil, considering the differences across {{three types of}} medicines (originator brands, generics and similar medicines) and different types of facilities (private pharmacies, public sector pharmacies and “popular pharmacies”). Methods Data on prices and availability of 50 medicines were collected in 56 pharmacies across six cities in Southern Brazil using the World Health Organization / Health Action International methodology. Median prices obtained were divided by international reference prices to derive the median price ratio (MPR). Results In the private sector, prices were 8. 6 MPR for similar medicines, 11. 3 MRP for generics and 18. 7 MRP <b>for</b> <b>originator</b> brands, respectively. Mean availability was 65 %, 74 % and 48 % <b>for</b> <b>originator</b> brands, generics and similar medicines, respectively. In the public sector, mean availability of similar medicines was 2 – 7 times {{higher than that of}} generics. Mean overall availability in the public sector ranged from 68. 8 % to 81. 7 %.

40|$|This paper evaluates {{medicine}} prices, their {{availability and}} affordability in Brazil, considering the differences across {{three types of}} medicines on the market (originator brands, generics and similar medicines) and different types of facilities (private pharmacies, public sector pharmacies and “popular pharmacies”), using an established methodology. Data on prices and availability of 50 medicines (originator brand, lowestpriced generic and similar medicines) were collected from public, private and popular pharmacies (N= 56) across six cities in Southern Brazil. Median prices obtained are divided by international reference prices to derive the median price ratio (MPR). In the private sector, prices were 8. 6 MPR for similar medicines, 11. 3 MRP for generics and 18. 7 MRP <b>for</b> <b>originator</b> brands, respectively. Mean availability was 65 %, 74 % and 48 % <b>for</b> <b>originator</b> brands, generics and similars, respectively. The number of working days needed {{to pay for a}} complete medicine treatment (affordability) varied considerably between medicines aimed at treating acute and chronic diseases and by type of medicine. In the public sector, the mean availability of similar medicines was 2 - 7 times higher than that of generics. The mean overall availability in the public sector ranged from 68. 8 % to 81. 7 %. In “popular pharmacies”, mean availability was greater than 90 % in all cities. This analysis finds that availability of medicines in the public sector does not meet the challenge for supplying essential medicines to the entire population, as stated in the Brazilian constitution. This has unavoidable repercussions for affordability, particularly amongst the lower socio-economic strata. Policies targeted to reduce the prices of the generics need to be implemented in Brazil, as well as making them more widely available. Popular pharmacies may help overcome the lack of medicines in the public sector, but the limited number of medicines distributed in these facilities is of concern...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the extent of generic {{competition}} in European countries, given an understanding of these countries' different pharmaceutical price regulations and health care structures. In particular, this study investigates generic competition among the five largest European pharmaceutical markets; the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Italy and Spain, with comprehensive IMS data set for 10 years (1994 - 2003), in order to estimate the effect of generic entry on drug prices at the product level. Both within and across these countries, different interventions are being applied to in-patent and off-patent markets during 10 years of the study period. For example, in Germany, markets for on-patent drugs are largely unregulated and prices are set relatively freely; however, once generics enter the market, the German government uses reference pricing to set reimbursement rates. In the UK, originator medicine prices are free from direct regulatory intervention, but are subject to a rate of return regulation. Additionally, once generics enter the market, the UK's government uses price caps. France, Italy, and Spain, on the other hand, use direct price controls <b>for</b> <b>originator</b> drugs and reference pricing system for generic drugs. Accordingly, this analysis finds that generic entry has a negative effect on prices in countries with free pricing originator market, whereas in European Union (EU) countries with strict price and reimbursement regulation, generic competition is ineffective and/or counterproductive. Low regulated prices <b>for</b> <b>originator</b> products do not encourage generic entry following patent expiration. This finding is consistent with less generic firms and less competitive late entrants in regulated environments. Thus, strict price regulation undermines price competition in the off-patent sector, and cost savings from post-patent competition are not realized in countries with strict pricing and reimbursement policies...|$|E

We examine effects of per capita income, income dispersion, number {{and type of}} therapeutic and generic competitors, and whether the drugs are sold to retail pharmacies vs. tendered procurement by NGOs. The cross-national income elasticity of prices is 0. 4 across high and low income countries, but is only 0. 15 between MLICs, implying that drugs are least affordable relative to income in the lowest income countries. Within-country income inequality contributes to relatively high prices in MLICs. Number of therapeutic and generic competitors only weakly affects prices to retail pharmacies, plausibly because uncertain quality leads to competition on brand rather than price.

Originator control policies {{are one of the}} generic and key concerns of usage control. Usage control is an emerging concept which encompasses traditional access control and digital rights management solutions. However, current commercial Digital Rights Management (DRM) solutions lack enforcement of access control policies such as role-based access control (RBAC), mandatory access control (MAC), discretionary access control (DAC) and originator control because their control of access to digital object is mainly based on payment.

40|$|Objectives: This study aims {{to conduct}} a {{descriptive}} analysis of the policy environment surrounding the generic medicines retail market in Portugal. The policy analysis focuses on supply-side measures (i. e. market access, pricing, reference-pricing and reimbursement of generic medicines) and demand-side measures (i. e. incentives for physicians to prescribe, for pharmacists to dispense and for patients to use generic medicines). Methods: The policy analysis {{was based on an}} international literature review. Also, a simulation exercise was carried out to compute potential savings from substituting generic <b>for</b> <b>originator</b> medicines in Portugal using IMS Health data. Results: Portugal has developed a successful generic medicines market by increasing reimbursement of generic medicines (until October 2005), by introducing a reference-pricing system, by encouraging physicians to prescribe by international non-proprietary name (INN), and by allowing generic substitution by pharmacists. However, the development of the generic medicines market has been hindered by the existence of copies, pricing regulation, certain features of the reference-pricing system, weak incentives for physicians to prescribe generic medicines and a financial disincentive for pharmacists to dispense generic medicines. Increased generic substitution would be expected to reduce public expenditure on originator medicines by 45 %. Conclusions: The development of the Portuguese generic medicines market has mainly been fuelled by supply-side measures. To support the further expansion of the market, policy makers need to strengthen demand-side measures inciting physicians to prescribe, pharmacists to dispense and patients to use generic medicines...|$|E

40|$|AIM: To descriptively {{analyze the}} policy {{environment}} surrounding the Polish generic medicines retail market. METHOD: The policy analysis {{was based on}} an international literature review. Also, a simulation exercise was carried out to compute potential savings from substituting generic <b>for</b> <b>originator</b> medicines in Poland using IMS Health pharmaceutical intelligence data. RESULTS: Poland has a mature, high-volume, low-value generic medicines market, primarily driven by the establishment of the reference price at the price of the cheapest medicine in combination with pricing regulation and the low level of medicine prices. The practice of discounting in the distribution chain implies that the National Health Fund and patients do not capture the potential savings from a generic medicines market where companies compete on price. This high-volume market has benefited in the past from the limited availability of originator medicines and a short data exclusivity period, even though there are no incentives for physicians to prescribe generic medicines and a financial disincentive for pharmacists to dispense generic medicines. Increased generic substitution would be expected to reduce public expenditure on originator medicines by 21 %. CONCLUSION: To develop a competitive and sustainable market, Poland needs to consider moving away from competition by discount to competition by price. This could be achieved by replacing maximum distribution margins by fixed margins. Also, Poland may wish to raise reference prices as a temporary measure to boost market entry for medicine classes with few generic medicines. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Biosimilars are similar, but non-identical, {{versions}} of existing biological drugs for which patents have expired. Despite the rigorous approval process for biosimilars, con-cerns have been expressed about the efficacy {{and safety of}} these products in clinical practice. Biosimilars of filgrastim, based on the originator product Neupogen®, have been avail-able since 2008 and are now in widespread clinical use in Europe and elsewhere. Three biosimilar G-CSFs have been approved based {{on a combination of}} physicochemical and biological protein characterisation, pharmacokinetic and phar-macodynamic assessment in healthy volunteers and efficacy and safety data in patients with cancer. To assess whether biosimilars are effective in the real-world clinical practice setting, a pooled analysis of five post-approval studies of biosimilar G-CSF (Zarzio®) that included 1, 302 adult patients who received at least one cycle of chemotherapy with G-CSF support for the prevention of neutropenia was conducted. A total of 36 % of patients had a febrile neutropenia risk of> 20 %, while 39. 6 % had a risk of 10 – 20 % based on chemotherapy regimen. The occurrence of severe or febrile neutropenia was within the range of that observed in previous studies of origi-nator G-CSF. In addition, the safety profile of Zarzio ® was consistent with that reported <b>for</b> <b>originator</b> G-CSF and the known safety profile of G-CSF. Initial concerns about the use of biosimilars, at least with regard to biosimilar G-CSFs, appear to be unfounded. Adoption of cost-effective biosimilars should help reduce healthcare costs and improve patient access to biological treatments...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectivesIn low- {{and middle-income}} countries, {{patients}} and reimbursement agencies that purchase medicines {{in the private}} sector pay more <b>for</b> <b>originator</b> brands when generic equivalents exist. We estimated the savings that could be obtained from a hypothetical switch in medicine consumption from originator brands to lowest-priced generic equivalents for a selection of medicines in 17 countries. MethodsIn this cost minimization analysis, the prices of originator brands and their lowest-priced generic equivalents were obtained from facility-based surveys conducted by using a standard methodology. Fourteen medicines most commonly included in the surveys, plus three statins, were included in the analysis. For each medicine, the volume of private sector consumption of the originator brand product was obtained from IMS Health, Inc. Volumes were applied to the median unit prices for both originator brands and their lowest-priced generics to estimate cost savings. Prices were adjusted to 2008 by using consumer price index data and were adjusted for purchasing power parity. ResultsFor the medicines studied, an average of 9 % to 89 % could be saved by an individual country from a switch in private sector purchases from originator brands to lowest-priced generics. In public hospitals in China, US $ 370 million could be saved from switching only four medicines, saving an average of 65 %. Across individual medicines, average potential savings ranged from 11 % for beclometasone inhaler to 73 % for ceftriaxone injection. ConclusionsSubstantial savings could be achieved by switching private sector purchases from originator brand medicines to lowest-priced generic equivalents. Strategies to promote generic uptake, such as generic substitution by pharmacists and increasing confidence in generics by professionals and the public, should be included in national medicines policies...|$|E
