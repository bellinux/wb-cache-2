I had only six natives then, but by degrees others <b>joined</b> <b>me,</b> <b>now</b> my tribe is a thousand strong. Here we live in profound peace and plenty. I have all I need, and I seek no more. Heaven has prospered me so far--may it do so to the end, which for me draws nigh. And now I am tired and will go back.

Look! some of the headmen are waiting to see me." ...|$|R
40|$|This article {{chronicles the}} author’s journey of writing short stories. Following an opening story, the author {{explains}} how she wrote {{short stories and}} field notes during her study of Head Start policy Initially, the stories captured the author’s emotive and physical memories of mundane and extraordinary events. Later, {{with the help of}} Norman Denzin, the stories became part of a research text. Acknowledging that researchers are encouraged to write experimental texts, the author argues that there are few exemplars in educational research of such work. The author then describes and shows how she combined short stories with connecting text. The connecting text provides historical and cultural background on policies depicted in the story. The article concludes by raising questions about how short stories will be evaluated by qualitative methodologists and other researchers.

5000|$|John Martin's {{address to}} the crowd at Glasnevin Cemetery, Dublin in honour of the Manchester Martyrs 8 December 1867:-... "The three bodies that we would tenderly bear to the churchyard, and would bury in consecrated ground with all the solemn rites of religion, are not here. They are away in a foreign and hostile land (hear, hear), {{where they have been}} thrown into unconsecrated ground, branded by the triumphant hatred of our enemies as the vile remains of murderers (cries of 'no murderers,' and cheers). Those three men whose {{memories}} we are here to-day to honour - Allen, O'Brien, and Larkin - they were not murderers (great cheering). (A Voice - Lord have mercy on them.) Mr. Martin - These men were pious men, virtuous men - they were men who feared God and loved their country. They sorrowed for the sorrows of the dear old native land of their love (hear, hear). They wished, if possible, to save her, and for that love and for that wish they were doomed to an ignominious death {{at the hands of the}} British hangman (hear, hear). It was as Irish patriots that these men were doomed to death (cheers)..... "You will <b>join</b> with <b>me</b> <b>now</b> in repeating the prayer of the three martyrs whom we mourn - 'God Save Ireland!' And all of you, men, women, and boys and girls that are to be men and women of holy Ireland, will ever keep the sentiment of that prayer in your heart of hearts." ...|$|R
