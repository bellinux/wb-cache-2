40|$|In {{this paper}} {{the problem of}} {{spacecraft}} orbit control with minimum <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption</b> <b>is</b> <b>considered,</b> in terms of simulating low thrust maneuvers for a spacecraft around the Earth. A numerical suboptimal solution is tried, when {{the direction of the}} thrust is assumed to be a quadratic form function of a reference angle that specify the position of the satellite in the orbit. The main goal is to develop a software that can calculate the control laws for real missions. The problem is numerically treated by using a direct search approach. The numerical solution of the problem in each iteration is reduced to one of nonlinear programming, which is then solved with the gradient projection method. The spacecraft is supposed to be in Keplerian motion controlled by the thrusts, that are assumed to be of fixed magnitude (either low or high) and operating in an on-off mode. Results of simulations are presented. Pages: 123 - 12...|$|E
40|$|Abstract In {{this paper}} {{the problem of}} sending a {{spacecraft}} from Low Earth Orbit (LEO) to the Moon with minimum <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption</b> <b>is</b> <b>considered.</b> The goal {{is to find the}} control to be used to perform the tasks involved in the mission that minimizes the fuel expenditure required. The first part of this paper deals with impulsive maneuvers, where the control consists in the application of two impulsive thrusts that changes instantaneously the velocity of the spacecraft, and obtain a set of values for the fuel expenditure and trip time for several trajectories. The second part considers the use of lowthrust trajectories, where the control consists of chosen the instants to start and to stop the application of a finite thrust, as well as the direction of this thrust at every instant of time. The results showed that large savings in fuel consumption could be obtained by using low thrust trajectories for the Earth-Moon part of the mission. A first analysis for the behavior of the orbit around the Moon, including predictions for the frequency and fuel expenditure for the maneuvers to keep the orbit close to the nominal trajectory, is also included. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract:- In {{this paper}} {{the problem of}} sending a {{spacecraft}} from Low Earth Orbit (LEO) to the Moon with minimum <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption</b> <b>is</b> <b>considered.</b> It is assumed that the "Two-Body model " approximation is valid in all phases of the mission and that the final orbit around the Moon is polar. The first part deals with impulsive maneuvers, and obtain a set of values for fuel expenditure and trip time for several trajectories. Two possible scenarios are considered: a single mission (only one spacecraft in orbit around the Moon) and a double mission (one main spacecraft and a sub-satellite around the Moon). The second part considers the use of low-thrust trajectories. The Euler-Lagrange equations are used to generate a set of differential equations that are numerically integrated to obtain the final orbit. The difficulty caused {{by a lack of}} initial values for all variables in the same point (Two Point Boundary Value Problem) is treated by making iterations in the initial values of the Lagrange multipliers. The results showed that large savings in fuel consumption can be obtained by using low thrust trajectories for the Earth-Moon part of the mission. The contribution of the present paper related to previous ones written by the same author is the use of the Powell’s Quadratically Convergent method to solve the problem, that showed to have a better numerical behaviour regarding convergence...|$|E

40|$|Peat {{fires in}} boreal and tundra regions can {{potentially}} cause a high CO 2 release, {{because of their}} large soil carbon stocks. Under current and future climate warming the frequency and intensity of droughts are increasing and will cause the plant community and organic soil to become more susceptible to fire. The organic soil consumption by fire is commonly used {{as a proxy for}} fire severity and is a large source of carbon release. However, the role of organic soils in both above- and belowground fire behavior has only rarely been studied. In this study we collected soil and branches from Betula pubescens, Pinus sylvestris and Picea abies/obovata from the taiga/tundra ecotone across a large spatial scale. In laboratory fire experiments we burned different fuel type combinations to examine the fire spread through fuel ladders both from branches to soil and vice versa. We found that the tree species identity influences the fire spread from branches to soil and vice versa. The combination of chemical and structural plant traits could explain the stronger interaction between soil and coniferous spruce and pine fuels in a fire ladder compared to the deciduous birch. Therefore, total carbon emission from a boreal forest fire may not only depend on burned plant fuel, but also on the species-specific potential of the trees to ignite the soil. Carbon emission models and forest management could be improved if not only the aboveground plant <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption</b> <b>is</b> <b>considered,</b> but also the interaction between fuels in a fuel ladder and the probability of soil ignition by a forest crown fire and vice versa...|$|E

For example, the fuel economy target for the 2012 Honda Fit with a footprint of 40 sq ft is 36 mpg, equivalent to a published fuel economy of 27 mpg, and a Ford F-150 with its footprint of 65 - 75 sq ft has a fuel economy target of 22 mpg, i.e., 17 mpg published. Individual vehicles {{do not have to}} meet their fuel economy targets; CAFE compliance is enforced at the fleet level.

As an introduction the temperature variation and the stress on a turbine blade for a gas temperature of 900 degrees and circumferential velocities of 600 meters per second are discussed. The assumptions onthe heat transfer coefficients at the blade profile are supported by tests on an electrically heated blade model. The temperature distribution in the cross section of a blade Is thoroughly investigated and the temperature field determined for a special case. A method for calculation of the thermal stresses in turbine blades for a given temperature distribution is indicated. The effect of the heat radiation on the blade temperature also is dealt with. Test-stand experiments on turbine blades are evaluated, particularly with respect to temperature distribution in the cross section; maximum and minimum temperature in the cross section are ascertained. Finally, the application of the hollow blade for a stationary gas turbine is investigated.

40|$|The optimal {{design of}} hybrid {{electric}} vehicle (HEV) powertrains from a systems perspective is critical to realize the maximum benefits for a given application. This is particularly true in the heavy-duty vehicle space where the major challenges are: (i) greater emphasis on economic viability, (ii) reluctance to take on risk associated with new technologies, and (iii) numerous diverse applications that preclude a one-size-fits-all approach to hybrid-electric powertrain design. Past studies on HEV powertrain design have either ignored battery degradation, or failed to holistically capture its impact from a lifecycle cost perspective. The focus of this effort {{is the development of}} a model-based framework that enables parametric optimization of the design and control of {{hybrid electric vehicle}}s while accounting for the degradation of the lithium-ion battery {{and its impact on the}} total cost-of-ownership of the vehicle. ^ Two different implementations of such a framework are described.

It captures the impact of battery degradation on <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption</b> and battery replacements over the vehicle life by incorporating a high-fidelity electrochemical battery model capable of predicting degradation, and degraded performance, into the powertrain simulation. An electric motor and battery size optimization problem is studied for a parallel HEV transit bus application.

The authors estimate the magnitude of the forgone tax revenue when a hybrid electric vehicle displaces a similar-sized conventional gasoline-powered vehicle. The authors find that under several vehicle electrification scenarios, the combined federal and state trust fund contributions could decline by as much as 5 % because of new hybrid electric cars to be sold in 2020 and as much as 12. 5 % because of those to be sold in 2030.

30|$|The Air {{transport}} {{industry has}} {{contributed significantly to}} the growth of commerce, communication, trade and tourism globally. In spite of a marked expansion, the air transport industry is faced with major issues like high <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption,</b> <b>fuel</b> prices, air traffic growth, competition, economic crisis, aviation emission, safety, design and operational challenges. In this study, <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption</b> has <b>been</b> <b>considered,</b> to <b>be</b> a major challenge for the air transport industry. Attributable to high oil prices and an escalation of competition, <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption</b> <b>is</b> rapidly becoming a critical aspect of the air transport industry. Widespread improvement in the global economy during the past year has also contributed to the demand of oil, thereby inflating its price. David L. Greene [1] pointed out that in the early 1970 s, air transport doubled its energy efficiency and restrained the growth rate of fuel. In spite of this improvement, energy use by commercial air carriers grew {{at an annual rate of}} 2  % from 1970 to 1987. Mohammad Mazraati [2] concluded upon continuously increasing <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption</b> and air traffic. According to this study, world aviation oil demand was 1.18  MB/d in 1971, and reached 4.9  MB/d in 2006. The aviation sector accounts for about 5.8  % of total oil <b>consumption</b> worldwide. Aviation <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption</b> today corresponds to between 2 and 3  % of total fossil fuel use worldwide, more than 80  % of which is used by civil aviation [3]. Emma Nygren et al. [4] predicted that traffic will grow 5  % per year to 2026 and fuel demand 3  % per year. According to Schlumberger [5] the demand for jet fuel and aviation gasoline in the air transport sector is projected to reach 14  % of fuel demand in transportation in 2035, compared to 12  % in 2009.|$|R
40|$|The {{reduction}} of CO 2 emissions is strongly {{linked with the}} improvement of engine specific <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption,</b> along with the {{reduction of}} engine nacelle drag and weight. One alternative design approach to improving specific <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption</b> <b>is</b> to <b>consider</b> a geared fan combined with an increased overall pressure ratio intercooled core performance cycle. The thermal benefits from intercooling have been well documented in the literature. Nevertheless, {{there is very little}} information available in the public domain with respect to design space exploration of such an engine concept when combined with a geared fan. The present work uses a multidisciplinary conceptual design tool to analyze the option of an intercooled core geared fan aero engine for long haul applications with a 2020 entry into service technology level assumption. With minimum mission fuel in mind, the results indicate as optimal values a pressure ratio split exponent of 0. 38 and an intercooler mass flow ratio of 1. 18 at hot-day top of climb conditions. At ISA midcruise conditions a specific thrust of 86 m/s, a jet velocity ratio of 0. 83, an intercooler effectiveness of 56 %, and an overall pressure ratio value of 76 are likely to be a good choice. A 70, 000 lbf intercooled turbofan engine is large enough to make efficient use of an all-axial compression system, particularly within a geared fan configuration, but intercooling is perhaps more likely to be applied to even larger engines. The proposed optimal jet velocity ratio is actually higher than the value one would expect by using standard analytical expressions, primarily because this design variable affects core efficiency at midcruise due to a combination of several different subtle changes to the core cycle and core component efficiencies at this condition. The analytical expressions do not consider changes in core efficiency and the beneficial effect of intercooling on transfer efficiency, nor do they account for losses in the bypass duct and jet pipe, while a relatively detailed engine performance model, such as the one utilized in this study, does. Mission fuel results from a surrogate model are in good agreement with the results obtained from a rubberized-wing aircraft model for some of the design parameters. This indicates {{that it is possible to}} replace an aircraft model with specific <b>fuel</b> <b>consumption</b> and weight penalty exchange rates. Nevertheless, drag count exchange rates have to be utilized to properly assess changes in mission fuel for those design parameters that affect nacelle diameter...|$|R
