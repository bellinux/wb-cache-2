Study Design: Data on the ocupational acidents in the Grek Mariculture industry are reviewed and compared with Ocupational Acidents in Grece and in Europe. Place and Duration of Study: Grece betwen 209 and 201. Methodology: The study was caried out using reported data for ocupational accidents from the ESAW 201 (Eurostat, European statistics for acidents at work) and the Helenic Labor Inspection Body (SEPE) and was analysed using descriptive and inferential statistcs. ocupational acidents. The majority of acidents are atributed to slips and trips (39) whereas in the general populaton of workers the majority of ocupational acidents are asociated with handling of objects (23). Grek Aquaculture as a whole represents les than 2 per thousand of the total work force, 3 per thousand of al serious injuries and 16 per thousand of atal injuries during 209 - 201.

There are some examples <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>mater</b> which {{can be seen in}} the Aquaculture industries in other countries.

40|$|The English {{absolute}} construction (AC) is {{a schematic}} non-finite construction {{consisting of a}} (pro-) nominal head and a predicate and typically expressing adverbial meaning (1). (1) They þus gadered, he asked councell what was best to do <b>in</b> <b>þis</b> <b>mater.</b> (YCOE) (anteriority) Based on an analysis of over 10, 000 tokens taken from the YCOE-corpus, the PENN-parsed corpora, the Old Bailey Corpus and the BNC, {{the aim of this}} paper is to address two cases of gradual category change in the AC's history, each resulting in overlapping older and newer uses, and to detail how especially the second change can be usefully informed by the constructional perspective. The first change concerns the AC shifting from an adverbial subordinate construction to a quasi-coordinate construction paraphrasable by and + finite(2). This development involves a shift in clausal status (from subordinate to quasi-coordinate) and a shift from typically adverbial meanings to an elaboration/addition meaning. (2) The girl was pale and intense, her expression revealing nothing (= and her expression revealed nothing). (BNC) The second category change concerns the shift of AC-augmentor with (i. e. the item introducing the AC) from a preposition-like item indicating the specific relation of manner/accompanying circumstance (3) to a semantically bleached 'absolute marker'. This shift is argued to benefit from a constructionalization perspective (Trousdale 2012; Traugott & Trousdale 2013), in that it meets three criteria: generalization, syntactic productivity, and decrease in compositionality. By expanding its semantic range from a specific manner/accompanying circumstance meaning to a much vaguer and context-dependent meaning (4), with-ACs show an increase in semantic generality.

(BNC) Increasing syntactic productivity is observed in the growing set of complements of with (cf. Himmelmann’s 2004 host-class expansion) : from past & present participles to NPs, AdjPs, AdvPs and PPs. Finally, semantic bleaching of with has resulted in decreasing compositionality, as with’s semantic contribution to the AC has become increasingly difficult to identify (the fact that the set of AC-augmentors has, over time, narrowed to with may have contributed to its loss of identifiable meaning). This study, then, wishes to show that, while not all category changes are amenable to a constructionalization perspective, our understanding of category change may be considerably enhanced by a constructionalization view. status: publishe...|$|E

However, due to limitations of traditional proteomics strategies, only a few abundantly expressed proteins have yet been identified. Our laboratory applied a more effective strategy: one-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (1 D SDS-PAGE) and reverse-phase liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (RP-LC-MS/MS) were employed to analyze the mature oocyte proteome in depth. Results Using this high-performance proteomic approach, we successfully identified 625 different proteins from 2700 mature mouse oocytes lacking zona pellucidae. This is the largest catalog of mature mouse oocyte proteins compiled to date. According to their pattern of expression, we screened 76 maternal proteins with high levels of mRNA expression both in oocytes and fertilized eggs. Many well-known maternal effect proteins were included <b>in</b> <b>this</b> subset, including <b>MATER</b> and NPM 2. In addition, our mouse oocyte proteome was compared with a recently published mouse embryonic stem cell (ESC) proteome and 371 overlapping proteins were identified.
