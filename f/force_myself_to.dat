500|$|In March 2009 the Hoodoo Gurus {{also signed}} a new {{recording}} contract with Sony Music Australia, the deal includes the band's back catalogue {{as well as}} a new album, the band's ninth and the first since the release of Mach Schau in 2004. [...] Brad Shepherd said it had the potential to be [...] "a career defining record". [...] During the process of writing the album Dave Faulkner said in reference to the eclectic mix of songs ready for the album that [...] "rather than stopping myself writing something, I just didn't artificially <b>force</b> <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> write in any direction". [...] The album was originally scheduled for release in September 2009 but they were not happy with the final mix. Hoodoo Gurus then sent their songs off to Durango, Colorado, where Ed Stasium, who worked on the band's previous albums Kinky and Crank worked with Faulkner. Faulkner flew to the US after Hoodoo Gurus performed in Japan, their first performances there in over 20 years.|$|E

I {{had this}} {{platinum}} record that {{showed up in the}} mail, and I had nothing except for my own talents. So at some point, I forced myself to play the guitar. I would <b>force</b> <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> write lyrics. I was playing people's demos. I was still into the band. It's just that I didn't have anything.|$|E
2500|$|She {{was offered}} many {{roles in the}} 1940s and {{throughout}} her retirement years but she rejected {{all but a few}} of them. In the few instances when she accepted, the slightest problem led her to drop out. Although she refused to talk to friends throughout her life about her reasons for retiring, she told Swedish biographer Sven Broman four years before her death [...] "I was tired of Hollywood. I did not like my work. There were many days when I had to <b>force</b> <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> go to the studio… I really wanted to live another life." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{motivation}} of the German soldiers tumbled. [...] "Now there is disappointment, {{and it is}} huge", Thaer wrote in April 1918, [...] "This is why even assaults, even when well-prepared with artillery attacks, fizzled {{out as soon as}} our infantry reached the heavily pummeled zone". [...] Until the German army's failed Spring offensive the German army was not as badly affected by [...] "flight from the flag" [...] (desertion) as the entente armies, however. [...] Initially, during the 1918 spring offensive, German troop motivation and morale surged, only crumbling again after the offensive failed. [...] Thaer commented in his diary, [...] "personally I had to <b>force</b> <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> the conviction that the troops now operated under a crushing burden of disappointment. [...] The attacking spirit of 21 March and the days that followed which I experienced to the south of Arras 4- 6 weeks ago was no longer there. ... It is clear to every company commander and every battery commander, and indeed to every musketeer and gunner, that hope has been shattered ... For the weaker characters there are already bad consequences: [...] general overload (Allgemeine Drückebergerei) ...".|$|E

60|$|While he {{uttered the}} last words, I felt my self-possession returning. I could not <b>force</b> <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> speak, as I would fain have spoken--I could only move away, to leave him.|$|E
6000|$|... "It was {{different}} then," [...] he explained. [...] "I was scared--badly scared--but I felt I {{could do the}} thing if I <b>forced</b> <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> it. Now I'm almost certain that I can't." ...|$|R
6000|$|The Secretary as {{suddenly}} brightened, and returned: 'Upon my honour I had no thought but for you. I <b>forced</b> <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> be constrained, lest you might misinterpret my being more natural. There. It's gone.' ...|$|R
60|$|So far I had <b>forced</b> <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> {{listen to}} him. At those last words {{the picture of}} the future that he was placing before me became too hideous to be endured. I refused to hear more.|$|R
6000|$|... 'We'll go together,' {{repeated}} Lagnier. 'You {{shall see}} how soon I will <b>force</b> <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> be recognised as a gentleman, and you shall profit by it. It is agreed? Are we one?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "After all, it's not my fault. I can't <b>force</b> <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> believe. If {{there is}} a God after all and he punishes me because I {{honestly}} don't believe in Him I can't help it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... (Village of Treen, October 22nd.)--The {{events of}} this one day have changed the whole future of my life. I must <b>force</b> <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> write of them at once. Something warns me that if I delay, though only till to-morrow, I shall be {{incapable}} of relating them at all.|$|E
60|$|When my lips had parted, and had shaped {{some words}} that were without sound, I <b>forced</b> <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> tell him (though I could not do it distinctly), that I had been chosen to succeed to some property.|$|R
6000|$|... "Because I'm a coward--a {{natural born}} coward--and I {{can have a}} lot of fun <b>forcing</b> <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> face the shell and shrapnel. That's the truth; I'm not a liar. And for a long time I've been wondering--wondering--" [...] His voice died away in a murmur.|$|R
6000|$|... "The young lady," [...] said I, <b>forcing</b> <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> assume {{an air of}} pleasantry, which, I believe, became me {{extremely}} ill, [...] "would {{perhaps have}} been inclined {{to look a little}} lower on the family-tree, for the branch to which she was desirous of clinging." ...|$|R
60|$|Andr. I cannot, for my hand obeys me not; But, as in slumbers, when we fain {{would run}} From our {{imagined}} fears, our idle feet Grow to the ground, our struggling voice dies inward; So now, when I would <b>force</b> <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> chear you, My faltering tongue can give no glad presage: Alas, I am no more Andromache.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, now, Aunt Roxy," [...] said Mara, [...] "at any rate, it's {{a relief}} to speak out to some one. It's {{more than two months}} that I have felt every day more and more that there was no hope,--life has hung on me like a weight. I have had to make myself keep up, and make myself do everything, and no one knows how it has tried me. I am so tired all the time, I could cry; and yet when I go to bed nights I can't sleep, I lie in such a hot, restless way; and then before morning I am drenched with cold sweat, and feel so weak and wretched. I <b>force</b> <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> eat, and I <b>force</b> <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> talk and laugh, and it's all pretense; and it wears me out,--it would be better if I stopped trying,--it would be better to give up and act as weak as I feel; but how can I let them know?" ...|$|E
60|$|The more I {{thought of}} it the more certain I became {{that he had made}} a little too much noise with his oars as he rowed away. So I remained, lying in the mud and shivering. I shivered till the muscles of the small of my back ached and pained me as badly as the cold, and I had need of all my {{self-control}} to <b>force</b> <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> remain in my miserable situation.|$|E
60|$|Then I <b>forced</b> <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> {{take part}} in conversation, {{speaking}} {{of this or that}} trouble or adventure in the past; but never once of what might be before us in the future, and thus the time passed until we believed we were warranted in setting forth.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Bess, {{the fact}} is I've been dreaming a lot. This valley makes a fellow dream. So I <b>forced</b> <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> think. We can't live this way much longer. Soon I'll simply {{have to go to}} Cottonwoods. We need a whole pack train of supplies. I can get--" ...|$|R
60|$|It {{was hard}} to give up {{pursuing}} the inquiry to that final point, but I <b>forced</b> <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> abandon all idea of continuing it.

6000|$|In {{concern for}} her embarrassment, he hastens to relieve it, but, without seeming so to do. [...] "It is very solitary for a brother here," [...] eying the showy ladies brocaded in the background, [...] "I find none to mingle souls with. It may be wrong--I know it is--but I cannot <b>force</b> <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> be easy {{with the people}} of the world. I prefer the company, however silent, of a brother or sister in good standing. By the way, madam, may I ask if you have confidence?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You may cheat {{me out of}} my thoughts, but it will be to no good. Whether I lie or {{tell the}} truth, I will do my duty by him. There will be no lying. To {{the best of my ability}} I will love him, and him only. All my care shall be for him. I have resolved, and I will <b>force</b> <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> love him. All his qualities are good. There is not a thought in his mind of which he need be ashamed." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{words that}} passed between us were few and puerile in regard of the situation. I had to <b>force</b> <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> look {{them in the}} face. I {{expected}} to meet reproachful glances. There were none. The expression of suffering in their eyes was indeed hard enough to bear. But that they couldn't help. For the rest, I ask myself {{whether it was the}} temper of their souls or the sympathy of their imagination that made them so wonderful, so worthy of my undying regard.|$|E
6000|$|... "One evening {{coming in}} with a candle I was startled to hear him say a little tremulously, 'I am lying here in the dark waiting for death.' The light was within a foot of his eyes. I <b>forced</b> <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> murmur, 'Oh, nonsense!' and stood over him as if transfixed.|$|R
60|$|Such moods {{were to come}} to {{me again}} and again, and {{particularly}} during the inactivities of voyages and in large empty spaces and at night when I was weary. At other times I could banish and overcome them by <b>forcing</b> <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> be busy and by going to see novel and moving things.|$|R
5000|$|Brown {{had lost}} {{focus on the}} book: [...] "For maybe half a year I'd been <b>forcing</b> <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> work on Underwater {{despite the fact that}} I had lost my way.

60|$|Her {{letters were}} always admirable, but I do most deeply regret that what {{made one of}} their {{greatest}} charms unfits them for the public--I mean their personal details. Mr. Harness sends to me for letters, and when I bring them up, and with the greatest pain <b>force</b> <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> examine them (all those letters she wrote to me in her warm goodness and affectionateness), I find with wonder and sorrow how only a half-page here {{and there could be}} submitted to general readers--could, with any decency, much less delicacy.|$|E
6000|$|VALENTINE (with a stir {{of feeling}} {{beginning}} to agitate his voice). Of course not: I'm not such an idiot. And yet my heart tells me I should---my fool of a heart. But I'll argue {{with my heart}} {{and bring it to}} reason. If I loved you a thousand times, I'll <b>force</b> <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> look the truth steadily in the face. After all, it's easy to be sensible: the facts are the facts. What's this place? it's not heaven: it's the Marine Hotel. What's the time? it's not eternity: it's about half past one in the afternoon. What am I? a dentist---a five shilling dentist! ...|$|E
60|$|As for me, I daily wished more {{to please}} him; {{but to do}} so, I felt daily more and more that I must disown half my nature, stifle half my faculties, wrest my tastes from their {{original}} bent, <b>force</b> <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> the adoption of pursuits for which I had no natural vocation. He wanted to train me to an elevation I could never reach; it racked me hourly to aspire to the standard he uplifted. The thing was as impossible as to mould my irregular features to his correct and classic pattern, to give to my changeable green eyes the sea-blue tint and solemn lustre of his own.|$|E
60|$|I {{did not see}} the end of the battle. I <b>forced</b> <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> endure it as long as I could, but it was too pitiful a sight; so I made frank {{confession}} to that effect, and we retired. We heard afterward that the black cock died in the ring, and fighting to the last.|$|R
60|$|A queer world! thought I even then--to you now it {{must seem}} impossibly queer,--and after an {{interval}} I <b>forced</b> <b>myself</b> back <b>to</b> my own affair.|$|R
6000|$|... "Come, Frank, be true with me. I am <b>forcing</b> <b>myself</b> <b>to</b> speak {{truth to}} you. I think that {{between you and}} me, at any rate, {{there should be no}} words spoken that are not true. Frank, you know where my heart is." [...] As she said this, she stood over him, and laid her hand upon his shoulder. [...] "Will you answer me one question?" ...|$|R
