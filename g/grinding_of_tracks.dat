40|$|Noise {{monitoring}} results over 2004 for the A 2 motorway in the Netherlands have remained practically unchanged. At the A 10 motorway, {{a slight increase}} in average noise emissions was found, possibly due an increase in road surface wear and tear. The results for the N 256 motorway in 2004 showed a discrepancy in measured and calculated noise emissions for all vehicle categories. This discrepancy will require further investigation into its cause. Any reduction of railway noise, in the period 2000 - 2004, due to <b>grinding</b> <b>of</b> the <b>tracks</b> could not be found in the measurements along the railway line from Utrecht to Amsterdam. In addition to the above measurements, noise levels along the railway line from Delft to Schiedam were measured from February to June 2004. Overall, measurement results agree well with calculated levels, but in some cases the actual classification of trains in various acoustic categories may need adjustment. At Volkel Military Airbase, an increase in measured noise levels seems to be consistent with a higher number of observed aircraft passages. Calculated results from the National Aerospace Laboratory also showed an increase in 2004, but remained below the measured noise level. These all represent the main results of an RIVM noise monitoring programme aimed at monitoring noise trends important to environmental quality, both in urban and rural areas. This programme has been operational since 1999. In the framework of the programme, continuous noise measurements were made at the three highway locations, A 2, A 10 and N 256, along the Utrecht?Amsterdam and Delft?Schiedam railway trajectories, and at the Volkel airbase...|$|R

40|$|Grinding {{has always}} been a high energy {{expenditure}} process, which generally produce massive grinding heat and possibly produce thermal damage in workpiece ground surface. Therefore, a good understanding <b>of</b> <b>grinding</b> temperature characteristics is important to lower the thermal effect on the workpiece quality. However, the grinding temperature characteristic differs when <b>grinding</b> <b>of</b> different materials, especially for those hard-to-machine materials (eg. Titanium alloys and ceramics). Therefore, this paper is devoted to investigate different grinding temperature characteristics for metallic materials and brittle materials. In order to detect the grinding temperature, a grindable thermocouple technique with NI-DAQ device is adopted in diamond wheel <b>grinding</b> <b>of</b> ceramics and CBN <b>grinding</b> <b>of</b> Titanium alloys. The results show that the temperature characteristics for ceramics is totally different with Titanium alloys. When the grinding wheel speed increases, the grinding temperature increases all the way when <b>grinding</b> <b>of</b> Titanium alloys. However, there is a temperature turning point for <b>grinding</b> <b>of</b> ceramics. When the wheel speed surpasses the turning point, the grinding temperature goes down and closes at a relatively low temperature...|$|R

40|$|Milling or <b>grinding</b> <b>of</b> {{cereal grains}} to produce flour is {{frequently}} accompanied by damage to starch granules, disruption of starch crystalline structure, and degradation of starch molecules.
