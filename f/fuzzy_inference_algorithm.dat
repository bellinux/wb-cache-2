30|$|Another {{interesting}} approach {{based on}} weather type classification and similar day detection to forecast PV power for a horizon {{up to one}} day is used in [8] where authors use a Recurrent Neural Network with structural elements for 24 -h ahead PV power output forecasting. The inputs used include clear sky irradiation and forecasting weather type for the forecast days. In [31] the historical power output is classified into several weather types using forecast irradiation, total cloud and low cloud cover as parameters selection; the authors uses RBFNN as a technique to produce PV Power forecasts with 24 -h ahead horizon. In [12] forecasts of high, medium and low temperatures are used to classify historical PV power output into three weather types. After that, three feed forward neural networks (FFNN) were employed to generate 24 -h ahead forecasts. In [35], the authors present a hybrid method to forecast 1 -day ahead PV power output; the proposed method comprises three stages: data classification stage, training stage and forecasting stage. The classification stage is developed using self organizing map (SOM) and learning vector quantization (LVQ); {{the objective is to}} classify the historical PV power data into five weather types according to the verbal weather forecast of the TCWB (Taiwan Center Weather Bureau). In the second stage, support vector regression (SVR) is used to construct five forecasting models—one for each weather type.

40|$|Monthly {{rainfall}} spatial interpolation is {{an important}} task in hydrological study to comprehensively observe the spatial distribution of the monthly rainfall variable in the study area. A number of spatial interpolation methods have been successfully applied to perform this task. However, those methods mainly aim at achieving satisfactory interpolation accuracy and they disregard the interpolation interpretability. Without interpretability, human analysts {{will not be able}} to gain insight of the model of the spatial data. This paper proposes an alternative approach to achieve both accuracy and interpretability of the monthly rainfall spatial interpolation solution. A combination of <b>fuzzy</b> clustering, <b>fuzzy</b> <b>inference</b> system, genetic <b>algorithm</b> and modular technique has been used. The accuracy of the proposed method has been compared to the most commonly-used methods in geographic information systems as well as previously proposed method. The experimental results showed that the proposed model provided satisfactory interpolation accuracy in comparison with other methods. Besides, the interpretability of the proposed model could be achieved in both global and local perspectives. Human analysts may therefore understand the model from the derived model’s parameters and fuzzy rules...|$|R
