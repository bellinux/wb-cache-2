5|$|Established as St. John's College by John Hughes, then Bishop of New York, it {{was placed}} in the care of the Society of Jesus shortly thereafter, and has since become a Jesuit-affiliated {{independent}} school under a lay board of trustees. The college's first president, John McCloskey, was the first Catholic cardinal in the United States. While governed independently of the Church since 1969, <b>every</b> <b>president</b> of Fordham University since 1846 has been a Jesuit priest, and the curriculum remains influenced by Jesuit educational principles.|$|E
5|$|Postmaster General James Farley {{occupied}} two adjoining suites in {{the current}} Waldorf Astoria during his tenure {{as the chairman of}} the board of Coca-Cola's International division from 1940 until his death in 1976, arguably one of the landmark's longest housed tenants. The Presidential Suite at the hotel come from when, during the 1950s and early 1960s, former U.S. president Herbert Hoover and retired U.S. General Douglas MacArthur lived in suites on different floors of the hotel. Hoover lived at the Waldorf Astoria for over 30 years from after the end of his presidency until he died in 1964; former President Dwight D. Eisenhower lived there until he died in 1969. MacArthur's widow, Jean MacArthur, lived there from 1952 until her death in 2000. A plaque affixed to the wall on the 50th Street side commemorates this. John F. Kennedy was fond of the Waldorf Astoria and had a number of private meetings at the hotel, including one with Israeli Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion. Since Hoover, <b>every</b> <b>President</b> of the United States has either stayed over or lived in the Waldorf Astoria, although Jimmy Carter claimed to have never stayed overnight at the hotel. Nancy Reagan was reputedly not fond of the Presidential Suite.|$|E

Bush declined to send a wreath to the ceremony, citing infighting among Confederate groups. Bush declined to send a wreath again in 1991 and 1992. But President Bill Clinton resumed the tradition in 1993, and it was continued by his successor, President George W. Bush.|$|E

25|$|Though debt {{almost always}} {{increased}} under <b>every</b> <b>president</b> {{in the latter}} half of the 20th century, it declined as a percentage of GDP under all Presidents after 1950 and prior to Reagan. In addition to the fiscal deficits, the U.S. started to have large trade deficits. Also it was during his second term that the Tax Reform Act of 1986 was passed. Vice President George H. W. Bush was elected to succeed Reagan in 1988. The early Bush Presidency's economic policies were sometimes seen as a continuation of Reagan's policies, but in the early 1990s, Bush went back on a promise and increased taxes in a compromise with Congressional Democrats. He ended his presidency on a moderate note, signing regulatory bills such as the Americans With Disabilities Act, and negotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement. In 1992, Bush and third-party candidate Ross Perot lost to Democrat Bill Clinton.|$|E
