Saltfleet Township was surveyed from November 14, 1788 to December 25, 1788 and Binbrook Township was surveyed from December 24, 1788 until February 12, 1789. All of these townships were surveyed using the Front and Rear system, except Binbrook, which was surveyed with the Single <b>Front</b> <b>system.</b> During this time, Frey had assigned two other surveyors to lead surveys in the Nassau district. Daniel Hazen and Jesse Pawling both led teams, but neither group was {{as busy as}} Jones' group. Hazen's group surveyed only four townships, and incompletely, and Pawling's three, also incompletely.

Local withdrawals {{according to the}} concept of elastic defence, was rejected by Loßberg the new 4th Army Chief of Staff, who believed that they would disorganise troops moving forward to counter-attack. Front line troops were not expected to cling to shelters, which were man traps but evacuate them as soon as the battle began and move forward and to the flanks to avoid British fire and to counter-attack. A small number of machine-gun nests and permanent garrisons were separate from the counter-attack organisation, to provide a framework for the re-establishment of defence in depth once an attack had been repulsed. German infantry equipment had recently been improved by the arrival of thirty-six MG08/15 machine-guns per regiment, which gave German units more means for fire and manoeuvre.|$|E
