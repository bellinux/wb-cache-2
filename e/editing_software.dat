It was coded using Chrono Trigger ROM <b>editing</b> <b>software,</b> and was meant to be played on a Super Nintendo Entertainment System emulator.

5|$|Eric Koretz {{served as}} {{director}} of photography; he joined the team during a shift in focus in January 2008. Koretz used a Panasonic AG-HPX500 P2 HD camcorder. He commented to industry publication Videography about the choice of technique, that due to {{the intensity of the}} production team's travel schedule tape format would not have been an option. He stated he preferred using P2 cards over the HDD-based format due to its superior reliability. During the editing process, Glen Echo Entertainment utilized eight Apple Macintosh computers with Intel processors, equipped with Apple's Final Cut Pro <b>editing</b> <b>software.</b>|$|E

5|$|The high-definition upgrade {{was not as}} {{difficult}} as it might have been as all the art assets had been created in high definition and reduced for the PS2 hardware. Other aspects for the visuals, such as character faces, needed to be redrawn by Kamitani as they remained in low definition. There were also graphic elements remade as the team considered them to be rather poor quality when compared to their current work. Added shadow effects were created, but special parameters needed to be set as there were no 3D environments to use as reference. The 2D perspective also meant that the way enemies behaved needed to be adjusted, so they would not attack the player character while still off screen. In general, the overall graphical quality was improved, the resolution was increased, and the aspect ratio was changed from the original 4:3 to 16:9. The shift to 16:9 meant that character models needed to be re-positioned so as not to leave blank spaces {{on either side of the}} central scene. As they needed to analyse the original software to make such changes but had lost the original software used to create the cutscenes, they needed to hurriedly create alternate <b>editing</b> <b>software</b> that ran on a PC. In addition to changes to scenery and model positioning, the text font was resized to match the larger screen and the text bubbles were smoothed out.|$|E
5|$|Two researchers, Chris Bennett (1996) and David Peters (2000), {{have found}} pterosaurs to be protorosaurs or {{closely related to}} them. Peters used a {{technique}} called DGS, which involves applying the digital tracing features of photo <b>editing</b> <b>software</b> to images of pterosaur fossils. Bennett only recovered pterosaurs as close relatives of the protorosaurs after removing characteristics of the hind limb from his analysis, {{in an attempt to}} test the idea that these characters are the result of convergent evolution between pterosaurs and dinosaurs. However, subsequent analysis by Dave Hone and Michael Benton (2007) could not reproduce this result. Hone and Benton found pterosaurs to be closely related to dinosaurs even without hind limb characters. They also criticized previous studies by David Peters, raising questions about whether conclusions reached without access to the primary evidence, that is, pterosaur fossils, can be held to have the same weight as conclusions based strictly on first-hand interpretation. Hone and Benton concluded that, although more primitive pterosauromorphs are needed to clarify their relationships, pterosaurs are best considered archosaurs, and specifically ornithodirans, given current evidence. In Hone and Benton's analysis, pterosaurs are either the sister group of Scleromochlus or fall between it and Lagosuchus on the ornithodiran family tree. Sterling Nesbitt (2011) found strong support for a clade composed of Scleromochlus and pterosaurs.|$|E

25|$|Though the backmasking {{controversy}} {{peaked in}} the 1980s, the general belief in subliminal manipulation became more {{widespread in the}} United States during the following decade, with belief in Satanic backmasking on records persisting into the 1990s. At the same time, the development of sound <b>editing</b> <b>software</b> with audio reversal features simplified the process of reversing audio, which previously could only be done with full fidelity using a professional tape recorder. The Sound Recorder utility, included with Microsoft Windows from Windows 95 to Windows XP, allows one-click audio reversal, as does popular open source sound <b>editing</b> <b>software</b> Audacity. Following {{the growth of the}} Internet, backmasked message searchers used such software to create websites featuring backward music samples, which became a widely used method of exploring backmasking in popular music.|$|E
25|$|Imaginary Realism {{is a term}} first {{coined by}} Dutch painter Carel Willink as a pendant of magic realism.

With the increasing availability of photo <b>editing</b> <b>software,</b> also art photographers like Karl Hammer and others create artistic works in this genre.|$|E

25|$|High-pass and {{low-pass}} filters {{are also used}} in digital image processing to perform image modifications, enhancements, noise reduction, etc., using designs done in either the spatial domain or the frequency domain. The unsharp masking, or sharpening, operation used in image <b>editing</b> <b>software</b> is a high-boost filter, a generalization of high-pass. A high-pass filter, if the imaging software does not provide one, {{can be achieved by}} duplicating the image, applying a Gaussian blur to the dupe, inverting the colors, and blending the images using a low opacity (say 50%) for the dupe.|$|E
25|$|Playing & <b>editing</b> <b>software</b> often {{contains}} tag editing functionality, {{but there}} are also tag editor applications dedicated to the purpose. Aside from metadata pertaining to the audio content, tags may also be used for DRM. ReplayGain is a standard for measuring and storing the loudness of an MP3 file (audio normalization) in its metadata tag, enabling a ReplayGain-compliant player to automatically adjust the overall playback volume for each file. MP3Gain may be used to reversibly modify files based on ReplayGain measurements so that adjusted playback can be achieved on players without ReplayGain capability.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} the following interpolation problem. Suppose one is given a finite set E ⊂R^d, a function f: E →R, and possibly the gradients of f at the points of E. We want to interpolate the given information with a function F ∈ C^ 1, 1 (R^d) with the minimum possible value of Lip (∇ F). We present practical, efficient algorithms for constructing an F such that Lip (∇ F) is minimal, or for less computational effort, within a small dimensionless constant of being minimal.

25|$|A natural {{development}} from digital delay-processing hardware was {{the appearance of}} software-based delay systems. In large part, this coincided with the popularity of both professional and consumer audio <b>editing</b> <b>software.</b> Software delays, in many cases, offer much greater flexibility than even the most recent digital hardware delays. Abundant system memory on modern personal computers offers practically limitless storage for the audio buffer, and the natural efficiency of audio delay algorithms has made the implementation trivial for delays offering shifting or random delay times, or the insertion of other audio effects during the feedback process. Many authors of software plugins have added functionality to emulate {{the sounds of the}} earlier analog units.|$|E
25|$|Many photographers {{continue}} to produce some monochrome images, sometimes {{because of the}} established archival permanence of well-processed silver-halide-based materials. Some full-color digital images are processed {{using a variety of}} techniques to create black-and-white results, and some manufacturers produce digital cameras that exclusively shoot monochrome. Monochrome printing or electronic display can be used to salvage certain photographs taken in color which are unsatisfactory in their original form; sometimes when presented as black-and-white or single-color-toned images they are found to be more effective. Although color photography has long predominated, monochrome images are still produced, mostly for artistic reasons. Almost all digital cameras have an option to shoot in monochrome, and almost all image <b>editing</b> <b>software</b> can combine or selectively discard RGB color channels to produce a monochrome image from one shot in color.|$|E
