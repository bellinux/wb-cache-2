5|$|Charlton {{was limited}} to 25 {{appearances}} in the 1972–73 campaign and suffered an injury in the FA Cup semi-final against Wolves which ended his season. After failing to regain his <b>fitness</b> <b>for</b> the final, he announced his retirement. Madeley played in his place but Gordon McQueen had been signed as his long-term replacement. He played his testimonial against Celtic, and was given £28,000 of the £40,000 matchday takings.|$|E
5|$|Once aposematic {{individuals}} reach {{a certain}} threshold population, for whatever reason, the predator learning process would be {{spread out over}} {{a larger number of}} individuals and therefore is less likely to wipe out the trait for warning colouration completely. If the population of aposematic individuals all originated from the same few individuals, the predator learning process would result in a stronger warning signal for surviving kin, resulting in higher inclusive <b>fitness</b> <b>for</b> the dead or injured individuals through kin selection.|$|E

His performances {{for the club}} led to him being named the Football Writers' Association Footballer of the Year for that season. On the international scene, England had failed {{to qualify for the}} 1994 World Cup finals, but Shearer added three more goals to his international tally before embarking on his most successful domestic season as a player to date.|$|E

5|$|The {{arterial}} bubble assumption {{can introduce}} {{variability in the}} decompression outcome through the lung function. The first variable is individual susceptibility. The filtering capacity of the lung may be assumed to vary between individuals, and for a given individual, from day to day, and {{may account for the}} inter-personal and intra-persona variability which have been observed in DCS susceptibility. Basically, a good diver is a good bubble filter. This is a justification for divers who seek top physical <b>fitness</b> <b>for</b> severe decompression exposures.|$|E
5|$|In his ministerial role, Constantine {{promoted}} {{development of}} Trinidad's road, rail, {{water and electricity}} infrastructure. However, in late 1958 {{he was accused of}} corruption, over a ship leasing deal. His angry response to the charge, in the Legislative Council, created a perception of arrogance among his colleagues, and suggested that he had not sufficiently adapted to parliamentary politics. According to Mason, the speech was a miscalculation which made the public, perhaps already sceptical of his commitment to Trinidad after so many years away, question his <b>fitness</b> <b>for</b> a ministerial role, a view increasingly held by commentators.|$|E
5|$|Robben {{proved to}} be a crucial player for the 2004–05 season; in November 2004, he was awarded the FA Premier League Player of the Month award. Robben ended the 2004–05 season with seven goals, his second highest {{professional}} total. He was shortlisted for the PFA Young Player of the Year, but was beaten by Manchester United's Wayne Rooney. Robben was badly injured in a Premier League match away to Blackburn Rovers and forced to sit out Chelsea's title run-in and progress to the semi-finals of the UEFA Champions League. Back to <b>fitness</b> <b>for</b> 2005–06, Robben {{was an integral part of}} the Chelsea left wing. In 28matches, Robben contributed six goals as Chelsea won a second consecutive Premier League championship, the first back-to-back titles for the west London club.|$|E

5|$|Djokovic and Murray {{appeared}} in their seventh and fourth Masters final and 19th and 17th career finals respectively. Djokovic led the head-to-head tally against Murray, but Murray {{had won the}} last two encounters between them. In the match, Murray moved into a 4–0 lead in the first set. Djokovic improved his serve from that point but lost the set. A role reversal in the second set saw Djokovic move into a 4–1 lead. Murray fought back, however, to level the score to 5–5 and won the set to secure the victory. This was Murray's third title win {{of the season and}} eleventh of his career. It was also his third Masters win of the career. Murray credited his improved <b>fitness</b> <b>for</b> his win. Djokovic, who had struggled with excessive heat in the past, struggled once again to assimilate with the temperature. He admitted that he was impatient early in the match, which resulted in him making too many unforced errors.|$|E
5|$|Kohli {{returned}} to the national team replacing the injured Gambhir in Indian squad for the tri-series in Sri Lanka. He batted at number 4 for India in the 2009 ICC Champions Trophy because of an injury to Yuvraj Singh. In the inconsequential group match against the West Indies, Kohli scored an unbeaten 79 in India's successful chase of 130 and won his first man of the match award. Kohli played as a reserve batsman in the seven-match home ODI series against Australia, appearing in two matches as injury replacement. He found {{a place in the}} home ODI series against Sri Lanka in December 2009 and scored 27 and 54 in the first two ODIs before making way for Yuvraj who regained <b>fitness</b> <b>for</b> the third ODI. However, Yuvraj's finger injury recurred leading to him being ruled out indefinitely. Kohli {{returned to}} the team in the fourth ODI at Kolkata and scored his first ODI century–107 off 111 balls–sharing a 224-run partnership for the third wicket with Gambhir who made his personal best score of 150. India won by seven wickets to seal the series 3–1. The man of the match was awarded to Gambhir who gave the award to Kohli.|$|E
5|$|On 22 June 2005, Gilberto {{played in}} Brazil's 1–1 draw against Japan, in his only {{game of the}} 2005 FIFA Confederations Cup. His absence as a first team regular could be {{explained}} by his lack of games, and thus match <b>fitness,</b> <b>for</b> Arsenal during the season leading up to the tournament. Gilberto's appearance in the tournament gained him a winners medal, as Brazil {{went on to win the}} competition. On the back of his good Champions League form, Gilberto was selected for the Brazil national football team for the 2006 FIFA World Cup. Gilberto was substituted on in two games, and started twice due to another injury to Emerson. Brazil were beaten 1–0 by France in the quarter final. Following Brazil's World Cup disappointment, midfielder Juninho called for the older members of the Brazil squad (including Gilberto) to retire from international football. On the back of Gilberto's childhood idol Dunga being appointed Brazil coach, Gilberto did not take Juninho's advice, and subsequently continued his international career.|$|E

5|$|Racism, {{especially}} antisemitism, was {{a central}} feature of the regime. The Germanic peoples (the Nordic race) were considered by the Nazis to be the purest branch of the Aryan race and were therefore viewed as the master race. Millions of Jews and other peoples deemed undesirable by the state were murdered in the Holocaust. Opposition to Hitler's rule was ruthlessly suppressed. Members of the liberal, socialist and communist opposition were killed, imprisoned or exiled. Christian churches were also oppressed, with many leaders imprisoned. Education focused on racial biology, population policy, and <b>fitness</b> <b>for</b> military service. Career and educational opportunities for women were curtailed. Recreation and tourism were organised via the Strength Through Joy program and the 1936 Summer Olympics showcased the Third Reich on the international stage. Propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels made effective use of film, mass rallies and Hitler's hypnotic oratory to influence public opinion. The government controlled artistic expression, promoting specific art forms and banning or discouraging others.|$|E
5|$|Somervell {{returned}} to Washington Barracks {{to attend the}} Engineer School but his course was interrupted by the declaration of war by the United States on Germany on 6 April 1917. The course was abruptly terminated and Somervell, along with hundreds of other junior officers, was ordered to appear before an examination board that would determine his <b>fitness</b> <b>for</b> promotion. Following a favorable report from the board, Somervell was promoted to captain on 15 May 1917. He helped organize the 15th Engineers, a rail transport unit, at Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In July 1917 this became the first engineer regiment to be sent overseas, arriving in England in July 1917 and France later that month. The 15th Engineers worked on a several construction projects, including a munitions dump at Mehun-sur-Yèvre and an advanced depot and regulating station at Is-sur-Tille. Somervell got his projects completed by working his men around the clock and deploying every available resource regardless of the cost. For his role, Somervell was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal.|$|E
5|$|By mid-1944, {{the five}} 'Lower Establishment' {{divisions}} allocated to home defence duties (the 38th (Welsh), the 45th, the 47th (London), the 55th (West Lancashire), and the 61st) had a combined total of 17,845 men. Of this number, around 13,000 were available as replacements for the 21st Army Group fighting in France. The remaining 4,800 men were considered ineligible {{at that time}} for service abroad {{for a variety of}} reasons, including a lack of training or being medically unfit. Over the following six months, up to 75 per cent of these men would be deployed to reinforce 21st Army Group following the completion of their training and certification of <b>fitness.</b> <b>For</b> example, those eligible for overseas service from the 9th Battalion, Worcestershire Regiment were transferred to 21st Army Group. The battalion was then tasked with training those who were considered unfit, re-training soldiers who had recovered from wounds, and training men from anti-aircraft units to become infantry. On 18 July, HQ Residue Concentration Area reverted to its former infantry role. Two days later, the brigade staff of 184th Infantry Brigade became the headquarters of 183rd Infantry Brigade and likewise the headquarters staff of the 183rd became HQ 184th Infantry Brigade. In August, the 4th Northamptonshire was transferred to Force 135 that was planning to end the German occupation of the Channel Islands. Such an attack did not materialize, and the entire force was transferred to Europe to reinforce the 21st Army Group. On 1 September, the 184th Infantry Brigade (while remaining part of the division) was transferred to the Orkney and Shetland Islands for a two-month stint as the defensive garrison. Over the remainder of the year, and into 1945 the makeup of the division changed. However, the role of the division remained the same. For example, the 4th Battalion, Devonshire Regiment role was to find drafts for other battalions fighting overseas.|$|E
