40|$|Abstract: Statistical {{models of}} {{deformations}} (SMD) capture {{the variability of}} deformations from the template image onto a group of sample images {{and can be used}} to constrain the traditional <b>deformable</b> <b>registration</b> algorithms to improve their robustness and accuracy. This paper employs a wavelet-PCA-based SMD to constrain the traditional <b>deformable</b> <b>registration</b> based on the Bayesian framework. The template image is adaptively warped by an intermediate deformation field generated based on the SMD during the registration procedure, and the traditional <b>deformable</b> <b>registration</b> is performed to register the intermediate template image with the input subject image. Since the intermediate template image is much more similar to the subject image, and the deformation is relatively small and local, it is less likely to be stuck into undesired local minimum using the same <b>deformable</b> <b>registration</b> in this framework. Experiments show that the proposed statistically-constrained <b>deformable</b> <b>registration</b> framework is more robust and accurate than the conventional registration...|$|E

Many <b>deformable</b> <b>registration</b> methods minimize sum of squared difference (SSD) as the registration cost {{with respect to}} deformable model parameters.

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. The <b>deformable</b> image <b>registration</b> {{is central}} to many {{challenges}} in medical imaging applications. The basic idea of the <b>deformable</b> image <b>registration</b> problem is to find an approximation of a reasonable deformation which transforms one image to match another based on a chosen similarity measure. A reasonable deformation {{can be thought of}} as one that is physically realizable. A number of models, guaranteeing reasonable deformations, have been proposed and implemented with success under various similarity measures. One such model is based on the grid deformation method (GDM) and is the method of interest in this thesis. This work focuses on the evaluation of an optimal control-based model for solving the <b>deformable</b> image <b>registration</b> problem which is formulated using GDM. This model is compared with other four well-known variational-based <b>deformable</b> image <b>registration</b> models: elastic, fluid, diffusion and curvature models. Using similarity and deformation quality measures as performance indices, the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) is applied to approximate the Pareto fronts for each model to facilitate proper evaluation.

Further optimization and validation is necessary due to the inaccuracies observed in this study. The propagated align algorithm provides the shell for performing <b>deformable</b> image <b>registration,</b> in this case, using the elastix toolbox.

40|$|Over {{the past}} 20 years, {{the field of}} medical image {{registration}} has significantly advanced from multi-modal image fusion to highly non-linear, <b>deformable</b> image <b>registration</b> {{for a wide range}} of medical applications and imaging modalities, involving the compensation and analysis of physiological organ motion or of tissue changes due to growth or disease patterns. While the original focus of image registration has predominantly been on correcting for rigid-body motion of brain image volumes acquired at different scanning sessions, often with different modalities, the advent of dedicated longitudinal and cross-sectional brain studies soon necessitated the development of more sophisticated methods that are able to detect and measure local structural or functional changes, or group differences. Moving outside of the brain, cine imaging and dynamic imaging required the development of <b>deformable</b> image <b>registration</b> to directly measure or compensate for local tissue motion.

To achieve rapid {{automated}} delineation {{of gross}} target volume (GTV) and to quantify changes in volume/position {{of the target}} for radiotherapy planning using four-dimensional (4 D) CT. Methods and Materials. Novel morphological processing and successive localization (MPSL) algorithms were designed and implemented for achieving autosegmentation. Contours automatically generated using MPSL method were compared with contours generated using state-of-the-art <b>deformable</b> <b>registration</b> methods (using Elastix© and MIMVista software). Metrics such as the Dice similarity coefficient, sensitivity, and positive predictive value (PPV) were analyzed. The target motion tracked using the centroid of the GTV estimated using MPSL method was compared with motion tracked using <b>deformable</b> <b>registration</b> methods. Results. MPSL algorithm segmented the GTV in 4 DCT images in 27. 0 ± 11. 1 seconds per phase (512 × 512 resolution) as compared to 142. 3 ± 11. 3 seconds per phase for <b>deformable</b> <b>registration</b> based methods in 9 cases.

Material and methodsThe 19 patients included in this study, all had 7 – 10 repeat CT-scans available that were rigidly aligned with the planning CT-scan using intra-prostatic implanted markers, followed by <b>deformable</b> <b>registrations.</b> The displacement vectors from the <b>deformable</b> <b>registrations</b> were used to create patient-specific statistical motion models. The models were applied in treatment simulations to determine probabilities for adequate target coverage, e. g. by establishing distributions of the accumulated dose to 99 % of the target volumes (D 99) for various CTV–PTV expansions in the planning-CTs. ResultsThe method allowed for estimation of the expected accumulated dose and its variance of different DVH parameters for each patient. Simulations of inter-fractional motion resulted in 7, 10, and 18 patients with an average D 99 > 95 % of the prescribed dose for CTV-p expansions of 3 mm, 4 mm and 5 mm, respectively.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (p. 48) Lung {{cancer is}} the most rampant killer among cancer types, taking more American lives per year than automobile accidents. This staggering annual death toll, along with our citizenry's unwillingness to cease smoking, has lead to a research emphasis on lung cancer treatment techniques. Real-time treatment of a lung tumor requires accurate tracking of both the Planning Target Volume and the nearby healthy radiosensitive tissues. An imaging modality called 4 DCT (Four-Dimensional Computed Tomography) provides accurate tracking by taking a 3 D image of the lungs at each phase of the breathing cycle. Once these images are taken, a method is required to link the many phases together and track changes between them. This method is called Image Registration. Standard techniques of Image Registration track these changes using rigid motions. Lungs move in a more complicated fashion than rigid methods can handle. A more detailed form of <b>registration,</b> <b>Deformable</b> Image <b>Registration,</b> is required for 4 DCT tracking. Many <b>deformable</b> image <b>registration</b> algorithms exist. One must be chosen. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to experimentally compare four well-studied <b>deformable</b> image <b>registration</b> algorithms (Horn-Schunk Optical Flow, Thirion's Demons, and Yang's Inverse-Consistent versions of each) as they apply to 4 DCT DICOM lung images.

The face recognition problem is formulated as groupwise <b>deformable</b> image <b>registration</b> and feature matching problem. The main {{contributions of the}} proposed method lie in the following aspects: (1) Each pixel in a facial image is represented by an anatomical signature obtained from its corresponding most salient scale local region determined by the survival exponential entropy (SEE) information theoretic measure. (2) Based on the anatomical signature calculated from each pixel, a novel Markov random field based groupwise registration framework is proposed to formulate the face recognition problem as a feature guided <b>deformable</b> image <b>registration</b> problem. The similarity between different facial images are measured on the nonlinear Riemannian manifold based on the deformable transformations. (3) The proposed method does not suffer from the generalizability problem which exists commonly in learning based algorithms. The proposed method has been extensively evaluated on four publicly available databases: FERET, CAS-PEAL-R 1, FRGC ver 2. 0, and the LFW.

40|$|Purpose: To {{validate}} {{and compare}} the <b>deformable</b> image <b>registration</b> and parotid contour propagation process for head and neck magnetic resonance imaging in patients treated with radiotherapy using 3 different approaches—the commercial MIM, the open-source Elastix software, and an optimized version of it. Materials and Methods: Twelve patients with head and neck cancer previously treated with radiotherapy were considered. <b>Deformable</b> image <b>registration</b> and parotid contour propagation were evaluated by considering the magnetic resonance images acquired {{before and after the}} end of the treatment. <b>Deformable</b> image <b>registration,</b> based on free-form deformation method, and contour propagation available on MIM were compared to Elastix. Two different contour propagation approaches were implemented for Elastix software, a conventional one (DIR_Trx) and an optimized homemade version, based on mesh deformation (DIR_Mesh). The accuracy of these 3 approaches was estimated by comparing propagated to manual contours in terms of average symmetric distance, maximum symmetric distance, Dice similarity coefficient, sensitivity, and inclusiveness. Results: A good agreement was generally found between the manual contours and the propagated ones, without differences among the 3 methods; in few critical cases with complex deformations, DIR_Mesh proved to be more accurate, having the lowest values of average symmetric distance and maximum symmetric distance and the highest value of Dice similarity coefficient, although nonsignificant. The average propagation errors with respect to the reference contours are lower than the voxel diagonal (2 mm), and Dice similarity coefficient is around 0. 8 for all 3 methods. Conclusion: The 3 free-form deformation approaches were not significantly different in terms of <b>deformable</b> image <b>registration</b> accuracy and can be safely adopted for the registration and parotid contour propagation during radiotherapy on magnetic resonance imaging.
