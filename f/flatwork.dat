50|$|Pervious {{concrete}} (also called porous concrete, permeable concrete, no fines {{concrete and}} porous pavement) {{is a special}} type of concrete with a high porosity used for concrete <b>flatwork</b> applications that allows water from precipitation and other sources to pass directly through, thereby reducing the runoff from a site and allowing groundwater recharge.|$|E

50|$|A common <b>flatwork</b> form has riser strips on top {{such that}} the screed is 3/8-1/2 in. (9 to 12 mm) above final {{pavement}} elevation. Mechanical screeds are preferable to manual. The riser strips are removed to guide compaction. Immediately after screeding, the concrete is compacted to improve the bond and smooth the surface. Excessive compaction of pervious concrete results in higher compressive strength, but lower porosity (and thus lower permeability).|$|E
50|$|Kuba art {{is celebrated}} for its {{decorative}} arts and surface designs. Personal and decorative artistry {{is expressed in}} <b>flatwork</b> - woven cloth or designs on mats and textiles - as well as three-dimensional objects - lidded bowls and boxes, cups, clysters, musical instruments, knives with decorated handles, and baskets. The exterior and interior surfaces of the raffia-walled homes of Kuba elites were also plated with intricate geometric patterning. This proclivity for surface design was shared across most media, including Kuba textiles and body scarification.|$|E
50|$|The {{stirrups}} are shortened {{from the}} length used for <b>flatwork,</b> adjusted {{according to the}} height of the fence. Grand Prix jumpers and eventers on cross-country generally need to shorten the stirrups the most, to allow them to gallop and jump in motion with their horse. The short stirrup provides more leverage and flexibility, and therefore security, better balance and a more secure position should the horse stumble, get a poor distance, or peck on landing. More importantly, a shorter stirrup allows the rider to get off the horse's back between and over the fence, freeing up the back and allowing the horse to bascule. The stirrup leather should remain perpendicular to the ground. The stirrup iron is usually placed on the ball of the foot, allowing the rider to have a flexible, shock-absorbing ankle. The rider should keep even pressure across the foot, rather than pushing on the inside or outside of the stirrup iron, as this makes the lower leg stiff.|$|E
5000|$|Equitation {{and show}} hunters are judged subjectively based on ability and form (of the rider) and elegance, cadence and style (of the horse). Equitation may be judged in one round, though often a [...] "work-off" [...] is {{included}} in which the top riders return for further testing that might consist of another round of jumping, <b>flatwork,</b> no stirrup work, or switching horses, for example. Hunter courses are generally judged in one round, but classics often include two rounds for the top competitors. In most horse shows, four over-fence rounds (one often containing a 25% conformation component) and one flat class make up each hunter section. The judge decides which combination has the smoothest round and displayed a ride most closely to the ideal. Certain mistakes like refusals will lead to drastic penalties, while minor errors like a soft rub on a rail are slightly penalized, at the judge's discretion. This can make judging difficult to follow for those new to showing until the subtle factors considered by the judge are better understood.|$|E
5000|$|In 1990, Harry N. Abrams (in the U.S.) and Thames & Hudson (in the U.K.) {{published}} {{the results of}} her research as The Mezzotint: History and Technique, reissued by Abrams in a soft-cover edition in 1996. Wax photographed all of the technical illustrations for that volume, as well {{as much of the}} <b>flatwork,</b> and produced the line drawings. In its two sections, Wax reviewed the history of mezzotint techniques and then detailed their use as a guide for contemporary artists in the craft. A lengthy review in Winterthur Portfolio noted it was the [...] "first comprehensive study of mezzotint...and the most significant discussion of the subject" [...] since a more narrowly focused 1884 study. It said that Wax brought [...] "a technician's attention to detail, an artist's sensitivity to the nuances of process, and a historian's interest in cause and effect" [...] to her work. It praised her exploitation of little-known German publications dating from 1771 and 1889 to expand on familiar historical accounts and her investigation of the impact of such technological developments as steel plates on the artist's technique, types of paper and ink, and the characteristics of the resulting images. Writing in Print Quarterly, Ellen D'Oench said that: [...] "the appearance of Carol Wax's book is an important event...not before now have we had access to an exhaustive treatment of mezzotint's history and process, enriched by copious and superb reproductions....Wax, a mezzotint artist herself, handles with skill a vast amount of information....She excels in her observations about individual prints...and in her selection of reproductions....Wax has a keen eye for the particulars and a broad knowledge of the subject....This is a triumph of word and image in the service of explication." ...|$|E

40|$|REASONS FOR PERFORMING STUDY: Training regimens of showjumping horses under field {{conditions}} are largely undocumented. OBJECTIVES: The aims {{of this study were}} to quantify and compare training regimens used in professional-level showjumping yards, with respect to time exercised and type of activity. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. METHODS: A prospective 6 -month cohort study of showjumping horses in 4 European countries (The Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland, Great Britain) was designed to analyse training and health data, in yards with several horses in training and riders competing at professional level. Riders documented the daily frequency and duration of all physical activities of the horses. Variation in training routines were compared between riders, location and time. Mixed-models analysis was used to examine factors associated with total time exercised and time spent in <b>flatwork.</b> RESULTS: In 4 countries, the 31 participating riders trained 263 European Warmbloods. The total days at risk (e. g. days in which the horses were considered fit for exercise) was 39, 262. Mean time spent in daily exercise, including ridden work, lungeing and treadmill exercise, varied between riders from 19 - 52 [*]min/day at risk. There was considerable variation in activities and level of heavy work and light exercise, i. e. turnout. Total time exercised and time spent in <b>flatwork</b> differed with month, country and proportion of days lost to training. Low variation of activities was associated with decreased total time trained and increased time spent in <b>flatwork.</b> CONCLUSIONS: Riders at this elite professional level of showjumping used training regimens that vary substantially in time spent training and other physical activities and showjumping horses are challenged differently during training despite competing at the same level. Whether all training regimens prepare the horses equally for the demands of competition remains to be determined...|$|E

40|$|Pervious {{concrete}} is {{a special}} type of concrete with a high porosity used for concrete <b>flatwork</b> applications that allows water from precipitation and other sources to pass through it, thereby reducing the runoff from a site and recharging ground water levels. The void content can range from 18 to 35 % with compressive strengths of 400 to 4000 psi. The infiltration rate of pervious concrete will fall into the range of 2 to 18 gallons per minute per square foot (80 to 720 liters per minute per square meter). Typically pervious concrete has little to no fine aggregate and has just enough cementitious paste to coat the coarse aggregate particles while preserving the interconnectivity of the voids. Pervious concrete is traditionally used in parking areas, areas with light traffic, pedestrian walkways, and greenhouses. Pervious Concrete is an important application for sustainable construction...|$|E

40|$|Pervious {{concrete}} is {{a special}} high porosity concrete used for <b>flatwork</b> applications that allows water from precipitation and other source to pass through there by Reducing the Runoff from a site and Recharging Ground Water Levels. Durability and Water Absorption are important properties of Pervious Concrete. This paper represents the experimental methodology and experimental results related to durability and water absorption. Cylinders of size 100 mm Ø and 200 mm height are prepared to investigate both these properties. This investigation should be carried {{out at the end}} of 28 days for water absorption and 56 days for durability in which cylinders are immersed in Sodium Chloride (NaCl) Solution after 28 days of casting. Different concrete mix proportion such as 1 : 6, 1 : 8 and 1 : 10 with different size of gravel such as 18. 75 mm and 9. 375 mm should be used to check both these properties of pervious concrete. Test results indicates that pervious concrete made by 1 : 6 concrete mix proportion has more durability and less water absorption and pervious concrete made by 1 : 10 mix proportion has more water absorption and less durability that’s why durability and water absorption are inversely proportional to each other...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—The {{stability}} of the structures built on expansive soils or crossed expansive layers may be compromised {{as a result of}} a change of soil-moisture conditions. Knowledge of the behavior of the soil is considered a valuable data for engineers and practitioners of geotechnical and civil engineering, especially, in the phases of design and structural calculation. This paper is motivated by the extent of damage that should be avoided and can occur in the case of a pressure causing heave foundations, upward movement of <b>flatwork</b> or roadway cracking in spider or x-type pattern. First of all, the assessment of swelling characteristics depends on the conditions of starting wetting and saturation. For this reason, we suggested to establish an experimental study on the tirs or vertisol of Gharb region based on the swell oedometer test methods. A comparative analysis of swelling kinetics, swelling ratio and swelling pressure compared with test conditions is proposed. Our attention was focused, thereafter, on the influence of the wetting duration that interferes with a rise of degree of saturation and regression of suction. It was also valuable to study the influence of the initial condition of the soil in terms of water content combined with dry density. All of these factors follow some real sequences in the field...|$|E
