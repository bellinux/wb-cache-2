5|$|Asexuality is {{the lack}} of sexual {{attraction}} to others, or low or absent interest in or desire for sexual activity. It may be considered the lack of a sexual orientation, or one of the variations thereof, alongside <b>heterosexuality,</b> homosexuality and bisexuality.|$|E
5|$|The modern post-industrial era in {{advertising}} {{was one of}} reaffirming widely held social values, such as <b>heterosexuality</b> and the middle-class, while neglecting alternative values or lifestyles. The advertising industry was conservative and did not deviate from images that were socially acceptable. Some countries, such as Japan, continue to present the family stereotypically, especially in their television advertisements. In the past decade, however, many advertising agencies have begun to more accurately capture reality and the diversity of lifestyles and family types of consumers.|$|E
5|$|Carolyn Dinshaw {{argues that}} the poem {{may have been a}} {{response}} to accusations that Richard II had a male lover—an attempt to reestablish the idea that <b>heterosexuality</b> was the Christian norm. Around the time the poem was written, the Catholic Church was beginning to express concerns about kissing between males. Many religious figures were trying to make the distinction between strong trust and friendship between males and homosexuality. Still, the Pearl Poet seems to have been simultaneously entranced and repulsed by homosexual desire. In his other poem Cleanness, he points out several grievous sins, but spends lengthy passages describing them in minute detail. His obsession seems to carry into Gawain in his descriptions of the Green Knight.|$|E
40|$|This article {{draws on}} {{interview}} material to analyse {{the ways in}} which heterosexual ‘couple practices’ interface with friendship practices (outside the couple). Focusing on the qualitative detail of participants’ experiences of friendship and of coupledom, I analyse the relationalities of gender, <b>heterosexualities</b> and friendship. Rather than focusing on gender as a variable in friendship variance, I examine {{the ways in which}} friendships ’do’ gender and <b>heterosexualities.</b> In this dynamic, intimacy is practiced by participants as a zero sum game and its distribution is strongly bounded. I argue that this distribution acts to create and reinforce boundaries of ‘friendship’ and ‘sexual couple’ bonds, and I examine the implications of these findings for analysing the relational qualities of the friendship tie...|$|R

Following this confrontation, Megan is sent to True Directions, a reparative therapy camp which uses a five-step program (similar to Alcoholics Anonymous' twelve-step program) to convert its campers to <b>heterosexuality.</b>|$|E
5|$|As {{genres of}} popular literature, science fiction and fantasy often seem more {{constrained}} than non-genre literature by their conventions of characterisation {{and the effects}} that these conventions have on depictions of sexuality and gender. Science fiction in particular has traditionally been a puritanical genre oriented toward a male readership. Sex is often linked to disgust in SF and horror, and plots based on sexual relationships have mainly been avoided in genre fantasy narratives. On the other hand, science fiction and fantasy can also provide more freedom than realistic literature to imagine alternatives to the default assumptions of <b>heterosexuality</b> and masculinity that permeate many cultures. Homosexuality is now an accepted and common feature of science fiction and fantasy literature, its prevalence due {{to the influence of}} lesbian-feminist and gay liberation movements.|$|E
5|$|Homosexual men {{tended to}} have had their first {{homosexual}} encounter at a younger age, {{and were more likely}} to have their first encounters with friends or acquaintances rather than strangers. The data did not support the idea that homosexual males are likely to have been seduced by older men. Homosexual activity involving genital contact in childhood was connected to adult homosexuality, though only weakly; homosexual arousal during childhood or adolescence was a stronger predictor of adult homosexuality. Heterosexual arousal during childhood was a moderate predictor of adult <b>heterosexuality.</b> Phenomena associated with sexual maturation, such as the age of first ejaculation, did not seem to be important, and neither did parental attitudes toward sex. Respondents' opportunities to engage in sex with persons of the opposite or the same sex did not seem to be an important influence on the sexual preference they developed, and sexual experiences with persons of both the same and the opposite sex were common among both homosexuals and heterosexuals. Sexual feelings appeared to be more important than sexual behavior as an indicator of adult sexual preference.|$|E

50|$|Research on Sexualities and Space has widened {{over time}} to {{encompass}} studies not just of LGBT populations but also the geographies and spaces of <b>heterosexualities.</b> This has included, inter alia, consideration of the impacts of sexuality on the visibilities of commercial sex; the design and consumption of housing; spaces of sex education; the sexualisation of leisure and retail spaces; landscapes of sex tourism; spaces of love, caring and intimacy. This has bought geographies of sexuality into dialogue with gender geography by showing that sexual norms reproduce particular ideas of masculinity and femininity.|$|R
2500|$|While {{religion}} and the law have had {{a fundamental role in}} the historical definition and punishment of sodomy, sodomitical texts present considerable opportunities for ambiguity and interpretation. Sodomy is both a real occurrence and an imagined category. In the course of the eighteenth century, what is identifiable as sodomy often becomes identified with effeminacy, for example, or in opposition to a discourse of manliness. In this regard, Ian McCormick has argued that [...] "an adequate and imaginative reading involves a series of intertextual interventions in which histories become stories, fabrications and reconstructions in lively debate with, and around, 'dominant' <b>heterosexualities</b> ... Deconstructing what we think we see may well involve reconstructing ourselves in surprising and unanticipated ways." ...|$|R
5|$|The Homosexual Matrix {{is a book}} by American {{psychologist}} Clarence Arthur Tripp, {{in which}} the author discusses the biological and sociological implications of homosexuality, and also attempts to explain <b>heterosexuality</b> and bisexuality. The book {{was first published in}} 1975 by McGraw-Hill Book Company, and later republished in a revised edition in 1987. Based on his review of the evidence, Tripp argues that people do not become homosexual due to factors such as hormone levels, fear of the opposite sex, or the influence of dominant and close-binding mothers, that the amount of attention fathers give to their sons has no effect on the development of homosexuality, that psychoanalytic theories of the development of homosexuality are untenable and based on false assumptions, and that sexual orientation is not innate and depends on learning. Tripp considers early puberty and early masturbation important factors in the development of male homosexuality, and maintains that a majority of people are heterosexual because their socialization has made them want to be heterosexual. He also argues in favor of social tolerance of homosexuality and non-conformist behavior in general.|$|E

25|$|In Euro-American cultures, sexual {{orientation}} {{is defined by}} the gender(s) of the people a person is romantically or sexually attracted to. Euro-American culture generally assumes <b>heterosexuality,</b> unless otherwise specified. Cultural norms, values, traditions and laws facilitate <b>heterosexuality,</b> including constructs of marriage and family. Efforts are being made to change these attitudes, and legislation is being passed to promote equality.|$|E
40|$|Homosexualities, like <b>heterosexualities,</b> are {{numerous}} and the psychological type of "the homosexual" does not exist. The binary schema of hetero/homo {{allows us to}} understand {{very little of the}} sexualities of other times and other cultures. Categorization runs the risk of flattening the sexual discourse as human sexuality cannot be completely summed up by using psycho(patho) logical or biological models. In speaking of how men and women love, we find ourselves in the territory of culture, narration and language. Therefore, contemporary psychoanalytic inclusiveness promotes an interdisciplinary and transcultural dialogue which serves the purpose of the author's eclectic (post-Jungian and relational) approach. In light of contemporary emerging perspectives on the multiplicities of sex and gender, this paper also tries to illustrate its points by examining the prevailing attitudes within the Italian psychoanalytic community toward gay/lesbian people...|$|R
50|$|The Psychology of Sexualities Section (PoS) is a Section of the British Psychological Society {{for psychologists}} {{whose work is}} {{relevant}} to lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans and queer (LGBTQ) issues. The Section {{is open to all}} BPS members including both practitioner and academic psychologists. The Section was established in 1998, as the Lesbian & Gay Psychology Section, after nearly a decade of campaigning and three rejected proposals (two for a Psychology of Lesbianism Section and one for a Lesbian & Gay Psychology Section). Founding members of the Section include Celia Kitzinger and Sue Wilkinson. In 2009, the Section changed its name to the Psychology of Sexualities Section in recognition that the work and interests of its members also applied to bisexuality, queer identities and <b>heterosexualities.</b> Although trans issues could more accurately be described as belonging to a psychology of gender, trans issues are typically included under the umbrella of lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans and queer (LGBTQ) psychology and is therefore aligned with the Section’s remit.|$|R
40|$|In 1999 I {{was still}} married {{to my wife}} and was a father of four children. When I changed sex and gender we became estranged. We were all distressed by this event which {{reflected}} {{nearly half of all}} transsexual transitions (De Cuyperea et al., 2006; Whittle et al., 2007). The experience impelled me to critically investigate transition in a familial context; such investigations have been neglected and overlooked in heterosexual and non-heterosexual studies of familial intimacy. I argue that identity is a social construct formed between individuals and others. Transition disrupts <b>heterosexuality’s</b> essentialist biological schema because changes in sex/gender identities are assumed to be fixed, coherent and stable. Transition caused familial intimates’ understandings to become fractured and they became distressed. I interviewed 13 transsexual and 12 familial intimates (some in the same family), using a self-disclosure approach suggested by Oakley (1981), so that they might tell of their transitional experiences. Telephone interviews were used due to their wide geographical dispersion, The transitional biographical narratives of participants were qualitatively analysed and coded using Nvivo. The methodology followed that originated by Plummer (1995) in his empirical study of sexual stories. The results showed that pre-transition transsexual people fear rejection so they adopt various strategies to begin transition. In 86...|$|R

Taken all together, the six pairs of questions and responses provide a profile of an individual's sexual orientation. However, results can be further simplified into four summaries that look specifically at responses that correspond to either homosexuality, <b>heterosexuality,</b> bisexuality or asexuality.|$|E

40|$|The three central {{assertions of}} this thesis are: (1) {{that there are}} no moral grounds for the belief that lesbian and gay sexualities are {{inferior}} to <b>heterosexualities,</b> (2) that lesbians, gays, bi-sexuals and heterosexuals are equally valuable and worthy of respect as autonomous human beings with life plans of their own which {{they have the right to}} pursue, as long as they do not harm others, (3) that a philosophically informed rationale for arguing for lesbian and gay equality is required in today's aspiring democracies. The concepts of personal autonomy, participatory democracy and the democratic virtues are familiar themes within the Philosophy of Education. This thesis brings these themes to bear on the question of the place of lesbian and gay issues within a democratic education system. In doing so, it places the oppression of lesbians and gays within the broader context of the oppression of other members of the democratic community. It examines these complex and diverse powers of oppression with the aid of philosophical literature and with reference to the philosophical concepts of personal autonomy and participatory democracy. In the light of the previous discussions, philosophical skills, concepts and literature are employed to develop a critique of the educational policies of the British government in the 1980 s and 90 s and offer alternative policy suggestions based on more adequate accounts of human nature and social values. Finally, both the manner in which education should be controlled, and the form and content of education within a democratic state are critically examined...|$|R
40|$|References {{drawing on}} {{historical}} notions and rejecting {{the more recent}} masculinity of the Maoist period are crucial {{to the formation of}} contemporary Chinese manhood generally and urban white-collar men in particular. Indeed, discussions in popular magazines targeted at the affluent middle class frequently allude to imagined models of ‘traditional’ Chinese masculinity to legitimize contemporary practices that may not bear much resemblance to historical practice. This paper examines how the figure of the metrosexual is sometimes placed into a continuum of beautiful men in Chinese culture - a historical narrative of sexualised “male beauty” (nanse) - stretching for thousands of years, which removes the need to acknowledge his specific historical and geographical origins in the metropolises of contemporary “Western” consumer society. In this guise, the possibility of a transgressive sexual orientation/identity recedes (despite his sexual practices, which may include same-sex desire and activities) : he is marked off from foreign-inspired “gays” and thus can be appropriated into the “Chinese tradition” without too much difficulty. Whereas men with an androgynous look and even behaviour can be “filed under” existing historical concepts such as “little white faces” (xiaobailian), thereby affirming their <b>heterosexualities,</b> explicit gay identity is more difficult to appropriate because there is no obvious historical antecedent. For some people, therefore, a gay identity is not commensurate with the Chinese tradition; in other words, with their very construction of “Chineseness”. This paper argues that such legitimising/ delegitimising discourses ultimately curtail the transgressive possibilities of new masculine sexualities, through their widespread privileging of naturalized and unequal heterosexual norms...|$|R
40|$|This is a self- study (S-STEP) into {{interrupting}} and re-constructing heteronormativity via an {{integration of}} queer and critical pedagogies on youth and community work courses. It was conducted {{over three years}} and involved interactions with three student cohorts (over 200 people) and reflective conversations with ten colleagues. It was situated within a critical realist paradigm, making specific use of Archer’s morphogenetic approach and her typology of reflexives as a heuristic tool. I make an ontological contribution to knowledge by illustrating how critical realism is a useful bridge between queer and critical pedagogy. It found that ‘coming out’ is a legitimate method of interrupting heteronormativity, but {{needs to be a}} pedagogical act carried out co-currently with interrupting other social constructions and binary oppositions. It suggests that interrupting heteronormativity is most effective {{within the context of a}} whole course and wider team approach. There is a legitimacy and necessity of developing transgressive sexualities, especially <b>heterosexualities.</b> I add to the literature by suggesting that interrupting and reconstructing heteronormativity also necessitates the development of pedagogical practitioners as dedicated meta-reflexives with intersubjective consciousness’s. This combines elements of Orne‘s and Black’s reconceptualisting of Du Bois’s original vision of double consciousness, as a negative de-centring concept, to being a useful, and necessary, device in an increasingly liquid modernity. I also expand Scrambler’s, and Archer’s different visions of a dedicated meta-reflectives. Intersubjective consciousness’s can, by implications, only be held collectively. The group co-holding each other to account for the balance between stigma resistance and challenge. Developing pedagogical practitioners necessitates co-created and co-held metareflexive liminal spaces that emphasise inter-subjectivity, encounter and working in the moment. These spaces need to be founded on principles of the need to de-construct and reconstruct pedagogical power and knowledge, and understandings of the public and private in pedagogical space...|$|R

40|$|Abnormal Tongues” is an {{analysis}} of the sexual politics of style. Many interpretive strategies of modern Western thought, it contends, are shaped by a poorly understood, yet powerful sexual technology we call “style. ” What seems to circulate as a neutral, even scientific term in literary criticism is instead a supple ideological force that saturates academic and popular culture {{as one of the most}} powerful, because one of the most subtle, ways we understand how literary expression makes individuals legible to others as “normal” or as “deviant” sexual subjects. The ancient concept of style is transformed by the expert discourses of modernity in order to secure <b>heterosexuality’s</b> authorized use of language through what it figures as its “natural” condition of clarity and to disqualify homosexuality’s use of language as what it terms excessive stylization. The project examines the major theoretical texts of literary stylistics and psychoanalysis – the two most important modern discourses of style that together produced its sexualization – focusing on the cases of three important modernist stylists who have each been appropriated by literary criticism as exemplary instances of style’s presumed expression of authorial sexuality. Ernest Hemingway’s reception both as masculine icon and as a simple and direct writer allow him and his partisans to partake of the privilege and acclaim awarded to the heterosexually-inflected notion of clarity. For Henry James and Gertrude Stein the opposite is the case: each has been understood to produce overly stylized writing that is often read as an expression of the author’s shameful homosexuality. Each of these readings is fueled by a normalizing demand in the modern West to apply to style what Foucault terms “a hermeneutics of desire. ” In opposition to this largely unrecognized practice, “Abnormal Tongues” argues that literary criticism needs a new, non-disciplinary understanding of style that will liberate critique from its problematically phobic heritage and de-couple style from the practice of sexual diagnosis...|$|R

Because of this, major mental health professional organizations discourage and caution individuals against attempting to change their sexual orientation to heterosexual, and warn that attempting to do so can be harmful.
