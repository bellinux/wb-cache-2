40|$|An {{independent}} assessment {{was conducted to}} determine the critical initial flaw size (CIFS) for the flange-to-skin weld in the Ares I-X Upper Stage Simulator (USS). A series of weld analyses are performed to determine the residual stresses in a critical region of the USS. Weld residual stresses both increase constraint and mean stress thereby having an important effect on the fatigue life. The purpose of the weld analyses was to model the weld process {{using a variety of}} sequences to determine the 'best' sequence in terms of weld residual stresses and distortions. The many factors examined in this study include weld design (single-V, <b>double-V</b> <b>groove),</b> weld sequence, boundary conditions, and material properties, among others.

40|$|Abstract The aim of {{this work}} is to {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of fiberglass and ceramic fiber cylinders as root-pass weld backing for a <b>double-V</b> <b>groove</b> in 16 mm-thick carbon steel. Three different cylinder diameters were tested: 4. 8, 9. 5 mm (fiberglass) and 6. 4 mm (ceramic fiber). The welding process used was GMAW. The welding technique and the following process variables were investigated: root opening, current and travel speed. The results show that cylindrical fiberglass and ceramic fiber backings not only have excellent refractory properties, but also seal the root opening and contain the weld pool sufficiently to produce a root bead free of discontinuities and with a satisfactory shape and geometry. Working points were defined, together with a possible operating range for the welding parameters. It was concluded that cylindrical fiberglass and ceramic fiber weld backings hold great promise for use in root-pass welds in double-V grooves in applications in the naval and metallurgical industry...|$|E
40|$|An {{independent}} assessment {{was conducted to}} determine the critical initial flaw size (CIFS) for the flange-to-skin weld in the Constellation Program (CxP) Ares I-X (AIX) Upper Stage Simulator (USS). A series of weld analyses were performed to determine the residual stresses in a critical region of the USS. Weld residual stresses can increase component constraint and the mean stress thereby impacting the fatigue life. The purpose of the USS weld analyses was to model the joining process {{using a variety of}} sequences to determine the ‘optimum ’ sequence in terms of weld residual stresses and distortions. The factors examined in this study include the A 516 Grade 70 steel weld design (single-V, <b>double-V</b> <b>groove),</b> weld sequence, boundary conditions, and material properties. The results of this weld analysis were included with the USS service loads to perform a fatigue and CIFS evaluation. Nomenclature WRS = weld residual stress CTSP = comprehensive thermal solution procedure CIFS = critical initial flaw size a = surface crack depth ai = initial crack depth aCFS = critical flaw depth Nc = number of spectrum repeats required to grow the crack from ai to aCFS c = half surface crack length ID = inside diameter of the cylinder OD = outside diameter of the cylinder R = ratio of minimum cyclic stress to maximum cyclic stress I...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effects of}} laser peening on Alloy 22 (UNS N 06022), which is the proposed material for use as the outer layer on the spent-fuel nuclear waste canisters to be stored at Yucca Mountain. Stress corrosion cracking (SCC) is a primary concern {{in the design of}} these canisters because tensile residual stresses will be left behind by the closure weld. Alloy 22 is a nickel-based material that is particularly resistant to corrosion; however there is a chance that stress corrosion cracking could develop given the right environmental conditions. Laser peening is an emerging surface treatment technology that has been identified as an effective tool for mitigating tensile redisual stresses in the storage canisters. The results of laser-peening experiments on Alloy 22 base material and a sample 33 mm thick <b>double-V</b> <b>groove</b> butt-weld made with gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW) are presented. Residual stress profiles were measured in Alloy 22 base material using the slitting method (also known as the crack-compliance method), and a full 2 D map of longitudinal residual stress was measured in the sample welds using the contour method. Laser peening was found to produce compressive residual stress to a depth of 3. 8 mm in 20 mm thick base material coupons. The depth of compressive residual stress was found to have a, significant dependence on the number of peening layers and a slight dependence on the level of irradiance. Additionally, laser peening produced compressive residual stresses to a depth of 4. 3 mm in the 33 mm thick weld {{at the center of the}} weld bead where high levels of tensile stress were initially present...|$|E
