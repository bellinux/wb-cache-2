6000|$|... "Right, squire; we will," [...] he said. [...] "But <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> best leave {{a letter}} for Mamie, so's she won't be {{wondering}} where you've got to." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then {{let us do}} it, Dick. Those fellows don't own the cars, and we didn't hire from them, {{we hired}} from {{the owner of the}} garage. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> a right to run them under the circumstances." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Thank {{you very}} much," [...] {{answered}} Jack. [...] "We'll ride {{home in the}} auto with pleasure. But <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> better let the bicycles rest to-night where they are; eh, fellows?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "You people don't {{know your}} own resources. There's 'most {{everything}} {{a white man}} needs right on this American continent, if he'll take the trouble to look for it. Lumber changes some of its properties with the location in which it grows, <b>I</b> <b>guess.</b> <b>We</b> <b>have</b> pines in Florida, {{but when you get}} right up to their northern limit you'll find a difference." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> ordered SOME. Of {{course we}} wanted to take {{advantage}} of being in Paris--ladies always do. We have left the principal things till we go back. Of course that is the principal interest, for ladies. Mother said she should feel so shabby if she just passed through. We have promised all the people to be back in September, and I never broke a promise yet. So Mr. Ruck has got to make his plans accordingly." ...|$|E
60|$|Washington, May 10, '64 (1/2 past 2 p.m.) DEAREST MOTHER--There {{is nothing}} {{perhaps more than}} {{you see in the}} N. Y. papers. The {{fighting}} down in the field on the 6th I think ended in our favor, though with pretty severe losses to some of our divisions. The fighting is about 70 miles from here, and 50 from Richmond--on the 7th and 8th followed up by the Rebel army hauling off, they say retreating, and Meade pursuing. It is quite mixed yet, but <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> the best of it. If we really have, Richmond is a goner, for they cannot do any better than they have done. The 9th Corps was in the fight, and where I cannot tell yet, but from the wounded I have seen I don't think that Corps was deeply in. I have seen 300 wounded. They came in last night. I asked for men of 9th Corps, but could not find any at all. These 300 men were not badly wounded, mostly in arms, hands, trunk of body, etc. They could all walk, though some had an awful time of it. They had to fight their way with the worst in the middle out of the region of Fredericksburg, and so on where they could get across the Rappahannock and get where they found transportation to Washington. The Gov't has decided, (or rather Gen. Meade has) to occupy Fredericksburg for depot and hospital--(I think that is a first rate decision)--so the wounded men will receive quick attention and surgery, instead of being racked through the long journey up here. Still, many come in here. Mother, my impression is that we have no great reason for alarm or sadness about George so far. Of course I know nothing. Well, good-bye, dearest mother.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, we've got {{a couple}} of hours yet," [...] said the doctor's son. [...] "But <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> better turn back toward camp. We don't want to miss our way in the dark." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{they told}} us there weren't very many wild beasts around here!" [...] came from Martha. [...] "After this <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> better be careful how we roam through the woods and along the river." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> {{better be}} {{thinking}} of {{getting back to the}} school," [...] said Jack, as he consulted his watch. They had been told that they must return in time for the evening meal.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; I see {{we never}} {{wanted to go back}} there to live, any of us, and I went up to pass the papers and close the thing out. Well, I did have an offer for it from a feller that wanted to open a boa'din'-house there and get the {{advantage}} of Jeff's improvements, and I couldn't seem to make up my mind till I'd looked the ground over. Fust off, you know, I thought I'd sell to the other feller, because I could see in a minute what a thorn it 'd be in Jeff's flesh. But, dumn it all! When I met the comical devil I couldn't seem to want to pester him. Why, here, thinks I, if we've made an escape from him--and <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>we</b> <b>have,</b> about the biggest escape--what have I got ag'in' him, anyway? I'd ought to feel good to him; and I guess that's the way I did feel, come to boil it down. He's got a way with him, you know, when you're with him, that makes you like him. He may have a knife in your ribs the whole while, but so long's he don't turn it, you don't seem to know it, and you can't help likin' him. Why, I hadn't been with Jeff five minutes before I made up my mind to sell to him. I told him about the other offer--felt bound to do it--and he was all on fire. 'I want that place, Mr. Whitwell,' s'd he. 'Name your price.' Well, I wa'n't goin' to take an advantage of the feller, and I guess he see it. 'You've offered me three thousand,' s'd I, 'n' I don't want to be no ways mean about it. Five thousand buys the place.' 'It's mine,' s'd he; just like that. I guess he see he had a gentleman to deal with, and we didn't say a word more. Don't you think I done right to sell to him? I couldn't 'a' got more'n thirty-five hundred out the other feller, to save me, and before Jeff begun his improvements I couldn't 'a' realized a thousand dollars on the prop'ty." ...|$|E
5000|$|Often {{described}} as post punk, Talbot rejects the label, saying in June 2017 [...] "We're not a post punk band. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> that motorik, engine-like {{drive in the}} rhythm section that some post punk bands have but {{we have plenty of}} songs that aren't like that at all." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Not {{as bad as}} {{it might}} be," [...] said Dick. [...] "We can easily mend the canvas. But <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> better get a new pole in place of that one. I'd not care to trust it, even if it were wired." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But we haven't opposed him yet," [...] {{her father}} answered. [...] "It {{will be time}} {{to look out for}} squalls when <b>we</b> do. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> a clear month before us; at the end of that, <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> best shin out of Utah." ...|$|R
5000|$|Immediate {{reception}} was overwhelmingly positive. Douglas Wolfe from TV Fanatic {{gave the}} episode 5 (out of 5) {{and stated that}} [...] "This story was amazing and filled with sadness. I cannot imagine a more compelling episode. The writing, the dialogue, the incredible performances all combined to a bring heartbreaking masterpiece to the small screen. I can't wait to see {{the second part of}} this story." [...] Steve Marsi, also from TV Fanatic, called the episode [...] "powerful and unexpected" [...] and said in a round table, [...] "Ziva screaming 'Abba' and bawling was enough to give anyone the chills, as was Gibbs standing stone-faced and ignoring the SecNav's calls. These scenes are enhanced by the fact that we're so invested in these characters after 10 seasons...Superb TV entertainment, but also emblematic of the uncertain times we live in." [...] Eric Hochberger added, [...] "Sometimes, I wish they wouldn't do this. Jackie in particular felt unnecessary to kill off. However, as Steve said, there's no denying the collective brilliance of the cast and writers last night and in similar episodes. So, <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> to trust them and see where they take this next week and beyond." ...|$|E
5000|$|In an {{interview}} on Spin, Clarkson revealed that she had found out about Tokio Hotel's version three days after releasing hers. She remarked, [...] "I was just talking to my assistant about it, like, 'Man, I gotta reach out to them about it!' I didn't cover them, because the only time I'd ever heard that song was from my publisher, who sent {{it to me and}} said, 'Hey, I have this demo with a piano and a vocal from David Jost,' one of the writers. That's the only way I knew it was the song. I didn't know it was already out there, so that was really fun finding out". She also added, [...] "It's a great song so I could see why another band would wanna sing it. It's so good and intense, but <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> the duet version." [...] Clarkson later posted on social networking site Twitter saying that she wasn't given all the information needed and that it looked like she had ripped them off as she would never do that to any artist. While Tokio Hotel offered their salutations and replied that they have received Clarkson's version weeks before it was released as her record label RCA Records had asked them for their publishing information.|$|E
40|$|Transcription begins] Friday 7 December 1944 Somewheres [sic] in Germany Beloved one, Today {{the mailman}} past [sic] me by—no letters. In fact no letters {{for any of}} the battery—just one of those days. Doc, on the other hand, {{received}} 3 packages. Some of the packages were mailed in late September. I suppose those mailed to me will show up soon, too. Darling, nothing new or eventful is happening these days. I suppose {{one of the most difficult}} things about war 2 ̆ 6 the army in general, is the monotony of doing nothing. But as long as I have a precious honey-girl to think about I keep myself occupied. Just to point out the rigors of war I might exhibit my house slippers which have been getting a lot of use during the evenings. If I get anymore [sic] comfortable the enemy may resent it. Of late, I got into the habit of smoking more than the usual 2 cigarettes a day so to remedy the condition I am going back to a pipe. There’s something about a pipe that cuts down my desire for smoking. One thing we’ve been getting a lot of is fruit juices and tomatoe [sic] juice. Everytime [sic] I saunter into the kitchen, and I make it my business to frequent the place often, I am offered a cup of juice—so you see, darling, I’m keeping up with my vitamins. Shelton got a paper today (Abilene, Texas) which carried the above article. No doubt it was carried in the Press and you may have read it. If you have not already read the article you will find that it brings out points which we discussed many, many times. Accept it for what it’s worth. Imagine, honey, reading material is becoming so limited that I’m even having to resort to detective stories these days. I never took to them before, but Doc “sold” me on the idea of reading Ellery Queen stories and I find them rather interesting. Gee, you’ve got to have something exciting around here. Eadie, darling, I’m enclosing, too, a one (1) mark bill (German invasion money) which has the value of 10 cents. All the Nazi money is worthless and some of the men have found millions of dollars worth of Reich marks (pre-Hitler) money. For a while we were permitting the men to send home souvenirs, but when some made up packages which included everything but a baby grand piano, we decided enough is enough and put a stop to all packages. Another example of giving the men a finger and they’ll take a hand. However, they feel justified since they feel it belonged to the enemy and he should never get possession of it again. I can’t say as I blame them for adopting this attitude. In one of the later issues of Yank (which I shall send you presently) you will find a story of the military government in Aachen. Doggone it, I wish I got a job doing such work. No, not that I am not completely satisfied at the present, but such work would be right down my alley. The article goes on to disclose the fact that some of the natives felt rather abashed when they found that they had to subject themselves to the Americans (most all of them are Jewish personnel) to get food and other rations. No soldiers are permitted to speak to the German civilians and if any are found, they are fined 64. The Military Government deals fairly but firmly with the civilians. In fact I don’t see why they even bother to treat them fairly but that’s the American way of doing things, <b>I</b> <b>guess.</b> <b>We</b> <b>have</b> gotten into bad habits around here. For the past 3 nights Doc 2 ̆ 6 I have played “Casino” against Shelton and Haygood. The games have ended so dramatically that they are now becoming very “ruthless and cut throat” in character. Doc 2 ̆ 6 I were kibitzing just now when he said, “Listen, why don’t we go in for some of these Army correspondence courses?” So we both decided that this would be an excellent opportunity to learn Russian to be an “up 2 ̆ 6 coming” language after the war. Don’t you think so, dear? Bubsie pie, I’m afraid I’ve run out of ramblings except to tell you that were I stranded alone on an island and could have my selection of mate, my immediate answer would be in a loud “holler,” I want my ‘pukie-pie’ Eadie to be with me. ” I love you, Bubs, Vic [Transcription ends...|$|E

6000|$|His comrade, however, {{engaged in}} another thought, didn’t {{so much as}} appear to catch it. “I say, <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> better remain at the inn.

6000|$|He laughed. [...] "Of {{course it}} is. But the thing we've got {{to guard against}} is old lady Belden's tongue.
