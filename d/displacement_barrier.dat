40|$|The {{current study}} {{contains}} two major parts. Part One {{consists of the}} identification and analysis of three existing base-isolated buildings in Southern California. The identification and analysis utilize the recorded motions of these structures from past earthquakes. System identification is useful for understanding {{the extent to which}} the structures enter the nonlinear realm and how much their properties change. Models are constructed assuming completely elastic three-dimensional superstructures, with idealized bi-linear hysteretic elements for the isolating bearings. The properties used in the bearing models were taken from tests of the actual bearings before installation. The models were then verified by comparing their responses computed using the various recorded foundation ground motions, with the recorded responses of the actual structures. The models were adjusted to minimize the error of several response quantities. Part Two contains computer simulations subjecting a typical base-isolated building (TBIB) to two classes of ground motions. The first is a sampling of near-source recorded motion from past moderate-to-large earthquakes. The second is a group of synthetic near-source motions generated for a hypothetical M 7. 0 earthquake. In some cases, the lateral response of the model exceeds the isolation gap, indicating that the <b>displacement</b> <b>barrier</b> would be impacted. In order to further study base-isolated buildings when the isolation bearings undergo large displacements the (TBIB) model is used and the computer program 2 D-BUMP is developed. This program includes the effects of a fully nonlinear superstructure, nonlinear springs acting as displacement barriers which engage at specified distances, and a tri-linear model for the elastomeric bearings. Using this model, several conclusions are drawn regarding the probable areal extent of damaging near-source ground motions from the M 7. 0 event, as well as the behavior of base-isolated structures due to these near-source long-period ground motions...|$|E

40|$|The {{application}} of soil anchoring system and grid beam method of strengthening protection wall post construction failure {{was observed in}} this research. The construction of the slope wall protection is situated to suit the existence of barrier made for aqueduct. Based on the numerical simulation on scenario of potential causes of slope failure, it indicates several phenomena such as the stability of barrier foundation experiences drastic drop. Scrutinizing the result of investigation and ideal design criterion for structural element of barriers, the condition function of existing protection wall has the factor of slope stability SF= 1. 01 ~ 1. 09, which is categorized as not safe and condition barrier failure.

40|$|Although run off {{the road}} {{accidents}} frequently occur on horizontal curves the performances of the safety barriers are evaluated by full scale crash tests which are performed on rectilinear safety barriers and no one study aimed at evaluating the safety barriers behavior on curves has been done. In this paper {{the results of a}} study aimed at evaluating the dynamics and the outcomes of the collision of the Heavy Goods Vehicles against the road safety barriers on horizontal curves are reported. The study has been carried out by a numerical approach, which involves simulating collisions with safety barriers through non-linear dynamic finite element analysis. The study has highlighted the factors responsible of the different behavior of the safety barriers on the horizontal curves: the change in the restraint system stiffness and the different yaw motion and vehicle’s velocity change needed to redirect the vehicle in carriageway. The previous factors strongly affect the barrier containment capacity. As far as the maximum transversal <b>barrier</b> <b>displacement</b> is concerned it decreases {{on the outside of the}} curves whereas it increases on the inside. The greater <b>barrier</b> <b>displacement</b> on the inside of the curves causes an increase in the passing over the barrier risk. As far as the vehicle roll over risk is concerned it strongly increases on the outside of the curves, where the {{run off the}} road accidents are significantly greater...|$|R

40|$|International audienceIn {{this paper}} the {{tracking}} system used {{to perform a}} scaled vehicle-barrier crash test is reported. The scaled crash test was performed {{as part of a}} wider project aimed at designing a new safety barrier making use of natural building materials. The scaled crash test was designed and performed as a proof of concept of the new mass-based safety barriers and the study was composed of two parts: the scaling technique and of a series of performed scaled crash tests. The scaling method was used for 1) setting the scaled test impact velocity so that energy dissipation and momentum transferring, from the car to the barrier, can be reproduced and 2) predicting the acceleration, velocity and displacement values occurring in the full-scale impact from the results obtained in a scaled test. To achieve this goal the vehicle and <b>barrier</b> <b>displacements</b> were to be recorded together with the vehicle accelerations and angular velocities. These quantities were measured during the tests using acceleration sensors and a tracking system. The tracking system was composed of a high speed camera and a set of targets to measure the vehicle linear and angular velocities. A code was developed to extract the target velocities from the videos and the velocities obtained were then compared with those obtained integrating the accelerations provided by the sensors to check the reliability of the method...|$|R
40|$|Worldwide, {{the road}} safety {{barriers}} containment capacity is evaluated by full scale crash tests which are performed according to specific crash conditions. In {{the most common}} benefit-cost analysis aimed at evaluating roadside safety alternatives and in the most common road safety barriers selection procedures, the barrier’s performance limit is assumed as the maximum Impact Severity of the crash tests successfully performed, that is the vehicle’s kinetic energy evaluated by the lateral component of velocity. In this paper the effectiveness of IS has been assessed. At this aim {{a great number of}} collisions of an Heavy Goods Vehicle against a steel road safety barrier were simulated through a non-linear dynamic finite element analysis, each one characterized by the same value of kinetic transverse energy and different values of the parameters that define IS: vehicle’s speed, mass and impact angle. The results obtained show that the collision outcomes noticeably change with these parameters: the smaller the impact angle and mass the greater the <b>barrier’s</b> <b>displacements</b> and vehicle’s rollover risk. Due to this influence the Limit Impact Severity of safety barriers considerably changes with the impact conditions. To address this problem, at least for the barrier and the vehicle considered in the study, an analysis aimed at evaluating the relationships between Limit Impact Severity and vehicle’s impact angle and mass has been carried out. The expressions obtained allow to evaluate the vehicle’s containment taking into account both the IS value and the values of vehicle’s mass and impact angle...|$|R
40|$|In the {{graduation}} thesis we have presented the determining of the <b>displacements</b> of the <b>barrier</b> at Prigorica. Our calculations {{were made in}} five term measurements. The thesis constist of the calculation of all combinations between term measurements. The measurements have been made with instruments Leica TC 1700 for angular and linear measurements and nivelir Leica- NAK 2 with a planparalel plate for vertical movements. Before we began analysing the displacements, individual term measurements have been adjustment by least – squares principle. The final adjustment has given us the answer whether there are any gross errors among the measures or observations, the adjusted coordinates and the accuracy analysis. To begin with {{the analysis of the}} displacement, we must first ensure, along with the prior adjustment, that the number of points is identical in all term measurements. The choice of method for determination and analysis of the displacement depends on the assignment. For analysing point displacements we have decided for a simple procedure with program Premik and the method of Hannover for a detailed deformation analysis. The method of Hannover is a procedure that reveals and determins the caused displacements with methods of statistical analysis. We test homogenity of accuracy of term measurements, we make a global test of reference points stability and determine and test possible displacements on an observed object. Both procedures are presented in detail in {{the graduation}} thesis. For conclusion we have presented the results of analysis and compared them with each other...|$|R

In the first part I presented barrier Drtijščica, described the geodetic network, which is developed on the barrier, and presented position of the reference and control points on the barrier. I presented an electronic Total Station Leica TC 1700, by which the length and angle of observation, where horizontal angles and zenith distance were measured, were carried out. These measurements were the basis for determining the positional and vertical coordinates of the barrier control points. I described the process of balancing the observations with the method of least squares. I presented a deformation analysis, in which I described the Hannover method in detail. In {{the second part of the}} thesis I presented the data preparation for balancing observations with three different programs: with the program BINGO I calculated the spatial coordinates, using the program GEM I calculated the positional coordinates, and using the program VinWim I calculated the altitude coordinates. The results of the equalization are then presented in the tables and the equalization coordinates were compared to each other. This was followed by analysis of the relative and cumulative positional and altitudinal displacements using the program PREMIK, and the deformation analysis with the Hannover method.

40|$|Our {{alarming}} rate of resource exploitation {{and its consequences}} on the environment is fuelling an increase in sustainable energy production around the world. Wind power {{appears to be a}} particularly promising energy source relative to its environmental footprint, with the exception of potential negative effects of wind power on birds. Varying results from impact assessments around the world indicate that knowledge of both abiotic and biotic factors, as well as bird behavior and ecology, is required to assess the cumulative impact of any given wind farm on local bird communities. This study aims to assess the cumulative impact of a proposed wind farm on a threatened seabird, the red-throated diver (Gavia stellata), at one of its breeding "hotspots" in Sweden: the Holmöarna islands. Measurements of environmental variables in lakes on Holmöarna are combined with breeding surveys from 2012 to 2015 to assess which environmental variables may be associated with lakes that red-throated divers do or do not breed in, and which variables are correlated with breeding success. These results are combined with a literature review to assess the potential negative effects of the proposed wind farm on the breeding population on Holmöarna. The results show that average breeding success over the survey period was 0. 35 fledged young per pair per year. No difference was found in environmental variables between lakes that divers had or had not bred in. Lake area/perimeter ratio and distance to the sea were significantly negatively correlated with breeding success, although distance to the sea was only significant for lakes with at least one successful breeding attempt during the survey period. Based on these correlations, 33 of a total 40 breeding lakes are shown to have relatively high area/perimeter ratios and long distances to the sea, which may pre-dispose divers breeding within them to low breeding success. These lakes are, therefore, identified as being at high-to-moderate risk of increased breeding failure if breeding success is further reduced as a result of external factors, including that of any negative impacts of the proposed wind farm. 31 of the 40 breeding lakes are also within 1 km of the proposed wind turbine sites, which may render red-throated divers breeding within them vulnerable to displacement as a result of wind farm-related disturbance. The literature review highlights the mechanisms that may determine the cumulative impact of the wind farm on red-throated divers in terms of collision mortality, habitat <b>displacement,</b> and <b>barriers</b> to movement. The strong sensitivity of red-throated divers to disturbance is considered to be the most likely driver of any negative effects of the wind farm. In this context, I thus argue the need for a precautionary approach to planning wind power developments in the vicinity of breeding red-throated diver populations...|$|R
40|$|The use of Mechanically Stabilized Earth (MSE) wall {{structures}} {{has increased}} dramatically in recent years. Traffic barriers are frequently placed {{on top of the}} MSE wall to resist vehicular impact loads. The barrier systems are anchored to the concrete in case of rigid pavement. Nevertheless, in case of flexible pavement, the barriers are constructed in an L shape so that the impact load on the vertical part of the L can be resisted by the inertia force required to uplift the horizontal part of the L. The barrier must be designed to resist the full dynamic load but the size of the horizontal part of the L (moment slab) is determined using an equivalent static load. Current design practice of barriers mounted on top of MSE retaining wall is well defined for passenger cars and light trucks. However, the information of this impact level is extrapolated to heavy vehicle impact. Therefore, the bases of this research is to develop design procedure and to help understand the dynamic behavior of a barrier-moment slab system on top of an MSE wall when subjected to heavy vehicle impact loads. In a first part, numerical analyses were conducted to better understand the behavior of the barrier-moment slab system when subjected to heavy vehicle impact loads. The full-scale impact simulations were used to develop the recommendation for designing and sizing the barrier-moment slab system. In a second part, the barrier-moment slab systems defined to contain heavy vehicle impact loads were placed on top of an MSE wall model to study the kinematic behavior of the system. Loads in the soil reinforcing strips and <b>displacements</b> on the <b>barriers</b> and wall components are evaluated to define recommendation for design of strip reinforcements against pullout and yielding. In a third part, a full-scale crash test on a barrier-moment slab system on top of an instrumented 9. 8 ft. (3 m) high MSE wall is described and analyzed. The MSE wall and barrier system were adequate to contain and redirected the vehicle and, therefore, it served as verification of the proposed recommendation. Finally, conclusions are drawn {{on the basis of the}} information presented herein...|$|R
40|$|Aim: The {{present study}} {{designed}} {{to evaluate the}} effect of different feeding systems {{on the behavior of}} local Rohilkhandi kids. Materials and Methods: A total of 21 growing goats (local goat of Rohilkhand region), weighing around 7 - 11 kg and aging 4 - 5 months, were used. These animals were kept in three groups. Group I was fed un-chopped green fodder in circular feeder (newly designed). Group II was fed un-chopped green fodder in linear feeder that was similar to the existing farm practice. Group III was fed chopped green fodder in linear feeder (modified version). Amount of concentrate and dry fodder fed was kept constant for all the three groups subject to equal increment in accordance with their increasing age. Adlibitum green fodder was made available to the animals. The experiment was conducted for 3 months. On-going behavior was recorded each day 4 h (2 h in the morning from 9 : 00 am to 11 : 00 am, after offering the feed, and same was repeated for 2 h in the afternoon, i. e., from 2 : 00 pm to 4 : 00 pm) was made between 9 am and 5 pm. The individual behaviors, viz., feeding, drinking, lying down, ruminating, idling, butting, pressing, pushing, frontal clashing, and physical <b>displacement</b> at feed <b>barrier</b> (active and passive: Without physical contact) of the goat were recorded using time-sampling method. Further, incidental activities such as defecation and urination were also recorded. Results: Among all the groups, butting, head to head, and pushing were the common agonistic behavior found but values did not differ significantly. The pushing while feeding was relatively less in Group II (0. 22 ± 0. 04 min) which differed significantly (p< 0. 05) from the other two groups. The idling time was found significantly (p< 0. 05) lower in Group II (1. 68 ± 0. 21) as compared to Group I (4. 67 ± 0. 52) and Group III (4. 27 ± 0. 56). Time spent in rumination near the feeding trough as well as away from the feeding trough was also significantly higher in Group I (p< 0. 05) than the other two groups. Other minor activities, viz., defecation and urination were negligible. No stereotypic activities were observed. Conclusion: It was concluded that provision of un-chopped fodder in circular feeder could only simulate natural feeding behavior of goat but did not give any added advantage. Further, feeding chopped fodder in linear feeding trough lead to increased consumption and more time is spent on feeding than on agonistic behavior as compared to the other two groups...|$|R
40|$|The {{offshore}} {{waters and}} the coastline of Oregon provide year-round habitat {{for a number}} of birds, marine mammals, sea turtles, and possibly bats, at least fifteen of which are federally listed as threatened or endangered. Previous workshops on offshore renewable energy have provided baseline information on the distribution and abundance of these species on the Pacific Outer Continental Shelf (OCS). There are varying amounts of baseline information for offshore species; however, seasonal variability and relative abundance are generally known at a broad scale. Sea turtles are subtropical and tropical breeders and all species found on the Pacific OCS are uncommon north of Mexico. Sea turtles that occur in the waters off of Oregon are primarily leatherback sea turtles (Dermochelys coriacea); however, loggerhead (Caretta caretta), green (Chelonia mydas), and olive ridley (Lepidochelys olivacea) sea turtles could also occur. All of these species are listed as either threatened or endangered under the federal Endangered Species Act (ESA); there is designated Critical Habitat for the leatherback sea turtle off the Oregon coast. Sea turtles are drawn to offshore waters during the summer upwelling period where they feed on a variety of pelagic and benthic organisms. A diversity of marine mammals occur offshore of Oregon including 24 species of cetaceans and 6 species of pinnipeds. Sea otters are rare, but stragglers from Washington are occasionally seen along the Oregon coast. Among the cetaceans seen in Oregon waters, the north Pacific right (Eubalaena japonica), blue (Balaenoptera musculus), fin (Balaenoptera physalus), sei (Balaenoptera borealis), humpback (Megaptera novaengliae), killer (Orcinus orca), and sperm (Physeter macrocephalus) whales are listed as threatened or endangered under the ESA. Federally listed pinnipeds include the Guadalupe fur seal (Arctocephalus townsendi) and Steller sea lion (Eumetopias jubatus), the latter of which also has designated Critical Habitat off the Oregon coast. Little is known about the offshore movement of bats on the Pacific OCS, but observations from the Farallon Islands off San Francisco have regularly recorded the presence of the migratory hoary bat (Lasiurus cinereus) during migration periods. Modeling has shown that hoary bat arrivals and departures correlate with low wind speeds, low moon illumination, and relatively high degrees of cloud cover. In addition, low barometric pressure predicted arrivals. The status of bats offshore has received little to no attention and study is needed to determine their presence on the Pacific OCS. Marine birds occur widely on the Pacific OCS off Oregon. Nearshore areas are inhabited by a variety of species of sea ducks, loons, grebes, cormorants, pelicans, gulls, terns, and several alcids. Deepwater areas 8 - 35 miles offshore and beyond are inhabited by albatrosses, shearwaters, petrels, storm-petrels, skuas, jaegers, alcids, and pelagic shorebirds, gulls and terns. Federally listed species under the ESA that have been extensively monitored and studied along the Oregon coast include the Western Snowy Plover (Charadrius nivosus nivosus) and Marbled Murrelet (Brachyramphus marmoratus). As studies reveal more information about the population status and movements of the endangered Short-tailed Albatross (Phoebastria albatrus) and Hawaiian Petrel (Pterodroma sandwichensis), we are finding that these species are rare, but regular off the Oregon coast at specific times of the year. Previous workshops on offshore renewable energy have also described the potential effects that the construction and operation of energy devices could have on these taxonomic groups. Activities that can have effects on these species include construction and operational activities, vessel traffic, seismic surveys, foundation and cable installation, turbine operation, foundation protection, and the ongoing presence of cables. Resulting effects include collision and entanglement, barotrauma (particularly for bats), prey base and habitat alteration, trash ingestion (particularly for sea turtles), <b>displacement,</b> movement <b>barriers,</b> electromagnetic field effects, light attraction, pollution, and noise impacts. Renewable energy conferences and workshops have identified knowledge and data gaps {{that need to be addressed}} to inform the planning and regulating of commercial-scale projects on the Pacific OCS. Gaps identified for sea turtles include understanding their seasonal use of the OCS particularly for post-hatchling stages; noise and EMF effects; and comprehensive population estimates; the latter will be difficult to assess due to the turtles’ solitary nature and wide distribution. Gaps identified for marine mammals include information on site-specific baseline data on occurrence, distribution, and behavior; site-specific acoustic effects on species with low frequency sensitivity; baseline information on migration routes and home ranges; impacts on gray whales (Eschrichtius robustus); monitoring to understand interactions between marine mammals and renewable energy devices; and acoustic-related effects. Gaps identified for marine birds include site-specific spatial and temporal distribution and abundance of birds at sea; nocturnal activity; important areas of bird activity that should be avoided; important migration patterns; potential effects on seabird prey; energetic consequences; and effects of EMF, noise, lights and structures, and collision risk. Sensitivity analysis and decision support tools have also been identified as necessary to assess the risk to marine birds. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management’s Environmental Studies Program has funded a variety of seabird and marine mammal studies to collect baseline information and assess the effects of conventional and renewable energy projects on the Pacific OCS. Recently completed studies focused on renewable energy include a summary of knowledge of select areas of the Pacific coast, an analysis of the effects of EMFs from undersea power cables on marine species, and protocols for baseline studies and monitoring for ocean renewable energy. A number of additional studies focused on renewable energy are underway or proposed, several of which should eliminate some of the identified knowledge and data gaps. These include aerial surveys of seabirds and marine mammals off the Pacific Northwest, assessing vulnerability of marine birds to offshore renewable energy devices, data synthesis and high-resolution predictive modeling of marine bird distributions in the Pacific, and several others. In addition, there are pilot studies in the Atlantic that are assessing and testing technologies that could be used for surveying and monitoring birds, bats, marine mammals, and sea turtles in the Pacific...|$|R
