First, the personage who is called the PORTIER (who is not the PORTER, but {{is a sort of}} first-mate of a hotel) [1.

60|$|I {{asked about}} buses. Then the responsible-looking, tired-eyed youth {{told me he}} was the bus-driver. He had come from Oristano, on the main line, that day.

The youth with the little black moustache and the Greek, large eyes, was his mate, the conductor. This was their run, from Oristano to Nuoro--a course of ninety miles or more. And every day on, on, on. No wonder he looked nerve-tired. Yet he had that kind of dignity, the wistful seriousness and pride of a man in machine control: the only god-like ones today, those who pull the iron levers and are the gods in the machine.|$|E

Here, my dear;' and {{she held out her}} hand and drew in the {{stranger}} to her, kissing her kindly, and placing her in a chair close to herself, as she presided over the teacups--not at the end, but at the middle of the table--while all that could be desired to eat and drink found its way at once to Dolores, who had arrived at being hungry now, and was glad to have the employment for hands and eyes, instead of feeling herself gazed at. She was not so much occupied, however, as not to perceive that Uncle William's voice had a free, merry ring in it, such as she had never heard in his visits to her father, and that there was a great deal of fun and laughter <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>over</b> the thin sheets of an Indian letter, which Aunt Lily was reading aloud.|$|E

But Mrs. Moss could not keep her promise, for on Monday it still rained, and the little girls paddled off to school like a pair of young ducks, enjoying every puddle they came to, since India-rubber boots made wading a delicious possibility. They took their dinner, and at noon regaled a crowd of comrades with an account of the mysterious dog, who {{appeared}} to be haunting the neighborhood, as several of the other children had seen him examining their back yards with interest. He had begged of them, but to none had he exhibited his accomplishments except Bab and Betty; and they were therefore much set up, and called him [...] "our dog" [...] with an air. The cake transaction remained a riddle, for Sally Folsom solemnly declared that she was playing tag in Mamie Snow's barn at that identical time. No one had been near the old house but the two children, and no one could throw any light upon that singular affair.|$|E
60|$|Master Hewlett {{stayed to}} assist in the second singing, and the children, who sat on low forms and on the chancel step, profited by it to make their voices more audible than the Commandments, though the clergyman had not gone to the altar, and once {{in the course of the}} sermon, Captain Carbonel was impelled to stand up and look over the edge of the pew, when he beheld a battle royal <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>over</b> a length of string, between a boy in a blue {{petticoat}} and one in a fustian jacket. At the unwonted sight, the fustian-clad let go, and blue petticoat tumbled over backwards, kicking up a great pair of red legs, grey socks, and imperfect but elephantine boots, and howling at the same time. The preacher stopped short, the clerk had by this time worked his way down from the gallery, and, collaring both the antagonists, hauled them out into the churchyard, the triple stamping being heard on the pavement all the way. The sermon was resumed and read to its conclusion. It was a very good one, but immensely beyond the capacity of the congregation, and Mary Carbonel had a strong suspicion that she had heard it before.|$|E

6000|$|The {{innocent}} first-fruits of Mota {{died three}} days later, and Mr. Patteson found a great howling and wailing <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>over</b> its little grave under a long low house. This was hushed {{when he came}} up, and spoke of the Resurrection, and described the babe's soul dwelling in peace in the Kingdom of the Father, where those would join it who would believe and repent, cast away their evil practices, and be baptized to live as children of God. Kneeling down, he prayed over it, thanking God for having taken it to Himself, and interceding for all around. They listened and seemed touched; no opposition was ever offered to him, but he {{found that there was}} much fighting and quarrelling, many of the villages at war with each other, and a great deal too much use of the bow and arrow, though the whole race was free from cannibalism. They seemed to want to halt between two opinions: to keep up their orgies on the one hand, and to make much of the white teacher on the other; and when we recollect that two unarmed Englishmen, and twelve blacks from other islands, were perfectly isolated {{in the midst of a}} heathen population, having refused protection from a British man-of-war, it gives a grandeur to the following narrative:-- ...|$|E
60|$|That was a sight {{not easily}} to be forgotten. But {{we need not}} have gone so far from home, at least, a few hundred years ago, to see an exactly similar one. The fens of Norfolk and Cambridgeshire, before the rivers were embanked, the water pumped off, the forests felled, and the reed-beds {{ploughed}} up, were exactly in the same state. The vast deposits of peat between Cambridge and the sea, often filled with timber-trees, either fallen or upright as they grew, and often mixed with beds of sand or mud, brought down in floods, were formed {{in exactly the same}} way; and if they had remained undrained, then that slow sinking, which geologists say is <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>over</b> the whole area of the Fens, would have brought them gradually, but surely, below the sea-level, to be covered up by new forests, and converted in due time into coal. And future geologists would have found--they may find yet, if, which God forbid, England should become barbarous and the trees be thrown out of cultivation--instead of fossil Lepidodendra and Sigillariae, Calamites and ferns, fossil ashes and oaks, alders and poplars, bulrushes and reeds. Almost the only fossil fern would have been that tall and beautiful Lastraea Thelypteris, once so abundant, now all but destroyed by drainage and the plough.|$|E

"Oh, dear, yes," [...] Felix replied, {{holding his}} hand out as he spoke to catch his companion's arm gently, and steady her against the wave that {{was just going to}} strike the stern: [...] "Excuse me; just so; the sea's rising fast, isn't it?--Oh, dear, yes; of course they are; they're all heathen and cannibals. You couldn't imagine to {{yourself}} the horrible bloodthirsty rites that may this very minute be taking place upon that idyllic-looking island, under the soft waving branches of those whispering palm-trees. Why, I knew a man in the Marquesas myself--a hideous old native, as ugly as you can fancy him--who {{was supposed to be a}} god, an incarnate god, and was worshipped accordingly with profound devotion by all the other islanders. You can't picture to yourself how awful their worship was. I daren't even repeat it to you; it was too, too horrible. He lived in a hut by himself among the deepest forest, and human victims used to be brought--well, there, it's too loathsome! Why, see; there's a great light on the island now; a big bonfire or something; don't you make it out? You can tell it by the red glare in the sky overhead."
