5|$|On December 17, Sony {{canceled}} the New York City premiere. Later that day, other major theater chains including AMC, Cinemark, Cineplex, Regal and Southern Theatres either delayed or canceled screenings of the film. The chains reportedly came {{under pressure from}} the malls where many theaters are located, which feared that the terror threat would harm their holiday sales. They also feared expensive lawsuits in the <b>event</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> attack; Cinemark, for instance, contended that it could not have foreseen the 2012 Aurora shooting, which took place at one of its multiplexes, a defense that would not hold in the <b>event</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> attack at a screening of The Interview.|$|E

5|$|Jane's {{reported}} in 2002 that Iraqi intelligence had found classified documents {{in his home}} about a U.S. attack on Iraq. When they raided the house, fighting broke out between Abu Nidal's men and Iraqi intelligence. In the midst of this, Abu Nidal rushed into his bedroom and was killed; Palestinian sources told Jane's {{that he had been}} shot several times. Jane's suggested Saddam Hussein had him killed because he feared Abu Nidal would act against him in the <b>event</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> American invasion.|$|E
5|$|New York Governor George Pataki urged {{residents}} to purchase emergency supplies and to fill cars with gasoline. The State Emergency Management Office began {{preparing for the}} hurricane about a week before it moved ashore. The office also issued a Level 1 emergency activation, with a planning unit readying contingency plans and in coordinating the efforts of other state offices. The state's National Guard began preliminary preparations for possible support efforts by reviewing the list of personnel able to be mobilized in the <b>event</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> emergency. Army and Air National Guard officials identified needed equipment in the <b>event</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> emergency, such as helicopters, generators, high-axle vehicles, and communications equipment. State police officers established contingency plans for personnel and equipment to assist as needed. The State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation ensured needed equipment were operational, and also secured buildings with sandbags to prevent flooding. Seven airlines allowed travelers potentially affected by the hurricane to reschedule their flights to a later date.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{after the}} Pearl Harbor attack, in December 1941, {{construction}} began on a hardened bunker {{to the east}} of the White House grounds that would provide a secure refuge for the president in the <b>event</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> air raid against the capital city. To hide construction of the facility from the public, the East Wing was built on top of the bunker. This facility would later become the Presidential Emergency Operations Center.|$|E
5|$|Soyuz {{spacecraft}} provided manned {{access to}} and from the station allowing for crew rotations and cargo return, and also functioned as a lifeboat for the station, allowing for a relatively quick return to Earth in the <b>event</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> emergency. Two models of Soyuz flew to Mir; Soyuz T-15 was the only Igla-equipped Soyuz-T to visit the station, whilst all other flights used the newer, Kurs-equipped Soyuz-TM. A total of 31 (30 manned, 1 unmanned) Soyuz spacecraft flew to the station over a fourteen-year period.|$|E

5|$|The 767 is {{equipped}} with three redundant hydraulic systems for operation of control surfaces, landing gear, and utility actuation systems. Each engine powers a separate hydraulic system, and the third system uses electric pumps. A ram air turbine provides power for basic controls in the <b>event</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> emergency. An early form of fly-by-wire is employed for spoiler operation, utilizing electric signaling instead of traditional control cables. The fly-by-wire system reduces weight and allows independent operation of individual spoilers.|$|E
5|$|The Army first {{established}} {{a presence in}} Ashford in 1797 when it built a garrison on Barrow Hill, and storerooms along what is now Magazine Road. The military presence was scaled back during the 19th century, though the town was still considered strategically important in the <b>event</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> invasion. The Territorial Army {{established a}} presence in Ashford in 1910.|$|E
5|$|The CGS {{warned that}} {{aftershocks}} were {{expected in the}} days following the earthquake and they could possibly continue for months. They recommended that buildings be evacuated in the <b>event</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> aftershock. The mining regulator's chief inspector of mines David Msiza asked mining companies in affected areas, including Klerksdorp, Carletonville and Rustenburg, to undertake underground inspections to ensure no miners were trapped and the working conditions were safe for miners. AngloGold Ashanti denied responsibility for the earthquake, saying it occurred away from its mining infrastructure.|$|E

5|$|As Upper Canada's administrator, Brock made {{a series}} of changes to prepare for war. He amended the militia act to allow use of all {{available}} volunteers and ordered enhanced training of these raw recruits, despite opposition from the provincial legislature. He continued strengthening and reinforcing defences. Brock also began seeking out First Nations leaders, such as the Shawnee chief Tecumseh, to build alliances with him against the Americans in the event of war. Although the conventional wisdom of the day was that Canada would fall quickly in the <b>event</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> invasion, Brock pursued these strategies to give the colony a fighting chance.|$|E
5|$|Considering the {{response}} to be unsatisfactory, de Gaulle began constructing an independent defence force for his country. He wanted to give France, in the <b>event</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> East German incursion into West Germany, the option of coming to a separate peace with the Eastern bloc instead of being drawn into a larger NATOâ€“Warsaw Pact war. In February 1959, France withdrew its Mediterranean Fleet from NATO command, and later banned the stationing of foreign nuclear weapons on French soil. This caused the United States to transfer two hundred military aircraft out of France and return control {{of the air force}} bases that it had operated in France since 1950 to the French by 1967.|$|E

Because of the increased power of the Saturn I, the Gemini spacecraft's ejection seats {{would not have been able}} to propel the crew far enough in the <b>event</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> explosion, so a launch escape tower was proposed, based on the one used on the Mercury spacecraft. The Titan IIIM was also considered to launch the heavier spacecraft.|$|E
5|$|Deddington Castle was {{a medieval}} {{fortification}} {{in the village}} of Deddington, Oxfordshire. It was built on a wealthy former Anglo-Saxon estate by Bishop Odo of Bayeux following the Norman conquest of England in 1066. Odo constructed a large castle with two earthwork baileys and a central motte, intending that the castle administer his property in the region and provide a substantial military base in the <b>event</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> Anglo-Saxon revolt. Odo's estates in England were seized following a failed rebellion against William II in 1088, and Deddington Castle was taken back into royal control. The Anglo-Norman lord William de Chesney acquired the castle in the 12th century and rebuilt it in stone, raising a stone curtain wall around a new inner bailey, complete with a defensive tower, gatehouse and domestic buildings.|$|E
5|$|Deddington Castle {{was built}} by Bishop Odo of Bayeux {{in the village of}} Deddington, shortly after the Norman conquest of England in 1066. Deddington was then one of the largest {{settlements}} in the county of Oxfordshire, and the site of the castle had been previously occupied by the Anglo-Saxons, who may have used the location to administer one of their landed estates. Odo was the half-brother of William the Conqueror, who granted the bishop vast lands in England after the invasion, spread across 22 different counties. Deddington was one of the richest of Odo's new manors and was at the centre of his Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire estates. The castle was probably built to act as the caput, or administrative centre, of his lands in the region, and may have also been intended to quarter a large military force in the <b>event</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> Anglo-Saxon revolt.|$|E
