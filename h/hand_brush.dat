Ukiyo-e artists owed a stable livelihood to such customs, and producing a piece of shunga for a high-ranking client could bring them sufficient funds to live on for about six months.

The actual cameo is mainly cut with a metal {{scraping}} tool called a bulino, an invention of Jewish artisan Antonio Cimeniello. A number of metal gravers are used: flat-faced, round and three-cornered. To speed production, grinding wheels are used to quickly remove excess material. When the details are completed, the shell is then soaked in olive oil, cleaned with soap and water and selectively polished with a <b>hand</b> <b>brush.</b>|$|E

Through the inheritance and development in the past dynasties, The freehand brush work has gradually became the most influential and popular genre.The freehand brush work emphasizes the semblance in the spiritual aspect. This kind of artwork doesn't chase for the physical similarity and the cooperation of reality. And it might be the essence of freehand brush work that it mostly grasps the most obvious or essential spiritual characteristics. The first rule of freehand brush work is the use of connotation which is a kind of spiritual meaning. It focuses on the personality and the cooperation of every element in the painting.|$|E

The {{goal of this}} study is for the robot to reproduce the whole procedure involved in human drawing. A drawing action is divided into three phases: obtaining a three-dimensional model, composing a picture model, and drawing by a robot. In this system, various feedback techniques including computer vision and force sensors are used. As experiments, an apple and a human silhouette are drawn on a canvas using this system. painter robot, imitation of humans by a robot, stereo vision, multi-fingered <b>hand,</b> <b>brush</b> manipulation 1...|$|E

While these injuries have been infrequent its our exper-ience (fourteen cases in ten years), one type of injury is sufficiently distinctive to merit some discussion. It seems to have received little attention in the literature although Holevich recently preseisted one card injury its a series of major acute hand itlj uries. The injury to be described occurs when the worker’s hand is damaged by the needled surfaces of the drums xvhich, in the card or picker machines, carry out a serial process of separating and combing wool fibers. Two procedures may cause the injury. Otse is waste cleaning in which wool material, which settles on guide plates facing certain of the drums, is manually removed while the drums are its motion, usually as they are decelerating after the machine has been turned off. The other is drum stripping, its which a wire <b>hand</b> <b>brush</b> is tangentially applied to the drum to remove accumulated wool debris. In the former operation, the hand is hooked and drawn between the plate and drum. In the latter, if the brush is snagged, the han...|$|E

40|$|Coatings {{applied to}} glass {{surfaces}} are {{an essential part}} of manufacturing {{in all parts of the}} glass industry. We present coating process to enhance the strength and reduce cost of the glass. Our approach is based on the glass coating using Liquid epoxidised natural rubber (LENR). One grades of ENR 25 having 25 mole % epoxidation were respectively used as the polymer coating. Toluene was used as the solvent to prepare the coating into solution for further testing. Coating on glass was carried out using a <b>hand</b> <b>brush</b> coating. For each coating sample, six composition of coating at various ENR with toluene ratio (1 : 15, 2 : 47, 2. 5 : 50, 3 : 54, 4 : 60, 5 : 72) were carried out to perform five testing which are viscosity, density, pH, drying time of coating and the strength of the adhesives. The result indicated that the most convenient coating solution compare from the entire sample composition ratio, sample E, ratio 4 : 60 is the coatings with average viscosity 631 cP and pH 8. 55 which act as alkaline coating that possibly protect the glass and have less environment impact. The density of sample E coating is 0. 895 g/cm 3. Moreover, the cure time of the coating is 360 s at 30 C, 240 s at 40 C and 180 s 50 C that higher drying temperature result in short dry time...|$|E
