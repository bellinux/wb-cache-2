5|$|Phaeacius {{does not}} try to eat other spiders' eggs, does not enter webs voluntarily, and moves away if it touches one accidentally. It can bite through the threads and pull {{strongly}} with its legs, but cannot escape from very sticky webs. This behaviour <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> <b>different</b> from that of its close relative, Portia, which hunts actively and can enter any type of web to catch spiders and their eggs.|$|E

5|$|The {{solar wind}} <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> <b>different</b> from a {{terrestrial}} wind, in that its origin is the sun, {{and it is}} composed of charged particles that have escaped the sun's atmosphere. Similar to the solar wind, the planetary wind is composed of light gases that escape planetary atmospheres. Over long periods of time, the planetary wind can radically change the composition of planetary atmospheres.|$|E
5|$|Both {{groups have}} a shell {{consisting}} of two valves, but {{the organization of the}} shell <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> <b>different</b> in the two groups. In brachiopods, the two valves are positioned on the dorsal and ventral surfaces of the body, while in bivalves, the valves are on the left and right sides of the body, and are, in most cases, mirror images of one other. Brachiopods have a lophophore, a coiled, rigid cartilaginous internal apparatus adapted for filter feeding, a feature shared with two other major groups of marine invertebrates, the bryozoans and the phoronids. Brachiopod shells are often made of calcium phosphate as well as calcium carbonate, whereas bivalve shells are composed entirely of calcium carbonate.|$|E
5|$|However, the Jain {{conception}} of ahimsa <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> <b>different</b> {{from what is}} commonly understood by violence. The violence is defined more by the motives and the consequences to the self {{rather than by the}} act itself. Furthermore, according to Jain Scriptures, destruction of less developed organism brings about lesser karmas than destruction of developed animals and karmas generated in observance of religious duties faultlessly disappears almost immediately. Hence, it is possible to observe complete nonviolence with right knowledge, even when some outward violence occurs to living beings in the course of performing religious duties by observing carefulness and pure mental disposition without any attachment.|$|E

5|$|The geology of Shetland <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> <b>different.</b> It is {{extremely}} complex, with numerous faults and fold axes. These islands are the northern outpost of the Caledonian orogeny {{and there are}} outcrops of Lewisian, Dalriadan and Moine metamorphic rocks with similar histories to their equivalents on the Scottish mainland. There are also small Old Red Sandstone deposits and granite intrusions. The most distinctive feature is the ultrabasic ophiolite, peridotite and gabbro on Unst and Fetlar, which are remnants of the Iapetus Ocean floor. Much of Shetland's economy depends on the oil-bearing sediments in the surrounding seas.|$|E
5|$|Electric power {{generated}} from wind {{power can be}} highly variable at several different timescales: hourly, daily, or seasonally. Annual variation also exists, but is not as significant. Because instantaneous electrical generation and consumption must remain in balance to maintain grid stability, this variability can present substantial challenges to incorporating large amounts of wind power into a grid system. Intermittency and the non-dispatchable nature of wind energy production can raise costs for regulation, incremental operating reserve, and (at high penetration levels) could require {{an increase in the}} already existing energy demand management, load shedding, storage solutions or system interconnection with HVDC cables. The variability of wind <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> <b>different</b> from solar, wind may be producing power at night when other baseload plants are often overproducing.|$|E
5|$|Favret {{points out}} that Wollstonecraft's Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> <b>different</b> from the despondent and plaintive love letters she {{actually}} sent to Imlay; the travel narrative much more closely resembles the personal journal in which she recorded her thoughts regarding the people she encountered and the places she visited. While her letters to Imlay contain long passages focused almost exclusively on herself, the Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark offers social commentary and sympathizes with the victims of disaster and injustice. To Imlay, Wollstonecraft represents herself as laid low by doubts, but to the world she depicts herself as overcoming all of these fears. She ruminates on them and transforms them into {{the basis of a}} letter akin to the open political letter popular during {{the last quarter of the}} eighteenth century, using her personal experience as the foundation for a discussion of national political reform.|$|E

5|$|The high walk of crocodilians, {{with the}} belly {{and most of}} the tail being held off the ground, is unique among living reptiles. It {{somewhat}} resembles the walk of a mammal, with the same sequence of limb movements: left fore, right hind, right fore, left hind. The low walk is similar to the high walk, but without the body being raised, and <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> <b>different</b> from the sprawling walk of salamanders and lizards. The animal can change from one walk to the other instantaneously, but the high walk is the usual means of locomotion on land. The animal may push its body up and use this form immediately, or may take one or two strides of low walk before raising the body higher. Unlike most other land vertebrates, when crocodilians increase their pace of travel they increase the speed at which the lower half of each limb (rather than the whole leg) swings forward; by this means, stride length increases while stride duration decreases.|$|E
5|$|The {{path of the}} Sun in {{the local}} sky {{over the course of}} a local day during Uranus's and its major moons' summer {{solstice}} <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> <b>different</b> from that seen on most other Solar System worlds. The major moons have almost exactly the same rotational axial tilt as Uranus (their axes are parallel to that of Uranus). The Sun would appear to follow a circular path around Uranus's celestial pole in the sky, at the closest about 7 degrees from it. Near the equator, it would be seen nearly due north or due south (depending on the season). At latitudes higher than 7°, the Sun would trace a circular path about 15 degrees in diameter in the sky, and never set.|$|E
5|$|The {{procedure}} requested, for {{an investigation}} into the hemodynamic changes in a patient with chronic venous insufficiency, which results in chronic venous disease, <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> <b>different</b> from an examination request made for suspected deep vein thrombosis. For a DVT investigation {{there is a need for}} guidance as to what to look for and to the intended treatment. An investigation performed with the intention of treating the patient by vein stripping or laser therapy for example is very different from the examination performed with the intention of executing a CHIVA. This French originated procedure is also spelt out as conservative hemodynamic treatment for chronic venous insufficiency. A CHIVA is an ultrasound guided, minimally invasive surgery strategic for the treatment of varicose veins, performed under local anaesthetic.|$|E

5|$|Other {{scholars}} such as Hazra and Rocher {{state that}} the Puranas are not a reliable source for dating Krishna or Indian history, because the content therein about kings, various peoples, sages, and kingdoms is highly inconsistent across the manuscripts. They state that these stories are probably {{based in part on}} real events, in part on hagiography, and in part embellished by expansive imagination. A high degree of inconsistency and manuscript corruption occurred particularly from the 12thcentury onwards, evidenced by cross referencing the texts; Matsya Purana, for example, stated that Kurma Purana has 18,000 verses, while Agni Purana asserts the same text has 8,000 verses, and Naradiya attests that the Kurma manuscript has 17,000 verses. The Puranic literature has gone through slow redaction and text corruption over time, as well as sudden deletion of numerous chapters and its replacement with new content to an extent that the currently circulating Puranas are completely different from those that existed before the 11thcentury, or 16thcentury. For example, a newly discovered palm-leaf manuscript in Nepal has been dated to be from 810CE, but <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> <b>different</b> from versions of the same Purana text that have been circulating in South Asia since the colonial era.|$|E
5|$|The vimana, {{also called}} the cella, {{contains}} the most sacred shrine wherein resides {{the image of the}} presiding deity. The vimana is often topped by a tower which <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> <b>different</b> on the outside than on the inside. Inside, the vimana is plain and square, whereas outside it is profusely decorated and can be either stellate ("star-shaped") or shaped as a staggered square, or feature a combination of these designs, giving it many projections and recesses that seem to multiply as the light falls on it. Each projection and recess has a complete decorative articulation that is rhythmic and repetitive and composed of blocks and mouldings, obscuring the tower profile. Depending on the number of shrines (and hence on the number of towers), the temples are classified as ekakuta (one), dvikuta (two), trikuta (three), chatushkuta (four) and panchakuta (five). Most Hoysala temples are ekakuta, dvikuta or trikuta, the Vaishnava ones mostly being trikuta. There are cases where a temple is trikuta but has only one tower over the main shrine (in the middle). So the terminology trikuta may not be literally accurate. In temples with multiple disconnected shrines, such as the twin temples at Mosale, all essential parts are duplicated for symmetry and balance.|$|E
