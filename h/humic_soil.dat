Default values for direct CO 2 emissions of artificially drained organic soils were increased by a factor of 1. 6 for cropland sites and by factors ranging from 14 to 24 for grassland sites. This highlights the role of drained organic soils as emission hotspots and makes their rewetting more attractive as climate change mitigation measures. Drainage emissions of <b>humic</b> <b>soils</b> are lower on a per hectare basis and not covered by IPCC default values. However, drainage of great areas can turn them into nationally relevant emission sources. National policy making that recognizes the importance of preserving organic and humic soils’ carbon stock requires data that is not readily available. Taking Ireland as a case study, this article demonstrates how a dataset of policy relevant information can be generated. Total area of histic and <b>humic</b> <b>soils</b> drained for agriculture, resulting greenhouse gas emissions and climate change mitigation potential were assessed. For emissions from histic soils, calculations were based on IPCC emission factors, for <b>humic</b> <b>soils,</b> {{a modified version of the}} ECOSSE model was used. Results indicated 370, 000 ha of histic and 426, 000 ha of <b>humic</b> <b>soils</b> under drained agricultural land use in Ireland (8 % and 9 % of total farmed area).

Seven fractions of either hydro- or organo-soluble components and a final unextractable humic residue were separated from soil.

The poor analytical capability at the time, the apparent similarities of the characteristics of humus in different soil classes and the impact of the then modern biopolymer techniques which, Frank Stevenson had adapted for humic studies for the Ph.D. degree at Ohio State University, brought him and others who followed to view humic substances as high-molecular-weight polyelectrolytes synthesized de novo in soil [1].

A non‒allophanic Andisol was used since this soil contains a large amount of humic substances and is only negatively charged. Thus, electrically, only repulsive force is generated between the soil and the surfactant.

The adsorption isotherm was examined using the Langmuir‒Freundlich‒Hill equation. The adsorbed amount increased sharply with increasing concentrations in the low‒concentration range. The sharp increase indicated cooperative adsorption caused by hydrophobic interaction among the carbon chains of adsorbing surfactants. The adsorption amount became higher at a lower pH because electrostatic repulsion between the soil and the surfactant decreased. The adsorption of dodecylbenzene sulfonate with a linear carbon chain was larger than that with a branched chain due to the diff erence of the carbon chain structure...|$|E

The amount of DBS adsorbed was measured with a batch method for different electrolyte concentrations of sodium chloride (NaCl) at pH 4. 5 and 6. 5. The adsorption site potential of the soil was obtained with the modified Langmuir adsorption equation. The adsorption of DBS decreased as the electrolyte concentration decreased and as the pH increased because the repulsive electric potential between DBS and the soil increased. These results were confirmed by the obtained adsorption site potential and the measured electrophoretic mobility. The difference between the adsorption of DBS with a linear and with a branched carbon chain was also detected, and this difference was related to the free energy of micellization. Because DBS adsorption is strongly affected by electrolyte concentration and pH, these two factors must be carefully considered to predict the fate of DBS in soil and water environments...|$|E

40|$|Abstract A {{survey of}} the {{interactions}} between phosphorus (P) species and the components of calcareous soils shows that both surface reactions and precipitation take place, especially {{in the presence of}} calcite and limestone. The principal products of these reactions are dicalcium phosphate and octacalcium phosphate, which may interconvert after formation. The role of calcium carbonate in P retention by calcareous soils is, however, significant only at relatively high P concentrations – non-carbonate clays play a more important part at lower concentrations. In the presence of iron oxide particles, occlusion of P frequently occurs in these bodies, especially with forms of the element that are pedogenic in origin. Progressive mineralization and immobilization, often biological in nature, are generally observed when P is added as a fertilizer. Manure serves both as a source of subsurface P and an effective mobilizing agent. Blockage of P sorption sites by organic acids, as well as complexation of exchangeable Al and Fe in the soil, are potential causes of this mobilization. Swine and chicken manure are especially rich P sources, largely due the practice of adding the element to the feed of nonruminants. Humic materials, both native and added, appear to increase recovery of Olsen P. In the presence of metal cations, strong complexes between inorganic P and humates are formed. The influence of <b>humic</b> <b>soil</b> amendments on P mobility warrants further investigation. </p...|$|E
