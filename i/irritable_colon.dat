50|$|Scientific {{evidence}} to recommend {{the use of}} A. belladonna in its natural form for any condition is insufficient, although some of its components, in particular l-atropine, which was purified from belladonna in the 1830s, have accepted medical uses. Donnatal is a prescription pharmaceutical, approved in the United States by the FDA, that combines natural belladonna alkaloids in a specific, fixed ratio with phenobarbital to provide peripheral anticholinergic/antispasmodic action and mild sedation. According to its labeling, it is possibly effective for use as adjunctive therapy {{in the treatment of}} irritable bowel syndrome (<b>irritable</b> <b>colon,</b> spastic colon, mucous colitis) and acute enterocolitis.|$|E
50|$|Bloating from {{irritable}} bowel syndrome (IBS) is {{of unknown}} origin but often results from {{an insult to the}} gut, and as such can overlap with infective diarrhea, celiac, and inflammatory bowel diseases (Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis). IBS is a brain-gut dysfunction that causes visceral hypersensitivity and results in bloating in association with recurrent diarrhea (or constipation) and abdominal pain. While there is no direct treatment for the underlying pathology of IBS, the symptom of bloating can be well managed through dietary changes that prevent the over-reaction of the gastrocolic reflex. Having soluble fiber foods and supplements, substituting dairy with soy or rice products, being careful with fresh fruits and vegetables that are high in insoluble fiber, and eating regular small amounts can all help to lessen the symptoms of IBS (Van Vorous 2000). Foods and beverages to be avoided or minimized include red meat, oily, fatty and fried products, dairy (even when there is no lactose intolerance), solid chocolate, coffee (regular and decaffeinated), alcohol, carbonated beverages, especially those also containing sorbitol, and artificial sweeteners (Van Vorous 2000). IBS is most commonly found in patients around the age of 20 and is found more often in women than men. In people with IBS, the intestines squeeze too hard or not hard enough and cause food to move too quickly or too slowly through the intestines. Other terms used to describe this condition include spastic bowel, spastic colon, and <b>irritable</b> <b>colon.</b> Symptoms of the condition will worsen as a person is placed under stress, during travel, and at other times when the daily routine is tampered with. Common symptoms include bloating, constipation, abdominal cramp or pain after bowel movement, or feeling like a movement is required even after one has been completed.|$|E
40|$|The {{prevalence}} of symptoms and stool patterns was assessed prospectively in 96 patients with ulcerative colitis subdivided {{according to the}} extent and activity of the disease. Increased frequency of defecation (83 %), urgency (85 %), a feeling of incomplete evacuation (78 %) and tenesmus (63 %) were the most frequent symptoms experienced by patients with active colitis. All were significantly more common (p less than 0. 001) in patients with active than quiescent colitis and their prevalence was similar in those with total and distal colitis, indicating that these symptoms are related to an inflamed and <b>irritable</b> distal <b>colon.</b> Twenty seven per cent of patients with active colitis voided hard stools indicative of constipation, however, and this was more common in active, than quiescent colitis (p less than 0. 05). This feature is probably secondary to faecal stasis in the proximal colon, and an apt description of the bowel disturbance in ulcerative colitis, irrespective {{of the extent of}} disease is that the colon suffers from proximal constipation and distal irritability...|$|R
50|$|Constipation {{has many}} causes. Common causes include slow {{movement}} of stool within the <b>colon,</b> <b>irritable</b> bowel syndrome, and pelvic floor disorders. Underlying associated diseases include hypothyroidism, diabetes, Parkinson's disease, celiac disease, non-celiac gluten sensitivity, colon cancer, diverticulitis, and inflammatory bowel disease. Medications associated with constipation include opioids, certain antacids, calcium channel blockers, and anticholinergics. Of those taking opioids about 90% develop constipation. Constipation is more concerning {{when there is}} weight loss or anemia, blood {{is present in the}} stool, there is a history of inflammatory bowel disease or colon cancer in a person's family, or it is of new onset in someone who is older.|$|R
40|$|Inadequate {{dietary fiber}} intake {{is common in}} modern diets, {{especially}} in children. Epidemiological and experimental evidence point to a significant association between a lack of fiber intake and ischemic heart disease, stroke atherosclerosis, type 2 diabetes, overweight and obesity, insulin resistance, hypertension, dyslipidemia, as well as gastrointestinal disorders such as diverticulosis, <b>irritable</b> bowel disease, <b>colon</b> cancer, and cholelithiasis. The physiological effects of fiber relate to the physical properties of volume, viscosity, and water-holding capacity that the fiber imparts to food leading to important influences over the energy density of food. Beyond these physical properties, fiber directly impacts a complex array of microbiological, biochemical, and neurohormonal effects directly through modification of the kinetics of digestion and through its metabolism into constituents such as short chain fatty acids, which are both energy substrates and important enteroendocrine ligands. Of particular interest to clinicians is the important role dietary fiber plays in glucoregulation, appetite, and satiety.

40|$|Although {{recent work}} has {{suggested}} that an abnormality of the 0. 05 Hz (3 c/m) slow wave electrical activity exists in the distal colon of patients with the <b>irritable</b> <b>colon</b> syndrome, it is not established whether this is related to altered bowel habit alone, {{or whether it is}} specific to the <b>irritable</b> <b>colon</b> syndrome. We have therefore studied 10 patients referred with this disorder and compared their colonic myoelectrical pattern with 10 patients suffering from assorted disorders with similar symptoms [...] for example, chronic pancreatitis, diverticular disease, ulcerative colitis, etc. Transit time, stool weights, percentage motility, and slow wave electrical activity were measured in each patient. The two groups were well matched for age and patients with similar symptoms in the two groups had similar values for transit time and percentage motility. There was a statistically significant increase in the 3 c/m electrical activity in patients with the <b>irritable</b> <b>colon</b> syndrome unrelated to the degree of diarrhoea or constipation. It would appear, therefore, that the abnormally high incidence of 3 c/m electrical activity in the colon is specific to the <b>irritable</b> <b>colon</b> syndrome and not merely a feature of altered bowel habit...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY The mean {{distance}} {{of travel and}} hourly incidence of propulsive and retropulsive movements of colonic contents have been assessed by means of time-lapse cinefluorography and compared in 98 patients with the <b>irritable</b> <b>colon</b> syndrome and in 90 control subjects. Net propulsion in patients with the <b>irritable</b> <b>colon</b> syndrome was less than in the controls at rest, similar to the controls after feeding, and greater than in the controls after an injection of carbachol. In both clinical groups, food and carbachol increased the incidence of propulsive and retropulsive movements but did not alter the average distance over which they travelled. The figures suggest that at least two-thirds of all net propulsion of colonic contents in the <b>irritable</b> <b>colon</b> syndrome takes place under circumstances not reproduced in the present study. The <b>irritable</b> <b>colon</b> syndrome has been recognized {{in one form or}} another for about 100 years; as the name implies, it has been studied almost exclusively from a clinical viewpoint. The early descriptions emphasized the tendency to secrete an excess of mucus (da Costa, 1871; Hale White, 1905). Later observers concentrated on the close association with psychological factor...|$|E
40|$|The Author(s) 2012. This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Abstract Inadequate dietary fiber intake {{is common in}} mod-ern diets, especially in children. Epidemiological and experi-mental evidence point to a significant association between a lack of fiber intake and ischemic heart disease, stroke athero-sclerosis, type 2 diabetes, overweight and obesity, insulin resistance, hypertension, dyslipidemia, as well as gastrointes-tinal disorders such as diverticulosis, <b>irritable</b> bowel disease, <b>colon</b> cancer, and cholelithiasis.

40|$|While most {{physicians}} and some patients consider psychosocial factors important in aggravating already existing {{inflammatory bowel disease}} (IBD), {{most of the information}} is based on a few recent scientific studies, varied anecdotal observations and a tendency for patients and some physicians to view psychosocial and stress-related issues with speculation, bias and some stigmatization. Patients with proctitis who have experienced recrudescence of mucosal friability and rectal bleeding within a day of a severe life stress provide a dramatic example of such anecdotes. Time-lag studies have indicated that stress, especially major life events, precedes illness aggravation in patients with IBD but that stress is not disease-specific. The symptoms studied, pain and diarrhea, {{were more likely to be}} physiological responses to acute stress rather than reflections of increased disease activity. Current scientific research supposes the prospect that environmental factors influence disease susceptibility through the central nervous system. Stress is associated with alterations in both humoral and cellular immune mechanisms in humans and in experimental animals. While psychosocial factors may not initiate inflammation in IBD, it is possible that they lead to alterations in the immune response and thereby alter disease activity. Mind-gut interactions affect salivation, gastric secretion, gastric motility and colonic motility, as well as numerous other gastrointestinal functions. These ‘physiological’ responses are expected in the IBD patient and perhaps will be accentuated by inflammation and its multiple effects on gut function. Because 10 to 13 % of the general population have a tendency to suffer from irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), it is expected that the same percentage of IBD patients will have both IBD and IBS. An example of clinically relevant alterations in pathophysiology is the association of acute proctosigmoiditis with an increase in IBS symptoms in the left colon. Pain and diarrhea based on distension of an <b>irritable</b> left <b>colon</b> after ileocolonic resection result from excessive distension of the left colon by the larger stool volume following loss of absorptive surface of the ileum and right colon. Patients with IBS are also more symptomatic with small amounts of unabsorbed carbohydrates, such as fructose, sorbitol and lactose. Patients with severe IBS have an irritable small bowel, especially when it is formed into a closed reservoir, such as an ileoanal pouch; these patients have at least eight to 10 bowel movements per day because of the spasticity and small capacity of the ileoanal pouch. The stomach to pouch transit time may also be quite rapid. Explaining the coexistence of IBD and IBS to the patient is often quite helpful to the patient and to the doctor. One hopes that the scientific explanations of these mind-gut interactions are forthcoming...|$|R
40|$|Functional {{disorders}} of the gut {{are regarded}} {{as the result of}} a complex interaction between factors of biological, social and psychological origin. Psychosocial interventions are expected to play a role in the management of patients with this type of symptom. The primary aim was to evaluate the outcome of a group treatment methodology, psychodrama, that has rarely been used for patients with gut disorders. Furthermore the aim was to study the co-variation between some personality functioning and some physiological variables related to functional gastrointestinal disorders. The treatment group consisted of 22 patients with the diagnosis <b>colon</b> <b>irritable,</b> irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) or non-ulcer dyspepsia (NUD) who were investigated before treatment, after the treatment and at the three year follow-up. They were recruited from a catchment area in the southern parts of Stockholm. The group consisted of 17 women and 5 men. Mean age was 47 years. The control group consisting of 28 patients was recruited in the same and was investigated at three occasions with the same time interval. The group consisted of 16 women and 12 men. Mean age was 42 years. Two groups of healthy subjects also took part in the study. Personality factors were measured with the Karolinska scales of personality and the Bergman scales of self-confidence and social dependency. Symptom change was measured with a questionnaire regarding symptoms from the upper and lower abdomen. Worry and tension was rated by means of a three graded scale and therapeutic factors with a modified version of the Yalom questionnaire. Blood tests were analysed with regard to the concentrations of gastrin, somatostatin and oxytocin. Symptom levels decreased at 3 -months after termination of treatment and tended to increase at the 3 year follow-up for both treatment and control groups. Worry and tension decreased in the treatment group at 3 months in a way that was not observed in the control group. Subjects who had learned a new coping behaviour during treatment reported fewer symptoms three years later. It was concluded that important factors for a successful outcome of psychodrama treatment seemed to be the patients active involvement in the treatment and social support outside treatment as well as a positive situation in the treatment, including group status, relation to the therapist and feed-back from the other group members. To learn new coping behaviours, however, seemed to be central for a positive outcome. The studies on the relationship between personality, stress stimulation and gastrointestinal hormones seemed to support the assumption that patients with functional gastrointestinal disorders have problems to find a balance between the expression of attachment and aggression. This psychological conflict was reflected in a different pattern of gastrointestinal hormones as compared to healthy subjects...|$|R
40|$|The <b>irritable</b> <b>colon</b> {{syndrome}} comprises two predominant symptom patterns [...] "spastic colon" {{with pain}} and constipation, and painless "nervous diarrhea". The two patterns frequently overlap. Low intake of dietary fibre is common to patients in both groups. Diagnosis of the <b>irritable</b> <b>colon</b> {{as a cause of}} diarrhea requires the characteristic symptom pattern and exclusion of organic disease. Management is based on common sense, careful reassurance of the patient, detailed explanation of the symptom pattern and explicit dietary advice.

40|$|A {{study was}} {{performed}} {{to determine the effect}} of bile acid perfusion on motility in the sigmoid colon of patients with the <b>irritable</b> <b>colon</b> syndrome compared with normal subjects. Deoxycholic acid (15 mM) statistically significantly increased motility in normal subjects (control 25. 0 +/- 6. 4 %, perfusion 71. 4 +/- 7. 2 %, P < 0. 05) but neither chenodeoxycholic acid nor cholic acid had any apparent effect. In patients with the <b>irritable</b> <b>colon</b> syndrome, however, deoxycholic acid at 5 mM concentration (control 29. 8 +/- 4. 2 %, during perfusion 57. 4 +/- 6. 5 %, P < 0. 05) as well as at 15 mM concentration (control 19. 4 +/- 5. 7 +, perfusion 57. 8 +/- 9. 6 %, P < 0. 05) statistically significantly increased rectosigmoid motility. Patients with the <b>irritable</b> <b>colon</b> syndrome had a high resting 0. 033 - 0. 066 Hz (2 - 4 c/m) electrical activity, whereas in normal subjects 0. 1 - 0. 15 Hz (6 - 9 c/m) activity was greater. However, there was no statistically significant alteration in either electrical rhythm during the period of bile acid perfusion. In conclusion, additional evidence is presented to suggest that deoxycholic acid is the only bile acid likely to be implicated in the motor disorder of the <b>irritable</b> <b>colon</b> syndrome...|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} is a {{follow-up}} of 34 cases admitted to a paediatric department with recurrent abdominal pain (RAP) in 1942 and 1943. 45 persons without a history of RAP were selected at random and included as controls.

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that a high incidence of 0. 05 Hz (3 c/m) slow wave electrical activity is present within the rectosigmoid of patients with the <b>irritable</b> <b>colon</b> syndrome during symptomatic phases. However, it is known that this is a chronic relapsing disorder and in this study we have compared myoelectrical recordings, using an on-line frequency analyser, during periods of severe symptoms and asymptomatic phases. Treatment with either bran (in the form of bran tablets) or an antispasmodic resulted in 12 of the 20 patients becoming free from symptoms after one to three months. In those patients who were initially constipated a statistically significant increase in mean stool weight and a decrease in mean transit time occurred, but this was not associated with any alteration in either percentage motility or electrical activity. In patients with predominant diarrhoea no statistically significant difference occurred in either transit time or stool weight after treatment nor did the abnormal myoelectrical activity return towards normal with symptomatic improvement. These results suggest that a fixed basic myoelectrical abnormality exists which is unrelated to symptoms. This may help to explain the chronic relapsing nature of the <b>irritable</b> <b>colon</b> syndrome...|$|E
40|$|The <b>irritable</b> <b>colon</b> {{syndrome}} {{is a very}} common disorder with no serious sequelae. The cause is unknown but low dietary bulk and psychological factors are believed important.

Serious organic diseases such as colitis and carcinoma of the colon must be firmly excluded. Treatment consists of sympathetic explanation and reassurance, increased dietary bulk and occasional judicious use of antispasmodic agents...|$|E
40|$|Sera from {{patients}} with ulcerative colitis (51), Crohn's disease (30), hypolactasia (13), untreated adult coeliac disease (11), <b>irritable</b> <b>colon</b> syndrome (24), and sera from 38 healthy control subjects were tested for antibodies {{to the principal}} cow's milk proteins-casein, alpha-lactalbumin, and beta-lactoglobulin. The red-cell-linked antigen-antiglobulin reaction {{was used to determine}} the titres of direct agglutinating antibodies and IgA and IgG incomplete antibodies. Apart {{from patients}} with coeliac disease, direct agglutinating antibodies were found infrequently and then in low titres. Approximately 50 % of subjects had low titres of IgA and IgG antibodies. However, the titres found in sera from patients with ulcerative colitis did not differ from those found in the control subjects or in patients with Crohn's disease, hypolactasia, or <b>irritable</b> <b>colon</b> syndrome. Patients with untreated coeliac disease frequently had high antibody titres to the milk proteins. In all subjects tested, incomplete antibodies of IgA or IgG immunoglobulin class occurred with equal frequency. The frequent occurrence in adults of low titres of antibodies to the milk proteins may be due to continued absorption of minute amounts of protein. Absorption of allergens may be facilitated by mucosal damage, such as that of coeliac disease, with stimulation of antibody production. At the present time, however, there is little evidence to suggest that milk allergy is a factor in the aetiology of ulcerative colitis...|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY Reaginic {{hypersensitivity}} in {{ulcerative colitis}} {{has been investigated}} in respect of a hypersensitivity to the cow's milk proteins {{and the frequency of}} atopic asthma, hay fever, and eczema. Intradermal tests were frequently positive, especially to casein, but the results did not differ from those found in healthy individuals and in groups of patients with Crohn's disease, hypolactasia, and the <b>irritable</b> <b>colon</b> syndrome.

An increased frequency of atopic diseases was found in patients suffering from ulcerative colitis (15. 7 %) and Crohn's disease (13. 3 O%) compared with the findings in a control group (1. 2 On). It is concluded that, if an allergy to milk proteins is a factor in the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis, it is not mediated by reaginic antibodies. It is possible, however, that the frequent occurrence of atopy indicates a susceptibility to develop reaginic responses even though this mechanism does not apply to the milk proteins.

40|$|Severe chronic {{constipation}} {{is defined}} as less than two bowel movements per week, hard stools, non productive urgency and the need of digital maneuvers in more than 25 % of bowel evacuations. The best studied causes of chronic severe constipation are slow bowel transit constipation and pelvic floor dysfunction. However, there are mixed forms that cross link with <b>irritable</b> <b>colon</b> syndrome. The main diagnostic tests are anorrectal manometry, bowel evacuation, X-ray studies and anorrectal sphincteromyomectomy, that can be therapeutic. Five percent of patients are surgical candidates. In cases of slow bowel movement, total colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis has satisfactory results in 80 to 90 % of patients. Some patients with pelvic floor dysfunction have an occult rectal prolapse, rectocele or sigmoidocele and obtain benefits with the correction of these conditions.

Authors stress the efficacy of sulphate-bicarbonate mineral waters in the therapy of biliary dyskinesias, namely gallbladder hypokinesia and Oddi's sphincter spasm, caused by their content in SO 4 = anion and Mg++ cation and related effects on paracrine-endocrine gastrointestinal system. In addition, they report the effects of sulphate-bicarbonate mineral waters in the lithogenic bile (sand bile), because of their diluting and washing activity. Among the sulphate-bicarbonate mineral waters, the Authors outline the well-documented therapeutic activity of Acqua Santa and Fucoli of Chianciano Terme. Acqua Santa has stimulating effect on cholecystis's motility, as proved by controlled clinical trials. Finally, the therapeutic use of sulphate-bicarbonate mineral water is discussed in functional dyspepsia, chronic primitive constipation and irritable bowel syndrome.

40|$|Objectives: Fibromyalgia (FM) is a {{syndrome}} {{characterized by}} chronic, diffuse musculoskeletal pain {{and by a}} low pain threshold at specific anatomical points (tender points). Numerous other conditions (Irritable bowel syndrome, tension-type headache, migraine headaches, etc.) may overlap with FM. Aim {{of this study was}} to evaluate the quality of life and associated clinical distress in patients with FM. Methods: 53 females affected by primary fibromyalgia and 40 healthy females were examined were examined by an experienced rheumatologist and interviewed using the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ). Clinical monitoring included Visual Analogue Scale for pain and pain pressure threshold measurements. Results: Mean FIQ scores were 66. 39 ± 14. 94 in FM patients and 13. 15 ± 5. 37 in control subjects and the difference was statistically significant. Among associated clinical distress higher frequencies have been found for paraesthesia (87 %), sleep disturbance (72 %), tension type headache (70 %), oto-vestibule syndrome (72 %) and <b>irritable</b> <b>colon</b> (60 %). An R. O. C. bend was developed in the presence of paraesthesias and oto-vestibule syndromes at the same time. This allowed us to identify a FIQ cut off value of 66. 85 so FM patients were divided into 2 groups according to their FIQ scores: severe degree and mild or slight degree. Conclusions: Based on our data, it would appear possible to use a FIQ value equal to or higher than 66. 85 for the clinical picture of FM to be classified as severe...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT This paper {{reviews the}} current status of {{knowledge}} with relation to the effects of natural fiber on intestinal physiology. The one clear feature that emerges from literature is that most types of natural fiber increase the bulk of the stool. It is probable also that transit time is af-fected. Transit time appears to be decreased in persons with initially a slow time when they use cer-tam forms of natural fiber {{and it may be that}} persons with rapid transit have a decrease in the rate of passage as fiber is added to the diet. Data on colonic intraluminal pressures are scanty, but those that exist seem to indicate that the addition of bran to the diet results in a decrease in overall colonic pressures. M uch has been written and speculated about the role of natural fiber in the prevention or therapy of <b>irritable</b> <b>colon</b> and diverticular disease. Clinical studies, while enthusiastic, are preliminary and there are no hard data to indicate that the use of these materials are, in fact, helpful. Such clinical trials that have been published are, in general, small, poorly controlled, and overall equivocal in their conclusions. A great deal of further work requires to be done to justify the claims that have been made on the role of fiber in altering normal or abnormal bowel habit. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 29 : 1427 - 1431, 1976. Diet has always been believed to play a...|$|E
40|$|We {{have found}} an {{intimate}} and specific correlation between phase of culture pattern of enterobacteriaceae and clinical findings upon culture of enterobacteriaceae from human feces. The {{relationship between these}} two was as follows: 1) Enterobacteriaceae of the healthy subjects shows a normal phase. Even if an abnormal phase is shown occasionally, the degree is rather mild and the duration transient. When the host has the disease, enterobacteriaceae shows a specific abnormal phase according to the kind and severity of the disease. 2) The phase of culture pattern of the feces was relatively stable {{in the third and}} fourth decade. After the fifth decade, abnormal phase readily increased along with the appearance of Candida albicans. 3) Phase of variation of feces culture and clinical findings. a) Abnormal phase in which a variation is seen in enterobacteriaceae besides proteus-providence group. This phase of variation is intimately related with the autonomic nervous disposition of the host. This is found clinically in <b>irritable</b> <b>colon</b> syndrome, vegetative dystonia, infantile diarrhea, and ulcer of the digestive system. b) Abnormal phase in which proteus-providence group appears predominantly. This abnormal phase indicates the presence of abnormality in amino acid and protein metabolism in the intestinal tract especially in {{the lower part of the}} small intestine of the host. This is found clinically with disturbance of liver function and infections disorder including viral infection in the host. c) Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas, and Candida usually appeared when changes were found in the feces culture phase or the culture phase was un- stable. 4) A long term observation of the feces culture phase is believed to be one of the useful methods to know the health state of the host...|$|E
