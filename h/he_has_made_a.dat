5|$|On Christmas Day, Archie tells Ian the CD of the {{recording}} is under Ian's Christmas tree for Jane, but Ian fails to find it. Archie tells Janine that they should skip Christmas dinner as <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> surprise treasure hunt for her. Janine eventually finds an envelope containing a one-way ticket to Poland and Archie throws her {{out onto the street}} telling her he knows how she and Ryan tried to double-cross him. Archie is visited by Jack who threatens to kill him if he hurts Ronnie again. Archie finds Ian searching his living room for the CD and Archie says it is on his laptop and he can make copies at any time, threatening Ian with a phone call to Jane, before ejecting him from the pub. Sam returns and attempts to confront Archie but he shuts the door on her. Ronnie then arrives and tells him with no emotion that he will not make her care for him and she would not care if he died. Archie throws her out onto the street reminding her that it was the exact spot she pushed Danielle onto the night she died.|$|E

5|$|Trescothick's first Test {{century was}} scored against Sri Lanka at Galle International Stadium in 2001, {{when he made}} 122. He then {{continued}} to score at least one century every year until his retirement from international cricket in 2006. His highest score of 219 was made against South Africa in 2003 at The Oval, London—his only double century. <b>He</b> <b>has</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> century in both innings of a Test match on only one occasion, against the West Indies in 2004 at Edgbaston. Despite being the first batsman to achieve this feat at Edgbaston, Trescothick was not named Man of the Match, as Andrew Flintoff's first-innings of 167 earnt him the accolade instead. During the 2005 series against Bangladesh, Trescothick scored centuries in both Test matches against the touring side, helping earn him a Man of the Series award. His 14 Test centuries have been scored at 11 grounds; nine were scored in England and the remaining five were scored at different venues. Trescothick has been dismissed twice between 90 and 99, against India in 2001 and Australia in 2005.|$|E

The lighter side of his style is a crossover between symphonic progressive rock, cinematic orchestra and new age. Sakuraba is also known for introducing many jazz-like improvisations to his music style. In recent years, <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> serious effort towards expanding his style even further, becoming an accomplished symphonist and a versatile arranger.|$|E
25|$|Although Foreman {{has never}} {{confirmed}} {{exactly how much}} he has earned from the endorsement, {{it is known that}} Salton paid him $138 million in 1999, for the right to use his name. Prior to that, he was paid about 40% of the profits on each grill sold (earning him $4.5 million a month in payouts at its peak), so it is estimated <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> total of over $200 million from the endorsement, substantially more than he earned as a boxer. Recently, Foreman has capitalized on the success obtained with the Foreman Grill to endorse InventHelp; the company behind INPEX (Invention and New Product Exposition); America's largest invention trade show.|$|E
25|$|Darren Lee Maddy (born 23 May 1974, Leicester) is an English cricketer {{who plays}} first class cricket for Warwickshire. He played three Tests and eight One Day Internationals for England, making one {{international}} fifty in his ten innings between 1998 and 2000 {{before he was}} finally dropped following the tour of Zimbabwe in 2000, where he made 53 in his final One-day International, {{when he made his}} debut against the touring South Africans. His first class batting average has been steadily declining since he made 1,187 runs in the 2002 season, and <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> total of three first class centuries in the period from 2003 to 2005, one of which was against Durham UCCE.|$|E

25|$|They leave, and the miserly yet pompous and moralistic Grand Duke Rudolph appears, heralded by his {{corps of}} chamberlains. He instructs {{them in the}} {{arrangements}} for his wedding {{the next day to}} the rich, but also miserly, Baroness Caroline von Krakenfeldt. She arrives, handing him a letter from his detective, and they sing about how exactly in agreement are their ideas on economy. Caroline is disconcerted that Rudolph insists on courting her in the market square, but he explains that <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> law compelling couples to do all courting in the square so as to increase the value of his properties around the square. She approves of this example of economy.|$|E
25|$|He {{was also}} {{selected}} for the Fourth Test against South Africa at Headingley in August 2003, taking a wicket in his first over (Neil McKenzie, caught behind by Alec Stewart off Kabir's fifth ball). He took five wickets in the match: 3–80 in the first innings and 2–56 in the second, including the key wicket of Gary Kirsten (for 130 and 60) in both innings. Nonetheless, England were soundly beaten and the selectors rang the changes, bringing in Steve Harmison and Ashley Giles for Kabir and James Kirtley. As of February 2015, that Headingley match remains Kabir's solitary Test appearance, although <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> number of further appearances at ODI level. His greatest success came against South Africa in 2004/05, when he took more wickets (13) than any other England bowler, and at Bloemfontein somehow conjured a tie from nowhere.|$|E
25|$|S.N. Bose was {{nominated}} by K. Banerji (1956), D.S. Kothari (1959), S.N. Bagchi (1962) and A.K. Dutta (1962) for the Nobel Prize in Physics, for {{his contribution to}} Bose–Einstein statistics and the unified field theory. For instance, Kedareswar Banerjee, head of the Physics Department, University of Allahabad, in a letter of 12 January 1956 wrote to the Nobel Committee as follows: “(1). He (Bose) made very outstanding contributions to Physics by developing the statistics known after his name as Bose statistics. In recent years this statistics {{is found to be}} of profound importance in the classifications of fundamental particles and has contributed immensely in the development of nuclear physics. (2). During the period from 1953 to date <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> number of highly interesting contributions of far-reaching consequences on the subject of Einstein’s Unitary Field Theory.” Bose's work was evaluated by an expert of the Nobel Committee – Oskar Klein, who did not see his work worthy of a Nobel Prize.|$|E

25|$|During the 2009–10 season, Bryant made six game-winning shots {{including}} a buzzer-beating, one-legged 3-pointer against the Miami Heat on December 4, 2009. Bryant considered the shot {{one of the}} luckiest <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>made.</b> <b>A</b> week later, Bryant suffered an avulsion fracture in his right index finger {{in a game against}} the Minnesota Timberwolves. Despite the injury, Bryant elected to continue playing with it, rather than take any time off to rest the injury. Five days after his finger injury, he made another game winning shot, after missing on an opportunity in regulation, this time against the Milwaukee Bucks in an overtime game. Bryant also became the youngest player (31 years, 151 days) to reach 25,000 points during the season, surpassing Chamberlain. He continued his dominant clutch plays making yet another game-winning three-pointer against the Sacramento Kings, and what would be the game-winning field goal against the Boston Celtics. The following day, he surpassed West to become the all-time leading scorer in Lakers franchise history. After being sidelined for five games from an ankle injury, Bryant made his return and made another clutch three-pointer to give the Lakers a one-point lead with four seconds remaining against the Memphis Grizzlies. Two weeks later, he made his sixth game-winning shot of the season against the Toronto Raptors.|$|E
