40|$|Abstract—The weight {{spectrum}} of sequences of binary linear codes that achieve arbitrarily small word error probability on {{a class of}} noisy channels at a nonzero rate is studied. We refer to such sequences as <b>good</b> <b>codes.</b> The class of <b>good</b> <b>codes</b> includes turbo, low-density parity-check, and repeat-accumulate codes. We show that a sequence of <b>codes</b> is <b>good</b> when transmitted over a memoryless binary-symmetric channel (BSC) or an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel {{if and only if}} the slope of its spectrum is finite everywhere and its minimum Hamming distance goes to infinity with no requirement on its rate growth. The extension of these results to code ensembles in probabilistic terms follows in a direct manner. We also show that the sufficient condition holds for any binary-input memoryless channel.

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{considers}} {{the problem of}} secure coding design for a type II wiretap channel, where the main channel is noiseless and the eavesdropper channel is a general binary-input symmetric-output memoryless channel. The proposed secure error-correcting code has a nested code structure. Two secure nested coding schemes are studied for a type II Gaussian wiretap channel. The nesting is based on cosets of a <b>good</b> <b>code</b> sequence for the first scheme and on cosets of the dual of a <b>good</b> <b>code</b> sequence for the second scheme. In each case, the corresponding achievable rate-equivocation pair is derived based on the threshold behavior of <b>good</b> <b>code</b> sequences. The two secure coding schemes together establish an achievable rate-equivocation region, which almost covers the secrecy capacity-equivocation region in this case study. The proposed secure coding scheme is extended to a type II binary symmetric wiretap channel. A new achievable perfect secrecy rate, which improves upon the previously reported result by Thangaraj et al., is derived for this channel. I...|$|R
50|$|The {{most widely}} applied {{regulatory}} scheme {{is that for}} the transportation of dangerous goods. The United Nations Economic and Social Council issues the UN Recommendations on the Transport of Dangerous Goods, which form the basis for most regional, national, and international regulatory schemes. For instance, the International Civil Aviation Organization has developed dangerous goods regulations for air transport of hazardous materials that are based upon the UN Model but modified to accommodate unique aspects of air transport. Individual airline and governmental requirements are incorporated with this by the International Air Transport Association to produce the widely used IATA Dangerous Goods Regulations (DGR). Similarly, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) has developed the International Maritime Dangerous <b>Goods</b> <b>Code</b> ("IMDG Code", part of the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea) for transportation of dangerous goods by sea. IMO member countries have also developed the HNS Convention to provide compensation in case of dangerous goods spills in the sea.|$|E

It is recommended to governments for adoption or for use {{as the basis for}} national regulations. [...] The implementation of the Code is mandatory in conjunction with the obligations of the members of united nation government under the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) and the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL 73/78).It is intended for use not only by the mariner but also by all those involved in industries and services connected with shipping.

A prime difference between the 6th and 5th editions of the Code {{is that the new}} Code no longer sets out the obligations and duties of the various persons involved in the transport of dangerous goods. Those are now set out in the Regulations. The Code is now a purely technical document. However, it should be read with the Regulations. In broad terms, the Regulations establish duties of various parties while the Code sets out the technical standards and procedures. The two documents are structurally harmonised. Part 3 of the Regulations deals with packaging and the corresponding technical requirements to meet the duties of those Regulations in Part 3 of the Code. An important feature of the Code is that it ensures Australia’s technical requirements for the road transport of dangerous goods are generally consistent with the Recommendations of the United Nations Committee of Experts on the Transport of Dangerous Goods." ...|$|E
