5|$|On August 1, 2017, at the 135th annual Supreme Convention in St. Louis, Missouri, Supreme Knight Carl A. Anderson {{announced}} a new uniform of the Fourth Degree to include a blue blazer with the emblem as a patch and on the buttons, a white shirt, a Fourth Degree tie, dark gray slacks and a beret with the emblem. According to some Catholic news sources, the new uniform is considered controversial by some of its members, drawing criticism for its attempt to make its members appear (at first <b>glance)</b> <b>to</b> be military veterans {{as opposed to a}} fraternal religious group.|$|E
25|$|The British central government's {{policy of}} {{cultural}} suppression against Highland culture culminated in 1747 when the Act of Proscription, which forbade {{the wearing of}} kilts by civilian males, went into effect. The Act was repealed in 1782 {{and in the early}} 19th century, there was something of a romanticisation of Highland culture (or such as it was imagined to be). This revival, later boosted greatly by Queen Victoria's enthusiasm for it, included the beginnings of the Highland games as we now know them. Highland dancing {{was an integral part of}} the Games from the very start of their modern revival, but the selection of dances performed at Games was intentionally narrowed down, mostly for the convenience of judges. Therefore, while the tradition of Highland games seemed at first <b>glance</b> <b>to</b> have fostered and preserved Highland dancing, many older dances got lost because nobody considered them worthwhile to practice, as they were not required for competition. The nature of these displays and competitions also affected the style of the dancing itself.|$|E
25|$|Bill Lawry (52) and Bobby Simpson (38) {{weathered}} the early storm of Fred Trueman and Brian Statham, edging a few through the slips and Trueman bowling out-swingers which moved {{just past the}} edge of the bat. Len Coldwell (2/58) came on the bowl his in-swingers, off which the openers managed to steal a few singles, until he managed to move the ball the other way and caught the edge of Simpson's bat for a catch behind at 62/1. Norm O'Neill came in until lunch when Australia went in on 93/1 off 22 overs in two hours, a total somewhat less than 15 overs an hour promised by Ted Dexter {{at the start of the}} tour. After lunch Lawry edged a ball from Statham between the wicket-keeper Alan Smith and Tom Graveney at first slip, the ball cutting back after it hit the turf. O'Neill was caught by Graveney off Statham (1/83), distracted by the loud racing commentary on a radio in the stands, Neil Harvey was bowled by Coldwell for a duck and Lawry by Trueman (3/83) and Australia lost three wickets for 1 run to be left 112/4. The rest of the innings was a grinding match as Dexter rested his fast bowlers and set defensive field until they returned and while all of the remaining Australian batsmen reached double figures none reached 50. Fred Titmus took his new best Test figures of 4/43 as he wheeled his way through the afternoon, trapping Peter Burge lbw for 23 when he swept once too often and having Brian Booth caught by Ken Barrington for 27 trying to repeat a fine <b>glance</b> <b>to</b> leg. Alan Davidson (40) and Ken Mackay (49) added 73 for the eighth-wicket and Mackay and Richie Benaud (36) 52 runs into the next day as they tried to wear down the bowlers. Titmus dismissed them both in the end, Benaud sweeping the ball the Barrington and Mackay lbw after some deliberation by Umpire Smyth. Trueman removed Garth McKenzie (16) after a last-wicket stand of 22 and Australia were all out for 316 with Barry Jarman on 10 not out.|$|E
30|$|During the {{secondary}} task, eye movement data were assessed {{in terms of}} number of <b>glances</b> <b>to</b> {{the secondary}} task display, mean duration of <b>glances</b> <b>to</b> the secondary task display, and max duration of <b>glances</b> <b>to</b> the secondary task display. The secondary task performance was assessed as well, {{counting the number of}} correct letters in order, the number of skipped letters, and the number of correct letters ignoring order. The last performance indicator was included to see whether the participants remembered the letters themselves but not the presentation order.|$|R
30|$|Furthermore, {{the total}} number of <b>glances</b> made <b>to</b> an {{in-vehicle}} Smart driving system was similar for each tested condition, at approximately 1100. Therefore <b>glances</b> <b>to</b> the system during the experimental condition must have been reallocated from a different location.|$|R

The sculpture appears at first <b>glance</b> <b>to</b> be an old fortification of interlinked walls and pathways sitting atop Windy Nook Pit Hill; local children refer to the artwork simply as 'the Fortress' In fact, the hill is a former slag heap and the 'ruins' are made from 2,500 tons of granite blocks salvaged from the old Scotswood Bridge. It was unveiled in 1986 during Gateshead Sculpture Week.|$|E
500|$|Writer and {{academic}} Mike Gonzalez believes the ensemble provoked a backward <b>glance</b> <b>to</b> [...] "timeless, sensual places where dreams and desire merged in a comfortable, evocative music". Gonzalez {{asserts that the}} aura evoked did not represent [...] "the real Cuba" [...] before the revolution of 1959, nor Cuba in the modern era, but that the Cuban government were happy for the tourist industry to [...] "enjoy the fruits of this confusion". The American Historical Review suggested that the Buena Vista Social Clubs mise en scène fueled nostalgic, idealistic feelings not only of many Americans and Cubans in the United States who remember the Havana of the 1950s, but also of Cubans in Cuba. The result was a reminiscence about the pre-revolutionary era—dominated by the politics of Gerardo Machado in the 1920s–30s and then General Fulgencio Batista until 1959—which [...] "no longer seems so bad".|$|E
500|$|Performance Car {{reviewer}} John Barker {{was also}} {{impressed with the}} performance {{as well as the}} ride and stability of the car, writing [...] "The V6 has a rumbly, loping note which, in league with a remarkably supple ride, belies the speed we are travelling at. I <b>glance</b> <b>to</b> the speedo and have trouble believing that it is indicating 170 mph." [...] Barker was also impressed with the engineering, saying [...] "this car is catalysed, fully homologated and has passed the same tests that a Volvo needs before going on sale," [...] going on to discuss how the vehicle looked at home on the racetrack thanks to the design. Autocars verdict was [...] "Right now, the XJ220 gives us a standard by which all other fast cars can be compared. For the few who will actually own and, hopefully, use their XJ220s, {{the fact that they are}} in command of the most accomplished supercar ever made should suffice." ...|$|E
40|$|Drivers’ eye glance {{behavior}} was examined {{as they drove}} {{on a variety of}} roadways that varied in visual clutter and {{the presence or absence of}} advertising billboards. Eye <b>glance</b> behavior appeared <b>to</b> be more heavily influenced by the nature of the driving task than by the stimulus attributes along the roadside. The mean proportion of <b>glances</b> <b>to</b> the road ahead ranged between 0. 80 and 0. 87 across conditions. The lowest mean proportion of <b>glances</b> <b>to</b> the road ahead was seen in conditions of high visual clutter, which contained off-premise billboards. Under high levels of clutter, drivers directed more <b>glances</b> <b>to</b> the left and right side of the road than under conditions of low clutter. The longest mean glance durations away from the forward roadway were to the right side of the road (0. 105 s) and not <b>to</b> billboards. Mean <b>glances</b> <b>to</b> billboards were 0. 078 s and 0. 087 s under low and high clutter environments, respectively. The results showed that level of visual clutter present in the highway environment affects how drivers glance at scenes. However, this did not appear to be at the expense of focusing on the forward roadway...|$|R
30|$|Third, {{with the}} {{indications}} of compensatory strategies and a cautious driving behavior [13], {{we assumed that}} participants with HL would be less willing to take their eyes off the road while performing the secondary task. We expected that secondary task performance would be lower, frequency of <b>glances</b> <b>to</b> the secondary task display would be higher, and duration of <b>glances</b> <b>to</b> the secondary task display would be shorter in the HL group than in the NH group.|$|R

The Star and Garter, though, through Lawson's [...] "pick, mix and match" [...] approach to different forms of classical architecture is {{in its own way}} quite unique.|$|E
2500|$|After several African prelates {{complained that}} there were no members from that continent, Pope Francis added African Cardinal Wilfrid Napier and Australian Archbishop Denis Hart to the committee. [...] The draft was divided in three parts: “listening, context, and {{challenges}} of the family,” “the <b>glance</b> <b>to</b> Christ: the Gospel of the Family,” and “the confrontation: pastoral perspectives.” [...] It was deemed a [...] "compromise document" [...] that reflected [...] "a spirited internal debate... over several major issues pertaining to the family and sexual morality." ...|$|E

Eye movement behavior was assessed during normal driving by the following performance indicators: number of glances away from the road; mean duration of glances away from the road; maximum duration of glances away from the road; and percentage of time looking at the road. During driving with the secondary task, eye movement data were assessed in terms of number of <b>glances</b> <b>to</b> the secondary task display, mean duration of <b>glances</b> <b>to</b> the secondary task display, and maximum duration of <b>glances</b> <b>to</b> the secondary task display.

2500|$|John Dorrien Magens sold Hammerwood to Oswald Augustus Smith (1826–1902; of Smith's Bank, later part of NatWest) in June 1864 for £37,250 (equating to {{approximately}} £4.2 million in 2015 pounds), of which £10,000 {{was for the}} timber. In 1865, the Smiths contracted S. S. Teulon {{with the intention of}} remodelling the house to their taste. Amongst other more subtle changes to the building, this included raising the attic over the central block to create a low third floor, whilst preserving Latrobe's façade. Work began on 8 May 1865; scholars Snadon and Fazio comment that [...] "Teulon integrated his additions so carefully with the existing fabric that it is difficult at first <b>glance</b> <b>to</b> discern them".|$|E
2500|$|Since {{there is}} no [...] "retardation" [...] (or aberration) of the {{apparent}} position {{of the source of}} a gravitational or electric static field when the source moves with constant velocity, the static field [...] "effect" [...] may seem at first <b>glance</b> <b>to</b> be [...] "transmitted" [...] faster than the speed of light. However, uniform motion of the static source may be removed with a change in reference frame, causing the direction of the static field to change immediately, at all distances. This is not a change of position which [...] "propagates", and thus this change cannot be used to transmit information from the source. No information or matter can be FTL-transmitted or propagated from source to receiver/observer by an electromagnetic field.|$|E
2500|$|Aside {{from the}} Childhood series, three other very popular Bulgarian films were also filmed from their screenplays. They are: Indian Summer (1973), Farsighted for Two Diopters (1976) and The Double (1980). After {{their first two}} [...] "Childhood" [...] films, Indian Summer seemed, at first <b>glance,</b> <b>to</b> be a serious {{departure}} from their previous work. The main characters are pensioners instead of young boys. The problems portrayed are different. There is some drama in this film but humour is still present in plenty. Indian Summer has a good deal {{in common with the}} films in the Childhood series, as both examine groups of similarly aged males from the inside out. No matter if they are pensioners or young boys, these groups and their specific problems {{are at the center of}} the narrative.|$|E
30|$|In study 1, whilst <b>glances</b> <b>to</b> the {{personal}} navigation device {{account for the}} majority of the increase in eyes off road time (in accordance with intuitive expectations), when the durations of the glances are analysed, there were very few which are 2  s or more in duration. The average glance was 0.76  s which compared with average duration of <b>glances</b> <b>to</b> other target areas of 0.6  s, well below the proposed NHTSA guidelines. In study 2, the main outcome was that the total number of glances made was similar for each condition, at approximately 1100. Therefore <b>glances</b> <b>to</b> the in-vehicle Smart driving system during the experimental condition must have been reallocated from a different location. Around 75  % of the glances were between 0.2 and 0.6  s – also well below the NHTSA proposed guidelines. The results of the study have important design implications for future in-vehicle information systems.|$|R

2500|$|The Riksbank has {{not taken}} a {{decision}} on issuing e-krona. First, the Riksbank needs to investigate a number of technical, legal and practical issues. [...] "The declining use of cash in Sweden means that this {{is more of a}} burning issue for us than for most other central banks. Although it may appear simple at first <b>glance</b> <b>to</b> issue e-krona, this is something entirely new for a central bank and there is no precedent to follow". If the Riksbank chooses to issue e-krona, it is not to replace cash, but to act as complement to it.

2500|$|Abbey's studies {{might seem}} at first <b>glance</b> <b>to</b> corroborate {{the theory that}} men {{tend to be more}} sexually {{attracted}} to the opposite sex. However, recent research by evolutionary psychologists and others suggests that the difference in attraction is exaggerated or nonexistent. [...] A study by Terri Fisher, Ohio State associate professor of psychology, [...] for example, concludes that previous studies are flawed in that women are seldom given sufficient anonymity when responding to surveys and interviews, and that women give answers that suggest that women have a sexual attraction for the opposite similar to that of men when greater levels of confidentiality are provided. Conversely, men are [...] "socialized" [...] to exaggerate such things as the number of partners that they have had. Fisher concludes that, [...] "Evidence clearly points {{to the fact that the}} gender difference in reported sex partners between men and women is an illusory difference created by attitudes related to sexual success as prestigious which in turn impact self-reports." ...|$|E
2500|$|Milgrom {{taught that}} the guilt or {{reparation}} offering in [...] might seem at first <b>glance</b> <b>to</b> {{be restricted to}} offenses against God's sanctum or name, but reflected wider theological implications. The Hebrew noun , asham, [...] "reparation, reparation offering," [...] {{is related to the}} Hebrew verb , asheim, [...] "feel guilt," [...] which predominates in this offering in [...] , and , and in the purification offering, as well, in [...] , and [...] and [...] Milgrom inferred from this relationship that expiation by sacrifice depended on both the worshiper's remorse and the reparation that the worshiper brought to both God and people to rectify the wrong. Milgrom noted that if a person falsely denied under oath having defrauded another, subsequently felt guilt, and restored the embezzled property and paid a 20 percent fine, the person was then eligible to request of God that a reparation offering expiate the false oath, as reflected in [...] Milgrom saw here Priestly lawmakers in action, bending the sacrificial rules to foster the growth of individual conscience, permitting sacrificial expiation for a deliberate crime against God (knowingly taking a false oath) provided that the person repented before being apprehended. Thus [...] ordains that repentance converted an intentional sin into an unintentional one, making it eligible for sacrificial expiation.|$|E
2500|$|While many {{contemporary}} designs portray ritual dances, {{at least three}} examples show scenes exceptionally similar to that on the Sutton Hoo helmet {{and contribute to the}} understanding of the depicted sword dance. The same design—identical but for a different type of spears held in hand, a different pattern of dress, and a lack of crossed spears behind the two men—is found on the Valsgärde 7 helmet, while a small fragment of stamped foil from the eastern mound at Gamla Uppsala is [...] "so close in every respect to the corresponding warrior on the Sutton Hoo helmet as to appear at first <b>glance</b> <b>to</b> be from the same die," [...] and may even have been [...] "cut by the same man." [...] The third similar design is one of the four Torslunda plates (...) , discovered in Öland, Sweden, in 1870. This plate, which is complete and depicts a figure with the same attributes as on design 1, suggests the association of the men in the Sutton Hoo example with [...] "the cult of Odin." [...] The Torslunda figure is missing an eye, which laser scanning revealed to have been removed by a [...] "sharp cut, probably in the original model used for the mould." [...] Odin too lost an eye, thus evidencing the identification of the Torslunda figure as him, and the Sutton Hoo figures as devotees of him.|$|E
