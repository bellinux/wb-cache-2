As RAAF {{pilots were}} now gaining their first exposure to jets elsewhere, No.2 OTU took {{over from the}} fighter squadrons the responsibility of converting trained jet pilots to Sabres. Reflecting its new primary role, it was renamed No.2 (Fighter) Operational Conversion Unit (No.2 OCU) in September 1958, and ceased Vampire courses the same month. Wing Commander Neville McNamara, later Chief of the Air Staff (CAS) and Chief of the Defence Force Staff, served as commanding officer from August 1959 until January 1961. During his tenure, the unit undertook exercises with No.75 Squadron at RAAF Bases Amberley, Townsville and Darwin. Two Sabre pilots from No.2 OCU and one from No.75 Squadron died in separate incidents early in 1960; each had attempted to eject at low level and suffered fatal head injuries from colliding with the aircraft's canopy during the <b>ejection</b> <b>sequence.</b> All RAAF Sabres were grounded until ARDU developed a modification to shatter the canopy immediately before the pilot ejected.|$|E

500|$|The B-52 {{then began}} the 360° left {{turn around the}} tower {{starting}} from about the midfield point of the runway. Located just behind the tower was an area of restricted airspace, reportedly because of a nuclear weapons storage facility. Apparently to avoid flying through the restricted airspace, Holland flew the aircraft in an extremely tight, steeply banked turn while maintaining the low, 250-foot (75m) AGL altitude. Approximately three-quarters of {{the way around the}} turn, at 14:16, the aircraft banked past 90°, descended rapidly, clipped power lines and hit the ground, exploding and killing the four crew members. McGeehan was seated in an ejection seat, but according to the medical statement, he had only [...] "partially ejected at the time of impact"; it does not state whether or not he cleared the aircraft. Huston was also seated in an ejection seat and the medical statement indicated that he had not initiated the <b>ejection</b> <b>sequence.</b> Wolff's seat was not ejection-capable. No one on the ground was injured.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{concept in}} solar physics {{that is known}} as loss of equilibrium in which a sequence of force-free magnetic fields, said to represent a possible quasi-static evolution of solar magnetic fields, reaches a critical configuration beyond which no acceptable solution of the prescribed form exists. This concept is used to explain eruptive phenomena ranging from solar flares to coronal mass <b>ejections.</b> Certain <b>sequences</b> of force-free configurations are discussed that exhibit a loss of equilibrium, and {{it is argued that}} the concept is devoid of physical significance since each sequence is defined a way that does not represent an acceptable thought experiment. For example, the sequence may be defined in terms of a global constraint on the boundary conditions, or the evolution of the sequence may require the creation of mgnetic flux that is not connected to the photosphere and is not present in the original configuration. The global constraints typically occur in using the so-called generating function method. An acceptance thought experiment is proposed to specify the field configuration in terms of photospheric boundary conditions comprising the normal component of the field and the field-line connectivity. Consider a magnetic-field sequence that, when described in terms of a generating function, exhibits a loss of equilibrium and show that, when one instead defines the sequence in terms of the corresponding boundary conditions, the sequence is well behaved...|$|R
40|$|Background—Heart valve surgery has an {{associated}} in-hospital mortality rate of 4 % to 8 %. This study aims {{to develop a}} simple risk model to predict the risk of in-hospital mortality for patients undergoing heart valve surgery to provide information to patients and clinicians and to facilitate institutional comparisons. Methods and Results—Data on 32 839 patients {{were obtained from the}} Society of Cardiothoracic Surgeons of Great Britain and Ireland on patients who underwent heart valve surgery between April 1995 and March 2003. Data from the first 5 years (n 16 679) were used to develop the model; its performance was evaluated on the remaining data (n 16 160). The risk model presented here is based on the combined data. The overall in-hospital mortality was 6. 4 %. The risk model included, in order of importance (all P 0. 01), operative priority, age, renal failure, operation <b>sequence,</b> <b>ejection</b> fraction, concomitant tricuspid valve surgery, type of valve operation, concomitant CABG surgery, body mass index, preoperative arrhythmias, diabetes, gender, and hypertension. The risk model exhibited good predictive ability (Hosmer-Lemeshow test, P 0. 78) and discriminated between high- and low-risk patients reasonably well (receiver-operating characteristics curve area, 0. 77). Conclusions—This is the first risk model that predicts in-hospital mortality for aortic and/or mitral heart valve patients with or without concomitant CABG. Based on a large national database of heart valve patients, this model has been evaluated successfully on patients who had valve surgery during a subsequent time period. It is simple to use, includes routinel...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Alström Syndrome (ALMS) is an {{extremely}} rare multiorgan disease caused by mutations in ALMS 1. Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a common finding but only one series has been investigated by Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR). METHODS: Eight genetically proven ALMS patients (ages 11 - 41) underwent CMR performed by standard cine steady state, T 1, T 2 and late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) <b>sequences.</b> <b>Ejection</b> fraction (EF), Diastolic Volume (EDV) and Systolic Volume normalized for body surface area (ESV), and mass indices were determined, as well as EDV/Mass ratio, an index expressing the adequacy of cardiac mass to heart volume. Regional fibrosis was assessed by LGE; diffuse fibrosis was measured by a TI scout sequence acquired at 5, 10 and 15 min after gadolinium by comparing inversion time values (TI) at null time in ALMS and control group. RESULTS: In one patient severe DCM was present with diffuse LGE. There were seven cases without clinical DCM. In these patients, EF was at lower normal limits or slightly reduced and ESV index increased; six patients had decreased mass index and EDV/Mass ratio. Mild regional non ischemic fibrosis was detected by LGE in three cases; diffuse fibrosis was observed in all cases, as demonstrated by shorter TI values in ALMS in comparison with controls (5 min: 152 ± 12 vs 186 ± 16, p 0. 0002; 10 min: 175 ± 8 vs 204 ± 18, p 0. 0012; 15 min: 193 ± 9 vs 224 ± 16, p 0. 0002). CONCLUSIONS: Cardiac involvement in ALMS is characterized by progressive DCM, associated with systolic dysfunction, myocardial fibrosis and reduced myocardial mass...|$|R

40|$|Neurons of the preoptic nucleus (PON) {{are capable}} of synthesizing cysteine-rich proteins. The time course study reveals the {{presence}} in the neural lobe of a (2 ̆ 735) S-cysteine labeled protein (Np), which first appeared at 4 hours after the isotope injection and persisted throughout the entire observation period of 5 days. The Np protein is tentatively identified as the neurophysin protein of Rana pipiens. The minimum rate of transport for neurophysin is calculated as 0. 9 mm/hr (22 mm/day). The Np protein can be further resolved by SDS-PAGE into 2 proteins, Np I (M. W. 23, 000) and Np II (M. W. 20, 100); or by isoelectric focusing in polyacrylamide gel into two proteins with pI = 4. 9, and pI = 4. 6. Also, two (2 ̆ 735) S-cysteine labeled proteins (pI = 5. 8 and pI = 5. 2) {{are present in the}} preoptic nucleus and infundibulum within one hour isotope injection. Preliminary evidence suggests a putative precursor role for the pI = 5. 2 protein;Axoplasmic transport in the hypothalamo-neurohypophysial system of the frog has been effectively blocked by microiontophoretic ejection of vinblastine into the median eminence. Paracrystalline structures, presumably formed by the binding of vinblastine to tubulin, fill many of the neurosecretory axons in the median eminence 1 and 3 days after the ejection. These paracrystals are thought to be the major cause for the blockade. Large axon dilatations (Herring bodies) are induced proximal to the ejection site at day 3, local disposal of NGVs by lysosomes is seen within these Herring bodies at day 8, {{and to a lesser extent}} at day 15. Herring bodies are no longer seen at day 30 after the <b>ejection.</b> The <b>sequence</b> of fine structural changes observed suggests that the blockade is reversible. The early (day 3 - 8) responses in the distal neural lobe are marked by the degeneration of some neurosecretory axons. Whereas fine structure recovery in both the hypothalamo-neurohypophysial tract and the neural lobe at later stages (day 15 - 30) imply a functional recovery;Microtubule protein, tubulin was purified to apparent homogeneity from porcine brain.

However, the addition of the MAP fraction to the PC-tubulin greatly facilitate in vitro assembly of the latter into microtubules with an average diameter of 21 nm. Monospecific antisera against glutaraldehyde cross-linked PC-tubulin or SDS-PAGE purified tubulin were obtained and used to stain the in vitro assembled microtubules by the unlabeled peroxidase-anti-peroxidase (PAP) method.

5000|$|... #Caption: Impact and <b>ejection</b> <b>sequence</b> of a Martian {{meteorite}}. At time A, {{the impact}} of meteorite in imminent. At time B, the meteorite has impacted, melting and introducing {{a large amount of}} energy into the surface. This surface energy propagates as a shock wave. At time C, the shock wave continues to propagate, a rarefraction wave pushes back towards the crater in response, and material is ejected from the crater. If any of this material is moving at a rate faster than the escape velocity(Ve=5.0 km/s) of Mars, it may leave the influence of Martian gravity. Mars has a minimum distance from earth of 54.6 million km that the ejecta would then have to travel with the perfect trajectory(dashed line) to impact on earth. This is, in part, why Martian meteorites are so rare on Earth.|$|E
5000|$|SHK's {{final report}} - not {{available}} in English - concluded that the plane had passed through the other aircraft's wake vortex while in a steep (−70 degrees) dive. When passing, the pilot's pitch command was [...] "up", but instead the vortex inflicted a large aerodynamic transient on the aircraft, throwing it down into an almost vertical (−85 degrees) dive. These factors combined to create an angle of attack that was too large for the command to be obeyed, and so the ground-collision warning system alerted the pilot that a turn to avoid a crash would require more than 10 g. The pilot elected to vacate the aircraft {{in accordance with the}} flight manual. At the same moment the vortex effect ceased, reducing the angle of attack to within flyable limits.

50|$|Once it was {{determined}} that the cockpit would be a sealed fireproof and blast-resistant capsule, inspired by the example of the Scott Crossfield incident in the X-15 rocket plane, consideration was then given to making the capsule ejectable. After studying examples from both aviation and 250 mph drag boat racing of ejectable or separable capsules, it was decided to pattern the capsule separation for RV1 largely after the drag boat model, in which the capsule separates only after a crash has already initiated. However, due to the much higher speeds and different motions expected in comparison to a drag boat if RV1 were to crash, it was decided to incorporate both a mechanism for actively ejecting the capsule and an aerodynamic decelerator. Banks of compressed air rams {{on each side of the}} capsule will serve as the ejection mechanism, with tilt switches mounted in the horizontal and vertical planes acting to initiate ejection without driver intervention. In the <b>ejection</b> <b>sequence</b> currently envisioned, if the RV1 pitches or rolls beyond preset limits, a tilt switch will open a solenoid valve that releases compressed nitrogen into the banks of rams. As the capsule is launched outward, the tension from a steel cable lanyard attached between the capsule and the chassis will pull a mechanism in the capsule that releases a ballute to decelerate and stabilize the capsule.|$|E

40|$|The {{initial phase}} of a {{military}} <b>ejection</b> <b>sequence</b> exerts substantial axial loads on the spinal column. Eccentric inertial loading on the thoracolumbar spine can lead to injury.

The objective of the current study was to understand characteristics of a military seat ejection by employing an experimental model designed to simulate the boost or in-rail phase. The model incorporates realistic boundary conditions and is capable of quantifying metrics associated with injury tolerance such as applied accelerations and resultant loads and spinal kinematics. A total of four human cadaveric spine specimens (T 12 -L 5) were tested. The test matrix consisted of two parts. The first part subjected specimens to sub-failure loading to outline spinal kinematics during dynamic vertical acceleration. The second part of the test matrix consisted of acceleration tests designed to induce compression and/or burst fractures as sustained by military aviators during ejection. The developed experimental model is the first to simulate realistic inertial loading during ejection-type accelerations using isolated osteoligamentous spines and may provide imperative injury mechanism data for future safety design considerations...|$|E
