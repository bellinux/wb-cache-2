The adsorbed layer thicknesses were determined by means of microelectrophoretic and viscometric methods. The conformation of the adsorbed molecules at the solid-liquid interface was deduced from the molecular areas and the adsorbed layer thicknesses. Comparison of the adsorption results obtained from polystyrene latex and ibuprofen particles was made to explain the conformation {{difference between these two}} adsorbates. Sedimentation volumes and redispersibility values were the main criteria used to evaluate suspension stability. At low concentrations of {{surface active agents}}, hard caked suspensions were found, probably due to the attraction between the uncoated areas or, the mutual adsorption of the adsorbed molecules on the bare surface of the particles in the sediment. At high concentrations of hydroxypropyl cellulose and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, heavily caked sediments were attributed to network structure formation by the adsorbed molecules. An attempt was made to relate the characteristics of the suspensions to the potential energy of interaction curves. Generally, the agreement between theory and experiment was good, but for hydroxyethyl cellulose-ibuprofen systems discrepancies were found. Experimental studies showed that hydroxyethyl cellulose flocculated polystyrene latex over a rather wide range of concentrations; similarly, hydroxyethyl cellulose-ibuprofen suspensions were also flocculated. Therefore, it ls suggested that a term to account for flocculation energy of the polymer should be added to the total energy of interaction. A rheometric method was employed to study the flocculation energy of the polymer...|$|R

50|$|Chemical cues are not {{the only}} factor when it comes to {{secretions}} by the uropygial gland. The sex, age and reproductive status are all factors as the sex is important as males are usually searching for females and vice versa for females; however, they are all attracted to male scents in some way. Age is an important factor as birds with 12- to 14-day-old nestlings are almost fully feathered causing lower levels of the main component in adults (<b>hexadecanol)</b> and greater proportions of methyl ketones compared with adults. This could be accredited to differences in diet or differences in the availability of resources. During the breeding period, adults release an increased level of pheromones also since their uropygial glands are larger while raising their nestlings. Intrasexual aggression is exhibited when males respond to other males pheromones released by the uropygial gland in order to mark their social dominance and their competitor territories. Intrasexual competition accounts for the preference by males for other male scents. Most of the blends of excretions are species-specific therefore many avian species are aware of their own species secretions making them less receptive to the cues released.|$|E

Evaporation of VOCs from open water basin in waste treatment facilities causes air-pollution and has been regulated in many countries. Reduction or prevention of VOCs evaporation from open water basin is then necessary. The aim of this research was to investigate the influence of surface film generated by an insoluble surfactant on the mass transfer coefficient of VOCs evaporating from water. <b>Hexadecanol</b> and octadecanol were used as surfactant in this investigation with the amount in the range of 0 to 35 μg/cm 2 and 0 to 25 μg/cm 2, respectively. The VOCs used in this study were methanol, acetone, methyl ethyl ketone and toluene. The experimental results showed that the surfactant film can reduce the gas film and liquid coefficients by 56 and 80 %, respectively. The suitable amounts of the surfactant were 25 μg/cm 2 for <b>hexadecanol</b> and 15 μg/cm 2 for octadecanol. From this investigation we can conclude that covering the water surface with a film of <b>hexadecanol</b> or octadecanol could significantly reduce the VOCs evaporation rate. Finally, the empirical equations correlating gas film and liquid film coefficient to amount of surfactants were developed and verified against the experimental data. The predicted values of the overall mass transfer coefficients, obtained by using these empirical equations, were in good agreement with the measured values.

This induces some significant structural changes and notably the formation of small unilamellar vesicles, nanometer scaled vesicles, L(sv). These structural changes have been measured and quantified using small angle neutron scattering, SANS. At a solution concentration of 25 mM, the DHDAB/C(12) E(12) mixtures have a structural evolution, from C(12) E(12) rich to DHDAB rich solution compositions, of small globular micelles, L(1), to micellar/vesicle coexistence, L(1) /L(v) or L(v) /L(1), to vesicle structures, L(v), bilamellar or multilamellar vesicles, blv or mlv. The impact of the {{addition of}} straight chain alkanols (in the range octanol to <b>hexadecanol)</b> depends upon the alkyl chain length and the amount of alcohol added. Furthermore, the effect of the addition of octanol and decanol appears to be distinctly {{different from that of the}} larger straight chain alkanols of dodecanol and <b>hexadecanol.</b> For the addition of octanol and decanol to C(12) E(12) rich DHDAB/C(12) E(12) mixtures, the alcohol is solubilized into the micellar core, and as the amount of alcohol added increases, significant micellar growth is ultimately observed. However, notably at intermediate DHDAB/C(12) E(12) solution compositions, in the region of L(1) /L(v) or L(v) /L(1) coexistance in the absence of alcohol, the addition of octanol or decanol promotes the formation of relatively small unilamellar vesicles, L(sv), nanometer sized vesicles, with a mean diameter in the range 70 - 140 A. For solutions that are rich in DHDAB, the addition of octanol or decanol results in a transition to L(v) /L(sv) coexistence and ultimately to L(v) formation. In contrast, the addition of the larger straight chain length alkanols, dodecanol or <b>hexadecanol,</b> to DHDAB/C(12) E(12) mixtures results in a somewhat different behavior. In this case, the addition of dodecanol or <b>hexadecanol</b> results in the transition from L(1) to L(1) /L(v) to L(v) occurring for solutions less rich in DHDAB than is observed in the absence of alcohol.

Similar results were obtained for hydrocortisone and its prodrugs when uptake was examined in the intestinal ring system; furthermore, rapid post-incubation freezing of the tissue coupled with an HPLC assay capable of separating drug from prodrug permitted determination of the species absorbed. In all cases, only free alcohol was detected in the tissue. Histological studies verified the integrity of intestinal tissue under experimental conditions. The in vitro ittechnique is advantageous for screening drug absorption. The very substantial potential of this prodrug approach is demonstrated in particular with <b>hexadecanol</b> and hexadecyl lysinate, where the uptake rate of the prodrug was four orders of magnitude greater than that of the free alcohol...|$|E
40|$|Agarwood is {{well known}} as one of {{expensive}} and valuable woods due to its high demand in the market. As part of ongoing research in establishing agarwood oil quality grading, this paper presents Direct Thermal Desorption (DTD) in extracting commercial, high and low quality of agarwood incense. The Gas Chromatography - Flame Ionization Detection (GC-FID) and Gas Chromatography - Mass Spectroscopy (GC-MS) then are followed to analyze the compounds. All the identified compounds are tabulated and plotted. The result showed that high quality sample yielded the highest number of compounds, 35, followed by commercial, 32 and low quality sample, 9. It revealed that the highest relative peak areas (%) for compounds in three types of sample are different to each other. They are 8. 98 % (γ-gurjunene) in high quality, 11. 95 % (agarospirol) in low quality and 17. 97 % (<b>hexadecanol)</b> in commercial. Nine compounds, α-guaiene, β-selinene, agarospirol, guaia- 1 (10), 11 -dien- 15 -al, pentadecanoic acid, <b>hexadecanol,</b> eudesmol, guaia- 1 (10), 11 -dien- 15, 2 -olide and 2 -(2 -phenylethyl) chromone exist in all samples but varied in their relative peak area (%). The finding using proposed method, DTD is significant, hence it will benefit further analysis especially for agarwood grading...|$|E
40|$|The Neotropical {{region has}} the highest {{freshwater}} sponge diversity in the world, {{with the presence of}} species of the families Metaniidae, Potamolepidae, and Spongillidae. Due to the remarkable lipid diversity in these organisms, this study aimed to characterize the sterols and volatile compounds of the sponge Trochospongilla paulula collected in the Tapajós River. Seven volatile compounds were identified, with the long-chain alcohols tetradecanol, pentadecanol, and <b>hexadecanol</b> representing 51. 65 % of this fraction. Cholesterol is the major sterol species, as reported for other species of the family Spongillidae; however, T. paulula may be distinguished by a chromatographic profile of its sterols...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability of}} monomolecular films of fatty {{alcohols}} in reducing evaporation of natural water samples collected from two reservoirs in São Paulo (Guarapiranga and Billings) was {{studied in the}} laboratory. Evaporation reductions were determined directly by measuring the volume of water evaporated from the test recipients after {{a certain period of}} time. Mixed films of <b>hexadecanol</b> and octadecanol showed high potential of evaporation reduction (up to 57 %) and persistence on the water surface of ca. 48 hours. A brief discussion on the better efficiency of these mixed films in reducing water evaporation is also presented...|$|E
40|$|Some {{functional}} {{groups in}} self-assembled monolayers {{have recently been}} identified in STM images, due to the chemical modification of gold tips [1]. In those studies, different molecules presenting different functional groups were investigated, resolving several molecular organizations [1 - 2, 4]. In this paper, we aimed at demonstrating that such chemically modified STM tips {{can be used to}} investigate phenomenon routinely observed with standard Pt/Ir tips, such as domain boundary dynamics in <b>hexadecanol</b> SAMs. It also allows transitory features to be identified. Moreover, rarely observed phenomena are also presented below, i. e. bilayers composed of wax esters molecules physisorbed at the phenyloctane/graphite interface...|$|E
40|$|The role of {{pheromone}} biosynthesis activating neuropeptide (PBAN) in {{the regulation}} of pheromone biosynthesis of several female moth species is well elucidated, but {{its role in the}} males has been a mystery for over two decades since its discovery from both male and female central nervous systems. In previous studies we have identified the presence of the gene transcript for the PBAN-G-protein coupled receptor (PBAN-R) in Helicoverpa armigera male hair-pencil-aedaegus complexes (male complexes), a tissue structurally homologous to the female pheromone gland. Moreover, we showed that this transcript is up-regulated during pupal-adult development, analogous to its regulation in the female pheromone-glands, thereby indicating a likely functional gene. Here we argue in favor of PBAN’s role in regulating the free fatty-acid components (myristic, palmitic, stearic, and oleic acids) and alcohol components (<b>hexadecanol,</b> cis- 11 <b>hexadecanol,</b> and octadecanol) in male complexes. We demonstrate the diel periodicity in levels of male components, with peak titers occurring during the 7 th– 9 th h in the scotophase, coincident with female pheromone production. In addition, we show significant stimulation of component levels by synthetic HezPBAN. Furthermore, we confirm PBAN’s function in this tissue through knockdown of the PBAN-R gene using RNAi-mediated gene-silencing. Injections of PBAN-R dsRNA into the male hemocoel significantly inhibited levels of the various male components by 58 %– 74 %. In conclusion, through gain and loss of function we revealed the functionality of the PBAN-R and the key components that are up-regulated by PBAN...|$|E
