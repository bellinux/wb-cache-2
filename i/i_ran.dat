5|$|As I {{was reading}} about Cope and Marsh, <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> across Knight as {{something}} of a bit player in their lives. As I got further into the Cope and Marsh story, and I liked the two less and less as people—which is different from liking them as characters, of course—I wanted to have a character in the book for the readers to root for, and neither of the scientists could fill that role. When I found out that Knight had met Cope just before Cope died, I became convinced that he was the character I needed.|$|E

To humor him, I looked under the bed and when I rose to assure him there was no one hiding there, he staggered and fell, a dead weight, in my arms. <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> across the hall and called in a woman doctor, Dr. Haberski, to examine him. She pronounced him dead.|$|E
5|$|In bold colors Geisel {{illustrated}} the surreal scenery and strange {{human and animal}} characters of the book with the strong, loose, energetic line that remained familiar in his later works. Ruth MacDonald saw Geisel's drawing style as fully formed in Mulberry Street, arguing that only his page design improved in later books, better keeping children's attention without confusing them. Philip Nel found the artwork in Geisel's later books {{to have a greater}} energy and looseness than in Mulberry Street or his earlier cartooning. Nel felt Geisel began loosening up toward his classic style as early as Horton Hatches the Egg (1940) and reached fruition with 1950's If <b>I</b> <b>Ran</b> the Zoo (1950).|$|E

25|$|After the war, Geisel {{focused on}} children's books once again, writing {{classics}} like If <b>I</b> <b>Ran</b> the Zoo (1950), Horton Hears a Who! (1955), If <b>I</b> <b>Ran</b> the Circus (1956), The Cat in the Hat (1957), How the Grinch Stole Christmas! (1957), and Green Eggs and Ham (1960). He published over 60 books during his career, which have spawned numerous adaptations, including 11 television specials, four feature films, a Broadway musical, and four television series.|$|E
25|$|After the war, Geisel and {{his wife}} moved to La Jolla, California where he {{returned}} to writing children's books. He wrote many, including such favorites as If <b>I</b> <b>Ran</b> the Zoo (1950), Horton Hears a Who! (1955), If <b>I</b> <b>Ran</b> the Circus (1956), The Cat in the Hat (1957), How the Grinch Stole Christmas! (1957), and Green Eggs and Ham (1960). He received numerous awards throughout his career, but he won neither the Caldecott Medal nor the Newbery Medal. Three of his titles from this period were, however, chosen as Caldecott runners-up (now referred to as Caldecott Honor books): McElligot's Pool (1947), Bartholomew and the Oobleck (1949), and If <b>I</b> <b>Ran</b> the Zoo (1950). Dr Seuss also wrote the musical and fantasy film The 5,000 Fingers of Dr. T, which was released in 1953. The movie was a critical and financial failure, and Geisel never attempted another feature film. During the 1950s, he also published a number of illustrated short stories, mostly in Redbook Magazine. Some of these were later collected (in volumes such as The Sneetches and Other Stories) or reworked into independent books (If <b>I</b> <b>Ran</b> the Zoo). A number have never been reprinted since their original appearances.|$|E
25|$|An {{editorial}} cartoon from July 16, 1941 {{depicts a}} whale {{resting on the}} top of a mountain as a parody of American isolationists, especially Charles Lindbergh. This was later rendered (with no apparent political content) as the Wumbus of On Beyond Zebra (1955). Seussian whales (cheerful and balloon-shaped, with long eyelashes) also occur in McElligot's Pool, If <b>I</b> <b>Ran</b> the Circus, and other books.|$|E
50|$|The unmarked verb form (as in run, feel) is the infinitive {{with the}} {{particle}} to omitted. It indicates nonpast tense with no modal implication. In an inherently stative verb such as feel, it can indicate present time (I feel well) or future in dependent clauses (I'll come tomorrow if I feel better). In an inherently non-stative verb such as run, the unmarked form can indicate gnomic or habitual situations (birds fly; <b>I</b> <b>run</b> every day) or scheduled futurity, {{often with a}} habitual reading (tomorrow <b>I</b> <b>run</b> the 100 meter race at 5:00; next month <b>I</b> <b>run</b> the 100 meter race every day). Non-stative verbs in unmarked form appearing in dependent clauses can indicate even unscheduled futurity (I'll feel better after <b>I</b> <b>run</b> tomorrow; I'll feel better if <b>I</b> <b>run</b> every day next month).|$|R

25|$|While officially {{running for}} the Democratic Presidential nomination, Lyndon LaRouche also decided to run as an Independent in the general election, {{standing}} as the National Economic Recovery candidate. LaRouche was in jail at the time, having been convicted of conspiracy to commit mail fraud in December 1988; {{it was only the}} second time in history that the presidency was sought from a prison cell (after Socialist Party candidate Eugene V. Debs, while imprisoned for his opposition to U.S. involvement in World War <b>I,</b> <b>ran</b> in 1920). His running-mate was James Bevel, a civil rights activist who had represented the LaRouche movement in its pursuit of the Franklin child prostitution ring allegations.|$|E
25|$|In January 1985, {{nine months}} before his death, the tour reached New York for a {{farewell}} Broadway run. Aware he was dying, he gave an interview on Good Morning America discussing the dangers of smoking and expressing his desire to make an anti-smoking commercial. The Broadway production of The King and <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> from January 7 to June 30 of that year, with Mary Beth Peil as Anna. His last performance marked the 4625th time he had {{played the role of}} the King. Meanwhile, Brynner and the American Cancer Society created a public service announcement using a clip from the Good Morning America interview.|$|E
500|$|Geisel {{returned}} to fictionalized versions {{of his home}} town in three later books, which, together with Mulberry Street, form what Donald Pease calls the Springfield Cycle. McElligot's Pool (1947), If <b>I</b> <b>Ran</b> the Zoo (1950), and If <b>I</b> <b>Ran</b> the Circus (1956) take place in different fictionalized versions of Springfield. Each also features a young protagonist who, when prompted by an adult, responds with [...] "a series of increasingly fantastic scenarios." [...] McElligot's Pool also marks Marco's return as a main character in a Dr. Seuss book.|$|E

[...] "There's no telling how much yardage I might have made if <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> as much as some backs do now," [...] he once said. Running back Jim Brown surpassed Motley's rushing records in the early 1960s, but many of Motley's coaches and fellow players {{regarded}} Motley as the better player, in part because of his strength as a blocker. [...] "There is no comparison between Jim Brown and Marion Motley," [...] Graham said at a luncheon in Canton in 1964. [...] "Motley was the greatest all-around fullback." ...|$|E
500|$|Michael Jackson wrote [...] "Speechless" [...] after a water balloon {{fight with}} {{children}} in Germany. It took him 45 minutes. In an interview with [...] Vibe magazine, the musician commented, [...] "I was so happy after the fight that <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> upstairs in their house and wrote 'Speechless'. Fun inspires me. I hate to say that, because it's such a romantic song." [...] He added, [...] "But it was the fight that did it. I was happy, and I wrote it in its entirety right there.

[...] Jackson would consider [...] "Speechless" [...] to be one of his favorite songs on Invincible.|$|E

[...] Watts' own early experiences in Hollywood parallel those of Diane's. She endured some professional frustration before she became successful, auditioned for parts in which she did not believe, and encountered people who did not follow through with opportunities. She recalled, [...] "There were a lot of promises, but nothing actually came off. <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> out of money and became quite lonely." ...|$|E

500|$|Forty-five drivers {{attempted}} to qualify; due to NASCAR's qualifying procedure, only forty-three could race. Keselowski clinched his first pole {{position in the}} Sprint Cup Series, {{with a time of}} 28.515. He was joined on the front row of the grid by Bowyer. Stewart qualified third, Jamie McMurray took fourth, and Juan Pablo Montoya started fifth. Johnson, one of the drivers in the Chase for the Sprint Cup, qualified twenty-fifth, while Harvick was scored in twenty-seventh. The two drivers who failed to qualify for the race were Jeff Green and Johnny Sauter. Once qualifying concluded Keselowski said, [...] "I felt I got a shot at the pole before I qualified but you never really know.

500|$|Madonna's vocal range spans {{almost one}} octave from F3 to D4. As {{she begins to}} sing the first verse, the bass pedal changes to C major, changes back to F during the chorus, and back to D minor during the chorus closure. This process is {{repeated}} during the second verse and chorus, which abruptly ends in a silence, with only the low and lifeless sound of the synthesizer, set in D minor. Madonna then starts to sing the bridge (or middle part)— [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> away, I'd never have the strength"— between the tonal keys of D and F, closing with the repetition of the chorus until the song gradually fades out. The original composition of the song {{did not have the}} background synths, instead Leonard created a basic structure on piano, and Madonna added the words on top of it. According to Leonard, Madonna came up with the bridge by herself, extending it from the music that he was playing.|$|E
