The public sector workforce is around 110,000, including education and healthcare. From 2006 to 2011, the <b>economy</b> <b>grew</b> by 2.5% in Copenhagen, while it fell by some 4% in the rest of Denmark.

More than 1,000 workers, {{most of whom}} were hired from outside Alaska, worked on the project through 1941. Despite these outside workers, the construction effort caused unemployment to almost vanish in Fairbanks, causing a large demand for labor. Fairbanks' <b>economy</b> <b>grew,</b> and the city's second/www.akhistorycourse.org/articles/article.php?artID=178> radio station, KFAR, began broadcasting on October 1, 1939.

30|$|Second, it {{is worth}} giving {{consideration}} to both economic growth and society’s development. Economic growth and society development can have four kinds of combinations: <b>economy</b> <b>grows</b> and society develops, <b>economy</b> <b>grows</b> while society does not develop, <b>economy</b> does not <b>grow</b> and society does not develop, <b>economy</b> does not <b>grow</b> while <b>economy</b> develops. China is trying to achieve the goal of <b>economy</b> <b>grows</b> and society develops, which includes improving the ecological environment, and improving the city and country dual structure. The previous growth pattern was, arguably, biased toward economic growth while neglecting environment and society development, which potentially leads to unsustainable development. Now, {{it is time to}} adjust the former way. This strategy has been reflected in the government’s recent policy changes, and in particular the decision of the CPC Central Committee which was announced in November 2013. That policy announced that environmental protection is an important indicator in evaluating China’s sustainability.|$|R

As the village expanded, it was divided into three quarters, one to the east, one to the west, and another known as Khirbat al-Khan. Each quarter was inhabited by one or more hamulas ("clans"); the al-Mahajina al-Tahta and al-Ghubariyya clans, the al-Jabbarin and al-Mahamid clans, and the al-Mahajina al-Fawqa clan.|$|E
5|$|The Southern Rhodesian <b>economy</b> <b>grew</b> {{considerably}} {{during the}} war despite the concurrent rise of war expenditure {{to pay for the}} expansion of the military and the air training scheme. Expenditure on the war grew from £1,793,367 in the financial year 1940–41 to £5,334,701 in 1943–44—total Southern Rhodesian expenditure on the air training scheme was £11,215,522. These sums, while tiny compared to those incurred by larger nations, were enormous when scaled against the white population of less than 70,000 that accounted for most of the colony's economic output. Annual costs for the air training scheme alone far exceeded the pre-war national budget.|$|E
5|$|Welfare was expanded, as {{characterized}} {{by the introduction of}} non-contributory old-age pensions and payments to mothers provided their babies are taken for health checks and that their children attend school. Hundreds of free tractors were also handed out. The prices of gas and many foodstuffs were controlled, and local food producers were made to sell in the local market rather than export. A new state-owned body was also set up to distribute food at subsidized prices. All these measures helped to curb inflation, while the <b>economy</b> <b>grew</b> (partly because of rising public spending), accompanied by stronger public finances which brought economic stability.|$|E

5|$|After {{many years}} of decline, the Sheffield economy {{is going through a}} strong revival. The 2004 Barclays Bank Financial Planning study {{revealed}} that, in 2003, the Sheffield district of Hallam was the highest ranking area outside London for overall wealth, the proportion of people earning over £60,000 a year standing at almost 12%. A survey by Knight Frank revealed that Sheffield was the fastest-growing city outside London for office and residential space and rents {{during the second half of}} 2004. This can be seen by the current surge of redevelopments, including the City Lofts Tower and accompanying St Paul's Place, Velocity Living and the Moor redevelopment, the forthcoming NRQ and the recently completed Winter Gardens, Peace Gardens, Millennium Galleries and many projects under the Sheffield One redevelopment agency. The Sheffield <b>economy</b> <b>grew</b> from £5.6billion in 1997 (1997 GVA) to £9.2billion in 2007 (2007 GVA).|$|E
5|$|Belgium {{continued}} to rule Rwanda as a UN Trust Territory after World War II, with {{a mandate to}} oversee its eventual independence. The economic landscape had changed considerably during the war; a cash <b>economy</b> <b>grew,</b> {{and with it the}} demand for labourers in the Congolese mines of Katanga and the coffee and sugar plantations of Uganda. There was a simultaneous shift in the Catholic Church; prominent figures in the early Rwandan church, who were from a wealthy and conservative background (such as Léon-Paul Classe), were replaced by younger clergy of working-class origin. Of these, a greater proportion were Flemish rather than Walloon Belgians and sympathised with the plight of the Hutu. Economic conditions and the seminary education provided by the church gave the Hutu a social mobility not previously possible, allowing the development of an elite group of Hutu leaders and intellectuals. This group, consisting of Hutu from the precolonial Kingdom of Rwanda, was joined by prominent citizens of kingdoms acquired during colonialism (including the Kiga).|$|E
5|$|Cuba's <b>economy</b> <b>grew</b> in 1974 as {{a result}} of high {{international}} sugar prices and new credits with Argentina, Canada, and parts of Western Europe. A number of Latin American states called for Cuba's re-admittance into the Organization of American States (OAS), with the U.S. finally conceding in 1975 on Henry Kissinger's advice. Cuba's government underwent a restructuring along Soviet lines, claiming that this would further democratization and decentralize power away from Castro. Officially announcing Cuba's identity as a socialist state, the first National Congress of the Cuban Communist Party was held, and a new constitution adopted that abolished the position of President and Prime Minister. Castro remained the dominant figure in governance, taking the presidency of the newly created Council of State and Council of Ministers, making him both head of state and head of government.|$|E

5|$|Mugabe's {{government}} {{continued to}} make regular pronouncements about converting Zimbabwe into a socialist society, although did not take concrete steps in that direction. In contrast to Mugabe's talk of socialism, his government's budgetary policies were conservative, operating within a capitalist framework and emphasising the need for foreign investment. In office, Mugabe sought a gradual transformation away from capitalism and tried to build upon existing state institutions. From 1980 to 1990, the country's <b>economy</b> <b>grew</b> {{by an average of}} 2.7% a year, but this was outstripped by population growth and real income declined. The unemployment rate rose, reaching 26% in 1990. The government ran a budget deficit year-on-year that averaged at 10% of the country's gross domestic product. Under Mugabe's leadership, there was a massive expansion in education and health spending. In 1980, Zimbabwe had 177 secondary schools, but by 2000 this number had risen to 1,548. During that period, the adult literacy rate rose from 62% to 82%, one of the best records in Africa. Levels of child immunisation were raised from 25% of the population to 92%.|$|E
5|$|The {{value of}} all {{consumer}} goods manufactured in 1972 in retail prices was about 118 billion rubles ($530 billion). The Era of Stagnation, a term coined by Mikhail Gorbachev, is considered by several economists {{to be the worst}} financial crisis in the Soviet Union. It was triggered by the Nixon Shock, over-centralisation and a conservative state bureaucracy. As the <b>economy</b> <b>grew,</b> the volume of decisions facing planners in Moscow became overwhelming. As a result, labour productivity decreased nationwide. The cumbersome procedures of bureaucratic administration did not allow for the free communication and flexible response required at the enterprise level to deal with worker alienation, innovation, customers and suppliers. The late Brezhnev Era also saw an increase in political corruption. Data falsification became common practice among bureaucrats to report satisfied targets and quotas to the government, and this further aggravated the crisis in planning.|$|E

5|$|Rwanda's {{electricity}} supply was, {{until the early}} 2000s, generated almost entirely from hydroelectric sources; power stations on Lakes Burera and Ruhondo provided 90% of the country's electricity. A combination of below average rainfall and human activity, including the draining of the Rugezi wetlands for cultivation and grazing, caused the two lakes' water levels to fall from 1990 onwards; by 2004 levels were reduced by 50%, leading to {{a sharp drop in}} output from the power stations. This, coupled with increased demand as the <b>economy</b> <b>grew,</b> precipitated a shortfall in 2004 and widespread loadshedding. As an emergency measure, the government installed diesel generators north of Kigali; by 2006 these were providing 56% of the country's electricity, but were very costly. The government enacted a number of measures to alleviate this problem, including rehabilitating the Rugezi wetlands, which supply water to Burera and Ruhondo and investing in a scheme to extract methane gas from Lake Kivu, expected in its first phase to increase the country's power generation by 40%. Only 18% of the population had access to electricity in 2012, though this had risen from 10.8% in 2009. The government's Economic Development and Poverty Reduction Strategy for 2013–18 aims to increase access to electricity to 70% of households by 2017.|$|E
