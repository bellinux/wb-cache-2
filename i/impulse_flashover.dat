This work demonstrates {{that the presence of}} Al 2 O 3 nanoparticles decreases the SEE coefficient of LDPE and enhances the impact energy at the equilibrium state of surface charging. These changes {{can be explained by the}} increase of surface roughness and of surface ionization energy, and the strong interaction between nanoparticles and the polymer dielectric matrix. The surface charge and flashover voltage are calculated according to the secondary electron emission avalanche (SEEA) model, which reveals that the positive surface charges are reduced near the cathode triple point, while the presence of more nanoparticles in high loading samples enhances the gas desorption.

The <b>impulse</b> critical <b>flashover</b> (CFO) voltages of many overhead line insulators are determined for single and multiple (porcelain, fiberglass, polymers and wood). Laboratory investigation and studies relating to the evaluation of CFO values of distribution lines for multiple dielectrics are reported.

Many engineers concerned with the design or operation of high voltage transmission lines have devised methods to estimate the performance of lightning impulse. There is, at present, no such method available on estimating the insulation strengths of multiple dielectrics of distribution lines subjected to impulse CFO.

40|$|Utilization of {{remotely}} located {{sustainable energy}} {{resources such as}} solar, wind and hydro calls for further developments of long-distance electric power transmissions operating at ultra-high voltage (UHV) levels which may exceed 1000 kV ac and 800 kV dc utilized today. It is foreseen that insulation of such transmission systems is {{to be based on}} polymeric materials that can provide a number of technical benefits over traditionally used glass and porcelain based insulation. As several studies have provided evidences of possible deterioration of withstand properties of polymeric insulators when electric charges are accumulated on their surfaces, especially under dc and impulse stresses, {{there is a need for}} acquiring knowledge on the mechanism lying behind such influences for improving design of polymeric insulators as well as related testing methodology. The research presented in the thesis focuses on three main subjects, i. e. surface charging of polymeric insulation materials by external corona discharges, surface charge decay on thick material layers and impact of surface charges on dc and <b>impulse</b> <b>flashover</b> performance of model insulators. Charging of polymeric surfaces was analyzed by utilizing a computer model describing development of corona discharges in air. Validity of the model was verified by comparing the calculated and measured corona currents in a needle-plane electrode system with a dielectric barrier. The simulations showed, depending on time regimes of the applied voltage, formation of either positive glow or burst current pulses that led to different conditions of charge deposition on the polymeric surface. The distributions of deposited charges were further investigated by measuring potential distributions along surfaces of flat and cylindrical samples of silicone rubbers, typically used for insulator manufacturing. The obtained results demonstrated existence of significant differences in the surface charge patterns for different charging conditions. Dynamic behavior of the deposited surface charges was studied on fresh and aged samples of the silicone rubbers. The developed experimental procedure allowed for distinguishing between the effects of surface charge neutralization through the bulk of polymeric material or by so-called gas neutralization, the latter being conditioned by presence of free ions in the surrounding air. It was found that increased amount of free ions in the air as well as aging of the material accelerated strongly the charge decay process. For the aged materials the decay became sensitive to air wetness. At the same time, the characteristics measured under bulk neutralization regime were utilized for estimating the conductivities of the studied materials. The impact of surface charging on flashover performance of polymeric insulator models was analyzed experimentally and theoretically. In the experimental study, a cylindrical composite insulator model was used, which consist of a fiberglass-epoxy rod covered with a layer of silicone rubber. The surface of the insulator was charged to various magnitudes and negative dc flashover voltage levels were determined. The obtained results demonstrated that deposition of a negative surface charge enhanced the dc withstand level, whereas deposition of positive charge reduced it. The dc flashover voltages of the charged insulator model were also calculated by means of a model utilizing streamer breakdown criteria. The measured and the calculated dc flashover voltages remained in good agreement for the utilized charging conditions. This further allowed using the model for simulating the influence of surface charging on <b>impulse</b> <b>flashover</b> performance of insulators. A parametric study was performed to investigate the effects of charge magnitude, its polarity and location on the insulator surface. The simulations shown that the dependence of <b>impulse</b> <b>flashover</b> voltage on charge polarity and concentration was similar to that of dc flashover voltage for the cases when the insulator was located far away from the ground (symmetry with regard to voltage polarity). However, when the insulator was standing on a grounded plane, the effect of surface charging was dependent on the polarity of the applied impulse voltage. In the case of positive impulse, presence of positive charge increased the flashover voltage, whereas negative charge yielded their reduction and vice versa...|$|E
40|$|Lightning is {{the leading}} cause of power interruptions on {{overhead}} transmission lines. The insulators used on overhead 69 kV and 138 kV transmission lines are likely to flashover whenever there is a direct lightning strike on the phase conductors due to their relatively low insulation levels. However, significant improvement can be achieved with the appropriate design of transmission line tower structures. This paper presents an analysis of the shielding failure flashover rate (SFFOR) occurrence on both 69 kV and 138 kV transmission tower lines and tower structures. This analysis is based on an electro-geometrical model recommended by the IEEE Standards 1243 : 1997. The analysis accounts for the striking distance of the geometry of the transmission lines and tower structures, the critical <b>impulse</b> <b>flashover</b> voltage (CFO) of the insulators, the statistical distribution of lightning current parameters and the keraunic level of the location of the lines. The proposed assessment is supported by the recommendations of CIGRE TB 549 (2013) for lightning parameters, which define the statistical distributions of lightning current parameters. The results show that shielding angle lower than 30 degrees predicts substantially lower SFFOR. Also, insulators with higher CFO ratings contribute to lower SFFOR. The analysis presented, therefore, could be applied to the design of high voltage transmission line support structures...|$|E
40|$|The great {{increase}} of electrical power demand in Japan has been requiring {{a great amount}} of electric power transmission. To cope with that, the power transmission line voltage trends to rise from the extra-high voltage (EHV) to the ultra-high voltage (UHV). 　In UHV transmission systems, the performance of system insulations under switching impulses becomes {{the most important factor in}} the insulation design of the systems because the reduced insulation is adopted in such systems from the economical point of view. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the switching impulse wave-forms for the most adequate insulation design of the UHV transmission systems, and to clarify the switching <b>impulse</b> <b>flashover</b> characteristics. 　As the results, it was clarified that the switching impulse waveforms which occur in the UHV transmission systems vary from 1000 μs to 5000 μs, and moreover, the V-t characteristic curves for positive polarity seem to reach the minimum at about 300 - 500 μs. It has been found from this test that the duration of wave-front at which the flashover voltage reaches the minimum value becomes larger as the gap spacing is longer, and the 50 % flashover voltage curves decrease when the duration of wave-front decreases from 5000 μs to 1800 μs...|$|E

40|$|Nowadays {{polymeric}} materials are widely applied in outdoor high voltage insulation systems gradually replacing traditionally used porcelain and glass. It {{is believed that}} polymer based insulation will become dominant at ultra high voltages, e. g. in 1000 kV ac and 800 kV dc overhead transmission lines, which are presently being developed. Although withstand performance of polymeric insulating materials has been studied over the years, {{there is still a}} lack of complete physical understanding of all important aspects related to practical situations. Thus, the behavior and performance of {{polymeric materials}} for high-voltage applications in presence of accumulated surface charges, which can be generated in practice due to different sources (e. g. corona, surface discharges, space charge build-up, etc), are not completely understood today. This phenomenon needs to be considered when designing insulation systems and when performing insulator testing, especially for high-voltage dc (HVDC) applications where presence of surface charges is the inherent property of the system.

40|$|The surface {{dielectric}} strength of insulating materials in a non-uniform electric field under impulse voltages is investigated with emphasis given on {{the influence of}} humidity. Research on interactions between electrical discharges and insulating surfaces is of great importance, not only from the physical but also from the applications standpoints. In addition, the surface {{dielectric strength}} of insulators determines to a great extent the reliability of high voltage systems. Outdoor insulation systems, comprising of air gaps together with ceramic or polymeric insulators, are often subject to high voltage transients, thus their efficient design requires knowledge of the surface dielectric behaviour of insulators under such conditions. Interactions between electrical discharges and insulating surfaces involve multiple physical processes many of which are not yet fully understood. Moreover, minimal data are available in literature concerning the effects of atmospheric conditions on flashover. Thus, in the present study surface <b>impulse</b> <b>flashover</b> along smooth cylindrical insulating surfaces bridging a 12 cm long rod-plane gap is investigated; the insulating surface material, the waveshape and polarity of the applied impulse voltage, as well as absolute humidity were considered as influencing parameters. The main conclusions of the thesis are summarized as follows. The initial corona in the presence of an insulator initiates earlier, under lower voltage and is associated with lower charge, because of the electric field enhancement near the rod tip. However, near threshold inception conditions the initial corona inception field decreases with the insulating surface material permittivity, a fact that can be attributed to enhanced photo-ionisation around the rod tip. Under positive lightning impulse voltages the flashover voltage is lower in the presence of an insulating surface. Flashover is closely related to secondary corona inception, the spark channel develops away from the insulating surface, a behaviour found characteristic for polymeric insulating surfaces but not for the case of porcelain. Under positive switching impulse voltages the flashover voltage is higher in the presence of an insulating surface. Flashover is closely related to streamer arrival at the earthed plane. Under positive impulse voltages, flashover voltage increases with increasing absolute humidity. The inhibitory effect of humidity on flashover voltage is similar to that observed for the pure air gap for the cases where the spark channel develops away from the insulating surface. The effect of humidity is reduced when the spark channel develops close to the insulating surface. In general, for insulating arrangements where at flashover the spark channel adheres to the insulator surface the IEC atmospheric conditions correction procedure could be optimized by considering a reduced humidity correction factor. Under negative impulse voltages, the flashover voltage is lower in the presence of an insulating surface, a fact that could be attributed to the lower average field required for surface streamers to cross the full gap. Negative corona development is favoured by the insulating surface, the spark channel adheres {{to the surface of the}} insulator. The effect of humidity on flashover voltage is minimal, the IEC atmospheric conditions correction procedure yields satisfactory results. ...|$|E
