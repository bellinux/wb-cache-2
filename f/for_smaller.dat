5|$|According {{to current}} knowledge, B.sessilis as an {{extremely}} hardy plant that {{grows in a}} range of soils and aspects, so long as it is given good drainage, and tolerates both drought and moderate frost. Unlike many dryandras, it grows well on limestone (alkaline) soils. It flowers very heavily and is an excellent producer of honey. It attracts birds, and is also popular with beekeepers. However, its size makes it unsuitable <b>for</b> <b>smaller</b> gardens, and if given an ideal situation it may produce a great many seedlings. It is propagated only from seed, as propagating it from cuttings has proven virtually impossible. Germination takes about five or six weeks, and plants may take two years to flower.|$|E
5|$|Although the Merger Agreements were principally {{intended}} <b>for</b> <b>smaller,</b> non-viable states, {{they were}} also applied to a few larger states.

Bhopal, whose ruler was proud of the efficiency of his administration and feared that it would lose its identity if merged with the Maratha states that were its neighbours, also became a directly administered Chief Commissioner's Province, as did Bilaspur, much of which was likely to be flooded on completion of the Bhakra dam.|$|E

50|$|<b>For</b> <b>small</b> samples the chi-squared {{approximation}} is overly sensitive, often {{rejecting the}} null hypothesis when it is true. Furthermore, the distribution of p-values departs from a uniform distribution and becomes a right-skewed uni-modal distribution, especially <b>for</b> <b>small</b> p-values.

5|$|Banded sea kraits {{primarily}} feed on {{varieties of}} eels, but also eat small fish.

In addition, females hunt {{for only one}} prey item per foraging bout, while males often hunt for multiple items. After hunting, the banded sea kraits return to land in order to digest their prey.|$|E
5|$|Boult's {{recordings}} {{fall into}} three main periods. In the first, from 1920 {{to the end}} of the 1940s, he recorded almost exclusively for HMV. In the 1950s and early 1960s, he was less in demand by the major labels, and although he made a substantial number of discs for Decca, he recorded mostly <b>for</b> <b>smaller</b> labels, chiefly Pye Nixa. His last period, from the mid-1960s, sometimes referred to as his Indian Summer, was once again with HMV. With his regular collaborators the producer Christopher Bishop and the engineer Christopher Parker he made more than sixty recordings, re-recording much of his key repertoire in stereo. He also added many works to his discography that he had not recorded before.|$|E
