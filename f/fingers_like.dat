5|$|Hygrophorus eburneus, {{commonly}} known as the ivory waxy cap or the cowboy's handkerchief, is a species of edible mushroom in the waxgill family of fungi. It is widespread in Europe and North America, and has also been collected in northern Africa. The fruit bodies are medium-sized, pure white, and when wet are covered in a layer of slime thick enough to make the mushroom difficult to pick up. The gills are broadly attached to the stem or running down it; as the family name suggests, they feel waxy when rubbed between the <b>fingers.</b> <b>Like</b> all Hygrophorus species, the fungus is mycorrhizalâ€”a symbiotic association whereby the underground fungal mycelia penetrate and exchange nutrients with tree roots. They are common in a variety of forest types, where they grow on the ground in thickets or grassy areas. Hygrophorus eburneus is the type species of the genus Hygrophorus. A number of biologically active chemicals have been purified from the fruit bodies of the fungus, including fatty acids with bactericidal and fungicidal activity.|$|E
25|$|Sandoz {{becomes a}} slave/pet of a famed poet-songwriter, whose {{broadcasts}} first alerted Earth to Rakhat's existence. Sandoz is physically disfigured. In that culture, {{it is considered}} an honour to be dependent upon another, and likewise to have a dependent, a mutilation analogous {{to the practice of}} foot binding. The flesh between Sandoz's metacarpal bones is cut away to make it seem that he has long elegant <b>fingers</b> <b>like</b> the hasta'akala plant (which grows on a stronger tree and is thus dependent). The disfiguration starts at Sandoz' wrists, and with which he cannot even feed himself. Sandoz, imprisoned in his master's home, is routinely forced to sexually satisfy the musician, along with his friends and colleagues. It is later revealed the songs which Sandoz had originally considered to be a divine revelation are in fact a kind of ballad pornography celebrating rape, relating the songwriter's sexual exploits on broadcast to the populace.|$|E
25|$|Surrounded in mystery, {{the object}} of fear, hatred, and even worship {{by members of the}} Church of the Final Atonement (the Shrike Cult), the Shrike's origins are {{described}} as uncertain. It is portrayed as composed of razorwire, thorns, blades, and cutting edges, having <b>fingers</b> <b>like</b> scalpels and long, curved toe blades. It has the ability to control the flow of time, and may thus appear to travel infinitely fast. The Shrike may kill victims in a flash or it may transport them to an eternity of impalement upon an enormous artificial 'Tree of Thorns,' or 'Tree of Pain' in Hyperion's distant future. The Tree of Thorns is described as an unimaginably large, metallic tree, alive with the agonized writhing of countless human victims of all ages and races. It is also hinted in the second book that the Tree of Thorns is actually a simulation generated by a mystical interface which connects to human brains via a strong and pulsing (as if it were alive) cord.|$|E

40|$|A novel {{dialysis}} membrane with {{monosodium glutamate}} (MSG) as an additive has been fabricated and its performance evaluated {{in terms of}} urea clearance. Nine formulations of casting solutions had been designed with 20 % cellulose acetate, and different ratio of formic acid/MSG. The result shows that MSG based membrane with the 6 wt % of MSG, achieved the best urea clearance, 53. 2 %. SEM images illustrated that the increment of MSG in casting solution tends to promote macrovoids formation and finally transits to <b>finger</b> <b>like</b> structure. However, when the amount of MSG is further increased beyond 6 wt%, the urea clearance reduced and the macrovoids structure disappeared. Thus, enlarged <b>finger</b> <b>like</b> structure favors the dialysis process...|$|R

5000|$|A wind controller, {{sometimes}} referred to as a [...] "wind synth", or [...] "wind synthesizer", is a wind instrument capable of controlling one or more music synthesizers or other devices. Wind controllers are most commonly played and <b>fingered</b> <b>like</b> a woodwind instrument, usually the saxophone, with the next most common being brass fingering, particularly the trumpet. Models have been produced that play and <b>finger</b> <b>like</b> other acoustic instruments such as the recorder or the tin whistle. One form of wind controller, the hardware-based variety, uses electronic sensors to convert fingering, breath pressure, bite pressure, finger pressure, and other gesture information into control signals. Another form of wind controller uses software to convert the acoustic sound of an unmodified wind instrument directly into MIDI messages. In either case, the control signals or MIDI messages generated by the wind controller are used to control internal or external devices such as analog synthesizers or MIDI-compatible synthesizers, softsynths, sequencers, or even lighting systems.|$|R
