40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} identifying the worst case dependence structure of a portfolio X 1, [...] ., Xn of d-dimensional risks, which yields the largest risk of the portfolio. Unlike in the one-dimensional case the worst case portfolio structure is not independent {{of the way of}} measuring risk. Based on a recent characterization result of law invariant convex risk measures the worst case portfolio structure is identified as a µ-comonotone risk vector for some worst case scenario measure µ. It turns out that typically there will be a <b>diversification</b> <b>effect</b> even in worst case situations. The only exeptions arise when risks are measured by translated max correlation risk measures. We determine the worst case portfolio structure and the worst case <b>diversification</b> <b>effect</b> in several classes of examples as for examle in elliptical, i Euclidean spherical and in Archimedian distribution classes.

40|$|The {{knowledge}} of equity style {{of mutual funds}} has benefited investors by mitigating the issue of asymmetric information between fund managers and investors. Having information of portfolio risk enables investors to do risk budgeting. In this study, style analysis by Sharpe (1992) is used to decompose the fund returns into various asset classes. Subsequently, Value-at-Risk (VaR) measure is applied to calculate the portfolio risk based on Jorion (2007). Notably, this study finds that: First, VaR of value style funds is higher than VaR of growth style funds for both diversified and undiversified VaR. Second, adding international stocks as an asset class increases the undiversified VaR for both value and growth style funds. Third, growth style funds exhibit more portfolio <b>diversification</b> <b>effect</b> than value style funds as measured by reduction in diversified VaR. Fourth, adding international stocks to the portfolio intensifies the <b>diversification</b> <b>effect</b> and finally, on individual fund level, asset allocation explains the riskiness of the portfolios.

40|$|So far, {{regulatory}} capital requirements for credit risk portfolios are calculated in a bottom up approach by determining the requirements at asset level and then adding up them.

A study of how the institutional transition and the resultant ‘institutionally rooted evolution ’ of business groups affect the diversification outcomes of affiliated firms will therefore help to deepen our understanding of this unique organizational form. Approach: This study uses the 2001 - 2005 data on listed firms from the Chinese textile industry and estimates the <b>diversification</b> <b>effects</b> of all firms in the sample and {{the differences in the}} <b>diversification</b> <b>effects</b> between group-affiliated firms and their stand-alone counterparts. Results: A positive relationship is found between the listed textile firms ’ unrelated diversification and their firm value during the period 2001 - 2005. Furthermore, the results indicate that group affiliation has complicated impacts on the diversification-performance relationship of the listed firms. Although group-affiliated firms are more successful in pursuing unrelated diversification when compared with stand-alone firms, such a difference in performance outcomes is statistically weak (as measured by Tobin’s Q). Furthermore, it is found that group-affiliated firms perform related diversification worse than their stand-alone counterparts (as measured by both ROA and Tobin’s Q).
