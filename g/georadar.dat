The <b>georadar</b> examinations had confirmed the location of a grave under the floor north of the southern octagon chapel, where written sources say King Magnus the Good, Olav Haraldsson's son, had been buried. The <b>georadar</b> examinations also indicate that already the choir of the first wooden church here, located where the present octagon stands, may have been octagonal as in other early martyr's churches.|$|E

Also, a {{battlefield}} of a raging battle between nearly 20,000 men should have produced rich archeological findings to that effect; at Stiklestad, however, these are sparse. This however, is common in Norway - the rocky soil is not as well suited to battlefield archaeology like continental and English soil, it makes <b>georadar</b> readings all but unusable {{and the location of}} the battle site highly uncertain. On Stiklestad, however, the soil is deep soil with some clay, and <b>georadar</b> has been used in 2008, showing traces of large buildings, but not much to indicate a battlefield.

5000|$|Many {{stories have}} seen the light of {{publication}} for the small church of Saint Theodora of particular religious importance, mainly related to its creation, the Saint that has given him her name and its story in general that also involves a [...] "miracle". The building of the small church, visited each year by many believers is of the Byzantine era and besides {{the jurisdiction of the}} Church it is also under that of the Ministry of Culture as a Byzantine Monument. The geophysical team of the University of Patras tried to add to the restoration of this preserved building. The problem was directly connected to the [...] "miracle" [...] that takes place there and the myth that is spread around involving the creation of the small church and is as follows: seventeen large trees and several smaller have grown {{on the roof of the}} building. Their roots are not visible under the few centimeters roof and neither inside or outside the church. The whole building is of course, under pressure due to this large load and there have been several reconstruction interventions during its life. Those non-professional interventions resulted in destroying the architecture of the church. The problem that had to be dealt with according to the trees on the top, was to find out where their roots were directed, without provoking the religious feeling of the church people and the clergymen that were our [...] "sleepless guardians" [...] throughout the entire survey. After an onsite estimation of the situation it was decided that the high-frequency <b>georadar</b> would be used on the walls of the building together with electrical tomography with very small electrodes, so as to have a double check on the methodology. The results of the investigation threw ample light to the mystery and gave the Direction of Restoration of Byzantine and After Byzantine Monuments all the answers they needed to proceed safely to the restoration of the Church of Saint Theodora. It was proved that the roots follow the gaps existing inside the side stonewall creating repulsion stresses between the stones and thus they reach the ground. This leads to the creation of a net of roots that reinforces the building from a static point of view opposing the roof load but also destroying the stonewalls. It was also proved that the south wall is almost intact while there seems to be a particular void in the north wall.|$|E
50|$|Ulpiana was a Roman town, {{established}} in the 1st century AD, receiving municipium status in 169 AD. It was located near a rich mining area and also had a geo-strategic position situated close to the ancient crossroads that linked east with west, were dominant factors for the foundation, development and existence through centuries. During the Roman era, Ulpiana {{was one of the}} most active and frequented centers connecting Constantinople with Rome, and close to the town the crossroad connecting the Adriatic with the Aegean coasts, even indirectly with the Black Sea. Furthermore, the existence of the ancient communication route Via Lissus-Naissus is known, land communication networks that met close to Ulpiana. The earliest forms of the occupation and human activity and civilization, witness the existence since the prehistoric period, but worth mentioning is the period known by the jargon of the archaeologists as the Bronze and Iron Ages. Nevertheless, the first forms of an urban centre recorded in Ulpiana, date to the beginning of the Roman rule, which occurred at the first century AD. With the Romans settled, Ulpiana developed from a small ancient Dardanian concentrated Opidum; to a widespread territory with all attributes of a typical Roman town organization. In regard to this matter, it is believed that Ulpiana was established as a Roman municipium in 169 AD, called Municipium Ulpianum. Nonetheless, Ulpiana achieved its peak of development during the 3rd and 4th century; a period when it became a very important political, economical, cultural center of a wider area of the territory of Dardania, but also became the crucial center for the expansion of the ancient civilization in this region. The Roman town of Ulpiana during this period was ascribed as the Municipum Ulpiana Splendidissima - the Splendid City of Ulpiana, characterized with road networks, orthogonal construction system, water supply, drainage, houses, buildings and various other public, sacral, profane and utilitarian buildings. In addition, the Municipium of Ulpiana was a very important trading centre of either metallurgical, artisans or agricultural goods and merchandise for at least first five centuries of the first millennium and especially during the rule of the Byzantine emperor Justinian the Great in the 6th century AD; time when Ulpiana was rebuilt and renamed to Justiniana Secunda. Since the second part of the 20th century and onward, the ancient town of Ulpiana has been in a continuity study through the loupe and pickaxe of either local or foreign archaeologists that contributed until present day with the discovery of a few cult and sacral monuments, basilica, necropolis, as well as parts of the ramparts with watchtowers, castrum - Roman military garrison and hundreds of movable artifacts, different in form, material and usage, but as well as human remains, architectural structures and elements, all testimony of the cultural material very important for the scientific field of archaeology. The gathered data was partially studied and is under the process of systematic evaluation from various specialists of different scientific disciplines that all together contribute for the further update of the archaeological data. Since our century is the one of technological and scientific innovations, the archaeological site of Ulpiana went through elaborate research studies with highly sophisticated investigative devices, which totally are non intrusive methods of survey examination. Thanking the cooperation, between the German Archaeological Institute, and the Archaeological Institute of Kosovo, have jointly participated in geophysical prospecting with the advance survey/recording methods, for example; Fluxgate Magnetometer, Gradiometer, <b>georadar</b> connected with GIS, surveying around 50 hectares of land with archaeological potential within the Ulpiana area. Besides the scientific character, the underneath earth recording will aid in the future pacifications and development plans for this archaeological site. But even more, the site will benefit also for the management plan for compilation of the development plans for the promotion of the cultural heritage known in the developed countries as archaeotourism, which as a precondition requires the setting of the tourist infrastructure at the archaeological parks. On the other hand, these advanced methods and techniques will help on the determination of the extent, character and nature of Ulpiana, when having in mind that this is a multilayer site.|$|E

Geophysical and sedimentological data were sampled in the Ny-Ålesund area, Brøgger peninsula, W-Spitsbergen, a place dominated by continuous permafrost at the glacier margins. We acquired parallel single-offset <b>georadar</b> lines, multi-offset measurements to deduce the subground velocity, {{and a short}} permafrost core for ground verification. Several stratigraphic properties from the cored frozen sediments are studied; i. e. grain size, ice content, total carbon content, magn. susceptibility, and cation content within the cement ice. The data show that prominent reflections mainly coincide with sediment changes such as in grain size and ice content. A discrete ice layer could be targeted using <b>georadar.</b> Trace modelling has helped to support interpretation of field measurements...|$|E
40|$|Waveform tomographic imaging of {{crosshole}} <b>georadar</b> data is {{a powerful}} method to investigate the shallow subsurface because {{of its ability to}} provide images of pertinent petrophysical parameters with extremely high spatial resolution. All current crosshole <b>georadar</b> waveform inversion strategies are based on the assumption of frequency-independent electromagnetic constitutive parameters. However, in reality, these parameters are known to be frequency-dependent and complex and thus recorded <b>georadar</b> data may show significant dispersive behavior. In this paper, we evaluate synthetically the reconstruction limits of a recently published crosshole <b>georadar</b> waveform inversion scheme in the presence of varying degrees of dielectric dispersion. Our results indicate that, when combined with a source wavelet estimation procedure that provides a means of partially accounting for the frequency-dependent effects through an "effective" wavelet, the inversion algorithm performs remarkably well in weakly to moderately dispersive environments and has the ability to provide adequate tomographic reconstructions...|$|E
40|$|There are {{far-reaching}} conceptual {{similarities between}} bi-static surface <b>georadar</b> and post-stack, "zero-offset" seismic reflection data, which {{is expressed in}} largely identical processing flows. One important difference is, however, that standard deconvolution algorithms routinely used to enhance the vertical resolution of seismic data are notoriously problematic or even detrimental to the overall signal quality when applied to surface <b>georadar</b> data. We have explored various options for alleviating this problem and have tested them on a geologically well-constrained surface <b>georadar</b> dataset. Standard stochastic and direct deterministic deconvolution approaches proved to be largely unsatisfactory. While least-squares-type deterministic deconvolution showed some promise, the inherent uncertainties involved in estimating the source wavelet introduced some artificial "ringiness". In contrast, we found spectral balancing approaches to be effective, practical and robust means for enhancing the vertical resolution of surface <b>georadar</b> data, particularly, but not exclusively, in the uppermost part of the <b>georadar</b> section, which is notoriously plagued by the interference of the direct air- and groundwaves. For the data considered in this study, {{it can be argued}} that band-limited spectral blueing may provide somewhat better results than standard band-limited spectral whitening, particularly in the uppermost part of the section affected by the interference of the air- and groundwaves. Interestingly, this finding is consistent with the fact that the amplitude spectrum resulting from least-squares-type deterministic deconvolution is characterized by a systematic enhancement of higher frequencies at the expense of lower frequencies and hence is blue rather than white. It is also consistent with increasing evidence that spectral "blueness" is a seemingly universal, albeit enigmatic, property of the distribution of reflection coefficients in the Earth. Our results therefore indicate that spectral balancing techniques in general and spectral blueing in particular represent simple, yet effective means of enhancing the vertical resolution of surface <b>georadar</b> data and, in many cases, could turn out to be a preferable alternative to standard deconvolution approaches...|$|E
40|$|Seismic {{tomography}} and ground-penetrating radar (GPR) {{were combined}} to determine weakness zones {{and the degree}} of alteration in rock making up the Moai statues of Easter Island. The surveys were carried out on stratified argillaceous tuff that had been subjected to weathering for long periods. The argillaceous nature and unsaturated condition of the rock creates ambiguity in both the seismic and <b>georadar</b> data interpretation, but this ambiguity is removed by using a combined interpretation of the data. Interpretation of the combined data shows that the high seismic velocities of the inner zones of the statues must be related to water content and not to better rock quality, because of the high attenuation of the <b>georadar</b> signal in those zones. The weathered zone is characterized by a high signal-to-noise ratio of <b>georadar</b> data and low P-wave seismic velocities. Comparing the seismic and GPR data sets, we found that the seismic velocity and the signal attenuation of the <b>georadar</b> section differ for two statues in accordance with the degree of alteration of the rock. We show that the combined interpretation of seismic and <b>georadar</b> data allows the removal of the ambiguities in the interpretation of the seismic velocity in the massive tuff, the definition of the thickness of the weathered layer and the linking of seismic velocity to the degree of Moai preservation, which is useful for a classification of Moai health. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|E

40|$|To {{understand}} {{processes and}} dynamics {{linked to the}} volumetric water content of soils thorough knowledge of the water distribution inside soils is required. The applicability of the <b>georadar</b> technique for small scale soil heterogeneity mapping and monitoring is investigated using four different methods. Since the uppermost meter of the soil lacks a sufficient amount of spacious reflectors no standard <b>georadar</b> methods can supply adequate coverage of the investigated area under field conditions. Therefore four methods were evaluated to present an assortment {{of the most promising}} methods for different case specific problems. Owing to the averaging nature of the <b>georadar</b> technique the introduced methods needed to be adapted to small scale investigations. Based on numerical simulations and concise measurements new processing procedures are applied to achieve the required spatial resolution of less than 0. 3 m. All four methods were successfully applied during realistic field measurement conditions. The transmission method is applied to a soil column experiment filled with undisturbed natural soil. In the course of an irrigation experiment the infiltration of the water front as well as the water dynamics afterwards were reproduced.

40|$|Ground-probing {{radar systems}} {{featuring}} medium-frequency carrier signals phase-modulated by binary pseudonoise codes have been proposed. These systems {{would be used}} to locate and detect movements of subterranean surfaces; the primary intended application is in warning of the movement of underground water toward oil-well intake ports in time to shut down those ports to avoid pumping of water. Other potential applications include oil-well logging and monitoring of underground reservoirs. A typical prior <b>georadar</b> system operates at a carrier frequency of at least 50 MHz in order to provide useable range resolution. This frequency is too high for adequate penetration of many underground layers of interest. On the other hand, if the carrier frequency were to be reduced greatly to increase penetration, then bandwidth and thus range resolution would also have to be reduced, thereby rendering the system less useful.

40|$|Waveform-based tomographic imaging of {{crosshole}} <b>georadar</b> data is {{a powerful}} method to investigate the shallow subsurface because {{of its ability to}} provide images of electrical properties in near-surface environments with unprecedented spatial resolution. A critical issue with waveform inversion is the a priori unknown source signal. Indeed, the estimation of the source pulse is notoriously difficult but essential for the effective application of this method. Here, we explore the viability and robustness of a recently proposed deconvolution-based procedure to estimate the source pulse during waveform inversion of crosshole <b>georadar</b> data, where changes in wavelet shape with location as a result of varying near-field conditions and differences in antenna coupling may be significant. Specifically, we examine whether a single, average estimated source current function can adequately represent the pulses radiated at all transmitter locations during a crosshole <b>georadar</b> survey, or whether a separate source wavelet estimation should be performed for each transmitter gather. Tests with synthetic and field data indicate that remarkably good tomographic reconstructions can be obtained using a single estimated source pulse when moderate to strong variability exists in the true source signal with antenna location. Only in the case of very strong variability in the true source pulse are tomographic reconstructions clearly improved by estimating a different source wavelet for each transmitter location...|$|E

The study area, located in central Italy, consists of Roman, medieval and modern ruins that are included in reworked sediments. The geology is formed by inhomogeneous alluvial sediments (sand and gravel) several meters thick with diamagnetic character. To reduce the ambiguity in the subsurface reconstruction, a joint interpretation of <b>georadar,</b> magnetic and electrical tomography data was performed. The <b>georadar</b> was chosen to reconstruct detailed subsurface features, the electrical tomography to distinguish resistive bodies (stones, voids, etc.) from conductive (cavities filled by clay) and, because of the diamagnetic character of in situ sediments, the magnetic method was chosen to detect the earthenware ruins. The geophysical data were controlled by excavation, which detected silos of 1 m in diameter and a concrete layer at a few centimeters from the topographic surface. Time slices in the <b>georadar</b> data allowed us to detect the silos and to define the lateral edge of the concrete layer. Silos were also indirectly detected by the magnetic data because of the earthenware present in the filling sediments.

40|$|We have {{performed}} extensive <b>georadar</b> surveys for mapping the snow depth {{in the basin}} of Breuil-Cervinia (Aosta Valley) in the Italian Alps, close to the Matterhorn. More than 9 km of <b>georadar</b> profiles were acquired in April 2008 and 15 km in April 2009, distributed on an hydrological basin of about 12 km 2. Radar surveys were carried out partially on the iced area of Ventina glacier at elevation higher than 3000 m a. s. l. and partially at lower elevation (2500 m- 3000 m) on the gently slopes of the basin where the winter snow accumulated directly on the ground surface. The snow distribution on the basin, {{at the end of}} the season, could vary significantly according to the elevation range, exposition and ground morphology. In small catchment the snow depth reached 6 - 7 m. At higher elevation, on the glacier, a more homogeneous distribution is usually observed. A descriptive statistical analysis of the dataset is discussed to demonstrate the high spatial variability of the snow depth distribution in the area. The probability distribution of the snow depth fits the gamma distribution with a good correlation. Instead we didn't found any satisfactory relationship of the snow depth with the main morphological parameters of the terrain (elevation, slope, curvature).

Forest fragments at different stages of regeneration, and pasture and agriculture (perennial and annual) areas were selected for study. Soil characterization was performed through measurements of soil resistance to penetration (SRP) with an impact penetrometer, and the soil properties with a ground penetrating radar (<b>georadar).</b> SRP increased in the forest areas at initial, medium and advanced stages from 2. 0 to 2. 5, 2. 0 to 3. 0 and 2. 5 to 6. 0 MPa, respectively. In the perennial and annual agriculture areas, the increase in SRP was due to differences in their mineral composition, and the lowest values found in the annual agriculture area were due to fauna activity. The employment of GPR generated information in a more rapid manner than with the use of impact penetrometer...|$|E
