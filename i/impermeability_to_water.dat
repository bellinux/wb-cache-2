40|$|AbstractThe mechanosensitive {{channel of}} large {{conductance}} (MscL) in prokaryotes plays {{a crucial role}} in exocytosis {{as well as in the}} response to osmotic downshock. The channel can be gated by tension in the membrane bilayer. The determination of functionally important residues in MscL, patch-clamp studies of pressure-conductance relationships, and the recently elucidated crystal structure of MscL from Mycobacterium tuberculosis have guided the search for the mechanism of MscL gating. Here, we present a molecular dynamics study of the MscL protein embedded in a fully hydrated POPC bilayer. Simulations totaling 3 ns in length were carried out under conditions of constant temperature and pressure using periodic boundary conditions and full electrostatics. The protein remained in the closed state corresponding to the crystal structure, as evidenced by its <b>impermeability</b> <b>to</b> <b>water.</b> Analysis of equilibrium fluctuations showed that the protein was least mobile in the narrowest part of the channel.

40|$|Within the {{lifetime}} of most reverse osmosis (RO) systems some fouling will adversely affect membrane performance. The major constituents of foulants found on the first position during six years of membrane autopsy at the Genesys Membrane laboratory are clay minerals chemically known as aluminosilicates. Clay is a naturally occurring material found in all RO feed waters composed primarily of different fine-grained minerals, which exhibit a degree of plasticity (deformation under pressure) depending {{on the amount of}} water held by polar attraction in the mineral crystalline structure. Clay deposits are difficult to remove with traditional specialty and commodity cleaning chemicals. This is due to the characteristic of plasticity, the presence of different structural cations and also the <b>impermeability</b> of clay <b>to</b> <b>water.</b> Clay deposits fouling the membrane rapidly reduce flux rates. In order <b>to</b> maintain product <b>water</b> output operators invariably increase feed pressure which compacts the deposit making it less porous and harder to penetrate with traditional cleaning chemicals. Ineffective deposit removal leads to more frequent cleaning and enhanced potential for membrane damage. Clay mineral fouling of membranes therefore requires immediate removal through effective cleaning. This paper explores the chemistry of clay and the mechanisms involved in membrane fouling. The process of developing and testing a new cleaning product Genesol 703 which removes clay deposits from RO/NF/UF systems is described. Comparative results with conventional cleaning products and commodity chemicals are presented. Product efficacy was determined by comparison of membrane flux rates before and after cleaning. The results demonstrate that Genesol 703 is a technically and economically viable cleaning chemical product for the removal of clay deposits from membranes...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to identify the most efficient method for overcoming coat-imposed dormancy and determine the optimal germination temperature for Ornithopus pinnatus seeds. Treatments to overcome dormancy were: intact seeds; immersion in hot water at 60 ºC, followed by soaking in the same water (unheated) / 24 h; immersion in hot water at 90 ºC, followed by soaking in the same water (unheated) / 24 h; mechanical scarification; chemical scarification, H 2 SO 4 / 5 min; and chemical scarification, H 2 SO 4 / 10 min. Percentages were calculated for germinated, abnormal, dormant, and dead seeds. Optimal germination temperatures were calculated using eight constant temperatures (0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, and 35 °C), with 8 h of light and 16 h of darkness. Germination rate, frequency, and synchronization index of germination were used as parameters to establish optimum temperature for germination. A completely randomized experimental design was used, with twelve repetitions of 100 seeds per treatment. Data obtained were subjected to analysis of variance and Tukey's test at a 5 % significance level. O. pinnatus seeds exhibit dormancy caused by the seed coat's <b>impermeability</b> <b>to</b> <b>water.</b> Mechanical scarification was efficient in promoting seed germination. The species is stenothermal, meaning it cannot tolerate significant temperature variations. The germination rate of seeds was linearly dependent on temperature.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{accelerated}} aging {{on the structure}} and properties of single, metalized, and multilayer films used in food packaging was studied through the exposure of specimens of those films to repeated aging cycles in a weather meter under the combined action of ultraviolet, humidity, and heat. The aged specimens were tested for their mechanical properties and water vapor transmission characteristics, {{and the results were}} compared to those obtained from the original specimens. The property changes introduced into the films by aging were further explored by attenuated total reflectance spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry in an attempt to correlate the changes in the properties with structural characteristics. The results showed that the films made of polypropylene (PP) underwent severe chain scission upon irradiation and lost mechanical properties but still retained their <b>impermeability</b> <b>to</b> <b>water</b> vapor. The metallic coating could not prevent PP from degrading, as it seemed to oxidize under the aging conditions. Therefore, the metalized film showed the same mechanical response as PP, but its water impermeability dropped dramatically. Polyethylene (PE) and poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) films showed modest decreases in their mechanical properties, which could be attributed to crosslinking reactions taking place with PE and to the increased ultraviolet stability of PET, respectively. On the other hand, the multilayer films presented a decrease in their mechanical properties according to those of their weak component, which would be expected for a composite structure.

50|$|The {{diffusion}} of water through a selectively permeable membrane is called osmosis.This allows only certain particles {{to go through}} including water and leaving behind the solutes including salt and other contaminants. In the process of reverse osmosis, thin film composite membranes (TFC or TFM) are used.

In essence, a TFC material is a molecular sieve constructed {{in the form of}} a film from two or more layered materials.

40|$|After {{the relief}} of 24 hr of {{complete}} unilateral ureteral obstruction in the dog, the experimental kidney {{is characterized by a}} decrease in filtration rate and an increase in fractional and often absolute excretion of sodium before and after the administration of mannitol. In the hydrated state, the failure to conserve sodium is associated with increases in fractional free water clearance and fractional sodium supply to water-freeing sites signifying that the augmented sodium excretion is derived from a proximal source. In the hydropenic state there is decreased fractional free water reabsorption, and sometimes free water excretion, in the postobstructive kidney. An early plateau in free water reabsorption is associated with an increased fractional excretion of sodium. These findings are attributed to the early development of distal nephron <b>impermeability</b> <b>to</b> <b>water</b> as a result of enhanced distal tubular supply and transport of sodium. There is a decrease in maximal tubular reabsorptive capacity (Tm) of glucose in the post-obstructive kidney which is, however, less marked than the decrease in filtration rate. The fall in filtration rate is to some extent likely due to a dropping out of nephrons from the circulation while the remaining nephrons are hypoperfused. The magnitude of the sodium reabsorptive defect is markedly exaggerated as the concentration of nonreabsorbable solute (mannitol) in the glomerular perfusate is increased. It is concluded that the postobstructive increase in sodium excretion during mannitol administration is in part due to a limit in the capacity to reabsorb sodium against a concentration gradient in the proximal tubule...|$|E

40|$|Seeds of Bixa orellana (L.) have a sclerified {{palisade}} cell layer, which {{constitutes a}} natural barrier to water uptake. In fact, newly fully developed B. orellana seeds are highly {{impermeable to water}} and thereby dormant. The purpose of this work is to investigate, from a developmental point of view, the histochemical and physical changes in the cell walls of the seed coat {{that are associated with}} the water impermeability. Seed coat samples were analyzed by histochemical and polarization microscopy techniques, as well as by fractionation/HPAEC-PAD. For histochemical analysis the tissue samples were fixed, dehydrated, embedded in paraffin and the slides were dewaxed and tested with appropriate stains for different cell wall components. Throughout the development of B. orellana seeds, there was a gradual thickening of the seed coat at the palisade region. This thickening was due to the deposition of cellulose and hemicelluloses in the palisade layer cell walls, which resulted in a highly water impermeable seed coat. The carbohydrate composition of the cell walls changed dramatically at the late developmental stages due to the intense deposition of hemicelluloses. Hemicelluloses were mainly deposited in the outer region of the palisade layer cell walls and altered the birefringent pattern of the walls. Xylans were by far the most abundant hemicellulosic component of the cell walls.

Mechanical scarification, dry heat, boiling water, sulphuric acid, soaking in dis-tilled water and soaking in gibberellic acid solution were used as presowing treatments applied for enhancing germination. The untreated seeds showed a deep dormancy at all temperature regimes assayed (final germination percentages ranged from 23 to 28 %).

40|$|The {{response}} of trained, conscious dogs to an acute water load was studied before adrenalectomy and under five conditions of hormonal replacement and sodium intake after adrenalectomy. Before adrenalectomy, {{with the dogs}} drinking isotonic saline, the minimal urinary osmolality (Uosm) was 47 ± 7 (SEM) mOsm and free-water clearance (CH 2 O) was 8. 6 ± 1 ml/min. These values were not different after adrenalectomy with or without deoxycorticosterone (DOCA) if the animals continued to drink saline and receive dexamethasone. Moreover, after adrenalectomy {{in the presence of}} saline drinking both dexamethasone and DOCA could be withdrawn for up to 4 days without impairment of diluting ability (Uosm, 54 ± 7 mOsm and CH 2 O, 7. 3 ± 1 ml/min). In contrast, when the dogs drank tap water (Na intake 30 mEq/day), water loading in the absence of dexamethasone and DOCA was associated with a significantly higher Uosm (127 ± 28 mOsm) and lower CH 2 O (2. 7 ± 0. 3 ml/min). Replacing DOCA alone in the presence of this limited Na intake returned diluting ability to normal (Uosm 31 ± 7 mOsm, CH 2 O 7. 7 ± 0. 5 ml/min). Glomerular filtration rate for each animal was the same under each condition except for a significant diminution which occurred when dexamethasone and DOCA were withdrawn while the animals were on a 30 mEq sodium intake. In contrast to previous conclusions, the present results indicate that in the absence of adrenal hormones normal renal diluting ability may occur, indicating both maximal suppression of vasopressin release and maximal distal tubular <b>impermeability</b> <b>to</b> <b>water.</b> In the present study the diluting defect observed after adrenalectomy related to negative sodium balance and could be overcome by either replacement with DOCA or a high intake of sodium alone...|$|E
40|$|The Paper {{describes}} the testing and selection of metallic and non-metallic materials of application in pressure testing apparatus {{to determine the}} life term of HAN-based liquid propellants (LPs). Metallic materials are necessary for pressure sensors and non-metallic materials for sealing of the testing apparatus. Selection criteria for the metals are their corrosion-resisting quality and their capacity to influence or restrict the chemical stability of the LP. Selection criteria for the sealing materials are their <b>impermeability</b> <b>to</b> gases, deformation under strain and compatibility with the LP used. The testing apparatus is being used at the present time...|$|R
40|$|The gene {{encoding}} the epsilon subunit (atpE) of the chloroplast ATP synthase of Spinacia oleracea {{has been}} overexpressed in Escherichia coli. The recombinant protein can be solubilized in 8 M urea and directly diluted into buffer containing ethanol and glycerol to obtain epsilon {{that is as}} biologically active as epsilon purified from chloroplast-coupling factor 1 (CF 1). Recombinant epsilon folded in this manner inhibits the ATPase activity of soluble and membrane-bound CF 1 deficient in epsilon and restores proton <b>impermeability</b> <b>to</b> thylakoid membranes reconstituted with CF 1 deficient in epsilon. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to generate truncations and single amino acid substitutions in the primary structure of epsilon. In the five mutants tested, alterations that weaken ATPase inhibition by recombinant epsilon affect its ability <b>to</b> restore proton <b>impermeability</b> <b>to</b> a similar extent, with one exception. Substitution of histidine- 37 with arginine appears to uncouple ATPase inhibition and the restoration of proton impermeability. As {{in the case of}} E. coli, it appears that N-terminal truncations of the epsilon subunit have more profound effects than C-terminal deletions on the function of epsilon. Recombinant epsilon with six amino acids deleted from the C terminus, which is the only region of significant mismatch between the epsilon of spinach and the epsilon of Pisum sativum, inhibits ATPase activity with a reduced potency similar to that of purified pea epsilon. Four of the six amino acids are serine or threonine. These hydroxylated amino acids may be important in epsilon-CF 1 interactions...|$|R
40|$|The surface {{properties}} of polymyxin B-resistant Proteus mirabilis are markedly altered by the antibiotic. The effects include {{the development of}} susceptibility to surface-active agents such as deoxycholate or tris(hydroxymethyl) aminomethane and a marked increased osmotic fragility. However, cell wall <b>impermeability</b> <b>to</b> various agents such as erythromycin, actinomycin D, bacitracin, lysozyme, and triphenyltetrazolium chloride apparently remains intact. These results support the concept that {{the actions of the}} polymyxins on gram-negative bacteria are multiple; the action(s) of the antibiotic responsible for lethality in vitro, presumably {{at the level of the}} cytoplasmic membrane, may represent only a portion of the potential therapeutic effects of the antibiotic in vivo...|$|R
