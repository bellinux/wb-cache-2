40|$|AbstractThis paper {{attempts}} {{to examine and}} analyse accident causation and risk factors for pedestrian injuries at signalized locations in Warsaw. In large Polish cities like Warsaw, pedestrians constitute almost 60 % of road fatalities. Although traffic safety situation in general is improving, the numbers of pedestrians hit when crossing a road have not significantly decreased {{in the last five}} years. Accidents at signalized intersections and crossings in Warsaw constitute around 33 % of all crashes involving pedestrians. During the last five years the number of accidents occurring at signalized pedestrian crossings has not been decreasing. Based on analysis of 735 police records of pedestrian accidents in Warsaw for years 2010 - 2014, it can be concluded that in terms of numbers the biggest problem occurs on dual carriageway roads and at zebra crossings on <b>intersection</b> <b>exit</b> roadways. The highest risk of a fatal accident outcome occurs at midblock signalized crossings and when pedestrians cross tram tracks. Pedestrians over 65 years of age have the highest risk of being killed. Disobeying the red signal is a serious problem – many accidents were caused by either a pedestrian (25 %) or driver (8 %) ignoring the red light. The findings suggest that accident rates could be minimized by appropriate road and traffic signal design: speed reduction measures and enforcement as well as making traffic signals more pedestrian-friendly, especially for elderly pedestrians...|$|E
50|$|The {{northern}} {{segment of}} NY 878 is a limited-access highway; the southern segment is a surface road with at-grade <b>intersections.</b> <b>Exit</b> numbers on NY 878's northern segment are only signed eastbound.|$|R
50|$|There are entrance/exits at both 14th Street and 16th Street, with fare {{controls}} at both ends. The 14th Street {{entrance is}} {{shared with the}} PATH station of the same name, which has a separate fare control. At both <b>intersections,</b> <b>exits</b> lead to all four corners.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the second}} phase, each {{intersection}} is marked as either an entry <b>intersection</b> or an <b>exit</b> <b>intersection.</b> This {{is accomplished by}} evaluating the even-odd rule at the first vertex and then traversing the polygon and marking the intersections with alternating flags (the next intersection after an entry intersection must be an <b>exit</b> <b>intersection).</b>|$|R

50|$|Old North Carolina Highway 86, (sometimes {{referred}} to as Old 86), is a highway that parallels North Carolina Highway 86. Heading from NC 54 near Carrboro, it follows northwest to Homestead/Dairyland Road near the unincorporated community of Calvander, North Carolina, it heads north paralleling Interstate 40 until the <b>intersection</b> at <b>exit</b> 261. Then intersecting Interstate 85, at exit 164, it ends at the intersection with U.S. Route 70 Business, and North Carolina Highway 86.

David Rigler vividly remembered an occasion when he and Genie passed {{a father and a}} young boy carrying a toy firetruck without speaking to each other, and said the boy suddenly turned around and gave the firetruck to Genie. Curtiss also recalled one time when, while she and Genie were walking and had stopped at a busy intersection, she unexpectedly heard a purse emptying; she turned to see a woman stop at the <b>intersection</b> and <b>exit</b> her car to give Genie a plastic purse, even though Genie had not said anything. To take full advantage of her nonverbal communication abilities, in 1974 the Riglers arranged for her to learn a form of sign language.|$|R
50|$|The {{beginning}} was constructed between 1962 and 1965 from Bemböle to Länsisalmi and the continuation to Jorvas {{was completed in}} 1968. Originally, each road was two lanes wide.

5|$|At this crossing, US 22 heads {{north-northeast}} into Scotch Plains, Union County, {{coming to}} an interchange with CR 655. The route continues northeast as a four- to five-lane highway, passing near Bowcraft Amusement Park. The road continues east through Mountainside, turning northeast before entering Springfield, where it has an interchange with CR 509 Spur (signed as CR 577). Past this interchange, for 1.8 miles US 22 has an unusual wide median that contains commercial businesses and numerous U-turn ramps. In this area, the road comes to a level crossing with the abandoned Rahway Valley Railroad. It crosses the Rahway River into Union, where the wide median continues. The route briefly forms the northern border of Kenilworth before the median narrows back into a Jersey barrier. US 22 splits into two carriageways at the <b>intersection</b> with <b>exits</b> 140 and 140A of the Garden State Parkway and Route 82, site of the Union Watersphere.|$|R
50|$|ILL 35 {{begins at}} a four-way urban {{intersection}} in East Dubuque. US 20 passes overhead and {{connects to the}} <b>intersection</b> via an <b>exit</b> ramp. From here, ILL 35 heads northeast out of East Dubuque on a curving route. Within East Dubuque, ILL 35 is locally known as Wisconsin Avenue. Once it leaves East Dubuque, ILL 35 becomes a primarily rural road, which it remains {{for the rest of}} its route. The highway passes County Route 5W shortly before becoming WIS 35 at the Wisconsin state line. ILL 35 is an undivided two-lane road for its entire length.|$|R
40|$|Contrary to {{traditional}} reactive perspective based on traffic accident occurrence, evaluation using surrogate safety measures is preferred in a proactive safety approach. Traffic conflicts {{have been one}} of such indicators; to enable their use in Czech practice, Czech traffic conflict technique and guidelines were developed. The paper presents the study requested by road agency with objective of proving the feasibility of the guidelines. The case study assessed the risk at a newly-built rural <b>intersection</b> on motorway <b>exit</b> ramp before and after a change of road marking.

5|$|M-82 {{begins at}} a {{junction}} with M-120 and B-96 west of Fremont. This junction is at a tripoint of county lines. M-120 forms the north–south Newaygo–Oceana and Newaygo–Muskegon county lines. B-96, which forms the east–west Oceana–Muskegon county line runs due {{west of the}} <b>intersection.</b> M-82 <b>exits</b> the <b>intersection</b> to the east. The highway runs along 48th Street through rural farms into the community of Fremont. The road, now called Main Street, passes through the downtown area and M-82 turns south along Stewart Avenue out of town. The highway rounds a curve and transitions to 72nd Street running eastward through more farm land. As the trunkline approaches Newaygo, the terrain becomes more wooded near the Muskegon River. M-82 follows Fremont Street east to a junction with M-37. The two highways merge and run concurrently over the river and into downtown on State Street. South of downtown, M-82 turns east again, independent of M-37, and runs along 82nd Street on {{the southern edge of}} the Manistee National Forest. The east end of M-82 is at exit118 on US131/M-46 west of Howard City.|$|R
50|$|Once {{it enters}} Spring Valley (where {{it is known}} locally first as South Main Street, then as North Main Street after it crosses its very busy {{intersection}} with NY 59), NY 45 continues northward through the downtown business district. Traffic here tends to pile up many times a day. After NY 45's intersection at Hillcrest with CR 74 (the location of several small shopping centers), traffic tends to ease up. North of there, NY 45 provides {{a link to the}} Hassidic Jewish community of New Square, although it never enters the village limits. At CR 80, NY 45 enters New Hempstead. Again the road becomes relatively quiet, but it begins to parallel the Palisades Interstate Parkway, until its <b>intersection</b> at <b>exit</b> 12 in Pomona. NY 45 quickly leaves Pomona and enters Mount Ivy. This is where NY 45 comes to its northern terminus at US 202. This area of US 202 is in downtown Mount Ivy, and exit 13 of the Palisades is just 0.1 mi west of NY 45's northern terminus.|$|R

In the same direction of traffic driving direction, they are mainly settled in the median strip, edge lines, and dangerous sections of the road.|$|R
