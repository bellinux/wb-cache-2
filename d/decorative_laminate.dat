50|$|Wilsonart founder Ralph Wilson {{moved to}} Texas to retire after {{suffering}} {{a heart attack in}} the early 1950s. Instead, he was encouraged by American Desk owner Arthur P. Brashear, Sr., to open a laminate company next door to American Desk’s school desk factory in Temple, Texas. He did, forming Ralph Wilson Plastics Company (RWP), later Wilsonart International, in 1956. At the time there were 16 competitors in the <b>decorative</b> <b>laminate</b> industry, including Formica, which held 65% of the market. RWP became a publicly held corporation in 1964 with an initial offering of 290,000 shares at $15. In 1960, Dr. Ralph Wilson, Jr. left his dental practice in Los Angeles and moved to Temple to join RWP as Executive Vice President. Upon the death of his father, he became President of RWP, and served {{on the board of directors}} of Dart until its merger with Kraft Inc. in 1986. When Premark International was created as a spinoff of Dart and Kraft, he was named group vice-president of the company, and president of the decorative products group. He retired in 1989.|$|E
40|$|Mokume gane {{is a high}} value, <b>decorative</b> <b>laminate</b> {{material}} used in the jewellery industry. Production of mokume gane {{is difficult}} and expensive at both small scale and industrial levels. This research investigates a novel method for producing a mixed metal layered material, similar to mokume gane, using friction stir processing (FSP). By adapting FSP it has been possible to successfully bond many layers of dissimilar metals such as silver, copper and brass, while simultaneously producing unique patterns in the metal. This approach minimizes processing, reduces waste and potentially lowers costs. The technique avoids {{many of the problems}} experienced in standard mokume gane production, such as melting or lack of bonding. It is possible to manufacture both small customized ingots, and to mass produce large sheets up to several square meters in size. This project is a collaboration between SHU and Rotary Engineering UK funded by TSB and Innovate UK. </p...|$|E

40|$|The {{title of}} the work, Formica, speaks both to the work’s insect motif – formica is Latin for ant - {{but also to the}} 2 -dimensional nature of the {{projection}} screen – Formica is also a kind of <b>decorative</b> <b>laminate</b> surface. This is Grennan’s second video installation work commissioned specifically for the Kingston Art Centre’s Bridge Space. Following on from the first project - which transformed a dilapidated 3 rd story pedestrian corridor into a virtual swimming pool - this work continues to explore the residual meanings of the corridor as a liminal, in-between, or non-space. The new work seeks to again reply aesthetically and poetically to the site’s external setting dominated as it is by the heavy commuter traffic along the Nepean Highway. Scale is central to the work. In Formica, Grennan constructs a scaled-down Perspex replica of the walk-bridge, {{and with the help of}} Patrick Honan and Museum Victoria (where Patrick, an entomologist, is head of live exhibits), he populates the corridor with live Bull Ants. The work records these colossal ants as they negotiate the non-space of the corridor and fulfil their metaphorical roles as standardised commuters. With nowhere to go, however, the ants subvert this assigned role and exhibit far more nuanced and individuated behaviour as they investigate, probe, prevaricate, dawdle, or preen idly as though performing some insectile version of Waiting for Godot...|$|E
40|$|Melamine {{formaldehyde}} (MF) resins {{are widely}} used for the gluing and surface coating of wood-based consumer products in the interior design of living environments. MF resins are especially relevant in <b>decorative</b> <b>laminate</b> applications because of their good performance-to-price ratio. In their industrial processing, an important intermediate state is the liquid MF prepolymer that is used for decorative paper impregnation. Here, the drying of impregnated papers is investigated with respect to premature curing. A new method to quantify water release upon drying that allows estimation {{of the degree of}} undesired precuring is described. Since curing proceeds via polycondensation, crosslinking brings about the release of water molecules. By thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), drying was studied in terms of water release due to physical drying (elimination of “dilution water”) and chemical crosslinking of the prepolymer to a three-dimensional MF network (elimination of chemically liberated water). The results obtained by TGA/IR spectroscopic analysis of the liberated volatiles show that the emission of water from b-stage MF can be clearly analytically separated into a physical (evaporation of dilution water) and a chemical (liberation via condensation) sequence. TGA experiments were correlated with curing experiments performed with differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) to estimate the residual crosslinking capacities of the impregnated papers. The drying conditions used during the preparation of impregnated decorative papers seemed to significantly affect their remaining reactivity only when harsh drying conditions were used. Upon heat exposure for prolonged time, precuring of the oligomer units results in a shift of the temperature maxima in TGA...|$|E
