25|$|As Andrew Carnegie was funding {{libraries}} elsewhere {{across the}} United States, a committee {{was formed to}} petition Carnegie for funds to build a public library in Augusta despite the mayor and city council not supporting his involvement. Carnegie agreed to donate $50,000 to fund {{the building of a}} library on the condition the city council pay its upkeep costs of $5,000 per year for maintenance. The city, unwilling to take the financial incentive of running a library for this price per year declined Carnegie's offer leading to a <b>great</b> <b>divide</b> in the city regarding the support or not of a public library. By 1905 public sentiment about a free library was mixed as there was no clear indication whether or not a free library would be brought to the region. Public interest in the library subsequently lessened and funding became a bigger issue than before, forcing the library to close in 1906.|$|E
25|$|After {{remaining}} inactive {{for over}} a year, it was announced in June 2004 that Creed had disbanded. Tremonti cited tensions between Stapp {{and the rest of}} the band as the reasoning. He said that the relationship with Stapp had become so strained that the creative juices were no longer flowing. The reality was that Stapp was in Maui battling his addiction to alcohol and drugs. Almost simultaneous with the announcement of Creed's break-up, Stapp opted for a solo career. On November 22, 2004, Wind-up Records released Creed's Greatest Hits, after which Stapp released his debut solo album The <b>Great</b> <b>Divide</b> in 2005 with Roadrunner Records recording artist Goneblind. Meanwhile, Tremonti and Phillips had reunited with Marshall to form a new band, called Alter Bridge with singer Myles Kennedy, formerly of The Mayfield Four and the current frontman of Slash's latest project. Alter Bridge, who continues to tour and record today, has released five studio albums: One Day Remains (2004), Blackbird (2007), AB III (2010), Fortress (2013) and The Last Hero (2016).|$|E
