5|$|In {{the fifth}} and final case, Phoenix is visiting a {{mountain}} retreat with Maya and Pearl when a fellow guest, Elise Deauxnim, is murdered. While looking for Maya, he falls into a river and becomes ill, forcing Edgeworth and Franziska to temporarily fill in as attorney and prosecutor to keep his client, a nun named Iris, from being found guilty. When Phoenix returns, he explains that Elise is really Maya's long-lost mother, Misty Fey, and that her death {{was the result of}} a plan engineered by her sister Morgan to kill Maya with the help of the now deceased Dahlia, who turns out to be Iris's twin. Through cross-examination, Phoenix reveals that not only is Dahlia impersonating Iris, she is using Maya's body to do so. With Mia's help, Dahlia is exorcised from Maya and Iris is declared innocent. Godot is revealed as the one responsible for killing Misty to protect Maya, leading to the discovery of his true identity: Diego Armando. Having spent many years blaming Phoenix for Mia's death, he sought revenge, but concedes that Phoenix <b>has</b> <b>done</b> <b>more</b> to continue her legacy than him. Iris also reveals that she posed as Dahlia while Phoenix was attending college to protect him, ended up falling in love with him, and that she regrets her failure to stop her sister from becoming a criminal. Reuniting with his friends, Phoenix celebrates finally being free of his past.|$|E

500|$|The Chinese press {{had long}} given Wong's career very mixed reviews, and {{were less than}} {{favorable}} to her performance in Shanghai Express. A Chinese newspaper ran the headline: [...] "Paramount Utilizes Anna May Wong to Produce Picture to Disgrace China" [...] and continued, [...] "Although she is deficient in artistic portrayal, she <b>has</b> <b>done</b> <b>more</b> than enough to disgrace the Chinese race." [...] Critics in China believed that Wong's on-screen sexuality spread negative stereotypes of Chinese women. The most virulent criticism came from the Nationalist government, but China's intellectuals and liberals were not always so opposed to Wong, as demonstrated when Peking University awarded the actress an honorary doctorate in 1932.

[...] Laucke summarized: [...] "The Spanish guitar remains my first love. The flamenco guitar is my passion." [...] According to The Music Scene magazine published by Society of Composers, Authors and Music Publishers of Canada (SOCAN), he is one of [...] "five of Canada's best-known soloists" [...] and the Canadian federal and provincial governments gave him [...] "full recognition as the person who <b>has</b> <b>done</b> <b>more</b> for the guitar in this country than anyone else".|$|E

[...] Morris Dees of the Southern Poverty Law Center cites Atticus Finch as the reason he became a lawyer, and Richard Matsch, the federal judge who presided over the Timothy McVeigh trial, counts Atticus as a major judicial influence. One law professor at the University of Notre Dame stated that the most influential textbook he taught from was To Kill a Mockingbird, and an article in the Michigan Law Review claims, [...] "No real-life lawyer <b>has</b> <b>done</b> <b>more</b> for the self-image or public perception of the legal profession," [...] before questioning whether [...] "Atticus Finch is a paragon of honor or an especially slick hired gun".|$|E

500|$|Several reviewers such as Justin Chang and Mark Kermode {{emphasized}} Scorsese's {{collaboration with}} his production crew {{and with his}} actors as contributing to the film's quality. Writing for the Los Angeles Times, Justin Chang called the film an [...] "anguished masterwork" [...] for Scorsese stating: [...] "Working with such sterling past collaborators as editor Thelma Schoonmaker, production designer Dante Ferretti and cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto, Scorsese <b>has</b> <b>done</b> <b>more</b> than resurrect a vision of feudal Japan... Silencefeels less like a feat of adaptation than an act of artistic submission". Mark Kermode writing for The Guardian indicated exemplary performances by the range of Japanese supporting actors in the cast stating: [...] "The real stars however, are the Japanese cast, from Yōsuke Kubozuka’s enigmatic wretch, Kichijiro... to Yoshi Oida’s devout elder Ichizo, to whose village these priests bring both salvation and suffering. As a smiling, silver-tongued interpreter, Tadanobu Asano is a superb foil to the inquisitor, Inoue, played with fly-swatting menace by a wheedling Issey Ogata".|$|E
500|$|According to Taraborrelli, the {{defining}} moment of Madonna's childhood was the tragic and untimely {{death of her}} beloved mother. Psychiatrist Keith Ablow suggests her mother's death would have had an immeasurable impact on the young Madonna {{at a time when}} her personality was still forming. According to Ablow, the younger a child is at the time of a serious loss, the more profound the influence and the longer lasting the impact. He concludes that [...] "some people never reconcile themselves to such a loss at an early age, Madonna is not different than them." [...] Conversely, author Lucy O'Brien feels the impact of the rape she suffered is, in fact, the motivating factor behind everything Madonna <b>has</b> <b>done,</b> <b>more</b> important even than the death of her mother: [...] "It's not so much grief at her mother's death that drives her, as the sense of abandonment that left her unprotected. She encountered her own worst possible scenario, becoming a victim of male violence, and thereafter turned that full-tilt into her work, reversing the equation at every opportunity." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the opinion}} of the jury of the Académie du Disque Français, [...] "Sir Thomas Beecham <b>has</b> <b>done</b> <b>more</b> for French music abroad than any French conductor". Berlioz {{featured}} prominently in Beecham's repertoire throughout his career, and in an age when the composer's works received little exposure, Beecham presented most of them and recorded many. Along with Sir Colin Davis, Beecham has been described as one of the two [...] "foremost modern interpreters" [...] of Berlioz's music. [...] Both in concert and the recording studio, Beecham's choices of French music were characteristically eclectic. He avoided Ravel but regularly programmed Debussy. Fauré did not feature often, although his orchestral Pavane was an exception; Beecham's final recording sessions in 1959 included the Pavane and the Dolly Suite. Bizet was among Beecham's favourites, and other French composers favoured by him included Gustave Charpentier, Delibes, Duparc, Grétry, Lalo, Lully, Offenbach, Saint-Saëns and Ambroise Thomas. [...] Many of Beecham's later recordings of French music were made in Paris with the Orchestre National de la Radiodiffusion Française. [...] "C'est un dieu", their concertmaster said of Beecham in 1957.|$|E

[...] Though a common practice of athletes, he has not established his own foundation. [...] Others who know Holliday have elaborated that he has written [...] "very significant" [...] checks to charities. [...] Starting in 2012, Holliday endorsed with Freese for Cardinal Glennon Children's Hospital a pledge program called [...] "Homers for Health." [...] For each home run that the Cardinals hit, fans were encouraged to donate 25 cents. [...] The program became very successful, raising more than $3.7 million in its first five years.

500|$|In 1870, President Grant gave Conkling {{control over}} New York patronage, {{including}} the Customs House at the Port of New York. [...] Having become friendly with Murphy over their shared love of horses during summer vacations on the Jersey Shore, in July of that year, Grant appointed {{him to the}} Collector's position. [...] Murphy's reputation as a war profiteer and his association with Tammany Hall made him unacceptable to many of his own party, but Conkling convinced the Senate to confirm him. [...] The Collector was responsible for hiring hundreds of workers to collect the tariffs due at the United States' busiest port. Typically, these jobs were dispensed to adherents of the political machine responsible for appointing the Collector. Employees were required to make political contributions (known as [...] "assessments") back to the machine, which made the job a highly coveted political plum. [...] Murphy's unpopularity only increased as he replaced workers loyal to Senator Reuben Fenton's faction of the Republican party with those loyal to Conkling's. Eventually, the pressure to replace Murphy grew too great, and Grant asked for his resignation in December 1871. [...] Grant offered the position to John Augustus Griswold and William Orton, each of whom declined and recommended Arthur. Grant then nominated Arthur, with the New York Times commenting, [...] "his name very seldom rises {{to the surface of}} metropolitan life and yet moving like a mighty undercurrent this man during the last 10 years <b>has</b> <b>done</b> <b>more</b> to mold the course of the Republican Party in this state than any other one man in the country." ...|$|E
500|$|Various music journalists, {{critical}} theorists, {{and authors}} have deemed Madonna {{the most influential}} female recording artist of all time. She topped VH1's [...] "100 Greatest Women in Music" [...] list and The Daily Telegraphs [...] "20 Greatest Female Artists" [...] list. Author Carol Clerk wrote that [...] "during her career, Madonna has transcended the term 'pop star' to become a global cultural icon." [...] Rolling Stone of Spain wrote that [...] "She became the first viral Master of Pop in history, years before the Internet was massively used. Madonna was everywhere; in the almighty music television channels, 'radio formulas', magazine covers and even in bookshops. A pop dialectic, never seen since The Beatles's reign, which allowed her to keep {{on the edge of}} tendency and commerciality." [...] Laura Barcella and Jessica Valenti in the book Madonna and Me: Women Writers on the Queen of Pop (2012) wrote that [...] "really, Madonna changed everything the musical landscape, the '80s look du jour, and most significantly, what a mainstream female pop star could (and couldn't) say, do, or accomplish in the public eye." [...] William Langley from The Daily Telegraph felt that [...] "Madonna has changed the world's social history, <b>has</b> <b>done</b> <b>more</b> things as more different people than anyone else is ever likely to." [...] Alan McGee from The Guardian felt that Madonna is a post-modern art, the likes of which we will never see again. He further asserted that Madonna and Michael Jackson invented the terms Queen and King of Pop.|$|E
