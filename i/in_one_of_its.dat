5|$|Around {{the same}} time, the count focused on two other projects: the first {{grew out of}} his longstanding {{interest}} in promoting literature and sciences, and the second, more ambitious aim was {{to fight for the}} gradual abolition of slavery. When in 1867 PedroII openly asked for the gradual eradication of slavery in his Speech from the Throne, Porto Alegre {{was one of the few}} individuals who supported him, sending him a letter of congratulation. On 18 June 1869, the Partenon Literário (Literary Parthenon), a spiritual successor to the Historic and Geographic Institute of the Province of São Pedro, was created and Porto Alegre was made an honorary member. <b>In</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> sessions, the count, who had already embarked on a plan of gradually freeing his own slaves, proposed the creation of a civil association devoted to slavery's abolition. His idea was not only welcomed but came to fruition. The Sociedade Libertadora (Liberation Society) was founded on 29 August, with Porto Alegre as its president, its primary purpose being the purchase of freedom for enslaved children.|$|E
5|$|Lincolnshire {{is home to}} {{the public}} Adlai E. Stevenson High School and to the schools that compose the {{elementary}} Lincolnshire-Prairie View School District 103. It serves as the headquarters for corporations including the global outsourcing company Aon Hewitt, and was the base of operations for the Newman/Haas Racing team. The village of Lincolnshire hosts several annual festivals (including one mirroring the Taste of Chicago) in either commercial establishments such as City Park or the Village Green, or <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> nine public parks. The village maintains a police department that closely collaborates with its local school districts. Lincolnshire manages a public works system at the direct expense of the village; it retrieves all of its water from the city of Highland Park, which derives its water from adjacent Lake Michigan. The village has a council–manager government and is a home-rule municipality. The mayor of Lincolnshire is Elizabeth J. Brandt.|$|E

5|$|Mulder and Ludwig {{venture into}} the {{volcanic}} caves to find Trepkos. When they find Firewalker, Trepkos shoots Ludwig {{in the back with}} a flare gun, killing him. He then burns Ludwig's body, as he was infected with the spore as well. Trepkos tells Mulder that after Firewalker returned from its first descent, Erickson pulverized a rock <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> samples, resulting in his death and the infection of all the scientists immediately surrounding him. Trepkos says that the spore is parasitic in nature, making its hosts pass itself on to others. Meanwhile, in the lab, an infected O'Neil handcuffs herself to Scully to expose her to the spore, forcing Scully to use a hammer to split the chains but to no avail, so she instead protects herself by throwing O'Neil into a sealed chamber and closing the door. A protrusion then bursts out of O'Neil's throat, killing her without spreading the spore to Scully.|$|E
5|$|Seeing no activity, the {{commander}} of the Russian II Corps ordered all his cannons to shift fire onto the 14 guns under Józef Bem. Heavily pressed, Polish artillery withstood the fire for over half an hour before switching to new positions {{to the right of the}} road to Kalisz. It resumed fire on the II Corps, but was again targeted by enemy guns. The artillery duel continued, but the situation of Fort 56 was becoming critical. Shelled from three sides, the largest Polish fort around Warsaw was now isolated. Including reinforcements brought by Col. Wysocki, the crew of the fort included approximately 1,660 infantrymen and ten pieces of artillery. By 10:00 most artillerymen had been killed or wounded (including the fort's artillery commander, Capt. Krzywicki) and had to be replaced with untrained infantrymen, which seriously limited the Polish guns' rate of fire and accuracy. All ramparts were successively damaged by Russian artillery, and there was a 30-metre breach <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> sides.|$|E
5|$|Wilbur {{started the}} fourth and last flight at just about 12 o'clock. The first few hundred feet were up and down, as before, {{but by the time}} three hundred ft had been covered, the machine was under much better control. The course for the next four or five hundred feet had but little undulation. However, when out about eight hundred feet the machine began {{pitching}} again, and, <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> darts downward, struck the ground. The distance over the ground was measured to be 852 feet; the time of the flight was 59 seconds. The frame supporting the front rudder was badly broken, but {{the main part of the}} machine was not injured at all. We estimated that the machine could be put in condition for flight again in about a day or two.|$|E

5|$|Otis began {{gradually}} entering cooler ocean waters, {{although the}} National Hurricane Center noted <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> {{discussions on the}} system that the environment was still warm enough to support a stronger storm. The hurricane continued drifting northwestward, and early on October 1 it reached peak intensity at Category 2 status. At the time, maximum sustained winds were at 105mph (165km/h) and barometric pressure was recorded at 970 mbar (hPa; 28.64 inHg). Hours later, however, it began to weaken, a trend that continued due to southwesterly wind shear and dry air. The cloud pattern associated with the hurricane deteriorated on October 2, {{and the center of}} circulation was separated from the convective activity. Otis weakened to a tropical storm and drifted erratically toward the north-northwest as a result of weak steering currents. Over increasingly cold waters, the cyclone further weakened to a depression on October 3 and consisted of a small swirl of low-level clouds. It became a remnant low pressure area the next day. The system abruptly turned southeastward and drifted parallel to the coast of the Baja California Peninsula until dissipating on October 5.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the {{incident}} that closed his railroad, Walt Disney consulted with Roger Broggie about the concept of including his ridable miniature train in a potential tour of Walt Disney Studios in Burbank, north of Downtown Los Angeles. Broggie, believing {{that there would be}} limited visitor capacity for the attraction, recommended to Disney that he make the train bigger in scale. The idea of a studio tour was eventually replaced by the idea of an amusement park named Disneyland {{across the street from the}} studio, and <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> first design concepts at that proposed location, a miniature steam train ride was included, as well as a larger, narrow-gauge steam railroad attraction. During this time, Disney proposed that the narrow-gauge Crystal Springs & Southwestern Railroad, which the nearby Travel Town Museum in Griffith Park planned to build, be extended to run through Disneyland. Planned construction of the Ventura Freeway across land between the two sites, and rejection by the Burbank City Council of a new amusement park in their city, led Disney to look for a different location to build the park and its narrow-gauge railroad.|$|E
5|$|The station {{started to}} trial the {{co-firing}} of petcoke (petroleum coke) <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> boilers in June 2005, ending in June 2007, burning 15% petcoke and 85% coal. Petcoke was burned {{to make the}} electricity more competitive {{as the price of}} running the FGD equipment was making the electricity more expensive. The Environment Agency (EA) granted permission for the trial in June 2004, despite the plans being opposed by Friends of the Earth and Selby Council. To meet their concerns, emissions were constantly monitored through the trial, and they were not allowed to burn petcoke without operating the FGD plant to remove the high sulphur content of the emissions. The trial proved that there were no significant negative effects on the environment, and so in late 2007 Drax Group applied to move from trial conditions to commercial burn. The EA granted permission in early 2008 after agreeing with Drax's findings that the fuel had no significant negative effects on the environment. The station can now burn up to 300,000 tonnes of the fuel a year, and stock up to 6,000 tonnes on site.|$|E
