5000|$|Graphite furnace atomic {{absorption}} spectroscopy (GFAAS) (also known as Electrothermal Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (ETAAS)) {{is a type of}} spectrometry that uses a graphite-coated furnace to vaporize the sample. Briefly, the technique is {{based on the fact that}} free atoms will absorb light at frequencies or wavelengths characteristic of the element of interest (hence the name {{atomic absorption}} spectrometry). Within certain limits, the amount of light absorbed can be linearly correlated to the concentration of analyte present. Free atoms of most elements can be produced from samples by the application of high temperatures. In GFAAS, samples are deposited in a small <b>graphite</b> <b>or</b> pyrolytic <b>carbon</b> coated <b>graphite</b> tube, which can then be heated to vaporize and atomize the analyte. The atoms absorb ultraviolet or visible light and make transitions to higher electronic energy levels. Applying the Beer-Lambert law directly in AA spectroscopy is difficult due to variations in the atomization efficiency from the sample matrix, and nonuniformity of concentration and path length of analyte atoms (in graphite furnace AA). Concentration measurements are usually determined from a working curve after calibrating the instrument with standards of known concentration.The main advantages of the graphite furnace comparing to aspiration atomic absorption are the following: ...|$|R

40|$|A reactor {{apparatus}} (10) {{adapted for}} continuously producing molten, solar grade purity elemental silicon by thermal reaction of a suitable precursor gas, such as silane (SiH. sub. 4), is disclosed. The reactor apparatus (10) includes an elongated reactor body (32) having <b>graphite</b> <b>or</b> <b>carbon</b> walls which are heated to a temperature exceeding the melting temperature of silicon. The precursor gas enters the reactor body (32) through an efficiently cooled inlet tube assembly (22) and a relatively thin <b>carbon</b> <b>or</b> <b>graphite</b> septum (44).

30|$|Under the {{carbonate}} activation process, the porosity of carbonized RH {{is developed}} mainly due to “leaching out” of the template silica {{phase in the}} form of water-soluble silicates and interaction of carbon phase with CO 2 which is formed as a product of SiO 2 and carbonates interaction. Besides that, carbon phase is able to interact with carbonates themselves with microporosity developing, {{especially in the case of}} molar ratios of carbonates to SiO 2 more than  1 : 1 [23]. In whole, carbonate activation leads to obtaining carbons with A BET =  800 – 1400  m 2 g− 1, possessing porosity shifted to mesopore area [23]. In the case of alkalis, porosity development in the carbons is due to interaction of alkalis both with SiO 2 and carbon phases, but the carbon phase seems to undergo significant reconstruction because of interaction of alkalis with carbon via oxygen-containing surface functional groups.
