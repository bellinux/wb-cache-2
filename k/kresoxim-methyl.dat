5|$|Using a {{standard}} laboratory method to determine antimicrobial susceptibility, methanol-based extracts of Strobilurus tenacellus fruit bodies were {{shown in a}} 2000 study to have low antibacterial activity against the bacterium Bacillus subtilis, and low to moderate activity against the fungi Candida albicans and Aspergillus fumigatus. The fungus produces the natural antibiotic strobilurinA, which was reported as a novel compound from this species in 1977; other strobilurins have since been found in other basidiomycete wood-rotting fungi, like Porcelain Mushroom for example. StrobilurinA {{is thought to be}} derived biosynthetically from the amino acid L-phenylalanine. In nature, the fungus secretes the chemical to prevent invasion by other fungi that challenge its nutrient source. It works by blocking electron transfer in the mitochondria, stopping respiration by binding to the ubihydroquinone oxidation center of the bc1 complex. This prevents the competing fungus from creating its own energy and inhibiting its growth at the earliest stages of the life cycle, the spore germination stage. The fungus is resistant to its own chemical because its ubihydroquinone has three amino acid residues that prevent the strobilurins from binding. Because of their sensitivity to light, and high vapor pressures that causes them to rapidly disappear when applied to the surface of a leaf, chemically unmodified strobilurins are not generally useful as fungicides for agricultural use. The strobilurin-derived compound azoxystrobin, ﬁrst made commercially available in 1996, was designed to overcome these limitations. It is the world's biggest-selling fungicide.

50|$|The {{molecular}} {{structures of}} modern agrochemicals {{are much more}} complex than in older products, but lower than of their pharma counterparts. The average molecular weight of the top 10 is 330, as compared with 477 for the top 10. In comparison to reagents used in pharmaceutical fine chemical syntheses, hazardous chemicals, e.g. sodium azide, halogens, methyl sulfide, phosgene, phosphorus chlorides, are more frequently used. Agrochemical companies sometimes outsource just these steps, which require specialized equipment, on toll conversion deals. With exception of the pyrethroids, which are photostable modifications of naturally occurring pyrethrums, active ingredients of agrochemicals rarely are chiral. Examples within herbicides are the world’s longstanding top-selling product, Monsanto’s round-up (glyphosate). Syngenta’s cyclohexadione-type mesotrione and paraquat dichloride. Within insecticides, the traditional organophosphates, like malathion, and pyrethroids such as γ-cyhalotrin are being substituted for by neonicotinoids, like Bayer’s imidacloprid and Syngenta’s thiamethoxam and pyrazoles, such as BASF’s fipronil. Chloranthaniliprole {{is the most important}} representative of Du Pont’s award-winning anthranilic diamide family of broad spectrum insecticides. Within fungicides, the strobilurins, a new class, are growing rapidly and already have captured more than 30% of the $10 billion global fungicide market. Syngenta’s azoxystrobin was the first product launched. Also BASF’s F-500 Series, a.o. pyraclostrobin and <b>kresoxim-methyl,</b> Bayer CropScience, and Monsanto are developing new compounds in this class. Combination pesticides, such as Monsanto’s Genuity and SmartStax are more and more frequently used.|$|E

40|$|Three {{commercial}} {{formulations of}} strobilurins, viz., azoxystrobin, <b>kresoxim-methyl,</b> and trifloxystrobin were evaluated for their efficacy against pearl millet downy mildew disease caused by Sclerospora graminicola. In vitro studies revealed inhibition of S. graminicola sporulation, zoospore release, and zoospore motility at 0. 1 - 2 mug ml(- 1) {{of all the}} three fungicides. The fungicides were evaluated for phytotoxic effects on seed quality parameters and for their effectiveness against downy mildew disease by treating pearl millet by: (1) seed dressing, (2) seed dressing followed by foliar spray, and (3) also by foliar spray alone. The highest non-phytotoxic concentrations of 5, 10, and 10 mug ml(- 1) for azoxystrobin, trifloxystrobin, and <b>kresoxim-methyl,</b> respectively, were selected for further studies. Under greenhouse conditions, these fungicides showed varying degrees of protection against downy mildew disease. Among the three fungicides, azoxystrobin {{proved to be the}} best by offering disease protection of 66 %. Further, seed treatment along with foliar application of these fungicides to diseased plants showed enhanced protection against the disease to 93, 82, and 62 % in treatments of azoxystrobin, <b>kresoxim-methyl</b> and trifloxystrobin respectively. Foliar spray alone provided significant increase in disease protection levels of 91, 79, and 59 % in treatments of azoxystrobin, <b>kresoxim-methyl,</b> and trifloxystrobin, respectively. Disease curative activity of azoxystrobin was higher compared to trifloxystrobin and <b>kresoxim-methyl.</b> Tested fungicides showed weaker translaminar activity, as the disease inhibition was marginal when applied on adaxial leaf surface. Partial systemic activity of azoxystrobin was evident by root uptake, while trifloxystrobin and <b>kresoxim-methyl</b> showed lack of systemic action in pearl millet. A trend in protection against downy mildew disease similar to greenhouse results was evident in the field trials. Grain yield was significantly increased in all strobilurin fungicide treatments over control and maximum increase in yield of 1673 kg ha(- 1) was observed in combination treatments of seed treatment and foliar spray with azoxystrobin.

Complete inhibition of sporangial sporulation, zoospore release, and motility was observed with 2 mu g ml(- 1) in trifloxystrobin, and 5 mu g ml(- 1) for azoxystrobin and <b>kresoxim-methyl.</b> Seed treatment with different concentrations of strobilurins enhanced seed germination and seedling vigor of sunflower {{to varying degrees}} compared to control. Highest seed germination was recorded at 10 mu g ml(- 1) in <b>kresoxim-methyl,</b> and maximum seedling vigor was noticed with trifloxystrobin at 30 mu g ml(- 1). The effect of strobilurins was tested as seed treatment, foliar application, and seed treatment followed by foliar application. Under greenhouse conditions none of the concentrations used, either as seed treatment and foliar application, were phytotoxic. For the three strobilurins, the seed treatment along with foliar application enhanced {{the protection of the}} plants as compared to only the treatment of seeds. Foliar spray treatments alone provided an intermediate control of the disease. Trifloxystrobin showed a better effect than <b>kresoxim-methyl</b> and azoxystrobin.

40|$|<b>Kresoxim-methyl</b> {{was one of}} the two first {{strobilurins}} to be discovered, and nowadays it {{is widely}} used as an antifungal agent in crop protection. Because of its low molecular weight and negligible structural complexity, the generation of antibodies to <b>kresoxim-methyl</b> noticeably requires the preparation of functionalized haptens. In this study, the introduction of a hydrocarbon spacer arm at the aromatic moieties of the target molecule was carried out by a convergent strategy based on the Sonogashira cross-coupling reaction, and functionalized linkers of the same length were also tethered to the aliphatic toxophore group by the O-alkylation reaction. Evaluation of the immune response, in terms of antibody affinity, showed a differential behavior among five synthesized haptens whose sole dissimilarity was the derivatization site. The characteristic (methoxyimino) acetate moiety of strobilurins was revealed as the optimum linker position for high-affinity polyclonal and monoclonal antibody production. However, good monoclonal antibodies were isolated from mice immunized with a hapten carrying the linker at an opposite site, which otherwise generated a poor polyclonal response in rabbits. Site-heterology was confirmed as a feasible approach for the improvement of the apparent affinity, particularly with polyclonal antibodies.

40|$|Rhizoctoniasis {{of potato}} occurs in all {{regions of the}} world where the crop is grown. The disease is caused by various {{anastomosis}} groups (AGs) of the fungus Rhizoctonia solani, of which AG- 3 is the most common. Very little information is available on the AGs involved in potato rhizoctoniasis in South Africa. This study elucidated the etiology of the disease in the country and also provided guidelines regarding alternative control strategies. The vast majority (99. 3 %) of R. solani isolates from symptomatic potato tubers collected at seven of the 14 potato production regions in South Africa belonged to AG- 3, and 0. 7 % to AG- 5. Of the isolates from infected stems and roots, 82. 1 % were AG- 3, 12. 8 % AG- 4, and 5. 1 % AG- 5. Isolations from soil yielded 67. 7 % AG- 3, 22. 0 % AG- 4, 5. 5 % AG- 5, and 2. 4 % of each of AG- 7 and AG- 8. In vitro screening indicated that AG- 3 isolates were the most virulent. The progeny of seed tubers naturally infected with R. solani was rendered free of infection by dipping the tubers in hot water at 55 C for 8 minutes, 60 ºC for 6 minutes, or 65 ºC for 4 minutes. However, treatments more severe than 55 ºC for 8 minutes progressively increased tuber mortality. OA 5 DP, an organic tin complex, proved to be the most effective of 20 disinfectants for killing sclerotia of the pathogen on seed tubers and rendering the progeny free of infection, but exhibited acute phytotoxicity towards the tubers. Significant control without any phytotoxicity was achieved with the didecyl ammonium chloride compound, Sporekill. Tolclofos-methyl was the only fungicide that provided total control of potato rhizoctoniasis, whereas seed tuber treatment with fludioxonil, <b>kresoxim-methyl</b> and metam-sodium significantly reduced disease in the progeny. Incorporation of of the biocontrol formulation TrykocideTM (Trichoderma harzianum) into soils artificially infested with R. solani AG- 3 eradicated the pathogen. Significant reductions in pathogen populations were also evident in soils amended with azoxystrobin, <b>kresoxim-methyl,</b> MaxifloTM Azospirillum brasilense), AvogreenTM (Bacillus subtilis), cattle, chicken and sheep manure, citrus and mango waste compost, composted kraal manure, and shoot tissues of Brassica napus, B. oleracea var. capitata, Raphanus sativus, Sinapsis alba and Tagetes minuta. TrykocideTM provided total control of stem canker in artificially infested soil, whereas <b>kresoxim-methyl,</b> azoxystrobin, sheep manure, B. napus and B. oleracea var. capitata shoot tissue, mango waste compost, and the systemic resistance-inducing compound, acibenzolar-s-methyl, reduced the disease significantly.

Since its man-agement {{is strongly dependent on}} chemicals, the rational design of control programmes requires {{a good understanding}} of the fungicide resistance phenomenon in field populations. Fifty single-spore isolates of P. fusca were tested for sensitivity to three quinone-outside inhibiting (QoI) fungicides: azoxystrobin, <b>kresoxim-methyl</b> and trifloxystrobin. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values for QoI-sensitive isolates were found to range from 0. 25 to 10 lg ml) 1 for azoxystrobin to 5 – 25 lg ml) 1 for <b>kresoxim-methyl,</b> using a leaf disc-based bioassay. High levels of cross-resistance to QoI fungicides were found. Eleven isolates showed resistance to the three QoI fungicides tested with MIC and EC 50 values> 500 lg ml) 1 resulting in RF values as high as> 715 and> 1000 for trifloxystrobin and azoxystrobin, respectively. A survey of P. fusca QoI resistance was carried out in different provinces located in the south central area of Spain during the cucurbit growing seasons in 2002, 2003 and 2004. Examination of a collection of 250 isolates for QoI resistance revealed that 32 % were resistant to the three fungicides tested; the provinces of Ciudad Real, Córdoba and Murcia being the locations with the highest frequencies of resistance (44 – 74 %). By contrast, no resistance was found in Badajoz, and relatively low frequencies were observed in Almerı́a and Valencia (10 – 13 %). Nearly 50 % of resistant isolates were collected from melon plants. Based on these data, recommendations about the use of QoI fungicides for cucurbit powdery mildew management in the sampled areas are made...|$|E
40|$|The {{ultimate}} {{concern over}} pesticides {{in the environment}} is their toxic impact on nontarget organisms, including humans. For {{over the last two}} decades, the toxicological research has focused on pesticide-induced oxidative stress in terms of monitoring alterations in various biochemical and molecular compositions. A relative new group of agricultural fungicides, strobilurins, represent a major class of plant protection products and world's largest selling fungicides. They act as complex III Qo site inhibitors and thus disrupting electron transport in the respiratory chain. This electron leakage generates superoxide and potentially results in increased oxidative stress.

40|$|The {{sensitivity}} of 36 Septoria pyricola single spore isolates, obtained from isolated pear orchards, to carbendazim, bitertanol, flusilazole, myclobutanil, azoxystrobin, <b>kresoxim-methyl,</b> pyraclostrobin, trifloxystrobin and boscalid, was studied in vitro. Spore suspensions were point-inoculated on media amended with various concentrations of fungicides and the {{minimum inhibitory concentration}} (MICs) of the fungicides was determined. Most isolates were highly resistant to carbendazim, forming colonies even at concentrations of 100 mg L- 1 of the fungicide. A few isolates failed to form colonies with carbendazim concentrations of 0. 1 and 10 mg L- 1; these isolates were designated carbendazim-sensitive and moderately carbendazim-resistant respectively. The MIC of DMI fungicides was up to 1 mg L- 1 with some isolates, and the mean MICs of bitertanol, flusilazole and myclobutanil were 0. 133 ± 0. 036, 0. 075 ± 0. 044 and 0. 230 ± 0. 038 mg L- 1 respectively. The MIC of the QoI fungicides was up to 0. 1 mg L- 1 with most isolates, but some isolates were 100 -fold less sensitive to azoxystrobin. The mean MICs of azoxystrobin, <b>kresoxim-methyl,</b> pyraclostrobin and trifloxystrobin were 0. 177 ± 0. 040, 0. 075 ± 0. 035, 0. 067 ± 0. 063, and 0. 073 ± 0. 065 mg L- 1 respectively. Overall, the MIC of boscalid was 1 mg L- 1, and the mean MIC was 0. 111 ± 0. 044 mg L- 1. The ED 50 values of representative isolates are also presented, as determined by colony formation with dispersed spore inoculation on a medium amended with fungicides.

40|$|The {{effects of}} three {{pesticides}} on the preimaginal development of Osmia cornuta (Latreille) were investigated. All three pesti-cides are considered harmless to adult bees: two of them, Stroby ® (a. i. <b>kresoxim-methyl)</b> and Cuprocaffaro/WG ® (a. i. copper oxychloride) are fungicides, and one, Tecomag ® (Quassia amara extract), is an insecticide. Eggs/larvae of O. cornuta, provided with their maternal provision, were placed inside gelatine capsules. The following groups, {{each of them}} exposed to a different treatment, were established: 30 eggs/larvae, the maternal provision being added with 1 µl Stroby ® at field dose (14 g/hl); 29 eggs/larvae, the maternal provision being added with 1 µl Cuprocaffaro/WG ® at field dose (100 g/hl); 29 eggs/larvae, the maternal provision being added with 1 µl Tecomag ® at field dose (400 cc/hl); 30 eggs/larvae, the maternal provision being added with 1 µl of deionised water (untreated control); 20 eggs/larvae were left on their maternal provi-sion and transferred in gelatine capsules, thus acting as non-manipulated control. The toxic impact of the three pesticides has been evaluated by recording and comparing the final mortality in each group, i. e. percent larvae that did not finish cocoon spinning. Tecomag ® showed the most toxic effect (82. 8 % final mortality), followed by copper oxychloride (44. 8 % mortality). The final mortality of eggs/larvae treated with Stroby ® (13. 3 %) {{did not differ significantly}} from the one recorded for both the untreated and the non-manipulated controls (10. 0 % and 9. 9 %, respectively). Stroby may thus be considered harmless to O. cornuta larvae. No manipulation damage was evidenced, being the mortality of the non-manipulated control group identical to the water-treated con-trol.

40|$|Rusty Spot {{has long}} been known as a harmful peach disease {{in many parts of the}} world. During the past several years, rusty spot {{infection}} of the late-maturing peach cultivars (Summerset, Suncrest, Fayette and O’Henry) caused significant yield losses in Serbia. Although the etiology of the disease is still unknown, there are numerous studies attempting to set a strategy for its control and recommend appropriate chemical and other peach protection methods. However, because of specific environmental conditions in Serbia, recommended protection method using repeated fungicide treatments, starting from petal fall, did not prove to be efficient and the rate of infection in some susceptible peach cultivars reached 100 %. In 2003 and 2004 a field trial was conducted in order to test the efficacy of fungicides (a. i. <b>kresoxim-methyl,</b> flusilazole and sulfur) for the efficient control of Rusty Spot epidemics. The trial was carried out under conditions of natural infection on the peach cv. Summerset at the locality of Bela Crkva, Serbia. In the ntreated control plots,high disease incidence was recorded with the percentage of affected fruit surface ranging from 33. 5 % in the first, up to the 35. 4 % in the second year of the trail. Among fungicides included in the trial, <b>kresoxim-methyl</b> proved to be the most efficient (90. 25 % in the first and 91. 12 % in the second year of the trial), flusilazole exhibited lower efficacy (87. 28 % and 80. 61 %, respectively) while sulfur was the least efficient 82. 33 % and 80. 30 %, respectively).
