40|$|AbstractWe {{present the}} use of Nested Dirichlet <b>distributions</b> <b>to</b> {{represent}} uncertain <b>branching</b> ratios in chemical networks. The interest is twofold: (1) to preserve the structure of experimental data by imposing sum-to-one representations; and (2) {{to be able to}} introduce totally unknown subsets of branching ratios (missing data). These points are central to sound uncertainty propagation and sensitivity analysis in complex chemical networks...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{observed}} that Bayesian analyses of sequence data sets using the program MrBayes sometimes generate extremely large branch lengths, with posterior credibility intervals for the tree length (sum of branch lengths) excluding the maximum likelihood estimates. Suggested explanations for this phenomenon include the existence of multiple local peaks in the posterior, lack of convergence of the chain in {{the tail of the}} posterior,mixing problems, andmisspecified priors on branch lengths. Here, we analyze the behavior of Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms when the chain is in the tail of the posterior distribution and note that all these phenomena can occur. In Bayesian phylogenetics, the likelihood function ap-proaches a constant instead of zero when the <b>branch</b> lengths increase <b>to</b> infinity. The flat tail of the likelihood can cause poor mixing and undue influence of the prior. We suggest that the main cause of the extreme branch length estimates produced in many Bayesian analyses is the poor choice of a default prior on branch lengths in current Bayesian phylogenetic programs. The default prior in MrBayes assigns independent and identical <b>distributions</b> <b>to</b> <b>branch</b> lengths, imposing strong (and un-reasonable) assumptions about the tree length. The problem is exacerbated by the strong correlation between the branch lengths and parameters in models of variable rates among sites or among site partitions. To resolve the problem, we suggest twomultivariate priors for the branch lengths (called compoundDirichlet priors) that are fairly diffuse anddemonstrate thei...|$|R
40|$|This {{document}} is a {{comparative study of}} four methods (Markov chains, compound processes, substructure factorization and generating functions) to compute the moments of probability <b>distributions</b> associated <b>to</b> homogeneous <b>branching</b> processes. Although all these methods have their own interests, the generating functions {{seem to be the}} most appropriate tools for this kind of probability model. In order to compare them, each method is first described and then applied to an example of multitype branching processes: the evolution of the number of active buds for a particular GreenLab plant growth model. Finally, the methods are listed according to their effectiveness...|$|R

40|$|The molecular-level {{features}} of starch {{in relation to}} the changes in rice functionality during storage are not yet fully elucidated. This work investigated the effects of rough rice storage conditions on starch fine structures and physicochemical properties. Dried rough rice samples (medium-grain Bengal and long-grain Cypress) were stored at 4, 21, and 387 C in temperature-controlled chambers and then periodically removed and evaluated after 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 months. Flour (powdered head rice) and starch (extracted from head rice by alkali steeping) samples were evaluated for pasting and thermal properties. High-performance size-exclusion chromatography and high-per-formance anion exchange chromatography were used to characterize starch molecu-lar size and amylopectin chain-length distribution, respectively. Significant changes in starch fine structure were observed primarily on the 387 C lots, and to some extent on the 217 C lots. The decreased amylose: amylopectin ratio, shortened amylopectin average chain length, and the shift in chain-length <b>distribution</b> <b>to</b> shorter <b>branch</b> chains were implicative of molecular-level starch degradation. The flour and starch samples showed inconsistent trends in pasting and thermal properties, thus suggesting the role of not only starch but also its interaction with non-starch components in rice aging...|$|R
40|$|The problem o f {{piping system}} dead-legs are {{frequently}} encountered in high purity water systems throughout the pharmaceutical and semi-conductor industries. The {{installation of a}} pipe tee in sterile process pipework often creates a stagnant dead-leg zone which can result {{in the formation of}} bio-film and compromise the entire system. Considerable basic research is required to address the lack of understanding of this problem and to assist during design, manufacture, installation and operation of these critical systems. This study involves the application o f CFD (computational fluid dynamics) techniques to the study of turbulent flow in Pharmaceutical pipe teejunctions. Numerical models have been developed to initially study divided turbulent flow in a range of standard Pharmaceutical tee-j unctions and then to study dead-leg flow. Numerical predictions were compared with previously presented experimental results based on Laser Doppler Velocimetry. Turbulent models such as the k - e and Reynolds Stress model (RSM) were used to analyse the flow. Dye injection studies highlighted the lack of penetration o f the dead-leg and complex branch flow patterns for both sharp and round entry tees. Hydrogen bubble techniques gave clear evidence of the presence of a slow rotating vortex at entry <b>to</b> each <b>branch</b> and the presence of stagnation zones throughout the dead-legs. The effect o f mainstream velocity and loop <b>to</b> <b>branch</b> ratios on dead-leg flow patterns was analysed. Stagnation zones were identified within each branch and the presence of a slow rotating cell within the dead-leg resulted in a lack of exchange of mainstream fluid from the <b>distribution</b> <b>to</b> the <b>branch.</b> The 6 D-rule was found to be industrially irrelevant. 1 to 2 D configurations should be used to avoid stagnation. No configuration resulted in high wall shear stress within the branch and a reduction in <b>branch</b> <b>to</b> loop diameter increased branch stagnation. There was no evidence of exchange of fluid between the loop and branch and all configurations had some quiescent (dormant/inactive) water...|$|R
40|$|In Bayesian phylogenetic inference, {{commonly}} used prior distributions for branch lengths are the uniform, exponential, and gamma distributions. We derive the exact distributions of branch lengths of gene trees under a fixed species tree using the coalescent model. We {{find that the}} distributions of branch lengths depend on both the shape and branch lengths of the species tree, which depend on the population genetic parameters of ancestral population sizes and divergence times. Distributions of branch lengths are formed by mixtures depending on the ancestral populations in which coalescent events occur (coalescent histories). For some sets of moderately short branches, these mixtures can lead <b>to</b> <b>distributions</b> of <b>branch</b> lengths which are not well approximated by uniform, exponential, or gamma distributions, thus suggesting that a prior based on a mixture of distributions might be more appropriate for inferring branch lengths on some gene trees...|$|R
40|$|Group {{transfer}} polymerization [GTP] {{was used}} <b>to</b> synthesize <b>branched</b> statistical copolymers by copolymerizing either 2 -(dimethylamino) ethyl methacrylate) [DMA] or 2 -(diethylamino) ethyl methacrylate) [DEA] with {{ethylene glycol dimethacrylate}} (EGDMA) in THF at 20 °C. Since GTP has reasonable “living” character, it allows good control over both the primary chain length and the molecular weight <b>distribution</b> compared <b>to</b> previous <b>branched</b> vinyl polymers synthesized using conventional radical polymerization. Using GTP allows a remarkably high proportion of EGDMA brancher to be copolymerized without causing macrogelation. This unexpected result is attributed to {{a significant amount of}} intramolecular cyclization occurring (in addition <b>to</b> intermolecular <b>branching)</b> in these syntheses. Branched diblock copolymers based on DMA and DEA were prepared by sequential monomer addition, with EGDMA being used <b>to</b> achieve <b>branching</b> in either the DMA block or the DEA block or in both blocks. The order of monomer addition was varied <b>to</b> examine whether <b>branching</b> affected the “living” character of the polymerization. There was some evidence for better blocking efficiencies if the first block was a linear homopolymer, rather than a branched block copolymer. 1 H NMR spectroscopy indicated that very high comonomer conversions (> 99 %) were obtained in all cases. The branched diblock copolymers were characterized in terms of their block compositions and primary chain lengths using 1 H NMR, and their molecular weight distributions were assessed by THF GPC using a light scattering detector to obtain absolute Mw values. The evolution of molecular weight with conversion was assessed by periodic sampling of the polymerizing solution. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) and surface tensiometry data obtained for dilute aqueous solutions of the branched block copolymers were compared to those obtained for a linear diblock copolymer. Similar surface tension profiles were obtained regardless of the block architecture, but DLS studies indicated that larger, more polydisperse micelles were obtained if the coronal block was branched...|$|R
40|$|The thermal {{behaviour}} of ethylene based (co) polymers, {{as revealed}} by (TM) DSC {{can be used}} as a product-fingerprint because it strongly depends on molecular parameters such as chain length, chain length <b>distribution</b> and <b>branching.</b> <b>To</b> properly understand DSC thermal behaviour, the concomitant changes in phase structure (morphology) and their relationships with the molecular structure and processing history were studied, using independent morphology-sensitive tools under conditions that are DSC-typical. SALLS and the real-time SAXS/WAXD synchrotron allowed for a morphological characterisation from the micrometer to the nanometer scale within time frames of a few seconds. The latter tools were optimised, and new methods for X-ray and light scattering data evaluation were developed. A molecularly well-characterised linear polyethylene, a homogeneous ethylene-l-octene copolymer and a binary blend of these components were investigated. The latter can be considered as a model system for linear low-density polyethylene. status: publishe...|$|R
