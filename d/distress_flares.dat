She escapes as the shark and the zombie attack each other. Brian shoots at the shark, and the shark rams the boat, damaging it. Eventually, the group arrives at Matul, firing <b>distress</b> <b>flares</b> to request assistance. Menard goes to meet them, leaving his nurse (Stefania D'Amario) {{to supervise the}} mass burial of dead patients. He tells Anne that her father is dead—a victim of the troubles on the island—and asks the group to check on Paola. They are horrified to discover her corpse being devoured by zombies.|$|E
5|$|Titanic {{received}} six {{warnings of}} sea ice on 14 April but was travelling near her maximum speed when her lookouts sighted the iceberg. Unable to turn quickly enough, the ship suffered a glancing blow that buckled her starboard (right) side and opened five of her sixteen compartments to the sea. Titanic {{had been designed}} to stay afloat with four of her forward compartments flooded but no more, and the crew soon realised that the ship would sink. They used <b>distress</b> <b>flares</b> and radio (wireless) messages to attract help as the passengers were put into lifeboats. In accordance with existing practice, Titanic's lifeboat system was designed to ferry passengers to nearby rescue vessels, not to hold everyone on board simultaneously; therefore with the ship sinking rapidly and help still hours away, there was no safe refuge {{for many of the}} passengers and crew. Compounding this, poor management of the evacuation meant many boats were launched before they were completely full.|$|E
5|$|Observing the French fleet's {{departure}} from the harbour at dusk, Pellew immediately dispatched Phoebe to Colpoys and Amazon to the main fleet at Portsmouth with warnings, before approaching the entrance to Brest in Indefatigable {{with the intention of}} disrupting French movements. Believing that the frigates in the bay must be the forerunners of a larger British force, de Galles attempted to pass his fleet through the Raz de Sein. This channel was a narrow, rocky and dangerous passage, and de Galles used corvettes as temporary light ships that shone blue lights and fired fireworks to direct his main fleet through the passage. Pellew observed this, and sailed Indefatigable right through the French fleet, launching rockets and shining lights seemingly at random. This succeeded in confusing the French officers, causing the Séduisant to strike the Grand Stevenent rock and sink with the loss of over 680 men from a complement of 1,300. Séduisants <b>distress</b> <b>flares</b> added to the confusion and delayed the fleet's passage until dawn. His task of observing the enemy completed, Pellew took his remaining squadron to Falmouth, sent a report to the Admiralty by semaphore telegraph, and refitted his ships.|$|E

25|$|One such {{rescue mission}} {{occurred}} on 26 March 1942. A Socony tanker, , was torpedoed off Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, and Tarbells lookouts sighted her <b>distress</b> <b>flares</b> {{a little before}} 0900. The destroyer instantly rang up full speed; and, one-half hour later, {{she arrived at the}} scene of the attack. She dropped a depth charge barrage to drive off any U-boats lurking in the vicinity and then picked up 22 survivors. After a futile search for the enemy submarine, she disembarked the survivors at Morehead City, North Carolina.|$|E
500|$|By 01:20, the {{seriousness}} of the situation was now apparent to the passengers above decks, who began saying their goodbyes, with husbands escorting their wives and children to the lifeboats. <b>Distress</b> <b>flares</b> were fired every few minutes {{to attract the attention of}} any ships nearby and the radio operators repeatedly sent the distress signal CQD. Radio operator Harold Bride suggested to his colleague Jack Phillips that he should use the new SOS signal, as it [...] "may be your last chance to send it". The two radio operators contacted other ships to ask for assistance. Several responded, of which RMS Carpathia was the closest, at [...] away. She was a much slower vessel than Titanic and, even driven at her maximum speed of , would have taken four hours to reach the sinking ship.

500|$|There was one [...] "crucial {{historical}} fact" [...] Cameron {{chose to}} omit {{from the film}} – the SS Californian {{was close to the}} Titanic the night she sank but had turned off its radio for the night, did not hear her crew's SOS calls, and did not respond to their <b>distress</b> <b>flares.</b> [...] "Yes, the [...] Californian. That wasn't a compromise to mainstream filmmaking. That was really more about emphasis, creating an emotional truth to the film," [...] stated Cameron. He said there were aspects of retelling the sinking that seemed important in pre- and post-production, but turned out to be less important as the film evolved. [...] "The story of the Californian was in there; we even shot a scene of them switching off their Marconi radio set," [...] said Cameron. [...] "But I took it out. It was a clean cut, because it focuses you back onto that world. If Titanic is powerful as a metaphor, as a microcosm, {{for the end of the}} world in a sense, then that world must be self-contained." ...|$|E

As a distracted Josh reaches for the tape, Tammi quickly throws the looped end of the mooring rope around his neck. The rope immediately reaches the end of its tether and Josh is wrenched into the sea, snapping his neck and killing him. Tammi, now the sole survivor, fires a <b>distress</b> <b>flare</b> in the hope of being rescued. She then lies down on the tender and morbidly stares up at the night sky, as the raft drifts away into the ocean.|$|R

2500|$|Barratt, the boat's legal owner, professed {{ignorance of}} the {{arrangements}} made at Greatwood, believing, he said, that Bown had gone there to discuss with Rainbird future charter work once the necessary licences had been obtained. Under local regulations, a [...] licence for carrying up to 12 passengers was subject to examination of the boat by the harbourmaster, who would also require the person in charge to be a licensed skipper. Vessels proposing to carry more than 12 passengers needed a licensed master, a qualified marine engineer, and a Class III Passenger Certificate from the Board of Trade. This certificate was only granted to vessels in good condition with watertight hull compartments, a two-way radio, a qualified radio operator {{and a range of}} safety devices. Darlwyne had no radio, no <b>distress</b> <b>flares,</b> and carried only two lifebelts.

2500|$|On {{the night}} [...] airship S. S. 40 made a four-hour {{reconnaissance}} but having to fly above [...] to avoid ground-fire, found that little could be observed on the ground. A storm on 29 August blew down a 21 Squadron hangar, in which five B.E. 2c's were destroyed and nine damaged. On 3 September {{the attack on}} Guillemont was observed by 9 Squadron aircraft. A contact patrol from [...] watched British troops advance on Guillemont and German troops send up <b>distress</b> <b>flares,</b> when they withdrew from the village and the trenches between Guillemont and Wedge Wood. Just after [...] British mirror flashes were seen along {{the eastern edge of}} Guillemont and after another half-hour, more were seen at Wedge Wood and the Ginchy road, up to the Leuze Wood–Guillemont crossroads. Further south the 5th Division was seen to be held up before Falfemont Farm, where the crew descended and attacked a German machine-gun detachment holding up the British advance. Later contact patrols revealed that Falfemont Farm was not captured but that to the north ground had been consolidated. The farm was attacked again in the afternoon of 4 September, as 9 Squadron observed and a message was sent to the British artillery when German troops were seen to leave a quarry near the farm and take position in shell-holes nearby, which was followed by a [...] "curtain of fire" [...] falling on the German positions.

2500|$|Once {{the attack}} was launched, the 21st Battalion went in on the left, and {{supported}} by the creeping barrage and tanks, overcame relatively light German resistance. The 23rd also advanced [...] "smoothly", although it was resisted more strongly. The 25th, however, fared the worst. Due to their exposed position on the right of the Australian line, the 25th Battalion was supported by the Australian Heavy Trench Mortar Battery; nevertheless the 25th suffered heavily, losing almost two entire platoons as German machine-gun positions cut through their ranks. As the Germans launched a counter-attack, a request for emergency artillery support was sent via a <b>distress</b> <b>flare,</b> and another platoon was brought up to stem the tide and eventually the 25th secured their objective north of the Roman Road. The tanks were instrumental in breaking the German will for further counter-attacks, aggressively pushing [...] beyond the Allied line, moving into Accroche Wood to harass the German rear during {{the second phase of the}} attack.|$|R

On 28 April 1944 Johnen downed another Halifax at 01:31 southwest of Strasbourg for his 19th victory. It was part of a force of 322 heavy bombers sent to attack Friedrichshafen. As Johnen closed to attack the bomber—Halifax III ND759 R-Robert from No. 35 Squadron RAF flown by Warrant Officer Bob Thomas (RAAF)—he was also hit by return-fire. The bomber landed on Lake Constance in Switzerland and {{all but one of the}} crew lived to be interned. Two other German night fighter pilots pursued RAF bombers into Swiss airspace that night and both Josef Kraft and Gerhard Friedrich both filed claims, but returned to base.Johnen was also forced to land his damaged Bf 110G-4, C9+EN (Werknummer—Factory Number 740 055), at Zürich-Dubendorf and was captured by personnel of the Swiss Air Force and was interned. During the chase one of the Daimler-Benz DB 605 engines began losing oil and the coolant temperature soared. Johnen feathered the propeller but flew into a searchlight blinded him. He fired a <b>distress</b> <b>flare</b> but lost his bearings. When the flare was deployed the searchlight was momentarily turned off and Johnen headed for an illuminated airfield.|$|R

5000|$|The {{first hint}} of {{anything}} untoward on the Flannan Isles came on 15 December 1900. The steamer Archtor on passage from Philadelphia to Leith passed the islands in poor weather and noted that the light was not operational. The ship suffered the misfortune to run aground on Carpie Rock in the Firth of Forth [...] some time after passing the lighthouse and after the struggle to save the ship, {{the fact of the}} lighthouse light being unlit was not reported on arrival at Oban for some time, the ship's master, Captain Holman, being distracted by the damage to his ship, and the procedures for dealing with her on arrival in port. The island lighthouse was manned by a three-man team (Thomas Marshall, James Ducat, and Donald MacArthur), with a rotating fourth man spending time on shore. The relief vessel, the lighthouse tender Hesperus, was unable to set out on a routine visit from Lewis planned for 20 December due to adverse weather and did not arrive until noon on Boxing Day (26 December). On arrival, the crew and relief keeper found that the flagstaff was bare of its flag, none of the usual provision boxes had been left on the landing stage for re-stocking, and more ominously, none of the lighthouse keepers were there to welcome them ashore. Jim Harvie, captain of Hesperus, gave a strident blast on his whistle and set off a <b>distress</b> <b>flare,</b> but no reply was forthcoming.|$|R

Moments later, Lady Elizabeth struck a reef in Bickley Bay. The ship lost control and swung to the south when Captain Scott ordered the port anchor be dropped. At 10:30pm, Lady Elizabeth began listing to starboard and the water started coming over the decks. Captain Nash, a pilot on Rottnest Island saw the blue <b>distress</b> signal <b>flares</b> {{but was unable to}} reach Lady Elizabeth due to the weather. He was forced to wait out the storm. By morning, weather conditions improved to launch a rescue of Lady Elizabeth's crew.
