5|$|Daily {{association}} with each other, {{both at the}} luncheons and outside of them, inspired members of the Circle to collaborate creatively. The <b>entire</b> <b>group</b> worked together successfully only once, however, to create a revue called No Sirree! which helped launch a Hollywood career for Round Tabler Robert Benchley.|$|E
5|$|Grant, Tim and Lex finally {{reach the}} visitor center. Grant heads {{out to look}} for Sattler, leaving Tim and Lex inside. Tim and Lex are pursued by the raptors in an {{industrial}} kitchen, but they escape and join Grant and Sattler. Lex restores full power from the control room, allowing the group to call Hammond, who in turn calls for help. The group is cornered by the raptors, but {{they are able to}} escape when the Tyrannosaurus suddenly appears and kills the raptors. Hammond arrives in a Jeep with Malcolm, and the <b>entire</b> <b>group</b> boards a helicopter to leave the island.|$|E
5000|$|Proponents {{counter that}} the {{exploration}} of group and ethnic dynamics through writing deepens human understanding and previously, <b>entire</b> <b>groups</b> of people were ignored or neglected by American literature. (Jay, 1997) ...|$|R

50|$|Despite the {{expected}} {{allegiance to the}} system when the students enter the school, a sizable number of its graduates live abroad. There are no statistics, but <b>entire</b> <b>groups</b> and graduations hold regular meetings outside the island, especially US (Miami) and Spain.|$|R
5|$|In August 2000, NASA asked project {{managers}} to consider {{looking at the}} Space Shuttle, instead of the previously proposed EELV, as a launch vehicle. In late November 2000, NASA announced that the project's scientific team was selected. The group included notable names {{from the world of}} extrasolar planet research including Geoffrey Marcy. The <b>entire</b> <b>group</b> consisted of 10 principal investigators and five mission specialists. At the time of this NASA announcement launch was scheduled for 2009 and the mission was still part of the Origins Program.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, Samsung's Chairman Lee Kun-hee {{recognised}} {{the automotive industry}} as the culmination of several others. For the Samsung Group, this would allow to leverage resources and technologies from the <b>entire</b> <b>group</b> including Samsung Electrics and Samsung Electronics. He initially tried {{to take control of}} Kia, but competition from other bidders and legal restrictions made him to drop the idea. Kia was eventually purchased by Hyundai.|$|E
5|$|The United Nations Security Council never listed Hezbollah as a {{terrorist}} organization under its sanctions list although its members listed it on an individual basis: The United States and France listed the <b>entire</b> <b>group</b> as {{a terrorist}} organization although the United Kingdom listed Hezbollah's military wing as well. Russia has considered Hezbollah a legitimate sociopolitical organization. and the People's Republic of China remains neutral, and maintains contacts with Hezbollah.|$|E
5000|$|These {{culture zone}} {{differences}} reflect different historical pathways of how <b>entire</b> <b>groups</b> of societies entered modernity. These pathways account for people’s different senses of existential security and individual agency, {{which in turn}} account for their different emphases on secular-rational values and self-expression values.|$|R
2500|$|Donald Niewyk and Francis Nicosia, in The Columbia Guide to the Holocaust (2000), favour a {{definition}} {{that focuses on}} the Jews, Roma, and Aktion T4 victims: [...] "the systematic, state-sponsored murder of <b>entire</b> <b>groups</b> determined by heredity. This applied to Jews, Gypsies, and the handicapped." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{physically}} disabled, mentally ill, homosexuals, {{and a host}} {{of others}} who are labeled deviant because they deviate from the expectations of a group, are subject to stigmatization- the social rejection of numerous individuals, and often <b>entire</b> <b>groups</b> {{of people who have been}} labeled deviant.|$|R
5|$|Unaware that Novara {{had been}} disabled, and fearing that his ships would be drawn {{too close to}} the Austrian naval base at Cattaro, Acton broke off the pursuit. The {{destroyer}} Acerbi misread the signal, and attempted to launch a torpedo attack, but was driven off by the combined fire of Novara, Saida, and Helgoland. At 12:05, Acton realized the dire situation Novara was in, but by this time, the Sankt Georg group was too close. The Sankt Georg group rendezvoused with Novara, Saida, and Helgoland, and Csepel and Balaton reached the scene as well. The <b>entire</b> <b>group</b> returned to Cattaro together.|$|E
5|$|All {{seven of}} Angelou's {{installments}} {{of her life}} story are {{in the tradition of}} African-American autobiography. Starting with I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings, Angelou challenges the usual structure of the autobiography by critiquing, changing, and expanding the genre. Angelou said in 1989 that she is the only serious writer to choose autobiography to express herself, but she reports not one person's story, but the collective's. Scholar Selwyn R. Cudjoe writes that Angelou is representative of the convention in African-American autobiography as a public gesture that speaks for an <b>entire</b> <b>group</b> of people. Her use of devices common in fictional writing, such as dialog, characterization and thematic development, has led some reviewers to categorize her books as autobiographical fiction.|$|E
5|$|Bawdsey, {{right on}} the eastern coast in a {{relatively}} secluded location, could not effectively be protected from air attack or even bombardment from boats offshore. The need to move the team to a more protected location on the opening of hostilities had been identified long before the war. During a visit to his alma mater at Dundee University, Watt approached the rector to ask about potentially basing the team there, on short notice. When the Germans invaded Poland and war was declared on 3 September 1939, the research teams packed up and arrived in Dundee to find the rector only dimly recalling the conversation and having nothing prepared for their arrival. Students and professors had since returned after the summer break, and only two small rooms were available for the <b>entire</b> <b>group.</b>|$|E
5000|$|According to Grof, the reliving of {{emotional}} and physical pain can become so intense that an identification with [...] "the pain of <b>entire</b> <b>groups</b> of unfortunate people, all of humanity, or even all of life", can manifest. This is accompanied with [...] "dramatic physiological manifestations".|$|R

5|$|Becoming a Peking opera {{performer}} {{requires a}} long and arduous apprenticeship beginning from an early age. Before the 20th century, pupils were often handpicked {{at a young age}} by a teacher and trained for seven years on contract from the child's parents. Since the teacher fully provided for the pupil during this period, the student accrued a debt to his master that was later repaid through performance earnings. After 1911, training took place in more formally organized schools. Students at these schools rose as early as five o'clock in the morning for exercises. Daytime was spent learning the skills of acting and combat, and senior students performed in outside theatres in the evening. If they made any mistakes during such performances, the <b>entire</b> <b>group</b> was beaten with bamboo canes. Schools with less harsh training methods began to appear in 1930, but all schools were closed down in 1931 after the Japanese invasion. New schools were not opened until 1952.|$|E
5|$|Despite Pauline's pleas {{that the}} duel is a trap, Silence stands outside the saloon. A killer shoots his left hand, greatly {{impairing}} his speed and marksmanship. Loco then {{stands in the}} doorway, ready to face the weakened Silence. As Silence begins reaching for his Mauser, Loco reaches for his Colt Single Action Army – but as Silence draws, another wounding shot is fired. Loco fires at Silence's head, killing him. Distraught, Pauline attempts to shoot Loco herself, but swiftly dies as well. The bounty killers turn their guns on the outlaws, massacring the <b>entire</b> <b>group.</b> As Loco and his men prepare to collect their bounties, he takes Silence's Mauser from Pauline's hands. The killers ride out of Snow Hill into the morning sun. A title card explains that Loco's actions resulted in public condemnation of bounty killing, and a memorial was erected in Snow Hill to honor those who died by his greed.|$|E
5|$|Through this period, Rowe finally {{concluded}} that Dundee was unsuitable {{for any of}} the researchers, and decided to move again. This time he selected Worth Matravers on the southern coast, where all of the radar teams could once again work together. Due to confused timing and better planning {{on the part of the}} AI team, they arrived at Worth Matravers from St Athan before the long convoy from Dundee could make its way south. This caused a traffic jam that further upset Rowe. Nevertheless, everything was set up by the end of May 1940, with the AI team working primarily from huts south of Worth Matravers, and carrying out installations at a nearby airfield. With this move the <b>entire</b> <b>group</b> became the Ministry of Aircraft Production Research Establishment (MAPRE), only to be renamed again as the Telecommunications Research Establishment (TRE) in November 1940.|$|E
50|$|In Louise: Amended, Krug recounts her dashed dreams, {{the details}} of her {{condition}} and the difficulties of her recovery. The book is a combination of traditional memoir interspersed with fictional chapters written from the perspective of her boyfriend, family and friends, examining how personal tragedies affect <b>entire</b> <b>groups</b> of people.|$|R
50|$|In {{the third}} quarter of 2006, the Singapore store emerged as the best {{performing}} among the <b>entire</b> <b>group's</b> 559 outlets, with the highest revenue generated per square meter. The highest-grossing location in US territory is a recently remodeled and expanded store in Puerto Rico, it generated $17 million in sales annually.|$|R
5000|$|As in the {{non-overlapping}} groups case, {{the group}} Lasso regularizer will potentially set <b>entire</b> <b>groups</b> of coefficients to zero. Selected variables are those with coefficients [...] However, {{as in this}} case groups may overlap, we take {{the intersection of the}} complements of those groups that are not set to zero.|$|R
5|$|Upon {{arrival at}} Auschwitz, the SS {{forcibly}} separated {{the men from}} the women and children, and Otto Frank was wrenched from his family. Those deemed able to work were admitted into the camp, and those deemed unfit for labour were immediately killed. Of the 1,019 passengers, 549—including all children younger than 15—were sent directly to the gas chambers. Anne Frank, who had turned 15 three months earlier, was one of the youngest people spared from her transport. She was soon made aware that most people were gassed upon arrival and never learned that the <b>entire</b> <b>group</b> from the Achterhuis had survived this selection. She reasoned that her father, in his mid-fifties and not particularly robust, had been killed immediately after they were separated.|$|E
5|$|Following {{a four-day}} reprieve {{away from the}} frontline, the 12th Battalion {{relieved}} the 9th Battalion at Lagnicourt on 14 April. Around dawn the following day, the Germans launched a fierce counter-attack against the 1st Australian Division's line. Breaking through the Australian line, the Germans forced back the 12th Battalion's D Company, which was {{to the left of}} Newland's A Company. Soon surrounded and under attack on three sides, Newland withdrew the company to a sunken road which had been held by Captain Percy Cherry during the capture of the village three weeks earlier, and lined the depleted company out in a defensive position on both banks. Establishing his platoon in position, Whittle noticed a group of Germans moving a machine gun into position to enfilade the road. As the gunners began to set up the weapon, Whittle, under heavy rifle fire, jumped from the road and single-handedly rushed the crew. Using his bombs, he succeeded in killing the <b>entire</b> <b>group</b> before collecting the gun and taking it back to A Company's position.|$|E
5|$|One year later, Celes awakens from a coma on {{a deserted}} island and learns {{that the world}} has been devastated by Kefka, who now dominates it as a god-like ruler. Much of the human {{population}} has died and plant and animal life are slowly being killed by sickness, punctuating humanity's despair. Celes sets out from the Solitary Island to try to reunite with as many of her friends as she can find. Celes is only required by the game's story to reunite with Edgar and Setzer, who leads them to the Falcon, an airship that belonged to a deceased friend; however, in a series of mostly optional side-quests, the player has the opportunity to gather the <b>entire</b> <b>group,</b> all still alive, as well as new allies Umaro and Gogo. Together, this quantity of Returners launch a new offensive against Kefka's Tower. Inside, the Returners battle their way through Kefka's defenses and destroy the three statues, the source of Kefka's newfound power. When destroying the statues, once the source of all magic, does not cause any noticeable reaction, the party realizes that Kefka has successfully drained the Warring Triad of power and has become the source of all magical power.|$|E
25|$|Following Airwork's {{takeover}} of Air Charter, the Airwork board put Freeman {{in charge of}} the <b>entire</b> <b>group's</b> UK and European short-haul operations.

5|$|The German {{offensive}} {{caught the}} Red Army by surprise and made large gains {{on the first}} day. The spearhead forces enjoyed air support {{and were able to}} defeat counterattacks by Soviet troops. By 13 December, Soviet resistance slowed the German advance considerably. Although German forces took the area surrounding Verkhne-Kumskiy, the Red Army launched Operation Little Saturn on 16 December. Operation Little Saturn crushed the Italian 8th Army on Army Group Don's left flank, threatening the survival of Manstein's <b>entire</b> <b>group</b> of forces. As resistance and casualties increased, Manstein appealed to Hitler and to the commander of the German 6th Army, General Friedrich Paulus, to allow the 6th Army to break out of Stalingrad; both refused. The 4th Panzer Army continued its attempt to open a corridor to the 6th Army on 18–19 December, but was unable to do so without the aid of forces inside the Stalingrad pocket. Manstein was forced to call off the assault on 23 December and by Christmas Eve the 4th Panzer Army began to withdraw to its starting position. Due to the failure of the 6th Army to breakout and the attempt to break the Soviet encirclement, the Red Army was able to continue the strangulation of German forces in Stalingrad.|$|E
