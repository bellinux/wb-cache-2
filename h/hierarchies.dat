5|$|The {{male and}} female {{dichotomy}} of polar opposites with the former oppressing the latter at all times is refuted in the Indian context because it was men who initiated social reform movements against various social evils.

Not all women are powerless at all times.|$|E

5|$|There are no {{dominance}} <b>hierarchies</b> {{among the}} females, and the females do not form coalitions. Males {{in the group}} are generally {{related to each other}} and thus tend to form strong affiliations, and only form dominance <b>hierarchies</b> during the breeding season. This is especially the case among males of the same age. Neither males nor females are dominant over each other, an egalitarian social system that is unique to Central American squirrel monkeys. In South American species, either the females (S. boliviensis) or males (S. sciureus) are dominant over the other sex, and both sexes form stable dominance <b>hierarchies.</b> Groups of Central American squirrel monkeys generally do not compete or fight with each other. Male Costa Rican squirrel monkeys are known to have very close bonds with each other.|$|E

5|$|After {{the tumultuous}} An Lushan Rebellion (755–763), the early Tang career path of {{officials}} rising in {{a hierarchy of}} six ministries—with Works given the lowest status and Personnel the highest—was changed into a system where officials chose specialized careers within {{one of the six}} ministries. The commissions of Salt and Iron, Funds, and Census that were created to deal with immediate financial crisis after An Lushan's insurrection were the influential basis for this change in career paths that became focused within functionally distinct <b>hierarchies.</b> The varied career backgrounds and expertise of early Northern Song officials meant that they were to be given specific assignment to work in only one of the ministries: Personnel, Revenue, Rites, War, Justice, or Works. As China's population increased and regional economies became more complex the central government could no longer handle the separate parts of the empire efficiently. As a result of this, in 1082 the reorganization of the central bureaucracy scrapped the <b>hierarchies</b> of commissions in favor of the early Tang model of officials advancing through a hierarchy of ministries, each with different levels of prestige.|$|E

5|$|The {{blurring}} or {{diffusion of}} the Republic's more rigid <b>hierarchies</b> led to increased social mobility under the Empire, both upward and downward, {{to an extent}} that exceeded that of all other well-documented ancient societies. Women, freedmen, and slaves had opportunities to profit and exercise influence in ways previously less available to them. Social life in the Empire, particularly for those whose personal resources were limited, was further fostered by a proliferation of voluntary associations and confraternities (collegia and sodalitates) formed for various purposes: professional and trade guilds, veterans' groups, religious sodalities, drinking and dining clubs, performing arts troupes, and burial societies.|$|E

The characteristics of Canadian indigenous societies included permanent settlements, agriculture, complex societal <b>hierarchies,</b> and trading networks. Some of these cultures had collapsed by the time European explorers arrived in the late 15th and early 16th centuries and have only been discovered through archeological investigations.|$|E

40|$|The {{neutrino}} mass <b>hierarchy</b> {{is one of}} the neutrino fundamental properties yet to be determined.

Neutrino flavor conversions inside the supernova are sensitive to neutrino mass <b>hierarchy.</b> Due to Mikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein effects, the full swapping of ν̅_e flux with the ν̅_x (x=μ, τ) one occurs in the inverted <b>hierarchy,</b> while such a swapping does not occur in the normal <b>hierarchy.</b> As a result, more high energy IBD events occur in the detector for the inverted <b>hierarchy</b> than the high energy IBD events in the normal <b>hierarchy.</b> By comparing IBD interaction rate with the mass <b>hierarchy</b> independent NC interaction rate, one can determine the neutrino mass <b>hierarchy.</b> Comment: 18 pages, 6 figure...|$|R
