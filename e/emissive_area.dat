40|$|A simple {{approach}} to fabricating ordered InGaN/GaN nanorod arrays light-emitting diodes (LEDs) with strongly directional light emission is reported. The far field radiation {{pattern of the}} nanorod arrays LEDs shows preferential emission in a ± 10 ° cone about the surface normal and contained other features arising from diffraction associated with the periodicity of the nanorod array. The output power per unit in-plane <b>emissive</b> <b>area</b> at 300 -mA drive current is three times larger than that of an equivalent planar LED...|$|E
40|$|Synchrotron-based {{techniques}} can reveal the mechanisms behind the dark spot formation of organic light-emitting devices. Though great improvements {{have been made}} in recent years, organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) still have limited life-times. In general, the degradation of OLEDs manifests itself as a decrease in device luminance with time. Three distinct modes of deterioration have been recognized: dark spot gen-eration, catastrophic failure, and intrinsic degradation. 1 In the first mode, nonemissive regions appear on the emitting surface. Catastrophic failure occurs when electrical shorts cause large leakage currents. In the third mode, changes in the organic ma-terial properties cause long-term decreases in the <b>emissive</b> <b>area</b> brightness. So far, methods for investigating these phenomena have in-volved chemical and physical techniques, like high-performanc...|$|E
40|$|An {{extensive}} {{campaign of}} diffuse CO 2 soil flux {{was carried out}} at the cone of Vesuvio in October 2006 with two main objectives: 1) to provide an estimation of CO 2 diffusely discharged through the soils in the summit area and 2) to evidence those sectors of the volcano where structural and morphological conditions could favour the gas output. The survey consisted of 502 measurements of soil CO 2 flux homogenously distributed over an area of about 1. 8 km 2. Results of this survey were compared with those obtained during a similar campaign carried out by Frondini et al. in 2000, from which we have taken and reinterpreted a subset of data belonging to the common investigated area. Graphical statistical analysis showed three overlapping populations in both surveys, evidencing the contribution of three different sources feeding the soil CO 2 degassing process. The overall CO 2 emission pattern of 2006 is coherent with that observed in 2000 and suggests that a value between 120 and 140 t/day of CO 2 {{is representative of the}} total CO 2 discharged by diffuse degassing from the summit area of Vesuvio. The preferential exhaling area lies in the inner crater, whose contribution resulted in 45. 3 % of the total CO 2 emission in 2006 (with 62. 8 t/day) and in 57. 4 % (with 70. 3 t/day) in 2000, although its extension is only 13 % of the investigated area. This highly <b>emissive</b> <b>area</b> correlated closely with the structural discontinuities of Vesuvio cone, mainly suggesting that the NW-SE trending tectonic line is actually an active fault leaking deep gas {{to the bottom of the}} crater. The drainage action of the fault could be enhanced by the “aspiration” effect of the volcanic conduit. </p...|$|E
40|$|Analysis of {{processes}} {{used for the}} production of single crystal turbine components reveals significant shortcomings. Inadequate consideration has been made of the fact the system is cooling dominated and that the amount of cooling tends to increase as the <b>emissive</b> cooling <b>area</b> expands during the process. Experimental evidence suggests that during processing, this increased cooling causes the solidification interface {{to move away from the}} baffle and become curved. The motion of the interface results in a decrease in the solidification gradient. The combination of these actions can result in variations in PDAS (primary dendrite arm spacing), grain misalignment and the production of defects. It is shown that despite this tendency, microstructural stabilization may be achieved through the use of the heat of fusion as an internal process heat source...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn May 2013, {{the bottom}} of Ligeia Mare (LM), Titan, was {{detected}} in the active altimetry mode of the Cassini RADAR at a maximum depth of 160 m (Mastroguiseppe et al., 2014). This was the first and, so far, only detection of the floor of an extraterrestrial sea. The difference of amplitude of the surface and bottom echoes was also investigated in order to evaluate losses by absorption in the liquid layer. In this paper, we analyze the passive radiometry data that were acquired concurrently with the active data, {{in order to provide}} an independent estimate of the liquid loss tangent and to determine the dielectric constant of both the liquid and the seafloor. We then used these results to convert the radiometry mosaic of LM into a low-resolution bathymetry map. For the last 10 years, the passive radiometer incorporated in the Cassini RADAR has been observing the 2. 2 -cm wavelength thermal microwave emission from Titan. Its calibration has been recently refined to an unprecedented accuracy of < 1 % (Janssen et al., this meeting). To date, all LM has been mapped in high-spatial resolution. The 2. 2 -cm emissivity measured over it {{is directly related to the}} depth of the seafloor, the most <b>emissive</b> <b>areas</b> being the deepest and vice-versa. Comparing the radiometry data acquired in May 2013 to a two-layer model and using as an input the altimetry-derived depth profile, we find that the loss tangent value that best fits data is very low and only slightly smaller than that found by Mastroguiseppe et al. (2014) (3. 0 ± 1. 0 10 - 5). This strongly suggests that the sea is composed of pure hydrocarbons with no or few suspended particles. A dielectric constant of 2. 9 is inferred for the sea bottom pointing to water ice as its most likely composition rather than organic sediments. Lastly, the dielectric constant of the liquid is found to be < 1. 7, which, together with the low loss tangent, supports the idea of a methane-dominated composition (rather than ethane, Mitchell et al., submitted) ...|$|R
40|$|A {{method of}} {{measuring}} the precise temperature distribution of GaN-based light-emitting diodes (LEDs) by quantitative infrared micro-thermography is reported. To reduce the calibration error, the same measuring conditions {{were used for}} both calibration and thermal imaging; calibration was conducted on a highly <b>emissive</b> black-painted <b>area</b> on a dummy sapphire wafer loaded near the LED wafer on a thermoelectric cooler mount. We used infrared thermal radiation images of the black-painted area on the dummy wafer and an unbiased LED wafer at two different temperatures to determine the factors that degrade the accuracy of temperature measurement, i. e., the non-uniform response of the instrument, superimposed offset radiation, reflected radiation, and emissivity map of the LED surface. By correcting these factors from the measured infrared thermal radiation images of biased LEDs, we determined a precise absolute temperature image. Consequently, we could observe from where the local self-heat emerges and how it distributes on the emitting area of the LEDs. The experimental results demonstrated that highly localized self-heating and a remarkable temperature gradient, which are detrimental to LED performance and reliability, arise near the p-contact edge of the LED surface at high injection levels owing to the current crowding effect...|$|R
40|$|Organic light {{emitting}} devices (OLEDs) are {{light emitting}} devices consisting of a stack of organic semiconductors sandwiched by electrodes. Since the first report of a high-efficiency device by Tang and Van Slyke in 1987, OLEDs have attracted considerable attention, particularly for use in flat panel displays. OLEDs provide these products improved power consumption, contrast, response speed, viewing angle, and compatibility with flexible displays. The performance of OLEDs has improved considerably, {{especially in terms of}} stability and efficiency, so they can now meet the requirements for some display products. However, the commercialization of OLED displays remains limited and is hampered primarily by manufacturing issues. These issues include low manufacturing yield, high fabrication cost, and low display quality. Manufacturing issues are largely attributed to difficulties with the color patterning process, the fabrication process by which arrays of red, green and blue (RGB) OLEDs can be made side-by-side on one substrate in order to obtain a full-color display. Currently, RGB color patterning is done by sequential vacuum deposition of red, green and blue materials through a pre-patterned shadow mask, which is typically made of a thin metal sheet. This technique is widely known as fine metal mask (FMM) technology. However, this technique has several inherent limitations, including mask deformation, difficulties in mask-to-substrate overlay alignment, and ability to make masks with micrometer level dimensional accuracy. These limitations reduce the manufacturing yield, display resolution, and display aperture ratio (the ratio of the <b>emissive</b> <b>area</b> to the total surface area of a display). Despite the fact that several approaches for addressing these limitations in OLED displays have been proposed, there is still no commercially viable solution. In this thesis, two novel color patterning techniques for OLED displays are proposed. One approach utilizes laser-patterned polyimide (PI) sheets as shadow masks. This technique takes advantage of the good processability of PI by direct laser ablation, which makes it possible to cut through it to create slits with very high dimensional accuracies. In addition, because this is a dry process, the laser-patterning of the PI sheets can be done after the sheets are already stretched and mounted on the metal holder. This avoids post-patterning deformation of the masks by the stretching step. The use of laser also makes it possible to pattern the PI sheets after they have already been mounted on the thin film transistor (TFT) backplane substrates and thus, in a variant of this technique, allows for the shadow mask to be created in-situ. This in-situ shadow mask patterning technique can be expected to offer further accuracy advantages, since the slits are created by laser over the desired TFT locations directly, and thus eliminates the need for a subsequent mechanical alignment step. This approach can be particularly useful for RGB OLED patterning on flexible substrates where the poor mechanical and dimensional stability of substrates pose additional challenges for aligning shadow masks accurately. The other color patterning approach proposed here is based on the diffusion of a luminescent material from a donor substrate into the organic host material layer of the OLED that is pre-coated on the backplane substrate. The RGB color patterning in this case can be done without the use of shadow masks, so this approach offers significant advantages. The use of a pre-patterned micro stamp as the donor substrate allows the physical contact between the two substrates to be selectively limited to certain areas, which in turn allows limiting this diffusion to only certain areas of the OLED substrate. Such selective diffusion can also alternatively be done through local heating via electric currents, using electrodes in the OLED backplane for this purpose. This eliminates the need for patterned stamps and mechanical alignment. 	In this work, these two techniques are introduced and tested with the purpose of assessing their potential for RGB patterning. As part of this investigation, the effect of using these techniques on OLED performance is also studied. Finally, a first proof-of-concept utilization of the techniques for producing RGB OLEDs fabricated side-by-side on one substrate is demonstrated...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of experimental investigations into the current-voltage characteristics of a planar diode with an explosive emission cathode made from graphite. Studies were performed using a TEU- 500 pulsed electron accelerator (350 – 500 [*]keV, 100 [*]ns, 250 [*]J per pulse). Duration of diode operation, in a mode when electron current is limited by the emissive ability of the graphite cathode, is 15 – 20 [*]ns. The contribution of the cathode periphery to total electron current appears only as an increase in the <b>emissive</b> surface <b>area</b> due to an expansion of explosive plasma. Investigations of an ion diode with a graphite cathode (plane and focusing geometry) were also carried out. Experiments were performed using a TEMP- 4 M ion accelerator, which forms two nanosecond pulses: the first negative pulse (150 – 200 [*]kV, 300 – 600 [*]ns) followed by the second positive (250 – 300 [*]kV, 150 [*]ns). Total diode current in the first pulse is well described by the Child-Langmuir law for electron current at a constant rate of plasma expansion, equal to 1. 3 [*]cm/μs. It is shown that for an area of flat cathode over 25 [*]cm 2, the influence of edge contribution does not exceed measurement error of total diode electron current (10 %) ...|$|R
40|$|Alternating current {{thin film}} {{electroluminescent}} (ACTFEL) devices {{have been used}} in applications requiring small <b>area</b> <b>emissive</b> displays with both high resolution ( 300 pixels per inch), and high intensity (> 3000 fL). These requirements have been met by increasing the luminescent efficiency of ACTFEL devices via two independent techniques: (1) Alternative device geometry for enhanced out coupling of light. (2) Materials engineering for enhanced generation of light. ACTFEL devices are essentially thin film capacitors across which an alternating field is applied. In the `on state', the capacitance of the phosphor layer collapses due to the internal transfer of charge from one interface to the other. Power dissipation in the `on state' is therefore dictated by the drive voltage, drive frequency and the `on state' capacitance. For all of the L-V measurements presented, the device area and drive frequency were held constant, so that at a particular voltage, the relative luminance values are equivalent to relative luminous efficiency values. Hence the efficiency of an ACTFEL device has been demonstrated to be improved by both the utilisation of reflected lateral emission, and by the inclusion of a barrier layer in tandem with high temperature annealing...|$|R
