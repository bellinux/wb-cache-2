I figured that it would be a nice thing to do, to put them both out for Christmas. There's also an unreleased track on the B-side, which is called 'There for Me' which kind of has the same sentiment.

25|$|In another {{empirical}} study, Chaudhry (2009) investigated {{factors affecting}} rural poverty in Southern Punjab (Pakistan), and {{he concluded that}} alleviation of poverty is possible by lowering the household size and dependency ratio, improving education, increasing female labor participation. He employed Logit regression models and used primary source of data from the project area of Asian Development Bank for estimation. Results indicate that as dependency level and household size increase the probability of being poor increases too. Education has the significant inverse relationship with poverty because it provides employment opportunities and rejects poverty. The inclusion of trained and education women workforce will not only ensure women's welfare, it will also increase the overall productivity of the workforce due to more competitiveness. Hence, the developmental and feminist economists {{argue that it is}} desirable for the government to allocate more resources towards women's education, as it is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>benefit</b> the whole society.|$|E

50|$|The Geißbockversteigerung (literally “Billygoat Auction”) is a folk {{festival in}} the form of a {{historical}} game that is celebrated each year on the Tuesday after Whitsun. The festival began with an old agreement with the neighbouring municipality of Lambrecht under which each year to pay off debts for woodland and meadow rights within Deidesheim’s limits, a billygoat had to be delivered by Lambrecht, which was then auctioned, with the proceeds <b>going</b> <b>to</b> Deidesheim’s <b>benefit.</b> This historical situation grew over time into a folk festival.|$|R
2500|$|Belief in {{the afterlife}} varies among Wiccans, and does not occupy a central place within the religion. As the {{historian}} Ronald Hutton remarked, [...] "the instinctual position of most ... {{seems to be that}} if one makes the most of the present life, in all respects, then the next life is more or less certainly <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>benefit</b> from the process, and so one may as well concentrate on the present". Although there are practitioners who do not believe in any form of afterlife, it is nevertheless a common belief among Wiccans that human beings have a spirit or soul that survives bodily death. Understandings of what this soul constitutes vary among different traditions, with Feri Wicca for instance having adopted a belief from Hawaiian religion that the human being has three souls.|$|E

The conflict between the Freisinnigen Verband and Flondor escalated when the latter used his position in the Diet to reject Straucher's proposal for electoral reform. It peaked when democrats accused Flondor of supporting antisemitism, alleging {{that he was the}} anonymous author of some virulently anti-Jewish articles in Bukowinaer Journal. The matter was investigated by a special Diet commission, who found in favor of Flondor, and who reported that the Bukowinaer Journal editor Max Reiner had been paid 1,000 Kronen to incriminate the PPNR leader. The attempt to defame Flondor, attributed by some to Onciul and Straucher's frustration over Flondor's [...] "anti-democratic" [...] stance, became known locally as Die Flondor Affair ("The Flondor Affair"). Reportedly, Straucher was personally involved in the frame-up, speaking in the Diet against Flondor and his family, and accusing Flondor of having intrigued against his PPNR colleague Gheorghe Popovici.|$|E
