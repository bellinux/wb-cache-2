5|$|In 1924, {{several other}} bones, {{including}} a jawless skull, were found <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>sealed</b> closet in the Cathedral of Turku.

The bones are currently stored in the Cathedral of Turku.|$|E
5|$|Based on the {{mechanical}} experience {{gained from the}} Merchant Navy locomotives, Bulleid incorporated his chain-driven valve gear into what became the new design. This now-infamous component was unique in British locomotive design. It gained notoriety because {{it was difficult to}} access when things went wrong and, in tandem with the fast-moving Bulleid steam reverser, could cause irregular valve movements. The entire system was <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>sealed</b> oil bath, another unique design, that provided constant lubrication to the moving parts.|$|E

5|$|It was {{originally}} intended to use a gear-driven valve gear, but space restrictions within the frames and wartime material shortages led Bulleid to design his novel chain-driven valve gear. This component was unique amongst British locomotive design practices. It later gained a bad reputation, because it could cause highly irregular valve events, a problem compounded by the fast-moving Bulleid steam reverser. The entire system was located <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>sealed</b> oil bath, another unique design, providing constant lubrication to the moving parts.|$|E
5|$|The Isobarik is {{so named}} as it employs the {{isobaric}} loading principle invented by Harry Olson in the 1950s: two bass units are mounted <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>sealed</b> container and driven in parallel {{so as to}} effectively double the speaker enclosure volume and extend its bass frequency response beyond what would be possible for otherwise identical speakers. Linn used {{a variant of the}} isobaric principle and patented the use of two bass drive units ("woofers") facing forward in an isobaric arrangement in early 1974.|$|E
5|$|Gases {{from the}} furnace are cleaned using {{selective}} non-catalytic reduction (SNCR), spray absorbers and active carbon injection. These processes remove nitrogen oxides, acidic gasses, dioxins and heavy metals from the plants emissions. The remaining gases are passed through fine-fabric bag filters to remove and solid particles, {{before it is}} released from the chimney. Each incineration line has its own independent stack in the chimney, and the flue gases are continuously monitored before being released. This information is relayed to the control room. The remaining fly ash from the filters contains particles from the incineration, lime from the spray absorbers, salt and carbon dust, and so is stored <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>sealed</b> silo until it is taken from the site for disposal. Incinerator bottom ash left on the incineration grate after the burning is moved by converyor to a bunker. Whilst on the conveyor, a magnet removes ferrous metal from the ash for recycling. The remaining ash is then used as an aggregate in the construction industry.|$|E

5|$|The usual {{transportation}} of plutonium {{is through the}} more stable plutonium oxide <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>sealed</b> package. A typical transport consists of one truck carrying one protected shipping container, holding a number of packages with a total weight varying from 80 to 200kg of plutonium oxide. A sea shipment may consist of several containers, each of them holding a sealed package. The United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission dictates {{that it must be}} solid instead of powder if the contents surpass 0.74TBq (20Curie) of radioactive activity. In a recent example, the ships Pacific Egret and Pacific Heron of Pacific Nuclear Transport Ltd. are taking 331kg (730lbs) of plutonium to a United States government facility in Savannah River, South Carolina.|$|E

40|$|AbstractHeterogeneity in mudstone/shale layers has {{significant}} effects on seal integrity. The presence of intra-layer sandstone channels <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>seal</b> layer may allow the buoyant CO 2 {{to escape from}} the reservoir, even if the globally- averaged permeability of the seal layer seems sufficiently low. We carried out numerical simulations to study the effects of seal discontinuity on the long-term behaviour of CO 2 injected into deep saline aquifers. The results indicate that properties of such channels becomes key factors of seal integrity and following mass phase distribution of CO 2 trapped by startigraphic, dissolution, and residual gas mechanism, if present <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>seal...</b>|$|R

25|$|Monoclinic phosphorus, or violet phosphorus, is {{also known}} as Hittorf's {{metallic}} phosphorus. In 1865, Johann Wilhelm Hittorf heated red phosphorus <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>sealed</b> tube at 530°C. The upper part of the tube was kept at 444°C. Brilliant opaque monoclinic, or rhombohedral, crystals sublime. Violet phosphorus can also be prepared by dissolving white phosphorus in molten lead <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>sealed</b> tube at 500°C for 18 hours. Upon slow cooling, Hittorf's allotrope crystallises out. The crystals can be revealed by dissolving the lead in dilute nitric acid followed by boiling in concentrated hydrochloric acid. In addition, a fibrous form exists with similar phosphorus cages.|$|E
25|$|Houdini's second {{variation}} on buried alive was an endurance test designed to expose mystical Egyptian performer Rahman Bey, who had claimed to use supernatural powers to remain <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>sealed</b> casket for an hour. Houdini bettered Bey on August 5, 1926, by remaining <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>sealed</b> casket, or coffin, submerged in {{the swimming pool}} of New York's Hotel Shelton for {{one and a half}} hours. Houdini claimed he did not use any trickery or supernatural powers to accomplish this feat, just controlled breathing.
