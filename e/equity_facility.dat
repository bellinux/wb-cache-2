50|$|While the DTV Delay Act {{extended}} this {{deadline to}} June 12, 2009, Equity applied for {{an extension of}} the digital construction permit in order to retain the broadcast license in case the station went dark. New buyers Fusion Communications were able to build a temporary digital site near Walker to meet the deadline. At the end of analog broadcasting on June 12, 2009, KWWF transitioned from the old <b>Equity</b> <b>facility</b> to Fusion's Iowa master control facility and continued to provide a signal to cable systems. From that point on, KWWF was affiliated with Untamed Sports TV. KWWF's satellite feed was still available on Anik F3 C-Band as of November 2010. Although the station transmitted in 720p, Untamed Sports has never maintained a high definition programming feed, and all programming on the station was carried in standard definition.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the extent to}} which states fund local school district school construction and renovation projects and explores the governance of that funding. It determines the different types of funding assistance that state departments of education provide to local school districts for their educational facilities and what state-level policymakers and administrators have currently mandated to ensure <b>equity</b> in school <b>facilities</b> for all students. Major findings show that most states fund school construction projects utilizing either full funding, equalization grants, percentage matching grants, flat grants, or state loans. Construction funding, however, is a low priority in the majority of states. Thirty-six percent of the states do not address <b>equity</b> among <b>facilities</b> within the state. State distinctions between funds for construction of new facilities and funds for renovation are minimal. Recommendations are offered that include the need for state evaluation of the adequacy and effectiveness of their current capital outlay provisions, the need for <b>facility</b> <b>equity</b> policies, and a greater need to address the decaying infrastructure of America's schools.

40|$|In this paper, the {{question}} of how the spatial <b>equity</b> of a <b>facility</b> system can be measured is addressed. The varied meanings of equity in general and of spatial equity in particular are reviewed. The problems associated with the measurement of spatial equity are discussed. The issue of how to measure equity is difficult; for example, the analysis of spatial equity raises questions about the appropriate geographical scale of analysis. Four methods of measuring spatial equity are outlined. These methods are applied to the distribution of day-care centres in Metropolitan Toronto. The policy implications of measuring spatial <b>equity</b> for public <b>facilities</b> and agencies are examined. ...|$|R
50|$|Alternative display {{facility}} (ADF) is an <b>equity</b> trading <b>facility</b> {{created in}} the United States by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), a self-regulatory organization (SRO). The ADF is {{an alternative to the}} exchange for publishing quotations and for comparing and reporting trades. This differs from a trading facility with execution capabilities (stock exchange) in that the exchange would simply send back to the owner of the displayed order a notice of execution. FINRA has operated an ADF since July 29, 2002.|$|R

40|$|Planning for the {{provision}} of services is complex. Location-allocation modeling {{has proven to be a}} valuable approach in siting service facilities. An important consideration in siting facilities is to ensure an equitable distribution of services. This may be done by requiring the placement of at least one or a few service facilities in certain defined (often political) regions or zones. Although the incorporation of regional requirements does serve to address equity, the location-allocation approach tends to produce siting schemes with highly uneven facility workloads. If the intent of regional constraints is to ensure <b>equity,</b> then <b>facilities</b> with excessive workloads provide relatively poor service and thus do not maintain the intent of the regional placement restrictions. Accordingly it is necesary to account for capacity limitations at facilities in addition to the use of regionally specified siting requirements. This paper introduces the Capacitated Regionally Constrained p-Median Problem, which incorporates regional requirements in a location-allocation framework, in addition to ensuring that maximum capacity limitations are maintained. Example applications are solved using a Lagrangian-based solution approach...|$|R

40|$|In {{the late}} 1980 s, many {{developing}} countries were forced to adopt structural adjustment policies {{as a condition for}} securing loans from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank. One of the World Bank's recommended policies was to change the mix of private and public health facilities. This study, based on fieldwork done in Tanzania in 1993, examines the impact of this policy on health-care accessibility in two northern Tanzanian districts, one rural and one urban. Accessibility was measured in terms of equality and equity of coverage. The placement of the very few government clinics opened during the years 1985 - 1993 did much more to improve coverage than the haphazard location of many new private clinics. Equity was not improved as very few clinics were placed in demographically needy areas. Accessibility Health <b>facilities</b> <b>Equity</b> Tanzania...|$|R

The empirical results reveal that the overall average technical efficiency is relatively low, which can potentially reduce their output contribution. Empirical results also indicate that firm size, firm age, skilled labour, location, type of manufacturing ownerships, cooperatives, foreign investment and exports are important firm-specific factors contributing to the technical efficiency of Thai manufacturing SMEs.

40|$|The recent {{proliferation}} of facility-siting conflicts underscores {{the need for}} new analytical techniques in which the external effects associated with noxious facilities are considered explicitly. In general, in prescriptive facility-location models it is assumed that having populations "closer", as characterized by transport or accessibility advantages, is better for desirable facilities, but, locating "farther" away is better for undesirable facilities. The modeling formulation developed in this paper adds two new concepts to the prescriptive modeling work on locating noxious facilities: (1) "complementary anticover" as a measure of <b>equity</b> for siting <b>facilities</b> that provide a required capacity for producing goods or services, and (2) perceived risk attributable to the scale of these facilities. These two concepts, in conjunction with conventional cost considerations, are used to develop a multiobjective location model that may be used to find locational patterns which mitigate public opposition across a broad range of noxious facilities. ...|$|R
40|$|Aims: Postnatal care of {{the newborn}} is {{essential}} {{in order to reduce}} neonatal mortality. Nepal has made great efforts to improve maternal and child health by focusing on accessibility and outreach over the past decades. This study aims to examine trends, over the past decade, in levels and <b>equity</b> of <b>facility</b> delivery rates and the provision of newborn care after home delivery in Nepal. Methods: Household-level data from the Demographic Health Surveys (DHS) 2006 and 2011 and the Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS 5) from 2014 performed in Nepal was sourced for the study. Coverage rates of facility delivery and newborn care after home delivery were calculated and logistic regression models were used to ascertain inequity. Results: Home delivery rate dropped from 79. 2 % in 2006 to 46. 5 % in 2014, a development showing an inequitable distribution, with a larger share of better-off families shifting to facility delivery. For those who still delivered at home there was an increased rate of early initiation of breastfeeding and adequate temperature control, but only 2. 2 % of women delivering at home received a home visit by a health professional {{in the first week of}} delivery. No inequity in receiving newborn care after home delivery could be detected. Conclusions: There have been significant improvements in facility delivery rates over the last 10 years in Nepal and postnatal care at home has improved. There is, however, an alarmingly low level of home visits during an infant's first week...|$|R
40|$|Public {{schools in}} the United States will face {{significant}} infrastructure needs {{within the next few}} years. Some of the numerous issues surrounding these needs, as they affect Nevada's schools, are detailed in this report. Current practices in Nevada have followed those of other quickly growing school systems in which funds are being diverted from routine maintenance and capital improvement so as to support programs. Some remedies to this practice, such as general obligation bonds or "pay-as-you-go" funding, are explored. For the benefit of comparison, capital construction in other states and varying levels of participation are presented. Some possible alternatives for state assistance in Nevada are covered, such as structural alternatives and financing alternatives, including state general obligation bonds, state revenue bonds, and state appropriations. Options currently under consideration in other states are likewise discussed. It is argued that the recent spate of <b>equity</b> lawsuits involving <b>facilities</b> construction in other states should guide any participation by Nevada in school construction...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{large-scale}} study of commonality in liquidity and resilience across assets in an ultra high-frequency (millisecond-timestamped) Limit Order Book (LOB) dataset from a pan-European electronic <b>equity</b> trading <b>facility.</b> We first show that extant work in quantifying liquidity commonality through {{the degree of}} explanatory power of the dominant modes of variation of liquidity (extracted through Principal Component Analysis) fails to account for heavy tailed features in the data, thus producing potentially misleading results. We employ Independent Component Analysis, which both decorrelates the liquidity measures in the asset cross-section, but also reduces higher-order statistical dependencies. To measure commonality in liquidity resilience, we utilise a novel characterisation as the time required for return to a threshold liquidity level. This reflects a dimension of liquidity that is not captured {{by the majority of}} liquidity measures and has important ramifications for understanding supply and demand pressures for market makers in electronic exchanges, as well as regulators and HFTs. When the metric is mapped out across a range of thresholds, it produces the daily Liquidity Resilience Profile (LRP) for a given asset. This daily summary of liquidity resilience behaviour from the vast LOB dataset is then amenable to a functional data representation. This enables the comparison of liquidity resilience in the asset cross-section via functional linear sub-space decompositions and functional regression. The functional regression results presented here suggest that market factors for liquidity resilience (as extracted through functional principal components analysis) can explain between 10 and 40 % of the variation in liquidity resilience at low liquidity thresholds, but are less explanatory at more extreme levels, where individual asset factors take effect...|$|R
40|$|Thai SMEs are {{recognized}} as a core element to foster economic growth, employment and business establishments, exports. Despite SMEs obvious significance, they face several severe difficulties that act as obstacles to their further development. This study uses a stochastic frontier production function and technical inefficiency effects model to examine firm-specific factors affecting the technical inefficiency of Thai manufacturing SMEs and predict the technical efficiency of manufacturing SMEs, utilizing firm-level industrial census data in the period 1997 and 2007, classified into two aspects: By size of manufacturing SMEs (small and medium) and by sub-manufacturing sectors classified by SITC Revision 4. The empirical results of a stochastic frontier model highlighted that the overall average of technical efficiency in both periods is relative low and labour intensive, which can potentially reduce their output contribution. The technical inefficiency effects model revealed that firm size, firm age, skilled labour, location in a municipal and Bangkok areas, type of manufacturing ownerships, cooperatives, foreign investment and exports {{are likely to be}} important firm-specific factor to the technical efficiency. Therefore, specific policy implications to improve the technical efficiency are greater access to financial services, credit <b>facilities,</b> <b>equity</b> in terms of the political operation, educational system, extensive infrastructural development, and technological upgrading, marketing and management...|$|R
40|$|Bureaucracy reform demands bring {{information}} technology {{to take part}} in government, especially in public service innovation. Bureaucracy reform is done through E-Government policy, in this case public service innovation is done by online system. Department of Investment and Integrated Services One Door Kabupaten Boyolali has implemented online licensing which is also part of ¬E-Government. However, in its application there are some barriers that is in the citizens participation. Facts found that citizens participation to use online permissions are very low. The research method used in this research is mix method approach with data collection technique through the questionnaire and interview, also document study. Respondents in this study are people who take care of licensing and informants of this study are people who work in Section of Information and Documentation Division of Investment and Integrated Service Department One Door Boyolali District. The result of the research shows that the factors that influence the low of public participation in using the online permission are the knowledge of the society about the low of the socialization in online licensing, the ability of the community to use the supporting facilities / infrastructures which are not yet optimal, the quality of the internet network is inadequate in some areas, Low online services, and awareness of people who want change but not in line with the attitude {{of people who want to}} use online licensing. Recommendations that can be given to the implementation of E-Government as an innovation of public services in encouraging licensing services in Boyolali District is the Department of Investment and Integrated Services One Door Boyolali District as the party that implements online permissions in order to give socialization back evenly with methods that are easily accepted by citizens.

40|$|The freeze-thaw/evaporation (FTE{reg_sign}) process treats {{oil and gas}} {{produced}} water so that the water can be beneficially used. The FTE{reg_sign} process is the coupling of evaporation and freeze-crystallization, and in climates where subfreezing temperatures seasonally occur, this coupling improves process economics compared to evaporation alone. An added benefit of the process is that water of a quality suited {{for a variety of}} beneficial uses is produced. The evolution, from concept to successful commercial deployment, of the FTE{reg_sign} process for the treatment of natural gas {{produced water}} has now been completed. In this document, the histories of two individual commercial deployments of the FTE{reg_sign} process are discussed. In Wyoming, as in many other states, the permitting and regulation of oil and gas produced water disposal and/or treatment facilities depend upon the legal relationship between owners of the facility and the owners of wells from which the water is produced. An ''owner-operated'' facility is regulated by the Wyoming Oil and Gas Conservation Commission (WOGCC) and is defined as an entity which only processes water which comes from the wells in fields of which they have an equity interest. However, if a facility processes water from wells in which the owners of the <b>facility</b> have no <b>equity</b> interest, the <b>facility</b> is considered a ''commercial'' facility and is permitted and regulated by the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality. For this reason, of the two commercial FTE{reg_sign} process deployments discussed in this document, one is related to an ''owner-operated'' facility, and the other relates to a ''commercial'' facility. Case 1 summarizes the permitting, design, construction, operation, and performance of the FTE{reg_sign} process at an ''owner-operated'' facility located in the Jonah Field of southwestern Wyoming. This facility was originally owned by the McMurry Oil Company and was later purchased by the Alberta Energy Company (now EnCana). Case 2 summarizes the permitting, design, construction, operation, and performance at a ''commercial'' FTE{reg_sign} facility located in the Great Divide Basin of south central Wyoming. Permits required for the construction and operation of each facility are described in detail. The respective qualities of each feed water, treated water, and concentrate stream are presented along with the relative yields of treated water and concentrate at each facility. Treated water from the owner-operated facility has been beneficially used in drilling and dust abatement, and treated water from the commercial facility has been used for dust abatement, construction, and land application. The permitting requirements and evaluation of beneficial use of the water at each facility are discussed. The results of this research confirm that the FTE{reg_sign} process is economic at a commercial-scale for the treatment and disposal of natural gas produced water in Wyoming. Further, the treated water produced from the process is of a quality suitable for beneficial uses such as irrigation, drilling mix, wildlife or livestock watering, and/or dust abatement on local roads...|$|R
