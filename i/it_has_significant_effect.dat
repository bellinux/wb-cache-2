25|$|VIL {{can be used}} to {{estimate}} the potential for downburst, too. A convective downdraft is linked to three forces in the vertical, namely perturbation pressure gradient force, buoyancy force and precipitation loading. The pressure gradient force was neglected as <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>significant</b> <b>effect</b> only on the updraft in supercells. With this assumption and other simplifications (e.g. requiring the environment of the air parcel to be static on the time scale of the downdraft). The resulting momentum equation is integrated over height to yield the kinetic energy of the parcel on descending to the surface and is found to be the negative CAPE of a dry air parcel injected into the storm, plus de motion of the convective cell. S. R. Stewart, from NWS, has published in 1991 an equation relating VIL and the echo tops that give the potential for surface gust using this concept. This is a predictive result that gives a certain lead time. With the Doppler velocity data, the meteorologist can see the downdraft and gust fronts happening, but since this a small scale feature, detection algorithms have been developed to point convergence and divergence areas under a thunderstorm on the radar display.|$|E

40|$|Fundamental frequency, or F 0 is {{critical}} for high quality speech synthesis in HMM based speech synthesis. Traditionally, F 0 values are considered to depend on a binary voicing decision such that they are continuous in voiced regions and undefined in unvoiced regions. Multi-space distribution HMM (MSDHMM) {{has been used for}} modelling the discontinuous F 0. Recently, a continuous F 0 modelling framework has been proposed and shown to be effective, where continuous F 0 observations are assumed to always exist and voicing labels are explicitly modelled by an independent stream. In this paper, a refined continuous F 0 modelling approach is proposed. Here, F 0 values are assumed to be dependent on voicing labels and both are jointly modelled in a single stream. Due to the enforced dependency, the new method can effectively reduce the voicing classification error. Subjective listening tests also demonstrate that the new approach can yield significant improvements on the naturalness of the synthesised speech.

In the estimated vector autoregressive models, we test its stability and find the short-run relationship between HR and EPU is unstable. As a result, a time-varying approach (bootstrap rolling window causality test) is utilized to revisit the dynamic causal link, and we find EPU has no impact on HR due to {{the stability of the}} real estate market in Germany. HR does not have significant effects on EPU in most time periods.
