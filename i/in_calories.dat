Though Hyderabadi haleem is the traditional hors d'oeuvre at weddings, celebrations and other social occasions, it is particularly consumed in the Islamic month of Ramadan during Iftar (the evening meal that breaks the day-long fast) as it provides instant energy and is high <b>in</b> <b>calories.</b> This has made the dish synonymous with Ramadan.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the {{factors contributing to}} the worldwide long-run rise in obesity {{and the effects of}} public interventions on its continued growth. The growth of obesity in a population results from an increase <b>in</b> <b>calorie</b> consumption relative to physical activity.

We consider the economic incentives that give rise to a growth in obesity by stimulating intake of calories while discouraging the expending of calories on physical activity. We argue that technological change provides a natural interpretation of the long-run growth in obesity despite a rise in dieting and exercise, that it predicts that the effect of income on obesity falls with economic development, and that it implies that the growth in obesity may be self-limiting. ...|$|R
25|$|Eighty {{percent of}} truckers have unhealthful eating {{patterns}} {{as a result}} of poor food choices and food availability at truck stops is partially to blame. The options at truck stops are generally high calorie and high fat foods available through restaurants, fast-food, diners and vending machines. Fresh produce and whole grain items are few and far between. Though 85% of mini-mart items are categorized as extremely unhealthy, 80% of these meals are considered a truck driver’s main meal of the day. Also, most of the foods carried by drivers in their trucks, whether or not stored in a refrigerator, are purchased from truck stops. Research suggests that drivers value quality and taste much more than nutrition when selecting food. Another issue is the pattern of extensive and irregular snacking while on the road and consumption of one large meal at the end of day. The daily meal is often high <b>in</b> <b>calories</b> and may be the highlight of the trucker’s day. Food intake varies during working hours compared to days off and truckers eat meals at the wrong circadian phase during the day.|$|E

40|$|In {{spite of}} India’s rapid {{economic}} growth, {{there has been}} a sustained decline <b>in</b> per capita <b>calorie</b> consumption during the last twenty-five years. While the decline has been largest among better-off households, it has taken place throughout the range of household per capita total expenditure. For both adults and children, anthropometric indicators of nutritional status in India are among the worst in the world. While these indicators have shown improvement over time, the rate of progress is slow relative to what might be expected based on international and historical experience. This paper presents the basic facts about growth, poverty and nutrition in India, it points to a number of puzzles, and it sketches a preliminary story that is consistent with the evidence. The reduction <b>in</b> <b>calorie</b> consumption cannot be attributed to declining real incomes, nor to any increase in the relative price of food. Our leading hypothesis, on which much work remains to be done, is that, as real incomes and wages have increased, leading to some nutritional improvement, {{there has been a}}n offsetting reduction <b>in</b> <b>calorie</b> requirements due to declining levels of physical activity and possibly also to various improvements in the health environment. If correct, this analysis does not imply that Indians are currently adequately nourished; {{nothing could be further from}} the truth. Calorie intake has serious limitations as a nutritional intake; while calories are extremely important, there are too many sources of variation <b>in</b> <b>calorie</b> requirements for standard, invariant, calorie-norms to be usefully applied to large sections of the population. We conclude with a plea for better, and more regular, monitoring of nutritional status in India. ...|$|R
