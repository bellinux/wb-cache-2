5|$|In the König-class ships, each gun turret had {{a working}} chamber beneath it that was {{connected}} to a revolving ammunition hoist leading down to the magazine below. The turrets were electrically controlled, though the guns were elevated hydraulically. In {{an effort to reduce}} the possibility of a fire, <b>everything</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> turret was constructed of steel. This layout was also used in the preceding battleships. On the Derfflinger-class battlecruisers, the two forward and the superfiring rear turret used this configuration, although the rearmost gun turret had its magazine and shell room inverted.|$|E
5|$|Priestley {{strongly}} {{suggested that}} there is no mind-body duality, and put forth a materialist philosophy in these works; that is, one founded on the principle that <b>everything</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> universe is made of matter that we can perceive. He also contended that discussing the soul is impossible because it is made of a divine substance, and humanity cannot perceive the divine. Despite his separation of the divine from the mortal, this position shocked and angered many of his readers, who believed that such a duality was necessary for the soul to exist.|$|E

5|$|The Red River {{flood of}} 1997 in the United States {{was a major}} flood that {{occurred}} in April 1997, along the Red River of the North in North Dakota and Minnesota. The flood reached throughout the Red River Valley, affecting the cities of Fargo and Winnipeg, while Grand Forks and East Grand Forks received the most damage, where floodwaters reached over 3miles (5km) inland, inundating virtually <b>everything</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> twin communities. Total damages for the Red River region were US$3.5 billion.|$|E
5|$|The medieval aristocratic {{household}} was not {{fixed to}} one location, {{but could be}} more or less permanently on the move. Greater nobles would have estates scattered over large geographical areas, and to maintain proper control of all their possessions it was important to physically inspect the localities on a regular basis. As the master of the horses, travel was the responsibility of the marshal. <b>Everything</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> noble household was designed for travel, so that the lord could enjoy the same luxury wherever he went.|$|E
5|$|These plugins {{are usually}} easy {{to install and}} can change almost <b>everything</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> game.

Organized projects, such as Tamriel Rebuilt and , attempt to recreate the originally envisioned Morrowind province and other parties of Tamriel, as seen in other The Elder Scrolls games. For example, there are interpretations of both Cyrodiil and Skyrim, the settings of later The Elder Scrolls games.|$|E

5|$|Later, in April 2003, No Doubt {{went into}} hiatus {{to take a}} break to spend time with their {{families}} before starting to compile <b>Everything</b> <b>in</b> Time; <b>The</b> Singles 1992–2003, a greatest hits album featuring songs from their previous studio albums; and Boom Box, a box set compiling <b>The</b> Singles 1992–2003, <b>Everything</b> <b>in</b> Time, <b>The</b> Videos 1992–2003 and Live <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Tragic Kingdom, which would all be released on the same date. The main reason to go into hiatus was that, in early 2003, lead singer Gwen Stefani started work on her 1980s-inspired new wave/dance-pop music side project, under which she released two solo albums: Love. Angel. Music. Baby. on November 22, 2004 and The Sweet Escape on December 4, 2006.|$|R
5|$|In 1929, Hammond married Dorothy Lister, the {{daughter}} of a Yorkshire textile merchant, in a highly publicised ceremony at a parish church in Bingley. They met at a cricket match in 1927 but spent little time together before the wedding, having little in common. When married, they rarely communicated or got on well. Acquaintances believed Hammond treated her badly, particularly once her father lost nearly <b>everything</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Depression, causing them financial worry. She remained loyal, but their relations gradually broke down, even after she sailed to South Africa, joining Hammond on tour in 1939 in an attempt to save the marriage. By that time, he was already seeing his future second wife, Sybil Ness-Harvey, a former beauty queen whom he had met while on tour.|$|E
5|$|In {{the case}} of '4 Minutes', Tim had a vision from the {{beginning}} of how things should go, especially sonically... When I opened up the session of '4 Minutes', there was so much going on that I knew right away that the hard part would be {{to make sure that the}} vocals would cut through and were right in the pocket. Beginning with working on the vocals was the only way to achieve this. After that I formed all the other parts around the vocals. The other challenge was to make sure that <b>everything</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> track sounded clear and that you could hear every instrument, every syllable, every breath. Also, I do almost always work linear in time on a track. It's easier, because when you're done, you're done. So I keep working on section after section, until I get to the end of the track and then I know the whole mix is pretty close.|$|E
5|$|Mulder goes {{to see the}} Shooter, despite Spender's objections. Mulder {{wants to}} give the Shooter {{immunity}} in exchange for testimony, which the Shooter refuses. Gibson proves his abilities {{to a group of}} clinicians while Scully and Fowley watch. The guard at the prison hands the Shooter a flattened Morley cigarette box that says he's a dead man. Scully visits the Lone Gunmen, wanting them to analyze the data from Gibson. She asks them who Diana is, and they tell her she worked closely with Mulder when he discovered the X-Files. The Smoking Man meets with Jeffrey in the FBI parking lot, but disappears when Mulder spots them talking. Scully and Mulder present to Skinner on Gibson, who displays extraordinary brain activities. Mulder believes that Gibson is the key to <b>everything</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> X-Files, and wants to make a deal with the Shooter. Diana and Skinner think this may result in adverse attention from the attorney general, and that the X-Files could be closed down if things go wrong, but Mulder dismisses that risk.|$|E

5|$|The City of Miami {{responded to}} the {{hurricane}} by downplaying its effects and turning down aid. The Miami Herald declared {{two weeks after the}} storm that almost <b>everything</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> city had returned to normal. The governor supported the efforts to minimize the appearance of the destruction by refusing to call a special legislative session to appropriate emergency funds for relief. As a result, the American Red Cross was able to collect only $3million of $5million needed. The 1926 hurricane effectively ended the land boom in Miami, despite the attempts at hiding the effects. It also forced drainage commissioners to re-evaluate the effectiveness of the canals. A $20million plan to build a dike around Lake Okeechobee, to be paid by property taxes, was turned down after a skeptical constituency sued to stop it; more than $14million had been spent on canals and they were ineffective in taking away excess water or delivering it when needed.|$|E

[...] He did however add that if Deep Purple were chosen as one of the inductees of Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, it would be out of the question to have Blackmore play with the band again due to it being [...] "disrespectful" [...] to the current lineup of the band.|$|R
25|$|Blavatsky {{connected}} {{this ancient}} wisdom religion to Hermetic philosophy, a worldview in which <b>everything</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> universe {{is identified as}} an emanation from a Godhead.

25|$|When this {{potential}} is realized, and the defilements have been eliminated, the Buddha-nature manifests as the Dharmakaya, the absolute reality which pervades <b>everything</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world.

When this understanding is idealized, it becomes a transcendental reality beneath the world of appearances.|$|E
