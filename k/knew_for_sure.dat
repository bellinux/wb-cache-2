500|$|To gain {{support of}} the parliament, Krukowiecki asked General Prądzyński to {{represent}} him during the joint session of the Sejm and Senate. His political plan was to end the uprising at all costs and return to status quo ante, with himself as the [...] "saviour of the fatherland" [...] who stopped further bloodshed. In his speech Prądzyński seriously inflated the Russian force, and also underestimated {{the strength of the}} Polish units. He also warned that the city's inhabitants would be massacred as in 1794 should fighting continue, and stated that the return to full independence under the sceptre of Nicholas was easily achievable, something he <b>knew</b> <b>for</b> <b>sure</b> was not true. He failed to convince his government and the Sejm that surrender was the only option, and a heated debate extended past the deadline of 13:00. The Russians resumed hostilities, and artillery from both sides started yet another duel.|$|E
500|$|In an {{effective}} change of pace, Harrison {{picked up his}} acoustic guitar, now alone on the stage save for Pete Ham on a second acoustic, and Don Nix's gospel choir, off to stage-left. The ensuing [...] "Here Comes the Sun" [...] – the first live performance of the song, as for Harrison's other Beatle compositions played that day – was also warmly received. At this point, Harrison switched back to his white Fender Stratocaster electric guitar and, as recounted to Anthony DeCurtis in 1987, {{he looked down at}} the setlist taped to the body of the guitar and saw the word [...] "Bob" [...] followed by a question mark. [...] "And I looked around," [...] Harrison recalled of Bob Dylan's entrance, [...] "and he was so nervous – he had his guitar on and his shades – he was sort of coming on, coming ... It was only at that moment that I <b>knew</b> <b>for</b> <b>sure</b> he was going to do it." [...] Among the audience, Schaffner wrote, there was [...] "total astonishment" [...] at this new arrival.|$|E

2500|$|Facing {{international}} condemnation for the attack, Ben-Gurion {{denied that}} the Israeli military was involved. In his memoir, Sharon wrote that the unit had checked all the houses before detonating the explosives and that he thought the houses were empty. Although he admitted the results were tragic, Sharon defended the attack, however: [...] "Now people could feel that the terrorist gangs would think twice before striking, now that they <b>knew</b> <b>for</b> <b>sure</b> they would be hit back.

In the book Along Came Mary: A Bad Girl Creek Novel (by writer Jo-Ann Mapson of the original bestseller Bad Girl Creek), character Mary Madigan details the extent of the impact that the Tad and Dixie love story has had on the people in her life: [...] "One thing I <b>knew</b> <b>for</b> <b>sure,</b> unless Mama had gotten a job, she was home, because it was time for All My Children. Both MayAnn and Mama had a king-size investment in Tad and Dixie's marriage, the one union on earth they considered unbreakable. It was the source of most of their bickering." ...|$|E
2500|$|Morton Sobell finally {{admitted}} in 2008 (after {{many years of}} denials) {{that he was a}} Soviet spy. He confirmed that Julius Rosenberg was [...] "in a conspiracy that delivered to the Soviets classified military and industrial information ... the atomic bomb", and that, [...] "He never told me about anything else that he was engaged in." [...] However, he stated that he thought the hand-drawn diagrams and other atomic-bomb details that were acquired by David Greenglass and passed to Julius were of [...] "little value" [...] to the Soviet Union, and were used only to corroborate what they had already learned from the other atomic spies. He also stated that he believed Ethel Rosenberg was aware of her husband's deeds, but took no part in them. In a subsequent letter to The New York Times, Sobell denied that he knew anything about Julius Rosenberg's alleged atomic espionage activities – that the only thing he <b>knew</b> <b>for</b> <b>sure</b> was what he himself did in association with Julius Rosenberg.|$|E

2500|$|Writing in 1801, McGready {{characterized}} the revivals {{of the previous}} summer and fall as “the most glorious time that our guilty eyes have ever beheld." [...] Less narrative and descriptive than McGee’s, McGready’s accounts focused on the chronological unfolding of events. [...] McGready’s Calvinist beliefs prevented him from pronouncing with certainty that a person had been converted; he believed that only God <b>knew</b> <b>for</b> <b>sure,</b> but he made attempts, judging by the evidence at hand, to count the conversions {{that began in the}} summer sacraments of 1800. [...] The numbers showed an accumulating and broadening effect: [...] In June at Red River, ten were converted; in July at Gasper River, 45, as well as some Tennessee youths who returned home and encouraged the experience of “real religion” among twenty of their friends and neighbors. [...] The Gasper River event hosted people from as distant as one hundred miles away. [...] Thirteen wagons were employed to transport people and supplies, and the excitement was so great that some stayed at the meeting house through the night. [...] In early August, on a Sunday church service at Red River, several black people and children were affected. [...] Later that month, twenty-two wagons arrived at the Muddy River sacrament with more than fifty converted throughout the multi-day observance.|$|E
2500|$|Pitted against Francis Shunk Brown, the {{candidate}} of Vare's Philadelphia machine, and Thomas Phillips, a former two-term congressman from western Pennsylvania, who was enthusiastically supported by the state's [...] "wet" [...] forces, Pinchot overcame a deficit of nearly 200,000 votes in traditionally Republican Philadelphia to pull into a 12,000-vote lead on election night. The 281,000 votes cast for former congressman Phillips, most of which came at Brown's expense, appeared to have given Pinchot a narrow victory in the primary. Brown's attorneys immediately challenged the results, contending that some 60,000 ballots in Luzerne County should be tossed out {{because they had been}} perforated beforehand by county election officials in an attempt to prevent fraud. The legal battle ensued throughout the summer and nobody <b>knew</b> <b>for</b> <b>sure</b> who the Republican candidate for governor would be, especially since both men periodically claimed to be the nominee. Ending four months of litigation and political turmoil on August 20, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, while castigating the Luzerne Common Pleas Court for marking (perforating) the ballots in the first place, upheld an earlier lower court ruling and declared that all 60,000 perforated ballots were valid, thereby certifying Pinchot as the winner of the May 20 Republican primary.|$|E

6000|$|... "Prove it? Why, yes, I think so, {{enough to}} make the truth plain to any {{reasonable}} man. I come from Peoria--was born and raised there. I went to school with Nell Warren. That was your wife's maiden name. She was a beautiful, gay girl. All the fellows were in love with her. I knew Bob Burton well. He was a splendid fellow, but wild. Nobody ever <b>knew</b> <b>for</b> <b>sure,</b> but we all supposed he was engaged to marry Nell. He left Peoria, however, and soon after that the truth about Nell came out. She ran away. It was {{at least a couple of}} months before Burton showed up in Peoria. He did not stay long. Then for years nothing was heard of either of them. When word did come Nell was in Oklahoma, Burton was in Denver. There's chance, of course, that Burton followed Nell and married her. That would account for Nell Warren taking the name of Burton. But it isn't likely. None of us ever heard of such a thing and wouldn't have believed it if we had. The affair seemed destined to end unfortunately. But Belding, while I'm at it, I want to say that Nell Warren was one of the sweetest, finest, truest girls in the world. If she drifted to the Southwest and kept her past a secret that was only natural. Certainly it should not be held against her. Why, she was only a child--a girl--seventeen--eighteen years old.... In a moment of amazement--when I recognized your wife as an old schoolmate--I blurted the thing out to Radford. You see now how little it matters to me when I ask your stepdaughter's hand in marriage for my son." ...|$|E
6000|$|This was how. You are {{to imagine}} a four-wheeled gig; one horse; {{in the front seat}} two Tahiti natives, in their Sunday clothes, blue coat, white shirt, kilt (a little longer than the Scotch) of a blue stuff with big white or yellow flowers, legs and feet bare; in the back seat me and my wife, who is a friend of yours; under our feet, plenty of lunch and things: among us a great deal of fun in broken Tahitian, one of the natives, the sub-chief of the village, being a great ally of mine. Indeed we have {{exchanged}} names; so that he is now called Rui, the nearest they can come to Louis, for they have no L and no S in their language. Rui is six feet three in his stockings, and a magnificent man. We all have straw hats, for the sun is strong. We drive between the sea, which makes a great noise, and the mountains; the road is cut through a forest mostly of fruit trees, the very creepers, which take the place of our ivy, heavy with a great and delicious fruit, bigger than your head and far nicer, called Barbedine. Presently we came to a house in a pretty garden, quite by itself, very nicely kept, the doors and windows open, no one about, and no noise but that of the sea. It looked like a house in a fairy-tale, and just beyond we must ford a river, and there we saw the inhabitants. Just in the mouth of the river, where it met the sea waves, they were ducking and bathing and screaming together like a covey of birds: seven or eight little naked brown boys and girls as happy as the day was long; and {{on the banks of the}} stream beside them, real toys - toy ships, full rigged, and with their sails set, though they were lying in the dust on their beam ends. And then I <b>knew</b> <b>for</b> <b>sure</b> they were all children in a fairy-story, living alone together in that lonely house with the only toys in all the island; and that I had myself driven, in my four-wheeled gig, into a corner of the fairy-story, and the question was, should I get out again? But it was all right; I guess only one of the wheels of the gig had got into the fairy-story; and the next jolt the whole thing vanished, and we drove on in our sea-side forest as before, and I have the honour to be Tomarcher's valued correspondent, TERIITEPA, which he was previously known as ...|$|E
