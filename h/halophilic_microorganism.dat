The collection and analysis of soil and mineral samples will inevitably be a part of future manned missions to Mars. Hypersaline environments surrounding MDRS will be characterized using measurements of pH, salinity, temperature and moisture content (soil samples). Initial analysis of biological samples will involve separation and purification of colonies from the raw sample. Cultured samples will be shipped offsite for additional isolation, purification and identification. Aerial photographs of the sites taken by the Aerial Recon Vehicle ‘Red Flyer ’ will be compared for <b>halophilic</b> <b>microorganism</b> density and diversity to determine if aerial identification is feasible.

Our long term objective is to expand the possibility of PHA production by other extreme halophiles consuming vinasse. Thus the specific questions to be answered in this study were: can the methods developed be applied {{for the production of}} biopolymers other than PHB? Is the product obtained of high purity? Is reasonable yield and productivity achieved? Although the family Halobacteriaceae includes 30 genera, currently, only a few haloarchaeal strains belonging to the genera Haloferax, Haloarcula, Haloquadratum, Haloterrigena, Halorhabdus, Halobiforma and Halopiger are found to accumulate PHAs. Haloferax mediterranei is so far the best PHA producer of the family Halobacteriaceae. The genes, molecular basis and functional genomics of PHA synthesis by H. mediterranei and related archaea were studied by Xiang’s research group (Liu et al. [2011] and relevant references therein). Therefore, it was our objective to cultivate H. mediterranei in vinasse, isolate the polymer and study its properties.|$|E
40|$|A novel core {{structure}} among bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) {{that belong to}} the genus Halomonas has been characterized. H. stevensii is a moderately <b>halophilic</b> <b>microorganism,</b> as are {{the majority of the}} Halomonadaceae. It brought to light the pathogenic potential of this genus.

Carotenoid pigments are recognized target biomarkers, and as they are highly active in Raman spectroscopy, they can be readily used to characterize the capabilities of space representative instrumentation. As part of the preparatory work being performed for the ExoMars mission, a gypsum crust colonized by microorganisms was interrogated with commercial portable Raman instruments and a flight representative Raman laser spectrometer. Four separate layers, each exhibiting different coloration resulting from specific <b>halophilic</b> <b>microorganism</b> activities within the gypsum crust, were studied by using two excitation wavelengths: 532 and 785 [*]nm.

Hence, the biotechnological application of these microorganisms can cover many aspects, such as the treatment of hypersaline waste streams of different origin. Due to the fact that the high osmotic pressure of hypersaline environments reduces the risk of contamination, the capacity for cost-effective non-sterile cultivation can make extreme <b>halophilic</b> <b>microorganisms</b> potentially valuable organisms for biotechnological applications. In this contribution, the stepwise use of screening approaches, employing design of experiment (DoE) on model media and subsequently using industrial waste as substrate have been implemented to investigate the applicability of halophiles to generate PHB from the industrial waste stream spent sulfite liquor (SSL). The production of PHB on model media as well as dilutions of industrial substrate in a complex medium has been screened for by fluorescence microscopy using Nile Blue staining. Screening was used to investigate the ability of <b>halophilic</b> <b>microorganisms</b> to withstand the inhibiting substances of the waste stream without negatively affecting PHB production. It could be shown that neither single inhibiting substances nor a mixture thereof inhibited growth in the investigated range, hence, leaving the question on the inhibiting mechanisms open.

In a previous study, using a genome-scale metabolic model, {{we have shown}} that the archaeon unexpectedly degrades essential amino acids under aerobic conditions, a behavior that can lead to the termination of growth earlier than necessary. Here, we further integratively investigate energy generation, nutrient utilization, and biomass production using an extended methodology that accounts for dynamically changing transport patterns, including those that arise from interactions among the supplied metabolites. Moreover, we widen the scope of our analysis to include phototrophic conditions to explore the interplay between different bioenergetic modes. Surprisingly, we found that cells also degrade essential amino acids even during phototropy, when energy should already be abundant. We also found that under both conditions considerable amounts of nutrients that were taken up were neither incorporated into the biomass nor used as respiratory substrates, implying the considerable production and accumulation of several metabolites in the medium. Some of these are likely the products of forms of overflow metabolism. In addition, our results also show that arginine fermentation, contrary to what is typically assumed, occurs simultaneously with respiration and photosynthesis and can contribute energy in levels that are comparable to the primary bioenergetic modes, if not more.

In order to identify genes of potential importance in nitrogen metabolism and its regulation in the <b>halophilic</b> <b>microorganism,</b> we have analysed its global gene expression in three culture media with different nitrogen sources: (a) cells were grown stationary and exponentially in ammonium, (b) cells were grown exponentially in nitrate, and (c) cells were shifted to nitrogen starvation conditions. The main differences in the transcriptional profiles have been identified between the cultures with ammonium as nitrogen source and the cultures with nitrate or nitrogen starvation, supporting previous results which indicate the absence of ammonium as the factor responsible for the expression of genes involved in nitrate assimilation pathway. The results have also permitted the identification of transcriptional regulators and changes in metabolic pathways related to the catabolism and anabolism of amino acids or nucleotides.

40|$|Salinibacter ruber is an {{extremely}} halophilic bacterium, phylogenetically affiliated with the Flavobacterium/Cytophaga branch of the domain Bacteria. Electrospray mass analyses (negative ion) of the total lipid extract of a pure culture of S. ruber shows a characteristic peak at m/z 660 as the most prominent peak in the high-mass range of the spectrum. A novel sulfonolipid, giving rise to the molecular ion [M-H]− of m/z 660, has been identified. The sulfonolipid isolated and purified by thin-layer chromatography was shown by chemical degradation, mass spectrometry, infrared spectroscopy, and nuclear magnetic resonance analysis to have the structure 2 -carboxy- 2 -amino- 3 -O-(13 ′-methyltetradecanoyl) - 4 -hydroxy- 18 -methylnonadec- 5 -ene- 1 -sulfonic acid. This lipid represents about 10 % of total cellular lipids, and {{it appears to be}} a structural variant of the sulfonolipids found as main components of the cell envelope of gliding bacteria of the genus Cytophaga and closely related genera (W.

Altogether we obtained 36 haloarchaeal virus isolates and 36 archaeal strains, significantly increasing the number of known archaeal virus isolates.

We found some differences in the characteristics of HMG R and in its regulation by different environmental salinities in H. werneckii when compared to the mesophilic baker’s yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Our results suggest that halophilic black yeast regulates sterol biosynthesis through HMG R in a different way than mesophiles, which might be a consequence of the different ecophysiology of halophilic black yeasts. From this perspective, H. werneckii is an interesting novel model organism for studies on salt stress-responsive proteins as well as o...|$|R
40|$|Salting of fish is a {{traditional}} method for fish preservation which reduces corruption, increase shelf life and is used {{in order to have}} an access to the new markets. In some countries, consuming semi-cooked or raw salted and smoked fish is well-liked. Due to the presence of <b>halophilic</b> <b>microorganisms</b> in salted fish, occurrence of food-borne infections is probable. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the antimicrobial activity of NaCl on Staphlococcus aureus and Listeria monocytogenes in salted silver carp. Effect of different concentrations of NaCl (4, 8, 12 %) on behavior of Staphlococcus aureus and Listeria monocytogenes in 10 ˚C during 3 weeks (0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21 days) was determined by evaluation of the bacterial growth in salted fish fillets. Statistical analysis showed that application of different concentrations of NaCl had significant inhibitory effect on the growth of S. aureus and L. monocytogenes in salted fish fillets compared to control group (...|$|R
40|$|Micro {{organisms that}} grow in {{habitats}} characterized by {{high or low}} temperatures, acidic or alkaline pHs, high salt concentrations and high pressures have been termed extremophiles. The <b>halophilic</b> <b>microorganisms</b> are a group of extremophiles {{that are able to}} grow in the presence of NaCl. For isolation of moderately halophilic bacteria, specimens were collected from sea water (Persian Gulf) and different parts of tannery factory. Samples were enriched in specific medium for halophils, and bacteria were purred with streak plate method and were identified. To investigate the effects of various temperatures and various pH on their growth, drop plate method and microtitre plate method were used. In this study, 8 bacteria from different parts of tannery factory and 8 bacteria from Persian Gulf were isolated. Phenotypic and biotipic studies were accomplished the collected bacteria. Results indicated that, the best temperature for tannery factory and Persian Gulf isolates were 28 C and 37 C respectively. Optimum pH for tannery factory and Persian Gulf isolates was 7. 2...|$|R
