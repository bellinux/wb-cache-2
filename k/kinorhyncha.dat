40|$|SYNOPSIS. The article {{summarizes}} current knowledge mainly {{about the}} (functional) morphology and ul-trastructure, {{but also about}} the biology, development, and evolution of the <b>Kinorhyncha.</b> The <b>Kinorhyncha</b> are microscopic, bilaterally symmetrical, exclusively free-living, benthic, marine animals and ecologically part of the meiofauna. They occur throughout the world from the intertidal to the deep sea, generally in sediments but sometimes associated with plants or other animals. From adult stages 141 species are known, but 38 species have been described from juvenile stages. The trunk is arranged into 11 segments as evidenced by cuticular plates, sensory spots, setae or spines, nervous system, musculature, and subcuticular glands. The ultrastructure of several organ systems and the postembryonic development are known for very few species. Almost no data are available about the embryology and only a single gene has been sequenced for a single species. The phylogenetic relationships within <b>Kinorhyncha</b> are unresolved. Priapulida, Loricifera, and <b>Kinorhyncha</b> are grouped together as Scalidophora, but arguments are found for every possible sister-group relationship within this taxon. The recently published Ecdysozoa hypothesis suggests a closer rela-tionship of the Scalidophora, Nematoda, Nematomorpha, Tardigrada, Onychophora, and Arthropoda...|$|E
40|$|The {{phylogeny}} of <b>Kinorhyncha</b> {{was analyzed}} using morphology and the molecular loci 18 S rRNA and 28 S rRNA. The different datasets were analyzed separately and in combina-tion, using maximum likelihood and Bayesian Inference. Bayesian inference of molecular sequence data {{in combination with}} morphology supported the division of <b>Kinorhyncha</b> into two major clades: Cyclorhagida comb. nov. and Allomalorhagida nom. nov. The latter clade represents a new kinorhynch class, and accommodates Dracoderes, Franciscideres, a yet undescribed genus which is closely related with Franciscideres, and the traditional homalor-hagid genera. Homalorhagid monophyly was not supported by any analyses with molecular sequence data included. Analysis of the combined molecular and morphological data fur-thermore supported a cyclorhagid clade which included all traditional cyclorhagid taxa, except Dracoderes that no longer {{should be considered a}} cyclorhagid genus. Accordingly, Cyclorhagida is divided into three main lineages: Echinoderidae, Campyloderidae, and a large clade, ‘Kentrorhagata’, which except for species of Campyloderes, includes all spe-cies with a midterminal spine present in adult individuals.

40|$|The Wagner and Consag Basins, in the {{northern}} end of the Gulf of California are characterized by active CO 2 gas vents. This venting activity causes a decrease in the pore water pH compared to other marine environments and the acidification of the bottom water is expected to affect the organisms that inhabit the sediments. In this study, we present the first records of four genera and ten “working species” of the phylum <b>Kinorhyncha</b> in Mexico. We also analyzed their horizontal and vertical distribution. Samples were collected at 40 soft bottom sites on board of the R/V “El Puma” (WAGNER- 02 Expedition) during July-August 2010 with a Smith McIntyre grab and a syringe corer. At each station physicochemical variables were measured including pore water pH. In this study, <b>Kinorhyncha</b> represented 2. 64 % of the total meiofauna and it ranked fourth in dominance after Nematoda, Copepoda, and Polychaeta. Kinorhynchs densities ranged from zero to 24. 05 ind. 10 cm- 2. We encountered a total of two families, four genera and ten “working species” of kinorhynchs. The family Pycnophyidae was represented by two genera Pycnophyes (two “working species”) and Kinorhynchus (five ”working species”) and the family Echinoderidae, two “working species” of the genus Echinoderes and one “working specie” of Fissuroderes were present. Kinorhynchs were mainly concentrated in the upper layers, with about 84 % of the individuals present in the first four centimeters.

40|$|SUMMARY The {{fossil record}} {{provides}} {{a paucity of}} data {{on the development of}} extinct organisms, particularly for their embryology. The recovery of fossilized embryos heralds new insight into the evolution of development but advances are limited by an almost complete absence of phylogenetic constraint. Markuelia is an exception to this, known from cleavage and pre-hatchling stages as a vermiform and profusely annulated direct-developing bilaterian with terminal circumoral and posterior radial arrays of spines. Phylogenetic analyses have hitherto suggested assignment to stem-Scalidophora (phyla <b>Kinorhyncha,</b> Loricifera, Priapulida). We test this assumption with additional data and through the inclusion of additional taxa. The available evidence supports stem-Scalidophora affinity, leading to the conclusion that sca-lidophorans, cyclonerualians, and ecdysozoans are primitive direct developers, and the likelihood that scalidophorans are primitively metameric...|$|E
40|$|A major {{turning point}} in the study of {{metazoan}} evolution was the recognition of the existence of the Ecdysozoa in 1997. This is a group of eight animal phyla (Nematoda, Nematomorpha, Loricifera, <b>Kinorhyncha,</b> Priapulida, Tardigrada, Onychophora and Arthropoda). Ecdysozoa is the most specious clade of animals to ever exist and the relationships among its eight phyla are still heatedly debated. Similarly also the relationships among the three sub-phyla (Chelicerata, Pancrustacea and Myriapoda) within the most important ecdysozoan phylum (the Arthropoda) are still debated. Indeed, the two major problems in ecdysozoan phylogeny refer to the relationships of Myriapoda within Arthropoda, and of Tardigrada within Ecdysozoa. Difficulties in ecdysozoan relationships resides in lineages characterized by rapid, deep divergences and subsequently long periods of divergent evolution. Phylogenetic signal to resolve the relationships of these lineages is diluted, increasing the likelihood of recovery of phylogenetic artifacts. In an attempt to resolve the relationships within Ecdysozoa, consilience of three independent phylogenetic data sets was investigated. EST and rRNA and microRNA (miRNA) data were sampled across all major ecdysozoan phyla. In particular, a major contribution of this thesis is the first time sequencing of miRNAs for all the panarthropod phyla. MicroRNAs are genome regulatory elements that recently emerged as a source of useful phylogenetic data (Sempere et al. 2006) because of their low homoplasy levels. The considered data sets were analysed under phylogenetic methods and models, implemented to minimize the occurrence of phylogenetic reconstruction artifacts to understand the evolution of Ecdysozoa. Analyses of independent data types recovered well supported and corroborating evidence for the monophyly of Panarthropoda (Arthropoda, Onychophora and Tardigrada), a sister group relationships between Myriapoda and Pancrustacea within Arthropoda, and the paraphyly of Cycloneuralia (Nematoda, Nematomorpha, Loricifera, <b>Kinorhyncha</b> and Priapulida). ...|$|E
40|$|Many {{features}} of mitochondrial genomes of animals, such as patterns of gene arrangement, nucleotide content and substitution rate variation are extensively used in evolutionary and phylogenetic studies. Nearly 6, 000 mitochondrial genomes of animals {{have already been}} sequenced, covering the majority of animal phyla. One of the groups that escaped mitogenome sequencing is phylum Kinorhyncha-an isolated taxon of microscopic worm-like ecdysozoans. The kinorhynchs {{are thought to be}} one of the early-branching lineages of Ecdysozoa, and their mitochondrial genomes may be important for resolving evolutionary relations between major animal taxa. Here we present the results of sequencing and analysis of mitochondrial genomes from two members of <b>Kinorhyncha,</b> Echinoderes svetlanae (Cyclorhagida) and Pycnophyes kielensis (Allomalorhagida). Their mitochondrial genomes are circular molecules approximately 15 Kbp in size. The kinorhynch mitochondrial gene sequences are highly divergent, which precludes accurate phylogenetic inference. The mitogenomes of both species encode a typical metazoan complement of 37 genes, which are all positioned on the major strand, but the gene order is distinct and unique among Ecdysozoa or animals as a whole. We predict four types of start codons for protein-coding genes in E. svetlanae and five in P. kielensis with a consensus DTD in single letter code. The mitochondrial genomes of E. svetlanae and P. kielensis encode duplicated methionine tRNA genes that display compensatory nucleotide substitutions. Two distant species of <b>Kinorhyncha</b> demonstrate similar patterns of gene arrangements in their mitogenomes. Both genomes have duplicated methionine tRNA genes; the duplication predates the divergence of two species. The kinorhynchs share a few features pertaining to gene order that align them with Priapulida. Gene order analysis reveals that gene arrangement specific of Priapulida may be ancestral for Scalidophora, Ecdysozoa, and even Protostomia...|$|E
