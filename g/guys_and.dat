5|$|Following World War II, Cy Feuer and Ernie Martin started {{producing}} musicals together.

Steinbeck suggested that he write a sequel to Cannery Row that would feature the characters attractive to Feuer and Martin. Based on suggestions for the story line by Feuer and Martin, Steinbeck began to write Sweet Thursday.|$|E

Upon meeting each other at the recording studio, the actors, who at the time both co-starred in <b>Guys</b> <b>and</b> Dolls, were asked to record together as hyenas.

For the hyenas, the original intention was to reunite Cheech & Chong, but while Cheech Marin accepted to play Banzai, Tommy Chong was unavailable. Thus his role was changed into a female hyena, Shenzi, who was voiced by Whoopi Goldberg.|$|E
