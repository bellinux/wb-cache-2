I {{was forced}} to, when my {{national}} swimming team {{did not win}} any medals {{in contrast with the}} success of the US and Australian athletes. Just before the competition, all seemed ready to compete and win. Only a few of the competitors were wearing headphones and listening to music. "Why were they not all in equal condition?" my daughter questioned, "It's not fair!" Previously published research (J Nurs Res. 2003 Sep; 11 (3) : 209 - 16) showed that in humans, music makes saturation of oxyhemoglobin (SPO(2)) significantly higher (compared with control subjects not receiving music therapy, p< 0. 01), and {{that as a result of}} music therapy the level of oxygen saturation returns to the baseline faster compared to the control subjects receiving no music, p< 0. 01), making it hard to detect the transient oxygen saturation shortly thereafter. The statistically significant higher SPO(2) level indicates the "enhancement of oxygen transfer" and implies that "music by the pool" is prohibited by The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) in competition blood-doping method of "the use of products that enhance the uptake, transport or delivery of oxygen", apparently conflicting with the essence of olympism, and WADA calls for "ethics, fair play and honestly".
