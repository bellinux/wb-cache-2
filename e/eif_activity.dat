40|$|Abstract Background Inhibitors of the kinase mTOR, such as rapamycin and everolimus, {{have been}} used as cancer {{therapeutics}} with limited success since some tumours are resistant. Efforts to establish predictive markers to allow selection of patients with tumours likely to respond have centred on determining phosphorylation states of mTOR or its targets 4 E-BP 1 and S 6 K in cancer cells. In an alternative approach we estimated <b>eIF</b> 4 E <b>activity,</b> a key effector of mTOR function, and tested the hypothesis that <b>eIF</b> 4 E <b>activity</b> predicts sensitivity to mTOR inhibition in cell lines and in breast tumours. Results We found a greater than three fold difference in sensitivity of representative colon, lung and breast cell lines to rapamycin. Using an assay to quantify influences of eIF 4 E on the translational efficiency specified by structured 5 'UTRs, we showed that this estimate of <b>eIF</b> 4 E <b>activity</b> {{was a significant predictor of}} rapamycin sensitivity, with higher <b>eIF</b> 4 E <b>activities</b> indicative of enhanced sensitivity. Surprisingly, non-transformed cell lines were not less sensitive to rapamycin and did not have lower <b>eIF</b> 4 E <b>activities</b> than cancer lines, suggesting the mTOR/ 4 E-BP 1 /eIF 4 E axis is deregulated in these non-transformed cells. In the context of clinical breast cancers, we estimated <b>eIF</b> 4 E <b>activity</b> by analysing expression of eIF 4 E and its functional regulators within tumour cells and combining these scores to reflect inhibitory and activating influences on eIF 4 E. Estimates of <b>eIF</b> 4 E <b>activity</b> in cancer biopsies taken at diagnosis did not predict sensitivity to 11 - 14 days of pre-operative everolimus treatment, as assessed by change in tumour cell proliferation from diagnosis to surgical excision. However, higher pre-treatment <b>eIF</b> 4 E <b>activity</b> was significantly associated with dramatic post-treatment changes in expression of eIF 4 E and 4 E-binding proteins, suggesting that eIF 4 E is further deregulated in these tumours in response to mTOR inhibition. Conclusions Estimates of <b>eIF</b> 4 E <b>activity</b> predict sensitivity to mTOR inhibition in cell lines but breast tumours with high estimated <b>eIF</b> 4 E <b>activity</b> gain changes in eIF 4 E regulation in order to enhance resistance. </p...|$|R
40|$|The energetically {{demanding}} {{process of}} translation {{is linked to}} multiple signaling events through mTOR-mediated regulation of eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 4 F complex assembly. Disrupting mTOR constraints on <b>eIF</b> 4 F <b>activity</b> can be oncogenic and alter chemotherapy response, making eIF 4 F an attractive antineoplastic target. Here, we combine a newly developed inducible RNAi platform and pharmacological targeting of <b>eIF</b> 4 F <b>activity</b> to define a critical role for endogenous eIF 4 F in Myc-dependent tumor initiation. We find elevated Myc levels are associated with deregulated <b>eIF</b> 4 F <b>activity</b> in the prelymphomatous stage of the Eμ-Myc lymphoma model. Inhibition of eIF 4 F is synthetic lethal with elevated Myc in premalignant pre-B/B cells resulting in reduced numbers of cycling pre-B/B cells and delayed tumor onset. At the organismal level, eIF 4 F suppression affected a subset of normal regenerating cells, but this was well tolerated and rapidly and completely reversible. Therefore, eIF 4 F is a key Myc client that represents a tumor-specific vulnerability...|$|R

The {{first step of}} cap-dependent translation is mediated by the mRNA cap-binding protein eukaryotic initiation factor 4 E (eIF 4 E). Although involved in translating nearly all cellular transcripts, mRNAs vary widely in their translational response to <b>eIF</b> 4 E <b>activity</b> changes. Prior studies of mRNA structure revealed several features governing eIF 4 E responsiveness; however, most of this knowledge is based on comparison of two levels of <b>eIF</b> 4 E <b>activity</b> with unclear physiological relevance. To identify mRNA structural features that govern genome-wide ribosome recruitment across {{a full range of}} physiological <b>eIF</b> 4 E <b>activities,</b> we precisely modulated <b>eIF</b> 4 E <b>activity</b> using an <b>eIF</b> 4 E-inducible system together with 4 Ei- 1, an inhibitor of the eIF 4 E- 5 'mRNA cap association. We identified genes that were more (4 E hypersensitive) or less (4 E hyposensitive) responsive to <b>eIF</b> 4 E <b>activity</b> changes than average. Distinct characteristics associated with each class: 4 E hypersensitive genes had longer 5 'UTRs with higher GC content, longer 3 'UTRs with lower GC content; more AU-rich elements and a higher density of unique microRNA targets sites than typical genes. Importantly, these structural characteristics predicted the translational response across the dose range of 4 Ei- 1. Gene ontology analysis showed an association between 4 E hypersensitive genes and proliferation; and cell cycle experiments with 4 Ei- 1 validated this result. A search for the outcome and mechanism of this proliferative gene activation in a physiological setting revealed that abrupt gain of eIF 4 E function in quiescent cells first triggers G 0 exit and then cell cycle transit at least partially by increasing ribosome recruitment to cyclins C and D 1. Whereas cyclin C is not necessary for this effect; cyclin D 1 is indispensable, although not sufficient. Our findings provide important insights into mRNA properties of eIF 4 E-modulated translational control...|$|R
40|$|Increased {{eukaryotic}} translation {{initiation factor}} 4 E (eIF 4 E) expression occurs in many cancers, and makes fundamental contributions to carcinogenesis by stimulating {{the expression of}} cancer-related genes at post-transcriptional levels. This key role is highlighted by the facts that eIF 4 E levels can predict prognosis, and that eIF 4 E is an established therapeutic target. However, <b>eIF</b> 4 E <b>activity</b> is a complex function of expression levels and phosphorylation statuses of eIF 4 E and eIF 4 E-binding proteins (4 E-BPs). Our hypothesis was that the combined analyses of these pathway components would allow insights into <b>eIF</b> 4 E <b>activity</b> and its influence on cancer. We have determined expression levels of eIF 4 E, 4 E-BP 1, 4 E-BP 2 and phosphorylated 4 E-BP 1 within 424 breast tumours, and have carried out analyses to combine these and relate the product to patient survival, in order to estimate <b>eIF</b> 4 E <b>activity.</b> We show that this analysis gives greater prognostic insights than that of eIF 4 E alone. We show that eIF 4 E and 4 E-BP expression are positively associated, and that 4 E-BP 2 has a stronger influence on cancer behaviour than 4 E-BP 1. Finally, we examine eIF 4 E, estimated <b>eIF</b> 4 E <b>activity,</b> and phosphorylated 4 E-BP 1 as potential predictive biomarkers for eIF 4 E-targeted therapies, and show that each determines selection of different patient groups. We conclude that eIF 4 E's influence on cancer survival is modulated substantially by 4 E-BPs, and that combined pathway analyses can estimate functional eIF 4 E...|$|R

These affect bulk protein synthesis and thereby the levels of ER stress, but also culminate in regulated expression of specificmRNAs, such as that encoding the transcription factor ATF 4. Mechanisms linking eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF 2) phosphorylation to control of unfolded protein load in the ER were elucidated more than 10 years ago, but recent work has highlighted the diversity of processes that impinge on <b>eIF</b> 2 <b>activity</b> and revealed that there aremultiplemechanisms bywhich changes in <b>eIF</b> 2 <b>activity</b> canmodulate the translation of individual mRNAs. In addition, the potential for affecting this step of translation initiation pharmacologically is becoming clearer. Furthermore, {{it is now clear}} that another strand of the UPR, controlled by the endoribonuclease inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE 1), also affects rates of protein synthesis in stressed cells and that its effector function, mediated by the transcription factor X-box-binding protein 1 (XBP 1), is subject to important mRNA-specific translational regulation.

40|$|Eukaryotic {{initiation}} factor 2 B (eIF 2 B) is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) whose activity is both tightly regulated and rate-controlling {{with regard to}} global rates of protein synthesis. Skeletal muscle <b>eIF</b> 2 B <b>activity</b> and expression of its catalytic ε-subunit (eIF 2 Bε) have been implicated as potential contributors to the altered rates of protein synthesis {{in a number of}} physiological conditions and experimental models. The objective {{of this study was to}} directly examine the effects of exogenously expressed eIF 2 Bε in vivo on GEF activity and protein synthetic rates in rat skeletal muscle. A plasmid encoding FLAG-eIF 2 Bε was transfected into the tibialis anterior (TA) of one leg, while the contralateral TA received a control plasmid. Ectopic expression of eIF 2 Bε resulted in increased GEF activity in TA homogenates of healthy rats, demonstrating that the expressed protein was catalytically active. In an effort to restore a deficit in <b>eIF</b> 2 B <b>activity,</b> we utilized an established model of chronic sepsis in which skeletal muscle <b>eIF</b> 2 B <b>activity</b> is known to be impaired. Ectopic expression of eIF 2 Bε in the TA rescued the sepsis-induced deficit in GEF activity and muscle protein synthesis.

40|$|Childhood ataxia {{with central}} nervous system hypomyelination (CACH), or {{vanishing}} white matter leukoencephalopathy (VWM), is a fatal brain disorder caused by mutations in eukaryotic initiation factor 2 B (eIF 2 B). eIF 2 B is essential for protein synthesis and regulates translation in response to cellular stresses. We performed mutagenesis to introduce changes equivalent to 12 human CACH/VWM mutations in three subunits of the equivalent factor from yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and analyzed effects on cell growth, translation, and gene expression in response to stresses. None of the mutations is lethal or temperature sensitive, but almost all confer some defect in eIF 2 B function significant enough to alter growth or gene expression under normal or stress conditions. Biochemical analyses indicate that mutations analyzed in eIF 2 Bα and -ɛ reduce the steady-state level of the affected subunit, while the most severe mutant tested, eIF 2 BβV 341 D (human eIF 2 BβV 316 D), forms complexes with reduced stability and lower <b>eIF</b> 2 B <b>activity.</b> <b>eIF</b> 2 Bδ is excluded from eIF 2 BβV 341 D complexes. eIF 2 Bβv 341 D function can be rescued by overexpression of eIF 2 Bδ alone. Our findings imply CACH/VWM mutations do not specifically impair responses to eIF 2 phosphorylation, but instead cause protein structure defects that impair <b>eIF</b> 2 B <b>activity.</b> Altered protein folding is characteristic of other diseases, including cystic fibrosis and neurodegenerative disorders such as Huntington, Alzheimer's, and prion diseases...|$|R

Herein, we investigate the potential role of other initiation factors in this process and demonstrate that interfering with <b>eIF</b> 4 A <b>activity,</b> an RNA helicase required for the ribosome recruitment phase of translation initiation, induces SG formation and that this event is not dependent on eIF 2 α phosphorylation. We also show that inhibition of <b>eIF</b> 4 A <b>activity</b> does not impair the ability of eIF 2 α to be phosphorylated under stress conditions. Furthermore, we observed SG assembly upon inhibition of cap-dependent translation after poliovirus infection.

SUI 1 is an essential protein of 12. 3 kDa that is required in vivo for the initiation of protein synthesis. Here we present evidence that SUI 1 is identical to the smallest subunit, p 16, of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 (eIF- 3) in S. cerevisiae. SUI 1 and eIF 3 -p 16 comigrate upon sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and cross-react with anti-SUI 1 and anti-eIF 3 antisera. Anti-SUI 1 antisera immunoprecipitate all of the subunits of eIF 3, whereas antisera against the eIF 3 complex and the individual PRT 1 and GCD 10 subunits of eIF 3 immunoprecipitate SUI 1. Finally, the N-terminal amino acid sequence of a truncated form of eIF 3 -p 16 matches the sequence of SUI 1. eIF 3 isolated from a sui 1 (ts) strain at 37 degrees C lacks SUI 1 and fails to exhibit <b>eIF</b> 3 <b>activity</b> in the in vitro assay for methionyl-puromycin synthesis. A free form of SUI 1 separate from the eIF 3 complex is found in S. cerevisiae but lacks activity in the in vitro assay. The results, together with prior genetic experiments, indicate that SUI 1 is essential for <b>eIF</b> 3 <b>activity</b> and functions as part of eIF 3 and in concert with eIF 2 to promote eIF 2 -GTP-Met-tRNAi ternary complex recognition of the initiator codon...|$|R

40|$|Protein {{synthesis}} in rat H 35 Reuber hepatoma {{cells is}} rapidly inhibited on heat shock. At mild heat-shock temperatures {{the main cause}} for inhibition is the inactivation of the guanine nucleotide exchange factor eukaryotic initiation factor 2 B (eIF 2 B); under more severe heat-shock conditions the activity of several initiation factors is compromised. eIF 2 B is required for GDP/GTP exchange on eIF 2, which delivers methionyl-tRNA to the 40 S ribosomal subunit. We have tried to elucidate the mechanism underlying the inactivation of eIF 2 B by assays in vitro. Incubation of cell extracts at 41 degreesC or higher led to the inactivation of eIF 2 B. In agreement with observations in cells exposed to mild heat shocks, the thermal inactivation of eIF 2 B could be ascribed to neither eIF 2 alpha phosphorylation nor the induction of another inhibitor. With the use of glycerol gradients we show that eIF 2 B forms aggregates in heat-treated extracts. Furthermore <b>eIF</b> 2 B <b>activity</b> is protected against heat shock in thermotolerant cells.

40|$|The {{interaction}} between the poly(A) -binding protein (PABP) and eukaryotic translational initiation factor 4 G (eIF 4 G), which brings about circularization of the mRNA, stimulates translation. General RNA-binding proteins affect translation, but their role in mRNA circularization has not been studied before. Here, we demonstrate that the major mRNA ribonucleoprotein YB- 1 has a pivotal function in the regulation of <b>eIF</b> 4 F <b>activity</b> by PABP. In cell extracts, the addition of YB- 1 exacerbated the inhibition of 80 S ribosome initiation complex formation by PABP depletion. Rabbit reticulocyte lysate in which PABP weakly stimulates translation is rendered PABP-dependent after the addition of YB- 1. In this system, eIF 4 E binding to the cap structure is inhibited by YB- 1 and stimulated by a nonspecific RNA. Significantly, adding PABP back to the depleted lysate stimulated eIF 4 E binding to the cap structure more potently if this binding had been downregulated by YB- 1. Conversely, adding nonspecific RNA abrogated PABP stimulation of eIF 4 E binding. These data strongly suggest that competition between YB- 1 and eIF 4 G for mRNA binding is required for efficient stimulation of <b>eIF</b> 4 F <b>activity</b> by PABP...|$|R

40|$|Background: Male {{breast cancer}} is rare and {{treatment}} is {{based on data from}} females. High expression/activity of eukaryotic initiation factor 4 E (eIF 4 E) denotes a poor prognosis in female breast cancer, and the eIF 4 E pathway has been targeted therapeutically. <b>eIF</b> 4 E <b>activity</b> in female {{breast cancer is}} deregulated by eIF 4 E over-expression and by phosphorylation of its binding protein, 4 E-BP 1, which relieves inhibitory association between eIF 4 E and 4 E-BP 1. The relevance of the eIF 4 E pathway in male breast cancer is unknown. Methods: We have assessed expression levels of eIF 4 E, 4 E-BP 1, 4 E-BP 2 and phosphorylated 4 E-BP 1 (p 4 E-BP 1) using immunohistochemistry in a large cohort of male breast cancers (n= 337) and have examined correlations with prognostic factors and survival. Results: Neither eIF 4 E expression or estimated <b>eIF</b> 4 E <b>activity</b> were associated with prognosis. However, a highly significant correlation was found between p 4 E-BP 1 expression and disease-free survival, linking any detectable p 4 E-BP 1 with poor survival (univariate log rank p= 0. 001; multivariate HR 8. 8, p= 0. 0001). Conclusions: Our data provide no support for direct therapeutic targeting of eIF 4 E in male breast cancer, unlike in females.

However, eif 4 e is not required for Sxl mediated repression of msl- 2 mRNA translation. Instead, eif 4 e functions as a co-factor in Sxl-dependent female-specific alternative splicing of msl- 2 and also Sxl pre-mRNAs. Like other factors required for Sxl regulation of splicing, eif 4 e shows maternal-effect female-lethal interactions with Sxl.

In turn, a genomic survey through subtractive hybridization (PCR-select cDNA subtraction) was conducted {{in order to find}} gene(s) that {{may play a role in}} interactions between the virus and its host cells. Results Through this technique, we identified a novel eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5 A (eIF 5 A) which is upregulated in Aedes albopictus -derived C 6 / 36 cells infected by the type 2 dengue (Den- 2) virus. The full-length of the identified eIF 5 A gene consisted of 1498 bp of nucleotides with a 41. 39 % G+C content, and it possessed a higher similarity and shorter evolutionary distance with insects than with other organisms. Upregulation of eIF 5 A in response to Den- 2 virus infection was validated at both the RNA and protein levels. This phenomenon was also observed by confocal microscopy. In addition, cell death obviously occurred when <b>eIF</b> 5 A <b>activity</b> was inhibited in C 6 / 36 cells even when they were infected by the virus. However, viral multiplication was not obviously affected in infected C 6 / 36 cells when <b>eIF</b> 5 A <b>activity</b> was reduced.

40|$|This review {{identifies}} the various pathways responsible for modulating hepatic protein synthesis following acute and chronic alcohol intoxication and describes the mechanism(s) {{responsible for these}} changes. Alcohol intoxication induces a defect in global protein synthetic rates that is localized to impaired translation of mRNA {{at the level of}} peptide-chain initiation. Translation initiation is regulated at two steps: formation of the 43 S preinitiation complex [controlled by eukaryotic initiation factors 2 (eIF 2) and 2 B (eIF 2 B) ] and the binding of mRNA to the 40 S ribosome (controlled by the eIF 4 F complex). To date, alcohol-induced alterations in eIF 2 and eIF 2 B content and activity are best investigated. Ethanol decreases <b>eIF</b> 2 B <b>activity</b> when ingested either acutely or chronically. The reduced <b>eIF</b> 2 B <b>activity</b> most likely is a consequence of twofold increased phosphorylation of the α-subunit of eIF 2 on Ser 51 following acute intoxication. The increase in eIF 2 α phosphorylation after chronic alcohol consumption is the same as that induced by acute ethanol intoxication, and protein synthesis is not further reduced by long-term alcohol ingestion despite additional reduced expression of initiation factors and elongation factors. eIF 2 α phosphorylation alone appears sufficient to maximally inhibit hepatic protein synthesis. Indeed, pretreatment with Salubrinal, an inhibitor of eIF 2 α(P) phosphatase, before ethanol treatment does not further inhibit protein synthesis or increase eIF 2 α phosphorylation, suggesting that acute ethanol intoxication causes maximal eIF 2 α phosphorylation elevation and hepatic protein synthesis inhibition. Ethanol-induced inhibition of hepatic protein synthesis is not rapidly reversed by cessation of ethanol consumption. In conclusion, sustained eIF 2 α phosphorylation is a hallmark of excessive alcohol intake leading to inhibition of protein synthesis. Enhanced phosphorylation of eIF 2 α represents a unique response of liver to alcohol intoxication, because the ethanol-induced elevation of eIF 2 α(P) is not observed in skeletal muscle or heart...|$|R

40|$|In Drosophila, {{the product}} of the fs (2) cup gene (Cup) is known to be crucial for diverse aspects of female germ-line development. Its {{functions}} at the molecular level, however, have remained mainly unexplored. Cup was found to directly associate with eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4 E (eIF 4 E). In this report, we show that Cup is a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling protein and that the interaction with eIF 4 E promotes retention of the Cup protein in the cytoplasm. Cup is required for the correct accumulation and localization of eIF 4 E within the posterior cytoplasm of developing oocytes. We furthermore show that cup and eIF 4 E interact genetically, because a reduction in the level of <b>eIF</b> 4 E <b>activity</b> deteriorates the development and growth of ovaries bearing homozygous cup mutant alleles. Our results reveal a crucial role for the Cup–eIF 4 E complex in ovary-specific developmental programs...|$|R
40|$|Vanishing {{white matter}} (VWM) is an {{inherited}} and often severe brain disease. It {{is caused by}} mutations in the genes for eIF 2 B, a protein that {{plays a key role}} in mRNA translation. The age of onset and clinical features are highly variable. In severe cases, onset may be antenatal and other organs are affected. The main feature is always a progressive encephalopathy, faster deterioration being provoked by head injury or febrile infections. The myelinating cells, oligodendrocytes, are affected in VWM. Initial studies suggested that VWM mutations decreased <b>eIF</b> 2 B’s <b>activity.</b> However, recent findings indicate that the situation is more complex. Studies in human brain samples or a mouse model for VWM indicate that development of astroglial cells and oligodendrocytes is impaired. Defects in eIF 2 B likely affect cell stress pathways and the expression of specific proteins, although their identities remain unknown. Christopher G. Prou...|$|R
40|$|Leukoencephalopathy with {{vanishing}} {{white matter}} (VWM) is an inherited childhood white matter disorder, caused by mutations {{in the genes}} encoding eukaryotic initiation factor 2 B (eIF 2 B). The present study showed that, while the <b>eIF</b> 2 B <b>activity</b> was reduced in VWM lymphoblasts, the expression levels of the eIF 2 B subunits were similar to control lymphoblast lines. The mutations in eIF 2 B {{did not affect the}} interaction with eIF 2. Strikingly, no apparent differences for the regulation of protein synthesis, measured by [35 S]-methionine incorporation, were found between control and VWM lymphoblasts. Western blotting showed that, in some VWM cells, exposure to heat shock caused a decrease in the expression of specific eIF 2 B subunits. Most importantly, the increase in phosphorylation of eIF 2 ? in response to heat shock was lower in VWM lymphoblasts than in control cells. These findings could form part of the explanation for the episodes of rapid and severe deterioration in VWM patients that are precipitated by febrile infections...|$|R
40|$|An Epstein-Barr virus-indicating factor (EIF) {{has been}} {{purified}} from serum and platelets. We show here that highly purified preparations of platelet <b>EIF</b> exhibit growth-promoting <b>activity</b> for NIH 3 T 3 cells maintained in platelet-poor plasma. The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) -inducing activity and growth-promoting activity co-elute upon gel chromatography under non-dissociating {{as well as}} dissociating conditions and co-migrate in SDS-gel electrophoresis, supporting the notion that both activities reside on the same molecule. Furthermore, both activities require a pH shock for full activity and act in the same concentration range. The growth-promoting <b>activity</b> of <b>EIF</b> can be differentiated from that of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), biologically (on the basis of differential response of cell lines to both factors), biochemically (on the basis of differences in isoelectric points and mol. wts. and the requirement of EIF to become activated by a pH shock) and {{by the lack of}} inhibition of EIF by antibody to PDGF...|$|R
40|$|Deregulation {{of protein}} {{synthesis}} {{is a common}} event in human cancer and {{a key player in}} translational control is eIF 4 E. Elevated expression levels of eIF 4 E promote cancer development and progression. Recent findings suggest that <b>eIF</b> 4 E <b>activity</b> is a key determinant of the PI 3 K/Akt/mTOR and Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK mediated tumorigenic <b>activity</b> and targeting <b>eIF</b> 4 E should {{have a major impact on}} these pathways in human cancer. The function of eIF 4 E is modulated through phosphorylation of a conserved serine (Ser 209) by Mnk 1 and Mnk 2 downstream of ERK. While the phosphorylation event is necessary for oncogenic transformation, it seems to be dispensable for normal development. Hence, pharmacologic Mnk inhibitors may provide non-toxic and effective anti-cancer strategy. Strong circumstantial evidence indicates that Mnk inhibition presents attractive therapeutic potential, but the lack of selective Mnk inhibitors has so far confounded pharmacological target validation and clinical development.

40|$|Eukaryotic {{initiation}} factor (eIF) 2 B is a heteromeric guanine nucleotide exchange factor that {{plays an important}} role in regulating mRNA translation. Here we identify multiple phosphorylation sites in the largest, catalytic, subunit (e) of mammalian eIF 2 B. These sites are phosphorylated by four different protein kinases. Two conserved sites (Ser 712 / 713) are phosphorylated by casein kinase 2. They lie at the extreme C-terminus and are required for the interaction of eIF 2 Be with its substrate, eIF 2, in vivo and for <b>eIF</b> 2 B <b>activity</b> in vitro. Glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK 3) is responsible for phosphorylating Ser 535. This regulatory phosphorylation event requires both the fourth site (Ser 539) and a distal region, which acts to recruit GSK 3 to eIF 2 Be in vivo. The ®fth site, which lies outside the catalytic domain of eIF 2 Be, can be phosphorylated by casein kinase 1. All ®ve sites are phosphorylated in the eIF 2 B complex in vivo...|$|R
40|$|SummaryThe RNA helicase eIF 4 A plays a {{key role}} in {{unwinding}} of mRNA and scanning during translation initiation. Free eIF 4 A is a poor helicase and requires the accessory proteins eIF 4 G and eIF 4 H. However, the structure of the helicase complex and the mechanisms of stimulation of <b>eIF</b> 4 A <b>activity</b> have remained elusive. Here we report the topology of the eIF 4 A/ 4 G/ 4 H helicase complex, which is built from multiple experimentally observed domain-domain contacts. Remarkably, some of the interactions are continuously rearranged during the ATP binding/hydrolysis cycle of the helicase. We show that the accessory proteins modulate the affinity of eIF 4 A for ATP by interacting simultaneously with both helicase domains and promoting either the closed, ATP-bound conformation or the open, nucleotide-free conformation. The topology of the complex and the spatial arrangement of the RNA-binding surfaces offer insights into their roles in stimulation of helicase activity and the mechanisms of mRNA unwinding and scanning...|$|R
40|$|The {{essential}} {{guanine nucleotide}} exchange factor Eukaryotic initiation factor 2 B (eIF 2 B) plays {{a critical role}} in the control of gene expression at both a global and gene specific level. eIF 2 B is known to be regulated in a number of ways, both directly and indirectly (by phosphorylation of eIF 2 in response to kinase activity). The aim of this project was to identify and characterise novel eIF 2 B interacting/regulatory proteins in yeast. 5. We assessed whether loss of other multi-KH domain containing proteins similarly impacted on eIF 2 B requirement and found that in addition to scpl 60 A strains two further strains, heklA dndyll 032 cA, are candidate translationai repressors, whilst the php 2 A strain has been identified as a positive regulator of eIF 2 B. In addition to the KH domain family members, 24 additional candidate eIF 2 B mutant suppressors were identified as regulators of <b>eIF</b> 2 B <b>activity.</b> EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|Neuronal {{physiology}} requires activity-driven protein translation, {{a process}} in which translation initiation factors are key players. We focus on eukaryotic initiation factor 4 B (eIF 4 B), a regulator of protein translation, whose function in neurons is undetermined. We show that neuronal <b>activity</b> affects <b>eIF</b> 4 B phosphorylation and identify Ser 504 as a phosphorylation site regulated by casein kinases and sensitive to the activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors. Ser 504 phosphorylation increases eIF 4 B recruitment to the pre-initiation complex and influences eIF 4 B localization at synapses. Moreover, Ser 504 phosphorylation modulates the translation of protein kinase MÎ¶. Therefore, by sensing synaptic <b>activity,</b> <b>eIF</b> 4 B could adjust translation to neuronal needs, promoting adaptive changes in synaptic plasticity. We also show that Ser 504 phosphorylation is increased in vivo in a rat model of epilepsy during epileptogenesis i. e. when translation drives maladaptive synaptic changes. We propose eIF 4 B as a mediator between neuronal activity and translation, with relevance in the control of synaptic plasticity...|$|R
40|$|Activation of the mechanistic/mammalian {{target of}} rapamycin (mTOR) kinase in models of acute and chronic pain is {{strongly}} implicated in mediating enhanced translation and hyperalgesia. However, the molecular {{mechanisms by which}} mTOR regulates nociception remain unclear. Here we show that deletion of the eukaryotic initiation factor 4 E-binding protein 1 (4 E-BP 1), a major mTOR downstream effector, which represses <b>eIF</b> 4 E <b>activity</b> and cap-dependent translation, leads to mechanical, but not thermal pain hypersensitivity. Mice lacking 4 E-BP 1 exhibit enhanced spinal cord expression of neuroligin 1, a cell-adhesion postsynaptic protein regulating excitatory synapse function, and show increased excitatory synaptic input into spinal neurons, and a lowered threshold for induction of synaptic potentiation. Pharmacological inhibition of eIF 4 E or genetic reduction of neuroligin 1 levels normalizes the increased excitatory synaptic activity and reverses mechanical hypersensitivity. Thus, translational control by 4 E-BP 1 downstream of mTOR effects the expression of neuroligin 1 and excitatory synaptic transmission in the spinal cord, and thereby contributes to enhanced mechanical nociception...|$|R
40|$|The {{eukaryotic}} translation {{initiation factor}} 5 B (eIF 5 B) is a homolog of IF 2, an ancient translation factor that enables initiator methionine-tRNAiMet (met-tRNAiMet) loading on prokaryotic ribosomes. While {{it can be}} traced back to the last universal common ancestor, eIF 5 B is curiously dispensable in modern aerobic yeast and mammalian cells. Here, we show that eIF 5 B is an essential element of the cellular hypoxic cap-dependent protein synthesis machinery. System-wide interrogation of dynamic translation machineries by MATRIX (mass spectrometry analysis of active translation factors using ribosome density fractionation and isotopic labeling experiments) demonstrated augmented <b>eIF</b> 5 B <b>activity</b> in hypoxic translating ribosomes. Global translatome studies revealed central carbon metabolism, cellular hypoxic adaptation, and ATF 4 -mediated stress response as major eIF 5 B-dependent pathways. These primordial processes rely on eIF 5 B even in the presence of oxygen and active eIF 2, the canonical recruiter of met-tRNAiMet in eukaryotes. We suggest that aerobic eukarya retained eIF 5 B/IF 2 to remodel anaerobic pathways during episodes of oxygen deficiency...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe mRNA’s cap-binding protein {{eukaryotic}} translation {{initiation factor}} (eIF) 4 E {{is a major}} target for the regulation of translation initiation. <b>eIF</b> 4 E <b>activity</b> is controlled by a family of translation inhibitors, the eIF 4 E-binding proteins (4 E-BPs). We have previously shown that a rapid dissociation of 4 E-BP from eIF 4 E is related with the dramatic rise in protein synthesis that occurs following sea urchin fertilization. Here, we demonstrate that 4 E-BP is destroyed shortly following fertilization and that 4 E-BP degradation is sensitive to rapamycin, suggesting that proteolysis could be a novel means of regulating 4 E-BP function. We also show that eIF 4 E/ 4 E-BP dissociation following fertilization is sensitive to rapamycin. Furthermore, while rapamycin modestly affects global translation rates, the drug strongly inhibits cyclin B de novo synthesis and, consequently, precludes {{the completion of the}} first mitotic cleavage. These results demonstrate that, following sea urchin fertilization, cyclin B translation, and thus the onset of mitosis, are regulated by a rapamycin-sensitive pathway. These processes are effected at least in part through eIF 4 E/ 4 E-BP complex dissociation and 4 E-BP degradation...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe Arabidopsis thaliana-potyvirus {{system was}} {{developed}} to identify compatibility and incompatibility factors involved during infection and disease caused by positive-strand RNA viruses [1, 2]. Several Arabidopsis mutants with increased susceptibility to Tobacco etch potyvirus (TEV) were isolated previously [1], revealing a virus-specific resistance system in the phloem [3 – 5]. In this study, Arabidopsis mutants with decreased susceptibility to Turnip mosaic potyvirus (TuMV) were isolated. Three independent mutants that conferred immunity to TuMV were isolated and assigned to the same complementation group. These mutants were also immune or near-immune to TEV but were susceptible to an unrelated virus. The locus associated with decreased susceptibility was named loss-of-susceptibility to potyviruses 1 (lsp 1). The LSP 1 locus was isolated by map-based cloning and was identified as the gene encoding translation factor eIF(iso) 4 E, one of several known Arabidopsis isoforms that has cap binding <b>activity.</b> <b>eIF</b> 4 E and eIF(iso) 4 E from different plant species were shown previously {{to interact with the}} genome-linked protein (VPg) of TEV and TuMV, respectively.
