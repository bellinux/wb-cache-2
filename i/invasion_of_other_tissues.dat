30|$|The first {{observation}} of EMT can be dated back to {{as early as}} 1890 when some ductal epithelial cells were described to acquire mesenchymal characteristics in breast tumors progression as reviewed previously (Nieto, 2011). It is suggested that EMT enables the tumor cells to acquire mesenchymal characteristics like loose cell-cell interaction and migratory ability, which further lead to the detachment of cells from tumor mass and the <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> cells to <b>other</b> <b>tissues.</b> Although the requirement and significance of EMT for cancer progression has been debated for a long time, the migratory and invasive properties induced by EMT are widely accepted to be critical for metastasis (Peinado et al., 2007; Polyak and Weinberg, 2009).|$|R
40|$|The postomortem <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> {{muscle and}} <b>other</b> <b>tissues</b> by {{bacteria}} from the intestinal tract was studied {{with the use}} of radioactive tracers. The injection of 14 C-labeled bacteria or spores into the intestines of guinea pig carcasses within 24 h of death resulted in the rapid spread of 14 C throughout carcasses. When live bacteria were injected along with the labeled cells, {{it was not possible to}} isolate viable organisms from the body tissues if the living animal had been exposed to the bacteria. It appears that animals are immune to their normal intestinal flora and that this immunity persists after death; thus passage of these bacteria into the lymphatic system does not necessarily result in the presence of live bacteria in carcass tissues. It therefore seems that a delay of up to 24 h before evisceration would not lead to deep tissue contamination of the carcass by organisms usually present in the intestines. Further evidence for this hypothesis was obtained by showing that muscle and lymph nodes from uneviscerated lamb carcasses hung for 24 h at 20 C remained sterile...|$|R

40|$|Tumour {{cells have}} {{to acquire a}} number of {{capabilities}} if a neoplasm {{is to become a}} cancer. One of these key capabilities is increased motility which is needed for <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>tissues</b> and metastasis. This paper presents a qualitative mathematical model based on game theory and computer simulations using cellular automata. With this model we study the circumstances under which mutations that confer increased motility to cells can spread through a tumour made of rapidly proliferating cells. The analysis suggests therapies that could help prevent the progression towards malignancy and invasiveness of benign tumours.

40|$|David DingliDivision of Hematology and Department of Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USATumors {{derived from}} the {{transformation}} of hematopoietic or lymphoid cells are increasing in incidence 1 and with improvements in therapy, their prevalence is also growing. The increasing availability of more sophisticated molecular tools is refining the definition of these diseases 2 and now more than ever, {{we are on the}} verge of &lsquo;personalized medicine&rsquo;. No disease is as personal as cancer. The current view of tumorigenesis is that somatic cells serially acquire mutations that lead to the malignant phenotype, 3, 4 a state characterized by loss of cell cycle regulation, resistance to apoptosis, unbridled cellular proliferation, angiogenesis, evasion of the immune response, and ultimately, <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>tissues.</b> 5, 6 Although many somatic mutations probably do not provide a reproductive advantage to cells or can even be deleterious, some mutations enhance the reproductive fitness of the cell enabling it to expand into a clone where additional mutations may lead to the full malignant phenotype. Given that evolution is the result of reproduction, mutation and selection, cancer is a natural consequence, especially in large multicellular organisms that can live for many years. 7 Exposure to genotoxic agents (chemicals, viruses, radiation) or the response to chronic injury increases the risk of transformation since at some level, the risk is related to the number of cells that are dividing and how often they divide. It is not yet clear how many mutations are required to lead to the cancer phenotype but perhaps with very few exceptions, one mutation is not enough to lead to neoplastic transformation and disease...|$|E

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with cT 4 b adenocarcinoma of the rectum were treated with a tri-modality approach, including neo-adjuvant chemoradiotherapy (CRT), surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy. Patients with external sphincter invasion were classified as cT 4 b 1, whereas patients with <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> organs as cT 4 b 2.
