5|$|Artistic design, {{including}} {{character and}} monster creations, was handled by Japanese artist Yoshitaka Amano from Final Fantasy through Final FantasyVI. Amano also handled title logo designs {{for all of}} the main series and the image illustrations from Final FantasyVII onward. Tetsuya Nomura was chosen to replace Amano because Nomura's designs were more adaptable to 3D graphics. He worked with the series from Final FantasyVII through Final FantasyX; for Final FantasyIX, however, character designs were handled by Shukō Murase, Toshiyuki Itahana, and Shin Nagasawa. Nomura is also the character designer of the Kingdom Hearts series, Compilation of Final FantasyVII, and Fabula Nova Crystallis: Final Fantasy. Other designers include Nobuyoshi Mihara and Akihiko Yoshida. Mihara was the character <b>designer</b> <b>for</b> Final FantasyXI, and Yoshida served as character <b>designer</b> <b>for</b> Final Fantasy Tactics, the Square-produced Vagrant Story, and Final FantasyXII.|$|E
5|$|BioWare {{considered}} {{not making}} Tali a squadmate in Mass Effect 3. Some writers, such as Weekes, felt passionately about her inclusion, which {{led the team}} {{to believe that the}} players could share his passion. Preston Watamaniuk, lead <b>designer</b> <b>for</b> the Mass Effect series, found Tali's death in 3 was the toughest for him to plan, though felt it needed to be possible due to the option of wiping out the quarians.|$|E
5|$|Final Fantasy XIIs {{characters}} {{were designed by}} Akihiko Yoshida. It was his first involvement in a main-series Final Fantasy game, though he worked as the character <b>designer</b> <b>for</b> Final Fantasy Tactics and Vagrant Story, {{both of which were}} set in the same game world as XII, Ivalice. Comments have been made about the similarity between Yoshida's creations and those of Tetsuya Nomura, the character <b>designer</b> <b>for</b> Final Fantasy VII, VIII, X, and XIII. Yoshida feels this connection is sparked by the style of color used by both artists, which involves a color consistency between the characters and the environments. In an interview included in a bonus disc of the collector's edition of the game, he states that he created the design of the characters after reading all of the design documents on their history and beliefs. He tried to create designs and clothing that did not exist anywhere in real life and had never been seen before, designing for example the armor for the Judges on a combination of historical armor, mountain bike gear, and futuristic ideas.|$|E
25|$|The {{detailed}} {{design for the}} airport terminal was awarded to a consortium led by Mott Connell (the Hong Kong office of UK consultant Mott MacDonald) with British Airports Authority as specialist <b>designers</b> <b>for</b> airport related aspects, Foster and Partners as architects and Ove Arup as specialist structural <b>designers</b> <b>for</b> the roof. Mott Connell were the <b>designers</b> <b>for</b> foundations, all other structural components and the mechanical and electrical work. Project architects were Foster and Partners. The sides of the terminals, predominantly glass, were designed to break during high speed winds, relieving pressure and allowing the terminal to withstand an intense typhoon.|$|R

5|$|Other {{designers}} have also {{worked on the}} series. For Nine, the developers {{wanted to have a}} new style to suit the game's original vision, so the characters were designed by animator Yasuomi Umetsu. Another <b>designer</b> <b>for</b> the series is Masayuki Doi, who had {{made a name for himself}} with the Trauma Center series; and designed the main characters for Shin Megami Tensei IV. Inspired in his work by Kaneko's designs, he created the main characters' clothing to be a blend of Japanese and western fashions while incorporating design elements from the Star Wars series. For the Devil Survivor games, Atlus were aiming to appeal to a wider audience and reinvigorate the Megami Tensei franchise, hiring Suzuhito Yasuda as character <b>designer</b> <b>for</b> this purpose. Some monsters in the second Devil Survivor were designed by manga artist Mohiro Kitoh.|$|E

5|$|Although Fox {{insisted on}} {{maintaining}} CinemaScope for a time, some actors disliked the system. For Fox's 1965 production Von Ryan's Express, Frank Sinatra reputedly demanded that Auto Panatar lenses be used. Such pressures led Fox to completely abandon CinemaScope for Auto Panatars that year; Von Ryan's Express was the studio's first picture with Panavision lenses. To meet the extraordinary demand for Panavision projection lenses, Gottschalk had Bausch & Lomb CinemaScope lenses retrofitted into Panavision housings {{with a new}} astigmatic attachment, improving them greatly. This was revealed many years after Gottschalk's death; a lead designer from Bausch & Lomb, who had {{been involved with the}} original CinemaScope project, came to work as a <b>designer</b> <b>for</b> Panavision and—after opening some of the older lenses—figured out the secret.|$|E
5|$|Although {{not without}} its critics, his {{architecture}} is widely appreciated. He was awarded the Royal Institute of British Architects' (RIBA's) Royal Gold Medal for architecture in 1936 and was appointed a Royal <b>Designer</b> <b>for</b> Industry in 1943. His station designs for London Underground became the corporation's standard design influencing designs by all architects working for the organisation in the 1930s. Many of his buildings have been granted listed building status, protecting them from unapproved alteration. He twice declined the offer of a knighthood.|$|E

5|$|Concorde is an {{ogival delta}} winged {{aircraft}} with four Olympus engines {{based on those}} employed in the RAF's Avro Vulcan strategic bomber. It {{is one of the}} few commercial aircraft to employ a tailless design (the Tupolev Tu-144 being another). Concorde was the first airliner to have a (in this case, analogue) fly-by-wire flight-control system; the avionics system Concorde used was unique because it was the first commercial aircraft to employ hybrid circuits. The principal <b>designer</b> <b>for</b> the project was Pierre Satre, with Sir Archibald Russell as his deputy.|$|E
5|$|Despite his {{job title}} as a composer, Mitsuda {{worked as a}} sound effects <b>designer</b> <b>for</b> two years.

After the game's success and the music's acclaim, he went on to compose several other games for Square, including Xenogears. In 1998, Mitsuda left Square to work as a freelance composer, founding his own music production studio in 2001, Procyon Studio, as well as his own record label, Sleigh Bells. Although Mitsuda continues to compose for video games, he began to produce music in other forms of media beginning in the 2010s, including various anime series, films, and television specials, as well as his own independent albums.|$|E
