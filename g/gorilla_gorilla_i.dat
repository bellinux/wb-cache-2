40|$|Wildlife conservationists {{often come}} into {{conflict}} with local communities. To resolve conflict, conservationists conduct education and sensitization programs to raise awareness and teach the value of wildlife. This “missionary approach” raises issues of epistemic and social injustice. Just as conservation often requires local communities to relinquish sovereignty over land and natural resources, conservation education challenges local values and morality. Invited to produce conservation education media for communities living near the critically endangered Cross River <b>gorilla</b> (<b>Gorilla</b> <b>gorilla</b> diehli), <b>I</b> used the opportunity to pursue a more just method for moral debates over wildlife in contexts of unequal power and unshared cultures. For my dissertation, I designed, tested, and analyzed a form of participatory video production: “Folk Filmmaking. ” Folk Filmmaking differs from ethnography. Instead of documenting local moral beliefs about wildlife, it {{provides an opportunity for}} locals to represent themselves. It invites them to think collectively and critically about their moral beliefs. It encourages them to articulate, develop, and represent those beliefs. It provides the resources to do so through filmmaking. My dissertation describes the exclusion of African accounts about <b>gorillas,</b> revealing an epistemic injustice that undermines the authority of moral claims developed without this knowledge. It shows how justifications for <b>gorilla</b> conservation—the intellectual puzzles of animal rights; the careful, complex science of primatology, ecology, and evolutionary history; the clarion calls of environmental ethicists—seem salient in Western communities but almost irrelevant in the communities of the Cross River headwaters. It describes the Folk Filmmaking process, the films we produced, and an analysis of the method. It concludes by reflecting on the promise and limits of Folk Filmmaking as a method of moral adjudication in other contexts of wildlife conservation conflicting with local communities...|$|R

Taxonomic inclusion of the genus <b>Gorilla</b> is not stabilised yet. According to the newest taxonomy of mammals we distinguish two species of the genus <b>Gorilla,</b> Eastern <b>Gorilla</b> <b>Gorilla</b> beringei and Western <b>Gorilla</b> <b>Gorilla</b> <b>gorilla.</b> Most commonly bred species in captivity is subspecies of Western <b>Gorilla</b> <b>Gorilla</b> <b>gorilla,</b> Western Lowland <b>Gorilla</b> <b>Gorilla</b> <b>gorilla</b> <b>gorilla.</b> Wild populations of Western Lowland <b>Gorilla</b> occur in several states of Central Africa. Up to 23 rd of March there are 797 individuals of subspecies <b>Gorilla</b> <b>gorilla</b> <b>gorilla</b> bred in captivity and approximately {{more than half of}} them are being bred in captivity on the European continent. Europe is simultaneously the most successful region in reproduction of the Western Lowland <b>Gorillas.</b> Diet composition of this subspecies in the wild consists of food with high level of dietary fibre and low content of calories. On the other hand in captivity the diet composition is reversed which can directly affect the reproduction. Reproductive organs of male and female <b>gorillas</b> resembles the human reproductive organs by its shape and placement. During oestrus the female <b>gorilla</b> changes her behaviour and she tries to be attractive for the male and thereby attain the copulation with subsequent gestation. While mating, <b>gorillas</b> use two main positions with many variations. In captivity there can supervene complications with gestation, therefore assisted reproduction is commonly used technique. First young <b>gorilla</b> spawned by assisted reproduction was successfully bred in 1995 thanks to IVF method in captivity. The duration of gravidity of female <b>gorillas</b> is approximately 250 to 260 days. Symptoms of gestation in Western Lowland <b>Gorillas</b> as the growing abdomen or edema of the breast are present around second or third month before delivery. The parturition usually occurs during the night, starts with first contractions and ends with leaving of placenta. Social relationships are constantly changing within the group in accordance with different situations. After the birth of young <b>gorilla,</b> all of the members of the group become more closer to each other and the mother seeks company of the dominant male <b>gorilla</b> who can protect her offspring against the attacks of other individuals from the group or male <b>gorillas</b> from other groups.
