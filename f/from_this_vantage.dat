Following several German attacks on British positions from Bréville-les-Monts, the capture of the village became essential to secure the 6th Airborne Division positions and protect the Allied beachhead.|$|E

On December 12 the SEA captured Peak #2 of Zijinshan and <b>from</b> <b>this</b> <b>vantage</b> point unleashed a torrent of artillery fire at Zhongshan Gate where {{a large portion of}} the wall suddenly gave way. After sunset the fires that blazed out of control on Zijinshan were visible even from Zhonghua Gate in the south which was completely occupied by Japan's 10th Army on the night of December 12 to 13.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} Carolean {{features}} {{of the house is}} the balustrade and cupola surmounting the roof, another element introduced to English architecture by Roger Pratt. The cupola at Belton does not light a lofty domed hall, {{as is often the case}} in Europe, but houses a staircase which gives access to a large viewing platform on top of a lead roof, concealed from the ground by the balustrade which tops the more conventional and visible hipped roof. <b>From</b> <b>this</b> <b>vantage</b> point, the owners of Belton could admire the perfect symmetry of their avenues and formal gardens spreading from the house. This feature of the house was removed by the architect James Wyatt when he modernised the house in the 18th century. It was restored to its original form in the 1870s by the 3rd Earl Brownlow.|$|E

After the successful attack he took flight abandoning his purple tent on the spot, and so allowing Baldwin of Flanders to spend his victory night inside it. The complex was sacked by the crusaders, and afterward it was assigned to Benedictine monks of San Giorgio Maggiore. During the Latin occupation of Constantinople (1204–1261) the building became a Roman Catholic church.|$|E
25|$|The Siege of Port Arthur {{commenced}} in April 1904. Japanese troops tried numerous frontal {{assaults on}} the fortified hilltops overlooking the harbour, which were defeated with Japanese {{casualties in the}} thousands. Eventually, though, {{with the aid of}} several batteries of 11-inch (280mm) Krupp howitzers, the Japanese were able to capture the key hilltop bastion in December 1904. <b>From</b> <b>this</b> <b>vantage</b> point, the long-range artillery was able to shell the Russian fleet, which was unable to retaliate effectively against the land-based artillery and was unable or unwilling to sail out against the blockading fleet. Four Russian battleships and two cruisers were sunk in succession, with the fifth and last battleship being forced to scuttle a few weeks later. Thus, all capital ships of the Russian fleet in the Pacific were sunk. This is probably the only example in military history when such a scale of devastation was achieved by land-based artillery against major warships.|$|E

Cotman's style of watercolor varied from his contemporaries, opting to use watercolors like paint, instead of a tint.

On 25 August, the three monarchs—Alexander II of Russia, Francis II of Austria, and Frederick William III of Prussia—and their staffs assembled on an overlook of the city to [...] discuss their strategy. [...] The city's weak defenses were clear <b>from</b> <b>this</b> <b>vantage</b> point: the French and Saxon garrison of 20,000 men under Marshal Saint-Cyr could not hope to hold a city of that size. The Tsar and General Jean Victor Moreau, formerly a General of France and by 1813 an adviser to the Coalition, wanted to attack at once; Schwarzenberg wanted to wait until additional forces arrived.|$|E

The roadway starts at an entrance off M-109 (DH Day Highway) south of Glen Lake. There is a parking lot inside the entrance for visitors who wish to bike or hike the road. From there, the drive continues as a two-way road to the entrance gate before turning northward as a one-way road. There are 12 numbered locations along the road that {{are listed in the}} drive's interpretive brochure. The first of these is a covered bridge. After this point, the drive ascends a steep hill to an overlook of Glen Lake. The area around this location includes [...] "heavily forested areas, sand plains and scrub growth among the rock outcrops".

2500|$|Although White City was {{situated}} on land adjoining White River (as was Riverside Amusement Park to the south), the park's primary drawing cards were the rides and live entertainment. Along with contemporary staples Shoot-the-Chutes, merry-go-round, roller coasters (including a scenic railway through the park's many trees), a funhouse, and other mechanical rides, White City featured a baby incubator exhibit (made popular by Luna Parks on Coney Island and in Pittsburgh, but {{originated in the}} 1898 Trans-Mississippi Exposition), a simulation of the eruption of Mount Vesuvius, and a firefighting exhibit ("Fighting the Flames") around a [...] center court. Rides called [...] "Razzle Dazzle", [...] "Hale's Tour of the World", [...] "The Hereafter", [...] "Bump-the-Bumps", and [...] "Loop the Loop" [...] also proved popular {{with the people who}} visited the park.

2500|$|As Tamise and Santa Margarita fought, Unicorn {{continued}} {{the pursuit of}} Tribune. Without the need to support the slower Tamise, Moulston was able to spread more sail and Tribune pulled ahead of her opponent during the afternoon the ships passing Tuskar Rock on the Wexford Coast. The French frigate's stern-chasers continued to inflict damage on Unicorns rigging, at one point snatching away the main topsail {{and it was only}} when night fell, and the wind with it, that Williams was able to gain on the French ship through the use of studding sails. At 22:30, following a chase of [...] northwards into St George's Channel, Unicorn was finally able to pull alongside Tribune. For 35 minutes the frigates battered at one another from close range. Under cover of smoke, Moulston then attempted to escape by pulling Tribune back and turning across Unicorns stern, seeking to rake the British frigate and move to windward. Realising Moulston's intent, Williams hauled his sails around, effectively throwing Unicorn in reverse. As the British ship sailed suddenly backwards she [...] crossed Tribunes bow, raking the French ship with devastating effect. <b>From</b> <b>this</b> <b>vantage</b> point the fire from Unicorn succeeded in collapsing the foremast and mainmast on Tribune and shooting away the mizen topmast, rendering the French ship unmanageable.

2500|$|A second assault began soon after, {{advancing}} {{over the}} same ground only to again be hit by artillery, with those unscathed going to ground among {{the growing number of}} dead and wounded. As they moved forward they were joined by some of the survivors of the first assault and together attempted to roll over the Australians. The Viet Cong then tried to site another heavy machine-gun just [...] from the D Company perimeter, but Kirby personally moved out and killed the crew. Despite their casualties the heavy attacks continued amid the rain, supported by machine-guns. The main attacks came from the east, south-east and south, falling on 10 and 12 Platoons, while smaller attacks were carried out around the rest of the perimeter. However, due to the slope of the ground much of the fire passed {{over the heads of the}} defenders, protecting many from becoming casualties. The slope also had the effect of screening the advancing Viet Cong, largely preventing them from firing at the Australians until they had moved within 50 metres of their position, while at the same time preventing D Company from effectively engaging the assault force until they had closed with them. Few survived the heavy artillery fire to get that close though. Meanwhile, the Viet Cong had set up a light and a heavy machine-gun on the forward slopes of Nui Dat 2 and these continued to engage the Australians throughout the battle. Yet, while they were able to achieve plunging fire <b>from</b> <b>this</b> <b>vantage</b> point they were unable to observe D Company's position through the rubber and were reduced to sweeping a broad area. Australian casualties included four killed and several wounded during this period, the majority from head and chest wounds.|$|E
