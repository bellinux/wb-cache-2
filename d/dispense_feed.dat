50|$|In 1978, in {{diversion}} {{from its}} criminal justice application, {{a company called}} BI Incorporated began selling systems that allowed dairy farmers to <b>dispense</b> <b>feed</b> to their cows automatically. The company fitted a radio-frequency tag on each cow's ear {{so that when the}} cow approached the feed dispenser, a sensor in the latter caused it to drop a ration of fodder. If the same cow returned, the sensor recognized the unique signal of the tag and prevented the cow from getting a second helping until after enough time had passed for her to digest the first.|$|E
40|$|Lactating {{dairy cows}} were {{introduced}} to a computer feeder in early (≤ 120 days in milk or D. I. M.), mid (120 - 220 D. I. M.), and late (> 220 D. I. M.) lactation. Cows in the mid- and late-lactation groups adjusted quicker and exhibited a smaller decrease in production, relative to the early lactation group. Computer-controlled feeders are increasing in popularity nationwide and are creating some interest among dairy producers in the midwest. Computer-controlled feeders allow dairy producers with small to medium-sized herds to feed their cows according to production without dividing cows into groups or <b>dispensing</b> <b>feed</b> in the parlor. Many times, a producer considers only the cost of purchasing the computer feeder, but should {{realize that there is}} an additional expense involved in adjusting the cows to the feeder. This trial was designed to establish some guidelines as to when to introduce cows to a computer feeder, while holding production as close to normal as possible...|$|R
40|$|Compounded feeds {{have been}} one of the {{essential}} requisites in the development of aquaculture. Rearing of larvae in the hatchery, postal larval rearing in the nursery until they become stockable size and their subsequent culture in grow-out ponds require appropriate and nutritionally balanced compounded feeds. Compounded feeds have many advantages. By understanding the nutritional requirements of the candidate species of culture, nutritionally well balanced feeds could be formulated using low-cost feedstuffs available in the concerned region. These feeds could be prepared in large quantities with good shelf life and can be used off the shelf wherever and whenever required. Preparation of compounded feed does not require extensive area and highly skilled man power. High efficiency of the feed could be achieved by judicious manipulation of feed ingredients and can be made economically feasible. <b>Dispensing</b> of compounded <b>feeds</b> is quite convenient over large farm areas and automatic <b>feed</b> <b>dispensing</b> devices could be successfully employed...|$|R
40|$|The high {{pressure}} hydraulic energy management integration (HP-HEMI) energy recovery device (ERD) centralizes brine hydraulic energy recovery, feed pressure and flow control and brine pres-sure and flow control into one compact and fully integrated unit. The {{objective is to}} <b>dispense</b> with <b>feed</b> pressure control valves (i. e. elimination of throttling losses) {{as well as a}} variable frequency drive (VFD) on the {{high pressure}} feed pump (HPP) resulting in the twin benefits of a substantial reduction in energy consumption and capital costs. This paper reports on test results of a produc-tion HP-HEMI coping with recoveries and pressures that accurately simulate an SWRO system dealing with typical feed temperature and membrane fouling variations. The paper further reports on development of a PLC control scheme that regulates feed flow and brine flow via adjustment of the HP-HEMI control features to meet a wide variety of membrane operating conditions. The paper also outlines future research concerning mitigation of equipment failure and further enhancements of system control...|$|R
40|$|Productivity and resource-use-efficiency {{are among}} {{exclusive}} guiding factors in technology development with far reaching consequences on food security and employment generation. Therefore. the focus remains steady and sharpened {{on the ways}} to produce more from a unlt area at sustained level to meet the domestic demands. The Central Institute of Freshwater Aquaculture IS pioneering R 8 D eflorts {{on a wide range}} of region and resource specific technologies to enhance fish production. However, the escalating price of supplementary feeds that constitutes almost three-fitths of operat~onal cost of fish production is still a nagging problem engaging priority attention in recent times. Integrated livestock-fish farming potentially <b>dispenses</b> with fish <b>feed</b> requirement by recycling organic wastes favouring biological productivity with a high degree of compatibility, for enhanced fish yield.

40|$|The {{main results}} of the review of {{existing}} methods, methods, equipment for grinding, distribution of coarse forages, including rolled feed, on cattle–breeding farms are given in the article. This allows us to identify the main factors affecting the productivity of grinders — distributors {{and the quality of}} supply of finished material to feeders. On the basis of research works and analysis of existing technical means for the preparation and distribution of coarse forages, we propose a constructive technological scheme for a mobile shredder–distributor with a longitudinal arrangement of a knife–type working organ. Analysis of mobile shredders and distributors revealed that they should provide loading in the places of storage of coarse forages, transportation, grinding and <b>dispensing</b> in the <b>feeding</b> zone. The technical tool that performs the totality of the above operations is a dynamic system that operates under conditions of changing external influences. The model of the shredder–distributor functioning is proposed, which can be calculated with incoming variables that determine the conditions of its operation: feeding feed roll, which can be changed if necessary, as well as the physical and mechanical properties of the material, mainly density and humidity, which are uncontrollable factors and are monitored in advance experiments...|$|R
40|$|A {{total of}} 283 pigs (PIC TR 4 × 1050, {{initially}} 77. 2 ± 1. 4 lb BW) {{were used to}} compare phase feeding with blending finishing diets by using the FeedPro system (Feedlogic Corporation, Willmar, MN). There were 3 experimental treatments: (1) a standard 4 -phase complete feed program, (2) blending high- and low-lysine complete diets over the entire experiment, and (3) blending ground corn and a separate complete supplement within each phase. FeedPro is an integrated <b>feed</b> <b>dispensing</b> system that can deliver and blend 2 separate diets while dispensing. The 4 phases were 77 to 120, 120 to 175, 175 to 221, and 221 to 278 lb. Each treatment had 12 replicate pens and 8 pigs per pen. Overall (77 to 278 lb), ADG and ADFI were similar (P > 0. 24) across treatments. However, pigs fed the ground corn-supplement blend had poorer (P 0. 70) in HCW, percentage yield, and loin depth across treatments. Pigs fed using phase feeding of the ground corn-supplement blend had greater (P 0. 28) statistical differences in total revenue and income over feed costs (IOFC) across treatments. However, the highest IOFC was obtained from diet blending, which had a numeric advantage of $ 1. 44 to $ 2. 32 /pig over other treatments. In conclusion, the FeedPro system blended separate complete diets and a ground corn-supplement combination without adversely affecting growth performance and carcass characteristics...|$|R
40|$|In {{the course}} of the PhD thesis {{reactive}} homogeneous fluoropolymers have been synthesized employing free radical continuous addition polymerization technique. Classical free radical „batch copolymerization”, is done when solvent, initiator and monomers are mixed together and heated under inert conditions until almost full conversion of the monomer has been achieved. The procedure results in messy products or simply a blend of copolymers with different monomeric compositions. The most reactive monomer reacts faster e. g. incorporates into the macromolecule, but less reactive monomer accumulates in the reaction mixture leading to the copolymers enriched in less reactive monomer. The issue of continuous addition polymerization is that the consumed monomers must continuously be replaced by <b>dispensing</b> of monomer <b>feed</b> solution in {{the course of}} polymerization, generating a homogeneous copolymers. Modification of the fluoropolymers was done in order to get solubility in water, ethanol or their mixtures, UV and thermally corosslinkcable functionalities and develop water born, super hydrophobic/oleophobic formulations based on the reactive fluoropolymers together with different sizes silica nanopatricles and their combinations. For this purpose, the silica nanoparticles of different sizes have been obtained as well and characterized by TEM, SEM and DLS. The nano composite superhydrophobic/oleophobic coatings from environmentally friendly solvents (water, ethanol, and their mixtures) were formed on different substrates like glass, plastics, aluminum, paper, ceramics, and textile using spin coating, electro spraying, padding and dip coating techniques. The attempts to obtain nanofibers with very low surface energy by means of electrospinning were made as well. All coatings and nanofibers were investigated using contact angle measurement apparatus AFM, and SEM and etc. Most of the coatings showed superhydrophobic character exhibiting a contact angle against water more then 150 degrees. The preparation of high quality nanofibers with extremely low surface energy requires the further optimization of electrospinning parameters...|$|R
40|$|Summary Objective: To {{determine}} {{the accuracy of}} three different types of gestation feed drops. Materials and methods: Econo, Accu, and Ultra feed drops (Automated Production Systems, Assumption, Illinois) were attached to feed lines at three angles (90 ˚, 75 ˚, and 60 ˚). Feed was collected and weighed at settings of 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 lb (0. 9, 1. 8, 2. 7, 3. 6, and 4. 65 kg) for the Econo and Accu feed drops and 2, 4, 6, and 8 lb for the Ultra feed drops. Results: There was a drop type × angle × feed level interaction (P <. 01) for the feed settings versus the actual amount dropped. At 90 ˚, {{the relationship between the}} feeder setting (x) and actual quantity of feed dropped was best described by the regression equation (1. 156 x + 0. 244) for the Econo, (1. 010 x + 0. 072) for the Accu, and (1. 009 x + 0. 231) for the Ultra feed drops. At 75 ˚, the regression equations were (1. 014 x – 0. 139) for the Econo, (0. 997 x + 0. 057) for the Accu, and (1. 005 x + 0. 156) for the Ultra feed drops. At 60 ˚, the regression equations were (0. 689 x – 0. 076) for the Econo, (0. 989 x – 0. 249) for the Accu, and (0. 951 x + 0. 026) for the Ultra feed drops. Implications: The type of feed drop and its angle relative to the feed line influences the amount of <b>feed</b> <b>dispensed</b> at a feeder setting. The Accu and Ultra feed drops more accurately dispense the correct amount of feed than the Econo feed drops...|$|R
40|$|A {{total of}} 808 pigs (PIC 337 x 1050, {{initially}} 78. 4 ± 1. 4 lb BW) {{were used to}} compare different feed-blending strategies for finishing pigs using the FeedPro system (Feedlogic Corp., Willmar, MN). There were 3 experimental treatments: (1) a standard-phase complete feed program, (2) blending a high- and low-lysine complete diet (curve), and (3) blending ground corn and a supplement. FeedPro is an integrated <b>feed</b> <b>dispensing</b> system that can deliver and blend 2 separate diets while dispensing. Treatment diets were fed over 4 phases (78 to 231 lb BW) with a common complete diet containing Paylean fed during the fifth phase. The 5 phases were from 78 to 115, 115 to 157, 157 to 191, 191 to 239, and 239 to 281 lb. Each treatment had 10 replicate pens and 26 to 27 pigs per pen. Overall (d 0 to 78), pigs phase-fed complete diets had greater (P < 0. 01) ADG than pigs fed blended diets and tended to have greater (P < 0. 07) ADG than those fed the ground corn-supplement blend. Pigs fed the blended diets had lower (P < 0. 001) ADFI than pigs phase-fed complete diets or fed the corn-supplement blend. However, pigs fed blended diets had improved (P < 0. 001) F/G compared to pigs phase-fed a ground corn-supplement blend and tended to have improved (P < 0. 07) F/G compared to pigs fed standard-phase diets. Pigs fed standard-phase diets had heavier (P < 0. 03) HCW than pigs fed the corn-supplement blend and tended to have heavier (P < 0. 03) HCW than pigs fed diets on a lysine curve. However, {{there were no differences}} (P ≥ 0. 11) in percentage yield, percentage lean, fat depth, or loin depth among treatments. There were no differences (P ≥ 0. 11) in total revenue or income over feed costs (IOFC) across treatments. However, standard phase-fed pigs held a numerical advantage in total revenue, mainly driven by a heavier HCW over other treatments. Also, pigs fed a ground corn-supplement blend had numerically the lowest IOFC compared to other treatments. In conclusion, feeding using the FeedPro system is competitive with standard phase-fed diets on a net return basis, while feeding a ground corn-supplement blend adversely affected net returns...|$|R
