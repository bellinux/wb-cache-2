As dynamic information is usually characterized by a short lifetime, both publishers and subscribers may specify the delay requirement on message delivery. Although existing pub/sub systems can easily be extended so that publishers and subscribers can specify their delay requirements, it remains a challenging problem to improve the efficiency of pub/sub systems so that as many messages can be successfully delivered as possible, while the network traffic does not increase significantly. In this paper, we propose an efficient approach for pub/sub systems to achieve bounded delay on <b>message</b> <b>delivery.</b> Three <b>message</b> <b>scheduling</b> strategies are proposed for the system {{to make use of}} available bandwidth efficiently. Simulation results show that our strategies enable subscribers to receive significantly more valid messages than traditional strategies, while the network traffic just increases slightly. 1...|$|R

After {{a review of the}} Dynamic Broadcast system we analyze the new flexibilities in the content delivery and study the challenging use cases.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{generate}} a performance model for an order-to-delivery (OTD) process in <b>delivery</b> <b>scheduling</b> environments. It aims to do this with a triadic approach, encompassing a customer, a supplier and a logistics service provider. Design/methodology/approach – The paper takes the form of a conceptual analysis and a triadic case study on performance measurement requirements in an OTD process characterized by <b>delivery</b> <b>scheduling,</b> and generating performance models. Findings – Two OTD process performance models, one for the supplier’s delivery sub-process and one for the customer’s <b>delivery</b> <b>scheduling,</b> the logistics service provider’s transportation and the customer’s good receipt sub-process, in <b>delivery</b> <b>scheduling</b> environments are generated. Research limitations/implications – A single case study limits the levels of external validity and reliability to analytical generalization. Practical implications – The generated performance models include definitions of four sub-processes and outline ten performance dimensions that should be of relevance for several companies to apply. Originality/value – This is the first approach that generates performance models for a triadic OTD process for use in <b>delivery</b> <b>scheduling</b> environments...|$|R

The study reveals how four <b>delivery</b> <b>schedule</b> characteristics – namely, receiving frequency, planning period, frozen period and demand variation – create information quality (IQ) de ciencies in ve dimensions of IQ: completeness, conciseness, reliability, timeliness and credibility. At the same time, it demonstrates how such de ciencies a ect the supplier’s production scheduling process by requiring additional rescheduling, reworking and follow-up activities as well as additional capacity problems, safety time, safety stock and backlogs.

The purpose {{of the system is}} to assist planners in constructing <b>delivery</b> <b>schedules</b> of water tanks to often remote areas in Australia. A <b>delivery</b> <b>schedule</b> consists of a number of delivery trips by trucks. An optimal <b>delivery</b> <b>schedule</b> minimises cost to deliver a given total sales value of delivered products. To construct an optimal <b>delivery</b> <b>schedule,</b> trucks need to be optimally packed with water tanks and accessories to be delivered to a set of delivery locations. This packing problem, which involves many packing and loading constraints, is intertwined with the transport problem of minimising distance travelled by road. Such a decision-support system that optimises multi-component operational problems is of great importance for an organisation; it supports what-if analysis for operational and strategic decisions and trade-off analysis to handle multi-objective optimisation problems; it is capable of handling and analysing variances; it is easy to modify – constraints, business rules, and various assumptions can be re-configured by a client. Construction of such decision-support systems requires the use of heuristic methods rather than linear/integer programming. Jacob Stolk, Isaac Mann, Arvind Mohais and Zbigniew Michalewic...|$|R

The <b>delivery</b> <b>scheduling</b> problem is motivated by the first author’s earlier consulting work un-dertaken together with Dr Leong Thin Yin (currently with the Singapore Management University).

For integrating those subproblem solving agents, an integration-and-evaluation agent solves the total problem.

We consider a delivery center with function, i. e., generating and integrating <b>delivery</b> <b>schedule,</b> acquiring and managing the information shared commonly by all delivery persons, and dispatching the selected information to delivery persons, and the mobile terminal, which a delivery person uses for exchanging information with the center.
