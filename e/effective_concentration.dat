5|$|This high {{concentration}} of macromolecules in cytosol causes an effect called macromolecular crowding, which is when the <b>effective</b> <b>concentration</b> of other macromolecules is increased, since they have less volume to move in. This crowding effect can produce large changes in both the rates and the position of chemical equilibrium of reactions in the cytosol. It is particularly important {{in its ability to}} alter dissociation constants by favoring the association of macromolecules, such as when multiple proteins come together to form protein complexes, or when DNA-binding proteins bind to their targets in the genome.|$|E

The model is applied to erfc-diffused pp+ junctions using experimental data of bandgap narrowing, lifetime and mobility. Bandgap narrowing is shown to degrade the minority carrier reflecting properties of the high-low junction. Computer results are applied {{for the design of}} BSF solar cells and to study other solar cell structures based on high-low junctions.

This targets the 3' (sib) end of the mRNA for RNAaseIII degradation, which results in a lower <b>effective</b> <b>concentration</b> of int mRNA than xis mRNA (as the int cistron is nearer to the sib sequence than the xis cistron is to the sib sequence), so a higher concentrations of xis than int is observed.|$|E

Gas was employed primarily on the Western Front—the static, confined trench system was ideal for achieving an <b>effective</b> <b>concentration.</b> Germany also made use of gas against Russia on the Eastern Front, where the lack of effective countermeasures resulted in deaths of over 56,000 Russians, while Britain experimented with gas in Palestine during the Second Battle of Gaza. Russia began manufacturing chlorine gas in 1916, with phosgene being produced later in the year. However, most of the manufactured gas was never used.|$|E
500|$|The Federal {{government}} retired Jones in February 1952 {{and replaced}} {{him with an}} RAF officer, Air Marshal Donald Hardman, who was well versed in the functional command system employed in Britain. Hardman believed that restructuring the Air Force would remove inefficiencies and duplication, and permit commanders greater autonomy, allowing more <b>effective</b> <b>concentration</b> of strength in a potential combat situation. He declared that the RAAF was [...] "the one force that could quickly strike for Australia's and the Commonwealth's defence in South East Asia". To this end he proposed reorganising command {{and control of the}} Air Force according to three major functions: operations, covering home defence and mobile task forces; training, including all permanent, reserve and national service recruitment and instruction; and maintenance, responsible for supply, equipment and other logistical services. The three functions were duly constituted in October 1953 as Home, Training, and Maintenance Commands, respectively.|$|E

50|$|There is an {{important}} feature of calciferols toxicology, that they are synergistic with anticoagulant toxicants, that means, that mixtures of anticoagulants and calciferols in same bait are more toxic than a sum of toxicities of the anticoagulant and the calciferol in the bait, so that a massive hypercalcemic effect {{can be achieved by}} a substantially lower calciferol content in the bait, and vice versa, a more pronounced anticoagulant/hemorrhagic effects are observed if the calciferol is present. This synergism is mostly used in calciferol low <b>concentration</b> baits, because <b>effective</b> <b>concentrations</b> of calciferols are more expensive than <b>effective</b> <b>concentrations</b> of most anticoagulants.|$|R

500|$|Three French GRDIs (Groupes de Reconnaissance de Division d'Infanterie) {{had arrived}} on 10 May; these {{motorised}} units subsequently departed for North Brabant, but from 11 May {{the area was}} reinforced by two French infantry divisions: the 60e Division d'Infanterie, a B-class division, and the newly formed naval 68e Division d'Infanterie. Part of their equipment was brought by ship through Flushing harbour. Most troops of these divisions would remain south of the Western Scheldt in Zeeuws-Vlaanderen, where two of the eight Dutch battalions were also present, as were two border companies. Only two French regiments {{were sent to the}} northern bank. On 13 May the Dutch troops were placed under French operational command and 68e Division d'Infanterie was transferred to the 7th Army. Cooperation between the two allies left much to be desired and was plagued by poor communications, misunderstandings and differences regarding strategy. The Dutch considered the Bath and Zanddijk Positions to be very defensible because of the open polder landscape and extensive inundations. [...] However, the French commander, General Pierre-Servais Durand, was not convinced of their value and positioned his troops at more conspicuous obstacles. On the evening of 13 May one regiment, the 271e of 68e Division d'Infanterie, occupied the Canal through Zuid-Beveland and the other, the 224e of 60 Division d'Infanterie, took a position at the Sloe straights separating the island of Walcheren from Zuid-Beveland, even though there was not sufficient time for adequate entrenchment. This prevented an <b>effective</b> <b>concentration</b> of Allied forces, allowing the Germans, despite a numerical inferiority, to defeat them piecemeal.|$|E

However, she initially struggles as a field agent, nearly compromising the team's mission when she attempts to get help for her mentally ill sister Sarah (Candace Brown). Later whilst trying to escape during an undercover mission in an <b>effective</b> <b>concentration</b> camp, in which the gravely wounded are incinerated, Esther strangles Colin Maloney (Marc Vann) in unarmed combat, leaving her aghast and shaken. In the following episode, Esther works out that Gwen is being blackmailed into delivering Jack to an unknown conspirator; she has Gwen's parents liberated by Sergeant Andy Davidson (Tom Price), and alongside Rex, successfully snipes Jack's would-be captors. The Torchwood team subsequently end up in CIA custody. Though Esther is pardoned alongside Rex, Jack is shot {{as he tries to}} escape, leaving Esther with the responsibility of keeping him safe on the run. Two months later, in [...] "The Gathering", Esther has nursed Jack to health in Scotland where she drains his blood, believing it connected to the Miracle. The team learn that the Miracle originated at the near-antipodes of Shanghai and Buenos Aires; the team splits up, with Esther and Rex in the latter location. The series finale, [...] "The Blood Line", sees Esther fatally shot by a member of The Three Families— the villains behind Miracle Day— in an attempt to prevent Torchwood ending the Miracle, but Gwen persuades Jack and Rex that Esther has to die so that the Miracle can be ended. In the episode's epilogue, Esther is among the few post miracle deceased to be allowed a full funeral service.|$|E

[...] The domain consists of a beta sandwich architecture, with the cyclic nucleotide binding pocket between the beta sheets.
