500|$|... "Beautiful People" [...] {{was written}} by Brown, Jean Baptiste, Benny Benassi and Alle Benassi, with the latter two also {{handling}} its production. It was recorded at The Record Plant—a studio in Los Angeles, California. Before the release of F.A.M.E., the song leaked online on January 16, 2011. The single cover was unveiled on February 2, 2011, showing Brown strapping a gas mask onto <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> peers up at the camera. The song's title is spelled out in ransom note effect, with Brown's name graffitied onto the bottom right corner. [...] "Beautiful People" [...] was released for digital download on March 11, 2011. An extended play, featuring additional remixes of the song, was made available for download in the United Kingdom and the United States on April 19, 2011. [...] "Beautiful People" [...] was later included on Benassi's fifth studio album, Electroman (2011), as track four.|$|E
500|$|After an {{individual}} ("the gardener") {{came forward with}} information, a small pond near the Aruba Racquet Club close to the Marriott Hotel beach was partly drained between July 27 and 30, 2005. According to Jug Twitty, the gardener claimed to have seen Van der Sloot attempting to hide <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> drove into the Racquet Club with the Kalpoe brothers on the very early morning of May 30 between 2:30a.m. and 3:00a.m. Nancy Grace described the gardener as [...] "the man whose testimony cracks the case wide open". Another person, [...] "the jogger", claimed to have seen men burying a blonde-haired woman in a landfill during the afternoon of May 30. The police had searched the landfill {{in the days following}} Holloway's disappearance. After the jogger's statements, the landfill was searched three more times; the FBI used cadaver dogs to assist in the recovery operation. The searches were fruitless.|$|E
500|$|Almost immediately, the Daddies emerged a {{controversial}} presence within Eugene's actively political atmosphere. Feminist groups condemned the band's performances as pornographic, accusing their band name and sexually charged lyricism as promotion of sexism and misogyny, claims which Perry boldly disputed, defending the controversial elements as misinterpreted satire. In what Eugene Weekly called [...] "the most hotly discussed {{topic in the}} local music scene" [...] and [...] "the Eugene flash point for the growing national debate on censorship [...] free speech", the Daddies endured a storm of controversy which nearly ended their burgeoning career. Vigilante protest groups habitually tore down or defaced the band's posters and led boycotts against venues that would book the group and even newspapers which gave them a positive review. The Daddies' concerts regularly became sites of organized picketing and, on one occasion, a bomb threat. The band members themselves were frequent recipients of hate mail, threats and physical harassment: once, Perry claimed, an irate protester threw {{a cup of hot}} coffee in <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> was walking down the street.|$|E
60|$|Sergeant Menzies {{caught sight}} of <b>his</b> comrade's <b>face</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> sprang into the saddle.|$|R

60|$|And <b>his</b> grave <b>face</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> {{worked in}} silence was {{as still as}} the stones of the post-tertiary period.|$|R
2500|$|The veteran West Indies cricket writer Tony Becca {{wrote in}} the Jamaica Gleaner: [...] "Mendis bowls everything. With a smile on <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> caresses the ball before {{delivering}} it, he bowls the offbreak, he bowls the legbreak, he bowls the googly, he bowls the flipper, he bowls a straight delivery, he bowls them with different grips and different actions, he bowls them with a different trajectory and at a different pace, and he disguises them brilliantly. The result is that he mesmerises, or bamboozles, batsmen.|$|E
2500|$|The cult or the Muisca was {{centered}} around their two main deities; Sué for the Sun and Chía for the Moon. The {{developed their own}} vigesimal (based on 20) calendar and knew exactly {{the timing of the}} summer solstice (June 21). It was then the Day of Sué, the Sun god. The Sué temple was in Sogamoso, the sacred city of the Sun and the seat of the Iraca (priest). The Muisca name of the city, Suamox or Sugamuxi, means [...] "The City of the Sun". On the solstice, the zaque went to Suamox for a major festival where ritual offerings were made. It was the only day of the year when the zaque showed <b>his</b> <b>face,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> was considered a descendant of the Sun god.|$|E
2500|$|The most publicized {{aspect of}} Riesel's career was an April 5, 1956, attack in which sulphuric acid was thrown in <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> was leaving Lindy's (a famous {{restaurant}} in Manhattan). Riesel had been reporting on {{corruption in the}} International Union of Operating Engineers and its then-President, William C. DeKoning, Jr. He had recently alleged that DeKoning was conspiring with Joseph S. Fay (a convicted labor racketeer and extortionist) to re-establish his father, William C. DeKoning, Sr. (who had recently been freed from prison after serving a sentence for extortion) {{as president of the}} union. Although Riesel had received numerous death and other threats over the past few months, he had dismissed them as the work of [...] "cranks." ...|$|E

60|$|I {{could see}} <b>his</b> upturned <b>face</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> floated onwards down the stream, through the meadow! It {{was full of}} deep resignation.|$|R
60|$|She watched <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> traced his {{way through}} these {{speculative}} thickets.|$|E

6000|$|Quickly {{he seized}} the paddle to shove off; but Darius thrust {{the muzzle of}} a musket in <b>his</b> very <b>face,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> cried sharply: ...|$|R
60|$|Every line in <b>his</b> <b>face</b> deepened <b>as</b> <b>he</b> said it, {{and put in}} its {{affecting}} {{evidence of}} the suffering he had undergone.|$|R
60|$|Some of the {{satisfaction}} of which he spoke came into <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> gazed out to sea.|$|E
60|$|Bob {{shook his}} head, {{and there was}} no mistaking the look on <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> did so.|$|E
60|$|Harry's brow became clouded, {{and there}} was a look of anger on <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> {{answered}} her.|$|E
60|$|The anxious prince turned eagerly towards Sigismund, and a {{gleam of}} joy lighted <b>his</b> <b>face</b> again, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> studied the young man's features.|$|R
60|$|An awful look flashed into <b>his</b> <b>face,</b> and, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> {{suddenly}} {{raised his}} arm, I {{looked into the}} dark muzzle of his revolver.|$|R
60|$|Almost a {{softening}} {{flicker of}} light was imminent in <b>his</b> withered <b>face</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> beheld the others proudly lift their hats and exhibit their own supplies.|$|R
60|$|In {{spite of}} his {{certainty}} a slight redness came into <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> spoke the last two words.|$|E

60|$|Bertie grinned {{all over}} <b>his</b> <b>face,</b> which, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> sat, was not visible to his brother. Then with preternatural gravity he turned towards him.|$|R
60|$|The Count flung {{himself into}} a chair, as much to {{dissemble}} such signs of relief as might show upon <b>his</b> <b>face,</b> <b>as</b> because <b>he</b> wished to sit.|$|R

60|$|This {{look was}} on <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> {{walked toward the}} clump of trees {{on the right of}} the road.|$|E
