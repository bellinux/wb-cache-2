40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to examine the determinants of delays <b>in</b> <b>Preparations</b> of Regional Revenue and Expenditure. This study was conducted in Sarmi Regency. The population was member of budget board in the House of Representative, budget team from the government agencies and government officials from each work units. There were 60 respondents using a direct survey to collect data. A multiple regressions were employed to empirically test research hypotheses. The research revealed that relation between executive and legislative positively associated with delays <b>in</b> <b>preparations</b> of Regional Revenue and Expenditure. In other words, the better relation between executive and legislative are likely to lower the delays <b>in</b> <b>preparations</b> of Regional Revenue and Expenditure in Sarmi regency. Also, the educational backgrounds positively influence delays <b>in</b> the <b>preparations</b> of Regional Revenue and Expenditure. It means that advancement in educational backgrounds are likely to lower delays <b>in</b> <b>preparations</b> of Regional Revenue and Expenditure in Sarmi regency. Another factor was performance indicators which positively associate with delays <b>in</b> <b>preparations</b> of Regional Revenue and Expenditure. This infers that increase in performance indicators will likely to lower delays <b>in</b> <b>preparations</b> of Regional Revenue and Expenditure in Sarmi regency. Meanwhile, commitment was not supported.

40|$|Differences in the {{acetylcholine}} (ACh) -induced endothelium-dependent {{relaxation and}} hyperpolarization of the mesenteric arteries of Wistar Kyoto rats (WKY) and stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP) were studied. Relaxation was impaired <b>in</b> <b>preparations</b> from SHRSP and tendency {{to reverse the}} relaxation was observed at high concentrations of ACh <b>in</b> these <b>preparations.</b> Relaxation was partly blocked by NG-nitro-L-arginine (L-NOARG, 100 [*]μM) and, {{in the presence of}} L-NOARG, tendency to reverse the relaxation was observed in response to higher concentrations of ACh, even <b>in</b> <b>preparations</b> from WKY. The relaxation remaining in the presence of L-NOARG was also smaller <b>in</b> <b>preparations</b> from SHRSP. The tendency to reverse the relaxation observed at higher concentrations of ACh <b>in</b> <b>preparations</b> from SHRSP or WKY in the presence of L-NOARG were abolished by indomethacin (10 [*]μM). Elevating the K+ concentration of the incubation medium decreased relaxation in the presence of both indomethacin and L-NOARG. Relaxation in the presence of L-NOARG and indomethacin was reduced by the application of both apamin (5 [*]μM) and charybdotoxin (0. 1 [*]μM). This suggests that the relaxation induced by ACh is brought about by both endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF, nitric oxide (NO)) and hyperpolarizing factor (EDHF), which activates Ca 2 +-sensitive K+ channels. Electrophysiological measurement revealed that ACh induced endothelium-dependent hyperpolarization of the smooth muscle of both <b>preparations</b> <b>in</b> the presence of L-NOARG and indomethacin; the hyperpolarization being smaller <b>in</b> the <b>preparation</b> from SHRSP than that from WKY. These results suggest that the release of both NO and EDHF is reduced <b>in</b> <b>preparations</b> from SHRSP. <b>In</b> addition, indomethacin-sensitive endothelium-derived contracting factor (EDCF) is released from both preparations; the release being increased <b>in</b> <b>preparations</b> from SHRSP...|$|R
