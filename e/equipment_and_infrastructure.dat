25|$|The {{number of}} {{aircraft}} in the IAF has been decreasing from the late 1990s due to retirement of older aircraft and several crashes. To deal with the depletion of force levels, the IAF has started to modernise its fleet.

As new aircraft enter service and numbers recover, the IAF plans to have a fleet of 42 squadrons.|$|E
25|$|Metra employees, the Metra Police Department {{and other}} public safety {{agencies}} are responsible for maintaining safety and security on its lines, aboard its trains and at stations all to various degrees. Although rail transport {{is one of the}} safest forms of land travel, compromises to Metra's safety and security can occur through pedestrian accidents, suicide attempts, vehicle collisions, derailment, terrorism and other incidents. Failing to maintain safety and security can result in <b>equipment</b> <b>and</b> <b>infrastructure</b> damage, extensive service disruptions, traumatic injuries and loss of life. Therefore, Metra and other agencies consider safety a top priority and dedicate a significant amount of resources to combat these dangers.|$|E
25|$|Not {{only do they}} {{thrive in}} urban areas, red {{imported}} fire ants can damage <b>equipment</b> <b>and</b> <b>infrastructure</b> and impact business, land, and property values. They are also attracted to electricity; electrically stimulated workers release venom alkaloids, alarm pheromones, and recruitment pheromones, which in return attracts more workers to the site. As a result, red imported fire ants can destroy electrical equipment. This is known as magnetism, where scientists have identified internal magnetic materials which {{may play a role}} in orientation behaviours. They are known to chew through electrical insulation which causes damage to electric motors, irrigation lines, pumps, signal boxes, transformers, telephone exchanges, and other equipment. Colonies aggregate near electrical fields and are capable of causing short circuits or interfering with switches and equipment such as air conditioners, computers, and water pumps. They are also known to infest airport landing areas and traffic lights.|$|E

25|$|Harvests of P. clarkii {{account for}} a large {{majority}} of the crayfish produced in the United States and elsewhere. Crayfish farming began in Louisiana in the 18th century, taking place in rice fields in a concurrent or alternate culture system. The concurrent culture of rice and crayfish makes good use of land, resources, <b>equipment,</b> <b>and</b> <b>infrastructure</b> already being used for rice production. However, crawfish production has decreased in recent years due to an increase of imports from China, which is now the world's leading producer of crawfish and is also using a rice-based system. A number of species of crustaceans were introduced to China to create markets for aquaculture and because they are better adapted to growing in a rice field than native fish species. Rice-fish farming originated in China and is once again growing as the yields from Green Revolution practices used to grow rice are no longer increasing, and resources such as land and water are becoming more limited.|$|E
25|$|Parallel {{to these}} {{efforts in the}} {{education}} sector, other sectors (for example, certain aspects of housing and municipal services) in Egypt are planning to decentralize decision-making and spending, now nationwide (without a pilot stage in limited governorates), in a phased approach. Education plans {{to be one of}} the lead sectors in this process. In addition to administrative and financial decentralization, there is an increasing emphasis on involving elected local popular councils (which exist at governorate and district level) in the horizontal oversight of expenditure and planning across the decentralizing sectors, and as they come on stream in the decentralization process. Within the education sector, as of late 2009 plans are being made to decentralize certain lines of funding and planning for capital <b>equipment</b> <b>and</b> <b>infrastructure,</b> in all governorates, all the way to school level in the case of smaller units of capital equipment, or levels higher than the school for items such as new infrastructure. The education sector does expect to continue to use the original 3 pilot governorates as a special observatory to assess and understand how well the process is proceeding.|$|E
25|$|The ant {{is viewed}} as a notorious pest, causing billions of dollars in damages {{annually}} and impacting wildlife. The ants thrive in urban areas, so their presence may deter outdoor activities. Nests can be built under structures such as pavements and foundations, which may cause structural problems, or cause them to collapse. Not only can they damage or destroy structures, but red imported fire ants also can damage <b>equipment</b> <b>and</b> <b>infrastructure</b> and impact business, land, and property values. As workers are attracted to electricity, they can swarm electrical equipment and destroy it. In agriculture, they can damage crops, damage machinery, and threaten pastures. They are known to invade a wide variety of crops, and mounds built on farmland may prevent harvesting. They also pose a threat to animals and livestock, capable of inflicting serious injury or killing them, especially weak or sick animals. Despite this, they may be beneficial because they consume common pest insects on crops. Common methods of controlling these ants include baiting and fumigation; other methods may be ineffective or dangerous. Due to its notoriety and importance, the ant {{has become one of the}} most studied insects on the planet, even rivalling the western honey bee (Apis mellifera).|$|E

30|$|One {{limitation}} of any process-based {{approach is the}} treatment of capital goods such as <b>equipments</b> <b>and</b> <b>infrastructure</b> which is handled separately in design phase for the production system. Hence, this represents a stock flow for PIOTs {{and need to be}} modeled separately, which need to be handled separately. Missing data are another important challenge. Some studies rely on non-survey techniques such as RAS to arrive at approximations based on whole system data (Miller and Blair 2009). In the case of our model, a mass balanced transactions matrix is always generated and less variation to thermodynamically validated processes should occur due to this balancing. Better data availability related to subnational trade and consumption will also improve the reliability for PIOT generation.|$|R
