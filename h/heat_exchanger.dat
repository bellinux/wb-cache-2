5|$|Lower {{temperature}} LDRs (120–200°C) require pumping. They {{are common}} in extensional terrains, where heating takes place via deep circulation along faults, {{such as in the}} Western US and Turkey. Water passes through a <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> in a Rankine cycle binary plant. The water vaporizes an organic working fluid that drives a turbine. These binary plants originated in the Soviet Union in the late 1960s and predominate in new US plants. Binary plants have no emissions.|$|E
5|$|In 1892, America's first {{district}} heating system in Boise, Idaho was powered directly by geothermal energy, and was copied in Klamath Falls, Oregon in 1900. The first known {{building in the}} world to utilize geothermal energy as its primary heat source was the Hot Lake Hotel in Union County, Oregon, whose construction was completed in 1907. A deep geothermal well was used to heat greenhouses in Boise in 1926, and geysers were used to heat greenhouses in Iceland and Tuscany at about the same time. Charlie Lieb developed the first downhole <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> in 1930 to heat his house. Steam and hot water from geysers began heating homes in Iceland starting in 1943.|$|E

From these HPTPs the propellants take different routes through the engine. The oxidizer is split into four separate paths: to the oxidizer <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger,</b> which then splits into the oxidizer tank pressurization and pogo suppression systems; to the low pressure oxidizer turbopump (LPOTP); to the high pressure oxidizer preburner, from which it is split into the HPFTP turbine and HPOTP before being reunited in the hot gas manifold and sent on to the main combustion chamber (MCC); or directly into the main combustion chamber (MCC) injectors.|$|E
5|$|One {{method is}} to use the ground as a heat sink by drawing air through {{underground}} pipes. This is often done to provide a source of cool air for a building by means of a ground-coupled <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> (also known as Earth tubes), wherein condensation is typically regarded as a significant problem. A major problem with such designs is that the underground tubes are subject to contamination and difficult to keep clean. Designs of this type require air to be drawn through the pipes by a fan, but the power required may be provided (or supplemented) by a wind turbine.|$|E
5|$|Trough systems {{convert the}} heat from the sun into electricity. Because of their {{parabolic}} shape, trough collectors can focus the sun at 30-60 times its normal intensity on a receiver pipe located along the focal line of the trough. Synthetic oil circulates through the pipe and captures this heat, reaching temperatures of 390°C (735°F). The hot oil is pumped to a generating station and routed through a <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> to produce steam. Finally, electricity is produced in a conventional steam turbine. The SEGS plants operate on natural gas on cloudy days or after dark, and natural gas provides 25% of the total output.|$|E

25|$|A <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> is {{a device}} used to {{transfer}} heat between a solid object and a fluid, or between {{two or more}} fluids.

The classic example of a <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> is found in an internal combustion engine in which a circulating fluid known as engine coolant flows through radiator coils and air flows past the coils, which cools the coolant and heats the incoming air. Another example is the heat sink, which is a passive <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> that transfers the heat generated by an electronic or a mechanical device to a fluid medium, often air or a liquid coolant.|$|E
