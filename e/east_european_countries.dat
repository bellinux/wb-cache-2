Germany is at the forefront of European states seeking to exploit the momentum of monetary union to advance the creation of a more unified and capable European political, defence and security apparatus. German Chancellor Schröder expressed an interest in a permanent seat for Germany in the UN Security Council, identifying France, Russia, and Japan as countries that explicitly backed Germany's bid.

25|$|NATO {{has added}} new members seven times since its {{founding}} in 1949, and since 2017 NATO has had 29 members. Twelve countries were part of the founding of NATO: Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Iceland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, the United Kingdom, and the United States. In 1952, Greece and Turkey became members of the Alliance, joined later by West Germany (in 1955) and Spain (in 1982). In 1990, with the reunification of Germany, NATO grew to include the former country of East Germany. Between 1994 and 1997, wider forums for regional cooperation between NATO and its neighbors were set up, including the Partnership for Peace, the Mediterranean Dialogue initiative and the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council. In 1997, three former Warsaw Pact countries, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Poland, were invited to join NATO. After this fourth enlargement in 1999, the Vilnius group of The Baltics and seven <b>East</b> <b>European</b> <b>countries</b> formed in May 2000 to cooperate and lobby for further NATO membership. Seven of these countries joined in the fifth enlargement in 2004. The Adriatic States Albania and Croatia joined in the sixth enlargement in 2009, Montenegro in 2017.|$|E

500|$|In September and October, the First Congress of Solidarity deliberated in Gdańsk. Wałęsa faced activist {{opposition}} and was barely elected {{chairman of the}} organization. The delegates passed a radical reform program in which the world [...] "social" [...] or [...] "socialized" [...] was repeated 150 times. The Congress issued a provocative call for workers in other <b>East</b> <b>European</b> <b>countries</b> to follow in Solidarity's footsteps. Locally authorized, increasingly [...] "political" [...] strikes continued. They were characterized as [...] "wildcats" [...] by Wałęsa, who desperately tried to impose discipline from the center and reach an accord with the state, meeting General Jaruzelski and Catholic Primate Józef Glemp on 4 November. At {{the time of the}} regime's re-energized efforts to reduce Solidarity's role, the Union had nearly ten million members — almost four times as many as the ruling party. Militant mood was displayed and unrealistic demands made at the meeting of the partially represented National Commission on 3 December, but the proceedings were wiretapped by the authorities, who broadcast the recordings previously manipulated to their advantage.|$|E
500|$|In {{his memoirs}} Hoxha recounts the {{apprehension}} {{he and others}} had about the post-Stalin leadership, just days after Stalin's death. [...] "The {{way in which the}} death of Stalin was announced and his funeral ceremony was organized created the impression... that many members of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union had been awaiting his death impatiently." [...] A meeting with Soviet leaders held in June that year further raised his suspicions about the intentions of the new leadership, as did a reduction in Soviet and Eastern Bloc aid to Albania early in 1954 as Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev [...] "seemed to believe that the high cost of aid to support Albania was not worth the return in terms of Soviet strategic interests in the country." [...] Reacting to early post-Stalin Soviet pressure on the <b>East</b> <b>European</b> <b>countries</b> to pursue economic and political reforms, Albania announced slight changes in planning priorities and some willingness to improve state relations with Yugoslavia as the Soviets were doing. There was also a reshuffling of political portfolios in line with the Soviet re-emphasis on the principle of collective leadership.|$|E

He hoped that this new union would become a counterweight to any potential imperialist intentions on the part of Russia or of Germany. Piłsudski argued [...] "There can be no independent Poland without an independent Ukraine", but he may have been more interested in Ukraine being split from Russia than in Ukrainians' welfare. He did not hesitate to use military force to expand the Polish borders to Galicia and Volhynia, crushing a Ukrainian attempt at self-determination in the disputed territories east of the Southern Bug River, which contained a significant Polish minority, who made up {{the majority of the population}} in cities like Lwów, in contrast to the Ukrainian majority in the countryside. Speaking of Poland's future frontiers, Piłsudski said: [...] "All that we can gain in the west depends on the Entente—on the extent to which it may wish to squeeze Germany," [...] while in the east, [...] "There are doors that open and close, and it depends on who forces them open and how far." [...] In the chaos to the east the Polish forces set out to expand there as much as feasible. On the other hand, Poland had no intention of joining the Western intervention in the Russian Civil War or of conquering Russia itself.|$|E
