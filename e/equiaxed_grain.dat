5000|$|As in {{conventional}} extrusion processes, in friction extrusion, a shape change is enforced on the charge by forcing its passage through a die. However, friction extrusion differs from conventional extrusion in several key ways. Critically, in the friction extrusion process, the extrusion charge (billet or other precursor) rotates {{relative to the}} extrusion die. In addition, similar to conventional extrusion, an extrusion force is applied so as to push the charge against the die. In practice either the die or the charge may rotate {{or they may be}} counter-rotating. The relative rotary motion between the charge and the die has several significant effects on the process. First, the relative motion in the plane of rotation leads to large shear stresses, hence, plastic deformation in the layer of charge in contact with and near the die. This plastic deformation is dissipated by recovery and recrystallization processes leading to substantial heating of the deforming charge. Because of the deformation heating, friction extrusion does not generally require preheating of the charge by auxiliary means potentially resulting in a more energy efficient process. Second, the substantial level of plastic deformation in the region of relative rotary motion can promote solid state welding of powders or other finely divided precursors, such as flakes and chips, effectively consolidating the charge (friction consolidation) prior to extrusion.  Scrolled features {{on the face of the}} die aid material flow into the extrusion orifice which can lead to order of magnitude reduction in extrusion force compared to conventional extrusions of equivalent cross section.  Third, the combined effects of elevated temperature and large levels of deformation normally lead the extrudate to have a relatively fine, <b>equiaxed,</b> <b>grain</b> structure which results from recrystallization after the conclusion of deformation: desirable crystallographic textures may also be created by the process and formation of nanocomposite structures are also possible. Based on the foregoing, it can be said that the essential controlled parameters in friction extrusion are typically: ...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{effects of}} strong {{magnetic}} fields on the columnar-to-equiaxed transition (CET) {{have been investigated}} experimentally. Six alloys have been directionally solidified at low growth speeds (1 - 10 mu m s(- 1)) under magnetic fields up to 10 T. Experimental {{results show that the}} application of a strong magnetic field causes a dendrite fragmentation and then the CET. The thermoelectric magnetic force acting on cells/dendrites and <b>equiaxed</b> <b>grains</b> in the mushy zone has been studied numerically. Numerical results reveal that the value of the thermoelectric magnetic force increases as the magnetic field intensity and the temperature gradient increase. A torque is created on cells/dendrites and <b>equiaxed</b> <b>grains.</b> This torque breaks cells/dendrites and drives the rotation of <b>equiaxed</b> <b>grains.</b> The rotation of <b>equiaxed</b> <b>grains</b> in the mushy zone will further destroy cells/dendrites. Thus, with the increase of the magnetic field intensity and the temperature gradient, the volume fraction of <b>equiaxed</b> <b>grains</b> in front of columnar dendrites increases. When the magnetic field intensity and the temperature gradient reach a critical value, the growth of columnar dendrites is blocked and the CET then occurs. The present work may initiate a new method of inducing the CET via an applied strong magnetic field during directional solidification. (C) 2012 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Abstract. Growth {{restriction}} {{plays an}} important role in grain refinement and is often linked with as-cast grain size of Al-Alloys.

Grain refining tests were conducted with the same inoculation of potent TiB 2 at a fixed level and free Titanium addition.
