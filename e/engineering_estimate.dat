Results show that the techniques of caustics in transmission when compared with photoelasticity under dynamic conditions give lower values for the stress intensity factor.

Maneuvers were conducted {{at a variety}} of flightpath angles. Conventional ground effect flight test methods were used, with the exception that space positioning data were obtained using the differential global positioning system (DGPS). Accuracy of the DGPS was similar to that of optical tracking methods, but it was operationally more attractive. The dynamic flight determined lift and drag coefficient increments were measurably lower than steady-state wind-tunnel predictions. This relationship is consistent with the results of other aircraft for which similar data are available. Trends in the flight measured lift increments caused by ground effect as a function of flightpath angle were evident but weakly correlated. An engineering model of dynamic ground effect was developed based on linear aerodynamic theory and super-positioning of flows.

40|$|The Maxwell-Stefan (M-S) {{formulation}} for {{binary mixture}} diffusion in micro-porous {{materials such as}} zeolites, metal organic frameworks (MOFs), and covalent organic frameworks (COFs), that have pore sizes typically smaller than 2 nm, is formulated {{in a manner that}} is consistent with corresponding description for meso-porous systems. The M-S equations are set up in terms of species concentrations, c(i), defined in terms of accessible pore volume space. Molecular dynamics simulations were carried out to determine the exchange coefficients D- 12 for a large variety of binary mixtures in zeolites (MFI, AFI, BEA, FAU, LTA, CHA, and DDR), MOFs (CuBTC, IRMOF- 1, Zn(bdc) dabco, Co(bdc) dabco, MIL- 47, Co-FA, Mn-FA, and Zn(tbip)), COFs (COF- 102, COF- 103, and COF- 108), and cylindrical silica pores of varying diameters. The exchange coefficients D- 12 in all structures were found to be related by a constant factor, F, with the corresponding M-S diffusivity for binary fluid mixture, D- 12 fl, at the same total mixture concentration, c(i), as within the pores. The factor F is primarily dictated by the degree of confinement of the guest molecules within the channels, defined as the ratio of the characteristic sizes of the guest molecules to that of the host channels. For meso-porous cylindrical silica pores: F = 1, and D- 12 = D- 12 fl. For CuBTC, MIL- 47, IRMOF- 1, and COFs, that have structures with a high fractional open space and channel dimensions of 0. 8 - 1. 85 nm, the factor F is found to be in the range 0. 55 - 0. 85.

40|$|Motor car {{crosswind}} stability can be {{adversely affected}} by reductions in both vehicle mass and drag coefficient. As these are two likely results of future developments the importance of research into vehicle aerodynamic stability is set to increase, moreover, {{there is evidence that}} transient effects will be the critical. An experimental facility has been designed and constructed and tests have been carried out to investigate the implications of simulating dynamic flow-fields. Vehicle models of approximately 1 / 6 th scale have been propelled along a test track, in the laboratory, to pass through a simulated crosswind gust of variable resultant yaw angle. Force and moment measurements have shown the aerodynamic inputs to be highly repeatable, though the technique has been restricted somewhat by the presence of mechanical "noise". Additional dynamic yaw experiments were conducted on a bluff-body model mounted in the College of Aeronautics' Oscillatory Facility. In some ways this technique is not as realistic as the Crosswind Track in its simulation of the full scale flow, however, despite its simplicity valuable aerodynamic data was derived from this test. Quasi-static tests have also been conducted and demonstrate that for certain model configurations a clearly defined yaw angle range exists where two different wake flow-structures are possible. At any given yaw angle, the dominant structure is determined by the flowfield history - essentially the direction in which the model is moved. This causes hysteresis in the forces and moments generated. In such a situation the flow is referred to as being bi¬stable. Both track and dynamic yaw tests indicate that the bi-stable flow phenomenon, witnessed in quasi-static experiments, can influence the dynamic forces and moments measured on a model. The flow structures associated with bi-stability are viscous-dominated and the slow development of viscous loads can be an important feature. It is possible that various vehicle configurations could induce bi-stable flow. If such flow behaviour is apparent then quasi-static forces and moment measurements will not provide an adequate <b>engineering</b> <b>estimate</b> of the transient aerodynamic loads. In this event it is imperative that the automotive engineer conducts investigations into the vehicle's dynamic performance...|$|E

40|$|Ballute {{hypersonic}} aerodynamic decelerators {{have been}} considered for aerocapture since the early 1980 's. Recent technology advances in fabric and polymer materials as well as analysis capabilities lend credibility to the potential of ballute aerocapture. The concept of the thin-film ballute for aerocapture shows the potential for large mass savings over propulsive orbit insertion or rigid aeroshell aerocapture. Several technology hurdles have been identified, including the effects of coupled fluid structure interaction on ballute performance and survivability. To date, no aeroelastic solutions of thin-film ballutes in an environment relevant to aerocapture have been published. In this investigation, an aeroelastic solution methodology is presented along with the analysis codes selected for each discipline. Variable-fidelity aerodynamic tools are used due to the long run times for computational fluid dynamics or direct simulation Monte Carlo analyses. The improved serial staggered method is used to couple the disciplinary analyses in a time-accurate manner, and direct node-matching is used for data transfer. In addition, an engineering approximation has been developed as an addition to modified Newtonian analysis to include the first-order effects of damping due to the fluid, providing a rapid dynamic aeroelastic analysis suitable for conceptual design. Static aeroelastic solutions of a clamped ballute on a Titan aerocapture trajectory are presented using non-linear analysis in a representative environment on a flexible structure. Grid convergence is demonstrated for both structural and aerodynamic models used in this analysis. Static deformed shape, drag and stress level are predicted at multiple points along the representative Titan aerocapture trajectory. Results are presented for verification and validation cases of the structural dynamics and simplified aerodynamics tools. Solutions match experiment and other validated codes well. Contributions of this research include {{the development of a}} tool for aeroelastic analysis of thin-film ballutes which is used to compute the first high-fidelity aeroelastic solutions of thin-film ballutes using inviscid perfect-gas aerodynamics.

40|$|For Phase 1 of this project, the Hopewell team {{developed}} a detailed {{design for the}} Small Scale Pilot-Scale Algal CO 2 Sequestration System. This pilot consisted of six (6) x 135 gallon cultivation tanks including systems for CO 2 delivery and control, algal cultivation, and algal harvesting. A feed tank supplied Hopewell wastewater to the tanks and a receiver tank collected the effluent from the algal cultivation system. The effect of environmental parameters and nutrient loading on CO 2 uptake and sequestration into biomass were determined. Additionally the cost of capturing CO 2 from an industrial stack emission at both pilot and full-scale was determined. The <b>engineering</b> <b>estimate</b> evaluated Amine Guard technology for capture of pure CO 2 and direct stack gas capture and compression. The study concluded that Amine Guard technology has lower lifecycle cost at commercial scale, although the cost of direct stack gas capture is lower at the pilot scale. Experiments conducted under high concentrations of dissolved CO 2 did not demonstrate enhanced algae growth rate. This result suggests that the dissolved CO 2 concentration at neutral pH was already above the limiting value. Even though dissolved CO 2 did not show {{a positive effect on}} biomass growth, controlling its value at a constant set-point during daylight hours can be beneficial in an algae cultivation stage with high algae biomass concentration to maximize the rate of CO 2 uptake. The limited enhancement of algal growth by CO 2 addition to Hopewell wastewater was due at least in part to the high endogenous CO 2 evolution from bacterial degradation of dissolved organic carbon present at high levels in the wastewater. It was found that the high level of bacterial activity was somewhat inhibitory to algal growth in the Hopewell wastewater. The project demonstrated that the Honeywell automation and control system, in combination with the accuracy of the online pH, dissolved O 2, dissolved CO 2, turbidity, Chlorophyll A and conductivity sensors is suitable for process control of algae cultivation in an open pond systems. This project concluded that the Hopewell wastewater is very suitable for algal cultivation but the potential for significant CO 2 sequestration from the plant stack gas emissions was minimal due to the high endogenous CO 2 generation in the wastewater from the organic wastewater content.
