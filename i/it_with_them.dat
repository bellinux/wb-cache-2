5|$|According to Kaneko, {{the reason}} for {{choosing}} the Judeo-Christian god, YHVH, as the game's antagonist, was that he saw YHVH as the base for all other gods around the world: Having observed common motives throughout different mythologies, such as the flood {{and the creation of}} the world, he reasoned that they all originated in one single mythology, which had been changed as people took <b>it</b> <b>with</b> <b>them,</b> leading to modern-day myths. He thought the original mythology would be the Old Testament, and therefore considered YHVH the folkloristic base of all gods. Despite casting YHVH as the antagonist, Kaneko noted that he did not intend for YHVH to be evil incarnate in Megami Tensei.|$|E
5|$|Alongside {{the second}} series of Life Begins, Bullen {{continued}} developing George the Third. The title {{was changed to}} It Happens until eventually settling on All About George in time for filming in 2005. All About George starred Rik Mayall as George Kinsey, a builder whose life is changed when six generations of his family move into his home. Initially excited about the series when he attended the cast read-throughs, Bullen's optimism waned {{by the time it}} was broadcast as he felt there were too many characters and the series' premise unclear. In a 2008 interview, he describes it as one of his worst TV series. Life Begins returned for a third and final series in 2006. The same year, filming commenced on Tripping Over, a series about intercontinental backpackers in 1976 and 2006. SeaChange writers Andrew Knight and Andrea Denholm conceived the idea in 2003 and asked Bullen, a friend of Knight's, to develop <b>it</b> <b>with</b> <b>them.</b> A co-production between Australia's Channel Ten and Britain's Five, Tripping Over was broadcast in both countries at the end of 2006.|$|E
5|$|The bell of the Nishi-Arai Daishi Temple in Tokyo {{was removed}} in 1943, to be melted down {{as part of}} the Japanese war effort. The crew of the USS Pasadena found it on a scrap heap and took <b>it</b> <b>with</b> <b>them</b> to the US as a war trophy, {{donating}} it to the city of Pasadena; the city council returned the bell to Tokyo in 1955. A similar story accompanies the bell of Manpuku-ji, which was taken to the United States on the USS Boston after the war; in this case, however, the Sendai authorities allowed the bell to remain in Boston as a symbol of friendship between the two cities. The Boston bell is the last WWII bonsh≈ç in the United States.|$|E

25|$|Two Spanish friars, Brothers Gabriel de Fontaned and Guillermo de Rigosa {{traveled}} to Rome {{to meet the}} Pope for the approval of their order (The Order of Minims for the Service of the Sick or The Order of Saint Francis of Paola). As they were passing through the town of Traigueras (under the jurisdiction of Tortosa in the Principate of Catalonia), a furious storm descended upon them. The brothers prayed for God's guidance and help. Immediately they saw a mysterious light coming from a cave in a cliff. Climbing up, they entered and found a beautiful statue of the Virgin Mary holding the Baby Jesus in her arms. They reported being surrounded by shimmering lights and fragrant scents. As no one claimed the statue, the two carried <b>it</b> <b>with</b> <b>them,</b> hoping that the Blessed Mother would help in getting approval for their order.|$|E
25|$|The {{advent of}} the Second World War brought extreme {{hardship}} for the Horiuchis. They lived far enough inland {{that they were not}} subject to forced relocation, but all Japanese were immediately fired by Union Pacific and evicted from company housing. People of Japanese ancestry were often physically threatened, and denied decent work and housing. The Horiuchis were forced to live in a homemade trailer much of the time, while Paul worked various temporary, menial jobs. Unable to carry <b>it</b> <b>with</b> <b>them,</b> and fearing it would get them in trouble with the authorities, Horiuchi burned his collection of old Japanese books and prints; a collection of twenty-five of his best paintings, left with a friend, was destroyed in a flood. At one point, the family applied for placement in a relocation camp (a not uncommon occurrence for desperate Japanese-Americans seeking shelter and food), but were denied.|$|E

25|$|The {{story in}} the Vishnu Purana goes that Durvasa, while {{wandering}} the earth {{in a state of}} ecstasy due to a vow he was observing, came by a Vidyadhari(a nymph of the air) and demanded of her a heavenly wreath of flowers she was wearing. The nymph respectfully gave the garland to the sage, whereupon he wore it on his brow. Resuming his wanderings, the sage came across Indra riding his elephant, Airavata, attended by the gods. Durvasa, still in his state of frenzy, threw the garland at Indra, who caught it and placed it on Airavata's head. The elephant was irritated by the fragrance of the nectar in the flowers, so it threw the garland to the ground with its trunk. Durvasa was enraged to see his gift treated so callously and cursed Indra that he would be cast down from his position of dominion over the three worlds, just as the garland was cast down. Indra immediately begged Durvasa's forgiveness, but the sage refused to retract or even soften his curse and went on his way. Because of the curse, Indra and the devas were diminished in strength and shorn of their lustre. Seizing this opportunity, the asuras led by Bali waged war against the gods. The gods were routed and turned to Brahma for help. Brahma directed them to seek refuge with Vishnu. Vishnu in turn, advised them to call a truce with the asuras and work together with them to churn the ocean of milk and obtain the Amrita (nectar of immortality), on the pretext of sharing <b>it</b> <b>with</b> <b>them.</b> Vishnu promised that he would ensure only the devas drank the Nectar and obtained immortality so they could once again defeat the asuras. The devas took Vishnu's advice and called their truce with the asuras and thus did the gods and demons begin planning their great enterprise.|$|E

Two smaller South African columns came from the Cape and the Orange Free State (the latter coming over the deserts of Bechuanaland).
