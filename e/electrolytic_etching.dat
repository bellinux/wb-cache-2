40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{research on}} a novel method of microfabrication of titanium (Ti) biomedical devices. The aim of the work {{was to develop a}} commercial process to fabricate Ti in a more environmentally friendly manner than current chemical etching techniques. The emphasis was placed on <b>electrolytic</b> <b>etching,</b> which enables the replacement of hazardous hydrofluoric acid-based etchants that are used by necessity when using Photochemical Machining (PCM) to produce intricate features in sheet Ti on a mass scale. Titanium is inherently difficult to etch (it is designed for its corrosion-resistant attributes) and as a result, Hydrofluoric acid (HF) is used in combination with a strong and durable mask to achieve selective etching. The use of HF introduces serious health and safety implications for those working with the process. The new technique introduces the use of a “sandwich structure”, comprising anode/insulator/cathode, directly in contact with each other and placed in an <b>electrolytic</b> <b>etching</b> cell. In this technique the same photolithography process is utilised to achieve selective etching on a metal substrate as in the PCM process. However, for the <b>electrolytic</b> <b>etching</b> stage, the inter- electrode gap (IEG) is reduced significantly from a few centimetres, as usually applied in electrochemical processes, to 4 μm. The intention behind this was to improve the current distribution experienced at the anode (Ti) during subsequent <b>electrolytic</b> <b>etching.</b> The sandwich structure was developed by deposition of a photoresist S 1818 and Copper (Cu) on top of Ti. Firstly, a manual sanding of the substrate was applied in order to eliminate the oxide layers which could strongly affect a final <b>electrolytic</b> <b>etching.</b> The soft- and hard-bake stages involved in the processing of the S 1818 resist were optimised to produce a stress-free Ti/S 1818 /Cu/S 1818 structure. Ultimately a pattern would be imparted onto the S 1818 /Cu/S 1818 that would ultimately be imparted through to the Ti layer during the last stage, <b>electrolytic</b> <b>etching.</b> In order to achieve this, a Cu electroless deposition was developed as a technique to obtain a conductive film which would act as a cathode during the <b>electrolytic</b> <b>etching</b> of the target, Ti layer. The results of the <b>electrolytic</b> <b>etching</b> of the Ti sandwich structure revealed flat-base profiles of half-etched (“half-etch” is the term used to signify an etch that does not penetrate completely through the thickness of the metal sheet) micro-holes in the Ti layer. The problem of delamination of the electroless Cu, in 10 % w/v HCl electrolyte used as an etchant, was solved by electroplating a 12 μm layer of Cu on top of the 60 nm Cu electroless deposited film. Using this technique, micro-features were achieved in Ti. The half-etched micro-holes were characterised to have an overall spherical shape corresponding to the imaged pattern and a preferred flat-base profiles (typically a raised land of material arises in conventional <b>electrolytic</b> <b>etching).</b> A series of parameters were tested in order to control the process of <b>electrolytic</b> <b>etching</b> through the Ti sandwich structure by measuring etch rate, surface roughness of the etched pattern and the etch factor. The applied current densities (CD) of 10, 15, 20, and 25 A/cm 2 showed proportional dissolution to the applied current. <b>Electrolytic</b> <b>etching</b> with a CD of 20 A/cm 2 demonstrated a high etch rate of 40 μm/min. and a relatively low Ra of 2. 8 μm, therefore, it was utilised in further experimental work. The highest etch rate of 50 μm/min. and an improved distribution of half-etched micro-holes was achieved by the introduction of 4 crocodile connectors (2 per electrode) and mechanically stirring of the electrolyte (800 rpm) while performing the <b>electrolytic</b> <b>etching.</b> The maximum etch depth of 143. 9 μm was produced in Ti when the <b>electrolytic</b> <b>etching</b> was performed at the same conditions for 3 minutes. The incorporation of ultrasonic agitation to the <b>electrolytic</b> <b>etching</b> and an electrolyte temperature of 130 C resulted in a decrease of the surface roughness of the etched micro-holes to 0. 5 μm. The results of the Ti sandwich structure <b>electrolytic</b> <b>etching</b> proved the concept of minimising the IEG in order to obtain a uniform Ti dissolution on a feature scale, improved control of the electrolytic dissolution over the whole area of the sample with utilisation of the lower hazard etchant at the same time...|$|E

A diode fabrication process for submicron diodes with near-ideal electrical and noise characteristics is described. This process {{is based on the}} <b>electrolytic</b> pulse <b>etching</b> of GaAs in combination with an in-situ platinum plating for the formation of the Schottky contacts. Schottky barrier diodes with a diameter of 1 micron fabricated by the process have already shown excellent results in a 650 GHz waveguide mixer at room temperature. A conversion loss of 7. 5 dB and a mixer noise temperature of less than 2000 K have been obtained at an intermediate frequency of 4 GHz. The optimization of the diode structure and the technology was possible due {{to the development of a}} generalized Schottky barrier diode model which is valid also at high current densities. The common diode design and optimization is discussed on the basis of the classical theory. However, the conventional fomulas are valid only in a limited forward bias range corresponding to currents much smaller than the operating currents under submillimeter mixing conditions. The generalized new model takes into account not only the phenomena occurring at the junction such as current dependent recombination and drift/diffusion velocities, but also mobility and electron temperature variations in the undepleted epi-layer. Calculated diode I/V and noise characteristics are in excellent agreement with the measured values.

40|$|A biased-diffusion-limited erosion {{model is}} {{suggested}} {{to study the}} effects of bias fields on the formation of a Laplacian front. In the model, a particle undergoes drifted-diffusive motion before it reaches a surface of the material and erodes the surface by interacting chemically with a material particle at the surface. We have found three regimes for the dynamical surface structure. When there is attractive bias to the interface, the critical property of the surface belongs to a universality class with a dynamic exponent z = 2. When there is no bias or a relativley small repulsive bias, the critical property belongs to a universality class with z = 1. The models with large repulsive bias do not show any surface roughening behavior. From these results, the relevance of physically important terms in the growth equation are also discussed. Diffusion-limited erosion (DLE) [1], which is the time-reversed process of diffusion-limited deposition (or ag-gregation) [2], was suggested as a theoretical model for diverse processes, such as <b>electrolytic</b> polishing, corro-sion, <b>etching,</b> and stable fluid invasion in the regime of high capillary numbers [3 – 5] and as a way to study the destabilizing effects for the solidification front [6]. After the original suggestion [1], DLE was found to be the-oretically important because it can be the model for a stable Laplacian front [4, 5] and furthermore, the surface evolution of DLE can be described by the linear growth equation with dynamic exponent z = 1. Here, Lapla-cian fronts mean have the following meaning. Let’s con-sider a d-dimensional system of linear extension L in the d||(= d− 1) transverse coordinates x| | = (x 1, x 2, [...] ., xd||). Then, the front or the surface can be parametrized by a single-valued height function xd = h(x||, t), and a Lapla-cian field φ(x, t), which satisfies ∇ 2 φ = 0 for xd> h and φ = 0 for xd ≤ h, can be introduced.

The p-type SiC oxida-tion data are added in Table III for comparison. <b>Electrolytic</b> <b>etching</b> in a 2 : 1 mixture {{of alcohol and}} 40 % HF is mainly used for the delineation of p+p- and n+n- junct ions and for those p-n junctions where both sides are very lightly doped. The delineation which is accomplished partly by surface attack and partly by sLaining may be markedly enhanced by a subsequent oxidation. Thus, the combination of electrolytic etch-ing and oxidation {{has been found to}} be successful for the delineation of all junctions of practical interest. Furthermore, the existence of doping inhomogeneities can be revealed by this technique. Figure 3 shows an angle lap of an n-type pitaxial SiC layer on an n-type substrate. It is clearly seen that there are impurity striations in the substrate whereas the doping of the epitaxial layer is uniform. In conclusion, it can be stated that the thermal oxidation of silicon carbide is a useful tool for polytype discrimination. An unambiguous determination of the polytype (6 H or 15 R), however, is possible only in those cases where the dependence of the oxidation rate on the conductivity type and the doping level is neg-ligible or can be taken into account properly.

40|$|This project {{studied the}} {{inclusion}} behavior {{before and after}} reoxidation. It focuses on the changes in inclusion size distributions and the mechanism by which reoxidation changes inclusion chemistries. This study examined the behavior of inclusions in laboratory heats after deoxidation with 0. 1 wt% Al, Ca treatment, and reoxidation. MgO and Al 2 O 3 crucibles were employed in the experiments to track the evolution of MgAlO 4 spinel inclusions and Al 2 O 3 inclusions. For both crucibles, experiments with different Ca and S level and 100 ppm O additions were attempted. Samples were taken at various points after the different additions were made up to 20 minutes after reoxidation. Automated SEM/EDS microanalysis was {{used to analyze the}} inclusions detected on polished cross sections and inclusion compositions were studied over this time span. Size distributions were analyzed by calculating population density functions (PDF) of spinels, alumina and calcium aluminate formed at different time and compared to confirm the mechanism of inclusion formation. <b>Electrolytic</b> <b>etching</b> was performed on the sample surface and the morphology of inclusions was observed by manual SEM/EDS. After reoxidation new Al 2 O 3 and/or spinel (MgAl 2 O 4) inclusions formed. The inclusions that were present from deoxidation and Ca treatment became richer in Al 2 O 3. The presence of excess CaS was found to decrease the amount of oxides that formed upon reoxidation. The shape of PDFs could be used to identify inclusions that formed due to reoxidation. Several suggested mechanisms for the inclusion chemistry and size distribution mechanisms are presented...|$|E
40|$|Duplex {{stainless}} steel is a Ferritic(BCC) -Austenitic(FCC) steel, covers {{the advantages of}} both Austenitic and Ferritic Stainless steels. They having good mechanical and corrosion resistance properties are widely used in many industries like chemical plants, refineries for critical equipments such as pressure vessels, heatexchangers, water heaters. Major problem occurs with duplex steels when they are worked or heated above about temperature of 280 °C. Detrimental phases like Sigma, Chi, Laves and Alpha prime form when the Duplex steels are treated above this temperature and they retard the properties of Duplex {{stainless steel}}s. They also cause embrittlement above temperature of 475 °C called “ 475 °C embrittlement”. During welding of duplex steels, Secondary austenite also forms, which {{is also one of}} the harmful phases in duplex steels. Among all of these phases, Sigma (σ) is extremely harmful to the corrosion resistance of steel. Due to these limitations duplexgrades are not used above certain temperature ranges. In this experimental work a plate of duplex grade 2205 in hot worked condition was procured from TCR Advanced Engineering Pvt. Ltd., GIDC, Vadodara. Initially chemical composition of the plate was checked with emission spectrometer, tensile test and hardness tests werecarried out for comparing with the standard data. As there was no Sigma phase detected when tested with ASTM 930 in the received sample, Sigma phase was intentionally produced by giving heat treatment in the range of 700 - 850 °C. Sigma phases were quantified with ASTM 930 practice A, by <b>electrolytic</b> <b>etching</b> with 40 % NaOH. The effect of Sigma phase on corrosion resistance was measured by ASTM G 48. The pitting corrosion resistance was evaluated in terms of average pit depth and overall corrosion rate...|$|E
40|$|This report {{summarizes}} the research accomplishments under the Atomic Energy Commission contracts, CALT- 473 and CALT- 767 -P 3 b for the ten-year period, November 1, 1963 to October 31, 1973. The research was stimulated by technological advances which required improvements {{in our ability}} to predict the deformation behavior of materials. In the mid 1930 's, theoreticians first recognized that crystal defects could {{play a central role in}} plastic deformation, and since that time a number of experiments have conclusively demonstrated the one-to-one correspondence between the motion of line defects (dislocations) and plastic deformation. Before the existence and significance of dislocations was recognized, theoreticians faced a puzzling problem: the predicted strength of crystals was several orders of magnitude larger than the strength actually observed. With the realization that crystal deformation is caused by the motion of dislocations, the theoretical problem reversed. The new problem became one of understanding the origin of the resistance to dislocation motion in order to explain the observed strength of crystals. The Atomic Energy Commission Sponsored Research on dislocation mobility and density in metallic crystals at the California Institute of Technology has focused on an understanding of the dynamics of dislocations. Important interactions between a moving dislocation and lattice phonons, conduction electrons, other dislocations, and point defects such as those introduced by neutron irradiation have been studied. The experimental phase of this research involved the introduction of isolated dislocations into a crystal, the observation of these dislocations by chemical or <b>electrolytic</b> <b>etching,</b> X-ray topography, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM); the application of appropriate stresses of controlled amplitude and duration, and finally determination of the stress-induced motion of the dislocations by observation of their new locations. The nature of the resistance to dislocation motion is deduced from these experiments...|$|E
40|$|Conventional photoetching {{processes}} {{used for}} thin film patterning of tungsten involve photolithography and chemical etching processes which use toxic etchants like potassium ferricyanide and hydrofluoric acid. Through-mask electrochemical micromachining (EMM) of thin films avoids {{the use of}} toxic chemicals by using <b>electrolytic</b> <b>etching,</b> but photolithography processes are still required. Jet EMM uses an unsubmerged electrolyte jet that flows through a micro-sized nozzle cathode and impinges onto the anode workpiece. Patterning is achieved by moving the workpiece. Jet EMM eliminates the photolithography step and uses less toxic chemicals. ^ To investigate jet EMM of tungsten, the anodic dissolution of tungsten was studied using a rotating disk electrode (RDE) cell. The metal dissolution rate, current efficiency and surface brightness during anodic dissolution of tungsten {{as a function of}} the electrolyte composition, applied potential, and hydrodynamic conditions were found. For tungsten dissolution, NaOH solution was found to be the most suitable electrolyte. The surface finish is mass transfer controlled by the diffusion of OH- to the anode. ^ NaOH solution was exclusively used in the jet EMM experiments. Jet EMM uses high flow rate impinging electrolytes which produce high mass transfer rates that lead to high rates of micromachining. The effects of various factors such as flow velocity and nozzle diameter on the feature of machined holes were examined. The machined holes are tapered, the back hole is about the size of the nozzle, and the size of the front hole is a function of sample thickness and nozzle diameter. In addition to machining on various thickness of tungsten foils, jet electrochemical micromachining of back-insulated tungsten foils and tungsten coated silicon wafers were also examined. ^ Mass transport controlled finite element modeling of jet EMM was used to investigate the effect of system variables on hole shape. Various flow velocities and gap distances were investigated. Flat and cavity impingement surfaces were examined. The mass transfer at the sidewall of the cavity was found to be higher than at the bottom or a flat surface. Comparisons of hole profile between the experimental jet EMM and modeled results were made. ...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{proposes to}} use {{high-strength}} corrosion-resistant maraging steels, which were developed for aircraft industry instead of carbon steel with coating to improve operation {{properties of the}} forcemeasuring resilient member in electronic strain-gauge balance. It examines the possibility to apply the martensitic-aging steels of Fe-Cr-Ni-Mo-Ti (ЭП 678) and Fe-Cr-Ni-Mo-Cu-Nb (ЭП 817) alloying systems. It was shown, that a traditional heat strain-hardening treatment including hardening and overageing of this steels provides combination of durability viscosity and corrosion- resistance, {{but at the same}} time it increases nonelastic effects and lowers the limit of elasticity because of reversing austenite formation. In this connection, it was proposed to use hardening with double aging i. e. main and low-temperature aging with no austenite formation as heat strainhardening treatment of steels for force-measuring resilient member. The goal of this work was to study the influence of double aging on the structure and properties of ЭП 678 (06 Х 14 Н 6 Д 2 МБТ) and ЭП 817 (03 Х 111 Н 10 М 2 Т) steels. The modes of double aging for ЭП 817 steel were conformed to 4500 С + 400 0 С and 475 0 С+ 400 0 С, for ЭП 678 steel – 530 0 С + 500 0 С. The structure and properties of hardened steels after main and double aging were compared. Metallographic analysis of samples after <b>electrolytic</b> <b>etching</b> was conducted with Leitz Metallovert microscope while the CamScan 4 DV raster electronic microscope was used for Microroentgen-spectral analysis. The quantity of austenite was controlled with computerized setting DRON- 4, the hardness was measured with ТК- 2 М instrument, corrosion-resistance was estimated with polarized curves, which were taken using a П- 5848 potentiostat. The conducted research has shown, that double aging causes the additional hardening of steels due to disintegration of martensite and formation of dispersed Cu – corpuscles in ЭП 817 steel and of Ni 3 Ti in ЭП 678 steel. At the same time, it was established that additional disintegration of martensite influences on the corrosive properties of steels in a variety of ways. The experiments have proved that double aging deteriorates the corrosion-resistance of ЭП 678 steel, leads to the sharp increase of corrosion current on cathode and anode polarization curves due to formation of nonuniform structure. According to experimentally obtained data, the corrosion-resistance of ЭП 817 steel after double aging, on the contrary, was improved i. e. the corrosion current was essentially reduced and there was no phase of disastrous dissolution on polarization curves. It was proved that there are two reasons for enhancement of corrosion-resistance, namely a surface "refinement" owing to a cathode formation of Cu – corpuscles with respect to the chrome-nickel matrix and their more uniform allocation, thus facilitating to formation of uniform protective passive skin on the surface. Thus, the results of conducted research have shown that the double aging due to additional disintegration of martensite is an effective way to hardening of maraging steels, which are used for making the force-measuring resilient member. It was established, that the effect of double aging on corrosion properties is determined with the nature of strain-hardening stages: the corrosion-resistance is improved if the formation stage is the cathode in respect to matrix. Conversively, the corrosion-resistance is worsened because of increased extent of structure heterogeneity. Obtained data can be used with a complex approach to the choice of the material and modes of heat strain-hardening treatment of maraging steels for force-measuring resilient member to provide the required values of elasticity and corrosion-resistance limit. It was proved, that maraging ЭП 817 steel has an advantage over ЭП 678 steel in corrosion-resistance and may be recommended for making a forcemeasuring resilient member. </p...|$|E
