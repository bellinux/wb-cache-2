40|$|This study {{examines}} consensus formation {{processes in the}} development of aquatic marine environmental education programs aimed at the creation of SATO-KAWA, bountiful rivers using aquatic life in the Hei River Basin after 3. 11 Tsunami. Those processes are promoted primarily by local residents, as verified from "Project Design and Evaluation" viewpoints. Aquatic marine environmental education programs are discussed based on consensus formation. From the discussion, the following ideas for four programs were proposed: (1) Exploration of the riverhead of the Hei River flowing into Miyako Bay, which is close to the riverhead of Yanagawa River flowing into Morioka; (2) Appreciation of the <b>Cherry</b> <b>salmon</b> video images; (3) Understanding of the fish-eating culture in the Hei River Basin while tasting <b>Cherry</b> <b>salmon</b> caught in the Hei River Basin; and (4) Setting a scene for talking about <b>Cherry</b> <b>salmon</b> to reinforce recognition of <b>Cherry</b> <b>salmon.</b> Tsuyoshi Sasaki: Department of Marine Science and Technology, Tokyo University of Marine Science and Technolog...|$|R
