40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} {{the influence of}} intraoperative <b>infusion</b> <b>bottle</b> height {{on the power of}} refilled pig lenses. Setting: Research Laboratory, Pharmacia Intraocular Lens Manufacturing Plant, Groningen, The Netherlands. Methods: This study comprised 2 groups of pig eyes. In 1 group, the lens was refilled with silicone oil using a plug to close the capsulorhexis; in the other group, no plug was used. The anterior chamber depth, lens thickness, and vitreous chamber depth were measured by A-scan ultrasound. The total refraction was measured with a Hartinger refractometer. Measurements were performed with the <b>infusion</b> <b>bottle</b> at 0 cm, 25 cm, 50 cm, 75 cm, and 100 cm above eye level. Calculations using a model eye were performed to {{evaluate the}} change in lens power based on empirical data. Results: The mean change in the power of refilled lenses caused by varying the height of the <b>infusion</b> <b>bottle</b> was 1. 8 diopters. Lenses refilled with a plug had a thickness similar to that of natural lenses. Lenses refilled without a plug were significantly thinner (P Conclusions: During lens refilling, <b>infusion</b> <b>bottle</b> height influenced the resulting lens power. Using a plug to close the capsulorhexis resulted in refilled lens dimensions {{similar to those of the}} natural lens. (C) 2003 ASCRS and ESCR...|$|E
40|$|Purpose. To {{investigate}} the optimal strategy for surgical management of traumatic cataract with posterior capsular rupture. Methods. We describe four cases of traumatic cataract with posterior capsular rupture and an in vitro model built {{to evaluate the}} optimal infusion pressure during surgery. Results. All patients underwent cataract surgery. By using an anterior chamber maintainer to elevate infusion pressure, we safely performed cataract extraction without phacoemulsification. At 3 days after surgery, visual acuity was greater than 20 / 25 in all patients, without any complications. Phacoemulsification would also be feasible under anterior chamber maintainer infusion in a similar case of traumatic cataract with posterior capsular rupture during intravitreal injection. In addition, an in vitro model that we established using pig’s eyes revealed that the anterior chamber remained stable when the height of <b>infusion</b> <b>bottle</b> was 50 – 90 [*]mmHg, whereas shallowing of the anterior chamber occurred when the height of <b>infusion</b> <b>bottle</b> was reduced to 40 [*]mmHg, and corneal edema occurred when the height of <b>infusion</b> <b>bottle</b> was raised to 100 [*]mmHg. Conclusions. During management of traumatic cataract with posterior capsular rupture, using an anterior chamber maintainer to maintain optimal infusion pressure may {{reduce the risk of}} anterior hyaloid membrane breakup and vitreous loss...|$|E

40|$|The {{presence}} of DEHP in dialysis and infusion sets {{for peritoneal dialysis}} and parenteral nutrition, which are made of PVC and other plastic polymeric materials, were investigated. Phthalate determination {{was carried out by}} gas chromatography - mass spectrometry method (GC-MS). The results showed that the peritoneal dialysis set (bag and tubing) made of PVC contains DEHP in significant amount, about 31 - 34 %. Solution for peritoneal dialysis which was stored in the investigated PVC bag, contains low amount of DEHP, about 3. 72 μg dm- 3. <b>Infusion</b> <b>bottles</b> which are made of LDPE, also contain DEHP but in lower amount than PVC bags. LDPE bottle for packaging physiological saline solution (0. 9 % NaCl) showed higher amount of DEHP than LDPE bottle for packaging Ringer’s solution.

40|$|Objective: Clear corneal {{cataract}} incisions without sutures {{allow for}} rapid visual rehabilitation after phaco-emulsification but might {{be associated with}} an increased risk of postoperative infection. The goal {{of this study was to}} examine in vitro dynamic changes in unhealed clear corneal cataract incisions that might adversely affect the risk of intraocular infection. Design: Laboratory investigation. Methods: Self-sealing clear corneal incisions were created in cadaveric human and rabbit eyes, and intraocular pressure was controlled with an infusion cannula. Incisions were imaged in real time using optical coherence tomography as intraocular pressure was varied. Using an artificial anterior chamber, India ink was applied to the surface of cadaveric human corneas with clear corneal incisions to detect possible flow of surface fluid along the incision. Intraocular pressure was varied by raising and lowering the <b>infusion</b> <b>bottle</b> so as to simulate the variation in intraocular pressure that would occur with successive blinks. Results: Optical coherence tomography demonstrated variation of corneal wound morphology in response to changes in intraocular pressure. Higher intraocular pressures were associated with close apposition of the wound edges, with no tendency for wound leakage. At low intraocular pressures, however, wound edges tended to gape, starting at the internal aspect of the wound. One incision opened along the entire length, allowing flui...|$|E
40|$|Between 1 July 1970 and April 1971, in many {{hospitals}} in this country, there were outbreaks of nosocomial septicemia caused by Enterobacter cloacae of E. agglomerans (formerly Erwinia, herbicola-lathyri). All of these hospitals used infusion {{products manufactured by}} one company, Abbott Laboratories, and all affected patients had onset of septicemia while receiving the company's infusion products. Septicemia was epidemiologically and microbiologically traced to intrinsic contamination of the company's screw-cap closure for <b>infusion</b> <b>bottles</b> which was sealed with a newly introduced elastomer liner. Epidemic organisms were isolated from these closures. Investigations both in the laboratory and in the manufacturing plant into the mechanism of contamination of these products revealed the following. (i) Epidemic strains were present in numerous areas throughout the manufacturing plants. (ii) Viable microorganisms gained access to the interior of screw-cap closures after the autoclave step of production. (iii) Cooling closures actively drew moisture through the thread interstices into the inner-most depths of the closure. (iv) Transfer of contaminants from closures to fluid was easily effected by simple manipulations duplicating normal in-hospital use. (v) The red-rubber liner used in the company's screw-cap closures before the introduction of elastomer contained a broad-spectrum antimicrobial inhibitor. The findings from this epidemic and the associated {{studies show that the}} screw-cap closure as it is now designed cannot be considered secure for products that must remain sterile...|$|R
40|$|The glucose {{substitutes}} fructose, sorbitol and xylitol {{are still}} {{widely used in}} parenteral nutrition throughout central Europe. Their main advantage, {{which has led to}} their widespread use, is their diminished blood glucose raising effect and the absence of a browning reaction during sterilization with amino acids. During infusions with glucose substitutes in severely ill patients with glucose intolerance it is sometimes possible to avoid insulin therapy since the first steps in the metabolism of these carbohydrates are insulin-independent. These advantages are less relevant today since fat emulsions frequently replace some of the glucose given as energy substrate in parenteral nutrition and glucose intolerance is easier to monitor and to treat. - Specific advantages of xylitol are proposed, but this issue needs further clarification. The major objection to fructose, and therefore also to sorbitol, which is metabolized via fructose, is the life-threatening risk in patients with hereditary fructose intolerance. This congenital disorder affects 1 in 21, 000 and there have been more than twelve severe complications due to these solutions, most of which were lethal. All the complications occurred in German-speaking countries where fructose and sorbitol are most widely used in parenteral nutrition. Experience over the years has demonstrated that a history of fructose intolerance cannot be obtained, and warning labels on <b>infusion</b> <b>bottles</b> do not avoid this complication. The central European countries are isolated with regard to their use of fructose and sorbitol containing infusion fluids, which involve doubtful advantages but documented lethal risks. Therefore, fructose and sorbitol containing infusion fluids have no further place in our hospital pharmacies...|$|R
50|$|Imipenem {{is rapidly}} {{degraded}} by the renal enzyme dehydropeptidase if administered alone (making it less effective); the metabolites can cause kidney damage.Imipenem is a broad-spectrum betalactam antibiotic used for severe bacterial infections caused by susceptible organisms. Because imipenem is rapidly inactivated by renal dehydropeptidase I, it {{is given in}} combination with cilastatin, a DHP-I inhibitor which increases half-life and tissue penetration of imipenem. Imipenem/cilastatin, like other carbapenems, binds to bacterial penicillin-binding proteins and interferes with bacterial cell wall integrity and synthesis. It has activity against many aerobic and anaerobic Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms, including Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, S. agalactiae, S. viridans- group streptococci, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Bacteroides fragilis and Peptostreptococcus species. Imipenem/cilastatin was approved {{for use in the}} United States in 1985. Imipenem/cilastatin is indicated for the treatment of severe or complicated skin, tissue, joint, respiratory tract, intra-abdominal, urinary tract and urogenital infections, but not meningitis (as it does not pass through the blood brain barrier), endocarditis, and sepsis due to susceptible organisms. Its use is generally restricted to severe infections largely in hospitalized patients. The recommended dosage is 250 mg to 1 gram given intravenously every 6 to 8 hours or in intramuscular doses of no more than 1.5 gm daily, usually for five to 14 days. It is commercially available as Primaxin as 250-mg or 500-mg <b>infusion</b> <b>bottles</b> for IV use or 500-mg or 750-mg vials of lyophilized powder for IM injection. The most common side effects of imipenem are diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, skin rash, pruritus, and injection-site reactions.|$|R

The influence of formulation factors and storage conditions on the sorption of nitroglycerin, isosorbide dinitrate and another organic nitrate compound, ethylene glycol dinitrate, by plastic infusion equipment was studied. The extent of loss during simulated infusions was also found to be dependent on flow rate of drug solution through the giving set. The sorption of nitroglycerin and isosorbide dinitrate has clinical and pharmacokinetic significance. Losses of nitroglycerin and isosorbide dinitrate associated with their infusion through plastic Lnfusion equipment were minimised by infusing drug solutions from a glass syringe through high density polyethylene tubing.

40|$|Objective The aim of {{this study}} was to present and {{evaluate}} the efficacy and safety of a newly designed multifunctional retinal membrane twister in vitreoretinal surgery for the management of diabetic epiretinal membrane in patients with advanced proliferative diabetic retinopathy by evaluating the anatomical and the functional outcomes of the surgery. Design This was designed as an interventional study. Patients and methods Fifty-two eyes of 52 patients (23 – 71 years) attending the Research Institute of Ophthalmology with advanced proliferative diabetic retinopathy were included in this study. All patients underwent standard three-port 20 -G pars plana vitrectomy and membrane dissection with local anesthesia by means of a newly designed multifunctional retinal twister to peel and remove the proliferative membrane. Phacoemulsification was required in 11 patients at the beginning of the surgery. Relaxing retinectomy was performed in two cases because of severe retinal shortening. At the end of the surgery a silicone oil 5000 -centistoke tamponade was used in all patients without supplementary scleral buckle. The primary and final anatomic success rate, incidence of retinal breaks, intraoperative instrument-related complications, duration of surgery, postoperative intraocular pressure, retinal reattachment rate, and final visual acuity were recorded and analyzed. The patients were evaluated postoperatively on the first day, first week, then weekly for 1 month, and monthly thereafter and were followed up for 10 – 24 months (15. 5  ±  8. 8 months). Results The retinal twister was successful in managing the intravitreal and epiretinal membranes in all cases. Among the 52 patients, 22 (42. 3 %) were male and 30 (57. 7 %) were female. The mean age of the male patients was 48  ±  13 years and the mean age of the female patients was 41. 8  ±  10. 8 years. Eighteen patients (34. 6 %) had type I insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and 34 patients (65. 4 %) had type II non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Eight patients (15. 4 %) were pseudophakic, 11 patients (21 %) had cataract, and 33 patients (63. 4 %) had a clear lens. Panretinal laser photocoagulation had been performed before surgery in 19 eyes (36. 5 %); the remaining 33 eyes (63. 5 %) had undergone no previous laser treatment. Fourteen patients (26. 9 %) had been previously given an antivascular endothelial growth factor intravitreal injection. Twenty patients (38. 5 %) had tractional RD, three patients (5. 8 %) had combined tractional and rhegmatogenous RD, six patients (11. 5 %) had proliferative diabetic membrane without RD, and 23 patients (44. 2 %) had nonresolving vitreous hemorrhage and TRD. Pars plana vitrectomy was combined with phacoemulsification and intraocular lens implantation in 11 eyes (21 %). The mean surgical time was 70  ±  6. 5  min (range =  60 – 90  min). Intraocular bleeding was encountered during the peeling process and was rapidly managed by elevating the <b>infusion</b> <b>bottle</b> and using the bipolar diathermy attached to the twister. Inadvertent very small iatrogenic retinal breaks were encountered in seven cases (13. 5 %) during the peeling process of severely adherent epiretinal membranes. The retina was reattached in 42 eyes (91. 3 %) out of the 46 with detached retina and remained attached during the follow-up period in these eyes without any further surgical intervention until silicone oil removal. Four eyes (8. 7 %) had recurrent RD after surgery and three eyes (6. 5 %) had recurrent RD after silicone oil removal. Vision was improved in most eyes as compared with the preoperative visual acuity. Final best-corrected visual acuity at 6 months showed improvement in 43 eyes (82. 7 %), partial improvement in four eyes (7. 7 %), and remained unchanged in five eyes (9. 6 %). Sixteen patients developed cataract during the follow-up period until removal of the silicone oil. Conclusion Epiretinal membrane dissection with the new multifunctional retinal twister appears to be a safe and effective technique in the management of epiretinal membranes. The new multifunctional retinal twister proved its efficacy and success in grasping, holding, twisting, pulling, and dissecting epiretinal membranes; further, the bipolar diathermy attachment for quick management of retinal bleeders was a great advantage for shortening the surgical time and providing a bloodless working field. The encouraging anatomic and functional outcome with the least complications met with during surgery favors its safe use.

Because schnapps has cultural value, but is apparently losing it, because our times can be compared {{with some kind of}} liquidity and because I wish to preserve local living traditions and create new bonds between local people. Possibly generate a community of schnapps enthusiasts. The thesis work investigates the recent trend where food and art intertwine, especially the trend of local food shown best in the concept of NOMA (Danish restaurant). Olafur Elliason wrote in the cookbook of NOMA “we do not stop the world when we eat, we go deeper into it”. So it is with drinking as well. I have used both in text and visual a certain phenomenology of the moment. They are collections of pictures and accomplishing texts that give the reader a fuller understanding of a phenomenon. As a phenomena I use the tree to symbolize craft. As the tree, which is embedded in its local environment, so should craft be integrated into local society. This is a key thread in the thesis and leads to the research question. Research Question The thesis work aims to explore the production of a conceptual schnapps-bottle as a functional objects combined with the designing of a local brand focusing on traditional and self-organized schnapps-making processes which can contribute to current discourse of crafts today as being a field of ecological methods, site-specific production and local participation The thesis is divided into four areas, role, form, participation and brand. In extension of this I am trying to give suggestions of the craftsmans role and a short review of a craftstory about how form follows content in today’s society. I don’t believe that we absolutely have to invent new ways of thinking to activate societal changes, but I believe we have to look closer into existing ideas to craft our way forth. Understand history and human behavior better to find better ways of an ecological and social civilization. Is craft in itself a social and ecological idea? Is there a need for authenticity because people are alienated from their reality by consumption, media and capitalism? In that way we must craft the path towards utopia. Locality – Form, content and space From this point on the thesis explores the locality, schnapps-making processes, the bottle of centuries, the link between matter and spirit and the language of the material. Just a small poem to give an idea of the locality. Where the stags roar to mate and the amber rolls on to the beachside that is where I come from. Where one can watch the milky way on clear nights and where men have wrinkled faces of nature’s time. Where reckless fellows throw their naked bodies in the sea and where cows lunch in green fields. Where once fishermen harvest their daily living in the ocean and where luxury was a swearword. Where families go in the forest to find the yellow gold and where questions are rarely asked. Where you always greet your neighbors, but never talk to strangers. Where the sky and the sea have a greyish blue color which is impossible to depict. Where the light is so utterly sharp and every contrast seems so delicate. Where everything is so desolate, that one don’t recognize real company and where untamed and wild nature showers from open skies. Where people don’t talk louder than they think and where humility is a bless. Where the rainbow is golden and nobody searches for the end of it. Where later is never late and where parties have the most uncommon speakers. That is where I come from. I have researched 16 different bottles, which represents the history of glass bottles. They express in many ways the evolution of the bottle in aesthetics and functional manner. The bottle has come from being an ethnic object to a mass-produced global signifier, which only through branding and labels show its locality. Almost each country has its own special beverage which is linked to the country. In France they drink cognac and pastis, In Greece, ouzo, In Italia, grappa and so forth. In Denmark we drink Schnapps. The schnapps process requires four different stages, which are collect, infuse, filter and storage and taste. Schnapps is a very delicate thing, but still it is easy to experiment and get good results. Participation and Brand In the end I participate with local people about the schnapps-making process. As Nicolas Bourriaud says in the book relational aesthetics “”It seems more pressing to invent possible relations with our neighbors in the present, than to bet on happier tomorrows” This is what I am trying to do by creating a schnapps brand, which engages with local culture in creating both new and traditional tastes. I send out 16 bottle with messages inside asking the locals to create recipes of schnapps, which are inspired by the local environment. This is a crafted object inspiring a crafted process, which then provides inspiration for another crafted object. And so it circles onwards. I have choosen 16 recipes which describe the local area and provide it with an empty container for <b>infusion,</b> inside the <b>bottle</b> there is a map of the local area and outside the brand label...|$|R
