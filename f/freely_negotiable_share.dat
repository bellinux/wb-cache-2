The different regimes, being used until the Bosman judgement of 1995, currently in use, and recently proposed by the European Commission differ with respect to the transfer fee an initial club must accept in case of a transfer depending on whether a player has a valid contract or not. In particular, we argue that due to its averse effects on investment incentives, the Commission should refrain from its Suggestion of abolishing <b>freely</b> <b>negotiable</b> transfer fees. Our analysis also sheds some light on the issue under which circumstances binding long-term contracts should be allowed in general labor law...|$|R
40|$|Emerald Group Publishing LimitedPurpose – This study {{attempts}} {{to examine the}} issues relating to corporate financial reporting of Chinese listed companies under specified institutional settings as companies with different share-categories are required to prepare annual reports under various General Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). Design/methodology/approach – This study selects Chinese companies that issue <b>negotiable</b> <b>shares</b> to examine whether corporate disclosure patterns are different under various institutional settings. <b>Negotiable</b> <b>shares</b> can be traded on stock exchanges and are divided into A-, B- and H-shares. The extent of corporate disclosure is obtained from the content analysis of annual reports for 191 sampled Chinese listed companies with various share categories. The association are hypothesized and tested between the level of corporate disclosure and the following corporate determinants: company size, profitability, auditor, leverage, industry and ownership structure. Findings – The extensive regulations and different standards influence on disclosures of companies with foreign investment participation and overseas listing status. By reconciliation of their annual reports according to the IFRSs or the GAAP of the listing country, these companies increased information disclosure voluntarily {{in order to enhance}} their reputation and credibility. Some corporate factors, such as company size, profitability and the size of auditor, have influenced the level of corporate disclosure in annual reports of domestic and foreign share-based companies. Ownership structure has positive impact on the level of disclosure for companies with domestic investors. Originality/value – This study advances knowledge of the influence that legislative circumstances and ownership structures can have on disclosure decisions made by management in their annual reports. This information is of high interest to domestic and foreign investors and regulators in understanding of financial reporting in Chinese listed companies...|$|R
50|$|Dynamic Discounting {{describes}} {{a collection of}} methods in which payment terms can be established between a buyer and supplier to accelerate payment for goods or services {{in return for a}} reduced price or discount. Dynamic Discounting methods are used for business-to-business transactions when contractual or pre-established early payment terms may not exist or the payment date does not conform to agreed upon discount terms. Dynamic Discounting includes the ability to agree upon terms that vary the discount according to the date of early payment. The earlier the payment, the greater the discount. In addition, it includes an ability for either buyer or supplier to propose an early payment date and discount for a one-time payment using electronic mail or specialized software. Through the use of dynamic discounting methods, buying organizations can increase the number and size of early payment discounts they receive and suppliers can get paid sooner at a lower cost of capital than alternative options. A range of concepts is available to implement dynamic discounting into supply chain finance (SCF): dynamic discounting {{can be seen as a}} comparatively simple form, whereby the supplier grants a cash discount for early payment of its invoices - the amount of the reduction and the time of payment are quickly and <b>freely</b> <b>negotiable.</b>|$|R
2500|$|When the Soviet Union {{joined the}} UCC, {{a new type}} of <b>freely</b> <b>negotiable</b> {{licences}} was introduced to facilitate dealing with publishers abroad, and in particular in the West. Copyrights, especially the right to publish a work, became transferrable through these licenses. The intention clearly was that the old-style authors' contracts were to be used amongst Soviet partners for domestic publication, whereas the new licensing scheme was to be [...] employed towards foreign publishers. Upon a decree of August 16, 1973, the [...] "All-Union Agency on Copyrights" [...] (VAAP [...] ) was founded on September 20, 1973. The VAAP replaced the several previously existing collecting societies (such as the VUOAP), taking over their tasks and additionally managing copyrights on foreign works in the USSR and also the copyrights on Soviet works abroad. Officially, the VAAP was a non-governmental organization sponsored by creative unions (such as the Union of Soviet Writers) and seven state organs; but for all practical purposes, it was a state agency. All contracts with foreign publishers had to be concluded through VAAP; authors were forbidden to negotiate directly with foreign publishers. In the standard authors' publishing contracts, an author transferred the right to use the work abroad to the first publisher; and publishers were also obliged to go through VAAP for international copyright deals. The VAAP held the state monopoly on the import and export of copyrights. Only the state organs for cinematography (Goskino, through its Soveksportfilm agency) and television and radio broadcasts (Gosteleradio), as well as the news agency Novosti were exempted from that monopoly, but even they had to register all contracts with foreign partners with VAAP.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Discussions on {{the role}} of markets in {{healthcare}} easily lead to political and unfruitful polarized positions. Actors arguing in favour of markets as a solution for the quality/cost conundrum entrench themselves against others pointing out the risk of markets for the delivery and governance of healthcare. These binary options of more or less marketization preclude a more empirical analysis of how markets, as multiple arrangements, are constructed and what their consequences are for public values like affordability and quality. To empirically explore the relation between markets and public values in healthcare, in this paper we analyze the construction of a market for hospital care in the Netherlands, based on a system of diagnoserelated groups (DBCs), {{and the development of a}} market for long term care based on care-load packages (ZZPs). In these cases we address the intended result of care markets according to various policy actors, the visible and invisible work done by various actors to make markets work and the values enacted in market practices. We show that where policy aims within these markets focus on providing choice and increasing diversity of care institutions, the instruments of DBCs and ZZPs rather produce isomorphism and homogenization. Furthermore, the strong influence of financial instruments in shaping healthcare markets assume that cost and quality can both be strengthened while it in fact has a profound influence on how public values like quality get defined in practice. These translations between values pursued and outcomes produced indicate that conceptualizing the role of the state as defining public values that markets (have to) implement is problematic, as this removes crucial normative work in the shaping of our welfare states to the realm of the technical operationalization of markets. An alternative relation between state, market and society can be conceived once we accept that such values are shaped in practice and that the relationship between policy aims and policy consequences can never be fully captured through a logic of implementation. This then calls for an experimental role of the state: a state that sees market developments as experimental devices in which the aim is a good composition of public values. We propose this experimentation could for example focus on market developments that do not ascribe a privileged status to financial devices and price-mechanism, such as a market for the DBC A-segment, in which prices are not <b>freely</b> <b>negotiable.</b> Such experiments could allow competition to focus on other public values like quality and maintaining accessibility while at the same time function as learning laboratories for reconceiving the role between state, market and society...|$|R
5000|$|TRUST ESTATE AS BUSINESS COMPANIES. A {{practice}} {{originating in}} Massachusetts of vesting a business or certain {{real estate in}} a group of trustees, who manage it {{for the benefit of the}} beneficial owners; the ownership of the latter is evidenced by <b>negotiable</b> (or transferable) <b>shares.</b> The trustees are elected by the shareholders, or in case of a vacancy, by the board of trustees. Provision is made in the agreement and declaration of the trust to the effect that when new trustees are elected, the trust estate shall vest in them without further conveyance. The declaration of the trust specifies the power of the trustees. They have a common seal; the board is organized with the usual officers of a board of trustees; it is governed by -laws; the officers have the usual powers of like corporation officers; so far as practicable, the trustees in their collective capacity, are to carry on the business under a specified name. The trustees may also hold shares as beneficiaries. Provision may be made for the alteration or specified manner. In Eliot v. Freeman, 31 Sup. Ct. 360, 220 U.S. 178, 55 L.

We find that overall compliance is low; there is an adverse impact on financial transparency created by the cumulative effects of poor implementation of standards on customer identification; and the current measurements of compliance do {{not take into account}} an analysis of ML/FT risk, thereby undermining their credibility and the relevance of some of the policy recommendations taken on their basis. Moreover, we also examine the key role of some cultural, institutional, and financial factors in boosting countries'' compliance using econometric analysis.

2500|$|While {{all records}} of all a company's {{debentures}} {{need to be}} kept by the company, debentures secured by a [...] "charge" [...] must additionally be registered under the Companies Act 2006 section 860 with Companies House, along with any charge on land, <b>negotiable</b> instruments, uncalled <b>shares,</b> book debts and floating charges, among other things. The purpose of registration is chiefly to publicise which creditors take priority, so that creditors can assess a company's risk profile when making lending decisions. The sanction for failure to register is that the charge becomes void, and unenforceable. This does not extinguish the debt itself, but any advantage from priority is lost and the lender will be an unsecured creditor. In National Provincial Bank v Charnley {{there had been a}} dispute about which creditor should have priority after Mr Charnley's assets had been seized, with the Bank claiming its charge was first and properly registered. Giving judgment for the bank Atkin LJ held that a charge, which will confer priority, simply arises through a contract, [...] "where in a transaction for value both parties evince an intention that property, existing or future, shall be made available as security for the payment of a debt, and that the creditor shall have a present right to have it made available, there is a charge". This means a charge simply arises by virtue of contractual freedom. Legal and equitable charges are two of four kinds of security created through consent recognised in English law. A legal charge, more usually called a mortgage, is a transfer of legal title to property on condition that when a debt is repaid title will be reconveyed. An equitable charge used to be distinct in {{that it would not be}} protected against bona fide purchasers without notice of the interest, but now registration has removed this distinction. In addition the law recognises a pledge, where a person hands over some property in return for a loan, and a possessory lien, where a lender retains property already in their possession for some other reason until a debt is discharged, but these do not require registration.|$|R
40|$|The aim of my {{dissertation}} is {{to describe}} the complexities of English as a lingua franca (ELF) as it is used {{by a group of}} Erasmus exchange students engaged in social practice. My research was begun while I was working with the LINEE project, which made me realize that for {{a better understanding of the}} Erasmus exchange students’ linguistic situation, the analytic focus had to be on language use in its social context. To that end, I adopted the community of practice model, which relies quite specifically on ethnographic techniques for collecting data, qualitative methods for analyzing social practices, and discourse analytic methods for analyzing linguistic practices. The participants were 142 Erasmus exchange students who studied temporarily at the University of Szeged, Hungary. The data collection spanned a whole academic year. The data sources included audio-taped and transcribed interviews, audio-taped and transcribed naturally occurring interactions, field notes, prompted e-mails, online posts by the students and circular e-mails by the students. By focusing on shared practices and resources that the participants imbued with meaning, the analysis indicates that the Szeged Erasmus students indeed built a community of practice during their relatively short stay in Hungary. The shared practices emerged to achieve the goal of building a friendship and “family” based local social network with a focus on fun and self-confidence. The shared practices involved “spontaneous” as well as “ritualized” code-switching, yet, most of the practices were in English. In the Szeged Erasmus community English was a key shared practice: it helped the participants to build <b>shared</b> <b>negotiable</b> resources (1) for accomplishing everyday ritual tasks; (2) for making humor in the language and also about the language; and (3) for repairing the problematic moments of word search and non-understanding. Given that for the vast majority of the participants English was an additionally learnt language, the analyzed linguistic practices are necessarily interpreted as ELF practices. The analysis indicates that for the Szeged Erasmus students English was a facilitator. In case of lacking other shared languages, it was the most important means of connecting both with the other Erasmus students and with the local peers. Further results of this study show that through developing their shared resources, the participants created through practice their own “version” of ELF. That is, they made the fleeting, changeable nature of ELF “fixed” to the extent that it helped them define themselves as a group. Furthermore, the participants of the present study were users of English, in the first place, and learners of English in the second place. That is, they exploited their non-nativeness and demonstrated their “language learner” roles by choice, as and when appropriate, as a way of exploiting their shared resources. Finally, the Szeged Erasmus students creatively exploited their plurilingual repertoires. However, their code-switching was more for the creation of humor, rapport, and a “family” than for achieving intelligibility or signaling linguacultural identities. The dissertation points to the conclusion that there is a need for a careful understanding of the social context in which ELF is used or is developing. ...|$|R
