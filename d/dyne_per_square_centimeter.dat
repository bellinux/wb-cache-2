5000|$|Similar to {{selectin}} binding, FimH binding {{also have}} a threshold where it only starts binding to the host cells above this threshold. This shear stress threshold is about 1 <b>dynes</b> <b>per</b> <b>squared</b> <b>centimeter,</b> slightly larger than that of selectin binding. Above this threshold, FimH also alternate between binding, pause and unbinding with the mannose residues. However, different from selectin binding, FimH binding to mannose-BSA can either have a very long or very short pauses. This cause FimH binding to exhibit a [...] "stick-and-roll" [...] adhesion, not rolling adhesion {{in the case of}} selectin binding. And unlike selectin binding which requires integrin to help with firm adhesion, FimH binding can become stationary, and this process is reversible. All of this is mediated by shear stress level: at shear stress higher than 20 <b>dynes</b> <b>per</b> <b>squared</b> <b>centimeter,</b> FimH binding is stationary. At shear stress higher than 100 <b>dynes</b> <b>per</b> <b>squared</b> <b>centimeter,</b> slow rolling is observed.|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} unlimitedThe complex shear modulus of both kaolin-water and bentonite-water mixtures {{has been determined}} in the laboratory. The method involved measuring the reaction on a torsional elastic wave propagated down a metal rod when the rod was immersed in sediment. Observations were made over the frequency range two to forty-three kHz. Dispersed sediments behaved like Newtonian liquids. Undispersed sediments, however, were viscoelastic in character, and their shear moduli exhibited no dependence on frequency. For undispersed kaolin mixtures, a typical result is (21. 6 + i 1. 2) x 1, 000 <b>dynes</b> <b>per</b> <b>square</b> <b>centimeter</b> at 32 percent concentration. In bentonite, a modulus of (4. 6 + i 2. 0) x 10, 000 <b>dynes</b> <b>per</b> <b>square</b> <b>centimeter</b> at 19 percent concentration is representative. Lieutenant, United States Nav...|$|R
5000|$|In blood vessel, at {{very low}} shear stress of ~.3 <b>dynes</b> <b>per</b> <b>squared</b> <b>centimeter,</b> leukocytes do not adhere to the blood vessel endothelial cells. Cells move along the blood vessel at a rate {{proportional}} to the blood flow rate. Once the shear stress pass that shear threshold value, leukocytes start to accumulate via selectin binding. At low shear stress above the threshold of about [...]3 to 5 <b>dynes</b> <b>per</b> <b>squared</b> <b>centimeter,</b> leukocytes alternate between binding and non-binding. Because one leukocyte has many selectins around the surface, these selectin binding/ unbinding cause a rolling motion on the blood vessel. As the shear stress continue to increase, the selectin bonds becomes stronger, causing the rolling velocity to be slower. This reduction in leukocytes rolling velocity allow cells to stop and perform firm binding via integrin binding. Selectin binding do not exhibit [...] "true" [...] catch bond property. Experiments show that at very high shear stress (passing a second threshold), the selectin binding transit between a catch bond to a slip bond binding, in which the rolling velocity increases as the shear force increases.|$|R

Microstructural characterization of these crystals has been performed using synchrotron white beam x-ray topography (SWBXT) and double axis x-ray diffraction. Dislocation densities were measured from x-ray topographs obtained using the reflection geometry. For detached-grown crystals, the dislocation density is 4 - 6 x 10 (exp 4) <b>per</b> <b>square</b> <b>centimeter</b> in the seed region, and decreases {{in the direction}} of growth to less than 10 (exp 3) <b>per</b> <b>square</b> <b>centimeter,</b> and in some crystals reaches less than 10 (exp 2) <b>per</b> <b>square</b> <b>centimeter.</b> For crystals grown in the attached configuration, dislocation densities were on the order of 10 (exp 4) <b>per</b> <b>square</b> <b>centimeter</b> {{in the middle of the}} crystals, increasing to greater than 10 (exp 5) <b>per</b> <b>square</b> <b>centimeter</b> near the edge.
