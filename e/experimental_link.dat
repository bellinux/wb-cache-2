40|$|The {{conflict}} between grey seals, Halichoerus grypus, and the Swedish cod fisheries in the Baltic Sea has steadily increased {{during the past}} 10 years. Seals locate the fishermen’s nets, damage the catch and tear holes in the nets. In this study we investigated the damages caused by seals on the net fishery for cod, Gadus morhua, in the central Baltic Sea. Damage includes both the visible damage and the hidden damage i. e. the fish that are taken whole without leaving any visible trace or damages to the nets. To gather the required data an observer joined two professional fishermen {{for a period of}} tree months in 2005. During that period all catch were recorded together with any visible damages. On some <b>experimental</b> <b>links</b> of nets the caught fish were marked without being removed from the net. The net was reset and when retrieved again the number of damaged or lost marked fish was noted. Corrections to the data were made to account for fish that spontaneously fall off. On 101 out of 184 links set out damaged fish were found. Damaged fish was most often found as small remains or with only the head of the fish left. At 20 out of 31 occasions when fish were left in the net, marked fish were missing or found damaged indicating a seal visit. 64. 3 percent of the marked cod were removed from the damaged links without leaving any visible trace, and an additional 10. 1 percent were damaged adding up to a total damage of 74. 4 percent of the catch. There was also a significant difference in catch per effort (cod caught per 100 m* 24 h) between damaged and non-damaged <b>experimental</b> <b>links.</b> Our findings show that the damage to the cod fishery caused by seals is large and that damage can not only be estimated by observing and counting retrieved damaged fish.

40|$|Increased {{levels of}} {{homocysteine}} {{have been established}} as {{a risk factor for}} cardiovascular disease (CVD) by mechanisms still incompletely defined. S-Adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) is the metabolic precursor of homocysteine that accumulates in the setting of hyperhomocysteinemia and is a negative regulator of most cell methyltransferases. Several observations, summarized in the current review, support the concept that SAH, rather than homocysteine, may be the culprit in the CVD risk that has been associated with hyperhomocysteinemia. This review examines the biosynthesis and catabolism of homocysteine and how these pathways regulate accumulation of SAH. In addition, the epidemiological and <b>experimental</b> <b>links</b> between hyperhomocysteinemia and CVD are discussed, along with the evidence suggesting a role for SAH in the disease.

Effective non-invasive imaging can largely obviate these limitations and provide both anatomical and functional tumor-biology related information. The very nature of modelling cancer in the mouse is also changing, giving rise to exciting new experimental possibilities and far greater flexibility. Such modelling approaches also provide exciting new possibilities to non-invasively image tumor biology, in particular, with reporter transgenes, an experimental approach that can be employed to image a broad range of biological processes.

Using localized electric field of a scanning probe microscopy tip, we experimentally demonstrate a surprisingly rich range of polarization reversal behaviors {{in the vicinity of}} the initially flat 180 ferroelectric domain wall. The nucleation bias is found to increase by an order of magnitude from a 2 D nucleus at the wall to 3 D nucleus in the bulk. The wall is thus significantly ferroelectrically softer than the bulk. The wall profoundly affects switching on length scales of the order of micrometers. The mechanism of correlated switching is analyzed using analytical theory and phase-field modeling. The long-range effect is ascribed to wall bending under the influence of a tip bias well below the bulk nucleation field and placed many micrometers away from the wall.

However, the specific genes through which these regulatory variants act remain poorly characterized. We generated expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) data in 118 human islet samples using RNA-sequencing and high-density genotyping. We identified fourteen loci at which cis-exon-eQTL signals overlapped active islet chromatin signatures and were coincident with established T 2 D and/or glycemic trait associations. ‎At some, these data provide an <b>experimental</b> <b>link</b> between GWAS signals and biological candidates, such as DGKB and ADCY 5.
