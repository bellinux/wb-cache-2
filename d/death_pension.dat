40|$|Excerpt] The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) administers pension {{programs}} for certain low-income veterans and their surviving spouses and dependent children. This report discusses the Improved Disability Pension, which makes payments to certain low-income veterans, and the Improved <b>Death</b> <b>Pension,</b> which makes payments to certain low-income surviving spouses and dependent children of deceased veterans. To qualify for either program, individuals must have become eligible for payments on or after January 1, 1979. Both pension programs {{were created by}} P. L. 95 - 588, the Veterans and Survivors Pension Improvement Act of 1978. In addition, this report discusses a special pension program for Medal of Honor recipients. This report does not discuss several other pension programs that are administered by the VA, such as the Old Law Disability Pension and the Section 306 Disability Pension, which make payments to low-income veterans, and the Old Law <b>Death</b> <b>Pension</b> and the Section 306 <b>Death</b> <b>Pension,</b> which make payments to low-income surviving spouses and dependent children of veterans; these programs apply only to veterans and their survivors who became entitled to such benefits before 1979. This report also does not discuss pension {{programs for}} veterans of specific periods of war before World War I, such as the Civil War, the Indian Wars, and the Spanish-American War.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{elaborate}} a detailed survey concerning the access rules to public pensions benefits across twenty European, Asian and American countries, {{which are then}} compared to the Brazilian system. This system has practically no constraint upon <b>death</b> <b>pensions</b> claims, what makes {{it one of the}} world?s most generous arrangements. In the case of retirement benefits, among the sample countries Brazil is the country with the laxest rules for scheduled retirement concessions. Unlike Brazil, all of them define a minimum age limit and most do not distinguish between genders or among social categories. Following this comparison, we empirically simulate the application of each country?s different rules to the Brazilian demographic pattern. We attest that in all of these cases there is either a reduction of beneficiaries, a cut {{in the value of the}} benefits, or both. Finally, we estimate the hypothetic case where we decreased the value of the benefit, but no exclusion of beneficiaries was made. Using that potentially saved amount, we estimated the impact on poverty and on income distribution of an alternative redistribution of that sum. The results indicate a fall in the level of poverty among children and teenagers and stability in the poverty level among the usual public pensions system beneficiaries. ...|$|R

The rejection of Ms. Hodge's application was appealed to a Canada Pension Plan Review Tribunal in 1997. The tribunal held that the law was invalid because Ms. Hodge was denied a benefit for not living with Mr. Bickell for the full year up to his <b>death.</b> The <b>Pension</b> Appeals Board overturned this finding in 2000, noting that in requiring a year's residence, the Parliament of Canada was merely trying to avoid more than one common law spouse claiming eligibility for a survivor's pension. In turn, the Federal Court of Appeal found in favour of Hodge in 2002. The Federal Court found the rejection to be discrimination based on marital status. If Ms. Hodge had been married to Mr. Bickell before the break-up, she would have received a pension. Ms. Hodge compared herself to separated married people, and not divorcees, and the Federal Court accepted this comparison.|$|R

50|$|After Independence in 1947 and the {{creation}} of Travancore-Cochin in 1949, Lalithamba Bayi moved away to Bangalore and settled there with her children. In the early 1950s Indira Bayi settled in Madras and Sethu Lakshmi Bayi was alone in Trivandrum. Slowly she started disposing the many properties and palaces and by the late 1950s was contemplating moving to Bangalore to be with her daughter and grandchildren. This was hastened in 1957 by her servants in the Palace forming a Union and creating problems. While it was strictly controlled and put down initially, it resurfaced in 1958 and the servants went on strike. About this time Sethu Lakshmi Bayi suffered a mild heart attack as well. Thereafter it was decided that she should stay with her family members in Bangalore. Thus in 1958 the she moved to Madras after leaving Trivandrum hastily, and by early 1959 moved to Bangalore where she constructed a bungalow for herself close to her daughter's house and took up residence there. She never returned to Travancore. Sethu Lakshmi Bayi lived in Bangalore for more than 25 years. In 1971 the Government of India abolished the Privy Purse in India given to former rulers and their families and thus Sethu Lakshmi Bayi stopped receiving her allowances.

40|$|Background: Sickness absence {{with cash}} {{benefits}} from the sickness insurance gives {{an opportunity to be}} relieved from work without losing financial security. There are, however, downsides to taking sickness absence. Periods of sickness absence, even short ones, can increase the risk for future spells of sickness absence and unemployment. The sickness period may in itself have a detrimental effect on health. The aim {{of the study was to}} investigate if there is an association between exposure to sickness absence at a young age and later sickness absence, disability <b>pension,</b> <b>death,</b> unemployment and income from work. Methods: Our cohort consisted of all immigrants aged 21 - 25 years in Sweden in 1993 (N= 38 207) and a control group of native Swedes in the same age group (N= 225 977). We measured exposure to sickness absence in 1993 with a follow-up period of 15 years. We conducted separate analyses for men and women, and for immigrants and native Swedes. Results: Exposure to >= 60 days of sickness absence in 1993 increased the risk of sickness absence [hazard ratio (HR) 1. 6 - 11. 4], unemployment (HR 1. 1 - 1. 2), disability pension (HR 1. 2 - 5. 3) and death (HR 1. 2 - 3. 5). The income from work, during the follow-up period, among individuals with spells of sick leave for >= 60 days in 1993 was around two-thirds of that of the working population who did not take sick leave.

40|$|Most Australian {{judges are}} remunerated through {{a package of}} {{benefits}} that includes salary during their years of judicial service, a judicial pension paid during their years of retirement, and a spousal pension paid to a judge's surviving spouse until the spouse's <b>death.</b> These non-contributory <b>pensions</b> are calculated {{as a proportion of}} the current judicial salary and their cost is rising rapidly. The unfunded liability at 30 June 2008 amounted to $ 586 million for federal judges alone, an increase of 23 per cent on the liability just three years earlier. This article argues that substantial increases in the life expectancy of Australians over the next 40 - 50 years will impose a very significant strain on the current system of judicial remuneration. This is because the judicial pension and the spousal pension will continue to rise substantially, while the period of judicial service remains constrained; at the lower end, by the need to acquire legal skills prior to judicial appointment; and at the upper end, by mandatory retirement of judges at 70 or 72 years. The article develops two metrics for measuring how the cost of judges changes under different assumptions about their age of appointment and retirement, and under different conditions about life expectancy of judges and their spouses. The article advocates three changes to the law that will help to address the long term pressures of demographic change, namely: (a) increasing the maximum retirement age of judges; (b) increasing the minimum age at which judges qualify for the judicial pension; and (c) increasing the minimum years of service required to qualify for the judicial pension. Consistently with the core value of judicial independence, these changes should be put in place for new judicial appointees only. 38 page(s...|$|R

The treatment is mainly considered for younger patients still available for the work market. In this study, social outcomes after ASCT in terms of return to work (RTW) are described. Patients and methods: Information from national administrative registers was combined with clinical information on patients, who received ASCT for relapse of DLBCL or TIL between 2000 and 2012. A total of 164 patients were followed until RTW, disability or old-age <b>pension,</b> <b>death,</b> or December 31, 2015, whichever came first. A total of 205 patients were followed with disability pension as the event of interest. Cox models {{were used to determine}} cause-specific hazards. Results: During follow-up, 82 (50 %) patients returned to work. The rate of returning to work in the first year following ASCT was decreased for patients being on sick leave at the time of relapse (hazard ratio [HR] 0. 3 [0. 2; 0. 5]) and increased for patients aged ≥ 55 years (HR 1. 9 [1. 1; 3. 3]). In all, 56 (27 %) patients were granted disability pension. Being on sick leave at the time of relapse was positively associated with receiving a disability pension in the first 2 years after ASCT (HR 3. 7 [1. 8; 7. 7]). Conclusion: Patients on sick leave at the time of relapse have a poorer prognosis regarding RTW and have a higher rate of disability pension. Furthermore, patients > 55 are more likely to RTW compared to younger patients. These results indicate an unmet need for focused social rehabilitation.

A comparison was also made between immigrants and native Swedes. Another aim was to see if Active Labour Market Programs (ALMPs) and attained education moderated the outcomes. The baseline year was 1992, a year of severe economic downturn. The follow-up period was from 1993 to 2007, divided into three 5 -year periods. The study group of 199, 623 individuals comprised all immigrants born between 1968 and 1972 who immigrated before 1990 (25, 607) and a random sample of native Swedes in the same age range (174, 016). Individuals with unemployment benefit in 1990 - 1991, disability pension in 1990 - 1992 or severe disorders leading to hospitalization in 1990 - 1992 were excluded in order to minimize selection bias. Those who were unemployed in 1992 had elevated risk, measured as odds ratios, of ≥ 60 days of sickness absence, disability pension, ≥ 100 days of unemployment and all, except native Swedish women, had elevated risk of death during follow-up. The risk of future unemployment declined until the last follow-up period, while the elevated risk of future sickness absence was about the same in all three follow-up periods. Higher level of education at baseline decreased the risk of future unemployment. Individuals participating in ALMPs had an increased risk of future unemployment, and immigrant women had an increased risk of sickness absence, compared to non-participating individuals. Attained education between 1993 and 1997 decreased the risk of future unemployment and decreased the risk of sickness absence among immigrants. The risk of both future unemployment and future sickness absence increased with the length of unemployment in 1992. Immigrants had higher risk of unemployment both at baseline and follow-up compared with native Swedes, but followed the pattern of native Swedes when unemployed. The conclusion are that exposure to unemployment are associated with elevated risk of future unemployment, sickness absence, disability <b>pension</b> and <b>death</b> fifteen years after exposure. To a society this will mean substantial costs in the form of increased welfare payments and loss of productivity and tax income. Selection to unemployment by individuals already sick, may explain part of the association between unemployment and the studied outcomes...|$|R
40|$|Obesity [body {{mass index}} (BMI) >= 30 kg/m 2] {{is common in}} many parts of the world, {{especially}} in the established market economies, formerly socialist economies of Europe and Latin America and the Caribbean, as well as the Middle Eastern Crescent. Worldwide, as many as 250 million people may be obese (7 % of the adult population) and 2 to 3 times as many may be considered overweight (BMI 25 to 30 kg/m 2). The prevalence of obesity seems to be increasing in most parts of the world, even in areas where obesity used to be rare. A waist circumference greater than 102 cm in men and 88 cm in women may be a more sensible classification than BMI to identify individuals who are at increased health risk because of obesity, but information on this point is still scarce. Increased fatness measured by a high BMI, large waist circumference or high waist/hip circumference ratio is associated with many chronic diseases as well as poor physical functioning. These all contribute to the costs associated with excess bodyweight. The economic costs of obesity can be broken down into 3 levels: Direct costs: costs to the community related to the diversion of resources to the diagnosis and treatment of diseases directly related to obesity as well as the treatment of obesity itself. These costs have been estimated to account for 2 to 8 % of total healthcare costs of various countries. Indirect (or societal) costs: these costs are related to the loss of productivity caused by absenteeism and premature <b>death</b> and disability <b>pensions.</b> There is a lack of good economic analysis in this area, although research from Sweden, Finland and The Netherlands has clearly shown that obesity is associated with increased sick leave and the need for disability pensions. Personal costs: obese individuals may earn less than their lean counterparts because of job discrimination (related to the stigma associated with obesity or because of diseases and disabilities caused by obesity). Many insurance companies (particularly life insurance) charge higher premiums with increasing degrees of overweight. In conclusion, there is much indirect information that obesity and overweight are important and growing public health concerns that contribute substantially to healthcare-related costs. Effective strategies for the prevention and management of obesity are needed. Obesity, Pharmacoeconomics, Cost-of-illness, Reviews-on-treatment...|$|R
