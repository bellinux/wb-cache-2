50|$|Electrostatic {{deflection}} is {{very useful}} for small deflection angles but {{is well known}} to be inferior to magnetic deflection for deflecting a charged particle beam into large angles - say over 10 degrees. The reason is that deflection aberrations become large as the deflection angle increases. This reduces the ability to finely focus the beam. Also in electrostatic deflection {{it has long been}} the practice to inject the beam midway between the charged deflection plates so as to avoid the fringe fields as much as possible. However it was found by computation methods that deflection aberrations would be significantly reduced if the beam were injected offset toward the attracting plate. That way the beam tends to follow equipotentials and the deflection force is normal to the beam direction. Thus offset, all the electrons in the beam are deflected into the same angle. There is an induced astigmatism that is correctable. This deflection idea has been tested and verified. Deflection angles of 50 degrees are reportedly possible without measurable deflection aberration. Optimal injection offset is approximately 1/3 of the plate gap toward the <b>deflecting</b> <b>plate.</b> The useful beam diameter is also approximately 1/3 of the gap. See M. Retsky and R. Stein.

The numerical simulation was carried out with spherical trifurcate branch pipe, shell type trifurcate branch pipe without <b>deflecting</b> <b>plates</b> and shell type trifurcate branch pipe with <b>deflecting</b> <b>plates</b> under a serious of operating conditions based on a case study. After this, the flow conditions and the head losses in the bifurcated sections were analyzed.

40|$|Presented {{here is a}} robot {{friendly}} {{coupling device}} for an orbital replacement unit (ORU). The invention will provide a coupling that is detached and attached remotely by a robot. The design of the coupling must allow for slight misalignments, over-torque protection, and precision placement. This is accomplished {{by means of a}} triangular interface comprising three components. A base plate assembly is located on an attachment surface, such as a satellite. The base plate assembly has a cup member, a slotted member, and a post member. The ORU that the robot attaches to the base plate assembly has an ORU plate assembly with two cone members and a post member which mate to the base plate assembly. As the two plates approach one another, one cone member of the ORU plate assembly has to be placed accurately enough to fall into the cup member of the base plate assembly. The cup member forces alignment until a second cone falls into a slotted member which provides final alignment. A single bolt is used to attach the two <b>plates.</b> Two <b>deflecting</b> <b>plates</b> are attached to the backs of the plates. When pressure is applied {{to the center of the}} <b>deflecting</b> <b>plates,</b> the force is distributed preventing the ORU and base <b>plates</b> from <b>deflecting.</b> This accounts for precision in the placement of the article.

The deployment of a deflector {{in front of}} a lift-based turbine is a promising approach to increase local flow velocity and enhance energy conversion efficiency without consideration for complicated control. For the turbine with the deflector, the phase during which the blade passes near {{the front end of the}} turbine has a major contribution to torque increase from the case without the deflector. Meanwhile, the deflector can have a negative effect in torque generation at the phase when the blade moves upstream against free stream if the turbine is placed close to the deflector in a crosswise direction. The change of nearby flow distribution by the deflector is also examined to find its correlation with torque generation. When the blade rotates through the near-wake region of the deflector, the blade can collides with the vortical structure shed from the deflector. This interaction causes significant torque fluctuation...|$|E

40|$|Ballistic {{simulation}} of the spray sprinkler for self-propelled irrigation machines requires {{the incorporation of}} the effect of the jet impact with the <b>deflecting</b> <b>plate.</b> The kinetic energy losses produced by the jet impact with the spray plate were experimentally characterized for different nozzle sizes and two working pressures for fixed spray plate sprinklers (FSPS). A technique of low speed photography was used to determine drop velocity {{at the point where the}} jet is broken into droplets. The water distribution pattern of FSPS for different nozzle sizes, working at two pressures and under different wind conditions were characterized in field experiments. The ballistic model was calibrated to simulate water distribution in different technical and meteorological conditions. Field experiments and the ballistic model were used to obtain the model parameters (D 50, n, K 1 and K 2). The results show that kinetic energy losses decrease with nozzle diameter increments; from 80 % for the smallest nozzle diameter (2 mm) to 45 % for nozzle diameters larger than 5. 1 mm, and from 80 % for the smallest nozzle diameter (2 mm) to 34. 7 % for nozzle diameters larger than 6. 8 mm, at 138 kPa and 69 kPa working pressures, respectively. The results from the model compared well with field observations. The calibrated model has reproduced accurately the water distribution pattern in calm (r= 0. 98) and high windy conditions (r= 0. 76).

40|$|Experimental {{studies of}} air {{entrainment}} by breaking waves {{are essential for}} advancing the understanding of these flows and creating valid models. The present study used three-dimensional simulations of a bow wave to examine its air entrainment process. The simulated waves were created by a <b>deflecting</b> <b>plate</b> mounted at an angle in a super-critical free surface flow. Since the air entrainment process is closely coupled with breaking wave dynamics, the present study included both air entrainment and free surface measurements. Measurements of the free surface wave {{were obtained from the}} simulated bow waves at two scales, and also from the bow wave created a towed wedge model. Contact line and bow wave profile measurements for the different experiments were compared, demonstrating the similarity of the experimental simulations to the towed model experiments. The plunging wave jet shape was measured in the larger scale stationary model and towed model experiments and used to calculate the jet thickness, velocity, and impingement angle. The bow wave profile data from the towed model experiments were used to investigate the scaling on the plunging wave face, and their wavelength, frequency, and velocity were measured. The primary mechanisms for air entrainment were the impact of the plunging wave jet and individual droplets in the splash region on the free surface. The air entrainment process was observed in the larger scale stationary model experiments, and the air bubbles were entrained in spatially periodic bubble clouds. Due to the shallow depth in these experiments, measurements of only the larger bubbles in the initial stages of air entrainment were obtained. An impedance based void fraction meter, developed specifically for the purpose, was used to measure the void fractions and bubble size distributions beneath the wave. The bubble cloud size and void fraction increased with downstream distance. There were indications that the surface disturbances control the periodicity of the bubble clouds. Namely, the surface disturbances divide the plunging liquid jet sheet into a series of plunging wave jets, each entraining air into a separate bubble cloud beneath the free surface...|$|E
40|$|In {{recent years}} the {{security}} of people and critical infrastructures is of increasing interest. Passive microwave sensors {{in the range of}} 1 - 100 GHz are suitable for the detection of concealed objects and wide-area surveillance through poor weather and at day and night time. The enhanced extraction of significant information about an observed object is enabled by the use of a spectral sensitive system. For such a spectral radiometer in the microwave range also some depth information can be extracted. The usable frequency range is thereby dependent on the application. For through-wall imaging or detection of covert objects such as for example landmines, the lower microwave range is best suited. On the other hand a high spatial resolution requires higher frequencies or instruments with larger physical dimensions. The drawback of a large system is the required movement of a mirror or a <b>deflecting</b> <b>plate</b> {{in the case of a}} mechanical scanner system, or a huge amount of receivers in a fully-electronic instrument like a focal plane array. An innovative technique to overcome these problems is the application of aperture synthesis using a highly thinned array. The combination of spectral radiometric measurements within a wide frequency band, at a high resolution, and requiring a minimum of receivers and only minor moving parts led to the development of the ANSAS instrument (Abbildendes Niederfrequenz- Spektrometer mit Apertursynthese). ANSAS is a very flexible aperture synthesis technology demonstrator for the analysis of main features and interactions concerning high spatial resolution and spectral sensing within a wide frequency range. It consists of a rotated linear thinned array and thus the spatial frequency spectrum is measured on concentric circles. Hence the number of receivers and correlators is reduced considerably compared to a fully twodimensional array, and measurements still can be done in a reasonable time. In this paper the basic idea of ANSAS and its setup are briefly introduced. Some first imaging results showing the basic capabilities are illustrated. Possible error sources and their impacts are discussed by simulation and compared to the measured data...|$|E
