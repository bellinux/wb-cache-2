5|$|As a song full of {{gospel and}} soulful influences, it allowed Mariah to really tear loose and show {{what she could}} do – which in reality was {{far more than the}} vocal {{gymnastics}} that seemed to comprise her reputation so far. From a deep rumble to a high wail, she covered five octaves wonderfully, as the power of the tune built. The backing vocals – which once again <b>had</b> <b>those</b> churchy harmonies – filled out the spare melody, as did the stately horns, which entered towards the end. The song was truly a vocal showcase for Mariah.|$|E
5|$|Caligula's {{religious}} {{policy was}} {{a departure from}} that of his predecessors. According to Cassius Dio, living emperors could be worshipped as divine {{in the east and}} dead emperors could be worshipped as divine in Rome. Augustus had the public worship his spirit on occasion, but Dio describes this as an extreme act that emperors generally shied away from. Caligula took things a step further and <b>had</b> <b>those</b> in Rome, including senators, worship him as a tangible, living god.|$|E

5|$|Ralph wrote {{a sermon}} for {{the feast of}} the Assumption of the Virgin and it survives in some fifty Latin manuscripts, {{probably}} because it was thought to have been written by Anselm of Canterbury, until shown to be Ralph's in 1927. A surviving English translation of the sermon is also preserved in the manuscript British Library, Cotton Vespasian D. xiv. The Latin version, which Ralph was a translation of his originally spoken French version, has been edited and published in 1997. Ralph also had the monks of Christ Church, Canterbury search for documents relating to the privileges of Canterbury and <b>had</b> <b>those</b> documents copied into a manuscript which still survives, BM MS Cotton Cleopatra E. His seal {{is one of the first}} to take the usual form for bishop's seals, with Ralph standing, in full vestments including a mitre, and performing a benediction with his right hand while holding his crosier in his left. The seal took the form of a pointed oval.|$|E

25|$|To {{learn about}} {{military}} affairs, he accompanied Tiberius {{in his campaign}} against the Sicambri in 8BC. The year before, Tiberius' brother Drusus the Elder died {{on his way back}} from a campaign across the Rhine. Tiberius was given command of Germania, and waged two campaigns across the Rhine in 8BC and 7BC. He marched his army between the Elbe and the Rhine, and met little resistance, except from the Sicambri. Tiberius came close to exterminating the Sicambri, and <b>had</b> <b>those</b> who survived transported to the Roman side of the Rhine, where they could be watched more closely.|$|E
25|$|Like {{traditional}} western maps, the Fairylogue and Radio-Play map {{showed the}} west on the left, {{and the east}} on the right. However, the first map of Oz to appear in an Oz book <b>had</b> <b>those</b> directions reversed, and the compass rose adjusted accordingly. It is believed {{that this is a}} result of Baum copying the map from {{the wrong side of the}} glass slide, effectively getting a mirror image of his intended map. When he realized he was copying the slide backward, he reversed the compass rose to make the directions correct. However, an editor at Reilly and Lee reversed the compass rose, thinking he was fixing an error, and resulting in further confusion. Most notably, this confused Ruth Plumly Thompson, who frequently reversed directions in her own Oz books as a result.|$|E
25|$|Director Victor Lobl also planned out the mannerisms {{shown by}} Brooks as Sisko where he talks {{directly}} to the camera. He praised the actor, saying that he delivered exactly what Lobl's written direction had described. All of those sequences were shot almost in direct continuity {{to ensure that the}} audience believed that it was a single log recording. Lobl <b>had</b> <b>those</b> filmed very tightly, and so there were not many options available in editing as only two angles were filmed for those sequences. The script had called for Sisko to get more and more drunk during those sequences as he descends into the flashbacks; Lobl had expected the studio to pull that idea before filming but they did not. Lobl also had Sisko begin to remove various parts of his uniform at the same time, which he felt demonstrated that the character was baring his soul about the story.|$|E

500|$|Paine also attacks {{religious}} institutions, indicting priests {{for their}} lust {{for power and}} wealth and the Church's opposition to scientific investigation. He presents the history of Christianity as one of corruption and oppression.

500|$|His {{campaign}} was conducted {{as an independent}} write-in candidate, because he waited to declare his candidacy until September, after the ballots had already been printed. Three days before the election, the Kansas attorney general (who had prosecuted Brinkley before the medical board) announced that the rules surrounding write-in candidates had changed, and that the doctor's name could only be written in one specific way for the vote to count (as J. R. Brinkley). As a write-in candidate, he received more than 180,000 votes (29.5 percent of the vote) and lost to Harry Hines Woodring, later Franklin Delano Roosevelt's secretary of war. An article published {{at the time in}} The Des Moines Register estimated that between 30,000 and 50,000 ballots were disqualified in this manner. [...] Woodring later admitted that <b>had</b> <b>those</b> votes counted, Brinkley would have won.|$|E

Goodrem began filming that day and tweeted her excitement about Nina making a guest appearance. Her return featured during three episodes starting from 16 March 2015. Series producer Jason Herbison confirmed that the theme of music would tie into the character's return. It was later confirmed that Nina returns to Erinsborough after her relationship with Jack ends. Goodrem said she understood what her character was going through, saying [...] "I have experienced the feelings Nina is going through. I've <b>had</b> <b>those</b> moments where you question where you are going and you have to look back to know where to move forward."

500|$|As {{promised by}} Grand Secretary Li Xian {{before the final}} assault on the Cao residence, {{imperial}} troops were allowed to confiscate for themselves what they could find from Cao Qin's property. Li had also given another incentive that any imperial soldier who captured a rebel would be rewarded with the same title and office their captive <b>had.</b> <b>Those</b> found to be followers of Cao Qin were soon after executed, including members of the Imperial Guard and the Yuzhou Guard on August 22, 1461. On August 8, Cao Jixiang was publicly dismembered, a sentence and execution which ministers of state were made aware of by the Tianshun Emperor once he held an audience at the Median Gate. The dismembered corpses of Cao Qin and his brothers were left outside and exposed to the elements. Cao's father-in-law was spared from punishment since it was known that he had refused to communicate with Cao Qin during the latter's rise to power as a career general.|$|E
