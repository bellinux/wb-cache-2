On December 15, 1993, around one week after making these comments, charges were filed against her son Kevin, for selling cocaine in an incident involving undercover officers, four months prior. Elders believes the incident was a frame-up and {{the timing of the}} charges was designed to embarrass her and the president. Kevin Elders was convicted, and he was sentenced to 10 years in prison. He appealed his conviction to the Arkansas Supreme Court, and that court reaffirmed the conviction. The court held that Mr. Elders failed to show that he was entrapped into making the narcotics sale. There was no further appeal.|$|E

Some Republicans felt that the compromise reached with Clinton on the budget and tax act was inadequate, however Gingrich has stated that the tax cuts were a significant accomplishment for the Republican Congress in the face of opposition <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>administration.</b> Gingrich along with Bob Dole had earlier set-up the Kemp Commission, headed by former US Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Jack Kemp, a tax reform commission that made several recommendations including that dividends, interest, and capital gains should be untaxed.|$|E

50|$|Once {{the two-year}} period of {{following}} the Conservative's spending plans was over, Brown's 2000 Spending Review outlined a major expansion of government spending, particularly {{on health and}} education. In his April 2002 budget, Brown raised National Insurance {{to pay for health}} spending. Brown has changed tax policy in other ways, such as the working tax credits. This is one of several ideas borrowed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> US <b>Clinton</b> <b>administration</b> whereby welfare payments are accounted for as negative taxation. The separate means-testing process for tax credits has been criticised by some as bureaucratic, and in 2003-04 and 2004-05 problems in the system led to overpayments of £2.2bn and £1.8bn respectively. However, economic theory suggests tax credits can strengthen work incentives for those at the margin between employment and unemployment, and the IFS has estimated the reforms brought at least 50,000 single mothers into part-time work.|$|R
