5000|$|The [...] "MN8" [...] 4L85-E is able {{to handle}} {{vehicles}} with up to 460 ft·lbf (624 N·m) of torque. Final <b>drive</b> <b>ratios</b> include 3.42, 3.73, and 4.10.|$|E
25|$|All four-speed manual {{transmissions}} {{were built}} at the Muncie, Indiana Allison plant. The 1984 production line saw two transmissions, a performance four-speed with a final <b>drive</b> <b>ratio</b> of 4.10, and an economy four-speed with a final <b>drive</b> <b>ratio</b> of 3.32. The V6 on the 1985 model {{and part of the}} 1986 production year came with a four-speed with a final <b>drive</b> <b>ratio</b> of 3.65. The lower-geared 4.10 four-speed transmission showed improved acceleration, but sacrificed fuel economy.|$|R
50|$|The 503 had sixteen inch {{wheels and}} {{standard}} final <b>drive</b> <b>ratio</b> of 3.90:1, A final <b>drive</b> <b>ratio</b> of 3.42:1 was optional. Acceleration of the 503 from standstill to 100 km/h (62 mph) had been measured at 13 seconds; the {{top speed of}} the 503 is about 115 mph.|$|R

50|$|At present, final <b>drive</b> <b>ratios</b> {{higher than}} 3.20 (3.2 engine {{rotations}} to one rear axle rotation) are prohibited, {{in an effort}} to limit top speed potential, thus reducing the perceived level of danger.|$|E
50|$|The 5L50 is {{engineered}} {{to handle the}} stresses from vehicles weighing up to 5000 lb (2268 kg) GVWR. Final <b>drive</b> <b>ratios</b> include 2.93:1 and 3.23:1. The 5L50 can handle up to 311 ft·lbf (422 N·m) of torque.|$|E

5000|$|These {{locomotives}} {{had been}} used over their power and speed ratings until 2004. Delayed trains were [...] "force-fit" [...] into the timetable by overspeeding up to 10% over timetable speeds. This required both overspeeding the prime mover and modifying the traction motors' final <b>drive</b> <b>ratios.</b> This practice was banned after the Pamukova train derailment.|$|E
50|$|The {{front axle}} {{was an unusual}} triple {{reduction}} type which did not need universal joints on the outer ends and allowed a tighter turning radius. The two rear axles were a double reduction type. Final <b>drive</b> <b>ratios</b> were 9.02:1 for gas powered trucks and 10.11:1 for diesels. All drivelines of both manufacturers were built by Mack.|$|E
5000|$|Fred ('Freddie') W. Barnes {{was hired}} as chief {{engineer}} in 1905, and patented the [...] "Gradua" [...] variable-ratio belt drive transmission that year. The Gradua system simultaneously changed {{the diameter of the}} crankshaft belt-drive pulley to alter the drive ratio, while moving the rear wheel forward or back to maintain belt tension. [...] The Gradua's action was controlled by a rotating lever atop the fuel tank, and was among the first attempts to provide multiple <b>drive</b> <b>ratios</b> for a motorcycle, at a time when very simple, direct belt-drive transmission was the industry norm. Variable <b>drive</b> <b>ratios</b> proved a significant advantage in competition, leading riders of other marques to complain the Gradua gave an unfair advantage; eventually Zeniths with Gradua gears were banned from many competitions. Zenith capitalized on this ban, adding the word [...] "Barred" [...] to their advertising and logo. The Gradua system was replaced by the now-standard gearbox and chain transmission in 1924.|$|E

50|$|The engine’s {{power is}} {{transferred}} via a sequential six-speed sport gearbox, which is operated pneumatically using shift paddles {{mounted on the}} steering wheel. The gearbox {{is one of the}} standard components, which are used by all the DTM manufacturers. It has 11 final <b>drive</b> <b>ratios,</b> which allow the engineers and drivers to react to the respective circuit and engine characteristics when setting the car up.|$|E
50|$|The 4T60-E {{featured}} a 245mm torque converter with varying stall speed and gear ratios. For example, a '95 Beretta features a 1650 rpm stall converter {{as opposed to}} '99 Century converter with a stall of 2095 rpm. In the 4T60 family of transmissions, the combination of drive-chain sprocket ratios and the differential gear ratio together offer up to 12 different possible final <b>drive</b> <b>ratios</b> to allow the transmission family to cover various engine and vehicle applications.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "MN5" [...] 4T45E is able {{to handle}} {{vehicles}} up to 4,500 lb (2,041 kg) GVWR. Final <b>drive</b> <b>ratios</b> include 3.63, 3.29, 3.05, and 3.91. This same transmission {{is used in the}} Saturn Vue Green Line hybrid vehicle with the addition of an auxiliary oil pump and hybrid-aware electronics. It is designed for 3.0-3.5 L engines producing up to 205 ft·lbf (278 N·m) of torque, but was also commonly mated to some versions of GM's 4-cylinder Ecotec line.|$|E
50|$|A smaller {{reduction}} <b>drive</b> <b>ratio</b> and two corresponding propellers {{were also}} offered as factory options.|$|R

50|$|On the {{mechanical}} side, the S4 25quattro {{was the second}} Audi, after the B7 RS4 to be fitted with the latest Torsen T-3 asymmetric ATB centre differential for its quattro permanent four-wheel drive system. Under normal grip conditions, this is set with a default rearwards torque distribution bias of 40:60 front to rear, and a maximum of 100% torque can automatically be apportioned to the rear axle (and up to 80% to the front) as conditions warrant. The final <b>drive</b> <b>ratios</b> are 3.889.|$|E
50|$|A {{belt drive}} is still subject to stretch but {{operates}} very quietly, cleanly, and efficiently. A toothed belt is frequently used. However, {{they are not}} as durable when subjected to high horsepower as a chain. You can not alter the length and change final <b>drive</b> <b>ratios</b> as easily as chains. They also can not wrap as closely around as chains. And require larger pulleys compared to chain sprockets to get an effective final drive ratio. Replacing a drive belt typically requires removal of the swingarm, since belts cannot be split the way a chain with a master link can.|$|E
50|$|The car {{employed}} {{rack and}} pinion steering. At the front it had disc brakes, with drum brakes controlled via a dual-line hydraulic system at the rear. Suspension was independent, employing MacPherson struts at the front and an unusual combination of full-width swing axles and half-elliptic leaf springs at the rear. The front suspension was substantially modified after the car's initial presentation: production cars incorporated modified front suspension geometry, a lowered steering ratio and a steering damper, intended to reduce the unusually strong self-centring propensity which was {{a feature of the}} pre-production cars originally presented to journalists. The cars as sold also incorporated an updated gear-box and final <b>drive</b> <b>ratios</b> along with re-sized wheels.|$|E
50|$|All models use {{the same}} ZF {{six-speed}} automatic transmission, XJ6 petrol versions have a lower final <b>drive</b> <b>ratio.</b>|$|R

50|$|The 4T65-E was {{introduced}} to replace the 4T60-E in 1997. The 4T65-E included a larger 258 mm torque converter for some models and many other changes to improve reliability. It is able to handle vehicles up to 6500 lb (2948 kg) GVWR with up to 280 ft·lbf (380 N·m) of torque. A number of final <b>drive</b> <b>ratios</b> are available, with many distinct models. Starting in mid year 2000 models, all 4T65-E models received an upgraded valve body. Starting in 2003 the internal electronics were changed, hardened 4th gear shaft, ratcheting sprags for input and third gear were added. The last application was the 2011 Chevrolet Impala as GM has transitioned to the 6T70 family transmissions for 2012.|$|E
5000|$|Just as the diameters of gears (and, correspondingly, {{their number}} of teeth) {{determine}} {{a gear ratio}} and thus the speed increases or reductions and the mechanical advantage that they can deliver, the diameters of pulleys determine those same factors. [...] and step pulleys (which operate on the same principle, although the names tend {{to be applied to}} flat belt versions and V belt versions, respectively) are a way to provide multiple <b>drive</b> <b>ratios</b> in a belt-and-pulley system that can be shifted as needed, just as a transmission provides this function with a gear train that can be shifted. V belt step pulleys are the most common way that drill presses deliver a range of spindle speeds.|$|E
50|$|The {{engine was}} mounted {{transversely}} and vertically {{as in the}} Dominator, but was a 130 bhp 5.7-litre Perkins T6.354 unit, this drove through the radical Avon Maxwell transmission, an automatic electronically controlled constant-mesh gearbox using small multi-plate clutch units to select <b>drive</b> <b>ratios,</b> this also did the jobs of retarder and angle-drive. The radiator was smaller but like most Dominator derivatives mounted at the front, low down in the frame. Greater Manchester PTE were unique among bus operators {{of the time in}} having (as a result of buying Lancashire United Transport) a wholly owned coachbuilder, the Northern Counties Motor & Engineering Company. Also GMPTE were unique outside London in having an in-house design-consultant in Ken Mortimer who had styled the Manchester Corporation Mancunian bus in the 1960s.|$|E
