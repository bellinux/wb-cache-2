40|$|International audienceKey messageThe {{potential}} of <b>European</b> National <b>Forest</b> Inventories to harmonise stem quality estimation in <b>European</b> <b>forests</b> was identified despite considerable differences in existing national approaches. ContextKnowledge on stem quality and assortments structure in <b>European</b> <b>forests</b> is highly important for {{policy makers and}} the timber industry and also for carbon life cycle analysis {{due to the fact}} that different timber products have different end use and thus store carbon for different time periods. AimsThe study aim was to evaluate the {{potential of}} <b>European</b> National <b>Forest</b> Inventories (NFI) to objectively report on the stem quality in <b>European</b> <b>forests</b> in a harmonised manner. MethodsA comprehensive questionnaire was conducted as the first important step to evaluate the current status of stem quality assessment and assess the existing level of harmonisation. ResultsDirect stem quality assessment or classification is used in 19 out of 28 European NFIs. Only eight countries provide timber assortment estimates from their NFIs. In addition, different sampling strategies for stem quality assessment are used among NFIs. Tree parameters relevant for stem quality assessment on standing trees were identified for the purpose of harmonisation. Several methods towards harmonisation between European NFIs for the purpose of reporting on stem quality of <b>European</b> <b>forests</b> were suggested. ConclusionCurrent European NFIs are not capable of reporting the stem quality of <b>European</b> <b>forests</b> in a harmonised manner at this stage and considerable efforts will need to be taken before the harmonised stem quality estimation can be prepared. However, the inquiry also revealed that there is a potential to develop the harmonised estimations in future...|$|R

40|$|In Europe, {{forest policy}} discussions are moving towards a European-Union-wide strategy. This will further {{strengthen}} {{the relations between}} the European countries in the field of forests and forest management. European-wide forest planning and decision-making require that policy-makers have insight in the long-term development of <b>European</b> <b>forests</b> under alternative regimes. The <b>European</b> <b>Forest</b> Information Scenario Model (EFISCEN) was used to make projections of the development of the <b>European</b> <b>forests</b> under four different scenarios. This book addresses the consequences of each scenario for wood production, biodiversity, and the environmental functions of the forest.
