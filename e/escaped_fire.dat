30|$|Methods to {{maintain}} fuelbreaks include mechanical, manual, chemical, biological, and prescribed fire treatments—each of {{which results in}} different kinds of costs and impacts. Mechanical treatments are expensive, and can cause excessive soil disturbance. Manual cutting can precisely target specific trees or vegetation for maintenance thinning, but this method can be very expensive and time-consuming. Chemical treatments are relatively inexpensive at large scales, but can pollute soil and water. Prescribed burning is a far less precise tool, but is the least expensive method. One challenge of prescribed burning is that fuelbreaks are designed to keep fire “out” not “in,” and adjacent stands are often untreated high fuel hazard sites that pose a significant risk of <b>escaped</b> <b>fire.</b> A more preventative strategy to help reduce the frequency and intensity of needed maintenance treatments would be to maximize canopy retention in “shaded fuelbreaks” and minimize soil disturbance during fuelbreak construction in order to curb new growth of shrubs and saplings.

At a height of around 2 - 3 m, plants escape the ‘fire trap'. At this same height, plants grow beyond the reach of many browsers (kudu, steenbok, impala) and into the range preferably browsed by giraffe. If depression of plant growth within foraging height is strong enough it may result in a demographic bottleneck concentrating woody plants that have <b>escaped</b> <b>fire</b> into these height classes.

40|$|In boreal ecosystems, {{wildfire}} severity (i. e., {{the extent}} of fire-related tree mortality) is affected by environmental conditions and fire intensity. A burned area usually includes tree patches that partially or entirely <b>escaped</b> <b>fire.</b> There {{are two types of}} post-fire residual patches: (1) patches that only escaped the last fire; and (2) patches with lower fire susceptibility, also called fire refuges, that escaped several consecutive fires, likely due to particular site characteristics. The main objective {{of this study was to}} test if particular environmental conditions and stand characteristics could explain the presence of fire refuges in the mixedwood boreal forest. The FlamMap 3 fire behavior model running at the landscape scale was used on the present-day Lake Duparquet forest mosaic and on four other experimental scenarios. FlamMap 3 was first calibrated using BehavePlus and realistic rates of fire spread obtained from the Canadian Fire Behavior Prediction system. The results, based on thousands of runs, exclude the effects of firebreaks, topography, fuel type, and microtopography to explain the presence of fire refuges, but rather highlight the important role of moisture conditions in the fuel beds. Moist conditions are likely attributed to former small depressions having been filled with organic matter rather than present-day variations in ground surface topography...|$|E
30|$|Less mobile organisms also avoid fire {{through a}} variety of means. Eastern fence lizards (Sceloporus undulatus) have been {{observed}} burrowing (Bishop and Murrie 2004) and climbing trees (Beane 2006) to avoid fire. Radio-tagged meadow voles (Microtus pennsylvanicus) have <b>escaped</b> <b>fire</b> by finding shelter in underground refugia, fleeing to unburned areas, and moving onto the bare ground of a pocket gopher (Geomys bursarius) burrow mound (Geluso et al. 1986). In a high elevation oak-pine woodland in Arizona, eight radio-tagged individuals of three species of montane rattlesnakes (Crotalus lepidus, C. molossus, and C. willardi obscurus) retreated to underground shelters in a low intensity ground fire (Smith et al. 2001). Cuban parrots (Amazona leucocephala) nesting in limestone solution holes in pine forests in the Bahamas had no loss of nests after 20 occupied burrows were burned over by a fire (Stahala 2005). O’Brien et al. (2006) measured temperature and CO 2 concentrations during a surface fire within a 1.2 m deep cavity typical of the limestone solution hole used for nesting by the Cuban parrot. Carbon dioxide concentrations rose no more than 3 -fold while air temperature rose 0.4 °C {{at the bottom of the}} burrow. The residence time of the fire was approximately 15 min within 1 m of the cavity entrance. Many additional examples of fire avoidance behavior are provided in Komarek (1969), Bendell (1974), Whelan (1995), and Russell et al. (1999).|$|E
40|$|A {{sensitivity}} {{analysis was conducted}} of the National Fire Management Analysis System (NFMAS) {{to better understand the}} relationship between data input and model output. After consultations with fire managers and researchers, five input variables were selected for sensitization: unit mission costs, average acre costs, net value change, production rates, and <b>escaped</b> <b>fire</b> limits. A random sample of 23 National Forests was selected, according to the distribution of forests within regions and fire frequency classes, on the basis of historical fire data. Database tables were manipulated, with each variable increased and decreased at six levels (± 25, ± 50, and + 100 percent). The Interagency Initial Attack Assessment (IIAA) model was run at each successive level, generating a new set of output, cost plus net value change (C+NVC), for each sensitized variable. Results were analyzed statistically, and production rates and average acre costs were found to be the most influential, while unit mission costs was least influential. In general, greater sensitivity changes resulted in greater changes in C+NVC. The National Fire Management Analysis System (NFMAS) was designed in the late 1970 's by Richard Chase, for use by the USDA Forest Service in strategic fire management and budget planning. It was later adopted by other fire-management agencies, including the USDI's Bureau of Land Management and the National Park Service.

40|$|AbstractUpland moors in the UK {{have been}} managed for centuries using {{rotational}} prescribed-burning, {{but in recent}} years there has been contentious debate over its continuing use due to varying effects on moorland ecosystem services. Prescribed-burning should only be carried out using good-practice codes, which include restrictions on the size, location and frequency of burns. Good burning practice is an indicator of management standards and habitat condition in moorland landscapes. However, there has been little attempt to assess management performance with respect to these restrictions. We investigated prescribed-burning on a case-study estate (Howden Moor) in the Peak District National Park from 1988 to 2009 using management maps and aerial photography. The annual area burned (0. 9 %) was far below recommendations (10 %) and patches were in keeping with the target sizes specified (mean±se: 2370 ± 70 m 2). The risk of a large or <b>escaped</b> <b>fire</b> was very low, with less than 1 % of fires greater than 15, 000 m 2. However, only 28. 9 % of the total burnable area was burned, leaving the rest unmanaged and accumulating fuel. Future guidelines might recommend the application of prescribed-burning across the range of Calluna vulgaris growth phases, to reduce fuel load and promote biodiversity at the landscape scale. We show that vegetation mapping and aerial photography are an effective method for monitoring prescribed-burning practice on moorlands. The information derived from such monitoring studies should lead to greater confidence in the standard of prescribed-burning and adherence to good-practice guidelines and requirements imposed by statutory authorities...|$|E
30|$|In the {{smallholder}} farming {{areas of}} Zimbabwe, poor farmers who have limited resources {{and equipment to}} clear and prepare the land using mechanical methods frequently use fire for land preparation. These land clearing fires often spread beyond the intended area of burn, and turn into wild fires, thereby significantly contributing to forest fires in recent years. Land use strategies such as ranching use fires to remove invasive species and moribund grasses that are unpalatable to livestock and game {{to give way to}} fresh growth. This practice of burning pasturelands is common in Zimbabwe and elsewhere in the tropics (Nepstad et al. 1999; Dube 2005). Of late arson {{has been one of the}} major causes of fire in areas where there is resource conflict over tenure or access rights (Applegate et al. 2001). In Zimbabwe, cases of arson have been reported in large-scale forested areas where employees are disgruntled over non-payment of salaries or low salaries. Indiscriminate throwing away of lit cigarette stubs and disposal of hot ash has also been identified as the origin of fires (WWF 2001). Crews of long distance haulage trucks often take recesses and put up fires to prepare food. Often, these fires are not put off before departure, and can spread under wind drift to trigger veld fires. In addition, other road users are also responsible for causing road side fires through burning of road servitudes. Evidently, a report by EMA (2011) showed that 60 % of all fires occur within 500 m from major roads. Fire has been, and is still used as a hunting tool in Zimbabwe. The hunting season often coincides with the dry season, when fuel load is high and dry, conditions which enhance the initiation and spread of veld fires. Similar studies in tropical Indonesia have identified anthropogenic causes of forest fires as land clearing using fire, fire being used as a weapon in land tenure or land use disputes, accidental or <b>escaped</b> <b>fire,</b> and fires connected with resource extraction (Nepstad et al. 1999; Barber and Schweithelm 2000; Applegate et al. 2001).|$|E
