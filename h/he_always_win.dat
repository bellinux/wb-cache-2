5000|$|Askeladden (Norwegian [...] "Ash Lad") is {{the main}} {{character}} in many Norwegian folktales. In some ways, he represents the small man who succeeds where all others fail. <b>He</b> <b>always</b> <b>wins</b> in the end, often winning the princess and half the kingdom. The origin of this character was compared by scholars to {{the one of the}} old Norse god Loki as a fire Vættir. [...] In some retellings, Askeladden is renamed Boots.|$|R
5000|$|Jaguar {{appears to}} have no purpose in life but to teach his {{recorder}} class, although his lessons are so lazy that it's the same as doing no work at all. However, he is strangely transcendent and nothing at all seems to truly bother him. <b>He</b> <b>always</b> <b>wins</b> his battles, and can always convince people to see his way. He contrasts Hammer, who has the same lazy lifestyle but is always the loser.|$|R
50|$|Budden {{was born}} in Harlem, New York and raised in Jersey City, New Jersey. Uninterested in school, he began abusing drugs. After an {{emotional}} confrontation with his mother, Budden willingly went into rehab on July 3, 1997. Budden began freestyling, first at his high school with acquaintances against whom he claims that <b>he</b> <b>always</b> <b>won</b> battles. <b>He</b> eventually made appearances on several New York mixtapes {{with the likes of}} DJ Clue, DJ Kayslay, and Cutmaster C.|$|R

50|$|Antaeus would {{challenge}} all passers-by to wrestling matches and remained invincible {{as long as}} he remained in contact with his mother, the earth. As Greek wrestling, like its modern equivalent, typically attempted to force opponents to the ground, <b>he</b> <b>always</b> <b>won,</b> killing his opponents. He built a temple to his father using their skulls. Antaeus fought Heracles as {{he was on his way}} to the Garden of Hesperides as his 11th Labor. Heracles realized that he could not beat Antaeus by throwing or pinning him. Instead, he held him aloft and then crushed him to death in a bear hug.|$|R

The nominee with the highest number of votes is crowned the D.O.T.U.S. of the Week.

He is famous for his support of the labor {{movement}} in the United States, and for the numerous schools named after him. Mencken, who reserved his harshest criticism for Christian ministers, wrote, in 1921 after the Gibbons' death, [...] "More presidents than one sought the counsel of Cardinal Gibbons: {{he was a man of}} the highest sagacity, a politician in the best sense, and there is no record that he ever led the Church into a bog or up a blind alley.

25|$|Moi won {{elections}} in 1992 and 1997, which were marred by political violence on both sides. Moi skilfully exploited Kenya's mix of ethnic tensions in these contests, especially smaller tribes' ever-present fear of domination {{by the larger}} tribes. In {{the absence of an}} effective and organised opposition, Moi had no difficulty in winning. Although it is also suspected that electoral fraud may have occurred, the key to his victory in both elections was a divided opposition. <b>He</b> <b>always</b> <b>won</b> the election with a minority vote of about 30% against the opposition who had a combined 70%, which was nonetheless of no consequence because it was subdivided among the opposition who had failed to unite.|$|R
50|$|In each episode Zane {{challenges}} Steve to {{an eating}} contest. This usually involves Steve trying {{to finish a}} restaurant's specialty or Zane racing Steve to eat the most of a certain food. The eating challenges were discontinued after the first season. Zane said {{the reason for this}} was because <b>he</b> had <b>always</b> <b>won</b> them, which made it unfair for Steve.|$|R
50|$|Picton {{started to}} take an active part in public life as an uncompromising radical. He {{represented}} Hackney on the London School Board from 1870 to 1879 and was chairman of the school management committee for three years. In 1883 he was chosen as a radical candidate for Tower Hamlets but in June 1884 he stood instead at a by-election for Leicester. He was elected Member of Parliament to succeed Peter Alfred Taylor, most of whose opinions he shared. He retained the seat in the following elections and resigned from the House of Commons in 1894. He was very small in stature, but possessing good oratorical powers, and retaining the manner of the pulpit, <b>he</b> <b>always</b> <b>won</b> the ear of the House of Commons, where he was known as a sincere advocate of extreme views.|$|R
50|$|His {{physical}} exploits {{have been}} so embellished over time {{that it has become}} difficult to separate the fact from the fiction. He is said to have raced against several horses, against whom <b>he</b> supposedly <b>always</b> <b>won,</b> including the prize stallion of Seigneur Duggan de La Malbaie. It earned him several nicknames, such as le Centaure (the Centaur), le Surcheval (the Superhorse) and le Cheval du Nord (the Horse of the North).|$|R

He won the heavyweight wrestling title of Europe three times and the middleweight title once. In 1938, he went to Singapore {{at the age of}} 19 with a troupe of European wrestlers to perform at the New World. Known for being [...] "the meanest" [...] amongst the wrestlers at New World, a former spectator, Abdul Wahab Mohamad said King Kong was the wrestler fans just loved to hate: [...] "He would be challenging and threatening the jeering fans to get into the ring with him. <b>He</b> <b>always</b> <b>won</b> his fights. <b>He</b> was <b>always</b> too big and too strong for his opponents." ...|$|R

50|$|Sir Joshua Wainwright, a crusader for the Knights Templar in {{the year}} 1222, battles the evil Vandal Savage, who steals a {{shipment}} of gold and tries to bring a mysterious meteor crashing to Earth. Savage, an immortal, gained his immortality from the meteor, {{and is trying to}} bring it back so he may gain even more power. After stopping Savage in this time period by hurling him into the sphere he was using to draw the meteor to Earth, Joshua swears an oath that he and his family will now and forevermore be sworn enemies of Savage and will prevent his mad schemes to protect the future. Unfortunately, Joshua himself is subsequently tried for heresy and burnt at the stake due to the impossible nature of his story causing the Templar leaders to assume that he stole the gold himself, prompting Savage to wistfully comment that <b>he</b> <b>always</b> <b>wins.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Lightning, {{known as}} the Athletic Overachiever, is strong and {{athletic}}, while being an over-achiever who says that <b>he</b> <b>always</b> <b>wins</b> and never loses. However, Lightning is very arrogant and doesn't want to help his team. Also, Lightning loves to talk about himself. Lightning always loves saying [...] "-sha" [...] in mostly every word he says. Despite his athletic prowess, he isn't very intelligent and even believes that Jo is a boy since {{she is the only}} one who can really keep up with him. His competitive drive causes him to get to the end of the season and almost win until Cameron ultimately edges him out in the end. His jersey is similar to the jerseys issued to the San Diego Chargers. However, in the alternate ending, he wins and says he's going to use the money to buy his own stadium to train in, though he has to heal from a broken leg first. He also ends up with white hair.

50|$|Dōsaku was {{the fourth}} Hon'inbō {{by the time he}} was 32, and the fourth Meijin {{by the time he was}} 33. He started to learn Go at 7. Dōsaku was so strong by the time he was in his early 20's that even if someone played the first move, <b>he</b> would <b>always</b> <b>win.</b> Rumors were that he was two stones {{stronger}} than any other Go player. This was due to his deep thinking and next-level tactics. He laid the foundation for opening strategy in the Golden Period.|$|R
50|$|Besides being temperamentally unsuited, Grant was {{too short}} to dance princes and aristocrats in fairy-tale ballets in the classic repertory. He did, however, possess a decent {{classical}} technique, and he was sometimes thrust into the challenge of clean-lined classicism in such Ashton ballets as Symphonic Variations, Les Patineurs, and Scènes de Ballet. But character roles were his forte. He gave more than fifty performances {{in the title role}} of Michel Fokine's Petrushka, and he was acclaimed as the eccentric Doctor Coppélius and the mysterious Herr Drosselmeyer in Coppėlia and Casse Noisette, respectively. He also scored success as the Rake in The Rake's Progress and as Satan in Job, both created by Ninette de Valois, and as the Spanish Miller in The Three-Cornered Hat by Massine. Cast in the role originated by Massine, <b>he</b> <b>always</b> <b>won</b> applause for his performance of the smolderingly intense farruca, a solo form of flamenco. In A Month in the Country (1976), based on Ivan Turgenev's comedy of manners, he offered a moving image of a lovelorn Russian husband, opposite Lynn Seymour as the heroine. It was his final Ashton role.|$|R
5000|$|After {{realizing that}} <b>he</b> <b>always</b> <b>won</b> {{at the game}} Pictionary, but lost more than {{frequently}} at the game Scrabble, Tait {{decided to make a}} game where everyone could win at something. Drawing inspiration from the HBDI thinking styles assessment they completed at Microsoft, Tait and Alexander aimed to create a [...] "Whole Brain" [...] game. Taking certain aspects of other favorite games, Cranium requires players to spell, draw, mold clay, and answer trivia questions. Tait and Alexander created [...] "a board-game where everyone has heroic moments". Cranium, Inc. tested and modified their new game over and over. They knew they had a hit game on their hands when one day the game testers tried to steal the game. Without having a retail outlet to sell their game, Cranium, Inc. ordered 20,000 units to be manufactured in China. Cranium, Inc. did have big name investors, such as Starbucks, where they were able to raise US$35 million. Cranium, Inc. went on to win over 130 awards and sell over 22 million games and toys. The company was bought out by Hasbro on January 4, 2008 for $77.5 million.|$|R

5000|$|A direct {{descendant}} of the Kowloon King of 10 years and is known as Cassa's [...] "younger brother." [...] He is extremely hot-headed and loves to fight. Despite his adolescent appearance, he is well versed in swordsmanship, martial arts, and vampiric power. He tends to act mainly on his own ambitions aside from his orders. His ambitions consist mainly of challenging strong foes, {{with the assumption that}} <b>he</b> will <b>always</b> <b>win.</b> <b>He</b> is easily antagonized, especially if he feels that he is not being taken seriously. He harbors a strong jealousy towards Jiro, although he angrily denies it. He is nearly beat to death by Cain, and is sliced into death by Jiro in the end.|$|R

He is very good at cards and billiards, and although <b>he</b> does not <b>always</b> <b>win</b> <b>he</b> is able to earn cash by betting against less talented gamblers. He is heavily indebted throughout most of the book, not so much for his own expenses as for Becky's. Not particularly talented as a military officer, he is content to let Becky manage his career.|$|R
50|$|McDowell {{started out}} {{his career at}} the age of three racing BMX bicycles. <b>He</b> would <b>always</b> <b>win</b> his {{division}} because there were not any other three- or four-year-olds to compete against. At the start of each race, someone would have to hold him in the starting gate because his feet did not reach the ground. Then, when McDowell was eight years old, he moved to karting with help from his mother Tracy, his father Bill, and his older brother Billy, who were all avid race fans. After ten years in karts, he would win not only the World Karting Association championship, but he would also take back to back undefeated International Kart Federation championships, along with 18 consecutive feature wins.|$|R

He admits to Hank that <b>he</b> <b>always</b> wanted to <b>win</b> in battle but accepted defeat when his men did their best. Through tough love and intense physical therapy, Cotton also helped Peggy walk again after a debilitating skydiving accident. Hank was initially wary of this, because he feared that Cotton was simply taking advantage of Peggy's brief disability in order to humiliate her.|$|R

He was handily elected to a full term in 1970, and was reelected 16 times. His district number changed as Illinois lost congressional seats—from the 13th (1969-73) to the 12th (1973-93) to the 8th (1993-2005). His district was long considered the most Republican district in the Chicago area, if not in all of Illinois. <b>He</b> almost <b>always</b> <b>won</b> with 70 {{percent or more of the}} vote until the 1990s, when he had to fend off more moderate Republicans in the primary and better-funded Democrats in the general election.|$|R
