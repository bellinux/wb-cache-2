He took coursework at the Art Center College of Design, and in 1989 <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>class</b> on product-design he created a machine apparatus {{similar to that used}} by the character portrayed by Sigourney Weaver in the film Aliens. He received his degree in industrial design from that institution with honors in 1990. Following his graduation, Page instructed students at the Switzerland location of the Art Center College of Design. Along with his studio partner Scott Robertson, he began work in the field of design consulting.|$|E
5|$|By 1928 the Southern Railway {{was well}} served by large 4-6-0 express {{passenger}} locomotives, {{but there was an}} urgent need <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>class</b> to fulfill intermediate roles throughout the system. Maunsell’s previous attempt at developing his predecessor’s L class for this task had proven a disappointment, and the Drummond D15 and L12 classes were approaching the end of their useful lives on these services. An entirely new secondary express passenger locomotive was required to operate over the main lines throughout the system including those that had relatively short turntables.|$|E
5|$|Design 1047, {{also known}} as Project 1047, {{was a series of}} plans <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>class</b> of Dutch battlecruisers prior to the Second World War. The ships were {{intended}} to counter a perceived threat posed by Imperial Japanese aggression to the Dutch colonies in the East Indies. Dutch intelligence believed that the Imperial Japanese Navy would deploy its capital ships (aircraft carriers and battleships) against their counterparts of the United States Navy and the British Royal Navy, leaving heavy and light cruisers, along with seaplane carriers, as the largest ships available for an advance into the East Indies. As such, the 1047s were shaped by the {{need to be able to}} fight their way through a fleet composed of these ships and smaller destroyers. It was hoped that this capability would allow the battlecruisers to act as a fleet in being.|$|E

5|$|Keith and Vinnie {{debate on}} Piz’s radio show, and Vinnie gathers some support about his lax underage {{drinking}} policy. Wallace notices someone following him, {{and the student}} wants to recruit him for a secret society. Vinnie insults Keith’s handling of his home life, and Veronica hits {{him on the head}} lightly. She helps Weevil retrace his steps and notices one of her criminology classmates, Jenny (Dianna Agron), involved with one of Weevil’s clients. Veronica deduces that Jenny and her circle of friends are responsible for creating the fake student IDs, disseminating them, and implicating Weevil. Logan and Dick (Ryan Hansen) go surfing, and they run into Veronica, Piz, and Mac helping Wallace (Percy Daggs III) with his final project <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>class.</b> Veronica learns that one of Jenny’s group lives in the same town in Georgia where the student ID machines are made.|$|E

The presence of fecal coliforms (like E. Coli) serves as an indication of contamination by sewage.
