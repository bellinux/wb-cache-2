50|$|In the Minardi pit garage, {{the car of}} Gianmaria Bruni {{caught fire}} after fuel escaped from the hose onto the hot {{bodywork}} during a routine pit-stop, and it was put out without any serious injury. Bruni inhaled some of the <b>extinguishant</b> and was having trouble breathing and so the team decided to retire the car.|$|E
50|$|FS 49 C2 acts {{similarly}} to an inert gas. The heat produced from the combustion process is {{absorbed by the}} <b>extinguishant.</b> This mechanism {{is consistent with the}} observation that there is no decrease in the fire heat release rate as long as the amount of extinguishment agent added is below a certain limit, and as soon as more extinguishment agent is added the fire is then extinguished.|$|E
50|$|While {{the exact}} {{composition}} of the armor has still not been released, it has been confirmed that K1 is equipped with composite armor similar to Chobham. The vehicle is also equipped with an automatic fire extinguishing system. The engine compartment detector is thermocouple wire, and the crew compartment detector is an optical sensor. The <b>extinguishant</b> used is Halon1301, commonly used by western main battle tanks. While the air conditioning system is installed to aid in crew comfort, the vehicle lacks an overpressure system for CBRN defense, and is not protected from chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear attacks, requiring the crew to don protective gear while operating in a contaminated environment.|$|E

50|$|In 1993, 3M {{considered}} fluorocarbons as fire <b>extinguishants</b> {{to replace}} CFCs.

40|$|Abstract. The {{existing}} fire-extinguishing {{plants have}} a lot of problems. For example, the amount of <b>extinguishant</b> is very large, mix is uneven, <b>extinguishant</b> is easy to splash, harmful to the human, the system structure is complex, spray nozzle is demanding and so on. And the open literature sources on the marine fire hydrant are very few. Besides because of the difficulty of numerical simulation of two-phase flow, the research on numerical simulation of the marine fire hydrant is hardly any. In this thesis, a new-style marine fire hydrant is designed to be small volume, easy to use and low pressure lost. It blends the gas to water through its special structure. It regards the gas-water mixture as the <b>extinguishant.</b> In this way, the water flow can be soften, and reduce the splash. The <b>extinguishant</b> can overlay the burnable body uniformly. At last, reach the better <b>extinguishant</b> under the dual effect of the oxygen exclusion and cooling...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT (U) The {{halogenated}} extinguishants Halon 1301, HFC- 227 ea (FM 200) and NAF-S-III used within Royal Australian Navy vessels {{for total}} flooding fire suppression applications have hydrogen fluoride (HF) toxicity concerns. HF is readily produced when these extinguishants {{are subjected to}} elevated temperatures and is highly toxic in small concentrations. In the open literature, water spray {{used in conjunction with}} halogenated extinguishants has been reported to reduce peak HF production during extinguishment as well as increasing the HF decay rate. This data is summarised as a function of compartment sizes, type of <b>extinguishant,</b> spray initiation time prior to the <b>extinguishant</b> release, spray duration and the spray application rate. However, the use of water spray in conjunction with halogenated extinguishants still resulted in HF levels above the Occupational Health and Safety workplace maximums and exceeded the Immediate Danger to Life and Health level. This paper describes the production of HF from halogenated extinguishants and the factors contributing to the amount of HF produced...|$|E

40|$|CONTEXT: Although {{there are}} ample {{data on the}} {{respiratory}} effects of exposure to fire extinguisher gas, the potential hematologic effects have not been fully documented. We conducted this study to determine the possible etiologic agent(s) for a decrease in red blood cells among community residents in Taipei, Taiwan, after they were exposed to leakage of mixed fire <b>extinguishants</b> containing bromotrifluoromethane (CF 3 Br, Halon 1301), bromochlorodifluoromethane (CF 2 BrCl, Halon 1211), and dichlorodifluoromethane (CCl 2 F 2, CFC- 12). CASE PRESENTATION: We studied 117 exposed residents who came into one hospital for physical examinations. We also selected age- and sex-matched referents for comparison from residents {{who came to the}} same hospital for health examinations. Nine months after the exposure to mixed fire <b>extinguishants,</b> 91 of the exposed residents came back for a second physical examination. In the first examination of the exposed residents, we found a significant reduction in red blood cell count and hemoglobin and a relationship between dose and response. DISCUSSION: After excluding iron-deficiency anemia, thalassemia, and other possible agents, we suspected that the hematologic effects might have resulted from pyrolytic products of CFC- 12 and Halon 1211, which may contain phosgene, among other products. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: The acute transient hematologic effects observed in the exposed residents were associated with the incident of leakage of mixed fire-extinguisher gases and were most likely caused by a small amount of pyrolytic products, probably phosgene. Nine months after the exposure, we found a significant improvement in the abnormalities without any specific treatment...|$|R

40|$|The {{proposed}} use of bromotrifluoromethane (CBrF 3) as a fire <b>extinguishant</b> in aircraft, spacecraft and submarines has stimulated {{increasing interest}} {{and research in}} the toxicological properties of this compound. In a spacecraft, because of its unique recirculating life support system, the introduction of CBrF 3 by leakage or intentional discharge, will result in continuous exposure of crewman to low concentrations of this compound for periods of up to 7 days, or possibly even longer.

40|$|Information {{is given}} {{on the water}} {{application}} rate and planning of the need of <b>extinguishants</b> for fighting a forest fire. The suitability of the exhaust-gas extinguishing method and of different explosion-induced extinction methods for land-based forest fire-fighting has been tested. It has been {{found out that the}} exhaust-gas extinguishing method because of water distribution requires high flow rates which cannot be considered economic for the purpose of fighting a forest fire. The explosion-induced extinction methods, i. e. the CF-method (blanketing the fire by soil) and the 3 S-method (blanketing the fire by lime), have been investigated. The CF-method allows the blanketing of major areas, however, it demands rather an extensive use of equipment, and it is time-consuming. The use of the S 3 -method has become out to be cost-saving. Its effectiveness in fighting a forest fire has, however, not yet been fully clarified. (orig.)

2500|$|The haloalkanes (also {{known as}} halogenoalkanes or alkyl halides) are {{a group of}} {{chemical}} compounds derived from alkanes containing one or more halogens. They are {{a subset of the}} general class of halocarbons, although the distinction is not often made. Haloalkanes are widely used commercially and, consequently, are known under many chemical and commercial names. They are used as flame retardants, fire <b>extinguishants,</b> refrigerants, propellants, solvents, and pharmaceuticals. Subsequent to the widespread use in commerce, many halocarbons have also been shown to be serious pollutants and toxins. For example, the chlorofluorocarbons have been shown to lead to ozone depletion. Methyl bromide is a controversial fumigant. Only haloalkanes which contain chlorine, bromine, and iodine are a threat to the ozone layer, but fluorinated volatile haloalkanes in theory may have activity as greenhouse gases. Methyl iodide, a naturally occurring substance, however, does not have ozone-depleting properties and the United States Environmental Protection Agency has designated the compound a non-ozone layer depleter. For more information, see Halomethane. Haloalkane or alkyl halides are the compounds which have the general formula [...] "RX" [...] where R is an alkyl or substituted alkyl group and X is a halogen (F, Cl, Br, I).|$|R
40|$|According to the ADR {{regulations}} (Section 8. 1. 4) vehicles transporting {{dangerous goods}} shall have as minimum a 6 kg dry powder {{portable fire extinguisher}} suitable against fires in brakes, tyres or in the goods. Due {{to the fact that}} there is a doubt in whether a 6 kg dry powder portable fire extinguisher will be sufficient to extinguish a severe fire in a twin tyre, the Directorate for Fire and Explosion Prevention in Norway has initiated a test programme at Norges branntekniske laboratorium as (NBL) for testing of different types of portable fire extinguishers against tyre fires. In addition, a literature study is carried out in order to obtain updated information concerning fire fighting of tyre fires. The objective of the test programme has been to achieve reliable information concerning the fire extinguishing efficiency of different fire <b>extinguishants</b> or agents and to select the best-suited portable fire extinguisher or agent agianst tyre fires. The experience gained from the project will be used in connection with a forthcoming revision of the ADR regulations.

40|$|AbstractThe fire {{extinguisher}} {{is one of}} important fire safety equipments in Taiwan. The ABC powder {{fire extinguisher}} is a common fire safety equipment as it can extinguish different kinds of fire, such as papers, gasoline, electrical fire etc. The main constituents of ABC powders are ammonium dihydrogen phosphate and ammonium sulfate. The principal components of ammonium dihydrogen phosphate <b>extinguishant</b> are inspected according to the molybdenum-vanadium phosphate colorimetry in Section 4 and the volumetric method of quinoline in Section 3. 1 of Taiwan's CNS 8450 - 1992 Method of Test for Fertilizers–Determination of Phosphorus Content, which major project is the determination of phosphorus content. The DSC {{was used in this}} study to inspect the ABC powder of fire extinguishers, the thermal decomposition values of constituents of powder were analyzed directly. Not to determine the phosphorus content indirectly is the key concept in this study.

40|$|Bromotrifluoromethane (CBrF 3), {{commonly}} known as Ha-lon 1301, {{is used as a}} fire <b>extinguishant</b> in the Space Shuttle. Several scenarios, such as a fire or a faulty alarm, could lead to its discharge resulting in a Halon 1301 concentration of up to 1 % in the spacecraft cabin atmosphere. To examine the effects of Halon 1301 on mental performance and physiologic func-tion, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration spon-sored a human inhalation study.

40|$|The space station, a permanently-inhabited {{orbiting}} laboratory, places {{new demands}} on spacecraft fire safety. Long-duration missions may call for more-constrained fire controls, but {{the accessibility of}} the space station {{to a variety of}} users may call for less-restrictive measures. This paper discusses fire safety issues through a review {{of the state of the}} art and a presentation of key findings from a recent NASA Lewis Research Center Workshop. The subjects covered are the fundamental science of low-gravity combustion and the technology advances in fire detection, extinguishment, materials assessment, and atmosphere selection. Key concerns are for the adoption of a fire-safe atmosphere and the substitution for the effective but toxic <b>extinguishant,</b> halon 1301. The fire safety studies and reviews provide several recommendations for further action. One is the expanded research in combustion, sensors, and materials in the low-gravity environment of space. Another is the development of generalized fire-safety standards for spacecraft through cooperative endeavors with aerospace and outside Government and industry sources...|$|E

40|$|For {{more than}} two decades, halon 1301 has been {{protecting}} personnel and valuable aircraft and aerospace equipment from the hazards of fire. Only halon 1301 offered the advantages of being clean, odorless, colorless, electrically non-conductive and safe for occupied areas. However, concerns about the depletion of stratospheric ozone and the resulting Montreal Protocol mandated the production phase-out of halon 1301 on December 31, 1993. Prior to this phase-out, Great Lakes Chemical Corporation, the world's leading manufacturer of halon, directed substantial research efforts toward the rapid development of a safe, clean, and effective halon replacement. Some of the criteria {{for the development of}} a clean agent included: that it be an effective fire extinguisher; that it be safe for personnel; that it be safe for the environment; that it be safe for valuable assets; that it be cost effective; and that it be able to withstand the rigors of independent approvals.
