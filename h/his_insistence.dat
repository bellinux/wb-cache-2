5|$|In the 1950s Chen was {{appointed}} {{director for the}} upcoming film Li Shizhen. However, due to <b>his</b> <b>insistence</b> that the director, rather than government administrators, have artistic control, he was dismissed and the film was directed by his friend Shen Fu.|$|E
5|$|Gandhi {{joined the}} Indian National Congress and was {{introduced}} to Indian issues, politics and the Indian people primarily by Gokhale. Gokhale was a key leader of the Congress Party {{best known for his}} restraint and moderation, and <b>his</b> <b>insistence</b> on working inside the system. Gandhi took Gokhale's liberal approach based on British Whiggish traditions and transformed it to make it look Indian.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the star}} guest singers during the Davis years were the sopranos Montserrat Caballé and Leontyne Price, the tenors Carlo Bergonzi, Nicolai Gedda and Luciano Pavarotti and the bass Gottlob Frick. British singers {{appearing}} {{with the company}} included Janet Baker, Heather Harper, John Tomlinson and Richard Van Allan. Davis's tenure, {{at that time the}} longest in The Royal Opera's history, closed in July 1986 not with a gala, but, at <b>his</b> <b>insistence,</b> with a promenade performance of Fidelio with cheap admission prices.|$|E
50|$|On several occasions, Petey has reluctantly played soccer on <b>his</b> mother's <b>insistence.</b> <b>His</b> lack of {{athletic}} skill and social awkwardness {{has resulted in}} multiple out-of-body experiences.|$|R

5000|$|He {{took part}} in the third series of German reality show Ich bin ein Star - Holt mich hier raus! in 2008 but was evicted by RTL Television for making a Nazi salute and singing [...] "Deutschland Über Alles" [...] in the lobby of his hotel shortly before the team left for the jungle, despite <b>his</b> <b>insistences</b> that he was merely joking.|$|R
5|$|Having {{learned about}} the block-booking studio system that almost {{guaranteed}} the studios huge profits, Cagney was determined to spread the wealth. He regularly sent money and goods to old friends from his neighborhood, {{though he did not}} generally make this known. <b>His</b> <b>insistence</b> on no more than four films a year was based on his having witnessed actors—even teenagers—regularly being worked 100 hours a week to turn out more films. This experience was an integral reason for his involvement in forming the Screen Actors Guild in 1933.|$|E
5|$|He {{was asked}} to leave the college in 1908 after {{offering}} a stranded chorus girl tea and his bed for the night when she {{was caught in a}} snowstorm. When she was discovered the next morning by the landladies, Ida and Belle Hall, <b>his</b> <b>insistence</b> that he had slept on the floor was met with disbelief. Glad to be free of the place, he left for Europe soon after, sailing from New York in March 1908.|$|E
5|$|In 1886, Black Allan (later {{known as}} Allan F-1) was born. By the {{stallion}} Allendorf (from the Hambletonian family of Standardbreds) {{and out of}} a Morgan mare named Maggie Marshall, he became the foundation sire of the Tennessee Walking Horse breed. A failure as a trotting horse, due to <b>his</b> <b>insistence</b> on pacing, he was instead used for breeding. From his line, a foal named Roan Allen was born in 1904. Able to perform several ambling gaits, Roan Allen became a successful show horse, and in turn sired several famous Tennessee Walking Horses.|$|E
50|$|Then he {{returned}} home due to <b>his</b> parents' <b>insistence,</b> married, and became a parish priest in a nearby village.|$|R

50|$|At <b>his</b> father's <b>insistence,</b> {{he first}} studied medicine, but he then studied singing with Johann Wenzel Tomaschek and {{composition}} with oboist Josef Triebensee.|$|R
5|$|McNallen is a {{controversial}} {{figure in the}} Heathen and wider Pagan community. His espousal of right-wing ethnonationalist ideas and <b>his</b> <b>insistence</b> that Heathenry should be reserved for those of Northern European ancestry has resulted in accusations of racism from both Pagans and the mainstream media. Conversely, many on the extreme right of the Heathen movement have {{accused him of being}} a race traitor for his opposition to Neo-Nazism and refusal to endorse white supremacism.|$|E
5|$|Olivia met Pound in January 1909 at a Kensington salon {{hosted by}} a friend; she invited him for tea on 16 February 1909, and, at <b>his</b> <b>insistence,</b> {{introduced}} Pound to Yeats in May 1909. Yeats had recently returned to London {{and began a}} thorough investigation of spiritualism and the occult, turning to Olivia for advice. She took the young American poet to Yeats' rooms at Woburn Place, fostering their relationship.|$|E
5|$|After the war Cockcroft {{became the}} {{director}} of the Atomic Energy Research Establishment (AERE) at Harwell, where the low-powered, graphite-moderated GLEEP became the first nuclear reactor to operate in western Europe when it was started on 15 August 1947. This was followed by BEPO in 1948. Harwell was involved {{in the design of the}} reactors and the chemical separation plant at Windscale. Under his direction it took part in frontier fusion research, including the ZETA program. <b>His</b> <b>insistence</b> that the chimney stacks of the Windscale reactors be fitted with filters was mocked as Cockcroft's Folly until the core of one of the reactors ignited and released radionuclides during the Windscale fire of 1957.|$|E
50|$|He was hit {{and wounded}} {{as he and}} his platoon from the 5th Cavalry Regiment came under {{withering}} machine gun fire, But he continued up Hill 312, encouraging his men to meet and defeat the Chinese defense. His Medal of Honor recommendation was prepared for him at <b>his</b> men's <b>insistence.</b> <b>His</b> brother, Second Lieutenant Francis Jerome McGovern was also killed in action, eleven days later.|$|R
50|$|Grimes {{is an avid}} {{singer and}} piano player. He started playing piano at age 7 at <b>his</b> father's <b>insistence.</b> He has two older siblings, a sister and a brother.|$|R
50|$|In 1976 he {{returned}} to Trinidad at <b>his</b> family's <b>insistence</b> and was treated for alcoholism. In 1977 Hugh returned to New York where he died on June 12, 1982.|$|R
5|$|Another {{feature of}} Wood's {{conducting}} was <b>his</b> <b>insistence</b> on accurate tuning; before each rehearsal and concert he would check {{the instrument of}} {{each member of the}} woodwind and string sections against a tuning fork. He persisted in this practice until 1937, when the excellence of the BBC Symphony Orchestra persuaded him that it was no longer necessary. To improve ensemble, Wood experimented with the layout of the orchestra. His preferred layout was to have the first and second violins grouped together on his left, with the cellos to his right, a layout that has since become common.|$|E
5|$|In 1844, {{the family}} hired Fanny Dürbach, a 22-year-old French governess. Four-and-a-half-year-old Tchaikovsky was {{initially}} thought {{too young to}} study alongside his older brother Nikolai and a niece of the family. <b>His</b> <b>insistence</b> convinced Dürbach otherwise. By the age of six, he had become fluent in French and German. Tchaikovsky also became attached to the young woman; her affection for him was reportedly a counter to his mother's coldness and emotional distance from him, though others assert that the mother doted on her son. Dürbach saved much of Tchaikovsky's work from this period, which includes his earliest known compositions, and became a source of several childhood anecdotes.|$|E
5|$|Thompson {{participated in}} the May 15 GOP debate, where he {{discussed}} <b>his</b> <b>insistence</b> to trim bureaucracy in the federal government, and {{his support for the}} advancements made in stem cell research, lauding the achievements of the his alma mater University of Wisconsin–Madison in the field. He was asked what he would do {{in the event of a}} looming preemptive attack against a hypothetical anti-American nation promoting terrorism. The candidate quoted former Secretary of State Colin Powell reflecting the need to be sure the intelligence was correct, to deploy the right amount of troops and to make sure that an exit strategy was planned. Following the debate, Thompson campaigned in New Hampshire before taking a break for the rest of the month.|$|E

50|$|His son Radu {{was married}} to Ioana (née Dumitrescu), who {{had an affair with}} Prince Nicholas {{beginning}} in 1927; probably at <b>his</b> parents' <b>insistence,</b> Radu obtained a divorce the following year.|$|R
5|$|Abu Nuwar's enmity with Glubb Pasha, the Arab Legion's {{powerful}} British {{chief of}} staff, <b>his</b> <b>insistence</b> on establishing Arab command over {{the army and}} his influence with Hussein led the latter to dismiss Glubb Pasha and appoint Abu Nuwar in his place. However, Abu Nuwar's ardent support for the pan-Arabist policies of Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser contributed to Jordan's increasing isolation from the UK and the US, which were major sources of foreign aid to Jordan. At the same time, existing dissatisfaction with Abu Nuwar's leadership by palace officials and veteran Bedouin army units culminated into violent confrontations at the large army barracks in Zarqa between royalist and Arab nationalist units. Two principal accounts emerged regarding the events at Zarqa, with the royalist version holding that the incident was an abortive coup by Abu Nuwar against Hussein, and the dissident version asserting {{that it was a}} staged, American-backed counter-coup by Hussein against the pan-Arabist movement in Jordan. In any case, Abu Nuwar resigned and was allowed to leave Jordan for Syria. He was subsequently sentenced to 15 years in absentia.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the {{expedition}} it took the combined efforts of two relief ships and the use of explosives to free Discovery from the ice. <b>His</b> <b>insistence</b> during {{the expedition}} on Royal Navy formalities had made for uneasy relations with the merchant navy contingent, many of whom departed for home with the first relief ship in March 1903. Second-in-command Albert Armitage, a merchant officer, was offered the chance to go home on compassionate grounds, but chose to interpret the offer as a personal slight, and refused. Armitage also promoted the idea that the decision to send Shackleton home on the relief ship arose from Scott's animosity rather than Shackleton's physical breakdown. Although there were later tensions between Scott and Shackleton, when their polar ambitions directly clashed, in public mutual civilities were preserved; Scott joined in the official receptions that greeted Shackleton on his return in 1909 after the Nimrod Expedition, and the two were exchanging polite letters about their respective ambitions in 1909–10.|$|E
5|$|During the mid-1990s, {{television}} critics praised Jennings for <b>his</b> <b>insistence</b> on {{not letting}} the O.J. Simpson murder case swamp the newscast. Instead, Jennings devoted his energies to covering the War in Bosnia and Herzegovina, anchoring three hour-long prime time specials {{on the subject}} and one Saturday-morning special aimed at children. ABC dedicated more time to covering the conflict than any other network from 1992 to 1996. Jennings received the Goldsmith Career Award for Excellence in Journalism from the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, in large part for his passion for the story. Jennings was also credited for raising the profile in the U.S. of another international story, the 1995 Quebec referendum. The Canadian press in particular raved about his in-depth coverage of the issue, {{and he was the}} only anchor to broadcast from Canada {{on the eve of the}} referendum.|$|E

5|$|However, Hornsby {{was often}} {{hard to get}} along with, a major reason he changed teams so {{frequently}} {{in the last decade}} of his career. He usually left due to falling out with the front office. Most of the players he managed did not like him due to <b>his</b> <b>insistence</b> that others follow his lifestyle, although some (like Woody English and Clint Courtney) did. Hornsby never played cards, but he did bet frequently on horse races, and he lost more than he won. His gambling was often a factor in his dismissal from a team. By most contemporary accounts, he was at least as mean and nasty as Cobb, who was known in his time for his aggressive attitude and dirty play. He never went to movies or read books, convinced that it would harm a batter's eyesight, and he never smoked or drank.|$|E
5|$|When {{it came to}} biography, Johnson {{disagreed}} with Plutarch's use of biography to praise and to teach morality. Instead, Johnson believed in portraying the biographical subjects accurately and including any negative aspects of their lives. Because <b>his</b> <b>insistence</b> on accuracy in biography was little short of revolutionary, Johnson had to struggle against a society that was unwilling to accept biographical details that {{could be viewed as}} tarnishing a reputation; this became the subject of Rambler 60. Furthermore, Johnson believed that biography should not be limited to the most famous and that the lives of lesser individuals, too, were significant; thus in his Lives of the Poets he chose both great and lesser poets. In all his biographies he insisted on including what others would have considered trivial details to fully describe the lives of his subjects. Johnson considered the genre of autobiography and diaries, including his own, as one having the most significance; in Idler 84 he explains how a writer of an autobiography would be the least likely to distort his own life.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} years of the new century, Ravel made five {{attempts}} to win France's most prestigious prize for young composers, the Prix de Rome, past winners of which included Berlioz, Gounod, Bizet, Massenet and Debussy. In 1900 Ravel was eliminated in the first round; in 1901 he won the second prize for the competition. In 1902 and 1903 he won nothing: according to the musicologist Paul Landormy, the judges suspected Ravel of making fun of them by submitting cantatas so academic as to seem like parodies. In 1905 Ravel, by now thirty, competed for the last time, inadvertently causing a furore. He was eliminated in the first round, which even critics unsympathetic to his music, including Lalo, denounced as unjustifiable. The press's indignation grew when it emerged that the senior professor at the Conservatoire, Charles Lenepveu, was on the jury, and only his students were selected for the final round; <b>his</b> <b>insistence</b> that this was pure coincidence was not well received. L'affaire Ravel became a national scandal, leading to the early retirement of Dubois and his replacement by Fauré, appointed by the government to carry out a radical reorganisation of the Conservatoire.|$|E

As a teenager, Joel took up boxing so he could defend himself. He boxed successfully on the amateur Golden Gloves circuit for a short time, winning 22 bouts, but abandoned the sport shortly after his nose was broken in his 24th boxing match.|$|R
