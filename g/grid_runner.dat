5000|$|<b>Grid</b> <b>Runner</b> (known as Grid Run in Europe) is {{an action}} game {{developed}} by Radical Entertainment {{and published by}} Virgin Interactive for the Sega Saturn, PlayStation and Microsoft Windows in 1996. It was first announced under the title [...] "Eurit".|$|E
5000|$|According to Virgin Interactive {{producer}} Stacy Hendrickson, {{the developer}} Radical Entertainment thought of <b>Grid</b> <b>Runner</b> as a [...] "fun, original alternative two-player game" [...] {{that would be}} neither a fighting or a sports title about a decade before the game was finally made, and that they also put [...] "a {{lot of work on}} the AI" [...] of single-player enemies. All of the game's cast of characters have been first sketched on paper, then turned into sculptures, before finally being rendered in 3D to limit the use of [...] "work-intensive, expensive rendering workstations".|$|E
5000|$|<b>Grid</b> <b>Runner</b> is a {{top-down}} game {{similar to}} tag. The {{object of the}} game is to capture a set amount of flags scattered around the playfield by touching them. Upon starting the game, two players must race to find the first flag. The first player to get to this flag will capture it, indicated by the flag changing to that player's color. The other player is marked as [...] "it" [...] and must then hunt down the other player, [...] "tagging" [...] them and making them [...] "it" [...] instead. Only the player not marked as [...] "it" [...] may capture flags. Flags which one player has already captured can be recaptured by the other player.|$|E
