50|$|For {{the role}} the Admiralty sought out small, quick, {{manoeuvrable}} vessels; it drew many from among the Clyde Shipping Company's coastal passenger transports. The requisitioned passenger ships had a speed of 11 to 12 knots, which enabled them, after completing their rescue operations, {{to catch up with}} the convoys travelling at 10 knots. Although these vessels had not been built for the Atlantic or the Arctic, none was lost to Atlantic storms; one did <b>ice-up</b> and founder off the coast of Newfoundland.|$|E
50|$|According to the MDFW:This pond {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular ponds in southeastern Massachusetts for ice fishing, being one of the first ponds to <b>ice-up</b> and one of the last to lose its ice. Due to {{excellent}} access, the pond is heavily fished. Abundant weed growth in the summer can make fishing and boating difficult. In response to this, the town of Norton once purchased and operated a weed-harvesting machine on the pond during the summer. Fisherman can expect catches of chain pickerel and largemouth bass with an occasional northern pike of ten pounds or more...|$|E
40|$|The {{proposed}} hybrid control {{employs a}} primary expansion valve that provides {{most of the}} pressure drop, while small secondary balancing valves in the distributor lines to the evaporator circuits adjust the refrigerant flow to provide equal circuit exit superheats. This paper presents experimental results for application of hybrid control of expansion valves to a 5 -ton R 410 A domestic heat pump. Baseline performance data was taken with an electronic expansion valve (EXV) {{to determine the best}} possible performance without using individual circuit flow control. After that, secondary balancing valves were inserted into the distributor lines to complete the hybrid control scheme. The same tests as done with the EXV were repeated to determine the achievable performance improvement. <b>Ice-up</b> tests at high outdoor humidity were conducted to determine the influence of the control scheme on frost build up and system performance. For repeatable results, additional tests with a partially blocked evaporator coil were conducted. It was found that during operation with the EXV, even with a clean coil, substantial maldistribution occurred leading to individual circuits with significantly different refrigerant exit conditions. With the EXV control scheme maintaining an overall exit superheat, some circuits had two-phase refrigerant at the exit while other circuits had a high degree of superheat. As a result, the evaporation temperature was lower than would occur for more even distribution leading to a performance penalty. In addition, the maldistribution resulted in uneven ice build-up during the <b>ice-up</b> test. The tests with the hybrid control scheme indicated that the maldistribution can be avoided and better overall performance achieved. Similar tests as for the domestic heat pump have been conducted for a 3 -ton large room cooling system; refer to companion paper Bach et al. (2012) ...|$|E
40|$|The hybrid control, as {{proposed}} by Kim et al. (2008), employs a primary expansion valve that provides most of the pressure drop, while small secondary balancing valves in the distributor lines to the circuits of the evaporator adjust the refrigerant flow to provide equal circuit exit superheats. This paper shows the experimental results {{for the application of}} the hybrid control of expansion valves for a 3 -ton R 404 A large room cooling system. Data with the inbuilt expansion device, a pressure compensated TXV, was taken for a limited number of tests. Baseline data with an electronic expansion valve was taken to determine the best possible performance without using individual circuit flow control. After that, secondary balancing valves were inserted into the distributor lines to complete the hybrid control scheme. The same tests as done with the EXV were repeated to determine the achievable performance improvement. <b>Ice-up</b> tests at high indoor room humidity were conducted with all control schemes to determine the influence of the control scheme on frost build up and system performance. For repeatable results, additional tests with partially blocked evaporator coil were conducted with the hybrid and EXV control scheme. It was found that for TXV and EXV, even with a clean coil, substantial maldistribution occurs. This maldistribution lead to different usage of the individual circuits in terms of area fraction used for evaporation of, and area fraction used for superheating of refrigerant. With the EXV control scheme, the evaporation temperature had to be decreased to obtain sufficient superheat on the circuits that did not feed liquid into the suction header in order to evaporate the liquid of the circuits that fed liquid into the suction header. In addition, this resulted in uneven ice build-up and very poor controllability, which was especially noticeable as severe hunting when using the TXV in the <b>ice-up</b> test. With the hybrid control scheme, the surface usage for evaporation on all circuits was larger than 75 % for most of the time, which resulted in a higher evaporation temperature and by that in a greater COP and larger capacity...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. S.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2016 Burbot Lota lota are a cold water, benthic, {{primarily}} {{piscivorous species}} that inhabits {{lakes and rivers}} throughout their Holarctic distribution. Habitat requirements for Burbot are still poorly understood, {{in part due to}} the disregard this species has received in fisheries management plans. From June 2009 through September 2011, I investigated the seasonal movements and bathymetric distribution of Burbot in Tanada and Copper lakes, Alaska, using archival tags programmed to record water depth and temperature. One hundred and forty Burbot (70 in each lake) were surgically implanted with archival tags, and 1 year later fish were recaptured to retrieve the archived data (Tanada Lake: 15 fish; Copper Lake: 9 fish). During the ice-out period in spring (mid-May through June), Burbot initiated a migration to the littoral zone (mean depth = 10. 72 m; mean internal temperature = 9. 4 °C). In the summer months (July and August) when lakes were stratified and photoperiod was nearly constant, Burbot occupied the thermocline (mean depth = 7. 28 m; mean internal temperature = 12. 1 °C). During fall months prior to the <b>ice-up</b> period (September and October), occupancy depth shifted to the profundal zone (mean depth = 22. 09 m; mean internal temperature = 6. 3 °C). Under the ice, Burbot remained in the profundal zone and a putative spawning period was observed during February and March when Burbot from both lakes migrated from the profundal zone to ≤ 5 m in depth (mean internal temperature = 2. 1 °C). Throughout the year Burbot displayed a pattern of diel vertical movements with activity levels peaking during crepuscular hours. However, during the summer when photoperiod was nearly constant, Burbot were relatively sedentary, with only 22 % of depth records indicating movement (changes in depth ≥ 1 m). Results from this study indicate that photoperiod and water temperature were highly correlated with seasonal depth occupancy and activity levels in Burbot...|$|E
