5|$|It was {{reported}} that Madonna's appearance on the show was to promote her album American Life (2003). Many believed that the guest spot on the show would be <b>good</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> singer, following her appearance in the film 2002 film Swept Away, which was a box office disappointment. Her manager, however, insisted that Madonna's guest spot was not an attempt to showcase her acting abilities.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} 1977 tape of Lennon {{singing the}} song was recorded on a mono cassette, with vocals and piano on the same track.

5|$|Utilitarian philosopher John Stuart Mill criticised Kant for {{not realizing}} that moral laws are {{justified}} by a moral intuition based on utilitarian principles (that the greatest <b>good</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> greatest number ought to be sought). Mill argued that Kant's ethics could not explain why certain actions are wrong without appealing to utilitarianism. As basis for morality, Mill believed that his principle of utility has a stronger intuitive grounding than Kant's reliance on reason, and can better explain why certain actions are right or wrong.|$|E

5|$|Hinckley was {{convinced}} {{that he would be}} Foster's equal if he became a national figure. He decided to emulate Bickle and began stalking President Jimmy Carter. He was surprised at {{how easy it was to}} get close to the president—he was only a foot away at one event—but was arrested in October 1980 at Nashville International Airport for illegal possession of firearms. Carter had made a campaign stop there, but the FBI did not connect this arrest to the President and did not notify the United States Secret Service. His parents briefly placed him under the care of a psychiatrist. Hinckley subsequently turned his attention to Ronald Reagan whose election, he told his parents, would be <b>good</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> country. He wrote three or four more notes to Foster in early March 1981. Foster gave these notes to her dean, who gave them to the Yale police department, who sought but failed to track Hinckley down.|$|E

5|$|In December 1800 George Austen {{unexpectedly}} {{announced his}} decision to retire from the ministry, leave Steventon, and move the family to 4, Sydney Place in Bath. While retirement and travel were <b>good</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> elder Austens, Jane Austen was shocked to be told she was moving from the only home she had ever known. An indication of her state of mind is her lack of productivity as a writer during the time she lived at Bath. She {{was able to make}} some revisions to Susan, and she began and then abandoned a new novel, The Watsons, but there was nothing like the productivity of the years 1795–1799. Tomalin suggests this reflects a deep depression disabling her as a writer, but Honan disagrees, arguing Austen wrote or revised her manuscripts throughout her creative life, except for a few months after her father died.|$|E
5|$|In the South Indian {{kingdom of}} Cholapuram Paalayam {{in the year}} 1771, Raja Mokkaiyappar and his queen, Rajamatha Bhavani Ammaiyar are desperate for a child, as all their {{previous}} twenty-two children have died at birth. Unknown to them, Bhavani's brother, Sangilimayan, {{who is also the}} Rajaguru (High priest), is {{responsible for the death of}} their children. Sangilimayan is shocked to see that his sister has given birth to twins. Before informing the king about the birth, he calls the palace astrologer, Chinnavadayaan, who predicts that the elder twin will be incapable of making decisions on his own while the younger one will be smarter. Sangilimayan orders the palace doctor, Kailasakaruppan, to kill the younger one, but Chinnavadayaan tells Sangilimayan that his actions would not be <b>good</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> kingdom. Instead, Sangilimayan orders the palace doctor to abandon the child in a nearby river. The elder child is named Pulikecei XXIII. Maragathavalli, Kailasakaruppan's childless wife, rescues the abandoned child from the river, and the couple decides to raise him as their own, naming him Ukraputhan.|$|E

Cerie Xerox (Katrina Bowden), Liz's assistant, obtains Donald's birth certificate and gives it to Liz and Pete; the two learn that Donald is forty years of age, thus confirming their suspicions about him. Liz tells Tracy about this, but Tracy knew all about Donald's scam, explaining he decided {{to go along with it}} because Donald was putting all of the money into a dojo and doing <b>good</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> community.|$|E

5|$|On February 18, 2011, Brewer {{was traded}} to the Tampa Bay Lightning for Brock Beukeboom and Tampa Bay's third-round {{selection}} in the 2011 NHL Entry Draft. In 22 games with Tampa Bay, he notched a goal and an assist. He also led the Lightning in average ice time per game, with 21:34. At the end of the 2010–11 season, Brewer recorded a career-high nine goals and also amassed 81 penalty minutes, <b>good</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> second-highest total of his NHL career. He also appeared in a career-high 18 post-season contests with the Lightning in the 2011 playoffs, registering three goals and 17 points, helping the Bolts in their first playoff appearance in four seasons. During the 2011 playoffs, he set a career-high with three points in Game 2 of the Eastern Conference Quarter-finals against the Pittsburgh Penguins and ranked third among all post-season skaters with 51 blocked shots. On June 24, 2011, Brewer signed a four-year, $15.4 million contract extension with the Lightning.|$|E
5|$|Pinafore {{opened on}} 25 May 1878 at the Opera Comique, before an {{enthusiastic}} audience, with Sullivan conducting. Soon, however, the piece suffered from weak ticket sales, generally ascribed to a heat wave {{that made the}} Opera Comique particularly uncomfortable. The historian Michael Ainger questions this explanation, at least in part, stating that the heat waves {{in the summer of}} 1878 were short and transient. By mid-August, Sullivan wrote to his mother that cooler weather had arrived, which was <b>good</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> show. In the meantime, the four partners of the Comedy Opera Company lost confidence in the opera's viability and posted closing notices. Carte publicised the piece by presenting a matinee concert performance on 6 July 1878 at the enormous Crystal Palace.|$|E
5|$|Retinopathy of {{prematurity}} (ROP) {{in infants}} frequently regresses without intervention and eyesight may be normal in later years.

Although surgery is usually successful in restoring the anatomy of the eye, damage to the nervous system by the progression of the disease leads to comparatively poorer results in restoring vision. The presence of other complicating diseases also reduces {{the likelihood of a}} favourable outcome.|$|E

5|$|The Rights of Men indicts monarchy and {{hereditary}} distinctions {{and promotes}} a republican ideology. Relying on 17th- and early 18th-century notions of republicanism, Wollstonecraft maintains that virtue {{is at the}} core of citizenship. However, her notion of virtue is more individualistic and moralistic than traditional Commonwealth ideology. The goals of Wollstonecraft's republicanism are the happiness and prosperity of the individual, not the greatest <b>good</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> greatest number or the greatest benefits for the propertied. While she emphasizes the benefits that will accrue to the individual under republicanism, she also maintains that reform can only be effected at a societal level. This marks a change from her earlier texts, such as Original Stories from Real Life (1788), in which the individual plays the primary role in social reform.|$|E
5|$|While <b>good</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> King's Bench, the Common Pleas became {{suspicious}} of the new developments, as legal fictions such as the Bill of Middlesex damaged its own business. Fighting against the King's Bench in a reactionary and increasingly conservative way, an equilibrium was eventually reached in the 17th century. Reaching an acceptable medium with the Common Pleas and Exchequer of Pleas {{proved to be the}} downfall of all three courts; with several courts of near-identical jurisdiction, there was little need for separate bodies, and the superior courts of Westminster were merged by the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1873 into a single High Court of Justice. The King's Bench thus ceased to exist, except as the King's Bench (now Queen's Bench) Division of the High Court.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the war the LSO had to face new competition. The BBC SO and the LPO {{had survived}} the war intact, the latter, {{abandoned}} by Beecham, as a self-governing body. All three were quickly overshadowed by two new orchestras: Walter Legge's Philharmonia and Beecham's Royal Philharmonic (RPO). To survive, the LSO played in hundreds of concerts of popular classics under undistinguished conductors. By 1948 the orchestra was anxious to resume promoting its own concert series. The players decided to accept the Arts Council's conditions for subsidy, and changed the LSO's constitution to replace profit-sharing with salaries. With a view to raising its playing standards it engaged Josef Krips as conductor. His commitments in Vienna preventing him from becoming the LSO's chief conductor until 1950, but from his first concert with the orchestra in December 1948 he influenced the playing for the better. His chosen repertoire was <b>good</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> box office: cycles of Beethoven symphonies and concertos (the latter featuring Wilhelm Kempff in one season and Claudio Arrau in another) helped restore the orchestra's finances as well as its musical standards. With Krips and others the orchestra recorded extensively for the Decca Record Company during the early 1950s. The orchestra's workload in these years was second only to the other self-governing London orchestra, the LPO: the LPO played 248 concerts in the 1949–50 season; the LSO 103; the BBC SO 55; the Philharmonia and RPO 32 each. When the Royal Festival Hall opened in 1951 the LSO and LPO engaged in a mutually bruising campaign for sole residency there. Neither was successful, and the Festival Hall became the main London venue for both orchestras and for the RPO and Philharmonia.|$|E
