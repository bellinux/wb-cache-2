Rather than extract these fields in isolation, {{in this paper}} we present a record extraction system that clusters fields together into records (i. e. database tuples). We construct a probabilistic model of the compatibility of field values, then employ graph partitioning algorithms to partition fields into cohesive records. We also investigate compatibility functions over sets of fields, rather than simply pairs of fields, to examine how higher representational power can impact performance.

30|$|The {{adaptation}} layer implementation described here mainly consists in using triggers to emulate contact opportunities. It implies {{the development of}} a new Discovery mechanism in the DTN 2 reference implementation. On each DTN 2 node, the new discovery mechanism is in charge of detecting contact opportunities by connecting to the KauNet trigger communication module and <b>extracting</b> <b>contact</b> information from the trigger values, thus constituting the trigger {{adaptation layer}}. Bundle forwarding is unchanged and carried out over Ethernet on the experimental network according to the announced opportunities and the local DTN 2 node configuration. Regardless if the contact opportunities are predictable or not at higher layers, hooking into the DTN 2 implementation via a custom Discovery adaptation layer allows the emulation of many different flavors of DTNs; the only difference lies in the creation of the contact triggers. The implementation of the custom Discovery mechanism is further described below.|$|E

In this paper, we propose a novel routing scheme, which {{takes advantage of the}} social structure of underlying ‘owners’ and their mobile devices in intermittently connected networks. We focus on routing by utilizing the social contact information. For example, device-owners come into contact with each other during attending regular meetings. We formulate the routing optimization problem, emphasizing the ever-changing network connectivity. Moreover, we propose an algorithm to infer the social structure by <b>extracting</b> <b>contact</b> information from online gathered traces. We further develop a routing protocol for intermittently connected networks based on that. The performance of our protocol is tested using real network traces. It is shown that the protocol is able to achieve a good delivery rate and latency, which is comparable with the optimal routing, and far outperforms the First Contact protocol. Our protocol is incrementally applicable to many current mobile ad hoc routing protocols. 1...|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} model for wave {{propagation}} in a monolayer of spheres on an elastic substrate. The model, which considers sagittally polarized waves, includes: horizontal, vertical, and rotational degrees of freedom; normal and shear coupling between the spheres and substrate, {{as well as between}} adjacent spheres; and the effects of wave propagation in the elastic substrate. For a monolayer of interacting spheres, we find three contact resonances, whose frequencies are given by simple closed-form expressions. For a monolayer of isolated spheres, only two resonances are present. The contact resonances couple to surface acoustic waves in the substrate, leading to mode hybridization and "avoided crossing" phenomena. We present dispersion curves for a monolayer of silica microspheres on a silica substrate, assuming adhesive, Hertzian interactions, and compare calculations using an effective medium approximation to a discrete model of a monolayer on a rigid substrate. While the effective medium model does not account for discrete lattice effects at short wavelengths, we find that it is well suited for describing the interaction between the monolayer and substrate in the long wavelength limit. We suggest that a complete picture of the dynamics of a discrete monolayer adhered to an elastic substrate can be found using a combination of the results presented for the discrete and effective medium descriptions. This model is potentially scalable for use with both micro- and macroscale systems, and offers the prospect of experimentally <b>extracting</b> <b>contact</b> stiffnesses from measurements of acoustic dispersion...|$|E
40|$|A gated four probe {{measurement}} technique to isolate contact resistances in field effect measurements on disordered organic semiconductors was investigated. Organic field effect transistors (OFETs) were prepared with two additional electrodes in the contact geometry protruding into the source-drain channel {{to monitor the}} variation in potential across the channel. Two high impedance electrometers {{were used to determine}} the potential at the contact. This technique allows to directly determine the magnitude of the parasitic contact resistances between metal contact and organic semi-conductor from the drop in potential at the contact regions. The effects of contact resistances, which can falsify measurements on bulk transport parameters such as the field effect mobility, can be then eliminated during material characterization. Additionally, the temperature and electric field dependence of the contact resistances offers valuable information about the charge injection and extraction processes between metal and organic semiconductor. The effects of the four probe geometry, specifically the effect of the channel electrodes on the current-voltage characteristics, of hole transport in a polythiophene (P 3 HT) OFET with Au contacts were investigated and found not to influence device performance, except at currents << 1 nA. The IV characteristics were shown to follow the expected FET behaviour. From the variation in potential along the channel it was found that contact resistances at the source contact (charge injecting contact) are minimal while contact resistances at the drain contact (charge <b>extracting</b> <b>contact)</b> are significant, resulting in a much lower effective source-drain voltage than that applied to the device...|$|E
40|$|Distribution laws of casing {{external}} pressure, {{which are}} obtained by different scholars in different conditions, {{are not the}} same. Thus, a model to calculate the external pressure of casing is established with finite element method. In the model a contact is built between the outer wall of the casing and the inner wall of the cement sheath. The casing external pressure can be got through <b>extracting</b> <b>contact</b> force of results. The numerical results and analysis show that: The largest casing external pressure exists {{in the direction of}} minimum horizontal stress of formation rather than {{in the direction of the}} maximum horizontal stress. There exists such matching between the cement sheath elastic modulus and formation elastic modulus: When the elastic modulus of the cement sheath is small, reducing its value is conducive to reduce the casing external pressure and to prolong casing service life. When the elastic modulus of the cement sheath is large, increasing its value is conducive to reduce the casing external pressure and to prolong casing service life. The casing external pressure will become large with the increase of Poisson's ratio of cement sheath. With the increase of the degree of the formation stress unevenness, the maximum casing external pressure increases and the smallest external decreases. The increasing of the non-uniformity degree of formation stress makes the non-uniformity degree of casing external pressure and the risk of casing failure increase. The study can provide certain reference for drilling workers to take measures to prolong service life of casing...|$|E

Near room temperature effective mobilities inferred from linear regime transconductance are strongly dependent on temperature, gate voltage, and source-drain voltage. As T is reduced below 200 K and at high source-drain bias, we find transport becomes highly nonlinear {{and is very}} strongly modulated by the gate. We consider whether this nonlinear transport is contact limited or a bulk process by examining the length dependence of linear conduction to <b>extract</b> <b>contact</b> and channel contributions to the source-drain resistance.

Impedance spectroscopy, charge extraction and transient photovoltage are used in order to assign the electrical losses initially observed in the current density–voltage curve and understand the main limitation of every design. While inverted devices show competitive performance in terms of charge generation, transport of carriers and also for charge collection at electrodes, standard devices present additional resistive losses that are assigned to charge transfer issues at the active layer/anode interface.
