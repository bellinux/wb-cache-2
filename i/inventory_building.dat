The classical methodologies for seismic vulnerability analysis, as a part of seismic risk analysis, have been formulated with statistical criteria based on a rapid observation.

In this paper, we use the European Macroseismic Scale EMS- 98 to define the relationship between damage and macroseismic intensity to assess the seismic vulnerability.

Aiming at the provision of such information, high spatial and temporal resolution inventories of solar, wind, biomass, water and geothermal electricity generation potentials in Europe are developed at the German Aerospace Center using a GIS (geographic information system). The potential inventories are generated in three steps: resource analysis, area analysis, technology simulation. Data from different sources - remote sensing and statistical data - are harmonised and combined in the GIS and in other data processing programs. The inventories will be linked to a model for balancing potential renewable electricity generation with demand, aggregating regional generation and demand on user defined nodes (e. g. electric power transformation stations) and calculating balancing energy fluxes.

40|$|Supply chains {{can be seen}} as an empirically well {{represented}} case of decentralized decision making systems with co-existence of common (system) objectives and private (firm-specific) interests. A non-trivial supply chain consists of several stages (tiers) where each tier consists of several firms or plants delivering products and services to downstream tiers. The analysis is further complicated by intertemporal heterogeneity (demand changes) as well as task heterogeneity (product differentiation). Not surprisingly, non-parametric approaches have been attempted to supply chain performance assessment with various success. In this paper, we present a general model for supply chain performance assessment where we highlight the (i) the strategic behavioral perspective (decentralization), (ii) the intertemporal perspective (<b>inventory</b> <b>building)</b> and (iii) the competition-cooperative perspective (system limits). We show that DEA is indeed a useful approach for both system-wide and unit-specific evaluation, including the decomposition of productive efficiency in DMU vs chain level effects.

40|$|This thesis aims {{to tackle}} a demand {{seasonality}} problem by building either work-in-process inventory or finished goods inventory before the peak season. A linear programming algorithm is developed {{to determine the}} optimal way for stock building {{in order to satisfy}} the demand with minimum inventory holding cost. An optimization software ILOG OPL Studio 5. 1 is used to solve the LP model to optimality within several seconds. The purpose of the analysis is three fold: (1) to identify the bottleneck processes where the capacities fall short of demand; (2) to generate the optimal stock building policy that minimizes the inventory holding cost; (3) to derive a cost-efficient executable production plan with consideration of the operating labor cost. The strategy outlined can be applied easily in actual manufacturing. This efficient and robust model can be used to obtain optimal stock building policy with various demand and capacity scenarios. It can be a useful tool for the company to develop stock building strategy for future demand with improved installed capacity.

40|$|City Greenhouse Gas (GHG) inventory, a {{framework}} for measuring a city’s detailed emissions from all activities, provides scientific evidence {{for the purpose of}} policy-making. As one of the largest GHG emitters in the world, China aims to reduce CO 2 emissions per unit of GDP to 60 to 65 percent below 2005 levels by 2030. However, city GHG inventories in China have not yet been published by the city governments. Furthermore, previous studies on city inventory accounting are neither complete nor globally comparable. Hence, a case study of Beijing was conducted for the purpose of reporting the city inventory completely and enabling data to be comparable internationally. This research quantifies Beijing’s latest emissions based on available data through multiple methods, including Community-Scale Greenhouse Gas emissions inventories (GPC), a method devised by the Japanese Ministry of Environment (Japanese Ministry of Environment, 2010) and a method from recent academic research on CO 2 emissions in the Chinese iron and steel industry (Zhao, Y. Q., Li, & Li, 2012). According to these methods, Beijing’s GHG emissions were 373, 558, 617 t CO 2 in 2012. Additionally, comparisons between Beijing and six other mega-cities of Shanghai, Tokyo, New York, Washington D. C., London and Paris show that Beijing’s 2012 GHG emission per capita and per 10, 000 CNY GDP ranked the highest.

40|$|In recent years, several field {{measurement}} {{campaigns have}} highlighted {{the importance of}} the organic fraction of aerosol mass, and with such spatial diversity that one may assert that these aerosols are ubiquitous in the troposphere, with particular importance in continental areas. Investigation of the chemical composition of organic aerosol remains a work in progress, but {{it is now clear that}} a significant portion of the total organic mass is composed of secondary organic material, that is, aerosol chemically formed from gaseous volatile organic carbon (VOC) precursors. A number of such precursors, of both biogenic and anthropogenic origin, have been identified. Experimental, <b>inventory</b> <b>building</b> and modelling studies have followed. Laboratory studies have yielded information on the chemical pathways that lead to secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation, and provided the means to estimate the aerosol yields from a given precursor-oxidant reaction. Global inventories of anthropogenic VOC emissions, and of biogenic VOC emitter species distribution and their emission potential have been constructed. Models have been developed that provide global estimates of precursor VOC emissions, SOA formation and atmospheric burdens of these species. This paper estimates the direct and indirect effects of these aerosols using the global climate-aerosol model ECHAM 5 -HAM. For year 2000 conditions, we estimate a global annual mean shortwave (SW) aerosol direct effect due to SOA of &minus; 0. 3 W m&minus; 2 . The model predicts a positive SW indirect effect due to SOA amounting to + 0. 23 W m&minus; 2 , arising from enlargement of particles due to condensation of SOA, together with an enhanced coagulation sink for small particles. Longwave effects are small. Finally, we indicate of areas of research into SOA that are required in order to better constrain our estimates of the influence of aerosols on the climate system...|$|E
40|$|Parking {{space is}} a basic and {{important}} public facility in urban areas. Problems of parking space {{are said to be}} always occuring in urban areas, especially in the city centre or busy commercial and services zones. In Malaysia, the common parking system adopted is shared-parking turn-time system, whereby members of the public share limited parking space in the city centre and have to take turns to keep their vehicle temporarily in parking lots. City centres are said to be suffering from insufficient parking space, forcing people to park their vehicles on road shoulders or outside the gazetted parking lots. This causes traffic congestion and arouses question of sufficiency of parking space in such areas. The basic task in addressing this issue is by carrying out supply and demand analysis of parking space. The objective {{of this study is to}} apply a spatial technique using the Geographic Information System (CIS) in modelling the supply and demand of parking space, taking Johor Bahru city centre as a study case. Maps of buildings, land cadastre, urban land use, and others such as road and street networks are digitally constructed to form a spatial database of supply and demand of parking space in the study area. Attribute data on building <b>inventory,</b> <b>building</b> characteristics, land use, space supply, and demand of parking space are obtained from the Johor Bahru City Council, private parking companies operating in the city, observational, as well as interview surveys in the study area. The shared-parking turn-time model - the "SpaTT model" - is developed to analyse spatial distribution of parking space supply and demand in the study area. The "SpaTT model" is then incorporated into Arc View 3. 1 to determine parking space equilibrium across the study area. This, in turn, is used to determine zones with parking space deficit and, thus, which need additional parking lots. The study discloses that there is reasonable level of parking space equilibrium in the study area. In other words, there is no evidence of acute supply problem of parking space in the Johor Bahru city centre as perceived, although there are zones where additional on-street parking could be provided to add parking supply...|$|E

40|$|The guiding {{theme of}} this thesis is the {{empirical}} analysis of recent food price behavior. It is composed of three applied studies that address the impacts of energy prices on both food price levels and volatility, {{as well as the}} impact of public information release on futures markets of major agricultural commodities. Non-structural time series econometric techniques are applied for such purpose. In the first chapter, the impact of the Spanish biodiesel industry on agricultural feedstock prices is investigated. Both price level and volatility interactions are evaluated. Three relevant prices are considered: the international crude oil price, the Spanish biodiesel blend price and the Spanish sunflower oil price. Weekly Prices are observed from November 2006 to October 2010, yielding a total of 205 observations. Blended biodiesel, sunflower and crude oil prices are found to be interrelated in the long-run. This parity is preserved by the biodiesel industry in order to be in equilibrium. The impact of biodiesel on sunflower oil price levels is found to be very modest, which is reasonable given the small size of the Spanish biodiesel industry. Volatility spillovers between sunflower and biodiesel markets are found to be significant. Evidence of asymmetries in price volatility patterns is also found, with price declines causing more price instability than price increases. Asymmetries can be triggered by the availability of alternative feedstocks in the market, {{as well as by the}} unwillingness of biodiesel producers to increase food prices when feedstocks become more expensive. In the second chapter, the impact of the EU biodiesel market on agricultural feedstock prices is analyzed. The study comprises the period between 06 / 11 / 2008 to 14 / 06 / 2012, and is based on 189 weekly prices. Cointegration analysis suggests that the three prices have a long-run equilibrium relationship that is preserved by the pure biodiesel price. Biodiesel prices are not found to have an effect on rapeseed oil prices. Volatility of pure biodiesel price is affected by its own past volatility and past pure biodiesel and rapeseed market shocks. Also, evidence is found of asymmetries in price volatility, with negative market shocks having a greater impact than positive ones. While pure biodiesel prices cannot affect rapeseed oil price-levels, they can bring instability to these prices. <b>Inventory</b> <b>building</b> and the euro-dollar exchange rate are found to be relevant risk management instruments that can be used to mitigate the biodiesel and rapeseed oil price volatilities. In the third chapter, the impact of public information in the form of USDA-NASS crop production reports on daily corn and soybeans futures prices is evaluated. The study period is between 1970 to 2004, with a total of 700 observations. Results show that USDA-NASS crop production reports significantly affect futures price levels. Report releases at the beginning and at the end of the harvest season are usually the ones exerting a stronger impact. Report releases are not however found to have an effect on price volatility, which suggests gradual price-level changes as a response to published information. Cross-market effects of news are also found to be significant...|$|E
40|$|In today 2 ̆ 7 {{s global}} economy, firms are seeking any and every {{opportunity}} to differentiate from competitors by reducing supply chain costs and adding value to end customers. One increasingly popular option, under growing consumer awareness and increasing legislation, is to reintegrate returned products into the supply chain to achieve economic benefits as well as improve sustainability. An important class of such 2 ̆ 2 reverse 2 ̆ 2 goods flows {{has to do with}} remanufacturing (reman), which refers to activities that restore returned products (2 ̆ 2 cores 2 ̆ 2) or their major modules to operational condition for using in place of new product or distributing through other channels (e. g., spare parts). While opportunities abound, some key complications reported in the literature include: 1) difficulty in timing the launch of reman product (while accounting for uncertainties associated with product life-cycle demand and core supply), 2) difficulty with capacity planning for remanufacturing (while accounting for the fact that volumes can be low and that facilities/lines should target multiple product families for economies of scale), and 3) operational difficulties in maintaining efficiencies in production planning and control of remanufacturing activities. These difficulties are mostly attributable to limited visibility and higher levels of uncertainty in reverse logistics (in comparison with forward logistics). Despite advances in the remanufacturing literature {{in the last two decades}} (both in the academic literature and practitioner community), there is no integrated decision support framework that can guide companies to successful launch and execution of remanufacturing operations. This is particularly true for companies that engage in both original equipment (OE) service as well as the independent after-market (IAM) in the automotive industry. This research aims to address these limitations by developing a decision support framework and necessary models for effective remanufacturing in the automotive industry. At the strategic level, we propose a unified approach to explicitly model and address issues of capacities as well timing the launch of remanufacturing programs for new product. We derive the optimal remanufacturing policy and extensively studied the drivers of cost-effective remanufacturing program for aftermarket services. Our policies exploit the ability to leverage OE production to support both the OE service operations as well as demand from the IAM. To the best of our knowledge, this research is the first attempt of its kind in the remanufacturing literature, as prior research treated these interrelated decisions separately. Valuable managerial insights are obtained by minimizing the discounted cash outflows caused by appropriate investment and core return <b>inventory</b> <b>building</b> decisions. We show that, under certain conditions, it may be optimal to delay the launch of the remanufacturing program to build up an adequate initial core return inventory. This may help in perfectly substituting virgin parts with remanufactured parts after end of the OE production run. At operational level, efficient production planning and control of reman parts for the supplier heavily impinges on the ability to accurately forecast core returns from customers (e. g., dealers, distributors). There are several challenges to this, including, the volume and diversity of customers served by the supplier, differences among individual customer warehouses in returning cores, large reman product catalogs, changing customer behaviors (often improving core return delays), and data sparsity. In this research we report the evidence for the effectiveness of hazard rate regression models to estimate core return delays in the context of remanufacturing. We investigate a number of hazard rate modelling techniques (e. g., parametric, semi-parametric etc.) using real-world datasets from a leading Tier- 1 automotive supplier. Results indicate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in terms of stability and face validity of the estimates and in predictive accuracy...|$|E
