5|$|Alfred's Tower is a {{monument}} to the genius of English landscape, many of whose loveliest haunts it commands, and to a man who certainly <b>deserves</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> remembered as among the great benefactors of the English scene. - Christopher Hussey, Country Life, 11 June 1938.|$|E
5|$|However, {{some have}} {{suggested}} that the Moon nonetheless <b>deserves</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> called a planet. In 1975, Isaac Asimov noted that the timing of the Moon's orbit is in tandem with the Earth's own orbit around the Sun—looking down on the ecliptic, the Moon never actually loops back on itself, and in essence it orbits the Sun in its own right.|$|E

5|$|Of note, the atrophic {{effects of}} {{glucocorticoids}} {{are not always}} a disadvantage. The treatment of hyperproliferative diseases like psoriasis makes use of this property. SEGRAMs would likely be less effective in such conditions. Recent advances {{have shown that the}} former striving towards a total separation of GR transrepression and transactivation by using SEGRAMs <b>deserves</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> nuanced as the anti-inflammatory genes stimulated by GR transactivation, such as GILZ and DUSP1, do seem to play an important role. Nevertheless, the more selective nature of these SEGRAMs would still reduce the number of GR-mediated side effects, and deserves further clinical testing.|$|E
5|$|A {{reference}} to the Consolatio made by the Christian theologian Jerome in a consolation letter to Heliodorus of Altino concerning the death of St. Nepotian suggests that the work was heavily based on the Greek philosopher Crantor's ancient work De Luctu ("On Grief"). Paul MacKendrick argues that the general outline for the Consolatio can be deduced based both on the structure used by Servius Sulpicius Rufus in a consolation letter sent to Cicero following Tullia's death, {{as well as the}} structure of Cicero's reply. From what little remains of the work, {{it would appear that the}} piece was addressed to Cicero himself. A novel part of the Consolatio seems to be Cicero's idea that Tullia <b>deserves</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> deified as a god. Cicero notes that, in order for his plan to work, her assent must both be recognized by the gods, as well as the Roman public. In order to win over the public, he concludes that he will build Tullia a shrine.|$|E
5|$|In Singapore, the Penal Code {{lays out}} {{sanctions}} for non-compliance with the Termination of Pregnancy Act, which limits abortion {{to women who}} have not been pregnant for more than 24 weeks. By not conferring the right to life upon fetuses younger than the stipulated period, the legislation has accorded greater weight to the safety and security of expectant mothers who are threatened by their unborn children. This is in contrast with the approach taken in the Philippines, where the Constitution provides that the state shall equally protect {{the life of the mother}} and the life of the unborn from conception. Similarly, the Charter of Fundamental Rights and Basic Freedoms of the Czech Republic states that human life <b>deserves</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> protected before birth. Chances of a universal consensus on this issue are slim due to the difficulty in defining the beginning of life.|$|E

25|$|Font and {{fullness}} of all evangelization and striking {{expression of the}} infinite love of our divine Redeemer for mankind, the Holy Eucharist clearly marked the life and pastoral activity of Peter Julian Eymard.

In fact, his mission in the Church consisted in promoting {{the centrality of the}} Eucharistic Mystery in the whole life of the Christian community.|$|E
25|$|This {{proposed}} {{amendment was}} intended to give Congress the right to enact statutes criminalizing the burning or other desecration of the United States flag in a public protest. Proponents of legislation to proscribe flag burning argue that burning the flag is a very offensive gesture that <b>deserves</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> outlawed. Opponents maintain that giving Congress such power would essentially limit the principle of freedom of speech, enshrined in the First Amendment to the United States Constitution and symbolized by the flag itself.|$|E

So it's slightly disappointing that the book arrives in the question-and-answer format made so familiar by last year's big hit Does Anything Eat Wasps? There are actually about 20 such books out this year, all asking these quirky questions (Do Sheep Shrink In The Rain? Do Fish Drink Water?), all piled up in Waterstones, making book-buyers feel a bit depressed.|$|E
25|$|Frost also expresses {{doubts about}} whether or not she <b>deserves</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> an X-Man, only to have veteran X-Man Wolverine assure her that she has earned her place on the team. Later, when Xavier {{attempts}} to warn Cyclops about his recent encounter with Sinister, Frost manages to enter the Professor's mind undetected. During the course of their encounter, Frost forces Xavier to relive each of his mistakes and morally ambiguous decisions made under altruistic pretenses. It is also revealed that while Frost is just as angry with Xavier as Cyclops is, she also wants to help him move on with his life. Frost points the Professor in a new direction by forcing him to relive the death of Moira MacTaggert and reminding him of her last words.|$|E
25|$|In {{shellfish}} and algae farms, biofouling species tend {{to block}} nets and cages and ultimately outcompete the farmed species for space and food. Bacterial biofilms start the colonization process by creating microenvironments that more favorable for biofouling species. In the marine environment, biofilms {{could reduce the}} hydrodynamic efficiency of ships and propellers, lead to pipeline blockage and sensor malfunction, and increase the weight of appliances deployed in seawater. Numerous {{studies have shown that}} biofilm can be a reservoir for potentially pathogenic bacteria in freshwater aquaculture. As mentioned previously, biofilms can be difficult to eliminate even when antibiotics or chemicals are used in high doses. The role that biofilm plays as reservoirs of bacterial fish pathogens regarding has not been explored in detail but it certainly <b>deserves</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> studied.|$|E
