25|$|A {{drift net}} {{consists}} {{of one or}} more panels of webbing fastened together. They are left free to drift with the current, usually near the surface or not far below it. Floats on the floatline and weights on the groundline keep them vertical. Drift nets drift with the current while they are connected with the operating vessel, the <b>driftnetter</b> or drifter.|$|E
50|$|In 1991, Sea Shepherd {{learned that}} driftnetters were {{destroying}} the seabird and fish populations {{off of the}} coasts of Trinidad and Tobago. They travelled there and patrolled the area {{near the mouth of}} the Amazon. They encountered a driftnetting ship and threw stink bombs on its deck. The ship rammed the Sea Shepherd II, and they rammed the <b>driftnetter</b> back, leading to a confrontation that severely damaged both ships. Back in Trinidad, Sea Shepherd revealed that corrupt officials were taking bribes to {{turn a blind eye to}} driftnetting in the area, and the corrupt officials were removed from office. Sea Shepherd later donated four assault rifles to help the Coast Guard chase driftnetters.|$|E
50|$|In 1992, Sea Shepherd {{returned}} to fight <b>driftnetters</b> in the North Pacific. They encountered {{a fleet of}} Japanese <b>driftnetters.</b> They chased one away, and fired air cannons and fire crackers at another to slow it down. However, no ramming took place because the fishermen on deck would not move. They did manage to retrieve a cargo hold of driftnet and create an international incident.|$|R
50|$|In 1997, Sea Shepherd {{announced}} {{a campaign to}} fight driftnetting in the Mediterranean. Italy's <b>driftnetters,</b> the primary suspects, immediately halted the practice.|$|R
50|$|In March 2016, Sea Shepherd {{announced}} {{the launch of}} Operation Driftnet, to combat illegal fishing in the Indian Ocean and subsequently employ direct-action techniques to shut-down their operations. They found and engaged a fleet of 6 <b>driftnetters,</b> and 3 of the ships were arrested for illegal fishing.|$|R
50|$|In 1990, Sea Shepherd {{travelled}} to the North Pacific {{with the}} intent of bringing driftnetting to public attention. While there, they found two Taiwanese <b>driftnetters,</b> which they filmed catching seabirds and dolphins in their nets. They rammed the power blocks, used to retrieve the nets. The ships were forced to head home, and no charges were brought against Sea Shepherd for the incident.|$|R
40|$|Despite {{the ban on}} high-seas {{driftnet}} {{fishing in}} the north Pacific Ocean in the early 1990 s, fishing effort by trawlers, longliners, purse seiners, trollers, and <b>driftnetters</b> continues throughout the Pacific Ocean. The annual number of vessels operating per fishery per country varies greatly, from less than 10 vessels per fishery {{for some of the}} small island nations, to over 600 for the more economically powerful countries. For most of these fishing fleets, little or no data exists regarding the incidental bycatch of marine mammal and sea turtle populations, particularly for those species in danger of extinction. Without such information, it is difficult to assess the impacts of these fisheries on species included in this Opinion. Nevertheless, bycatch information, including survival rates following entanglements, collected by observers and through fisher self reporting does exist for some fisheries in the eastern and western Pacific Ocean. Given such data, coupled with information on fishing distribution and effort and distribution and abundance records for the various species, one can at least gain a sense of the possible impacts of those fisheries for which no information exists. The following sections summarize past and current fishing effort in the eastern and central western Pacific Ocean. A. Fishing effort in the Central Western Pacific Ocean Although high-seas driftnet vessels no longer operate in the North Pacific, longliners, purse seiners, trollers, and pole-and-liners continue to fish, mainly for tuna species, in the Central Western Pacific Ocean, typically west of the 150 EW longitude and north and south of the equator. Most of thi...|$|R
