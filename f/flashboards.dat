40|$|Abstract. The <b>flashboard</b> was {{installed}} in the circulation compartment of the modified oxidation ditch in order to regulate the mixed reflux from aerobic zone to anoxic zone. The differences of the nutrient removal efficiencies and the phosphate-removal bacteria content were researched before and after <b>flashboard</b> installation. The {{results showed that the}} average removal efficiencies of COD, NH 4 +, TN, TP were 93. 3 %, 87. 1 %, 78. 1 % and 96. 0 % respectively, and the proportion of denitrifying phosphate-removal bacteria (DPB) to total phosphorus accumulating organisms were 46. 1 % after the <b>flashboard</b> installation. However, the average removal efficiencies of COD, NH 4 +, TN, TP were 91. 2 %, 82. 7 %, 67. 2 % and 86. 4 % respectively, and the proportion of denitrifying phosphate-removal bacteria to total phosphorus accumulating organisms were 17. 54 % before the <b>flashboard</b> installation. So, the modified oxidation ditch with <b>flashboard</b> could enrich denitrifying phosphate-removal bacteria and and improve the nutrient removal efficiencies...|$|R

40|$|Spectroscopic {{investigations}} of the properties of a plasma produced by a <b>flashboard</b> plasma source, commonly used in pulsed plasma experiments, are presented. The plasma is used to prefill a planar 0. 4 -ms-conduction time plasma opening switch (POS). A novel gas-doping technique and a secondary surface flashover plasma source are used to locally dope the plasma with gaseous and solid materials, respectively, allowing for spatially-resolved measurements. The electron density, temperature, and plasma composition are determined from spectral line intensities and line profiles. Detailed collisional-radiative modeling is {{used to analyze the}} observed line intensities. The propagation velocity and divergence angle of various ions are determined from time-of-flight measurements and Doppler broadening of spectral lines, respectively. This allows for distinguishing the secondary plasma ejected from the POS electrodes from the plasma of the <b>flashboard</b> source.

25|$|In June 2003, the Scouts {{agreed to}} install a fish ladder, modify the dam's spillway, educate Scouts at camp about {{threatened}} species, and enhance the stream bed habitat for fish. Instead of paying a fine, the San Francisco Chronicle reported in 2006 that the council paid more than $1 million, including legal fees, to construct a custom fish ladder for use when the dam is full and a juvenile vertical-slot fish passage ladder in the spillway. The fish ladder is a unique design that allows the fish to swim upstream or downstream when the <b>flashboards</b> are installed. The design had not {{been used in the}} United States beforehand. It was designed by Swanson Hydrology + Geomorphology and built by Don Chapin Company. The fish ladders significantly improved fish passage.|$|E

40|$|<b>Flashboard</b> Plasma Cathodes (FBPCs) are {{potential}} rugged electron sources for generating high-current beams needed for future High Power Microwave Weapons. In FBPCs, dielectric material is {{in contact with}} electrodes in a vacuum. Plasma is generated by a surface flashover discharge {{on the surface of}} the dielectric between the electrodes and an electron beam is extracted from the plasma by applying an electric field between the anode and cathode. While FBPCs have been successfully used in a number of applications, the widespread adoption of this technology has been limited by concerns over beam quality. The goals of this thesis are to design a test stand in order to measure FBPC properties that affect beam quality and to enable experiments that will provide a better understanding of the effects of different parameters such as <b>flashboard</b> design, pulser type and plasma properties on the quality of electron beams extracted from the plasma.

2500|$|In its {{original}} configuration, Holter Dam {{was expected to}} be [...] long and [...] high, but ended up being slightly larger. At the time, Holter was the tallest hydroelectric dam on the Missouri River. The penstocks are [...] below the water level when the reservoir is full. The dam had four vertical single-runner 15,000-horsepower water turbines, seven main electrical generators and three exciters, and was capable of generating 40,000 kilowatts of power. Aside from the powerhouse and water intakes, the dam has three sections: a central section where water is permitted to flow over the dam, and a left and right section anchored to the bedrock where water is not able to flow over the dam. The dam incorporated <b>flashboards</b> into the crest of the dam to permit overflow. The dam has 31 <b>flashboards,</b> each of them [...] high.|$|E
2500|$|Black Eagle Falls are {{not always}} flowing due {{to the needs of}} Black Eagle Dam. Typical median water flows of [...] per second occur in the Missouri River in May of each year. In October 2000, water levels behind the dam were drawn down and the falls shut off for about four weeks while PPL Montana made repairs to the forebay, gates, forebay, and {{penstock}} screens. PPL Montana's license for the dam requires it to send at least [...] per second of water over Black Eagle Dam between 9 A.M. and 8 P.M. on weekends and holidays between Memorial Day and Labor Day, although water may flow (and flow at higher rates) if the dam's power generation requirements and water levels permit it. In May 2001, PPL Montana said it would shut down Black Eagle Falls after July 4 because of water flows only about 40 percent of normal. Reservoir levels were lowered again in September 2004 to repair <b>flashboards.</b> The lack of water exposed the Missouri's original channel near Giant Springs. The reservoir was drawn down again and the falls turned off in June and July 2008. <b>Flashboards</b> on the dam were removed after a heavy rain to allow runoff to pass over the dam. Once the runoff passed, the <b>flashboards</b> were replaced. But little water remained in the reservoir and river, and the falls ran dry for several days until the reservoir filled again.|$|E
2500|$|On April 14, 1908, {{at about}} 2:30 PM, Hauser Dam—a steel dam about 90 miles {{upstream}} from Great Falls— failed. A surge of water [...] to [...] high swept downstream. A Great Northern Railway locomotive was {{dispatched to the}} city of Great Falls, warning stations along the way about the dam break. Workers at the Boston and Montana Smelter in Great Falls improvised a wing dam to deflect the floodwaters away from the smelter site and dynamited a portion of Black Eagle Dam to allow the floodwaters to go downstream. Their efforts were not needed, as the Missouri River only rose [...] by the time it reached that city. Two deaths occurred while the dynamiting attempt was made, however: One man drowned while trying to remove <b>flashboards</b> from the dam, and another drowned when his boat capsized.|$|E
5000|$|Consumers Distributing {{was plagued}} by the {{perception}} that items were frequently out of stock due to the catalogue shopping nature of the store. With the catalogue concept, the customer selected the item either at home while looking through the company's catalogue, or {{by a group of}} catalogues in the showroom of every store. It was not uncommon for a customer to wait in line only to be told by a clerk that the merchandise was not in stock. In 1984, a concept called the [...] "Flashboard" [...] was introduced. The <b>Flashboard</b> was a steel bulletin board with magnetic catalogue numbers for out of stock items. Customers were able to look at the <b>Flashboard</b> for their item and if it was listed, they knew that it was out of stock and {{they did not have to}} wait in line. This concept was used in some New York and New Jersey stores before computerization became mainstream.|$|R
50|$|This was {{extremely}} difficult with multiple guns firing since several observers {{could not be}} sure they were all looking at the same particular gun. The British solved this using a <b>flashboard</b> located at HQ fitted with a combination of buzzers and signal lights connected to the observers by telephone wires, which operated {{in such a way that}} after a sequence of observations, all observers could be sure they were looking at the same gun flashing and its position determined by triangulation.|$|R
5000|$|An electrothermal-chemical gun uses a plasma {{cartridge}} {{to ignite}} {{and control the}} ammunition's propellant, using electrical energy as a catalyst to begin the process. Originally researched by Dr. Jon Parmentola for the U.S. Army, it {{has grown into a}} very plausible successor to a standard solid propellant tank gun. Since the beginning of research the United States has funded the XM-291 gun project with USD 4,000,000, basic research with USD 300,000, and applied research with USD 600,000. Since then it has been proven to work, although efficiency to the level required has not yet been accomplished. ETC increases the performance of conventional solid propellants, reduces the effect of temperature on propellant expansion and allows for more advanced, higher density propellants to be used. It will also reduce pressure placed on the barrel in comparison to alternative technologies that offer the same muzzle energy given the fact that it helps spread the propellant's gas much more smoothly during ignition. [...] Currently, there are two principal methods of plasma initiation: the <b>flashboard</b> large area emitter (FLARE) and the triple coaxial plasma igniter (TCPI).|$|R
2500|$|Black Eagle Dam {{suffered}} {{four major}} floods after its 1926 reconstruction, but survived them all. The first major flood occurred on June 4, 1953, when early spring rains and sudden snowmelt caused the Missouri River to rise [...] above flood stage. No {{damage to the}} dam was reported. On June 10, 1964, heavy rains in the Rocky Mountains caused the Missouri River to rise [...] above flood stage— higher than the 1908 flood. Swift Dam on Birch Creek collapsed, killing 19 people. [...] Lower Two Medicine Lake Dam also collapsed, killing nine. Although 3,000 people were forced {{out of their homes}} in Great Falls due to heavy flooding, the 1964 event did no damage to Black Eagle Dam. (Mel Ruder was awarded a Pulitzer Prize for Breaking News Reporting for his coverage of the flood.) A third major flood occurred on June 21, 1975. More than [...] of rain fell in the Rocky Mountains in a 24-hour period. More than 5,000 people were evacuated from their homes in Great Falls after the Sun River rose to [...] ( [...] above flood stage). More than $17 million in damage occurred, and [...] were submerged. Floodwaters almost overwhelmed Black Eagle Dam, but no damage to the structure occurred. A fourth major flood hit on June 17, 1997. Heavy, swift snowmelt caused the Missouri River to rise [...] above flood stage. But no damage to the dam was reported. Black Eagle Dam is also equipped with an emergency [...] "trip face" [...] that releases all the <b>flashboards</b> on the dam so that up to [...] per second of water can pass over the dam.|$|E
2500|$|Construction {{began on}} Black Eagle Dam in 1890. GFWPTC {{engineers}} designed a rock-and-timber crib weir overflow dam, in which dressed and shaped heavy timbers formed a closed structure filled with rock or rubble. The dam {{was not a}} large one. The goal was to merely create a pond behind the dam, which would create enough water pressure (or [...] "head") to turn turbines and generate electricity. The dam was built {{at a cost of}} about $515,000 (roughly $12,335,000 in inflation-adjusted 2010 dollars) on the upstream brink of the falls (to create the deepest reservoir possible). Construction bids were opened on February 5, 1890, with the request for bids specifying that all work must be finished by December 1, 1890. All the bids were rejected, and mechanical engineer Maurice Parker was employed to design and construct the dam. Coffer dams were constructed in April 1890 to divert the river from the work areas. Work on the dam itself began on April 15. A shanty town named [...] "River Bank" [...] was constructed just upstream of the construction site on the north bank for the river to house the Croat, Scandinavian, Slovak, and Welsh workers who helped construct the dam. (Most of these workers helped found the town of Black Eagle, and earthen foundations for the shanty town can still be seen.) The red sandstone riverbed was leveled as much as possible, and large timbers bolted and cemented (perpendicular to the river's flow) to the rock. Each timber was [...] from the next one downstream, and six cribs were built to form a dam [...] deep at its base. The dam's downstream face had a pitch of 1.05:1. From the crest of the dam, a face (at a pitch of 1:08:1) extended for about [...] before it became vertical. A [...] masonry wall was built on the south end of the dam to form the foundation of and to protect the powerhouse, and the construction worked inward from either end of the dam. Every [...] across the face of the dam, a [...] floodwater spillway made of concrete was created (for a total of eight spillways). <b>Flashboards</b> [...] in height were installed along the entire top of the dam to add water storage capacity. The dam was [...] high and [...] long.|$|E

40|$|Instream {{obstacles}} such as low-head {{dams and}} waterfalls {{are important in}} fisheriesmanagement because they can restrict the movement of fishes. This can have detrimental orbeneficial effects on a fish population, depending on whether a particular structure operates as abarrier to migration or {{as a barrier to}} invasion. We developed flashboard-type and flume-typeadjustable waterfalls in the laboratory to study the effects of waterfall height and plunge pooldepth on fish jumping performance. Our ultimate goal was to provide a quantitative method ofevaluating pool-and-weir fish passage structures and waterfall barriers that could be applied tofield situations. The adjustable waterfalls were successfully tested using adult Rio Grandecutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii virginalis). The <b>flashboard</b> waterfall worked well inexperiments where the combined waterfall height and plunge pool depth were less than the depthof the raceway. The flume waterfall worked well for the same conditions, but as designed, itsminimum waterfall height was 30 cm. The flume-type waterfall also worked well for tests wherethe waterfall height exceeded the maximum depth of the raceway. Of the two waterfallsdeveloped, we recommend using the flume-type for future studies because of its greaterflexibility, even though it has a higher construction cost and is slightly more difficult to operate...|$|R
40|$|Shellfish bed {{closures}} {{along the}} North Carolina coast have {{increased over the}} years seemingly concurrent with increases in population (Mallin 2000). More and faster flowing storm water has come to mean more bacteria, and fecal indicator bacterial (FIB) standards for shellfish harvesting are often exceeded when no source of contamination is readily apparent (Kator and Rhodes, 1994). Could management reduce bacterial loads if {{the source of the}} bacteria where known? Several potentially useful methods for differentiating human versus animal pollution sources have emerged including Ribotyping and Multiple Antibiotic Resistance (MAR) (US EPA, 2005). Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) studies on bacterial sources have been conducted for streams in NC mountain and Piedmont areas (U. S. EPA, 1991 and 2005) and are likely to be mandated for coastal waters. TMDL analysis estimates allowable pollutant loads and allocates them to known sources so management actions may be taken to restore water to its intended uses (U. S. EPA, 1991 and 2005). This project sought first to quantify and compare fecal contamination levels for three different types of land use on the coast, and second, to apply MAR and ribotyping techniques and assess their effectiveness for indentifying bacterial sources. Third, results from these studies would be applied to one watershed to develop a case study coastal TMDL. All three watershed study areas are within Carteret County, North Carolina. Jumping Run Creek and Pettiford Creek are within the White Oak River Basin management unit whereas the South River falls within the Neuse River Basin. Jumping Run Creek watershed encompasses approximately 320 ha. Its watershed was a dense, coastal pocosin on sandy, relic dune ridges, but current land uses are primarily medium density residential. Pettiford Creek is in the Croatan National Forest, is 1133 ha. and is basically undeveloped. The third study area is on Open Grounds Farm in the South River watershed. Half of the 630 ha. watershed is under cultivation with most under active water control (<b>flashboard</b> risers). The remaining portion is forested silviculture. (PDF contains 4 pages...|$|R

50|$|Sometimes {{engineers}} {{will use}} these two terms interchangeably by calling a stoplog a flashboard. This {{is done in}} part because unlike many other types of bulkhead gates that are one continuous unit, both stoplogs and <b>flashboards</b> are modular and can be easily designed to hold back different amounts of water. However, most engineering texts and design firms differentiate between the two structures. Stoplogs are specialized bulkheads that are dropped into premade slots or guides in a channel or control structure, while <b>flashboards</b> are bulkheads that are placed on the crest or top of a channel wall or control structure. <b>Flashboards</b> are sometimes designed to break away under high flow conditions and thus to provide only a temporary diversion.
