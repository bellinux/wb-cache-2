5|$|Sexual Politics {{originated}} as Millett's PhD dissertation and {{was published}} in 1970, {{the same year that}} she was awarded her doctorate from Columbia University. The bestselling book, a critique of patriarchy in Western society and literature, addressed the sexism and <b>heterosexism</b> of the modern novelists D. H. Lawrence, Henry Miller, and Norman Mailer and contrasted their perspectives with the dissenting viewpoint of the homosexual author Jean Genet. Millett questioned the origins of patriarchy, argued that sex-based oppression was both political and cultural, and posited that undoing the traditional family was the key to true sexual revolution. In its first year on the market, the book sold 80,000 copies and went through seven printings and is considered to be the movement's manifesto.|$|E
25|$|The rhetoric {{generally}} has an ideological basis in <b>heterosexism,</b> {{and can be}} motivated by homophobia, biphobia, and transphobia.|$|E
25|$|<b>Heterosexism</b> {{refers to}} a system of {{negative}} attitudes, bias, and discrimination in favour of opposite-sex sexual orientation and relationships. p.13 It can include the presumption that everyone is heterosexual or that opposite-sex attractions and relationships are the only norm and therefore superior.|$|E
25|$|Being closeted or in {{the closet}} means being aware of one's lesbian, gay or {{bisexual}} orientation or true gender identity yet averse to revealing it because of various personal or social motivations. It can also include denial or refusal to identify as LGBT. Overall, most reasons not to come out stem from homophobia, transphobia and <b>heterosexism,</b> which marginalize LGBT people as a group.|$|E
25|$|Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and {{transgender}} (LGBT) {{characters have}} been depicted in some video games since the 1980s. LGBT content has {{been subject to}} changing rules and regulations by game companies. These rules are generally examples of <b>heterosexism</b> in that heterosexuality is normalized while homosexuality is subject to additional censorship or ridicule. Sexual orientation and gender identity were significant in some console and PC games, with the trend being toward greater visibility of LGBT identities, particularly in Japanese popular culture and games marketed to LGBT consumers.|$|E
25|$|While {{the general}} {{bisexual}} {{population as a}} whole faces biphobia, this oppression is also aggravated by other factors such as race. In his examination of the bisexual male perspective, entitled, Managing <b>Heterosexism</b> and Biphobia: A Revealing Black Bisexual Male Perspective, Grady L. Garner delves into the oppression that he faces as both a black and bisexual male. He explains that the internalization of negative sociocultural messages, reactions, and attitudes can be incredibly distressing as bisexual black males attempted to translate or transform these negative experiences into positive bisexual identity sustaining ones. The experience of bisexual black males is different from that of bisexual white males. As the demands and tribulations of black bisexual males appear to be comparatively more distressing than those that black and white, homo- and heterosexual individual's encounter, this acknowledgement is important and vital to the understanding of biphobia from an intersectional perspective.|$|E
2500|$|Same-sex {{relationships}} {{may experience}} similar social stressors. Additionally, violence in same-sex relationships {{has been linked}} to internalized homophobia, which contributed to low self-esteem and anger in both perpetrator and victim. Internalized homophobia also appears to be a barrier in victims seeking help. Similarly, <b>heterosexism</b> can {{play a key role in}} domestic violence in the LGBT community. As a social ideology that implies [...] "heterosexuality is normative, morally superior, and better than ," [...] <b>heterosexism</b> can hinder services and lead to an unhealthy self-image in sexual minorities. <b>Heterosexism</b> in legal and medical institutions can be seen in instances of discrimination, biases, and insensitivity toward sexual orientation. For example, as of 2006, seven states explicitly denied LGBT individuals the [...] ability to apply for protective orders, proliferating ideas of LGBT subjugation, which is tied to feelings of anger and powerlessness.|$|E
2500|$|Blasingame {{argued that}} in reality dichotomies are {{inaccurate}} to the representation of individuals because nothing is truly black or white, straight or gay. Her main argument is that biphobia is the central message of two roots; internalized <b>heterosexism</b> and racism. Internalized <b>heterosexism</b> is described in the monosexual paradigm in which the binary states that you are either straight or gay and nothing in between. Gays and lesbians accept this internalized <b>heterosexism</b> by morphing into the monosexial paradigm and favoring single attraction and opposing attraction for both sexes. Blasingame described this favoritism {{as an act of}} horizontal hostility, where oppressed groups fight amongst themselves. Racism is described in the monosexual paradigm as a dichotomy where individuals are either black or white, again nothing in between. The issue of racism comes into fruition in regards to the bisexuals coming out process, where risks of coming out vary on a basis of anticipated community reaction and also in regards to the norms among bisexual leadership, where class status and race factor predominately over sexual orientation.|$|E
2500|$|In many cultures, {{homosexual}} {{people are}} frequently subject to prejudice and discrimination. A 2011 Dutch {{study concluded that}} 49% of Holland's youth and 58% of youth foreign to the country reject homosexuality. [...] Similar to other minority groups {{they can also be}} subject to stereotyping. These attitudes tend to be due to forms of homophobia and <b>heterosexism</b> (negative attitudes, bias, and discrimination in favor of opposite-sex sexuality and relationships). <b>Heterosexism</b> can include the presumption that everyone is heterosexual or that opposite-sex attractions and relationships are the norm and therefore superior. [...] is a fear of, aversion to, or discrimination against homosexual people. It manifests in different forms, and a number of different types have been postulated, among which are internalized homophobia, social homophobia, emotional homophobia, rationalized homophobia, and others. Similar is lesbophobia (specifically targeting lesbians) and biphobia (against bisexual people). When such attitudes manifest as crimes they are often called hate crimes and gay bashing.|$|E
2500|$|With {{the spread}} of {{consciousness}} raising (CR) in the late 1960s, coming out became a key strategy of the gay liberation movement to raise political consciousness to counter <b>heterosexism</b> and homophobia. At {{the same time and}} continuing into the 1980s, gay and lesbian social support discussion groups, some of which were called [...] "coming-out groups", focused on sharing coming-out [...] "stories" [...] (experiences) with the goal of reducing isolation and increasing LGBT visibility and pride.|$|E
2500|$|Lorde defines racism, sexism, ageism, <b>heterosexism,</b> elitism and classism {{altogether}} and explains that an [...] "ism" [...] {{is an idea}} that what is being privileged is superior and {{has the right to}} govern anything else. Belief in the superiority of one aspect of the mythical norm. Lorde explains that a mythical norm is what all bodies should be. The mythical norm of U.S Culture is white, thin, male, young, heterosexual, Christian, financially secure.|$|E
2500|$|Heteronormativity is {{the belief}} that people fall into {{distinct}} and complementary genders (male and female) with natural roles in life. It assumes that heterosexuality is the only sexual orientation or only norm, and that sexual and marital relations are most (or only) fitting between people of opposite sexes. A [...] "heteronormative" [...] view therefore involves alignment of biological sex, sexuality, gender identity and gender roles. Heteronormativity is often linked to <b>heterosexism</b> and homophobia.|$|E
2500|$|Sexual {{prejudice}} – Researcher at the University of California, Davis Gregory M. Herek preferred sexual prejudice {{as being}} descriptive, free of presumptions about motivations, and lacking value judgments {{as to the}} irrationality or immorality of those so labeled. He compared homophobia, <b>heterosexism,</b> and sexual prejudice, and, in preferring the third term, noted that homophobia was [...] "probably more widely used and more often criticized." [...] He also observed that [...] "Its critics note that homophobia implicitly suggests that antigay attitudes are best understood as an irrational fear and that they represent a form of individual psychopathology rather than a socially reinforced prejudice." ...|$|E
2500|$|Intersectionality is the {{examination}} of various ways {{in which people are}} oppressed, based on the relational web of dominating factors of race, sex, class, nation and sexual orientation. Intersectionality [...] "describes the simultaneous, multiple, overlapping, and contradictory systems of power that shape our lives and political options". While this theory can be applied to all people, and more particularly all women, it is specifically mentioned and studied within the realms of black feminism. Patricia Hill Collins argues that black women in particular, have a unique perspective on the oppression of the world as unlike white women, they face both racial and gender oppression simultaneously, among other factors. This debate raises the issue of understanding the oppressive lives of women that are not only shaped by gender alone but by other elements such as racism, classism, ageism, <b>heterosexism,</b> ableism etc.|$|E
2500|$|A major ongoing {{critique}} about womanist {{scholarship is}} the failure of many scholars to critically address homosexuality within the black community. [...] Walker's protagonist in Coming Apart uses writings from two African-American lesbians, Audre Lorde and Louisah Teish, to support her argument that her husband should stop consuming pornography. She posts quotes from Audre Lorde above her kitchen sink. In Search of Our Mother's Garden states that a womanist is [...] "a woman who loves another woman, sexually and/or non-sexually", yet despite Coming Apart and In Search of Our Mother's Garden, {{there is very little}} literature linking womanism to the lesbian and bisexual issue. [...] Womanist theologian Renee Hill cites Christian influences as the cause of the lack of sympathy towards <b>heterosexism</b> and homophobia. Black feminist critic Barbara Smith blames it on the Black community's reluctance {{to come to terms with}} homosexuality. [...] On the other hand, there is an increase in the criticism of <b>heterosexism</b> within womanist scholarship. Christian womanist theologian Pamela R. Lightsey, in her book Our Lives Matter: A Womanist Queer Theology (2015), writes, [...] "To many people, we are still perverts. [...] To many, the Black pervert is the most dangerous threat to the American ideal. [...] Because the Black conservative bourgeoisie has joined the attack on our personhood, Black LGBTQ persons cannot allow the discourse to be controlled such that our existence within the Black community is denied or made invisible." [...] An additional critique lies within the ambivalence of womanism. In Africana womanism and African womanism, the term is associated with black nationalist discourse and the separatist movement. Patricia Collins argues that this exaggerates racial differences by promoting homogeneous identity. This is a sharp contrast to the universalist model of womanism that is championed by Walker. The continued controversy and dissidence within the various ideologies of womanism serves only to draw attention away from the goal of ending race and gender-based oppression.|$|E
2500|$|Boys' love manga has {{received}} considerable critical attention, especially after translations of BL became commercially available outside Japan in the 21st century. Different critics and commentators have had very {{different views of}} BL. In 1983, Frederik L. Schodt, an American manga writer and translator, has observed that portrayals of gay male relationships had used and further developed bisexual themes already in existence in shoujo manga to appeal to their female audience. Japanese critics have viewed boys' love as a genre that permits their audience to avoid adult female sexuality by distancing sex from their own bodies, {{as well as to}} create fluidity in perceptions of gender and sexuality and rejects [...] "socially mandated" [...] gender roles as a [...] "first step toward feminism." [...] Kazuko Suzuki, for example, believes that the audience's aversion to or contempt for masculine [...] <b>heterosexism</b> is something which has consciously emerged {{as a result of the}} genre's popularity.|$|E
2500|$|... he {{homophobia}} and <b>heterosexism</b> {{that already}} existed ... became more systematized and institutionalized. Gender and sexuality explicitly entered political discourse even as vaguely worded laws increasingly targeted gender-transgressive {{men who were}} believed to be homosexual ... whereas lesbianism remained unnamed and invisible. Between 1959 and 1980 male homosexuals suffered a range of consequences from limited career options to detention in street sweeps to incarceration in labor camps. ... Long hair, tight pants, colorful shirts, so-called effeminate mannerisms, [...] "inappropriate clothing," [...] and [...] "extravagant hairstyles" [...] were seen as visible markers of male homosexuality. Such visible markers not only facilitated enforcement of homosexual repression; more broadly, visibility and gender transgressions themselves constituted a central part of the problem identified by the revolution. Even during the severest period of enforcement, Marvin Leiner reminds us, private homosexual expression was never the main target. Rather, [...] "... the major concern, as it had always been, was with the public display of homosexuality." ...|$|E
2500|$|National Socialist {{black metal}} (NSBM) is black metal that {{promotes}} National Socialist (Nazi) beliefs through their lyrics and imagery. These beliefs often include: white supremacy, racial separatism, antisemitism, <b>heterosexism,</b> and Nazi interpretations of paganism or Satanism (Nazi mysticism). According to Mattias Gardell, NSBM musicians see [...] "national socialism as a logical {{extension of the}} political and spiritual dissidence inherent in black metal. Bands whose members hold Nazi beliefs but do not express these through their lyrics are generally not considered NSBM by black metal musicians, but are labelled as such in media reports. Some black metal bands have made references to Nazi Germany purely for shock value, much like some punk rock and heavy metal bands. According to Christian Dornbusch and Hans-Peter Killguss, völkisch pagan metal and neo-Nazism are the current trends in the black metal scene, and are affecting the broader metal scene. Mattias Gardell, however, sees NSBM artists as a minority within black metal.|$|E
2500|$|In contrast, Canadian writer Orville Lloyd Douglas's March 22, 2017 article [...] in Film International criticized Moonlight as derivative, dishonest, heterosexist, racist, and stereotypical. [...] Douglas's piece condemns Moonlight {{and similar}} black films because [...] "the {{suffering}} is about homosexuality, race, drug addiction, crime, and poverty. Black family dysfunction {{is the key}} for black films that want white critical acclaim and success." [...] Douglas believes the film placates {{what he calls the}} racist prejudices of upper-class white film critics and rich white Academy voters. He argues that white people in the entertainment industry ultimately have the power to decide whether a black film deserves acclaim and awards, not black people. [...] Douglas criticized Barry Jenkins's direction of the movie, arguing straight male directors should not direct gay male movies due to <b>heterosexism</b> and homophobia. Douglas points out Jenkins' heterosexuality was used as a marketing tool to appeal to white middle and upper class heterosexuals audiences not LGBT people. He also claims that Moonlight was not popular with black audiences.|$|E
2500|$|Internalized {{homophobia}} {{refers to}} negative stereotypes, beliefs, stigma, and prejudice about homosexuality and LGBT people {{that a person}} with same-sex attraction turns inward on themselves, {{whether or not they}} identify as LGBT. The degree to which someone is affected by these ideas depends on how much and which ideas they have consciously and subconsciously internalized. These negative beliefs can be mitigated with education, life experience and therapy, especially with gay-friendly psychotherapy/analysis. Internalized homophobia also applies to conscious or unconscious behaviors which a person feels the need to promote or conform to cultural expectations of heteronormativity or <b>heterosexism.</b> This can include extreme repression and denial coupled with forced outward displays of heteronormative behavior for the purpose of appearing or attempting to feel [...] "normal" [...] or [...] "accepted." [...] Other expressions of internalized homophobia can also be subtle. Some less overt behaviors may include making assumptions about the gender of a person's romantic partner, or about gender roles. Some researchers also apply this label to LGBT people who support [...] "compromise" [...] policies, such as those that find civil unions acceptable in place of same-sex marriage.|$|E
50|$|One {{limitation}} {{present in}} research on <b>heterosexism</b> is that there often isn’t a distinction between homophobia and <b>heterosexism.</b> Individuals {{are more likely to}} be aware of homophobic tendencies rather than heterosexist views, thus, researchers often measure homophobia instead of <b>heterosexism.</b>|$|E
50|$|Psychologists have {{aimed to}} measure <b>heterosexism</b> using various methods. One {{particular}} method {{involves the use of}} a Likert scale. However, since <b>heterosexism</b> is perceived as something that is unseen {{it is difficult to determine}} if someone is heterosexist based on a self-report method. Researchers, thus, have constructed implicit measurements of <b>heterosexism.</b> An example of this would be an Implicit Association Test. A popular implicit association test measuring <b>heterosexism</b> that is open to the public is a virtual laboratory called Project Implicit.|$|E

50|$|The {{main effect}} of <b>heterosexism</b> is the {{marginalization}} of gay men, lesbians, and bisexuals within society. <b>Heterosexism</b> has led to stigmatization and persecution of not only these people but also those of other sexual diversity such as transgender, and transsexual people. Along with homophobia, lesbophobia, and internalized homophobia, <b>heterosexism</b> {{continues to be a}} significant social reality that compels people to conceal their homosexual or bisexual orientation, or metaphorically, to remain in the closet in an effort to pass for heterosexual.|$|E
5000|$|Homophobia, {{a form of}} <b>heterosexism,</b> refers both to [...] "unreasoning fear of or {{antipathy}} towards homosexuals and homosexuality" [...] and to [...] "behavior {{based on}} such a feeling". <b>Heterosexism,</b> however, more broadly denotes the [...] "system of ideological thought that makes heterosexuality the sole norm to follow for sexual practices". As a bias favoring heterosexuals and heterosexuality, <b>heterosexism</b> {{has been described as}} being [...] "encoded into and characteristic of the major social, cultural, and economic institutions of our society" [...] and stems from the essentialist cultural notion that maleness-masculinity and femaleness-femininity are complementary.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Heterosexism</b> is {{a system}} of attitudes, bias, and {{discrimination}} in favor of opposite-sex sexuality and relationships. [...] It can include the presumption that other people are heterosexual or that opposite-sex attractions and relationships are the only norm and therefore superior. Although <b>heterosexism</b> is defined in the online editions of the American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language and the Merriam-Webster Collegiate Dictionary as anti-gay discrimination or prejudice [...] "by heterosexual people" [...] and [...] "by heterosexuals", respectively, people of any sexual orientation can hold such attitudes and bias, and can form a part of internalised hatred of one's sexual orientation. <b>Heterosexism</b> as discrimination ranks gay men, lesbians, bisexuals and other sexual minorities as second-class citizens with regard to various legal and civil rights, economic opportunities, and social equality {{in many of the}} world's jurisdictions and societies. <b>Heterosexism</b> is often related to homophobia.|$|E

50|$|Research on <b>heterosexism</b> {{has focused}} on {{variables}} that may affect views of <b>heterosexism.</b> For instance, {{in a study by}} psychologist, Gregory M. Herek, it was found that there was a gender difference between heterosexual attitudes toward lesbians and gay men. Specifically, the study reveals that heterosexual individuals all seem to have some heterosexist tendency, however, heterosexual males have a greater tendency than heterosexual females to exhibit negative attitudes towards non-heterosexual individuals (this includes gay men, lesbians, and bisexuals). Another notable finding of Herek's study was that heterosexual males showed a greater tendency to demonstrate hostility towards gay men rather than lesbians. Other factors that Herek acknowledges to contribute to <b>heterosexism</b> include individual differences, religiosity, conforming to social norms, right-wing authoritarianism, customs and beliefs regarding cultural tradition, and personal experience with non-heterosexual individuals. Research has also recognized the effects of level of education on views of <b>heterosexism.</b> Wright et al. revealed that higher levels of education, or having more years of education, is related to less homophobic tendencies.|$|E
