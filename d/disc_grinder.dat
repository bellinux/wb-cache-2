The measurements have been conducted on three stainless steel specimens in this study. The three specimens were processed by annealing, a cavitating jet in air and a <b>disc</b> <b>grinder,</b> with each method introducing different residual stresses at the surface. The specimens were oscillated in the ω- direction, representing a right-hand rotation of the specimen about the incident X-ray beam. The range of the oscillation, Δ ω, was varied and optimum Δ ω was determined. Moreover, combinations of the tilt angle between the specimen surface normal and the diffraction vector, ψ, with the rotation angle about its surface normal, f, have been studied with a view to find the most optimum condition. The results show that the use of ω oscillations is an effective method for improving analysis accu racy, especially for large grain metals. The standard error rapidly decreased with increasing range of the ω oscillation, especially for the annealed specimen which generated strong diffraction spots due to its large grain size. </p...|$|E
40|$|Aluminium (1 xxx) /coconut shell micro {{particle}} (Al/CMP) composites {{have been}} developed using a compo cast technique. Coconut shells (CSs) were processed {{with the aid of}} mortar/pestle and <b>disc</b> <b>grinder</b> and then classified with a set of sieves vibrated with a sine shaker. The CMP additions increased from 2 % to 10 % at 2 % interval. Microstructural/chemical composition analyses were carried out with the aid of scanning electron microscopes (ASPEX 3020) with attached energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. Phases were identified using an X-ray diffractometer (XRD). The tensile properties and mode of fracture were studied using Instron extensometer and Avery Denison Impact Testing Machine respectively. Results revealed 99. 3 % purity of aluminium matrix. The presence of new phases in the aluminium matrix is attributable to chemical interaction between Al and CMPs. The fine grained structure of Al/CMPs composites was confirmed by SEM and optical micrographs. The enhancement in the tensile properties is attributable to the presence of hard phases in the Al matrix and good interfacing bonding between Al matrix and CMP reinforcements. The cone and cup surface appearance with fibrous, dull, dimple and goose grain microstructure of the fracture surfaces of the composites is an indication of ductile fracture. Hence low cost metal matrix aluminium based composites {{have been developed}}...|$|E

40|$|Vibration {{measurements}} at {{the workplace}} are often complicated and expensive. The {{assessment of the}} risk in conformity with EC Directive 2002 / 44 /EC Vibration (which lays down the minimum requirements of laws in Europe for occupational safety and health) can therefore be carried out {{on the basis of}} an estimate based on information from manufacturers as well as by measurement conforming to ISO 5349. The characteristic values (emission values) determined by manufacturers in laboratory conditions may deviate from the exposure values measured at source at the workplace. Equally, deviations may arise {{as a result of the}} delay in the changeover of test methods from the single axis of measurement to the total vibration value for the three axes of measurement conforming to ISO 20643. To prevent faulty estimates, the manufacturer s information has to be corrected by a tool-related factor in accordance with CEN/TR 15350. By taking the example of masonry and stone working machines, the empirically determined tool-related correction factor is checked and confirmed. Methods Vibration measurements were carried out in accordance with ISO 5349 in practical application conditions on 10 selected typical eccentric and orbital sanders, concrete and <b>disc</b> <b>grinders</b> as well as on wall chasers and stone saws. Results The total vibration value obtained for the investigated tools rangedfrom ahv = 3. 6 m/s to ahv = 11. 6 m/s. When the values from the practical measurements are compared with the manufacturer s vibration values, the underestimation of the risk occurring in some cases can be largely compensated for by the tool-related factors conforming to CEN/TR 15350 (see Figure 1) ...|$|R

The high speed <b>disc</b> of angle <b>grinders</b> does not respect anatomical boundaries or structures and thus the injuries produced can be disfiguring, permanently disabling or even fatal. However, aesthetically pleasing results can be achieved with thorough debridement, resection of wound edges and careful layered functional closure after reduction and fixation of facial bone injuries. A series of penetrating facial wounds associated with angle grinder use are presented and the management and prevention of these injuries discussed...|$|R

40|$|The {{possibility}} of using mechanical milling for {{the synthesis of}} uncarbonised coconut shell nanoparticles (UCSNPs) has been investigated. UCSNPs were synthesized from discarded coconut shells (CSs) using top down approach. The sundried CSs were crushed, ground and then sieved using hammer crusher, a two <b>disc</b> <b>grinder</b> and set of sieves with shine shaker respectively. The CS powders retained in the pan below 37 µm sized sieve were milled for 70 hours to obtain UCSNPS. Samples for analysis were taken at 16 and 70 hours. UCSNPs were analyzed using transmission electron microscope (TEM), scanning electron microscope (SEM) with attached EDS and Gwyddion software. Samples of UCSNPs obtained at 16 and 70 hours show that the deep brown colour of the initial CS powder became fading as the milling hour increased. The size determination from TEM image revealed spherical particles with an average size of 18. 23 nm for UCSNPs obtained at 70 hour milling. The EDS spectrographs revealed {{an increase in the}} carbon counts with increased milling hours. This is attributable to dryness of the CS powders by the heat generated during the milling process due to absorption of kinetic energy by the CS powders from the milling balls. SEM micrographs revealed UCSNPs in agglomerated networks. The SEM micrograph/Gyweddion particles size determination showed average particles of 170. 5 ± 3 and 104. 9 ± 4. 1 nm for UCSNPs obtained at 16 and 70 hours respectively. Therefore, production of UCSNPs through mechanical milling using mixture of ceramic balls of different sizes has been established especially when the particles of the sourced/initial CS powders falls below 37 µm...|$|E

40|$|The major {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the existing noise conditions within industrial education woodworking and metalworking laboratories to determine whether these noise conditions were a problem as seen by the instructors and if in fact these noise conditions exceeded the standards set by the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA). The study was conducted in three phases: (1) the assessment of the opinions of professional industrial educators towards noise as a pollutant; (2) an electronic instrument measurement of the actual noise exposure conditions that existed in a sampling of laboratories; and (3) the comparison between the opinions of the professional educators and the actual laboratory noise conditions. The study incorporated the responses from every identifiable high school woods and metals instructor throughout Utah. Comparisons between groups were made concerning the opinions of the professional educators. towards noise as a pollutant, their knowledge about OSHA, and their identification of the noisiest pieces of equipment. The second phase of the study entailed the electronic instrument measurement of the actual environmental noise levels within 30 randomly selected laboratories. The use of a sound level dosimeter and a hand held sound level meter were employed. The data obtained from the study disclosed that the two groups were not in agreement on their knowledge about OSHA. The electronic instrument measurements revealed that 8 of the 18 woodworking instructors and 5 of the 12 metals instructors visited were subjected to noise exposures that were in violation to OSHA. The loudest pieces of equipment were the surface planer, radial arm saw, table saw, foundry furnace, pedestal grinder and portable <b>disc</b> <b>grinder.</b> The third phase of the study used a statistical analysis to compare the opinions of the instructors to the actual measured noise conditions. The chi-square test for significance at the. 05 level of confidence was used to reject the null hypothesis. The major conclusions reached as a result of the analysis of data include: (1) a potential safety and health hazard exists from noise pollution within the industrial education facilities; (2) many members of the profession are not fully informed about OSHA; (3) most labs are in compliance to OSHA noise standards, however, many do exceed the maximum a llowable limits; (4) under stringent OSHA compliance, certain curriculum alterations would have to be initiated; (5) there is no apparent connection between those laboratoryies which were in volation to OSIIA noise standards and the composition of size and construction materials; (6) the opinions of the teachers from the field do not necessarily reflect the actual measured conditions of the environmental noise exposures; and (7) the din of noise produced around machinery must not be considered a problem relevant only to industry...|$|E
50|$|Angle {{grinders}} {{are widely}} used in metalworking and construction, {{as well as in}} emergency rescues. They are commonly found in workshops, service garages and auto body repair shops. There is a large variety of angle grinders to choose from when trying to find the right one for the job. The most important factors in choosing the right <b>grinder</b> are the <b>disc</b> size and how powerful the motor is. Other factors include power source (pneumatic or electric), rpm, and arbor size. Generally disc size and power increase together. Disc size is usually measured in inches or millimetres. Common disc sizes for angle grinders in the U.S.A. include 4, 4.5, 5, 6, 7, 9 and 12 inches. <b>Discs</b> for pneumatic <b>grinders</b> also come much smaller. Pneumatic grinders are generally used for lighter duty jobs where more precision is required. This is likely because pneumatic grinders can be small and light yet remain powerful, because they do not contain heavy copper motor windings, while it is harder for an electric grinder to maintain adequate power with smaller size. Electric grinders are more commonly used for larger, heavy duty jobs. However, there are also small electric grinders and large pneumatic grinders.|$|R
40|$|Objective To {{quantify}} the temperature {{changes in the}} dental pulp associated with equine dental procedures using power grinding equipment. Design A matrix experimental design with replication on the same sample was followed to allow the following independent variables to be assessed: horse age (young or old), tooth type (premolar or molar), powered grinding instrument (rotating <b>disc</b> or die <b>grinder),</b> grinding time (15 or 20 seconds) and {{the presence or absence}} of water coolant. Procedure Sound premolar and molar teeth from a 6 -year-old horse and a 15 -year-old horse, which had been removed postmortem, were sectioned parallel to the occlusal plane to allow placement of a miniature thermocouple at the level of the dental pulp. The maximum temperature increase, the time taken to reach this maximum and the cooling time were measured (n= 10 in each study). The teeth were placed in a vice and the instrument used on the tooth as per clinical situation. Results Significant differences were recorded for horse age (P < 0. 001), instrument type (P < 0. 001), grinding time (P < 0. 001) and presence or absence of coolant (P < 0. 001). There was no significant difference for tooth type. Conclusion Thermal insult to the dental pulp from the use of power instruments poses a significant risk to the tooth. This risk can be reduced or eliminated by appropriate selection of treatment time and by the use of water irrigation as a coolant. The increased dentine thickness in older horses appears to mitigate against thermal injury from frictional heat...|$|R
