2500|$|Under {{the most}} widely {{accepted}} scenario, hunters would slowly encircle a bison herd several miles from the jump and subtly drive them toward {{the base of the}} hill leading up to the cliff. It's not known how many hunters this required. Archeologists theorize that anywhere from 12 to 100 people may have participated. Low fences (or [...] "drive lines") of rock and braided vines were built to help funnel the bison toward the summit. These fences extended back at least half a mile from the summit. (About 260 stone piles, remnants of these <b>drive</b> <b>lines,</b> still exist near the hilltop. In 2011, remains of the braided vines were also found at the site.) As the bison began moving toward the summit, hunters (perhaps wearing wolf hides) would leap up from their hiding places behind the rock fences and begin making loud noises. This would begin to stampede the herd, so that they could not stop at the cliff face and would plummet over it to their deaths. There are oral history traditions among some tribes about [...] "buffalo runners" [...] – swift, brave young men who would drape themselves in a buffalo robe and race ahead of the herd to help lead them toward the cliff summit. The young man would leap over the cliff and land on a ledge just out of sight below, while the herd would plummet over and past him. Others (primarily women and children) would kill any animals who did not die from the fall, and butcher all the carcasses.|$|E

In order {{to investigate the}} causes and control methods of the <b>drive</b> <b>line,</b> the box-shaped part with curved bottom was designed based on the shape characteristics of automobile panel. Then this part was taken as an experimental model to analyze the causes and forming process of the <b>drive</b> <b>line</b> on its surface. Finally, influencing laws on the <b>drive</b> <b>line</b> from the draw bead, the important forming process parameter, were obtained by the experiments. The {{results showed that the}} draw bead has great impact on the <b>drive</b> <b>line.</b> Different setting ways of the draw beads can make good control for the formation, displacement and its direction of the <b>drive</b> <b>line.</b> Besides, it is an important way for setting the draw beads properly to prevent the stamping parts from the formation of the <b>drive</b> <b>line...</b>|$|R

In hydrostatic transmission, the motor drives a variabledisplacement pump hydraulically connected to a hydro-motor driving the axle via a gearbox. The speed is controlled by changing the displacement volume of the axial pump.

5000|$|Early mud boggers were {{pickup trucks}} or sport utility {{vehicles}} modified with lifted suspensions and larger tires, and classes exist for such vehicles today. Engine upgrades were also common. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, large tractor tires became popular, and the <b>drive</b> <b>lines</b> required to run such tires led {{to some of the}} first purpose-built mud bogging machines. By the late 1980s, many sanctioning bodies began giving precedence to vehicles with modified, and lower, dragster-type [...] "rail designs", as they had increased in popularity. At the same time, superchargers first became widely used, leading to the modern top-level racer.|$|E

5000|$|The Selec-Trac {{transfer}} case has five positions: 2-HI, 4-HI Part-Time, 4-HI Full-Time, Neutral, and 4-LO. The {{transfer case}} {{is different from}} the Command-Trac transfer only in the extra 4WD HI Full-Time position. The 4WD HI Full-Time position adds the same traction benefits that the part-time 4WD setting offers, but features an open differential between the front and rear axles to allow the two axles to spin at independent speeds and eliminate drive line binding and wheel-hop. The down side of 4WD Hi Full-Time is that, due to the open differential between front and rear <b>drive</b> <b>lines,</b> at times the drive train will only deliver power to the front or the rear e.g. when the front of the vehicle has reached a high traction surface such as dry pavement and the rear is in sand, the rear tires will spin with 100% of engine power, the front receiving no traction. Under equal traction conditions (front-rear) this position gives the rear wheels 52% of the engine's power and the front wheels 48% of the engine's power. The division of power and open center differential allows the Selec-Trac transfer case to be operated at all times in an [...] "All Wheel Drive" [...] mode with no adverse effects.|$|E

5000|$|In {{a simple}} LED package, {{typically}} {{all of the}} cathodes (negative terminals) {{or all of the}} anodes (positive terminals) of the segment LEDs are connected and brought out to a common pin; this is referred to as a [...] "common cathode" [...] or [...] "common anode" [...] device. Hence a 7 segment plus decimal point package will only require nine pins, though commercial products typically contain more pins, and/or spaces where pins would go, in order to match standard IC sockets. Integrated displays also exist, with single or multiple digits. Some of these integrated displays incorporate their own internal decoder, though most do not: each individual LED is brought out to a connecting pin as described.Multiple-digit LED displays as used in pocket calculators and similar devices used multiplexed displays {{to reduce the number of}} I/O pins required to control the display. For example, all the anodes of the A segments of each digit position would be connected together and to a driver circuit pin, while the cathodes of all segments for each digit would be connected. To operate any particular segment of any digit, the controlling integrated circuit would turn on the cathode driver for the selected digit, and the anode drivers for the desired segments; then after a short blanking interval the next digit would be selected and new segments lit, in a sequential fashion. In this manner an eight digit display with seven segments and a decimal point would require only 8 cathode drivers and 8 anode drivers, instead of sixty-four drivers and IC pins. Often in pocket calculators the digit <b>drive</b> <b>lines</b> would be used to scan the keyboard as well, providing further savings; however, pressing multiple keys at once would produce odd results on the multiplexed display.|$|E

40|$|The 'hydrid' is {{a fairly}} new serial {{hydraulic}} hybrid drive line concept. The term ‘hydrid’ is used for hydraulic <b>drive</b> <b>lines</b> in which four constant displacement Floating Cup (FC) wheel drive units are pressure controlled by means of two Innas Hydraulic Transformers (IHT). It {{has been shown in}} earlier publications that a four wheel drive hydrid drive line with wheel hub motors realises reductions of fuel consumption and CO 2 emission of more than 50 %. In modern passenger cars, there is a large gap between - on one hand - the engine power and wheel torque necessary to fulfil the maximum performance requirements and - on the other hand - the quite modest power and torque demand in normal, every-day use. This gap is the main reason for the rather bad energy efficiency of modern passenger cars. Contrary to other hybrid concepts, the hydrid can bridge this gap and achieve large reductions without compromising performance. This paper shows how the use of floating cup technology, the pressure amplification capability of the Innas hydraulic transformer (IHT) and a four wheel drive line topology, come together to realise this. After that a serial hydrid front wheel drive line is presented, which can realise similar reductions but uses only one IHT and two FC drive units, which attach to the front axle differential. Finally, some ideas for other serial hydrid <b>drive</b> <b>lines</b> are given...|$|E
