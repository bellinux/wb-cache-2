40|$|A gust-tunnel {{investigation}} {{to determine the}} effects o enter-of-gravity position on the gust loads of a delta-wing model with the leading edge swept back 60 ° was made over a range of center-of-gravity positions from 4 percent ahead of to 11 percent behind {{the leading edge of the}} mean geometric chord. This investigation indicated that a I-percent rearward movement of the center-of-gravity position increased the <b>acceleration</b> <b>increment</b> in the sharp-edge gust by 0. 5 percent. In a gust with a gradi-ent distance of 6. 5 chords, the <b>acceleration</b> <b>increment</b> was increased by approximately 2 percent f o r the same movement of the center of gravity. - Comparison of these results with those for a conventional airplane model indicates that the change in load for both configurations would be nearly the same in a sharp-edge gust, but in a gust with a gradient distance of 6. 5 chords, the change in load for a given change in center-of-gravity position would be approximately twice as great for the delta-wfng model as for the conventional airplane model...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Acceleration control using {{fuzzy logic}} is {{investigated}} {{in this paper}} for a plug-in series hybrid electric vehicle {{in order to improve}} the vehicle response to driver’s demand. The transient process of acceleration is mainly considered in this research. Fuzzy logic is used for motor transient torque control according to driver’s input and vehicle velocity, outputting a regulatory factor to increase motor torque transiently when driver’s acceleration pedal is pushed down deeply and to reduce the torque <b>increment</b> when <b>acceleration</b> process is close to over. Performance of fuzzy control is tested by MATLAB simulation. Simulation results indicate that the presented fuzzy algorithm is feasible and effective for improving vehicle acceleration ability without damaging stable velocity control characteristic; in simulation, vehicle acceleration time of 0 - 100 km/h has been reduced by 2. 4 seconds...|$|R

It is found that the <b>increments</b> of normal <b>acceleration</b> at the centre of gravity ard of stress in the wing and ttil are affected by resonance, the vibrations of the wing and tail being forced by the turbulence. Estimates are given of the amplifying effects due to the resonance. It is found that amplifications are proportionately greater in the stresses than in the simultaneously recorded normal accelerations at the centre of gravity. LIST OF COl'J!CENT...|$|R
40|$|A {{method has}} been {{developed}} for interpreting v-g records taken {{during the course of}} commercial transport operation. This method involves the utilization of fairly simple statistical procedures to obtain "flight envelopes," which predict that, on the average, in a stated number of flight hours, one value of airspeed will exceed the envelope, and one positive and one negative <b>acceleration</b> <b>increment</b> will exceed the envelope with equal probability of being experienced at any airspeed. Comparison with the actual data obtained from various airplanes and from various airlines indicates that these envelopes predict the occurrences of large values of acceleration and airspeed {{with a high degree of}} accuracy...|$|R
40|$|Experiments injecting liquid {{nitrogen}} {{into the water}} jet, which focused on their differences between both of boiling temperatures, were carried out to improve the thrust from nozzle water flow. Effects of jet acceleration were evaluated {{by means of the}} measurements of thrust loads added on the convergent-divergent nozzle connecting with or without the parallel pipe submerged into the water tank. The characteristics of liquid-vapor two-phase nozzle flow appeared to be somewhat compressible fluid because of the explosive vaporization of {{liquid nitrogen}}, so that considerable <b>increment</b> of water <b>acceleration</b> at the part of divergent region of nozzle resulted in apparently higher thrust by exhaust jet from the nozzle...|$|R
40|$|The new {{acceleration}} {{control scheme}} aims {{to give an}} inverter-fed induction motor excellent dynamic performance by using an on-line inference controller. In every time interval of the control process, the <b>acceleration</b> <b>increments</b> produced by two different voltage vectors are compared, yielding one optimum stator voltage vector that is selected and retained. The on-line inference control is built using a production system and some heuristic knowledge {{about the relationship between}} the motor voltage and acceleration. Because integral calculation and motor parameters are not involved, the new controller has no accumulation error of integral, as in the conventional vector control schemes, and it can be used for different induction motors without modification.

40|$|Tests {{were made}} to {{determine}} {{the effectiveness of a}} long-period dynamically overbalanced flap in reducing airplane accelerations due to atmospheric gusts. For two gust shapes, one gust velocity, one forward velocity, and one wing loading, a series of flights was made with the flap locked and was then repeated with the flap free to operate. The records were evaluated by routine methods. The results indicate that the flap reduced the maximum <b>acceleration</b> <b>increment</b> 39 percent for a severe gust but with a representative gust shape (a sharp-edge gust), the reduction was only 3 percent. The results also indicate that the flap tended to reduce the longitudinal stability of the airplane. Computations made of the effectiveness and the action of the flap were in good agreement with the experimental results...|$|R

40|$|Tests {{were made}} in the NACA gust tunnel to {{determine}} the effectiveness of a torsionally flexible wing with the torsion axis ahead of the locus of the section aerodynamic centers in reducing airplane accelerations due to atmospheric gusts. For three gust shapes, a series of flights was made with the airplane model equipped with either a torsionally flexible or a rigid wing. The results indicated that the torsionally flexible wing reduced the maximum <b>acceleration</b> <b>increment</b> 5 percent for the sharp-edge gust and about 17 percent for gust shapes with gradient distances of 6. 8 and 15 chord lengths. The analysis indicated that the effectiveness of this method of gust alleviation was independent of the gust velocity and that, for the same total load increment, the torsionally flexible wing would have 10 percent less bending-moment increment at the root section of the wing than a rigid wing in all but the sharpest gusts. The results also indicated that the torsionally flexible wing slightly increased the longitudinal stability of the airplane model in a gust...|$|R
40|$|The {{results of}} {{a survey of the}} flight {{conditions}} experienced by three military helicopters engaged in simulated and actual military missions, and a commercial helicopter operated in the mountainous terrain surrounding Denver, CO, are presented. The data, obtained with NASA helicopter VGHN recorders, represent 813 flights or 359 flying hours, and are compared where applicable to previous survey results. The current survey results show that none of the helicopters exceeded the maximum design airspeed. One military helicopter, used for instrument flight training, never exceeded 70 percent of its maximum design airspeed. The rates of climb and descent utilized by the IFR training helicopter and of the mountain-based helicopter were generally narrowly distributed within all the airspeed ranges. The number of landings per hour for all four of the helicopters ranged from 1. 6 to 3. 3. The turbine-engine helicopter experienced more frequent normal-acceleration increments above a threshold of +/- 0. 4 g (where g is acceleration due to gravity) than the mountain-based helicopter, but the mountain-based helicopter experienced <b>acceleration</b> <b>increments</b> of greater magnitude. Limited rotor rotational speed time histories showed that all the helicopters were operated at normal rotor speeds during all flight conditions...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Exact {{structure}} function equations are {{an efficient}} means of obtaining asymptotic laws such as inertial range laws, {{as well as}} all measurable effects of inhomogeneity and anisotropy that cause deviations from such laws. “Exact ” means that the equations are obtained from the Navier-Stokes equation or other hydrodynamic equations without any approximation. A pragmatic definition of local homogeneity lies within the exact equations because terms that explicitly depend on the rate of change of measurement location appear within the exact equations; an analogous statement is true for local stationarity. An exact definition of averaging operations is required for the exact equations. Careful derivations of several inertial range laws have appeared in the literature recently in the form of theorems. These theorems give the relationships of the energy dissipation rate to the structure function of <b>acceleration</b> <b>increment</b> multiplied by velocity increment and to both the trace of and the components of the third-order velocity structure functions. These laws are efficiently derived from the exact velocity structure function equations. In some respects, the results obtained herein differ from the previous theorems. The accelerationvelocity structure function is useful for obtaining the energy dissipation rate in particle tracking experiments provided that the effects of inhomogeneity are estimated by means of displacing the measurement location. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a Sensor Unit for short range missile applications which provides inertial rotation and acceleration data for missile stabilization and short term navigation. The Sensor Unit {{consists of an}} angular rate, angular <b>increment</b> and linear <b>acceleration</b> measurement system. Fast data transmission is ensured {{by means of a}} bidirectional transputer serial data link. The rotation rate sensing of the Sensor Unit is performed {{on the basis of a}} special passive three axis fibre optic gyroscope configuration which is different from the standard FOG concept as it works passively without nonreciprocal optical phase modulation. Fused fibre 3 x 3 directional couplers provide a constant optical phase shift thus enabling the detection of angular rates at the quadrature point. Random error terms due to pseudostatistically varying coupling centers within the fibre coil are eliminated by a contrast insensitive signal recovery scheme. A temperature compensation procedure cancels deterministic temperature dependent error terms. The acceleration sensing is performed by three individual vibrating beam accelerometers, mounted othogonally to each other. An extensive test programme has been started in order to ensure the technical performance and the reliability of the Sensor Unit under severe environmental constraints with temperatures between - 55 C and + 85 C and vibration levels up to 20 g rms.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to propose a 2 D {{computational}} algorithm for modeling of the trigger and the propagation of shallow landslides caused by rainfall. We used a Molecular Dynamics (MD) inspired model, similar to discrete element method (DEM), that is suitable to model granular material and to observe the trajectory of single particle, so to identify its dynamical properties. We consider that the triggering of shallow landslides is caused by the decrease of the static friction along the sliding surface due to water infiltration by rainfall. Thence the triggering is caused by two following conditions: (a) a threshold speed of the particles and (b) a condition on the static friction, between particles and slope surface, based on the Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion. The latter static condition is used in the geotechnical model to estimate the possibility of landslide triggering. Finally the interaction force between particles is defined trough a potential that, in the absence of experimental data, we have modeled as the Lennard-Jones 2 - 1 potential. In the model the viscosity is also introduced and for a large range of values of the model's parameters, we observe a characteristic velocity pattern, with <b>acceleration</b> <b>increments,</b> typical of real landslides. The results of simulations are quite promising: the energy and the time triggering distributions of local avalanches shows a power law distribution, analogous to the observed Gutenberg-Richter and Omori power law distributions for earthquakes. Finally it is possible to apply the method of the inverse surface displacement velocity [Fukuzono 1985] for predicting the failure time...|$|R
