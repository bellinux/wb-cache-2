This area extends up to the Upper Nile State. The vegetation of this area is very dense and dominated with different acacia species. The study is based on two types of data; namely social data collected through questionnaire, interviews with some farmers in addition to secondary data collected from different sources. The second type of data is collected through inventory work; basically through sampling techniques. This method relies upon random distribution of the trees in a specific area to be sampled and different tree species to be recorded. A number of randomly determined points were selected in the area to be sampled for trees. A total number of 100 trees were randomly selected. For each tree diameter at breast height (DBH), total height and gum yield were measured and recorded. The gum yield from each of the selected trees was recorded for three successive seasons. The results of the study showed that all the farmers depended on agricultural production but <b>gum</b> <b>arabic</b> is considered to be an additional source of income between the harvest time and plant time of the agricultural crops. The study also showed that there are some differences between the gum yield in the hashab plantations and natural stands; it was found that the plantations are covered with high-yielding strains of Acacia 5 senegal. The results also showed that the tree size (diameter) has no effect on the quantity of <b>gum</b> <b>arabic</b> in the study area on multi-stemmed trees but in the single trees it has some effect. There is no significant difference between gum yield per tree between trees growing on sandy soils and those growing on clay soils. The study area is densely covered with hashab trees but the gum production per tree is low, probably due to the acute competition between the trees. The gum production increases with the increase of the family members; individuals produce lower quantities of <b>gum</b> <b>arabic.</b> Compared to Northern Kordofan (the original belt of <b>gum</b> <b>arabic)</b> hashab <b>trees</b> in Southern Kordofan have higher yield. It is recommended to fix an encouraging minimum price for <b>gum</b> <b>Arabic.</b> It is also recommended to establish producers’ cooperatives and offer loans to the producers so as to encourage them.

5000|$|During 35 {{years of}} {{autonomous}} experimenting, from about 1923 until about 1958, Egon von Vietinghoff rediscovered {{the knowledge of}} multi-layer mixing of oil and resin not taught in technical handbooks and academies.

Different steps of light reflection bring about depth and color differentiations not possible in the same way by wet-on-wet painting. The [...] thus obtained does not need any conspicuous construction of perspective. This knowledge is the basis of the color depth and the luminous power typical of Vietinghoff's paintings. His differentiated way of seeing required painting techniques which needed first-class natural substances produced with great care - including some indispensable colors of a chemical origin. He therefore produced himself the colors he needed. Even the necessary solvents and binders were prepared by him. Usually at least half of his time went into this manual preparation before he could start to paint. Another essential contribution to the natural effect, the convincing freshness, and the depth of color of his paintings is made by the main use of natural substances which were as pure as possible for the production of colors and binders. For this he used organic raw materials such as egg, casein, linseed and poppy seed oil, leather glue, wax, <b>gum</b> <b>arabic,</b> cherry <b>tree</b> resin, larch turpentine, fossil resin and different earths.|$|R

Until fairly recently, Kordofan has been more widely known for the {{production}} of <b>gum</b> <b>arabic</b> from the <b>tree</b> of A. senegal. The apparently well-balanced traditional system began to decline due to variety of factors, some projects exerted considerable efforts to rehabilitate the gumbelt in the state, but the price of <b>gum</b> <b>arabic</b> is declining compared with other cash crops that led farmers to ignore tapping their hashab trees, or cut them for charcoal. The broad objective of this research is to investigate the possibility of rehabilitating the gumbelt zone through the establishment of <b>Gum</b> <b>Arabic</b> Farmer’s Associations and guarantee raising of standard of living of the local communities. Two types of data were collected to provide the necessary information, namely; primary and secondary data. The primary data were collected through questionnaires, interviews and observations. The main findings of the research are; through the establishment of farmer’s associations, the project of rehabilitation of gumbelt was able to sustain the activity of gum belt. The associations act as a rural bank. Using the project’s revolving fund allocation as a grant, it was envisaged that the “Sanduk” will evolve as a permanent and sustainable credit institutions. After the establishment of the associations there is a tremendous increase of areas and stocking density of hashab trees. There are two types of markets of gum before the establishment of the associations namely; village markets and urban markets.

Haplotypes were not restricted {{to any of the}} four varieties, but showed significant geographic structure (GST(cpSSR) = 0. 392; RST= 0. 673; RST>RST (permuted)), with the major division separating East and Southern Africa populations from those in West and Central Africa. Phylogenetic analysis of ITS data indicated a more recent origin for the clade including West and Central African haplotypes, suggesting range expansion in this region, possibly during the Holocene humid period. In conjunction with paleobotanical evidence, our data suggest dispersal to West Africa, and across to the Arabian Peninsula and Indian subcontinent, from source populations located in the East African region during climate oscillations of the Plio-Pleistocene...|$|E

The highlight {{of this study}} was to review the utilization of <b>gum</b> <b>Arabic</b> for industries and human health. <b>Gum</b> <b>Arabic</b> has a unique combination of excellent emulsifying properties and low solution viscosity. These properties make <b>gum</b> <b>Arabic</b> very useful in several industries but especially in the food industry where it is used as a flavor and stabilizer of citrus oil emulsion concentrates in soft drinks...|$|R
50|$|Although {{from the}} 1950s {{to the early}} 1990s, Sudan {{accounted}} for roughly 80% of <b>gum</b> <b>arabic</b> production, today, that figure is under 50%. However, {{hundreds of thousands of}} Sudanese are dependent on <b>gum</b> <b>arabic</b> for their livelihoods and it is still the world's largest single producer. The production of <b>gum</b> <b>arabic</b> is heavily controlled by the Sudanese government.|$|R
