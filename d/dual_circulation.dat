40|$|AbstractThe {{embryonic}} cardiac outflow myocardium originates from {{a secondary}} heart-forming field {{to connect the}} developing ventricles with the aortic sac. The outflow tract (OFT) subsequently undergoes complex remodeling in the transition of the embryo to a <b>dual</b> <b>circulation.</b> In avians, elimination of OFT cardiomyocytes by apoptosis (stages 25 – 32) precedes coronary vasculogenesis and {{is necessary for the}} shortening of the OFT and the posterior rotation of the aorta. We hypothesized that regional myocardial hypoxia triggers OFT remodeling. We used immunohistochemical detection of the nitroimidazole EF 5, administered by intravascular infusion in ovo, as an indicator of relative tissue oxygen concentrations. EF 5 binding was increased in the OFT myocardium relative to other myocardium during these stages (25 – 32) of OFT remodeling. The intensity of EF 5 binding paralleled the prevalence of apoptosis in the OFT myocardium, which are first detected at stage 25, maximal at stage 30, and diminished by stage 32. Evidence of coincident hypoxia-dependent responses included the expression of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor 2 by the OFT myocardium, the predominant expression of VEGF 122 (diffusible) isoform in the OFT, and the recruitment of QH 1 -positive pro-endothelial cells to the OFT and vasculogenesis. Exposure of embryos to hyperoxia (95 % O 2 / 5 % CO 2) during this developmental window reduced the prevalence of cardiomyocyte apoptosis and attenuated the shortening and rotation of the OFT, resulting in double-outlet right ventricle morphology, similar to that observed when apoptosis is directly inhibited. These results suggest that regional myocardial hypoxia triggers cardiomyocyte apoptosis and remodeling of the OFT in the transition to a <b>dual</b> <b>circulation,</b> and that VEGF autocrine/paracrine signaling may regulate these processes...|$|E

40|$|The goal of {{the work}} is to use {{multiple}} codes and multiple configurations to provide an assessment of the capability of RANS solvers to predict <b>circulation</b> control <b>dual</b> radius airfoil performance and also to identify key issues associated with the computational predictions of these configurations that can result in discrepancies in the predicted solutions. Solutions were obtained for the Georgia Tech Research Institute (GTRI) <b>dual</b> radius <b>circulation</b> control airfoil and the General Aviation <b>Circulation</b> Control (GACC) <b>dual</b> radius airfoil. For the GTRI-DR airfoil, two-dimensional structured and unstructured grid computations predicted the experimental trend in sectional lift variation with blowing coefficient very well. Good code to code comparisons between the chordwise surface pressure coefficients and the solution streamtraces also indicated that the detailed flow characteristics were matched between the computations. For the GACC-DR airfoil, two-dimensional structured and unstructured grid computations predicted the sectional lift and chordwise pressure distributions accurately at the no blowing condition. However at a moderate blowing coefficient, although the code to code variation was small, the differences between the computations and experiment were significant. Computations were made to investigate the sensitivity of the sectional lift and pressure distributions to some of the experimental and computational parameters, but none of these could entirely account for the differences in the experimental and computational results. Thus, CFD may indeed be adequate as a prediction tool for dual radius CC flows, but limited and difficult to obtain two-dimensional experimental data prevents a confident assessment at this time...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe role of {{apoptosis}} in cardiac morphogenesis has {{not been}} directly tested. Cardiomyocyte apoptosis is prevalent during the remodeling of the embryonic chicken cardiac outflow tract (OFT) in {{the transition from a}} single to a <b>dual</b> <b>circulation.</b> We tested the hypothesis that OFT cardiomyocyte apoptosis drives the shortening and rotation of the embryonic cardiac OFT and is required to achieve the mature ventriculo-arterial configuration. Chick embryos were treated with the peptide Caspase inhibitors zVAD-fmk or DEVD-cho at HH stages 15 – 20 (looped heart). Morphology of control and experimental embryos was assessed at HH stage 35, at which time the control hearts have developed a <b>dual</b> <b>circulation.</b> Infection of the hearts with a recombinant adenovirus expressing green fluorescent protein was used to follow the fate of the OFT cardiomyocytes. Affected embryos displayed abnormal persistence of a long infundibulum (OFT myocardial remnant) beneath the great vessels, indicating failure of OFT shortening. In some instances, the infundibulum connected both great vessels to the right ventricle in a side-by-side arrangement with transposition of the aorta, indicating a failure of rotation of the OFT, and modeling human congenital double outlet right ventricle. Defects were also observed at other sites in the heart where apoptosis is prevalent, such as {{in the formation of the}} cardiac valves and trabeculae. To more specifically target the apoptosis of the OFT cardiomyocytes, recombinant adenovirus was used to express the X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein in these cells. This resulted in an effect on outflow tract shortening and rotation similar to that of the peptide inhibitors, while the effects on the other cardiac structures were not observed. These results demonstrate that elimination of OFT cardiomyocytes by apoptosis is necessary for the proper formation of the ventriculo-arterial connections, and suggest apoptosis as a potential target of teratogens and genetic defects that are associated with congenital human conal heart defects...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{remodeling}} of the embryonic avian cardiac {{outflow tract}} (OFT) involves {{the removal of}} cardiomyocytes by programmed cell death (PCD). In contrast, the prevalence of PCD is low in the atrial or ventricular myocytes {{during this period of}} development. To determine if this selective PCD is due to the unique ability of the OFT cardiomyocytes to execute PCD, we transduced the embryonic chicken heart in ovo with recombinant adenovirus expressing a death (FasL) ligand. This resulted in programmed cell death in atrial, ventricular, and OFT cardiomyocytes as evidenced by chromosomal fragmentation, accumulation of lysosomes, and Caspase enzymatic activity. Consistent with the widespread induction of PCD, transcripts for the Fas receptor were detected in all chambers of the heart throughout development. The precocious and widespread activation of PCD in the OFT myocardium resulted in a marked dimunition of the subpulmonic myocardial infundibulum, and transposition of the aorta side-by-side with the pulmonary artery and connecting to the right ventricle. Defects in other cardiac structures are also described. We conclude that the regulated removal of OFT cardiomyocytes by PCD is required for the great vessels to make their proper connections with the ventricles in the transition to a <b>dual</b> <b>circulation.</b> The malalignment of the great vessels described in this animal model are similar to those described in congenital human conotruncal heart defects, suggesting that PCD-dependent remodeling of the OFT myocardium could be a target of genetic mutations or teratogens that cause human conotruncal heart defects...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—The cardiac {{outflow tract}} (OFT) {{of birds and}} mammals {{undergoes}} complex remodeling in {{the transition to a}} <b>dual</b> <b>circulation.</b> We have previously suggested a role of myocardial hypoxia and hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) - 1 in the apoptosis-dependent remodeling of the OFT. In the present study, we transduced recombinant adenovirus-mediated HIF- 1 in embryonic chick OFT myocardium to test its role in OFT remodeling. HIF- 1 reduced the prevalence of apoptosis in OFT cardiomyocytes at stages 25 and 30, as determined by lysosome accumulation and caspase- 3 activity. Associated conotruncal defects included malrotation of the aorta and excessive infundibular myocardium. HIF- 1 targets induced in these gain-of-function experiments included vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), inducible nitric oxide synthase, and stromal cell–derived factor- 1. To test the role of VEGF in this context, an adenovirus expressing secreted Flk 1 (VEGF receptor 2) that binds and blocks VEGF signaling was targeted to the OFT myocardium. This caused increased cell death in the OFT myocardium at stages 25 and 30. Associated conotruncal heart defects included malrotation of the aorta, defects in the subpulmonic infundibulum associated with a small right ventricle, and increased OFT mesenchyme with failure of semilunar valve formation. We conclude that hypoxia signaling through HIF- 1 and VEGF provides an autocrine survival signal in the developing cardiac OFT and that perturbation in this pathway causes OFT defects that model congenital human conotruncal heart defects.

40|$|The outcome after {{surgical}} {{repair of}} anomalous {{origin of the}} left coronary artery from the pulmonary trunk (ALCAPA) remains incompletely defined, and transplantation has been advocated for patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction. We reviewed our institutional experience with ALCAPA since 1977 in 38 patients whose repair established a <b>dual</b> coronary <b>circulation</b> (7 early cases with LCA ligation were excluded) to assess whether cardiac function predicts outcome, the use of left ventricular assist device (LVAD), and postoperative complications of the current operative techniques. Surgical techniques included direct coronary reimplantation to the aorta in 11 pts, intrapulmonary baffling (Takeuchi) when the LCA could not reach the aorta directly in 25 pts, and modified Takeuchi in which an extrapulmonary baffle was fashioned from anterior and posterior walls of the pulmonary artery in 2 pts. The operative survival was 91 %, 88 %, and 100 %, respectively (89 % overall). All pts who died were 50 mmHg in 2 pts requiring reoperation), and progressive aortic regurgitation requiring aortic valve replacement in 1 pt. There were no complications in the two modified Takeuchi pts (6 and 12 mos followup) or in reimplantation pts. Conclusions(1) The degree of LV dysfunction at presentation does not predict survival in pts < 1 yr old, (2) current operative survival for ALCAPA does not justify consideration of transplantation, (3) LVAD may improve survival for some patients and should be available for postoperative management, and (4) supravalvar pulmonary stenosis occurs in a majority of Takeuchi pts, some of whom require reoperation; a modified technique may improve this postoperative complication rate...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Isolated lung {{perfusion}} (ILuP) is {{an experimental}} technique currently tested {{to increase the}} 5 -year survival of 40 % after surgical resection of pulmonary metastases from certain solid tumors. The standard technique of anterograde perfusion was compared with retrograde isolated lung perfusion in which the drug is introduced through the pulmonary veins while the effluent is collected from the pulmonary artery. Since the lung has a <b>dual</b> arterial <b>circulation</b> through the pulmonary artery and bronchial circulation, perfusion through the pulmonary veins {{can result in a}} more homogeneous distribution throughout the lung with subsequent higher melphalan concentration. METHODS: We randomized 20 rats into two groups. Group one underwent anterograde isolated left lung perfusion while group two underwent retrograde isolated left lung perfusion. A dose of 2 mg/kg melphalan (MN) was administered to the lung at a flow of 0. 5 mL/min during 30 min, followed by a 5 -min washout with buffered hetastarch (BHE). The final melphalan lung concentration (FMLC) was determined in the hilum, at the apex, the mid-periphery and the base of the lung. Statistical analysis was done with an unpaired student's t-test. RESULTS: Retrograde left ILuP resulted in a higher FMLC in the hilum (P< 0. 0001) and in the base of the lung (P= 0. 03), while anterograde ILuP induced a higher concentration at the apex of the lung (P= 0. 04). No difference was seen in the mid-peripheral area of the lung (P= 0. 92).

40|$|ObjectivesThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} practice of transradial approach (TRA). BackgroundTRA has been adopted as an alternative access site for coronary procedures. MethodsA questionnaire was distributed worldwide with Internet-based software. ResultsThe survey was conducted from August 2009 to January 2010 among 1, 107 interventional cardiologists in 75 countries. Although pre-TRA <b>dual</b> hand <b>circulation</b> testing is not uniform in the world, > 85 % in the U. S. perform Allen or oximetry testing. Right radial artery is used in almost 90 %. Judkins catheters are the most popular for left coronary artery angiographies (66. 5 %) and right coronary artery angiographies (58. 8 %). For percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), 6 -F is now standard. For PCI of left coronary artery, operators use standard extra back-up guiding catheters in > 65 % and, for right coronary artery 70. 4 % use right Judkins catheters. Although heparin remains the routine antithrombotic agent in the world, bivalirudin is frequently used in the U. S. for PCI. The incidence of radial artery occlusion before hospital discharge is not assessed in > 50 %. Overall, approximately 50 % responded that their TRA practice will increase in the future (68. 4 % in the U. S.). ConclusionsTRA is already widely used across the world. Diagnostic and guiding-catheters used for TRA remain similar to those used for traditional femoral approach, suggesting that specialized radial catheters are not frequently used. However, there is substantial variation in practice as it relates to specific aspects of TRA, suggesting that more data are needed to determine the optimal strategy to facilitate TRA and optimize radial artery patency after catheterization...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe {{proposed}} {{a model in}} which myocardial hypoxia triggers the apoptosis-dependent remodeling of the avian outflow tract (OFT) in the transition of the embryo to a <b>dual</b> <b>circulation.</b> In this study, we examined hypoxia-dependent signaling in cardiomyocyte apoptosis and outflow tract remodeling. The hypoxia-inducible transcription factor HIF- 1 α was specifically present in the nuclei of OFT cardiomyocytes from stages 25 – 32, the period of hypoxia-dependent OFT remodeling. HIF- 1 α expression was sensitive to changes in ambient oxygen concentrations, while its dimerization partner HIF- 1 β was constitutively expressed. There was not a simple relationship between HIF- 1 α expression and apoptosis. Apoptotic cardiomyocytes were detected in HIF- 1 α-positive and -negative regions, and a hypoxic stimulus sufficient to induce nuclear accumulation of HIF- 1 α did not induce cardiomyocyte apoptosis. The hypoxia-dependent expression of the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR 2) in the distal OFT myocardium may be protective as cardiomyocyte apoptosis {{in the early stages}} (25 – 30) of OFT remodeling was absent from this region. Furthermore, recombinant adenoviral-mediated expression of dominant negative Akt, an inhibitor of tyrosine kinase receptor signaling, augmented cardiomyocyte apoptosis in the OFT and constitutively active Akt suppressed it. Adenovirus-mediated forced expression of VEGF 165 induced conotruncal malformation such as double outlet right ventricle (DORV) and ventricular septal defect (VSD), similar to defects observed when apoptosis-dependent remodeling of the OFT was specifically targeted. We conclude that normal developmental remodeling of the embryonic avian cardiac OFT involves hypoxia/HIF- 1 -dependent signaling and cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Autocrine signaling through VEGF/VEGFR 2 and Akt provides survival signals for the hypoxic OFT cardiomyocytes, and regulated VEGF signaling is required for the normal development of the OFT...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{contains}} {{four separate}} {{papers in the}} field of monetary economics. The common basis for all the papers is that they deal with money and network effects in one way or another. Although the common basis is the same in all the articles, different approaches are used: theory, econometrics and history of economic thought. This first essay focuses on the network effect in the use of money and the problems associated with this. A two-currency model is constructed to derive conditions about Nash equilibria inducing monetary unions and parallel currencies. Individual differences among the population are allowed, in contrast to a representative agent model. Equilibria are derived both when rational individuals make currency choices individually and when choices are made by vote maximizing politicians. The results are compared and evaluated according to the Pareto criterion. It is shown that neither political decision, nor the market process will guarantee an efficient outcome. The political solution will, however, more often give preferable solutions. Carl Menger has been cited as a forerunner to the network theory of money. The second essay analyzes Carl Menger's monetary theory and evaluates whether he was aware of the network characteristic of money. The analysis is focused on the German word Absatzfähigkeit, which is defined and analyzed by Menger and is central in his monetary theory. An English translation of this word can be marketability or saleability. Parts of this concept cover an essential idea behind the network property of a potential medium of exchange. The result is, nevertheless, mixed. It cannot be said that his analysis is complete enough to call him a forerunner in all respects. In the third essay the changeover process from the local national currency to the Euro in the countries participating in the third stage of EMU is described and analyzed. The article tries to find factors that can help to explain the different pace of transition between the countries introducing Euro bank notes. It is found that the initial supply of Euros, the country size, the duration of <b>dual</b> <b>circulation</b> and the number of bank branches (per capita) in the economy explain {{a large part of the}} variation in the pace of adoption. The first two factors can have its origin in the network property of currency. Psychological factors, such as nationalism, have not been found to significantly influence the outcome. The final essay analyzes the adoption pattern of a new currency. The purpose of the essay is to construct two different types of models, network models and mechanical velocity models, which may help to explain the adoption path and to enrich the theories explaining the adoption process of a new currency. It is shown that network models can generate both concave, convex and S-shaped adoption functions. The velocity models can only generate concave adoption functions. Both types of models can be used to derive the observed concave adoption pattern during the currency exchange period experienced in all Euro area countries...|$|E
40|$|This thesis investigates Slovak citizens’ {{attitudes towards}} the Euro {{changeover}} and the numerical demands {{imposed on them}} {{in the context of}} the currency change. The numerical demands varied considerably from country to country depending on the simplicity or complexity of the conversion rates. This research into currency change follows in the tradition of economic psychology. A number of studies have examined the problems with currency conversion, including the development of price intuition, using this approach (Marques and Dehaene, 2004; Ranyard et al., 2003; Hofmann et al., 2007). The present research draws on this, and in particular on ideas from the ‘Psycho-Social’ (Hofmann et al., 2007) approach within the economic psychology and from Adult Numeracy tradition (Evans, 2000; Lave, 1988). The model used here studies the relationship between cognitive performance and affective variables, an approach based on Evans (2000). This account of the currency changeover emphasises the importance of the context in which numerical thinking takes place, and aims to study the adult learner with conversion/calculation tasks in everyday life contexts. In order to illustrate the support given by the state, organisations and communities on national and local levels to guide the currency conversion, descriptions of various documents are presented. This repeated cross-sectional study elicits responses from a series of representative samples of citizens in the Slovak Republic on their attitudes to the Euro, their context specific conversion strategies (Hofmann et al., 2007), and the development of ‘price intuition’ (Marques and Dehaene, 2004). Respondents were selected based on a tightly designed quota sampling method, controlling for region, age and gender to collect the required number of responses from each group. The research was conducted at five different points in time: the ‘pilot study’ was conducted before the introduction of the Euro in April 2008; Phase 1 took place during the <b>dual</b> <b>circulation</b> in January 2009, Phase 2 in August 2009; and Phase 3 in January 2011. All four phases used primary survey data. Additional clinical interviews were conducted in July 2012. Some results are compared to the Eurobarometer surveys conducted in other EU countries to place the findings in a broader context. A key idea is that of an adaptation strategy. Hofmann et al., (2007) proposed that there were four different forms of adaptation: a conversion strategy, an anchor strategy, a marker value strategy, and an intuitive strategy. At the beginning of the Euro changeover, the conversion strategy was the most frequently used strategy by all socio-economic groups and none of the other strategies were used very often. However, two years after the changeover citizens became more selective and used different adaptation strategies for different problem solving tasks with the intuitive strategy being the most frequently applied. Furthermore, Slovak citizens share some common concerns with citizens of other countries, such as the perception that prices in the Euro currency appear cheaper; something known as the ‘Euro Illusion’. The illusion was stronger when people started to rely on intuition to make purchasing decisions. Overall, the empirical results show that the Slovak citizens adapted rather well to the new currency and the policy makers managed to avoid unexpected price increases which were common in other Eurozone countries. The experience and lessons learnt could be informative and supportive for new entrants and policy makers, as the Euro is likely to be introduced in other countries, particularly Central and Eastern European countries. Since this study has been done the Euro has been introduced in Estonia and Latvia could be joining as early as January 2014 followed by Lithuania in 2015...|$|E
40|$|Background—Clinical {{applications}} {{of the principles of}} dual atrioventricular nodal (AVN) electrophysiology in the treatment of AVN reentrant tachycardias rely on empirical findings, such as discontinued conduction curves or the presence of specific catheter-recorded signals. However, neither the shape of the conduction curve nor the surface electrograms have been validated as functionally related to the presence of slow or fast wavefronts. Methods and Results—We performed in vitro studies using 10 rabbit atrial-AVN preparations. A bipolar roving electrode was used to explore the endocardial surface of the triangle of Koch during programmed electrical stimulation. Microelectrodes were impaled in AVN cells to correlate surface and intracellular responses. In 7 preparations, a specific area near the compact cell region produced surface electrograms that were dissociated in 2 distinct components, with progressive shortening of prematurity. Similar dissociation was demonstrated during Wenckebach periodicity and increased vagal tone. Cellular recordings supported the presence of early (“fast”) and late (“slow”) wavefronts, with different refractory properties. Although the fast-slow transition was a basis for discontinued propagation, the AVN conduction curves were smooth in the majority of cases. Conclusions—Exploration of the triangle of Koch during programmed pacing reveals the presence of dual-wavefront surface potentials. Clinical confirmation of these AVN potentials could provide a new, sensitive tool in defining <b>dual</b> AVN electrophysiology. (<b>Circulation.</b> 2000; 101 : 2110 - 2117. ...|$|R
40|$|<b>Dual</b> wall reverse <b>circulation</b> (DWRC) {{drilling}} {{was used}} to drill 48 borings during a groundwater contaminant investigation at the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant, Paducah, Kentucky. This method was selected {{as an alternative to}} conventional hollow stem auger drilling for a number of reasons, including the expectation of minimizing waste, increasing the drilling rate, and reducing the potential for cross contamination of aquifers. Groundwater samples were collected from several water-bearing zones during drilling of each borehole. The samples were analyzed for volatile organic compounds using a field gas chromatograph. This approach allowed the investigation to be directed using near-real-time data. Use of downhole geophysical logging, in conjunction with lithologic descriptions of borehole cuttings, resulted in excellent correlation of the geology {{in the vicinity of the}} contaminant plume. The total volume of cuttings generated using the DWRC drilling method was less than half of what would have been produced by hollow stem augering; however, the cuttings were recovered in slurry form and had to be dewatered prior to disposal. The drilling rate was very rapid, often approaching 10 ft/min; however, frequent breaks to perform groundwater sampling resulted in an average drilling rate of < 1 ft/min. The time required for groundwater sampling could be shortened by changing the sampling methodology. Analytical results indicated that the drilling method successfully isolated the various water bearing zones and no cross contamination resulted from the investigation...|$|R
40|$|BackgroundAdult-type {{abnormal}} {{origin of}} coronary artery from pulmonary artery (ACAPA) is uncommon compared to infant-form which usually induces extended myocardial necrosis and severe heart failure. The adult-type form results in mild and rare symptoms, {{but it can}} cause myocardial ischemia and sudden cardiac death at childhood and adult age. The objective {{of this study was}} to describe the mode of presentation, cardiovascular imaging methods for diagnosis and outcomes of patients diagnosed with adult-type ACAPA. Material and methodsThe Patient Congenital Heart Disease database was reviewed to identify all patients diagnosed with ACAPA and/or who had surgical repair beyond the first year of life. ResultsFrom March 1976 to July 2011, 13 patients were identified with adult-type ACAPA, at the age of 6 months to 64 years: 9 with left coronary artery from pulmonary artery (ALCAPA) and 4 with right coronary artery from pulmonary artery (ARCAPA). Cardiac symptoms initiated investigation in 9 patients and a murmur in 4. Nine were diagnosed by transthoracic echocardiography, 4 by coronary artery angiography and 1 by cardiac computed tomography. Myocardial ischemia was detected preoperatively in 6 patients with ALCAPA (66. 7 %) and 1 with ARCAPA (25 %). Ten patients underwent surgical implantation of the ACAPA into the ascending aorta. All were asymptomatic after repair except one who required a second surgery at 7. 9 years follow-up. ConclusionsAdult-type ACAPA can be assessed by non invasive cardiovascular imaging.

40|$|AbstractObjectives: In animals the Cardeon Cobra {{catheter}} (Cardeon Corp, Cupertino, Calif) allows {{independent control}} of aortic arch and descending aortic temperatures and profoundly reduces cerebral embolization during bypass. This investigation describes the first clinical {{use of the}} device during adult cardiac surgery. The {{purpose of the study}} was to confirm that the Cobra catheter delivers adequate cerebral and systemic perfusion while providing simultaneous cerebral hypothermia and systemic normothermia during cardiopulmonary bypass. Methods: In a prospective multicenter study the Cobra aortic catheter was placed in 20 adults undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass. Arch and corporeal temperatures, bypass flows, and arterial blood pressures were recorded intraoperatively. Jugular bulb and mixed venous oxygen saturation was used to assess the adequacy of cerebral and systemic perfusion. Results: Surgeons at 3 institutions placed the Cobra catheter in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (n = 13), valve (n = 3), and combined valve-bypass (n = 4) operations. Mean total bypass flows of 2. 1 ± 0. 2 L · min− 1 · − 2 maintained mean arterial pressures in arch and descending aortic circulations of greater than 55 mm Hg. A mean differential of 4. 3 °C between arch and descending aortic temperatures was established before crossclamp application, and a mean maximum temperature differential of 7 °C was established during bypass. A 2. 4 °C temperature differential was maintained at crossclamp removal. Cerebral and systemic venous oxygen saturation remained greater than 65 % during bypass. Conclusions: The Cobra device met all expectations for an arterial cannula with adequate perfusion to the arch and corporeal <b>circulations.</b> <b>Dual</b> perfusion with the Cobra catheter allows for independent temperature control during cardiopulmonary bypass with simultaneous cerebral hypothermia and systemic normothermia.
