60|$|Miss Mackenzie {{went on to}} the Cedars, and {{her mind}} almost misgave her in going there, as she was driven up through the dull brick lodges, which looked as though no paint had touched them for the last thirty years, up to {{the front door of the}} dull brick house, which bore almost as dreary a look of neglect as the lodges. It was a large brick house of three stories, with the door in the middle, and three windows on each side of the door, and a railed area with a kitchen below the ground. Such houses were built very {{commonly}} in the neighbourhood of London some hundred and fifty years ago, and they may still be pleasant enough to the eye if there be ivy over them, and if they be clean with new paint, and spruce with the outer care of gardeners and the inner care of housemaids; but old houses are often like old ladies, who require more care in their dressing than they who are younger. Very little care was given to the Cedars, and the place therefore always looked ill-dressed. On the right hand as you entered was the dining-room, and the three windows to the left were all devoted to the hall. Behind the dining-room was Sir John's study, as he called it, and behind or beyond the hall was the drawing-room, from which four windows looked out into the garden. This might have been a pretty room had any care been taken to make anything pretty at the Cedars. But the furniture was old, and the sofas were hard, and the tables were rickety, and the curtains which had once been red had become brown with the sun. The dinginess of the house had not struck Miss Mackenzie so forcibly when she first visited it, as it did now. Then she had come almost direct from Arundel Street, and the house in Arundel Street had itself been very dingy. Mrs Stumfold's drawing-rooms were not dingy, nor were her own rooms in the Paragon. Her eye had become accustomed to better things, and she now saw at once <b>how</b> <b>old</b> <b>were</b> the curtains, and how lamentably the papers wanted to be renewed on the walls. She had, however, been drawn from the neighbouring station to the house in the private carriage belonging to the establishment, and if there was any sense of justice in her, it must be presumed that she balanced the good things with the bad.|$|E

They started to {{interrogate}} us. Well those they interrogated they'd take out there and begin flogging them. The flogging went on in Osipov's house. My sister was there, too. They caught my sister {{the next day in}} the field and brought her in. And they rounded up all the cows took them away. They interrogated one woman interrogated another and let them go. Well, I think, they'll let us all go. We can see out of awindow in the bathhouse. And then they ran after them and brought them back. Then they summoned Dyubenchikha. Each family separately. And flogged them with a lash. They summoned Djubenczicha, they summoned Szarpenczicha, they summoned Bychowcowa... Each family separately. And - they don't come back. They summoned them - and they don't come back. Then I had to go with my kids. They summoned me. QUESTION: <b>How</b> <b>old</b> <b>were</b> your children? One boy was born in thirty-three, the other in thirty-seven. Well, and as soon as they'd summoned me there, into the house, they Ain Mere immediately said: 'Say where your husband is!' I says: 'He was called up in the first mobilization.' 'Speak, you, partisan scum! Where were you today?' 'Nowhere,' I says, 'I cooked some food for the kids, washed some laundry. I didn't go anywhere. 'Speak at once!...' He grabbed me by the hair and threw me to the ground. Started to thrash me. They brought a jar of sand, this big jar of dry sand. 'Hat it,' he says, 'you, partisan bitch!' They poured it onto the table. And I ate that sand. It was dry, wouldn't go down. There was manure there and everything. There's no way I can eat it. And all the same I ate it - I was choking, couldn't breathe. I ate it all up. He started to thrash my head like mad with the lash. 'Lick it clean, you, dog, lick up that sand.' I licked it up with my tongue. Then: 'Stick out your tongue! Onto the table!' I'm standing there like that, and he tugs away at my head by the hair. Then pulled out my tongue and started to pierce it with a big needle. Everything just went numb, I didn't feel anything... Then - my hair... One twisted, then the other twisted my hair - how they tugged at it, how they tugged at it!... They tore all the hair from my head. Then they laid me down, one of them stepped on my head, the other on my feet and they started to flog me with lashes. They flogged and flogged me... They would have flogged me to death just like my sister and Djubenczicha... But they brought them something to eat. Bread spread with butter and these mess-tins. They grabbed up that food and went out into the street. And a German dragged us to the shed. He dragged us right up to it and motions to us - he covered us with sacking and rags and motions to us: don't get up. And he himself went off and didn't come back for some time. He comes leading a horse. This great big horse. They start leading it over the people, to trample them. The kids - with that horse... An officer brought it, the interpreter. A German. But people say: 'You're doing wrong ... mister interpreter.' 'Why,' he says, 'am I doing wrong?' 'My husband was called up in the first mobilization... What are you punishing us so for?...' Then the interpreter started to look how people were lying - who was alive. It was already rather late. And those polizeis... They sure had their fun with us!... First of all they took Lida Bychowcowa and dragged her along. And stuck her boy with a bayonet. And they threw them right into the pit - and shot them. Well, and then came Szarpenczicha. Then Djubenkina's family. And Djubenkina's daughter was there, she was called Janina, sixteen years old she was. A German came, an officer, and says: 'If you agree to be with me, you'll live, but if you don't agree, we'll kill you.' And she goes: 'Kill me!' She huddled up behind her mother, who was already dead. 'I'm not going anywhere!...' Then they took them to the pit and shot them. And now my older boy is going... And I couldn't feel with my legs any more whether I was walking over the earth or sky. I'm burning all over, all covered with lash-marks, my hair is all torn out, my tongue swole up. They lead us to the pit. And my older boy calls out: 'Don't shoot, dear sirs!' And the younger one... I was carrying him in my arms... I don't remember anything more... I found myself in the pit. There was just a flash, this fire... He shot my older son first, then me, then the younger boy... Well, then they buried us - I don't remember anything, but I hear - the sand at first goes sh-sh, sh-sh, sh-sh... They started to throw in sand. Ants crawled into my mouth and nose. It was awful there in the earth. They buried us, I heard them leave - stomp-stomp, stomp-stomp... That I seemed to remember. But how I got out and crawled off a ways, like from here to that little house - I remember nothing about it. I remember that when I got out I thought: 'I'll crawl over and drown myself in the stream.' That I remember. But then, when I'd collapsed, I'd raise my head - and couldn't go on. I didn't know, see, that I'd been shot. I don't remember anything. They say I was shot through: I was shot here {{in the back of the}} head, and the bullet corned out. They flew in that ... doctor from behind the front line, to the Selyavshchina airfield. Uh-huh. I only got back my memory on the ninth day. The woman at whose place I stayed, Belkowa, told me that. Well, when the Germans left, the partisans came here. And I crawled off, a ways, lay down, and a pool of blood, people say, collected there... I was lying in that blood. I hear someone starts to speak. From Sosni, this man who lived there. Waszen was their last name, the Wasznjows. The old man ran up and says: 'Some woman is lying here, a dead woman. Semionowna! Collective farmers, over here!' They came running. And I heard his voice, raised myself up backward like this - I hit against the ground and blood poured out from my mouth, from my ears - all over. They lifted me up on some rags and carried me to the Belkows' house. It's only afterwards they sent for the doctor. My husband tame from his detachment - sent for him. That doctor came and got the sand out of me. Both vomit and sand came out. He got everything out - both sand and water... He put something on those wounds on my tongue, then here, on this wound... Nurses came from the detachment so the wound wouldn't fester. But my head kept going bom-bom-bom... No ways it would stop. And he came later, opened my skull, and there was blood on the membrane of the brain, and he took out that blood with some kind of little spoon. When he'd removed the blood from the membrane... QUESTION: You say the doctor flew in from behind the front line? To Seljawszczina, to the airfield. They wanted to fly me behind the front line. But the surgeon says: 'To save yourself, you need a pail of poppy-seeds and honey mixed together. You must grind the poppy-seeds, pound and grind them with the honey and eat it. You've lost all your blood. Then you'll get well and be able to leave your bed. But if you don't use this... They won't give it to you behind the front line. Wartime.' So then. That's how I got well. The inhabitants brought me a pail of poppy-seeds within a day, and we had our own honey, we had our own bees. That's what. I got back my memory only on the ninth day and started to eat that, and only got back on my feet after four months." ...|$|E

40|$|This {{presentation}} {{reports on}} research that documents and describes how environmental knowledge and land skills are being generated and transmitted among Inuit in Ulukhaktok, Northwest Territories, Canada. In previous {{research in the}} Arctic, Inuit have expressed concern {{that as a result}} of rapid societal changes, the traditional modes of intergenerational knowledge transmission by which Inuit have developed the skills to hunt safely and successfully no longer function effectively. Younger generation Inuit are spending considerably less time involved in subsistence activities beyond organized land-camps and occasional hunting trips but comparatively more time engaged in formal education and wage employment. This has implications for culture, health and well-being, and for adaptation to changing climatic conditions. The transmission of 92 items of Inuit environmental knowledge and land skills was studied with a sample of 42 Inuit males between the ages 18 and 49 years in Ulukhaktok (approximately 50 % of the potential sample). Data were collected through semi-structured interviews, free-listing and pile sorts. The general objectives of the interviews were to learn if an informant had learned a particular skill, if yes, who was their major teacher, how did they learn this skill, <b>how</b> <b>old</b> <b>were</b> they when they learned the skill, and what factors helped facilitate or impede transmission. The results are expected to inform initiatives to help facilitate the transmission of land skills and related environmental knowledge, many already underway, in the Inuvialuit Settlement Region and elsewhere in the Arctic...|$|E

Safe Room Access FRS and HBAI data Safe Room access datasets for the Family Resources Survey (FRS) and Households Below Average Income (HBAI) are available {{in addition to the}} versions available under the standard End User Licence (EUL) held at the UK Data Archive under GN 33283 and SN 5828. SN 7196, Family Resources Survey, 2005 / 06 - 2014 / 15 and Households Below Average Income, 1994 / 95 - 2014 / 15 : Safe Room Access, replaces SNs 5839, 6083, 6253 and 6532, which were previously available under Special Licence. The Safe Room access data are only available for access from the UK Data Archive's Safe Room at the University of Essex, Colchester. Prospective users of the Safe Room access version of the FRS/HBAI will need to fulfil requirements additional to those associated with standard End User Licence datasets, commencing with the completion of an extra application form to demonstrate to the data owners exactly why they need access to the extra, more detailed variables, in order to obtain permission to use that version. Safe Room access users must also complete face-to-face training and agree to Secure Access User Agreement and Licence Compliance Policy (see 'Access' section below), as well as completing a Baseline Personal Security Standard (BPSS) check. Full details of the application requirements will be provided to users when they have placed an order for access to the data, and are available from Guidance on applying for the Family Resources Survey: Secure Access. Users are encouraged to download and inspect the EUL versions of the data prior to ordering the Safe Room access version. As the FRS is the main source of data used by the HBAI, the Safe Room access version of the HBAI data has been included with the FRS. The Safe Room access version of the FRS/HBAI dataset is currently available to UK HE/FE applicants only. Further information about the FRS {{can be found on the}} Family Resources Survey pages on the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) web site and further information regarding HBAI is also available from the DWP HBAI web page. European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC) In 2005, the European Union (EU) made a legal obligation for member states to collect additional statistics on income and living conditions (EU-SILC). In addition to this the EU-SILC data cover poverty and social exclusion. These statistics are used to help plan and monitor European social policy by comparing poverty indicators and changes over time across the EU. The EU-SILC requirement was integrated into the General Household Survey (GHS) /General Lifestyle Survey (GLF) in 2005. Since the closure of the GLF in 2012 the cross-sectional element of EU-SILC has been collected via the FRS. The FRS also provides the first wave of the EU-SILC longitudinal element, which is carried out by the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Please refer to study documentation for further details. FRS: The FRS aims to: support the monitoring of the social security programme support the costing and modelling of changes to National Insurance contributions and social security benefits provide better information for the forecasting of benefit expenditure From April 2002, the FRS was extended to include Northern Ireland. As the FRS does not track individuals over time, analysis of incomes is supplemented by the use of longitudinal data from the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS) element of the Understanding Society survey (held at the Archive under GN 33423). The BHPS (held at the Archive under GN 33196) was subsumed into Understanding Society from the beginning of 2009. The Safe Room access version of the FRS contains unrounded data and data within the following variables which are not available within the standard EUL versions: Household Table: LAC (Local Authority Code) - all years NICOUN (Northern Ireland District Council Code) - from 2007 / 08 LONDON (location of household) - from 2007 / 08 CAPVAL - Weeklyised Capital Value - from 2008 / 09 BRMA - Broad Rental Market Area - from 2008 / 09 OAC - ONS Area Classification - from 2009 / 10 SSTRTREG (FRS regional stratifier) - from 2009 / 10 URINDS (urban and rural indicators for Scotland) - from 2009 / 10 URINDEW (urban and rural indicators for England and Wales) - from 2009 / 10 GROSSCT (gross Council Tax - Band D) - from 2009 / 10 URB - Northern Ireland Urban Rural var (3 category) - from 2011 / 12 URBRUR - Northern Ireland Urban Rural var (5 category) - from 2011 / 12 LAUA - Local Authority Code (new) from 2012 / 13 Adult Table: AGE - all years IAGEGR 2 - Individual Adult 10 Year Age Bands – Pub - all years IAGEGRP - Individual Adult 5 Year Age Bands – Pub – all years MS - Marital status - all years W 1 - Age when widowed – all years NIREL 2 (alternative religious denomination) - from 2008 / 09 DOBMONTH - Month of birth - from 2009 / 10 DOBYEAR - Year of birth - from 2009 / 10 AGEHQUAL - <b>How</b> <b>old</b> <b>were</b> you when you achieved your highest qualification - from 2011 / 12 PENFLAG - Whether is State Pension Age - from 2010 / 11 POLLOPIN - Do you regard yourself as a nationalist, unionist or neither - from 2011 / 12 RELIGENW - Religion in England and Wales - from 2011 / 12 RELIGSC - Religion in Scotland- from 2011 / 12 SIDQN - Sexual Identity - from 2011 / 12 TYPEED - Type of school or college attended - from 2012 - 13 Child Table: DOBMONTH (date of birth month) - from 2009 / 10 DOBYEAR (date of birth year) - from 2009 / 10 TYPEED - Type of school or college attended - from 2012 - 13 HBAI: The HBAI uses household disposable incomes, after adjusting for the household size and composition, as a proxy for material living standards. More precisely, it is a proxy for the level of consumption of goods and services that people could attain given the disposable income of the household in which they live. In order to allow comparisons of the living standards of different types of households, income is adjusted to take into account variations in the size and composition of the households in a process known as equivalisation. A key assumption made in HBAI is that all individuals in the household benefit equally from the combined income of the household. This enables the total equivalised income of the household to be used as a proxy for the standard of living of each household member. This Safe Room access version of the HBAI comprises unrounded data and extra variable CTLIAB - Amount of council tax the household is liable for. An earlier HBAI study, Institute for Fiscal Studies Households Below Average Income Dataset, 1961 - 1991, is held at the Archive under SN 3300. PI series: The Safe Room access version of the FRS/HBAI also contains the Pensioners' Incomes (PI) series data from 2007 / 08 onwards. The PI series carries out a few extra steps beyond the FRS and HBAI data to derive pension income variables. Unlike the standard EUL versions, the ages of the head of household and spouse have not been top-coded at 80 years in the Safe Room access version. Further details of FRS and HBAI data can be found on the FRS major studies and HBAI major studies web pages. The study documentation in the table below includes the UK Data Archive Data Dictionaries for all years of available data, as well as all documentation for 2014 / 15. Documentation for previous years will be provided alongside the data for access and are also available upon request. For the sixth edition (July 2016) data and documentation were added for the year 2014 / 15. Main Topics : FRS: Household characteristics (composition, tenure type); tenure and housing costs including Council Tax, mortgages, insurance, water and sewage rates; welfare/school milk and meals; educational grants and loans; children in education; informal care (given and received); childcare; occupation and employment; health restrictions on work; travel to work (certain years only); children's health; National Health Service treatment (certain years only); prescriptions (certain years only); wage details; self-employed earnings; personal and occupational pension schemes; income and benefit receipt; income from pensions and trusts, royalties and allowances, maintenance and other sources; income tax payments and refunds; National Insurance contributions; earnings from odd jobs; children's earnings; interest and dividends; investments; Company cards; National Savings products; assets; dental treatment and examinations (certain years only); travel documents; medical care; dental treatment; well-being; vehicle ownership(certain years only).
