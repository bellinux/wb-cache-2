5|$|Cain went 4–1 {{over his}} next five starts. This stretch was bolstered {{in part by}} a power surge at the plate by Cain himself. <b>He</b> <b>hit</b> <b>his</b> first and second career home runs in these starts, off Tim Redding of the Washington Nationals and Cubs' ace Carlos Zambrano. In September, he had an 03 record.|$|E
5|$|Kemp {{became the}} {{starting}} right fielder in 2008. <b>He</b> <b>hit</b> <b>his</b> first career grand slam off of Mark Redman on April 26 against the Colorado Rockies.

5|$|On June 16, {{he hit the}} 100th {{home run}} of his career, off Red Sox pitcher Jon Lester in a 63 victory. On July 11, <b>he</b> <b>hit</b> <b>his</b> 34th home run of the season, eclipsing his {{previous}} season high in a 31 victory over the Rangers. He earned his 87th and 88th RBIs {{of the season with}} a two-run home run against Mark Buehrle on July 12, setting a new Orioles record for most RBIs before the All-Star break; the previous record was 86 by Boog Powell. He ultimately ended up with 93 RBIs before the All-Star break. On July 14, <b>he</b> <b>hit</b> <b>his</b> 37th home run of the season against Josh Johnson in a 74 victory over the Toronto Blue Jays, tying Reggie Jackson for the second most home runs before the All-Star break by any MLB player and the most by an American League player. The home run was also his 500th career hit.|$|E
5|$|Shevchenko, who {{had scored}} the decisive penalty against Juventus' Gianluigi Buffon in 2003, {{then had to}} score or Liverpool would win. <b>He</b> <b>hit</b> <b>his</b> penalty {{straight}} {{down the middle of}} the goal. Dudek went down to his right, but blocked the shot with his left hand. Liverpool thus won the penalty shootout by a score of 3–2.|$|E
5|$|Hampered by {{his heavy}} drinking, <b>he</b> <b>hit</b> <b>his</b> peak {{at an early}} age and after an {{unsuccessful}} spell at English club Charlton Athletic from January 1987, ended the 1987–88 season with Third Division club Bristol City. He returned to the First Division after being signed by Alex Ferguson at Manchester United in November 1988 for a £170,000 fee, but failed to restart his career. Barring a brief spell in Hong Kong with Sing Tao, Milne played his last first-team game as a professional at the age of 28.|$|E

50|$|Displacement can {{act in a}} chain-reaction, {{with people}} unwittingly {{becoming}} both victims and perpetrators of displacement.

5|$|His {{breakthrough}} {{began in}} 2000, {{when he was}} voted Player of the Year by the Durham members, particularly for his one-day efforts. His form varied following a back injury, but <b>he</b> <b>hit</b> <b>his</b> stride in 2001, when he excelled both in the County Championship and in the one-day game. In the six English seasons from 2001, Collingwood has exceeded a batting average of 40 four times and achieved a bowling average of less than 40 on three occasions.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} half, each team scored onefield goal and one touchdown, {{although}} Texas missed their extra point so {{they won the}} game 51–10. UT's Jamaal Charles ran for 189yards and three touchdowns on 16carries in his first start for the Longhorns. After the game, Charles said that {{his goal was to}} rush for 200yards each game but that he was not disappointed to fall short of 200yards rushing because <b>he</b> <b>hit</b> <b>his</b> goal of rushing for threetouchdowns.|$|E
5|$|On April 10, 2010, Ramirez {{recorded}} his 2,500th career base hit with an infield single against the Florida Marlins.

5|$|On August 18, 2009, Rodríguez {{was traded}} to the Texas Rangers for minor league {{reliever}} Matt Nevarez and two PTBNL. Teammate David Murphy switched his uniform number to #14 so Rodríguez could wear the #7 he previously wore with the Rangers. In his first game with the Rangers, Rodríguez went 3-for-4 with an RBI double and two singles. <b>He</b> <b>hit</b> <b>his</b> first home run with the Rangers since 2002 on August 29, a solo shot against Minnesota Twins reliever José Mijares.|$|E
5|$|The {{first known}} death {{directly}} related to a hockey fight occurred when Don Sanderson of the Whitby Dunlops, a top-tier senior amateur team in Ontario's Major League Hockey, died in January 2009, a month after sustaining a head injury during a fight: Sanderson's helmet came off during the fight, and when he fell to the ice, <b>he</b> <b>hit</b> <b>his</b> head. His death renewed calls to ban fighting among critics. In reaction, the league has stated that they are reviewing the players' use of helmets.|$|E
5|$|Then, on September 7 he {{came within}} four outs of {{perfection}} when Milwaukee Brewers' Gabe Kapler hit a one-out {{home run in}} the eighth inning. He allowed two hits, did not walk a batter and struck out five, en route to 10–1 victory at Milwaukee's Miller Park. Young did not get his first perfect game or first no-hitter, but he did end up with the first complete game of his career after 114 starts. Two starts later <b>he</b> <b>hit</b> <b>his</b> first home run as a major league batter.|$|E
2500|$|Displacement {{can also}} {{act in a}} {{what looks like a}} 'chain-reaction', with people unwittingly {{becoming}} both victims and perpetrators of displacement.

5|$|Bradman practised batting incessantly {{during his}} youth. He invented his own solo cricket game, using a cricket stump for a bat, and a golf ball. A water tank, {{mounted on a}} curved brick stand, stood on a paved area behind the family home. When hit into the curved brick facing of the stand, the ball rebounded at high speed and varying angles—and Bradman would attempt to hit it again. This form of {{practice}} developed his timing and reactions to a high degree. In more formal cricket, <b>he</b> <b>hit</b> <b>his</b> first century {{at the age of}} 12, with an undefeated 115 playing for Bowral Public School against Mittagong High School.|$|E
5|$|Davis's 50th {{home run}} of the season, which he hit on September 13, tied him with Brady Anderson for the Orioles record of most home runs in a single season. He also became only the third player in MLB history, after Babe Ruth (New York Yankees, 1921) and Albert Belle (Cleveland Indians, 1995), to hit 50 home runs and 40 doubles in a single season. <b>He</b> <b>hit</b> <b>his</b> 51st home run on September 17, setting a new Orioles single season record. This was also his 92nd extra-base hit of the season, again tying Anderson for a {{franchise}} record. He later surpassed that by hitting his first triple of the season against Alex Cobb on September 21 in a 51 loss to Tampa Bay. Davis broke another Orioles record on September 27 with his 28th home {{run of the}} season hit at his home park of Camden Yards, surpassing Frank Robinson's record of 27 home runs hit at Memorial Stadium in 1966.|$|E
5|$|Hearts {{started the}} match as the {{brighter}} {{of the two}} teams. Rudi Skácel headed wide early on from an Andrew Driver cross. Hearts took the lead through Darren Barr in the 15th minute, scoring from close range. Hearts continued to control the match and Pa Kujabi picked up a booking for fouling Suso Santana. Skácel then doubled Hearts' lead after receiving {{the ball on the}} edge of the area and turning to hit a shot which deflected off James McPake before going in. Hibs then had an opportunity as Kujabi's cross came to Garry O'Connor, but <b>he</b> <b>hit</b> <b>his</b> shot over the bar. McPake then made a goal-line clearance from a Suso shot which had beaten Hibs' keeper Mark Brown. McPake got Hibs back into the game from a corner. Tom Soares' initial delivery was cleared but he got the ball back out on the wing and put in a low cross which McPake converted.|$|E
25|$|Drummer Robo {{was wearing}} bracelets {{on his left}} wrist that rattled when he played; the rattling, {{whenever}} <b>he</b> would <b>hit</b> <b>his</b> snare drum, especially when <b>he</b> <b>hit</b> downbeats on it, {{became part of the}} sound.|$|R

The dear Lord makes strong the arm of the patriot, and takes care that <b>he</b> <b>hits</b> <b>his</b> man well in the middle." ...|$|R
5|$|Immediately {{after this}} match, Jardine made his Test debut against the West Indies who were touring England that season. This was West Indies' first ever Test match. The team possessed several fast bowlers who had enjoyed some {{success on the}} tour of England. Many batsmen only played them with difficulty, {{particularly}} on the occasional fast-paced pitch, but Jardine played them confidently. Jardine played {{in the first two}} Tests, both of which were won by England by an innings, but missed the third for unknown reasons. He scored 22 on his debut, but was more successful in the second Test. He scored 83: when he had scored 26, <b>he</b> <b>hit</b> <b>his</b> wicket when setting off for a run, but was given not out. At the time, a batsman was not out if he had completed his shot and was setting off for a run; the West Indian cricketer Learie Constantine believed that Jardine was only given not out because he told the umpire his shot was complete. Later, while he was batting with Tate, a player with whom {{he did not have a}} good relationship, Jardine was run out when Tate refused to go for a run.|$|E
5|$|In August, the Mets' lead {{began to}} dissipate, as the Phillies {{combined}} several solid series; Rollins {{was a key}} component of their success. Rollins was named the National League Player of the Week for August 27 to September 2, 2007. On September 25 against the Atlanta Braves, Rollins hit the home run that completed his 30–30 season. On {{the last day of the}} 2007 season, Rollins became the seventh player to collect at least 20 doubles, 20 triples, and 20 home runs in one season when <b>he</b> <b>hit</b> <b>his</b> 20th triple of the year in a 6–1 win over the Washington Nationals that clinched the National League East division championship for the Phillies, which confirmed Rollins' preseason assertion of the Phillies preeminence. The club advanced to the playoffs for the first time since their 1993 World Series loss; however, they were swept by the Colorado Rockies in the National League Division Series.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the live}} {{pay-per-view}} broadcast, Buck Quartermaine defeated The Brooklyn Brawler {{in a dark}} match. In the first televised match, Razor Ramon defended his WWF Intercontinental Championship against Jeff Jarrett, who was accompanied by The Roadie. Ramon used his strength to dominate {{the opening of the}} match. Jarrett gained the momentum with a series of dropkicks and then choked Ramon with a sleeper hold. Ramon ran at Jarrett but was thrown over the top rope. <b>He</b> <b>hit</b> <b>his</b> knee when he landed, and The Roadie then hit Ramon from behind in the knee. Ramon was unable to return to the ring, so Jarrett was awarded the match via countout. Because the championship cannot change hands on a countout, Jarrett challenged Ramon to continue the match. Ramon agreed and nearly pinned Jarrett twice. Jarrett applied the figure four leglock to apply pressure to Ramon's injured knee. Ramon escaped the hold and attempted to perform the Razor's Edge. He collapsed under Jarrett's weight, however, and Jarrett pinned him to win the title.|$|E

Tom walks through a desert, with Jerry sleepwalking behind him.|$|R
