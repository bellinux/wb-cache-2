All pre-ordered copies of the game included four in-game vests for Delsin.|$|E
5|$|The unmarked {{bills from}} the robbery {{were easy to}} exchange, but the serial numbers of the 500-ruble notes were known to the authorities, making them {{impossible}} to exchange in Russian banks. By the end of 1907, Lenin decided to exchange the remaining 500-ruble notes abroad. Krasin had his forger try to change some of the serial numbers. Two hundred of these notes were transported abroad by Martyn Lyadov (they were sewn into <b>his</b> <b>vest</b> by the wives of Lenin and Bogdanov at Lenin's headquarters in Kuokkala). Lenin's plan was to have various individuals exchange the stolen 500-ruble notes simultaneously {{at a number of}} banks throughout Europe. Zhitomirsky heard of the plan and reported it to the Okhrana, who contacted police departments throughout Europe asking them to arrest anyone who tried to cash the notes.|$|E
25|$|The {{bodies of}} Welsh and Morgan {{had not been}} {{recovered}} {{at the time of}} the jury's deliberations; the cause of their disappearance and deaths was not considered by the inquest. The body of Welsh was found in November on a bar in the Yukon River between Tantalus and Five Fingers, about twenty-five (40km) to thirty miles (48km) below the site of the disaster. A lynx had been spotted gnawing on something on the bar; Welsh was identified by the buttons remaining on <b>his</b> <b>vest</b> which was still on his body.|$|E

50|$|Yancy Derringer's {{weapons of}} choice were four-barrel Sharps pepperbox derringer handguns.

25|$|The next, {{and final}} match on the undercard, was the {{encounter}} of The Rock and Stone Cold Steve Austin. The match began with Austin and Rock brawling in the ring, which {{ended up at}} ringside. Throughout the match, Rock worked over Austin's leg, which included Rock applying a Sharpshooter on Austin. Rock then began to taunt Austin, as he put on <b>his</b> <b>vest</b> and imitated his taunts, which led to The Rock running into a Rock Bottom by Austin. Rock then retaliated by delivering a Stone Cold Stunner. Austin performed the Stone Cold Stunner on Rock for a near-fall, much to Austin's shock. After he failed to win with the People's Elbow, Rock then performed three Rock Bottoms on Austin {{that led to the}} Rock successfully pinning Austin and winning the match.|$|E
25|$|Toad bears {{a similar}} {{appearance}} {{to the rest}} of his species with his large mushroom cap and clothes. He is very small in size, and has no legs visible, with just his typical brown shoes showing. Unlike other Toads, he features five red spots on his mushroom cap and wears a blue and yellow vest; however, his coloration will change if he gets a fire flower, as his cap's colors will be reversed while his clothes turn red. A yellow outline was added to <b>his</b> <b>vest</b> in the recent Mario games, starting with Super Mario Sunshine. Sometimes, Toad appears with a red vest, though he is most often seen with his blue vest. In the Mario cartoons, Toad has on occasion removed his mushroom cap, revealing three strands of hair; however, the games have never confirmed or refuted this. Toad is also seen with pants of a white color that resemble the base of a mushroom or toadstool stalk.|$|E
500|$|Stanley was a {{powerful}} orator who used dramatic flourishes to emphasize his points. He would often loosen his tie before he ever started speaking, {{and by the end}} of his speech have thrown off <b>his</b> <b>vest</b> and coat. In one instance, the candidates debated a tax on dog owners of one dollar per dog. Stanley favored the tax, while Morrow contended that everyone should be allowed one dog tax-free. Stanley ridiculed the idea as [...] "Free Old Dog Ring," [...] and sometimes howled like a dog in speeches deriding the proposal. On another occasion Stanley, who had too much to drink, vomited in front of the audience as Morrow spoke. When Stanley took the podium, he remarked, [...] "That just goes to show you what I have been saying all over Kentucky. Ed Morrow plain makes me sick to my stomach." ...|$|E

5000|$|Davis {{started his}} company {{out of his}} garage. In early sales demonstrations, he would put on one of <b>his</b> <b>vests</b> and then shoot himself, usually with a firearm {{provided}} by whatever agency he was demonstrating for. [...] In 1998, Second Chance introduced Zylon-based body armor (bullet-resistant vests), as a lightweight alternative to kevlar. The Zylon material used in the vests was supplied by Japan-based Toyobo.|$|R
500|$|After {{creating}} Oliver's Green Arrow costume, Cranstoun had {{the task}} of crafting updated costume looks for Bart, Arthur, and Victor for the [...] "Justice" [...] episode. Cranstoun explained that even though Victor {{does not have any}} metal on his physical body like his comic book counterpart, she wanted to include a metallic look to his costume. The designer tried to give Victor a more [...] "futuristic" [...] feel, along with [...] "a bit of Transformer-y" [...] essence, by including angular pieces on <b>his</b> <b>vest</b> and coloring them silver, black, and purple. For Bart, the costume designers tried to take what was used in his season four appearance and move that to the next level. In season four, Bart wore a red hoodie with yellow cargo pants, which were used to reflect his teenage identity. With his Justice League appearance, they tried to give the character an appearance that seemed faster. His yellow cargo pants were replaced with red jeans, and his red hoodie was updated to incorporate more of a lightning bolt logo throughout the piece.|$|E
500|$|Costume {{designer}} Lindy Hemming {{explained that}} Bane uses a mask to inhale an analgesic gas, which, in director Christopher Nolan's words, [...] "keeps his pain {{just below the}} threshold so he can function." [...] In designing Bane's costume, Hemming needed it to look [...] "like an amalgam {{of all sorts of}} bits and pieces he cobbled together, as he passed through some very remote places. We made parts of <b>his</b> <b>vest,</b> for example, from fragments of an old military tent. His clothes are militaristic, but are not in any way a uniform." [...] Hemming also designed Bane's mask to look [...] "animalistic". Costume effects supervisor Graham Churchyard created a three-dimensional model of actor Tom Hardy's face and skull to design the mask, allowing the mask to perfectly conform to the contours of Hardy's face. Hemming personally designed Bane's coat, which she admitted took two years to complete. Taking inspiration from a Swedish army jacket and a frock coat from the French Revolution, it was designed to make Bane look like equal parts dictatorial and revolutionary. The design was difficult as Hemming struggled to find a tailor in Los Angeles who could work with shearling.|$|E
500|$|Gates {{maintained}} a {{suite at the}} Waldorf-Astoria of New City from 1894 onwards. Though he paid US$30,000 yearly for it, his visits pained the hotel's manager, George Boldt, at times. [...] Gates and his guests were often loud and boisterous. [...] He had a private entrance and elevator, but Gates {{had a habit of}} banging on the elevator doors and shouting for service. Boldt instructed his elevator operators to take their time when serving his floor, as it allowed Gates to make as much noise as he wished for a few minutes. Gates' suite was often home to high-stakes poker parties and Baccarat games. Many poker games began on the train from Chicago to New York and were continued at the Waldorf. One poker game lasted for five days and nights; when it was done at least US$2 million had changed hands. Dellora Gates had long since resigned herself to her husband's all-night poker games, but many times became upset about them. [...] Gates made it a practice to keep some unset diamonds in <b>his</b> <b>vest</b> pocket for the times when Dellora became angry about the late hours at cards. He would then present a gem to his wife, who would suddenly forget her anger with him. [...] Dellora would take the diamond to Tiffany & Co. to be set in a piece of jewelry of her choice.|$|E

He challenged the Khan's authority and defeated his commander Mamai in the epic Battle of Kulikovo (1380). However, the victory did not bring any short-term benefits; Tokhtamysh in 1382 sacked Moscow hoping to reassert <b>his</b> <b>vested</b> authority over <b>his</b> vassal, the Grand Prince, and his own Mongol hegemony, killing 24,000 people.|$|R
5000|$|Already {{during his}} {{university}} years, Halit Kıvanç {{was interested in}} journalism.

Later, his writings on humor got ahead. His professional journalism career began as he was discovered by Yusuf Ziya Ortaç, the publisher of the that time's notable illustrated satire and humor magazine Akbaba ("Volture"), after his first joke was printed.|$|R

2500|$|The most {{remarkable}} finding was {{the corpse of}} George Leigh Mallory at a height of [...] The lack of extreme injuries indicated he had not tumbled very far. His waist showed severe rope-jerk mottling, showing the two had been roped when they fell. Mallory's injuries were such that a walking descent was impossible: his right foot was nearly broken off {{and there was a}} golf ball-sized puncture wound in his forehead. Even though his unbroken leg was on top of the broken one, as if to protect it, Mass. General Hospital neurosurgeon Dr. Elliot Schwamm believes it not possible that he would have been conscious after the forehead injury. There was no oxygen equipment near the body, but the oxygen bottles would have been empty by that time and discarded at a higher altitude to relinquish the heavy load. Mallory was not wearing snow goggles, although a pair was stored in <b>his</b> <b>vest,</b> which may indicate that he was on the way back by night. However, a contemporary photograph shows he had two sets of goggles when he started his summit climb. The image of his wife Ruth which he intended to put on the summit was not in <b>his</b> <b>vest.</b> He carried the picture throughout the whole expedition—a sign that he might have reached the top. Since his Kodak pocket camera was not found, there is no proof of a successful climb to the summit.|$|E
2500|$|After the gunfight in Tombstone, {{during which}} the McLaury {{brothers}} and Billy Clanton were killed, Ike Clanton filed murder charges against the Earps and Doc Holliday. They were arrested and released on bail. During a month-long preliminary hearing before Judge Wells Spicer, Clanton told a story of abuse that he had suffered {{at the hands of}} the Earps and Holliday the night before the gunfight. He denied threatening the Earps. He testified that the Clantons and Frank McLaury raised their hands after Virgil's command, and Tom thrust open <b>his</b> <b>vest</b> to show he was unarmed.

Shooting the fight sequence in the Orthanc interiors, without air conditioning (for atmosphere) but with heavy wigs and robes, was described by the actors as [...] "murder". The Grey Havens sequence, which {{takes place at the}} end of The Return of the King, was shot three times due to Sean Astin forgetting <b>his</b> <b>vest</b> after lunch and, then, an out-of-focus camera.|$|E

Smith refused and, in 1844, traveled with Joseph to Carthage, Illinois, where both were charged with riot and treason. Joseph, Hyrum, John Taylor and Willard Richards were held awaiting trial in a jail in Carthage. On June 27, 1844, the building was attacked by a mob of between sixty and two hundred men. While attempting to barricade the door to prevent the mob from entering, Smith {{was shot in the}} face {{on the left side of}} the nose.

Hardin said he was unarmed and excused himself but claims that later that night, Bradley came looking for him. Bradley allegedly fired a shot at Hardin and missed; Hardin drew both his pistols and returned fire, one shot striking Bradley {{in the head and}} the other in his chest. Dozens of people saw this fight, and from them there is a good record of how Hardin had used his guns. His holsters were sewn into <b>his</b> <b>vest</b> so that the butts of his pistols pointed inward across his chest. He crossed his arms to draw. Hardin claimed this was the fastest way to draw, and he practiced every day. A man called [...] "Judge Moore", who held Hardin's stakes of money and a pistol, but refused to give them up without Bradley's consent, later [...] "vanished". Hardin eventually admitted killing two men in Hill County.|$|E
