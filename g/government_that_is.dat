The work chronicles {{the history of the}} agency from its founding in 1947 through the War on Terror, which began after September 11, 2001. The encyclopedia's chronology ends in 2003. It provides approximately 550 entries across 282 pages on topics including notable contributors, intelligence operations, historical events, and depictions of the CIA in fictional media.|$|E
5|$|A {{statutory}} {{board is}} an autonomous {{agency of the}} <b>Government</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> established by an Act of Parliament and overseen by a government ministry. The Act sets out the purposes, powers and rights of the agency. Unlike ministries and government departments that are subdivisions of ministries, statutory boards may not be staffed by civil servants and have greater independence and flexibility in their operations. They are managed by boards of directors whose members usually include businessmen, professionals, senior civil servants and officials of trade unions. The Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR), the Central Provident Fund Board (CPF), the Housing and Development Board (HDB), the Intellectual Property Office of Singapore (IPOS), the Land Transport Authority (LTA), the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA), the National Heritage Board (NHB), and the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) are all statutory boards.|$|E

25|$|While warlords are {{commonly}} viewed as regional leaders who threaten {{the sovereignty of}} a state, {{there are a number}} of states where the central government functions in collusion with warlords to achieve its goal of exercising its sovereignty over regions that would otherwise fall outside its control. In such decentralized states, particularly those where armed groups challenge national sovereignty, warlords can serve as useful allies of a central <b>government</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> unable to establish a monopoly over the use of force within its national territory.|$|E

His popularity has been greatest in the south of France. The FN obtained 10% in the 1984 European elections. A total of 34 FN deputies entered the Assembly after the 1986 elections (the only legislative elections held under proportional representation), which were won by the right wing, bringing Jacques Chirac to Matignon in the first cohabitation <b>government</b> (<b>that</b> <b>is,</b> the combination of a right-wing Prime minister, Chirac, with a socialist President, Mitterrand).|$|E

25|$|The modern {{system of}} the {{division}} of labor upon which the exchange of products is based is in danger of breaking down.... Aside from the demoralizing effect on the world at large and the possibilities of disturbances arising {{as a result of the}} desperation of the people concerned, the consequences to the economy of the United States should be apparent to all. It is logical that the United States should do whatever it is able to do to assist in the return of normal economic health to the world, without which there can be no political stability and no assured peace. Our policy is not directed against any country, but against hunger, poverty, desperation and chaos. Any <b>government</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> willing to assist in recovery will find full co-operation on the part of the USA. Its purpose should be the revival of a working economy in the world so as to permit the emergence of political and social conditions in which free institutions can exist.|$|E
25|$|Where a local {{government}} makes {{a contract that}} is within its power, and then fails to perform its obligations under the contract, it may be sued {{in the same manner}} as any other entity, and may raise all defenses typically available in a contract action. However, if it is a county <b>government</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> alleged to be in breach, Virginia law imposes several additional steps before a lawsuit may be brought. Specifically, the claim must be formally presented to the county's governing body for an allowance, and it is only after that governing body has disallowed the claim that its decision may be appealed to the Virginia Circuit Court. The claim must be brought within thirty days of the disallowance if the claimant is present when the governing body so decides; if the claimant is not present, the claim must be brought within thirty days of the claimant receiving notice of the disallowance. In either case, the appeal must specify that the required presentment was made. This rule also applies to equitable claims for monetary relief.|$|E
25|$|So there’s no real choice this year, {{but what}} the Occupy {{movement}} has done has taken {{us back to the}} era when Martin Luther King was in the Sixties said ‘This is unacceptable!’ We cannot have a situation where everything is owned by the 1% {{in the same way that}} Martin Luther King said in the Riverside Church that we have a <b>government</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> the greatest purveyor of violence in the world today, we are exploiting the planet, and that is unacceptable. So the memory of Martin Luther King – it’s about dreams, but it’s also about the courage to draw a line right there and say ‘We cannot go on crossing this line. This is a moral line, this is a line concerning power and the world’. And there today America is on that line. And people know that what we got to – these years after Martin Luther King was murdered – is completely unacceptable, and it’s his example that will inspire us as we go forward into this year.|$|E

25|$|High {{voter turnout}} is often {{considered}} to be desirable, though among political scientists and economists specializing in public choice, the issue is still debated. A high turnout is generally seen {{as evidence of the}} legitimacy of the current system. Dictators have often fabricated high turnouts in showcase elections for this purpose. For instance, Saddam Hussein's 2002 plebiscite was claimed to have had 100% participation. Opposition parties sometimes boycott votes they feel are unfair or illegitimate, or if the election is for a <b>government</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> considered illegitimate. For example, the Holy See instructed Italian Catholics to boycott national elections for several decades after the creation of the state of Italy. In some countries, there are threats of violence against those who vote, such as during the 2005 Iraq elections, an example of voter suppression. However, some political scientists question the view that high turnout is an implicit endorsement of the system. Mark N. Franklin contends that in European Union elections opponents of the federation, and of its legitimacy, are just as likely to vote as proponents.|$|E

In his campaign announcement speech, Goldwater justified his candidacy by stating that he had [...] "not heard from any announced Republican candidate a declaration of conscience or of political position that could possibly offer to the American people a clear choice in the next presidential election." [...] He emphasized the need for a federal <b>government</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> [...] "limited and balanced and against the ever increasing concentrations of authority in Washington" [...] that encourages personal responsibility among American citizens while pledging his candidacy to [...] "victory for principle and to presenting an opportunity for the American people to choose." [...] He promised [...] "a choice, not an echo" [...] in the election, and positioned himself to the right of Nelson Rockefeller, who had announced his candidacy two months prior.|$|E
500|$|In the 2012 presidential campaign, {{during which}} he {{acknowledged}} {{it was unlikely that}} he would win the Republican Party nomination, Paul again asserted that he was participating in the Republican Party on his own terms, trying to persuade the rest of the party to move toward his positions rather than joining in with theirs. He expressed doubt that he would support any of his rivals should they win the nomination, warning that, “If the policies of the Republican Party are the same as the Democrat Party and they don't want to change anything on foreign policy, they don't want to cut anything, they don't want to audit the Fed and find out about monetary policy, they don't want to have actual change in <b>government,</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> a problem for me." [...] On that same theme he said in another interview, [...] "I would be reluctant to jump on board and tell all of the supporters that have given me trust and money that all of a sudden, I'd say, [...] we've done is for naught. So, let's support anybody at all … even if they disagree with everything that we do." ...|$|E
