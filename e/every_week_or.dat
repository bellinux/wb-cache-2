The same study says that other religions (including Judaism, Buddhism, Hinduism, and Islam) collectively make up about 6% of the population.

500|$|When Goldsmith {{took over}} as editor, there was some concern at Ziff-Davis that she {{might not be able}} to handle the job. [...] A consultant, Norman Lobsenz, was brought in to help her; Lobsenz's title was [...] "editorial director", but in fact Goldsmith made the story selections. [...] Lobsenz {{provided}} blurbs and editorials, read the stories Goldsmith bought, and met with Goldsmith <b>every</b> <b>week</b> <b>or</b> so. [...] Goldsmith was not a long-time sf reader, and knew little about the field; she simply looked for good quality fiction and bought what she liked. [...] In Mike Ashley's words, [...] "the result, between 1961 and 1964, was the two most exciting and original magazines in the field". [...] New writers whose first story appeared in Fantastic during this period included Phyllis Gotlieb, Larry Eisenberg, Ursula K. Le Guin, Thomas M. Disch, and Piers Anthony. [...] The November 1959 issue was dedicated to Fritz Leiber; it included [...] "Lean Times in Lankhmar", one of Leiber's Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser stories. [...] Goldsmith published another half-dozen stories in the series over the next six years, along with other similar (and sometimes imitative) fiction such as early work by Michael Moorcock, and John Jakes' early stories of Brak the Barbarian. [...] This helped to invigorate the nascent sword and sorcery subgenre. [...] Goldsmith obtained an early story by Cordwainer Smith, [...] "The Fife of Bodidharma", which ran in the June 1959 issue, but shortly thereafter Pohl at Galaxy reached an agreement to get first refusal on all Smith's work.|$|E

In the U.S., patients on Medicaid, the low-income government programs, can wait three months or more to see specialists. Because Medicaid payments are low, some have claimed that some doctors {{do not want to see}} Medicaid patients. For example, in Benton Harbor, Michigan, specialists agreed to spend one afternoon <b>every</b> <b>week</b> <b>or</b> two at a Medicaid clinic, which meant that Medicaid patients had to make appointments not at the doctor's office, but at the clinic, where appointments had to be booked months in advance.

[...] Their lives became consumed by meetings, organizing, and planning actions. It was during this time that Ayers and Oughton met Terry Robbins. In March 1968, Oughton helped create a women’s liberation group at a time when such issues were just beginning to emerge among radicals. [...] The group met <b>every</b> <b>week</b> <b>or</b> so, wherever the women could find room. [...] Most of the talk seemed to center on the subordinate role of women in the radical movement and on the sexual oppression of women by the “macho” tendency of males to regard sex as conquest. During these meetings Oughton often discussed the role that women played in the SDS, which was a combination of being a sexual object, an office clerk, and a housekeeper. Later in 1968 Oughton told a friend that while she was away for five days, Ayers had slept with other women. She told the friend she tried to convince herself that it didn't matter, but it did.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Introduction The {{first-line}} {{treatment for}} acromegaly is transsphenoidal surgery. In approximately 50 % of patients, however, a cure {{is not possible}} with surgery and alternatives are needed. Somatostatin analog therapy is the recommended first-line treatment in patients with such cases. Here we provide the first report of a high-dose lanreotide primary therapy in patients with acromegaly. Case presentation Six patients who were not suitable for surgery were given 60 mg of lanreotide (Autogel ®) <b>every</b> four <b>weeks.</b> All patients were German nationals and Caucasian. When the response of our patients was unsatisfactory, the dose was increased sequentially to 90 mg <b>every</b> four <b>weeks,</b> 120 mg <b>every</b> four <b>weeks,</b> 120 mg <b>every</b> three <b>weeks</b> and 180 mg <b>every</b> three <b>weeks.</b> Treatment duration was 12 to 24 months. In all cases, the lanreotide dose was 120 mg <b>every</b> 4 <b>weeks</b> <b>or</b> higher. In five of our patients, growth hormone (GH) levels were successfully reduced (in three patients GH Tumor shrinkage or degeneration was observed in the five responding patients. No drug-related adverse events were noted. Conclusions These results suggest that lanreotide at high doses of 120 mg <b>every</b> four <b>weeks</b> <b>or</b> more is an effective first-line therapy for patients with acromegaly that surgery alone cannot treat. </p...|$|R
