In the present paper we intend to present briefly the fundamental concepts of the human capital, with an emphasis on education and abilities. We also mark out the importance of the human capital development in the purpose of maintaining the development and the motivation of the human resources, which are the main premises organizations need to capitalize. The higher education has a determinant role in the attainment of this desideratum. ...|$|E

The report {{has been part of}} the Safe and Reliable Transport Chains of Dangerous Goods in the Baltic Sea Region (DaGoB) project and the author’s own research. The main aims of the DaGoB project included: a) improve co-operations at various levels among parties concerned in transport of dangerous goods in the BSR; b) provide up-to-date information on cargo flows, supply chain efficiency and risks related to transport of dangerous goods; and c) disseminate and transfer the knowledge gained from the project on local, national, regional and international levels. In this report attempts have been made to enhance our understanding of the field. The <b>essential</b> <b>constituent</b> <b>elements</b> of the maritime transport system and risks have been defined and exhaustively described...|$|E

In order to it we distinguish the conception of the dialectic that appears in his writings of youth from the one that appears in his mature work, and we show that in the latter the dialectic is not referred to the historical development, but to the theoretical exposition of the developed capitalist system. Then we deal with the issue of the succession order of the categories as <b>essential</b> <b>constituent</b> <b>element</b> of the dialectical method, as well as the role of the contradiction in the dialectical exposition. Finally we analyze the fundamental aspects {{of the way in which}} are articulated the dialectic and the critique...|$|R

40|$|The {{object of}} the present paper is to study the {{relation}} of the image of the space to the <b>constituent</b> <b>elements</b> that characterize the Japanese traditional streets such as roofs, windows, walls, and pavements, by means of the method of multivariate analysis. The first, the <b>constituent</b> <b>elements,</b> which influence the image of the space for the Japanese traditional streets, were collected and examined {{as a result of the}} questionnaire in real space. The relation between the variety of the <b>constituent</b> <b>elements</b> and the image was studied by means of the method of correlative analysis and cluster analysis. The second, the change of the image was studied in the psychological experiment by means of modifying the <b>constituent</b> <b>elements</b> on the CRT images operated by computers. The influence of <b>constituent</b> <b>elements</b> on the image was studied by means of the method of quantification I, and analyzed qualitatively. In consequence: 1) The <b>constituent</b> <b>elements</b> that influence on the image were classified, as shown in Table 2. The image of streets that consist of various <b>constituent</b> <b>elements</b> could be modelled and delineated. 2) The image of the space : gorgeousness, hardness, regularity can be represented as a function of the <b>constituent</b> <b>elements.</b> That can be available as indices for the expectation of the image of the real space from the CRT images...|$|R
40|$|The {{right to}} a fair trial and due process is found in all {{relevant}} human rights instruments. Its fundamental value has never been doubted but controversy often flows from the question of what fairness demands in a given situation and the relevance of interests that are extraneous to or in competition with those of the right holder. The House of Lords decision in R v Davis [2008] UKHL 36 regarding the fairness of anonymous witness testimony and the emergency legislative response brings into sharp focus the lack of consensus over the <b>essential</b> <b>constituent</b> <b>elements</b> of a fair trial. The statutory code for witness anonymisation is predicated on a requirement that the measures must be consistent with the provision of a fair trial {{while at the same time}} potentially permitting a conviction to be based decisively on anonymous testimony. The history and context of this legislation demonstrates the delicate balancing act that legislature, executive and judiciary must perform when attempting to protect the rights of the accused whilst neither emasculating the ability of the criminal justice system to bring serious offenders to justice nor exposing witnesses either to the risks of intimidation or to the potentially life changing consequences of witness protection schemes...|$|E
