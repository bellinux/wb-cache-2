500|$|Muransky {{also set}} the all-time [...] "Beef Bowl" [...] record by {{consuming}} [...] of prime rib at Lawry's before the 1979 Rose Bowl. Muransky later recalled: [...] "Bubba Paris and I were two happy freshmen eating {{together at the}} Lawry's Beef Bowl event before the 1979 Rose Bowl Game. After we had enjoyed our fourth plate of prime rib, mashed potatoes, corn and Yorkshire pudding, Bubba asked what the record was, and they said 7 cuts. Bubba continued for 3 more cuts, and I continued for four, totally under the Bo Schembechler radar screen. When they delivered the 8th cut to me, the media started to gather around my table, Bo walked by {{and let me know}} what he was thinking without ever saying a word. Afterward, a Paris-Muransky night out ended with some pizza. The next morning in practice, Bo made an example of Bubba and me. We never ran so much in our lives as we did that day. We were in every play of scrimmage and then we ran sprints." [...] When the Wolverines returned to Pasadena for the 1981 Rose Bowl, [...] "Bo {{made it a point to}} come to the back of the plane and talk to me and Bubba Paris. He wanted to let us know that my record from a couple years earlier would not be in jeopardy because we were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sitting</b> with him at the Lawry's Beef Bowl. He said he was going to limit each of us to two cuts of prime rib." [...] Schembechler had his own take on the story: [...] "I let 'em eat because they were freshmen. They weren't gonna play anyway." ...|$|E
2500|$|One of Evans' {{distinctive}} harmonic traits is {{excluding the}} root in his chords, leaving this {{work to the}} bassist, played on another beat of the measure, or just left implied. [...] "If I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sitting</b> here playing roots, fifths and full voicings, the bass is relegated to a time machine." [...] This idea had already been explored by Ahmad Jamal, Erroll Garner, and Red Garland. In Evans' system, the chord is expressed as a quality identity and a color. Most of Evans' harmonies feature added note chords or quartal voicings. Thus, Evans created a self-sufficient language for the left hand, a distinctive voicing, that allowed the transition from one chord to the next while hardly having to move the hand. With this technique, he created an effect of continuity in the central register of the piano. Laying around middle C, in this region the harmonic clusters sounded the clearest, {{and at the same}} time, left room for contrapuntal independence with the bass.|$|E

[...] Lead guitarist and vocalist of Green Day, Billie Joe Armstrong told Billboard that their aim for ¡Cuatro! as a documentary <b>was</b> [...] "not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the <b>sitting</b> down, head shot of me going, 'We started out blah blah blah'. [...] "We wanted to get into lifestyles of rock 'n' roll and playing rock 'n' roll and letting the story kind of tell itself rather than create revisionist (history)." [...] Green Day drummer Tré Cool told BBC Breakfast that the purpose of the documentary <b>was</b> <b>to</b> show fans what it's like to make a record by giving them an inside look at the process, saying that [...] "People ask what <b>is</b> it like <b>to</b> make a record.

5000|$|Except for its depth, {{the blanket}} of foraminiferal ooze, which likely covers the Zenith Plateau, {{provides}} {{an environment that}} should be helpful for searching for any aircraft wreckage lying on the ocean bottom. According to William Sager, a professor of marine geophysics at the University of Houston in Texas, the surface of ocean bottom covered with foraminiferal ooze is soft enough to squeeze between a person's toes, but it's not so soft that airplane wreckage would sink into it. He stated: [...] "Something big like pieces of an airplane, it's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sitting</b> on the surface." [...] In addition, Robin Beaman, a marine geologist at James Cook University, Queensland, Australia, noted that any large metallic object lying on an ocean bottom covered by foraminiferal ooze would be readily recognizable on an autonomous underwater vehicle's sidescan sonar. Sidescan sonar can be quite good at differentiating the acoustic return of a hard, metallic object {{compared to that of}} an ocean floor covered by ooze.|$|E
