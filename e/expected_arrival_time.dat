2500|$|Low clouds, deteriorating visibility, {{and winds}} that favored Runway 29 in Campbeltown, {{which did not}} have an {{instrument}} approach procedure necessary for landing in such conditions as were forecast for the <b>expected</b> <b>arrival</b> <b>time,</b> posed serious challenges to making a safe landing in Campbeltown. As G-BOMG neared its destination, conditions were worsening. The pilot chose to follow the instrument approach procedure for Runway 11 until he saw the airport, at which point he would circle the airport to land on Runway 29. To perform this manoeuvre, the pilot was not permitted to descend below an altitude of 1,045 feet. However, the weather reports the pilot received when he departed and others he received while en route show the cloud base was down to 400 feet ("broken" [...] cloud layer). This was acceptable for an approach to Runway 11, but not for the circling manoeuvre to Runway 29. At the same time, the wind had increased from 8 kts to 15 kts in Campbeltown, making a landing on Runway 11 increasingly difficult, with significant crosswind and tailwind components. Four minutes before the accident, the controller in Campbeltown advised the pilot that there were now a [...] "few" [...] clouds at 300 feet as well as the broken layer at 400 feet. For the duration of the flight, the pilot likely had very little visual contact with the ground due to being in or over clouds, or out over water in low visibility. As the aircraft descended through the cloud base, the pilot likely had no visual cue that he was below the clouds because the aircraft was about 7nm out to sea and visibility was reported as 1,500 metres. The pilot of a search and rescue helicopter later commented that the sea surface that night would have provided the pilot with little or no visual cues about the aircraft's dangerously low altitude.|$|E

50|$|As {{the threat}} of war between Arbogast and Eugenius and Theodosius I became more imminent, Arbogast and Eugenius moved their {{collective}} force towards the defenses of the Julian Alps, where they made camp in Milan and were joined by Nicomachus Flavianus, who had consulted the Pagan entrails and proclaimed a future victory for the Pagan cause under the names of Eugenius and Arbogastes. Hoping to use the Julian Alps to their advantage, Arbogast and Eugenius planned to use them as the location for their series of ambushes that would, in theory, lead to the encirclement of Theodosius I and his troops. As this was being planned by his enemies, Theodosius I set off from Constantinople for war in the middle of May, reaching Adrianople on June 20, 394 AD. However, upon arriving at Sirmium, Theodosius I took time to reinforce his troops, causing a delay in the <b>expected</b> <b>arrival</b> <b>time</b> of Theodosius, something Arbogast and Eugenius had been counting on for their ambush tactics. Because of the delay, Arbogast thought as though Theodosius I was planning to out flank them by use of an amphibious assault to their south that would have come from behind the heavily defended Adriatic coast. In thinking this, Arbogast dispatched a substantial portion of his forces to the south, which proved to be a costly maneuver by Arbogast.|$|E
