50|$|The {{predecessor}} of INIT II, the INIT I {{trial was}} designed to test safety. 38 individuals were treated with either intranasal <b>insulin</b> <b>spray</b> or placebo, daily for 10 days, and then 2 {{days a week for}} 6 months. The trial showed that intranasal insulin does not accelerate the onset of diabetes. An immune effect was also observed in children and young adults at risk of type 1 diabetes. Intranasal insulin produced effects that suggested a change in the immune attack on the insulin-producing beta cells.|$|E
40|$|Animal {{studies suggest}} that insulin action in the brain is {{involved}} in the regulation of peripheral insulin sensitivity. Whether this holds true in humans is unknown. Using intranasal application of insulin to the human brain, we studied the impacts of brain insulin action on whole-body insulin sensitivity and the mechanisms involved in this process. Insulin sensitivity was assessed by hyper-insulinemic-euglycemic glucose clamp before and after intranasal application of insulin and placebo in random-ized order in lean and obese men. After <b>insulin</b> <b>spray</b> application in lean subjects, a higher glucose infusion rate was necessary to maintain euglycemia compared with placebo. Accordingly, clamp-derived insulin sensi-tivity index improved after <b>insulin</b> <b>spray.</b> In obese sub-jects, this insulin-sensitizing effect could not be detected...|$|E
40|$|For most {{patients}} with type 1 diabetes, {{the worst part}} of the disease is to tolerate needle after needle, both for glucose measurement and to deliver insulin. In the last two decades, concept of insulin therapy by multiple-dose injection has undergone a miraculous change. Needle-free insulin delivery appeared to be a wonderful approach, and its allure rested in being comfortable and safe. In today&#x 2032;s era, insulin delivery by alternative route is a topic of current interest in the design of drug delivery system. Major global pharmaceutical companies are showing encouraging progress in their attempts to develop alternative insulin delivery technologies. Many such drug delivery systems have been developed for oral, buccal and nasal route. This review article discusses, in brief, the novel and emerging technologies that are in pipeline, including insulin inhalers, <b>insulin</b> <b>spray,</b> insulin pill, insulin analogues, insulin complement, islet cell transplant, implantable insulin pumps and guardian continuous glucose monitoring system...|$|E

Pozzilli P, Manfrini S, Costanza F, Coppolino G, Cavallo MG, Fioriti E, Modi P. Source Department of Endocrinoplogy and Diabetes, University Campus Bio-Medico, Rome, Italy. p. pozziilli@unicampus. it Abstract OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the metabolic effect of buccal <b>spray</b> <b>insulin</b> compared with subcutaneous regular insulin {{in patients}} with type 1 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This study compared plasma glucose, insulin, and C-peptide levels in 18 patients with type 1 diabetes treated with subcutaneous regular or buccal <b>spray</b> <b>insulin</b> on 2 consecutive mornings. On day 1, patients were treated with their usual subcutaneous regular insulin regimens. On day 2, patients received buccal <b>spray</b> <b>insulin.</b> In the morning of both days 1 and 2, patients received a standard meal of 630 kJ. No intermediate or long-acting insulin was administered to patients {{on the morning of}} the test. Blood samples were collected for up to 4 hours for biokinetic analysis. In a subset of 3 patients, premeal buccal <b>spray</b> <b>insulin</b> was administered for 2 entire consecutive days. In these patients, glucose levels were monitored using the glucose sensor monitoring system. RESULTS: Overall, there were no statistically significant differences in glucose, insulin, or C-peptide levels measured after administration of subcutaneous vs buccal <b>spray</b> <b>insulin.</b> However, at 90 and 120 minutes after subcutaneous regular insulin administration, significantly higher insulin levels and more prolonged hypoglycemic effect were detected compared with buccal <b>spray</b> <b>insulin</b> administration. In the 3 patients who received 1 day of regular and 2 entire days of buccal <b>spray</b> <b>insulin,</b> no significant differences were observed in glucose levels during the 3 days of glucose sensor monitoring. CONCLUSIONS: Insulin administered via the buccal spray formulation is as effective as the subcutaneous route in lowering blood glucose levels...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Insulin is an anorexigenic {{hormone that}} {{contributes}} to the termination of food intake in the postprandial state. An alteration in insulin action in the brain, named "cerebral insulin resistance", is responsible for overeating and the development of obesity. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To analyze the direct effect of insulin on food-related neuronal activity we tested 10 lean and 10 obese subjects. We conducted a magnetencephalography study during a visual working memory task in both the basal state and after applying <b>insulin</b> or placebo <b>spray</b> intranasally to bypass the blood brain barrier. Food and non-food pictures were presented and subjects had {{to determine whether or not}} two consecutive pictures belonged to the same category. Intranasal insulin displayed no effect on blood glucose, insulin or C-peptide concentrations in the periphery; however, it led to an increase in the components of evoked fields related to identification and categorization of pictures (at around 170 ms post stimuli in the visual ventral stream) in lean subjects when food pictures were presented. In contrast, insulin did not modulate food-related brain activity in obese subjects. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We demonstrated that intranasal insulin increases the cerebral processing of food pictures in lean whereas this was absent in obese subjects. This study further substantiates the presence of a "cerebral insulin resistance" in obese subjects and might be relevant in the pathogenesis of obesity...|$|R
30|$|In recent years, {{it can be}} {{seen that}} many {{scholars}} are interested in application in mathematical biology; many practical problems, such as injecting <b>insulin,</b> vaccination and <b>spraying</b> pesticides, need to be treated including state feedback control strategy [24 – 27]. The state feedback control is a threshold strategy which is used in impulsive semi-dynamic systems. The impulse starts to be effective when the abundance of a particular species reaches a certain threshold. The threshold strategy is widely used in the fields of ecology, life science and medicine. Therefore, it is crucial to describe and study impulsive differential equations; for instance, authors in the research articles [28 – 34] have formulated mathematical models in pest management to study the dynamic behavior. It is well known that in order to prevent the destruction by pests on some crops, it is required to spray pesticides in a timely manner; as a result, it could quickly destroy the important proportion of pest population also. In order to minimize the damage of using pesticides on the crops, cultivators adopt the biological control method to control or eradicate the pest from the crops. In this case, cultivators release natural enemies, the integrated impulse control to be implemented when a given threshold is reached. Integrated pest management is the most effective way to minimize the use of pesticides and to eliminate pests under the premise of ensuring food safety and maintaining ecological balance. In [31], Cheng et al. established a pest control model with Holling type-I functional response and studied its existence and attractiveness of order- 1 periodic solution. In [32], Tang et al. presented a semi-dynamic predator-prey model with Holling type-II functional response and studied the global stability of boundary order- 1 limit cycle. In [34], Zhang et al. considered a pest management model with nonlinear state impulsive control and Holling type-II functional response and focused their attention on geometric analysis. For further information, the readers are directed to read the references [35 – 37].|$|R
40|$|A major {{challenge}} in oral drug delivery {{is the development}} of novel dosage forms to promote absorption of poorly permeable Class III drugs across the intestinal epithelium. To date, no absorption promoter has been approved in a formulation specifically designed for oral delivery of Class III molecules. Promoters that are designated safe for human consumption have been licensed for use in a recently approved buccal <b>insulin</b> <b>spray</b> delivery system and also for many years as part of an ampicillin rectal suppository. Unlike buccal and rectal delivery, oral formulations containing absorption promoters have the additional technical hurdle whereby the promoter and payload must be co-released in high concentrations at the small intestinal epithelium in order to generate significant but rapidly reversible increases in permeability. The most advanced promoter in the clinic is the medium chain fatty acid (MCFA), sodium caprate (C 10), a compound already approved as a direct food additive. We discuss how it has evolved to a matrix tablet format suitable for administration to humans under the headings of mechanism of action at the cellular and tissue level and in vitro and in vivo efficacy and safety studies. In specific clinical examples, we review how C 10 -based formulations are being tested for oral delivery of bisphosphonates using Gastro Intestinal Permeation Enhancement Technology, GIPET (Merrion Pharmaceuticals, Ireland) and in a related solid dose format for anti-sense oligonucleotides (ISIS Pharmaceuticals, USA) ...|$|E
30|$|Recently {{diabetes}} mellitus has become epidemic and the incidence rate {{of this disease}} is rising rapidly. Though insulin administration is straightforward treatment of disease, the approach for insulin and other macromolecular diabetic therapies (glucagon-like peptide 1) is subcutaneous injection, which is painful and inconvenient, and leads to poor patient compliance. An innovative approach of oral <b>insulin</b> <b>spray</b> formulation has come up {{as an alternative to}} injectable insulin. The oral insulin is administered via buccal mucosal tract and is absorbed directly without any loss compared to the subcutaneous insulin injection. One of the major limitations of oral insulin delivery is low oral bioavailability of the hormone. Nanotechnology-based approach with the synthesis of polymeric nanoparticles and enteric coating has lessened the issue to some extent with limited success. It has been reported that nanosized negatively charged hydrophobic carrier for insulin has resulted in best oral absorption. β-Cyclodextrin and PLGA are considered as good candidates for coating material [235]. These polymers prevent degradation of insulin due to pH-dependent release in the gastrointestinal tract as well as self-aggregation of the hormone at neutral pH and provide stability to insulin [236]. AuNPs have been investigated as a good candidate for transmucosal insulin delivery. The biocompatible metal takes better control of blood glucose level in comparison to subcutaneous injection [237]. Another interesting approach is the fabrication of a nanocomposite membrane with glucose sensor which regulates the release of insulin. When the concentration of glucose is high, the pH level lowers down due to the oxidation of glucose to gluconic acid and this lowering of pH causes shrinkage of hydrogel membrane and releases insulin at faster rate [238].|$|E
