40|$|A {{properly}} designed, installed ao 1 d maintained {{septic tank}} system is an approved method of sewage treatment for private residences in rural or urban areas where public sewage treatment {{systems are not}} available. The components of a septic system are the <b>house</b> <b>sewer,</b> the septic tank and the absorption field, as illustrated in Figure 1. Sewage flows to the septic tank through the <b>house</b> <b>sewer.</b> In the septic tank, the solids are separated from the liquids, undergo anaerobic digestion and are stored as sludge {{at the bottom of}} the tank. The liquid (septic tank effluent) flows to the absorption field where it percolates into the soil. The soil acts as a final treatment by removing bacteria, pathogens and fine particles. All household wastes and normal amounts of cleaning materials, including soaps, detergents, bleaches, drain cleaners and other mild chemical preparations, can be tolerated by a septic system. Roof drains and foundation drains should not be connected to the septic tank system. These sources of clear water only overload the septic system and may cause premature failure of the absorption field. Septic Tank Location The site of a septic tank is usually determined by the location of major bathroom and kitchen plumbing within the home and by the slope of the land. Locate septic tanks at least 15 feet (4. 5 m) from the foundation walls and approximately straight out from the point where the <b>house</b> <b>sewer</b> pipe goes through the wall. Table 1 gives minimum distances between the septic tank system and water lines, property lines and surface water supplies. Locate the septic tank out of high traffic areas where excessive loads may damage the tank top. Keep clear of areas subject to flooding, ponding or surface drainage from surrounding areas. The location should be accessible to a driveway or other acceptable route so a tank truck can be driven close enough to pump out the sludge and clean the tank. Do not locate septic tanks under sidewalks or patios where the tank is inaccessible for pumping. Consider the possibility of future expansion and locations for additions, such as sidewalks, patios, garages and storage buildings, before selecting the tank site. Sizing and Septic Tank Construction The minimum septic tank size for any installation is 1, 000 gallons (3, 800 I). For more than 3 bedrooms, add an additional capacity of 250 gallons (950 I) per bedroom. Garbag 3 disposals add an extra load to the system, requiring about 25 percent additional tank capacity. Minimum tank capacities are listed in Table 2. Septic tanks must be watertight and constructed of sound and durable materials that are not subject to excessive corrosion, frost damage, cracking or buckling due to settlement or back filling. Common construction materials include concrete, fiberglass and steel. Minimum liquid depth of the tank should be 4 feet (1. 2 m). The inlet should not be less than 2 inches (5 cm) above the liquid level. Many septic tank shapes are satisfactory and the shape may depend on the type of material used. Figure 2 illustrates a typical septic tank with sanitary tees used as baffles on the septic tank inlet and outlet...|$|E

40|$|As hantaviroses são zoonoses de roedores silvestres que causam doenças humanas graves: febre hemorrágica com síndrome renal na Ásia e Europa, com letalidade de 10 a 12 % e no continente {{americano}} causam a Síndrome Pulmonar e Cardiovascular por Hantavirus (SPCVH), letalidade de 59 %. Os Hantavirus (família Bunyaviridae) são vírus envelopados que medem aproximadamente 120 nm, possuem RNA de fita simples e polaridade negativa, dividida em 3 segmentos (L, M e S) que se replicam no citoplasma. A infecção humana relaciona-se à inalação de aerossóis de excretas de roedores infectados com Hantavirus, embora existam relatos de transmissão interpessoal na América do Sul. No Estado de São Paulo, os roedores infectados mais encontrados foram o rato do rabo peludo (Bolomys lasiurus), o rato da mata (Akodon cursor) e o ratinho do arroz (Oligoryzomys negrips). Desde os 3 primeiros casos de hantavirose descritos no Brasil (1993) com indivíduos moradores da área rural de Juquitiba, SP, evidenciando o primeiro surto conhecido de SPCVH, mais de uma centena de casos da SPCVH foram notificados, causando 60 óbitos (letalidade de 46 %). Na região de Ribeirão Preto, ocorreram quatorze casos de SPCVH de 1998 a 2001, com letalidade de 64, 2 %, o que motivou este trabalho. Um primeiro objetivo deste trabalho foi estudar aspectos clínicos e epidemiológicos dos casos de hantavirose ocorridos na região de Ribeirão Preto, de 1998 a 2001, para conhecer o comportamento das hantaviroses nesta região. Analisando e acompanhando prontuários de 14 pacientes com SPCVH, observou-se febre (100 % dos casos), estertores pulmonares, dispnéia e tosse (64, 2 %), taquicardia acompanhada de hipotensão (64, 2 %), cefaléia e sintomas digestivos (57 %), adinamia e indisposição geral (50 %), fenômenos hemorrágicos (28, 5 %), mialgia (21, 4 %) e convulsão (7, 5 %). No perfil laboratorial, a plaquetopenia 55 %, (78, 6 %); leucocitose > 15000 /mm 3 (64, 2 %), neutrofilia > 7000 / mm 3 e bastonetes > 600 cels/mm 3 (64, 2 %), creatinina sérica > 1, 5 mg/ 100 ml (63, 6 %) e PO 2 55 %, (78, 6 %); leucocytosis > 15000 /mm 3 (64, 2 %), neutrofilia > 7000 / mm 3 {{and small}} sticks> 600 cels / mm 3 (64, 2 %), creatinine serical level > 1, 5 mg/ 100 ml (63, 6 %) and PO 2 < 70 mmHg (54, 5 %). The diagnosis laboratorial of the hantaviruses {{was made by}} ELISA for IgM and IgG anti Sin Nombre after the discharge. There was significant difference among fatal and surviving cases, as the hantaviruses diagnosis suspicious (p= 0, 0152) and parenteral hydratation (p= 0, 0152) : in the survivors, the HPCVS diagnosis suspicious was made between the 1 st and the 2 nd day of internment and the fatal cases, the suspicion was just made to the necropsies. Among infusion of liquid EV ³ over 2500 ml in the first 24 hours of treatment and evolution for the death. The precocious oxygen support, mechanics ventilation, {{as well as the}} use of vasoatives amines and the one of corticosteróides, did not have association with survival and the shock presence did not have association with death. The second objective was to antibodies for Hantavirus prevalence studies in the Area of Ribeirão Preto, in the population of Jardinópolis, SP. In the previous study among cities in that area it was obtained larger index of serologic prevalence (4, 5 %) for Hantavirus, it was in the Jardinópolis county Through ramdomised collection partly of the rural area and whole urban area, we obtained 818 samples of blood, inhabitants between 15 and 70 years, for digital puncture in filter paper and important data as age, gender, color, origin, professional activity, address, telephone; current disease, medications in use, pneumonia serious, dwelling type, number of inhabitants in the <b>house,</b> <b>sewer,</b> collects of garbage, barn, contact with rodents. These samples were processed, in the dilutions 1 / 50, 1 / 100, 1 / 400 and 1 / 1600. and submitted to indirect ELISA for detection of IgG for Hantavirus Los Andes. The results were analyzed by Fisher and Qui-square tests, using the InStat 3. 0 program (GraphPad. Software Inc, USA) and for the one of 5 %, with interval of trust of 95 %. The general positivity rated 14, 3 % with ELISA (at title 50), urban zone (15, 3 %) and in rural zone 6, 5 % and they demonstrated high rates for the population of the Jardinópolis county. Comparing the positivity rates for Hantavirus between urban and rural zone inhabitants was significantly larger for the urban inhabitants (p = 0, 0183). Significant increase was observed for the age group of 21 to 30 years (p = 0, 0117) and for the one of 31 to 40 years (p = 0, 0036) among different age groups.

[...] By political persuasion he was a Conservative, and in 1837 he joined the local Heart of Oak Club, {{the core of the}} Lancaster Conservative Association. He was elected a town councillor for Castle Ward in 1841, a post he held for ten years, and in 1843 was appointed the town council's representative on the local Police Commission. [...] He was also a visitor to the national schools, and in November 1848 he was elected as mayor for year, at that time a position more like that of a [...] "chief magistrate". Through these offices he became aware of the unsatisfactory state of sanitation in the town, and resolved to improve it. The town was overcrowded, it suffered from poor <b>housing,</b> open <b>sewers,</b> overflowing cesspits, and a very poor water supply, mainly from wells polluted by infiltration. [...] Many people suffered from typhus, and in 1848 there was an outbreak of cholera. The Police Commission had been established in Lancaster in 1825 with a wider role than suggested by its title, including [...] "cleansing, lighting and watching" [...] the town. However, there was constant friction between the Police Commission and the Town Council, the former tending to block any necessary reforms on the grounds of cost to the ratepayers. [...] The conflict was unresolved until the two bodies merged in 1849. The functions of the new body included the establishment of the first Lancaster Board of Health.|$|R
