This was a strategic decision in order to shield the vulnerable flanks of the outnumbered Muslim army; the archers on the hill were to protect the left flank, while the right flank was to be protected by the Mount of Uhud situated {{on the east side of}} the Muslim camp. Protecting the flanks of the Muslim army meant that the Meccan army would not be able to turn around the Muslim camp, and thus the Muslim army wouldn't be surrounded or encircled by the Meccan cavalry, <b>keeping</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> that the Meccan cavalry outnumbered the Muslim cavalry with a 50:1 ratio.|$|E

25|$|Until 1993, {{there was}} no formal {{training}} in place for Indiana reserve police officers. Local Sheriffs and/or chiefs of police could appoint a person with no training as a reserve with full police authority. In 1993, the Indiana Law Enforcement Academy (ILEA) created a condensed version of the basic police academy for reserves. <b>Keeping</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> that reserves often have other full-time employment, it would be nearly impossible for a reserve officer to attend the regular 15-week live-in basic training. Therefore, ILEA created a 40-hour pre-basic course, including physical tactics, pepper spray exposure, Emergency Vehicle Operations, and a heavy emphasis on criminal law. Any officer appointed must now complete (and pass) this training {{in order to have}} statewide arrest authority, on and off duty (IC 5-2-1-9(f)). Most departments now include many hours of additional training, such as ECW (Taser) training, and a lengthy field training program with a veteran officer.|$|E
