500|$|Acting {{gradually}} became {{a passion for}} Hoffman: [...] "I loved the camaraderie of it, the people, and that's when I decided <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> wanted to do." [...] At the age of 17, he was selected to attend the 1984 New York State Summer School of the Arts in Saratoga Springs, where he met his future collaborators Bennett Miller and Dan Futterman. Miller later commented on Hoffman's popularity at the time: [...] "We were attracted {{to the fact that}} he was genuinely serious about what he was doing. Even then, he was passionate." [...] Hoffman applied for several drama degree programs and was accepted to New York University's (NYU) Tisch School of the Arts. Between starting on the program and graduating from Fairport High School, he continued his training at the Circle in the Square Theatre's summer program. Hoffman had positive memories of his time at NYU, where he supported himself by working as an usher. With friends, he co-founded the Bullstoi Ensemble acting troupe. He received a drama degree in 1989.|$|E
500|$|Hebel {{lived in}} Karlsruhe until his death, but made {{occasional}} journeys to other regions. His wish {{to become a}} parish priest in Wiesental was never fulfilled, though he wrote an inaugural sermon for a rural parish in 1820. In this sermon he wrote, [...] "to live and die as a pastor in a peaceful country town, among honest people, has always been my sole wish, up to this hour; <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> wished for in the happiest and in the darkest moments of my life". Instead, he was [...] "led higher and higher by an invisible hand, ever further away from my modest goals". In 1805 he was offered the Lutheran parish of Freiburg im Breisgau, but he declined it {{at the behest of}} Charles Frederick, Grand Duke of Baden. He was rewarded in 1808 with his appointment as director of the Gymnasium in Karlsruhe. In 1819 he became a prelate of the Lutheran regional church, a leading position that brought with it a seat in the Upper House of the Parliament (St√§ndeversammlung) of Baden. As a member of parliament he devoted himself mainly to education, the church and social policy. He later gave a speech at the consecration of the statehouse in Karlsruhe. Even though the Lutheran and Reformed regional churches of Baden merged in 1821 with strong support from his side, into today's Evangelische Landeskirche in Baden, his position as the prelate of the unified Protestant church was not endangered.|$|E
2500|$|As for the French Impressionists, {{he wrote}} [...] "Even Claude Monet, Sisley, Pissarro {{and the school}} of extreme Impressionists do {{some things that are}} charming and that will live." [...] Hassam was later called an [...] "extreme Impressionist". His closest contact with a French Impressionist artist {{occurred}} when Hassam took over Renoir's former studio and found some of the painter's oil sketches left behind. [...] "I did not know anything about Renoir or care anything about Renoir. I looked at these experiments in pure color and saw <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> was trying to do myself." ...|$|E
60|$|LADY BRITOMART. Yes. [To Stephen] <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> {{told you}} last night, Stephen.|$|R
60|$|A.--But I desire you {{to excuse}} me, for <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> never do--I cannot do it.|$|R
60|$|DUVALLET. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> thought. These English {{domestic}} interiors {{are very}} interesting. [He goes out, followed by Juggins].|$|R
2500|$|After the game, Sir Alex Ferguson {{paid tribute}} to the {{spectacle}} of the event, saying, [...] "It was fantastic. All the players were relaxed and it's amazing when you play without pressure, they can enjoy themselves so much. For everyone who attended the game, {{it was a really}} good night. It was good that there were so many young people here. Ticket prices were good for young people and it was good to see some really good football also." [...] Marcello Lippi was equally effusive about the performances on show: [...] "It {{was meant to be a}} celebration and <b>it</b> <b>was.</b> <b>What</b> <b>I</b> saw on the pitch was a good performance and a good show for the fans. I thank all those players that came because some came at the last minute and were quite keen to play in this celebration match." ...|$|E
2500|$|So Jason Clarke is my {{public defender}} {{at the time}} and he's warning me. He's saying, [...] "Lindsey don't take drug court. I'm telling you, you won't make it." [...] He's told me this like three or four times. I'm adamant. I'm saying, [...] "I'm taking drug court." [...] Because all I know is I get to get out of jail. It's all I know. I don't know {{anything}} else about it. So I go to plead into drug court. My dad's in the court room. Judge Barton was on the bench that day instead of Judge Williams. She was gone. My dad's done Judge Barton's accounting for probably the past 15 years and they're very good friends. So (Judge Barton) sees me come in and he pulls me up to the bench and he's like, [...] "Don't do this. Don't take drug court. Are {{you sure you want to}} do this?" [...] He asked me three or four times. Judge Barton's trying to talk me out of taking drug court. That I would not do well. I wouldn't make it. He didn't think <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> should do.|$|E
60|$|I {{know not}} whether <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> said {{that made him}} stare, or how I said it.|$|E
60|$|I now devote you to God {{forever and}} ever; <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> desire {{for you from}} the very depth of my heart.|$|R
60|$|BENNET. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{preparing}} {{myself to}} be. Of course, {{if you think}} them inadvisable, I can take them down again.|$|R
6000|$|Lord Henry smiled. [...] "People {{are very}} fond of giving away what they need most themselves. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> call the depth of generosity." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{since you}} ask me, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> hoped. But since you answer for it that my hope {{has not been}} met, I bow to a {{superior}} propriety." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, sir, yes," [...] said Marner, meditatively. [...] "I should ha' {{been bad}} off without my work: <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> held by when {{everything}} else was gone from me." ...|$|E
60|$|Well, to be plain, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> was {{thinking}} myself; for {{the report of}} a pistol would have been, under Providence, the means of hanging the pair of us.|$|E
6000|$|... "In plain dealing, sir knight, though <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> seldom use," [...] {{answered}} the leech, [...] "my road to revenge {{is the same}} with yours." ...|$|R
6000|$|Her hands clenched. [...] "Yes," [...] she said, very faintly. And then: [...] "Of course! Always. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> have wanted, <b>what</b> <b>I</b> {{have meant}} all along." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That," [...] Mr. Sabin said, [...] "is <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{desirous of}} knowing. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> trust that you, my dear Felix, may assist me to discover." ...|$|R
60|$|At {{the end of}} a week I got {{an answer}} to my letter. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> wanted. I wrote again and sent a parcel. In three weeks' time the storm burst.|$|E
60|$|As <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> {{expressly}} desired {{should be}} done, after yesterday's prayer, I more than readily {{begged him to}} read it aloud. He did so; and Brother Gimblet listened with a crabbed smile.|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{decision}} does you honour. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> {{had hoped}} from you. Go now, Marcel. I doubt me you are eager. When your love-sickness wanes a little we shall {{hope to see}} you at Court again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> really. I am not pretending {{anything}}. I {{shall never}} be anything else," [...] said Mirah. [...] "I always feel myself a Jewess." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think my}} stiff neck, aunt, {{as you call}} <b>it,</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> have chiefly to depend upon,--I mean in {{reference}} to other advice than mamma's. Good-bye, aunt." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> should {{insist on}} doing myself. I could not {{stay in his}} house under other circumstances. But you too must promise me one thing, Emily." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'A full day's journey,' {{answered}} Pere Colombeau, and added, 'I {{am sorry}} you are indeed a Huguenot. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> feared last night, but I feared {{to add to}} your grief. The nuns {{are not permitted to}} deliver up children to Huguenot relations.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{made the}} {{purchase}} this morning, bright and early, {{before you were}} up," [...] replied Mr. Merrick, smilingly. [...] "It is a fine new car, {{and as soon as}} I saw it I knew <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> wanted. It is now being fitted up for our use." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he said, {{speaking}} {{slowly in}} a tense voice, [...] "ever since I first saw you I longed {{that this should}} come about. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> worked for, and nothing {{would have been too}} hard that brought me nearer you, but it's almost a cruelty that I should have succeeded--now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! {{you always}} see difficulties. I see none. The King is with us, the country <b>is</b> disgusted. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> always said would be; the {{reaction}} is complete." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Your ball at Avoncester. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{staying on}} for! Major McDonald all but promised me one; {{and you know}} you must give one before you leave this place." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's extraordinary," [...] replied Chiltern, slowly, [...] "that {{you should}} say this to me. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> have come to believe, but I couldn't have said it half so well." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So I had--two things--one in particular. But you wouldn't {{promise to}} keep it a secret. I'll tell you now if you promise? As an honest woman I wish you to know it... <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> began telling you in the night--about that gentleman who managed the Sydney hotel." [...] Arabella spoke {{somewhat}} hurriedly for her. [...] "You'll keep it close?" ...|$|E
60|$|If, at that time, I {{had been}} much with her, I should, in the {{weakness}} of my desolation, have betrayed this. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> remotely dreaded when I was first impelled {{to stay away from}} England. I could not have borne to lose the smallest portion of her sisterly affection; yet, in that betrayal, I should have set a constraint between us hitherto unknown.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, mamma," [...] said Rachel, {{returning}} to the room {{as soon as she}} heard the wheels of the fly in motion upon the road across the green. She found her mother in tears,--hardly able to speak because of her sobs. [...] "Never mind it, mamma: of course I know the kind of things they have been saying. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> expected. Never mind it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I've {{told you}} what {{happened}} because the facts came out in court and are known to everyone. <b>What</b> <b>I</b> think about <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> think, and I've no call to tell that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh!" [...] said Janet, [...] "poor old Maria has forestalled me. Yes, mother, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> {{meant to}} tell you, only I {{thought you could}} not bear a fresh shock last night." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This is {{not going}} to be his duty, if I can make <b>it</b> otherwise. <b>What</b> <b>is</b> the meaning of all this? No, I need not ask, poor boy, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> afraid of!" ...|$|R
