The enclosure also included preset cross-overs and equalization.

5000|$|The {{signal to}} be {{measured}} is fed {{to one of the}} <b>input</b> <b>connectors,</b> which is usually a coaxial connector such as a BNC or UHF type. Binding posts or banana plugs may be used for lower frequencies.If the signal source has its own coaxial connector, then a simple coaxial cable is used; otherwise, a specialized cable called a [...] "scope probe", supplied with the oscilloscope, is used. In general, for routine use, an open wire test lead for connecting to the point being observed is not satisfactory, and a probe is generally necessary.General-purpose oscilloscopes usually present an input impedance of 1 megohm in parallel with a small but known capacitance such as 20 picofarads. This allows the use of standard oscilloscope probes. Scopes for use with very high frequencies may have 50‑ohm inputs, which must be either connected directly to a 50‑ohm signal source or used with Z0 or active probes.|$|E
50|$|The {{majority}} of today's lock-in amplifiers {{are based on}} high-performance digital signal processing (DSP). Over the last 20 years, digital lock-in amplifiers have been replacing analog models across the entire frequency range, allowing users to perform measurements up to a frequency of 600 MHz. Initial problems of the first digital lock-in amplifiers, e.g. the presence of digital clock noise on the <b>input</b> <b>connectors,</b> could be completely eliminated by use of improved electronic components and better instrument design. Today's digital lock-in amplifiers outperform analog models in all relevant performance parameters, such as frequency range, input noise, stability and dynamic reserve. In addition to better performance, digital lock-in amplifiers can include multiple demodulators, which allows analyzing a signal with different filter settings or at multiple different frequencies simultaneously. Moreover, experimental data can be analyzed with additional tools such as an oscilloscope, FFT spectrum analyzers, boxcar averager or used to provide feedback by using internal PID controllers. Some models of the digital lock-in amplifiers are computer-controlled and feature a graphical user interface (can be a platform-independent browser user interface) and a choice of programming interfaces.|$|E

Either pin 2 or 3 was live, depending on the manufacturer, with pin 1 always the 'earthy' return. This usage is now both obsolete and dangerous to equipment but is still sometimes encountered, especially on older equipment.

40|$|We analyze noise {{properties}} of time series of frequency data from different counting modes of a Keysight 53230 A frequency counter. We use a 10 MHz reference signal from a passive hydrogen maser connected via phase-stable Huber+Suhner Sucoflex 104 cables to the reference and <b>input</b> <b>connectors</b> of the counter. We {{find that the}} high resolution gap-free (CONT) frequency counting process imposes long-term correlations in the output data, resulting in a modified Allan deviation that is characteristic of random walk phase noise. Equally important, the CONT mode results in a frequency bias. In contrast, the counter's undocumented raw continuous mode (RCON) yields unbiased frequency stability estimates with white phase noise characteristics, and of a magnitude consistent with the counter's 20 ps single-shot resolution. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a 100 -point running average filter {{in conjunction with the}} RCON mode yields resolution enhanced frequency estimates with flicker phase noise characteristics. For instance, the counter's built-in moving-average function can be used. The improved noise characteristics of the averaged RCON mode versus the CONT mode imply that the former mode yields frequency estimates with improved confidence for a given measurement time.

The differentiated signal is discriminated for time measurement and sent {{to one of the}} four TMC 304 inputs. The 4 -channel TMC 304 chip allows high precision time measurement of rising and falling edges with {approx} 100 ps resolution and has internal digital pipeline. The ADC data is also pipelined which allows deadtime-less operation with trigger decision times of {approx} 4 {micro}s. The wire chamber module was developed for MIPP EMCal detector charge measurements. The 32 -channel digitizer accepts differential analog signals from four 8 -channel integrating wire amplifiers.

To avoid relying on this assumption, three oscilloscopes can be used. The "nose-to-nose" is then applied three times, with a different pair of scopes connected together each time.

40|$|TDC) {{electronics}} {{based on}} the HPTDC [1] with on-board DAQ functionality has been developed. The main usage will be the RPC-detector upgrade of the HADES-detector (2600 channels) with a needed time resolution of < 100 ps and the required possibility to measure {{the time of the}} rising and falling edge of the signal to make a Time-over-Threshold (TOT) measurement for a walk-correction of the RPC-detector. Additionally, it will be used for the Forward-Wall and Pion-Hodoscope upgrades (640 channels). The readout-electronics is on board and the data is transported via 100 MBit Ethernet and Internet-Protocol. The Time to Digital Conversion of the 128 channels is done in 4 HPTDC chips (as shown in Fig. 1). The Figure 1 : TDC Readout Board block diagram. TDC-Readout-Board (TRB) has 4 <b>input</b> <b>connectors</b> (80 pins, high density), where each has 31 LVDS timing input signals and several I/O-signals for general purpose. The 32 nd channel of each HPTC is connected to an external reference timing signal (LVDS). The HPTDC ASICs are highly confi gurable [1] and allow to choose the TDC binwidth in the range of 780 ps and 25 ps (at 25 ps one only has 1 / 4 of the channels available), detect rising and falling edge of the timing-signal and allow to defi ne a matchingwindow, so that delay cables are not necessary anymore. An external trigger signal starts the selection of data in the HPTDCs and the board-controller FPGA initiates the readout. This data is then fi rst stored in a FIFO (128 kB) where it is waiting for an external LVL 2 trigger decision, which decides if the data can be discarded or has to be transported to mass storage (the LVL 2 trigger is needed for the HADES DAQ but optional).

40|$|Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) are {{control devices}} used in {{industry}} to control, operate and monitor plants, machines and robots. PLCs comprise <b>input</b> <b>connectors,</b> typically connected to sensors, output connectors, typically connected to actuators, and a program, which controls the behavior, computing new output values based on the input values and an internal state. Since PLCs operate in safety-critical environments, where a malfunction could seriously harm the environment, humans, or the plant, it is recommended to verify their programs using formal methods. This dissertation studies the formal methods model checking and static analysis to prove the correctness of PLC programs. For this, we developed the tool Arcade. PLC, which allow the automatic application of these methods to PLC programs written for different vendors. It extracts a model from the program by abstract simulation, which over-approximates the possible program behavior. The user is then able to verify whether the model obeys a specification, which can be written in the logic CTL or using automata. For applying model checking, we demonstrate how the model can be extracted automatically, such that the approach scales to industrial size programs. For this, we introduce two different abstraction techniques: First, we develop an abstraction refinement guided by the model checker that automatically creates an abstracted model by iteratively analyzing counterexamples. Second, we implemented a predicate abstraction that evaluates a formalized program semantics using an SMT solver. Both techniques are evaluated using different programs from industry and academia. Further, we introduce a simplified formalism to write specifications, which is influenced by an automata-based language established in industry. We implement an algorithm to check programs using this formalism and show that this technique is even able to detect errors in the specification. Finally, we detail how counterexamples generated by the model checker can be analyzed automatically to locate the actual erroneous line in the program. The static analysis we developed is able to detect program errors in a fully automatic way. We detect typical errors such as division by zero and illegal array accesses, but also PLC specific errors, e. g., during a restart. The analysis {{is based on a}} value-set analysis, which determines the values of all program variables in each program location.

50|$|A {{pass-through}} connector is {{a second}} jack, sometimes simply paralleled to the <b>input</b> <b>connector,</b> that delivers the input signal unchanged, to allow the DI unit to be inserted into a signal path without interrupting it. This allows a user, such as an electric bass player, to plug their bass into a DI unit, which routes the bass signal to the mixing board, {{and at the same}} time plug the bass into an onstage bass amp for monitoring purposes. Pass-through is also commonly referred to as a bypass. True-bypass occurs when the signal goes straight from the input jack to the output jack with no circuitry involved and no loading of the source impedance. False bypass (or simply 'bypass') occurs when the signal is routed through the device circuitry with buffering and no other intentional change to the signal. However, due to the nature of electrical designs there is almost always some slight change in the signal. The extent of change and how noticeable it may be can vary from unit to unit.|$|R
