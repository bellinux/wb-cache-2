30|$|The {{hypothesis}} of this multicentre {{study is that}} a dose management system, with {{a large amount of}} data collection, will demonstrate significant variation in <b>dose</b> <b>levels</b> for similar adult CT examinations performed in different institutions in a comparable region of Europe. Using a dose-tracking system also showed that in one hospital CT <b>dose</b> <b>levels</b> were modified to levels below the national DRLs and that it is easy to compare and align CT <b>dose</b> <b>levels</b> between scanners within one hospital. The resulting inter-hospital benchmarking will change the used protocol parameters and CT <b>dose</b> <b>levels</b> and could eventually influence the regional and national DRLs.|$|R

5000|$|This {{disorder}} is regarded by many medical professionals to comprise {{the most severe}} form of chronic pain known in medical practice.

50|$|The {{importance}} {{of determining the}} therapeutic range of a drug cannot be overstated. This is generally defined by the range between the minimum effective dose (MED) and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). The MED {{is defined as the}} lowest <b>dose</b> <b>level</b> of a pharmaceutical product that provides a clinically significant response in average efficacy, which is also statistically significantly superior to the response provided by the placebo. Similarly, the MTD is the highest possible but still tolerable <b>dose</b> <b>level</b> with respect to a pre-specified clinical limiting toxicity. In general, these limits refer to the average patient population. For instances {{in which there is a}} large discrepancy between the MED and MTD, it is stated that the drug has a large therapeutic window. Conversely, if the range is relatively small, or if the MTD is less than the MED, then the pharmaceutical product will have little to no practical value.|$|E

50|$|The Fixed Dose Procedure (FDP), {{proposed}} in 1984 by the British Toxicology Society, {{is a method}} to assess a substance's acute oral toxicity. In this procedure the test substance is given {{at one of the}} four fixed-dose levels (5, 50, 500, and2000 mg/kg) to five male and five female rats. The objective is to identify a dose that produces clear signs of toxicity but no mortality (22). Depending on the results of the first test, either no further testing is needed or a higher or lower dose is tested: If mortality occurs, retesting at a lower <b>dose</b> <b>level</b> is necessary (except if the original dose chosen is 5 mg/kg). If no signs of toxicity occur at the initial dose, it is necessary to retest at a higher <b>dose</b> <b>level.</b> The results are thus interpreted in relation to animal survival and evident toxicity (5) and it becomes possible to assign the chemical to one of the OECD classification categories.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} an experimental approach {{to evaluate the}} effective doses of space radiations at high-altitude by combining the measured data from the Liulin- 6 K spectrometer loaded onto the air-borne RC- 800 cockpit and the calculated data from CARI- 6 M code developed by FAA. In this paper, 15 exposed dose experiments for the flight missions at a highaltitude above 10 km and 3 experiments at a normal altitude below 4 km were executed over the Korean Peninsula in 2012. The results from the high-altitude flight measurements show {{a dramatic change in}} the exposed doses as the altitude increases. The effective <b>dose</b> <b>levels</b> (an average of 15. 27 μSv) of aircrew at the high-altitude are an order of magnitude larger than those (an average of 0. 30 μSv) of the normal altitude flight. The comparison was made between the measure <b>dose</b> <b>levels</b> and the calculated <b>dose</b> <b>levels</b> and those were similar each other. It indicates that the annual <b>dose</b> <b>levels</b> of the aircrew boarding RC- 800 could be above 1 mSv.
