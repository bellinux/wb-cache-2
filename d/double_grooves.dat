25|$|It is the {{existence}} of these fine <b>double</b> <b>grooves</b> on the gold lamella which provides the key for identifying MS5236 as being stamped and not written. Because {{it is a matter of}} mechanical necessity that the engraved letters appear with their raised double edges on the substrate as parallel, sunken lines when being printed, as can be observed on the amulet. Thus, the inscription is a bas-relief, which was produced by a bas-relief stamp. If the text had been carved directly into the foil as with other amulets, the stylus could have left only simple lines. According to Brekle, the applied printing technique has much in common with the later method of drypoint etching, by which an image is incised into a copper plate; however, unlike drypoint, MS5236 is a colourless blind print.|$|E
5000|$|At the Olympic Games, the stadion (building) was {{big enough}} for 20 competitors, and the race was a 200 yd sprint, [...] but the {{original}} stadion track in Olympia measures approximately 210 yd. The race began with a trumpet blow, with officials (the agonothetai - ἀγωνοθέται) at the starting blocks {{to make sure there}} were no false starts. There were also officials at the end to decide on a winner and {{to make sure no one}} had cheated. If the officials decided there was a tie, the race would be re-run. Runners started the race from a standing position, probably with their arms stretched out in front of them, instead of starting in a crouch like modern runners. They ran naked on a packed earth track. By the fifth century, the track was marked by a stone-starting line, the balbis. Advancements in this stone starting block led to it having a set of <b>double</b> <b>grooves</b> (10 - 12 cm apart) in which the runner placed his toes. The design of these grooves were intended to give the runner leverage for his start.|$|E
30|$|For LBPS/CYCo systems, double grooved fibers can be {{validated}} by the cross section (Fig.  7 d–f), {{and the interior}} structure tended {{to be similar to}} single CYCo systems (Fig.  7 [*]h). The <b>double</b> <b>grooves</b> produced in the presence of CYCo should be attributed to the formation of glassy skin, subsequent collapse of the jet, and then the elongation into double grooved fibers (Fig.  6 c, mechanism III). In these cases, LBPS played an important role to form a glassy skin due to their fast evaporation, while CYCo was another key factor due to its rather slow evaporation rate and high viscosity, which caused the collapse of the polymer jet. For the DMF/CYCo system, even though grooved fibers were obtained when the solvent ratio was equal to or less than 1 : 1, the grooved texture was not well organized, which can be confirmed by the cross section (Fig.  7 [*]g). Obviously, the DER between DMF and CYCo is quite small (DBP, 2.65  °C), so this kind of glassy skin was formed later, leaving insufficient time to be elongated into well-aligned grooved texture before reaching the collector.|$|E

40|$|Easter eggs’ {{are hidden}} {{components}} {{that can be}} found in computer software and various other media including music. In this paper the concept is explained, and various examples are discussed from a variety of mediums including analogue and digital audio formats. Through this discussion, the purpose of including easter eggs in musical mediums is considered. We propose that easter eggs can serve to provide comic amusement within a work, but can also serve to support the artistic message of the artwork. Concealing easter eggs in music is partly dependent on the properties of the chosen medium; vinyl records may use techniques such as <b>double</b> <b>grooves,</b> while digital formats such as CD may feature hidden tracks that follow long periods of empty space. Approaches such as these and others are discussed. Lastly, we discuss some software components we have developed ourselves in Max/MSP, which facilitate the production of easter eggs by performing certain sequences of notes, or as a result of time-based events. We therefore argue that computer music performances present unique opportunities for the incorporation of easter eggs. These may occur to the surprise of audiences, performers and composers, and may support the artistic purpose of compositions as a whole...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND/AIMS: In {{the animal}} model of {{auxiliary}} partial liver transplantation in the rat, {{the major problem}} is high outflow pressure since the direction of vascular outflow of the graft was perpendicular {{to that of the}} recipient inferior vena cava (IVC) and the anastomosis was far away from the right atrium. We aimed at developing an animal model that could prevent graft congestion. METHODOLOGY: The graft contained the right lateral lobe and triangulated lobe of rat's liver. The modification of implantation included anatomizing an oblique cuff of IVC of donor graft into the recipient's IVC so that the size of anastomosis was large with an angle of 45 °and the resulting vascular outflow was no longer perpendicular to that of the recipient's IVC, and the creation of <b>double</b> <b>grooves</b> on the cuff body of the donor portal vein. Bile drainage was completed by inserting the bile duct (together with a stent) into the recipient's duodenum. RESULTS: Congestion of grafts was not seen in 25 rats undergoing auxiliary partial liver transplantation using an oblique IVC graft. The 1 -week and 2 -week survival rates were 88 % and 80 %, respectively. In the group of rats (n = 10) operated on by using a straight IVC graft, graft congestion was seen and only 1 rat could survive over 1 day. CONCLUSIONS: Modification of vascular outflow anastomosis prevented graft congestion and improved animal survival. The model may be useful for studying liver regeneration, transplantation immunology, and gene transfer. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

5000|$|Since {{the record}} had two {{concentric}} grooves, they were spaced considerably apart, halving {{the length of}} the playing time.

30|$|More interestingly, NS/(LBPS and HBPS) systems also {{produced}} {{different types of}} grooved texture (Fig.  5). For BuOH/DCM, the electrospinning process was highly unstable and often interrupted by severe needle clogging. However, the 1 : 1 solvent ratio produced <b>double</b> <b>grooved</b> fibers with surface pores and beads, while 1 : 2 resulted in grooved fibers and 1 : 3 led to a wrinkled surface. In this case, the grooved and wrinkled morphologies are both caused by buckling instability under different driving forces. In other words, grooved texture will be formed when the driving force is sufficient, and a lower driving force resulted in wrinkled texture. BuOH/THF {{also produced}} grooved fibers. The 1 : 1 solvent ratio resulted in fibers with small grooves on the surface, and a lower solvent ratio led to more distinct grooved texture. BuOH/DMF contributed to fibers with rough surface. BuOH/CYCo produced <b>double</b> <b>grooved</b> fibers when the ratio is 1 : 1, whereas a lower ratio resulted in beaded fibers.|$|R
40|$|AbstractUsing dynamic {{caustics}} blast loading system, {{the paper}} studied the dynamic behavior of perforated crack propagation {{on the condition}} of different grooving with two borehole blasting and simultaneous initiation. Two kinds of grooving modes were designed: (a) and (b). (a) : A-hole <b>double</b> <b>grooving,</b> B-hole single grooving. (b) : A-hole <b>double</b> <b>grooving,</b> B-hole no grooving. As {{can be seen from the}} result, stress intensity factor decreased rapidly from the maximum, oscillated, and up to the second peak, then decreased until crack arrested. KI was almost greater than KII. The velocity and acceleration showed a type of fluctuation changes as wave. Acceleration firstly came to the peak, then the velocity came to the peak again, and the process repeated many times. The energy release rate decreased rapidly, oscillated, and then decreased. It remained the same with the variation of the stress intensity factor. Dynamic energy release rate and the dynamic stress intensity factor had the same sense of dynamic fracture mechanics...|$|R
40|$|Electromagnetic pulse {{crimping}} of {{form fit}} joints was investigated using tubes in the aluminium alloy EN AW- 6060, with {{a diameter of}} 50 mm and a wall thickness of 1, 5 mm. First {{the influence of the}} charging voltage and the geometrical groove parameters on the deformation behaviour and localised thickness reduction of the tube wall was investigated. The experimental results provided data for optimising the groove design. The Design of Experiments method was used to optimise the shape and dimensions of the internal workpieces with a <b>double</b> <b>groove</b> design. Results of tensile tests on the crimp joints allowed determining the most important parameters for the groove design. Based on these observations an optimal <b>double</b> <b>groove</b> joint design was proposed. The deformation and failure behaviour of the crimp joints during tensile testing were experimentally studied using the digital image correlation technique. This technique was used to measure the local and global deformation of the joint. Failure mechanisms include pull-out, local shearing and fracture of the tube. Three main failure modes were observed...|$|R
30|$|We have {{demonstrated}} the feasibility to directly electrospin grooved PS fibers by systematically investigating both single and binary solvent systems at given parameters. We found that single solvent systems produced non-grooved fibers. LBPS/DMF solvent systems generated fibers with different grooved textures, while LBPS/CYCo led to fibers with <b>double</b> <b>grooved</b> texture. Grooved fibers can also be fabricated from LBPS/LBPS, NS/LBPS, and NS/HBPS systems under specific conditions. The results indicated that grooved fibers can be fabricated from binary solvent systems {{as long as the}} DER is high enough. The formation of grooved texture should be attributed to three mechanisms, namely void-based elongation, wrinkle-based elongation, and collapsed jet-based elongation.|$|R
5000|$|English {{rock band}} Marillion's 1994 concept album Brave {{is one of}} the very few {{examples}} of an alternative ending appearing in the medium of music.

30|$|For BuOH/(LBPS and HBPS) systems, large pores can {{be found}} in the {{interior}} structure (Fig.  7 i–l). The higher DER of BuOH/DCM (DBP, 77.95  °C) and BuOH/THF (DBP, 51.7  °C) and the formation of interior pores contributed to the formation of grooved texture (Fig.  5 a, b, e, f), which should be ascribed to mechanism II, while BuOH/DMF led to fibers with rough surface because of the insufficient DER (DBP, 35.5  °C). However, BuOH/CYCo (solvent ratio, 1 : 1) produced <b>double</b> <b>grooved</b> fibers, which should be attributed to mechanism III. Although the theoretical DBP is only 37.95  °C, the rather slow evaporation rate of CYCo made the actual DER much larger.|$|R

30|$|Secondary {{surface texture}} {{is of great}} {{significance}} to morphological variety and further expands the application areas of electrospun nanofibers. This paper presents the possibility of directly electrospinning grooved polystyrene (PS) fibers using both single and binary solvent systems. Solvents were classified as low boiling point solvent (LBPS): dichloromethane (DCM), acetone (ACE), and tetrahydrofuran (THF); high boiling point solvent (HBPS): N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and cyclohexanone (CYCo); and non-solvent (NS): 1 -butanol (BuOH). By the systematic selection and combination of these solvents at given parameters, we found that single solvent systems produced non-grooved fibers. LBPS/DMF solvent systems resulted in fibers with different grooved textures, while LBPS/CYCo led to fibers with <b>double</b> <b>grooved</b> texture. Grooved fibers can also be fabricated from LBPS/LBPS, NS/LBPS, and NS/HBPS systems under specific conditions. The {{results indicated that the}} difference of evaporation rate (DER) between the two solvents {{played a key role in}} the formation of grooved texture. The formation of this unique texture should be attributed to three separate mechanisms, namely void-based elongation, wrinkle-based elongation, and collapsed jet-based elongation. Our findings can serve as guidelines for the preparation of ultrafine fibers with grooved secondary texture.|$|R

40|$|General: The Sandberg {{bluegrass}} {{complex is}} composed of cool-season (with some summer active ecotypes) perennial bunchgrasses that mature early in the growing season. This grass {{is one of the}} first to green up in the spring, but is cured and dormant by early summer. The plant usually occurs as small tufts, with soft basal leaves and few to many flowering stalks that are naked except for one or two small leaves. The leaves have the typical bluegrass characteristics of prow-shaped tip and <b>double</b> <b>groove</b> down the center of the leaf surface. Sandberg bluegrass has a prominent membranaceous, acute ligule. The seeds are glabrous except for short crisp hairs on the lower portion of the lemmas. The flowers are in narrow panicles that are somewhat spreading during anthesis. Plants seldom exceed 60 cm (24 in) in height. Plants of the Sandberg bluegrass complex have extensive, deep penetrating, coarse, fibrous roots that make them quite drought tolerant and resistant to grazing and trampling. Species within the complex have approximately 2, 000, 000 seeds per kilogram (925, 000 seeds per pound). Distribution: Plants occur throughout Western North America with disjunct populations in Quebec and Chile. For current distribution, consult the Plant Profile page for this species on the PLANTS Web site...|$|R
