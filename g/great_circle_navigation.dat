5000|$|Previous {{versions}} did {{not allow}} <b>great</b> <b>circle</b> <b>navigation</b> at latitudes higher than 60 degrees (North or South), and at around 75-80 degrees North/South it became impossible to [...] "fly" [...] closer to the poles, whichever compass heading was followed. This problem is solved in FSX. Users may now navigate through any great circle as well as [...] "fly" [...] across both Arctic and Antarctic. This version also adds the option to have a transparent panel.|$|E
40|$|The present {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the solution of a series of practical problems relevant to <b>great</b> <b>circle</b> <b>navigation,</b> including the determination of the true course at any point on the great circle route and the determination of the lateral deviation from a desired great circle route. Intersection between two great circles or between a great circle and a parallel is also analyzed. These problems are approached by means of vector analysis, which yields solutions in a very compact form that can be computed numerically in a very straightforward manner. This approach is thus particularly appealing for performing computer-aided <b>great</b> <b>circle</b> <b>navigation...</b>|$|E

Various earlier theoretical analyses were confirmed, and insight was gained into {{the sensitivity of}} fuel conservation strategies to nonlinear and second order aerodynamic and engine characteristics.

50|$|For most {{pairs of}} {{points on the}} surface of a sphere, there is a unique <b>great</b> <b>circle</b> through the two points. The {{exception}} is a pair of antipodal points, for which there are infinitely many <b>great</b> <b>circles.</b> The minor arc of a <b>great</b> <b>circle</b> between two points is the shortest surface-path between them. In this sense, the minor arc is analogous to “straight lines” in Euclidean geometry. The length of the minor arc of a <b>great</b> <b>circle</b> is taken as the distance between two points on a surface of a sphere in Riemannian geometry where such <b>great</b> <b>circles</b> are called Riemannian <b>circles.</b> These <b>great</b> <b>circles</b> are the geodesics of the sphere.|$|R
40|$|This report {{presents}} two <b>great</b> <b>circle</b> <b>navigation</b> algorithms, a closest {{point of}} approach algorithm and intercept algorithm. It also presents an implementation {{program for the}} algorithms that is written in the BASIC language for an IBM PC. Instead of using classical spherical geometry or the general spherical triangle, these algorithms incorporate rectangular coordinates and vectors {{on the surface of}} the spherical. The intent of the report is to provide algorithms for spherical earth models that can be used for situations in which flat earth models are not appropriate, but that do not require the sophistication of rotating earth models.

40|$|A Waypoint Display Unit (WDU) was {{configured}} for an {{inertial navigation}} system. The hardware of this unit was {{designed so that}} it is compatible with conventional display and control units and permits aircraft installation without any problems. When selecting the processor, a Z 80 CPU was chosen on purpose, since the performance of such a processor is more than sufficient for this function. In order to keep the sizes of program and data memories compatible, a memory board was developed, the RAM and ROM modules of which are PIN compatible. The waypoint software is a so-called <b>great</b> <b>circle</b> <b>navigation.</b> The corresponding output data were designed analog to commercially available systems. The overall system was successfully tested in the aircraft. (orig.)

A first system receives parameters for flight plan configurations (e. g., initial fuel carried, flight route, flight route segments followed, flight altitude for a given flight route segment, aircraft velocity for each flight route segment, flight route ascent rate, flight route descent route, flight departure site, flight departure time, flight arrival time, flight destination site and/or alternate flight destination site), flight plan schedule, expected weather along each flight route segment, aircraft specifics, airspace (altitude) bounds for each flight route segment, navigational aids available.

The invention provides for aircraft dynamics effects, such as wind effects at each altitude, altitude changes, airspeed changes and aircraft turns to provide predictions of aircraft trajectory (and, optionally, aircraft fuel use).

50|$|A <b>great</b> <b>circle,</b> {{also known}} as an orthodrome, of a sphere is the {{intersection}} of the sphere and a plane that passes through the center point of the sphere. A <b>great</b> <b>circle</b> is the largest circle that can be drawn on any given sphere. Any diameter of any <b>great</b> <b>circle</b> coincides with a diameter of the sphere, and therefore all <b>great</b> <b>circles</b> have the same center and circumference as each other. This special case of a circle of a sphere is in opposition to a small circle, that is, {{the intersection of the}} sphere and a plane that does not pass through the center.

5000|$|Converting ruler {{distance}} on the Mercator map into true (<b>great</b> <b>circle)</b> {{distance on}} the sphere is straightforward along the equator but nowhere else. One {{problem is the}} variation of scale with latitude, and another is that straight lines on the map (rhumb lines), other than the meridians or the equator, do not correspond to <b>great</b> <b>circles.</b> The distinction between rhumb (sailing) distance and <b>great</b> <b>circle</b> (true) distance was clearly understood by Mercator. (See Legend 12 on the 1569 map.) He stressed that the rhumb line distance is an acceptable approximation for true <b>great</b> <b>circle</b> distance for courses of short or moderate distance, particularly at lower latitudes. He even quantifies his statement: [...] "When the <b>great</b> <b>circle</b> distances which are to be measured {{in the vicinity of}} the equator do not exceed 20 degrees of a <b>great</b> <b>circle,</b> or 15 degrees near Spain and France, or 8 and even 10 degrees in northern parts it is convenient to use rhumb line distances".|$|R

5000|$|A {{rhumb line}} can be contrasted with a <b>great</b> <b>circle,</b> which is the path of {{shortest}} distance between two points {{on the surface of}} a sphere.

If one were to drive a car along a <b>great</b> <b>circle</b> one would hold the steering wheel fixed, but to follow a rhumb line one would have to turn the wheel, turning it more sharply as the poles are approached.
