After conducting a study, the company decided against undertaking the costly conversion to the new technology. In the 1930s and 1940s, while other telephone companies across the nation were implementing the new, more efficient service, Rochester Telephone, unable to raise the necessary capital for the conversion because {{of the effects of}} the Great Depression and the war effort, was forced to continue using archaic equipment.|$|E

An Internet-based method for obtaining study subjects that may increase response rates has been developed and is described. This method uses information from two websites that, when combined, provide accurate and complete lists of names, addresses, and listed phone numbers. This method was developed by use of randomly selected streets {{in a suburb of}} Salt Lake City, Utah, in June 2005. control groups; epidemiologic methods; patient participation; patient selection; research design Abbreviation: RDD, random digit dialing. Epidemiologists have long recognized the importance of selecting appropriate controls in case-control studies (1 – 3). Over the last two <b>decades,</b> random digit <b>dialing</b> (RDD) (4, 5) has been used to identify and recruit controls, but advances in telephone technology have reduced response rates and increased selection bias when obtaining controls via RDD (5 – 7). These advances include answering machines, calle...|$|R
