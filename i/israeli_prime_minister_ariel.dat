25|$|Concurrent to the Second Intifada, <b>Israeli</b> <b>prime</b> <b>minister</b> <b>Ariel</b> Sharon {{proposed}} the Israeli disengagement from Gaza in 2003, which {{was approved by}} the Israeli government in June 2004, and the Knesset in February 2005. The unilateral withdrawal plan was executed in August 2005 and completed in September 2005. Nonetheless, the ICRC, the UN and various human rights organizations consider Israel still to be the de facto occupying power due to its control of Gaza's borders, air space and territorial waters.|$|E
25|$|The Disengagement Plan was a {{proposal}} by <b>Israeli</b> <b>Prime</b> <b>Minister</b> <b>Ariel</b> Sharon, {{adopted by the}} government and enacted in August 2005, to remove a permanent Israeli presence from the Gaza Strip and from four Israeli settlements in the northern West Bank. The civilians were evacuated (many forcibly) and the residential buildings demolished after August 15, and the disengagement from the Gaza Strip was completed on 12 September 2005, when the last Israeli soldier left. The military disengagement from the northern West Bank was completed ten days later.|$|E
5000|$|An {{example of}} a ceasefire in the Israeli-Palestinian {{conflict}} was announced between Israel and the Palestinian National Authority on February 8, 2005. When announced, chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat publicly defined the ceasefire as follows: [...] "We have agreed that today President Mahmoud Abbas will declare a full cessation of violence against <b>Israelis</b> anywhere and <b>Prime</b> <b>Minister</b> <b>Ariel</b> Sharon will declare a full cessation of violence and military activities against Palestinians anywhere." ...|$|R

The orders are clear: target and paralyze anyone who takes up weapons and tries to oppose our troops, resists them or endangers them—and to avoid harming the civilian population." [...] IDF officers also noted that incursions would force Palestinian militants [...] "to exert their energy by defending {{their homes in the}} camps instead of by plotting attacks on Israelis." ...|$|R
5000|$|However, in {{the long}} term, France {{is not one of}} the top {{countries}} of Jewish emigration toward Israel. Many French Jews feel a strong attachment to France. In November 2012, <b>Israeli</b> <b>Prime</b> <b>Minister</b> Benjamin Netanyahu in a joint press conference with François Hollande advised the French Jewish community by saying [...] "In my role as <b>Prime</b> <b>Minister</b> of Israel, I always say to Jews, wherever they may be, I say to them: Come to Israel and make Israel your home." [...] alluding to former Israel <b>Prime</b> <b>Minister's</b> <b>Ariel</b> Sharon's similar advisement towards the French Jewish community to move to Israel back in 2004.In 2013, 3,120 French Jews immigrated to Israel, marking a 63% increase over the previous year.|$|R
25|$|In {{response}} to the assassination of its Secretary General Abu Ali Mustafa, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), led by Ahmed Saadat, assassinated the Israeli Tourism Minister, Rehavam Ze'evi in 2001. Fuad Shubaki was suspected by Israel as being the mastermind behind the Karine A affair of 2002. Saadat, Shubaki, and four other Palestinians, including the man who shot Ze'evi, were held at the Jericho jail {{under the supervision of}} British and American wardens in accordance with a deal worked out between US President, George W. Bush and <b>Israeli</b> <b>Prime</b> <b>Minister,</b> <b>Ariel</b> Sharon, in April 2002. The agreement allowed the prisoners to be transferred from Yasser Arafat's Mukataa in Ramallah, where they were hiding during Operation Defensive Shield of April 2002. The four cell members who actively participated in Ze'evi's assassination were Hamdi Quran, who pulled the trigger, Basel al-Amar, Majdi Rimawi and Ahed Gholami. In a quick military trial in Ramallah, headed by Brigadier-General Ribhi Arafat, they were sentenced to hard labor. Quran was sentenced to 18 years, Asmar to 12, Rimawi to eight and Gholami to one year. Saadat was never placed on trial. The prison was situated next to the Palestinian Authority (PA) government building. Israeli rightists opposed the deal, saying it allowed the assassin to escape justice, while Palestinians opposed the jailing of one of a senior militant leader under Israeli pressure.|$|E
25|$|The ending {{date of the}} Second Intifada is disputed, {{as there}} was no {{definite}} event that brought it to an end. Some commentators such as Sever Plocker consider the intifada to have ended in late 2004. With the sickness and then death of Yasser Arafat in November 2004, the Palestinians lost their internationally recognised leader of the previous three decades, after which the intifada lost momentum and lead to internal fighting between Palestinian factions (most notably the Fatah–Hamas conflict), as well as conflict within Fatah itself. Israel's unilateral disengagement from the Gaza Strip, announced in June 2004 completed in August 2005, is also cited, for instance by Ramzy Baroud, as signalling {{the end of the}} intifada. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas vowed in the days leading to the Sharm el-Sheikh Summit of 2005 that it would mark the end of the intifada. The summit resulted in Abbas declaring violence would come to an end, and Ariel Sharon agreeing to release 900 Palestinian prisoners and withdraw from West Bank towns, some consider this to be the official end of the Second Intifada, although sporadic violence still continued outside PA control or condolence. On February 8, 2005 Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas and <b>Israeli</b> <b>Prime</b> <b>Minister</b> <b>Ariel</b> Sharon announced the cease-fire. Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) refused to be parties to the agreement, the cease-fire being the position of the Palestinian Authority only. Five days later Abbass reached agreement with the two dissenting organisations to commit to the truce with the proviso that Israeli violation would be met with retaliation. Schachter addressed the difficulties in deciding when this intifada ended. He reasoned that suicide bombing was the best criterion, being arguably the most important element of second intifada-related violence, and that according to this criterion the intifada ended during 2005.|$|E

In July 2004, he attended a conference discussing France's ban on the burka at which he talked alongside Islamist cleric Yusuf al-Qaradawi. Livingstone described al-Qaradawi as [...] "one of the most authoritative Muslim scholars in the world today" [...] and argued that his influence could help stop the radicalisation of young British Muslims. The move was controversial, with Jewish and LGBT organisations criticising Livingstone, citing al-Qaradawi's record of anti-Semitic and homophobic remarks, with the meeting leading to a publicised argument between Livingstone and his former supporter Peter Tatchell. Livingstone continued to champion the Palestinian cause in the Israel-Palestine conflict, in March 2005 accusing <b>Israeli</b> <b>Prime</b> <b>Minister</b> <b>Ariel</b> Sharon of being a [...] "war criminal" [...] responsible for the 1982 Sabra and Shatila massacre.|$|E

[...] Israeli officials {{argue that the}} pre-1967 armistice line is not a defensible border, since Israel would be nine miles wide at the thinnest point, subjected to rocket fire from the highlands of the West Bank, and unable to stop smuggling from Jordan across the Jordan Valley.
