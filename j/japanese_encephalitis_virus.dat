5|$|Dengue fever virus (DENV) is an RNA virus of {{the family}} Flaviviridae; genus Flavivirus. Other {{members of the same}} genus include yellow fever virus, West Nile virus, St. Louis {{encephalitis}} virus, <b>Japanese</b> <b>encephalitis</b> <b>virus,</b> tick-borne encephalitis virus, Kyasanur forest disease virus, and Omsk hemorrhagic fever virus. Most are transmitted by arthropods (mosquitoes or ticks), and are therefore also referred to as arboviruses (arthropod-borne viruses).|$|E

25|$|Japanese {{encephalitis}} (JE), is {{an infection}} of the brain caused by the <b>Japanese</b> <b>encephalitis</b> <b>virus</b> (JEV). While most infections result in little or no symptoms, occasional inflammation of the brain occurs. In these cases symptoms may include headache, vomiting, fever, confusion, and seizures. This occurs about 5 to 15 days after infection.|$|E
25|$|SL-II {{has been}} {{suggested}} to contribute to nuclease resistance.

25|$|Recently whole genome {{microarray}} {{research of}} neurons {{infected with the}} <b>Japanese</b> <b>Encephalitis</b> <b>virus</b> has shown that neurons {{play an important role}} in their own defense against Japanese Encephalitis infection. Although this challenges the long-held belief that neurons are immunologically quiescent, an improved understanding of the proinflammatory effects responsible for immune-mediated control of viral infection and neuronal injury during Japanese Encephalitis infection is an essential step for developing strategies for limiting the severity of CNS disease.|$|E

25|$|Flaviviruses {{constitute}} {{a family of}} linear, single-stranded RNA(+) viruses. Flaviviruses include the West Nile virus, dengue virus, Tick-borne Encephalitis Virus, Yellow Fever Virus, and several other viruses. Many flavivirus species can replicate in both mammalian and insect cells. Most flaviviruses are arthropod borne and multiply in both vertebrates and arthropods. The viruses in this family that are of veterinary importance include <b>Japanese</b> <b>encephalitis</b> <b>virus,</b> St. Louis encephalitis virus, West Nile virus, Israel turkey meningoencephalomyelitis virus, Sitiawan virus, Wesselsbron virus, yellow fever virus and the tick-borne flaviviruses e.g. louping ill virus.|$|E
2500|$|Human, cattle, {{and horses}} are {{dead-end}} hosts as the disease manifests as fatal encephalitis. [...] Swine {{acts as an}} amplifying host and has {{a very important role}} in the epidemiology of the disease. [...] Infection in swine is asymptomatic, except in pregnant sows, when abortion and fetal abnormalities are common sequelae. The most important vector is Culex tritaeniorhynchus, which feeds on cattle in preference to humans. It has been proposed that moving swine away from human habitation can divert the mosquito away from humans and swine. The natural hosts of the <b>Japanese</b> <b>encephalitis</b> <b>virus</b> are birds, not humans, and many believe the virus will therefore never be completely eliminated.

2500|$|Many viruses {{have evolved}} {{mechanisms}} to resist interferon activity. [...] They circumvent the IFN response by blocking downstream signaling events that occur after the cytokine binds to its receptor, by preventing further IFN production, and by inhibiting {{the functions of}} proteins that are induced by IFN. [...] Viruses that inhibit IFN signaling include <b>Japanese</b> <b>Encephalitis</b> <b>Virus</b> (JEV), dengue type 2 virus (DEN-2) and viruses of the herpesvirus family, such as human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) and Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus [...] (KSHV or HHV8). Viral proteins proven to affect IFN signaling include EBV nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1) and EBV nuclear antigen 2 (EBNA-2) from Epstein-Barr virus, the large T antigen of Polyomavirus, the E7 protein of Human papillomavirus (HPV), and the B18R protein of vaccinia virus. [...] Reducing IFN-α activity may prevent signaling via [...] STAT1, STAT2, [...] or IRF9 [...] (as with JEV infection) or through the JAK-STAT pathway (as with DEN-2 infection). [...] Several poxviruses encode soluble IFN receptor homologs—like the B18R protein of the vaccinia virus—that bind to and prevent IFN interacting with its cellular receptor, impeding communication between this cytokine and its target cells. [...] Some viruses can encode proteins that bind to double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) to prevent the activity of RNA-dependent protein kinases; this is the mechanism reovirus adopts using its sigma 3 (σ3) protein, and vaccinia virus employs using the gene product of its E3L gene, p25. The ability of interferon to induce protein production from interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) can also be affected. [...] Production of protein kinase R, for example, can be disrupted in cells infected with JEV [...] Some viruses escape the anti-viral activities of interferons by gene (and thus protein) mutation. [...] The H5N1 influenza virus, also known as bird flu, has resistance to interferon and other anti-viral cytokines that is attributed to a single amino acid change in its Non-Structural Protein 1 (NS1), although the precise mechanism of how this confers immunity is unclear.|$|E

40|$|West Nile virus (WNV) is a small, enveloped, mosquitotransmitted, positive-stranded RNA virus of the Flaviviridae family.

40|$|<b>Japanese</b> <b>encephalitis</b> {{is caused}} by <b>Japanese</b> <b>encephalitis</b> <b>viruses</b> (JEV) with neurotropism. As {{one of the most}} {{important}} immune organ, spleen is directly involved in immune response against JEV. However, little research about JEV infection process in spleen has been reported. In this study, immunopathological changes in mouse spleen were analyzed every other day after subcutaneous injection of mice with JEV wild-type strain P 3 by immunohistochemistry assay. Immunohistochemistry analysis demonstrated that the number of T lymphocytes was reduced from 0 to 3 DPI, increased from 3 to 7 DPI, and reduced again from 7 to 10 DPI. In addition, neurological dysfunction appeared at 6 DPI. These results suggested that spleen of mice suffered incontrovertible damages in influence of JEV infection. It can also be deduced that the cellular immunity took the crucial part in the first phase of transient viremia against JEV. Moreover, immune response was activated after the immune-depressed period in the first phase of viremia and neurological dysfunction appeared when cellular immunity was activated.
