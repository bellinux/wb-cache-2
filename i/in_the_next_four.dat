5|$|During the 2010 offseason, the Miami Heat re-signed {{team captain}} Dwyane Wade and added free agents Chris Bosh and LeBron James {{to form the}} Big Three. The Heat were then {{considered}} the favorites by many to win multiple championships, appearing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>four</b> finals, and winning two, in 2012 and 2013. James has also later represented the Eastern Conference in the NBA Finals in every year since 2011.|$|E
5|$|McCabe {{was unable}} to repeat his {{performances}} in the later Tests. He made 32 and a duck as Australia gained its only victory in the Second Test in Melbourne, before managing only 57 runs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>four</b> innings as Australia suffered consecutive defeats. He scored 73 in the first innings of the Fifth Test in Sydney as Australia compiled 435, but scored only four in a second innings collapse, leaving England with an eight-wicket victory. He had persisted with his strategy of standing his ground attacking the Bodyline bowling, but was unsuccessful.|$|E
5|$|Despite this auspicious {{start to}} his career, Shearer was only eased {{into the first}} team {{gradually}} and made just ten goalless appearances for the club the following season. Throughout his career Shearer was recognised for his strength, which, during his time at Southampton, enabled him to retain the ball and provide opportunities for teammates. Playing as a lone striker between wide men, Rod Wallace and Matt Le Tissier, Shearer scored three goals in 26 appearances in the 1989–90 season, and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>next,</b> <b>four</b> goals in 36 games. His performances in {{the centre of the}} Saints attack were soon recognised by the fans, who voted him their Player of the Year for 1991.|$|E

5|$|Following the 1911 exhibition, at the {{personal}} request of Sir George White, Coandă {{moved to the}} United Kingdom {{to take a position}} as chief engineer or chief designer at British and Colonial Aeroplane Company for a few years. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>four</b> decades Coandă worked on a great variety of inventions. During World War II he revived his earlier turbo-propulseur engine when he was contracted by the German Army in late 1942 to develop an air propulsion system for military ambulance snow sledges much like the one made for the Russian Grand Duke. The German contract concluded after one year, yielding no plans for production. Though Coandă had experimented with a variety of nozzles, and said that he had achieved a degree of success, no turbojet-engine-style fuel injection or combustion in the air stream was attempted.|$|E
5|$|King John enjoyed regular {{hunting in}} the Forest each November, and used St Briavels Castle as his base for such trips. The king entertained the Welsh lord Gruffyd ap Cadwallon at the castle in 1207. This royal {{interest}} resulted in further building works and substantial expenditure, with £291 being spent <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>four</b> years. A stone curtain wall replaced an earlier wooden one between 1209–11, complete with a tower and gateway. Inside the bailey a number of buildings suitable {{for use by the}} king as a lodge were constructed. A wooden chapel was built within the castle in 1236–7. The castle expansion may have been funded by the increased taxes from iron-working across the areas, {{and by the end of}} John's reign, the castle was almost in its mature form.|$|E
5|$|Prost was {{partnered with}} fellow Frenchman René Arnoux for 1981.

He did not finish the first two Grands Prix, due to collisions with Andrea de Cesaris in Long Beach and Didier Pironi at Jacarepaguá, but scored his first podium finish at Buenos Aires. He also did not finish <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>four</b> races, and then won his first Formula One race at his home Grand Prix in France at the fast Dijon circuit, finishing two seconds ahead of his old teammate John Watson.|$|E

5|$|Sherman's {{financial}} expertise and {{his friendship with}} Hayes made him a natural choice for Treasury Secretary in 1877. Like Grant before him, Hayes had not consulted party leaders about his cabinet appointments, and the Senate took the then-unusual step of referring {{all of them to}} committee. Two days later, senators approved Sherman's nomination after an hour of debate, and he began lobbying his former colleagues to approve the other nominations, which they eventually did. Hayes and Sherman became close friends <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>four</b> years, taking regular carriage rides together to discuss matters of state in private. In the Treasury, as in the Senate, Sherman was confronted with two tasks: first, to prepare for specie resumption when it took effect in 1879; second, to deal with the backlash against the diminution of silver coinage.|$|E
5|$|Coulthard set a fastest lap of the race, a 1:21.335 on lap two as {{he gained}} on Michael Schumacher's early start advantage. De la Rosa claimed sixth {{position}} from Frentzen {{on the same}} lap. Michael Schumacher started to trade fastest laps with Coulthard on lap four as Villeneuve maintained third position but was holding up the drivers <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>four</b> positions who were behind him. Button's engine began to develop problems as Fisichella was passed by Verstappen for tenth on the same lap. As Michael Schumacher and Coulthard continued their battle up front, the stewards informed the McLaren team on lap ten that Coulthard would serve a ten-second stop-go penalty as his mechanics worked on his car 15 seconds before the formation lap begun. On the 13th lap, Ralf Schumacher overtook Herbert to take 12th position. Coulthard took his penalty on lap 14 and rejoined in tenth place. Herbert made a pit stop with an gearbox issue on the same lap {{and became the first}} retirement of the race. Häkkinen attempted to pass Barrichello on lap 16 although he overshot the manoeuvre.|$|E
5|$|Following {{these deaths}} Lie {{was unable to}} support his wife. He {{therefore}} sold his school to Oey Kim Hoat and left his position at Zending Press {{to take a job}} as a land surveyor. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>four</b> years he held various jobs. In 1881 Oey Pek Nio gave birth again. She died soon afterwards and the baby was sent to live with her grandfather father in Gadog, a village to the southeast of Buitenzorg, to be raised. The child died in 1886. Lie published his first books in 1884. Two of these, Kitab Edja and Sobat Anak-Anak, were published by Zending Press. The former was a study book to help students learn to write Malay, while the latter was a collection of stories for children that Aprinus Salam of Gadjah Mada University credits as the first work of popular literature in the Indies. The other two books were published by W. Bruining&Co., based in the colonial capital at Batavia (now Jakarta). One of these, Malajoe Batawi, was a grammar of Malay intended to standardise the language's spelling. The other was the four-volume syair (a traditional Malay form of poetry) Sair Tjerita Siti Akbari; this book, dealing with a gender-disguised warrior who conquers the Sultanate of Hindustan to save her husband, became one of Lie's best-known works.|$|E

5|$|Häkkinen {{began to}} {{maintain}} his lead from teammate Coulthard. On lap two Herbert moved into fifth position after Irvine dropped to seventh place when Verstappen overtook him. Further down the field Barrichello continued to gain positions when he passed both BAR drivers for eighth. The McLaren drivers managed to maintain a gap to Trulli who set the fastest lap of the race, 1:46.321. Irvine lost a further position to Barrichello on lap three, as Frentzen claimed 14th from Diniz. On lap four, Frentzen made up a further position by passing Heidfeld for 13th. On the same lap Verstappen locked up his tyres to avoid a collision with Herbert. This allowed Barrichello to pass Verstappen for sixth position in the run up to the Clark chicane on lap five. Herbert lost fifth position to Barrichello on lap six with Frentzen continuing {{to move up the}} field by passing Ralf Schumacher and Wurz for eleventh. Barrichello began setting consecutive fastest laps as he closed the gap to de la Rosa. Zonta lost 10th position when he was passed by Frentzen on lap seven. On the next lap, Verstappen suffered a worrying moment when half of his engine cover was shed from its chassis. Frentzen managed to gain a further four positions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>four</b> laps.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>four</b> seasons, they {{competed in}} the European Cup and Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, but failed to {{progress}} past the third round in either competition. A tie against Dutch team Ajax during the 1966–67 European Cup was to prove pivotal {{in the history of}} Liverpool in European competition. Ajax beat Liverpool 7–3 on aggregate. However, the style of football that Ajax played– a patient passing game, inspired by Johann Cruyff– convinced Shankly that Liverpool had to replicate this style to be successful in Europe. Liverpool reached the semi-finals of the 1970–71 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, losing 1–0 on aggregate to Leeds United. They {{competed in the}} 1971–72 European Cup Winners' Cup, despite losing the 1971 FA Cup Final, as the FA Cup winners, Arsenal, had also qualified for the European Cup by winning the league championship. Liverpool were eliminated in the second round by Bayern Munich of Germany, losing 3–1 on aggregate.|$|E
