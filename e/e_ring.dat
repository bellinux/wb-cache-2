Images acquired from this distance had very poor spatial resolution, but revealed a highly reflective surface devoid of impact craters, indicating a youthful surface. Voyager 1 also confirmed that Enceladus was embedded in the densest part of Saturn's diffuse <b>E</b> <b>ring.</b> Combined with the apparent youthful appearance of the surface, Voyager scientists suggested that the <b>E</b> <b>ring</b> consisted of particles vented from Enceladus's surface.|$|E

5|$|There are {{two main}} {{hypotheses}} regarding {{the origin of the}} rings. One hypothesis is that the rings are remnants of a destroyed moon of Saturn. The second hypothesis is that the rings are left over from the original nebular material from which Saturn formed. Some ice in the <b>E</b> <b>ring</b> comes from the moon Enceladus's geysers.|$|E
5|$|Mathematical models {{show that}} the <b>E</b> <b>ring</b> is unstable, with a {{lifespan}} between 10,000 and 1,000,000 years; therefore, particles composing it must be constantly replenished. Enceladus is orbiting inside the ring, at its narrowest but highest density point. In the 1980s some suspected that Enceladus is {{the main source of}} particles for the ring. This hypothesis was confirmed by Cassini's first two close flybys in 2005.|$|E
5|$|The peak {{brightness}} of the μ ring lies almost exactly on the orbit of the small Uranian moon Mab, which is probably {{the source of the}} ring’s particles. The ν ring is positioned between Portia and Rosalind and does not contain any moons inside it. A reanalysis of the Voyager 2 images of forward-scattered light clearly reveals the μ and ν rings. In this geometry the rings are much brighter, which indicates that they contain much micrometer-sized dust. The outer rings of Uranus may be similar to the G and E rings of Saturn as <b>E</b> <b>ring</b> is extremely broad and receives dust from Enceladus.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe {{define and}} study Morita Matrix (MM) <b>rings,</b> i. <b>e.</b> <b>rings</b> whose only Morita {{equivalent}} rings are (up to isomorphism) the matrix rings over them. In {{the description of}} rings of this type, Picard progenerators and (in the commutative case) the Picard group play a significant role. For a wide class of rings (including commutative ones) indecomposability is necessary to be an MM ring. For commutative rings an additional necessary condition is that the Picard group be divisible. In a number of special cases these two conditions will also become sufficient. The behaviour of MM rings under some of the usual constructions (i. <b>e.</b> <b>rings</b> of polynomials and power series, pullbacks, etc.) is also examined and from this numerous examples of MM rings are derived. Further non-commutative examples are found amongst ultramatricial von Neumann regular rings...|$|R

For <b>RING</b> <b>E</b> 3 dimers, the RING domain of one subunit and tail of the second cooperate to prime Ub, but how this is accomplished by monomeric <b>RING</b> <b>E</b> 3 s {{in the absence of}} a tail-like component is currently unknown.

5|$|Enceladus {{is one of}} {{the major}} inner {{satellites}} of Saturn along with Dione, Tethys, and Mimas. It orbits at 238,000km from Saturn's center and 180,000km from its cloud tops, between the orbits of Mimas and Tethys. It orbits Saturn every 32.9 hours, fast enough for its motion to be observed over a single night of observation. Enceladus is currently in a 2:1 mean-motion orbital resonance with Dione, completing two orbits around Saturn for every one orbit completed by Dione. This resonance maintains Enceladus's orbital eccentricity (0.0047), which is known as a forced eccentricity. This non-zero eccentricity results in tidal deformation of Enceladus. The dissipated heat resulting from this deformation is the main heating source for Enceladus's geologic activity. Enceladus orbits within the densest part of Saturn's <b>E</b> <b>ring,</b> the outermost of its major rings, and is the main source of the ring's material composition.|$|E

25|$|The G Ring (see last {{image in}} gallery) {{is a very}} thin, faint ring about halfway between the F Ring and the {{beginning}} of the <b>E</b> <b>Ring,</b> with its inner edge about 15,000km inside the orbit of Mimas. It contains a single distinctly brighter arc near its inner edge (similar to the arcs in the rings of Neptune) that extends about one sixth of its circumference, centered on the half-km diameter moonlet Aegaeon, which is held in place by a 7:6 orbital resonance with Mimas. The arc is believed to be composed of icy particles up to a few m in diameter, with the rest of the G Ring consisting of dust released from within the arc. The radial width of the arc is about 250km, compared to a width of 9,000km for the G Ring as a whole. The arc is thought to contain matter equivalent to a small icy moonlet about a hundred m in diameter. Dust released from Aegaeon and other source bodies within the arc by micrometeoroid impacts drifts outward from the arc because of interaction with Saturn's magnetosphere (whose plasma corotates with Saturn's magnetic field, which rotates much more rapidly than the orbital motion of the G Ring). These tiny particles are steadily eroded away by further impacts and dispersed by plasma drag. Over the course of thousands of years the ring gradually loses mass, which is replenished by further impacts on Aegaeon.|$|E

500|$|Enceladus {{is one of}} the {{smallest}} of Saturn's moons that is spherical in shape—only Mimas is smaller—yet is the only small Saturnian moon that is currently endogenously active, and {{the smallest}} known body in the Solar System that is geologically active today. Its surface is morphologically diverse; it includes ancient heavily cratered terrain as well as younger smooth areas with few impact craters. Many plains on Enceladus are fractured and intersected by systems of lineaments. The area around its south pole was found by Cassini to be unusually warm and cut by a system of fractures about 130km long called [...] "tiger stripes", some of which emit jets of water vapor and dust. These jets form a large plume off its south pole, which replenishes Saturn's <b>E</b> <b>ring</b> and serves as the main source of ions in the magnetosphere of Saturn. The gas and dust are released with a rate of more than 100kg/s. Enceladus may have liquid water underneath the south-polar surface. The source of the energy for this cryovolcanism is thought to be a 2:1 mean-motion resonance with Dione. The pure ice on the surface makes Enceladus one of the brightest known objects in the Solar System—its geometrical albedo is more than 140%.|$|E
500|$|Images {{taken by}} Cassini during the flyby on July 14, 2005, {{revealed}} a distinctive, tectonically deformed region surrounding Enceladus's south pole. This area, reaching {{as far north}} as 60° south latitude, is covered in tectonic fractures and ridges. The area has few sizable impact craters, suggesting that it is the youngest surface on Enceladus and on any of the mid-sized icy satellites; modeling of the cratering rate suggests that some regions of the south polar terrain are possibly as young as 500,000 years or less. Near the center of this terrain are four fractures bounded by ridges, unofficially called [...] "tiger stripes". They appear to be the youngest features in this region and are surrounded by mint-green-colored (in false color, UV–green–near IR images), coarse-grained water ice, seen elsewhere on the surface within outcrops and fracture walls. Here the [...] "blue" [...] ice is on a flat surface, indicating that the region is young enough not to have been coated by fine-grained water ice from the <b>E</b> <b>ring.</b> Results from the visual and infrared spectrometer (VIMS) instrument suggest that the green-colored material surrounding the tiger stripes is chemically distinct {{from the rest of the}} surface of Enceladus. VIMS detected crystalline water ice in the stripes, suggesting that they are quite young (likely less than 1,000 years old) or the surface ice has been thermally altered in the recent past. VIMS also detected simple organic (carbon-containing) compounds in the tiger stripes, chemistry not found anywhere else on Enceladus thus far.|$|E

Unlike the main rings, the <b>E</b> <b>Ring</b> is more than 2,000km thick and increases with its distance from Enceladus.

Non-covalent Ub binding to {{the backside of}} certain E 2 s promotes processive polyUb formation, but the mechanism remains elusive. Here, we show that backside bound Ub (UbB) enhances both RING-independent and RING-dependent UbcH 5 B-catalyzed donor Ub (UbD) transfer, but with a more prominent effect in RING-dependent transfer. UbB enhances <b>RING</b> <b>E</b> 3 s’ affinities for UbcH 5 B–Ub, and <b>RING</b> <b>E</b> 3 -UbcH 5 B–Ub complex improves UbB’s affinity for UbcH 5 B.
