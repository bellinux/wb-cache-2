2500|$|The {{model was}} the {{successor}} to the ageing twin cylinder CB360 and the highly regarded, but expensive for the 400cc class, four-cylinder CB400F. The CB400T has two fewer cylinders than its CB400F predecessor and although the press was initially skeptical of it, reviews stated {{that it was a}} worthwhile successor and more than capable of competing with contemporary rivals. Its overhead camshaft [...] air-cooled parallel-twin had been completely redesigned, with a chain drive that operated three valves per cylinder, two <b>for</b> <b>inlet</b> and one for exhaust. It differs from rival manufacturers 400cc twin-cylinder models because it has a 360° crank layout similar to many traditional British parallel twins instead of the more common 180° crank layout. Counter-rotating balance-shafts help to reduce unwanted vibrations caused by the 360° crank layout. Honda fitted these models with capacitor discharge ignition instead of the points system found on its predecessors, that required frequent maintenance. It uses a five-speed transmission with a chain final drive. Fuelling is provided by twin Keihin [...] carburettors. A steel diamond cradle type frame uses the engine as a stressed member to reduce mass and increase ground clearance.|$|E
2500|$|E.N.V.'s V-8 engines {{appeared}} in six different models. [...] Most {{of these were}} identified by a letter, though contemporary sources often refer to them by power. [...] The assignment of the letters C, D, F and T is known from contemporary sources. The one type known to have pre-dated the C has been assigned the letter A by a later historian, a notation followed here. [...] The last engine is usually known as the 1914 100hp E.N.V. [...] The physical details of all the engines, such as bore and stroke etc. are known from both contemporary records and surviving examples. [...] There were also variations within types, as development proceeded. Nonetheless, all the V-8s had much in common. [...] They all had their cylinder banks separated by 90°, leaving space within the V <b>for</b> <b>inlet</b> manifolds and valvegear. [...] All were water-cooled; each cylinder was enclosed with an electrolytically formed copper jacket. Initially these were produced with {{a variant of the}} lost wax process. [...] The cylinders were coated with wax, which was then coated with black lead to make it electrically conductive and copper plated. [...] Afterwards the wax was removed by heating. [...] Later, the insulating wax was replaced with electrically conducting, low melting point white metal, simplifying the process. [...] Pistons were made of steel, with cast iron rings, and the crankcases were cast aluminium. [...] There was one plug per cylinder, supplied by a gear-driven magneto alone or with an additional battery-driven ignition coil and distributor for dual ignition.|$|E
2500|$|The types A, C, D and F {{were all}} side-valve engines, with valves {{operated}} by push rods running exposed and {{parallel to the}} cylinder axes, driven within the V from a central, gear-driven camshaft above the crankshaft. [...] All camshafts were hollow for lubrication. [...] The cylinder cooling jackets surrounded the cylinders, then turned inward with flattened faces <b>for</b> <b>inlet</b> and exhaust manifolds and push rods. [...] The exhaust stubs were vertical, each bank of cylinders feeding its own horizontal pipe. The inlet stubs entered the cylinder head at right angles. The earliest type A engines {{had a pair of}} inlet tubes, one for each bank and fed from a carburettor at the front. [...] Slightly later model As and types C and F placed the carburettor between the cylinder banks, halfway along the engine axis. [...] Fuel and air was passed to a spherical copper mixing chamber above the carburettor, then via four radial copper tubes which finally branched into pairs the feed the inlet ports symmetrically. [...] The smaller type D retained the end positioned carburettor. [...] These engines all had cast iron cylinders. The types A and C were very similar in construction as well as capacity, but a major change in crankshaft design was introduced with the smaller type D and inherited by the F. [...] The A and C types had a crankshaft supported by only three plain bearings and the width of the central one required a greater space between the second and third cylinder of each bank, visibly dividing each into blocks of two. [...] The crankshafts of the D and F types had five ball race bearings, one between each cylinder and two end bearings; the output thrust bearing was a double race to allow for pusher or tractor configurations. [...] The new bearing arrangement permitted an equal cylinder spacing. [...] The type FA was a type F with an extended crankshaft, mounted in a very prominent, conical crankcase extension. [...] The type T, discussed below, had a similar extension, which in that case at least allowed a larger diameter thrust bearing to be used.|$|E

But all window apertures, as compared with door apertures, have almost infinite licence of form and size: they may be of any shape, from the slit or cross slit to the circle;[56] of any size, from the loophole of the castle to the pillars of light of the cathedral apse. Yet, according to their place and purpose, one or two laws of fitness hold respecting them, which let us examine in the two classes of windows successively, but without reference to military architecture, which here, as before, we may dismiss as a subject of separate science, only noticing that windows, like all other features, are always delightful, if not beautiful, when their position and shape have indeed been thus necessarily determined, and that many of their most picturesque forms have resulted from the requirements of war. We should also find in military architecture the typical forms of the two classes of outlet and inlet windows in their utmost development; the greatest sweep of sight and range of shot on the one hand, and the fullest entry of light and air on the other, being constantly required at the smallest possible apertures. Our business, however, is to reason out the laws for ourselves, {{not to take the}} examples as we find them.|$|E
