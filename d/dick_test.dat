50|$|The <b>Dick</b> <b>test</b> {{was invented}} in 1924 and was used to {{identify}} those susceptible to scarlet fever. A broth culture filtrate from an erythrogenic toxin-producing group A streptococcus was injected intracutaneously into susceptible persons. In those susceptible, erythematous and oedematous skin reactions developed by 24 hours after injection. A second injection of antitoxin into the site neutralized the reactions. Nonreactors were considered to have sufficient antibodies to the toxin, and thus were not susceptible to scarlet fever.|$|E
5000|$|In October, 1923, Dick and {{her husband}} {{successfully}} isolated hemolytic streptococcus [...] "as the causative agent of scarlet fever," [...] and later developed the <b>Dick</b> <b>test,</b> a skin test which determined a person's susceptibility to the disease and produced [...] "active immunization by larger doses of toxin and antitoxin for treatment, prevention, and diagnosis. They patented their toxin and antitoxin production methods in 1924 and 1926, which produced criticism from the medical field. The Dicks argued that the patents maintained quality control and ultimately won {{a lawsuit against the}} Lederle Laboratories in 1930 for [...] "patent infringement and improper toxin manufacture." ...|$|E
50|$|Bacteriophages were {{discovered}} in 1915 by Frederick Twort. His work was overlooked and bacteriophages were later rediscovered by Felix d'Herelle in 1917. The specific association of scarlet fever with the group A streptococci had to await the development of Lancefield's streptococcal grouping scheme in the 1920s. George and Gladys Dick showed that cell-free filtrates could induce the erythematous reaction characteristic of scarlet fever, proving that this reaction was due to a toxin. Karelitz and Stempien discovered that extracts from human serum globulin and placental globulin {{can be used as}} lightening agents for scarlet fever and this was used later {{as the basis for the}} <b>Dick</b> <b>test.</b> The association of scarlet fever and bacteriophages was described in 1926 by Cantucuzene and Boncieu.|$|E

The owner, Omega collector Thomas <b>Dick,</b> <b>tested</b> the watch and concluded that the battery life of the twin (344) cells was approximately 5 weeks, however the accuracy when bench tested was 0.03 seconds per day, still equating to 12 second per year.|$|R

40|$|A {{group of}} {{schoolchildren}} in four Nashville schools was tested for reactivity to <b>Dick</b> <b>test</b> toxin during school years 1969 - 1970 and 1970 - 1971. Combined {{results from the}} fall of both school years showed that 51. 7 % of the children five through 12 years of age were positive for the <b>Dick</b> <b>test.</b> The highest percentage of children (66. 7 %) with positive Dick tests was found among those five to six years old. There was a gradual decrease in positive reactors with increasing age. There {{were no significant differences}} in reactivity between black and white children. The per-centage of children with positive tests in the three schools serving lower socio-economic areas (43. 3 %) was significantly lower than that of children in the middle-class school, where 90. 1 % were positive. Rates of conversion from positive to negative were highest (12. 1 %) among five- to six-year-old kindergarten children attending the three lower socioeconomic schools. Slightly less than two-thirds (64. 1 %) of children with a history of scarlet fever were still positive.

40|$|Because of the {{association}} of the group A streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxins (SPEs) with erythrogenic toxin used in the classical <b>Dick</b> <b>test,</b> the involvement of the SPEs in production of erythematous skin reactions was assessed. Unless they had been presensitized, young adult rabbits failed to show skin reactions after intracutaneous challenged with SPEs. Rabbits presensitized to purified protein derivative exhibited enhanced skin reactivity when given purified protein derivative plus SPE C; the enhancement was neutralized by antiserum to SPE C. Rabbits sensitized to bovine serum albumin showed extensive red rash development resembling scarlet fever rashes when given bovine serum albumin containing SPE C. Desquamation occurred 5 to 10 days after injection. Animals sensitized to one SPE type showed enhanced skin reactivity to challenge with homologous or heterologous SPE types, indicating the presence of a cross-reactive determinant within the SPE molecules. Repeated challenge of SPE-sensitized animals with homologous toxin resulted in concomitant antitoxin production with reduction of the enhanced skin reactivities, until typical delayed-hypersensitivity skin reactions remained. The data indicate that, in addition to the toxic reaction previously described, SPEs enhance Arthus and delayed-hypersensitivity skin reactions. It follows that erythrogenic toxin represents the enhancement of acquired skin reactivity to streptococcal antigens by one or more SPE types. Therefore, the <b>Dick</b> <b>test</b> measures SPE-enhanced hypersensitivity to streptococcal products...|$|E
40|$|The RIVM {{performed}} the helix {{test in the}} autoclaves of 20 hospitals. Only 59 % of the test results were positive, while the Bowie and <b>Dick</b> <b>test</b> was positive in all cases. The test helix added to a light instrument tray {{proved to be a}} particular challenge to the sterilisation process. One of the measures for infection prevention in hospital is the sterilisation of the surgical instruments by steam sterilisation. For this sterilisation method it is important that steam is able to get to all surfaces of the instruments and to penetrate into hollow instruments. European standardisation committee CEN TC 102 developed the helix test to demonstrate steam penetration into hollow devices. This method utilises a long narrow tube. Steam penetration throughout the length of the tube is demonstrated with an indicator {{at the end of the}} tube. This test method is essentially different from the currently used test method that utilises a textile pack; the Bowie and <b>Dick</b> <b>test.</b> Nowadays the vast majority of the hospitals do not sterilise textile packs, but there is a distinct increase in the number of hollow instruments that is reprocessed, eg. laparoscopic instruments. Hospitals should adopt their sterilisation indicators to the type of steriliser load and are advised to evaluate the performance of the sterilisers with the helix test added to a light instrument tray...|$|E
40|$|Many {{observations}} {{indicate that}} immunological reactivity is conditioned {{to some extent}} by the degree of sexual maturity. In certain tropical and arctic communities where scarlet fever and diphtheria occur very rarely, negativity to both Schick and <b>Dick</b> <b>tests</b> {{has been found to}} develop at puberty. Certain dermatomycoses occur exclusively in childhood and heal spontaneously at puberty (1). The development of antibodies against antigen with which contact is not ordinarily established {{has been found to be}} similarly conditioned. Conflicting interpretations of such observations are discussed by Manwaring (2), Jungeblut (3), and Herrman (4). The incidence, severity, and character of the manifestations of rheumatic fever are apparently influenced by factors associated with age and sex. Most observers agree that the disease is chiefly prepubertal in origin, some studies (5, 6) indicating that 98 per cent of first attacks occur before the ages of 12 or 15.

40|$|During {{the past}} three years Birkhaug (1 - 5) has {{reported}} the results of an extensive investigation of many phases of erysipelas both in experimental animals and in man. His observations may be sum-marized briefly. Hemolytic streptococci from erysipelas were found to form an immunologically specific group of streptococci. Ninety-one per cent of such organisms tested by the agglutinin absorption technique fell into this group. No cross agglutination with Strepto-coccus scarlatinae was noted (1). Serum obtained by immunizing rabbits against strains of erysipelas streptococci protected the skin of normal rabbits from infection with the homologous and heterologous erysipelas strains when the serum and bacteria were injected together. Passive immunity was also obtained by intravenous or subcutaneous injection of the serum twenty-four hours before the inoculation of a supralethal dose of organisms. Under these conditions the results with heterologous organisms were not so regular as with the homol-ogous strains (2). The immune serum caused a blanching of the erysipelatous lesion in patients or tended to prevent its spread. This effect was not obtained with scarlatinal antitoxin; nor was blanching of the scarlatinal rash obtained with anti-erysipelas serum. Blanch-ing of the erysipelatous lesion was also obtained with convalescent erysipelas serum (2). Broth cultures of erysipelas streptococci uni-formly gave toxic filtrates which in dilutions of 1 : 1000 produced a skin reaction in susceptible individuals similar to a positive <b>Dick</b> <b>test.</b> Some strains produced filtrates which contained 30, 000 to 50, 000 S.

40|$|The factors {{present in}} streptococcal lesion {{extracts}} (SLE) which enhanced the lethal and tissue-damaging properties of Gram-negative bacterial endotoxins and streptolysin O were {{identified with the}} scarlet fever group of toxins. Toxic manifestations attributed to this group of toxins included lethality, cardiotoxic and other tissue damage, enhancement of toxicity, and pyrogenicity. Of these, the measurement of febrile response in American Dutch rabbits was the most useful parameter of toxicity. In rabbits, repeated daily intravenous injections of 0. 125 Lf of a purified erythrogenic toxin immunizes specifically against the pyrogenic activity; this technique was used to type the toxins and to distinguish them from exogenous and endogenous pyrogens; non-specific pyrogens, such as streptococcal endotoxin, were not found in SLE. All types of the Lancefield Group A streptococci tested produced one or or more immunologically distinct toxins in vivo in contrast to Groups B and C which did not produce them; toxins A and B, previously distinguished by neutralization of rash-inducing activity in the skin, were produced in vivo. The A toxin was the most common, as indicated by its presence in extracts prepared with Types 28, 12, 17, and 10 (NY- 5); B toxin was found in 10 (NY- 5) and 19. A new toxin, designated C, was obtained from a Type 18. In American Dutch rabbits, purified toxin at a concentration of 15 Lf (900, 000 STD) neither gave a <b>Dick</b> <b>test</b> nor prepared the skin for the local Shwartzman reaction; by this route, however, in contrast to classical endotoxins, they enhance the lethal and tissue-damaging properties of sublethal doses {{of these and other}} toxins. These properties of the immunologic distinct exotoxins as demonstrated in American Dutch rabbits suggest by analogy their importance in the pathogenesis of streptococcal disease in man. Evidence that might implicate them in sequelae, in addition to scarlet fever, is discussed...|$|E

40|$|Drawing upon {{intergroup}} contact theory (Allport, 1954; Pettigrew 1998) and {{the emerging}} literature on intergroup climate (e. g., Christ et al., 2013, 2014), I utilised various antipathetic intergroup relationships (e. g., Black people vs. White people; non-Muslims vs. Muslims), and various models of contact (e. g., Pettigrew, 1998; Koschate & van <b>Dick,</b> 2011) to <b>test</b> whether {{the effect of}} higher quality contact on less prejudice was facilitated by perceptions of a more positive intergroup climate. Results supported Allportâ€™s (1954) classic model of four contact conditions independently predicting prejudice, although the conditions of â€˜equal statusâ€™, â€˜goal interdependenceâ€™, and â€˜cooperationâ€™ loaded strongly onto a separate factor than did â€˜authority supportâ€™. Intergroup climate was successfully modelled as perceptions of intergroup norms, ingroup norms, and sociohistoric norms; further, there was some indication that beliefs regarding authority â€“ traditionally considered a contact condition â€“ might also impact intergroup climate {{in the form of}} macro authority norms. Results further supported the position that individuals are sensitive to intergroup climate, perceptions of which exhibited a separate â€“ and stronger â€“ effect on outgroup attitudes than did quality of personal contact. Regarding the proposed moderating effect of intergroup climate on contact effects, results were equivocal across studies. Some results supported the prediction of a facilitating effect of warmer ingroup norms on stronger contact effects. However, analyses of cross-sectional data revealed some evidence for an inhibitory effect, such that more negative (vs. positive) perceptions of intergroup climate were associated with a stronger relation between higher quality contact and warmer outgroup attitudes. Therefore, some aspects of intergroup contact might be most effective in negative intergroup climates. Theoretical and practical implications for contact researchers, prejudice researchers, and practitioners, are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Steam {{sterilization}} Hollow Load Process Challenge Devices (HLPCDs) {{are designed}} to assess the adequacy of air removal and steam penetration in a porous load steam sterilization process including those used in {{both large and small}} sterilizers. A PCD should be used in every load to ensure adequacy of air removal and steam penetration. Use of PCDs is also {{an integral part of the}} quality assurance systems used to ensure the sterility of each batch of reusable medical devices. There are a number of HLPCDs commercially available which have various design features ranging from simple tubular helical designs compliant to EN 867 - 5 to more complex electronic measurement systems. The aim of this study was to assess seven commercially produced HLPCDs for their ability to detect residual air in a porous load steam sterilizer employing a range of air removal stages. In addition to testing in processes deemed to be satisfactory, assessment was also carried out in cycles in which increasing amounts of residual air was artificially induced. The performance of each HLPCD was compared to that of a Bowie and <b>Dick</b> (BD) textile <b>test</b> pack into which were inserted temperature sensors. All tests were carried out with a single device in an empty chamber. The BD textile pack was chosen as a reference because it is well established as reference device for both full load and empty chamber tests. Only one of the seven HLPCDs tested exhibited equivalent performance to the BD reference device. One HLPCD was overly sensitive, failing an acceptable process. Four HLPCDs were incapable of detecting large failures in sub/super atmospheric pulsing cycles. One HLPCD was insensitive to residual air introduced into the chamber as a bolus at a specific point in the cycle. The results of this study show an unacceptable variability in performance in HLPCDs claimed to meet EN 867 - 5. Users should be extremely cautious when selecting an appropriate PCD for use in their own Sterile Service Departments and where possible, evaluation should be carried out before selections are made. Some HLPCDs will lead to a false sense of security and may result in processed goods being released into use, the sterility of which may be compromised due to undetected process failures...|$|R
