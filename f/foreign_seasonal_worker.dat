30|$|Generally a <b>foreign</b> <b>seasonal</b> <b>worker</b> in Germany {{has to make}} social {{security}} contributions {{if he or she}} is not insured in the home country. The only exemption applies for short-term employment; if a worker is employed for less than two months or 50 working days a year, than no {{social security}} contributions need to be paid, independent of the nationality status.|$|E
30|$|On the one hand, it can {{be argued}} that the {{short-term}} nature of seasonal work makes retirement and unemployment benefits a marginal issue for seasonal workers. In that case, workers should not be obliged to make mandatory contributions for social services. On the other hand, in countries with a long tradition of <b>foreign</b> <b>seasonal</b> <b>worker</b> employment, such as Germany and France, it is common for workers to return every season, and in some cases they have done this for more than 20  years. Consequently, access to social security is an important issue, especially when considering that agricultural work is often characterised by a high risk of accidents, and that the physically demanding tasks often leave workers unable to work when old or even before reaching the retirement age.|$|E
30|$|The {{recruitment}} {{process in}} all four countries is characterised by several similarities. In general before an employer can request a <b>foreign</b> <b>seasonal</b> <b>worker,</b> certain requirements must be fulfilled. First, a labour market test must prove that not enough domestic workers can be recruited to fill the labour shortage. Then an employer can apply for permission to recruit workers and request them either by name or anonymous. The recruitment of workers and the regulation of the scheme are mostly administered by the relevant ministries, for example the ministry for labour/employment or the ministry of immigration. To work in Australia or New Zealand workers must then undergo a health test, which is also mandatory for workers in France and Germany who are third country nationals and recruited from outside the European Union (EU). Typically the visa is subject to certain conditions, such as binding the worker to one single employer and imposing an obligation to leave the host country after termination of the work contract. However, while in New Zealand and Australia employers must arrange and pay upfront for workers’ international travel arrangements (half {{of which they are}} allowed to recoup from the workers), in France and Germany workers have to pay and organise all travel and transportation by themselves.|$|E
30|$|The four country {{comparison}} {{has thus}} strengthened {{the conclusion of}} this paper that the ‘more rights the better’ does not per se constitute the most suitable approach, as <b>foreign</b> <b>seasonal</b> <b>workers</b> have very specific needs and thus require customised protection. In some cases, as for example in relation to social security, solutions that specifically target the needs of <b>foreign</b> <b>seasonal</b> <b>workers</b> need to be established. However in most other cases the equal treatment doctrine of <b>foreign</b> <b>seasonal</b> <b>workers</b> and nationals of the host country constitutes the most suitable approach in creating appropriate level of social protection rights that best meets the interests of all stakeholders.|$|R
30|$|The {{comparison}} of <b>seasonal</b> <b>worker</b> regulations across four countries has revealed several similarities and differences. All four countries grant their <b>foreign</b> <b>seasonal</b> <b>workers</b> {{the right to}} unionise. With the exception of New Zealand all countries also provide access to retirement benefits. However, the majority of <b>foreign</b> <b>seasonal</b> <b>workers</b> in Germany and Australia {{will be unable to}} meet the qualifying periods. Differences were detected in the area of unemployment benefits. While <b>seasonal</b> <b>workers</b> in Australia and New Zealand are not allowed to access unemployment benefits, they are eligible for those services in Germany and France. The major difference this four country comparison has revealed is the fact that Germany and France aim to treat their <b>foreign</b> <b>seasonal</b> <b>workers</b> equally to domestic workers, while Australia and New Zealand provide specific rights for their agricultural migrants. Additional protection for <b>seasonal</b> <b>workers</b> is offered within and outside the national framework of both of these countries. In New Zealand for example all <b>foreign</b> <b>seasonal</b> <b>workers</b> are covered by accident compensation, as this protection applies for everyone within the country. Moreover employers in Australia and New Zealand are obliged to provide a specific protection for <b>foreign</b> <b>seasonal</b> <b>workers,</b> labelled as pastoral care. These obligations include providing suitable accommodation, necessary language translation, access to personal banking and an induction program. Pastoral care obligations in these two countries have been a successful way in protecting foreign workers and reducing their vulnerability. Also workers in all four countries are covered by mandatory health insurance.|$|R
3000|$|... cIn Germany only <b>seasonal</b> <b>workers</b> from EU {{countries}} where no restriction measures {{are in place}} (for example Polish workers) are free to choose their employer. For all other <b>foreign</b> <b>seasonal</b> <b>workers</b> the right to freely choose one’s employer is not granted.|$|R
30|$|Second, when US farmers {{expand their}} {{seasonal}} workforce, they add {{value to the}} US economy. In this way, labor mobility differs sharply from a transfer of traditional foreign aid. The degree to which it adds value in the USA depends on {{the degree to which}} the US farmers who hire the workers could achieve the same productivity by substituting other production inputs, such as foreign workers from other countries, domestic workers, or capital. Here, we analyze the effect of an expansion in the <b>foreign</b> <b>seasonal</b> <b>worker</b> stock that is supplied from Haiti, not the substitution of a foreign worker from (say) Mexico with a Haitian worker. Thus, the productivity effect of a new seasonal agricultural worker—from anywhere, but in this case from Haiti—depends on the potential to substitute that foreign labor with domestic labor or capital. The potential for substitution with domestic labor is nonzero but small: Clemens (2013 a) finds that domestic labor supply to similar seasonal agricultural jobs in the state of North Carolina barely changed during the Great Recession—as local unemployment spiked from 4 to 11 %—implying that domestic labor supply to seasonal agricultural jobs is low and inflexible. This corroborates the state and federal Dept. of Labor assessment in the case of the positions held by Haitian workers in this project that US workers could not be recruited. But farmers could nevertheless partially substitute for manual seasonal labor by spending more on other non-labor inputs, which we explore below.|$|E
30|$|Thus, in {{many cases}} <b>foreign</b> <b>seasonal</b> <b>workers</b> in Germany have to {{contribute}} to the unemployment and retirement fund (if not already insured in their home country), but are not eligible to profit from these services.|$|R
30|$|Whereas <b>seasonal</b> <b>worker</b> schemes in Australia and New Zealand {{share many}} similarities, they differ {{significantly}} from the regulations in Germany and France. Most <b>seasonal</b> <b>workers</b> in Germany and France are Polish nationals (the second and third largest groups in France are workers from Tunisia and Morocco), in contrast to Australia and New Zealand {{where the majority of}} <b>foreign</b> <b>seasonal</b> <b>workers</b> (excluding backpackers) are Pacific Islanders. However workers from East Timor are employed in trial sectors in Broome, Western Australia and under the New Zealand scheme workers from selected countries in Asia have been admitted to the RSE programme under the condition that they have a pre-existing relationship with the employer in question. While in Germany and France <b>foreign</b> <b>seasonal</b> <b>workers</b> are taxed as domestic residents, special tax codes were introduced in New Zealand and Australia.|$|R
30|$|<b>Seasonal</b> <b>worker</b> schemes {{facilitate}} {{and regulate}} {{the employment of}} <b>foreign</b> <b>seasonal</b> <b>workers.</b> This article only focuses on employment in the agricultural sector. Most of these workers are employed in labour-intensive areas such as fruit, vegetable and horticulture or viticulture commodities (Martin, 2003 : 20). Their everyday work ranges from harvesting crops to pruning and similar tasks.|$|R
30|$|When {{analysing}} {{the differences}} and similarities of state {{practice in the}} four countries {{it can be concluded}} that total equality of treatment of <b>foreign</b> <b>seasonal</b> <b>workers</b> with domestic workers in all analysed categories is only met by France. But also none of the four countries discriminate in all analysed areas, resulting in a rather complex picture of different level of rights.|$|R
5000|$|People {{who do not}} {{permanently}} {{reside in}} Norway have been assigned a D-number upon registration in the population register. The D-number is like a birth number, but with {{the day of the}} month increased by 40. D comes from the Norwegian name of an authority for sailors, which previously issued those numbers, usually to sailors on board Norwegian ships. Nowadays <b>foreign</b> <b>seasonal</b> <b>workers,</b> for example in the tourist industry, get D-numbers.|$|R
30|$|The {{analysis}} of social protection rights for <b>foreign</b> <b>seasonal</b> <b>workers</b> across Australia, New Zealand, France and Germany {{leads to the}} following conclusion: In the case of work-related rights, especially the right to unionise {{and the right to}} freely choose one’s employer, the doctrine of equal treatment seems to be appropriate as these rights concern the working conditions and rights at one’s workplace which should be the same irrespective of nationality or visa status. Whereas it seems understandable that countries restrict the sector of employment (for example to only horticulture or viticulture), workers should be free to choose their employer within that sector and organise themselves in unions. Concerning social security rights however equal treatment with nationals creates an obligation to pay contribution fees without in most cases being covered by these services. Thus, in order to reflect the specific needs of <b>foreign</b> <b>seasonal</b> <b>workers,</b> three options should be considered: Shortening the qualifying periods, making social security contributions optional or, {{as an alternative to the}} mandatory public coverage, offering separate insurance targeting the specific needs of these workers.|$|R
30|$|This {{article will}} first {{describe}} {{the functioning of}} the <b>seasonal</b> <b>worker</b> programmes in the four countries. Following, the rights of <b>seasonal</b> <b>workers</b> will be embedded in an international human rights framework, explaining which international binding legal obligations in relation to social security and work-related rights exist. Subsequent, the actual state practice and the question in how far these guaranteed rights are in compliance with the previously described international provisions will be analysed. In its third and final part this article examines legally non-binding or not widely ratified provisions in order to determine elements of a best practice set of rights for <b>seasonal</b> <b>workers.</b> For the purpose of this research an optimum level of rights is 3 defined as providing <b>foreign</b> <b>seasonal</b> <b>workers</b> with adequate and customised social protection benefits, {{while at the same time}} minimising the costs for employer and worker. Comparing social protection rights of <b>foreign</b> <b>seasonal</b> <b>workers</b> across four countries provides the opportunity to not only identify similarities and differences, but also allows the identification of features of general relevance in relation to social protection rights. It will be argued that the current state practice of certain countries to make social security contributions mandatory for <b>seasonal</b> <b>workers</b> without enabling them to profit from these services formally complies with international standards but cannot be considered as best practice.|$|R
30|$|Additionally, it {{is often}} argued that <b>foreign</b> <b>seasonal</b> <b>workers</b> should be {{permitted}} to join and actively participate in unions in order to be less vulnerable and thus to be able to bargain for equal and fair working conditions. Both of these rights are vital and connected to each other. Workers might be afraid to join and actively participate in unions because they fear they might lose their job and thus also their residence permits.|$|R
30|$|Overall, <b>seasonal</b> <b>workers</b> in France are, {{under certain}} conditions, {{eligible}} for both unemployment and retirement pensions upon {{the same conditions}} as French nationals. On {{the face of it}} France and Germany seem to restrict the social security rights of <b>seasonal</b> <b>workers</b> less than their Pacific counterparts. However, <b>foreign</b> <b>seasonal</b> <b>workers</b> in Germany are often obliged to contribute to the unemployment and retirement scheme without being able to meet the qualifying periods to access these services. The situation is different in France as <b>seasonal</b> <b>workers</b> enjoy total equality with French nationals {{and at the same time}} are able to meet the qualifying periods to access these services. However contributions are mandatory without the possibility to opt out.|$|R
40|$|In this article, we analyse <b>foreign</b> <b>seasonal</b> {{berry and}} {{vegetable}} pickers’ strategies as regards securing their {{living and working}} conditions in Finland. Farmers are currently dependent on <b>foreign</b> <b>seasonal</b> <b>workers.</b> In spite of the potential gains working in Finland offers to foreign pickers, {{the risks associated with}} the work are diverted to the individual employee. The risks are not shared between the employee and the welfare state, which is regarded as a central feature of the Nordic welfare model. In this precarious situation, ‘weak ties’ become an important source of information and security for the pickers...|$|R
30|$|Summarising, {{the right}} to unionise is granted in all four countries, but {{the right to}} choose one’s {{employer}} is granted to a full extent only in France and New Zealand. However, in Australia labour hire companies and contractors are able to place workers on a different farm (only if workers are not directly employed by the grower) and in Germany Polish workers, who constitute the majority of all <b>foreign</b> <b>seasonal</b> <b>workers,</b> are since 01 May 2011 also able to choose their employer.|$|R
30|$|The union most {{involved}} with <b>foreign</b> <b>seasonal</b> <b>workers</b> is the IG Bau that generally covers workers in agriculture and construction. <b>Seasonal</b> <b>workers</b> are usually tied to their employer {{for the duration}} of their residence permit (IG Bauen-Agrar-Umwelt Bundesvorstand, 2005; Bureau of European Policy Advisers, 2010 : 46), but the case is different for workers from within the EU as they are not required to obtain a residence permit. Since 1 May 2011 the restriction measures that Germany had applied against the new 2004 accession states of the EU have ceased, allowing Eastern European <b>seasonal</b> <b>workers</b> to freely choose their employer. Restrictions on the free movement of workers are currently only applied for Croatian citizens.|$|R
30|$|This article {{analyses}} agricultural <b>seasonal</b> <b>worker</b> {{regulations in}} similar settings (France compared to Germany, and Australia compared to New Zealand) {{as well as}} in different settings (France and Germany compared to Australia and New Zealand) with the aim of identifying crucial social protection rights for <b>foreign</b> <b>seasonal</b> <b>workers.</b> The 2 : 2 case design allows the examination of programs according to the most similar system design as well as according to the most different system design (Rihoux and Ragin, 2008). This comparative research method outlines similarities and differences in social security rights across four countries with the aim of identifying crucial social security provisions that are of general importance for any <b>seasonal</b> <b>worker</b> regulation.|$|R
30|$|While it is {{recommended}} by several international instruments to grant migrants the right to change their employer, two out of the four analysed case countries do not fully comply with this recommendation. 3 However the cases of New Zealand and France demonstrate that a change of policy is possible and works {{for the benefit of}} the workers, without impeding the functioning of the whole scheme. A best practice model for social protection rights of <b>foreign</b> <b>seasonal</b> <b>workers</b> should thus also encompass the right to freely choose one’s employer as well as the right to unionise.|$|R
30|$|The first {{bilateral}} agreements in Germany were signed in 1990, but <b>foreign</b> <b>seasonal</b> <b>workers</b> were already employed on an informal {{basis in the}} years before. Compared to their European counterparts, the <b>seasonal</b> <b>worker</b> regulations in Australia and New Zealand were only recently enacted. In New Zealand the Recognised Seasonal Employer programme was introduced in April 2007 (Maclellan, 2008 : 2) and Australia introduced the Pacific <b>Seasonal</b> <b>Worker</b> Pilot Scheme (PSWPS) in August 2008 for a four-year trial period, which became the permanent <b>Seasonal</b> <b>Worker</b> Programme in July 2012. Seasonal labour migration from the Pacific to New Zealand was common already from the 1950 s onwards. Initially this was not formally managed until in the 1970 s formal schemes were enacted which terminated in 2002 (for more information on New Zealand’s earlier work permit schemes see (Appleyard and Stahl, 1995)).|$|R
30|$|The {{employment}} of <b>foreign</b> <b>seasonal</b> <b>workers</b> is often advocated for filling labour shortages, {{but at the}} same time criticised for being prone to exploiting migrants as cheap labour without granting them sufficient protection. The question of social protection rights of <b>seasonal</b> <b>workers</b> thus seems to be a crucial aspect in determining the success of <b>seasonal</b> <b>worker</b> schemes. This article analyses <b>seasonal</b> <b>worker</b> regulations in Australia, New Zealand, Germany and France. First, the level of protection international law provisions have set in place is examined. Second, the social security and work-related rights the four countries grant their <b>seasonal</b> <b>workers</b> are reviewed. Third, this article draws upon soft law, and legally non-binding or not widely ratified provisions in order to determine elements of a comprehensive set of social protection rights for <b>seasonal</b> <b>workers.</b> In conclusion, the practice of making social security contributions for <b>seasonal</b> <b>workers</b> mandatory without at the same time enabling them to benefit from these contributions is criticised. Therefore, it is recommended that a best practice model should provide for equal treatment with nationals in the area of work-related rights but make social security contributions either optional or shorten the qualifying periods, thus enabling workers to benefit from these services.|$|R
30|$|There is {{no choice}} to choose one’s {{employer}} as the visa of <b>foreign</b> <b>seasonal</b> <b>workers</b> is bound by certain conditions, amongst {{these is the}} requirement that the ‘holder must not cease to be employed by the employer in relation to which the visa was granted’. Even though workers are bound to one employer, the case is more complex when workers are employed by a labour hire company. In that case {{the vulnerability of the}} workers is reduced as the labour hire company is free to place workers on another farm and even in a different region, if the initial grower either goes bankrupt (which has in fact occurred to Tongan workers during the first season of the pilot) or tries to impose abusive working conditions on the migrants.|$|R
30|$|For {{the purpose}} of this {{analysis}} two categories of social protection rights are analysed: work-related rights and social security rights. The examination of social security rights is important because they are often controversial. While {{it can be argued that}} <b>seasonal</b> <b>worker</b> programs are not intended for long-term employment—thus making unemployment and retirement benefits redundant— the experience in European countries demonstrates that some workers are involved in these schemes for up to 20  years. The long-term participants of these schemes should not only be covered by adequate social security rights but also have an interest in avoiding financial contributions for services they are unable to access. The category of work-related rights focusses on the right to choose one’s employer as well as on the right to unionise. The examination of these two rights is crucial because the visa for most <b>foreign</b> <b>seasonal</b> <b>workers</b> ties them to one employer, increasing their vulnerability to abusive employment conditions. It is vital to analyse whether that risk is reasonable and adequate. Unions are able to support workers in difficult situations, educate them about their rights, negotiate employment conditions, act as mediators between workers and employers and are consequently an important stakeholder in protecting the rights of <b>seasonal</b> <b>workers</b> and ensuring their overall wellbeing.|$|R
30|$|The average {{duration}} a <b>seasonal</b> <b>worker</b> spends in {{the host}} country ranges from one or two months in Germany to {{six to nine months}} in the other case countries. Germany employs slightly below 300, 000 <b>foreign</b> <b>seasonal</b> <b>workers,</b> by far the largest number especially when compared to Australia, where only 2, 500 visas were made available under the Pacific <b>Seasonal</b> <b>Worker</b> Pilot Scheme (PSWPS), out of which only 1, 623 were used until April 2012. Under the new permanent scheme, which was enacted in July 2012, more than 10, 450 visas were made available for the duration of four years. The number of <b>seasonal</b> <b>workers</b> under the Recognised Seasonal Employer scheme in New Zealand increased from 2, 800 in the first season in 2007 / 20081 to 6, 200 in 2009 / 2010 and to 9, 000 in 2014 (Bennett and Woodhouse, 2014). The number of workers in France was around 15, 000 on average; however the numbers dropped in France and Germany due to the 2004 EU enlargement round with Polish workers no longer being counted as foreign workers. In France and Germany official recruitment and the issuance of work permits is currently only necessary for third-country nationals as workers from all other Eastern European countries enjoy freedom of movement as citizens of EU member states.|$|R
50|$|Italy is a {{destination}} and transit country for women, children, and men trafficked transnationally {{for the purposes}} of commercial sexual exploitation and forced labor. Women and children are trafficked mainly from Nigeria, Romania, Bulgaria, Moldova, Albania, and Ukraine but also from Russia, South America, North and East Africa, the Middle East, China, and Uzbekistan. Chinese men and women are trafficked to Italy for the purpose of forced labor. Roma children continue to be trafficked {{for the purposes of}} sexual exploitation and forced begging. Reportedly, an increasing number of victims are trafficked for labor, mostly in the agricultural sector. According to one NGO, 90 percent of <b>foreign</b> <b>seasonal</b> <b>workers</b> are unregistered and two-thirds are in Italy illegally, rendering them vulnerable to trafficking. The top five source countries for agricultural workers are Romania, Pakistan, Albania, and Ivory Coast. Traffickers reportedly are moving victims more frequently within Italy, often keeping victims in major cities for only a few months at a time, in an attempt to evade police detection.|$|R
40|$|In {{response}} to the economic crisis of 1973 / 74 the French government curbed the admissions of <b>seasonal</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>workers.</b> By 2010 the curbs have remained in effect, however, the number of foreign workers authorized to work in French seasonal agriculture under “exceptional circumstances” has been growing. The study inquires about the mechanisms and actors responsible for this gradual policy change. It argues that the gradual expansion of <b>seasonal</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>worker</b> policy admissions to France has been possible due to the remarkable ability of fruit and vegetable growers from the province of Bouches-du-Rhône to expand their pro-seasonal foreign worker advocacy and thereby socialize the key policymakers {{to the adoption of}} amendments accounting for gradual policy change...|$|R
40|$|Although <b>seasonal</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>worker</b> admissions to Switzerland and France {{declined}} precipitously after 1986, a {{new generation}} of post-Cold War temporary foreign worker policies has emerged in the European Union. The new policies are quite modest. Germany admits several hundred thousand <b>seasonal</b> <b>workers</b> each year. Spain admits 20, 000 to 30, 000 workers, although most of them actually reside illegally in the country. Preliminary assessment of Spain´s contingents of supposedly recruited foreign workers suggests that the new generation of temporary foreign worker policies went awry, as the postwar generation had by 1973. Other working hypotheses derived from the wisdom of the postwar generation include the expectation that the new policies will result in significant, unexpected settlement, will undermine declared policies of controlling migration, and exacerbate bilateral relations between host and sending societies...|$|R
40|$|During {{the last}} {{economic}} boom period, {{more than half}} of Austria's hotels and restaurants laboured under staff shortages, and only 31 percent felt unaffected by any personnel deficit. The key factors determining recruiting problems were the growth rate and size of an operation and the share of occupational categories as a proportion of overall employment. The strategies pursued by operations to overcome their shortfalls spanned a wide range. Some 19 percent deployed specific recruiting and staff enhancement strategies. This group comprised mostly the large-scale quality operations that expected to achieve above-average growth. Twelve percent had very few specific expectations of their prospective employees and intended to fall back chiefly on <b>foreign</b> and <b>seasonal</b> <b>workers</b> and otherwise mostly failed to develop any proactive strategies to cope with staff bottlenecks. A disproportionate share of this group is made up of winter season operations of the medium quality segment. 22 percent of the operations had not developed any specific requirement profile for their potential staff nor drawn up any detailed strategy to overcome their staff shortage. They recruited mostly from the regional labour market, preferably from the pool of middle-aged workers. The majority of businesses in this group operated solely in the restaurant sector.

30|$|European countries, such as France and Germany, {{have a long}} {{tradition}} of admitting foreign temporary workers through for example the guest worker systems established after the Second World War (Castles, 2006). Their experiences stand in contrast to countries that only recently established <b>seasonal</b> <b>worker</b> schemes, such as New Zealand and Australia. Whereas studies that compare <b>seasonal</b> <b>worker</b> programmes in the United States and Canada with those in Europe have been undertaken, no major comparative study has been conducted between France, Germany and the recent temporary foreign worker programmes of the Pacific (Martin, 2007). A significant number of research papers has analysed specific aspects of individual schemes, such as the development impact of the Recognised Seasonal Employer (RSE) scheme (Gibson et al., 2008; Ramasamy et al., 2008; Gibson and McKenzie, 2010; McKenzie and Gibson, 2010), the low take-up of the Australian pilot scheme (Hay and Howes, 2012), the protection of Pacific <b>seasonal</b> <b>workers</b> in Australia (MacDermott and Opeskin, 2010), and even the differences and similarities between the Australian and New Zealand scheme. But no major comparison has been conducted between Australia and New Zealand in contrast to France and Germany. While France and Germany have a longstanding history of <b>foreign</b> <b>seasonal</b> migration combined with a high intake of workers, Australia and New Zealand only recently established <b>seasonal</b> <b>worker</b> regulations with a comparatively lower intake.|$|R
30|$|In 2002 {{a special}} union {{was created to}} {{represent}} the interests of foreign workers in agriculture: The Collectif de Défense des Travailleurs Etrangers Saisonniers dans l’Agriculture (CODETRAS) serves as a forum to document abusive working conditions of <b>seasonal</b> <b>workers</b> and to provide information and legal advice to the migrants. In collaboration with CODETRAS, <b>seasonal</b> <b>workers</b> {{in the region of}} Bouches-du-Rhône (southeast France) organised a major strike in 2005 to protest against the non-payment of overtime work and bad housing conditions (Bell, 2005), suggesting strong involvement by the unions in the rights of <b>seasonal</b> <b>workers.</b> In 2011 the French Democratic Confederation of Labour (CFDT), which is a national trade union, launched a nationwide bus tour to raise awareness of the rights of <b>seasonal</b> <b>workers</b> and to provide local consultations.
