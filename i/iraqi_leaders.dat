25|$|The RIrAF {{was first}} used in combat against the revolts by tribes in Diwaniya and Rumaytha {{southern}} Iraq in 1934 under order of Bakr Sidqi, where it suffered its first combat loss. Its first combat against another conventional military was in the 1941 Anglo-Iraqi War when the Iraqi government made a bid for full independence following a coup by Rashid Ali against pro-British <b>Iraqi</b> <b>leaders.</b> The RIrAF was destroyed as a fighting force, resulting in an alliance with the Axis which involved Luftwaffe aircraft (painted in Iraqi markings) and Italian Regia Aeronautica aircraft assisting Iraqi ground forces. The German units were Special Staff F and Fliegerführer Irak. However losses, a lack of spares and replacements resulted in their departure, following which the coup was defeated by British forces.|$|E

25|$|According to veteran {{intelligence}} officer Malcolm Nance, al-Douri and the Iraqi Revolutionary Command Council developed deep relations with Hafez al-Assad and the Syrian Ba'ath party, despite historical {{differences between the}} two Ba'ath factions. Al-Douri urged Saddam to open oil pipelines with Syria, building a financial relationship with the Assad family. After the 2003 Invasion of Iraq, al-Douri allegedly fled to Damascus, Syria where he organised the National Command of the Islamic Resistance which co-ordinated major combat operations during the Iraqi insurgency. In 2009, General David Petraeus, who was at the time heading the United States Central Command, told reporters from Al Arabiya that al-Douri was residing in Syria. <b>Iraqi</b> <b>leaders</b> such as former national security advisor Mowaffak al-Rubaie and former Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki have accused the Assad government of harbouring and supporting Iraqi militants.|$|E
500|$|In June, it was {{announced}} that Anbar Province would be the tenth province to transfer to Provincial Iraqi Control, the first such Sunni region. This handover was delayed by bad weather and a suicide bombing on 26 June in Karmah at a meeting between Sunni Sheikhs and US Marines which killed more than 23 people, including three Marines. In July, presidential candidate Barack Obama visited Ramadi and met with Governor Rasheed, Sheikh Abu Rish, and 30 other sheikhs and senior military personnel. In the meeting, Obama promised that [...] "the United States will not abandon Iraq" [...] (his opponent, John McCain, had visited Haditha in March 2008). On 26 August, <b>Iraqi</b> <b>leaders</b> signed the Command and Control Memorandum of Understanding in a ceremony at the Anbar Governance Center, a step towards taking full control and responsibility for security from Coalition forces. Less than a week later, on 1 September, the transition became official.|$|E
2500|$|Before the war, Aziz {{claimed he}} would rather die than be a U.S. {{prisoner}} of war: [...] "Do you expect me, after all my history as a militant and {{as one of the}} <b>Iraqi</b> <b>leaders,</b> to go to an American prison – to go to Guantanamo?

2500|$|UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon {{condemned}} the attack [...] "in the strongest terms", saying attacks on {{places of worship}} are [...] "completely unacceptable" [...] and prohibited under international law.

2500|$|With the {{guidance}} of his chief foreign policy advisor, Danny Sebright, Dean made the war in Iraq a pillar of his campaign. [...] Dean proposed to transfer sovereignty to [...] "credible and legitimate" [...] <b>Iraqi</b> <b>leaders</b> and [...] "encourage the United Nations {{to take responsibility for}} this political transition." [...] Dean also expressed strong support for the War in Afghanistan, saying [...] "One priority should be strengthening our bonds with other countries, especially our historical allies in a world growing ever more interdependent." ...|$|E
2500|$|Several <b>Iraqi</b> <b>leaders,</b> Lebanese arms {{merchant}} Sarkis Soghanalian {{and others}} have claimed that Saddam financed Chirac's party. In 1991 Saddam threatened to expose those who had taken largesse from him: [...] "From Mr. Chirac to Mr. Chevènement, politicians and economic leaders were in open competition {{to spend time with}} us and flatter us. We have now grasped the reality of the situation. If the trickery continues, we will be forced to unmask them, all of them, before the French public." [...] France armed Saddam and it was Iraq's largest trade partner throughout Saddam's rule. Seized documents show how French officials and businessmen close to Chirac, including Charles Pasqua, his former interior minister, personally benefitted from the deals with Saddam.|$|E

2500|$|United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) was an {{inspection}} regime created with {{the adoption of}} United Nations Security Council Resolution 687 in April 1991 to oversee Iraq's compliance with the destruction of Iraqi chemical, biological, and missile weapons facilities and {{to cooperate with the}} International Atomic Energy Agency's efforts to eliminate nuclear weapon facilities all {{in the aftermath of the}} Gulf War. [...] The UNSCOM inspection regime was packaged with several other UN Security Council requirements, namely, that Iraq's ruling regime formally recognize Kuwait as an independent state and pay out war reparations for the destruction inflicted in the Gulf War, including the firing of Kuwaiti oil supplies and destruction of public infrastructure. Until the UN Security Council saw that Iraq's weapons programs had been aborted and <b>Iraqi</b> <b>leaders</b> had allowed monitoring systems to be installed, the UN's aforementioned sanctions would continue to be imposed on Iraq.|$|E
2500|$|Budget {{problems}} {{continued to}} hinder the manning of combat support and {{combat service support}} units. The lack of soldiers entering boot camp is forcing <b>Iraqi</b> <b>leaders</b> at all levels to face the dual challenge of manning and training enabler units out of existing manpower. In the 2015 Pentagon budget, a further $1.3billion has been requested to provide weapons for the Iraqi Army. However, the New York Times reported that [...] "some of the weaponry recently supplied by the army has already {{ended up on the}} black market and in the hands of Islamic State fighters". The same November 2014 article contended that corruption is endemic in the Iraqi Army. It quoted Col. Shaaban al-Obeidi of the internal security forces, who told the paper's David D Kirkpatrick: “Corruption is everywhere." [...] The article claimed that one Iraqi general is known as “chicken guy” because of his reputation for selling the soldiers’ poultry provisions.|$|E
2500|$|On 3 June 1982 Israel's {{ambassador}} to the United Kingdom, Shlomo Argov was shot and seriously wounded in London by terrorists belonging to the Iraqi-backed Abu Nidal terrorist organization. The attack was ordered by the Iraqi Intelligence Service. Following the attack, the assassins drove to the Iraqi embassy in London, where they deposited the weapon. In his memoirs, Sharon stated that the attack was [...] "merely the spark that lit the fuse". Israeli prime Minister Begin used this as the [...] "internationally recognized provocation" [...] necessary to invade Lebanon. The fact that the Abu Nidal organization was the longtime rival of PLO, that its head was condemned to death by the PLO court, and that the British police reported that PLO leaders were on the [...] "hit list" [...] of the attackers did not deter Begin. Iraq's motives for the assassination attempt may have been to punish Israel for its destruction of Iraq's nuclear reactor in June 1981, and to provoke a war in Lebanon that <b>Iraqi</b> <b>leaders</b> calculated would be detrimental to the rival Ba'ath regime in Syria—whether Syria intervened to help the PLO or not! ...|$|E

2500|$|On September 16, 2008, Petraeus {{formally}} gave {{over his}} command in Iraq to General Raymond T. Odierno {{in a government}} ceremony presided by Defense Secretary Robert Gates. During the ceremony, Gates stated that Petraeus [...] "played a historic role" [...] and created the [...] "translation of a great strategy into a great success in very difficult circumstances". Gates also told Petraeus he believed [...] "history will regard you {{as one of our}} nation's greatest battle captains." [...] He presented Petraeus with the Defense Distinguished Service Medal. At the event, Petraeus mentioned the difficulty in getting the Sons of Iraq absorbed in the central Government of Iraq and warned about future consequences if the effort stalls. Indeed, when speaking of these and other challenges, Petraeus is the first to note that [...] "the gains [...] are tenuous and unlikely to survive without an American effort that outlasts his tenure." [...] Even so, as Petraeus departed Iraq, it was clear to all that he was leaving a much different Iraq than the one that existed when he took command in February 2007. As described by Dexter Filkins, [...] "violence has plummeted from its apocalyptic peaks, <b>Iraqi</b> <b>leaders</b> are asserting themselves, and streets that once seemed dead are flourishing with life." [...] This is also illustrated by the Iraq Trends charts that the MNF-I produces weekly. The January 3, 2009, Iraq Trends chart clearly depicts over time, the increases in incidents followed by the sharp decline as described by Dexter Filkens and others.|$|E
