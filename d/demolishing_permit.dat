5000|$|The two 1939/40-built hangars {{remained}} in use until late 1995, {{when they were}} <b>demolished</b> to <b>permit</b> construction of the new Terminal 3.|$|R
50|$|The {{platform}} signage and platform {{objects were}} removed in June 2006 and by December 2008 the platform had been <b>demolished</b> to <b>permit</b> the straightening {{of the track}} and remove a 60mph speed restriction to allow trains to run at 85 mph southbound and 90 mph northbound.|$|R
5000|$|In 1629 {{part of the}} {{fortress}} was <b>demolished</b> to <b>permit</b> the building of Venezia Nuova and San Marco quarters wanted by Ferdinando II. [...] Fortezza Nuova {{has been used for}} military purpose until the end of World war II, inside were built barracks and warehouses and a chapel dedicated to Immaculate Conception.|$|R
50|$|The {{station has}} been unstaffed since September 1989, and the booking {{office on the}} Strood-bound {{platform}} was subsequently <b>demolished.</b> A PERTIS (<b>permit</b> to travel), passenger-operated, self-service ticket machine was installed on the Strood-bound platform in 2007-08.|$|R
50|$|As part of {{the change}} in traction, trains hauled by {{electric}} locomotives reached Dresden from Freiberg {{for the first time in}} September 1966. A good ten years later-on 24 September 1977-the final steam-hauled service departed the station towards Berlin as the Dresden Express. Steam-hauled passenger trains were still seen running towards Upper Lusatia until the late 1980s. Since the headroom in the western {{part of the}} station area was insufficient, the Hohe Brücke (bridge) had to be <b>demolished</b> to <b>permit</b> the electrification of the railway lines.|$|R
5000|$|The old {{urban core}} {{makes up the}} [...] "Historic centre", {{situated}} {{in the district of}} the same name. Novara once had an encircling wall, which was <b>demolished</b> to <b>permit</b> urban development. Of the old wall there remains only the Barriera Albertina, a complex of two neo-classical buildings that constituted the gate of entry to the city, the required passageway for those who traveled from Turin to Milan. After their removal, the walls were replaced by the present-day baluardi, the broad, tree-lined boulevards that surround the Historic Centre.|$|R
50|$|In 2006, the building, {{which had}} been empty for several years, was <b>demolished</b> without a <b>permit,</b> thus {{destroying}} forever an important work by a major architect {{and one of the}} few buildings of this stature east of the LA River. A federal agency had leased the site, and the city building department assumed incorrectly that it had no jurisdiction over development for a federally leased site.|$|R
50|$|Collingwood {{has many}} {{buildings}} {{listed on the}} Victorian Heritage Register and several notable commercial and public buildings. Yorkshire Brewery, built in 1880 {{to the design of}} James Wood, with its polychrome brick and mansard roof tower, was once Melbourne's tallest building. For many years it has been subject to development proposals and the heritage stables were at one stage <b>demolished</b> without a <b>permit,</b> however the site remains neglected.|$|R
50|$|Spring Garden Street {{was built}} {{adjacent}} to the old Philadelphia, Germantown and Norristown Railroad depot at Ninth and Green, which had opened in 1851. Ninth and Green had been the primary Philadelphia terminal of the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad since 1879 and the Reading had outgrown the facility. To replace it, the Reading constructed the Reading Terminal on Market Street, roughly 1 mi to the south. Reading Terminal {{was linked to the}} existing railway line by a new elevated route carried by the Reading Viaduct. Spring Garden Street was built to serve the elevated route. Both it and Reading Terminal opened on January 29, 1893, although the Spring Garden Street station building was not completed and tickets had to be purchased at Ninth and Green. Ninth and Green would remain open as a freight-only building until 1909, when it was <b>demolished</b> to <b>permit</b> additional track elevation.|$|R
5000|$|In 2009, the National Cultural Heritage Act {{was signed}} into law, by the NHCP, stating that {{structures}} at least 50 years old are to receive special {{protection from the}} government. The Alberto house is more than 200 years old. According to the law, such buildings cannot be <b>demolished</b> without a <b>permit</b> from the National Commission for Culture and the Arts or NHCP. As national cultural treasures, {{they are entitled to}} privileges such as [...] "priority government funding for protection, conservation and restoration." [...] Also stated on the law, there should be a Conservation Incentive Program that encourages private individuals to restore and maintain such structures. The law further commands that an official heritage marker be placed by the cultural agency concerned to indicate that the immovable cultural property has been identified as a national historical site.|$|R
6000|$|Byron cared {{as little}} for ancient {{buildings}} {{as he did}} for the authorities, or for patriotic enterprise, but he was stirred to the quick by the marks of fresh and, as he was led to believe, wanton injury to [...] "Athena's poor remains." [...] The southern side of the half-wrecked Parthenon had been deprived of its remaining metopes, which had suffered far less from the weather than the other sides which {{are still in the}} building; all that remained of the frieze had been stripped from the three sides of the cella, and the eastern pediment had been despoiled of its diminished and mutilated, but still splendid, group of figures; and, though five or six years had gone by, the blank spaces between the triglyphs must have revealed their recent exposure to the light, and the shattered edges of the cornice, which here and there had been raised and <b>demolished</b> to <b>permit</b> the dislodgment of the metopes, must have caught the eye as they sparkled in the sun. Nor had the removal and deportation of friezes and statues come to an end. The firman which Dr. Hunt, the chaplain to the embassy, had obtained in 1801, which empowered Elgin and his agents to take away 'qualche pezzi di pietra', still ran, and Don Tita Lusieri, the Italian artist, who remained in Elgin's service, was still, like the 'canes venatici' (Americané, [...] "smell-dogs") employed by Verres in Sicily (see 'Childe Harold', canto ii. st. 12, 'note'), finding fresh relics, and still bewailing to sympathetic travellers the hard fate which compelled him to despoil the temples 'malgré lui'. The feelings of the inhabitants themselves were not much in question, but their opinions were quoted for and against the removal of the marbles. Elgin's secretary and prime agent, W.R. Hamilton, testifies, from personal knowledge, that, [...] "so far from exciting any unpleasant sensations, the people seemed to feel it as the means of bringing foreigners into the country, and of having money spent there" [...] ('Memoir on the Earl of Elgin's Pursuits in Greece', 1811). On the other hand, the traveller, Edward Daniel Clarke, with whom Byron corresponded (see 'Childe Harold', canto ii. st. 12, 'note'), speaks of the attachment of the Turks to the Parthenon, and their religious veneration for the building as a mosque, and tells a pathetic story of the grief of the Disdar when [...] "a metope was lowered, and the adjacent masonry scattered its white fragments with thundering noise among the ruins" [...] ('Travels in Various Countries', part ii, sect. ii, p. 483).|$|R
