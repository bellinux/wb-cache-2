The Consolidation phase categorically aims at training students in the skills of using various tools, techniques and case studies that are required to solve general problems encountered in various functional areas of management. By {{the end of this}} phase, a student should be able to appreciate the general dynamics of problems and situations in differing environmental and organizational settings and develop an approach towards prognosis and problem- shooting. This phase culminates with an eight-week summer-internship in any large organization of repute. The Advanced phase in the third semester concentrates on developing special, function specific competencies in areas of Marketing, International Business, Human Resources Management, Finance and Information Technology. Simultaneously, papers like Management Information Systems and TQM are taught to students irrespective of their area of specialization. By the end of the advanced phase, a student is almost ready for an entry-level position with any large organization. Graduating students spend the final six months of the program in the Concentration phase, learning about the most advanced and complex aspects of their respective functional areas.

40|$|Crystal polymorphism, where a {{molecule}} forms several different crystal lattices, is common, and often {{needs to be}} controlled. For example, crystalline drugs must be manufactured as one specified polymorph, so polymorph purity {{is essential to the}} pharmaceutical industry. This thesis is a quantitative study of the crystallization of glycine from aqueous solution, which focuses particularly on polymorphism. Crystallization is observed within a 96 -well microplate, where each well is filled with 0. 1 mL of supersaturated solution. We address the difficulty of obtaining reproducible nucleation data. This problem is difficult because <b>induction</b> <b>times</b> are extremely sensitive to factors such as how the crystallizing system is prepared, and small variations in the supersaturation. The appropriate statistical tests needed to show reproducibility are discussed. Glycine has two common polymorphs, alpha and gamma, the competition between these polymorphs is studied. We obtain data at multiple NaCl concentrations. Addition of NaCl is known to favour nucleation of the gamma polymorph. The polymorph of crystals are individually identified in-situ using Raman spectroscopy. At high salt concentrations, nucleation kinetics of the alpha and gamma polymorphs are qualitatively different. The gamma polymorph behaves like the hare in Aesop's story of the tortoise and the hare: Nucleation start off rapidly, but slows, while for the alpha polymorph, nucleation starts off slow but at later times almost overtakes that of the gamma polymorph. The opposite time dependencies of the nucleation of the competing polymorphs, allows optimisation of polymorph purity using time-dependent supersaturation. Growth of the two polymorphs is analysed. The alpha polymorph is observed to grow faster than the gamma polymorph. Growth rates were variable, so they were also analysed in relation to <b>induction</b> <b>times</b> and crystal habits. We show that crystals with long <b>induction</b> <b>times</b> tend to be needle-like, and needle-like morphologies tend to grow faster than non needle-like morphologies...|$|R
