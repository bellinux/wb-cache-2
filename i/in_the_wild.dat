5|$|Bottlenose {{dolphins}} {{have been}} known to hybridize with other dolphin species. Hybrids with Risso's dolphin occur both <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wild</b> and in captivity. The best known is the wolphin, a false killer whale-bottlenose dolphin hybrid. The wolphin is fertile, and two currently live at the Sea Life Park in Hawaii. The first was born in 1985 to a female bottlenose. Wolphins also exist <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wild.</b> In captivity, a bottlenose dolphin and a rough-toothed dolphin hybridized. A common dolphin-bottlenose dolphin hybrid born in captivity lives at SeaWorld California. Other hybrids live in captivity around the world and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wild,</b> such as a bottlenose dolphin-Atlantic spotted dolphin hybrid.|$|E
5|$|Elk live 20 {{years or}} more in captivity but average 10 to 13 years <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wild.</b> In some {{subspecies}} that suffer less predation, they may live an average of 15 years <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wild.</b>|$|E

5|$|Along {{with other}} Estrildines, these species {{are thought to}} have {{originated}} in Asia. The species has been introduced {{to other parts of the}} world due to its popularity as a cage bird and populations have established <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wild.</b>|$|E

5|$|Cagebirds such as canaries, budgerigars, cockatoos, lovebirds, quails, finches, and parrots {{are popular}} pets, whether for their song, their behaviour, their {{colourful}} plumage, or {{their ability to}} mimic speech. Among reasons for their popularity {{is that they can}} be kept in homes too small or otherwise unsuitable for dogs or cats. The cagebird trade {{in some parts of the}} world threatens certain species with extinction, when birds are illegally captured <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wild.</b> For example, in Indonesia, at least 13 species are close to extinction including the Indonesian national bird, the Javan hawk-eagle, while five subspecies including the scarlet-breasted lorikeet may have become extinct <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wild.</b>|$|E
5|$|Extremely rare albino individuals, {{sometimes}} called white panthers, also occur among jaguars, {{as with the}} other big cats. As usual with albinos <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wild,</b> selection keeps the frequency close to the rate of mutation.|$|E
5|$|Females become {{sexually mature}} at around {{three or four}} years of age and males at around five; however, males often do not {{successfully}} breed until a few years later. A captive male sired offspring at age 19. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>wild,</b> sea otters live to a maximum age of 23 years, with average lifespans of 10–15 years for males and 15–20 years for females. Several captive individuals have lived past 20 years, and a female at the Seattle Aquarium {{died at the age of}} 28 years. Sea otters <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wild</b> often develop worn teeth, which may account for their apparently shorter lifespans.|$|E

5|$|In October 2010, {{the wild}} condor {{population}} {{in its name}} state of California reached 100 individuals, plus 73 wild condors in Arizona. In November 2011, there were 394 living individuals, 205 of which <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wild</b> and the rest in the San Diego Wild Animal Park, the Los Angeles Zoo, the Oregon Zoo, and the World Center for Birds of Prey in Boise, Idaho. In May 2012, the number of living individuals had reached 405, with 179 living in captivity. By June 2014, the condor population had reached 439: 225 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wild</b> and 214 in captivity. Official statistics from the December 2016 USFWS recorded an overall population of 446, of which 276 are wild and 170 are captive.

5|$|In captivity, pairs {{are known}} to select and clean {{generally}} flattened horizontal or vertical surfaces on which to lay their 1,000 to 3,000 eggs.

5|$|Like {{the other}} big cats, the jaguar is capable of roaring and does so to warn {{territorial}} and mating competitors away; intensive bouts of counter-calling between individuals have been observed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wild.</b> Their roar often resembles a repetitive cough, and they may also vocalize mews and grunts. Mating fights between males occur, but are rare, and aggression avoidance behavior has been observed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wild.</b> When it occurs, conflict is typically over territory: a male's range may encompass that {{of two or three}} females, and he will not tolerate intrusions by other adult males.|$|E
