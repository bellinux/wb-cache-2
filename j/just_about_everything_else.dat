500|$|Critical {{reception}} to {{the episode}} was moderately positive. Zack Handlen from The A.V. Club gave the episode a B+ and wrote positively of Scully's portrayal, noting [...] "Really, this works best as a Scully episode. I prefer Darin Morgan's {{version of the}} character , but I doubt that version could support a full episode about God {{in the same way}} that this more searching, and lost, Scully does." [...] However, Handlen was critical of some of the religious aspects of the episode, noting that [...] "If there's a Christian God in the X-Files universe, doesn't that trump <b>just</b> <b>about</b> <b>everything</b> <b>else</b> that Mulder and Scully have spent their time on?... There are too many implications here for the show to support, and while it doesn't destroy the episode, it does make it difficult for me to back it as fully as I'd like to." [...] John Keegan from Critical Myth gave the episode a 7 out of 10 rating, noting [...] "Overall, this episode highlights Scully and her faith, and in the process, manages to presage many of the future plot developments for the series and her character. The spiritual war at the foundation of the series mythology is reflected in a situation that speaks directly to Scully and her upbringing, and though some of the religious metaphors are heavy-handed, it works well enough." [...] Entertainment Weekly gave the episode a B+ and wrote positively of the episode's [...] "inventiveness," [...] which [...] "derives from its choice of the most mainstream paranormality of all—Christianity." [...] The review also wrote positively of the Mulder-Scully role reversal, calling the change [...] "always welcome". Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a moderately positive review and awarded it two-and-a-half stars out of four. She noted that [...] "Scully's search to reconcile her religious beliefs and her scientific training makes for powerful drama, and Gillian Anderson is up to the challenge." [...] Vitaris, however, criticized elements of the plot, most notably the [...] "un-saintly" [...] quality of Kevin and Kevin's lack of emotion after his mother is killed. Furthermore, she called the ending [...] "a real mess". Not all reviews were positive. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode two stars out of five, and called it a [...] "peculiarly bloodless episode". The two wrote that many of the traits possessed by Kevin were only helpful in certain isolated scenes, such as the ability to bilocate. Shearman and Pearson concluded that the show should [...] "take a serious subject by all means, but then take the subject seriously." ...|$|E

500|$|Variety wrote a {{favorable}} review, noting that Presley [...] "shows improvement as an actor... {{being surrounded by}} a capable crew of performers". The New York Times criticized his acting: the review opened [...] "For Paramount's 'Loving You', starring America's favorite hound-dog hollerer... does <b>just</b> <b>about</b> <b>everything,</b> and little <b>else,</b> {{to prove that it}} ain't—isn't". The Los Angeles Times declared it [...] "A furtive step on Presley's part in a screen career". The Michigan Christian Advocate delivered a negative review and called the film [...] "an apologia for Elvis Presley" [...] and considered it [...] "part of the passing American scene" [...] that would [...] "undoubtedly bore many and interest an equal number".|$|R
