The {{purpose of}} this paper is to develop a novel three-speed <b>geared</b> <b>motor</b> that {{integrates}} a basic epicyclic-type gear train with an exterior-rotor brushless DC (BLDC) motor to form a compact structural assembly.

It provides a wider speed range than the traditional <b>geared</b> <b>motor.</b> Such an integrated design can be appropriately employed in high driving torque and low rotational speed applications or high rotational speed and low driving torque applications...|$|R
40|$|A DC motor's {{performance}} is usually {{characterized by a}} series of tests, which are conducted by pass/fail criteria. In most cases, these tests are adequate to address the performance characteristics under environmental and loading effects with some uncertainties and decent power/torque margins. However, if the motor performance requirement is very stringent, {{a better understanding of the}} motor characteristics is required. The purpose of this paper is to establish a standard way to extract the torque components of the brushless <b>motor</b> and <b>gear</b> box characteristics of a high <b>gear</b> ratio <b>geared</b> <b>motor</b> from the composite <b>geared</b> <b>motor</b> testing and motor parameter measurement. These torque components include motor magnetic detent torque, Coulomb torque, viscous torque, windage torque, and gear tooth sliding torque. The Aerospace Corp bearing torque model and MPB torque models are used to predict the Coulomb torque of the motor rotor bearings and to model the viscous components. Gear tooth sliding friction torque is derived from the dynamo <b>geared</b> <b>motor</b> test data. With these torque data, the <b>geared</b> <b>motor</b> mechanical efficiency can be estimated and provide the overall performance of the <b>geared</b> <b>motor</b> versus several motor operating parameters such as speed, temperature, applied current, and transmitted power...|$|R
40|$|The wabble gear {{principle}} {{was applied}} {{in the design of}} a driving mechanism for controlling spacecraft solar panels.

The two gears mesh face to face such that engagement takes place at one point along the circumference. The <b>driving</b> <b>gear</b> is not permitted to rotate by virtue of its attachment through the bellows which permits flexure in the pitch and yaw position, but not in roll. As the bearing carrier rotates, the inclined mounting of the bearing causes the <b>driving</b> <b>gear</b> to perform a wabbling, irrotational motion. This wabbling motion causes the contact point between the output <b>gear</b> and the <b>driving</b> <b>gear</b> to traverse around the circumference of the gears once per revolution of the bearing carrier...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: A {{field of}} {{research}} which deals with tactile sensation is called haptics. Many researchers have been investigated haptics in recent years. In the past research, 4 ch bilateral controller based on torque/force sensorless approach is developed so as to achieve high transparency as teleoperation systems. In actual system with <b>geared</b> <b>motor,</b> however, the high transparency leads to instability because of disturbances. In particular, the <b>geared</b> <b>motor</b> has a large joint friction which affects the torque/force sensorless control, though its cost is low. This means that the high quality of tactile sensation is not expected in case the <b>geared</b> <b>motor</b> is used in experimental system. To improve the effect of friction, linear motor is often utilized in the past research, though its cost is high. To address this issue, this paper focuses on a novel control strategy to realize low cost teleoperation systems based on the <b>geared</b> <b>motor,</b> that is, master and slave systems. To reduce the effect of joint friction, a novel approach to master and slave control by force feedback based virtual impedance controller is proposed. By using the proposed method, position and force controllers can be designed independently {{and it is one}} of remarkable features. To verify the validity of proposed method, the performance of the controller is analyzed and evaluated by using “Reproducibility ” and “Operationality”. Furthermore experimental validation is conducted with 1 -DOF manipulator...|$|R

40|$|Fractographic study {{confirmed}} that the <b>driving</b> <b>gear</b> of the multiplicator had failed by fatigue. There was multiple fatigue crack initiation and in all the cases, the fatigue crack had initiated at the tooth root. In two cases, the teeth got fractured and lost by tooth bending fatigue. In another case, after initiation, the fatigue crack had propagated into {{the hub of the}} gear and continued propagation further along the hub fillet. After propagation to a critical length, this fatigue crack had resulted in fracturing of a segment of the gear. Following this fracture, the impact with the input gear of the gear cluster had resulted in second fracture and chewing off of remaining teeth in the <b>driving</b> <b>gear.</b> Subsequently, the gear assembly had seized leading to torsional overload failure of the quill shaft transmitting power from the AGB to the multiplicator. The fatigue failure in the <b>driving</b> <b>gear</b> appears to be stress related. Evidences suggest that probably, the load on the gear assembly was more than the usual. The power transmission system down the multiplicator needs to be examined as a whole for establishing the cause(s) for excessive load on the gear assembly...|$|R

50|$|A <b>gear</b> <b>motor</b> (external <b>gear)</b> {{consists}} of two gears, the driven gear (attached to the output shaft {{by way of a}} key, etc.) and the idler gear. High pressure oil is ported into one side of the gears, where it flows around the periphery of the gears, between the gear tips and the wall housings in which it resides, to the outlet port. The gears then mesh, not allowing the oil from the outlet side to flow back to the inlet side. For lubrication, the <b>gear</b> <b>motor</b> uses a small amount of oil from the pressurized side of the gears, bleeds this through the (typically) hydrodynamic bearings, and vents the same oil either to the low pressure side of the gears, or through a dedicated drain port on the motor housing. An especially positive attribute of the <b>gear</b> <b>motor</b> is that catastrophic breakdown is less common than in most other types of hydraulic motors. This is because the gears gradually wear down the housing and/or main bushings, reducing the volumetric efficiency of the motor gradually until it is all but useless. This often happens long before wear causes the unit to seize or break down.|$|R
