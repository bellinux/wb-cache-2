40|$|Background: Interaction {{effects of}} poverty and <b>health</b> <b>care</b> {{insurance}} <b>coverage</b> on overall survival rates of breast cancer among women of color and non-Hispanic white women were explored. Methods: We analyzed California registry data for 2, 024 women of color (black, Hispanic, Asian, Pacific Islander, American Indian, or other ethnicity) and 4, 276 non-Hispanic white women (Anglo-European ancestries and no Hispanic-Latin ethnic backgrounds) {{diagnosed with breast cancer}} between the years 1996 and 2000 who were then followed until 2011. The 2000 US census categorized rates of neighborhood poverty. <b>Health</b> <b>care</b> insurance <b>coverage</b> was either private, Medicare, Medicaid, or none. Cox regression was used to model rates of survival. Results: A 3 -way interaction between ethnicity, <b>health</b> <b>care</b> insurance <b>coverage,</b> and poverty was observed. Women of color inadequately insured and living in poor or near-poor neighborhoods in California were the most disadvantaged. Women of color adequately insured and who lived in such neighborhoods in California were also disadvantaged. The incomes of such women of color were typically lower than the incomes of non-Hispanic white women. Conclusions: Women of color with or without insurance coverage are disadvantaged in poor and near-poor neighborhoods of California. Such women may be less able to bare the indirect, direct, or uncovered costs of <b>health</b> <b>care</b> for breast cancer treatment...|$|R
40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of this study is to explore factors and {{contexts}} that influenced and motivated individuals to enroll in the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The ACA, commonly called Obamacare, is also known as the New Mexico Health Insurance Exchange (NMHIX). The study is specifically designed to examine the participants’ lived experiences and opinions regarding the acquisition, or opposition to <b>health</b> <b>care</b> insurance <b>coverage.</b> I have employed the hermeneutic phenomenological research methodology to conduct this study. Nine self-identified Hispanic residents of the San Miguel County (SMC) participated in semi-structured in-depth interviews. The research site for the current study was the SMC located in northern New Mexico (NM). The major findings in this study revealed the following response patterns: (a) participant’s memory of having <b>health</b> <b>care</b> insurance while growing up was divided among those that had <b>health</b> <b>care</b> insurance and those who did not have <b>health</b> <b>care</b> insurance or those who had state supported <b>health</b> <b>care</b> insurance such as Medicaid; (b) Trusted sources such as family and friends are methods that were used to obtain and learn about the NMHIX; (c) Mandate and penalty assessments for not having the <b>health</b> <b>care</b> insurance <b>coverage</b> was the number one motivational factor to enrolling in the NMHIX; (d) Participants had more negative experiences than positive in the enrollment process; (e) Nearly 90 % of the respondents felt they have benefited from having <b>health</b> <b>care</b> insurance <b>coverage,</b> and; (f) The findings revealed that if participants had the authority to change something with <b>health</b> <b>care</b> insurance <b>coverage,</b> participants would like co-payments and deductibles reduced or eliminated. The results of this research provide a venue to strengthen the implementation of the ACA. In addition, there may be the notion to rethink and systematize ideas that enable and support local communities to operate as health communication channels aiding citizens navigate the optimal use of <b>health</b> <b>care</b> insurance.

25|$|In addition, {{the number}} of {{employers}} who offer health insurance has declined and costs for employer-paid health insurance are rising: from 2001 to 2007, premiums for family coverage increased 78%, while wages rose 19% and prices rose 17%, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Even {{for those who are}} employed, the private insurance in the US varies greatly in its coverage; one study by the Commonwealth Fund published in Health Affairs estimated that 16 million U.S. adults were underinsured in 2003. The underinsured were significantly more likely than those with adequate insurance to forgo health care, report financial stress because of medical bills, and experience coverage gaps for such items as prescription drugs. The study found that underinsurance disproportionately affects those with lower incomes—73% of the underinsured in the study population had annual incomes below 200% of the federal poverty level. However, a study published by the Kaiser Family Foundation in 2008 found that the typical large employer preferred provider organization (PPO) plan in 2007 was more generous than either Medicare or the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program Standard Option.
