40|$|The recent {{oil spill}} {{disaster}} in the Gulf of Mexico and ensuing questions of accountability have brought a controversial legal tool to the forefront, the “responsible corporate officer doctrine. ” This doctrine allows courts to hold individuals who exercise control over business policies or activities personally liable for failing to prevent statutory offenses by subordinates, even if they themselves {{were not aware of}} any wrongdoing. For corporate officials, the RCO doctrine is dangerous because of its ability to sidestep the usual requirements that apply to holding corporate agents responsible. Moreover, from their viewpoint, the doctrine is troubling in that it extends statutory duties of legal entities to their “responsible corporate officers” as an additional class of defendants. Examined from a broader perspective, the RCO doctrine may also result in additional costs, contribute to overdeterrence, and undermine the notion of limited liability. This Article explains how the RCO doctrine runs contrary to established tort, criminal, and corporate law principles and why it represents an unwarranted augmentation of corporate agents’ duties. It then proceeds to explain that current justifications of the doctrine are not convincing and explores the doctrine’s negative effects. Finally, the Article advances the idea of a “cautious approach” to applying the RCO doctrine, arguing that legislatures and courts should reduce the RCO doctrine to rare and clearly delineated instances of statutory liability for <b>intentional</b> or knowing <b>misconduct.</b> Peer-reviewedPublisher Versio...|$|R
5000|$|McKeon was {{defended by}} a group of {{volunteer}} lawyers from New York City including his brother in law, Thomas P. Costello, Emile Zola Berman and Howard Lester as well as Marine Corps attorneys, Lieutenant Colonel Alaric W. Valentin, Major John R. DeBarr and Lieutenant Collins. Emile Zola Berman was the lead counsel. He was a distinguished and successful trial attorney, specializing in negligence cases but he was also dedicated to preserving the constitutional rights of the criminally accused. In addition to representing Sergeant McKeon, he presented a successful criminal defense in 1964 in Alexandria, La. of a 14 year old African American boy charged with rape. He joined the defense team for Sirhan Sirhan when asked to do so, also as a volunteer and without compensation. [...] McKeon was defended by colorful civilian attorney Emile Zola Berman, who would later go on to defend Sirhan Sirhan. Berman put on a vigorous defense that swayed both the court and public opinion. Marine Corps Commandant General Randolph Pate testified. One reporter pointed out this was like [...] "calling J. Edgar Hoover to testify about a problem within the FBI". The trial's most dramatic moment, however, was the arrival of General Lewis [...] "Chesty" [...] Puller, the most decorated Marine {{in the history of the}} Corps. Berman called Puller to testify about training methods. Puller called the incident in Ribbon Creek [...] "a deplorable accident" [...] but one that did not warrant court martial. He said that discipline was the most important factor in military training. He quoted Napoleon in saying that an army becomes a [...] "mob" [...] without it. He mentioned his experiences in the Korean War and that one of the reasons troops failed was because of lack of night training. General Puller felt that the press had blown the incident out of proportion because of prejudice they had against the Marine Corps. He mentioned a similar accident at an Army post in which ten soldiers drowned and pointed out that none of their superiors had been charged and that it had never made headlines the way Ribbon Creek did. [...] In the end, McKeon was acquitted of manslaughter and oppression of troops. He was found guilty of negligent homicide and drinking on duty. The Secretary of the Navy, Charles S. Thomas, wrote in his final action on the case that [...] "The members of the court-martial, acting in their capacity of the equivalent to jurors in civil courts, acquitted the accused not only of all <b>intentional</b> or willful <b>misconduct</b> toward the men under his command, but acquitted him also of 'culpable' negligence with respect to the loss of life. if the accused had been found guilty of either of these two much more serious types of misconduct, i.e., 'oppression' or 'culpable' negligence, a reduction in the sentence would not be deserved, and would condone such serious misconduct. On the basis of the court's findings, however, this case presents to me the problem of adjudging an appropriate sentence for 'simple' negligence, which is not generally regarded by law or society as nearly so blameworthy as the much more serious types of misconduct classified as culpable negligence or intentional misconduct......Simple negligence is not 'bad conduct' in the normal meaning of the term 'bad', nor in the military connotation of that term. A bad conduct discharge therefore appears inappropriate in that respect. [...] "In reducing the sentence and allowing Sergeant McKeon to stay in the Corps, Secretary Thomas asked if a bad conduct discharge was appropriate [...] "under the circumstances of the principal offense for which he was convicted, which is negligent homicide based upon simple negligence." [...] Secretary Thomas further noted the following: [...] "There is no question in my mind that his entire record prior to 8 April 1956 indicated that Sergeant McKeon was a capable non-commissioned officer, dedicated to the United States Marine Corps. More than that, the testimony pictures him as a good man, sincere, and of a sympathetic nature. He has always attended church regularly. Even though he was relatively inexperienced as a drill instructor, his general reputation was excellent. I could not help but be impressed how recruit after recruit, who were in his platoon, who had followed him on that fatal night march, testified concerning his character. They were initially prosecution witnesses, and their testimony had the ring of sincerity. All of them, college men and men with little schooling, described him as a 'very patient man', an 'extremely patient man'. A number of them stated he helped them with their personal problems. He was always ready to give his recruits 'the breaks'. I, in my mind, am sure that Sergeant McKeon never meant to harm his men. I am convinced that a punitive separation from the service is not necessary as punishment for this man, nor would the interests of the Marine Corps be served by such a separation. For him I believe that the real punishment will be always the memory of Ribbon Creek on Sunday night, April 8, 1956. Remorse will never leave him....He may be expected to appreciate the feelings of those whose sons were lost that fateful night. His conduct immediately following the loss, and the spontaneous statements he made at the time, speak eloquently of remorse. For all the foregoing reasons, I have determined that the bad conduct discharge should be remitted." [...] Thus the Secretary of the Navy reduced the sentence, remitted the bad conduct discharge and allowed Sergeant McKeon to remain in the Corps with a reduced rank to private. Prior to the reduction by Secretary Thomas, the sentence was a $270 fine, 9 months of confinement at hard labor, rank reduced to private and a bad conduct discharge.|$|R

40|$|The {{focus of}} this article is on the {{difficulty}} of securing in personam jurisdiction over foreign entities who steal information technology and intellectual property (IT and IP). The value of stolen IT and IP is somewhere in the range of a trillion dollars over the last decade. Given the current inability to prevent those losses or deter meaningfully those engaged in the misconduct, the article explores the core of the problem: the difficulty of satisfying the minimum contact/fairness requirements of Article III courts. The article addresses several alternative approaches that might allow for more efficient protection of IT and IP. The first is an examination of Calder-effect jurisdiction based on the wrongfulness of the conduct. Characterized as IP and IT thieves, defendants fall in a special jurisdictional category: jurisdiction over perpetrators of <b>intentional</b> <b>misconduct,</b> allowing for a different jurisdictional calculus. A second approach, now underway in Massachusetts and California, is state initiated unfair trade enforcement actions. A final approach is for the Federal Trade Commission to initiate enforcement actions or issue rules or guidelines to help curb IT and IP theft. Any of the approaches, if successful, will have a stabilizing effect on the competitive market and can help avoid the loss of another trillion dollars in the next decade...|$|E
40|$|This Article {{explores the}} {{narrative}} that the scholarly literature on wrongful convictions uses {{to talk about}} prosecutors. In the prevailing narrative of the wrongful conviction literature, stories of bad prosecutorial decision making in the cases against Genarlow Wilson, the Jena Six, and three Duke lacrosse players are merely high-profile examples of misconduct that happens every day in America’s prosecutors’ offices and courtrooms. What emerges from the current discourse on wrongful convictions is a language of fault — fault placed on prosecutors who fail to value justice at each turn of the proceedings. Separate from the empirical question of how widespread <b>intentional</b> <b>misconduct</b> is among prosecutors, this Article questions the efficacy of fault-based rhetoric {{in a world in}} which prosecutors view wrongful convictions as statistical anomalies, their antagonists as uncommonly bad apples, and themselves as ethical lawyers. The rhetoric of fault is counterproductive because it alienates the very parties who hold the power to initiate many of the most promising reforms of the movement. In contrast, this Article suggests the use of a “no-fault” rhetoric that focuses on structural and cognitive impediments to neutral prosecutorial decision-making. A “no-fault” rhetoric that emphasizes how even ethical prosecutors might inadvertently contribute to wrongful convictions carries the potential to fold prosecutors into the movement while simultaneously pressuring them to initiate self-focused reform...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the last}} few years, there {{seems to have been}} a concerted effort to {{discredit}} the prosecutorial profession. A few news organizations, including the Chicago Tribune and USA Today, have issued results of unscientific surveys that attempt to demonstrate that prosecutorial misconduct is a significant issue in the federal courts as well as in some state courts. None of these surveys has been able to uncover any but the rarest instances of <b>intentional</b> <b>misconduct</b> by prosecutors, state or federal. Most of these reports succumb to their own inaccuracies and die a natural death. One recent report, however, has managed to gain some public traction. The Northern California Innocence Project 2 ̆ 7 s Veritas Initiative conducted and published a 2 ̆ 2 study 2 ̆ 2 referred to generally as the 2 ̆ 2 NCIP Report. 2 ̆ 2 This initial lengthy document, Preventable Error: A Report on Prosecutorial Misconduct in California, 1997 - 2009, was followed up by an 2 ̆ 2 addendum 2 ̆ 2 of the same data: the First Annual Report: Preventable Errors- Prosecutorial Misconduct in California 2010.

40|$|Post-conviction DNA {{testing has}} led to the exoneration of nearly three hundred defendants. As the number of exonerations grows, we are in an era where the once unthinkable is now undeniable. We convict the {{innocent}}. We imprison the innocent. We place the innocent on death row. Daniel Medwed brings this reality to life in his captivating book, Prosecution Complex, which carefully documents the myriad ways that prosecutors can contribute to wrongful convictions at every stage of a criminal case. From the charging decision to plea bargaining to trial to post-conviction, Medwed argues, prosecutors face an “ongoing schizophrenia” as they seek to balance dual roles in the criminal justice system, trying to serve both as zealous advocates for the government and as neutral ministers of justice. This book essay offers three lessons that can be gleaned from Medwed’s central thesis that prosecutors must struggle to balance their dual roles as advocates and ministers of justice. Two of these lessons are for prosecutors: 1) that the protection of justice means not only the protection of the innocent, but also the fostering of a fair process, and 2) that prosecutors can mitigate the possibility that they will contribute to a wrongful conviction by seeking out contrary voices that foster neutral decision-making. The third lesson, aimed at the wrongful convictions movement, is to avoid a language of fault, which has a tendency to focus reform efforts on <b>intentional</b> <b>misconduct</b> and to signal to virtuous prosecutors that they need not worry that they may contribute to a wrongful conviction. Prosecution Complex is a significant book that should be read by any scholar, lawyer, or layperson who cares about criminal justice. But its most essential audience is prosecutors themselves, who hold the key to the most feasible and important reforms in the prevention of erroneous convictions...|$|E
40|$|After the exoneration of {{more than}} 200 people based on post-conviction DNA evidence, a growing {{movement}} against wrongful convictions has called increased attention to the prosecutorial suppression of material exculpatory evidence. Commentators frequently study prosecutorial failures to disclose {{as a form of}} <b>intentional</b> <b>misconduct,</b> coloring both the description of the problem and the recommended solutions. This Article, in contrast, explores how even ethical prosecutors might fail to disclose exculpatory evidence because off laws in the Brady doctrine itself-specifically, the Court 2 ̆ 7 s limitation of the doctrine to 2 ̆ 2 material 2 ̆ 2 exculpatory evidence. The materiality standard amplifies cognitive biases that distort even an ethical prosecutor 2 ̆ 7 s application of Brady, leading to systematic under disclosures of exculpatory evidence. The doctrine also inflates the tension between a prosecutor 2 ̆ 7 s dual obligations to protect the innocent while punishing the guilty, causing conscientious prosecutors to conclude they are 2 ̆ 2 doing justice 2 ̆ 2 by suppressing exculpatory evidence that {{does not appear to be}} material. Accordingly, it is the doctrine itself that must be reexamined. This Article proposes a prophylactic open file rule to effectuate defendants 2 ̆ 7 Brady rights. This doctrinal move would expand defendants 2 ̆ 7 federal constitutional rights to discovery, while respecting the Court 2 ̆ 7 s long-established view that only access to material exculpatory evidence is essential to due process. The Article situates the proposal within a jurisprudence of constitutional criminal procedure that often favors clear rules over open-ended standards, and compares the current need to safeguard defendants 2 ̆ 7 Brady rights to the necessity more than forty years ago to shift to a rule based approach in Miranda v. Arizona to regulate custodial interrogations...|$|E
40|$|<b>Intentional</b> <b>misconduct</b> {{frequently}} has extraterritorial consequences. Terrorist attacks, toxic pollution, {{civil rights}} violations, and other intentional torts can cause harm within a state despite originating outside the state. Those harms raise a vexing constitutional question: when do the local effects of intentional wrongdoing authorize personal jurisdiction over a defendant whose conduct occurred outside the forum? The answer has several significant implications. Granting or denying jurisdiction allocates power between {{states in a}} way that can support or undermine regulatory interests, imposes burdens on the parties that can impede access to justice, and alters risk assessments that shape both socially desirable and socially destructive behavior. The jurisdictional dilemma posed by the in-state effects of out-of-state conduct is timeless and timely. It is timeless because it has arisen in thousands of cases and is an unavoidable feature of a federal system that allocates judicial power between fifty coequal states. It is timely because the Supreme Court’s 2014 decision in Walden v. Fiore directly addressed effects jurisdiction {{for the first time since}} 1984. This Article critiques Walden and proposes a new approach to the broader constitutional question by focusing on five conclusions. First, it illustrates how Walden relies on a distinction between a defendant’s contacts with the forum state and a defendant’s contacts with the forum’s residents. Second, it critiques the forum/resident distinction as imprecise, misleading, and a revival of the formality that plagued nineteenth-century personal jurisdiction jurisprudence. It also offers a new account of Chief Justice Stone’s reasoning in International Shoe, a case about enforcing taxes, by comparing Shoe to Stone’s strikingly similar opinion in a case about imposing taxes. The comparison highlights Shoe’s hostility toward the sort of formality that animates Walden. Third, it contends that lower courts might salvage the Court’s emphasis on forum contacts by focusing on the defendant’s contacts with the forum’s law, in effect merging constitutional limits on the state’s legislative and judicial power. Fourth, it suggests that state regulatory interests are more important than commonly recognized when local effects are severe, such as an Ebola quarantine. Fifth, it proposes a new approach to analyzing jurisdiction by considering whether actors who commit intentional torts without a geographic focal point assume the risk of being sued wherever harm occurs. These conclusions suggest that Walden’s reasoning would be misleading if read literally and a contextually. The opinion leaves more room for exercising jurisdiction in effects cases than its dismissive veneer implies...|$|E

Finding ways to minimize litigation-related costs and ensure the use of accurate and consistent information by its lawyers is a significant issue for GM and other automotive manufacturers. To achieve this goal, GM is exploring ways to strengthen the sharing of knowledge and expertise by using a combination of technology tools and knowledge management techniques in sponsoring communities of practice (CoPs). The goal of this dissertation was to conduct a case study investigation that documented and evaluated the implementation by GM legal staff of an online collaboration system (OCS) to support legal CoPs. This research was conducted to answer the question as to whether the implementation of an OCS would result in an improvement of knowledge sharing, communication, and collaboration activities among members of CoPs. The research included validation that the participants under investigation acted as sponsored CoPs. The research also included validation that the software tool utilized in this investigation met the requirements of an OCS. Consequently, the activities and value of the OCS environment were measured (a) quantitatively by the frequency of community activities and (b) qualitatively by the perceived value of the activities as measured by members of the CoPs. The results of this case study research add to the existing body of knowledge in several areas: clarifying the effectiveness of CoPs in knowledge sharing, identifying the benefits and limitations of sponsored CoPs, and evaluating the effectiveness of an OCS in providing support to CoPs. Recommendations for sponsored CoPs and the use of an OCS in the legal domain are also provided...|$|E
