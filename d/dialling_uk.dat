50|$|Prior to the {{introduction}} of Subscriber Trunk Dialling, most Group Switching Centres housed operators in an Auto Manual Centre (AMC) who were able to place any calls for subscribers in the local area that could not be directly dialled. Operators continued to be used after {{the introduction}} of Subscriber Trunk Dialling albeit on a reducing basis as direct dialled routings became increasingly available until universal direct <b>dialling</b> between <b>U.K</b> subscribers became available in 1979 via the Trunk Transit Network.|$|R
50|$|An earlier {{modification}} to get round {{this problem}} for European dialling was {{the addition of}} the letter Q to the digit 0, which previously represented only the letter O. This was because some French exchanges had alphabetic codes including Q, but in the event France moved to all-digit codes before direct <b>dialling</b> from the <b>UK</b> was introduced.|$|R
50|$|In 2011, The Chris Moyles Show on BBC Radio 1 parodied {{the show}} with a feature called 'Disastermind'. Using the back-up chair from the Mastermind studio, each team member chose a {{specialist}} subject, only to have them swapped before being questioned in the chair on their randomly selected subject and general knowledge. The specialist subjects were The World of Glee; <b>UK</b> <b>Dialling</b> Codes; U2; Husky Dogs and Back to the Future.|$|R
5000|$|In the June 2008 'Radio World International Edition' (Volume 36 #2) {{the station}} was {{described}} thus, [...] "There is nothing quite like it on the <b>U.K.</b> <b>dial.</b> It is the perfect antidote for complaints about high rotation playlists, or that all stations these days sound much the same. This one certainly does not. Phonic.fm is a genuinely refreshing, genuine alternative, from which the best is yet to come" ...|$|R
5000|$|The United Kingdom adopts an open {{dialling}} plan for area codes within its public switched telephone network. Therefore, all area codes have a preceding [...] "0" [...] when dialling {{from within the}} United Kingdom. When <b>dialling</b> a <b>UK</b> number from abroad, the zero must be omitted. Because of this, it has become common (but incorrect) practice to write telephone numbers used both nationally and internationally with the 0 in parentheses, for example: +44 (0) 20 7946 0234; if the number is dialled with the parenthesised zero, the call will fail. ITU-T Recommendation E.123 states that parentheses {{should not be used}} in the international notation, the correct format being +44 20 7946 0234; the in-country form would be 020 7946 0234, shown separately.|$|R
50|$|Until STD was introduced, only {{telephone}} operators could connect calls {{over the}} trunks (long distance links between major exchanges). A subscriber {{would have to}} dial 0 for the operator and then request a long distance call. As STD was introduced area by area {{the meaning of the}} 0 changed; it was now the trunk prefix used to raise a call automatically to the trunk dialling level, what telephone companies now call a National call. The new code of 100 was introduced for calling an operator. The leading 0 is not part of an area code, which is why international callers <b>dialling</b> into the <b>UK</b> must not <b>dial</b> it.|$|R
5000|$|... 111 was {{specifically}} {{chosen to be}} similar to Britain's 999 service. With pulse dialling, New Zealand telephones pulse in reverse to the <b>UK</b> - <b>dialling</b> 0 sent ten pulses, 1 sent nine, 2 sent eight, 3 sent seven, etc. in New Zealand, while in the <b>UK,</b> <b>dialling</b> 1 sent one pulse, 2 sent two, etc. In the early years of 111, the telephone equipment was based on British Post Office equipment, except for this unusual orientation. Therefore, dialling 111 on a New Zealand telephone sent three sets of nine pulses to the exchange, exactly the same as UK's 999. Number [...] "9" [...] in New Zealand (or [...] "1" [...] in Britain) was not used for the start of telephone numbers because of the likelihood of accidental false calls from open-wire lines tapping together etc.|$|R
