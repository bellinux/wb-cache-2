50|$|The {{development}} of the videocassette followed the replacement by cassette of other open-reel systems in consumer items: the Stereo-Pak 4-track audio cartridge in 1962, the compact audio cassette and Instamatic film cartridge in 1963, the 8-track cartridge in 1965, and the Super 8 home movie cartridge in 1966.Before {{the invention of the}} video tape recorder, live video was recorded onto motion picture film stock in a process known as telerecording or <b>kinescoping.</b> Although the first quadruplex VTRs record with good quality, the recordings cannot be slowed or freeze-framed, so <b>kinescoping</b> processes continued to be used for about a decade after the {{development of}} the first VTRs.|$|E
5000|$|While it {{is unclear}} if any episodes survive of this series, {{it is certain that}} none of the 1946 episodes survive, as NBC did not start <b>kinescoping</b> its {{programs}} until 1947, and even then only a few series were recorded.|$|E
50|$|Although {{examples}} of WABD's local shows {{are known to}} exist from {{as far back as}} 1948, such as Swing Into Sports and Photographic Horizons, none are known to exist from 1947. The series is most likely lost, and likely was never kinescoped in the first place, as <b>kinescoping</b> was still a very new technology.|$|E
50|$|There is no {{information}} available as to whether any <b>kinescope</b> recordings (also known as telerecordings) exist of the series (<b>kinescope</b> recording/telerecording being the method used to record live television in Australia prior {{to the introduction of}} video-tape). However, it is confirmed that <b>kinescopes</b> exist of rival series Hit Parade.|$|R
25|$|Episode #195 (February 21, 1954) only exists among {{collectors}} from {{a secondary}} <b>kinescope,</b> {{as the official}} <b>kinescope</b> was missing from the Goodson-Todman archive.|$|R
50|$|As {{with most}} DuMont series, no episodes {{are known to}} exist. <b>Kinescopes</b> of daytime {{television}} of the 1940s are exceptionally rare, as are <b>kinescopes</b> of local programming (since <b>kinescopes</b> were intended for time-delay purposes, all U.S. stations saw little need to record local programming, and this would remain the case for years).|$|R
50|$|In <b>kinescoping</b> an NTSC signal, 525 {{lines are}} {{broadcast}} in one frame. A 35 mm or 16 mm camera exposes one frame of film {{for every one}} frame of television (525 lines), and moving a new frame of film into place during the time equivalent of one field of television (131.25 lines). In the British 405-line television system, the French 819-line television system and the European 625-line television system, television ran at 25 frames—or more correctly, 50 fields—per second, so the film camera would also be run at 25 frames per second rather than the cinematic film standard of 24 frames.|$|E
50|$|In later years, {{film and}} {{television}} producers were often reluctant to include <b>kinescope</b> footage in anthologies because of its inherent inferior quality. While {{it is true that}} <b>kinescopes</b> did look inferior to live transmissions in the 1950s, it was due to the industry's technical limitations at that time. Even the best live transmission could look hazy by the time it reached the home viewer. Advances in broadcast technology soon allowed for a wider gray scale in black-and-white, and a fuller spectrum of colors, making <b>kinescopes</b> a perfectly viable commodity. This was demonstrated in the feature film Ten from Your Show of Shows, a compilation of Sid Caesar <b>kinescopes</b> released to theaters. Reviewers were astonished at how good the <b>kinescoped</b> image looked on a large screen. <b>Kinescopes</b> have since lost their stigma of inferiority, and are commonly consulted today for archival purposes.|$|R
50|$|Although it was <b>kinescoped</b> {{in order}} to be shown in Sydney, it is not known if the <b>kinescope</b> still exists. The UK version is lost.|$|R
5000|$|Early Australian {{television}} {{drama series}} were recorded as <b>kinescopes,</b> such as Autumn Affair and Emergency, along with variety series like The Lorrae Desmond Show. <b>Kinescopes</b> {{continued to be}} made after video-tape was introduced to Australia; most existing episodes of the 1965-1967 children's series Magic Circle Club are <b>kinescopes</b> (per listings for episodes on National Film and Sound Archive website) ...|$|R
50|$|A {{very brief}} excerpt {{appeared}} in a mid-1960s television special about Australian television. The excerpt appears on YouTube. This indicates {{that at least one}} of the episodes was <b>kinescoped,</b> <b>kinescope</b> recording being the method used to record live and as-live television in the days before video-tape. However, it is not known if any <b>kinescope</b> recordings still exist of the series today.|$|R
5000|$|The term <b>kinescope</b> {{originally}} {{referred to}} the cathode ray tube used in television receivers, as named by inventor Vladimir K. Zworykin in 1929. Hence, the recordings were known in full as <b>kinescope</b> films or <b>kinescope</b> recordings. [...] RCA was granted a trademark for the term (for its cathode ray tube) in 1932; it voluntarily released the term to the public domain in 1950.|$|R
50|$|A {{television}} version aired 21 May 1959 on Australian broadcaster ABC. This version aired live in Melbourne, and was <b>kinescoped</b> for interstate broadcasts. It is {{not known}} if the <b>kinescope</b> still exists.|$|R
50|$|Mama {{was filmed}} using <b>kinescopes.</b> Rice kept some <b>kinescopes</b> from the production, {{though most of}} the {{machines}} have been destroyed or thrown away, along with many of the Mama episodes. In 1985, Rice donated her <b>kinescopes</b> to the The Museum of Broadcasting, now called the Paley Center for Media, for exhibition of surviving Mama episodes. She appeared at Mama reunions and fan gatherings throughout her life.|$|R
50|$|Another {{purpose of}} <b>Kinescopes</b> {{involved}} satisfying show sponsors. <b>Kinescopes</b> sometimes {{would be sent}} to the advertising agency for the sponsor of a show so that the ad agency could determine whether or not the sponsor's ads appeared properly. Due to this practice, some <b>kinescopes</b> have actually been discovered in the storage areas of some of these older advertising agencies or in the storage areas of the program sponsors themselves.|$|R
50|$|Daytime programs, however, were {{generally}} not <b>kinescoped</b> for preservation (although many were temporarily <b>kinescoped</b> for later broadcast, episodes recorded {{in this way}} were often junked). Many local station and network newscasts were prone to wiping.|$|R
5000|$|A version {{aired in}} 1958 on Australian television. Originally {{broadcast}} live in Sydney, a <b>kinescope</b> ("telerecording") {{was made of}} the broadcast and later shown in Melbourne. It is not known if the <b>kinescope</b> recording still exists.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} Vampira Show {{has never}} aired outside the Los Angeles area due to it being originally broadcast live {{and not being}} preserved as <b>kinescopes</b> for future airings. No footage {{of the show is}} known to exist, however, in the 1990s a <b>kinescope</b> advertising the station's ability to draw clients to advertisers featuring Nurmi in character was discovered. The clips used in the <b>kinescope</b> were re-shot segments using a previous episode's script.|$|R
50|$|Broadcast live on Sydney station ABN-2 on 19 June 1957, a <b>kinescope</b> {{was made}} of the {{broadcast}} and shown on Melbourne television station ABV-2 on 19 July 1957. It is not known if the <b>kinescope</b> recording still exists.|$|R
50|$|Although DuMont's main {{stations}} very occasionally made <b>kinescopes</b> {{of their}} local programming (there are more surviving WABD local <b>kinescopes</b> from the late-1940s/1950s than there are for many other stations of the period), most of the local programming is lost.|$|R
5000|$|The episode {{broadcast}} on 4 November 1957 still exists as a <b>kinescope</b> recording, {{held by the}} National Archives of Australia. (note: <b>Kinescope</b> recording, also known as telerecording, was an early method of recording live television {{in the days before}} video-tape) ...|$|R
40|$|Subject of investigation: <b>kinescope</b> strip. Purpose of the work: {{development}} and introduction of scientifically grounded conditions of rolling <b>kinescope</b> strips {{to attain the}} required geometrical dimensions and shape. The work studies {{the influence of the}} main technological factors on shrinkage of <b>kinescope</b> strips in rolling with parameters B/n > 3000 and R/n {{less than or equal to}} 150. An analytical problem of determination of the width of thin strips in rolling with parameters B/n > 3000 and R/n less than or equal to 150 was assigned and solved. Mathematical models are developed to determine the influence of rolling parameters on 4 parameters of the <b>kinescope</b> strip flatness. Compression and tension conditions were developed for rolling of <b>kinescope</b> strips on a 20 -roll mill to provide for the required geometrical dimensions and shape of the strips.

25|$|A {{version was}} {{broadcast}} on ABC on Australian television in 1957. It was aired live in Melbourne on 18 December 1957, and was <b>kinescoped</b> {{to be shown}} in Sydney on Christmas Day. It is not known if the <b>kinescope</b> recording still exists.|$|R
50|$|A 1959 {{adaptation}} {{aired on}} ABC television in Australia, using Nigel Kneale's script. Broadcast live in Sydney, a <b>kinescope</b> {{was made of}} the broadcast and shown in Melbourne at a later date. It is not known if the <b>kinescope</b> recording still exists.|$|R
50|$|A version aired 13 December 1948 on NBC's live {{anthology}} series Chevrolet on Broadway. Featuring Edward Everett Horton, Natalie Schafer, and Howard St. John, it aired {{live and}} was probably <b>kinescoped,</b> {{but it is}} not known if the <b>kinescope</b> recording still exists.|$|R

50|$|CBWIT {{first went}} on the air in June, 1962 as CBWBT-1. The station {{broadcast}} <b>kinescope</b> recordings sent to the transmitter from CBWT. On March 1, 1969, the province-wide microwave system replaced the <b>kinescope</b> recordings, and The Pas has enjoyed live television since then.|$|R
50|$|The archival {{status of}} the show (which was {{broadcast}} live) is not clear; Although <b>Kinescope</b> recording existed, many early Australian broadcasts of the period were not recorded. Former Crawfords staffer Ian Crawford {{has said that the}} program was <b>kinescoped,</b> but that no footage survives.|$|R
50|$|<b>Kinescope</b> tubes {{intended}} for photographic use were coated with phosphors rich in blue and ultra-violet radiations. This permitted {{the use of}} positive type emulsions for photographing {{in spite of their}} slow film speeds. The brightness range of <b>kinescope</b> tubes were about 1 to 30.|$|R
50|$|<b>Kinescopes</b> {{were also}} used for some live {{television}} programs, like Captain Kangaroo, when back-to-back episodes were made in a day for different time zones. As performers never went {{three times in a}} day, <b>kinescopes</b> were made for the West Coast at a later date.|$|R
5000|$|The {{play was}} <b>kinescoped</b> for Melbourne {{broadcast}} in February 1958. However, the planned Melbourne broadcast did not happen, as the <b>kinescope</b> recording ("telerecording") {{that was made}} of the broadcast was said to be [...] "poor quality". The play was instead broadcast on Melbourne radio.|$|R
5000|$|... "Official" [...] {{television}} broadcasting {{in the city}} had only begun two months earlier. Cast included British actor Patrick Horgan, Mary Ward and Beverley Dunn. The original TV listing in The Age newspaper described the plot as [...] "a woman's reactions to her husband's suspected affair with another woman". Duration was 30 minutes. Production was by Bill Eldridge. It is not known if a <b>kinescope</b> recording {{was made of the}} broadcast. (note: <b>kinescope</b> recording, also known as telerecording, was an early method of recording live television, used in the days before video-tape became widespread). Some of ABV-2 other dramatic one-offs of 1957 were <b>kinescoped</b> so they could be shown in Sydney, but it is not known if any of these <b>kinescopes</b> still exist.|$|R
50|$|The <b>kinescoped</b> shows ended {{sometime}} in 1953. The 26 filmed episodes were aired from Dec. 18, 1955 through June 10, 1956. There was a 2-year hiatus {{between the end}} of the 51-episode <b>kinescope</b> series and the 26 episodes later recorded on film and distributed by Atlas.|$|R
50|$|In 2007, the <b>kinescope</b> film of Nurmi in {{character}} was restored by Rerunmedia, whose restorations include The Ed Sullivan Show and Dark Shadows. The restoration utilized the groundbreaking LiveFeed Video Imaging process developed {{exclusively for the}} restoration of <b>kinescopes.</b> The restoration was funded by Spectropia Wunderhaus and Coffin Case.|$|R
50|$|Like {{many other}} shows of its day, {{the show was}} {{recorded}} using <b>kinescope.</b> There are even some mentions of this on the show, such as an incident when a contestant challenged a loss on the second Super Bonus Stunt, and the <b>kinescope</b> was used to confirm the result.|$|R
50|$|Only 11 episodes {{are known}} to survivethe pilot and ten <b>kinescope</b> recordings, {{all of which are}} {{archived}} at the Paley Center for Media. Nine of these are black-and-white <b>kinescopes</b> and one is a color episode (from 1969 and on videotape). The pilot has since fallen into the public domain.|$|R
