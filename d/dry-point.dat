60|$|You {{shall have}} no {{description}} of Alice v. d. R. Just call {{up in your}} mind the picture of your own Maggie or Vera or Beatrice, straighten her nose, soften her voice, tone her down and then tone her up, make her beautiful and unattainable--and you have a faint <b>dry-point</b> etching of Alice. The family owned a crumbly brick house and a coachman named Joseph in a coat of many colours, and a horse so old that he claimed {{to belong to the}} order of the Perissodactyla, and had toes instead of hoofs. In the year 1898 the family had to buy a new set of harness for the Perissodactyl. Before using it they made Joseph smear it over with a mixture of ashes and soot. It was the Von der Ruysling family that bought the territory between the Bowery and East River and Rivington Street and the Statue of Liberty, in the year 1649, from an Indian chief for a quart of passementerie and a pair of Turkey-red portières designed for a Harlem flat. I have always admired that Indian's perspicacity and good taste. All this is merely to convince you that the Von der Ruyslings were exactly the kind of poor aristocrats that turn down their noses at people who have money. Oh, well, I don't mean that; I mean people who have just money.|$|E
60|$|My Children's Verses will be {{published}} here in a volume called A CHILD'S GARDEN. The sheets are in hand; I will see if I cannot send you the lot, so {{that you might have}} a bit of a start. In that case I would do nothing to publish in the States, and you might try an illustrated edition there; which, if the book went fairly over here, might, when ready, be imported. But of this more fully ere long. You will see some verses of mine in the last MAGAZINE OF ART, with pictures by a young lady; rather pretty, I think. If we find a market for PHASELLULUS LOQUITUR, we can try another. I hope it isn't necessary to put the verse into that rustic printing. I am Philistine enough to prefer clean printer's type; indeed, I can form no idea of the verses thus transcribed by the incult and tottering hand of the draughtsman, nor gather any impression beyond one of weariness to the eyes. Yet the other day, in the CENTURY, I saw it imputed as a crime to Vedder that he had not thus travestied Omar Khayyam. We live in a rum age of music without airs, stories without incident, pictures without beauty, American wood engravings that should have been etchings, and <b>dry-point</b> etchings that ought to have been mezzo-tints. I think of giving 'em literature without words; and I believe if you were to try invisible illustration, it would enjoy a considerable vogue. So long as an artist is on his head, is painting with a flute, or writes with an etcher's needle, or conducts the orchestra with a meat-axe, all is well; and plaudits shower along with roses. But any plain man who tries to follow the obtrusive canons of his art, is but a commonplace figure. To hell with him is the motto, or at least not that; for he will have his reward, but he will never be thought a person of parts.|$|E

50|$|Furthermore, {{determining}} if {{the same}} hand wrote the text, the gospels and <b>dry-point</b> glosses is highly difficult to discern unless the letters show signs of a later development in style. <b>Dry-point</b> glosses are etched into the vellum rather than a smooth flow of a quill over a writing surface. G. Charles-Edwards and H. McKee believe they have identified such features, elements of the letters in the glosses {{that appear to be}} a late-ninth century invention, in response to Carolingian minuscule. Therefore, it is likely that these glosses were additions after the Gospels had been moved to Lichfield.|$|E

5000|$|An {{elaborate}} Life of Sir David Wilkie, by Allan Cunningham, {{containing the}} painter's journals and his observant and well-considered [...] "Critical Remarks on Works of Art", {{was published in}} 1843. Redgrave's Century of Painters of the English School and John Burnet's Practical Essays on the Fine Arts may also be referred to for a critical estimate of his works. A list of the exceptionally numerous and excellent engravings from his pictures will {{be found in the}} Art Union Journal for January 1840. Apart from his skill as a painter Wilkie was an admirable etcher. The best of his plates, such as the Gentleman at his Desk (Laing, VII), the Pope examining a Censer (Laing, VIII), and the Seat of Hands (Laing, IV), are worthy to rank with the work of the greatest figure-etchers. During his lifetime he issued a portfolio of seven plates, and in 1875 David Laing catalogued and published the complete series of his etchings and <b>dry-points,</b> supplying the place of a few copper-plates that had been lost by reproductions, in his Etchings of David Wilkie and Andrew Geddes.|$|R

5000|$|The new French {{school of}} {{engraving}} had several distinctive characteristics, including {{the substitution of}} exquisite greys for the rich blacks of old and, simplicity of method coupled with extremely high elaboration.

The Belgian school of engraving elaborated an effective [...] "mixed method" [...] of graver-work and <b>dry-point.</b> The Stauffer-Bern method of using many fine lines to create tone had a certain advantage in modeling.|$|E
50|$|His primary medium {{remained}} <b>dry-point</b> etching until a sketching {{trip with}} Stevens. Pierce reminisced in an article: “One Day I {{was looking at}} a scene Stan was doing and wondered why he ad picked out that particular spot. Why paint that I asked. His reply, “Because it has such a beautiful color.” jolted me right out of everything I’d been doing for the past twelve years. I realized that I was no longer seeing a landscape with its colors, {{but in terms of the}} black and white of etchings. I saw that even my etchings were becoming flat no longer suggesting the color of things.” Pierce picked up a brush and watercolors and began capturing his surroundings in layers of color.|$|E
50|$|Thanks to Geoffrey Wedgwood's {{inspirational}} {{teaching at}} Liverpool City School of Art, Adamson developed what became a lifelong fascination with fine printing, especially <b>dry-point,</b> soft-ground etching and aquatint. In {{the early years}} after World War II he undertook several etchings for his own delight while teaching at Exeter School of Art. Between his portrait of his two-year-old son Peter One Morning (completed in 1950) and Killerton from the North (1979), however, there was a gap of many years during which he pursued his career as illustrator and cartoonist. He went back to printmaking with great enthusiasm in the late 1970s, exhibiting his works both new and old at the Royal Society of Painter-Etchers and Engravers. Among his later prints are portraits of John Ogdon (1979) and Patricia Beer (1982).|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe paper {{provides}} a survey {{and discussion of}} the evidence for <b>dry-point</b> glossing in an Irish context. The survey comprises manuscripts produced by Irish scribes containing glosses written by either Irish or continental scribes as well as non-Irish manuscripts which were annotated by an Irishman. The language of the <b>dry-point</b> glosses is predominantly Latin, Old Irish glosses being safely attested merely in the seventh-century 'Codex Usserianus Primus', a manuscript containing a Vetus Latina version of the Gospels...|$|E
40|$|While quill and ink {{were the}} writing {{implements}} {{of choice in}} the Anglo-Saxon scriptorium, other colouring and non-colouring writing implements were in active use, too. The stylus, among them, was used on an everyday basis both for taking notes in wax tablets and for several vital steps {{in the creation of}} manuscripts. Occasionally, the stylus or perhaps even small knives were used for writing short notes that were scratched in the parchment surface without ink. One particular type of such notes encountered in manuscripts are <b>dry-point</b> glosses, i. e. short explanatory remarks that provide a translation or a clue for a lexical or syntactic difficulty of the Latin text. The present study provides a comprehensive overview of the known corpus of <b>dry-point</b> glosses in Old English by cataloguing the 34 manuscripts that are currently known to contain such glosses. A first general descriptive analysis of the corpus of Old English <b>dry-point</b> glosses is provided and their difficult visual appearance is discussed with respect to the theoretical and practical implications for their future study...|$|E
40|$|The {{invention}} of printing announced a real revolution a few centuries ago, but {{today we are}} almost not aware of its true meaning anymore. In opposition to industrial graphics, the artistic graphics is being put forward more increasingly nowadays. Only {{a handful of people}} are engaged in artistic graphics, but a wide range of hand-engraving and matrix imprinting experts are really valuing it. In my thesis I briefly introduce the artistic graphics development turning points and I graphically present the difference between printing methods but throughout the thesis I am mostly focused on a thorough presentation of three graphic techniques – <b>dry-point,</b> etching and reservage. With every each of them firstly I accurately explain the printing procedure and then I consider suitability of the materials for the making of matrix, ink and printing paper. I add an acknowledged author’s work of art and a few of my personal works to each of the graphic techniques. I use these works of art in order to determine each graphic technique’s characteristics. The second part of the thesis involves a pedagogical and research part – according to the educational preparation I executed 6 lessons with ninth-graders, who had to make a graphic journal in the <b>dry-point</b> graphic technique. The works that were made are extremely interesting for further analysis. ...|$|E
40|$|This article reconsiders the origin, both {{geographical}} and cultural, of the Blue Koran {{and suggests}} a {{date and place}} for its production. Through a codicological comparison with a Western manuscript, the Bible of Danila, in which a deep blue parchment and <b>dry-point</b> ruling are employed, it seems possible to establish a link between this Latin precedent and the Blue Koran. A further comparison with a blue manuscript, in Syriac, on paper, provides a parallel {{for the use of}} a dyed/coloured writing material. Such practice, well attested to in Greek and Latin manuscript production, can be found in various cultural spheres. My hypothesis is that the commissioner of the Blue Koran – or the artisans working for him – was aware of the existence of the Bible of Danila, and requested this ‘special’ production for his own sacred text...|$|E
