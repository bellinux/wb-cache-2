[...] Some takes included an acoustic guitar, while the eventual Beatles release features Lennon on piano, with rudimentary double-tracked vocals, and a tambourine. The version released in 1996 most closely reflected the lyrical structure of the early demo takes of the song.|$|R

500|$|Hilson {{explained}} that she is [...] "stripping down and unwinding" [...] with [...] "Make Love", calling <b>it</b> <b>real</b> and natural. She described it as self-explanatory, saying that it speaks of reviving love and [...] "keeping things very interesting". [...] "A woman has {{to know when to}} set the pace, because that's what men need. So that's what the song is about", she said. Musically, [...] "Make Love" [...] is an R ballad, set in a slinky slow jam groove. Patrick Varine of The Observer-Dispatch referred it to as a [...] "hacky mid-'90s R" [...] song, and its slow tempo was compared to ballads by American singer Ciara. According to Mariel Concepcion of Billboard, the song sees Hilson tapping into her vulnerable side.|$|E
500|$|After audiences {{began to}} view Van Winkle as a novelty act and a pop star {{rather than a}} {{legitimate}} rapper, his popularity began to decline. Detroit-based rapper Eminem states that when he first heard [...] "Ice Ice Baby", [...] "I felt like I didn't want to rap anymore. I was so mad, because he was making <b>it</b> <b>real</b> hard for me." [...] Van Winkle lost some credibility among hip hop fans, but later began to regain some success, attracting a new audience outside of the mainstream audience that had formerly accepted him, and then rejected him. [...] "Ice Ice Baby" [...] {{continues to be the}} song that Van Winkle is best known for internationally, although Van Winkle states that his American fans like his newer music better.|$|E
500|$|... "Faith Won't Fail" [...] was {{inspired}} by faith always sufficing in Bible situations and chapters; and Hudson commented on [...] "Search Me": [...] "I was struggling {{with the fact that}} I would have the huge responsibility of how others would be affected through what I was doing or saying on stage. I don't want to put on some kind of front that everything is good when it's not. I wanted to keep <b>it</b> <b>real,</b> but still give people hope." [...] The record closes with [...] "When There's Nothing Left", which {{has been described as a}} [...] "crisp and clean 'love note' to God". The album was described as not being in the vein of the bubble gum pop variety rather evoking comparisons to the Christian pop songstresses Rachel Lampa and Jaci Velasquez.|$|E

500|$|Third scale miniatures several {{meters in}} height {{were created to}} give the film the effect of realism, {{rather than relying on}} {{computer}} generated imagery (CGI). For the whaling station miniatures and life-sized sets, over 700 bags of artificial snow were used (roughly 15–20 tons). A 4.5-meter miniature of an icebreaker with working lights and a mechanical moving radar was created, costing almost $37,000 and taking 10 weeks to create. Visual effects producer Arthur Windus, claimed miniatures were beneficial in the filming process: [...] "With computer graphics, you need {{to spend a lot of}} time making <b>it</b> <b>real.</b> With a miniature, you shoot it and its there." [...] A scale 25-meter miniature of the whaling station was created in several months. It was designed so the model could be collapsed and then reconstructed, which proved beneficial for a six-second shot which required a re-shoot.|$|E
500|$|Keef {{has drawn}} {{comparisons}} to 50 Cent, as The New York Times writes, that like 50 Cent, Keef [...] makes thuggery, [...] "a {{major part of}} his early-career persona." [...] Lupe Fiasco, who {{has been involved with}} a controversy with Keef, has been referred to as an [...] "antagonist" [...] to Keef's more gangsta-rap persona. The New York Times writes, [...] "Lupe Fiasco is a stern and didactic teacher, but it’s arguable that Chief Keef’s music is far better at ringing warning bells." [...] Another rapper, Common, has praised Chief Keef's contributions to rap, stating, [...] "I think Chief Keef brought something that nobody else was doing and he brought it raw. He brought <b>it</b> <b>real.</b> With that, I have to respect that as an artist that he has come and brought that." [...] Other rappers, such as Rhymefest and Lupe Fiasco, however, have been critical of Chief (see controversies section below).|$|E
500|$|Before {{the release}} and {{promotion}} of Celebrity Skin, Love and Fender designed a low-priced Squier brand guitar, called Vista Venus. The instrument featured a shape inspired by Mercury, a little-known independent guitar manufacturer, Stratocaster, and Rickenbacker's solid body guitars and had a single-coil and a humbucker pickup, and was available in 6-string and 12-string versions. In an early 1999 interview, Love said about the Venus: [...] "I wanted a guitar that sounded really warm and pop, but which required just one box to go dirty... And something that could also be your first band guitar. I didn't want it all teched out. I wanted <b>it</b> <b>real</b> simple, with just one pickup switch." [...] In 1999, Love was awarded an Orville H. Gibson award for Best Female Rock Guitarist. During this time, she also starred opposite Jim Carrey as his longtime partner Lynne Margulies in the Andy Kaufman biopic Man on the Moon (1999), which was followed with a role as William S. Burroughs's wife Joan Vollmer in Beat (2000) alongside Kiefer Sutherland.|$|E

500|$|The song's {{production}} is primarily centered around hi-NRG beats, [...] "stuttering synthesizers", and hard snares. Robbie Daw of Idolator {{noted that the}} [...] "opening, pulsating synths are a straight-up throwback to the 'Poker Face' intro— albeit slightly sped up— while the handclap-laden chorus swells and soars with the same pop frenzy that made 'Paparazzi' such a delight." [...] The Guardians Michael Cragg described the song's composition as [...] "brilliantly camp– all squelchy synths and juddering beats" [...] and likened it to a [...] "ridiculous glam-rock song given a techno makeover". The chorus has been noted to contain [...] "a solid mixture of EDM-influenced pop, glitchy k-pop-lite euphoria and just a twinkle of that original joy of The Fame" [...] and features Gaga singing the lines, [...] "Give me the thing that I love (I'll turn the lights on) / Put your hands up make 'em touch (Make <b>it</b> <b>real</b> loud)". Her vocal acrobatics during the song's verses have been compared to those of David Bowie, Annie Lennox, and Grace Jones.|$|E
500|$|During {{the first}} {{third of the}} film, Barton speaks {{constantly}} of his desire to write work which centers on and appeals to [...] "the common man". In one speech he declares: [...] "The hopes and dreams of the common man are as noble as those of any king. It's the stuff of life– [...] why shouldn't it be the stuff of theater? [...] Goddamnit, why should that be a hard pill to swallow? [...] Don't call it new theater, Charlie; call <b>it</b> <b>real</b> theater. Call it our theater." [...] Yet, despite his rhetoric, Barton is totally unable (or unwilling) to appreciate the humanity of the [...] "common man" [...] living next door to him. Later in the film, Charlie explains that he has brought various horrors upon him because [...] "you DON'T LISTEN!" [...] In his first conversation with Charlie, Barton constantly interrupts Charlie just as he is saying [...] "I could tell you some stories-", demonstrating that despite his fine words he really isn't interested in Charlie's experiences; in another scene, Barton symbolically demonstrates his deafness to the world by stuffing his ears with cotton to block {{the sound of his}} ringing telephone.|$|E

500|$|Caribbean Sound Basin housed three {{separate}} studios and several amenities, including a swimming pool, gym, sauna, photographic studio, and bedroom suites. In contrast to most recording studios, its interior was spacious and exposed to natural light. At the studio complex, Raphael, D'wayne, and Riley recorded extensively {{into the night}} {{and went out to}} enjoy the nightlife, before returning to the studio. They often dimmed the lights, burned incense, and drank wine to set the mood when recording, which D'wayne explained in Musician, [...] "We try to make <b>it</b> <b>real</b> calm and mellow. 'Cause {{you want to be able}} to get into what you're singing." [...] They also immersed themselves in the local dancehall scene and attended late-night block parties that lasted until dawn. D'wayne later recalled his nightlife experiences with the group in Maravel: [...] "We'd heard dancehall, but we didn't really know anything about it before going there. We would go to these block parties and you could hear them from almost a mile away. You'd just park on the street and walk to the party along with four or five thousand other people, all partying with these giant speakers all over the place. And this happened just about every weekend." ...|$|E
500|$|Discussing the {{workplace}} flirtation between Will and Emma, Gilsig deemed Terri [...] "a woman of conviction", {{willing to do}} [...] "whatever it takes" [...] to keep Will from leaving her, [...] "even if that means finding this woman and hunting her down". She explained that Will and Terri's communication is weak and that Terri is [...] "missing {{a lot of the}} skills for the marriage", and commented that Terri feels threatened by Will's commitment to the glee club, worried that it will pull him away from her. Gilsig characterized Terri as emotionally still being in high school, and explained: [...] "I think Terri still lives in that world, where I can move the pieces in such a way to create a picture, and that will make <b>it</b> <b>real.</b> I don't think she's learned that you can actually just have open conversations and talk about your fears and ask for your needs to be met in a direct, compassionate way. I think she's still in high school and thinking whatever you do, just don't let anybody know that you don't know what you're doing." [...] Discussing Terri's relationship with her sister Kendra, Gilsig commented: [...] "When Kendra tells Terri to do something, Terri does it. As crazy as Terri might be, she's actually pretty normal in the face of her sister. This [...] is Kendra's brainchild, and she just trusts her implicitly." ...|$|E
500|$|Pete Rock said of {{his studio}} {{experience}} with West, [...] "He's definitely hip-hop, his roots, I was testing him on joints...He takes it to another level which is dope. He had these musicians and this song, they played around my little raggedy beat and made <b>it</b> <b>real.</b> I love the way he works — he goes from one room, writing rhymes then goes to another beat and goes to another room and does something else — I love what he's done". Rapper Pusha T characterized the album as [...] "a collage of sounds" [...] and found West's methods unorthodox when recording, saying that [...] "We could easily be working on one song, thinking we're in a mode, and he'll hear a sound from someone like [...] Jeff Bhasker and immediately turn his whole attention to that sound and go through his mental Rolodex to where that sound belongs on his album, and then it goes straight to that song, immediately". DJ Premier said of the production in comparison to West's previous work, [...] "Well, first of all, {{if you look at}} all of Kanye West's output, he actually did a lot to bring back sampling and make it cool again, even though he's more of a mainstream artist...but his new album is strictly hard beats and rhyme. He's totally done with electro. You're gonna be surprised what you hear".|$|E
