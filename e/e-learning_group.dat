40|$|Background: In many countries, {{gastric cancer}} is not {{diagnosed}} until an advanced stage. An Internet-based e-learning system {{to improve the}} ability of endoscopists to diagnose gastric cancer {{at an early stage}} was developed and was evaluated for its effectiveness. Methods: The study was designed as a randomized controlled trial. After receiving a pre-test, participants were randomly allocated to either an e-learning or non-e-learning group. Only those in the <b>e-learning</b> <b>group</b> gained access to the e-learning system. Two months after the pre-test, both groups received a post-test. The primary endpoint was {{the difference between the two}} groups regarding the rate of improvement of their test results. Findings: 515 endoscopists from 35 countries were assessed for eligibility, and 332 were enrolled in the study, with 166 allocated to each group. Of these, 151 participants in the <b>e-learning</b> <b>group</b> and 144 in the non-e-learning group were included in the analysis. The mean improvement rate (standard deviation) in the e-learning and non-e-learning groups was 1 · 24 (0 · 26) and 1 · 00 (0 · 16), respectively (P <  0 · 001).

40|$|Background: Gastric {{cancer is}} the second highest cause of cancer deaths worldwide. Apart from Japan and Korea where {{screening}} programs are implemented, most gastric cancer patients worldwide are diagnosed at an advanced stage because of limited knowledge and experience of endoscopists. An internet-based e-learning system to teach detection of early gastric cancer using standard endoscopy has been developed and this study evaluated its effectiveness. Methods: The study {{was designed as a}} randomized controlled trial. Participants worldwide signed a consent form before first undertaking a pre-test via the internet, after which they were randomly allocated to the e-learning and non-e-learning groups. Pre-adjustment strata were the pre-test score, experience of endoscopy, being a nurse endoscopist or a medical practitioner, and medical institution and country. Only the participants in the <b>e-learning</b> <b>group</b> were allowed to access the e-learning system, which consisted of video lectures on basic knowledge and self-exercise tests to accumulate experience. A post-test in both groups was conducted 2 months after the pre-test. The pre-determined primary endpoint was the difference in the rate of improvement of the test result (post-test score/pre-test score) between groups. After completion of the post-test, the e-learning system was opened for all participants. Results: Among the 515 endoscopists from 35 countries assessed for eligibility, 322 participants who met the study’s inclusion criteria completed the pre-test and were enrolled: 166 were allocated to the <b>e-learning</b> <b>group</b> and 166 to the non-e-learning. Of these, 151 participants in the <b>e-learning</b> <b>group</b> and 144 in the non-e-learning group completed the post-test, and were included in the analysis. The mean rate of improvement (standard deviation) of the test result in the e-learning and non-elearning groups was 1. 24 (0. 26) and. 1. 00 (0. 16), respectively (P! 0. 001, Student’s ttest). Conclusion: This global study clearly demonstrated the efficacy of an e-learning system to improve knowledge and experience on endoscopic detection of early gastric cancer. Its effectiveness will be further evaluated in a study of improvements in the rate of early gastric cancer detection by all participants in actual clinical practice (UMIN: R 000012039).

We might not {{think of it as}} e-learning, but today many new e-books are in fact very complex electronic teaching platforms. It is generally accepted that e-learning is as effective as classroom teaching methods, but little is known about its value in relaying contents of different levels of complexity to students. We set out to investigate e-learning effects on simple recall and complex problem-solving compared to classroom teaching. Methods: 63 nurses specializing in anesthesiology were evenly randomized into three groups. They were given internet-based knowledge tests before and after attending a teaching module about respiratory physiology and pulmonology. The three groups was either an <b>e-learning</b> <b>group</b> with eBook teaching material, an <b>e-learning</b> <b>group</b> with case-based teaching or a group with face-to-face case-based classroom teaching. After the module the students were required to answer a post-test. Time spent and the number of logged into the system was also measured. Results: For simple recall, all methods were equally effective. For problem-solving, the eCase group achieved a comparable knowledge level to classroom teaching, while textbook learning was inferior to both (p, 0. 01). The textbook group also spent the least amount of time on acquiring knowledge (33 minutes, p, 0. 001), while the eCase group spent significantly more time on the subject (53 minutes, p, 0. 001) and logged into the system significantly more (2. 8 vs 1. 6, p, 0. 001) ...|$|E

40|$|There is {{a vicious}} circle of {{resistance}} to developing research capacity in social work. Practitioners receive minimal research methods teaching on qualifying programmes which contributes to a low value being placed upon research skills within social work agencies. There are few opportunities to acquire these skills on post-qualifying social work programmes which means that practitioners who go on to become educators possess limited research expertise, thus perpetuating the problem. Increasing the research competence of practitioners may be one way to transform this circle into a virtuous one.

40|$|Abstract- Currently, in an {{e-learning}} environment, {{the activity}} of following-up (tracking) of the learning process is confronting several problems. The tutor must do a multitude of tasks with insufficiency of tools allowing him to improve the performance of these tasks. Also, this insufficiency of the follow-up systems develops, for the learner, an isolation feeling and thus involves his defecting. Our research interest is to design and implement an effective system {{in order to support}} the tutor to be efficient in his double task: individual and group follow-up. Our contribution consists of determining the problems involved in the remote follow-up, defining information necessary to the tutor to carry out his tasks, identifying the indicators witch will be edited under a dashboard to appreciate not only quantitatively but also qualitatively the work of learning without exploring the detailed trace of training. These data allows us to define an architectural design for our proposed system. So, this system will be useful for the tutor, as source of information to follow each learner. In addition, the learner will constantly have access to history of its actions, the remarks of the tutor, and also to compare himself with {{the other members of the}} group.

This material was e-mailed one week before the presential class. The students were submitted to a multiple-choice test (with three options each) with seven questions immediately before the presential class, immediately after the class, and one-month later. The three tests had the same questions; however, the answers options were distributed in different sequences. The primary outcome was immediate pretest score.

Since 2001, an interdisciplinary project on multimedia education in medicine has been sponsored by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research at the Charité. One {{part of the project}} is on dentistry, called dentocase. This prospective study aimed to compare e. learning self study with traditional lectures objectively and subjectively [...] A module about instrumental occlusal analysis was offered by oral lecture and by a unit in the virtual library of the e-learning tool. 85 pre-clinical dental students were randomly divided into two groups: the <b>e-learning</b> <b>group</b> (n = 48) and the lecture group (n = 37). A pre-test was made to assess the students' basic knowledge. The first post-test and the scoring of the teaching methods were performed immediately after the lecture or the self studying by the online tool and a second post-test six weeks later. All these have influenced on the appearing of a supposition that the learning effect of the both learning activities {{turns out to be the}} same, and, objectively, gives the same results. A possible connection between good and bad test results in relation with the time which requires e-learning programme should have been also established Further on, there appeared a question, whether the use of electronic study means had had the positive influence on the results in the first post-test among the <b>e-learning</b> <b>group.</b> The information about acceptance of the two study methods in question and the satisfaction with the results received are given by the subjective questionnaires. A supposition about the equivalence of the both activities (the learning results are being under special attention) was not proved by the given studies, while the oral lecture group showed much better results in the first post-test. After the second post-test the learning results of the both groups have become even, so that the groups in equal time (6 weeks) demonstrated the resembling progress. It also turned out that the same students, who were involved in working with the programme more intensively, showed the better (though, not significantly better) test results. The same can be said about the use of the electronic means. The students who dealt with the electronic means (e. g. CD-ROM, Internet, Medline) demonstrated higher learning results, which also indicates a significant difference. The results of the subjective questionnaires displayed a marked tendency. The students would like to have a more use of e-learning means in the study process, so the general acceptance of this learning form is clearly observed. But at the same time, the students would not prefer to exclude the usual oral lectures when studying. Generally speaking, the use of frontal teaching (classical oral lectures) cannot be resumed of showing less efficient results. Also the fact that the oral lectures should not be considered “old-fashioned” ought to be kept in mind when the modern reforms of the higher education are put into practice. Summing up, it can be concluded that though the use of e-learning means nowadays proves to be vitally important, they should not replace the traditional forms of teaching (oral lectures) ...|$|E
40|$|Even though {{e-learning}} endeavors {{have significantly}} proliferated in recent years, current e-learning technologies provide poor support for group-oriented learning. The now popular virtual world 2 ̆ 7 s technologies offer a possible solution. Virtual worlds provide the users with a 3 D - computer generated shared {{space in which}} they can meet and interact through their virtual representations. Virtual worlds are very successful in developing high levels of engagement, presence and group presence in the users. These elements are also desired in educational settings since they are expected to enhance performance. ^ The goal of this research is to test the hypothesis that a virtual world learning environment provides better support for group-oriented collaborative e-learning than other learning environments, because it facilitates the emergence of group presence. To achieve this, a quasi-experimental study was conducted and data was gathered through the use of various survey instruments and a set of collaborative tasks assigned to the participants. Data was gathered on the dependent variables: Engagement, Group Presence, Individual Presence, Perceived Individual Presence, Perceived Group Presence and Performance. The data was analyzed using the statistical procedures of Factor Analysis, Path Analysis, Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA). ^ The study provides support for the hypothesis. The results also show that virtual world learning environments are better than other learning environments in supporting the development of all the dependent variables. It also shows that while only Individual Presence has a significant direct effect on Performance; it is highly correlated with both Engagement and Group Presence. This suggests that these are also important in regards to performance.

Such multiple media are also expensive in management, since human resources are {{needed to keep the}} material repositories in order. One solution of the problem lies in centralized active digital repositories. Such repositories aim to simplify the learner’s work and boost learning efficiency. With introduction of interactivity and live communication tools such repositories become learning platforms exceeding the functionality of “passive” digital libraries. Such learning platforms could be easily used both for on-campus and distance education. This dissertation presents an evaluation of a digital repository of interactive multimedia content in the field of Heat and Power Technology: Computerized Educational Platform (CompEdu HPT). The platform evaluation consisted of integration of the tool into the university curriculum and then collection of feedback from students and teachers. The evaluation concerned usefulness of the platform for learning, aspects of instruction improvement, collecting observations about how the platform is used by students, as well as their opinions about the IT application direction chosen. The methods included: online feedback forms, questionnaires, interviews, discussions and observations. The evaluation demonstrated that the main strength of the platform is the integration of learning materials in one portable package. The students appreciated structured and logically arranged information that was available for easy access. Coverage of a broad area of knowledge related to heat and power technology was also pointed out as an advantage with reflection on the very low price of acquisition of the materials. The most popular elements of the content in use included: simulations, lecture notes, the print function, the glossary, and calculation exercises. A major part of the students declared the high value of CompEdu in facilitating home study. Nevertheless, not all the students had a positive impression: around one-fifth of them did not find the platform useful and expressed preference for more traditional learning media. The majority of the negative opinions concerned content quality, which directly related to weaknesses of the content production and review process. The evaluation emphasized the importance of material quality and amount as the key issue for a good learning platform with relatively smaller importance of presentation forms. The evaluation also considered aspects of functionality from the user point of view. Differentiation between popularity of simulations showed that simulations used by teachers during lectures have higher educational value than those for individual use only. The popularity of the printing option indicated a need for adaptation of digital materials for paper publishing. The general conclusion for practical use of multimedia tools in education was that high usability and simplicity of information access should be the focus point of any chosen approach in the direction. The CompEdu evaluation suggested that after thorough content review and addition of an efficient search mechanism the platform can successfully deliver rich learning content. The platform gave an extensive real-case illustration of how multimedia can be used in educational practice. Due to the evaluation, the CompEdu <b>e-learning</b> <b>group</b> has collected rich experience and know-how in the field of active knowledge repositories. The experience will be used for development of a more sophisticated learning platform working in the global Internet environment with major focus on information accessibility by easy search.

Designing {{tools that}} support group {{formation}} is a challenging goal {{for both the}} areas of adaptive and collaborative <b>e-learning</b> environments. <b>Group</b> formation {{may be used for}} a variety of purposes such as for grouping students that could potentially benefit from cooperation based on their individual characteristics or needs, for mediating peer help by matching peer learners, for facilitating instructors proposing an initial grouping approach. In this paper, we discuss several factors that need to be considered when assigning learners to groups. We also investigate the use of the c-means family clustering algorithms and uniform distribution, for group formation. The fuzzy c-means is compared to (a) the k-means algorithm for homogenously grouping students, and (b) a random selection algorithm (based on the uniform distribution) for formulating heterogeneous groups. Preliminary results from grouping 36 students based on 2 and 3 criteria, indicate the potential of the fuzzy c-means algorithm for homogenously grouping students, and the random selection algorithm as a low complexity approach for achieving a significant level of heterogeneity. ...|$|R

The quality of our knowledge and skills base will determine New Zealand’s future success {{in the global economy}} and as a cohesive society. The providers of tertiary education face a number of complex challenges. The development of an increasingly global economy, demographic changes, and rapid technological change are all significant challenges. Accompanying the rapid technological changes are world-wide developments in e-learning capability. Many governments have recognised the importance of their citizens developing the knowledge, skills and understanding needed for a high technology world, and are investing in the development of e-learning capability. This is also occurring in New Zealand, however, scope exists to better co-ordinate and integrate current developments. As a first step towards co-ordination and integration, an <b>E-learning</b> Advisory <b>Group</b> is to be established by the Ministry of Education. The Advisory Group is expected to provide advice on ways in which the New Zealand Government can facilitate the development of e-learning capability in our tertiary education sector...|$|R

We assume that blended care with total integration of eHealth and usual care will provide better quality of care in the long term. Professional training of healthcare professionals on the care program including self-management supported by eHealth and personal assistance for the patients to guide them through the platform are essential elements to stimulate the use of eHealth. With appropriate training through <b>e-learning</b> or <b>group</b> training, self-management seems safe and reliable for a selected proportion of motivated patients. Even though eHealth-supported self-management was not superior to usual care regarding health status, the studies produced no negative effects, suggesting that eHealth is a safe option for delivery of self-management support and high-quality disease management. The usage of eHealth platforms is better under conditions of perfect integration into usual care and with personal assistance and the coaching of patients. The usage is highest for patients with platforms that add high practical value in daily life...|$|R

The current NLP technologies, however, are not matured enough to perform full-automatic semantic or discourse analysis. Thus, we take a different approach; an instructor corrects the contents and its correction is embedded into the contents in an XML format called KeML. The key/mouse operations of the user are also embedded as annotations. Thus, the contents can be incomplete at the initial stage and become solid gradually as being utilized. We have implemented an <b>e-learning</b> system of <b>group</b> discussion for a foreign language class, which is demonstrated at the workshop. ...|$|R
