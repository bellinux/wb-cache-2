40|$|The {{introductory}} papers clearly {{showed a}} {{growing interest in}} Partitioning and Transmutation (P&T) from the international community. The OECD-NEA announced {{the continuation of the}} P&T assessment study which will be focused on Accelerator Driven Transmutation Systems (ADS). The EURATOM programme managed by the European Commission and the five successive OECD-NEA information exchange meetings have greatly contributed to international collaboration. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has conducted a more basic programme aimed at the coverage of P&T activities from non OECD-NEA member countries and focused on safety, environmental and non-proliferation aspects of P&T. The Japanese OMEGA and <b>French</b> <b>SPIN</b> programmes are the engines of the world-wide current R&D activities. The OMEGA programme produced a broad spectrum of basic and applied research and pioneered the concept of the double strata fuel cycle and Fast Burner Reactors. The programme has been reviewed and will be revised in 1999. The new major direction of activity is oriented towards ADS and its associated fuel cycle. A powerful ADS machine is under construction in Japan. The <b>French</b> <b>SPIN</b> programme achieved breakthroughs in the new partitioning methods and in th...|$|R

5000|$|In later European folklore, weaving {{retained}} its connection with magic. Mother Goose, traditional teller of fairy tales, is {{often associated with}} spinning. She was known as [...] "Goose-Footed Bertha" [...] or Reine Pédauque ("Goose-footed Queen") in <b>French</b> legends as <b>spinning</b> incredible tales that enraptured children.|$|R
50|$|First Island {{began his}} 1997 {{season in the}} Sandown Mile in April. On this {{occasion}} he was made the 5/6 favourite and finished second, beaten a head by Wixim, a four-year-old to whom he was conceding six pounds. Three weeks later at Newbury, First Island started second favourite behind the <b>French</b> challenger <b>Spinning</b> World in the Group One Lockinge Stakes. He took the lead approaching the final furlong and won by {{one and a half}} lengths from the subsequent Sussex Stakes winner Ali-Royal, with Spinning World a further five lengths back in fourth.|$|R
5000|$|According to the <b>French,</b> the Vietnamese <b>spun</b> out the {{negotiations}} to win time {{to assemble a}} fleet, and then treacherously attacked the two French warships without warning. Colonel Alfred Thomazi, the historian of the French conquest of Indochina, also claimed that the Vietnamese first attempted to lure the French officers to their deaths: ...|$|R
2500|$|In [...] "The Real Personages of Mother Goose" [...] (1930), Katherine Elwes-Thomas submits {{that the}} image and name [...] "Mother Goose" [...] or [...] "Mère l'Oye" [...] may be based upon ancient legends of the wife of King Robert II of France, known as [...] "Berthe la fileuse" [...] ("Bertha the Spinner") or Berthe pied d'oie ("Goose-Foot Bertha" [...] ), who, {{according}} to Elwes-Thomas, is often described in <b>French</b> legends as <b>spinning</b> incredible tales that enraptured children.|$|R
60|$|The Delavie {{family was}} {{cultivated}} for the time. French {{had been brought}} home as a familiar tongue, though Telemaque, Racine, and Le Grand Cyrus were the whole library in that language; {{and there was not}} another within thirty miles. On two days in the week the sisters became Mesdemoiselles Elisabeth, Henriette, and Aurelie, and conversed in <b>French</b> over their <b>spinning,</b> seams, lace, or embroidery; nor was Aurelia yet emancipated from reciting Racine on alternate days with Milton and Shakespeare.|$|R

50|$|At the {{following}} race in Mexico City, de Cesaris again finished fourth, having qualified in 11th place. Gachot started from 20th {{on the grid}} but had {{worked his way up}} to fifth place when he spun off the circuit. He also retired from the next race, the <b>French</b> Grand Prix, <b>spinning</b> out on the first lap having qualified 19th. De Cesaris, from 13th on the grid, went on to finish sixth in the race, adding another point to Jordan's total.|$|R
25|$|In {{the early}} 20th-century, there were mills {{spinning}} thread. As of 1920, {{there were two}} factories in Smyrna dyeing yarn, which were owned by British companies. These companies employed over 60,000 people. During this time, {{there was also a}} <b>French</b> owned cotton <b>spinning</b> mill. The city also produced soap made of refuse olive oil. An ironworks, also owned by the British, produced tools and equipment. Those tools were used to extract tannin from valonia oak. As of 1920, the ironwork was exporting 5,000 tons of product a year. The city also produced wooden boxes, which were used for fig and raisin storage. The wood for the boxes was imported from Austria and Romania.|$|R
50|$|F1 {{arrived at}} the beach-side Zandvoort circuit near Amsterdam, and the fast Zandvoort circuit had been {{modified}} with an awkward chicane placed between both {{of the most dangerous}} parts of the track, the very fast Hondenvlak and Tunnel Oost corners. The chicane didn't slow down the cars much and the new corner proved {{to be more of a}} nuisance than a reduction in danger. Rene Arnoux in the ever-improving Renault took pole, with next to him Alan Jones in the Williams. The start proved to be rather shambolic: Arnoux and third starter Clay Regazzoni tangled and were eliminated at the start; Jones took the lead, with Villeneuve taking up the challenge by charging towards Jones. Jones and Villeneuve battled, and then the <b>French</b> Canadian <b>spun</b> at the new chicane after going wide. His Ferrari's rear suspension was damaged; and then Villeneuve then went off at Tarzan, and decided to drive around the circuit with shattered rear suspension and a punctured right front tire. He drove rather fast, showing outstanding car control, and was able to make it back with a very broken car. Jones ended up winning the race from Jody Scheckter and Jacques Laffite.|$|R
2500|$|Other reviews were mixed. Publishers Weekly wrote, [...] "If {{the books}} of Jacqueline Susann and Harold Robbins seem formulaic, this debut novel of sin and success in Las Vegas outdoes them all. And that, in a way, is the point.... All novelty rests in the conceit of {{computer}} authorship, not in the story itself." [...] Library Journal stated [...] "French invested eight years and $50,000 in a scheme to use artificial intelligence to fulfill his authentic, if dubious, desire to generate a trashy novel a la Jacqueline Susann. Shallow, beautiful-people characters are flatly conceived and randomly accessed in a formulaic plot ... a sexy, boring morality tale. Of possible interest to computer buffs for its use of Expert Systems and the virtual promise of more worthy possibilities; others should read Susann." [...] Kirkus Reviews wrote: [...] "The deal here is that author French is not the author, he's just the midwife, having allegedly programmed his computer to write about our times just the way Susann would... almost perfectly capturing glamorous Jackie's turgid but E-Z reading prose style and ultrareliable mix of sex, glitz, dope 'n' despair.... One wonders, though, if <b>French's</b> tale <b>spinning</b> PC will do as well on the talkshows as Jackie did. The computer weenies {{have been trying to}} tell us for years, garbage in-garbage out." ...|$|R
50|$|In 1985 the Mitsubishi Ralliart Team {{invited him}} to race in the two major Australian {{endurance}} races, the 1985 Castrol 500 at Sandown, and the 1985 James Hardie 1000 in a factory Group A Mitsubishi Starion. Jones' first start in the Bathurst 1000 lasted only just past the first turn on the first lap. A mid-field mishap saw Jones' Starion and the Holden VK Commodore of 1981 race winner John <b>French</b> collide and <b>spin</b> off into the tyre barrier with both cars too damaged to continue. This relationship with the Ralliart team lasted on and off {{until the end of}} 1988, with Jones racing extensively in Japan and often being overlooked for Australian races. During this time he qualified the Starion in the top 10 at Bathurst for the 1986 James Hardie 1000, and finish 10th outright in 1988.|$|R
