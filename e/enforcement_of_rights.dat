40|$|The {{judicial}} <b>enforcement</b> <b>of</b> socio-economic <b>rights</b> {{remains a}} challenge in many countries. This is generally attributable to the inadequacy of a particular country’s legal framework, in particular its constitutional framework. Given the importance of judicial remedies in litigation, in particular public interest litigation, this article considers possibilities for the judicial <b>enforcement</b> <b>of</b> socio-economic <b>rights</b> in Botswana. It discusses the institutional, legal and constitutional framework for the promotion, protection and fulfilment <b>of</b> socio-economic <b>rights</b> in the country. It also tackles the issue ofwhether the judicial <b>enforcement</b> <b>of</b> socio-economic <b>rights</b> is easily achievable when those rights are not constitutionally entrenched. The article also considers whether the absence of directive principles of state policy within Botswana’s Constitution is a hindrance to the judicial <b>enforcement</b> <b>of</b> socio-economic <b>rights</b> in Botswana. Within that context, it highlights the possible means <b>of</b> judicial <b>enforcement</b> <b>of</b> socio-economic <b>rights</b> in Botswana.

50|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{comparatively}} dense chapter is to deduce what Nozick calls the Compensation Principle. That idea {{is going to be}} key for the next chapter, where he shows how (without any violation of rights) an ultraminimal state (one that has a monopoly of <b>enforcement</b> <b>of</b> <b>rights)</b> can become a minimal state (which also provides protection to all individuals). Since this would involve some people paying for the protection of others, or some people being forced to pay for protection, the main element of the discussion is whether these kinds of actions can be justified from a natural rights perspective. Hence the development of a theory of compensation in this chapter.|$|E

50|$|Public {{interest}} law (公益法, pronounced Gong Yi Fa) is {{an accepted}} term in China, where the basic institutions supporting {{the rule of}} law are still extremely nascent. China does not have a common-law system in which lawyers are expected to {{play a key role in}} “making law.” Nevertheless, a small but effective community of lawyers has gained acceptance of public interest litigation as a legitimate means of resolving social issues and contributing to a harmonious society, and non-governmental actors have significantly improved the <b>enforcement</b> <b>of</b> <b>rights</b> for migrant workers, women, children and those suffering from environmental degradation, among others. For example, public interest lawyers in China have filed lawsuits in court successfully challenging workplace sexual harassment and the involuntary confinement of healthy people to mental hospitals.|$|E

50|$|In 2005, {{local police}} raided Victor's home without {{a search warrant}} and confiscated LGBT related documents.

Victor unexpectedly filed an 'Application for <b>enforcement</b> <b>of</b> <b>rights</b> guaranteed in the Bill of Rights' challenging his and Yvonne's detention and police abuse.

50|$|The {{seeds of}} PIL were planted in Pakistan {{in the mid}} to late-1980s by such {{luminaries}} of the legal fraternity as, inter alia, Chief Justices Muhammad Haleem and Nasim Hasan Shah and former Attorney General Ali Ahmad Fazeel. In the wake of a newly reintroduced Constitution, elements within judicial circles began to debate the question of how the fundamental rights enshrined therein could be effectively enforced by a population which was (and is) largely ignorant or unaware of their rights. Part of {{the answer to this question}} was identified by Chief Justice Muhammad Haleem as a “massification” of society; where citizens were “increasingly drawn together” on the basis of rights and interests. Former Attorney General Ali Ahmad Fazeel and Former Chief Justice of Pakistan Nasim Hasan Shah also recognised the phenomenon of “massification” and, carrying the principle to its logical conclusion, were able to formulate more concrete answers to the question: That the enforcement of the rights of groups of people could be achieved if the law recognised the <b>enforcement</b> <b>of</b> <b>rights</b> beyond the concept of the aggrieved person; that justice for all could be served if the rights of groups of people could be enforced.|$|E
