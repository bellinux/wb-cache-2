It was not until 1816 that Georges Cuvier created the genus Hemiramphus; from then on, all three were classified as Hemiramphus. In 1859, Gill erected Hemiramphidae, deriving its name from Hemiramphus, the family's type genus. The name comes from the Greek hemi, meaning half, and rhamphos, meaning beak or bill.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: The {{evaluation}} and measurement of human body dimensions are achieved by physical anthropometry. Cephalometery is {{a branch of}} anthropometry science in which the head and face anatomical dimensions are measured. This research was conducted {{in view of the}} importance of anthropometric indices of the face in forensic medicine, surgery, paediatrics and medical imaging. Methods: This descriptive and cross-sectional study was set up to determine and compare the face shapes in <b>Fars</b> <b>and</b> Turkman ethnic groups of 808 normal 17 - to 20 -year-old males and females in Gorgon, North Iran (Fars group 407, male 200 and female 207; Turkman group 401, male 198 and female 203). The length and width of faces were determined by using classic cephalometery technique with Martin spreading callipers, and the shape of faces in the ethnic group of <b>Fars</b> <b>and</b> Turkman in both sexes was compared. Results: The dominant type of face shape in both the native <b>Fars</b> <b>and</b> Turkman females was euryprosopic (37. 7 and 51. 7 percent, respectively). The dominant type of face shape in the native <b>Fars</b> <b>and</b> Turkman males was mesoprosopic (44 and 38. 4 percent, respectively). Conclusion: This study determined the possible effect of ethnicity on the diversity of face shapes in young males and females in this region...|$|R

5|$|Baltimore was <b>far</b> <b>and</b> {{away the}} most {{successful}} of any American CFL team {{on the field and}} off, averaging crowds of over 37,000 their first year. Knowing that Canadian football was considerably different from the American game, Speros stocked the Stallions mostly with CFL veterans. As coach, he brought in Don Matthews, who had already played in two Grey Cups and won one. The result was a team that eventually finished second in the East with a 12–6 record and became the first American team to qualify for the playoffs. They advanced {{all the way to the}} Grey Cup. In a thrilling match played in BC Place, the BC Lions defeated the Stallions on a last second field goal. Perhaps most remarkably, they were reported to have turned a profit in their first year after an initial US$7 million investment by Speros.|$|E

Indigenous leaders travelled from <b>far</b> <b>and</b> wide to pledge allegiance to Cortés, whom they considered to be more fair in his dealings than other Spanish captains. With the application of diplomacy, moderate treatment of the natives, and the judicious application of force, Cortés tightened the Spanish grip over Honduras.|$|E
