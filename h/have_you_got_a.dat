5|$|The {{success of}} Moo, You Bloody Choir saw Richards {{expected}} by record label Sony BMG {{to produce a}} quality follow-up. He denied being under significant pressure, though {{the persistence of the}} label—"Richo, <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> single? Do you have singles? Please, do you have singles?"—was noted. Much of the writing for Augie March's fourth album took place while touring the United States, which Richards argued minimised the band's opportunities to be creative. In 2008, Augie March began recording Watch Me Disappear at Neil Finn's Auckland studios; they also recorded in Melbourne, Sydney, and Los Angeles. The band worked primarily in New Zealand {{to get away from the}} distraction of Melbourne, their hometown, thus allowing them to focus solely on recording.|$|E
2500|$|The closing track, {{the longest}} {{composition}} ever released by Dylan, the 16-minute [...] "Highlands", most probably took its central motif ("My heart's in the highlands") from {{a poem by}} Robert Burns called [...] "My heart's in the highlands" [...] (published in 1790). In Jim Dickinson's account, [...] "I remember, when we finished 'Highlands'—there are two other versions of that, the one that made the record is the rundown, literally, {{you can hear the}} beat turn over, which I think Dylan liked. But, anyway, after we finished it, one of the managers came out, and he said, [...] "Well, Bob, <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> short version of that song?" [...] And Dylan looked at him and said: 'That was the short version.'" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Aw, he's better," [...] vouchsafed {{the other}} rider. [...] "Nagger needed {{to lose some}} weight. Lin, <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>an</b> extra set of shoes for him?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do tell me, quick; <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>an</b> order?" [...] asked Merry, full of {{interest}} at once, for artistic vicissitudes were very romantic, {{and she liked}} to hear about them.|$|R
6000|$|... "It isn't that," [...] he answers, {{interrupting}} me; [...] "but I don't {{want you}} to laugh at me. I thought {{if you were a}} married man you would be able to understand the thing better. <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>an</b> intelligent woman in the house?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You don't {{see that}} husband here!" [...] echoed the bewildered Kells. He stared with open mouth. [...] "Say, <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> screw loose?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, anyway, it's a {{perfectly}} elegant story, Anne, {{and will make}} you famous, of that I'm sure. <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> title for it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What's loose?" [...] asked Songbird, {{coming up}} at that moment, {{followed}} by some others. [...] "Tom, <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> pain in your inwards?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Only village. Very keen, but {{no great}} shakes. By the way, {{how are you}} off for cricket now? <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> ever <b>got</b> <b>a</b> spare afternoon?" ...|$|R
5000|$|... "What chance <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>got</b> against <b>a</b> tie and a crest?" [...] is a {{reference}} to school uniform and badges, particularly {{the influence of the}} [...] "old school tie".|$|R

6000|$|... 'The Captain {{has been}} making inquiries,--no doubt {{with the idea that}} he may at last be driven to harsh measures. <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> sister?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{should like}} to have done him justice before," [...] said Soames; [...] "but I never had the chance. <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> 'Baronetage' here?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Nurse! You're ever so old. What <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> nurse for?' Una {{finished}} milking, {{and turned}} round on her stool as Kitty Shorthorn grazed off.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I don't {{believe in}} nothing. Here,' sitting {{down on the}} stairs, with an arm round her, 'tell me all about it, Dolly, we are old chums, <b>you</b> know. <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> <b>got</b> into <b>a</b> row?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Are you, indeed?" [...] {{the young}} lady said, in surprise. [...] "Yes, and now that I look close at you, I {{recognize}} your face. Poor boy, how <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>got</b> into <b>a</b> strait like this?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Well," [...] he said, [...] "you have pluck, and if you're obstinate, pluck {{takes you}} far. <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> promise {{from any of}} our {{shipping}} offices?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh I {{dare say}} she's all right," [...] Brookenham {{returned}} {{as if his}} interest in the case <b>had</b> dropped. <b>You</b> might <b>have</b> felt <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> little nearer to him on guessing that in so peopled a circle satiety was never far from him.|$|R
60|$|MISS BEECH. [Sidling to him.] You're a good young man, and <b>you</b> <b>'ve</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> good heart.|$|R

6000|$|... "All right, Joseph," [...] said Mr. Vickers, {{secretly}} incensed at this unforeseen {{display of}} caution on Mr. Tasker’s part. [...] "I s’pose the fairies come and put’em on while they was asleep.

6000|$|... "I suppose, miss," [...] he said, after pausing {{for some}} moments, [...] "that {{the meaning of}} this is that <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> young lover?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes. You {{looked as}} if you were walking in your sleep," [...] she said. [...] "Are you {{arranging}} some terrible love affair? <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> <b>got</b> to reconcile <b>a</b> desperate couple?" ...|$|R
