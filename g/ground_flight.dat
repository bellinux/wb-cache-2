The elevons served in tailless type aircraft both as elevators and ailerons, while split flaps on the downward angled wingtips took the place of a conventional rudder; they were later straightened after that angle proved unnecessary during flight testing.|$|E

50|$|An {{air force}} <b>ground</b> <b>flight</b> is roughly {{equivalent}} to an army platoon and may be commanded by a flight lieutenant, flying officer, pilot officer, or warrant officer. A flight is also a basic unit of guided missiles, such as surface-to-air missiles. These ground flights may carry out operational roles (such as air traffic control, airfield defence or firefighting), engineering roles (such as aircraft or ground systems maintenance), medical, dental, and legal units, or purely administrative roles, such as finance, infrastructure or human resource management.|$|E
5000|$|A {{flight is}} a {{military}} unit in an air force, naval air service, or army air corps.

In most usages, multiple flights make up a squadron. The [...] "flight" [...] is also a basic unit for intercontinental ballistic missiles.

50|$|Akaflieg Stuttgart {{wanted to}} build a glider with {{reasonable}} performance that was safe and simple to fly, the result was the FS-16. The design employed a cantilever wing attached {{to the top of the}} fuselage; the rear portion of the fuselage was raised, similar to the Akaflieg Stuttgart F.1. The FS-16 as constructed had no vertical tail, but used pivoting panels on the wingtips for roll and yaw control. It had no tail-skid, using a single large skid under the front fuselage with a spur extending rearwards for support and stability on the <b>ground.</b> <b>Flight</b> characteristics with the rotating wing-tip panels were not as expected so a conventional vertical fin on an extended rear fuselage, and ailerons constructed from fabric-covered Duralumin on the outer wing traling edges, were added after initial flights.|$|E

He explains how before the aircraft took off Franklin had dropped her bag, which had no money inside. Therefore, the money was put in the bag by the real guilty smuggler, Karen White. Larkin, in an ironic statement, tells White that in fact this will definitely be her last flight but not because of her originally expected honorable resignation implying {{she will have to}} soon face the authorities in London to face responsility for her actions that lead to the death of the innocent flight attendant Vera Franklin.|$|E
5000|$|The K-7 first flew on 11 August 1933. The {{very brief}} first flight showed {{instability}} and serious vibration {{caused by the}} airframe resonating with the engine frequency. The solution to this {{was thought to be}} to shorten and strengthen the tail booms, little being known then about the natural frequencies of structures and their response to vibration. The aircraft completed seven test flights before a crash due to structural failure of one of the tail booms on 21 November 1933. The existence of the aircraft had only recently been announced—by Pravda, which declared it was [...] "victory of the utmost political importance," [...] since it had been built with USSR steel rather than imported steel.The accident killed 14 people aboard and one on the <b>ground.</b> <b>Flight</b> speculated that sabotage was suspected as the investigating committee had representation by the state security organization, the Joint State Political Directorate (OGPU).|$|E

This exceeded the descent rate of 600 - 700 ft per minute required by the precision approach path to runway 31L, and United Airlines' recommended descent rate for the Boeing 737 of 1000 ft per minute. At 14:27, the first officer called out [...] "thousand feet" [...] in reference to the plane's altitude reaching 1000 ft MSL, a height of only 380 ft above the ground. The captain leveled the plane off and increased engine power. The throttles were not advanced fully and, with the spoilers still extended, did not provide enough thrust to climb or even to maintain level flight without losing speed. The stick shaker, a stall warning device attached to the pilots' control yoke, activated 6-7 seconds after the aircraft leveled off and continued to sound as the aircraft entered an aerodynamic stall.|$|E
