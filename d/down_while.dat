An oil collection system was put in place, and full flow resumed until the pipeline was again shut <b>down</b> <b>while</b> a bypass was installed to avoid the leaking section.|$|E
5|$|To {{keep costs}} <b>down</b> <b>while</b> {{ensuring}} sufficient longevity, Sega opted {{to create the}} platform from popular off-the-shelf components. The first model to be developed was actually the SC-3000, a computer version with a built-in keyboard, but when Sega learned of Nintendo's plans to release a games-only console, they began developing the SG-1000 alongside the SC-3000.|$|E
5|$|Following the women's suggestion, Emma {{searches}} for and finds Walt's journal containing {{all of his}} pumpkin growing secrets. She discovers that Walt documented all of his strategies in code. After Seth helps to translate {{a portion of the}} journal, he tries to partner with her, but she refuses believing she must grow the pumpkins by herself. Emma is unable to spread manure as she falls <b>down</b> <b>while</b> attempting to use the tiller. During a poker game Seth wins a bet which forces Emma to collaborate with him for the contest. While they work together, Seth participates in Emma's radio program. Bobby informs Seth about her reasons for joining the contest.|$|E

5|$|On 7 October 2011, Miliband reshuffled his Shadow Cabinet. John Denham, John Healey and Shaun Woodward {{announced}} that they were stepping <b>down,</b> <b>while</b> Meg Hillier, Ann McKechin and Baroness Scotland also left the Shadow Cabinet. Veteran MPs Tom Watson, Jon Trickett, Stephen Twigg and Vernon Coaker were promoted to the Shadow Cabinet, as were several of the 2010 intake, including Chuka Umunna, Margaret Curran and Rachel Reeves, with Liz Kendall and Michael Dugher given the right to attend Shadow Cabinet. Lord Wood and Emily Thornberry were also made Shadow Cabinet attendees.|$|E
5|$|The Allied {{warships}} {{reached the}} flying-off position for Implacables air group at 5:30 am on 14 June. Ten minutes later, twelve Seafires and two Fireflies were launched. The Seafires strafed a radar station and an airfield on Moen island, and the Fireflies reconnoitred the atoll. A Seafire {{equipped with a}} reconnaissance camera also photographed Japanese installations; these photos were used to plan further air attacks and bombardments. One of the Seafires was shot <b>down</b> <b>while</b> attacking the airfield, resulting {{in the death of}} its pilot. This was the only British aircraft to be lost in combat during Operation Inmate.|$|E

5|$|The North Korean pilot {{subsequently}} {{bailed out}} of the aircraft, though the navigator remained in it and was killed when the aircraft crashed. Moran, in the meantime, had stalled while attempting to avoid the second North Korean plane, and when his aircraft recovered {{he was able to}} quickly shoot down the second North Korean aircraft which had accelerated in front of his. Little's aircraft then dived to engage the three remaining North Korean aircraft, quickly shooting one <b>down</b> <b>while</b> attempting to assist Moran.|$|E
5|$|The {{character}} that the player controlled would change as they progressed through the game. The creators sought {{to have the}} player control Spock {{during one of the}} Vulcan's mind melds. The ending of the game would have seen the player control Kirk, Spock and Chekov in an attempt to stop the titular superweapon. The interface for the game revolved around a menu which appears after the mouse button is held <b>down</b> <b>while</b> the cursor is hovering over an object. This was to prevent the need for controls to be shown on screen at all times, {{in a manner similar to}} LucasArts games of that period.|$|E
5|$|Three first-half {{possessions}} deep in Detroit Lions territory led to zero Buccaneer points {{en route}} to another blowout loss. Lions receiver Jeff Chadwick took a 73-yard reception to the Buccaneers' 1-yard line when Rod Jones fell <b>down</b> <b>while</b> covering him. Jones also got beaten by Leonard Thompson on a jump ball in the end zone. Vito McKeever was outrun by Chadwick on the Lions' third score. James Wilder had 130 yards rushing and 71 yards receiving for the Buccaneers.|$|E
25|$|The Redskins {{converted}} two turnovers {{into two}} touchdowns {{in the second half}} to overcome the defending champion Bears' 13â€“7 halftime lead. Chicago finished the game with just 220 yards and 14 first <b>downs,</b> <b>while</b> losing four turnovers.|$|R

5|$|West Gates engines {{were shut}} <b>down</b> <b>while</b> American {{backed out of}} the tangle. West Gate quickly began to settle and the order to abandon ship was issued. The chief {{engineer}} and his assistant, Spencer and Hillery, remained belowdecks long enough to extinguish the boilers and open safety valves to prevent the explosion of the boilers. They finished the task just before the aft bulkhead gave way to the inrushing seawater. Both arrived on deck in time to board lifeboat number 2, which had been held as long as possible for men in the after part of the ship.|$|E
5|$|Arriving at {{the ruins}} of Los Angeles, Marcus {{encounters}} Kyle and a mute child named Star (Berry) during a violent skirmish with Skynet's machines. Kyle and Star are subsequently abducted and taken prisoner by Skynet. Later, two Resistance A-10 airplanes are shot <b>down</b> <b>while</b> trying to intercept a machine transport. Wright locates downed pilot Blair Williams (Bloodgood). They then {{make their way to}} John's base, where thereafter, Marcus is wounded by a magnetic land mine. Attempting to save his life, the Resistance fighters discover that Marcus is indeed a cyborg, with a mechanical endoskeleton and a partially artificial cerebral cortex. Although Marcus believes himself to be human, John and his wife Kate think that Marcus has been sent to execute him and orders him to be killed. Blair helps Marcus escape. During the pursuit, Marcus saves John's life from Skynet's hydrobots and the two make a bargain; Marcus will enter Skynet's headquarters in San Francisco, to help John rescue Kyle and the other prisoners, if he lets him live.|$|E
5|$|At , Hughes faced future UFC Lightweight Champion Sean Sherk, winning via {{unanimous}} decision. Hughes {{started the}} action by taking Sherk down immediately, passing to half guard. Sherk {{was able to}} stand {{for a few seconds}} before Hughes took him down again. In round two, they started to trade punches, but eventually Hughes took Sherk down. Like the first round, they stood up for a moment. At the beginning of the third round, Sherk took Hughes <b>down,</b> <b>while</b> Hughes attempted a kimura from the bottom. A late stand up led to a second takedown by Sherk. Round 4 saw Hughes using his strength to control the challenger on the ground. Sherk took Hughes down again in the fifth round, but the champion controlled {{the rest of the time}} sprawl-and-brawling as he finished on top. With the victory, he became the first man to ever defeat Sherk.|$|E

50|$|Quarterback Jake Christensen {{was sacked}} twice, and the Hawkeyes were held {{scoreless}} until an interception near the Penn State end zone set up Trey Stross' 4th-quarter touchdown reception in a 27-7 blowout loss {{on the road}} at Penn State. Iowa was held to eight first <b>downs</b> <b>while</b> Penn State had 26.|$|R
50|$|Today, the Goring Gap constricts the River Thames, {{narrowing}} the otherwise broad river valley. Steep hills rise southwards to Lardon Chase, the nearest {{section of the}} Berkshire <b>Downs</b> <b>while</b> the Chiltern Hills rise to the north. The twin villages of Goring and Streatley straddle the River Thames at the Goring Gap.|$|R
5|$|Believing {{their first}} {{attempts}} {{to be too}} derivative, the developers held brain storming sessions. During a session, they agreed that one of Asteroidss favorable elements was its wrapping effect. They felt a game that allowed the player to fly off the screen would be exciting, and decided to create a game world larger than the screen displayed. The game's environment was made longer than the screen, with the visible area scrolling horizontally. Expanding on the idea, they envisioned a version of Space Invaders rotated 90degrees. By changing the orientation of Space Invaders design, the ship moved up and <b>down</b> <b>while</b> flying horizontally. Large asteroids, an element from Asteroids, were then added to the game world, but were later removed because the staff felt it lacked enjoyment. Jarvis intended the screen to scroll only from left to right; fellow Williams employee Steve Ritchie, however, convinced him the game {{should be able to}} scroll in either direction.|$|E
5|$|Charles's {{cautious}} {{failure to}} directly assault the town, putting {{a higher priority}} on minimising losses than on victory, had cost the Royalists dearly; while claims for their number of dead and wounded men ranged from 1,000 to 1,500, only around 50 people inside the city were killed. Essex's force, on the other hand, was in relatively good shape; its one issue {{was the lack of}} supplies. If he stayed in the Severn Valley, Essex would be unable to get reinforcements or outside aid, the London elements of the army would demand to go home, and the one remaining significant Parliamentarian force would find itself pinned <b>down,</b> <b>while</b> Charles, with secure bases at Oxford and Bristol, would be able to starve them into surrender while other Royalist armies ran rampant through Britain. Because of this, Essex {{had no choice but to}} try to return to London. Travelling back across the Cotswolds, as he had done to reach Gloucester initially, would expose the Parliamentarians to Charles's cavalry on open ground.|$|E
5|$|Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships, 1906â€“1921 {{reports that}} the Italian steamer , one of the convoyed ships, rammed and damaged U-16, causing U-16s crew to scuttle their ship due to the {{severity}} of the damage. Uboat.net's U-Boat War in World War I reports that Nembo herself rammed U-16 before going <b>down,</b> <b>while</b> Robert Grant and Gordon Smith give another possible fate for U-16: that Nembos depth charges detonated and sank the submarine while Nembo was sinking. Smith reports that 11 men aboard U-16, including her commanding officer von Zopa, lost their lives in the sinking, and that two survivors were picked up. U-16 was the only boat of her class to be sunk during the war.|$|E
50|$|The family business, Quilty and sons, {{acquired}} {{the property in}} 1917 from Messrs. Mather, Ross, Manning and Ralston for Â£34,000.

5|$|Haakon also {{attempted}} to strengthen his {{ties with the}} papacy by issuing a vow of crusade. In 1241 he however converted this into a vow of engaging in warfare against pagan peoples in the north {{in light of the}} Mongol invasion of Europe. When a group of Karelians ("Bjarmians") had been forced westwards by the Mongols, Haakon allowed them to stay in Malangen and had them Christianizedâ€”something that would please the papacy. Later, in 1248, Louis IX of France proposed (by Matthew Paris as messenger) to Haakon to join him for a crusade, with Haakon as commander of the fleet, but Haakon turned the offer <b>down.</b> <b>While</b> Haakon had been unsuccessful in gaining the recognition of Pope Gregory IX, he quickly gained the support from Pope Innocent IV who sought alliances in his struggle with Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II. Haakon finally achieved royal recognition by Pope Innocent in 1246, and Cardinal William of Sabina was sent to Bergen and crowned Haakon in 1247.|$|E
5|$|In {{completing}} missions, {{the player}} can have Talion engage in melee, ranged combat, and stealth approaches, with some missions rewarding the player more for completing the mission {{in a specific}} manner. Talion's ranger abilities are enhanced through Celebrimbor, allowing the player to mix combat with special focus-based attacks; these latter attacks {{can be used to}} slow time <b>down</b> <b>while</b> aiming with the bow, drain focus out of an enemy foe, or, later in the game, brand the foe to become an ally of Talion. The combat system uses an attack-chain system that enables the player to perform special moves after building the chain to a large enough value, such as instantly draining a foe of focus or performing an area focus attack. With the combat system, they can also counter and dodge attacks. Stealth is a critical element in some missions; several areas are considered Strongholds and should Talion's presence be discovered, an alarm will sound and more Uruks will arrive to try to kill him.|$|E
5|$|In {{the next}} match, {{the team of}} the Steiner Brothers (Rick and Scott Steiner) and The Smoking Gunns (Billy and Bart Gunn) faced the team of Money Inc. (Ted DiBiase and Irwin R. Schyster) and The Headshrinkers (Samu and Fatu). The match began with the Steiners in control as they took turns attacking DiBiase. Fatu and Bart Gunn entered the match, and Fatu and his {{teammates}} wore Bart <b>down</b> <b>while</b> preventing him from tagging in a partner. Billy Gunn fought DiBiase and controlled the match until DiBiase performed the Million Dollar Dream on Billy. DiBiase released the hold and gloated about his performance. This enabled Billy Gunn to surprise DiBiase with a small package pinfall to win the match. After the match, the teams continued to fight until the Steiners and Gunns cleared their opponents from the ring.|$|E
