40|$|The {{relations}} between genetic change in domestic livestock and infectious disease (including both its epidemiology and the animal's reaction to it) are examined. The overall picture is confusing {{because there are}} different, and seemingly unrelated, ways of considering the issue. An attempt is made to put these together into a more general framework. Four processes of particular interest are distinguished and discussed in more detail: (i) the way a population's genetic potential for immunocompetence can be changed by breeding, (ii) the way an animal's immunocompetence is influenced by that animal's production potential, {{in combination with the}} environmental resources that are available to it at a given time, (iii) the way the disease status of an animal (and a population of animals) is influenced by its immunocompetence, and (iv) the way the production level of an animal is influenced by activation of its immune system. Ultimately, all four processes influence the realised level of production. This comes down to four questions that need to be addressed: (i) can we use genetic variation in immunocompetence in animal breeding? (ii) does a higher production potential (today's <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>breeding)</b> {{have a negative impact on}} immunocompetence? (iii) does improved immunocompetence result in improved health? and (iv) how large is the negative impact of disease on production...|$|E

Virtual plant modeling is an interdisciplinary area combining mathematical formalisms, biological knowledge, and computer graphics techniques. An important modeling method {{is based on the}} theory of Lindenmayer systems (L−systems). At present, L−system models make it possible to: (a) accurately reproduce the structure and development of plants; (b) show how architectural parameters (e. g., branching angles, elongation rates, vigor of branches) affect the appearance of plants; (c) simulate plant physiology and investigate the effects of manipulations (e. g., pruning, bonsai techniques) or different external conditions (e. g., local light microclimate, water availability, crowding) on plant development; and (d) simulate plants not only in isolation, but also in their ecological contexts. Currently constructed research models also address the genetic basis of plant form. In horticulture, the models are potentially useful as an exploration tool, indicating desirable <b>directions</b> <b>of</b> <b>breeding</b> and manipulating ornamental plants for maximum visual impact, and fruit plants for maximum yield.

The Balkan population offers a unique chance to test the effect <b>of</b> <b>breeding</b> range expansion on the genetically programmed migratory direction. We studied 21 paddyfield warblers at Durankulak Lake, NE Bulgaria, by recording their autumn migratory orientation in circular orientation cages. Our data show that the preferred migratory orientation is directed along a NE-SW axis. Paddyfield warblers seem to avoid direct crossing of the Black Sea by following the western coast. The mean bearing was parallel to the nearest coastline and corresponds to the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> the historical <b>breeding</b> range expansion <b>of</b> the species. In our experiment many individuals showed south-western orientation in autumn, a course which would potentially lead the birds to exploratory movements outside the current breeding range. An axial orientation response has been often shown in circular cage tests, and can be due to factors such as coastal orientation or reverse orientation triggered by the physiological condition of some individuals. However, {{it might also be}} one of the driving mechanisms for range expansion. Hence, we can expect the future expansion of Balkan paddyfield warblers to continue towards south-west.

To characterize the typology of conventional sheep farms a study of the production system was conducted in 2014 in 10 sheep farms, located in the counties Cluj, Caras-Severin, Covasna, Buzau, Prahova and Teleorman. Evaluation of the production system from each farm was based on the completion of a specific questionnaire to this type of evaluation. The results showed that conventional sheep farms taken in study are diverse in terms of number of animals held and land used, the average size of sheep farm being by 313. 6 heads (with limits between 105 and 720 heads), and the average area of land used per farm is 90. 02 ha (with limits between 4. 32 and 201. 5 ha).

The <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> sheep <b>breeding</b> in these farms is mixed, respectively for milk and meat.

500|$|The breed as it {{is known}} today was officially {{established}} in the village of Hafling in the Etschlander Mountains, then located in Austria-Hungary. The Arabian influence was strongly reinforced in the modern Haflinger by the introduction of the stallion El Bedavi, imported to Austria in the 19th century. [...] El-Bedavi's half-Arabian great-grandson, El-Bedavi XXII, was bred at the Austro-Hungarian stud at Radautz and was sire of the breed's foundation stallion, 249 Folie, born in 1874 in the Vinschgau. Folie's dam was a native Tyrolean mare of refined type. [...] All Haflingers today must trace their ancestry to Folie through one of seven stallion lines (A, B, M, N, S, ST, and W) to be considered purebred. The small original gene pool, and the mountain environment in which most original members of the breed were raised, has resulted in a very fixed physical type and appearance. In {{the early years of the}} breed's development Oriental stallions such as Dahoman, Tajar and Gidran were also used as studs, but foals of these stallions lacked many key Haflinger traits and breeding to these sires was discontinued. After the birth of Folie in 1874, several Austrian noblemen became interested in the breed and petitioned the government for support and <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> organized <b>breeding</b> procedures. It was 1899 before the Austrian government responded, deciding to support breeding programs through establishment of subsidies; high-quality Haflinger fillies were among those chosen for the government-subsidized breeding program. Since then the best Haflinger fillies and colts have been chosen and selectively bred to maintain the breed's quality. Horses not considered to meet quality standards were used by the army as pack animals. By the end of the 19th century Haflingers were common in both South and North Tyrol, and stud farms had been established in Styria, Salzburg and Lower Austria. In 1904, the Haflinger Breeders' Cooperative was founded in Mölten, in South Tyrol, with the aim <b>of</b> improving <b>breeding</b> procedures, encouraging pure-breeding and establishing a studbook and stallion registry.|$|R

These bloodsucking midges are involved in the transmission to animals of various parasites (protozoa and filarial worms) and viruses.

Each species, however, has its own ecological requirements and therefore has its own specific microhabitat.

The larval habitats of many species of the genus Culicoides, however, remain undiscovered. Knowledge <b>of</b> <b>breeding</b> sites and their characterization are essential in order to allow the development of effective control strategies against these vector insects, thus allowing the strengthening of livestock vaccination programs and other control methods.
