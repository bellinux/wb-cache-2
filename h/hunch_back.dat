60|$|O thou beloved {{member of}} the brute creation! Songs have been written in praise of thee; statues would ere now have been erected to thee, had that <b>hunch</b> <b>back</b> and those flabby wings of thine been 'susceptible of artistic treatment.' But ugly thou art {{in the eyes of}} the uninitiated vulgar; a little stumpy old maid toddling about the world in a black bonnet and a brown cloak, laughed at by naughty boys, but doing good {{wherever}} thou comest, and leaving sweet memories behind thee; so sweet that the trout will rise at the ghost or sham of thee, for pure love of thy past kindnesses to them, months after thou hast departed from this sublunary sphere. What hours of bliss do I not owe to thee! How have I seen, in the rich meads of Wey, after picking out wretched quarter-pounders all the morning on March-brown and red-hackle, the great trout rush from every hover to welcome thy first appearance among the sedges and buttercups! How often, late in August, on Thames, on Test, on Loddon heads, have I seen the three and four pound fish prefer thy dead image to any live reality. Have I not seen poor old Si. Wilder, king of Thames fishermen (now gone home to his rest), shaking his huge sides with delight over thy mighty deeds, as his fourteen-inch whiskers fluttered in the breeze like the horsetail standard of some great Bashaw, while crystal Thames murmured over the white flints on Monkey Island shallow, and the soft breeze sighed in the colossal poplar spires, and the great trout rose and rose, and would not cease, at thee, my alder-fly? Have I not seen, after a day in which the earth below was iron, and the heavens above as brass, as the three-pounders would have thee, and thee alone, in the purple August dusk, old Moody's red face grow redder with excitement, half proud at having advised me to 'put on' thee, half fearful lest we should catch all my lady's pet trout in one evening? Beloved alder-fly! would that I could give thee a soul (if indeed thou hast not one already, thou, and all things which live), and make thee happy in all aeons to come! But as it is, such immortality as I can I bestow on thee here, in small return for all the pleasant days thou hast bestowed on me.|$|E

The same year Tracy featured as lead singer on trumpeter Freddie Hubbard's album Splash. In 1984, she performed on the hit Television Show Star Search where she was a semi-finalist in the Female Vocalist category.She was then summed by San Francisco-based Producer Narada Michael Walden to provide vocals on some of the World's top recording artist in the industry such as Aretha Franklin, Whitney Houston, Mariah Carey, Tevin Campbell, Shanice Wilson, and many others. She also worked with Narada's Protege Walter Affanasieff, on some of the top Movie soundtracks such as <b>Hunch</b> <b>Back</b> of Notre dame, Snow Dogs, Michael Bolton, Grover Washington, Peobo Bryson, Celine Dion and many others.

60|$|But {{there was}} no time for shuddering, for now the savage went about {{something}} that completely fascinated my attention, and convinced me that he must indeed be a heathen. Going to his heavy grego, or wrapall, or dreadnaught, which he had previously hung on a chair, he fumbled in the pockets, and produced at length a curious little deformed image with a <b>hunch</b> on its <b>back,</b> and exactly the color of a three days' old Congo baby. Remembering the embalmed head, at first I almost thought that this black manikin was a real baby preserved in some similar manner. But seeing that it was not at all limber, and that it glistened a good deal like polished ebony, I concluded that it must be nothing but a wooden idol, which indeed it proved to be. For now the savage goes up to the empty fire-place, and removing the papered fire-board, sets up this little hunch-backed image, like a tenpin, between the andirons. The chimney jambs and all the bricks inside were very sooty, so that I thought this fire-place made a very appropriate little shrine or chapel for his Congo idol.|$|R
5000|$|The {{person is}} usually placed {{on their side}} (left more {{commonly}} than right). The patient bends the neck so the chin {{is close to the}} chest, <b>hunches</b> the <b>back,</b> and brings knees toward the chest. This approximates a fetal position as much as possible. Patients may also sit on a stool and bend their head and shoulders forward. The area around the lower back is prepared using aseptic technique. Once the appropriate location is palpated, local anaesthetic is infiltrated under the skin and then injected along the intended path of the spinal needle. A spinal needle is inserted between the lumbar vertebrae L3/L4, L4/L5 or L5/S1 and pushed in until there is a [...] "give" [...] as it enters the lumbar cistern wherein the ligamentum flavum is housed. The needle is again pushed until there is a second 'give' that indicates the needle is now past the dura mater. The arachnoid membrane and the dura mater exist in flush contact with one another in the living person's spine due to fluid pressure from CSF in the subarachnoid space pushing the arachnoid membrane out towards the dura. Therefore, once the needle has pierced the dura mater it has also traversed the thinner arachnoid membrane. The needle is then in the subarachnoid space. The stylet from the spinal needle is then withdrawn and drops of cerebrospinal fluid are collected. The opening pressure of the cerebrospinal fluid may be taken during this collection by using a simple column manometer. The procedure is ended by withdrawing the needle while placing pressure on the puncture site. The spinal level is so selected to avoid spinal injuries. In the past, the patient would lie on their back for at least six hours and be monitored for signs of neurological problems. There is no scientific evidence that this provides any benefit. The technique described is almost identical to that used in spinal anesthesia, except that spinal anesthesia is more often done with the patient in a seated position.|$|R

40|$|Lymphomas are {{malignant}} neoplasms of the lymphoid lineage. They are broadly classified as either Hodgkin disease or as non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). Burkitt's lymphoma, {{a variety of}} NHL, is significantly most common in sub-Saharan Africa, where it accounts for approximately one half of childhood cancers. Lymphoblastic lymphoma is less common.

The child had no BCG immunization. The essential findings on examination were in keeping with lower motor neurons (LMN) paralysis of the lower limbs. The upper limbs appeared normal. There was loss of cutaneous sensation from the umbilicus (T 10) downward. There was a firm, (rather tense), non-tender non-pulsatile, smooth swelling over the mid-third of the back (T 6 -L 1) the mass had no differential warmth. It measures about 20 Ã 12 cm.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the combined effects of once-daily milking and feeding level (ad libitum or adjusted) on goat welfare and milk emission characteristics in late lactation. Forty dairy goats housed in individual pens were managed under twice-daily milking and fed ad libitum during a pre-experimental period (2 weeks). The experimentwasthen divided into two successive periods: a 1 -week period of milking frequency reduction and a 3 -week period of feed adjustment. During the first period, half the goats were managed under oncedaily milking. During the second period, half the goats of each type of milking treatment was fed ad libitum, whereas the other half received a quantity of feed adjusted weekly to milk production. The following measurements were taken for all goats: milk yield, dry matter intake (DMI), somatic cell count (SCC), plasma cortisol concentrations before morning milking, milk flow parameters [latency (i. e., the time from teat cup attachment to first measurement of the milk with a jar), the maximum milk flow rate (MAXFR) and the time taken to reach this maximum (TMAX) ] and goat behaviour at morning milking (number of goats ruminating, <b>back</b> <b>hunching,</b> foot moving or kicking at milking). In addition, the timeâbudget (time spent drinking, eating, standing, lying or climbing) of 16 goats was measured by video recording. Milk yield was reduced by once-daily milking (18 and 21 % {{in the first and}} the second period, respectively) but not by feed adjustment. DMI was reduced by once-daily milking (12 %) only during the second period or by feed adjustment (28 %) during the same period. Both SCC and latency were not modified by once-daily milking nor feed adjustment. MAXFR was increased by once-daily milking but not modified by feed adjustment. TMAX was increased by once-daily milking only during the first period and reduced by feed adjustment during the second one. The time spent eating was reduced by once-daily milking or feed adjustment during the second period, in agreement with the reduction in DMI in this period. There were no effects of milking frequency or feeding level on plasma cortisol concentrations, the behaviour at morning milking or the time spent drinking, standing, lying or climbing. No welfare impairment was demonstrated under our experimental conditions in late lactation dairy goats under a once-daily milking management strategy whatever the feeding level...|$|R
5000|$|....., chapbook {{writer and}} bellman, was born, it is believed, at Raploch, near Stirling, in 1724. He was much deformed, {{and found the}} {{wandering}} life of a chapman (or pedlar) more to his taste than any settled trade; but when the highland army of Prince Charles Edward {{was on its way}} south in September 1745, he gave up such occupation as he had, and followed the prince. It is probable he was merely a camp-follower, as he can scarcely have been a soldier, but he accompunied the forces to Derby, and back to Scotland, and was present at Culloden (16 April 1746). Five months later he published A full, particular, and true Account of the Rebellion in the year 1745-6.:Composed by the Poet, D. Graham,:In Stirlingshire he lives at hame.To the tune of [...] "The Gallant Grahams," [...] etc. This work is written throughout in a rough doggerel, but is historically useful as the undoubted testimony of an eye-witness. Its popularity was very great. No copies of the first or second (1752) editions are known to exist. Graham settled in Glasgow, and is said to have become a printer, but this is doubtful; at all events he became skellat, bellman or town-crier, of Glasgow about 1770. He is described as [...] "a bit wee gash bodie under five feet," [...] as being lame in one leg, [...] "with a large <b>hunch</b> on his <b>back,</b> and another protuberance on his breast." [...] He died on 20 July 1779. Graham wrote, under assumed names, a large number of chapbooks, such as Jockey and Maggys Courtship, The History of Buckhaven, Comical Transactions of Lothian Tom, History of John Cheap, the Chapman, Leper the Taylor, The History of Haverel Wives, Simple John and his Twelve Misfortunes, etc. All his works were exceedingly popular,and early editions have become very rare. Although coarse, they are not wanting in humour, and they are valuable to the student of folklore as containing very numerous references to current superstitions. Sir Walter Scott warmly appreciated Grahams talent, and so late as 1830 entertained the idea of printing a correct copy of the original edition of the rhyming history of the rebellion as his contribution to the Maitland Club publications. The idea was not carried out. Grahams collected writings were edited with notes, together with a biographical and bibliographical introduction, and a sketch of the chap literature of Scotland, by George MacGregor, 2 vols. 1883 (250 copies only).|$|R
6000|$|She {{had been}} {{perfectly}} {{prepared to be}} surprised at Ricks, for Mrs. Gereth was a wonder-working wizard, with a command, when all was said, of good material; but the impression in wait for her on the threshold made her catch her breath and falter. Dusk had fallen when she arrived, and in the plain square hall, {{one of the few}} good features, the glow of a Venetian lamp just showed, on either wall, the richness of an admirable tapestry. This instant perception that the place had been dressed at the expense of Poynton was a shock: {{it was as if she}} had abruptly seen herself in the light of an accomplice. The next moment, folded in Mrs. Gereth's arms, her eyes were diverted; but she had already had, in a flash, the vision of the great gaps in the other house. The two tapestries, not the largest, but those most splendidly toned by time, had been on the whole its most uplifted pride. When she could really see again she was on a sofa in the drawing-room, staring with intensity at an object soon distinct as the great Italian cabinet that, at Poynton, had been in the red saloon. Without looking, she was sure the room was occupied with other objects like it, stuffed with as many as it could hold of the trophies of her friend's struggle. By this time the very fingers of her glove, resting on the seat of the sofa, had thrilled at the touch of an old velvet brocade, a wondrous texture that she could recognize, would have recognized among a thousand, without dropping her eyes on it. They stuck to the cabinet with a kind of dissimulated dread, while she painfully asked herself whether she should notice it, notice everything, or just pretend not to be affected. How could she pretend not to be affected, with the very pendants of the lustres tinkling at her and with Mrs. Gereth, beside her and staring at her even as she herself stared at the cabinet, <b>hunching</b> up a <b>back</b> like Atlas under his globe? She was appalled at this image of what Mrs. Gereth had on her shoulders. That lady was waiting and watching her, bracing herself, and preparing the same face of confession and defiance she had shown the day, at Poynton, she had been surprised in the corridor. It was farcical not to speak; and yet to exclaim, to participate, would give one a bad sense of being mixed up with a theft. This ugly word sounded, for herself, in Fleda's silence, and the very violence of it jarred her into a scared glance, as of a creature detected, to right and left. But what again the full picture most showed her was the far-away empty sockets, a scandal of nakedness in high, bare walls. She at last uttered something formal and incoherent--she didn't know what: it had no relation to either house. Then she felt Mrs. Gereth's hand once more on her arm. [...] "I've arranged a charming room for you--it's really lovely. You'll be very happy there." [...] This was spoken with extraordinary sweetness and with a smile that meant, [...] "Oh, I know what you're thinking; but what does it matter when you're so loyally on my side?" [...] It had come indeed to a question of [...] "sides," [...] Fleda thought, for the whole place was in battle array. In the soft lamplight, with one fine feature after another looming up into sombre richness, it defied her not to pronounce it a triumph of taste. Her passion for beauty leaped back into life; and was not what now most appealed to it a certain gorgeous audacity? Mrs. Gereth's high hand was, as mere great effect, the climax of the impression.|$|R

These changes can be measured to indicate how much stress the animal is suffering. Physiological stress indicators often measured in animal transport research include changes in heart rate, live-weight, cortisol levels, and blood composition including electrolytes, metabolites and enzymes (Broom and Johnson, 1993). Animal behavioural stress indicators include struggling, vocalisation, kicking or biting, <b>hunching</b> of the <b>back,</b> urination, defecation and recumbence (Broom et al. 1996; Gregory, 1998). Meat quality parameters post mortem can also help to indicate stress levels in animals (Grandin, 1990; Gregory, 1998). These include incidence of bruising and DFD in all farm animal species and PSE in pigs. Mortality is also an obvious indicator of poor welfare. Combined aspects of transport that contribute to causing stress in livestock include loading and unloading procedures, close proximity to stock handlers, water/feed deprivation, noise, riding in a truck, mixing with other animals and being forced into unfamiliar environments. The responses of stock to these conditions will depend on the animal's genetically controlled adaptability, physical condition and its previous handling experiences (Gross and Siegel, 1993). Factors such as the adequate preparation of animals for transport, controlled prior access to feed and water, minimal disruption to social groups, considerate animal handling skills, adequate handling and transport facilities including good ventilation in trucks, and careful driving technique are major areas that dictate the standard of animal transport. For example, considerations for pigs should include a pre-transport fasting period which balances the requirement to avoid hunger, travel sickness and deaths. Breeding and selecting for more stress-resistant genotypes of pigs can improve the welfare by reducing mortality and the metabolic consequences of transport stress. Other factors influencing animal transport include farm size and country size. For example, livestock transport in Scandinavia involves transport vehicles travelling to more than one farm in order to fill a vehicle. In Australia often one farm pick up can fill a truck, and although the distances may be much longer to the abattoir, it will be more direct. The market demand dictates the type of animals transported. For example the veal trade in Europe demands young live calves to be transported over long distances from northern countries which supply it to the southern countries which demand it. This trade exists in live animals rather than meat because the demanding countries further fatten and slaughter these animals specific to their needs. The industry set up influences the standard of animal transport in different countries. For example in countries where industries are vertically integrated consisting of producer-owned slaughter plant co-operatives (Sweden and Denmark), producers are paid according to slaughter weight and lean meat percentage, therefore there is more consistent quality control measures in place. In Australia the marketing system is such that it provides no economic incentive to reduce losses. Greater public awareness of animal welfare seems to be increasing in western countries, and as a result there is more pressure on the livestock industry to adopt better standards for the farming, handling, transport and slaughter of animals. The transport of livestock in Australia continues to be under increased scrutiny from overseas markets and animal welfare groups. In the European Union (EU), public pressure has been a successful instigator to the drafting and continued improvement of comprehensive legislation for animal transport. EU animal transport laws cover aspects such as minimum design standards for livestock vehicles (including ventilation controls), maximum journey lengths before resting intervals, stocking rates, what animals are considered as fit to travel, and general handling and care requirements of animals in transport. These laws are causing debate between northern and southern countries in areas such as maximum journey lengths and vehicle design standards. Some countries such as the UK have also gone to a great effort to adjust national laws in order to incorporate EU transport laws, but countries such as Spain and Italy have not. Typically it is these countries that more often have poor standards of animal welfare, and the welfare of farmed animals has historically been of low priority (Schmidt, 1995). When and how these countries will adopt the comprehensive EU animal transport regulations, continues to be an unanswered and politically sensitive question between EU member states...|$|R
