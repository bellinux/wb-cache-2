Since there is little space between the fibula body and the pin (there is no arch to the body), plate fibulae could not be used to fasten much material and were therefore mainly decorative. Most plate fibulae have a <b>hinge</b> <b>assembly</b> on the back. Plate fibulae are generally associated with women’s graves. The most common forms of plate fibula in the 1st century AD were round (disc), diamond, oval and lunula (crescent- or moon-shaped).|$|E

40|$|A {{modification}} to {{a recently}} developed test specimen designed to investigate migration of a delamination between neighboring ply interfaces in tape laminates is presented. The specimen is a cross-ply laminated beam consisting of 40 plies with a polytetrafluoroethylene insert spanning part way along its length. The insert is located between a lower 0 -degree ply (specimen length direction) and {{a stack of}} four 90 -degree plies (specimen width direction). The modification involved a stacking sequence that promotes stable delamination growth prior to migration, and included a relocation of the insert from the specimen midplane to the interface between plies 14 and 15. Specimens were clamped at both ends onto a rigid baseplate and loaded on their upper surface via a piano <b>hinge</b> <b>assembly,</b> resulting in a predominantly flexural loading condition. Tests were conducted with the load-application point positioned at various locations along a specimen's span. This position affected the sequence of damage events during a test...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{regulation}} of cation content {{is critical for}} cell growth. However, the molecular mechanisms that gate the systems that control K+ movements remain unclear. KTN is a highly conserved cytoplasmic domain present ubiquitously {{in a variety of}} prokaryotic and eukaryotic K+ channels and transporters. Here we report crystal structures for two representative KTN domains that reveal a dimeric <b>hinged</b> <b>assembly.</b> Alternative ligands NAD+ and NADH block or vacate, respectively, the hinge region affecting the dimer's conformational flexibility. Conserved, surface-exposed hydrophobic patches that become coplanar upon hinge closure provide an assembly interface for KTN tetramerization. Mutational analysis using the KefC system demonstrates that this domain directly interacts with its respective transmembrane constituent, coupling ligand-mediated KTN conformational changes to the permease's activity...|$|R
50|$|A {{rocket motor}} with a thrust of 280 pounds-force (1.25 kN or 127 kgf) was chosen. The pack with its fuel weighed 125 lb (57 kg). The pack had a {{fiberglass}} frame contoured {{to fit the}} operator's body, secured with straps, and cylinders of fuel and nitrogen were attached to the frame. The motor was fastened using a <b>hinged</b> <b>assembly</b> that was controlled by levers under the shoulders while thrust was controlled through a regulator assembly connected to a throttle handle on the right lever of the device. The handle on the left lever governed the slant of the (jetavators) nozzles. Tests of the pack began {{toward the end of}} 1960 and were performed in a large hangar with a safety tether. Wendell Moore completed the first 20 tethered takeoffs while making incremental improvements.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{objective}} of this work is to provide fast approximations of force/work/energy calculations for designers of assemblies in which interference is required. In this paper, the subjects of interest are assemblies {{in which there are}} several sets of features that can influence the final location of the parts, once assembled. The analysis includes a systematic approach in developing an analytical model involving basic laws of equilibrium and more advanced finite element based models to estimate the work required for assembly and the total strain energy in the components after assembly is complete. In this approach, an ideal press-fit type interference assembly is considered initially and solution methodology is developed. A non-symmetric <b>hinge</b> <b>assembly</b> with multiple interferences is analyzed later with the developed approach and the results are compared with the experimental observations. The suitability of the GapSpace assembly analysis method [1] for assemblies in which there is interference between the components is also investigated...|$|E
40|$|A new 2 -DOF microgripper, {{which can}} perform the {{processing}} of the objects assembly and biological cells injection, is designed and modeled in this paper. The clamping action of the microgripper with the x direction is completed, however, when anything is clamped by the end effector, which can be completely driven by an actuator generated in y direction, at lastclamping and pushing motion are realized. The flexure hinge, which takes place of the conventional joint, is used as the translational and rotational hinges in the new structure. Otherwise, the whole microgripper is monolithic processing, which can efficiently overcome the disadvantages of the conventional hinge with friction, backlash, anderrors caused by the <b>hinge</b> <b>assembly.</b> Firstly, a kind of novel microgripper is designed in this paper, which can accomplish two-dimensional independent motions including a separate grip and single track push without interfering with each other. The bridge type amplifying structure with two-end output is adopted in the gripper to increase the motion range and {{the capacity of the}} microgripper. The piezoelectric actuator with fast response and high resolution is used as the drive element. Secondly, the geometrical and kinematical models are established and the formulas of the amplifying ratio, stiffness, maximum stress, and the natural frequency of this model are calculated, respectively. Finally, the FEM (finite element modeling) based on ANSYS software is built up to validate the formulas...|$|E
40|$|A fin-stiffened strut concept which {{possesses}} high {{bending stiffness}} and low packaged volume {{has been identified}} for use on large space structures. The concept incorporates three curved fins which deploy from a core tube to increase the effective cross-sectional moment of inertia, the buckling load, and the vibration frequency of the strut. A strut design incorporating welded fin connections provides an upper bound of the strut buckling load. A strut design which allows the individual fins and core to move independently in the strut axial direction provides a lower bound of the strut buckling load which is approximately 20 to 25 percent of the upper bound. A practical strut design, incorporating <b>hinge</b> <b>assemblies</b> which constrain the fins to move together but independently of the core tube in the strut axial direction, provides a buckling load which is 75 to 80 percent of the upper bound. Euler's equation {{can be used to}} accurately predict buckling loads for the bounding designs. Flat plate finite element models of all designs give results that agree to within 10 percent of the experimental values. Equivalent beam models of the strut give results which are slightly less accurate...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} surface micromachined <b>hinged</b> {{structure}} <b>assembly</b> using thermo-kinetic {{forces in the}} molecular flow regime. Ultrasonic vibration energy is used to reduce the static friction making the thermo-kinetic force comparatively significant. The thermo-kinetic force, resulting from the more energetic gas molecules emanating from the heated substrate, increases with pressure and substrate temperature in the molecular flow regime. The transition from viscous to molecular regime occurs as the molecular mean-free-path approximately equals the flap length, making the pressure threshold for thermo-kinetic flap actuation size dependent. In addition to the experimental results, one-dimensional and two-dimensional force models are presented.

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, {{a method}} of using a root <b>hinge</b> drive <b>assembly</b> (RHDA) to control the solar array {{deployment}} is provided and a multi-DOF mechanism dynamic model {{of the system is}} established. In this way, the root hinge torque can be calculated iteratively. Then taking the predicted torque as a reference, a RHDA is designed for a large multiple-stage packaging and deployable solar array system. The control effect of the drive assembly is validated by ground tests. The test results indicate that the solar arrays can be deployed smoothly, and the deployment velocities are restricted by the drive assembly as expected. During the tests, the RHDA output speed and output torque are obtained. In order to examine the impact force when the yoke is lock-up with a hard stop, dynamics simulations are performed according to the actual behavior. The simulation result indicates that the designed RHDA reduces the impact force significantly and improves the lock-up reliability effectively...|$|R

40|$|Currently in the United Kingdom {{there are}} over 100 bridges {{containing}} hinge joint components,introduced to simplify and standardise designs. Visual inspection of hinge joints notedbridge deck waterproofing failure, which can cause steel reinforcement bar corrosion. This reinforcement {{is crucial to the}} integrity of the joint, and the loss of reinforcement section can inducehigher stresses leading to eventual failure by yielding. The Transport Research Laboratory createda model of two <b>hinge</b> joint <b>assemblies</b> typical of those found in reinforced concrete slabbridges. The model had notched reinforcement bars at the hinges. The aim of this investigationwas to determine the effectiveness of the acoustic emission (AE) technique in detecting and locatingthe cracking of concrete at the throat. AE sensors were attached to the steel reinforcementbars using waveguides and to the concrete face of the model. The model was statically loadeduntil failure. To allow the visual inspection and logging of concrete cracking around the throat,the load was applied in stages with a brief hold period between each stage.

40|$|The In-Space Telescope Assembly Robotics (ISTAR) {{project has}} {{proposed}} an architecture {{for a large}} robotically-assembled telescope in space, comprised of many deployable truss modules. The truss modules {{are based on the}} Pactruss deployment scheme and are equipped with Rolamite tape spring <b>hinges.</b> Fabrication and <b>assembly</b> errors that arise from bulk manufacturing the modules may make the deployment unreliable. A simulation toolkit has been developed to characterize the deployment behavior of the module in the presence of such errors. This paper first outlines the details of the toolkit, including the truss model, the Rolamite hinge model, and the simulation methodology. It then describes the experiment designed to validate the toolkit. A module was constructed and deployed while tracking the displacements of a select node and the rotations of the Rolamite hinges. The measured shape of this module was recreated in the simulation model and the same parameters were obtained. It was found that the experimental and simulated nodal displacements matched within 10 %. The experimental hinge behavior was generally captured in the simulation, with some discrepancies in the latching of one hinge. The possible causes for the discrepancies and ongoing work to improve the results are discussed in the paper...|$|R
40|$|Core {{particles}} of hepatitis B virus are assembled from dimers {{of a single}} 185 -residue (subtype adw) viral capsid or core protein (p 21. 5) which possesses two distinct domains: residues 1 to 144 form a minimal capsid assembly domain, and the arginine-rich, carboxyl-terminal residues 150 to 185 form a protamine-like domain that mediates nucleic acid binding. Little {{is known about the}} topography of the p 21. 5 polypeptide within either the p 21. 5 capsids or dimers. Here, using site-specific proteases and monoclonal antibodies, we have defined the accessibility of p 21. 5 residues in dimers and capsids assembled from wild-type and mutant hepatitis B virus core proteins in Xenopus oocytes and in vitro. The data reveal the protamine region to be accessible to external reagents in p 21. 5 dimers but largely cryptic in wild-type capsids. Strikingly, in capsids the only protease target region was a 9 -residue peptide covering p 21. 5 residues Glu- 145 to Asp- 153, which falls largely between the two core protein domains. By analogy with protease-sensitive interdomain regions in other proteins, we propose that this peptide constitutes a <b>hinge</b> between the <b>assembly</b> and nucleic acid binding domains of p 21. 5. We further found that deletion or replacement of the terminal Cys- 185 residue greatly increased surface exposure of the protamine tails in capsids, suggesting that a known disulfide linkage involving this residue tethers the protamine region inside the core particles. We propose that disruption of this disulfide linkage allows the protamine region to appear transiently {{on the surface of the}} core particle...|$|R
