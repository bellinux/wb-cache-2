5|$|Heterodontosaurus is the eponymous {{and best}} known {{member of the}} family Heterodontosauridae. This family is {{considered}} one of the most primitive or basal <b>groups</b> <b>within</b> <b>the</b> order of ornithischian dinosaurs. In spite of the large tusks, Heterodontosaurus is thought to have been herbivorous, or at least omnivorous. Though it was formerly thought to have been capable of quadrupedal locomotion, it is now thought to have been bipedal. Tooth replacement was sporadic and not continuous, unlike its relatives. At least four other heterodontosaurid genera are known from the same geological formations as Heterodontosaurus.|$|E

5|$|It {{is unclear}} how {{initiation}} may have affected a devotee's rank within the cult. After going through his third initiation, Lucius becomes a pastophoros, {{a member of a}} particular class of priests. If the third initiation was a requirement for becoming a pastophoros, it is possible that members moved up in the cult hierarchy by going through the series of initiations. Nevertheless, Apuleius refers to initiates and to priests as if they are separate <b>groups</b> <b>within</b> <b>the</b> cult. Initiation may have been a prerequisite for a devotee to become a priest but not have automatically made him or her into one.|$|E
5|$|More recent {{research}} by Gary Nunn of the American Museum of Natural History (1996) {{and other researchers}} around the world studied the mitochondrial DNA of all 14 accepted species, finding four, not two, monophyletic <b>groups</b> <b>within</b> <b>the</b> albatrosses. They proposed the resurrection {{of two of the}} old genus names, Phoebastria for the North Pacific albatrosses and Thalassarche for the mollymawks, with the great albatrosses retaining Diomedea and the sooty albatrosses staying in Phoebetria. Both the British Ornithologists' Union and the South African authorities split the albatrosses into four genera as Nunn suggested, and the change has been accepted by the majority of researchers.|$|E
5|$|Overlordship was {{a central}} feature of Anglo-Saxon {{politics}} which began before Æthelberht's time; kings were described as overlords {{as late as the}} ninth century.

Once the new states began to form, conflicts among them began. Tribute from dependents could lead to wealth.

They back up their analyses with two Soviet intelligence defectors.|$|E
5|$|As {{a proponent}} of {{religious}} reform, Henry gave extensively to reformist <b>groups</b> <b>within</b> <b>the</b> Church. He was a keen supporter of the Cluniac order, probably for intellectual reasons. He donated money to the abbey at Cluny itself, and after 1120 gave generously to Reading Abbey, a Cluniac establishment. Construction on Reading began in 1121, and Henry endowed it with rich lands and extensive privileges, making it a symbol of his dynastic lines. He also focused effort on promoting the conversion of communities of clerks into Augustinian canons, the foundation of leper hospitals, expanding the provision of nunneries, and the charismatic orders of the Savigniacs and Tironensians. He was an avid collector of relics, sending an embassy to Constantinople in 1118 to collect Byzantine items, {{some of which were}} donated to Reading Abbey.|$|E
5|$|By the 1980s, most {{researchers}} considered the heterodontosaurids {{as a distinct}} family of primitive ornithischian dinosaurs, but with an uncertain position with respect to other <b>groups</b> <b>within</b> <b>the</b> order. By the early 21st century, the prevailing theories were that the family was the sister group of either the Marginocephalia (which includes pachycephalosaurids and ceratopsians), or the Cerapoda (the former group plus ornithopods), or {{as one of the}} most basal radiations of ornithischians, before the split of the Genasauria (which includes the derived ornithischians). Heterodontosauridae was defined as a clade by Sereno in 1998 and 2005, and the group shares skull features such as three or fewer teeth in each premaxilla, caniniform teeth followed by a diastema, and a jugal horn below the eye. In 2017, similarities between the skeletons of Heterodontosaurus and the early theropod Eoraptor were used to suggest that ornithischians should be grouped with theropods in a group called Ornithoscelida. Traditionally, theropods have been grouped with sauropodomorphs in the group Saurischia.|$|E

5|$|In a {{study done}} at Masoala Peninsula on red ruffed lemurs three levels of {{organization}} were identified and defined: communities, core groups, and subgroups. Communities are individuals that affiliated regularly with each other, but rarely with conspecifics outside of the community. Although the entire multi-male/multi-female community lives within a discrete home range, all individuals are never seen in the same location at the same time. Instead, individuals form dispersed social networks, known as core <b>groups,</b> <b>within</b> <b>the</b> community. Core groups are individuals that shared the same core area within a community territory throughout the year. Core groups typically consist of two reproductive females, as well as reproductive males and subadults, {{ranging in size from}} two individuals to nine. Females within the groups are cooperative, but male encounters are often agonistic. Subgroups, on the other hand, vary daily in size, composition, and duration, and consist of associated individuals from either the same core group or different core groups, depending on the season. It is from the consistent, daily changes in these subgroups that occur throughout the year, as well as the seasonal formations of core groups in core areas, that demonstrate the fission-fusion nature of ruffed lemur social structure.|$|E
5|$|Relations had {{apparently}} warmed between Tyndall and Jordan, for they met {{up after the}} latter {{was released from prison}} in 1968, and Tyndall again met with Jordan in Coventry in 1972, there inviting him to join the NF. However, a poor showing in the February 1974 general election resulted in Tyndall being challenged by two <b>groups</b> <b>within</b> <b>the</b> party, the 'Strasserites' and the 'Populists', the latter of whom were largely Powellite ex-members of the Conservative Party. The Populist challenge was successful and in October 1974 Tyndall was replaced as chairman by John Kingsley Read. Tyndall then used Spearhead as a vehicle to criticise rival factions with the NF. As a result, he was expelled from the party during a disciplinary tribunal in November 1975. Tyndall took the issue to the high court, who overturned the expulsion. The 'Populists' then left the party, splitting to form the National Party in January 1976, which for a short time proved more electorally successful than the NF. Back in the party and with his main rivals gone, Tyndall regained the position of chairman.|$|E
5|$|The AFM's {{national}} representative body is the triennial General Business Meeting. Its main function is {{the election of}} the national officers: president, deputy president, general secretary and general treasurer. The four national officers always represent the significant ethnic <b>groups</b> <b>within</b> <b>the</b> church. Each local assembly is entitled to send a pastor and a delegate as voting members. Additional voting members are members of the National Leadership Forum, members of standing committees, one additional member representing each church department and one additional representative of the church's theological training institutions. Before 2000, the General Business Meeting was known as the Workers Council, met annually, and possessed greater power. After the adoption of the new constitution, most of the body's power was transferred to the National Leadership Forum.|$|E

The Campaign for Nationalism in Scotland formed itself to try to ensure that the SNP avoided traditional debates of left and right, arguing that the cause of Scottish independence transcended such arguments. It had the support of prominent traditionalists inside the party such as Winnie Ewing who had been a Member of Parliament in the 1960s and was by this stage a Member of the European Parliament.|$|R

5|$|The SSR Abkhazia was an {{ethnically diverse}} region. The {{demographics}} of Abkhazia shifted considerably {{in the decades}} following its annexation by Russia. Large numbers of ethnic Abkhaz had been deported {{in the late nineteenth}} century, with up to 100,000 expelled, mainly sent to the Ottoman Empire. The result was that by the time the SSR Abkhazia was formed, ethnic Abkhaz comprised less than 30% of the population (55,918), which numbered 201,016 according to the 1926 Soviet census, the only census conducted during the existence of the SSR Abkhazia. The korenizatsiia policy implemented in this era, which was to promote minority <b>groups</b> <b>within</b> <b>the</b> USSR, saw the numbers of Abkhaz increase: between 1922 and 1926, ethnic Abkhaz grew by roughly 8%, and constituted about 27.8% of the population; in this same time-frame, the number of ethnic Georgians fell from 42% to 36% (67,494). Other major ethnic groups counted in the 1926 census were Armenians (25,677, or 12.7%), Greeks (14,045, or 7%), and Russians (12,553, or 6.2%).|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} master plan granted outline planning permission for a 250-bed hotel {{of five to}} six storeys in height. However, property development and investment company The Beetham Organization Ltd, which has in recent years built several high-profile hotels, offices and other buildings in prominent city-centre locations in Britain, bought Block J in November 2004 and submitted a revised planning application (BH2005/00136/FP) early in 2005. This sought approval for a mixed-use development comprising one 42-storey building with 146 residential units (C3-category) and a hotel with ancillary facilities including a restaurant, cafés, conference facilities and a health and fitness centre; one six-storey building with retail units (A1- and A3-category) and a further 25 residential units; and a pedestrianised public square. The application was rejected on 20 separate counts, including the negative visual impact on surrounding listed buildings such as the railway station and St Bartholomew's Church; the reduction in quality of surrounding public spaces; the lack of provision of outdoor recreation space; {{negative effect on the}} surrounding microclimate, and loss of sunlight to nearby buildings; and the failure to consider fully the impact on transport. The reasons for the rejection were supported by various people and <b>groups</b> <b>within</b> <b>the</b> city, such as The Regency Society, which is involved with planning and conservation matters in Brighton and Hove.|$|E
5|$|The war had {{its origins}} in the long-running dispute between the Hutu and Tutsi <b>groups</b> <b>within</b> <b>the</b> Rwandan population. The ancient Kingdom of Rwanda, ruled by Tutsi kings, began {{implementing}} increasingly anti-Hutu policies in the 19th century, a trend continued by European colonial authorities from 1895. Both Germany and Belgium ruled through the kings and favoured the Tutsi. The Hutu population revolted in 1959, {{with the support of}} Belgium, which had effected a sudden reversal of allegiance. Hutu activists burned Tutsi homes, killed those who fought back, and ultimately established an independent, Hutu-dominated state in 1962. The revolution forced more than 100,000 Tutsi to seek refuge in neighbouring countries. These refugees lived in exile for several decades, agitating for a return to Rwanda, but were not capable of mounting a serious attack. Some refugees, including future RPF leaders Fred Rwigyema and Paul Kagame, fought in the Ugandan Bush War with Yoweri Museveni, becoming senior army officers in 1986 under Museveni's presidency. Relations between the refugees and the Ugandans soured in the late 1980s with Rwigyema and Kagame demoted, but Hutu president Habyarimana refused to allow the return of refugees. This created a strong desire among refugees to return by force, so Rwigyema and Kagame used their military expertise to turn the RPF into a battle-ready army.|$|E
