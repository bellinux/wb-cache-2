40|$|The {{vertical}} transmission of HIV- 1 {{from the mother}} to fetus is known, but the molecular mechanism regulating this transmission is not fully characterized. The fetus is highly protected by the placenta, which does not permit microbial pathogens to cross the placental barrier. In the present study, a rat model was established to observe the effect of HIV- 1 protein Nef on placental barrier. Evans blue dye was used to assay permeability of placental barrier and fourteen day pregnant Sprague Dawley rats were injected intravenously with 2 % Evans blue dye along with various concentrations of recombinant Nef. After an hour, animals were sacrificed and <b>dye</b> <b>migration</b> was observed through the assimilation of peripheral blood into fetus. Interestingly, traces of recombinant Nef protein were detected in the embryo as well as amniotic fluid and amniotic membrane along with placenta and uterus. Our study indicates that recombinant HIV- 1 -Nef protein breaches the placental barrier and allows the migration of Evans blue dye to the growing fetus. Further the concentration of Nef protein in blood is directly proportional to the intensity of <b>dye</b> <b>migration</b> and {{to the amount of}} Nef protein detected in uterus, placenta, amniotic membrane, amniotic fluid and embryo. Based on this study, it can be concluded that the HIV- 1 Nef protein has a direct effect on breaching of the placental barrier in the model we have established in this study.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Theories {{concerning}} the optical properties of cationic dyes adsorbed on clay surfaces are analysed in detail. An {{investigation of the}} aggregation of methylene blue (MB) in montmorillonite dispersions is conducted using visible (VIS) spectroscopy. The effects of the dye/ clay ratio and of the swelling properties of the montmorillonite substrate on dye aggregation are compared {{in terms of the}} effect of clay layer charge. The observed influence on dye aggregation was almost negligible for both swelling and dye loading. The layer charge of the silicate determines the extent and the type of dye aggregation in freshly prepared MB/montmorillonite dispersions. Observed spectral changes with time indicate a rearrangement and redistribution of dye H-aggregates (band close to 570 nm) to monomers (660 nm), dimers (605 nm) and J-aggregates (760 nm). Dye aggregates are probably already formed during <b>dye</b> cation <b>migration</b> in the vicinity of clay colloid particles. The extent and the type of initially formed species are probably affected by the electric double layer of clay layers. After reaching the clay surface, dye cation assemblies are rearranged and decompose as described above. Reaching chemical equilibrium, dye cations adjust the distribution of the layer charge, in order that each cation could balance the charge due to one unequivalent substitution...|$|R

After the staining of such samples, the green color persists, while the other unpigmented protein complexes and the molecular standard remain CBB stained, creating a useful reference system for the assignment of the bands.

For analysis of the mechanism of action, protein kinase C (PKC) activity was measured. RESULTS: The IC(50) varied between 7. 0 and 10. 5 microM for all APCs tested. At this concentration, all four APCs inhibited HTF migration and cell-mediated collagen gel contraction in the presence of serum. The inhibitory effects on HTF proliferation, migration, and contraction were observed at nontoxic concentrations. PKC activity was reduced to 50 % of control level at the IC(50) of all APCs applied.

40|$|Wound healing occurs {{through the}} {{processes}} of cell proliferation (mitosis) and/or cell migration. The corneal endothelium in humans {{is known to be}} mostly non-proliferative. As a result, wounds in the corneal endothelium heal by migration. A 21 -amino acid peptide called Endothelin- 1 (ET- 1) is studied in the Crawford research lab and is a known mitogen, i. e. increases cell proliferation. Data suggests that Endothelin- 1 can stimulate cell proliferation in the corneal endothelium. This fact led to the first hypothesis that ET- 1 stimulated wound closure in this cell layer. I explored this hypothesis using a bovine model of corneal endothelial cells isolated and grown in 10 % calf-serum DMEM media. Half the cells were treated with ET- 1 and the other half were left in media alone (control). The cells were wounded mechanically and allowed to heal for 72 -hours with photo micrographs taken every 24 -hour to record wound closure. The data suggested that ET- 1 stimulated wound closure because the cells treated with ET- 1 had a higher percent wound closure when compared to the control. This experiment was modified to test my second hypothesis, that inhibition of cell proliferation would inhibit wound closure. In this experiment, half the cells were treated with 5 -Flurouracil, an inhibitor of cell proliferation. The data showed that the prescence of 5 -FU decreased the percentage of wound closure, but did not eliminate it. ET- 1 was still able to increase wound closure in the presence of 5 -FU by 10. 8 % compared to the cells treated with 5 -FU alone. My third hypothesis then became that ET- 1 stimulates cell migration. I explored this hypothesis using a chemotaxis assay. The endothelial cells were loaded with Calcein-AM, a fluorescent <b>dye,</b> and <b>migration</b> was examined with a Chemotx chemotaxis system. The cells were treated with serum free media (control), 0. 1 nM ET- 1, 1 nM ET- 1, 10 nM ET- 1, or serum (positive control). They were allowed to incubate for 48 -hours and fluorescence of migrated cells was recorded. The data suggests that ET- 1 stimulates wound healing, promotes wound closure in the absence of proliferation, and that ET- 1 stimulates cell migration...|$|R

30|$|Wool fiber {{strength}} and handle is damaged by holding for prolonged periods at normal dyeing temperatures (98  °C). Lower dyeing temperatures {{can be employed}} to color wool whilst reducing damage caused to the fiber. However, these lower temperature dyeing processes often have a long dyeing time and/or require the addition of chemicals to achieve adequate dye exhaustion and migration. The use of ultrasonic irradiation was used to reduce dyeing times and temperatures whilst increasing <b>dye</b> <b>migration</b> and fastness. It has used 30  kHz frequency level, effective power of 120 and 350  W heating power in ultrasonic machine. In this work, wool dyeing was carried out on single jersey knitted fabric using an acid dye with and without ultrasonic irradiation at 60, 70, and 80  °C. Dye exhaustion was measured using UV/visible absorbance of the dye bath {{before and during the}} dyeing cycle. For the measurement of nodal/anti-nodal point of energy, at 60, 70, and 80  °C dyeing was done in open bath of ultrasonic machine with and without sonication at high liquor ratio. To compare the dye uptake (%) at high/conventional process, sample was dyed at 95  °C. Optical and scanning electron microscopy were used to measure the diameter and surface changes of the fiber, respectively. Wash and rub fastness was measured on the dyed fabrics after rinsing and drying. Ultrasonic irradiation during the dyeing of wool caused an increase in the dye exhaustion rate for acid dye. This change in rate {{is believed to have been}} caused by a reduction in the viscous boundary layer of liquor surrounding the fiber present in an ultrasonic irradiated environment.

40|$|Microglia, {{the immune}} {{cells of the}} central nervous system, are {{attracted}} to sites of injury. The injury releases adenosine triphosphate (ATP) into the extracellular space, activating the microglia, but the full mechanism of release is not known. In glial cells, a family of physiologically regulated unpaired gap junction channels called innexons (invertebrates) or pannexons (vertebrates) located in the cell membrane is permeable to ATP. Innexons, but not pannexons, also pair to make gap junctions. Glial calcium waves, triggered by injury or mechanical stimulation, open pannexon/innexon channels and cause the release of ATP. It has been hypothesized that a glial calcium wave that triggers the release of ATP causes rapid microglial migration to distant lesions. In the present study in the leech, in which a single giant glial cell ensheathes each connective, hydrolysis of ATP with 10 U/ml apyrase or block of innexons with 10 µM carbenoxolone (CBX), which decreased injury-induced ATP release, reduced both movement of microglia and their accumulation at lesions. Directed movement and accumulation were restored in CBX by adding ATP, consistent with separate actions of ATP and nitric oxide, which is required for directed movement but does not activate glia. Injection of glia with innexin 2 (Hminx 2) RNAi inhibited release of carboxyfluorescein <b>dye</b> and microglial <b>migration,</b> whereas injection of innexin 1 (Hminx 1) RNAi did not when measured 2 days after injection, indicating that glial cells’ ATP release through innexons was required for microglial migration after nerve injury. Focal stimulation either mechanically or with ATP generated a calcium wave in the glial cell; injury caused a large, persistent intracellular calcium response. Neither the calcium wave nor the persistent response required ATP or its release. Thus, in the leech, innexin membrane channels releasing ATP from glia are required for migration and accumulation of microglia after nerve injury...|$|R
40|$|Connexins (C×s) are {{a family}} of transmembrane {{proteins}} that form hemichannels and gap junctions (GJs) on the cell membranes, and transfer small signaling molecules between the cytoplasm and extracellular space and between connecting cells, respectively. Among C×s, suppressing C× 43 expression or function promotes skin wound closure and granulation tissue formation, and may alleviate scarring, but the mechanisms are not well understood. Oral mucosal gingiva is characterized by faster wound closure and scarless wound healing outcome as compared to skin wounds. Therefore, we hypothesized that C× 43 function is down regulated during human gingival wound healing, which in fibroblasts promotes expression of genes conducive for fast and scarless wound healing. Cultured gingival fibroblasts expressed C× 43 as their major connexin. Immunostaining of unwounded human gingiva showed that C× 43 was abundantly present in the epithelium, and in connective tissue formed large C× 43 plaques in fibroblasts. At {{the early stages of}} wound healing, C× 43 was strongly down regulated in wound epithelial cells and fibroblasts, returning to the level of normal tissue by day 60 post-wounding. Blocking of C× 43 function by C× 43 mimetic peptide Gap 27 suppressed GJ-mediated <b>dye</b> transfer, promoted <b>migration,</b> and caused significant changes in the expression of wound healing-associated genes in gingival fibroblasts. In particular, out of 54 genes analyzed, several MMPs and TGF-β 1, involved in regulation of inflammation and extracellular matrix (ECM) turnover, and VEGF-A, involved in angiogenesis, were significantly upregulated while pro-fibrotic ECM molecules, including Collagen type I, and cell contractility-related molecules were significantly down regulated. These responses involved MAPK, GSK 3 α/β and TGF-β signaling pathways, and AP 1 and SP 1 transcription factors. Thus, suppressed function of C× 43 in fibroblasts promotes their migration, and regulates expression of wound healing-associated genes via AP 1, SP 1, MAPK, GSK 3 α/β and TGF-β signaling pathways, and may promote fast and scarless wound healing in human gingiva...|$|R

40|$|The Detector Development Group at the University of Florida has {{identified}} {{the only known}} optically radiation hard polymer, scintillator and wavelength shifter materials. The authors summarize their findings here. They conducted an extensive study of siloxane polymers using monomers of dimethyl, diphenyl and methylphenyl siloxanes. An important finding of that study was that polymethylphenylsiloxane is a candidate polymer for use at the SSC. However, the most important result of that work was the demonstration {{of the existence of}} optical polymers with extreme resistance to radiation damage. It held out the promise that other possibly more convenient polymers with similar properties could be identified. The first high viscosity, transparent, radiation hard siloxane with high fluor solubility was processed into prototype plates. The authors propose a mechanism to account for radiation induced annealable color center formation in commercial scintillator polymers such as PS and PMMA. The authors produced analogues of these polymers with T{sub g} < room temperatures. These polymers are optically radiation hard. The University of Florida has applied for a patent on this breakthrough discovery. It was found that dye mobility for radiation hard elastomers (T{sub g} < room temperature) was unacceptable over a period of one year. Dyes would tend to crystallize {{on the surface of the}} plates. The work concentrated therefore on thermoplastic polymers which had T{sub g} {approximately} 50 C (i. e., high enough for structural stability) and with high color center annealing rate such as polyisobutylmethacrylate. These polymers were both radiation hard and had minimal <b>dye</b> <b>migration.</b> The University of Florida has a patent on these materials.

Aims: The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the apical dye leakage of samples obturated with EndoREZ and RoekoSeal root canal sealers with reference to the timing (immediate and delayed) of post space preparation. Settings and Design: An in vitro study using extracted human teeth as study samples and the method of apical dye penetration to determine the apical micro-leakage microscopically. Materials and Methods: Seventy single-rooted anterior extracted teeth were instrumented and divided into ix groups; fifteen teeth in groups 1, 2, 3, and 4 and five teeth in groups 5 and 6. In groups 1 and 2, specimens were obturated with warm vertical compaction and EndoREZ sealer. In groups 3 and 4, specimens were obturated with warm vertical compaction and RoekoSeal sealer. Immediate post space was prepared in groups 1 and 3. The samples in groups 2 and 4, the post space was prepared after placing the teeth in saline at 37 °C for 1 week. Groups 5 and 6 represented positive and negative controls, respectively. The samples were then placed in methylene blue for 72 hours. The samples were then sectioned longitudinally and the amount of linear apical <b>dye</b> <b>migration</b> was evaluated.

40|$|Jennifer Jae GutierrezInkjet {{prints are}} a new medium {{in the field of}} art {{conservation}} in relation to other art forms. In order to establish why inkjet prints should be cared for, familiarity with the history and current uses of inkjet prints is necessary. An understanding of the materials which create inkjet prints is essential in determining protocol for their care and treatment. Inkjet prints may be damaged by a variety of sources, and the longevity of inkjet prints may vary based upon which combination of materials has been chosen. Establishing protocol for surface cleaning inkjet prints is a need within the field of art conservation, and was determined to be the goal of this project. The materials tested are widely used to create fine-art inkjet prints. The Epson Stylus Pro 4800 printer was chosen for this reason, and because it employs the K 3 Ultrachrome ink set, which is pigment based. Two different microporous inkjet papers, Epson Ultra Premium Photo Paper Luster and Ilford Galerie Gold Fibre Silk, were tested. A digital file, or ???target,??? was designed using well-known color space values, and used to create twelve sample prints. Preliminary quantitative measurements of changes in color were made, as well as qualitative analysis of surface sheen and <b>dye</b> <b>migration.</b> This analysis was repeated after testing. The cleaning solutions tested were deionized water, a water and ethanol solution, and a PhotoFlo and water solution. These materials were chosen because they are common cleaning agents which are likely {{to be found in the}} labs of most photograph conservators. Two cleaning techniques were tested; application with a cotton swab and full immersion. Results suggest that two of the cleaning materials used may be acceptable for future treatment of inkjet prints. Ethanol and water was determined to be inappropriate for cleaning the inkjet materials tested in this study, and immersion was determined to be inappropriate for prints created on Ilford Galerie Gold Fibre Silk. Cleaning with cotton swabs produced noticeable changes in surface sheen in paper white areas, but this technique may be acceptable for image areas. Further research of alternative cleaning methods and materials is suggested to yield conclusive results. Alumni Relations at the University of Delaware and Undergraduate Research Program.

By ultrafiltration, 69. 18 % of Se in the extract was found as a low molecular weight soluble form, the remaining 30. 82 % was bound to high molecular weight components. After a cation-exchange chromatography of the ultrafiltrate, 3. 77 % of the Se in the extract {{was found in the}} aqueous washings of the column indicating the presence of free inorganic anions of Se; the 65. 41 % of Se retained on the column corresponded to the free organic Se cations. The limit of detection for the HPLC-THG-AAS system was 1. 85 ng of Se. Se was shown to be widely distributed over all the proteins with one sharp peak corresponding to the free forms of Se. Four major peaks were found at MW $>$ 250 000 Da (15. 97 % of Se recovered), between 102 330 and 117 490 Da (7. 06 %), between 48 977 and 53 703 Da (12. 71 %) and close to the <b>dye</b> <b>migration</b> band (17. 25 %). Selective isolation and HPLC-AAS protocols were also developed and optimized for the determination of free organic forms e. g. selenomethionine (SeMet), selenocystine (SeCystine) and inorganic forms of selenium in aqueous solutions, and in complex matrices such as nutritional supplements and mixtures of free amino acids. The selenoamino acid in alkaline solution was first derivatized with 1 -fluoro- 2, 4 -dinitrobenzene. After removal of excess of reagent by partitioning with diethyl ether, the N-dinitrophenyl (DNP) -derivatized selenoamino acid was acidified and extracted with diethyl ether. Inorganic Se(IV) was extracted from the acidic aqueous phases by complexation with 1, 2 -phenylenediamine, forming a piazselenol. Se derivatives were determined selectively by HPLC-THG-AAS. A selective chromatographic mechanism based on $ pi$-electron interactions was optimized using a silica stationary phase derivatized with p-nitrophenyl moieties. Co-injections of DNP-SeMet, DNP-SeCystine and piazselenol save retention times of 3. 7, 4. 0 and 4. 9 min, respectively, using a methanolic mobile phase containing 1. 5 % triethylamine and 0. 013 M acetic acid. Primary analytical validation parameters including stability, linearity and limits of detection were obtained using purified DNP-SeMet, DNP-SeCystine and piazselenol standards which were characterized by $ sp 1 $H-, $ sp{ 13 }$C- and $ sp{ 77 }$Se-NMR analysis and/or fast atom bombardment MS techniques. The calibration graphs for sequential dilutions of these Se standards were linear and the limits of detection from the resultant calibration graphs were 17 ng, 0. 21 ng and 18. 53 ng of Se, respectively. The purified DNP-SeMet and DNP-SeCystine were found to be photosensitive. The recovery of SeMet, SeCystine and inorganic Se from the stock solutions and/or nutritional supplements was virtually quantitative.
