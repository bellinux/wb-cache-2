40|$|OBJECTIVES: To define near-normal {{values of}} {{extravascular}} lung water <b>indexed</b> <b>to</b> body weight in children. DESIGN: Prospective multicenter observational study. SETTING: Medical/surgical PICUs of 5 multinational hospitals. PATIENTS: Fifty-eight {{children with a}} median age of 4 years (range 1 month to 17 year) with heterogeneous PICU admission diagnoses were included. Extravascular lung water measurements from these children were collected after resolution of their illness. Obtained values were <b>indexed</b> <b>to</b> actual body weight and height and subsequently related to age. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Extravascular lung water <b>indexed</b> <b>to</b> body weight correlated with age (r 2 = 0. 7) and could be categorized in three-age groups consisting of significantly different median extravascular lung water <b>indexed</b> <b>to</b> body weight values (5 th- 95 th percentile) : less than 1 year, 9 - 29 mL/kg; 1 - 5 years, 7 - 25 mL/kg; and 5 - 17 years, 5 - 13 mL/kg. Extravascular lung water <b>indexed</b> <b>to</b> height did not correlate to age and resulted in an age-independent near-normal value of less than 315 mL/m. CONCLUSIONS: Younger children have higher values of extravascular lung water <b>indexed</b> <b>to</b> actual body weight. Age categorized near-normal values of extravascular lung water <b>indexed</b> <b>to</b> body weight are presented for possible clinical use. Furthermore, we suggest <b>to</b> <b>index</b> extravascular lung water to height, {{which seems to be}} age independent...|$|R

5|$|Devised by the American {{climatologist}} and geographer C. W. Thornthwaite, {{this climate}} classification method monitors the soil water budget using evapotranspiration. It monitors {{the portion of}} total precipitation used to nourish vegetation over a certain area. It uses indices such as a humidity index and an aridity <b>index</b> <b>to</b> determine an area's moisture regime based upon its average temperature, average rainfall, and average vegetation type. The lower {{the value of the}} index in any given area, the drier the area is.|$|E
5|$|On {{taking office}} as Chancellor of the Exchequer Brown gave the Bank of England {{operational}} independence in monetary policy, and thus responsibility for setting interest rates through the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee. At {{the same time}} he also changed the inflation measure from the Retail Price <b>Index</b> <b>to</b> the Consumer Price Index and transferred responsibility for banking supervision to the Financial Services Authority. Some commentators have argued that this division of responsibilities exacerbated the severity in Britain of the 2007 global banking crisis.|$|E

5|$|In {{transparent}} materials, the {{refractive index}} generally {{is greater than}} 1, meaning that the phase velocity is less than c. In other materials, {{it is possible for}} the refractive <b>index</b> <b>to</b> become smaller than 1 for some frequencies; in some exotic materials it is even possible for the index of refraction to become negative. The requirement that causality is not violated implies that the real and imaginary parts of the dielectric constant of any material, corresponding respectively to the index of refraction and to the attenuation coefficient, are linked by the Kramers–Kronig relations. In practical terms, this means that in a material with refractive index less than 1, the absorption of the wave is so quick that no signal can be sent faster than c.|$|E
5|$|The film {{director}} is unknown, {{but it may}} have been Barry O'Neil or Lucius J. Henderson. Sometimes the directional credit is given to Theodore Marston. The apparent origin of this error is from the American Film-Index 1908–1915. Film historian Q. David Bowers consulted one of the co-authors of the book, Gunnar Lundquist, and confirmed that the credit of Marston was in error. Theodore Marston worked with Pathé, Kinemacolor, Vitagraph and other companies, but there is no record of Marston working with Thanhouser. This error has persisted in several works including The Complete <b>Index</b> <b>to</b> Literary Sources in Film. The same work also credits Alphonse Ethier with a role, but this is not cited by Bowers.|$|E

Payments are either <b>indexed</b> <b>to</b> the returns from deforestation (agriculture), or to a market value associated with forest nonuse benefits. Payment size depends {{on the degree of}} correlation between payments and agricultural returns, and their relative volatility.

5|$|The film's {{director}} is unknown, {{but it may}} have been Barry O'Neil or Lucius J. Henderson. Credit is sometimes given to Theodore Marston, an error that apparently originates with the American Film-Index 1908–1915. Film historian Q.

Marston worked with Pathé, Kinemacolor, Vitagraph and other companies, but there is no record of him working with Thanhouser.

Cameramen employed by the company at the time the film was made include Blair Smith, Carl Louis Gregory and Alfred H. Moses, Jr., but the role of the cameraman was uncredited in 1910 productions. This production is unique for having the cast members known, because most of the credits in Thanhouser's 1910 productions are fragmentary.|$|E

5|$|To {{allow the}} {{introduction}} of the database, the government required all local authorities to implement the Integrated Children's System, a framework to help improve outcomes for children. The government set a deadline of 1 January 2007, and 92 out of the 150 local authorities failed to achieve this. The government began a consultation on the 2007 draft regulations on 21 September 2006 which ended on 14 December 2006. In October 2006, the government selected Capgemini to design the database. On 15 February 2007, the database was renamed from Information Sharing <b>Index</b> <b>to</b> ContactPoint, following research with stakeholder groups, including children and families, who decided that the name ContactPoint made clear what the purpose of the database was: to improve communication between those working with children. A consultation on a guide for database users was launched on 4 May 2007 and ended on 27 July 2007.|$|E
