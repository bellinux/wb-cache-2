40|$|The seminal {{paper on}} the subject of {{corruption}} and trade is from Kruger (1974). She finds that quantitative trade restrictions shift resources from <b>directly</b> <b>productive</b> <b>activities</b> to rent seeking activities, such as corruption. This paper analyses the relationship between corruption and trade using corruption estimates and trade measures from multiple sources. The majority of empirical evidence supports a negative relationship between corruption and openness; however, this does not hold for all the data sets available. The estimated relationship seems to depend on the choice of the corruption index. Therefore, the data only provide weak support for the contention that trade restrictions increase corruption.

40|$|When {{sustained}} growth depends on establishing an indivisible infrastructure for <b>directly</b> <b>productive</b> <b>activities</b> (DPAs) both discrete and marginal departures from optimal growth can undermine the dynamic {{efficiency of the}} market. Producers ' anticipations of paying monopoly fees for infrastructure services dampen their incentive to invest in DPAs and may prevent the economy from reaching a minimal level of activity that would justify investment in a large indivisible infrastructure; and potential investors in infrastructure may be intimidated {{by the prospect of}} expropriatory regulation. Thus a credible prior commitment to effective but fair regulation is necessary for achieving optimal growth. But it may not be sufficient. Low-levelexpectations before the infrastructure is established can be self-fulfilling, indicating a role for coordinative industrial policy. Investment subsidies, even in conjunction with regulation, cannot induce an efficient equilibrium. 1...|$|E
40|$|The rate {{of growth}} in {{economic}} activities {{in the private sector}} and the level of economic development depends on the width and depth of market activities in an economy. Increased in market participation is dependent on a number of co-determinant factors working together. These factors include the level of monetization of economic activities with the resulting boost in the level of specialization (implying a fall in the level of subsistent activities); direct physical development of market; increased in the supply of infrastructure, especially those of transportation and communication; improvement the moral (social) capital of trust among the people in the society; promotion market-oriented policies by the government; among other things. If these factors are adequately available in the economy, jobs will be created through increased participation in income-generating activities, which naturally lead to market expansion, growth in <b>directly</b> <b>productive</b> <b>activities</b> of the private sector, and development. Even though market expansion will result in economic development, market activities must be regulated and given proper policy guide and direction for sustainable beneficial outcomes to be realized...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} three empirical papers that investigate social antecedents and health consequences of <b>productive</b> <b>activity.</b> The ideas of <b>productive</b> <b>activity</b> and <b>productive</b> aging are the main concepts guiding the dissertation. The project is innovative by (a) testing how components of capital influence <b>productive</b> <b>activities,</b> (b) replicating analyses of <b>productive</b> <b>activity</b> and chronic inflammation in a Korean sample, and (c) examining sleep as a potential mediator and moderator {{of the relationship between}} <b>productive</b> <b>activities</b> and chronic inflammation. Chapter 2 attempted to contribute to the knowledge on productive aging by testing components of human, social, and cultural capital and older adults 2 ̆ 7 participation in <b>productive</b> <b>activities.</b> In both cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses, education was related to all four types of <b>productive</b> <b>activity</b> (volunteering, meeting attendance, caregiving, and employment). Cultural capital was a consistent predictor of volunteering and meeting attendance. Chapter 3 then investigated whether multiple forms of <b>productive</b> <b>activity</b> affect health, focusing on chronic inflammation as a major physical health outcome in American and Korean older adults. The findings show gender-specific effects of employment and meeting attendance on inflammation in American older adults, but not in Korean older adults. Finally, Chapter 4 explicated the pathways linking <b>productive</b> <b>activity</b> and chronic inflammation {{in order to understand the}} underlying processes through which productive aging is beneficial to health. The results revealed that insufficient sleep moderates the link between volunteering and inflammation. The project offers a fuller understanding of the factors that promote or hinder older adults 2 ̆ 7 productive aging and how these activities influence chronic inflammation as a modifiable health outcome. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{the first}} paper, {{the effects of}} trade {{openness}} and conflict risk on income inequality are investigated. I obtain {{that the effect of}} trade openness on inequality depends on the level of conflict risk. More precisely, there exists a threshold effect: trade openness worsens income inequality in countries where the risk of internal and external conflicts is high. Moreover, I find that countries with higher risk of conflicts are more unequal, and that more ethnically diverse countries increase income inequality. Finally, I obtain that democratic regimes decrease inequality. In the second paper, we analyze the general-equilibrium consequences of property right enforcement in the natural resource sector. Assuming that exclusion requires both private and public enforcement efforts, we compare states that differ by their ability to provide protection services. This ability is referred to as state capacity. We obtain that public protection services can effectively act as either substitutes or complements to private enforcement, and this strongly depends on state capacity. Under low state capacity, an increase in state protection services leads to a drop in national income as labor is drawn away from the <b>directly</b> <b>productive</b> <b>activities.</b> The opposite holds for high-capacity states. As a result, public protection services have an ambiguous effect on national income even though they can unambiguously increase resource rents. In the third paper, we argue that the right to hold dual citizenship can generate important social and economic benefits beyond its political dimension. We assemble a large panel dataset on dual citizenship. We find that in developing countries, dual citizenship recognition increases remittance inflows by US$ 1. 19 billion, GDP and household consumption, and improves child survival. In developed countries, however, dual citizenship recognition decreases remittance inflows by US$ 1. 44 billion, but increases FDI by US$ 828 billion, raises household consumption, gross capital formation and trade, and provides incentives for skilled workers to move to other countries...|$|E

We proposed a unified methodological approach allowing to combine the complexity of assessment of both quantity of core resources of the <b>productive</b> <b>activity</b> and organizational resources, which significantly develops traditional systems of the <b>productive</b> <b>activity</b> management based on identifying quantitative parameters of the subsystems, their assessment, comparison and analysis.

40|$|We {{examine whether}} {{absorptive}} capacity represents a compulsory reason {{to reject the}} proposal of a large aid increase to support a big push. We argue that poverty trap is a probability for many countries, in particular the Least Developed Countries and that an aid increase is relevant for them. Moreover we show that the decrease in marginal aid returns is slower in vulnerable countries, what enhances the rationale to take vulnerability {{as one of the}} aid allocation criteria. We then examine the main limits to absorptive capacity, such as disbursement constraints and short term bottlenecks, macro economic troubles, including loss of competitiveness and macroeconomic volatility, as well as institution weakening. The general conclusion we draw to reconcile the two approaches is that absorptive capacity strongly depends on aid itself or on its very modalities. Big push and absorptive capacity approaches cannot be reconciled without an aid reform coming with an aid increase. First, needed is to balance the utilisation of aid between <b>directly</b> <b>productive</b> and social <b>activities,</b> in order to avoid transitory loss of competitiveness. Second, schemes helping to use aid as insurance against exogeneous shocks are to be enhanced because they lower the risk of Dutch disease and contribute to a faster and more equitable long term growth. Finally a performance-based conditionality should be substituted to the traditional policy-based one in order to cope with several absorptive capacity limitations, most importantly the socio-political one. An aid supported big push will not be effective without a new ownership of policy by the recipient countries. ...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the past}} decade {{there has been a}} growing {{interest}} in the potential benefits related to the productive use of rural piped water around the homestead. However, there is limited empirical research on the extent to which, and conditions under which, this activity occurs. Using data obtained from a comprehensive study of 47 rural piped water systems in Senegal, this paper reveals the extent of piped-water-based <b>productive</b> <b>activity</b> occurring and identifies important system-level variables associated with this activity. Three-quarters (74 %) of the households surveyed depend on water for their livelihoods with around one-half (54 %) relying on piped water. High levels of piped-water-based <b>productive</b> <b>activity</b> were found to be associated with shorter distances from a community to a city or paved road (i. e. markets), more capable water system operators and water committees, and communities that contributed to the construction of the piped water system. Further, access to electricity was associated with higher productive incomes from water-based <b>productive</b> <b>activities,</b> highlighting the role that non-water-related inputs have on the extent of <b>productive</b> <b>activities</b> undertaken. Finally, an analysis of the technical performance of piped water systems found no statistically significant association between high vs. low levels of <b>productive</b> <b>activity</b> and system performance; however, a positive relationship was found between system performance and the percentage of households engaged in <b>productive</b> <b>activities...</b>|$|R
40|$|Thematic area: Unpaid carersOBJECTIVE: This {{present study}} aimed {{to compare the}} {{patterns}} and levels of engagement in <b>productive</b> <b>activities</b> between older adults with different levels of socioeconomic status. DATA: Participants’ socioeconomic status was inferred by their housing (pubic rental or private) and personal income. <b>Productive</b> <b>activities</b> were measured by the types and total number of hours engaged in employment, volunteering, and caregiving activities in the past month. METHODS: This study used a cross-sectional design with quota sampling to ensure adequate number {{of participants in the}} age groups of 60 - 69 years, 70 - 79 years, and 80 years and older. 310 participants were recruited from various community elderly centres and participated in face-to-face interviews RESULTS: Participants living in public housing engaged in an average of 47. 8 hours of <b>productive</b> <b>activities</b> in the past month, in contrast with 70. 6 hours of <b>productive</b> <b>activities</b> performed by participants living in private housing. Participants with higher income were more actively engaged in all types of <b>productive</b> <b>activities.</b> The effect of income on work and volunteering activities remained significant after adjusting for age, gender, education level, marital status, and health condition. POLICY IMPLICATIONS: Older adults with higher socioeconomic status were more actively involved in <b>productive</b> <b>activities,</b> especially in work and volunteering.

Utilizing data from the 2004 survey "Living Profile and Welfare Service Needs of Older Persons in Korea," this study predicted the <b>productive</b> <b>activities</b> of the rural elderly. All of the ten predicting variables selected from the survey and literature review (age, gender, education, activity limitation, personal income, health, organization, family status, socio-economic status, and job) were found to have significant partial effects on such <b>productive</b> <b>activities</b> as paid work, care-giving and volunteer work. The following are major conclusions: The rural elderly women had more care-giving, whereas men had more volunteer work. Participation in religious or social organizations was a good predictor for participation in a volunteer work. Single-family status was a negative factor for care-giving. Being a farmer or not could explain the paid working time most effectively. The rural elderly with a relatively high socio-economic status have more inclination to participate in a volunteer work. Aging reduces the possibility of sharing the experiences of paid work or care-giving. Activity limitation had a negative partial effect on care-giving. Good health was the only valuable predictor for all kinds of <b>productive</b> <b>activities.</b> Personal income was positively related with paid work and care-giving.
