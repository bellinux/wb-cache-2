He was adamant {{that she was not}} to <b>know</b> <b>she</b> was being sent to France to be examined as a prospective bride for Charles, and refused permission for her to be examined in the nude, customary at the time. According to the contemporary chronicler Jean Froissart, Isabeau was 13 or 14 when the match was proposed and about 16 {{at the time of the}} marriage in 1385, suggesting a birth date of around 1370.|$|E

Sayid is suspended upside down, held by a rope, and recites the Shahadah. A mysterious French woman (Mira Furlan) cuts him down and ties him to a bed in a bunker. She asks where Alex is, but when Sayid says he does not <b>know,</b> <b>she</b> uses batteries and a cable to shock him. Sayid tells his torturer about the plane crash and the French transmission the survivors heard when they first crashed on the island.

5|$|Mercedes (Amber Riley) {{is elected}} {{president}} of the Troubletones, and tells Santana that she should play fair against New Directions from now on. Santana makes a rare apology to Finn in the school hallway, but her so-called apology consists of a series of insults. As she walks away, Finn retaliates by telling her {{to come out of the}} closet, and calls her a coward for constantly tearing others down while not accepting herself and her relationship with Brittany. A couple of days later, Santana is told by Sue and Burt that the niece of one of their opponents in the election overheard the conversation between her and Finn, and said opponent is about to release an attack ad that criticizes Sue for choosing a lesbian as head cheerleader. Santana runs out of the office in tears, saying that her parents do not yet <b>know</b> <b>she</b> is gay. The episode concludes with the Troubletones' mash-up of Adele songs.

25|$|Nels Rasmussen told Nuttall about Lazarus' {{continued}} {{contact with}} his daughter, which {{had not been in}} the files, despite him mentioning it frequently during Mayer and Hook's interviews. Realizing that Lazarus was now their prime suspect, the detectives informed their superiors of this and arranged to discreetly collect a voluntarily discarded DNA sample from her, knowing they would have to do so without getting a warrant, which would have let Lazarus <b>know</b> <b>she</b> was under investigation for the murder. While off-duty running errands, Lazarus discarded a cup from which she had been drinking, which police retrieved. A sample was taken from it, and it matched the DNA from the bite mark on Sherri Rasmussen.|$|E

25|$|On 29 March 2004 Rau {{arrived at}} the Hann River Roadhouse in North Queensland. She was hitchhiking and {{travelling}} alone. Since it was the wet season, {{and she did not}} have a consistent plan for travel, the locals were concerned for her safety. On 30 March, locals took her from the Roadhouse to the nearby town of Coen, on the Cape York Peninsula. She was taken to the Exchange Hotel in Coen, where locals called the Queensland Police. There Rau gave several versions of her story, identifying herself as Anna Brotmeyer and Anna Schmidt, and spoke both English and German. She said that she was a tourist from Munich, Germany, and that she was planning to continue north as far as Weipa. However, she could not provide any documentation and said there was no-one else in Australia who would <b>know</b> <b>she</b> was missing.|$|E

25|$|The next {{entry in}} the series is {{considered}} curious: The Gorilla Mystery (October 1, 1930). The short starts with Beppo the Gorilla escaping from a zoo. Mickey learns of it and panics. He phones Minnie to warn her about the dangerous gorilla wandering about. Minnie is unconcerned and plays tunes on her piano for Mickey to hear over the phone and <b>know</b> <b>she</b> is not afraid. Her tunes are interrupted by her scream and Mickey rushes to her house to save her. Meanwhile, Beppo has wrapped up Minnie in rope and holds her hostage. Mickey confronts the gorilla and once again rescues the damsel in distress. The short ends with Minnie and Mickey jointly wrapping up the gorilla in rope. Modern audiences have commented on elements of bondage apparent in the short and the mysterious motivation of Beppo. Note that the theme of kidnapping by a gorilla is present here three {{years prior to the}} King Kong film of 1933.|$|E
25|$|The present Mrs Bland is {{the second}} Mrs Bland. Mr Bland said his wife was the sole living {{relative}} for her family inheritance but she cannot both be sole heir and have a sister. Mr Bland's first wife died in the Second World War; he remarried soon after, to another Canadian woman. The family of his first wife had cut off communication with their daughter so thoroughly they did not <b>know</b> <b>she</b> had died. Sixteen years later, the first wife was announced to be the heiress to an overseas fortune as the last-known living relative. When this news reached the Blands, they decided the second Mrs Bland must pose as the first Mrs Bland. They fool a British firm of solicitors that sought the heir. When Quentin Duguesclin, who knew the first wife and her family, looked her up in England, a plan was laid to murder him. The plan was simple, with additions like the clocks taken from an unpublished mystery story that Miss Martindale had read in manuscript.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, {{determined}} to confront her fear, Psylocke began rigorous training to prepare herself {{for their next}} encounter. She returned to Earth-616 to let Brian <b>know</b> <b>she</b> was alive. Almost immediately both the Exiles and Excalibur were called {{to the defense of}} Otherworld, under attack by an army of Furies created by a resurrected Mad Jim Jaspers; though the heroes prevailed, the Exiles were left as the Omniverse's primary defenders until the devastated Captain Britain Corps could be rebuilt. Choosing to remain with the Exiles, Betsy traveled to several realities. Upon arriving on a certain Earth, Psylocke had a mental breakdown due to this world's Psylocke counterpart's psyche being at war with Betsy's own psyche in order to control her body. This reality's Ogun approached Psylocke and offered to train her so she could avenge the death of his apprentice, who was killed by Slaymaster. Psylocke eventually tracked him to Earth-616 and killed him. Betsy returned to the Crystal Palace, became involved with teammate Sabretooth, and promised to honor her mission as an Exile.|$|E
5000|$|In 1923, {{when he was}} 4, {{his parents}} {{separated}} and later divorced. He and his surviving sister, Mary, were raised by their mother first in Springfield, Massachusetts and later in Cambridge, Massachusetts. His mother was a firm influence but never overbearing. One of Brewster's friends characterized her as [...] "one of those people whose presence you always felt {{when she was in}} the room".

25|$|The series {{begins by}} {{introducing}} unconventional newcomer Franky, to whom secretly insecure popular girl Mini takes a dislike; Mini ingratiates Franky into her group only to disown her.

500|$|In his memoir, he {{describes}} how one {{was an old}} friend who was keen to have children but feared she {{was running out of}} time. [...] "We had never been involved romantically but I knew her well enough to <b>know</b> <b>she</b> would be a wonderful mother and so I said I would like to be the father of her children." [...] A daughter was born in 1990, and another in 1992. Then another friend said she'd like to have children: [...] "And we agreed to have a baby."

500|$|Libby is {{a mysterious}} {{character}}, {{seated at the}} tail-section of the plane. Her character was written {{to be in her}} late forties to early fifties, easy on the eyes, amicably maladjusted, and a compulsive liar so good at what she does, most people will not <b>know</b> <b>she</b> is not what she seems. Damon Lindelof was quoted in Variety as saying the character [...] "is going to bring a flavor to the show that doesn't exist right now. She's not as intense as some of the other characters. She's that person you want in the trenches with you who can take lemons and make lemonade." ...|$|E
500|$|Critic Robert Christgau also {{considered}} [...] "Overprotected" [...] and [...] "Cinderella" [...] as {{the highlights of}} Britney, while saying, [...] "hardly the first not-terribly-bright teenager to approach self-knowledge via the words of others". Nikki Tranker of PopMatters said the song [...] "is an absolute belter reminiscent of Britney’s previous big-bang singles, 'Oops! I Did It Again' and 'You Drive Me Crazy' [...] ", while commenting that Spears [...] "sings about ridding herself of the girlie chains around her, gripes about her need for space in the whirlwind that is her life, and lets us <b>know</b> <b>she</b> don’t need nobody telling her what to do." [...] In 2003, the song received a Grammy nomination for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance.|$|E
500|$|In 1996, Madonna {{starred in}} the film Evita, {{playing the role of}} Eva Perón, the Spiritual Leader of the Nation of Argentina. For a long time, Madonna had desired to play Perón and even wrote a letter to {{director}} Alan Parker, explaining how she would be perfect for the part. After securing the role, she underwent vocal training with coach Joan Lader since Evita required the actors to sing their own parts. Lader noted that the singer [...] "had to use her voice in a way she's never used it before. Evita is real musical theater — its operatic, in a sense. Madonna developed an upper register that she didn't <b>know</b> <b>she</b> had." ...|$|E
