50|$|Thermal {{fracturing}} {{in glass}} occurs when sufficient temperature differential is created within glass.As a warmed area expands or a cooled area contracts, stress forces develop potentially leading to fracture. A temperature differential may {{be created in}} many ways including solar <b>heating,</b> <b>space</b> heating devices, fire, hot and cold liquids.

In framed window glass the edges are relatively cooler than the exposed areas so space heating devices in very close proximity may cause thermal fracture.|$|E

Simplified analytical relations have also been proposed to the same aim, allowing the extraction of more general results, with limited accuracy however, as imposed by mathematical simplicity requirements. In this sense, a variety of important parameters are ignored, such as: the existence of any glazing at the wall, the absorptance of the wall, the base temperature of the <b>heated</b> <b>space</b> which the referred to wall belongs to and its variation with insulation, the thermal characteristics (thermal capacitance, total heat losses coefficient) and the heat and solar gains of the <b>heated</b> <b>space.</b> An alternative analytical approach is consequently developed here, incorporating all above parameters and in this context accessing the wall as part of the whole <b>heated</b> <b>space,</b> instead of considering it solely as an isolated fabric element. The approach consists of a set of two implicit equations which are easily solved, and enables the investigation of the effects of all principal and secondary parameters on the optimum thickness.

50|$|Heat from Earth's {{interior}} {{can be used}} as {{an energy}} source, known as geothermal energy. The geothermal gradient has been used for space heating and bathing since ancient Roman times, and more recently for generating electricity. As the human population continues to grow, so does energy use and the correlating environmental impacts that are consistent with global primary sources of energy. This has caused a growing interest in finding sources of energy that are renewable and have reduced greenhouse gas emissions. In areas of high geothermal energy density, current technology allows for the generation of electrical power because of the corresponding high temperatures. Generating electrical power from geothermal resources requires no fuel while providing true baseload energy at a reliability rate that constantly exceeds 90%. In order to extract geothermal energy, it is necessary to efficiently transfer heat from a geothermal reservoir to a power plant, where electrical energy is converted from heat. On a worldwide scale, the heat stored in Earth's interior provides an energy that is still seen as an exotic source. About 10 GW of geothermal electric capacity is installed around the world as of 2007, generating 0.3% of global electricity demand. An additional 28 GW of direct geothermal heating capacity is installed for district <b>heating,</b> <b>space</b> heating, spas, industrial processes, desalination and agricultural applications. Because heat is flowing through every square meter of land, it can be used for a source of energy for heating, air conditioning (HVAC) and ventilating systems using ground source heat pumps. In areas where modest heat flow is present, geothermal energy can be used for industrial applications that presently rely on fossil fuels.|$|E

40|$|Traditionally, a ``low-energy`` {{house has}} been one that used little energy for <b>space</b> <b>heating.</b> But <b>space</b> <b>heating</b> {{typically}} accounts for {{less than half of}} the energy used by new US homes, and for low <b>heating</b> energy homes, <b>space</b> <b>heating</b> is often the third largest end use, behind water heating and appliances, and sometimes behind cooling. Low <b>space</b> <b>heat</b> alone cannot identify a low-energy house. To better understand the determinants of a low-energy house, we collected data on housing characteristics, incremental costs, and energy measurements from energy-efficient houses around the world and in a range of climates. We compare the energy required to provide thermal comfort as well as water heating, and other appliances. We do not have a single definition of a low-energy house, but through comparisons of actual buildings, we show how different definitions and quantitative indicators fail.

40|$|Problem statement: Chinas energy {{consumption}} is increasing with a high-speed in recent years. Especially since building {{energy consumption}} caught pubic eyes {{and became a}} crucial problem of society, it forced the public to make estimation {{in order to reduce}} energy consumption efficiently. However, {{it is very difficult to}} analyze a non-residential building accurately due to Chinas statistical collection system and the lack of national surveys. Approach: This study introduced a methodology of estimating various energy consumption factors by building types, energy end-use (electric power, space <b>heating,</b> <b>space</b> cooling and hot water) in each province. The unit energy consumption factors were determined based on sample cities data and modification by using software analysis. Take 2006 year for example, the estimation method was introduced. Results: The non-residential building energy consumption in China in 2006 year was estimated by the method above mentioned. Through the result of analysis, we found out that energy consumption of space <b>heating,</b> <b>space</b> cooling and hot water were greatly affected by space Heating Degree Day (HDD), space Cooling Degree Day (CDD) and regional consumer spending per person (Op-c). Conclusion: A series of formulas were obtained. So by using the formulas we can not only estimate the energy consumption now, but also the energy consumption in future. &# 12288;However, this is the first step of our research. It might be hoped that the further surveys and research on energy consumption of China can be done to promote our research result...|$|E
