5|$|Since U.S. {{beekeeper}} Nephi Miller {{first began}} moving his hives to {{different areas of}} the country for the winter of 1908, migratory beekeeping has become widespread in America. Bee rental for pollination is a crucial element of U.S. agriculture, which could not produce anywhere near its current levels with native pollinators alone. U.S. beekeepers collectively earn much more from renting their bees out for pollination than they do from <b>honey</b> <b>production.</b>|$|E
5|$|Contract {{pollination}} has overtaken {{the role}} of <b>honey</b> <b>production</b> for beekeepers in many countries. From 1972 to 2006, feral honey bees declined dramatically in the US, and they are now almost absent. The number of colonies kept by beekeepers declined slightly, through urbanization, systematic pesticide use, tracheal and Varroa mites, and the closure of beekeeping businesses. In 2006 and 2007 the rate of attrition increased, and was described as colony collapse disorder. In 2010 invertebrate iridescent virus and the fungus Nosema ceranae were shown to be in every killed colony, and deadly in combination. Winter losses increased to about 1/3. Varroa mites {{were thought to be}} responsible for about half the losses.|$|E
5|$|In {{the time}} that Gates was there, {{research}} focused mainly on <b>honey</b> <b>production,</b> brood diseases, wax extraction and horticultural pollination in the cucumber and cranberry industries. From 1913 to 1920 the laboratory was also operated by a superintendent, John L. Byard, hired on by Gates to maintain the facilities {{from day to day}} as well as perform wax extractions and other services to beekeepers from around the state. Following Gates' resignation in 1918, the school ceased to offer its summer beekeeping school, many of its state extension services, and the college went through several different professors before hiring Frank R. Shaw as the new professor of beekeeping in 1931. With Shaw's retirement in 1969, the laboratory was rededicated to urban and medical entomology research, with the former beekeeping program falling into relative obscurity.|$|E

25|$|Instead {{of taking}} nectar, bees can take honeydew, the sweet {{secretions}} of aphids or other plant sap-sucking insects. Honeydew honey is very dark brown in color, {{with a rich}} fragrance of stewed fruit or fig jam, and is not as sweet as nectar honeys. Germany's Black Forest is a well known source of honeydew-based honeys, {{as well as some}} regions in Bulgaria, Tara (mountain) in Serbia, and Northern California in the United States. In Greece, pine honey (a type of honeydew honey) constitutes 60–65% of the annual <b>honey</b> <b>production.</b> Honeydew honey is popular in some areas, but in other areas, beekeepers have difficulty selling the stronger-flavored product.|$|E
25|$|Nonetheless, {{the oldest}} archaeological find {{relating}} to beekeeping discovered {{to date is}} an apiary dating from about 900 BC at Rehov, a Bronze- and Iron Age site in the Jordan Valley. The hives, made of straw and unbaked clay, could have housed {{more than a million}} bees, and indicate that honey was produced on a large scale. It is most likely that the inhabitants of Tel Rehov imported the bees from Anatolia because they were less aggressive than the local bees and produced a higher yield of honey. It is also possible that the domestication of bees for <b>honey</b> <b>production</b> was introduced from Egypt during the Iron Age and honey was being obtained from domesticated bees from late in the Iron Age period.|$|E

25|$|The {{arrival of}} the Africanized honey bee in Central America is {{threatening}} the ancient art of keeping Melipona stingless bees in log gums {{even though they do}} not interbreed or directly compete with each other. The <b>honey</b> <b>production</b> from a single hive of Africanized bees can be 100kg annually and far exceeds the much smaller 3–5kg of the various Melipona stingless species. Thus economic pressures are forcing beekeepers to switch from the traditional bees of their ancestors to the new reality of the Africanized honey bee. Whether this will lead to their extinction is unknown, but they are well adapted to exist in the wild, {{and there are a number}} of indigenous plants that the Africanized honey bees do not visit, so their fate remains to be seen.|$|E
25|$|The {{number of}} managed colonies in the United States for <b>honey</b> <b>production</b> {{has been in}} decline since the 1940s. Annual declines and colony losses are normal however the rate of {{honeybee}} deaths {{as well as the}} inability to find a determinate cause of the deaths has caused some alarm. In 2006, some beekeepers reported losing 30-90% of their hives. Total colony loss reached 45% between 2012 and 2013, up from 28.9% and 36.4% in previous years. While annual losses above 30% are not out of the ordinary, the symptoms of these colony losses do not all match with those normally produced by known pests and pathogens. The amount of loss experienced as well as uncertainty around the cause of the loss lead to the coining of the term Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD) by the apiculture community.|$|E
25|$|In {{areas of}} {{suitable}} temperate climate, the survival traits of Africanized colonies help them outperform European honey bee colonies. They also return later and basically work under conditions that often keep European bees hive-bound. This {{is the reason}} why they have gained a well-deserved reputation as superior honey producers, and those beekeepers who have learned to adapt their management techniques now seem to prefer them to their European counterparts. Studies show that in areas of Florida that contain Africanized honey bees, the <b>honey</b> <b>production</b> is higher than in areas in which they do not live. It is also becoming apparent that Africanized bees have another advantage over European bees in that they seem to show a higher resistance to several health issues including parasites such as Varroa destructor, some fungal diseases like chalkbrood and even the mysterious colony-collapse disorder which is currently plaguing beekeepers. So despite all its negative factors, {{it is possible that the}} Africanized honey bee might actually end up being a boon to apiculture.|$|E
