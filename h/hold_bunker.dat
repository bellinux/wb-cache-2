2500|$|In 1986, Dye also {{designed}} {{a course in}} the Italian province of Brescia, near Lake Iseo, the Franciacorta Golf Club, recognized today as wine golf course. Dye {{is considered to be}} one of the most influential course architects in the world. His designs are known for distinctive features, including small greens and the use of railroad ties to <b>hold</b> <b>bunkers.</b> His design for the Brickyard Crossing golf course at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway utilized the dismantled outer retaining wall from the race track. He is known for designing the [...] "world's most terrifying tee shot," [...] the par-3 17th hole of the Stadium Course at TPC at Sawgrass in Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida. Known as the [...] "Island Green," [...] it gained wide notice [...] in 1982, during the first Players Championship at the new course. Dye's designs have been credited with returning short & medium length par fours to golf. Many of the best young golf architects have [...] "pushed dirt" [...] for Pete, including Bill Coore, Tom Doak, John Harbottle, Butch Laporte, Tim Liddy, Scott Poole, David Postlewaite, Lee Schmidt, Keith Sparkman, Jim Urbina, Bobby Weed, Rod Whitman, and Abe Wilson.|$|R

50|$|While {{these forms}} of bomb shelters are equally {{amenable}} to civilian and military use, a bunker is more commonly associated with military use.

At the plant, an automated unloading trestle empties the train in about 30 minutes and conveyor belts move the coal to the storage pile or the storage bunkers inside the plant. The <b>bunkers</b> <b>hold</b> a 14-hour reserve; the coal pile target inventory is a 32-day supply.|$|R

After leaving Boyne City the vessel was sailing in heavy weather, and the hull began to leak more than usual. Water soon overwhelmed the pumps, quickly rising more than 8 ft above the keel. The water also flooded the <b>hold</b> and coal <b>bunkers,</b> forcing the firemen to use kerosene instead of coal to maintain the steam pressure.|$|R

5000|$|On the 14th November, 1919, at Novorossisk, South Russia, an {{ammunition}} dump exploded, {{setting fire to}} the SS War Pike, {{which was}} carrying a cargo of munitions, including shells. Colonel Cotton, as explosions were taking place both on the quay and on board the ship, cleared the bystanders from the neighbourhood, and assisted in castings off the hawsers from the vessel. He then organised a small party to follow the steamer in a tug, when it was towed out to sea, in order to render all possible assistance, and, although the vessel was burning fiercely, the <b>hold</b> and <b>bunkers</b> being well alight, he boarded her and endeavoured to get the fire under control. It {{was not until the}} fore part of the ship began to settle down that he and his party left the vessel. Colonel Cotton's prompt action, which was attended by great personal risk, in all probability saved many lives.|$|R
5000|$|Fort Banks was the WWII {{location}} for an anti-aircraft defense command post, a meteorological station, and a <b>bunker</b> <b>holding</b> the [...] "secure" [...] central switchboard for the Harbor Command (see photo in gallery, below).

It also had a 250-bed hospital. After the fort was declared surplus by the Army in 1947, its land was purchased by the Town of Winthrop and by private developers for municipal facilities and apartment uses.|$|R
5000|$|Montanan {{was in the}} Arabian Sea on June 3, 1943 sailing as a {{civilian}} transport vessel.

Survivors either jumped overboard or boarded her four lifeboats. Survivors in Life Boat No. 2 sailed for two days before rescue by the dhow Naranpasha. They were transferred to the armed trawler HMIS Baroda and arrived at Port Okha, on June 11, 1943. Survivors in the other boats reached Masirah Island.|$|R
5000|$|On May 10, 2013, Thapar {{cited the}} {{definition}} of the federal crime of terrorism to keep the protesters in jail until their sentencing on February 18, 2014. [...] Thapar sentenced one of the defendants, 84-year-old nun Megan Rice, to 35 months in prison for breaking into the U.S. nuclear weapons complex and using blood to deface a <b>bunker</b> <b>holding</b> bomb-grade uranium, a demonstration that exposed serious security flaws; Rice had asked not to receive leniency and said she would be honored to receive a life sentence. The two other defendants were sentenced to more than five years in prison, in part because they had much longer criminal histories. The activists' attorneys asked the judge to sentence them to time they had already served, about nine months, because of their record of goodwill. Thapar said he was concerned they showed no remorse and he wanted the punishment to be a deterrent for other activists.|$|R

[...] General Beqir Balluku, the Defence Minister {{and a member of}} the Politburo, publicly criticised the bunker system in a 1974 speech and disputed Hoxha's line that Albania was under equal threat from the United States and the Soviet Union. He argued that Albania needed a modern, well-equipped professional army rather than a poorly trained and equipped civilian militia. Hoxha responded by having Ballaku arrested, accusing him of being an agent of the Chinese and of working to bring about a military coup. Dubbed [...] "the arch-traitor Ballaku", the general and his associates were convicted and punished according to [...] "the laws of the dictatorship of the proletariat" [...] – meaning that they were executed.|$|R
5000|$|He first {{appeared}} in The Word Lord, a one part story in the four part Forty-five audio drama collection. He chased the Doctor through several times and places, always missing him. In 1945, Nobody regenerated, for unspecified reasons. While he recovered, he hid at an alien research facility called The Forge, disguising his ship as their catch phrase, [...] "For King and Country". A hundred years later, he finally made contact with the Doctor in the Antarctic. With his ship now hidden as a joke, he infiltrated a top secret <b>bunker</b> <b>holding</b> an important peace summit. It is unclear if this is their first meeting, although the Doctor has knowledge of Word Lords and their abilities. Luckily for him, the bunker had a security black-out, no phones, books or even writing material. The Doctor was able to shut off the translation circuits to his TARDIS, forcing Nobody to flee into the only book available, a protocol guide for the bunker. He escaped, after soldiers carelessly said [...] "Nobody move", leading to several unchronicled run-ins with the Seventh Doctor, throughout their long lives.|$|R

50|$|On November 11, around 2:00 a.m., the LTTE {{launched}} a massive attack from {{land and the}} lagoon, simultaneously engaging the Nagathevanthurai naval base and the army defense lines in Pooneryn. The SLA troops were taken by surprise because they didn't expect the Tigers to come over the lagoon. It is now believed that, prior to the attack, the LTTE had managed to infiltrate a commando group through the Forward Defense Lines, with the mission of overrunning the gun armor positions. Heavy anti-aircraft fire {{was used by the}} Tigers to prevent any air support for the SLAF, one air craft was damaged due to anti air craft fire but the pilot managed to land the air craft at Palali Air base. Sri Lankan soldiers were so surprised by the attack that no organized resistance really existed. Most of the troops fighting back formed independent groups that broke down into even smaller groups as the battle progressed and {{in the end it was}} every man for himself. The SLA soldiers were fighting for their very lives. However, there were instances of bravery on the SLA side. One example is 2nd Lt. K.W.T. Nissanka, a platoon commander. He sacrificed his life to enable his troops to withdraw with their wounded. As his soldiers were withdrawing from their bunkers he removed the pins on two grenades and ran towards the enemy; the grenades exploded, killing him and the attacking Tigers instantly. By dawn the next day large parts of the base were overrun,the armory and the Battle tanks were taken by the Tigers, although some army units still managed to <b>hold</b> out in <b>bunkers</b> along the shore. The Army units lost contact with Northern Province GHQ but finally managed to contact the Army garrison at Elephant Pass. On 14 November remaining Army units at Pooneryn received reinforcements from near by Army bases, at Mandathivu and regained the lost territory. The Army Commander Cecil Waidyaratne and the Northern area commander Rohan Daluwatte visited the base on 15 November 1993.|$|R
5000|$|The {{story begins}} in druglord Pedro Pablo's (El Capo) hidden {{underground}} bunker that is built under a swamp. Where he, his wife Isabel Cristina, his lover Marcela, {{and four of}} his men - his brother Nancho, Chemo, Perrys and Tato, are hiding to escape the army. Inside the bunker a cellphone is brought in by Isabel Cristina, who was unconscious at the time. The phone receives a call, and is intercepted by a spy plane which gives the order to keep operating. Outside the <b>bunker,</b> <b>holding</b> together a large military squad, camouflaged among the military, is fiscal Grisales, who is actually an infiltrator from El Capo. In the bunker El Capo monitors the outside thanks to a closed system of chambers and the prosecutor's reports. There are also a series of flashbacks which talk about how Pedro Pablo became rich, and how he met Marcela. Outside the bunker, the military discover something very rare in the lake and decide to scare out the animals living in the place using live ammunition. This causes animal rights groups and journalists {{to come on the}} scene, including the camouflaged son of El Capo, Juan Carlos. Marcela gets out of the bunker and meets with Juan Carlos and returns to the bunker with him. Two bombs are dropped in the lake above the bunker, causing leaks and damages. Finally, El Capo and his accomplices get out of the bunker and move to a farm, leaving the injured Tato behind. The army captures Tato while Isabel and Juan Carlos return to the city where they meet with Julieta. Julieta and Juan Carlos reveal to their spouses the true identity of their father, while Pedro tells his story to Marcela. Nancho persuades a terminally ill AIDS man, named [...] "El Moro", to drive a car bomb to the Senate in exchange for 200 million pesos for his family. Nancho, unable to tell Juan Carlos about the bomb, inadvertently causes Juan to die in the explosion. Meanwhile, Marcela confesses her true intentions and reminded El Capo that in the past, Pedro Pablo had killed a journalist called Manchola, who was Marcela's fiance. Before his death, Manchola had revealed the true identity of El Capo as Pedro Pablo Leon Jaramillo. Isabel Cristina heard about the death of Juan Carlos from Julieta, while Perrys and Chemo rescued El Moro's children from their deaths and promise to take care of them. Pedro Pablo orders Nancho to take the body of Juan Carlos from the morgue. Meanwhile, Perrys and Chemo, in company of a nurse, attempt to get Tato from the hospital before the government can take him to jail.|$|R
5000|$|Phil {{is called}} to the {{telephone}} at this moment; Pat's voice sounds in his ear.'Phil, at the present rate of casualties we can't hold on unless we get the Castle Site back. Their machine-guns up there completely dominate your platoon and most of Terry's. We shall never stop their advance until we hold that ground again.'Phil looks {{over the edge of}} the trench at the Castle Site, two hundred yards away, as Pat continues talking, giving him the instructions for the counter attack. They talk for a minute or so; there is not much more to be said when an instruction is given to assault with a handful of tired men across open ground. Everyone knows it is vital: everyone knows it is appallingly dangerous. The only details to be fixed are the arrangements for supporting fire; and, though A Company's Gunners sic are dead, Ronnie wil support them from D Company's hill. Behind, the machine-gunners will ensure that they are not engaged from the open eastern flank. Phil gathers his tiny assault party together. It is time, they rise from the ground and move forward to the barbed wire that once protected the rear of John's platoon. Already two men are hit and Papworth, the Medical Corporal, is attending to them. They are through the wire safely - safely! - when the machine-gun in the bunker begins to fire. Phil is badly wounded: he drops to the ground. They drag him back through the wire somehow and seek what little cover there is as it creeps across their front. The machine-gun stops, content now it has driven them back; waiting for a better target when they move into the open again. 'It's all right, sir,' says someone to Phil. 'The Medical Corporal's been sent for. He'll be here any minute." [...] Phil raises himself from the ground, rests on a friendly shoulder, then climbs by a great effort on to one knee. 'We must take the Castle Site,' he says; and gets up to take it.The others beg him to wait until his wounds are tended. One man places a hand on his side.'Just wait until Papworth has seen you, sir-'But Phil has gone: gone to the wire, gone through the wire, gone towards the bunker. The other come out behind him, their eyes all on him. And suddenly it seems as if, for a few breathless moments, the whole of the remainder of that field of battle is still and silent, watching amazed, the lone figure that runs so painfully forward to the <b>bunker</b> <b>holding</b> the approach to the Castle Site: one tiny figure, throwing grenades, firing a pistol, set to take Castle Hill. Perhaps he will make it - in spite of his wounds, in spite of the odds - perhaps this act of supreme gallantry may, by its sheer audacity, succeed. But the machine-gun in the bunker fires into him: he staggers, falls, and is dead instantly; the grenade he threw a second before his death explodes after it in the mouth of the bunker. The machine-gun does not fire on three of Phil's platoon who run forward to pick him up; it does not fire again through the battle: it is destroyed; the muzzle blown away, the crew dead.|$|R
