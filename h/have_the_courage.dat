5|$|At Shimer, the {{professor}} is a facilitator, a guide on the side, not a sage {{on the stage}} – encouraging each student {{to contribute to the}} intellectual light being kindled in every class. Each student is expected to question and comment upon the text, to respond to one other’s insights, actively taking part in every discussion.... Students know their insights matter; they have something to offer to their peers, and {{to the life of the}} text being discussed. Some students are more exuberant than others, some would rather talk than listen; others may be a bit shy. The professor/facilitator must make sure that each student has a chance to shine, that each can feel confident, each can <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>courage</b> to ask what they think might be a stupid question. What are feared to be stupid questions are often the most provocative ones.|$|E

Santosh slowly befriends Hasini and both fall in love, {{but he does not}} <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>courage</b> to inform about his love to his father. Santosh gets spotted along with Hasini by Subramaniam and now he reveals his love affair. Subramaniam is furious upon hearing this as Santosh is already engaged to Rajeshwari. Subramaniam asks Santosh to bring Hasini to his home and make her stay with them for a week so that he will make Santosh understand that Rajeshwari is the better bride for him. Santosh agrees, believing that Hasini will impress Subramaniam. Hasini lies to her father Govindan that she is going for a college trip and leaves for Santosh’s home.|$|E

Mayu has feelings for Takashi but doesn't <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>courage</b> to confess to him, instead she tends to revert to cooking. Because of her close history with Takashi and her relatively large bust size, she is perceived by Yamada as a rival, although Takeshita considers her totally sexually innocent and a virgin.

25|$|But {{cooperation}} {{within the}} Committee of Public Prosperity, since April 1793 {{the de facto}} executive government, started to break down. On 29 June 1794, three colleagues of Robespierre at 'the Committee' called him a dictator in his face – Robespierre baffled left the meeting. This encouraged other Convention members to also defy Robespierre. On 26 July, a long and vague speech of Robespierre wasn't met with thunderous applause as usual but with hostility; some deputies yelled that Robespierre should <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>courage</b> to say which deputies he deemed necessary to be killed next, what Robespierre refused to do.|$|E
25|$|In the {{immediate}} post-war period, Aaron {{served as a}} conciliator with the United States Conciliation Service and helped settle a number of labor disputes—particularly in California's aircraft industry during the post-war wave of strikes. President Harry S. Truman appointed {{him to be a}} public member of the Wage Stabilization Board on July 5, 1951. He was a strong critic of the Board's case-by-case method of awarding pay increases. During the 1952 steel strike, he played a role as a go-between for the United Steelworkers of America and the Board. President Truman appointed him vice chairman of the Board on May 29, 1952. Aaron was deeply critical of congressional efforts to cut the Board's budget, and declared that Congress should either fully fund the Board's activities or <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>courage</b> to legislate the Board out of existence.|$|E
25|$|During the {{celebrations}} a message is received that Hassan Khan's army {{has suffered a}} decisive defeat {{at the hands of}} Koroghlu's followers and it has been routed. There is a commotion among the guests. The feast turns to a council of war. Everybody offers its own plan for suppression of the rebels. Khan's jester Hamza's curious offer is the most acceptable: it is to steal Koroghlu's favorite black horse the Ghirr Aat. This will trick Koroghlu to come to free his loyal friend, allowing Khan's men to capture him, depriving the rebellion of its leader. But who will <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>courage</b> to steal the horse from the rebels' tower (Chenlibel)? Bald-headed Hamza is chosen to steal the horse. The risk is that Nigar, Koroghlu's beloved who is in Khan's captivity will know of the plot. But it is a risk to be taken. Hasan khan agrees.|$|E

25|$|The 20th-century Reform rabbi {{and author}} Gunther Plaut argued that Isaac {{was not really}} deceived. Reading the story with close {{attention}} to the personality of Isaac, Plaut concluded that throughout the episode, Isaac was subconsciously aware of Jacob's identity, but, as he was unable to admit this knowledge, he pretended to be deceived. Plaut thus saw a plot within a plot, as Rebekah and Jacob laid elaborate plans for deceiving Isaac, while unknown to them Isaac looked for a way to deceive himself, in order to carry out God's design to bless his less-loved son. Plaut argued that Isaac was old but not senile. In his heart, Isaac had long known that Esau could not carry on the burden of Abraham and that, instead, he had to choose his quiet and complicated younger son Jacob. In Plaut's reading, weak and indecisive man and father that Isaac was, he did not <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>courage</b> to face Esau with the truth. His own blindness and Rebekah's ruse came literally as a godsend. Plaut noted that Isaac did not reprimand Jacob. Plaut concluded that no one, not even Esau, was deceived, for even Esau knew that Jacob was the chosen one.|$|E
25|$|The meeting {{took place}} on 19 July in the villa of Senator Achille Gaggia in Feltre, near Belluno. There Mussolini, Bastianini and Ambrosio met with Hitler and the generals of the OKW to discuss the {{situation}} and the possible countermeasures. The German delegation was full of generals, but neither Goering nor Ribbentrop were present, showing that the Germans were focusing on the military aspects of the situation. Ambrosio prepared for the meeting meticulously, and the day before spoke plainly to Mussolini, telling him that his duty was to exit {{the war in the}} next 15 days. The Germans, on the other hand, had lost faith in the Italians and were only interested in occupying northern and central Italy, leaving the Italian army alone to defend the country from the Allies. Moreover, they proposed that the Axis supreme command in the peninsula be taken over by a German general (possibly Rommel). The first two hours of the meeting were as usual a monologue by Hitler, blaming the Italians for their weak military performance and asking for draconian measures: Mussolini was unable to speak a word. The meeting was suddenly interrupted when an Italian aide came into the room and told Mussolini that at that moment the Allies were for the first time heavily bombing Rome. During the lunch pause, Ambrosio and Bastianini pressed the Duce to tell Hitler that for Italy a political solution to the war was necessary, but Mussolini replied that he had been tormented for months by the dilemma of leaving the alliance or continuing the war: in reality, Mussolini could not overcome the sense of inferiority he felt in the presence of Hitler , and did not <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>courage</b> to speak frankly with his German colleague.|$|E
