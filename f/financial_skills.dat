50|$|Member-owned organizations: These include {{self-help}} groups, credit unions, and {{a variety}} of hybrid organizations like 'financial service associations' and CVECAs. Like their informal cousins, they are generally small and local, which means they have access to good knowledge about each other's financial circumstances and can offer convenience and flexibility. Grameen Bank is a member-owned organization. Since they are managed by poor people, their costs of operation are low. However, these providers may have little <b>financial</b> <b>skill</b> and can run into trouble when the economy turns down or their operations become too complex.

40|$|Introduction: Impulsivity and {{risk-taking}} behaviours {{are reported}} in bipolar disorder (BD). We examined whether <b>financial</b> management <b>skills</b> are related to impulsivity in patients with BD. Methods: We assessed <b>financial</b> management <b>skills</b> using the Executive Personal Finance Scale (EPFS), impulsivity using the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS) and response inhibition using an emotional go/no-go task in bipolar individuals (N = 21) and healthy controls (HC; N = 23). Results: Patients had fewer <b>financial</b> management <b>skills</b> {{and higher levels of}} impulsivity than HC. In patients and controls, increased impulsivity was associated with poorer personal financial management. Patients and HC performed equally on the emotional go/no-go task. Higher BIS scores were associated with faster reaction times in HC. In patients, however, higher BIS scores were associated with slower reaction times, possibly indicating compensatory cognitive strategies to counter increased impulsivity. Conclusions: Patients with BD may have reduced abilities to manage personal finances, when compared against healthy participants. Difficulty with personal finance management may arise in part as a result of increased levels of impulsivity. Patients may learn to compensate for increased impulsivity by modulating response times in our experimental situations although whether such compensatory strategies generalize to real-world situations is unknown...|$|R
