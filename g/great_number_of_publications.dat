This study {{collected}} 89 papers {{related to}} transaction cost theory published between 1992 and 2013 from 19 journals in the Taiwan Social Sciences Citation Index database, and used bibliometrics and network analysis {{to examine the}} theory’s applications and development. The {{results show that the}} theory has mostly been applied in studies on technology management, transaction information, stocks/foreign exchange/investment, business transfers, strategies, opportunistic behaviors, performance, theoretical integration, human resources, relations, knowledge management, and consumer behaviors. Of these topics, strategies had the most samples; followed by stocks/foreign exchange/investment, which accounted for 19. 10 % of the total; followed by relations, with 17. 98 %; and technology management, with 11. 24 %.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to provide an overview <b>of</b> scientific <b>publications</b> on Interorganizational Cost Management (IOCM), both in Brazil and at the international level. The research at hand is carried out by way of a bibliometric study, with base in bibliographic research, employing an analysis of works published in both Brazilian conferences and online databases. Fifty-five studies that broach IOCM were found. The results also showed a low <b>number</b> <b>of</b> authors working in the same field (73 in total), of which 28 were Brazilian and 45 from other countries. Cooper and Slagmulder were found to be the most prolific of the international authors, while Souza and Rocha those with the <b>greatest</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>publications</b> in Brazil. Graphic representation using sociograms demonstrated the relationships existing between the authors of the works in question, displaying the non-relationship between Brazilian and international authors, and few links between the authors, in general.
