2500|$|While {{shooting}} {{a movie in}} Arizona, Stewart {{received a phone call}} from Dr. Keagy, his veterinarian, who informed him that Beau was terminally ill, and that Gloria sought his permission to perform euthanasia. Stewart declined to give a reply over the phone, and told Keagy to [...] "keep him alive and I'll be there." [...] Stewart requested several days' leave, which allowed him to spend some time with Beau before granting the doctor permission to euthanize the sick dog. Following the procedure, Stewart sat in his car for ten minutes to clear his eyes of tears. Stewart later remembered:After [...] died there were a lot of nights when I was certain that I could feel him get into bed beside me and I would reach out and pat his head. The feeling was so real that I wrote a poem about it and how much <b>it</b> <b>hurt</b> <b>to</b> realize that he wasn’t going to be there any more.|$|E
2500|$|In June 2013, Beck {{announced}} the expected release {{of two new}} albums for 2014, {{with one of the}} two being an [...] "acoustic" [...] album. The press release for the [...] "acoustic" [...] album (along with the news of his contract with Capitol Records) arrived in October 2013, announcing the title as Morning Phase and giving a February, 2014 release window. The other still-unfinished album would be planned for a later release. In comparing the production of Morning Phase with his previous album, Beck stated that prior to recording Modern Guilt in 2008, he had suffered a serious spinal injury, and that the recording process for Modern Guilt was like [...] "doing it with both hands tied behind your back. <b>It</b> <b>hurt</b> <b>to</b> sing. I'm whispering through half of those vocals." [...] On the other hand, Beck said that Morning Phase was a much more satisfying experience: [...] "Some of the songs on the new record – I get to shout and yell. I'm like, 'Thank you!' I had a lot of ideas and things I'd been wanting to do. This last year and a half, I feel like I can really do them." ...|$|E

60|$|Grace colored {{and moved}} away, feeling embarrassed. She had made herself ridiculous, and perhaps {{sentiment}} such {{as she had}} indulged was cheap; but <b>it</b> <b>hurt</b> <b>to</b> feel that she, so to speak, stood alone. Although she had, no doubt, been imprudent, she had said what she felt, and Thorn had smiled. She turned to him angrily when he followed her along the terrace.|$|E
60|$|Nearly half of A Son of the Middle Border had {{now been}} printed {{and while he}} had read it he was shy about {{discussing}} it. Something almost sacred colored the pictures which my story called up. Its songs and sayings vibrated deep, searching the foundation chords of his life. They told of a bright world vanished, a landscape so beautiful that <b>it</b> <b>hurt</b> <b>to</b> have some parts of it revealed to aliens--and yet he was glad of it and talked of it to his comrades.|$|E
60|$|She {{felt she}} could bear {{anything}} for him; she would suffer for him. She {{put her hand}} on his knee as he leaned forward in his chair. He took it and kissed it; but <b>it</b> <b>hurt</b> <b>to</b> do so. He felt he was putting himself aside. He sat there sacrificed to her purity, which felt more like nullity. How could he kiss her hand passionately, when it would drive her away, and leave nothing but pain? Yet slowly he drew her to him and kissed her.|$|E

60|$|Did I? I {{tried to}} put the {{question}} to myself and answer it honestly. Yes, in a sense, I had changed tonight. There was an added appreciation of her fineness, a quickening of that blend of admiration and pity which I had always felt for her. I wanted with all my heart to help her, to take her away from her dreadful surroundings, to make her happy. But did I want her in the sense in which she had used the word? Did I want her as I had wanted Audrey Blake? I winced away from the question. Audrey belonged to the dead past, but <b>it</b> <b>hurt</b> <b>to</b> think of her.|$|E
60|$|Gladwyne {{felt hot}} with shame. His mother had an unshaken {{confidence}} in his honor, which was the less surprising because her perceptions had never been very keen and she had always shrunk from the contemplation of unpleasant things. It was an amiable weakness of hers to idealize those she loved, and by resolutely shutting her eyes on occasions she succeeded in accomplishing it more or less successfully. Clarence was, of course, aware of this, and <b>it</b> <b>hurt</b> <b>to</b> remember that in deserting his cousin he had been prompted chiefly by craven fear. His mother, however, quite unconscious {{of what she was}} doing, further humiliated him.|$|E
6000|$|Johnny Chuck awoke just as jolly, round, red Mr. Sun {{pulled his}} own nightcap off. At first Johnny couldn't think where he was. He blinked and blinked. Then he rolled over. [...] "Ouch!" [...] cried Johnny Chuck. You {{see he was}} so stiff and sore from his great fight the day before, that <b>it</b> <b>hurt</b> <b>to</b> roll over. But when he felt the smart of those wounds, he remembered where he was. He was in the old hollow log {{that he had found}} {{on the edge of the}} Green Meadows just before dark. It was the first time that Johnny had ever slept anywhere, {{excepting}} underground, and as he lay blinking his eyes, it seemed very strange and rather nice, too.|$|E

6000|$|Was she {{ashamed of}} her little {{manoeuvres}} of these last few days--ashamed of having smiled at the young violinist, of that late return from the mountain climb, of the flower she had given him, of all the conscious siege she had laid since the evening her husband came in and sat watching her, without knowing that she saw him? No; not really ashamed! Her remorse rose only from the kiss. <b>It</b> <b>hurt</b> <b>to</b> think of that, because it was death, the final extinction of the mother-feeling in her; the awakening of--who knew what--in the boy! For if she was mysterious to him, what was he not to her, with his eagerness, and his dreaminess, his youthful warmth, his innocence! What if it had killed in him trust, brushed off the dew, tumbled a star down? Could she forgive herself for that? Could she bear it {{if she were to}} make him like so many other boys, like that young violinist; just a cynical youth, looking on women as what they called 'fair game'? But COULD she make him into such--would he ever grow like that? Oh! surely not; or she would not have loved him from the moment she first set eyes on him and spoke of him as 'an angel.' ...|$|E

[...] <b>It</b> <b>hurt</b> <b>to</b> have her tell us that [...] "you two are the first ones who ever came to see him about his work."

50|$|Part II {{starts with}} a secular {{revision}} of Pascal’s Wager, arguing “What does <b>it</b> <b>hurt</b> <b>to</b> pursue value and virtue? If there is value, then we have everything to gain, {{but if there is}} none, then we haven’t lost anything.” Thus, it rationally makes sense for us to pursue something of value.|$|E

[...] When the king insists {{on the need for}} a bridegroom, Toto suggests the stranger. When she learns that this stranger is Prince Doro, she asks him whether <b>it</b> <b>hurt</b> <b>to</b> be eaten by cannibals. Doro points out that he is alive, and Toto wishes to proceed with the wedding. The king, worried that Caramel may arrive and cause him embarrassment, leaves his prime minister, Zapeter, to explain the situation to Caramel, and the wedding party departs.|$|E

50|$|However, Orlando {{suffered}} Dissociative Identity Disorder {{prior to}} his contraction of lycanthropy and the multiple strains of wereanimals allowed his multiple identities ("multiple personalities") to manifest physically. Further, he seemed to incorporate identities from some of his victims. Chimera himself {{is the name of}} only a consciousness that formed in order to protect King's mind from his homicidal and sadistic impulses. The other revealed personalities were Coronus (Wereanaconda) who led {{the other members of the}} anaconda tribe during his and Anita's initial meeting. Boone (Werebear) who met with Anita in her household along with a half dozen other representatives for missing/concerned members, reporting his missing Ursa. It is also notable that while he could change forms according to lycanthropy, he also changed his human form to match. This is noted with Boone, described as a simply 'large' man with a voice deep enough <b>it</b> <b>hurt</b> <b>to</b> hear, while Orlando King is a mildly muscular with a growing paunch that had developed since he retired.|$|E
