5000|$|In computing, control-\ is {{a control}} {{character}} in ASCII code, {{also known as}} the <b>file</b> <b>separator</b> (FS) character. It is generated by pressing the [...] key while holding down the [...] key on a computer keyboard.|$|E
50|$|ASCII {{includes}} several control characters that {{are intended to}} be used as delimiters. They are: 28 for <b>File</b> <b>Separator,</b> 29 for Group Separator, 30 for Record Separator, and 31 for Unit Separator. Use of these characters has not achieved widespread adoption; some systems have replaced their control properties with more accepted controls such as CR/LF and TAB.|$|E
50|$|The Enhanced Graphic Module {{introduced}} two point plotting modes. Entering {{the normal}} point plot mode with the ACSII <b>File</b> <b>Separator</b> (FS), instead of RS for graph mode, plotted only the {{points at the}} coordinates being sent, not the vectors between them. Special point plot, entered with , added an intensity character to the coordinate that defocussed the beam and allowed the points to have various brightnesses.|$|E
40|$|This release {{contains}} minor updates to {{the initial}} release of SILLi v 1. 00 Improvements Conductivity in the energy equation is the geometric mean of fluid and rock conductivities. Result plotting during playback is significantly faster. Added {{an example of an}} igneous intrusion in a cooled pluton (i. e. no sedimentation or basin evolution involved). Bug Fixes Fixed plotting issue where in some cases whole range of observed data may not be plotted. Time step for last point in youngest sedimentary layer corrected. Fixed code so that <b>file</b> <b>separators</b> for Mac and Linux systems are recognized and used...|$|R

50|$|Most modern file systems allow filenames {{to contain}} {{a wide range of}} {{characters}} from the Unicode character set. However, they may have restrictions on the use of certain special characters, disallowing them within filenames; those characters might be used to indicate a device, device type, directory prefix, <b>file</b> path <b>separator,</b> or <b>file</b> type.|$|R
50|$|The {{second line}} in the {{canonical}} form includes a semicolon, {{which is used to}} separate statements in Perl. With only a single statement in a block or <b>file,</b> a <b>separator</b> is unnecessary, so it can be omitted from the minimal form of the program—or more generally from the final statement in any block or file. The canonical form includes it, because it is common to terminate every statement even when it is unnecessary to do so, as this makes editing easier: code can be added to, or moved away from, the end of a block or file without having to adjust semicolons.|$|R
50|$|The <b>separators</b> (<b>File,</b> Group, Record, and Unit: FS, GS, RS and US) {{were made}} to {{structure}} data, usually on a tape, in order to simulate punched cards.End of medium (EM) warns that the tape (or other recording medium) is ending.While many systems use CR/LF and TAB for structuring data, {{it is possible to}} encounter the separator control characters in data that needs to be structured. The separator control characters are not overloaded; there is no general use of them except to separate data into structured groupings. Their numeric values are contiguous with the space character, which can be considered a member of the group, as a word separator.|$|R
40|$|TreeGhatsData is a {{compilation}} of lists of tree taxa found in Western Ghats, South India: 	taxa for which the word "tree" appears in habit description in the book Flowering plants of the Western Ghats edited by the Tropical Botanic Garden Research Institute (TBGRI), including planted or cultivated taxa (Nayar, Beegam, and Sibi. 2014); 	tree taxa described after 2014 in journal articles; 	taxon names used in forest surveys published by the French Institute of Pondicherry (IFP), in journal articles from 2000, and in the Atlas of endemics of the Western Ghats (Ramesh and Pascal 1997); 	taxon names reported with "tree" habit in Indian Biodiversity Portal ([URL] For each plant name, TreeGhatsData includes the following taxonomic information: family, genus epithet, species epithet, infrataxon rank, infrataxon epithet, authority. Both the family name used in TBGRI book and the corresponding family name according to Angiosperm Phylogeny Group system III (APGIII; Bremer et al. 2009) are provided. TreeGhatsData includes the taxonomic status, the reference name and the authority according to TBGRI flora, along with taxonomic status from The Plant List version 1. 1 ([URL] From these two sources, a taxonomic status is suggested for each taxon name, with corresponding reference names and authorities. TreeGhatsData also includes ecological and biogeographic information from TBGRI and completed by the botanists of French Institute of Pondicherry (IFP). Because most vegetation surveys do not provide taxon names at infraspecific level, TreeGhatsData includes both the infraspecific taxa mentioned in Western Ghats and the corresponding specific binomial names. TreeGhatsData is provided as a CSV <b>file</b> with comma <b>separator.</b> Related references Bremer, B., Bremer, K., Chase, M. W., Fay, M. F., Reveal, J. L., Soltis, D. E., Soltis, P.

40|$|CHANGES IN qdap VERSION 2. 1. 1 BUG FIXES syllable_count {{returned}} the sentence (recycled) {{in the words}} column of the output. This behavior has been fixed. See GitHub issue # 188 for details. syn returned antonyms for some words. This {{was caused by the}} dictionary: qdapDictionaries::key. syn contained antonyms and elemets the were error messages (character). This has been fixed. Reference issue # 190. (Jingjing Zou) The pres_debates 2012 data set contained three errors in speech attribution. This has been corrected and the turn of talk (tot) as well. word_stats would throw an error if no poly-syllable words existed. This has been corrected (reported by Nicolas Turenne). NEW FEATURES qdap_df and %&% added to mimic some of the functionality of dplyr's tbl_df and chaining pipe in a more specific, less flexible, qdap oriented way. Text added to view and change the text. var attribute of a data. frame of the classqdap_df`. cumulative generic method added to view cumulative scores over time. formality picks up a cumulative method. polarity picks up a cumulative method. end_mark picks up a class (end_mark), plot method, and a cumulative method. syllable_sum, polysyllable_sum, and combo_syllable_sum pick up a class, plot method, and a cumulative method. wfm becomes a generic method currently applied to a text. var that is: character, factor (coerced to character), or wfdf. unbag added as a compliment to bag_o_words and friends for undoing string splitting. A convenience wrapper for paste(collapse = " "). as. Corpus. TermDocumentMatrix, as. Corpus. DocumentTermMatrix, and as. Corpus. wfm added to convert a matrix format to a tm::Corpus. exclude becomes a generic method for various classes. Functionality is the same but with improved code readability. check_spelling_interactive, check_spelling, which_misspelled, and correct allow the user to identify potentially misspelled words and optionally suggest replacements. random_data & random_sent added to generate random sentence data sets and vectors. comma_spacer added to ensure strings with commas contain a space after them. check_text added to identify potential problems in text. replace_ordinal added to convert ordinal representations of 1 through 100 to strictly ordinal text (e. g., " 1 st" becomes "first"). A vignette: Cleaning Text & Debugging was added to assist users with cleaning and debugging problems in qdap. pronoun_type, and subject_pronoun_type, object_pronoun_type added to examine usage of subject/object pronouns by grouping variable. MINOR FEATURES dplyr's chaining pipe imported for convenience. See [URL] for details. IMPROVEMENTS wfm gains a speedup through generic classes and tm package integration (strip is no longer used in wfm). as. tdm. character and as. dtm. character gain a speed boost with a tm package integration. Added message to as. data. frame. Corpus for missing end-marks suggesting the use of: sent. split = FALSE. as. Corpus familiy of functions didn't necessarily respect document names and sometimes used numeric sequence instead. The introduction of a reader via tm::readTabular has fixed this. sentSplit now gives warnings for text that may contain anomalies such as: non-ASCII characters, factors, missing punctuation, empty cells, and no alphabetic characters found. read. transcript now gives a warning when reading from a. docx <b>file</b> and the <b>separator</b> (sep) used is still found in the text as this may indicate the data did not split correctly. dispersion_plot now takes a named list of vectors of terms as the argument to match. terms. The vectors are combined as a unified theme named with the names of the list supplied to match. terms. CHANGES as. data. frame. Corpus's default value for sent. split is now FALSE. The state column in the qdap::DATA 2 data-set is now character (previously factor) ...|$|R
