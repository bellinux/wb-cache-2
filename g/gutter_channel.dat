40|$|Surface water {{flooding}} {{due to the}} inadequacy of local drainage is a significant UK concern (DEFRA, 2005; POST, 2007). Urban flood modelling and mapping are typified by characteristic terrain difficulties (Charteris et al., 2001). These difficulties include topographic complexity (road crests and gutters; raised house pads); infrastructure (including houses, fences, garden beds, etc); and, complex underground pipe networks (Charteris et al., 2001; Mark et al., 2004 a & b; Hunter et al., 2008; Neelz & Pender, 2007; Syme 2008). Designed to mitigate surface waters, drainage systems {{play a central role}} and include key features such as sewer pipes, kerbside <b>gutter</b> <b>channels,</b> gully pots and drains. These systems are often highly complex and spatially varied, simultaneously representing alternate flood pathways, hydraulic sinks and, potentially, additional flood sources (DEFRA, 2005). Accurate flood mapping (DEFRA, 2012) requires data rich modelling and, potentially, dynamic linking of models to form an integrated representation of urban surface and subsurface systems (DEFRA, 2005). Predicted data serves to estimate potential physical impacts, assessing likely damage to buildings and urban infrastructure (Kelman & Spence, 2004); or enhancing mapping further with peak velocities to provide detailed assessment of hazards to people (DEFRA, 2006; 2012). However such Integrated Urban Drainage (IUD; Gill, 2008) approaches are resource expensive (time and data requirements). Research into approaches offering more efficient representations is considered essential and timely. Therefore, the possible inclusion of proxy-model approaches offers an alternate tool for rapid hazard appraisal. Using a UK case-study approach, this Thesis addresses IUD modelling deficiencies through two specific aims: (i) examining IUD model development and impact on hazard prediction and, (ii) investigation of more resource-efficient proxy model approaches to the fully Integrated Urban Drainage model. Using TUFLOW hydrodynamic software (WBM, 2008), an IUD model of a dense UK urban area (2 sq km) is developed and examined. Firstly through small-scale IUD modelling showing improved IUD model performance with kerbside drainage and flow capture systems, particularly when based on depth-inflow criteria and, secondly, through enhanced infrastructure representation.

60|$|But I {{have spoken}} of the rivers of wheat, and I must explain {{what are those}} rivers. In the working of the elevator, which I have just {{attempted}} to describe, the two vessels {{were supposed to be}} lying at the same wharf {{on the same side of}} the building, in the same water, the smaller vessel inside the larger one. When this is the case the corn runs direct from the weighing measure into the shoot that communicates with the canal boat. But there is not room or time for confining the work to one side of the building. There is water on both sides, and the corn or wheat is elevated on the one side, and reshipped on the other. To effect this the corn is carried across the breadth of the building; but, nevertheless, it is never handled or moved in its direction on trucks or carriages requiring the use of men's muscles for its motion. Across the floor of the building are two <b>gutters,</b> or <b>channels,</b> and through these, small troughs on a pliable band circulate very quickly. They which run one way, in one channel, are laden; they which return by the other channel are empty. The corn pours itself into these, and they again pour it into the shoot which commands the other water. And thus rivers of corn are running through these buildings night and day. The secret of all the motion and arrangement consists, of course, in the elevation. The corn is lifted up; and when lifted up can move itself and arrange itself, and weigh itself, and load itself.|$|R

The first {{recorded}} use of the term as a blacksmithing tool is from 1864, according to Webster's Dictionary. The term used in historical Europe is largely unknown, and due to the constantly changing nature of language, the popular term also may have varied from generation to generation. King Thrasamund of the Vandals was recorded in a letter to King Theodoric the Ostrogoth, giving thanks for a gift of swords, and refers to the fullers in the blades as simply grooves: [...] "...their centers, hollowed out with beautiful grooves, seem to undulate with worm-like markings; for shadows of such variety you would think the metal was interwoven rather than shining with different colors." [...] The French often use the term goutiere (<b>gutter)</b> or cannelure (<b>channel).</b> The ancient Viking term is unknown. As a verb, the old French term [...] "gutter" [...] meant [...] "to cut small hollows," [...] as in the gutter of a crossbow. The addition of [...] "blood" [...] to these words (i.e.: [...] "blood channel," [...] "blood gutter," [...] "blood groove") was most likely a modern colloquialism, but gives the connotation of an unintended and undesirable purpose; that of directing blood toward the hands rather than lessening the weight of the blade. Therefore, in modern descriptions, fuller is often the preferred choice.|$|R
40|$|Stepped chutes {{have been}} used as {{hydraulic}} structures since antiquity.

During the last three decades, research in stepped spillways has been very active. However, studies prior to 1993 neglected the effect of free-surface aeration. A number of studies have focused since then on steep stepped chutes (theta approximate to 45 degrees), but the hydraulic performance of moderate-slope stepped channels is not yet totally understood.

40|$|Abstract Background Vetulicolians are a {{group of}} Cambrian metazoans whose {{distinctive}} bodyplan continues to present a major phylogenetic challenge. Thus, we see vetulicolians assigned to groups as disparate as deuterostomes and ecdysozoans. This divergence of opinions revolves around a strikingly arthropod-like body, but one that also bears complex lateral structures on its anterior section interpreted as pharyngeal openings. Establishing the homology of these structures is central to resolving where vetulicolians sit in metazoan phylogeny. Results New material from the Chengjiang LagerstÃ¤tte helps to resolve this issue. Here, we demonstrate that these controversial structures comprise grooves {{with a series of}} openings. The latter are oval in shape and associated with a complex anatomy consistent with control of their opening and closure. Remains of what we interpret to be a musculature, combined with the capacity for the grooves to contract, indicate vetulicolians possessed a pumping mechanism that could process considerable volumes of seawater. Our observations suggest that food captured in the anterior cavity was transported to dorsal and ventral <b>gutters,</b> which then <b>channeled</b> material to the intestine. This arrangement appears to find no counterpart in any known fossil or extant arthropod (or any other ecdysozoan). Anterior lateral perforations, however, are diagnostic of deuterostomes. Conclusions If the evidence is against vetulicolians belonging to one or other group of ecdysozoan, then two phylogenetic options seem to remain. The first is that such features as vetulicolians possess are indicative of either a position among the bilaterians or deuterostomes but apart from the observation that they themselves form a distinctive and recognizable clade current evidence can permit no greater precision as to their phylogenetic placement. We argue that this is too pessimistic a view, and conclude that evidence points towards vetulicolians being members of the stem-group deuterostomes; a group best known as the chordates (amphioxus, tunicates, vertebrates), but also including the ambulacrarians (echinoderms, hemichordates), and xenoturbellids. If the latter, first they demonstrate that these members of the stem group show few similarities to the descendant crown group representatives. Second, of the key innovations that underpinned deuterostome success, the earliest and arguably most seminal was the evolution of openings that define the pharyngeal gill slits of hemichordates (and some extinct echinoderms) and chordates. </p...|$|R
40|$|Stepped chutes {{have been}} used as {{hydraulic}} structures for more than 3. 5 millennia for different purposes: For example, to dissipate energy, to enhance aeration rate in the flow and to comply with aesthetical functions. They can be found acting as spillways in dams and weirs, as energy dissipators in artificial <b>channels,</b> <b>gutters</b> and rivers, and as aeration enhancers in water treatment plants and fountains. Spillways are used to prevent dam overtopping caused by floodwaters. Their design has changed through the centuries. In ancient times, some civilizations used steps to dissipate energy in open channels and dam over-falls in a similar fashion as natural cascades. However, {{in the first half of}} the twentieth century, the use of concrete became popular and the hydraulic jump was introduced as an efficient energy dissipator. In turn, the use of a stepped geometry became obsolete and was replaced with smooth chutes followed by hydraulic jump stilling basins. In recent years, new construction techniques and materials (Roller Compacted Concrete RCC, rip-rap gabions, wire-meshed gabions, etc.) together with the development of new applications (e. g. re-aeration cascades, fish ladders and embankment overtopping protection or secondary spillways) have allowed cheaper construction of stepped chutes, increasing the interest in stepped chute design. During the last three decades, research in the hydraulics of stepped spillways has been very active. However, studies prior to 1993 neglected the effect of free-surface aeration. A number of studies since this time have focused on air-water flows in steep chutes (&# 952; &# 8776; 50 o). But experimental data is still scarce, and the hydraulic performance of stepped cascades with moderate slope is not yet understood. This study details an experimental investigation of physical air-water flow characteristics down a stepped spillway conducted in two laboratory models with moderate slopes: the first model was a 3. 15 m long stepped chute with a 15. 9 o slope comprising two interchangeable-height steps (h = 0. 1 m and h = 0. 05 m); the second model was a 2. 5 m long, stepped channel with a 21. 8 o slope comprising 10 steps (h = 0. 1 m). Different arrangements of turbulence manipulators (vanes) were also placed throughout the chute in the second model. A broad range of discharges within transition and skimming flow regimes was investigated to obtain a reliable representation of the air-water flow properties. Measurements were conducted using single and double tip conductivity probes at multiple span wise locations and at streamwise distances along the cavity between step edges to obtain a complete three-dimensional representation of the flow. Although the present study was conducted for two moderate slope chutes (&# 952; = 15. 9 Âº & 21. 8 o), it is believed that the outcomes are valid for a wider range of chute geometry and flow conditions. The purpose of this study is to improve the understanding of turbulent air-water flows cascading down moderate slope stepped chutes, and gain new understandings of the interactions between aeration rate, flow turbulence and energy dissipation; scale effects are also investigated. The study provides new, original insights into air-water turbulent flows cascading down moderate slope stepped spillways not foreseen in prior studies, thus contributing to improve criterion designs. It also presents an extensive experimental database (available in a CD-ROM attached at the end of this thesis) and a new design criterion that can be used by designers and researchers to improve the operation of stepped chutes with moderate slopes. The present thesis work included a twofold approach. Firstly, the study provided a detailed investigation of the energy dissipative properties of a stepped channel, based upon detailed airwater flow characteristics measurements conducted with sub-millimetric conductivity probes. Secondly, the study focused on the microscopic scale properties of the airwater flow, using the experimental data to quantify the microscopic scale physical processes (e. g. momentum transfer, shear layer development, vertical mixing, airbubbles/ water-droplets break-up and coalescence etc.) that are believed to increase the flow resistance in stepped canals. The study highlighted the tridimensionality of skimming flows and hinted new means of enhancing flow resistance by manipulating turbulence in the stepped chute. Basic dimensional analysis results emphasized that physical modelling of stepped chutes is more sensitive to scale effects than classical smooth-invert chute studies and thus suggested that the extrapolation of results obtained from heavily scaled experimental models should be avoided. The present study also demonstrated that alterations of flow recirculation and fluid exchanges between free-stream and cavity flow affects drastically form losses and in turn the rate of energy dissipation. The introduction of vanes demonstrated simple turbulence manipulation and form drag modification that could lead to more efficient designs in terms of energy rate dissipation without significant structural load on the stepped chute...|$|R
