40|$|This PhD thesis {{explores the}} {{similarities}} between integrable spin chains and quantum field theories, such as Super Yang Mills. We first study integrable spin chains and build explicitly a polynomial "Backlund flow" and polynomial "Q-operators", which allow to diagonalize the Hamiltonian. We then study integrable field theories et show how to obtain "Q-functions", analogous to the Q-operators built for spin chains. It turns out that several important informations are contained <b>in</b> <b>the</b> analytic properties of these Q -functions. That allows to obtain, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> framework of the thermodynamic Bethe ansatz, {{a finite number of}} non-linear integral equations encoding the finite-size spectrum of the theory which we study.
