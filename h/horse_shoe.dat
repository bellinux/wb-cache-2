The man is only seen as a dark shadow on the ground, and is holding {{what appears to be a}} <b>horse</b> <b>shoe</b> or, more presumably, blades. The band's logo, a childlike drawing of the band's name created by lead singer Jonathan Davis, is seen on the sandy ground by Dark Shadow; the way it's positioned next to the girls' shadow makes it appear the latter is being hanged.|$|E
5|$|The first upgrade of MD234 was a {{relocation}} at Allens Fresh Run, {{which included}} replacing a dangerous one-way {{bridge over the}} stream, that was completed in 1933. MD237 was reconstructed with a bituminous stabilized gravel surface between Clements and Leonardtown in 1950 and 1951, a project that included new bridges over Clements Creek at a spot known as Head-of-the-Bay and over Nelson Run near Leonardtown. Reconstruction of MD234 from Allens Fresh to Chaptico and MD237 from there to Clements occurred between 1959 and 1961. MD234 and MD237 were significantly straightened out, leaving behind many sections of old alignment: Glasva School Road in Allens Fresh; Allens Fresh Road between Allens Fresh and Newport; Stines Store Road in Newport; Plater Road and Olde Mill Road in Wicomico; Stone Corner Lane, which is unsigned MD868G, and Reed Road in Budds Creek; and <b>Horse</b> <b>Shoe</b> Road between Chaptico and Clements. The project also involved new bridges over Gilbert Swamp Run, Chaptico Creek, and Budds Creek. When the project was completed in 1961, MD234 assumed the course of MD237 between Chaptico and Leonardtown and MD238 was extended over the segment of MD234 between Chaptico and Helen.|$|E
