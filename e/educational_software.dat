40|$|Aiming at the {{problems}} of strong subjectivity and uncertain fuzziness of attribute weights in the software usability evaluation approach, an evaluation approach based on mixed intelligent optimization was proposed, which combines subjective and objective methods to measure <b>software</b> usability for <b>educational</b> resources <b>software.</b> Firstly, the usability evaluation index system of <b>educational</b> resources <b>software</b> was established, and the basic probability assignment was generated by the interval method from the historical sample data. Then the weight optimization problem was adapted to the smooth optimization problem by the maximum entropy function method, and the hybrid social cognitive optimization (HSCO) algorithm was introduced to solve the optimal weights of evidence. Finally, the software usability level was fused by DS evidence theory.

25|$|Serious {{games are}} games that are {{designed}} primarily to convey information or a learning experience to the player.

Serious games are games generally made for reasons beyond simple entertainment and as with the core and casual games may include works from any given genre, although some such as exercise games, educational games, or propaganda games may have a higher representation in this group due to their subject matter. These games are typically designed to be played by professionals as part of a specific job or for skill set improvement. They can also be created to convey social-political awareness on a specific subject.|$|E

[...] Sue Talley, Apple's manager of strategic planning in education, said of the Classic: [...] "we see it going into applications where you need a fair number of powerful stations, but where color is not a big issue." [...] Talley mentioned that it was most suited for writing labs and other basic productivity uses. Many schools decided not to buy the Macintosh Classic {{because of the lack of}} a color monitor, an option which the higher-priced Macintosh LC had. The popular Apple IIe Card also increased the LC's appeal to schools. Although the Classic was more popular at first, by May 1992 the LC (560,000 sold) was outselling the Classic (1.2 million).|$|E
