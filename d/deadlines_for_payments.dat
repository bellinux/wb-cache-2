5000|$|Sidth (Vinay Forrt) {{who is an}} {{upcoming}} actor, is best friends with Richie (Ahmed Shaheen), who is constantly {{on the lookout for}} business opportunities. Sidth tries his luck at film sets and castings and is frustrated at the negative feedback. Sidth’s meeting with an indie film director fuels his hopes for his career. Richie, who meets an old friend (Avinash) of his, gets an idea to make some easy money. He invests in a ponzi scheme without Sidth knowing about it in detail. Sidth attends a casting for a big film producer, who in turns wants Sidth to give him sexual service in exchange for the role.Dr Roy (Rony David Raj)is a medical practitioner, who is also addicted to the real estate business. The addiction leads to debts and <b>deadlines</b> <b>for</b> <b>payments</b> begin interfering in his work. He has to pay Franko (Franko Davis Manjilla), a money-lending thug, 5,000 by the weekend. He contacts Deejay (Suraj Ramakrishnan")to make some money out of a rushed deal. He also invests in a fast cash scheme as second option, the same where Richie had invested.Q, the Indie film director (Jinu Joseph) who needs money for his production, goes to meet Franko under Deejays recommendation. Sidth tags along as the lead actor of the film. While meeting Franko, Sidth sees Shaji (Shaji T.U.), a money collector and learns that he always has a stack of cash in his sling bag.Arjun (Arjun Chemparathy) and Tina (Becky Thomas) have been dating for a while. Arjun, who is busy with his [...] "business”, is still a mystery to Tina. Tina is a divorcee who thinks that she has her life totally in control. Arjun surprises her by proposing to her and without her knowing, she falls in too deep for Arjun.Tony (Tony Luke) is an Indian living abroad. He had been involved in a business with someone in India while he was abroad. His partner in India cheats him, and Tony now wants to teach him a lesson. Tony contacts Luttu (Sabumon Abdusamad) and Plan B (Shani Shaki), two bounty hunters who use threats before harm to their victims. Luttu and Plan B are film enthusiasts who live and behave like film stars.Luttu and Plan B tracks Tonys Indian business partner and discovers that he is also known as Arjun, Tinas fiancée. They discover that Arjun had transferred all the money to U.S.A. Luttu takes Arjun’s phone to track down all who Arjun has dealings with. Luttu gives the bad news to Richie and Dr Roy, meanwhile Plan B finds a receipt of a diamond ring in Arjuns room. They decide to fetch it as their pay for the job. They beat Arjun badly and put him in the boot of at the car and head towards the cafe that he was supposed to meet Tina. Luttu now tells Tina the true side of Arjun, and she {{is in a state of}} disbelief. She asks for proof and Luttu asks her to check the boot of his car. Tina sees Arjun and realizes that Luttu was right. She is angry at first, but as the car drives away, she realises that she had let her fences down Arjun had gone in too deep into her heart. She is heartbroken.Richie, who had taken money from his parents to make the quick buck, is now panicking about the loss of it all. He tells Sidth about it. As they panic, Sidth sees Frankos collector Shaji walking past them. Sidth mentions that Shaji must have at least 60,000 in his bag, and hopes Shaji forgets his bag somewhere so Richie can get the money. Richie follows Shaji to a lane where he snatches the bag and runs. Richie runs straight to Sidth, and finds that there is not much money in the bag, as Dr Roy who had to pay Franko, has delayed his payments again. Shaji tracks Richie and sees him standing beside Sidth who he recognizes from Frankos place during the meeting with indie director.Franko, who is angry that Sidth and his friend tried to overpower Shaji, calls Deejay and tells him that he is going to teach them a lesson. Franko decides to shake all the late payers, including Dr Roy.Deejay calls Sidth to find out what went wrong. Sidth explains, and Deejay tells them to leave the city if they want to stay alive. Sidth and Richie decide to take the next train to Mumbai.Dr Roy gets fired from his job, as the hospital has had enough of his distractions at work. Dr Roy who has lost his job, and has no successful real estate deals, now faces Franko’s thugs who take his car away. While waiting for the train, Richie comes with one last crazy idea to sell their motorbike before they leave to Mumbai. Sidth calls him a fool, but gets a better idea. He borrows the bike and rides to the hotel where a film producer offered to cast him earlier. He lashes all his anger out on the producer by beating him up and steals all his money. He reaches the train station just in time as the train they have bought tickets to was leaving the station. They both run and hop on the speeding train. They leave to Mumbai, smiling.|$|E

If the full amount was not paid until 14 January 2017, they could be put under pressure to pay in two ways: each convict could be incarcerated for up to one year (this would not lower the amount of compensation), and a bailiff could seize the property of each mature convict (in this case only El-Hasan D.).|$|R
50|$|In May 2013, Vermont's Consumer Protection Act took effect. The Vermont law prohibits {{bad faith}} {{infringement}} threats, with bad faith indicated by: lack of specificity {{of the alleged}} infringement, settlement demands or damage claims that include excessive licensing fees, and unreasonably short <b>deadlines</b> <b>for</b> <b>payment</b> of demanded monies. Vermont's statute gives recipients of threat letters the right to counter-sue in state court, thus making it a less lucrative business model to send out large numbers of threat letters. As of August 2013, the Vermont legislation had not been tested in court as to violation of federal preemption, the legal principle that bars states from interfering in matters regulated or administrated {{by the federal government}} (such as aviation), or enforcement of federal law.|$|R

50|$|A list of claimants {{was printed}} in 1663, {{which serves as}} a useful source for {{identification}} of Royalist officers. This was a response to the commissioners' difficulties in controlling fraud: some of the claimants were accused of having inflated their army rank to receive a greater share of the distribution, or of having made claims based on officers' commissions they never exercised in the field. However, modern scholars judge the published list to be fairly accurate; contemporary suspicions may have arisen due to regional rivalries, as the £60,000 appropriated proved to be inadequate to relieve the needs of the many claimants. The act was amended in 1663 to allow the commissioners to examine witnesses in certain cases of suspected fraud and extended the <b>deadline</b> <b>for</b> <b>payment</b> to 24 September 1663.|$|R

5000|$|On May 20, 1977, Javier Ybarra {{was kidnapped}} by renegade {{members of the}} Basque separatist group ETA, who entered his home in disguise, bound and gagged members of his family, and took him away in an ambulance. Demanding {{the release of a}} number of Basque prisoners (a {{condition}} largely met by the Spanish government), his captors later demanded a ransom of one billion pesetas and further prisoner releases. The situation had been {{complicated by the fact that}} the group that had kidnapped Ybarra formally renounced their affiliation with the larger ETA organization while holding him and were further disturbed when their leader was arrested in France. The Ybarra family attempted to negotiate with the kidnappers and push back the <b>deadline</b> <b>for</b> <b>payment.</b> The kidnappers failed to respond and on June 20 they announced they had killed Ybarra and sent a map supposedly showing the location of the body. When the Guardia Civil failed to find it, another communication was sent and the body of Javier Ybarra was found near a farmhouse in Navarra.

40|$|Given the {{economic}} crisis that Romania is going through and which influenced in a negative manner the activity of economic agents throughout the country, Law no. 381 / 2009 has been adopted {{for the implementation of}} the preventive agreement and ad-hoc mandate, in order to support companies facing economic difficulties in their activity. Law no. 381 / 2009 became applicable on January 13, 2010 and it implements, {{as an alternative to the}} difficult and time-consuming procedure of insolvency, a contractual mechanism for companies facing difficulties in organizing their activities, outside the insolvency procedure, with limited involvement from the court. This regulation is seen as a solution against the opening of the insolvency procedure. The solution applies especially to small and middle sized companies. The preventive agreement implies a longer <b>deadline</b> <b>for</b> <b>payment</b> liabilities based on a friendly agreement with the creditors. It is a mechanism for avoiding insolvency and it consists of an agreement made between the debtor and the creditors regarding the way in which the debtor, which is in a difficult financial position, will pay all its outstanding debts. The law applies to all legal entities which reorganize a company going through a difficult financial period, without being in insolvency and which are called debtors. Nevertheless, the preventive agreement law still forces us to relate to the notion of insolvency...|$|R

Among IQ-Net partners, the first phase has been spent on awareness-raising activities and programme launch events. Most partners have also managed to get project generation under way. The early results suggest (generally) high levels of awareness and high demand for funds, although challenges remain, not least in terms of generating quality projects. Commitments and payments remain limited, mainly due to the need finalise management and control systems. However, most partners are optimistic with regard to n+ 2 and financial absorption. Other administrative challenges relate to monitoring arrangements, institutional changes and partnership management. Efforts are also being made to ensure coordination with other programmes, such as those under the Territorial Cooperation Objective, or in other closely linked policy fields, such as rural development and R&D. While the main focus has been on the 2007 - 13 period, the closure of the 2000 - 06 programmes continue to require attention, not least due to the approaching <b>deadlines</b> <b>for</b> final <b>payments.</b> Other operational issues include audit and control, as well as EU-level developments such as the ex post evaluation, which collectively ensure that the old programme period remains on the administrative agenda...|$|R
5000|$|A {{citizens}} group {{launched an}} internet petition against Hy-Vee and filed a suit with Hennepin County District Court on August 23 requesting that the demolition be halted. After the group's request was denied on September 19, an appeal was filed on September 23 with the Minnesota Court of Appeals asking {{that the court}} issue an emergency injunction to prevent the theater from being demolished. However, a demolition permit was obtained on Friday, September 23 and a crew began demolishing the theater the next day before the court could hear the case. A temporary restraining order was granted the same day by a Hennepin County judge and the demolition work was ordered to halt until September 27. On September 26, a judge's ruling required the citizens group to post a $2.8 million bond to the property owner and a $3.5 million bond to the city's Economic Development Authority by September 30. The Preservation Alliance of Minnesota, which serves as the fiscal sponsor for the citizens group that filed the suit, noted that [...] "bond requirements are not unusual in preservation lawsuits, but the largest we had heard of was around $150,000. $6.3 million is excessive, and unprecedented. And it flies directly {{in the face of}} the Minnesota Environmental Rights Act, which states that ANY CITIZEN can file a lawsuit in defense of endangered resources." [...] On September 29, the Minnesota Court of Appeals denied a request for a reduction of the amounts of the two bonds.

40|$|Technology {{has led to}} the {{development}} of new payment devices and processing systems, and a complicated body of public and private payments law has been established in response. In this environment, consumers have little control over how their payment instruments will be processed. They are subject to onerous adhesion contracts. It is difficult for consumers to understand the legal consequences of using one payment device over another. In light of these developments, many are questioning how much responsibility the law should impose on consumers when errors occur and how much protection they deserve. Some experts favor legal rules that take maximum advantage of the efficiencies technology can achieve and retention of the present legal rules which vary from one payment device and processing system to another. The better approach, however, is to recognize that consumers have common objectives, regardless of the type of payment device they use or how it is processed. These objectives can be achieved through uniform laws that apply to all types of payment instruments and systems. Those laws should guarantee the right to an error resolution procedure, adjudication of disputes before a judicial forum, and a sixty day <b>deadline</b> <b>for</b> reporting erroneous <b>payments...</b>|$|R

5000|$|In October 2015, NCC {{made the}} {{pronouncement}} to penalise MTN for {{their inability to}} disconnect 5.2 million unregistered subscribers on its network. According to the TSR signed by all stakeholders in the telecommunications industry, any erring MNO shall be charged with N200,000 or $1000 per unregistered SIM on their network after the <b>deadline</b> <b>for</b> the registration. Subsequently, the commission demanded the sum of $5.2billion being the total amount payable by MTN for their role in improper SIM registration, to be paid on or before 16 November 2015. In a swift move to pacify its shareholders, MTN published a press release {{on the same day}} of the pronouncement that the <b>deadline</b> <b>for</b> the <b>payment</b> of the penalty fee of the $5.2bn (16 November 2015) will not be effected by the commission {{until the end of the}} negotiation. As part of the strategy to re-stabilize the organisation, Phuthuma Nhleko, was appointed in temporary capacity as the Chairman of the organisation over the next 6 months. This action follows the resignation of Sifiso Dabengwa, the CEO of the organisation. Dabengwa in a letter confessed to Guardian Newspaper that [...] "Due to the most unfortunate prevailing circumstances occurring at MTN Nigeria, I, in the interest of the company and its shareholders, have tendered my resignation with immediate effect.". The office of the presidency in Nigeria took over the case of improper SIM registration. This instance warranted MTN group to organise a diplomatic meeting between president Jacob Zuma of South African and its Nigerian counterpart Muhammadu Buhari. The outcome of this meeting is the reduction of the fee from $5.2bn to $3.2bn. In a related development, many Nigerians are unhappy and took the case to a court of law for proper interpretation of the position taking by the government. A group of concerned Nigerian based in Abuja, said the action taking by the FGN is a slap on the fundamental human right and breach of our Nigeria constitutions. Timipa Okponipere, the lawyer to the applicant believe the action is not only a breached of Nigeria Constitution but an attempt by NCC to conspire with MTN to cheat Nigerians of our common wealth. He said, if the decision is not pursue to a logical end it would amount to mere academic exercise.|$|R

" This is the motto that realistically {{demonstrate}} the mutual payments situation between the companies in Republic of Macedonia. This situation of late obligations payment, causing a chain reaction and disruption liquidity of companies and the economy in general. It is estimated that domestic debt {{as a result of}} the financial indiscipline over the years, measured by billions of euros. In order to overcome this situation, in December 2013, The Law on financial discipline applying from 01. 05. 2014, the aim was to bring order to the payment of liabilities as the private sector and in state enterprises and institutions. The expectations were that the law will improve the liquidity of companies through the timely obligations payment between private - private and public - private sector. The law defined <b>deadlines</b> <b>for</b> liabilities <b>payment</b> of 30, 60 or 120 days if it has the written consent of the Parties. The penalties provided for in the Act of 1000 to 10, 000 euros, was to end unethical operation between companies and break the chain of illiquidity. The adoption of the law was welcomed by the business community and the scientific profession, with a warning that should be taken of the effects and adverse effects that can cause it, and inconsistencies and undefined terms that it has. Within 18 months of the application, Law of financial discipline has undergone two amendments and adoptions, and were adopted two instructions for timely fulfillment of financial obligations and oversight of business transactions between these economic operators from the private sector in order to overcome gaps and inconsistencies which contained the first version. It seems that the Macedonian economic conditions require a more cautious and studious approach in making such radical legislation for an extended period of adjustment to finally respect thereof.
