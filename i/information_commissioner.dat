5|$|Some {{had said}} that the {{database}} might lead to self-fulfilling prophecies, where children from difficult backgrounds were treated as potential delinquents. The government was accused of using the public's response {{to the death of}} Victoria Climbié to force through the unpopular proposal and to curb civil liberties. There were concerns that the database would undermine child protection and parents, weakening the power of parents to look after children, and would 'do more harm than good'. The sheer size of the database could have meant that serious cases would be overlooked due to the abundance of minor incidents. There were doubts towards the government’s estimate {{of the cost of the}} database. The <b>information</b> <b>commissioner</b> estimates it at £1bn, which Hodge said was 'absurd', and others raised concerns over the cost, noting that government projects tend to go over-budget. Some questioned children’s ability to give informed consent in their own right. Mary Marsh, chief executive of the NSPCC, wanted the database to cover the whole of the United Kingdom, not just England and Wales, saying 'the information held would be only partial and potentially worse than useless'. On 27 June 2006, a child protection conference, 'Children: Over Surveilled, Under Protected', held at the London School of Economics, reached the conclusion that the database would do nothing to prevent child abuse, and that it would undermine parents' ability to look after their children.|$|E

25|$|In March 2012 the <b>Information</b> <b>Commissioner</b> {{ruled that}} because emails the Financial Times had {{requested}} contained public information {{they could be}} the subject of a Freedom of Information request and ordered the information requested by the paper to be disclosed. Gove was also advised to cease the practice of using private email accounts to conduct government business. He disputed the Information Commissioner's ruling and proceeded to tribunal, costing taxpayers £12,540 in fees for legal advice, but the appeal was withdrawn.|$|E
25|$|In January 2005 the Freedom of Information Act 2000 {{came into}} force, {{allowing}} {{members of the}} public to request disclosure of information from public bodies. One early request came from the journalist Jon Ungoed-Thomas. Another request came from journalist and freedom of information campaigner Heather Brooke. Both asked for details of the expenses claimed by certain MPs to be released. The requests were subsequently passed over to the <b>Information</b> <b>Commissioner,</b> who joined the journalists' cases together and ordered the release of some information on 15 June 2007. House of Commons authorities objected to this order in June 2007 and MPs had, in May 2007, voted in favour of the Freedom of Information (Amendment) Bill which sought to exempt MPs from the 2000 act. The House of Commons voted 96 to 25 in favour of the Exemption of the House of Commons amendment but the bill was ultimately withdrawn prior to second reading in the House of Lords because peers were unwilling to sponsor the bill.|$|E
500|$|<b>Information</b> <b>Commissioner</b> John Reid {{criticized the}} new {{proposed}} powers for his department under the legislation, arguing {{that they would}} create unnecessary bureaucracy. Shortly after the Accountability Act was introduced to parliament, Reid issued an emergency report saying that the legislation would [...] "increase the government's ability to cover up wrongdoing, shield itself from embarrassment and control {{the flow of information}} to Canadians". He added that no government had ever put forward [...] "a more retrograde and dangerous" [...] set of proposals for dealing with access to information laws. Baird described Reid's criticisms as [...] "excessive", stating that most of the commissioner's specific concerns were minor in nature. Representatives of Canada's business community also expressed concern about changes to disclosure laws, arguing that their commercial secrets could be exposed to competitors.|$|E

500|$|The National Union of Journalists (NUJ) has criticised FITs {{for their}} {{surveillance}} and sometimes violent harassment of working journalists. Marc Vallee, who was hospitalised by police after documenting a protest, {{has said that}} the teams limit freedom of the press and called on the Home Office to confirm that the police had no right to restrict the work of photojournalists. Bob Broadhurst, {{who is in charge of}} public order policing at the Metropolitan Police, said in a statement to the NUJ in 2008 that journalists, [...] "on the production of a valid form of accreditation will be able to continue with their work". The NUJ are to make a formal complaint to the <b>Information</b> <b>Commissioner</b> due to the Metropolitan Police failing to provide details on the surveillance of journalists under the Freedom of Information Act. Bob Broadhurst told photographers at an NUJ conference that he had no faith in the National Press Card (a form of press pass) despite journalists needing to prove that they are bona-fide newsgatherers to an independent authority before they are issued.|$|E
500|$|Commentators {{expressed}} concern about the country's increasing surveillance. In August 2004, the <b>information</b> <b>commissioner,</b> Richard Thomas, drawing a parallel with the way that governments in Eastern Europe and Spain gained too much power and information in the 20th century, {{expressed concern}} over this and other national databases, including the Citizen Information Project, NHS National Programme for IT, and the introduction of identity cards, warning that there was a danger of the country 'sleepwalk into a surveillance society'. On 18 April 2006, Des Browne, the Secretary of State for Defence, said 'the Department for Education and Skills should also consider whether there is scope to realise further efficiency and effectiveness benefits through a child population register', and it is thought that the database may be used in conjunction with the National Identity Register and other databases. Phil Booth, national coordinator of NO2ID, a group opposing identity cards, said this was 'cradle-to-grave surveillance'. Conservative Party member of parliament Oliver Heald said, 'there is already public concern at government plans for a compulsory identity card database, a nanny state children's database and a property database for the council tax ...|$|E
500|$|In June 2012, Dunderdale's {{government}} {{brought forth}} controversial legislation, known as Bill 29, that reformed the province's Access to Information and Protection of Privacy Act. The {{amendments to the}} act expanded the government's ability to deny access to information by keeping ministerial briefings secret, ignoring requests for information that cabinet ministers deem to be [...] "frivolous," [...] and barring the auditor general from a wider array of records. Deadlines to respond to requests were pushed back, and fees were increased from $15 to $25. The opposition leaders immediately condemned the bill and said they would team up to filibuster the bill. An expert on international access-to-information laws, Toby Mendel, called key changes to the act “breathtaking,” and said the province will rank lower than some third world countries with the new legislation. As well 75 people also assembled outside the Confederation Building to protest the bill. However, Newfoundland and Labrador's <b>information</b> <b>commissioner,</b> Ed Ring, said bill 29 was {{not a bad thing}} and that it would not stop the Access to the Information and Protection of Privacy Act from doing its job. Bill 29 led to a four-day filibuster in the House of Assembly, which eventually ended when the government invoked closure to the debate. NDP leader Lorraine Michael's accusation that the government was being racist, when referring to Mendel's criticism of the bill, was cited by the government as reasons to end debate.|$|E

2500|$|Sun News Network (and, {{historically}} in print, Sun Media) carried {{frequent and}} ongoing {{criticism of the}} Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, and has accused the Crown-owned public broadcaster (which Sun Media has pejoratively termed [...] "The State Broadcaster") of having a left-wing bias and misusing taxpayer funds. The channel and Quebecor's newspaper chain filed hundreds of Access to Information requests seeking details of how CBC was spending its $1.1 billion budget. CBC's refusal to fill many of those Access to Information requests led to a court case filed against it by Canada's <b>Information</b> <b>Commissioner.</b> Sun News frequently aired news pieces and published articles alleging misspending of taxpayer dollars.

The organisation won a number of awards in its early years, including The Economist's New Media Award in 2008 at the Index on Censorship Awards and Amnesty International's UK Media Award in 2009. In 2010, the New York Daily News listed WikiLeaks first among websites [...] "that could totally change the news," [...] and Julian Assange received the Sam Adams Award and was named the Readers' Choice for TIME's Person of the Year in 2010. The UK <b>Information</b> <b>Commissioner</b> has stated that [...] "WikiLeaks {{is part of the}} phenomenon of the online, empowered citizen." [...] During its first days, an Internet petition in support of WikiLeaks attracted more than six hundred thousand signatures. Sympathisers of WikiLeaks in the media and academia commended it during its early tears for exposing state and corporate secrets, increasing transparency, assisting freedom of the press, and enhancing democratic discourse while challenging powerful institutions. In 2010, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights expressed concern over the [...] "cyber war" [...] being led at the time against WikiLeaks, and in a joint statement with the Organization of American States the UN Special Rapporteur called on states and other people to keep international legal principles in mind.|$|E
2500|$|There {{have been}} claims of disappearances {{by the police}} or the army in Kashmir by several human rights organisations. Human rights groups in Kashmir have {{documented}} {{more than three hundred}} cases of [...] "disappearances" [...] since 1990 but lawyers believe the number to be far higher because many relatives of disappeared people fear reprisal if they contact a lawyer. In 2016 Jammu and Kashmir Coalition of Civil Society said there are more than 8000 forced disappearances. State Human Rights Commission (SHRC) has found 2,730 bodies buried into unmarked graves, scattered in three districts — Bandipora, Baramulla, and Kupwara — of North Kashmir, believed to contain the remains of victims of unlawful killings and enforced disappearances by Indian security forces. SHRC stated that about 574 of these bodies have already been identified as those of disappeared locals. In 2012, the Jammu and Kashmir State government stripped its State Information Commission (SIC) department of most powers after the commission asked the government to disclose information about the unmarked graves. This state action was reportedly denounced by the former National Chief <b>Information</b> <b>Commissioner.</b> [...] Amnesty International has called on India to [...] "unequivocally condemn enforced disappearances" [...] and to ensure that impartial investigations are conducted into mass graves in its Kashmir region. The Indian state police confirms as many as 331 deaths while in custody and 111 enforced disappearances since 1989.|$|E
2500|$|In September 2012 the Administrative Appeals Chamber of the Upper Tribunal, in a {{unanimous}} decision, {{ruled that the}} letters should be published, overturning the previous ruling of <b>information</b> <b>commissioner</b> from 2010. The appeals chamber found that the commissioner had given [...] "insufficient weight to the public interest", when he chose to deny the disclosure of the letters, {{and found that it}} was in the public interest [...] "for there to be transparency as to how and when Prince Charles seeks to influence government". The tribunal also found evidence of [...] "Prince Charles using his access to government ministers, and no doubt considering himself entitled to use that access, in order to set up and drive forward charities and promote views, but not as part of his preparation for kingship...Ministers responded, and no doubt felt themselves obliged to respond, but again not as part of Prince Charles's preparation for kingship." [...] The tribunal also ruled that [...] "it was fundamental" [...] that Charles's lobbying [...] "cannot have constitutional status" [...] and must not be protected from disclosure. In evidence given to the tribunal, Stephen Lamport, who was the private secretary to the Prince of Wales from 1993 to 2002 said that Charles will stop writing to ministers were he to be crowned King, and that his letters formed part of his [...] "apprenticeship convention", in which the [...] "cardinal principle" [...] of not commenting on public policy did not apply to him while heir. Lamport believed that if what the Prince [...] "...says or writes to ministers were not to be confidential their exchanges would be 'bland and denuded' of any useful content" [...] and that Charles viewed the [...] "urging of opinions" [...] to government ministers to be part of his role as heir.|$|E
