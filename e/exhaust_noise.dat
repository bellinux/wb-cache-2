5|$|The second Avrocar had logged about 75 {{flight hours}} {{at the end of}} the flight testing. Judged by its performance, the Avrocar was an abject failure: it couldn't lift itself safely more than a few feet off the ground, and its bulbous design {{limiting}} high-speed performance accompanied by unbearable heat and screaming <b>exhaust</b> <b>noise,</b> made it impractical for the military. Although considered a technical failure, its design would be prophetic: it was a rubber skirt shy of being one of the world's first hovercraft, the Saunders Roe SR.N1 also taking off in 1959. Nevertheless, company designer John Frost applied for a number of patents in Canada, the UK and the U.S. that established the pivotal role that the Avrocar and related Avro experimental vehicles made in the VTOL world.|$|E

500|$|A Tesla Roadster {{was used}} to record the game's tire sounds. The {{developers}} chose the Tesla due to its near-silent electric motor which allowed them to record the sounds cleanly without engine or <b>exhaust</b> <b>noise.</b> Two microphones were mounted {{to the car and}} pointed at the tire for recording. Lance Hayes, the award-winning composer for Forza Motorsport 3, returned to score Forza Motorsport 4, which features a combination of his music and other licensed artists. 15 songs were provided by Hayes for the user interface and some in-race music. In speaking of the tone of the soundtrack, Hayes stated [...] "The score has an increased cinematic feel as well as incorporating many of the styles (downtempo, electronic, ambient) that made the Forza Motorsport 3 OST a fan favorite." ...|$|E
40|$|Noise {{control in}} the National Transonic Facility - a {{cryogenic}} wind tunnel - has been examined in terms of acoustical design criteria, drive-fan <b>noise</b> and <b>exhaust</b> system <b>noise.</b> A duct lining with two layers of perforated sheeting and a gas-filled honeycomb core was selected for attenuating drive-fan noise. With the exception of attenuation peaks, attenuation of the lining was found to experimentally agree with predicted values at 20 C air temperatures. <b>Exhaust</b> system <b>noise</b> will be attenuated with a large muffler {{used in conjunction with}} a 6. 1 -m high acoustical enclosure. Fan noise from the fan-ejector system will be attenuated by fan silencers and the acoustic enclosure...|$|R
5000|$|The {{high noise}} level {{was due to}} design and space {{restrictions}} in the engine cowlings {{which resulted in the}} exhaust [...] "stacks" [...] protruding directly from the cowling ring and partly covered by a small triangular fairing.

40|$|The main {{conclusions}} reached are: (1) At low subsonic jet <b>exhaust</b> velocities, jet <b>noise</b> varies as {{the velocity}} to the eighth power; (2) at high subsonic <b>exhaust</b> velocities, jet <b>noise</b> approaches a variation with velocity {{to the third}} power; (3) use of the jet density squared overcorrects density effects on jet noise; (4) subsonic and supersonic jet noise levels can be predicted; and (6) use of multielement nozzles and acoustically lined ejectors significantly suppress jet noise at intermediate jet exhaust velocities...|$|R

2500|$|One {{advantage}} of electrification {{is the lack}} of pollution from the locomotives. [...] Electrification results in higher performance, lower maintenance costs and lower energy costs. Power plants, even if they burn fossil fuels, are far cleaner than mobile sources such as locomotive engines. The power can come from clean or renewable sources, including geothermal power, hydroelectric power, nuclear power, solar power and wind turbines. Electric locomotives are quiet compared to diesel locomotives since there is no engine and <b>exhaust</b> <b>noise</b> and less mechanical noise. The lack of reciprocating parts means electric locomotives are easier on the track, reducing track maintenance.|$|E
2500|$|A new and {{short-lived}} {{option for}} 1970 was the vacuum operated exhaust (VOE), which was vacuum actuated via an underdash lever marked [...] "exhaust". The VOE {{was designed to}} reduce exhaust backpressure and to increase power and performance, but it also substantially increased <b>exhaust</b> <b>noise.</b> The VOE option was offered from November 1969 to January 1970. Pontiac management was ordered to cancel the VOE option by GM's upper management following a TV commercial for the GTO that aired during Super Bowl IV on CBS January 11, 1970. In that commercial, entitled the [...] "Humbler", which was broadcast only that one time, a young man pulled up in a new GTO to a drive-in restaurant with dramatic music and <b>exhaust</b> <b>noise</b> in the background, pulling the [...] "exhaust" [...] knob to activate the VOE and then left the drive-in after failing to find a street racing opponent. That particular commercial was also cancelled by order of GM management. Approximately 233 1970 GTOs were factory built with this rare option including 212 hardtop coupes and 21 convertbiles, all were [...] "YS" [...] 400ci 350hp with either four-speed manual or Turbo Hydra-matic transmissions. This particular GTO in the commercial was [...] "Palladium" [...] silver with a black bucket interior. It was unusual in several respects as it also had the under-dash [...] "Ram Air" [...] knob just {{to the right of}} the VOE knob, and it sported [...] "'69 Judge" [...] stripes, as a few very-early '70 GTOs could be ordered with. It also had a Turbo Hydra-matic transmission, remote mirror, Rally II wheels, A/C, hood tach, and a new-for-1970 Formula steering wheel.|$|E

Most models feature a spark screen which is integrated into the muffler. The spark screen prevents sparks from being discharged from with the exhaust and potentially igniting sawdust. The spark screen also reduces noise.|$|R

40|$|Trucks up to 25. 25 metres {{in length}} and {{weighing}} up to 60 tonnes are permitted in domestic traffic in Sweden. This deviates from the EU standard, according to which trucks {{are not to be}} longer than 18. 75 metres or weigh more than 40 tonnes. The Swedish Ministry of Enterprise, Energy and Communications has commissioned VTI to study what economic consequences this deviation has had for Sweden and to describe the competition interface between road and rail transport. The effects on transport costs for business, <b>exhaust</b> and <b>noise</b> emissions, road wear, time delay for motorists and road safety have been estimated. A very large proportion of freight transport by road takes place by vehicles that exceed the EU standard. Reducing vehicle size would lead to large economic losses. Transport costs would increase in particular, but significant cost increases would also occur in the areas of road safety, <b>exhaust</b> emissions and <b>noise</b> emissions.

5000|$|Corvettes {{have a very}} {{characteristic}} and noticeable <b>exhaust</b> <b>noise,</b> as {{has been}} mentioned earlier in the Design section. Due to the low and shallow angle of the exhaust pipe from the turbocharger plus very limited space, conventional marine silencers are not used on Corvettes, despite attempts by the latest company. Consequently the exterior <b>exhaust</b> <b>noise</b> has a noticeable low frequency booming characteristic. This is very apparent from the rear and flybridge decks. Within the boat, however, this booming noise is much less apparent. Noise levels have been commented on {{in one of the}} earlier press reports ("Reviews in the press" [...] section below - No. 6), saying they were [...] "about average....but the diesel rumble was very apparent". They added that adding a thick carpet would make a [...] "huge difference". These comments referred only to the noise inside the cabins, not the exhaust booming noise mentioned above. Of all the many press reports and tests on Corvettes, however, no other reference singles out noise as a feature of Corvettes, suggesting that noise intrusion can be very subjective and not an issue with the majority of owners.|$|E
50|$|The Orochi Kabuto {{was later}} {{released}} as a production car in 2009, and {{was limited to}} five cars.
