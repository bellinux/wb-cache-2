40|$|Abstract: Low {{frequency}} arrays (120 to 400 MHz) can be calibrated using a sky model {{based on}} sky maps. For a single antenna, the variation of measured {{power with the}} Earth’s rotation is needed to separate receiver gain and noise temperature. For an array, an instantaneous calibration can be made using normalized correlations or normalized beam power for which the receiver gain cancels out. Examples of the sky model for various antenna orientations are shown along with measured data used to perform a calibration. The effects of unmodeled mutual coupling of the received signals and receiver noise on the calibration method are analyzed and found to result in errors {{of only a few}} percent in an array of 5 × 5 crossed-dipoles designed to observe the <b>deuterium</b> <b>line</b> at 327 MHz.

All of the cameras ’ detectors and optics are placed inside a magnetic field of up to 4 T. Images of the cameras are recorded simultaneously using two three-channel color framegrabber cards. Two CCD cameras are used typically to generate two-dimensional emissivity profiles of <b>deuterium</b> <b>line</b> radiation from the divertor. Interference filters are used to select the spectral line to be measured. The local emissivity is obtained by inverting the measured brightnesses assuming toroidal symmetry of the emission. Another use of the cameras is the identification and localization of impurity sources generated by the ion cyclotron radio frequency (ICRF) antennas, which supply the auxiliary heating on Alcator C-Mod. The impurities generated by the antennas are identified by correlating in time the injections seen at the cameras with measurements made with core diagnostics.

40|$|AbstractDimerization of the {{transmembrane domain}} of glycophorin A is {{mediated}} by a seven residue motif LIxxGVxxGVxxT {{through a combination}} of van der Waals and hydrogen bonding interactions. One of the unusual features of the motif is the large number of β-branched amino acids that may limit the entropic cost of dimerization by restricting side-chain motion in the monomeric transmembrane helix. Deuterium NMR spectroscopy is used to characterize the dynamics of fully deuterated Val 80 and Val 84, two essential amino acids of the dimerization motif. Deuterium spectra of the glycophorin A transmembrane dimer were obtained using synthetic peptides corresponding to the transmembrane sequence containing either perdeuterated Val 80 or Val 84. These data were compared with spectra of monomeric glycophorin A peptides deuterated at Val 84. In all cases, the <b>deuterium</b> <b>line</b> shapes are characterized by fast methyl group rotation with virtually no motion about the Cα-Cβ bond. This is consistent with restriction of the side chain in both the monomer and dimer due to intrahelical packing interactions involving the β-methyl groups, and indicates that there is no energy cost associated with dimerization due to loss of conformational entropy. In contrast, deuterium NMR spectra of Met 81 and Val 82, in the lipid interface, reflected greater motional averaging and fast exchange between different side-chain conformers...|$|E

Results from these measurements, together with polarizing microscopy, show that the substance is in a crystalline state up to 90 °C. At this temperature the compound melts and a uniaxial discotic mesophase appears. The liquid crystalline phase persists until the clearing point at 191 "C. The differential scanning calorimetry thermograms confirmed these transitions but exhibited additional peaks below 90 °C. The phase behavior at low temperatures (< 90 °C) differs significantly from previous reports by Warmerdam et al. (Liq. Cryst. 1988, 3, 149 and 1087). Solid-state <b>deuterium</b> <b>line</b> shape simulations were {{used to examine the}} motions of the labeled methylene site.

It was shown that there exist, even at - 100 °C, fast motions of the α-deuterons with rates relatively close to the Larmor frequency.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2012 This work is {{directed}} towards building {{an understanding of}} the dynamics of protein/peptide adsorbed on inorganic surfaces. Deuterium solid state NMR(SSNMR) is a very special tool for probing molecule dynamics in solid state. The probing of dynamic information is realized by simulation of the <b>Deuterium</b> <b>line</b> shape and relaxation data in the experiment. Two different SSNMR experiments are used: the quadrupole echo experiment and MAS experiment. The simulation of quadrupole echo experiment adopted the public simulation program MXET 1, while the simulation of MAS experiment adopted the house made program KLDMAS. The theory and part of the KLDMAS code are described in detail in Chapter II. Then the codes were used to simulate the dynamics of peptide side chain on different inorganic surfaces. In this thesis, two peptides adsorbed on surfaces were studied, LKalpha 14 and SN 15. LKalpha 14 is a 14 amino acid peptide with a periodic sequence of leucine and lysine residues consistent with an amphipathic alpha-helix. By using both quadrupole echo and MAS experiments, together with SFG method, it is found that the dynamics of the leucine side chains in this peptide is quantifiable, and is strongly upon the orientation of the polymer on the surface, which in turn depends on whether the LKalpha 14 peptide adsorbs onto a polar or non-polar surface. Another peptide-surface system is SN- 15 peptide binding on hydroxyapatite surface. The dynamics of phenylalanine side chains in SN- 15 are studied using deuterium MAS line shape and relaxation. The spectra are interpreted using a model in which the phenylalanine side chain exchanges between rotameric states. Although rotameric exchange motions of phenylalanine have been observed for small peptides in solutions, {{this is the first time}} such exchange has been observed in solid state samples. Moreover, when the dynamics of two different phenylalanine side chains within the SN- 15 peptide are compared, both rotameric populations and rotameric angles differ as functions of orientation and surface proximity. These results show that the side chain dynamics of surface-adsorbed peptides are very different with the same peptides in solid, but actually resemble to the dynamics of side chains in solution state...|$|E

We also undertake an investigation of systematic errors in a system where an existing deuterium measurement has been made. We measure the number of hydrogen components and their velocity distributions in a moderate and high redshift sample of Lyman limit systems in one Angstrom resolution spectra. We present a new measurement of the deuterium-to-hydrogen ratio, D/H, at z= 3. 2560 in a newly-discovered low metallicity absorption system towards the quasar PG 1937 - 1009. We attempt to account for any systematic effects that could influence the D/H measurement. We find a 1 sigma range for D/H* 1 e 5 of 1. 6 (+ 0. 25) (- 0. 30). Using high resolution spectra from the Hubble Space Telescope and the Very Large Telescope, we assess the suitability of five D/H candidate absorption systems. These systems were selected as candidates using lower resolution spectra. We measure the neutral hydrogen column density, identify metal lines and analyse the velocity structure of each system, and show them to be unsuitable for measuring D/H. We also investigate the systematic errors in the absorber at z= 0. 701 towards quasar PG 1718 - 4801 that was initially thought to show a high primordial D/H value.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{recognized}} long ago {{that the presence of}} hot plasma in the inner accretion disks around black holes could lead to the neutron production via dissociation of helium nuclei. We show that, for a broad range of accretion parameters, neutrons effectively decouple from protons and pile up in the inner disk leading to the formation of self-sustained halo. This means that new neutrons in the halo are supplied mainly by the splitting of helium nuclei in their collisions with existing neutrons. Once formed, such a halo can exist even if the proton temperature is much lower than the energy threshold of helium dissociation. We show that neutron haloes can be the natural source of relativistic electrons and positrons, providing characteristic comptonization spectra and hard spectral tails observed in many black hole candidates, and also giving rise to relativistic outflows. <b>Deuterium</b> gamma-ray <b>line</b> at 2. 2 MeV resulting from neutron capture is also expected at a level detectable by future INTEGRAL mission.

We have found that the temperature fluctuations paradigm is consistent with the t 2 (He I) vs. t 2 (H I) relation for H II regions, in contrast with what has been found for planetary nebulae. We report the detection of <b>deuterium</b> Balmer <b>lines</b> up to D 6 in the blue wings of the hydrogen lines, which excitation mechanism seems to be continuum fluorescence.

40|$|High-resolution Copernicus {{spectra of}} Epsilon Eri and Epsilon Ind {{containing}} interstellar hydrogen and <b>deuterium</b> L-alpha absorption <b>lines</b> are presented, reduced, and analyzed. Parameters of the interstellar hydrogen and deuterium toward these two stars are derived independently, without any assumptions concerning the D/H ratio. Copernicus spectra of Alpha Aur and Alpha Cen A are reanalyzed, and {{limits on the}} D/H number-density ratio consistent with the data for all four stars are considered. A comparison of the present estimates for {{the parameters of the}} local interstellar medium with those obtained by other techniques shows that there is no compelling evidence for significant variations in the hydrogen density and D/H ratio in the local interstellar medium. On this basis the hypothesis of an approaching local interstellar cloud proposed by Vidal-Madjar et al. (1978) is rejecte...|$|R
40|$|The {{dynamic and}} {{structural}} {{properties of the}} ammonia-doped superconducting fulleride (NH 3) (x) NaK 2 C 60 (0. 5 <= x <= 1), well known for its anomalous decrease of transition temperature with doping, have been investigated using sodium and deuterium solid-state NMR techniques. The independence of Na- 23 quadrupole splitting from the ammonia content x, which, at the same time, substantially affects T-c, suggests a marginal role of the cation position in the superconducting mechanism. On the other hand, a strong reduction of the deuterium quadrupole coupling {{with respect to the}} free ammonia value denotes the presence of weak hydrogen bonds between the deuterium atoms and fullerene pi orbitals. Despite the bond weakness, as evinced by the lively ammonia rotational dynamics even at very low temperatures, the resulting electron localization could explain the observed T-c anomaly. The motion of the ND 3 -Na group (located in the compound's octahedral voids), as well as the evolution of the ammonia dynamics as a function of temperature, were determined from <b>deuterium</b> NMR <b>line</b> shape analysis and from detailed numerical simulations. While at the lowest measured temperatures only the ammonia rotation around its own C- 3 axis takes place, above similar to 25 and 70 K, respectively, also the wobbling of the C- 3 axis and the ND 3 relocation become active, successfully modeled by a strongly correlated motion involving two different time scales...|$|R
40|$|A Solid State Neutral Particle Analyzer (SSNPA) array {{has been}} {{installed}} on the National Spherical Torus Experiment (NSTX). The array consists of four chords viewing through a common vacuum flange. The tangency radii of the viewing chords are 60, 90, 100, and 120 cm. They view across the three co-injection neutral beam <b>lines</b> (<b>deuterium,</b> 80 keV (typ.) with tangency radii 48. 7, 59. 2, and 69. 4 cm) on NSTX and detect co-going energetic ions. A silicon photodiode used was calibrated by using a mono-energetic deuteron beam source. Deuterons with energy above 40 keV can be detected with the present setup. The degradation of the performance was also investigated. Lead shots and epoxy are used for neutron shielding to reduce handling any hazardous heavy metal. This method also enables us to make an arbitrary shape to be fit into the complex flight tube...|$|R
40|$|We present new {{analytic}} {{calculations of}} the coupling between ultraviolet resonance photons {{and the population}} of the hyperfine states in the light elements (H, D, 3 He +) which include several previously neglected physical processes. Among these are the backreaction of resonant scattering on the pumping radiation, the scattering of Lyβ photons and the effect of local departure from pure Hubble flow. The application of the new treatment to the redshifted hydrogen 21 and <b>deuterium</b> 92 cm <b>lines</b> from the high-redshift universe results in an amplitude correction of up to an order of magnitude. We further show that the standard assumption that ultraviolet pumping drives the spin temperature towards the kinetic temperature does not hold for deuterium, whose spin temperature is generally negative.

40|$|Theoretical line {{profiles}} {{are presented}} that demonstrate why 100, 000 spectral resolution and high S/N {{are needed to}} derive accurate column densities from spectral lines that lie close to the flat part of the curve of growth and may contain multiple velocity components. The aim of the Space Telescope high-resolution-spectrograph observing program is to obtain column densities in the hydrogen and <b>deuterium</b> Lyman alpha <b>lines</b> along a variety of lines of sight within and extending beyond the local cloudlet, in which the sun is located near an edge. The broad chromospheric Lyman alpha emission lines of late-type stars are used as background sources against which to measure the interstellar absorption features. Profiles of interstellar absorption features in Mg II and Fe II lines will be obtained to derive the broadening parameter and/or identify possible multiple velocity components in the lines of sight...|$|R
