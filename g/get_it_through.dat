When asked in an {{interview}} about his [...] "unconventional entry with a bunch of newcomers", Salmaan stated that it was his conscious decision as he felt that [...] " ... when an actor debuts, he has to earn the right to be a hero and not <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>through</b> a shortcut route." [...] The film received mixed reviews. A critic for Sify stated, [...] " ... it is Salmaan's amazing screen presence and a matured acting style that makes the movie an engaging watch", while Paresh C Palicha of Rediff criticized his performance. [...] "There is no denying that he looks dapper and has an attractive baritone (a gift of his gene pool). But that does not translate into good performance or acting." [...] The film was commercially successful and won him the Filmfare Award for Best Male Debut.|$|E
500|$|Debate was vigorous. One {{delegate}} {{said that}} UFA members wanted social credit, {{and if they}} could not <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>through</b> the UFA they would find other means. After three hours, UFA Vice President Norman Priestly noted in frustration that delegates were debating the merits of [...] "a system of social credit as outlined by" [...] Aberhart without ever having heard Aberhart outline his proposed system. It was agreed to invite Aberhart to appear. Using the analogy of blood flowing through the human body, {{he argued that the}} [...] of blood contained in the human body were sufficient for the heart to pump much more than that per day; so it was, he argued, with currency, whose circulation needed to be accelerated to enhance Albertans' purchasing power. He closed by expressing pessimism that the delegates would choose to support social credit, and this pessimism proved well-founded: though sources are inconsistent on the precise outcome—journalist John Barr reports that the exact vote was not recorded, while historian Bradford Rennie states there were 30 affirmative votes out of 400 delegates present—there is agreement that the resolution was handily defeated. While the vote appeared to be a decisive victory for Reid and his fellow traditionalists, Byrne suggests that many members abstained.|$|E

500|$|Siberian mammoth ivory is {{reported}} to have been exported to Russia and Europe in the 10th century. The first Siberian ivory to reach western Europe was brought to London in 1611. When Russia occupied Siberia, the ivory trade grew and it became a widely exported commodity, with huge amounts being excavated. From the 19th century and onwards, woolly mammoth ivory became a highly prized commodity, used as raw material for many products. Today it is still in great demand as a replacement for the now-banned export of elephant ivory, and has been referred to as [...] "white gold". Local dealers estimate that there are 10 million mammoths still frozen in Siberia, and conservationists have suggested that this could help save the living species of elephants from extinction. Elephants are hunted by poachers for their ivory, but if this could instead be supplied by the already extinct mammoths, the demand could instead be met by these. Trade in elephant ivory has been forbidden in most places following the 1989 Lausanne Conference, but dealers have been known to label it as mammoth ivory to <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>through</b> customs. Mammoth ivory looks similar to elephant ivory, but the former is browner and the Schreger lines are coarser in texture. In the 21st century, global warming has made access to Siberian tusks easier, since the permafrost thaws more quickly, exposing the mammoths embedded within it.|$|E

Although he was elected acting governor by the Executive Council between the three proprietary deputies of former governor, Edward Tynte, after his death, received one vote more than his opponent Thomas Broughton, <b>getting</b> <b>it</b> <b>through</b> bribery. This sparked a conflict between both the oppositions and their supporters which finished with the Lords Proprietors declaring the election of Gibbes illegal (although they allowed them to rule for almost a year) and the appointment of Charles Craven as governor of South Carolina in 1711, who didn't arrive until 1712.|$|R
