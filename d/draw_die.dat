During the stamping process, air may be trapped between the <b>draw</b> <b>die</b> and the panel.

In comparison with conventional steels, AHSS stampings produce higher contact pressures at the interface between <b>draw</b> <b>die</b> and sheet metal blank, resulting in more severe wear conditions, particularly at the <b>draw</b> <b>die</b> radius. Developing the ability to accurately predict and reduce the potential tool wear during the tool design stage is vital for shortening lead times and reducing production costs. This thesis investigates the influence of <b>draw</b> <b>die</b> geometry on the wear distribution over the <b>draw</b> <b>die</b> radius for AHSS and develops a methodology for optimising the <b>draw</b> <b>die</b> geometry to reduce wear using numerical and experimental methods. Tool wear predictions on automotive sheet metal forming die and recommended protections of the tool surface under the initial production conditions were obtained from AutoForm simulation software. Effects of lubrication coefficients, binder pressure loads and die coating on tool wear distributions were investigated as well. It is concluded that the areas that are most sensitive to tool wear occurs at the locations corresponding to the large gradient of drawing depth. To study the tool wear distributions for more common stamping parts, a numerical tool wear model was developed and applied using the commercial software package Abaqus. Channel tests are carried out using an Erichsen sheet metal tester with high pressure prescale films to verify the numerical model results. Comparing the results obtained from the prescale film with {{the results from the}} simulation, it is concluded that the contact pressure distributions indicated by the prescale film are consistent with those from the simulation. Various geometries of radius arc profiles, including standard circular profiles, high elliptical profiles, and flat elliptical profiles, were numerically investigated using the tool wear model developed, and the contact pressure distribution and tool wear work along the radii were determined. The following conclusions were reached from the investigations: (1) The colour contour of the high contact pressure on the die radius can be divided into three distinct zones of high pressure and tool wear; (2) The dominant zone leading to maximum contact pressure and tool wear severity depends on the geometry of die radius profile under the same material and process conditions; (3) The geometry of <b>draw</b> <b>die</b> radius has a significant influence on the tool wear and standard circular and elliptical curves can lead to the achievement of reduced and uniform contact pressure distribution (wear distribution) along most of zones of the <b>draw</b> <b>die</b> radius arc. The results suggest that to minimise contact pressure and tool wear using this approach it would be necessary to optimise the shape for a particular combination of material type, thickness and forming process. Effects of control parameters, such as blank geometry, punch geometry, deep-drawing process parameters and tool material, on wear behaviour in deep-drawing for various shape of die radius were then investigated to provide guidelines for impacts of these parameters. A specialised software routine was then compiled for optimisation of die radius profiles to minimise and achieve uniform contact pressure (wear distribution) using Python programming language. The routine was fully integrated with Abaqus software and has the following functions: (1) To provide a user-friendly Graphical User Interface for pre-processing data input for users who have less experience and skill; (2) To optimise a die radius profile according to the control parameters that users input. The results obtained are relevant to the issue of reducing the high tool wear in automotive stamping tools by predicting the causes of such tool wear related to tool geometry and process parameters. They provide useful guidelines for enhancing the tool life of sheet metal processing in automotive industry...|$|E

This paper highlights development of ‘draw ’ component and the changes made in product design due to manufacturing and assembly reasons considering the design intent; and also the advantages of using various ‘CAE’ softwares used in designing draw tools. It helps reducing the complete product development cycle as compared to what happens with conventional methods. Lesser effort and ease to model the complete setup and important features with different design parameters, improved the product development without compromising quality.

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} elastic {{behaviour}} {{of the mechanical}} double action press and <b>draw</b> <b>die</b> system commonly used to draw sheet metal components in the automotive industry. High process variability in production and excessive time spent in die try-out are significant problems in automotive stamping. It has previously been suggested that the elastic behaviour of the system may contribute to these problems. However, the mechanical principles that cause the press system to affect the forming process have not been documented in detail. Due to a poor understanding of these problems in industry, the elasticity {{of the press and}} tools is currently not considered during the die design. The aim of this work was to explore the physical principles of press system elasticity and {{determine the extent to which}} it contributes to problems in try-out and production. On the basis of this analysis methods were developed for controlling or accounting for problems during the design process. The application of frictional restraining force to the edges of the blank during forming depends on the distribution and magnitude of the clamping force between the binders surfaces of the <b>draw</b> <b>die.</b> This is an important control parameter for the deep drawing process. It has been demonstrated in this work that the elasticity of the press and <b>draw</b> <b>die</b> can affect clamping force in two ways. The response of the press system, to the forces produced in the press during forming, causes the magnitude of clamping force to change during the stroke. This was demonstrated using measured data from a production press. A simple linear elastic model of the press system was developed to illustrate a definite link between the measured force variation and the elasticity of the press and tools. The simple model was extended into a finite element model of the complete press system, which was used to control a forming simulation. It was demonstrated that stiffness variation within the system could influence the final strains in a drawn part. At the conclusion of this investigation a method is proposed for assessing the sensitivity of a part to clamping force variation in the press during die design. A means of reducing variation in the press through the addition of a simple linear spring element is also discussed. The second part of the work assessed the influence of tool structure on the distribution of frictional restraining forces to the blank. A forming simulation showed that tool stiffness affects the distribution of clamping pressure between the binders. This was also shown to affect the final strains in a drawn part. However, the most significant influence on restraining force was the tendency of the blank to increase in thickness between the binders during forming. Using a finite element approximation of the try-out process it was shown that the structure of the tool would also contribute to the problems currently experienced in try-out where uneven contact pressure distributions are addressed by manually adjusting the tool surfaces. Finally a generalised approach to designing <b>draw</b> <b>die</b> structures was developed. Simple analysis methods were combined with finite element based topology optimisation techniques to develop a set of basic design guidelines. The aim of the guidelines was to produce a structure with uniform stiffness response to a pressure applied at the binder surface. The work concludes with a recommendation for introducing the methods developed in this thesis into the standard production process...|$|E

The presented technical approach integrates collaborative diagnostic and prognostic techniques from engineering disciplines including statistical reliability, damage accumulation modeling, physics of failure modeling, signal processing and feature extraction, and automated reasoning algorithms. These advanced prognostic/diagnostic algorithms utilize intelligent data fusion architectures to optimally combine sensor data with probabilistic component models to achieve the best decisions on the overall health of digital components and systems.
