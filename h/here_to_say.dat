500|$|During the {{epilogue}} campaign, {{the combined}} forces of Kerrigan, Raynor and Artanis {{ventured into the}} void in order to rescue [...] "Tassadar" [...] (really Ouros) and encountered Narud, who was Ouros's jailer. After a difficult battle Narud's forces were overpowered and Narud was cornered by not only Artanis Kerrigan and Raynor, but Alexei Stukov, who called him [...] "Duran." [...] He asked Duran if he remembered {{what he had done}} to him, and Narud assumed Stukov was simply there to gloat. Stukov said [...] "No, I'm <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> good night you son of a bitch." [...] (an echo of the words Duran had said right before shooting him). He then shot Narud with a psychic blast, finishing him for good.|$|E
500|$|Robson's autobiography, {{entitled}} Bobby Robson: Farewell but not Goodbye {{was released}} in 2005. The title is based {{on one of his}} quotes upon leaving the England job in 1990: [...] "I'm <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> goodbye—maybe not goodbye but farewell." [...] In the book, Robson was critical of Shepherd, claiming that while manager he was denied information regarding the players' contracts and transfer negotiations. He also criticised Shepherd and the club's deputy chairman Douglas Hall, for their focus on the first team and St James' Park, causing them to neglect less glamorous issues, such as the training ground, youth development and talent scouts. The club's training ground was later blamed by Graeme Souness, Robson's successor, for a series of injuries to first team players.|$|E

2500|$|Utah had {{its first}} {{sustained}} success when, in 1904, it hired Joe Maddock to coach football, {{as well as}} basketball and track. During his six seasons, he coached the football team to a record of 28–9–1 (.750). The school enthusiastically embraced the former Michigan Wolverine. In 1905, the Galveston Daily News reported, [...] "He has the Mormons all football crazy. He has written <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that his team now holds the championship of Utah, Montana, Wyoming, and {{the greater part of}} Colorado. When he won the hard-fought battle with Colorado College a week ago the Salt Lake City papers said: 'Maddock' is a new way of saying success. The great Michigan tackle has taken boys who never saw a football before and made them the star players of the Rocky Mountain States." [...] In early 1910, Maddock retired from coaching (although he later coached a year at Oregon.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Before the show, Madonna {{released}} pink wristbands to {{audience members}} {{in support of}} the LGBT community. In addition, hundreds brought rainbow flags to the show and waved them throughout. Madonna stopped {{in the middle of the}} show to speak on the issues at hand: [...] "...I feel that people are becoming more and more afraid of people who are different. People are becoming more and more intolerant, but we can make a difference...we don't have to do it with violence, but love." [...] She continued, noting Martin Luther King, Jr. as a fighter for the equal rights of African Americans, and stating, [...] "I am <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that the gay community and gay people here, and all around the world, have the same rights, to be treated with dignity, respect, tolerance, compassion, and love." [...] She then asked the audience to raise their wristbands with her to show their [...] "love and support of the gay community." [...] She concluded, [...] "for people quoting the Bible, and using God as a defense mechanism: Jesus, Muhammad, Buddha, and Moses preached this—it's in every Holy book—'love thy neighbor as thyself'. You can not use religion, or God's name, to treat other people badly. So let's go out into the world, and spread this message of love, and live our lives without fear. Amen." ...|$|E

And this answer does not help us, since we attach no sense <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>saying</b> that the lamp is half-on. I take this to mean {{that there is no}} established method for deciding what is done when a super-task is done. … We cannot be expected to pick up this idea, just because we have the idea of a task or tasks having been performed and because we are acquainted with transfinite numbers." ...|$|R

2500|$|Late in 2010, Nina {{revealed}} {{that she was}} recording a studio album set for release in mid-January 2011. It was originally set {{to be the first}} of her two-album recording deal with her new label, Universal Records. After a couple of push-backs, Stay Alive was finally released on November 19, 2011. In choosing such title for the album, she explained, [...] "It's like some people are saying that I'm gone [...] So I’m <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that I’m still here and staying alive." [...] She called the album [...] "special" [...] {{due to the fact that}} she contributed from its musical production to the cover art design." [...] Stay Alive was a universal acclaim, being called [...] "futuristic and edgy" [...] by critics who also predicted that it [...] "may set new trends in Filipino music," [...] tagging Nina as the new [...] "dance diva." [...] Philippine Entertainment Portal praised the album, stating [...] "Stay Alive is a testament to Nina's evolution as an artist and determination to be a better performer." [...] "Dance" [...] was released on October 6, 2011 as the lead single from the album. Nina explained, [...] "The carrier single is a dance song for it to be different from my previous albums." [...] The song is described as [...] "an upbeat track with a catchy melody." [...] Its music video was released on December 9, and features Nina in Gaga-ish costumes while performing a dance routine. Due to lack of promotion, the song failed to achieve commercial success. On January 30, 2012, [...] "However Much Love" [...] was released as a radio-only pre-Valentine single. The song was critically acclaimed, being called a [...] "standout" [...] by Abby Mendoza of Philippine Entertainment Portal. It also performed well commercially, becoming Nina's first chart-topper since 2008. On February 13, she staged a pre-Valentine concert entitled Update Your Status... at the Music Museum, which supported the album. In the same month, she expressed disappointment with the album's lack of promotion, saying [...] " [...] always have a meeting, but no actions are initiated. They give us schedules that are not really followed. When it's already okay, then they cancel it." [...] On April 14, she staged another concert at the Music Museum, entitled Timeless: Tribute to a Diva, which was dedicated to late pop diva Whitney Houston. [...] "Believe in the Dream" [...] was released on April 24, 2012 as the third single from Stay Alive, accompanied by a lyric video.|$|E
