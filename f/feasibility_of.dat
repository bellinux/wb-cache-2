5|$|Shortly {{before his}} death, {{when he was}} already quite ill, von Neumann headed the United States government's top secret ICBM committee, and it would {{sometimes}} meet in his home. Its purpose was {{to decide on the}} <b>feasibility</b> <b>of</b> building an ICBM large enough to carry a thermonuclear weapon. Von Neumann had long argued that while the technical obstacles were sizable, they could be overcome in time. The SM-65 Atlas passed its first fully functional test in 1959, two years after his death. The <b>feasibility</b> <b>of</b> an ICBM owed as much to improved, smaller warheads as it did to developments in rocketry, and his understanding of the former made his advice invaluable.|$|E

5|$|An {{expert system}} is a program that answers {{questions}} or solves problems about a specific domain of knowledge, using logical rules that are derived from the knowledge of experts. The earliest examples were developed by Edward Feigenbaum and his students. Dendral, begun in 1965, identified compounds from spectrometer readings. MYCIN, developed in 1972, diagnosed infectious blood diseases. They demonstrated the <b>feasibility</b> <b>of</b> the approach.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{its high}} {{resistance}} to P.cinnamomi dieback, the <b>feasibility</b> <b>of</b> using B.integrifolia as a rootstock for susceptible Banksia species in the cut flower trade is under investigation. Presently, the success rate for grafting is only 30–40%, and even with successful grafts {{there is a tendency}} for the union to fail under stress. More research is needed before the technique will be ready for commercial use.|$|E
5|$|From 1971 Texas Instruments {{had been}} making {{available}} the building block for a simple calculator on a single chip and the TMS0803 chipset appeared {{in a number of}} Sinclair calculators.

40|$|Conventionally, {{efforts of}} combating climate change mainly focus on {{reducing}} emissions at production sources, such as factories, offices or other organizational-based entities. While {{this approach has}} served its purposes for years, {{the environmental impacts of}} consumer goods, which cause cross-border carbon emission are very difficult to be managed. This study investigated the <b>feasibilities</b> <b>of</b> an alternative solution to combat climate change using the concept of product carbon footprint (PCF) labelling in Hong Kong. PCF describes the total set of greenhouse gases caused by a product over its whole life cycle, from raw material extraction to disposal. The concept of PCF is prevalent in regions such as Europe, Japan and Taiwan, where PCF information is shown as labels on products’ packaging to help consumers distinguish more eco-friendly products. These PCF labels, based on overseas pioneer experience, have shown enormous market potential and environmental benefits. Hong Kong has yet to establish such labelling system despite these benefits. The aim of the study is to investigate the <b>feasibilities</b> <b>of</b> introducing PCF labelling in Hong Kong and identify the opportunities and difficulties lie ahead. Five main types <b>of</b> <b>feasibilities,</b> namely technical, economic, legal, operational and scheduling feasibilities were considered in the study and in-depth review was carried out on each one. Literature review, questionnaire for general public and interviews with stakeholders were undertaken to understand existing PCF labelling schemes and obtain first-hand information from stakeholders of different perspectives. By analyzing the questionnaire and interview results, the study revealed that short-term <b>feasibilities</b> <b>of</b> introducing PCF labelling in Hong Kong is medium. Recommendations were made in accordance to each type <b>of</b> <b>feasibilities</b> to promote the wider adoption of PCF labelling in the future. published_or_final_versionEnvironmental ManagementMasterMaster of Science in Environmental Managemen...|$|R

After two months of negotiations, ALTBMD Programme Manager, General (Ret) Billard, and SAIC contracting Officer, Mr. Robert Larrick, signed the contract {{on the first day}} of NATO's Riga Summit. This decision was based on an unpublished report agreed upon earlier by NATO ministers following a study into the <b>feasibility</b> <b>of</b> theatre missile defences.|$|E
5|$|In {{parallel}} with the work on uranium {{was an effort to}} produce plutonium. After the <b>feasibility</b> <b>of</b> the world's first artificial nuclear reactor was demonstrated in Chicago at the Metallurgical Laboratory, it designed the X-10 Graphite Reactor at Oak Ridge and the production reactors in Hanford, Washington, in which uranium was irradiated and transmuted into plutonium. The plutonium was then chemically separated from the uranium. The Fat Man implosion-type weapon was developed in a concerted design and development effort by the Los Alamos Laboratory.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} week of August 1914, the German Foreign Office and members of the {{military}} suggested attempting to use the pan-Islamic movement to destabilise the British Empire and begin an Indian revolution. The argument was reinforced by Germanophile explorer Sven Hedin in Berlin two weeks later. General Staff memoranda in the last weeks of August confirmed the perceived <b>feasibility</b> <b>of</b> the plan, predicting that an invasion by Afghanistan could cause a revolution in India.|$|E

5|$|Military flights {{also used}} Fairbanks as a base. In 1920, {{the first flight}} from the {{continental}} United States to Alaska used Fairbanks as a base. In 1934, a flight of Martin B-10 bombers flew from Washington, D.C. to Fairbanks, ostensibly to demonstrate the <b>feasibility</b> <b>of</b> long-range bomber deployments. In reality, the bombers flew photographic missions intended to scout locations for military airfields {{to be built in}} the territory.|$|E
5|$|More unorthodox {{methods were}} also explored. Astrosystems International {{developed}} a so-called “Quartz Chamber” which burned pure oxygen and aircraft fuel, converting the chemical energy into light. The system was {{planned to be}} evaluated within a year, and installed in a similar arrangement to the more conventional BIAS. A plan, codenamed Moonshine, was also put forward. Moonshine {{was to be a}} joint effort with NASA to determine the <b>feasibility</b> <b>of</b> a geosynchronous satellite that could in project light directly down on any desired location.|$|E
5|$|On 3 December 1942, the USAAF {{sent out}} a Request for Proposals (RfP) for a {{diminutive}} piston-engined fighter. By January 1944, the Air Technical Service Command refined the RfP and in January1945, the specifications were further revised in MX-472 to specify a jet-powered aircraft. Although a number of aerospace companies studied the <b>feasibility</b> <b>of</b> such aircraft, McDonnell was the only company to submit a proposal to the original 1942 request and later revised requirements. The company's Model 27 proposal was completely reworked to meet the new specifications.|$|E
