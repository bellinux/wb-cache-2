This report, developed using the expertise of both the Australian Communications and Media Authority and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, {{discusses the}} availability of broadband, <b>fixed</b> <b>voice,</b> mobile voice and mobile data in the community. Key findings identified in the report include: * The number of broadband subscribers increased by 1. 1 million in the 12 months to June 2008. This increase was driven by growth in wireless broadband (47 per cent) and DSL provided on unbundled services (33 per cent). Unbundled services are the unbundled local loop service (ULLS) and the line sharing service (LSS). * Broadband connection speeds are rising with a 25 per cent increase in subscribers using a 1. 5 Mbps service, predominantly {{as a result of}} evolution from ADSL 1 to ADSL 2 + services. * Mobile services are evolving from second generation (2 G) to third generation (3 G) mobile with 8. 55 million 3 G services in operation at June 2008 (an increase of 88 per cent). * <b>Fixed</b> <b>voice</b> remains a large part of consumers? spend on communications services and the number of fixed lines remained stable in the year to June 2008 at 11 million fixed line services in operation. Alternatives to the standard telephone service (STS) for making <b>fixed</b> <b>voice</b> <b>calls</b> are emerging...|$|R
40|$|Telecommunications and ICT {{sector in}} general {{is one of the}} most rapidly growing sectors in the world. The state and level of the {{technological}} development of ICT infrastructure plays a very important and critical role in the growth and development of contemporary economies. Countries who do not have the required level and technology of ICT infrastructure are struggling to keep pace with the rapidly changing market economies and thus have difficulty in maintaining their competitive edge in the global market. In this paper, we examined whether network operators in Fiji’s Telecommunications market held SMP and thus have been abusing their market power to the detriment of the economy. Based on the analysis presented in the paper, we can consider the cumulative effect of all the factors analyzed justifies the conclusion that the three network operators in Fiji, that operate in the mobile and <b>fixed</b> line <b>voice</b> <b>call</b> termination markets, hold SMP in relation to those networks, and such SMP will in all likelihood be maintained in the short to medium term. Given the disparity in the market share, with VFL having 76 % of the market share in the mobile market and Digicel having 24 % of the market share and TFL having the smallest number of fixed line subscribers, it is quite likely that market power could be abused should there not be a Price Control Order...|$|R

40|$|In this study, we aim {{to analyse}} the {{relationship}} between various characteristics of a communication system with data and <b>voice</b> <b>call</b> requests. Queuing theory and Markov chain analysis are effectively used for this purpose. Such a study is useful for understanding how the proposed mathematical models behave which represents a system with integrated <b>voice</b> and data <b>calls</b> in homogenous wireless networks. We also propose to optimise the system characteristics {{in an attempt to}} provide better Quality of Service (QoS) for systems with integrated <b>voice</b> and data <b>calls.</b> The proposed models have two dimensions; one for <b>voice</b> <b>calls</b> and one for data calls. A channel is assigned for two input traffic <b>call,</b> namely, <b>voice</b> and data <b>calls.</b> The incoming <b>voice</b> and data <b>calls</b> are queued when the channel is busy. Since <b>voice</b> <b>calls</b> are delay-sensitive, priority is given to <b>voice</b> <b>calls.</b> Also, since there is only one channel, data calls are only serviced if there are no <b>voice</b> <b>calls</b> in the system. For such systems, it is important to analyse the impact of buffering the <b>voice</b> <b>calls</b> as well as data calls for various mean rates of call requests, and mean service times. The analytical models presented are generic which is applicable for various systems with similar characteristics. Numerical results are also provided. The results show that the proposed models can be used for optimisation of the performance of a given network...|$|R

30|$|On the one hand, the {{operator}} could {{be interested in}} a macrocell offload solution where macrocell data traffic hands over to femtocells (when possible) to increase network capacity. Hence, once the femtocell is full, the incoming <b>voice</b> <b>calls</b> that attempt to access are redirected to the macrocell, while the incoming data connections are accepted after handing over a <b>voice</b> traffic <b>call</b> to the macrocell. That situation could block many <b>voice</b> <b>calls</b> if the quality of the macrocell signal is poor. On the other hand, other operators could decide that femtocell deployments are aimed at enhancing the signal quality and extend the coverage at indoor environments where the macrocells present bad conditions (coverage holes, poor signal, etc.). According to this policy, {{the operator}} prefers that the <b>voice</b> <b>calls</b> are carried out through femtocells and data services hand over to the macrocell. The reason is related to the user point of view. Some operators consider that, once the femtocell is full, the client frustration is higher when a <b>voice</b> <b>call</b> is rejected than when he has no access to any other service. Therefore, the priority to accept an incoming <b>voice</b> <b>call</b> is higher than to accept data traffic. Consequently, those data connections hand over to the macrocell when an incoming <b>voice</b> <b>call</b> attempts to access a crowded femtocell. The impact of mobility failures on Voice over LTE (VoLTE) calls is discussed in the recent drive test presented in [10], where the handover failure rate (HFR) for pedestrian users is over 21  %, which is an unacceptable user experience for operators.|$|R
