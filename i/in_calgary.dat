5|$|As the Flames sank in the standings, their {{attendance}} also sagged. For most {{of their}} first 16 years <b>in</b> <b>Calgary,</b> Flames tickets were among the toughest {{to get in the}} NHL.

The fans responded by buying enough season tickets to keep the Flames <b>in</b> <b>Calgary</b> for the 1999â€“2000 season. The Flames issued another appeal for more season tickets in the summer of 2000. The campaign, aimed at increasing season ticket sales from a franchise low of 8,700 to 14,000, proved successful. The increased sales did not halt the Flames' financial losses, however, as the team estimated it lost $14.5million between 2001 and 2003.|$|E
