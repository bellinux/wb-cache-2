40|$|This thesis {{presents}} experimental {{measurements of}} fast electron energy transport made using optical probing, x-ray and XUV imaging techniques. Hydrodynamic and hybrid particlein- cell (PIC) simulations {{were used to}} interpret the results. Measurements of fast electron heating patterns were made using the Vulcan 100 Terawatt (TW) and Petawatt (PW) lasers. For the first (100 TW) experiment the laser power was increased from 10 TW to 70 TW and a transition was observed between collimated electron flow and an annular transport pattern. Hybrid modelling showed that a form of beam hollowing accounted for this. Using the PW laser, a comparison was made of different diagnostic techniques for measuring the fast electron beam divergence. Cu K-alpha and optical probing measurements {{were found to be}} consistent, with both measuring a divergence angle significantly larger than that measured before at lower intensities. Several different target geometries were used to investigate how energy coupling from the laser into the fast electron beam is affected by the presence of a laser <b>guide</b> <b>cone.</b> Using the Vulcan PW laser, a significant decrease in energy coupling was observed when using metallic cone-slab targets. The addition of a cone assembly to plastic I AI sandwich targets acted to reduce the fast electron heating pattern. Novel cone-wire target geometries revealed that heating of a cone-guided wire plasma is maximised close to the wire surface. Computational modelling revealed that this is due to enhanced Ohmic heating. Finally, measurements were made of the dependence of laser intensity on the fast electron beam divergence. Data taken at intensities relevant to fast ignition was combined with previous published measurements. It was found that the divergence angle increased with laser intensity and had little dependence on pulse duration. PIC modelling was performed to analyse the data and possible explanations for the intensity dependence are discussed. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|Pure Home Water (PHW) is a {{non-profit}} organization {{with the goal of}} providing safe drinking water through household water treatment and storage (HWTS) to the inhabitants of Ghana, particularly in the Northern Region. To this end, PHW has pursued the distribution and training {{in the use of the}} Kosim ceramic pot filter (CPF), and now wishes to pursue its manufacture. Laboratory studies have found the CPF to be between 97. 8 and 100 % efficient in the removal of E. coil bacteria. One of the main reasons for a household's discontinued use of the CPF is breakage. In a follow up monitoring of 1, 000 homes receiving CPFs after an emergency flood distribution in 2008, the rate of breakage was found to be 12 %. To address this critical problem, the author performed a three-point bending test on rectangular-prism clay samples with varying recipes and thicknesses in an attempt to determine bending strengths associated with the recipes with the aim of moderating the lip failure due to the possible failure mechanism of bending stress. Filter recipes were assigned numbers 1 through 14 based on combustible type, presence or absence of grog, combustible volume, and manufacturing process. The recipes which incorporated only fine, sieved combustible materials yielded the highest mean bending strengths. Statistically significant decreases in bending strength were realized with the increase of combustible mass. The inclusion of grog was generally found to have no statistically significant impact on the bending strength. Experimentally observed gains in bending strength with increased thickness supported theoretical strength gains with the square of the thickness. The variable of firing condition was found to be a significant but unquantifiable variable in the bending strength of the samples. In all cases, the lower bound of a 95 % confidence interval of the mean bending strength of the materials was found to exceed the expected bending stress on the filter lip due to predicted loading conditions. It is recommended that PHW pursue the manufacture of a fine-and-waste rice husk recipe with a 3 : 8 combustible-to-clay ratio without the inclusion of grog. It is recommended that the lip of the filter be thickened to 25 mm. It is recommended that pyrometric cones be placed in the spy-hole and door of the kiln during each firing and monitored once an hour until the <b>guide</b> <b>cone</b> bends, and once every fifteen minutes thereafter until the firing cone bends, at which time firing should cease. It is recommended that consultation with kiln designer Manny Hernandez be maintained so as to create even firing conditions within the kiln. by Travis Watters. Thesis (M. Eng.)

The hot electrons generated via the ultra-intense laser pulse and <b>guiding</b> <b>cone</b> interactions are measured after they pass through a dense plasma with a density of 50 - 100 g cm- 3 in a radius of 15 - 25 m. When significant neutron enhancements are achieved by the ultraintense laser pulse injection, the energy reduction of fast electrons is observed. Also, {{a reduction in the}} number of electrons with energy up to 15 MeV can be seen. We offer a new physical mechanism for the stopping of electrons, involving electron magnetohydrodynamic shock formation in the inhomogeneous plasma density region.

Robo/Slit loss-of-function mutations result in axons crossing the midline multiple times, whereas gain-of-function results in little to no midline crossing; consequently this interaction was determined to be important in preventing non-commissural axons from crossing the midline and commissural axons from recrossing.|$|R

40|$|Scanning Ion Conductance Microscopy (SICM) is a {{scanning}} probe microscopy particularly suitable for the investigation of living biological specimens due to its low invasivity. Recently, this technique has been used not only to perform 3 D-imaging but also to stimulate and <b>guide</b> neuronal growth <b>cones.</b> In particular it has been demonstrated that one can <b>guide</b> the <b>cone</b> growth for tens of micrometers by means of recurrent and noncontact SICM scanning along a defined line, with a pipette having an internal hydrostatic pressure.

Herein we describe a setup specifically developed for this purpose, combining together SICM, Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) and inverted optical microscopy. In our configuration, a SICM pipette can be approached to an AFM cantilever while monitoring the cantilever deflection {{as a function of}} the hydrostatic pressure applied to the pipette and the relative distance.

How this occurs is a critical question and must certainly involve signal transduction pathways. The paper by Suter and Forscher (2001) (this issue) begins to address how one such pathway, an Src family tyrosine kinase, enhances cytoskeletal linkage to apCAM, a permissive extracellular cue for Aplysia growth cones. Interestingly, they show that applied tension increases this kinase's localized phosphorylation that in turn further strengthens linkage.

During development, CSPGs act as guidance cues for developing growth <b>cones.</b> CSPGs <b>guide</b> growth <b>cones</b> through the use of negative signals, as seen by the fact that growing axons avoid CSPG dense areas. Tests done on embryonic roof plates, located on the dorsal midline of developing spinal cords, support this. CSPGs were found near and around the embryonic roof plates that inhibited axon elongation through the spinal cord, and directed the axons in another direction, but were absent in roof plates that attracted axon elongation. These results suggest that CSPGs act in neural development as an inhibitory signal to help guide growing axons.|$|R

Molecular gradients provide critical signals to <b>guide</b> growth <b>cones,</b> which are the motile tips of developing axons, to their targets. However, in vitro, growth cones trace highly stochastic trajectories, and exactly how molecular gradients bias their movement is unclear. Here, we introduce a mathematical model based on persistence, bias, and noise to describe this behaviour, constrained directly by measurements of the detailed statistics of growth cone movements in both attractive and repulsive gradients in a microfluidic device. This model provides a mathematical explanation for why average axon turning angles in gradients in vitro saturate very rapidly with time at relatively small values.

40|$|This work {{deals with}} some {{problems}} of constructing and graphical displaying {{for a class}} of kinematic surfaces generated by mutual moving ruled surfaces touching one another along their common ruling in each position [1, 2]. Exactly, {{we are dealing with}} the surfaces generated by movement of a cone fixed ruling during combined movement of the cone with respect to a torse surface [2]. The movement is defined as a cone rotating with simultaneous movement of the cone vortex along the torse edge-of-regression so that both surfaces, the torse and the cone, touch one another along the common ruling [3 - 5]. The methods and program modules developed allow using a wide range of curves as a torse edge-of-regression and a <b>cone</b> <b>guiding</b> line. Since the program modules are implemented using some numerical methods the application of a new-type curve is reduced to define the curve within the program module.

Growth cone advance was recorded in non-contact mode using a 2 % ion current decrease criterion for pipette-membrane distance control.

The new membrane protrusions, marked by DiI, started a few minutes after scanning onset and progressively grew in thickness. Using scanning patterns suitable for connecting distinct growth cones, new links were consistently developed. Although the underlying mechanism is still a matter for investigation, a mechanical perturbation produced by the moving probe appeared to induce the process formation.

40|$|The role of {{specific}} axonal tracts for {{the guidance of}} growth cones was investigated by examining axonal outgrowth within the abnormal brain tracts of zebrafish cyclops mutants. Normally, the earliest differentiating neurons in the zebrafish brain establish a simple scaffold of axonal tracts. Later-developing axons follow cell-specific pathways within this axonal scaffold. In Cyclops embryos, this scaffold is perturbed due to the deletion of some ventromedial neurons that establish parts of the axonal scaffold {{and the development of}} an abnormal crease in the brain. In these mutant embryos, the growth cones projected by the neurons of the nucleus of the posterior commissure (nur PC) are deprived of the two tracts of axons that they sequentially follow to first extend ventrally, then posteriorly. These growth cones respond to the abnormal scaffold in several interesting ways. First, nuc PC growth cones initially always extend ventrally as in wild-type embryos. This suggests that for the first portion of their pathway the axons they normally follow are not required for proper navigation. Second, approximately half of the nuc PC growth cones follow aberrant longitudinal pathways after the first portion of their pathway. This suggests that for the longitudinal portion of the pathway, specific growth cone/axon interactions are important for <b>guiding</b> growth <b>cones.</b> Third, although approximately half of the nuc PC growth cones follow aberrant longitudinal pathways, the rest follow normal pathways despite the absence of the axons that they normally follow. This suggests that cues independent of these axons may be capable of guiding nuc PC growth cones as well. These results suggest that different guidance cues or combinations of cues <b>guide</b> specific growth <b>cones</b> along different portions of their pathway. 1994 John Wiley & Sons, Inc...|$|R
40|$|Development of foam capsule {{fabrication}} for cryogenically cooled fuel targets is overviewed in {{the present}} paper. The fabrication development was initiated {{as a part of}} the Fast Ignition Realization Experiment (FIREX) Project at the ILE, Osaka University in the way of bilateral collaboration between Osaka University and National Institute for Fusion Science (NIFS). A foam cryogenic target was designed where low-density foam shells with a conical light guide will be cooled down to the cryogenic temperature and will be fueled through a narrow pipe. The required diameter and thickness of the capsule are 500 μm and 20 μm, respectively. The material should be low-density plastics foam. We have prepared such capsules using 1) mixtureing a new material of (phloroglucinolcarboxylic acid) /formalin (PF) linear polymer to control kinematic viscosity of the precursor, 2) phase-transfer-catalyzed gelation process to keep density matching of three phases of the emulsion. 3) non-volatile silicone oil as outer oil of emulsion in order to prevent hazard halogenated hydrocarbon and flammable mineral oil. The obtained foam capsule had fine structure of 180 nm (outer surface) to 220 nm (inner surface) and uniform thickness reaching to resolution limit of optical analysis (~ 0. 5 μm). A small hole was made before the solvent exchange and the drying process to prevent distortion due to volume changes. The density of dried foam was 0. 29 g/cm 3. After attaching the petawatt laser <b>guiding</b> <b>cone</b> and fueling glass tube, poly([2, 2]paracyclophane) was coated on the foam surface and supplied for a fueling test of cryogenic hydrogen. Generally, lower density is from larger pore, then precise control of thickness and its encapsulation becomes more difficult. We have clarified the relation between pore size and preparation conditions using several precursor materials, and revealed how to control pore size of low density foams, where the solvent affinity for the polymer chain plays fundamental role. By a gelation of PF solution and extraction to remove the organic solvent, PF aerogel was obtained to be 145 mg/cm^ 3. The pore size of the PF aerogel was less than 100 nm while that of previous RF/PF mixture was 200 - 500 nm. The SEM showed that PF had particle-like foam structure while RF had fibrous-like foam structure. ...|$|R

40|$|Bone morphogenic {{proteins}} (BMPs) {{are involved}} in axon pathfinding, but how they <b>guide</b> growth <b>cones</b> remains elusive. In this study, we report that a BMP 7 gradient elicits bidirectional turning responses from nerve growth cones by acting through LIM kinase (LIMK) and Slingshot (SSH) phosphatase to regulate actin-depolymerizing factor (ADF) /cofilin-mediated actin dynamics. Xenopus laevis growth cones from 4 – 8 -h cultured neurons are attracted to BMP 7 gradients but become repelled by BMP 7 after overnight culture. The attraction and repulsion are mediated by LIMK and SSH, respectively, which oppositely regulate the phosphorylation-dependent asymmetric activity of ADF/cofilin to control the actin dynamics and growth cone steering. The attraction to repulsion switching requires {{the expression of a}} transient receptor potential (TRP) channel TRPC 1 and involves Ca 2 + signaling through calcineurin phosphatase for SSH activation and growth cone repulsion. Together, we show that spatial regulation of ADF/cofilin activity controls the directional responses of the growth cone to BMP 7, and Ca 2 + influx through TRPC tilts the LIMK-SSH balance toward SSH-mediated repulsion...|$|R

50|$|Synaptogenesis is the {{formation}} of a synapse and in this case the Neuromuscular Junction is of interest. In this section, {{the focus is on the}} development of the NMJ from the outgrowth of axons during development. As mentioned in the development section, Schwann cell precursors accompany growing axons as they reach their associated muscles. It is now known that these PSC precursors are not essential to axonal growth, but when present they <b>guide</b> growth <b>cones</b> and help with the maintenance of NMJs after they are formed. After the initial nervous-muscle interface is formed, there is a striking growth in the number of PSCs at each newly developed NMJ. If, however, there is a lack of PSCs (for example in an ablated model) once the NMJ is formed, there is a lack of further axonal growth or even a retraction of axons can be observed. This is seen in a study on frog NMJs 8 and 12 days after ablation where there was a 44% retraction rate by the 12th day with no PSCs. This retraction shows that PSCs are not essential for the growth of axons, but are essential for the long-term maintenance of NMJs.|$|R

Following the formation of commissural tracts, Slit is found also in tracts of the commissures and longitudinal connectives, the purpose of which is not clear. The Slit protein is processed into a larger N-terminal peptide and a smaller C-terminal peptide. Here, I show that Slit and Slit-N in tracts interact with Robo to maintain the fasciculation, the inter-tract spacing between tracts and their position relative to the midline. Thus, in the absence of Slit in post-guidance tracts, tracts de-fasciculate, merge with one another and shift their position towards the midline. The Slit protein is proposed to function as a gradient. However, I show that Slit and Slit-N are not freely present in the extracellular milieu but associated with the extracellular matrix (ECM) and both interact with Robo 1. Slit-C is tightly associated with the ECM requiring collagenase treatment to release it, and it does not interact with Robo 1.

Spinal motor axons use Eph receptors to select a limb trajectory in response to trans ephrins, while expressing ephrins in cis. We show that changes in motor neuron ephrin expression result in trajectory selection defects mirrored by changes in growth cone sensitivity to ephrins in vitro, arguing for ephrin cis-attenuation of Eph function. Furthermore, the relative contribution of trans-signaling and cis-attenuation is influenced by the subcellular distribution of ephrins to membrane patches containing Eph receptors. Thus, growth cone ephrins are essential for axon guidance in vivo and the balance between cis and trans modes of axon guidance ligand-receptor interaction contributes to the diversity of axon guidance signaling responses...|$|R

To investigate how cell surface receptors translate guidance cue recognition into these cytoskeletal changes, we developed a novel in vitro assay where beads, coated with antibodies to the immunoglobulin superfamily cell adhesion molecule apCAM or with purified native apCAM, replaced cellular substrates. These beads associated with retrograde F-actin flow, but in contrast to previous studies, were then physically restrained with a microneedle to simulate interactions with noncompliant cellular substrates. After a latency period of ∼ 10 min, we observed an abrupt increase in bead-restraining tension accompanied by direct extension of the microtubule-rich central domain toward sites of apCAM bead binding. Most importantly, we found that retrograde F-actin flow was attenuated only after restraining tension had increased and only in the bead interaction axis where preferential microtubule extension occurred. These cytoskeletal and structural changes {{are very similar to}} those reported for growth cone interactions with physiological targets. Immunolocalization using an antibody against the cytoplasmic domain of apCAM revealed accumulation of the transmembrane isoform of apCAM around bead-binding sites. Our results provide direct evidence for a mechanical continuum from apCAM bead substrates through the peripheral domain to the central cytoplasmic domain. By modulating functional linkage to the underlying actin cytoskeleton, cell surface receptors such as apCAM appear to enable the application of tensioning forces to extracellular substrates, providing a mechanism for transducing retrograde flow into <b>guided</b> growth <b>cone</b> movement...|$|R
40|$|Gradients of {{topographic}} cues play essential roles in the {{organization of}} sensory systems by <b>guiding</b> axonal growth <b>cones.</b> Little {{is known about}} whether there are additional mechanisms for precise topographic mapping of synaptic connections. Whereas the C.  elegans DA 8 and DA 9 neurons have similar axonal trajectories, their synapses are positioned in distinct but adjacent domains in the anterior-posterior axis. We found that two Wnts, LIN- 44 and EGL- 20, are responsible for this spatial organization of synapses. Both Wnts form putative posterior-high, anterior-low gradients. The posteriorly expressed LIN- 44 inhibits synapse formation in both DA 9 and DA 8, and creates a synapse-free domain on both axons via LIN- 17 /Frizzled. EGL- 20, a more anteriorly expressed Wnt, inhibits synapse formation through MIG- 1 /Frizzled, which is expressed in DA 8 but not in DA 9. The Wnt-Frizzled specificity and selective Frizzled expression dictate the stereotyped, topographic positioning of synapses between these two neurons...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: The {{benefit in}} terms of higher {{accuracy}} for full guided implant surgery (template based guided cavity preparation and guided implant insertion) compared with half-guided surgery (template based guided cavity preparation and free-handed, manual implant insertion) has not been proved till now. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 38 identical implants were inserted into five human cadaver jaws, after virtual implant planning with the coDiagnostiX() device. All cavities were drilled using templates equipped with tubes for guidance. At random, 19 implants were inserted in a free handed way (half-guided), whereas 19 implants were inserted in a guided way through the templates tubes (full <b>guided).</b> Postoperative <b>cone</b> beam computer tomographies (CBCT) were performed, and based on image fusion the total deviations between the virtual implant positions at the implants base and tip were determined and compared between both implantation modi. RESULTS: The mean difference in accuracy between both implantation modalities at the implants bases was 0. 72 mm (range: 0. 16 - 1. 17 mm, SD: 0. 45). The mean difference in accuracy between both modalities at the implants tips was 0. 46 mm (range: 0. 16 - 1. 23 mm. SD: 0. 49). Although full guided implantation showed a generally higher accuracy (mean tip: 1. 54 mm, range: 0. 33 - 3. 64 mm; mean base: 1. 52 mm, range: 0. 4 - 3. 54 mm) than half-guided implantation (mean tip: 1. 84 mm, range: 0. 84 - 3. 22 mm; mean base: 1. 56 mm, range: 0. 49 - 3. 43 mm), the differences were not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: The accuracy of half-guided implant surgery is comparable with full guided implant surgery...|$|R
40|$|Neurons of {{the nucleus}} of the {{posterior}} commissure (nuc PC), an identifiable cluster of neurons in the embryonic zebrafish brain, project growth cones ventrally along the posterior commissure to the anterior tegmentum where the PC intersects two longitudinal tracts, the tract of the postoptic commissure (TPOC) and the medial longitu-dinal fasciculus (MLF). Once at the intersection, nuc PC growth cones turn posteriorly onto the TPOC in the dorsal tegmentum and follow it to the hindbrain. Previ-ously we showed that {{in the absence of the}} TPOC, nuc P C growth cones often extended along aberrant path-ways suggesting that fasciculation, that is, contact with TPOC axons is an important factor in <b>guiding</b> growth <b>cones</b> along their normal pathway. However, a signifi-cant number of nuc P C growth cones also followed their normal pathway suggesting that cues associated with the dorsolateral tegmentum, independent of the TPOC, can also guide nuc PC growth cones. We have now confirmed using electron microscopy that nuc PC growth cones fa-sciculate with axons in the TPOC. In the absence of the TPOC, the nuc P C growth cones that extend along their normal pathway do so in contact with dorsolateral neuro-epithelial cells. This suggests that cues associated with these cells can also guide the nuc PC growth cones. Fur-thermore, in the absence of the TPOC axons, these growth cones now inappropriately turn onto axons that normally intersect the TPOC near the border of the mid-brain and hindbrain, that is, a t a second intersection of tracts. This suggests that fasciculation with TPOC axons may also guide nuc P C growth cones in this second regio...|$|R
