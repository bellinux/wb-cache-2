Due to its’ weight and size this system is particularly well suited for operations in the vicinity of wind turbines. To qualify for full scale measurements in turbine wakes the system has been characterized by several laboratory and field tests described in this study. A wind tunnel test against a hot-wire anemometer shows the capability of the 5 -hole probe to react to turbulence {{in the same manner as}} the <b>hot-wire</b> <b>system.</b> The resulting spectra from the two platforms show in general good agreement for both laminar and turbulent flows. The 5 -hole probe system is able to resolve turbulence up to frequencies around 20 − 30 Hz when using a tubing length of 15 cm between the probe and the pressure transducers. In addition, an environmental parallel test against to two sonic anemometers mounted on the roof-top of a car was performed at Bergen airport Flesland. Despite several issues with the self-made and low-cost experimental setup, important system characteristics could be tested and verified. In particular the velocity spectral components of the sonic anemometer system and the 5 -hole probe are in close resemblance to each other.

40|$|This work {{is devoted}} {{to the study of the}} {{influence}} of the freestream turbulence intensity (FST) on a pre-transitional boundary layer formed on a flat plate. The FST was generated using a passive turbulence-generating grid, in a low-medium speed wind tunnel, and the data were recorded using a <b>hot-wire</b> <b>system.</b> The receptivity is investigated by means of various mathematical tools, which comprehend statistical analysis as well as spectral decomposition. An analytical approach has also been proposed in order to address the influence of the fluctuating components on the skin friction coefficient and the integral quantities. Furthermore, statistics from the pre-transitional boundary layer are analysed and reveal self-similar behaviour. The main characteristic is represented by the so-called Klebanoff modes, in the form of elongated positive and negative streaks and a method to estimate the length of the streaks is given. It is also demonstrated that, when normalised, the length of the positive streaks grows with the same rate of the negative streaks. In the frequency domain, this study has highlighted the importance of some frequencies and their different evolution. The strong dissipation found in proximity of the leading edge is responsible for destabilising the shear layer, while the downstream decay of the FST appears to have no major impact on the evolving disturbances and no significant dissipation is noticeable at the boundary layer edge, as an interaction of FST and negative streaks: this may support the idea that the transition process is initiated within the boundary layer. A frequency window, where the energy content shows no appreciable variations of the energy content, has been found and this seems to be appropriate to allow a feeding mechanism of the internal disturbances...|$|E

40|$|The {{prediction}} of noise generated by turbulent flows {{is dependent upon}} knowledge of the spatial coherence of the turbulence. This has traditionally been quantified using the cross correlation function, which gives a correlation length that is typically used in noise prediction models. More recently [1], {{the use of the}} frequency domain parameters of coherence and phase {{have been shown to be}} more relevant to the development of reliable prediction methods for noise generation as these give information on both the correlation length and the local convection speed as a function of frequency. The use of hot-wire anemometry for quantifying these parameters is problematical especially at the small turbulent scales where the size of the probes can significantly alter the local characteristics. Laser Doppler anemometry offers an alternative that is non-intrusive but has inherent problems associated with the intermittent data acquisition so that the errors associated with the use of two LDA systems can result again in very poor resolution at high frequencies. A compromise is to use LDA together with a <b>hot-wire</b> <b>system</b> with the former located upstream so that the intrusive effect of the hot-wire is minimised. This paper reports the application of this approach to the measurements of spatial coherence in turbulent flows with narrow and broadband characteristics. A two component DANTEC LDA system based on an F 50 BSA processor is used in conjunction with a single hot-wire probe. Procedures for the analysis of the LDA and hot-wire data are developed and corrections for inherent errors associated with the intermittent acquisition of the LDA are given.

For instance, the investigation of exhaust gases from single or coaxial nozzles or from bleed valve in turbojets and turbofan engines is crucial for understanding the mechanisms of noise generation and propagation and eventually for finding ways to reduce aircraft noise. This article evaluates the velocity and acoustic fields of an isothermal single jet discharging from a circular 38. 1 mm conical nozzle at three different Mach and Reynolds numbers of 0. 25 (Re = 2. 5 105), 0. 50 (Re = 4. 9 105) and 0. 75 (Re = 6. 8 105), respectively.

40|$|The Turbine Branch {{concentrates}} on the following areas: Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), and implementing experimental procedures to obtain physical modeling data. Hot-wire Anemometry is a valuable tool for obtaining physical modeling data. Hot-wire Anemometry {{is likely to remain}} the principal research tool for most turbulent air/gas flow studies. The Hot-wire anemometer consists of a fine wire heated by electric current. When placed in a fluid stream, the hot-wire loses heat to the fluid by forced convection. In forced convection, energy transfer is due to molecular motion imposed by an extraneous force moving fluid parcels. When the hot-wire is in "equilibrium", the rate of heat input to the wire is equal to the rate of heat loss at the wire ends. The equality between heat input and heat loss is the basis for King s equation, which relates the electrical parameters of the hot-wire to the flow parameters of the fluid. Hot-wire anemometry is based on convective heat transfer from a heated wire element placed in a fluid flow. Any change in the fluid flow condition that affects the heat transfer from the heated element will be detected virtually instantaneously by a constant-temperature <b>Hot-wire</b> anemometry <b>system.</b> The system implemented for this research is the IFA 300. The system is a fully-integrated, thermal anemometer-based system that measures mean and fluctuating velocity components in air, water, and other fluids. It also measures turbulence and makes localized temperature measurements. A constant-temperature anemometer is a bridge and amplifier circuit that controls a tiny wire at constant temperature. As a fluid flow passes over the heated sensor, the amplifier senses the bridge off-balance and adjusts the voltage {{to the top of the}} bridge, keeping the bridge in balance. The voltage on top of the bridge can then be related to the velocity of the flow. The bridge voltage is sensitive to temperature as well as velocity and so the built-in thermocouple circuit can be attached to a thermocouple that can measure the fluid temperature.

The study began with an extension of constant-temperature thermal anemometry techniques to a Mach 11 helium flow, including careful examinations of <b>hot-wire</b> construction techniques, <b>system</b> response, and system calibration. This was followed by the application of these techniques to the exploration of a Mach 11 helium turbulent boundary layer (To approximately 290 K). The data that was acquired over the course of more than two years consists of instantaneous streamwise mass flux measurements at a frequency response of about 500 kHz. The data are of exceptional quality in both the time and frequency domain and possess a high degree of repeatability. The data analysis that has been performed to date has added significantly to the body of knowledge on hypersonic turbulence, and the data reduction is continuing. An attempt was then made to extend these thermal anemometry techniques to higher enthalpy flows, starting with a Mach 6 air flow with a stagnation temperature just above that needed to prevent liquefaction (To approximately 475 F). Conventional hot-wire anemometry proved to be inadequate for the selected high-temperature, high dynamic pressure flow, with frequent wire breakage and poor system frequency response. The use of hot-film anemometry has since been investigated for these higher-enthalpy, severe environment flows. The difficulty with using hot-film probes for dynamic (turbulence) measurements is associated with construction limitations and conduction of heat into the film substrate. Work continues under a NASA GSRP grant on the development of a hot film probe that overcomes these shortcomings for hypersonic flows. Each of the research tasks performed during the NASA Langley research grants is discussed separately below...|$|R
