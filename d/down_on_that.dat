25|$|During the Laotian Civil War {{portion of}} the Second Indochina War, Central Intelligence Agency spies in the Kingdom of Laos {{infiltrated}} the Ho Chi Minh Trail from the west to install wiretaps on Vietnamese communist telephone lines as early as 1966. The North Vietnamese clamped <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> effort with daily patrols checking for tampering along their phone lines on the Trail. By 1971, with Vietnamization winding down American resources in the Vietnam War, the American need for intelligence was greater than ever. The CIA's counter was to target a phone line deep within North Vietnam. Aerial photography disclosed a possible site for a tap 24 kilometers southwest of Vinh. A complex of military phone lines had been installed over a precipitous hill in a remote location; the communist patrols circled that hill without a close inspection of the lines on the summit. However, emplacing a tap at that location would entail crossing the heavily defended Trail and penetrating deep into North Vietnam.|$|E

500|$|The {{decision}} sparked {{much controversy}} about {{the scope of}} the mandatory detention laws.

The executive director of the Sydney Institute, Gerard Henderson, said that the case demonstrated [...] "the need for empathy in public policy".|$|E

500|$|The {{environmental}} conditions {{leading up to}} the April 2011 Super Outbreak were among the [...] "most conducive to violent tornadoes ever documented". On April25, a vigorous upper-level shortwave trough moved into the Southern Plains states. Ample instability, low-level moisture, and wind shear fueled a significant tornado outbreak from Texas to Tennessee; at least 64tornadoes touched down that same day. An area of low pressure consolidated over Texas on April26 and traveled east while the aforementioned shortwave trough traversed the Mississippi River and Ohio River valleys. Another 50tornadoes touched <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> day. The multi-day outbreak culminated on April27 with the most violent recorded day of tornadic activity since the 1974 Super Outbreak. Multiple episodes of tornadic activity ensued with two waves of mesoscale convective systems in the morning hours, followed by a widespread outbreak of supercells from Mississippi to North Carolina during the afternoon into the evening.|$|E
2500|$|Steele {{never saw}} a {{complete}} screenplay for the film. Instead, she was simply handed the scenes she would play, and her dialogue, every morning of the production.

2500|$|The state dam between Cohoes and Waterford, located {{where the}} sprouts {{exit from the}} main channel of the Mohawk River, was rebuilt [...] east (downstream) of the old dam in 1868. Both the {{original}} and the new dam were for the original path of the Champlain Canal, allowing the canal boats to cross the Mohawk River to the canal channel {{on the other side}} in place of using an aqueduct bridge over the river.

2500|$|In December 2007 a 15-month, $5.5 {{million project}} was {{completed}} to add fourth (or [...] "operational") lanes {{in each direction}} between the entrances and exits at Exits 10 and 11 in Darien. An earlier project added a fourth lane on the southbound side from the entrance at Exit 10 to Exit 8. After that lane was added, a state Department of Transportation study concluded that accidents were <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> stretch of the highway by 20 percent, amounting to about 160 fewer accidents per year. Construction of operational lanes at exits 11, 12, and 13 was expected to begin in the late spring of 2008.|$|E

Typically, a human’s center of mass is detected with one of two methods: The reaction board method is a static analysis that involves the person lying <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> instrument, and use of their static equilibrium equation to find their center of mass; the segmentation method relies on a mathematical solution based on the physical principle that the summation of the torques of individual body sections, relative to a specified axis, must equal the torque of the whole system that constitutes the body, measured relative to the same axis.|$|E

2500|$|The {{more optimistic}} Vanderbilt {{faithful}} were excited {{at the prospect}} of end Scotty Neill reporting after a year's layoff. [...] His ability at punting the ball was especially noted. [...] The Commodores' lone advantage going into the game was their speed, perhaps not unlike today when teams play Southern schools. During the pregame talk in his dressing room, Coach McGugin famously said [...] "You are going against Yankees, some of whose grandfathers killed your grandfathers in the Civil War." [...] Also reported, probably more accurately, as [...] "Out there lie the bones of your grandfathers;" [...] referring to a nearby military cemetery, [...] "And <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> field are the grandsons of the Yankee soldiers who put them there."

2500|$|By this point, Imperial {{knew they}} had hit upon a strike. The company pressed Hunter to name a date when the well could come in. He later stated: [...] "The crew and I were experts at abandoning wells but we didn't know much about {{completing}} them. [...] I named February 13 and started praying." [...] Imperial invited the public to witness as the well came in. However, the machinery broke <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> morning. [...] The crew worked {{most of the day}} trying to fix the machinery, while some of guests began to leave, fearing another disappointment. Shortly before 4 p.m., the crew finally cleared the wellhead and the 500 people who remained despite the bitter cold bore witness Leduc No. 1 came to life. [...] People felt a rumbling in the ground, while roughnecks opened release valves. [...] The youngest member of the crew was given the honour of [...] "flaring" [...] the well. [...] As the mixture of crude oil and gas spewed from a release pipe, the young man hurled a burning sack onto the mixture, igniting the fuel and sending flames [...] into the air. [...] Imperial held a party in Edmonton that night in celebration of its achievement.|$|E
