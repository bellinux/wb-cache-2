He first {{learned of the}} film after meeting with Lee: [...] "He said {{he wanted me to}} read the script and see if I wanted to be involved. Spike asks so many people to come back and work with him in {{different}} capacities and as different types of characters." ...|$|E
500|$|The Monster {{comes down}} the steps after killing Karl on the rooftop and sees his mate (Elsa Lanchester). The excited Monster reaches out to her, asking, [...] "Friend?" [...] The Bride, screaming, rejects him. [...] "She <b>hate</b> <b>me!</b> Like others" [...] the Monster dejectedly says. As Elizabeth races to Henry's side, the Monster rampages through the laboratory. The Monster tells Henry and Elizabeth [...] "Yes! Go! You live!" [...] To Pretorius and the Bride, he says [...] "You stay. We belong dead." [...] While Henry and Elizabeth flee, the Monster sheds a tear and pulls a lever to trigger the {{destruction}} of the laboratory and tower.|$|E

500|$|... "Black Widow" [...] {{is a song}} {{which runs}} for a {{duration}} of three minutes and 29 seconds and {{has been described as}} a song that [...] "channels more trap music with its beat". The song combines a sparse snap and heavy trap beat with a refrain that follows a slow-building, clapping chorus formula which peaks but deliberately never capitalizes. Instrumentally, [...] "Black Widow" [...] is composed of an ominous steel drum rhythm, and heavy bass, while its dance breakdown is employed with minimalism. Azalea solicits the track's verses with a snarling, bitter technique, consisting of rhyming employed with a spitting delivery. While Ora uses a seething element to sing the track's hook, [...] "I'm gonna love ya, until you <b>hate</b> <b>me</b> / And I'm gonna show ya, what's really crazy / You should've known better, than to mess with me harder / I'm gonna love you, I'm gonna love you / Gonna love you, gonna love you / Like a black widow baby". Combined, Ora and Azalea's vocals are based on a call and response structure throughout the song.|$|E
500|$|... "If U Seek Amy" [...] {{runs through}} a dance-oriented beat and {{features}} many instruments, including keyboards, snare, bass drums, electric guitars and timpani. According to the sheet music published at musicnotes.com by Hal Leonard Corporation, the song has a beat of 130 {{beats per minute}} and is written in the key of A minor. Spears's vocal range spans from G3-C5. In the song, Spears seems {{to be looking for}} a woman named Amy in a club. It has been suggested that Amy is either Amy Winehouse or an alter ego of Spears herself. The verses end with the hookline [...] "Hahahehehahaho", which, according to Poppy Cossins of The Sun, is fitting to [...] "the album's [...] overtone". The chorus begins with the lines [...] "Love me, <b>hate</b> <b>me</b> / Say what you want about me", a reference to the public's perception and fascination with Spears' life. This presents Spears both as [...] "an object of desire and a punching bag". According to Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph, this line also alludes to the public image of British singer Amy Winehouse.|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, [...] "Black Widow" [...] {{is a dark}} {{love song}} which deals with the {{subjects}} of revenge and feminism in a failed romantic relationship. According to Nedeska Alexis of MTV Buzzworthy, the song [...] "captures the fallout when love turns sour" [...] and is clarified in the lyric [...] "I'm gonna love ya until you <b>hate</b> <b>me</b> / And now I'm gonna show ya what's really crazy". Digital Spy's Emily Mackay denoted the lyrical content in [...] "Black Widow" [...] to contain a theme of [...] "dark, dangerous sexuality" [...] and felt it owned [...] "the bunnyboiler femme fatale stereotype". Nick Aveling of Time Out summarized the track's theme as [...] "boy-baiting drama". The song's beat, hook and production formula garnered many comparisons to Perry's single [...] "Dark Horse" [...] (2013). While Tshepo Mokoena of The Guardian felt [...] "Black Widow" [...] was sonically reminiscent of Azalea's previous collborations with American disc jockeys Diplo and Steve Aoki, and Craig Mathieson of The Sydney Morning Herald likened the song {{to the music of}} Beyoncé.|$|E

500|$|Matthew Libatique {{served as}} cinematographer, having {{previously}} collaborated with Lee on the films She <b>Hate</b> <b>Me</b> (2004) and Inside Man (2006). Libatique {{relied on the}} use of natural light, which proved challenging for scenes shot indoors. The final battle sequence in the film was especially difficult as the film relied {{on the use of}} practical effects and difficult weather conditions. Libatique's solution was to collaborate with Lee, military advisor Billy Budd, and first assistant director Mike Ellis in creating storyboards to choreograph the scenes. Production designer Tonino Zera was tasked with filling outdoor locations with greenery, rebuilding exteriors and constructing the interior of an Italian barn. Costume designer Carlo Poggiolo consulted with a former Buffalo Soldier of the 92nd Division, prior to designing the American soldiers' outfits. He also provided [...] contemporary and historical wardrobe pieces. Ernest Dickerson served as the film's second unit director, cinematographer, and camera operator. The visual effects were created by George Lucas' Industrial Light & Magic (ILM). After Lee approached him, Lucas allowed ILM's team of artists to work on the visual effects for the film.|$|E
500|$|Whereas Part I {{begins with}} a trumpet announcing ("") God's glory, Part II starts on an {{intimate}} chamber music scale with oboe d'amore and viola da gamba, concentrating on [...] "brotherly devotion" [...] (...) [...] A sinfonia in E minor for these two instruments is reminiscent both of Bach's compositions for the court in Köthen and of a French overture, marked [...] "adagio", then [...] "vivace". Bach used the music of this movement later in his organ trio, BWV 528. Gardiner calls the movement [...] "in effect a sonata da chiesa". The tenor aria illustrates the [...] "masochistic" [...] "Hate me, then, <b>hate</b> <b>me</b> with all your might, o hostile race!" [...] by a first dissonant entry on an ostinato bass line full of chromatic, leaps and interrupting rests. Oboe d'amore and viola da gamba return to accompany the last aria, and [...] "the sombre qualities of both voice and instruments create a feeling of peace and introspection". The music of the closing chorale is identical to that of Part I.|$|E
500|$|From {{the very}} {{beginning}} of the series, fans had expressed dislike towards the character of Duncan. However, he decided to keep playing the character. In a later interview, he said, [...] "Obviously, I acted because I wanted the fans to like the experience. You want your performance to be liked. You don't want to suck. You don't want people to think you suck. That wasn't the goal." [...] Towards the end of the airing of the first season, he stated, [...] "I'm going to be there in every episode next season if we get a second season. So people will either continue to <b>hate</b> <b>me</b> or things will change. Things are going to change for Duncan anyway, as the season resolves. There are going to be different sides of him that you're going to get to see." [...] Before going into the filming of season two, Thomas had told Dunn that he was being written off the show, and Dunn did not react badly to the news, as by that point, it [...] "was actually a decision" [...] for him to return for the second season at all.|$|E
6000|$|... "He hates me," [...] said Mrs. Travers, {{and frowned}} at d'Alcacer's {{incipient}} smile. [...] "It isn't a delusion on my part. The worst {{is that he}} <b>hates</b> <b>me</b> not for myself. I believe he is completely indifferent to my existence. Jorgenson <b>hates</b> <b>me</b> because as it were I represent you two who are in danger, because it is you two that are the trouble and I [...] . Well!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am going}} to be an awful rotter," [...] he said. [...] "I suppose I ought to take your answer to my {{question}} as final. I won't that's all. He came along first but that isn't everything. It's a fair fight between him and <b>me.</b> He <b>hates</b> <b>me</b> and takes no pains to hide it. He <b>hates</b> <b>me</b> because I care for you--you know that. I couldn't keep it to myself even if I would." ...|$|R

500|$|On 16 March 2011, judge Kyle Sandilands {{announced}} on his breakfast radio show, Kyle & Jackie O {{that he would}} not be returning to the judging panel for the third season. Of his decision, Sandilands said, [...] "Not because I didn't like it. I thought the show was great and it was great fun to do but it's just too hectic, it's too much work. So, I've told Channel Seven, no." [...] On 31 March 2011, it was announced that Natalie Bassingthwaighte would join the judging panel as a replacement for Natalie Imbruglia. When speaking of her role as a judge, Bassingthwaighte said she would focus on bringing an honest critique to the show and would guide [...] "the artists through the competition". In late April 2011, it was confirmed that Mel B would be Sandilands' replacement. Mel B said, [...] " [...] are either going to love me or <b>hate</b> <b>me</b> but it's going to be a fun ride. I'm really easy to get on with and I'm a hard worker. I'm firm but nice." [...] Guy Sebastian and Ronan Keating were the only judges from the second season who returned.|$|E

2500|$|In failing health, Lange {{retired from}} Parliament before the 1996 general election. In his valedictory speech, he {{reflected}} on the pain caused by his government's economic reforms: [...] "I want to thank those people whose lives were wrecked by us. They had been taught for years they {{had the right to}} an endless treadmill of prosperity and assurance, and we did them. People over 60 <b>hate</b> <b>me.</b> They <b>hate</b> <b>me</b> because I was the symbol of what caused that assurance of support and security to be shattered. That is something that has always been part of my burden." [...] His Labour Party colleague Taito Phillip Field succeeded him as the member for the Mangere electorate.|$|E

[...] Sondheim and Prince's collaboration was suspended from Merrily to the 2003 production of Bounce, another failure.|$|E
2500|$|Of the controversy, Steinbeck wrote, [...] "The vilification of me {{out here}} from the large landowners and bankers is pretty bad. The latest is a rumor started by them that the Okies <b>hate</b> <b>me</b> and have {{threatened}} to kill me for lying about them. I'm frightened at the rolling might of this damned thing. It is completely out of hand; I mean a kind of hysteria about the book is growing that is not healthy." ...|$|E

Late in 1987 he resumed The Someloves with Mather and in September 1988 they issued a second single, [...] "Know You Now". By 1989 the pair were joined by Zupanovich, Martin Moon (ex-Marigolds) on drums and Tony Italiano on bass guitar.|$|E
2500|$|Dimitri Tiomkin {{had written}} [...] "Death Telegram" [...] and [...] "Gower's Deliverance" [...] for the {{drugstore}} scenes, {{but in the}} editing room Capra elected to go with no music for those scenes. Those changes, along with others, led to a falling out between Tiomkin and Capra. Tiomkin had worked {{on a lot of}} Capra's previous films, and was saddened that Capra decided to have the music pared or toned down, moved, or cut entirely. He felt as though his work was being seen as a mere suggestion. In his autobiography Please Don't <b>Hate</b> <b>Me,</b> he said of the incident, [...] "an all around scissors job".|$|E
