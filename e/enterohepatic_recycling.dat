40|$|SummarySystemic {{bile acid}} (BA) {{homeostasis}} {{is a critical}} determinant of dietary fat digestion, enterohepatic function, and postprandial thermogenesis. However, major checkpoints for the dynamics and the molecular regulation of BA homeostasis remain unknown. Here we show that hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis impairment in humans and liver-specific deficiency of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) in mice disrupts the normal changes in systemic BA distribution during the fasted-to-fed transition. Fasted mice with hepatocyte-specific GR knockdown had smaller gallbladder BA content and were more susceptible to developing cholesterol gallstones when fed a cholesterol-rich diet. Hepatic GR deficiency impaired liver BA uptake/transport via lower expression of the major hepatocyte basolateral BA transporter, Na+-taurocholate transport protein (Ntcp/Slc 10 a 1), which affected dietary fat absorption and brown adipose tissue activation. Our results demonstrate a role of the HPA axis in the endocrine regulation of BA homeostasis through the liver GR control of <b>enterohepatic</b> BA <b>recycling...</b>|$|R

30|$|A recent model, {{developed}} by Lin et al. (2004), predicts far greater liver folate storage capacity than reported by Herbert. Due to <b>enterohepatic</b> <b>recycling,</b> the actual size of liver folate storage will significantly affect the time taken for {{the onset of}} folate deficiency following commencement of folate deprivation. Lin found that his model predicted body stores of folate to be nearly five times greater than previously published and that these stores would last for hundreds of days when on a folate-deficient diet.|$|E
30|$|Of crucial {{importance}} to this entire gastrointestinal absorption {{process is the}} <b>enterohepatic</b> <b>recycling</b> of the vitamin B 12, shown in Fig.  3 as the transfer of HoloHC from the liver to the duodenum, in the bile. This recycling is not only essential for the efficient maintenance of the body store of vitamin B 12; it is {{the means by which}} the serum concentration of HoloTC is regulated. The rate of transfer to the duodenum of HoloHC in bile, and the IF from the parietal cells, controls the rate of HoloTC production.|$|E
30|$|Lin’s model (Lin et al. 2004), showing {{far greater}} liver folate storage {{capacity}} than reported by Herbert, offers a reasonable explanation; the liver folate store can last {{far longer than}} 120  days. By means of <b>enterohepatic</b> <b>recycling,</b> the red-cell folate level is maintained until the liver stores are exhausted. This recycling of folate, with a large liver store, would explain the initial 300  day delay before many analytes changed significantly from their baseline concentrations, {{as well as the}} greater than 230  days then required to totally deplete the red-cell folate.|$|E
30|$|Even {{if there}} were no ethical {{objections}} to the performance of such an experiment, it would be of limited value. This is because a pure dietary vitamin B 12 deficiency, induced for the purpose of the experiment, would not necessarily produce the same effect on HoloTC as would other causes of deficiency such as malabsorption. In dietary deficiency, <b>enterohepatic</b> <b>recycling</b> tends to maintain the HoloTC concentration until the liver store of vitamin B 12 is exhausted; when deficiency develops due to the onset of severe malabsorption, the recycling would become ineffective and produce a faster reduction in HoloTC concentration because it has a very short half-life in serum. (Herbert 1994).|$|E
40|$|<b>Enterohepatic</b> <b>recycling</b> occurs by biliary {{excretion}} and intestinal reabsorption of a solute, sometimes with hepatic conjugation and intestinal deconjugation. Cycling is {{often associated with}} multiple peaks and a longer apparent half-life in a plasma concentration-time profile. Factors affecting {{biliary excretion}} include drug characteristics (chemical structure, polarity and molecular size), transport across sinusoidal plasma membrane and canniculae membranes, biotransformation and possible reabsorption from intrahepatic bile ductules. Intestinal reabsorption to complete the enterohepatic cycle may depend on hydrolysis of a drug conjugate by gut bacteria. Bioavailability is also affected by the extent of intestinal absorption, gut-wall P-glycoprotein efflux and gut-wall metabolism. Recently, there has been a considerable increase in our understanding of the role of transporters, of gene expression of intestinal and hepatic enzymes, and of hepatic zonation. Drugs, disease and genetics may result in induced or inhibited activity of transporters and metabolising enzymes. Reduced expression of one transporter, for example hepatic canalicular multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP) 2, {{is often associated with}} enhanced expression of others, for example the usually quiescent basolateral efflux MRP 3, to limit hepatic toxicity. In addition, physiologically relevant pharmacokinetic models, which describe enterohepatic recirculation in terms of its determinants (such as sporadic gall bladder emptying), have been developed. In general, enterohepatic recirculation may prolong the pharmacological effect of certain drugs and drug metabolites. Of particular importance is the potential amplifying effect of enterohepatic variability in defining differences in the bioavailability, apparent volume of distribution and clearance of a given compound.

Treatment with the antibiotic significantly increased the excretion of faecal conjugated oestrogens, which parallelled {{a decrease in}} urinary oestrogen excretion, especially of E 3. The effect on urinary E 3 could be explained almost entirely by the simultaneous decrease of urinary E 3 - 3 G concentrations. In urine and faeces the E 2 /E 3 and E 1 + E 2 /E 3 ratios increased, probably because of the diminished reductive metabolism of oestrogens in the gut. No significant effects on plasma unconjugated oestrogen concentrations were observed. Moreover, {{in the present study}} oxytetracycline had no remarkable effect on plasma total, or free T concentrations, nor on other plasma hormones measured. Our results suggest that <b>enterohepatic</b> <b>recycling</b> and intestinal metabolism of oestrogens may be significant in men. The mechanism of action of antibiotics on oestrogen metabolism probably involves decreased hydrolysis by beta-glucuronidase of oestrogen conjugates by the intestinal contents, diminishing the reabsorption of aglycones of oestrogen conjugates and resulting in faecal loss of the steroids...|$|E
30|$|If {{any one of}} the {{elements}} of this feedback control system suddenly fails entirely, the <b>enterohepatic</b> <b>recycling</b> will stop immediately, and no HoloTC will be produced; for example, if the supply of intrinsic factor or production of bile suddenly stops or if the terminal ileum or duodenum are removed. Under these circumstances, Herbert’s hypothesis would be expected to hold true in one respect; the fall in HoloTC would be an early indicator of a vitamin B 12 deficiency. The HoloHC has a far longer half-life than the HoloTC in serum, and there is a large store of vitamin B 12 in the liver and red-cells, so HoloHC would fall much more slowly than HoloTC.|$|E
30|$|Herbert’s hypothesis, that HoloTC {{will respond}} early to vitamin B 12 depletion, before {{the onset of}} a {{clinical}} deficiency, is erroneous because it {{does not take into account}} how <b>enterohepatic</b> <b>recycling</b> regulates the HoloTC concentration.

When the cause of vitamin B 12 deficiency does disrupt the enterohepatic cycle, the HoloTC will be an early responder but there will be no Depletion period; the metabolites will respond quickly when HoloTC falls below normal for the individual.|$|E

Blood samples (0, 30, 120 min) were taken at days 3, 10, week 4, months 3, 6 and 12 for determination of MPA, MPAG and AcMPAG. MPA-AUC was estimated using validated algorithms. Two hour AUCs were calculated for MPAG and AcMPAG. Immunosuppressive therapy consisted of CsA/MMF (n = 110) and of TCL/MMF (n = 180). In 70 / 290 (24 %) patients 86 episodes of diarrhoea were recorded during 12 months. Significantly more patients on TCL (31. 1 %) suffered from diarrhea compared to CsA (12. 7 %). MMF dose, MPA-AUC and the 2 h AUCs of MPAG and AcMPAG did not differ between patients with and without diarrhoea. Plasma AcMPAG and MPAG concentrations were substantially higher in patients on CsA compared with TCL, while MPA-AUC was lower in the former group.

In contrast to rutin, {{a high proportion}} of quercetin (two-thirds) disappeared during perfusion, reflecting extensive transfer into the intestinal wall. Net quercetin absorption was not complete (2. 1 nmol/min), inasmuch as 52 % were reexcreted in the lumen as conjugated derivatives (7. 7 nmol/min). <b>Enterohepatic</b> <b>recycling</b> contribution of flavonoids was excluded by catheterization of the biliary duct before perfusion. After a 30 -min perfusion period, 0. 71 µM of quercetin equivalents were detected in plasma, reflecting a significant absorption from the small intestine. The differential hydrolysis of effluent samples by glucuronidase and/or sulfatase indicates that the conjugated forms released in the lumen were 1) glucuronidated derivatives of quercetin and of its methoxylated forms (64 %) and 2) sulfated form of quercetin (36 %). In vitro quercetin glucuronides synthetized using jejunal and ileal microsomal fractions were similar to those recovered in the effluent of perfusion. These data suggest that glucuronidation and sulfatation take place in intestinal cells, whereas no glucurono-sulfoconjugates could be detected in the effluent.

Biliary and serum bile acids were measured before and during treatment by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and by high performance liquid chromatography. During tauroursodeoxycholate administration, the proportion of total ursodeoxycholate in bile reached mean (SEM) 34. 4 (4. 5) %, 32. 8 (2. 8) %, and 41. 6 (3. 0) % with doses of 500, 1000, and 1500 mg/day, respectively.

The glycine/taurine ratio of the biliary bile acid pool decreased from 1. 9 at baseline, to 1. 1 with the highest dose. Ursodeoxycholate in bile was conjugated with glycine and taurine, indicating that tauroursodeoxycholate undergoes significant deconjugation and reconjugation during its <b>enterohepatic</b> <b>recycling.</b> The proportion of lithocholate in bile remained unchanged. Fasting serum conjugated ursodeoxycholate concentration positively correlated with the tauroursodeoxycholate dose, and the increased proportion of ursodeoxycholate was accompanied by substantial decreases in the endogenous bile acids. Compared with previously published data for ursodeoxycholic acid therapy, these findings indicate that the shift toward a more hydrophilic bile acid pool is greater and potentially more favourable with tauroursodeoxycholate, and this is because of the reduced intestinal biotransformation of tauroursodeoxycholate...|$|E
40|$|Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), the prodrug of {{mycophenolic acid}} (MPA), is {{included}} in current combination immunosuppressive reg-imens following organ transplant.

The present study dem-onstrated that female rats {{are more susceptible to}} MMF-induced GI toxicity than male rats. Female Sprague-Dawley rats treated chronically with an oral dose of 50 mg of MPA equivalents/kg/day experienced greater GI toxicity than male rats, as measured by diarrhea grade and weight loss. Intestinal microsomes harvested from the upper jejunum of female rats had approximately 3 -fold lower MPA glucuronidation rates compared with male rats. In the remaining areas of the small and large intestine, there was also a trend toward decreased glucuronidation in the female rats. The area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) for MPA following an oral dose of 50 mg of MPA equivalents/kg was roughly similar between genders, whereas the AUC for mycophenolic acid phenolic glucuronide (MPAG) was significantly lower in female rats. Female rats also excreted half of the biliary MPAG as male rats. The greater susceptibility of female rats to MMF-induced gastrointestinal toxicity, despite diminished intestinal MPA expo-sure via reduced biliary excretion of MPAG, may result from re-duced protection of enterocytes by in situ glucuronidation. Like-wise, susceptibility to MMF-induced GI toxicity in humans may also result from variable intestinal glucuronidation due to UDP glucu-ronosyltransferase polymorphisms or differential expression...|$|E

The purpose of this current work was to explore, for the first time, the disposition of abouthiouzine following intravenous and oral administration using an animal model; also, to study its plasma protein binding properties. Abouthiouzine (2 mg/kg intravenously) was administered to healthy male Vole rabbits and Beagle dogs. A dose of 20 mg/kg of the drug was also given orally to another group of Beagle dogs. Abouthiouzine plasma concentrations were measured using an HPLC method, and its pharmacokinetic parameters were determined by non-compartmental analysis. Abouthiouzine plasma protein binding was determined using an ultrafiltration technique. The drug was quickly eliminated from the rabbit and dog systemic circulations with terminal half-lives (T- 1 / 2 lambda) of 0. 7 h and 1. 9 h, respectively. The calculated T- 1 / 2 lambda following the oral administration in dogs was 1. 8 h. Total abouthiouzine clearance (CL) in rabbits was 7. 84 +/- 0. 87 ml/min/kg, and 4. 03 +/- 0. 83 ml/min/kg in dogs. The apparent volume of distribution at steady state (V-ss) in rabbits and dogs was 360. 09 +/- 63. 41 ml/kg and 481. 10 +/- 62. 64 ml/kg, respectively. The absolute oral bioavailability in dogs was similar to 16 %, which may indicate poor absorption characteristics of the pure drug and/or an extensive first past effect.

40|$|Abstract Background To {{examine the}} effects on LDL {{cholesterol}} of the combined use of statins and phytosterols/-stanols, in vivo studies and clinical trials are necessary. However, for a better interpretation of the experimental data {{as well as to}} possibly predict cholesterol levels given a certain dosing regimen of statins and phytosterols/-stanols a more theoretically based approach is helpful. This study aims to construct a mathematical model to simulate reductions in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in persons who combine the use of statins with a high intake of phytosterols/-stanols, e. g. by the use of functional foods. Methods and Results The proposed model includes the cholesterol pool size in the liver and serum levels of very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol. Both an additional and a multiplicative effect of phytosterol/-stanol intake on LDL cholesterol reduction were predicted from the model. The additional effect relates to the decrease of dietary cholesterol uptake reduction, the multiplicative effect relates to the decrease in <b>enterohepatic</b> <b>recycling</b> efficiency, causing increased cholesterol elimination through bile. From the model, it was demonstrated that a daily intake of 2 g phytosterols/-stanols reduces LDL cholesterol level by about 8 % to 9 % on top of the reduction resulting from statin use. The additional decrease in LDL cholesterol caused by phytosterol/-stanol use at the recommended level of 2 g/d appeared to be similar or even greater than the decrease achieved by doubling the statin dose. Conclusion We proposed a simplified mathematical model to simulate the reduction in LDL cholesterol after separate and combined intake of statins and functional foods acting on intestinal (re) absorption of cholesterol or bile acids in humans. In future work, this model can be extended to include more complex (regulatory) mechanisms. </p...|$|E
40|$|International audienceWhile bile acids (BAs) {{have long}} been known to be {{essential}} in dietary lipid absorption and cholesterol catabolism, in recent years an important role for BAs as signalling molecules has emerged. BAs activate mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways, are ligands for the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) TGR 5 and activate nuclear hormone receptors such as farnesoid X receptor alpha (FXR-alpha; NR 1 H 4). FXR-alpha regulates the <b>enterohepatic</b> <b>recycling</b> and biosynthesis of BAs by controlling the expression of genes such as the short heterodimer partner (SHP; NR 0 B 2) that inhibits the activity of other nuclear receptors. The FXR-alpha-mediated SHP induction also underlies the downregulation of the hepatic fatty acid and triglyceride biosynthesis and very-low-density lipoprotein production mediated by sterol-regulatory-element-binding protein 1 c. This indicates that BAs {{might be able to}} function beyond the control of BA homeostasis as general metabolic integrators. Here we show that the administration of BAs to mice increases energy expenditure in brown adipose tissue, preventing obesity and resistance to insulin. This novel metabolic effect of BAs is critically dependent on induction of the cyclic-AMP-dependent thyroid hormone activating enzyme type 2 iodothyronine deiodinase (D 2) because it is lost in D 2 -/- mice. Treatment of brown adipocytes and human skeletal myocytes with BA increases D 2 activity and oxygen consumption. These effects are independent of FXR-alpha, and instead are mediated by increased cAMP production that stems from the binding of BAs with the G-protein-coupled receptor TGR 5. In both rodents and humans, the most thermogenically important tissues are specifically targeted by this mechanism because they coexpress D 2 and TGR 5. The BA-TGR 5 -cAMP-D 2 signalling pathway is therefore a crucial mechanism for fine-tuning energy homeostasis that can be targeted to improve metabolic control...|$|E

There is no parenteral formulation. Several assay methodologies have been developed, but high performance liquid chromatography {{has been the}} most used in recent pharmacokinetic studies. These have shown in healthy volunteers that mefloquine is absorbed with a half-life of 1 to 4 hours and a time to peak concentration of 7 to 24 hours (median 16. 7 hours). Mean peak blood concentrations have ranged between 50 and 110 (median 83) ng/ml/mg/kg. Estimates of total apparent volume of distribution (Vd/f) have ranged from 13. 3 to 40. 9 (median 19. 2) L/kg, systemic clearance (CL/f) from 0. 022 to 0. 073 L/h/kg (median 0. 026 L/h/kg), and terminal elimination half-life from 13. 8 to 40. 9 days (median 20 days). Systemic clearance appears to be increased in late pregnancy. In uncomplicated falciparum malaria, peak blood concentrations are 2 to 3 times higher than those in healthy subjects ranging from 112 to 209 (median 144) ng/ml/mg/kg because of contraction in the total apparent volume of distribution.

Serial blood samples were obtained over 24 h. Samples were analyzed for amprenavir and fit to a compartmental model using ADAPT II software, with all relevant parameters conditional with respect to bioavailability. The model accommodated secondary peaks by incorporating clearance out of the central compartment with delayed instantaneous release back into the gut compartment. The data were weighted by the inverse of the estimated measurement error variance; model discrimination was determined using Akaike's Information Criteria. A total of 76 subjects were evaluable in the study analysis. The data were best fit by a two-compartment model, with 98. 7 % of the subjects demonstrating a secondary peak. Amprenavir had a mean total clearance of 1. 163 liters/h/kg of body weight (0. 7), a central volume of distribution of 1. 208 liters/kg (0. 8), a peripheral volume of distribution of 8. 2 liters/kg (0. 81), and distributional clearance of 0. 04 liters/h/kg (0. 81).

Our aim was to elucidate the adaptation of the interposed ileum, which we hypothesized, would lead to early bile acid reabsorption in the interposed ileum, thus short circuiting enterohepatic bile acid recycling to more proximal bowel segments. Rats with diet-induced obesity were randomized to IIS, with 10 cm of ileum repositioned distal to the duodenum, or sham surgery. A subgroup of sham rats was pair-fed to IIS rats. Physiological parameters were measured until 6 wk postsurgery. IIS rats ate less and lost more weight for the first 2 wk postsurgery. At study completion, body weights were not different, but IIS rats had reversed components of the metabolic syndrome. The interposed ileal segment adapted to a more jejunum-like villi length, mucosal surface area, and GATA 4 /ILBP mRNA. The interposed segment retained capacity for bile acid reabsorption and anorectic hormone secretion {{with the presence of}} ASBT and glucagon-like-peptide- 1 -positive cells in the villi. IIS rats had reduced primary bile acid levels in the proximal intestinal tract and higher primary bile acid levels in the serum, suggesting an early and efficient reabsorption of primary bile acids.

There was decreased hepatic Cyp 27 A 1 mRNA with no changes in hepatic FXR, SHP, or NTCP expression. IIS protects against the metabolic syndrome through short-circuiting enterohepatic bile acid recycling.

This indicates that BAs {{might be able to}} function beyond the control of BA homeostasis as general metabolic integrators. Here we show that the administration of BAs to mice increases energy expenditure in brown adipose tissue, preventing obesity and resistance to insulin. This novel metabolic effect of BAs is critically dependent on induction of the cyclic-AMP-dependent thyroid hormone activating enzyme type 2 iodothyronine deiodinase (D 2) because it is lost in D 2 -/- mice. Treatment of brown adipocytes and human skeletal myocytes with BA increases D 2 activity and oxygen consumption. These effects are independent of FXR-alpha, and instead are mediated by increased cAMP production that stems from the binding of BAs with the G-protein-coupled receptor TGR 5. In both rodents and humans, the most thermogenically important tissues are specifically targeted by this mechanism because they coexpress D 2 and TGR 5.

40|$|Modelling {{approach}} to simulate reductions in LDL cholesterol levels after combined intake of statins and phytosterols/-stanols in humans Simone RBM Eussen 1, 2, Cathy JM Rompelberg 2 *, Olaf H Klungel 1 and Jan CH van Eijkeren 2 Background: To {{examine the effects}} on LDL cholesterol of the combined use of statins and phytosterols/-stanols, in vivo studies and clinical trials are necessary. However, for a better interpretation of the experimental data {{as well as to}} possibly predict cholesterol levels given a certain dosing regimen of statins and phytosterols/-stanols a more theoretically based approach is helpful. This study aims to construct a mathematical model to simulate reductions in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in persons who combine the use of statins with a high intake of phytosterols/-stanols, e. g. by the use of functional foods. Methods and Results: The proposed model includes the cholesterol pool size in the liver and serum levels of very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol. Both an additional and a multiplicative effect of phytosterol/-stanol intake on LDL cholesterol reduction were predicted from the model. The additional effect relates to the decrease of dietary cholesterol uptake reduction, the multiplicative effect relates to the decrease in <b>enterohepatic</b> <b>recycling</b> efficiency, causing increased cholesterol elimination through bile. From the model, it was demonstrated that a daily intake of 2 g phytosterols/-stanols reduces LDL cholesterol level by about 8 % to 9 % on top of the reduction resulting from statin use. The additional decrease in LDL cholesterol caused by phytosterol/-stanol use at the recommended level of 2 g/d appeared to be similar or even greater than the decrease achieved by doubling the statin dose. Conclusion: We proposed a simplified mathematical model to simulate the reduction in LDL cholesterol after separate and combined intake of statins and functional foods acting on intestinal (re) absorption of cholesterol or bile acids in humans. In future work, this model can be extended to include more complex (regulatory) mechanisms...|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} to determine mechanisms involved in absorption of Tipophilic xenobiotics and to define factors which may alter their bioavailabilities. First examined were the in vitro partitions of 3 hydrocarbon carcinogens, 7, 12 -dimethylbenz(a) anthracene (DMBA), 3 -methylcholanthrene and benzo(a) pyrene and one polychlorinated biphenyl compound, between an emulsified oil phase and a mixed micellar solution simulating intestinal content. Nearly identical behaviours were {{exhibited by the}} 4 hydrocarbons whose solubilization was directly dependent upon the formation of bile salt micelles. Solubilization was enhanced by increasing concentrations of bile salt, reduction of triglyceride concentration {{and the formation of}} mixed rather than pure bile salt micelles. Micelles containing long-chain fatty acid and monoglyceride were better able than medium-chain lipid mixed micelles to solubilize the hydrocarbons. The second part of the study examined intraluminal factors which might alter hydrocarbon bioavailability in vivo. Conscious, restrained rats were administered ³H-DMBA in various lipid test meals via duodenal cannulae. Subsequent biliary excretion or plasma levels of radiolabel were monitored using common bile duct or tail arterial catheters. In the absence of luminal bile, DMBA was absorbed from triglyceride vehicles to an appreciable extent. Luminal bile replacement did not influence radiolabel recovery from the medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) but dramatically enhanced it from long-chain triglycerides(LCT) whether mono- or polyunsaturated. With luminal bile present, plasma levels and biliary recovery were significantly greater from both LCTs than from the MCT carrier. In a 6. hour study period, plasma levels of radiolabel were inversely related to the volume of triolein carrier. Rats receiving intraduodenal infusions of ³H-DMBA biliary products subsequently eliminated 33 % of the dose in their bile within 24 hours. In rats with lymphatic fistulae, biliary radiolabel excretion was used as an indirect index of hydrocarbon. Increasing doses of radiolabel were administered then relative lymphatic and biliary radiolabel recoveries were monitored. Despite a 2000 -fold variation in dose (10 μq vs 20 mg) total recoveries as percentage administered were similar. Although some degree of increased lymphatic transport was evident with increasing DMBA burden, at least 75 % of absorbed radiolabel was transported in portal blood. This study demonstrates that conditions favouring micellar solubilization of hydrocarbon in the intestinal lumen produce greatest bioavailabilities. Portal transport accounts for the major route of hydrocarbon (or derivative) transport following ingestion with the lymphatic system playing only an auxiliary role. 0 nce in the body, the compound is efficiently excreted in the bile and extensive <b>enterohepatic</b> <b>recycling</b> ensues...|$|E
40|$|This review aims {{to provide}} an {{extensive}} overview {{of the literature on}} the clinical pharmacokinetics of mycophenolate in solid organ transplantation and a briefer summary of current pharmacodynamic information. Strategies are suggested for further optimisation of mycophenolate therapy and areas where additional research is warranted are highlighted. Mycophenolate has gained widespread acceptance as the antimetabolite immunosuppressant of choice in organ transplant regimens. Mycophenolic acid (MPA) is the active drug moiety. Currently, two mycophenolate compounds are available, mycophenolate mofetil and enteric-coated (EC) mycophenolate sodium. MPA is a potent, selective and reversible inhibitor of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH), leading to eventual arrest of T- and B-lymphocyte proliferation. Mycophenolate mofetil and EC-mycophenolate sodium are essentially completely hydrolysed to MPA by esterases in the gut wall, blood, liver and tissue. Oral bioavailability of MPA, subsequent to mycophenolate mofetil administration, ranges from 80. 7 % to 94 %. EC-mycophenolate sodium has an absolute bioavailability of MPA of approximately 72 %. MPA binds 97 - 99 % to serum albumin in patients with normal renal and liver function. It is metabolised in the liver, gastrointestinal tract and kidney by uridine diphosphate gluconosyltransferases (UGTs). 7 -O-MPA-glucuronide (MPAG) is the major metabolite of MPA. MPAG is usually present in the plasma at 20 - to 100 -fold higher concentrations than MPA, but it is not pharmacologically active. At least three minor metabolites are also formed, of which an acyl-glucuronide has pharmacological potency comparable to MPA. MPAG is excreted into the urine via active tubular secretion and into the bile by multi-drug resistance protein 2 (MRP- 2). MPAG is de-conjugated back to MPA by gut bacteria and then reabsorbed in the colon. Mycophenolate mofetil and EC-mycophenolate sodium display linear pharmacokinetics. Following mycophenolate mofetil administration, MPA maximum concentration usually occurs in 1 - 2 hours. EC-mycophenolate sodium exhibits a median lag time in absorption of MPA from 0. 25 to 1. 25 hours. A secondary peak in the concentration-time profile of MPA, due to enterohepatic recirculation, often appears 6 - 12 hours after dosing. This contributes approximately 40 % to the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC). The mean elimination half-life of MPA ranges from 9 to 17 hours. MPA displays large between- and within-subject pharmacokinetic variability. Dose-normalised MPA AUC can vary more than 10 -fold. Total MPA concentrations should be interpreted with caution in patients with severe renal impairment, liver disease and hypoalbuminaemia. In such individuals, MPA and MPAG plasma protein binding may be altered, changing the fraction of free MPA available. Apparent oral clearance (CL/F) of total MPA appears to increase in proportion to the increased free fraction, with a reduction in total MPA AUC. However, there may be little change in the MPA free concentration. Ciclosporin inhibits biliary excretion of MPAG by MRP- 2, reducing enterohepatic recirculation of MPA. Exposure to MPA when mycophenolate mofetil is given in combination with ciclosporin is approximately 30 - 40 % lower than when given alone or with tacrolimus or sirolimus. High dosages of corticosteroids may induce expression of UGT, reducing exposure to MPA. Other co-medications can interfere with the absorption, <b>enterohepatic</b> <b>recycling</b> and metabolism of mycophenolate. Most pharmacokinetic investigations of MPA have involved mycophenolate mofetil rather than EC-mycophenolate sodium therapy. In population pharmacokinetic studies, MPA CL/F in adults ranges from 14. 1 to 34. 9 L/h (ciclosporin co-therapy) and from 11. 9 to 25. 4 L/h (tacrolimus co-therapy). Patient bodyweight, serum albumin concentration and immunosuppressant co-therapy have a significant influence on CL/F. The majority of pharmacodynamic data on MPA have been obtained in patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil therapy in the first year after kidney transplantation. Low MPA AUC is associated with increased incidence of biopsy-proven acute rejection. Gastrointestinal adverse events may be dose related. Leukopenia and anaemia have been associated with high MPA AUC, trough concentration and metabolite concentrations in some, but not all, studies. High free MPA exposure has been identified as a risk factor for leukopenia in some investigations. Targeting a total MPA AUC from 0 to 12 hours (AUC(12)) of 30 - 60 mg center dot hr/L is likely to minimise the risk of acute rejection and may reduce toxicity. IMPDH monitoring is in the early experimental stage. Individualisation of mycophenolate therapy should lead to improved patient outcomes. MPA AUC(12) appears to be the most useful exposure measure for such individualisation. Limited sampling strategies and Bayesian forecasting are practical means of estimating MPA AUC(12) without full concentration-time profiling. Target concentration intervention may be particularly useful in the first few months post-transplant and prior to major changes in anti-rejection therapy. In patients with impaired renal or hepatic function or hypoalbuminaemia, free drug measurement could be valuable in further interpretation of MPA exposure...|$|E
40|$|Alterations in {{glucocorticoid}} (GC) biosynthesis and metabolism {{are associated}} with a variety of pathophysiological disorders including cholestasis, diabetes and other metabolic disorders. Bile acids (BA) are also important modulators of metabolic functions and regulate cholesterol, triglyceride and glucose homeostasis as well as being critical for dietary fat digestion, enterohepatic function, and postprandial thermogenesis. In intact cells and in vivo, the 11 β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11 β-HSD 1) enzyme converts inactive GC precursors (cortisone in humans, and 11 -dehydrocorticosterone in mice and rats) into their active forms (cortisol and corticosterone, respectively) thereby amplifying local intracellular GC levels. Interconversion by 11 β-HSD 1 of other sterols has also been described. These include conversions of 7 keto-cholesterol to 7 β-hydroxycholesterol, 7 -oxodehydroepiandrosterone (7 -oxo-DHEA) to 7 α-hydroxy- and 7 β-hydroxy DHEA, 7 - oxo-lithocholic acid (LCA, a bile acid; BA) to chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA, a 7 α- hydroxylated BA) and ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA, a 7 β-hydroxylated BA) in human liver microsomes. In the liver, BA inhibit 11 β-HSD 1 but whether 11 β-HSD 1 regulates BA homeostasis is unclear. Evidence of molecular regulation of the <b>enterohepatic</b> <b>recycling</b> of bile acids by liver glucocorticoid receptor (GR) in mice does suggest a role for 11 β-HSD 1. It was therefore hypothesised that disruption of 11 β-HSD 1 expression in mice would impair BA recycling and might affect the relative concentrations of BA within the enterohepatic circuit. The primary objective of the current work was to investigate the impact of altered 11 β-HSD 1 on BA homeostasis. This was achieved using genetically modified mouse models with altered 11 β-HSD 1 expression, either globally or restricted to hepatocytes. BA are stored in the gall bladder and are released postprandially, to aid digestion. It was hypothesised that 11 β-HSD 1 deficiency might the affect the process of postprandial gall bladder emptying/refilling. Mice with global 11 β-HSD 1 knockout (Hsd 11 b 1 -/-) and age-matched control mice (C 57 Bl/ 6) were either fasted for 4 h and culled or fasted for 4 h and re-fed for another 4 h before culling. Their response to fasting and re-feeding was assessed with specific focus on organs associated with BA recycling in the enterohepatic circuit (liver, gall bladder, serum and small intestine). Gall bladders of fasted Hsd 11 b 1 -/- and C 57 Bl/ 6 mice had similar volumes of bile but in fasted Hsd 11 b 1 -/- mice, BA concentrations were higher in serum and liver. As expected, re-feeding caused gall bladder emptying in C 57 Bl/ 6 mice with consequent increased serum and liver bile acid concentrations. In Hsd 11 b 1 -/- mice, the gall bladder did not empty and serum and liver BA concentrations were similar to the fasted state. To explore possible reasons for this, levels of mRNA encoding proteins known to be involved in hepatic BA transport were quantified using real-time q-PCR. Levels of mRNA encoding NTCP/ SCL 10 A 1 / SCL 10 A 1, the transporter responsible for most hepatocyte BA uptake, were increased in livers of fasted Hsd 11 b 1 -/- mice whereas levels of Slc 51 b mRNA, encoding the OST- transporter that facilitates BA removal from liver to the systemic circulation, and levels of Mrp 2 and Atp 8 b 1 /FIC 1 mRNAs (both encoding proteins which transport BA from liver into gall bladder) were decreased. This suggests that in fasted Hsd 11 b 1 -/- mice, BA transporter expression is altered to increase BA influx into hepatocytes and decrease efflux, to compensate for reduced levels of liver BA. These data together imply that bile acid recycling is controlled by 11 β-HSD 1 activity which regulates gall bladder emptying, hepatic BA concentration and BA transporter activity to ensure continuity of BA recycling within the enterohepatic circuit compartments. These changes may also affect digestion of lipids and fat-soluble micronutrients. Because 11 β-HSD 1 can directly metabolise secondary BA, it was predicted that 11 β-HSD 1 deficiency would lead to changes in the BA profile. Profiling of BA in the gall bladder was performed using mass spectrophotometry. In Hsd 11 b 1 -/- mice, 7 α-hydroxylated BA predominated (cholic acid [CA]>α-muricholic acid [α- MCA]>CDCA>others), in contrast to C 57 Bl/ 6 mice in which 7 β-hydroxylated BA predominated (ω-MCA>β-MCA>UDCA>others). The ratio of 7 α: 7 β acids was therefore > 100 -fold greater in Hsd 11 b 1 -/- mice. This suggests that 11 β-HSD 1 either directly or indirectly controls the epimerisation of 7 α- to 7 β- hydroxylated BAs. Measurement of mRNAs encoding proteins important for hepatic BA biosynthesis in livers of fasted Hsd 11 b 1 -/- mice showed decreased expression of Scarb 1 /SR-B 1, Cyp 39 a 1 and Cyp 27 a 1 (though with no change in levels of CDCA, the product of CYP 27 A 1, in liver or bile fluid), compared to fasted control mice. Hepatic levels of Gpbar 1 /TGR 5 /GPBAR 1 and Cyp 3 a 11 mRNAs, encoding proteins important in BA detoxification, were increased and decreased, respectively. This suggests that Gpbar 1 /TGR 5 /GPBAR 1, encoding G-protein coupled bile acid receptor (also called TGR 5 /GPBAR 1) and an FXR target, could be induced to detoxify 7 α-hydroxylated BA whereas expression of Cyp 3 a 11, which catalyses the conversion of LCA to hyodeoxycholic acid (HDCA) is decreased; bile fluid of Hsd 11 b 1 -/- mice contained lower levels of LCA and little to no HDCA, though LCA and HDCA levels in liver were unaltered. Currently, the functional differences between 7 α- and 7 β- hydroxylated BA are not clear. However, these findings could have significant implications for bile acid-mediated transcription which, in turn, might affect lipid and sterol metabolism. Also, alterations in BA composition may have other physiological consequences via other pathways. Because cholesterol is the precursor of BA synthesis, it was hypothesised that western diet (WD) (containing cholesterol) would exacerbate and/or alter the phenotype of Hsd 11 b 1 -/- mice. Gall bladder weights of fasted Hsd 11 b 1 -/- and control C 57 Bl/ 6 mice did not change with western diet compared to chow diet. In control C 57 Bl/ 6 mice, the total BA concentration in the gall bladder increased in response to WD in comparison to chow diet. In contrast, Hsd 11 b 1 -/- mice showed no change in total BA concentration when fed on WD in comparison to chow. These data indicate that 11 β-HSD 1 is required by mice for the normal increase in total BA concentration in bile in response to dietary cholesterol. BA profiling of bile from control mice fed on WD showed no difference in the relative amounts of 7 β-hydroxylated BA and 7 α-hydroxylated BA to littermates fed on chow diet with the exception of β–MCA which increased, and α–MCA which decreased. Like chow-fed Hsd 11 b 1 -/- mice, BA profiling of bile from WD-fed Hsd 11 b 1 -/- mice showed a significant decrease in relative levels of 7 β-hydroxylated BA (UDCAα-MCA>CDCA>others) compared to C 57 Bl/ 6 controls. These data show that Hsd 11 b 1 -/- mice fail to show the normal increase in 7 β-hydroxylated BA and decrease in 7 α-hydroxylated BA observed in control mice in response to a cholesterol containing diet, suggesting 11 β-HSD 1 deficiency blunts the influence of cholesterol on BA composition. Measurement of hepatic mRNAs encoding BA transporters suggest that hepatocyte uptake of BA is decreased in C 57 Bl/ 6 on WD compared to those mice on chow diet, whereas {{this was not the case}} in Hsd 11 b 1 -/- mice where hepatic expression did not change with diet. Thus, Hsd 11 b 1 -/- mice failed to increase expression of Ntcp/ Scl 10 a 1 / Scl 10 a 1 appropriately, suggesting impaired hepatic BA uptake, while Slc 51 b (encoding OST-β) expression was increased, compared to control mice, possibly to reduce hepatic BA concentration by transporting BA out of hepatocytes into the systemic circulation. Therefore, Hsd 11 b 1 -/- mice may adapt to a cholesterol-induced increase in hepatic BA by blunting hepatic BA uptake via NTCP/ SCL 10 A 1 / SCL 10 A 1 and increasing hepatic efflux via OST-β. The effects of 11 β-HSD 1 deficiency upon BA recycling and BA profile and concentration within the enterohepatic circuit, could reflect 11 β-HSD 1 action within the liver or could be due to actions in other tissues. To investigate the role of hepatic 11 β-HSD 1 specifically, 11 β-HSD 1 liver-specific knockout (Hsd 11 b 1 LKO), 11 β- HSD 1 liver-specific over-expressors (Hsd 11 b 1 LOE) and control mice with exon 3 of the Hsd 11 b 1 gene “floxed” (Hsd 11 b 1 F) were studied. Like Hsd 11 b 1 -/- mice, the gall bladder weights and bile volume of Hsd 11 b 1 LKO mice did not change with fasting or re-feeding. Similarly, BA concentrations in serum, liver and gall bladder did not show the normal changes that occur with fasting and re-feeding. BA profiling of bile from Hsd 11 b 1 LKO mice showed a reduction in the proportion of 7 β-hydroxylated BA (β-MCA>UDCA>others) with the exception of ω–MCA (a secondary BA), which was present at similar levels as in control fasted Hsd 11 b 1 F mice. Conversely, relative levels of 7 α-hydroxylated BA in Hsd 11 b 1 LKO mice were higher than in control mice (CA>α-MCA>others), with the exception of CDCA, which was normal. Opposite to Hsd 11 b 1 LKO mice, gall bladder weights of fasted Hsd 11 b 1 LOE mice showed the expected decrease as a result of gall bladder emptying when mice were re-fed. Also, fasted Hsd 11 b 1 LOE mice showed the expected decrease and increase in serum and bile fluid BA concentrations, respectively and these concentrations changed appropriately with ref-eeding. However, liver BA concentration in fasted Hsd 11 b 1 LOE mice was higher compared to re-fed Hsd 11 b 1 LOE mice. BA profiling of bile from Hsd 11 b 1 LOE mice showed normal percentage levels of both 7 β-hydroxylated and 7 α-hydroxylated BA in comparison to control Hsd 11 b 1 F mice with the exception of UDCA, which was significantly higher than in controls. This confirmed that hepatic over-expression and knockout of 11 β-HSD 1 in mice produce opposite changes in BA profile as well as BA concentration within the serum, liver and gall bladder components of the enterohepatic circuit supporting the idea that these this phenotype is due to hepatic and not extra-hepatic 11 β-HSD 1. There was evidence of increased BA synthesis in Hsd 11 b 1 LOE mice via increased hepatic Cyp 8 b 1 mRNA expression while Hsd 11 b 1 LKO mice showed a decrease in oxysterol synthesis via Cyp 39 a 1 expression. These data imply that hepatic over-expression increases BA synthesis via the classical pathway of synthesis while hepatic deletion may decrease BA synthesis via the alternative pathway of synthesis, though this pathway is normally a minor one in mice. In conclusion, these data show that 11 β-HSD 1 is an important regulator of bile acid profile in the gall bladder and serum, possibly through direct epimerisation of 7 α- hydroxylated to 7 β-hydroxylated bile acids via an oxo-intermediate. Findings from this study indicate a role for 11 β-HSD 1 in adaption to dietary cholesterol and suggest that hepatic 11 β-HSD 1 (as opposed to 11 β-HSD 1 in extra-hepatic tissues) is the main factor regulating BA metabolism. Also, work from this thesis demonstrates 11 β-HSD 1 is an important regulator of gall bladder emptying and filling, an important component of enterohepatic bile acid recycling. Based on these findings it is anticipated that therapeutic use of 11 β-HSD 1 inhibitors will result in BA imbalances within the enterohepatic circuit and therefore BA homeostasis. Care must therefore be observed when implementing therapeutic use of 11 β-HSD 1 inhibitors, with particular focus on patients with cholestasis, Addison’s disease and critically ill patients who already have known BA imbalances in their enterohepatic system...|$|E
