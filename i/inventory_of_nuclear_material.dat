The statistical evaluation using the uncertainties associated with individual measurement systems involved in the calculation of the material balance provides a fair standard for concluding whether the apparent loss of nuclear material means a diversion or whether the facility's accounting system needs improvement.

40|$|The nuclear industry, {{both in the}} {{commercial}} and the government sectors, has generated large quantities of material that span the spectrum of usefulness, from highly valuable (“assets”) to worthless (“wastes”). In many cases, the decision parameters are clear. Transuranic waste and high level waste, for example, have no value, and is either in a final disposition path today, or – {{in the case of}} high level waste – awaiting a policy decision about final disposition. Other materials, though discardable, have intrinsic scientific or market value that may be hidden by the complexity, hazard, or cost of recovery. An informed decision process should acknowledge the asset value, or lack of value, <b>of</b> the complete <b>inventory</b> <b>of</b> materials, and the structure necessary to implement the range of possible options. It is important that informed decisions are made about the asset value for the variety <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>materials</b> available. For example, there is a significant quantity of spent fuel available for recycle (an estimated $ 4 billion value in the Savannah River Site’s (SRS) L area alone); in fact, SRS has already blended down more than 300 metric tons of uranium for commercial reactor use. Over 34 metric tons of surplus plutonium is also on a path to be used as commercial fuel. There are other radiological materials that are routinely handled at the site in large quantities that should be viewed as strategically important and / or commercially viable. In some cases, these materials are irreplaceable domestically, and failure to consider their recovery could jeopardize our technological leadership or national defense. The <b>inventories</b> <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>materials</b> at SRS that have been characterized as “waste” include isotopes of plutonium, uranium, americium, and helium.

This paper discusses joint activities on solid radioactive waste (SRW) storage technologies in the Arctic for the Russian Navy. These are Western as well as Russian developments and will facilitate meeting Russia’s needs for storing solid radioactive waste from decommissioned nuclear submarines. All work is directed at applications at Andreeva Bay or other SRW management sites {{in northwest}} Russia. Andreeva Bay is the Navy site with the largest <b>inventory</b> <b>of</b> SRW, and the Russian Navy has recently completed construction of an SRW storage facility at this site. The technologies which have been selected so far are 1) a coating for concrete and metal, 2) containers for waste storage and transportation, and 3) various materials used in handling and storage. The demonstration phase is under way and will last one year. The coating has been applied and tests of its performance are in progress. In addition to field tests in the Russian Arctic, thermal cycling tests have been performed in a laboratory to determine the aging parameters of the coating. Radioactive waste containers have been delivered from the U. S., and a Russian container design is in progress. The ultimate goal of AMEC Project 1. 4 is to develop Russian self-sustainable capabilities for application in the extreme climate of the Arctic. These technologies will help shift the Russian Navy practices of bulk, open-air storage to an approach that includes containerized waste placed in a modern storage facility.

40|$|Over {{the past}} two years, the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) Richland Operations Office (RL) has {{formulated}} a focused, outcomes-based vision for accelerated cleanup of the Hanford Site. The primary elements, or outcomes, of this vision are to (1) accelerate restoration of the Columbia River Corridor, (2) transition the Central Plateau to long-term waste management, thereby shrinking the footprint of active site cleanup and operations, and (3) prepare for the future. The third outcome includes operation of the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), {{a key element of}} the foundation for Hanford's future; leveraging DOE's assets; and working with the community to understand their vision and reflect it as appropriate in the execution of the Hanford 2012 Vision. The purpose of these three outcomes is to provide a near term focus, aimed at achieving definitive end points over the next decade, while not precluding any long-term end-state associated with the completion of the Environmental Management (EM) mission at Hanford. The sheer expanse of the Hanford Site, the inherent hazards associated with the significant <b>inventory</b> <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>materials</b> and wastes, the large number of aging contaminated facilities, the diverse nature and extent of environmental contamination, and the proximity to the Columbia River make the Hanford Site arguably the world's largest and most complex environmental cleanup project. Current projections are that it will cost over $ 80 billion and take over four decades to complete the cleanup at Hanford. Accelerated cleanup of the River Corridor portion of the Site will allow the remediation effort to focus on specific, near-term outcomes. Hanford's success in achieving these outcomes will reduce urgent risk, shrink the Site, remove contamination and wastes from the proximity of the river, and consolidate waste management activities on the Central Plateau. Hanford has begun implementation of this vision. Performance-based contracts are being realigned to reflect the outcome orientation, including issuing a new River Corridor closure contract. This paper summarizes the outcome-based planning approach for other sites and interested parties. A brief introduction to the Hanford Site, along with detailed descriptions of the three outcomes is provided.

40|$|AbstractThe {{growing number}} of {{countries}} wishing to use nuclear energy, and the expansion in the geography of NPPs entails the risk <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> weapons proliferation, given that political leaders in some countries may want to purchase or develop sensitive nuclear technologies. A certain risk <b>of</b> proliferation through <b>nuclear</b> power technologies and materials cannot be excluded altogether. In the nuclear fuel cycle there are large <b>inventories</b> <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>materials,</b> including fissile materials, (many hundreds and thousands of tons). The problem <b>of</b> spent <b>nuclear</b> fuel with plutonium in it, especially for novice countries and countries with small nuclear power program, also {{increases the risk of}} proliferation, including the growing risk of actions on the part of subnational or terrorist organizations because of the proliferation <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> technologies and <b>materials</b> as respective protection measures are insufficient in these countries. In the event of thermal reactors, uranium enrichment is indispensable to production of fuel. Long-term storage of SNF from thermal reactors in an open fuel cycle, which is a common practice nowadays, entails an increased risk of proliferation due to the weakening of the radiation barrier over time and the potentiality of unauthorized removal of fuel by the proliferator state and its theft by criminals and terrorists. Fast-neutron reactors started up and operating on plutonium fuel do not require uranium enrichment. There is no long-term storage of SNF in the closed fuel cycles of fast reactors. Gradual replacement of thermal reactors by fast reactors, due to natural uranium being in short supply, creates prerequisites for phasing out uranium enrichment. However, countries having small nuclear power programs and, therefore, a limited number <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> units will use thermal reactors still for a long time, which will require uranium enrichment. Creation <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> weapons based on energy-grade plutonium using a simpler “gun-type” design is practically impossible because of a high neutron background inherent in this kind of plutonium. However, this does not exclude the potentiality of terrorist attempts to fabricate a primitive nuclear explosive device. Both sensitive technologies (uranium enrichment and SNF processing with separation of plutonium) will be used to start up fast reactors on uranium fuel with the subsequent transition to plutonium fuel. In this case, plutonium with a small content of higher isotopes will be bred not only in the blanket, but also in the reactor core in much greater quantities. The paper considers various technological and institutional approaches to solving the problem of fast reactor blankets in terms of ensuring a strong proliferation resistance...|$|R
