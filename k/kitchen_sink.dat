The player uses a joystick {{to control a}} bubble in a <b>kitchen</b> <b>sink.</b> The object is to progress through levels by cleaning the sink while avoiding enemies. The game received a mixed reception from critics.|$|E
5|$|Continuation Bond author Raymond Benson sees Vivienne Michel as {{the best}} {{realised}} female characterisation undertaken by Fleming, partly because {{the story is told}} in the first person narrative. Academic Jeremy Black notes that Michel is the closest Fleming gets to <b>kitchen</b> <b>sink</b> realism in the Bond canon: she has been a victim of life in the past, but is wilful and tough, too.|$|E
5|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} at Skyline Studios in New York City. Skyline {{was only a}} few blocks away from the Public Access Synthesizer Studio, where the band had recorded their previous albums. Alan Bezozi and John Flansburgh worked together to create atypical drum tracks, including one that samples the sound of Flansburgh's <b>kitchen</b> <b>sink</b> and refrigerator being struck with a drum stick. An Alesis SR-16 drum machine was used to program the drums.|$|E

5|$|In 2015, a modernized {{version of}} Thumbelina {{appears in the}} Disney Junior series, Goldie and Bear. In the episode Thumbelina's Wild Ride, Thumbelina (voiced by Debby Ryan with her singing voice {{provided}} by Shannon Chan-Kent) is hired to babysit for Goldie and Bear. The two friends are initially put off by her small stature, thinking she's almost helpless. When she tries getting the kids a snack, she falls down the <b>kitchen</b> <b>sink</b> and slides into the river behind the house. Goldie and Bear try to save her, but soon see that Thumbelina is resourceful, agile, and can lift several times her own weight. She saves herself from the river and even rescues the kids when they fall in trying to save her. The kids take an instant liking to Thumbellina and can't {{wait for the next}} time she babysits.|$|E
5|$|Bubbles is {{an action}} game with puzzle {{elements}} where the player controls the protagonist, a soap bubble, from a top-down perspective. The {{object is to}} clean a <b>kitchen</b> <b>sink</b> by maneuvering over ants, crumbs, and grease spots to absorb them before they slide into the drain. As the bubble absorbs more objects, it grows in size, eventually acquiring first eyes and then a smiling mouth. At the same time, sponges and scrub brushes slowly move around the sink, cleaning {{it on their own}} in competition with the player. Touching either of these enemies costs a player one life unless the bubble is large enough to have a complete face. In this case, the enemy will be knocked away and the bubble will shrink. Sponges and brushes can be knocked into the drain for bonus points, eliminating them from play. Two other enemies in the sink are stationary razor blades and roaches that crawl out of the drain. Contact with a blade is always fatal, while the bubble can safely touch the roach only while carrying a broom, which will kill the roach with one hit. The broom can be acquired by running over a cleaning lady who appears in the sink from time to time.|$|E

25|$|Because of this, {{cooking oil}} {{should never be}} dumped in the <b>kitchen</b> <b>sink</b> or in the toilet bowl. The proper way to dispose of oil is {{to put it in}} a sealed {{non-recyclable}} container and discard it with regular garbage. Placing the container of oil in the refrigerator to harden also makes disposal easier and less messy.|$|E
25|$|While the film, {{featuring}} the ensemble as a ragtag taxi company trying to hustle {{their way to}} solvency and respectability, performed modestly at the box office, its $16 million take exceeded its $12 million budget and has since become a minor cult favorite for its <b>kitchen</b> <b>sink</b> geniality. It was the second feature in a prolific career for director Joel Schumacher.|$|E
50|$|The only {{piece of}} bombastium known to exist {{was found in}} the Belgian Congo, and it was soon after its {{discovery}} acquired by Scrooge McDuck in the 1957 story A Cold Bargain by Carl Barks, but at that time it was also heavily sought after by the hostile nation of Brutopia. Brutopia's military spending budget that year amounted to one trillion dollars plus all the <b>kitchen</b> <b>sinks</b> of its happy people. Scrooge McDuck therefore had to pay one trillion dollars plus six <b>kitchen</b> <b>sinks</b> to win the auction.|$|R

25|$|A garbage {{disposal}} is a device, usually electrically powered, installed under a <b>kitchen</b> <b>sink</b> between the sink's drain and the trap which shreds food waste into pieces {{small enough to}} pass through plumbing.

25|$|A Taste of Honey was an {{influential}} 1960s film set in Salford, depicting working class poverty in ways not previously {{seen at the}} cinema, known as <b>kitchen</b> <b>sink</b> realism; Walter Greenwood's Love on the Dole, a 1930s book also set in Salford, was thought by the BBFC to be too sordid a depiction of poverty to {{be made into a}} film; Mike Leigh, from Salford, has produced films on a similar subject.|$|E
25|$|The {{programme}} {{was conceived}} in 1960 by scriptwriter Tony Warren at Granada Television in Manchester. Warren's initial <b>kitchen</b> <b>sink</b> drama proposal {{was rejected by}} the station's founder Sidney Bernstein, but he was persuaded by producer Harry Elton to produce the programme for 13 pilot episodes. Within six months of the show's first broadcast, it had become the most-watched programme on British television, and is {{a significant part of the}} British culture. The show has been one of the most lucrative programmes on British commercial television, underpinning the success of Granada Television and ITV.|$|E
5000|$|Reception for {{the song}} was positive. John Bush of AllMusic {{described}} the song as [...] "a dense, dark feature for Massive Attack themselves (on production as well as vocals), with a <b>kitchen</b> <b>sink's</b> worth of dubby effects and reverb." ...|$|R

25|$|Sim {{was among}} the top British film stars of the early- and mid-1950s, but his films of the late 1950s are {{considered}} by the critic Michael Brooke to be of lesser quality, because of poor scripts or lack of innovative direction. Sim made no films in the decade between 1961 and 1971; {{it is not clear}} whether this was, as Brooke suggests, because he found the scripts offered to him unacceptable or, as Simpson proposes, because film makers in the 1960s thought him unsuited to the <b>kitchen</b> <b>sink</b> dramas then fashionable.|$|E
25|$|Even in {{his later}} years, Scheinberg {{continued}} to fly abroad to fund-raise for his yeshiva. He always took the Talmudic tractate of Niddah with him and tried to learn all 72 folio-pages during the flight. He was known for never wasting a minute, using the time he spent walking or driving to yeshiva immersed in Torah study. According to his driver, Asa Wittow, he always sat with a Torah book in front of him, even at a wedding, and propped a Mishnah Berurah on the shelf above his <b>kitchen</b> <b>sink</b> while he washed dishes.|$|E

50|$|Stainless {{steel is}} often {{preferred}} for <b>kitchen</b> <b>sinks</b> {{because of its}} ruggedness, durability, heat resistance, and ease of cleaning. In better models, acoustic noise is controlled by applying resilient undercoating to dampen vibrations. The material is also used for cladding of surfaces such as appliances and backsplashes.|$|R

25|$|The final {{victim to}} be murdered at Melrose Avenue was a 23-year-old named Malcolm Barlow, whom Nilsen {{discovered}} slumped {{against a wall}} outside his home on 17 September 1981. When Nilsen enquired as to Barlow's welfare, he was informed the medication Barlow was prescribed for his epilepsy had caused his legs to weaken. Nilsen informed Barlow he should be in hospital and, supporting him, walked the youth into his residence before phoning an ambulance. The following day, Barlow was released from hospital and returned to Nilsen's home, apparently to thank him. He was invited into Nilsen's residence and, after eating a meal, began drinking rum and coke before falling asleep on Nilsen's sofa. Nilsen manually strangled Barlow as he slept, before stowing his body beneath his <b>kitchen</b> <b>sink</b> the following morning.|$|E
25|$|In all {{instances}} where R2 is used, the predictors are calculated by ordinary least-squares regression: that is, by minimizing SSres. In this case R2 increases as we {{increase the number}} of variables in the model (R2 is monotone increasing with the number of variables included—i.e., it will never decrease). This illustrates a drawback to one possible use of R2, where one might keep adding variables (<b>Kitchen</b> <b>sink</b> regression) to increase the R2 value. For example, if one is trying to predict the sales of a model of car from the car's gas mileage, price, and engine power, one can include such irrelevant factors as the first letter of the model's name or the height of the lead engineer designing the car because the R2 will never decrease as variables are added and will probably experience an increase due to chance alone.|$|E
25|$|The rise of state-subsidised theatre, and the {{emergence}} of <b>kitchen</b> <b>sink</b> drama undermined Beaumont's pre-eminence beginning in the 1950s. He disapproved of both, and stuck to his style of lavish, starry West End productions, even when they began to go out of fashion. He alienated both Coward and Terence Rattigan with his arrogant and sometimes duplicitous behaviour. Beaumont attempted to sabotage the former's new play Waiting in the Wings by telling him that the actresses Coward wanted to cast refused to play in it, whereas in reality Beaumont had not consulted them. He continued to have enormous successes: in 1958, he presented the first British productions of both West Side Story (1040 performances) and My Fair Lady (2281 performances). The latter cost an unprecedented sum to stage, but, thanks to a sustained publicity campaign by Tennent's, advance bookings meant that the show was in net profit two months before it opened.|$|E
