A suite of characterization techniques, including FTIR, Raman, X-ray and electron diffraction, TEM, SEM, and nitrogen sorption were employed to investigate the microstructural evolution and bulk properties. Dense ceramics (> 90 % relative density) were obtained after sintering at 1400 °C, without need for additional processing (i. e., <b>hot</b> or cold <b>isostatic</b> <b>pressing)</b> or any milling steps.

Titanate wasteform products we have developed or are developing are aimed at immobilization of: (a) tank wastes and sludges; (b) U-rich wastes from radioisotope production from reactor irradiation of UO 2 targets; (c) Al-rich wastes arising from reprocessing of Al-clad fuels; (d) 99 Tc; (e) high- Mo wastes arising from reprocessing of U-Mo fuels and (f) partitioned Cs-rich wastes. Other wasteforms include encapsulated zeolites or silica/alumina beads for immobilization of 129 I. Wasteform production techniques cover <b>hot</b> <b>isostatic</b> and uniaxial <b>pressing,</b> sintering, and cold-crucible melting.

40|$|Intergranular {{pressure}} solution (IPS) is {{an important}} compaction and deformation mechanism in quartzose rocks, but the kinetics and rate-controlling process remain unclear. The aim {{of the present study}} is to test microphysical models for compaction creep by IPS against <b>isostatic</b> <b>hot</b> <b>pressing</b> experiments performed on quartz sand under conditions expected to favor pressure solution (confining pressure 300 MPa, pore water pressure 150 – 250 MPa, temperature 400 – 600 °C). Microstructural observations revealed widespread intergranular indentation features and confirmed that intergranular pressure solution was indeed the dominant deformation mechanism under the chosen conditions. For porosities down to 15 %, the mechanical data agree satisfactorily with a microphysical model incorporating a previously determined kinetic law for dissolution of loose granular quartz, suggesting that the rate-limiting mechanism of IPS was dissolution. The model also predicts IPS rates within one order of magnitude of those measured in previous experiments at 150 – 350 °C, and thus seem robust enough to model sandstone compaction in nature. Such applications may not be straightforward, however, as the present evidence for dissolution control implies that the compositional variability of natural pore fluids may strongly influence IPS rates in sandstones...|$|R

30|$|The {{metallurgical}} {{phase of}} nanocomposites {{is shown in}} Fig. 3 in the longitudinal and traverse directions relative to the hot pressing direction. There are {{significant differences in the}} metallurgical phase microstructure perpendicular and parallel to the hot pressing direction. The graphite in the black region perpendicular to the hot-pressing direction exhibits a flocculent shape, and the graphite in the black region parallel to the hot-pressing direction exhibits a more slender shape. The reasons for this difference are as follows: The hot pressing sintering process is single-action pressing. Vertical pressure is applied on the composite powder in a cylindrical graphite die. There are significant morphological differences between the graphite perpendicular to the hot-pressing direction and the graphite parallel to the hot-pressing direction, because the graphite is intrinsically fluffy. These differences are maintained after <b>isostatic</b> <b>pressing,</b> because the pressures applied to the composite green body are equal in every direction during <b>isostatic</b> <b>pressing</b> after the <b>hot</b> pressing sintering step. Thus, the morphological differences formed during hot pressing sintering remain.|$|R
