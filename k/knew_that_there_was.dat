5|$|During {{the first}} three months of 1944, Cicero {{supplied}} the Germans with copies of documents taken from his employer's dispatch box or his safe. Photographs of top secret documents were generally handed over in Moyzisch's car, which was parked inconspicuously on an Ankara street. On one occasion, this led to a high-speed chase around Ankara as someone had taken an interest in the hand-over. Bazna, who had perhaps been tailed, escaped. Ultra, the British codebreaking system based at Bletchley Park routinely read German messages, coded by the Enigma machine. From that information, the codebreakers <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> an intelligence breach, but did not know that the source was the British Embassy in Turkey.|$|E

25|$|A Fistful of Dollars was {{at first}} {{intended}} by Leone to reinvent the western genre in Italy. In his opinion, the American westerns of the mid- to late-1950s had become stagnant, overly preachy and not believable. Despite {{the fact that even}} Hollywood began to gear down production of such films, Leone <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> still a significant market in Europe for westerns. He observed that Italian audiences laughed at the stock conventions of both American westerns and the pastiche work of Italian directors working behind pseudonyms. His approach was to take the grammar of Italian film and to transpose it into a western setting.|$|E
25|$|Later, {{after the}} Civil War when the 15th Amendment to give freedmen and free blacks {{the right to}} vote was being debated, Douglass split with the Stanton-led faction of the women's rights movement. Douglass {{supported}} the amendment, which would grant suffrage to black men. Stanton opposed the 15th Amendment because it limited expansion of suffrage to black men; she predicted its passage would delay for decades the cause for women's right to vote. Stanton argued that American women and black men should band together to fight for universal suffrage, and opposed any bill that split the issues. Douglass and Stanton both <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> not yet enough male support for women's right to vote, but that an amendment giving black men the vote could pass in the late 1860s. Stanton wanted to attach women's suffrage to that of black men so that her cause would be carried to success.|$|E
25|$|On {{the morning}} of 29 November the French began {{shelling}} the Prussian positions from artillery pieces sited on the south bank of the Rhine. Oppen soon launched a heavy assault on the French entrenched camp, but after initial success the Prussians were driven back. Charpentier then launched a counterattack and drove Oppen's troops back to Velp. A second attack at noon overran a Prussian outpost at Lichtenbeek House, inflicting 50 casualties. Amey reinforced the French positions outside the entrenched camp. Fearing that MacDonald might launch an attack from Arnhem against his supply line, Bülow ordered Oppen to assault Arnhem the following morning. That day MacDonald returned to Arnhem and saw {{the size of the}} Prussian force. He deduced that he would soon face superior forces at Arnhem and that Charpentier was in danger of being trapped. Learning that Molitor abandoned Utrecht and realizing that holding the line of the Ijssel was hopeless, MacDonald <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> no longer a good reason to hold Arnhem. He instructed Charpentier to withdraw his troops from the city and then returned to Nijmegen.|$|E

From way back to the present, to whatever, to make it really true and honest".

500|$|According to Oborne, Vorster was {{a pragmatic}} {{politician}} {{who wanted to}} maintain apartheid {{and to make it}} appear acceptable to the outside world. To this end, attempting to broaden South Africa's international connections, he accepted black foreign diplomats in the country and began to plan a policy to allow mixed-race sport to prevent South Africa's international isolation. However, such policies were unpopular with his domestic supporters and he was careful not to go too far. Oborne writes: [...] "Vorster <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> a limit to how far he could go without imperilling his own position. That limit was Basil D'Oliveira." [...] According to Oborne, Vorster never intended to allow D'Oliveira to play with the MCC team; his supporters would not have accepted a non-white South African benefiting from this change of policy and demonstrating his ability at a high level. Vorster therefore worked to give the impression overseas that D'Oliveira would be welcome, {{while at the same time}} doing his utmost to stop him from playing. He courted the British ambassador, Sir John Nicholls, and told him that a tour party including D'Oliveira would be acceptable. Nicholls passed this on to the UK government. Vorster meanwhile monitored D'Oliveira's progress closely; from his debut in 1966, South Africa kept a security file on him.|$|E

The objectives of the 33rd Division were changed to the 98th Brigade covering the flank of the 5th Australian Division and the 100th Brigade recapturing the ground lost the day before.

[...] Marshall Sahlins, an emeritus professor who helped lead {{the fight against the}} CI, said the newspaper article [...] "fulsomely" [...] praised Xu Lin, and told The Wall Street Journal, [...] "They knew that this was a dubious operation to begin with.

2500|$|... and the EFF {{criticizes the}} provision's lack of notice. However, the EFF's {{criticism}} is more extensive—they {{believe that the}} amendment [...] "is in possible violation of the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution" [...] because previously if the FBI listened to voicemail illegally, it could not use the messages in evidence against the defendant. Others disagree with these assessments. Professor Orin Kerr, of the George Washington University school of law, believes that the ECPA [...] "adopted a rather strange rule to regulate voicemail stored with service providers" [...] because [...] "under ECPA, if the government <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> one copy of an unopened private message in a person's bedroom and another copy on their remotely stored voicemail, it was illegal for the FBI to simply obtain the voicemail; the law actually compelled the police to invade the home and rifle through peoples' bedrooms {{so as not to}} disturb the more private voicemail." [...] In Professor Kerr's opinion, this made little sense and the amendment that was made by the USA PATRIOT Act was reasonable and sensible.|$|E
2500|$|George Pullman pioneered {{sleeping}} accommodations on trains, and by {{the late}} 1860s, he was hiring only African-Americans to serve as porters. [...] After the Civil War ended in 1865 Pullman <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> a large pool of former slaves who would be looking for work; {{he also had a}} very clear racial conception. He was aware that most Americans, unlike the wealthy, didn’t have personal servants in their homes. Pullman also knew the wealthy were accustomed to being served by a liveried waiter or butler, but to staff the Pullman cars with [...] "properly humble" [...] workers in uniform was something the American middle class had never experienced. [...] Hence, part of the appeal of traveling on sleeping cars was, in a sense, to have an upper class experience. [...] From the very start, porters were featured in Pullman's ads promoting his new sleeper service. [...] Initially, they were one of the features that most clearly distinguished his carriages from those of competitors, but eventually nearly all would follow his lead, hiring African-Americans as porters, cooks, waiters and Red Caps (railway station porters).|$|E
2500|$|His ever-expanding {{interests}} led {{him into}} plant population genetics, a field that he essentially founded. [...] His particular interest was in the population genetics of Inbreeding species, and included wild plants such as Collinsia, Avena barbata and Avena fatua. [...] His interest in inbreeding species probably stemmed from his interactions with Ledyard Stebbins, who was also at U.C. Davis, and had predicted that wild inbreeding plant populations should be devoid of genetic variation. As a plant breeder who had done selection on inbreeding species in cultivated plants, Allard <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> ample genetic variation within [...] "pure lines." [...] It {{is easy to see}} how he would have become intriqued with inbreeding wild species. And indeed starting in the early 1960s he worked with experimental populations of wheat, barley, and lima beans as well as the wild plants Collinsia, Avena barbata, and Avena fatua investigating a wide variety of issues important to the population genetics of inbreeding species. [...] He published numerous foundational papers on the effects of mating systems, selection, gene-environment interactions, linkage disequilibrium, and genetic drift on the genetic variation of inbreeding plant populations.|$|E
