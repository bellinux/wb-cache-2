5|$|On August 3, 2015, divers {{found the}} wreck of the USNS Mission San Miguel (T-AO-129) within the monument. She had sunk there on October 8, 1957 when she ran aground on Maro Reef while running at full speed and <b>in</b> <b>ballast.</b> Researchers will map and study the wreck in situ.|$|E
5|$|The same report {{lists the}} {{following}} as some drawbacks to the double-hull design, including higher build costs, greater operating expenses (e.g. higher canal and port tariffs), difficulties <b>in</b> <b>ballast</b> tank ventilation, {{the fact that}} ballast tanks need continuous monitoring and maintenance, increased transverse free surface, the greater number of surfaces to maintain, the risk of explosions in double-hull spaces if a vapor detection system not fitted, and that cleaning ballast tanks is more difficult for double hull ships.|$|E
5|$|UB-12 sank her largest ship, Silksworth Hall of , on 10 April. The British-registered {{ship was}} en route from Hull to Philadelphia <b>in</b> <b>ballast</b> when Kiel torpedoed her without warning {{a little more than}} one {{nautical}} mile (two kilometers) from the Corton Lightvessel. Other ships picked up 31 survivors from Silksworth Hall, but 3 men were lost. Later in the month, Admiral Reinhardt Scheer, the newest commander-in-chief of the High Seas Fleet, called off the merchant shipping offensive and ordered all boats at sea to return, and all boats in port to remain there.|$|E
50|$|In general, {{ladder track}} {{produces}} lower {{pressures on the}} road bed: both the maximum pressure and the amplitude of pressure pulses are smaller than transverse sleepered track, which can reduce maintenance costs <b>in</b> <b>ballasted</b> systems. An additional benefit <b>in</b> <b>ballasted</b> ladder track is increased resistance to ballast wash out {{and other forms of}} ballast degradation due the addition longitudinal support and rigidity in ladder track.; the same structural rigidity also adds to buckling resistance.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Corresponding {{prevention}} {{strategies can}} be put forward by learning the stray current distribution in the metro rebar. In the paper, the stray current intensity of the rebar <b>in</b> the <b>ballast</b> of the power supply area and the 24 -hour polarization potential of the rebar <b>in</b> the <b>ballast</b> are obtained through the test of vertical resistance, track-current drainage net resistance and track-earth resistance, and the polarization potential test <b>in</b> the tunnel <b>ballast</b> of metro system in service. The daily leak of the stray current of the rebar <b>in</b> the <b>ballast</b> is also obtained based {{on the relationship between}} the polarization potential and current intensity. The test result shows that the vertical resistance of the track has quite good consistency while the track-current drainage net resistance and track-earth resistance have relatively great discreteness. The polarization potential peak of the rebar <b>in</b> the <b>ballast</b> is over 500 mV and the 24 -hour equivalent and average current intensity of the rebar <b>in</b> the <b>ballast</b> can rise up to 0. 26 ~ 0. 43 A/d...|$|R
50|$|Australian tubeworms are {{introduced}} to new habitat when they are transported on ship hulls, <b>in</b> <b>ballasts,</b> and on shells.

25|$|Neve was {{promoted}} to Post-captain in 1806 and command passed to Commander Charles Dilkes in February 1806. Hazard, with Growler, Conflict and the hired armed brig , captured nine chasse-marées on 27 June 1807 in the Pertuis Breton. The captured vessels were: Deux Amis (armed with two 4-pounder guns), Trois Frères Horaces (armed with four swivels, Véronique (laden with wheat), Sans Pareil (laden with wheat), Marie Françoise (<b>in</b> <b>ballast),</b> Marie Louise (<b>in</b> <b>ballast),</b> Bon Janton (<b>in</b> <b>ballast),</b> Pascal (<b>in</b> <b>ballast),</b> and Gaulle (<b>in</b> <b>ballast).</b> Their crews escaped on shore with all their papers. The crew of a tenth chasse maree scuttled their vessel to prevent the British from capturing her. The British drove six on to the shore, {{one of which was}} armed with six guns. In addition, between 1 April and 10 June the small squadron captured and destroyed two sloops, Rosalie and Jeune Marie, and five chasse marees: Petite Marie, Patriote, Marianne, Belle Louise Josephine, and Marie Françoise. Colpoys escorted the prizes back to Plymouth. Lastly, French shore batteries sank one chasse maree, of unknown name, after the British had captured her.|$|E

25|$|This {{property}} {{can lead}} to more precise current control than merely choosing an appropriate fixed resistor. The power lost <b>in</b> the resistive <b>ballast</b> is also reduced because a smaller portion of the overall power is dropped <b>in</b> the <b>ballast</b> compared to what might be required with a fixed resistor.|$|R

25|$|A {{disadvantage}} of the inductor is that current is shifted {{out of phase}} with the voltage, producing a poor power factor. <b>In</b> more expensive <b>ballasts,</b> a capacitor is often paired with the inductor to correct the power factor. <b>In</b> <b>ballasts</b> that control two or more lamps, line-frequency ballasts commonly use different phase relationships between the multiple lamps. This not only mitigates the flicker of the individual lamps, it also helps maintain a high power factor. These ballasts are often called lead-lag ballasts because the current in one lamp leads the mains phase and the current in the other lamp lags the mains phase.|$|R
