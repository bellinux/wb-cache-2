5|$|The oil <b>industry</b> <b>would</b> {{ultimately}} {{prove to}} be a resource curse to Wichita Falls, and the Texas Oil Boom ended only a few years later. The building was vacated, boarded up, and virtually forgotten in 1929 as the Great Depression struck North Texas and office space became relatively inexpensive to lease or purchase. A fire gutted the building in 1931, rendering it unusable for a number of years.|$|E

At the same time, they {{pointed out that there}} was no industry in Lier that would need a railway, and that by building a line, such <b>industry</b> <b>would</b> be established. In April 1897, the committee held a public offering of shares in A/S Lierbanen. At the same time, they sent an application for a social grant to the Ministry of Labour for NOK330,000, plus NOK30,375 from the Norwegian State Railways (NSB).|$|E
5|$|A {{committee}} {{appointed by}} the Prime Minister, Robert Menzies, and chaired by Keith Murray, recommended in 1957 that a medical school be established at Kensington. Its creation, followed by that of a Faculty of Arts, prompted the university to change {{its name to the}} University of New South Wales (UNSW) in 1958. Baxter established a number of unusual schools. He created a School of Nuclear Engineering in anticipation that a nuclear power <b>industry</b> <b>would</b> be established in Australia. He also created schools of Textile Technology, Wool Technology, Food Technology and Highway Engineering and Traffic Engineering. The School of Business Administration and an Institute of Administration was established in 1960, and ultimately the Australian Graduate School of Management in 1969. When the Faculty of Arts was created, he insisted that all Arts students take at least one science subject.|$|E

5|$|After the WTO {{phased out}} {{quantitative}} quotas on textile in 2004 under the Agreement on Textile and Clothing(ATC). Egyptian textile and garment producers feared that their <b>industry</b> <b>would</b> {{be threatened by}} global competition from China and India. The flood of similar articles from these two nations to the United States could edge out Egyptian exports, and possibly result {{in the loss of}} 150,000 job opportunities. This was estimated to cost some of the $3.2 billion in US foreign direct investment in Egypt. Further, Egypt was in search of sources for increased economic growth and trade to provide jobs for its rapidly growing labor force.|$|E
5|$|All four {{ships were}} officially laid down on 19 December 1912, but work {{did not begin}} until March–April 1913. After a {{progress}} review on 4 June 1914, launching of the first pair of ships was delayed until October 1914. When World War I began, the hull of Izmail, the most advanced ship, was judged 43percent complete, with the others lagging considerably behind. The war caused more delays, including problems obtaining imported components, and the ships were competing for scarce resources with other production deemed necessary for the war. Three of the four ships were launched in 1915, {{but it was clear}} that Russian <b>industry</b> <b>would</b> not be able to complete them during the war, mostly because the turrets were seriously delayed. They were reclassified as 2nd rank projects by the Main Administration of Shipbuilding in 1916.|$|E
5|$|In 1980, the mine's {{production}} peaked with {{an export}} of 2.4million tonnes and 1,000 employees. In 1984, {{to improve the}} workplace environment, a used Allmänna Svenska Elektriska Aktiebolaget (ASEA)-built T45 locomotive was bought from Sweden. However, it suffered several breakdowns and was retired in 1989. As a replacement, a new G 1203 BB was bought from Maschinenbau Kiel and was delivered to Kirkenes on 8 February 1991. In 1988, {{the first part of}} the Kirkenes plant was closed, and the mining company drastically reduced production because its owner, the Ministry of Trade and <b>Industry,</b> <b>would</b> no longer subsidize operations. All mining ceased in the spring of 1996, and the last load of ore was hauled in April 1997. After operations closed, the oldest G12 was transferred to Sør-Varanger Museum.|$|E

5|$|Three of {{the four}} ships were {{launched}} in 1915 and the fourth in 1916. Work on the gun turrets lagged, and it became evident that Russian <b>industry</b> <b>would</b> {{not be able to}} complete the ships during the war. The Russian Revolution of 1917 put a stop to their construction, which was never resumed. Although some consideration was given to finishing the hulls that were nearest to completion, they were all eventually sold for scrap by the Soviet Union. The Soviet Navy proposed in 1925 to convert Izmail, the ship closest to completion, to an aircraft carrier, but the plan was cancelled after political maneuvering by the Red Army led to funding not being available.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1990s, Brazilian and Russian {{authorities}} conducted {{talks on}} the possible acquisition of the Su-27M. In 2001, the Brazilian government launched the F-X tender, the objective of which was to procure at least twelve aircraft to replace the Brazilian Air Force's ageing aircraft, primarily the Mirage IIIs. Since the Brazilian government was also looking to develop the country's aerospace and defence industries, Sukhoi partnered with the Brazilian defence contractor Avibras during the tender. The two companies submitted the Su-27M to the US$700-million tender, and included an offset agreement wherein the Brazilian <b>industry</b> <b>would</b> participate in the manufacturing of certain aircraft equipment. The tender was suspended in 2003 because of domestic political issues and then scrapped in 2005, pending the availability of new fighters. The Su-27M was preferred over the next favourite, the Mirage 2000BR; had the aircraft been purchased, {{it would have been}} the first heavy fighter delivered to Latin America.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the First World War, the {{economic}} prospects in South Wales were good. Although production fell after the 1913 high, demand was still strong enough to push the coalfields to their limit. In February 1917 coal mining came under government control and demand increased as the war intensified, ensuring a market for sufficient supplies of coal. After the war the picture began to change. Initially the British coal industry was buoyed by a series of fortuitous economic events, such as the American coal miners' strike, and by 1924, unemployment for miners was below the national average. But the belief that the mining <b>industry</b> <b>would</b> experience a permanent demand for coal was shattered by the Depression, and the Rhondda experienced a massive upturn in unemployment. The situation worsened in 1926 when, in response to coalowners reducing pay and lengthening working hours of miners, the TUC called a general strike in defence of the miners who had been locked out following A.J. Cook's call 'not a penny off the pay, not a minute on the day'. The TUC called off the strike just nine days later, without resolving the miners' cut in wages. The miners disagreed and stayed on strike for a further seven months until they were starved into surrendering. The Rhondda saw many schemes set up by miners to aid their plight, such as soup kitchens and fêtes and 'joy' days to support them; while in Maerdy the local miners set up a rationing system. By the time the miners returned to work there was little desire for further action through strikes, which saw a decline in the popularity of 'The Fed' and greater emphasis on solving problems through political and parliamentary means.|$|E

Rupp sold the company in 1973. Rupp <b>Industries</b> <b>would</b> go on to build {{some of the most}} advanced snowmobiles of the time, as well as dirt bikes and other recreational vehicles until they had to close their doors in 1978 due to bankruptcy. Rupp vehicles have since become very collectible.|$|R
