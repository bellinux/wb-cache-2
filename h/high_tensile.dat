5|$|Steel is an alloy of {{iron and}} carbon with trace amounts of other elements. Because of its <b>high</b> <b>tensile</b> {{strength}} and low cost, {{it is a major}} component used in buildings, infrastructure, tools, ships, automobiles, machines, appliances, and weapons.|$|E
5|$|Small {{amounts of}} {{manganese}} improve the workability of steel at high temperatures by forming a high-melting sulfide and preventing {{the formation of}} a liquid iron sulfide at the grain boundaries. If the manganese content reaches 4%, the embrittlement of the steel becomes a dominant feature. The embrittlement decreases at higher manganese concentrations and reaches an acceptable level at 8%. Steel containing 8 to 15% of manganese has a <b>high</b> <b>tensile</b> strength of up to 863MPa. Steel with 12% manganese was discovered in 1882 by Robert Hadfield and is still known as Hadfield steel. It was used for British military steel helmets and later by the U.S. military.|$|E
5|$|As {{a direct}} result of {{watching}} his fellow martial artists train with a fixed-blade fighting knife in class, yet carry some type of a folding knife when they left the training area, Emerson decided there was a need for a sturdy folding knife designed primarily for combat. Although Emerson had always maintained that the knives he made were built as fighting knives first and foremost, in October 1985 he stripped down five of these designs to simpler materials. He continued his use of linen or canvas micarta because of its <b>high</b> <b>tensile</b> strength and superior gripping surface when wet; he decided on black or dark grey for the color instead of the brighter colors used previously. He retained the titanium for the liners and bolsters but chose to bead-blast them a flat grey matte color as opposed to the colorful anodizing which used to appear on his knives. The reasons for using titanium were its exceptional strength-to-weight ratio and corrosion resistance.|$|E

5|$|Examination of fruiting bodies using {{scanning}} {{electron microscopy}} and transmission electron microscopy has revealed details about their ultrastructure—their microscopic architecture and arrangement. For example, the hyphae of the hapteron form a dense tangled network, while the hyphae of the funicular cord are arranged in a twisted form like a rope. Further, the funicular cord, known to be highly elastic and with a <b>high</b> <b>tensile</b> strength, is made of thicker hyphae {{than the rest of}} the funiculus. Also, the ecto- and endoperidium are made of thick-walled, unbranched hyphae, known as skeletal hyphae. It has been proposed that these skeletal hyphae form a structural network that helps the fruiting body maintain the elasticity vital for proper functioning of the spore dispersal mechanism.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} types of glass fiber used in {{fiberglass}} is E-glass, which is alumino-borosilicate glass {{with less than}} 1% w/w alkali oxides, mainly used for glass-reinforced plastics. Other types of glass used are A-glass (Alkali-lime glass {{with little or no}} boron oxide), E-CR-glass (Electrical/Chemical Resistance; alumino-lime silicate with less than 1% w/w alkali oxides, with high acid resistance), C-glass (alkali-lime glass with high boron oxide content, used for glass staple fibers and insulation), D-glass (borosilicate glass, named for its low Dielectric constant), R-glass (alumino silicate glass without MgO and CaO with high mechanical requirements as reinforcement), and S-glass (alumino silicate glass without CaO but with high MgO content with <b>high</b> <b>tensile</b> strength).|$|E

25|$|Most silks, in {{particular}} dragline silk, have exceptional mechanical properties. They exhibit a unique combination of <b>high</b> <b>tensile</b> strength and extensibility (ductility). This enables a silk fibre to absorb {{a large amount}} of energy before breaking (toughness, the area under a stress-strain curve).|$|E
25|$|HDPE has <b>high</b> <b>tensile</b> strength. It {{is used in}} {{products}} and packaging such as milk jugs, detergent bottles, butter tubs, garbage containers, and water pipes. One-third of all toys are manufactured from HDPE. In 2007, the global HDPE consumption reached a volume of more than 30 million tons.|$|E

50|$|Most SRJs are {{designed}} with an offset housing, allowing for higher compressive loads in a smaller space. Alternatively, the joint can be assembled backwards for <b>higher</b> <b>tensile</b> load capability but less range of motion.|$|R
50|$|Steel fibre-reinforced {{shotcrete}} (SFRS) is shotcrete (spray concrete) {{with steel}} fibres added. It has <b>higher</b> <b>tensile</b> strength than unreinforced shotcrete and is quicker to apply than weldmesh reinforcement. It {{has often been}} used for tunnels.|$|R
25|$|With the Industrial Revolution in the 19th century, truss {{systems of}} wrought iron were {{developed}} for larger bridges, but iron {{does not have}} the tensile strength to support large loads. With the advent of steel, which has a <b>high</b> <b>tensile</b> strength, much larger bridges were built, many using the ideas of Gustave Eiffel.|$|E
25|$|Currently, Kevlar {{has many}} applications, ranging from bicycle tires and racing sails to body armor, {{because of its}} <b>high</b> <b>tensile</b> strength-to-weight ratio; by this measure it is 5 times {{stronger}} than steel. It {{is also used to}} make modern drumheads that withstand high impact. When used as a woven material, it is suitable for mooring lines and other underwater applications.|$|E
25|$|Composite {{material}} {{structures are}} made of cloth with a <b>high</b> <b>tensile</b> strength (usually fiberglass or carbon fiber, or occasionally Kevlar) combined with a structural plastic (usually epoxy, although vinylester is used in some aircraft). The fabric is saturated with the structural plastic in a liquid form; when the plastic cures and hardens, the part will hold its shape while possessing the strength characteristics of the fabric.|$|E

5000|$|The {{term was}} used in both the {{original}} 1933 version, {{as well as the}} 2005 remake, of King Kong. When Kong is brought to New York City, he is chained with this metal on stage. The impression given by the movie from Carl Denham to the audience is that the [...] "chrome steel" [...] has some unique properties of having a <b>higher</b> <b>tensile</b> strength than [...] "normal steel" [...] which is incorrect. The chromium component of chrome steel would only provide some corrosion resistance. <b>Higher</b> <b>tensile</b> strength steels are created by the addition of carbon. True to this deceptive description, Kong breaks free anyway.|$|R
50|$|First {{generation}} flywheel {{energy storage}} systems use a large steel flywheel rotating on mechanical bearings. Newer systems use carbon-fiber composite rotors that have a <b>higher</b> <b>tensile</b> strength than steel and are {{an order of magnitude}} less heavy.|$|R
25|$|Copper’s higher tensile {{strength}} (200–250 N/mm2 annealed) compared to aluminium (100 N/mm2 for typical conductor alloys) {{is another reason}} why copper is used extensively in the building industry. Copper’s high strength resists stretching, neck-down, creep, nicks and breaks, and thereby also prevents failures and service interruptions. Copper is much heavier than aluminum for conductors of equal current carrying capacity, so the <b>high</b> <b>tensile</b> strength is offset by its increased weight.|$|E
25|$|White & grey {{aluminium}} oxide abrasives are used on <b>high</b> <b>tensile</b> strength metals, such as carbon and alloy steel, tough iron, and nonferrous alloys. Gray silicon carbide abrasives are used on hard and brittle substances, such as grey iron and cemented carbide, and low tensile strength metals, such as brass, aluminium, and copper. Green chromium (III) oxide is the abrasive used in green compounds that are typically used to finish ferrous metals (steels).|$|E
25|$|Prestressed {{concrete}} {{is a kind}} of {{reinforced concrete}} used for overcoming concrete's natural weakness in tension. It can be applied to beams, floors or bridges with a longer span than is practical with ordinary reinforced concrete. Prestressing tendons (generally of <b>high</b> <b>tensile</b> steel cable or rods) are used to provide a clamping load which produces a compressive stress that offsets the tensile stress that the concrete compression member would, otherwise, experience due to a bending load.|$|E
50|$|For most purposes, {{ductility}} is a {{more important}} measure {{of the quality of}} wrought iron than tensile strength. In tensile testing, the best irons are able to undergo considerable elongation before failure. <b>Higher</b> <b>tensile</b> wrought iron is brittle.|$|R
30|$|The {{heat input}} governs the above said {{strengthening}} mechanism. Decrease in heat input {{will increase the}} strengthening effects. Thus, the UWFSW joint recorded higher hardness in the entire region than the FSW joint and therefor the UWFSW joint exhibited <b>higher</b> <b>tensile</b> strength than the FSW joint. The <b>higher</b> <b>tensile</b> strength is attributed {{to the presence of}} relatively fine grains, high volume fraction of precipitates and appreciably narrow LHDR. On comparing the four joint conditions (FSW-THC, FSW-TTC, UWFSW-THC and UWFSW-TTC), the UWFSW-TTC joint shows enhanced tensile and hardness properties because this joint experience the lowest temperature compared to its counterparts. So, the pin profile capable of formation of the defect-free stir zone at the minimum heat input is appreciable.|$|R

The CNTs were mixed with several liquid such as ethanol, latex, water glue and epoxy resin. These mixtures were added to hemp fiber and prepared the hemp fiber/epoxy resin composites. The mechanical properties of both fiber and composite samples were measured. It {{was found that the}} mixture of epoxy resin and CNTs with CNTs ratio of 20 vol % in hemp fiber showed the <b>highest</b> <b>tensile</b> strength of 25. 43 N. and the same mixture in hemp fiber/epoxy resin composites showed the <b>highest</b> <b>tensile</b> strength of 31. 82 MPa and elongation of 7. 40 %...|$|R
25|$|Filament tape or {{strapping}} tape is a {{pressure-sensitive tape}} used for several packaging {{functions such as}} closing corrugated fiberboard boxes, reinforcing packages, bundling items, pallet utilizing, etc. It consists of a pressure-sensitive adhesive coated onto a backing material which is usually a polypropylene or polyester film and fiberglass filaments embedded to add <b>high</b> <b>tensile</b> strength. Filament tape was invented in 1946 by Cyrus Woodrow Bemmels. In 1949, it {{was placed on the}} market and was an immediate success.|$|E
25|$|Typical normal {{coronary}} artery pressures are in the <200 mmHg range (27 kPa). The hydraulic pressures applied within the balloon may extend to as high as 19000 mmHg (2,500 kPa). Prevention of over-enlargement is achieved by choosing balloons manufactured out of <b>high</b> <b>tensile</b> strength clear plastic membranes. The balloon is initially folded around the catheter, near the tip, to create a small cross-sectional profile to facilitate passage though luminal stenotic areas, and is designed to inflate to a specific pre-designed diameter. If over inflated, the balloon material simply tears and allows the inflating radiocontrast agent to simply escape into the blood.|$|E
25|$|The intermolecular {{forces in}} {{polymers}} {{can be affected}} by dipoles in the monomer units. Polymers containing amide or carbonyl groups can form hydrogen bonds between adjacent chains; the partially positively charged hydrogen atoms in N-H groups of one chain are strongly attracted to the partially negatively charged oxygen atoms in C=O groups on another. These strong hydrogen bonds, for example, result in the <b>high</b> <b>tensile</b> strength and melting point of polymers containing urethane or urea linkages. Polyesters have dipole-dipole bonding between the oxygen atoms in C=O groups and the hydrogen atoms in H-C groups. Dipole bonding is {{not as strong as}} hydrogen bonding, so a polyester's melting point and strength are lower than Kevlar's (Twaron), but polyesters have greater flexibility.|$|E
40|$|In this letter, rapid thermal {{annealing}} (RTA) and microwave annealing (MA) are compared to demonstrate the dopant activation. Using microwave annealing, the dopant in the Si was well-activated and showed suppressed dopant diffusion, as compared to traditional high temperature RTA. In addition, SiN(x) films after low temperature MA treatment presented <b>higher</b> <b>tensile</b> stress than the films annealed by RTA. Therefore, this MA approach could potentially be applied to these behaviors of I distribution and <b>higher</b> <b>tensile</b> stress SiNx film {{may be useful in}} contact etch-stop layer or stress memorization technique in the fabrication of small pitch nanoscaled n-channel Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field Effect Transistors.
