5|$|In February 1971, President Nixon {{proposed}} {{health insurance}} reform—an employer mandate to offer {{private health insurance}} if employees volunteered to pay 25 percent of premiums, federalization of Medicaid for the poor with dependent minor children, and support for health maintenance organizations. Hearings on national health insurance were held in 1971, but no bill {{had the support of}} House Ways and Means and Senate Finance Committee chairmen Representative Wilbur Mills and Senator Russell Long. Kennedy sponsored and helped pass the limited <b>Health</b> <b>Maintenance</b> <b>Organization</b> Act of 1973. He also played a leading role, with Senator Jacob Javits, in the creation and passage of the National Cancer Act of 1971.|$|E
25|$|Beyond its direct spending, the US {{government}} is also highly involved in healthcare through regulation and legislation. For example, the <b>Health</b> <b>Maintenance</b> <b>Organization</b> Act of 1973 provided grants and loans to subsidize Health Maintenance Organizations and contained provisions to stimulate their popularity. HMOs had been declining before the law; by 2002 there were 500 such plans enrolling 76 million people.|$|E

2500|$|Dr. Paul Starr {{suggests}} in {{his analysis}} of the American healthcare system (i.e., The Social Transformation of American Medicine) that Richard Nixon, advised by the [...] "father of Health Maintenance Organizations", Dr. Paul M. Ellwood, Jr., was the first mainstream political leader to take deliberate steps to change American health care from its longstanding not-for-profit business principles into a for-profit model that would be driven by the insurance industry. In 1973, Congress passed the <b>Health</b> <b>Maintenance</b> <b>Organization</b> Act, which encouraged rapid growth of Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs), the first form of managed care.|$|E
2500|$|Proposed in the 1960s by Dr. Paul Elwood in the [...] "Health Maintenance Strategy", the HMO {{concept was}} {{promoted}} by the Nixon administration as a fix to rising health care costs and set in law as the <b>Health</b> <b>Maintenance</b> <b>Organization</b> Act of 1973. As defined in the act, a federally-qualified HMO would, {{in exchange for a}} subscriber fee (premium), allow members access to a panel of employed physicians or a network of doctors and facilities including hospitals. In return, the HMO received mandated market access and could receive federal development funds.|$|E
2500|$|Having overseen Kaiser Permanente's {{successful}} transformation from Henry Kaiser's healthcare experiment into a large-scale self-sustaining enterprise, Keene retired in 1975. By 1976, membership reached three million. In 1977, {{all six of}} Kaiser Permanente's regions had become federally qualified health maintenance organizations. Historians now believe then-President Richard Nixon specifically had Kaiser Permanente {{in mind when he}} signed the <b>Health</b> <b>Maintenance</b> <b>Organization</b> Act of 1973, as the organization was mentioned in an Oval Office discussion of the Act, where John Ehrlichman characterized Kaiser's philosophy thus: [...] "All the incentives are toward less medical care, because the less care they give them, the more money they make." [...] In 1980, Kaiser acquired a non-profit group practice to create its Mid-Atlantic region, encompassing the District of Columbia, Maryland, and Virginia. In 1985, Kaiser Permanente expanded to Georgia.|$|E

2500|$|In August 1970, Democratic Senator Ted Kennedy {{introduced}} legislation {{to establish a}} single-payer universal health care, financed by taxes and with no Cost sharing). In February 1971, Nixon proposed more limited health insurance reform, an employee mandate to offer private health insurance if employees volunteered to pay 25 percent of premiums, the federalization of Medicaid for poor families with dependent minor children, and support for health maintenance organizations (HMOs). This market-based system would, Nixon argued, [...] "build on {{the strengths of the}} private system." [...] Both the House and Senate held hearings on national health insurance in 1971, but no legislation emerged from either committee, as House Ways and Means committee chairman Wilbur Mills or Senate Finance committee chairman Russell Long. In October 1972, Nixon signed the Social Security Amendments of 1972, extending Medicare to those under 65 who had been severely disabled for over two years or had end stage renal disease, and gradually raising the Medicare Part A payroll tax from 1.1 to 1.45 percent (in 1986). In December 1973, he signed the <b>Health</b> <b>Maintenance</b> <b>Organization</b> Act of 1973, establishing a trial federal program to promote and encourage the development of HMOs.|$|E
2500|$|The {{origins of}} the <b>Health</b> <b>Maintenance</b> <b>Organization</b> Act of 1973 are {{presented}} using a taped conversation between John Ehrlichman and President Richard Nixon on February 17, 1971; Ehrlichman is heard telling Nixon that [...] "...the less care they give them, the more money they make," [...] a plan that Nixon remarked [...] "fine" [...] and [...] "not bad." [...] This led {{to the expansion of}} the modern health maintenance organization-based health care system. [...] Connections are highlighted between Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), the lobbying arm of the largest drug companies in the United States, lobbying groups in Washington D.C., and the Congress. [...] Hillary Clinton, a champion of the Clinton health care plan, is shown as a crusader for change, appointed to reform the health care system in the United States by her husband, newly elected President Bill Clinton.

2500|$|Just as {{the more}} loosely managed PPOs have edged out HMOs, HMOs {{themselves}} have also evolved towards less tightly managed models. The first HMOs in the U.S., such as Kaiser Permanente in Oakland, California, and the Health Insurance Plan (HIP) in New York, were [...] "staff-model" [...] HMOs, which owned their own health care facilities and employed the doctors {{and other health care}} professionals who staffed them. The name <b>health</b> <b>maintenance</b> <b>organization</b> stems from the idea that the HMO would make it its job to maintain the enrollee's health, rather than merely to treat illnesses. In accordance with this mission, managed care organizations typically cover preventive health care. Within the tightly integrated staff-model HMO, the HMO can develop and disseminate guidelines on cost-effective care, while the enrollee's primary care doctor can act as patient advocate and care coordinator, helping the patient negotiate the complex health care system. Despite a substantial body of research demonstrating that many staff-model HMOs deliver high-quality and cost-effective care, they have steadily lost market share. They have been replaced by more loosely managed networks of providers with whom health plans have negotiated discounted fees. It is common today for a physician or hospital to have contracts with a dozen or more health plans, each with different referral networks, contracts with different diagnostic facilities, and different practice guidelines.|$|E

40|$|The nation's <b>health</b> <b>maintenance</b> <b>organizations,</b> preferred-provider organizations, {{independent}} practice associations, {{and similar}} managed-care efforts {{are not well}} positioned to take {{a leadership role in}} a nationwide universal access or national health insurance plan. They [...] {{with the possible exception of}} some large staff and group <b>health</b> <b>maintenance</b> <b>organizations</b> [...] have been unable to show uniformly that they can contain costs, provide better access or higher quality of care, and achieve greater patient satisfaction than fee-for-service endeavors. As the United States pursues universal access as a step toward national health insurance, the managed-care plans will continue to increase their numbers of subscribers. They will not, however, be able to enroll large numbers of the young, low-income employees and their dependents who account for most of the 63 million people uninsured sometime during each year. Under national health insurance, there might be an option for some <b>health</b> <b>maintenance</b> <b>organizations</b> to negotiate capitated payments. The vast majority of the nation's physicians, however, will reluctantly embrace a centrally managed fee-for-service approach rather than a salary or capitated reimbursement method, leaving only a trace of the competitive managed-care plan theme in a future, primarily monolithic, national health care system...|$|R
