5|$|Holocene {{lava flows}} are more alkalic than the Pleistocene lava flows and {{comprise}} several xenoliths of chromium-spinel lherzolite, spinel clinopyroxenite, and rare ferroan websterite and spinel wehrlite. Xenoliths {{do not exist}} in the older lava flows. However, chemical <b>evidence</b> <b>indicates</b> <b>that</b> every lava flow was produced in a similar way by low degrees of piecemeal melting. The melts originally came from the upper mantle which, over time, was progressively depleted by every following melting event.|$|E
5|$|Bupropion {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely {{prescribed}} antidepressants, and the available <b>evidence</b> <b>indicates</b> <b>that</b> it is effective in clinical depression — as effective as several other widely prescribed drugs, including fluoxetine (Prozac) and paroxetine (Paxil), although trends favoring the efficacy of escitalopram (Lexapro), sertraline (Zoloft) and venlafaxine (Effexor) over bupropion have been observed. Mirtazapine (Remeron), on the other hand is significantly more effective than bupropion. Bupropion has several features that distinguish it from other antidepressants: for instance, unlike the majority of antidepressants, it does not usually cause sexual dysfunction. Bupropion treatment also is not associated with the sleepiness or weight gain that may be produced by other antidepressants.|$|E

5|$|Fossil <b>evidence</b> <b>indicates</b> <b>that</b> megalodon preyed upon many {{cetacean}} species, such as dolphins, small whales, cetotheres, squalodontids, sperm whales, bowhead whales, and rorquals. In {{addition to}} this, they also targeted seals, sirenians, and large sea turtles. However, the shark {{was also an}} opportunist and piscivorous, {{and it would have}} also gone after smaller fish and other sharks. Many whale bones have been found with deep gashes most likely made by their teeth. Various excavations have revealed megalodon teeth lying close to the chewed remains of whales, and sometimes in direct association with them.|$|E
5|$|Fossil <b>evidence</b> <b>indicates</b> <b>that</b> other notable {{species of}} sharks, {{such as the}} great white shark, responded to {{competitive}} pressure from megalodon by avoiding regions it inhabited by mainly inhabiting the cooler waters of the time. In areas where their ranges seemed to overlap, such as in Pliocene Baja California, {{it is possible that}} megalodon and the great white shark occupied the area at different times of the year while following different migratory prey. Megalodon probably also had a tendency for cannibalism, much like contemporary sharks.|$|E
5|$|From about 700 BCE iron working reached north Britain. There is {{evidence}} for about 1,000 Iron Age hillforts in Scotland, most located below the Clyde-Forth line. The majority are circular, {{with a single}} palisade around an enclosure. They {{appear to have been}} largely abandoned in the Roman period, both in the occupied region and further north in the regions beyond Roman control. This may have been because of the threat posed by Roman incursions, which meant that concentrations of military and political force were vulnerable to incursions and siege. Archaeological <b>evidence</b> <b>indicates</b> <b>that</b> some were reoccupied after their departure.|$|E

50|$|A {{branch of}} the Periyar river, called the Periyar Thodu (Periyar canal), runs close to Pattanam. Satellite imagery, a clear {{geological}} <b>evidence,</b> <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> the Periyar river delta lies on the southern side and the river could have flowed close to Pattanam.Moreover, the residents of Pattanam regularly used to find {{a large amount of}} broken pottery shards and ancient fired bricks while digging the ground. These <b>evidences</b> <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> the Periyar river could have flowed close to Pattanam about 2,000 years ago.|$|R
5|$|Modern <b>evidence</b> <b>indicates</b> <b>that</b> even non-avian {{dinosaurs and}} birds thrived in cooler {{temperate}} climates, {{and that at}} least some early species must have regulated their body temperature by internal biological means (aided by the animals' bulk in large species and feathers or other body coverings in smaller species). Evidence of endothermy in Mesozoic dinosaurs includes the discovery of polar dinosaurs in Australia and Antarctica as well as analysis of blood-vessel structures within fossil bones that are typical of endotherms. Scientific debate continues regarding the specific ways in which dinosaur temperature regulation evolved.|$|E
5|$|Sea otters {{have the}} {{thickest}} fur of any mammal. Their beautiful fur is a main target for many hunters. Archaeological <b>evidence</b> <b>indicates</b> <b>that</b> {{for thousands of}} years, indigenous peoples have hunted sea otters for food and fur. Large-scale hunting, part of the Maritime Fur Trade, which would eventually kill approximately one million sea otters, began in the 18th century when hunters and traders began to arrive {{from all over the}} world to meet foreign demand for otter pelts, which were one of the world's most valuable types of fur.|$|E
5|$|Such {{trafficking}} capacity {{depends on}} the MAM, which {{has been shown to}} facilitate transfer of lipid intermediates between organelles. In contrast to the standard vesicular mechanism of lipid transfer, <b>evidence</b> <b>indicates</b> <b>that</b> the physical proximity of the ER and mitochondrial membranes at the MAM allows for lipid flipping between opposed bilayers. Despite this unusual and seemingly energetically unfavorable mechanism, such transport does not require ATP. Instead, in yeast, it {{has been shown to be}} dependent on a multiprotein tethering structure termed the ER-mitochondria encounter structure, or ERMES, although it remains unclear whether this structure directly mediates lipid transfer or is required to keep the membranes in sufficiently close proximity to lower the energy barrier for lipid flipping.|$|E

5|$|The first {{permanent}} dwellings {{were probably}} built between 3000 and 2000 BC, {{with the introduction}} of agriculture to Norway. Available <b>evidence</b> <b>indicates</b> <b>that</b> wood was the most used building material for these structures. Iron Age dwellings typically combined shelter for animals and humans in long houses in order to preserve heat. Remains of structures from the Stone Age through the Bronze Age and the Iron Age have been excavated at Forsand in Ryfylke, near Stavanger and several other locations. Most prehistoric long houses had pairs of roof-bearing posts dividing the interior into three naves, and walls of palisades, wattle and daub or turf. Similar buildings have been excavated all over Northwestern Europe.|$|E
5|$|The {{highest quality}} <b>evidence</b> <b>indicates</b> <b>that</b> {{circumcision}} does not decrease {{the sensitivity of}} the penis, harm sexual function or reduce sexual satisfaction. A 2013 systematic review found that circumcision did not appear to adversely affect sexual desire, pain with intercourse, premature ejaculation, time until ejaculation, erectile dysfunction or difficulties with orgasm. However, the study found that the existing evidence is not very good. Another 2013 systematic review found that the highest-quality studies reported no adverse effects of circumcision on sexual function, sensitivity, sensation or satisfaction. A 2017 systematic review and meta-analysis found that circumcision did not affect premature ejaculation.|$|E
5|$|The {{nature of}} {{agricultural}} production {{was determined by}} the land and climate. The cold and wet climate meant that more oats and barley were grown than corn. The evidence of bones indicates that cattle were by far the most important domesticated animal, followed by pigs, sheep and goats, while domesticated fowl were very rare. Bone <b>evidence</b> <b>indicates</b> <b>that</b> there was a significant growth in the fish trade around 1000. This increased marine exploitation of the Highlands and Islands may have been {{as a result of the}} arrival of Scandinavian settlers in this period.|$|E

5|$|The primary {{treatment}} of schizophrenia is antipsychotic medications, often {{in combination with}} psychological and social supports. Hospitalization may occur for severe episodes either voluntarily or (if mental health legislation allows it) involuntarily. Long-term hospitalization is uncommon since deinstitutionalization beginning in the 1950s, although it still occurs. Community support services including drop-in centers, visits by members of a community mental health team, supported employment and support groups are common. Some <b>evidence</b> <b>indicates</b> <b>that</b> regular exercise has {{a positive effect on}} the physical and mental health of those with schizophrenia.|$|E
5|$|There is {{evidence}} that ancestors of the fisher migrated to North America during the Pliocene era between 2.5 and 5 million years ago. Two extinct mustelids, M. palaeosinensis and M. anderssoni, {{have been found in}} eastern Asia. The first true fisher, M. divuliana, has only been found in North America. There are strong indications that M. divuliana is related to the Asian finds, which suggests a migration. M. pennanti has been found as early as the Late Pleistocene era, about 125,000 years ago. There are no major differences between the Pleistocene fisher and the modern fisher. Fossil <b>evidence</b> <b>indicates</b> <b>that</b> the fisher's range extended farther south than it does today.|$|E
5|$|Transport links {{generally}} {{are regarded as}} an important factor which affects a company’s decision on where to locate, and thus invest, although the latest survey shows quality of telecommunications moving above transport in importance. Survey <b>evidence</b> <b>indicates</b> <b>that</b> a quarter of companies regard access to air services as {{an important factor in}} the decision of where in the UK to locate operations, whilst one in ten companies report that the absence of good air transport links has affected their decision to invest in the UK. The survey has been criticised as suffering from a poor response rate and therefore open to bias, though this issue has been recognised and rationalised by the report's authors.|$|E
