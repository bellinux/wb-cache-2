5|$|<b>Electric</b> <b>resistance</b> welding (ERW) – a {{welding process}} that {{produces}} coalescence of laying surfaces where heat {{to form the}} weld is generated by the electrical resistance of the material. In general, an efficient method, but limited to relatively thin material.|$|E
5|$|Until {{the end of}} the 19th century, {{the only}} welding process was forge welding, which blacksmiths had used for millenia to join iron and steel by heating and hammering. Arc welding and oxyfuel welding were among the first {{processes}} to develop late in the century, and <b>electric</b> <b>resistance</b> welding followed soon after. Welding technology advanced quickly during the early 20th century as the world wars drove the demand for reliable and inexpensive joining methods. Following the wars, several modern welding techniques were developed, including manual methods like SMAW, now {{one of the most popular}} welding methods, as well as semi-automatic and automatic processes such as GMAW, SAW, FCAW and ESW. Developments continued with the invention of laser beam welding, electron beam welding, magnetic pulse welding (MPW), and friction stir welding in the latter half of the century. Today, the science continues to advance. Robot welding is commonplace in industrial settings, and researchers continue to develop new welding methods and gain greater understanding of weld quality.|$|E

50|$|The {{cryogenic}} current comparator (CCC) {{is used in}} {{the electrical}} precision measurements to compare electric currents with highest accuracy. This device exceeds the accuracy of other current comparators around several orders of magnitude and is used in electrical metrology for highly precise comparative measurements of <b>electric</b> <b>resistances</b> or for the amplification and measurement of extremely small electric currents.|$|R
50|$|This is {{a device}} formed by a {{metallic}} bar (called the agitation bar) which is normally {{covered by a}} plastic layer, and a sheet that has underneath it a rotatory magnet or a series of electromagnets arranged in a circular form to create a magnetic rotatory field. Commonly, the sheet has an arrangement of <b>electric</b> <b>resistances</b> that can heat some chemical solutions.|$|R
25|$|According to the US EPA, {{geothermal}} heat pumps can reduce energy consumption up to 44% compared with air-source heat pumps {{and up to}} 72% compared with <b>electric</b> <b>resistance</b> heating. The COP for heat pumps range from 3.2 to 4.5 for air source heat pumps to 4.2 to 5.2 for ground source heat pumps.|$|E
25|$|On 15 April 2012, {{one of the}} two {{remaining}} temperature-sensors {{at the bottom of the}} No.2 reactor gave false readings, and because the <b>electric</b> <b>resistance</b> was found greatly increased, TEPCO concluded that it was broken, leaving only 18 of 36 temperature sensors still functioning. At 11 a.m., the remaining thermometer at this place measured 46.7 degrees Celsius.|$|E
25|$|For example, a PID loop is used {{to control}} the {{temperature}} of an <b>electric</b> <b>resistance</b> furnace where the system has stabilized. Now when the door is opened and something cold is put into the furnace the temperature drops below the setpoint. The integral function of the controller tends to compensate for error by introducing another error in the positive direction. This overshoot can be avoided by freezing of the integral function after {{the opening of the}} door for the time the control loop typically needs to reheat the furnace.|$|E

25|$|Also, as {{the heat}} pump takes heat {{out of the}} air, some {{moisture}} in the outdoor air may condense and possibly freeze on the outdoor heat exchanger. The system must periodically melt this ice; this defrosting translates into an additional energy (electricity) expenditure. When it is extremely cold outside, it is simpler to heat using an alternative heat source (such as an <b>electric</b> <b>resistance</b> heater, oil furnace, or gas furnace) rather than to run an air-source heat pump. Also, avoiding {{the use of the}} heat pump during extremely cold weather translates into less wear on the machine's compressor.|$|E
25|$|Heat pumps may obtain {{low-grade heat}} from the outdoor air in mild climates. In areas with average winter {{temperatures}} well below freezing, {{ground source heat pumps}} are more efficient than air-source heat pumps because they can extract residual solar heat stored in the ground at warmer temperatures than is available from cold air. According to the US EPA, geothermal heat pumps can reduce energy consumption up to 44% compared with air source heat pumps and up to 72% compared with <b>electric</b> <b>resistance</b> heating. The high purchase price of a heat pump vs resistance heaters may be offset when air conditioning is also needed.|$|E

The developed electrical network model is used to calculate the current and state-of-charge distribution throughout the spiral jelly roll, which can be used to determine electric heat losses.
