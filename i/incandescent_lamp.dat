25|$|The higher {{initial cost}} of a {{fluorescent}} lamp compared with an <b>incandescent</b> <b>lamp</b> is usually more than compensated for by lower energy consumption over its life.|$|E
25|$|In 1841, Frederick de Moleyns of England {{was granted}} the first patent for an <b>incandescent</b> <b>lamp,</b> with a design using {{platinum}} wires contained within a vacuum bulb. He also used carbon.|$|E
5000|$|In {{some types}} of watches, small <b>incandescent</b> <b>lamps</b> or LEDs {{illuminate}} the display, which is not intrinsically luminous. These tend to produce very non-uniform illumination. <b>Incandescent</b> <b>lamps</b> are very wasteful of electricity.|$|R
50|$|The {{three most}} common types of <b>incandescent</b> <b>lamps</b> are {{standard}} <b>incandescent</b> <b>lamps,</b> tungsten halogen lamps, and reflector <b>lamps.</b> Standard <b>incandescent</b> <b>lamps</b> have an efficacy of 10-17 lumens per watts and {{a lifetime of}} 750-2500 hours. Tungsten halogen lamps have an efficacy of 12-22 lumens per watts and a lifetime of 2000-4000 hours. Finally reflector lamps have an efficacy of 12-19 lumens per watts and a lifetime of 2000-3000 hours.|$|R
40|$|All {{over the}} world energy in{{efficient}} <b>incandescent</b> <b>lamps</b> are used in great numbers. Replacement of these inefficient lamps with energy efficient lamps can save energy and reduce energy bills for the consumers. This work discusses how much energy can be saved by replacing <b>incandescent</b> <b>lamps</b> used for task lighting with energy efficient lamps. This replacement results in cost savings and reduction of CO 2 emission. The purpose {{of the work is}} to assess the feasibility of the energy efficient lamps compared to the existing <b>incandescent</b> <b>lamps.</b> The performance of the compact fluorescent lamp (CFL) and light emitting diode (LED) lamps has been measured mainly for task lighting and then compared with that of the <b>incandescent</b> <b>lamps.</b> The performance of 60 W <b>incandescent</b> <b>lamps</b> has been compared with the performance of CFLs of power 11 W to 15 W and LED lamps of power 4 W to 13 W. The performance of these different lamps has been demonstrated through measurements made for both developed and developing countries. The measurements show {{that it is possible to}} replace <b>incandescent</b> <b>lamps</b> used for task lighting with energy efficient CFL and LED lamps have shown very promising results and they have a bright future in lighting...|$|R
25|$|To fit enough {{phosphor}} coated area {{within the}} approximate overall dimensions of an <b>incandescent</b> <b>lamp,</b> standard shapes of CFL tube are a helix {{with one or}} more turns, multiple parallel tubes, circular arc, or a butterfly.|$|E
25|$|Typically a {{fluorescent}} lamp will last 10 to 20 {{times as long}} as an equivalent <b>incandescent</b> <b>lamp</b> when operated several hours at a time. Under standard test conditions general lighting lamps have 9,000 hours or longer service life.|$|E
25|$|The compact {{fluorescent}} lamp (CFL) replaces regular incandescent bulbs. However, some CFLs will not fit some lamps, because the harp (heavy wire shade support bracket) is shaped for the narrow neck of an <b>incandescent</b> <b>lamp,</b> while CFLs {{tend to have a}} wide housing for their electronic ballast close to the lamp's base.|$|E

25|$|In 1897, German {{physicist}} and chemist Walther Nernst developed the Nernst lamp, {{a form of}} <b>incandescent</b> <b>lamp</b> that used a ceramic globar and did not require enclosure in a vacuum or inert gas. Twice as efficient as carbon filament lamps, Nernst lamps were briefly popular until overtaken by lamps using metal filaments.|$|E
25|$|Compared with an <b>incandescent</b> <b>lamp,</b> a {{fluorescent}} tube {{is a more}} diffuse and physically larger light source. In suitably designed lamps, light can be more evenly distributed without point source of glare such as seen from an undiffused incandescent filament; the lamp is large compared to the typical distance between lamp and illuminated surfaces.|$|E
25|$|The liquid filters, {{designed}} by Raymond Davis, Jr. and Kasson S. Gibson in 1931, {{have a relatively}} high absorbance at the red end of the spectrum, effectively increasing the CCT of the <b>incandescent</b> <b>lamp</b> to daylight levels. This is similar in function to a CTO color gel that photographers and cinematographers use today, albeit much less convenient.|$|E

25|$|In 1850 Swan {{began working}} on a light bulb using {{carbonized}} paper filaments in an evacuated glass bulb. By 1860 {{he was able to}} demonstrate a working device, and obtained a British patent covering a partial vacuum, carbon filament <b>incandescent</b> <b>lamp.</b> However, the lack of a good vacuum and an adequate electric source resulted in an inefficient light bulb with a short lifetime.|$|E
25|$|In 1980, Philips {{introduced}} its model SL, {{which was a}} screw-in or bayonet mount lamp with integral magnetic ballast. The lamp used a folded T4 tube, stable tri-color phosphors, and a mercury amalgam. This was the first successful screw-in replacement for an <b>incandescent</b> <b>lamp.</b> In 1985, Osram started selling its model EL lamp, {{which was the first}} CFL to include an electronic ballast.|$|E
25|$|The first private residence, {{other than}} the inventor's, lit by the new <b>incandescent</b> <b>lamp</b> was that of his friend, Sir William Armstrong at Cragside, near Rothbury, Northumberland. Swan {{personally}} supervised the installation there in December 1880. Swan had formed 'The Swan Electric Light Company Ltd' with a factory at Benwell, Newcastle, and had established the first commercial manufacture of incandescent lightbulbs {{by the beginning of}} 1881.|$|E

25|$|In their ROs, Gibson used <b>incandescent</b> <b>lamps,</b> which {{required}} relatively large currents. Fender {{replaced them with}} neon lamps, which increased the modulation frequency and reduced the controlling currents. However, {{in contrast to the}} continuous modulation by Gibson, Fender used the on/off switching mode that resulted in less pleasant sound. For this reason, other producers like Univibe preferred <b>incandescent</b> <b>lamps.</b>|$|R

25|$|The CRI of a {{light source}} does not {{indicate}} the apparent color of the light source; that information is {{under the rubric of}} the correlated color temperature (CCT). The CRI is determined by the light source's spectrum. The pictures on the right show the continuous spectrum of an <b>incandescent</b> <b>lamp</b> and the discrete line spectrum of a fluorescent lamp; the former lamp has the higher CRI.|$|E
25|$|High CCT {{lighting}} generally requires higher light levels. At dimmer illumination levels, {{the human}} eye perceives lower color temperatures as more pleasant, as related through the Kruithof curve. So, a dim 2700 K <b>incandescent</b> <b>lamp</b> appears comfortable and a bright 5000 K lamp also appears natural, but a dim 5000 K fluorescent lamp appears too pale. Daylight-type fluorescents look natural {{only if they are}} very bright.|$|E
25|$|Fluorescent lamps convert more of {{the input}} power to visible light than {{incandescent}} lamps, though as of 2013 LEDs are sometimes even more efficient and are more rapidly increasing in efficiency. A typical 100 watt tungsten filament <b>incandescent</b> <b>lamp</b> may convert only 5% of its power input to visible white light (400–700nm wavelength), whereas typical fluorescent lamps convert about 22% of the power input to visible white light.|$|E

25|$|In the Soviet Union, ROs {{were used}} for signal {{compression}} in long-distance telephony. The <b>incandescent</b> <b>lamp</b> of the RO {{was connected to the}} output of the operational amplifier, and the photoresistor was part of a voltage divider in the feedback circuit of a non-inverting amplifier. Depending on the output voltage, the gain of the circuit varied from 1:1 to 1:10. Similar circuits are still used in professional audio equipment (compressors, limiters and noise suppressors).|$|E
25|$|Incandescent bulbs are {{manufactured}} {{in a wide}} range of sizes, light output, and voltage ratings, from 1.5 volts to about 300 volts. They require no external regulating equipment, have low manufacturing costs, and work equally well on either alternating current or direct current. As a result, the <b>incandescent</b> <b>lamp</b> is widely used in household and commercial lighting, for portable lighting such as table lamps, car headlamps, and flashlights, and for decorative and advertising lighting.|$|E
25|$|Halogen lamps are {{a type of}} <b>incandescent</b> <b>lamp</b> with {{improved}} efficiency over regular incandescent lamps. Though not as energy efficient as other alternatives, they are up to 40 percent more efficient than standard incandescent lamps designed for a 2000-hour life. Depending on size, voltage, and designed life, small low-voltage halogen lamps can have 70% higher efficacy than large line-voltage lamps. The high operating temperature of halogen bulbs may be a safety hazard in some applications.|$|E
5|$|Krypton {{is mixed}} with argon in energy {{efficient}} fluorescent lamps, reducing the power consumption, but also reducing the light output and raising the cost. Krypton costs about 100 {{times as much as}} argon. Krypton (along with xenon) is also used to fill <b>incandescent</b> <b>lamps</b> to reduce filament evaporation and allow higher operating temperatures. A brighter light results with more blue color than conventional <b>incandescent</b> <b>lamps.</b>|$|R
