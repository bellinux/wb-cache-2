5|$|Addington Long Barrow is a {{chambered}} long barrow {{located near}} {{to the village of}} Addington in the southeastern English county of Kent. Constructed during Britain's Early Neolithic period, today it survives only in a ruined state. Built out of earth and around fifty local sarsen megaliths, the long barrow consisted of a sub-rectangular earthen tumulus enclosed by kerb-stones. Collapsed stones on the northeastern end of the chamber probably represented a stone chamber <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>human</b> remains might have been deposited; none, however, have been discovered.|$|E

50|$|Both Hesiod and Ovid offered {{accounts}} of the successive ages of humanity, which tend to progress from an original, long-gone age <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>humans</b> enjoyed a nearly divine existence to the current age of the writer, <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>humans</b> are beset by innumerable pains and evils. In the two accounts that survive from ancient Greece and Rome, this degradation {{of the human condition}} over time is indicated symbolically with metals of successively decreasing value.|$|R
5|$|Having survived {{until the}} end of the time stop, the LEP is bound by law and leaves the {{remaining}} gold and departs. At the end, Butler demands an explanation as to how Artemis came up with the idea of using sleeping pills. Artemis explains that he had gotten the idea from old fairy tales, <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>human</b> characters never wake up at an inopportune moment for the fairies, and had guessed that time-stops were the reason. Concluding that the time-stop forces a being to stay in whichever state of consciousness they were in when the time-stop is started, Artemis uses sleeping pills to break out of the time-stop. Artemis finds his mother has fully recovered from her insanity thanks to Holly's magic.|$|E
5|$|The hardy plants Robinson {{endorsed}} {{were not}} all natives by any means: two chapters {{are devoted to}} the hardy plants from other temperate climate zones that were appropriate to naturalising schemes. The narcissus he preferred were the small, delicate ones from the Iberian peninsula. Meadowflowers included goldenrod and asters, rampant spreaders from North America long familiar in English gardens. Nor did Robinson's 'wild' approach refer to letting gardens return to their natural state—he taught a specific gardening method and aesthetic. The nature of plants' habit of growth and their cultural preferences dictated the free design, <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>human</b> intervention was to be kept undetectable.|$|E

25|$|The 1987 looting of a 500-year-old burial mound at the Slack Farm in Kentucky, <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>human</b> {{remains were}} tossed {{to the side}} while relics were stolen, made {{national}} news and helped to galvanize popular support for protection of Native American graves. Likewise, several protests at the Dickson Mounds site in Illinois, where numerous Indian skeletons were exposed on display, also increased national awareness of the issue.|$|E
25|$|In 1981, the new American {{corporation}} Genentech, after {{collaboration with}} Kabi, developed and started trials of recombinant {{human growth hormone}} (rHGH) made by a new technology (recombinant DNA) <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>human</b> genes were inserted into bacteria {{so that they could}} produce unlimited amounts of the protein.

25|$|Although BPM {{initially}} {{focused on}} the automation of business processes {{with the use of}} information technology, it has since been extended to integrate human-driven processes <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>human</b> interaction takes place in series or parallel with the use of technology. For example, workflow management systems can assign individual steps requiring deploying human intuition or judgment to relevant humans and other tasks in a workflow to a relevant automated system.|$|E
25|$|His satirical works {{depict the}} second world, <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>human</b> flaws are caricatured {{with little regard}} for actual or {{historical}} truth. Though critics call attention to these anachronisms and narrative inconsistencies, it's possible that Vicente considered these errors trivial in his portrayals of an already false and imperfect world. In contrast, his representations of the mythic, symbolic, and religious aspects of Christmas, such as the figure of the Virgin Mother, the infant Jesus, and Christmas eve, demonstrate a harmony and purity which is not present in his social commentary.|$|E
25|$|The bio-toilets, {{which have}} been {{developed}} by the railways and the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), have a colony of anaerobic bacteria, kept in a container under the lavatories that convert human waste into water and small amounts of gases. The gases are released into the atmosphere and the water is discharged after chlorination on to the track. The railways currently uses flush toilets in trains, <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>human</b> waste is dumped directly on the track. This makes the environment unhygienic and railway stations an eyesore, apart {{from the fact that}} the faecal matter corrodes the tracks.|$|E

25|$|The discoveries {{published}} by Adolf Schulten in 1922 first {{drew attention to}} Tartessos and shifted its study from classical philologists and antiquarians, to investigations based on archaeology, though attempts at localizing a capital for what was conceived as a complicated culture {{in the nature of}} a centrally controlled kingdom ancestral to Spain were inconclusively debated. Subsequent discoveries were widely reported: in September 1923 archaeologists discovered a Phoenician necropolis <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>human</b> remains were unearthed and stones found with illegible characters. It may have been colonized by the Phoenicians for trade because of its richness in metals.|$|E
25|$|In 2010, Diamond co-edited (with James Robinson) Natural Experiments of History, a {{collection}} of seven case studies illustrating the multidisciplinary and comparative approach {{to the study of}} history that he advocates. The book’s title {{stems from the fact that}} it is not possible to study history by the preferred methods of the laboratory sciences, i.e., by controlled experiments comparing replicated human societies as if they were test tubes of bacteria. Instead, one must look at natural experiments <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>human</b> societies that are similar in many respects have been historically perturbed, either by different starting conditions or by different impacts. The book’s afterword classifies natural experiments, discusses the practical difficulties of studying them, and offers suggestions how to address those difficulties.|$|E

[...] Seated on Earth, the government uses {{military force to}} suppress colonial uprisings. [...] The ADAN Alliance, formed by colonists of four star-systems, initially engaged in politics to seek independence for their worlds. [...] The central government's responded by destroying the terraforming facilities of an alliance planet, Acheron, killing many colonists and turning the world inhospitable.

500|$|Constructed {{during the}} Neolithic, cairns in the Severn-Cotswold {{tradition}} share several characteristics: an elongated trapezoidal (or wedge) shape up to [...] long; a cairn (a mound of deliberately placed stones or rocks erected {{as a memorial}} or marker); a revetment (retaining wall) of carefully constructed dry-stone walling that also defines a horned forecourt at the widest end; huge capstones supported by orthostats; and a chamber (or chambers) <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>human</b> remains were placed, accessible after the cairn was completed {{by way of a}} gallery (passageway). Diverse internal transept chamber plans exist within the group. The earlier tombs contained multiple chambers set laterally, or pairs of transept chambers leading from a central passageway; the later, terminally chambered tombs, contained a single chamber.|$|E
500|$|The {{book has}} been widely praised by genre commentators, {{academic}} critics, and literary reviewers. [...] Fellow science fiction writer Algis Budrys praised the novel as [...] "a narrative so fully realized, so compellingly told, so masterfully executed". He found the book [...] "a novel written by a magnificent writer, a totally compelling tale of human peril and striving under circumstances <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>human</b> love, {{and a number of}} other human qualities, can be depicted in a fresh context". Darko Suvin, one of the first academics to study science fiction, wrote that Left Hand was the [...] "most memorable novel of the year", and Charlotte Spivack regards the book as having established Le Guin's status as a major science-fiction writer. [...] In 1987 Harold Bloom described The Left Hand of Darkness as Le Guin's [...] "finest work to date", and argued that critics have generally undervalued it. Bloom followed this up by listing the book in his The Western Canon (1994) as one of the books in his conception of artistic works that have been important and influential in Western culture. In Bloom's opinion, [...] "Le Guin, more than Tolkien, has raised fantasy into high literature, for our time".|$|E
