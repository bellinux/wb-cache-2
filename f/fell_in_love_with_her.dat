In her teens Victoria <b>fell</b> <b>in</b> <b>love</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> {{maternal}} first cousin Grand Duke Kirill Vladimirovich of Russia, but the disapprobation of marriage between first cousins of his faith, Orthodox Christianity, discouraged their romance. Instead, bowing to family pressure, Victoria married in 1894 a paternal first cousin, Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse and by Rhine, following the wishes of their shared grandmother, Queen Victoria. Their marriage was a failure. Victoria scandalized the royal families of Europe when she divorced her husband in 1901.

His sister Elizabeth and her husband James Dutton were also visiting, with Dutton's sister Jane, and Coke <b>fell</b> <b>in</b> <b>love</b> <b>with</b> <b>her.</b> Wenman was not impressed when Coke asked him to let them be married, as he had picked out the daughter of a baronet for his son, but with the intercession of Wenman's friend Harbord Harbord, he finally consented to their marriage, which occurred on 5 October 1775.|$|E

Badly injured, he was rescued by a woman named Chie and {{eventually}} <b>fell</b> <b>in</b> <b>love</b> <b>with</b> <b>her.</b> While out one day, a fight broke out at the inn and Chie {{was believed to be}} dead. Told falsely the swordsman Heishirō Mitsurugi was responsible, he set out after Soul Edge knowing Mitsurugi was also after the blade. Along the way he takes the weapons of other fighters he defeats, repurposing some for his own use. Upon finding and defeating him, he realized Mitsurugi had no part in the attack upon Chie, and continued his goal of searching for Soul Edge. He located its wielder, Cervantes, but was beaten severely. Revealed to have survived in Soulcalibur III but having lost an eye, he found himself on the run from assassins sent by his former employer. Traveling by night under a false name, he was taken in by a girl that reminded him of Chie. When the assassins eventually found him, Li Long stood his ground and defeated them. Remembering the feel of fighting for something other than revenge, he set out to find himself, not knowing that Chie was actually alive and, after giving birth to their son, had set out to find him.|$|E

Vincent joins the group when he learns that they may eventually meet up with Hojo, against whom Vincent has an unexplained vendetta.

While serving as Lucrecia's guard, he <b>fell</b> <b>in</b> <b>love</b> <b>with</b> <b>her,</b> but she ultimately decided to remain faithful to Hojo, who persuaded her to use her unborn baby in his experiments. When protesting about the nature of these experiments, Vincent was shot by Hojo, who subsequently began to experiment on him as well.
