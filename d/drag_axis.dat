40|$|A {{monocoque}} {{box beam}} {{consisting of a}} 24 S-T aluminum-alloy sheet reinforced by four bulkheads and by longitudinal stringers and corner posts was subjected to bending loads as follows: pure bending about the lift axis, cantilever bending about the lift axis, and pure bending about both lift and <b>drag</b> <b>axis.</b> Longitudinal strains were measured for loads up to a load at which permanent set became measurable. The loads were sufficient to produce buckling of the sheet between stringers on the compression side of the box. The only noticeable effect of this buckling was a small increase in extreme-fiber strain on the compression side. The measured strains and measured deflections differed less than 10 percent from those computed from the simple beam theory after taking account of the effective width of the buckled sheet. The effect of the bulkheads {{on the distribution of}} stringer strain was negligible...|$|E

40|$|Compared with a drag-type {{vertical}} axis wind turbines, {{one of the}} greatest advantages for a lift-type {{vertical axis}} wind turbines is its higher power coefficient (Cp). However, the lift-type vertical axis wind turbines is not a self-starting turbine as its starting torque is very low. In order to combine the advantage of both the drag-type and the lift-type vertical axis wind turbines, a lift <b>drag</b> hybrid vertical <b>axis</b> wind turbines was designed in this article and its aerodynamics and starting performance was studied in detail with the aid of computational fluid dynamics simulations. Numerical results indicate that the power coefficient of this lift <b>drag</b> hybrid vertical <b>axis</b> wind turbines declines when the distance between its drag-type blades and the center of rotation of the turbine rotor increases, whereas its starting torque can be significantly improved. Studies also show that unlike the lift-type vertical axis wind turbines, this lift <b>drag</b> hybrid-type vertical <b>axis</b> wind turbines could be able {{to solve the problem of}} low start-up torque. However, the installation position of the drag blade is very important. If the drag blade is mounted very close to the spindle, the starting torque of the lift <b>drag</b> hybrid-type vertical <b>axis</b> wind turbines may not be improved at all. In addition, it has been found that the power coefficient of the studied vertical axis wind turbines is not as good as expected and possible reasons have been provided in this article after the pressure distribution along the surfaces of the airfoil-shaped blades of the hybrid turbine was analyzed...|$|R

40|$|The axes of {{gyroscopes}} experimentally define non-rotating frames. But what physical cause {{governs the}} time-evolution of gyroscope axes? Starting from an unperturbed, spatially flat FRW cosmology, we consider cosmological vorticity perturbations (i. e. vector perturbations, rotational perturbations) at the linear level. We ask: Will cosmological rotational perturbations <b>drag</b> the <b>axis</b> of a gyroscope {{relative to the}} directions (geodesics) to galaxies beyond the rotational perturbation? We cast the laws of Gravitomagnetism into a form showing clearly the close correspondence with the laws of ordinary magnetism. Our results are: 1) The dragging of a gyroscope axis by rotational perturbations beyond the ˙H radius (H = Hubble constant) is exponentially suppressed. 2) If the perturbation is a homogeneous rotation inside a radius significantly larger than the ˙ H radius, then the dragging of the gyroscope axis by the rotational perturbation is exact for any equation of state for cosmological matter. 3) The time-evolution of a gyroscope axis exactly follows a specific average of the matter inside the ˙ H radius for any equation of state. In this precise sense Mach’s Principle follows from cosmology with Einstein Gravity...|$|R

While many games and other virtual world applications include real-time simulation of rigid bodies, fluids and gasses have proven harder to animate efficiently. This report describes {{a method for}} extending previous work with particle systems to efficiently simulate smoke that interacts with rigid bodies, using an existing rigid body simulator. The method is applicable compressible fluids and gasses other than smoke. Although the animations produced by this method are not physically correct, they exhibit the phenomenology of real smoke, including dissipation, vortices, and compression. The animations can also be controlled through aesthetically meaningful parameters like <b>drag</b> and vortex <b>axis.</b> Thus the simulator is wellsuited to applications where interactive performance and expressive power are preferred to realism; for example, video games and rapid development of animation. ...|$|R
40|$|Because {{ocean wave}} propagates along water surface, wave energy {{resource}} {{is measured in}} the unit of line density (kW/m). It indicates that the output of a Wave Energy Converter (WEC) is proportional to its wave front width {{when we consider the}} scaling-up of the device. It will be a problem in the commercialization of a scaled-up WEC because the cost of device increases with size in a higher pace. With the above consideration, the authors proposed a rotary type wave energy converter. It is a <b>drag</b> type vertical <b>axis</b> water turbine with its rotational axis lying horizontally on the water surface and in parallel to the wave front. To capture the orbital fluid particle motion in wave, the turbine is composed of a bucket and a streamlined counter weight. The device can be linearly extended in the direction parallel to the wave front to obtain the merits of scale. The WEC does not have massive components because the reaction torque of electric generation can be absorbed by a relatively small float system. This paper provides the numerical test of the device in deep water wave condition. The dependencies of the output to the wave height and the submergence of the rotational axis are checked by the two-dimensional flow simulation. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{show that}} the <b>dragging</b> of the <b>axis</b> {{directions}} of local inertial frames by a weighted average of the energy currents in the universe is exact for all linear perturbations of any Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) universe with K = (+ 1, - 1, 0) and of Einstein's static closed universe. This includes FRW universes which are arbitrarily close to the Milne Universe, which is empty, and to the de Sitter universe. Hence the postulate formulated by E. Mach about the physical cause for the time-evolution of the axis directions of inertial frames is shown to hold in cosmological General Relativity for linear perturbations. The time-evolution of axis directions of local inertial frames (relative to given local fiducial axes) is given experimentally by the precession angular velocity of gyroscopes, {{which in turn is}} given by the operational definition of the gravitomagnetic field. The gravitomagnetic field is caused by cosmological energy currents via the momentum constraint. This equation for cosmological gravitomagnetism is analogous to Ampere's law, but it holds also for time-dependent situtations. In the solution for an open universe the 1 /r^ 2 -force of Ampere is replaced by a Yukawa force which is of identical form for FRW backgrounds with $K = (- 1, 0). $ The scale of the exponential cutoff is the H-dot radius, where H is the Hubble rate, and dot is the derivative with respect to cosmic time. Analogous results hold for energy currents in a closed FRW universe, K = + 1, and in Einstein's closed static universe. Comment: 23 pages, no figures. Final published version.

40|$|The {{gap between}} the supply and the demand of {{electricity}} is rapidly increasing throughout the world, due to the decommissioning of old coal-fired power plants, and the stringent regulations on carbon emissions. Power suppliers need renewable energy generating technologies which are both environment friendly and sustainable in a long term. The requirement of renewable technologies is resulting in an increased financing of {{the research and development}} in the solar and wind energy sectors. This increase in the research and development in these renewable sectors can be observed all across the developed world and in particular, the European Union, {{as a result of its}} commitment to its Renewable Energy Directive. In the United Kingdom, the wind energy sector has predominantly grown in the recent years, with the construction of multiple wind farms, both on-shore and off-shore. This is resulting in significant advancement in the designs of large wind turbines. However, the abundantly available wind energy in the urban areas is still an energy source to be explored. The current research study is aimed at exploring the design and analysis methodologies of small-to-medium sized wind turbines for urban applications, as the published research in this area is severely limited. A <b>drag</b> based Vertical <b>Axis</b> Wind Turbine (VAWT) has been considered in the present study as these types of VAWTs are more suitable for urban environments. Such VAWTs operate at lower wind speeds, have multidirectional structure, simpler construction, lower manufacturing and maintenance costs, robust design, long lasting operational life, smaller size, low level of noise and vibrations, and possess the ability to self-start and be packed closer together. Improvements to the standard drag based VAWT designs are required to make the best use of their inherent design benefits, which coupled with a more refined and effective design can lead to a wide spread use of drag based VAWTs in urban centres, increasing renewable energy production. Detailed investigates on the effects of various innovative geometrical features on the performance of the VAWT have been carried out. This has been achieved through the use of advanced Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) based techniques. The first aspect of the study is to carry out a detailed flow diagnostics of a standard drag based VAWT (the baseline model). Various innovative geometrical features have then been integrated with the baseline model to analyse their effects on the performance of the model. For this purpose, three dimensional models of the VAWT have been numerically analysed for the flow of dry and clean air in urban environments. Furthermore, sliding mesh technique has been employed to rotate the rotor of the VAWT. An in-depth qualitative and quantitative analysis of the global and local flow related parameters has been carried out, while instantaneous torque variations have been monitored throughout the rotation of the VAWT. The second aspect of the study is to critically analyse the start-up process (accelerating rotor) in order to determine the entire operating range of a helical VAWT design. Advanced CFD based technique, known as dynamic mesh, has been employed for this purpose. The advantage of dynamic mesh over sliding mesh is that sliding mesh assumes a constant operating point of the VAWT, while dynamic mesh generates the complete performance map of the VAWT; from the start-up to the constant operating point. Hence, the use of dynamic mesh technique is essential in understanding the transient accelerating behaviour of the VAWT. The third aspect of the current study is to develop an innovative in-house built CFD package for aerodynamic design analysis of VAWTs. The developed package is based on existing open source CFD solvers. Predictions from the developed package have been validated against a well-known and widely used commercial CFD software (ANSYS). The developed package has been shown to predict the complex flow structures in the vicinity of the VAWT, and its performance parameters, with reasonable accuracy, and hence can be used as an inexpensive tool for CFD based design analysis of VAWTs for small-to-medium sized enterprises (SMEs) ...|$|R
