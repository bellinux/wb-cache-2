Later generations gave the land to the many black members of the Lacks family who were descendants of African slaves and their white owners.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 2010, the {{development}} team spent five days and four nights <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>called</b> the Capcom Manor {{to work on the}} game; this was inspired by the filmmaker Akira Kurosawa, who would gather scriptwriters in a hotel room to create the scripts for his films. During their stay in the manor, they discussed the game's plot and the new gameplay system, finalized the direction, and created rough sketches for most characters in the game. For the new character Hakari Mikagami, Iwamoto used a female saint as the main image for her design, and imagined her as being an older woman he could look up to. Another new character, Yumihiko Ichiyanagi, was Eshiro's favorite minor character in the series because of his character arc and how he grows throughout the game. The game was developed for the Ace Attorney series' tenth anniversary; because of this, several characters from previous games in the series made cameo appearances, including Frank Sahwit and Will Powers.|$|E

5|$|The college {{suffered}} {{during the}} invasions of the Saxons and the Danes and {{was destroyed by}} the Vikings in 987 and again by the Normans in the late 11th century. However, in 1111, it is documented as being restored, but likely in a lesser state than the original. It {{is known to have}} continued to function as a monastic school until the 16th-century Reformation. The ruins of the original school house are located in a garden on the northern end of the churchyard and the monastic halls were located <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>called</b> Hill-head {{on the north side of}} the tithe-barn. Although nothing of the original monastery remains, the present church was originally built between 950 and 1400 and its earliest existing secular buildings date from the 15th century. The church and school became the property of Tewkesbury Abbey around 1130 after becoming part of the Norman kingdom of Glamorgan.|$|E

Omeljan Pritsak holds the first view to be the correct one, since having been to a {{neighbouring}} parish hardly merits a mention on a runestone.

25|$|Around 100,000 years ago, the {{territory}} of modern Baku and Absheron was savanna with rich flora and fauna. Traces of human settlement {{go back to the}} Stone age. From the Bronze age there have been rock carvings discovered near Bayil, and a bronze figure of a small fish discovered in {{the territory}} of the Old City. These have led some to suggest the existence of a Bronze Age settlement within the city's territory. Near Nardaran, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>called</b> Umid Gaya, a prehistoric observatory was discovered, where on the rock the images of sun and various constellations are carved together with a primitive astronomic table. Further archeological excavations revealed various prehistoric settlements, native temples, statues and other artifacts within {{the territory of}} the modern city and around it.|$|E
25|$|Several {{lines of}} family {{tradition}}, however, say that Campbell {{lived with the}} Lenape <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>called</b> Newcomerstown which is further south in eastern Ohio. This tradition tends to confirm Campbell's association with Netawatwees, since Newcomerstown was named after its founder Netawatwees (Newcomer). If, as this suggests, Mary's association with the group headed by Netawatwees is accepted, then both the local tradition of Mary Campbell's stay near Cuyahoga Falls {{as well as the}} family traditions which place her in Newcomerstown are probably correct. What is historically known of Netawatwees indicates that he established his people near Cuyahoga Falls from late in 1758 or early 1759. This would correspond with a period early in Mary Campbell's captivity, since she was abducted in May 1758. It is also known that he later moved with his group to eastern Ohio and there founded Newcomerstown.|$|E
25|$|According to {{the terms}} of the Treaty of Hudaybiyyah, the Arab tribes were given the option of joining either of the parties, the Muslims or Quraysh. Should any of these tribes face aggression, the party to which it was allied would have the right to retaliate. As a consequence, Banu Bakr joined Quraysh, and Khuza'ah joined Muhammad. They thus lived in peace for some time; but ulterior motives {{stretching}} back to the pre-Islamic period, ignited by unabated fire of revenge, triggered fresh hostilities. Banu Bakr, without concern for the provisions of the treaty, attacked Banu Khuza'a <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>called</b> Al-Wateer in Sha'ban, in 8 AH. Quraysh helped Banu Bakr with men and arms, taking advantage of the dark night. Pressed by their enemies, the tribesmen of Khuza'ah sought the Holy Sanctuary, but here too, their lives were not spared, and, contrary to all accepted traditions, Nawfal, the chief of Banu Bakr, chased them in the sanctified area — where no blood should be shed — and massacred his adversaries. Khuza'ah at once sent a delegation to Medina to inform Muhammad, of this breach of truce and to seek help from Muslims of Medina being their allies.|$|E

25|$|Philo T. Farnsworth {{was born}} August 19, 1906, {{the eldest of}} five {{children}} of Lewis Edwin Farnsworth and Serena Amanda Bastian, a Mormon couple then living in a small log cabin built by Lewis's father <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>called</b> Indian Creek near Beaver, Utah. In 1918, {{the family moved to}} a relative's 240-acre ranch near Rigby, Idaho, where Lewis supplemented his farming income by hauling freight with his horse-drawn wagon. Philo was excited to find his new home was wired for electricity, with a Delco generator providing power for lighting and farm machinery. He was a quick student in mechanical and electrical technology, repairing the troublesome generator, and upon finding a burned out electric motor among some items discarded by the previous tenants, proceeding to rewind the armature and convert his mother's hand-powered washing machine into an electric-powered one. Philo developed an early interest in electronics after his first telephone conversation with an out-of-state relative and the discovery of a large cache of technology magazines in the attic of the family’s new home, and won a $25 first prize in a pulp-magazine contest for inventing a magnetized car lock. Farnsworth was Mormon.|$|E
25|$|J.O. Olubobokun in {{his works}} – Itan Iyin (1980) as corroborated by A.O. Oguntuyi (1986:9) {{asserted}} that Iyin {{is one of}} the subordinate towns of Ado-Ekiti founded by Oluyin Agbogbomaje, e.g. the sword bearer (Oluda) who accompanied Ewi Awamaro to settle in Ado before he was allocated land to the West of Ado town and settled <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>called</b> Uro where he was later joined by people of Ibedoyin, Oketoro and Okelawe in forming a total of 16 quarters which later truncated into one town. The essence here is that Iyin people were part of Ado Kingdom that gained royal autonomy to co-exist as separate community under the realm of the Ewi without severing traditional ties and blood relations with Ewi and Ado people. The deep traditional relationship that existed between the Ewi of Ado-Ekiti, the Oluyin of Iyin-Ekiti and the Onigbemo of Igbemo-Ekiti for instance requiring those rulers of the subordinate towns around Ado-Ekiti to participate in specific rites at the death or installation of Ewi of Ado-Ekiti tends to highlight the role of covenant renewal in the community for the continuity of Ewi’s ‘imperial’ or hegemonic status and influence in the subordinate Towns.|$|E
25|$|If {{the match}} is not ended by a fall, {{technical}} fall, default, or disqualification, the referee then prepares both wrestlers {{to begin the}} second period. After the first period ends, one wrestler will have the choice of starting position in the second period. In dual meets, this {{is determined by the}} colored disk toss that took place before the meet began. In tournaments, the referee will toss a colored disk, with a green-colored side and a red-colored side, and the winner of that disk toss will have the choice of position. The wrestler could choose between the neutral position, or as is most commonly chosen to begin <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>called</b> the referee's position on the mat. The referee's position has both wrestlers beginning action {{at the center of the}} mat with one wrestler (in the defensive starting position) on the bottom with his hands spread apart in front of the forward starting line and his knees spread apart behind the rear starting line with his legs held together. The other wrestler on the top (in the offensive starting position) then kneels beside him with one arm wrapped around the bottom wrestler's waist (with the palm of his hand against the opponent's navel) and the other hand on or over the back of the opponent's near elbow for control. Most often, the wrestler with the choice chooses the defensive (bottom) position because of the relative ease of scoring an escape or reversal in comparison to a near fall. The wrestler could also defer his choice to the beginning of the third period.|$|E
