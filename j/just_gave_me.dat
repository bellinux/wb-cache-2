500|$|... "Radio Bart" [...] {{was written}} by Jon Vitti and {{directed}} by Carlos Baeza, though series creator Matt Groening {{came up with the}} idea for it. The episode was based on the 1951 film Ace in the Hole, which sees the story of a down-and-out journalist exploiting a story about a man trapped in a cave to re-jump start his career. Vitti did not watch the film until after the episode had been written; [...] " [...] came in out of nowhere and <b>just</b> <b>gave</b> <b>me,</b> start to finish, the whole story." [...] Vitti said renting the film was the first thing he did after finishing the script. He remarked, [...] "It's surprisingly hard to rent. It's really dark and funny and it's by Billy Wilder, so you think it would be in stores, but it's not. It was hard to find." ...|$|E
500|$|In April 1987, Bakshi set up {{a meeting}} with Judy Price, the head of CBS's Saturday morning block. Three days before the meeting, Bakshi, Kricfalusi, Naylor, Tom Minton, Eddie Fitzgerald and Jim Reardon met to brainstorm. Bakshi remembers, [...] "My car was packed to the windows. Judy was my last stop before driving cross country back to New York to my family." [...] Price {{rejected}} Bakshi's prepared pitches, but asked what else he had. He told her that he had the rights to Mighty Mouse, and she agreed to purchase the series. However, Bakshi did not own the rights and did not know who did. While researching the rights, he learned that CBS had acquired the entire Terrytoons library in 1955 and forgotten about it. According to Bakshi, [...] "I sold them a show they already owned, so they <b>just</b> <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> the rights for nothin'!" ...|$|E
500|$|... "The Door" [...] {{marks the}} final {{appearance}} of Kristian Nairn as Hodor, a role Nairn has played since the series pilot. Nairn, who was cast to play Hodor from previously knowing Game of Thrones casting director from an audition {{he did for}} the film Hot Fuzz, admitted {{in an interview that}} he was at first unaware of his impending death in the show. He stated, [...] "First I heard from friends, people who had read the script, some other cast members. I think I said laughingly, [...] "So did I survive?" [...] They <b>just</b> <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> a look, and I was like, [...] "Whaat?" [...] Then I had the call from David and Dan, the fateful call everyone gets when your number's up. Then I read the script – which I loved. I loved the scene. I can't think of a better way to go, really. He doesn't give up. He never lets go of that door. For all costs, he's going to stop them from getting to Bran." [...] Reflecting on playing the role, Nairn also went on to note, [...] "People always joke, [...] "Oh you've got the easiest role, you don't have any lines to learn." [...] Anyone who knows anything about acting has been like, [...] "You actually have one of the hardest roles." [...] Because you have to articulate so much without words." ...|$|E

2500|$|Luckett {{was born}} on March 11, 1981, in Houston, Texas. She grew up singing in her local Brentwood Baptist Church. She also took vocal lessons to become an opera singer. Her father, {{who was also a}} singer, was very proud of his daughter's vocal talents and tried to get her in the music business. Luckett is the older of two children. Luckett was given the chance to sing her first solo at the age of five. [...] "The lady <b>just</b> <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> the mic one Sunday and I sang," [...] she recalled. Shortly thereafter, she joined the children's choir and began {{performing}} in plays at her elementary school. One day, she walked to her desk in class to find a girl sitting in her seat. Luckett asked her teacher to remove the girl (who turned out to be Beyoncé Knowles) from her assigned seat. They later became friends and she was invited to join Beyoncé's singing group Girls Tyme, which later became Destiny's Child.|$|E

6000|$|I {{walked right}} into the ward. There was a new nurse feeding little Albert. [...] "Hold on," [...] I said. [...] "That ain't the way. Don't you see how he's {{twisting}} that left eye?

[...] Mebbe she thought I was a new doctor, for she <b>just</b> <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> the spoon, and I guess I filled little Albert up with the most comfortable meal he'd had since I went away.

I have met several people we know well this morning. Some of them <b>just</b> <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> a nod, as much as to say, we see you, but don't want to speak to you. Others nodded, as if they {{would have liked to have}} stopped and chatted with me, but were rather afraid to do so; while Tom Fernlea and two other fellows came up and shook hands just as heartily as usual, and asked when I came back from uncle's, what I had been doing, and so on, as if nothing had happened. At any rate, mother, a thing like this gives one an opportunity of finding out which of your friends are worth having and which are not." ...|$|E

60|$|We {{went very}} slowly. The wood got thicker and thicker the farther {{we got into}} it. There were bushes that were {{difficult}} to push through, and long branches, covered with thorns, that reached out at you and tore at you when you tried to get away. And soon it was quite dark, so dark that I could see nothing, not even Peter, though he was so close. We went slower and slower, and the darkness was full of queer noises. From time to time Peter would stop, and I would run to him and put my nose in his hand. At first he patted me, {{but after a while}} he did not pat me any more, but <b>just</b> <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> his hand to lick, as if it was too much for him to lift it. I think he was getting very tired. He was quite a small boy and not strong, and we had walked a long way.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's she who has reopened {{them with}} me. I got her letter this morning. She {{told me you}} were here and that she wished me to know it. She didn't say much; she <b>just</b> <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> your address. I wrote her back, you know, 'Thanks no end. Shall go to-day.' So we are in {{correspondence}} again, aren't we? She means of course that you've something to tell me from her, eh? But if you have, why haven't you let a fellow know?" [...] He waited for no answer to this, he had so much to say. [...] "At your house, just now, they told me how long you've been here. Haven't you known all the while that I'm counting the hours? I left a word for you--that I would be back at six; but I'm awfully glad to have caught you so much sooner. You don't mean to say you're not going home!" [...] he exclaimed in dismay.

It had this effect on a number of other people here too. Stunning, beautiful, tragic, absurd work." ...|$|E
