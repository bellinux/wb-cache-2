25|$|Section 953 of Dodd–Frank {{deals with}} pay for {{performance}} policies to determine <b>executive</b> <b>compensation.</b> Provisions from this section require the SEC {{to make regulations}} regarding the disclosure of <b>executive</b> <b>compensation</b> as well as regulations on how <b>executive</b> <b>compensation</b> is determined. New regulations require that compensation paid to executives be directly linked to financial performance including consideration of any changes {{in the value of}} the company's stock price or value of dividends paid out. The compensation of executives and the financial performance justifying it are both required to be disclosed. In addition, regulations require that CEO compensation be disclosed alongside the median employee compensation excluding CEO compensation, along with ratios comparing levels of compensation between the two. Regulations regarding pay for performance were proposed by the SEC in September 2013 and were adopted in August 2015.|$|E

25|$|Section 957 {{deals with}} broker voting and relates to section 951 dealing with <b>executive</b> <b>compensation.</b> While section 951 {{requires}} say on pay and golden parachute votes from shareholders, section 957 requires national exchanges to prohibit brokers from voting on <b>executive</b> <b>compensation.</b> In addition, the provisions {{in this section}} prevent brokers from voting on any major corporate governance issue {{as determined by the}} SEC including the election of board members. This gives shareholders more influence on important issues since brokers tend to vote shares in favor of executives. Brokers may only vote shares if they are directly instructed to do so by shareholders associated with the shares. The SEC approved the listing rules set forth by the NYSE and NASDAQ regarding provisions from section 957 in September 2010.|$|E

The new agencies are either granted explicit power over a particular aspect of financial regulation, or that power is transferred from an existing agency. All of the new agencies, and some existing ones that are not currently required to do so, are also compelled to report to Congress on an annual (or biannual) basis, to present the results of current plans and explain future goals. Important new agencies created include the Financial Stability Oversight Council, the Office of Financial Research, and the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection.|$|E

The {{highlights}} of the legislation are consumer protections with authority and independence, ends too big to fail bail outs, advance warning system, transparency and accountability for exotic instruments, <b>executive</b> <b>compensation</b> and corporate governance, protects investors, and enforces regulations on the books. The legislation also resulted in the Office of the Whistleblower, which was established to administer the SEC's whistleblower program. Congress authorized the SEC to provide monetary awards to whistleblowers who come forward with information that results in a minimum of a $1,000,000 sanction. The rewards are between 10% and 30% of the dollar amount collected. Whistleblowers help identify fraud and other unethical behaviors early on.

Each <b>executive's</b> <b>compensation</b> is also benchmarked against the other gender's potential compensation, producing an other-gender measure of under-compensation. Together, both measures allow an analysis of the gender-specific potential salaries of each executive while controlling for performance.

[...] SEC regulations require that at least once every three years shareholders have a non-binding say-on-pay vote on <b>executive</b> <b>compensation.</b> While shareholder are required to have a say-on-pay vote at least every three years, they can also elect to vote annually, every two years, or every third year. The regulations also require that shareholders have a vote at least every six years to decide how often {{they would like to}} have say-on-pay votes. In addition, companies are required to disclose any golden parachute compensation that may be paid out to executives {{in the case of a}} merger, acquisition, or sale of major assets. Proxy statements must also give shareholders the chance to cast a non-binding vote to approve golden parachute policies. Although these votes are non-binding and do not take precedence over the decisions of the board, failure to give the results of votes due consideration can cause negative shareholder reactions.

40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{research}} was to determine, in a South African context, whether there is any correlation between chief <b>executive</b> officer <b>compensation</b> and the performance of the company. For the purposes of the research, the <b>compensation</b> of chief <b>executive</b> officers was broken down into three components: salary, bonus and "other" remuneration, while company performance was measured on return on equity, return on assets and earnings per share figures. Studies on this topic have been carried out in other countries, most notably in the United States of America and the United Kingdom. It appears that no research of a similar nature has been carried out in South Africa. Data in respect of the forty largest listed companies in South Africa were collected over a period of five years. The econometric models used for the research were based on models identified in the literature study.

2500|$|Increasing {{attention}} and regulation (as under the Swiss referendum [...] "against corporate Rip-offs" [...] of 2013) {{has been brought}} to executive pay levels since the financial crisis of 2007–2008. Research {{on the relationship between}} firm performance and <b>executive</b> <b>compensation</b> does not identify consistent and significant relationships between executives' remuneration and firm performance. Not all firms experience the same levels of agency conflict, and external and internal monitoring devices may be more effective for some than for others. Some researchers have found that the largest CEO performance incentives came from ownership of the firm's shares, while other researchers found that the relationship between share ownership and firm performance was dependent on the level of ownership. The results suggest that increases in ownership above 20% cause management to become more entrenched, and less interested in the welfare of their shareholders.|$|E

2500|$|The Fiesta Bowl {{scandal in}} {{particular}} was the catalyst that opened the BCS up to Federal interest for the first time, largely because the government is concerned {{not only about the}} BCS's stifling of fair competition, but more importantly for the Federal Government about the possibility of fraud and tax evasion, if the BCS has violated the rules governing tax exempt organizations and groups that control tax exempt organizations. If the BCS Bowls, who are each separate entities yet also part of the BCS as a whole as well were to lose their tax exempt status, they could be liable for back taxes totaling hundreds of millions of dollars. The Fiesta Bowl abuses – especially those regarding alleged illegal and improper political contributions, [...] excessive <b>executive</b> <b>compensation</b> and unjustified reimbursement payments, and the making of excessive, interest free and un-repaid loans – are precisely the types of abuses that would justify the Internal Revenue Service in stripping the BCS, and each BCS Bowl and possibly even each BCS Conference school (although that is highly unlikely) of their tax exempt status. In the worst-case scenario the BCS could also be subject to forfeiture and seizure proceedings. While the worst penalties are unlikely to be enforced, even the milder penalties, such as a determination of a cartel and trust, would have devastating consequences for the BCS and the current system. The court could also order a resolution of the current unfair competition inherent {{in the structure of the}} BCS, including ordering a playoff system and ordering the Bowls to participate. Despite Big 10 Commissioner Delaney's assertion that if the BCS were to fold they would [...] "go back to the old system" [...] if a court ordered a solution the Conferences would have no choice in the matter, and would be required – especially if a determination is made that the BCS is an illegal trust or cartel – to do whatever the court says, including submitting to federal oversight of the Bowl's and Bowl teams' finances and administration, and conducting a 4, 8 or 16 team playoff, or whatever other remedy the court ordered in their holding. The Department of Justice inquiry is far and away the most potentially dangerous legal situation that the BCS has faced to date.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This paper draws {{attention}} to and raises questions about an area of <b>executive</b> incentive <b>compensation,</b> bonuses and non-equity incentives, {{which seems to have}} disproportionally rewarded executives while shareholders remain exposed to substantial ongoing economic risks. This area of focus has surfaced because, beginning in 2007 and continuing throughout 2008, financial services firms incurred massive losses, while in the years immediately preceding this deluge of losses many executives were awarded substantial bonuses and non-equity incentives. We assess the risks associated with such payments and build a framework for assessing how shareholder and executive interests diverge as a result of bonuses and non-equity compensation. Our analysis is also meant to serve as a building block for future empirical studies about the relationship between <b>executive</b> incentive <b>compensation</b> paid in cash (bonuses and non-equity incentives) and the financial misstatements and overstatements of income that were {{at the heart of the}} financial meltdown...|$|R

In case the government implicitly or explicitly insures deposits and/or the banks debt, banks are incentivized to invest in risky assets and to have a high leverage. Capital regulation could potentially solve this excessive risk taking problem. However, this is only possible if the regulator can observe and properly measure the investment risks of the bank, which was called into question during the 2008 - 09 financial crisis. Hence, we propose a regulatory approach that is also able to implement the first best risk taking levels by the bank, but does not require the regulator to know the investment risk of the bank. The regulatory approach involves the implementation of capital requirements, which are made contingent on the management compensation...|$|R
