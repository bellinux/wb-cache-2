As a consequence, 19 Baluch (R&S) was converted into foot infantry in 1972 and underwent conversion training in its area of responsibility. The unit occupied Mandiala Ridges along Line of Control in its new role. In 1973, the battalion was re-converted into R&S Battalion.|$|E

50|$|It {{was back}} in the same <b>forward</b> area <b>defending</b> <b>localities</b> where it had fought in the 1965 Indo Pak War. Its role and posts were {{familiar}} and the battalion soon settled down to carry out its role to prevent infiltration and dominate the Line of Control. In 1974, a border incident occurred in which the battalion added yet another chapter to its golden history. The battalion prevented the Pakistanis from constructing a <b>defended</b> <b>locality</b> at Shahpur PP. Lance Naik Ishwar Singh lost his life while carrying out his duties. The Pakistanis opened up with mortars and artillery but this did not deter the troops from preventing the Pakistanis from constructing the posts.|$|R
5000|$|In July 1963 the {{battalion}} moved to Poonch where it took over forward defence of localities/pickets on the Line of Control. The battalion carried out vigorous patrolling to prevent infiltration, smuggling and cattle lifting. In 1963 {{the battalion}}, took {{active part in}} provisioning and restoring of drinking water and electricity {{in the town of}} Poonch. Both water and hydro electricity was provided by channel from Betar N. The headwork of the channel was located in the area occupied by Pakistan. In October 1963 Pakistan ignoring the Indus Water Agreement between India and Pakistan blew the headworks, thus cutting off water supply to Poonch Town. When all peaceful methods of making Pakistan release water failed, the battalion was assigned the task of preparing a new water head on the Indian side of Line of Control to restore electricity and water supply. A task force consisting of 3rd Battalion, The Rajputana Rifles, one company of 1st Battalion, The 1st Gurkha Rifles with a Battery of Field Artillery commanded by Lieutenant Colonel B.D. Bhanot, Commanding Officer, 3rd Battalion, The Rajputana Rifles, one company of 1st Battalion, The 1st Gorkha Rifles with a Battery of Field Artillery commanded by Lieutenant Colonel BD Bhanot, Commanding Officer 3rd Battalion the Rajputana Rifles was formed. The battalion started the task at 0600 hours and brought the much-needed water by 1600 hours. In some parts, electricity was also restored on the same evening but complete water supply and electricity were restored only by 21 November 1963. On 22 November 1963 an ill-fated helicopter crashed in the River Poonch near Gulpur in which Lieutenant General Daulat Singh, General Officer Commanding-in-Chief Western Command, Lieutenant General Bikram Singh, General Officer Commanding Corps, Major General P Nanavati, General Officer Command 25 Infantry Division, Air Vice Marshal H.W. Pinto, air officer commanding, Western Command, Brigadier S.R. Oberoi, MC, Commander 93 Infantry Brigade and Flight Lieutenant Sondhi of the Indian Air Force were killed. Officers and men from the battalion were the first to arrive at the site and took active part in rescuing and dispatching the bodies to Ambala and Delhi. In 1965 Pakistan commenced infiltration in Jammu and Kashmir immediately after the operations in Rann of Kutch under the code name of [...] "Operation Gibraltar". On 18 May 1965, a <b>forward</b> <b>defended</b> <b>locality</b> of A Company was attacked with 81 mm rockets, one of latest rockets from USA, in which one Rifleman of the battalion was wounded.|$|R

50|$|Lieutenant Colonel Francis Tiburtius Dias was {{commanding}} {{a battalion}} of 11th Gorkha Rifles during the operations against Pakistan in the Eastern Sector. On 12 December 1971, {{he was ordered to}} capture a well prepared position held by an enemy infantry battalion. Again, on 13 December, the battalion was assigned the task of capturing two bridges held by the enemy in strength. And finally on 14 December 1971 the battalion was assigned the task of capturing a portion of Bogra Town. Under his leadership, the battalion carried out all the tasks successfully, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy. After contacting the enemy defences at Mahasthana, he infiltrated between the enemy's <b>forward</b> <b>defended</b> <b>localities,</b> raided the enemy battalion headquarters, and captured the officer commanding along with other officers. He also thwarted enemy efforts to blow up bridges. It was due to him that the battalion contributed to a great extent in clearing Bogra Town and taking a large number of prisoners.|$|E

Ritchie {{had decided not to}} hold the defences on the Egyptian border, because the defensive plan there relied on his infantry holding <b>defended</b> <b>localities,</b> while a strong armoured force was held back in reserve to foil any attempts to penetrate or outflank the fixed defences. Since General Ritchie had virtually no armoured units left fit to fight, the infantry positions would be defeated in detail. The Mersa defence plan also included an armoured reserve but in its absence Ritchie believed he could organise his infantry to cover the minefields between the <b>defended</b> <b>localities</b> to prevent Axis engineers from having undisturbed access.|$|R
5|$|Brooke's {{appointment}} {{coincided with}} more trained men and better equipment becoming available. Under Brooke, new strategies and tactics were devised.

The defences mainly comprise a number of pillboxes. There was also a RAF station used for carrying out experiments relating to barrage balloons. The hangar measures 100 ft x 70 ft x 80 ft high and was erected in 1940-41 The hangar was needed so that the balloon being tested need not be deflated each night. The balloon was filled with a mixture of air and hydrogen made at the Weston-super-Mare gasworks. The experimental work continued until 1944. A Bristol Blenheim bomber crashed in the village during the war and the remains were excavated in 2007.|$|R
5000|$|War Office, 28 November 1941.The KING {{has been}} graciously pleased {{to approve the}} award of the VICTORIA CROSS to the under-mentioned:—Lieutenant Arthur Roden Cutler (NX.12378), Australian Military Forces.For most {{conspicuous}} and sustained gallantry during the Syrian Campaign and for outstanding bravery during the bitter fighting at Merdjayoun when this artillery officer became a byword amongst the forward troops with whom he worked.At Merdjayoun on the 19 June 1941 our infantry attack was checked after suffering heavy casualties from an enemy counter attack with tanks. Enemy machine gun fire swept the ground but Lieutenant Cutler with another artillery officer and a small party pushed on ahead of the infantry and established an outpost in a house. The telephone line was cut and {{he went out and}} mended this line under machine gun fire and returned to the house, from which enemy posts and a battery were successfully engaged.The enemy then attacked this outpost with infantry and tanks, killing the Bren gunner and mortally wounding the other officer. Lieutenant Cutler and another manned the anti-tank rifle and Bren gun and fought back driving the enemy infantry away. The tanks continued the attack, but under constant fire from the anti-tank rifle and Bren gun eventually withdrew. Lieutenant Cutler then personally supervised the evacuation of the wounded members of his party. Undaunted he pressed for a further advance. He had been ordered to establish an outpost from which he could register the only road by which the enemy transport could enter the town. With a small party of volunteers he pressed on until finally with one other he succeeded in establishing an outpost right in the town, which was occupied by the Foreign Legion, despite enemy machine gun fire which prevented our infantry from advancing.At this time Lieutenant Cutler knew the enemy were massing on his left for a counter attack and that he was in danger of being cut off. Nevertheless he carried out his task of registering the battery on the road and engaging enemy posts. The enemy counter attacked with infantry and tanks and he was cut off. He was forced to go to ground, but after dark succeeded in making his way through the enemy lines. His work in registering the only road by which enemy transport could enter the town was of vital importance and a big factor in the enemy's subsequent retreat.On the night of the 23rd-24 June {{he was in charge of}} a 25-pounder sent <b>forward</b> into ourforward <b>defended</b> <b>localities</b> to silence an enemy anti-tank gun and post which had held up our attack. This he did and next morning the recapture of Merdjayoun was completed.Later at Damour on 6 July when our forward infantry were pinned to the ground byheavy hostile machine gun fire Lieutenant Cutler, regardless of all danger, went to bring a line to his outpost when he was seriously wounded. Twenty-six hours elapsed before it was possible to rescue this officer, whose wound by this time had become septic necessitating the amputation of his leg.Throughout the Campaign this officer's courage was unparalleled and his work was a big factor in the recapture of Merdjayoun.

2500|$|From 13–14 August, {{no further}} {{positions}} were lost but the Italians infiltrated past the <b>defended</b> <b>localities.</b> By 14 August, the Italians were {{almost in a}} position to cut the road, which was the only British line of supply and retreat. On 14 August, Godwin-Austen informed Middle East Command of the situation, concluding that further resistance at Tug Argan would be futile and likely to result in the loss of the force and that a withdrawal would result in 70 percent of the force being saved. On 15 August, he received orders to withdraw from British Somaliland. Late on 15 August, the Italians took Observation Hill and after dark, the defenders of Tug Argan commenced their withdrawal.

2500|$|Some teams use <b>forward</b> <b>defending,</b> aggressively {{challenging}} the ball when {{on the defensive}} {{in any part of}} the field. Others rely on a [...] "collapsing" [...] style, that falls back deep into its own half when the opponent is in possession of the ball. The [...] "forward" [...] policy can put immense physical and psychological pressure on opponents, and is aimed at slowing down or breaking up attacks early. It has more physical demands however, and may spread a defensive formation more thinly. The [...] "collapsing" [...] approach is more economical in physical demand, and provides a packed back zone to thwart attacks. However it sometimes creates large gaps in midfield, and invites the opposing team to dribble forward and to take shots from long range; if the opposing team is good at the two aforementioned skills then goals will be conceded freely.|$|R
50|$|Following {{the success}} of the Soviet winter counteroffensive of December 1941, the Division was rushed to the Eastern Front as {{reinforcement}} and was soon split into several smaller battlegroups urgently needed for <b>defending</b> key <b>localities.</b> One of these battlegroups, formed from the 348th Infantry Regiment, was surrounded by the Soviet 10th Army in January 1942, outside of the town of Sukhinitchi.
