For a single input contone image, two stochastic threshold matrices <b>are</b> <b>used</b> {{to ensure that}} the statistics of two output halftone images are correlated only in predetermined regions. When these two halftones are overlaid, dots in the uncorrelated regions are randomly located with respect to each other (i.e., most of the dots do not overlap), resulting in a darker gray level and therefore the appearance of a hidden watermark. Sharma and Wang [19] also {{proposed a}} halftone-based watermarking method involving screening, but unlike [18], the clustered-dot screen patterns <b>are</b> <b>used.</b> The hidden watermark is embedded by the varying phase of the dot-clusters between two halftone images.

When the two halftones are overlaid, the regions characterized by the stochastic property darken, leading to the formation of a watermark pattern.

40|$|There is a {{long history}} of debate {{regarding}} the validity of the Rorschach Inkblot test. Much of the previous research has involved adult subjects within clinical settings. This study investigates the validity of the Rorschash with adolescents classified as being emotionally disturbed according to the educational definition. School personnel and,particularly,school psychologists have the difficult task of identifying individuals who are emotionally disturbed(ED). It appears that a valid measure of covert processes may be helpful in making these determinations. Due to the vast number of scores and codes generated from the Rorschach using Exner's(1978) Comprehensive Scoring System,this study is limited to analysis of the Experience Actual(EA),experience stimulus(es) and codes that comprise them. Forty-nine adolescents classified as <b>ED</b> <b>were</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> the experimental sample. Sample data were compared to normative data published in Exnor's workbook(Exner, 1990). The findings show ED adolescents have lower EA and es scores than non-ED individuals. Nearly two-thirds of the ED sample had EA scores that were lower than their es scores. Results support that interpretation of the EA and es provides information regarding emotional functioning. Analysis of the codes that comprise the EA and es,perhaps,raised more questions than found answers.

40|$|Experimental design (<b>ED)</b> <b>is</b> a {{powerful}} technique for optimizing {{the performance of}} a process. Compared to a model-based optimization technique, ED does not require the development of mathematical formulation but nevertheless needs a good model or experimental setup and statistical analysis. This paper presents an ED based optimization approach of a dividing wall column (DWC) model for industrial oleochemical fatty acid fractionation. Taguchi method of <b>ED</b> will <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> the optimization of the control variables for efficient fractionation of fatty acid cuts, namely light-cut (LC), middle-cut (MC) and heavy-cut (HC). The DWC model was developed in Aspen Plus software using a rigorous four-column configuration. It <b>is</b> <b>used</b> to identify sensitive parameters, simulate experimental layout trials and results validation. The process is designed to achieve product purity of > 99 mol. % LC and MC, and > 90 mol. % for HC. A step-by-step approach to process optimization <b>using</b> Taguchi method <b>is</b> presented along with the statistical analysis results and their interpretation. The ED output will help in understanding the interaction between variables and their effects. With its simple, fast and non-tedious approach, ED using Taguchi method could prove its significance in improving the performance of fatty acid fractionation <b>using</b> DWC <b>for</b> possible industrial application...|$|R
