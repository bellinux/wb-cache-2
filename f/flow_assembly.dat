The firm also made steam tractors and a huge variety of cast and machined metal products, including munitions during both world wars. The works closed in 1981 and the site was reused as a mixture of housing, flats and industrial sites.

50|$|The first <b>flow</b> <b>assembly</b> {{line was}} {{initiated}} {{at the factory}} of Richard Garrett & Sons, Leiston Works in Leiston in the English county of Suffolk for the manufacture of portable steam engines. The assembly line area was called 'The Long Shop' on account of its length and was fully operational by early 1853. The boiler was brought up from the foundry and put {{at the start of}} the line, and as it progressed through the building it would stop at various stages where new parts would be added. From the upper level, where other parts were made, the lighter parts would be lowered over a balcony and then fixed onto the machine on the ground level. When the machine reached the end of the shop, it would be completed.|$|E

In recent {{years there has been}} a growing interest in the field of in-vivo biosensors for continuous monitoring. For this continuous monitoring of biological interactions, a need for the development of auto-flow assembly arises. The automated <b>flow</b> <b>assembly</b> inherently coupled to a biosensor, forms a Flow Injection Analysis (FIA) system. The designed auto-flow assembly consists of three micro-fluidic solenoid valves actuated through a microcontroller AT 89 C 51.

In this way the robot is moved in parallel to the conveyor, such that control is almost as with a fixed object.

40|$|E 2015 : 034, Unicarriers {{production}} facility in Mölnlycke is manufacturing several different models of trucks for indoor use. The <b>assembly</b> <b>flows</b> covered {{in this study}} consists of two assembly lines and a collective assembly station. Unicarriers are already using mixed-model assembly but could potentially increase resource utilization of the final assembly by merging the three <b>assembly</b> <b>flows.</b> The purpose of this Bachelor Thesis was to investigate which focus areas that are the most critical for mixed-model assembly and to analyse Unicarriers operations based on the identified areas. The study was made on the presumption that the production flows should be merged into a continuous <b>flow</b> mixed-model <b>assembly</b> line and aimed to determine which models that should be included on that line. A literature review was conducted to identify the key elements for effective mixed-model assembly. This resulted in six focus areas: standardized work, handling of complex line balancing, model sequencing, reduce length of materials façade and minimise picking and assembly errors. Sales volume, assembly time and common assembly tasks were identified as important aspects to evaluate the appropriate model mix. A first conclusion is that Unicarriers, based on the identified focus areas, have several areas to improve {{in order to increase}} resource utilization in the current manufacturing setup and in a future continuous <b>flow</b> mixed-model <b>assembly</b> line. The main methods and solutions to improve the current manufacturing setup are: standardized work for assembly and material supply, revised time studies and sequencing rules in the final <b>assembly</b> <b>flows.</b> A future continuous flow line is recommended to consist of open stations, weighted average cycle time, digitized information flows and poka-yoke solution. A second conclusion is that all the models manufactured at the considered production flows are not suited to form a model mix for efficient production on one mixed- model assembly line. The model mix should consist of smaller groups when sales volume, assembly time and common assembly tasks are considered. However, the exact model mix should be further investigated by considering more factors. The study deals with the mixed-model assembly in a general manner and can therefore be seen as a basis for further studies within each focus area...|$|R

We have employed electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy with a continuous <b>flow</b> <b>assembly</b> to monitor the formation of radical intermediates in real time generated from substrate oxidation by manganese(VII). These transient species react with manganese(III) in solution to produce the previously characterized manganese(II) * emission source. Using UV−vis, EPR, attenuated total reflection (ATR) -FT-IR, and chemiluminescence spectroscopies, we have established {{that there are two}} distinct enhancement mechanisms that in combination afford a 50 -fold increase in emission intensity when the reaction is conducted in the presence of phosphate oligomers. In addition to preventing disproportionation of the manganese(III) precursor, the phosphate oligomers form protective “cagelike” structures around the manganese(II) * emitter, thus preventing nonradiative relaxation pathways.

This pressure is likely to increase the pressure on individual workers. In many small to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), we observe that traditional assembly concepts are no longer fulfilled. These are challenged to find other concepts to meet today's demands. In a company where emergency lighting devices are assembled in batches (large series of products are assembled step by step), we applied a participatory and integrative approach to set up a mixed <b>flow</b> <b>assembly</b> system including ergonomically designed work stations.

40|$|Abstract: Problem statement: How a host (the code consumer) can {{determine}} with certainty that a downloaded program received from untrusted source (the code producer) will maintain {{the confidentiality of}} the data it manipulates and {{it is safe to}} install and execute. Approach: The approach adopted for verifying that a downloaded program will not leak confidential data to unauthorized parties was based on the concept of Proof-Carrying Code (PCC). A mobile program (in its assembly form) was analyzed for information flow security based on the concept of proof-carrying code. The security policy was centered on a type system for analyzing information flows within assembly programs based on the notion of noninterference. Results: A verification tool for verifying assembly programs for information flow security was built. The tool certifies SPARC assembly programs for secure information flow by statically analyzing the program based on the idea of Proof-Carrying Code (PCC). The tool operated directly on the machine-code requiring only the inputs and outputs of the code annotated with security levels. The tool provided a windows user interface enabling the users to control the verification process. The proofs that untrusted program did not leak sensitive information were generated and checked on the host machine and if they are valid, then the untrusted program can be installed and executed safely. Conclusion: By basing proof-carrying code infrastructure on information flow analysis type-system, a sufficient assurance of protecting confidential data manipulated by the mobile program can be obtained. This assurance was come {{due to the fact that}} type systems provide a sufficient guarantee of protecting confidentiality.

40|$|The {{reprocessing}} of used {{nuclear fuel}} requires the dissolution and separation of numerous radioisotopes that are present as fission {{products in the}} fuel. The leading technology option in the U. S. for reprocessing is a sequence of processing methods known as UREX+ (Uranium Extraction). However, an industrial scale facility implementing this separation procedure will require the establishment of safeguards and security systems to ensure {{the protection of the}} separated materials. A number of technologies have been developed for meeting the measurement demands for such a facility. This project focuses on the design of a gamma detection system for taking measurements of the flow streams of such a reprocessing facility. An experimental apparatus was constructed capable of pumping water spiked with soluble radioisotopes under various flow conditions through a stainless steel coil around a sodium iodide (NaI) detector system. Experiments were conducted to characterize the impact of flow rate, pipe air voids, geometry, and radioactivity dilution level on activity measurements and gamma energy spectra. Two coil geometries were used for these experiments, using 0. 5 in stainless steel pipe wound into a coil with a 6 inch diameter; the first coil was 5. 5 revolutions tall and the second coil was 9. 5 revolutions tall. The isotopes dissolved in the flowing water were produced at the Texas A&M Nuclear Science Center via neutron activation of chromium, gold, cerium, and ytterbium nitrate salts. After activation, the salts were dissolved in distilled water and inserted into the radioactive <b>flow</b> <b>assembly</b> for quantitative measurements. Flow rate variations from 100 to 2000 ml/min were used and activity dilution levels for the experiments conducted were between 0. 02 and 1. 6 ?Ci/liter. Detection of system transients was observed to improve with decreasing flow rate. The detection limits observed for this system were 0. 02 ?Ci/liter over background, 0. 5 % total activity change in a pre-spiked system, and a dilution change of 2 % of the coil volume. MCNP (Monte Carlo N-Particle Transport) models were constructed to simulate the results and were used to extend the results to other geometries and piping materials as well as simulate actual UREX stream material in the system. The stainless steel piping for the flow around the detector was found to attenuate key identifying gamma peaks on {{the low end of the}} energy spectrum. For the proposed schedule 40 stainless steel pipe for an actual reprocessing facility, gamma rays below 100 keV in energy would be reduced to less than half their initial intensities. The exact ideal detection set up is largely activity and flow stream dependant. However, the characteristics best suited for flow stream detection are: 1) minimize volume around detector, 2) low flow rate for long count times, and 3) low attenuation piping material such as glass...|$|E
