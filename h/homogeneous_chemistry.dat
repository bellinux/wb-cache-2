A sneeze- or cough-generated pathogenic aerosol will take significant time to be treated by a circulating air purifier simply because air circulators are unable to treat all air of the room simultaneously. Air circulators treat a fractional room volume per unit time and exhaust the treated air back into the room resulting in fractional air dilution. In contrast, air sanitizers that are maintained at a sufficient and homogeneous concentration (see <b>homogeneous</b> (<b>chemistry))</b> within the interior air space provide simultaneous treatment of the entire interior air space volume, but are not able to remove particles including allergens. Air purifiers and air sanitizers are therefore complementary air treatment solutions.

40|$|Interfaces or phase {{boundaries}} are a unique chemical environment relative to individual gas, liquid, or solid phases. Interfacial reaction mechanisms and kinetics are often {{at variance with}} <b>homogeneous</b> <b>chemistry</b> due to mass transfer, molecular orientation, and catalytic effects. Aqueous interfaces are a common subject of environmental science and engineering research, and three environmentally relevant aqueous interfaces are investigated in this thesis: 1) fluorochemical sonochemistry (bubble-water), 2) aqueous aerosol ozonation (gas-water droplet), and 3) electrolytic hydrogen production and simultaneous organic oxidation (water-metal/semiconductor). Direct interfacial analysis under environmentally relevant conditions is difficult, since most surface-specific techniques require relatively ‘extreme’ conditions. Thus, the experimental investigations here focus {{on the development of}} chemical reactors and analytical techniques for the completion of time/concentration-dependent measurements of reactants and their products. Kinetic modeling, estimations, and/or correlations were used to extract information on interfacially relevant processes. We found that interfacial chemistry was determined to be the rate-limiting step to a subsequent series of relatively fast homogeneous reactions, for example: 1) Pyrolytic cleavage of the ionic headgroup of perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoate (PFOA) adsorbed to cavitating bubble-water interfaces during sonolysis was the rate-determining step in transformation to their inorganic constituents carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and fluoride; 2) ozone oxidation of aqueous iodide to hypoiodous acid at the aerosol-gas interface is the rate-determining step in the oxidation of bromide and chloride to dihalogens; 3) Electrolytic oxidation of anodic titanol surface groups is rate-limiting for the overall oxidation of organics by the dichloride radical. We also found chemistry unique to the interface, for example: 1) Adsorption of dilute PFOS(aq) and PFOA(aq) to acoustically cavitating bubble interfaces was greater than equilibrium expectations due to high-velocity bubble radial oscillations; 2) Relative ozone oxidation kinetics of aqueous iodide, sulfite, and thiosulfate were at variance with previously reported bulk aqueous kinetics; 3) Organics that directly chelated with the anode surface were oxidized by direct electron transfer, resulting in immediate carbon dioxide production but slower overall oxidation kinetics.

40|$|Over {{the last}} two decades, the {{emission}} of trace elements such as arsenic and mercury from combustion of fossil fuel for electric power generation has become increasingly important {{because of the potential}} health risks associated with elevated concentrations of both elements in the environment. The potential environmental impact of these elements is dependent on the physical and chemical forms in which they are emitted. For this reasons, a comprehensive study of the heterogeneous and <b>homogeneous</b> <b>chemistry</b> of arsenic and mercury has been conducted at post combustion conditions. ^ To assess the partitioning of arsenic to the gas and solid phases under post combustion conditions, thermogravimetric experiments were first conducted with calcium-containing compounds. Experiments were conducted with typical flue gas arsenic concentrations and three calcium bearing solids: calcium oxide, mono-calcium silicate and di-calcium silicate to determine the chemical kinetics of the gas-solid surface reactions over a temperature range of 600 – 1000 °C. On the basis of mass of arsenic reacted per mass of calcium in each solid, all three solid reactants captured arsenic at equivalent levels. Using the chemical kinetic rates obtained from these experiments, a partitioning model was developed. Calculations showed that the transformation of arsenic in combustion systems was influenced by many factors such the ash and calcium content of the parent coal. ^ To assess the impact of flue gas species on the <b>homogeneous</b> <b>chemistry</b> of mercury oxidation in the presence of chlorine-containing species at post flame conditions, bench scale experiment were conducted. Molecular chlorine (Cl 2 (g)) or and hydrogen chloride (HCl(g)) were used as chlorine-containing species and the effects of the flue gas species sulfur dioxide (SO 2 (g)), nitric oxide (NO(g)), methane (CH 4 (g)), and oxygen (O 2 (g)) on the mercury oxidation were assessed. Data collected showed that mercury oxidation by Cl 2 (g) or HCl (g) was promoted when excess O 2 (g) was present in the flue gases whereas the effects of SO 2 (g) and NO(g) were dependent on their concentrations in the flue gases and on the concentrations of the chlorine-containing species. Methane addition to the flue gases either inhibited or did not affect mercury speciation depending upon the temperature of injection. ...|$|E
