5000|$|In 2004, C. litoralis KT71 {{was picked}} for whole genome sequencing. [...] To {{sequence}} the organism, plasmid and fosmid libraries were prepared with insert sizes of 4 and 40 kb. The clonal sequences were sequenced by an Applied Biosystems 3730XL DNA sequencer at the J. Craig Venter Science <b>Foundation</b> <b>Joint</b> Technology Center. From this, {{it was determined}} that C. litoralis KT71 had a genome size of 4.35Mbp with a GC content of 57.7%. Moreover, the genome contains 3933 coding genes. KT71's assembled genome was assessed for protein coding regions using the Prokaryotic Genomes Automatic Annotation Pipeline (PGAAP) from the National Center for Biotechnology Information. Once completed, genome annotation of the open reading frames was done with GenDB v2.2 annotation system.|$|E
40|$|This report {{presents}} {{the findings of}} an exploratory study of joint enterprise, undertaken by the Institute for Criminal Policy Research, {{in partnership with the}} Prison Reform Trust, and within funding from the Nuffield <b>Foundation.</b> <b>Joint</b> enterprise is a doctrine of the criminal law which permits multiple defendants to be convicted of the same criminal offence even where they had different types or levels of involvement. It has been the source of great controversy in recent years. The study looks at the application of the doctrine of joint enterprise in the prosecution of serious cases, and considers the implications of the recent Supreme Court ruling on joint enterprise, which determined that the law had taken ‘a wrong turn’ and required ‘correction’. The report argues that there is an urgent need for greater clarity and transparency {{in the way in which}} cases involving multiple defendants are prosecuted and sentenced in the future...|$|E
40|$|Given the {{significant}} impact {{the use of}} glucocorticoids can have on fracture risk independent of bone density, their use has been incorporated {{as one of the}} clinical risk factors for calculating the 10 -year fracture risk in the World Health Organization's Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX(®)). Like the other clinical risk factors, the use of glucocorticoids is included as a dichotomous variable with use of steroids defined as past or present exposure of 3 months or more of use of a daily dose of 5 mg or more of prednisolone or equivalent. The purpose of this report is to give clinicians guidance on adjustments which should be made to the 10 -year risk based on the dose, duration of use and mode of delivery of glucocorticoids preparations. A subcommittee of the International Society for Clinical Densitometry and International Osteoporosis <b>Foundation</b> <b>joint</b> Position Development Conference presented its findings to an expert panel and the following recommendations were selected. 1) There is a dose relationship between glucocorticoid use of greater than 3 months and fracture risk. The average dose exposure captured within FRAX(®) {{is likely to be a}} prednisone dose of 2. 5 - 7. 5 mg/day or its equivalent. Fracture probability is under-estimated when prednisone dose is greater than 7. 5 mg/day and is over-estimated when the prednisone dose is less than 2. 5 mg/day. 2) Frequent intermittent use of higher doses of glucocorticoids increases fracture risk. Because of the variability in dose and dosing schedule, quantification of this risk is not possible. 3) High dose inhaled glucocorticoids may be a risk factor for fracture. FRAX(®) may underestimate fracture probability in users of high dose inhaled glucocorticoids. 4) Appropriate glucocorticoid replacement in individuals with adrenal insufficiency has not been found to increase fracture risk. In such patients, use of glucocorticoids should not be included in FRAX(®) calculations...|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{relationship}} between coffee consumption and mortality in diverse European populations with variable coffee preparation methods is unclear. Objective: To examine whether coffee consumption {{is associated with}} all-cause and cause-specific mortality. Design: Prospective cohort study. Setting: 10 European countries. Participants: 521   330 persons enrolled in EPIC (European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition). Measurements: Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95 % CIs estimated using multivariable Cox proportional hazards models. The association of coffee consumption with serum biomarkers of liver function, inflammation, and metabolic health was evaluated in the EPIC Biomarkers subcohort (n = 14   800). Results: During a mean follow-up of 16. 4 years, 41   693 deaths occurred. Compared with nonconsumers, participants in the highest quartile of coffee consumption had statistically significantly lower all-cause mortality (men: HR, 0. 88 [95 % CI, 0. 82 to 0. 95]; P for trend < 0. 001; women: HR, 0. 93 [CI, 0. 87 to 0. 98]; P for trend = 0. 009). Inverse associations were also observed for digestive disease mortality for men (HR, 0. 41 [CI, 0. 32 to 0. 54]; P for trend < 0. 001) and women (HR, 0. 60 [CI, 0. 46 to 0. 78]; P for trend < 0. 001). Among women, there was a statistically significant inverse association of coffee drinking with circulatory disease mortality (HR, 0. 78 [CI, 0. 68 to 0. 90]; P for trend < 0. 001) and cerebrovascular disease mortality (HR, 0. 70 [CI, 0. 55 to 0. 90]; P for trend = 0. 002) and a positive association with ovarian cancer mortality (HR, 1. 31 [CI, 1. 07 to 1. 61]; P for trend = 0. 015). In the EPIC Biomarkers subcohort, higher coffee consumption was associated with lower serum alkaline phosphatase; alanine aminotransferase; aspartate aminotransferase; γ-glutamyltransferase; and, in women, C-reactive protein, lipoprotein(a), and glycated hemoglobin levels. Limitations: Reverse causality may have biased the findings; however, results did not differ after exclusion of participants who died within 8 years of baseline. Coffee-drinking habits were assessed only once. Conclusion: Coffee drinking was associated with reduced risk for death from various causes. This relationship did not vary by country.

40|$|We study {{properties}} of ID-logic, {{an extension of}} classical logic with non-monotone inductive defintions. The semantics of this formalism can be given an elegant algebraic characterization {{in the framework of}} approximation theory, which pro- vides a powerful setting in which to analyse this logic. We present a theoretical analysis of the basic structure of expressions in this logic, based on the fundamen- tal concept of a dependency relation. We use this to generalize certain splitting results for this logic and to clarify the relation between this logic and certain known classes of inductive definitions. These results help to illustrate the use of this logic for knowledge representation. We also complement this semantical analyis with corresponding syntactic criteria.
