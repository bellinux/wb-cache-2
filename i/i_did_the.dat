5|$|I {{had a lot}} of {{theories}} I was working with when <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>the</b> Poe films...One of my theories was that these stories were created out of the unconscious mind of Poe, and the unconscious mind never really sees reality, so until The Tomb of Ligeia. we never showed the real world. In Pit, John Kerr arrived in a carriage against an ocean background, which I felt was more representative of the unconscious. That horseback interlude was thrown out because I didn't want to have a scene with people out in broad daylight.|$|E
5|$|I {{was sitting}} there in the theater at the back, showing it to people for the first time. I mean, it was like a puddle of sweat around my feet.

25|$|I invited Joss Whedon {{to lunch}} after <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>the</b> {{business}} deal with Fox. We'd had a cool {{relationship in the}} past and I so wanted to do something else, and I wanted to get back into a television show. I had him on the brain for sure but I hadn't called him yet, but I sort of took a leap of faith and set things up with Fox and then called Joss. We went to a four-hour lunch where I just sort of used my womanly wiles. No, we've become such good friends, kind of like brother and sister and kind of like he was my watcher, my handler from when I first moved out to L.A. when I was 17 and I {{was a little bit of}} a wild child. He's watched me and helped me and taught me over the years. I told him how bad I wanted and needed him back and he accepted and here we are.|$|E
25|$|I {{will say}} {{to you and to}} the colored race that men who bore arms and {{followed}} the flag of the Confederacy are, with very few exceptions, your friends. I have an opportunity of saying what I have always felt – that I am your friend, for my interests are your interests, and your interests are my interests. We were born on the same soil, breathe the same air, and live in the same land. Why, then, can we not live as brothers? I will say that when the war broke out I felt it my duty to stand by my people. When the time came <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>the</b> best I could, and I don't believe I flickered. I came here with the jeers of some white people, who think that I am doing wrong. I believe that I can exert some influence, and do much to assist the people in strengthening fraternal relations, and shall do all in my power to bring about peace. It has always been my motto to elevate every man- to depress none. (Applause.) I want to elevate you to take positions in law offices, in stores, on farms, and wherever you are capable of going.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, in Africa, an Eastern monk named Maximus the Confessor {{carried on}} a furious {{campaign}} against Monothelitism, and in 646 he convinced the African councils {{to draw up a}} manifesto against the doctrine. This they forwarded to the new pope Theodore I, who in turn wrote to Patriarch Paul II of Constantinople, outlining the heretical nature of the doctrine. Paul, a devoted Monothelite, replied in a letter directing the Pope to adhere to the doctrine of one will. Theodore in turn excommunicated the Patriarch in 649, declaring him a heretic, after Paul, in 647 or 648, had issued in the name of Emperor Constans II an edict known as the Typos, which banned any mention of either one or two activities or wills in Christ. The Typos, instead of defusing the situation, made it worse by implying that either doctrine was as good as the other. Theodore planned the Lateran Council of 649 but died before he could convene it, which his successor, Pope Martin <b>I,</b> <b>did.</b> <b>The</b> Council condemned the Ecthesis and the Typos, and Pope Martin wrote to Constans, informing the emperor of its conclusions and requiring him to condemn both the Monothelite doctrine and his own Typos. Constans responded by having Pope Martin abducted to Constantinople, where he was tried and condemned to banishment and {{died as a result of}} the torture to which he had been subjected. Maximus also was tried and banished after having his tongue and his hand cut off.|$|E

500|$|Henry Tizard, whose {{committee}} spearheaded {{development of}} the CH system, grew concerned that CH would be too effective. He expected that the Luftwaffe would suffer so many losses {{that they would be}} forced to call off daylight attacks, and would turn to a night bombing effort. Their predecessors in World War <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>the</b> same when the London Air Defence Area successfully blocked daytime raids, and attempts to intercept German bombers at night proved comically ineffective. Tizard's concerns would prove prophetic; Bowen called it [...] "one of the best examples of technological forecasting made in the twentieth century".|$|E
500|$|In 1985, Thompson {{was cast}} in the West End revival of the musical Me and My Girl, co-starring Robert Lindsay.

500|$|Of course, I haven't any {{voice to}} speak of, but I {{have a great}} register, and Sullivan used to amuse himself by making me sing bass in one number of an opera and tenor in another.

500|$|Henson {{received}} help editing {{the film}} from executive producer George Lucas. According to Henson, [...] "When {{we hit the}} editing, <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>the</b> first cut, and then George was heavily involved on bringing it to the final cut. After that, I took it over again and did {{the next few months}} of post-production and audio." [...] Henson went on to explain, [...] "When you edit a film with somebody else you have to compromise. I always want to go one way, and George goes another way, but we each took turns trading off, giving and taking. George tends to be very action-oriented and he cuts dialogue quite tight; I tend to cut looser, and go for more lyrical pauses, which can slow the story. So, I loosen up his tightness, and he tightens my looseness." ...|$|E

He enjoyed the house's convenience and said that [...] "it’s there that <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>the</b> fundamental work" [...] for which he won the Nobel Prize.

500|$|By 1949, Feynman was {{becoming}} restless at Cornell. He never {{settled into a}} particular house or apartment, living in guest houses or student residences, or with married friends [...] "until these arrangements became sexually volatile". He liked to date undergraduates, hire prostitutes, and sleep with the wives of friends. He was not fond of Ithaca's cold winter weather, and pined for a warmer climate. Above all, at Cornell, he {{was always in the}} shadow of Hans Bethe. Feynman did, however, look back favorably on the Telluride House, where he resided for a large period of his Cornell career. In an interview, he described the House as [...] "a group of boys [...] have been specially selected because of their scholarship, because of their cleverness or whatever it is, to be given free board and lodging and so on, because of their brains". He enjoyed the house's convenience and said that [...] "it's there that <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>the</b> fundamental work" [...] for which he won the Nobel Prize.|$|E
500|$|During {{the run of}} Sunset Boulevard at the West End's Adelphi Theatre in 1995, Paige {{discovered}} a lump in her breast, prompting her to consult her doctor, who at first reassured her {{there was nothing to}} be concerned about. She returned twice, and her doctor subsequently sent her for tests that confirmed the lump was cancerous, nine months after she discovered it. Continuing her role in the production Paige did not miss a show, and stated, [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>the</b> show I became very emotional. Some of the lyrics suddenly took on an entirely different meaning. Words like, 'as if we never said goodbye' became more real". [...] Paige went in for day surgery on a Sunday due to her theatre commitments, had five years of medical treatment and completed a radiation programme. She spoke for the first time of her encounter with breast cancer in a 2004 interview, and has since described the period as [...] "the most awful thing that's happened to me in my life".|$|E

I've known him 30 odd years and I really like working with him. We had a great relationship as friends as well as performers.
