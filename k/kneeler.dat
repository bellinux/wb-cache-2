2500|$|For the 1953 racing season, Amm debuted the {{controversial}} Norton <b>Kneeler</b> 350cc motorcycle at the 1953 North West 200 Race. Despite overheating problems the Norton <b>Kneeler</b> with the nickname the [...] "Amm Sandwich" [...] or [...] "Silver-Fish", Amm finished in 9th {{place in the}} 350cc class that was eventually won by Bob McIntyre at an average race speed of 86.86mph. Despite testing the Norton <b>Kneeler</b> for practice for the 1953 Isle of Man TT Races, Amm reverted to the non-steamlined Norton motorcycles due to handling problems with cross-winds on the Mountain Section of the course and also opposition by the TT Race Scrutineers. It proved a good choice as Amm won the 1953 Junior TT Race at an average race speed of 90.52mph from Ken Kavanagh in 2nd place and Fergus Anderson in 3rd place. [...] Another win in the 1953 Senior TT Race for Amm at an average race speed of 93.85mph completed a prestigious Junior/Senior TT double win for the works Norton team. Following Amm during the 1953 Senior TT Race, Geoff Duke commented on Amm's distinctive riding style;- [...] "After I had caught and passed Ray Amm on the Norton, he passed me at Ballugh when I missed a gearchange! Then there was the frightening experience of following him {{to the end of}} the lap, Ray could be pretty lurid when he was trying!" [...] A fall at the 1953 French Grand Prix at Rouen in the 350cc class broke a collar-bone and brought about a premature end to championship ambitions for Amm for the 1953 Grand Prix motorcycle racing season. However, Amm returned to the abortive Norton <b>Kneeler</b> project in November 1953 to set a number of world speed records at Montlhéry, France rasing the hour speed endurance record to a distance of 133.70miles. Also at Montlhéry in November 1953, Amm shared a streamlined Norton Sidecar outfit with Eric Oliver to set further speed records.|$|E
2500|$|Each hermit —  that is, a monk who is or {{who will}} be a priest [...] — has his own living space, called a cell, usually {{consisting}} of a small dwelling.
