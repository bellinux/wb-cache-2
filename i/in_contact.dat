40|$|The role of <b>contacts</b> <b>in</b> {{characterization}} of traps in semi-insulating (SI) GaAs by {{thermally stimulated current}} (TSC) methods has been demonstrated by comparing alloyed In and soldered <b>In</b> <b>contacts.</b> Alloyed <b>In</b> <b>contacts,</b> which have an ohmic characteristic, assure high sensitivities in both TSC and temperature dependent photocurrent (PC), and both are important for determining the trap concentrations in SI GaAs. On the other hand, soldered <b>In</b> <b>contacts,</b> which act like Schottky barriers, cause a significant reduction of both PC and TSC, particularly at low temperatures, {{and can lead to}} a misinterpretation of TSC results...|$|R

40|$|We {{compared}} {{the effectiveness of}} rifampin-trimethoprim in fixed combination (3. 75 : 1) to rifampin alone in the eradication of Haemophilus influenzae type b carriage among contacts of patients with invasive infection caused by this organism. The study population was composed of 127 index patients and 620 contacts. Twenty-six percent of contacts were colonized. Rifampin-trimethoprim eradicated carriage in 77. 6 % of contacts (71. 1 % <b>in</b> <b>contacts</b> less than 5 years, 84. 2 % <b>in</b> <b>contacts</b> {{greater than or equal}} to 5 years) whereas rifampin eradicated carriage in 69. 9 % of contacts (56. 4 % <b>in</b> <b>contacts</b> less than 5 years, 81. 8 % <b>in</b> <b>contacts</b> {{greater than or equal to}} 5 years). A single isolate resistant to rifampin and rifampin-trimethoprim was encountered. The eradication rate achieved with this regimen of rifampin-trimethoprim was too low to recommend its routine use. However, a higher dose or longer course might merit clinical trial...|$|R

5|$|We {{consider}} {{the surface area}} of the entire mass of mercury, including {{the part of the}} surface that is <b>in</b> <b>contact</b> with the glass, because mercury does not adhere to glass at all. So the surface tension of the mercury acts over its entire surface area, including where it is <b>in</b> <b>contact</b> with the glass. If instead of glass, the tube was made out of copper, the situation would be very different. Mercury aggressively adheres to copper. So in a copper tube, the level of mercury {{at the center of the}} tube will be lower than at the edges (that is, it would be a concave meniscus). In a situation where the liquid adheres to the walls of its container, we {{consider the}} part of the fluid's surface area that is <b>in</b> <b>contact</b> with the container to have negative surface tension. The fluid then works to maximize the contact surface area. So in this case increasing the area <b>in</b> <b>contact</b> with the container decreases rather than increases the potential energy. That decrease is enough to compensate for the increased potential energy associated with lifting the fluid near the walls of the container.|$|E

40|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} among 1810 contacts of 50 index "cases"/"suspects" of pulmonary tuberculosis including 312 household and 1498 neighbourhood <b>contacts</b> <b>in</b> the Jhansi city of Uttar Pradesh. The overall prevalence of radiologically active and bacteriologically confirmed tuberculosis was 2. 9 % and 1. 1 %. The prevalence rates of radiologically active and bacteriologically confirmed disease, although comparatively high <b>in</b> both the <b>contact</b> groups, were significantly higher in household (5. 4 % and 2. 6 %) than <b>in</b> neighbourhood <b>contacts</b> (2. 3 % and 0. 8 %).

5|$|Another way to view {{surface tension}} is {{in terms of}} energy. A {{molecule}} <b>in</b> <b>contact</b> with a neighbor is in a lower state of energy than if it were alone (not <b>in</b> <b>contact</b> with a neighbor). The interior molecules have as many neighbors as they can possibly have, but the boundary molecules are missing neighbors (compared to interior molecules) and therefore have a higher energy. For the liquid to minimize its energy state, the number of higher energy boundary molecules must be minimized. The minimized number of boundary molecules results in a minimal surface area.|$|E
