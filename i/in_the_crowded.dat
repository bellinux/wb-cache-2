5|$|By 1854, Hindman {{realized}} that he had little room to maneuver <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowded</b> Mississippi political arena. Looking across the Mississippi River, Hindman observed that the young and turbulent state of Arkansas was wide open for a well-educated and ambitious politician. Hindman left Mississippi politics when he moved to Helena, Arkansas on March 18, 1854.|$|E
5|$|Like the House of the Lake, most houses <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowded</b> Theatre Quarter of Delos have irregular-shaped {{floor plans}} (such as {{trapezoidal}} designs), {{as opposed to}} square or rectangular designs. The narrow and irregular street grid is unlike that of other quarters, where streets usually meet at approximately right angles. Similar {{to the majority of}} excavated homes of Delos, those in the Theatre Quarter feature an open courtyard without porticoes, instead of the peristyle layout with columns. Some of the houses in the Theatre Quarter lack interior decoration altogether, with neither wall murals nor mosaics, which is unusual for most Delian homes.|$|E
5|$|Readville has {{an unusual}} layout {{because it is}} built on the {{crossing}} of two rail lines. The Fairmount Line and Franklin Line each have a single track atop an embankment. The Fairmount Line has a single side platform, while the Franklin Line has two. The Fairmount Line track continues atop a bridge over the Northeast Corridor to join with the Franklin Line. This connection is used by several trains each rush hour, allowing trains from the Franklin Line to avoid congestion <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowded</b> Southwest Corridor.|$|E
50|$|Faces <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Crowd</b> is {{a long-running}} segment from Sports Illustrated. Starting <b>in</b> <b>the</b> January 9, 1956, issue, the segment was {{originally}} titled These Faces <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Crowd.</b> <b>The</b> predecessor to These Faces... was a segment called Pat on the Back. It differed {{in that it}} did not just focus on unknown or amateur athletes. Contrary to Faces <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Crowd,</b> it featured professional athletes who set milestones and celebrities who undertook an athletic endeavor. From 1956 to 2006, a total of 15,672 athletes have been featured.|$|R

5|$|The {{third phase}} of the {{resettlement}} involved the dispersal of the new arrivals from the temporary villages in regions surrounding the capital and other large cities. The areas where the refugees had initially were over settled, notably Biên Hòa, where the population had doubled during the migration period. In contrast, two thirds of South Vietnamese provinces had taken less than 10,000 refugees, {{and some of these}} less than 1,000. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowded</b> provinces there were fears of social unrest due to a shortage of work.|$|E
5|$|Opponents of dam removal {{state that}} the {{estimated}} demolition cost of $3–10 billion is a poor investment, especially in regards of the resulting loss of renewable hydroelectric power, which {{would have to be}} replaced by polluting fossil fuel generation. Although there are several options available to replace San Francisco's water, none are of the purity currently supplied by Hetch Hetchy. There is also no guarantee that the valley can be successfully restored, as the original valley floor was actually the product of thousands of years of intensive controlled burning and management by the native Paiute and Miwok peoples that once lived in the area. Without this intervention, a forest would grow in the place of the valley's renowned meadows. Finally, the increased pressure of new tourism could cause its own environmental damage, as has been demonstrated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowded</b> Yosemite Valley.|$|E
5|$|Since 2006, {{there have}} been a number of {{terrorist}} attacks, including explosions in a landmark holy place, a court and a temple. The 2006 Varanasi bombings were a series of bombings that occurred across the Hindu holy city of Varanasi on 7 March 2006. At least 28 people were killed and as many as 101 others were injured. The blasts occurred simultaneously shortly after 18:00 IST. The first blast took place at 18:20 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowded</b> Sankat Mochan Hanuman Temple near the Banaras Hindu University. Other blasts followed at the Varanasi Cantonment Railway Station near the waiting area next to the travel office. Initially, another blast was reported in the stationary Shivganga Express bound for Delhi.|$|E

5|$|Folding@home is {{also used}} to study protein chaperones, heat shock {{proteins}} which play essential roles in cell survival by assisting with the folding of other proteins <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowded</b> and chemically stressful environment within a cell. Rapidly growing cancer cells rely on specific chaperones, and some chaperones play key roles in chemotherapy resistance. Inhibitions to these specific chaperones are seen as potential modes of action for efficient chemotherapy drugs or for reducing the spread of cancer. Using Folding@home and working closely with the Center for Protein Folding Machinery, the Pande lab hopes to find a drug which inhibits those chaperones involved in cancerous cells. Researchers are also using Folding@home to study other molecules related to cancer, such as the enzyme Src kinase, and some forms of the engrailed homeodomain: a large protein which may be involved in many diseases, including cancer. In 2011, Folding@home began simulations of the dynamics of the small knottin protein EETI, which can identify carcinomas in imaging scans by binding to surface receptors of cancer cells.|$|E

25|$|However, {{a series}} of events that would be known as the Crisis of the Late Middle Ages was under its way. When came the Black Death of 1348, it sealed a sudden end to the {{previous}} period of massive scientific change. The plague killed a third of the people in Europe, especially <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowded</b> conditions of the towns, where the heart of innovations lay. Recurrences of the plague and other disasters caused a continuing decline of population for a century.|$|E
25|$|When {{the city}} {{became a major}} center for defense {{shipbuilding}} during World War II, {{tens of thousands of}} rural Texans migrated there for the new high-paying jobs. The Roosevelt administration ordered the defense industry to be integrated, and many Southern whites were working closely with blacks for the first time. Housing was scarce <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowded</b> city, and racial tensions increased. In June 1943 after workers at the Pennsylvania shipyard in Beaumont learned that a white woman had accused a black man of raping her, nearly 2,000 went to the jail where a suspect was being held, attracting more men along the way and reaching a total of 4,000.|$|E
25|$|The site {{remained}} {{prone to}} flooding, probably through the starting gates, until Claudius made improvements there; they probably included an extramural anti-flooding embankment. Fires <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowded,</b> wooden perimeter workshops and bleachers were {{a far greater}} danger. A fire of 36 AD seems to have started in a basket-maker's workshop under the stands, on the Aventine side; the emperor Tiberius compensated various small businesses there for their losses. In AD 64, during Nero's reign, fire broke out at the semi-circular end of the Circus, swept through the stands and shops, and destroyed much of the city. Games and festivals continued at the Circus, which was rebuilt over several years to the same footprint and design.|$|E

25|$|The {{working class}} Parisians {{and the poor}} were {{concentrated}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowded</b> maze of streets {{in the center of}} the city, on the Île de la Cité or close to the central market at Les Halles, and in the eastern neighborhood of the Faubourg Saint-Antoine (One of the reasons the nobility slowly moved to the Faubourg Saint-Germain), where thousands of small workshops and the furniture business were located, or on the Left Bank, near the Bièvre River, where the tanners and dyers were located. In the years just before the Revolution, these neighborhoods were flooded with thousands unskilled immigrants from the poorer regions of France. In 1789, these unemployed and hungry workers became the foot soldiers of the Revolution.|$|E
25|$|As {{with other}} public schools, a scheme was devised {{towards the end}} of the 19th century to {{familiarize}} privileged schoolboys with social conditions in deprived areas. The project of establishing an 'Eton Mission' <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowded</b> district of Hackney Wick in east London was started at the beginning of 1880, and lasted until 1971 when it was decided that a more local project (at Dorney) would be more realistic. However over the years much money was raised for the Eton Mission, a fine church by G. F. Bodley was erected, many Etonians visited, and stimulated among other things the Eton Manor Boys' Club, a notable rowing club which has survived the Mission itself, and the 59 Club for motorcyclists.|$|E
25|$|The Nivkh {{suffered}} severely {{from the}} Cossack conquest and {{imposition of the}} Tsarist Russians; they called the latter kinrsh (devils). The Russian Empire gained complete control over Nivkh lands after the 1858 Treaty of Aigun and the 1860 Convention of Peking. The Russians established a penal colony on Sakhalin, which operated from 1857 to 1906. They transported numerous Russian criminal and political exiles there, including Lev Sternberg, an important early ethnographer of the Nivkh. The Nivkh were soon outnumbered; they were sometimes employed as prison guards and to track escaped convicts. The Nivkh suffered epidemics of smallpox, plague, and influenza, brought by the foreign immigrants and spread <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowded,</b> unsanitary prison environment.|$|E
