5000|$|A canal {{will often}} need some means to {{maintain}} a water level. A canal constantly consumes water due to leakage, evaporation, and the operation of lift locks. Nevertheless, excess water from storms or <b>emptying</b> <b>locks</b> [...] could cause problems eroding the banks of a canal, causing washouts, and flooding buildings or adjacent properties. Waste weirs were one of several items used to remove surplus water. The waste weir also functioned as an opening to drain the entire canal prism of water for repairs, or for winter (to avoid damage from freezing water), or in anticipation of flooding.|$|R

2500|$|... "Lock mooring" [...] was a {{commonly}} used method of navigating into a lock by a barge travelling upstream. The barge would {{be directed to}} the slack water {{to one side of}} the lock gates and as the volume of water decreased as the <b>lock</b> <b>emptied</b> the barge or boat is effectively sucked out of the slack water into the path of the lock gates.

50|$|The lock gear on the Eastern Branch of the Montgomeryshire {{were of a}} {{different}} design to those on other canals. Whereas most other canal locks have culverts in the side walls to fill and <b>empty</b> the <b>lock,</b> with paddles opening and closing vertically, the locks on the Montgomeryshire were designed with a culvert {{in the base of}} the canal, with the paddle sliding horizontally over the culvert. During operation this can lead to a large whirlpool being observed. To operate the paddle, the winding gear is purely a geared design, rather than rack and pinion. An effect of this {{is that there is no}} pawl to be operated, and the paddles cannot be accidentally dropped shut. The paddle gear was designed by George W. Buck, who was appointed Engineer of the Eastern branch in 1819, and Clerk to the Western branch in 1832.|$|R
50|$|The wooden {{guillotine}} style gates {{are suspended}} {{in a slightly}} raked cast iron girder frame by a chain which passes through a small block on the gate. One end of the chain passes over two large wheels to a winch mechanism. The other end passes over two more large wheels to a hidden counterweight built into the side wall of the lock. There {{was no need for}} paddle gear to fill or <b>empty</b> the <b>lock.</b> With such a small difference in water level a guillotine gate could easily be lifted to let water flow in and out. The existing gates probably date from 19th century. Since the nationalisation of the canals in 1948, water loss from one canal to another is less of an issue, so the gates are no longer in use and are both left open. The last recorded use of the gates was 1959.|$|R

50|$|Locks on {{commercial}} canals are usually power operated. The lock keeper, {{who no longer}} lives on site, controls the whole process from a control room overlooking the lock. In the modern age the control of traffic and locks on canals is being centralised. A single control centre can remotely operate several locks and moveable bridges in a wide area, overseeing the process using CCTV. For example, the Tilburg control centre in the Netherlands will remotely control 18 locks and 28 moveable bridges from 2015 on.This allows for a reduction in manpower while still providing round-the-clock service to water traffic. As the controller now has overview over the traffic moving through one lock after another, he can anticipate the arrival of boats by turning the lock in advance, having boats wait for another coming from behind to handle them simultaneously, or decide whether to turn a <b>lock</b> <b>empty</b> for a boat going in one direction or to wait for one going in the other direction.|$|R

40|$|The United States of America – {{and more}} {{specific}} {{the state of}} Illinois – {{are dealing with a}} problem of Asian carps spreading from inward waterways to the Great Lakes. The Asian carp was originally brought to America to be used in study?s on agricultural pounds, but escaped after series of flooding. The Asian carp has no natural enemies in the waters of the United States and are heading via the Mississippi River to the Great Lakes. The threat of the Asian carp lies in the 8 ̆ 4 special? property that these fish have a large appetite and tend to eat everything in their way which is smaller than them. They reproduce rapidly which means that in relatively short periods entire areas can be cleared from plankton and aquatic plants. Their presence can ruin entire vegetation?s and especially when the would enter the Great Lakes, huge economic and environmental problems could arise. Due to these imminent problems multiple studies have been made to stop these fish, but yet so far no actual solution has come up. Even an electrical curtain wasn?t able to stop them. The only connection between the Mississippi River and the Great Lakes – the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal – is a perfect location for a structure that can stop these fish, but still allowing the inland water vessels to gain access to Chicago and the Great Lakes. This canal is designed as part of the sewage system of the Chicago Area Waterway System and is needed to remain a proper water quality – closing this canal off will lead to large investments in multiple wastewater treatment plants. A proper solution is therefore desired which lead to an passage for vessels without providing a passage for fish heading upstream towards the Great Lakes. A surroundings and stakeholders analysis showed that the best location for such a solution will be in the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal near the place Lockport. Meeting the requirements the best solution for this problem is the design of a 8 ̆ 4 water-free vertical boat lift?. This design can be combined with the renovation/renewing of the current Lockport lock in the canal. The water-free vertical boat lift has similarities with a regular vertical boat lift, but has the special property that it lifts the vessels to the upstream water level without the help of water. A vessels will enter the lock chamber via two vertical lifting doors whereafter the water is drained out of it. The vessel will the lower until it rests on inflatable rubber bags on the floor. Hereby all the water and fish will be caught in a water storage area underneath the lock chamber from where the water and fish will be released downstream again. Afterwards the <b>empty</b> <b>lock</b> chamber with the vessel will be lifted to the upstream water level from where water can be pumped back in and the vessel can continue. The lock chamber is made out of steel walls of 7, 5 meters high in combination with a steel/concrete combined floor of 18, 5 meters width and 100 meters length. The concrete slab will be inclined to gain a 1 : 20 slope for a proper outflow of the water and fish. The inflatable bags are placed over the width every 10 meters and the 2 x 2 meter gaps are placed in pairs of two in-between. The lock chamber is closed-off by two vertical lifting gates and is supported by 42 steel cables with a diameter of 103 mm distributed over the length. The cables will go up over large pulleys, which will be mounted on the total construction for support. The counter weights have to be adjustable due to the difference in weight of the lock chamber when filled and emptied. By using variable weights the mass can be regulated, which leads to better handling of the lifting/lowering equipment. This report shows that a decent solution to stop Asian carp from invading the Great Lakes lies {{in the form of a}} vertical boat lift that lifts the vessels without the help of water. Further researches will lead to a better conclusion regarding the feasibility of this design and the applicability to the Chicago Sanitary and Shipping Canal regarding the main objective: stopping fish from invading Lake Michigan!Hydraulic StructuresHydraulic EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
40|$|The {{hydraulic}} {{operation of}} a lock with separate water- saving basins and introduction of water through the chamber bottom, adopted as the reference solution during the preliminary design studies of the Seine-Nord Europe Canal, has been studied using numerical and physical models. These studies were used to size the chamber water supply system and define the most suitable design for the gate chamber controlling flows between the water- saving basins and the lock chamber. The 1 : 25 scale model built for the lock with the largest drop height (30 m) enabled the numerical simulation results to be validated and fine-tuned, and certain operating parameters to be optimised. The phenomenon of surge waves in the reaches, related to the rapid filling and <b>emptying</b> of large <b>locks</b> (in {{spite of the fact}} that most of this water volume is exchanged between the chamber and the water-saving basins in a closed circuit) means that special measures must be taken to maintain navigation conditions in the canal. Of the possible solutions, the one proposed at this stage of the project consists, firstly, in limiting the discharges exchanged between the chamber and the canal, which is a means of controlling the initial surge wave but restricts possibilities for speeding up lockage, and secondly, in creating damping basins along the reaches, preferably alongside the locks, in order to reduce the amplitude of the resulting waves in the canal...|$|R
50|$|Regent's Canal was {{authorised}} by an Act of Parliament {{obtained on}} 13 July 1812, for a canal from Paddington to Limehouse. When the directors first met, {{they had decided}} that all locks would be paired, so {{that some of the}} water from a <b>lock</b> <b>emptying</b> could be used to fill the adjacent chamber. Water saving was an important factor, as they knew that water supply would be problematic. Colonel William Congreve, a military engineer who was later knighted, proposed the use of hydropneumatic boat lifts instead of locks. Various designs of a similar nature had been tried in the early nineteenth century, notably at Mells on the Dorset and Somerset Canal and at Tardebigge on the Worcester and Birmingham Canal, but none had proved successful. Congreve's design used two water-filled caissons, which were moved up and down by hand, assisted by compressed air trapped beneath the tanks. With no working examples of such lifts, the directors were understandably cautious, but following an engineer's report, decided that Maudslay & Co should build a prototype at Camden Town. There were a number of technical problems, with the canal company blaming Maudslays for poor design, and Maudslays blaming the canal company for changing the original design and failing to maintain the structure. Congreve's claim that it could be operated in just three minutes was never proved, and in 1818, the directors decided to cut their losses, and reverted to using paired locks. The lift was sold at auction in November 1819, and the 13 lots raised just £404.|$|R
40|$|Waste {{management}} {{is always a}} headache to the policy makers to tackle with nowadays as we are generating more waste than the past generations. Landfill is the only disposal method in Hong Kong since the early of the 1990 s and the three strategic landfills {{are going to be}} filled. Therefore, the quantity-based waste charging is going to be implemented in the near future in order to reduce waste generation. A complementary recycling system is a must to complete the newly proposed waste management policy to reduce waste volume. There are some obvious problems existing in the current recycling efforts, which hinder the success of waste separation for recycling so as to reduce waste generation. As a result, it is important to review the current Programme on Source Separation of Domestic Waste. Moreover, a successful waste separation programme for waste reduction requires fulfilling the criteria in the aspects of Recycling Facilities/Services, Public Education & Promotion and Statutory Requirement & Complementary Policy. Based on the survey results, 40 % of the current recycling facilities are inconvenient or inconvenient at all and most of the respondents think that there are insufficient recycling facilities in the territory. Nearly 70 % of them agree or fully agree to implement mandatory waste separation and more than a half of them prefer to fine each non-compliance below $ 500. Moreover, the majority of the respondents suggest that the incentives for them to recycle are not enough or not enough at all, which take up 55 % of the total. And 60 % of them agree or fully agree to reward people who recycle. From the site visit, {{it is obvious that the}} public abuses the roadside 3 -coloured bins especially in the Hong Kong Island and the New Territories. Meanwhile, the misuse of the recycling bins leads to the cleanness problem. The tendered contractors are not doing well in terms of <b>emptying</b> and <b>locking</b> the 3 -coloured bins. There are fewer problems arising from the recycling facilities or bins collecting other recyclables as these recycling bins are designed for collecting specific types of recyclables and they are not adjacent to the rubbish bins. Also, the centers for collecting bulky recyclables have management staff to collect the recyclables. According to the reply from the Environmental Protection Department, there are many monitoring works to ensure the services quality provided by the service contractors. However, it is questionable that it can maintain the performance of the contractors. Since there are increasing complaints on the unsatisfactory performance of the service contractors. As a result, the Government should review the current Programme on Source Separation of Domestic Waste in accordance with recommendations proposed in the scopes of Physical Enhancement to Recycling Facilities/Services, Education and Promotion and Policy Recommendations, including increasing the convenience and availability of the recycling facilities and the range of separation; implementing compulsory environmental education and improving the promotion on waste separation; implementing complementary policy and regulations for waste separation, monitoring the performance of waste separation and providing incentives to encourage recycling. published_or_final_versionEnvironmental ManagementMasterMaster of Science in Environmental Managemen...|$|R
40|$|Navigation locks {{are used}} to {{transport}} vessels between waterways with different water levels. In the nearby future many navigation locks will be renovated or replaced. During {{the design of a}} new lock still some unknown factors are encountered. One of these factors is the vibration of the valve. The valve is part of the filling and emptying system that is responsible for the levelling of the water in the lock chamber. The most used valve type is a vertical-lift valve. During the filling and <b>emptying</b> of the <b>lock,</b> water flows with high velocity underneath the valve. The flow of water can cause vibrations. These vibrations are called flow-induced vibrations and could lead to failure of the valve system. Possible failures are for example that the operating machinery {{will not be able to}} open the valve or that the valve will hit other elements due to the vibrations. As a consequence the lock gate complex cannot meet its requirements anymore. Several types of flow-induced vibrations can be distinguished. This distinction is based on the cause of the vibration. This research only focussed on vibrations due to turbulence and instability of the flow. The above-mentioned types can be experienced in two directions. The two directions are in-flow (horizontal in the direction of the flow) and cross-flow (perpendicular to the direction of the flow). A valve is more likely to vibrate in a vertical direction than a horizontal direction, because the majority of the valves is positioned in a niche of a gate or culvert. Currently not much information regarding the flow-induced vibrations due to turbulence or instability of the water flow is available and the information that is available is often out dated. The shape could have an effect on the flow-induced vibrations. This seal has to ensure the water tightness of the valve. No research has been done on the effects of the seal shapes, which are used nowadays, on the dynamic behaviour. Therefore, the information of the effect of seal shapes as used in practice is missing. In the current situation a guideline involving the natural frequency of the valve system is used. This guideline states that the natural frequency of the valve has to be larger than three times the excitation frequency. Therefore, the main research question of this research is: What is the effect of the shape of the lower edge seal on the vertical flow-induced vibrations of a valve in a filling and emptying culvert? The vibration phenomena have been investigated by means of a physical model. A simplified scale model of the valve is constructed and tested in a current flume under varying conditions. The varying parameters during these tests are the flow velocity underneath the valve, the stiffness of the vertical suspension, the gate opening underneath the valve and the shape of the lower edge seal. Four different seal shapes have been tested. The tests have been executed under steady state conditions. In addition to the steady state tests, free-decay tests (to determine the natural frequency and damping) and tests to determine the contraction have been executed. The physical tests showed that the shape did have an effect on the presence of the flow-induced vibrations and on the amplitude of the vibrations. However some other parameters influenced the vibrations. For example the relative gate opening and the Reynolds number. The study has proven the presence of the flow-induced vibrations. However, the executed physical model test should be optimized to get a more accurate view on the different phenomena. Also should the effect of certain parameters (Reynolds number, water levels) be further investigated. Civil Engineering and GeosciencesHydraulic Engineerin...|$|R
