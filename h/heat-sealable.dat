40|$|The {{bursting}} pressure test on semi-rigid containers made of aluminium-plastic-laminates or <b>heat-sealable</b> lacquered aluminium-thin-strips {{has now been}} generally adopted, especially for the production control of single portion packs. Thus, {{it is possible to}} continuously test the strength of the heat sealed seams of the packages and to control the condition and working of the heat sealing station of the respective packaging machine. Also the optimal heat sealing conditions can be determined that way. The factors of influence are being discussed, on which the achievable {{bursting pressure}} depends and it is demonstrated that the extent of the bursting pressure value is strongly depending on some of these factors. The required bursting pressure value should, therefore, be co-ordinated with the supplier of the semi-rigid containers or of the packaging machine before starting the production...|$|E
40|$|Using ten {{sealing jaws}} with {{differently}} shaped surfaces, side-sealed bags and tubular bags with overlapped resp. fin seal seams were produced out of fourteen commercial packaging materials. The {{effect of the}} different jaw profiles on the heat sealed seams was determined by evaluating their strength and tightness. Laboratory tests were made as well as tests under practical production conditions on a vertical form-fill-seal-machine of the Transwrap 125 H type. The result was {{that the effect of}} such jaws in practical operation decisively depends on the type of the packaging material used, especially on the thickness of its <b>heat-sealable</b> layer and the heat conductivity of its components. In addition to this the pouch type also plays a decisive role as well as the question of priority of seam tightness or seam strength or if both properties are of equal importance for the evaluation of the seam quality in each individual case...|$|E
40|$|Packaging {{material}} {{consists of}} a base of paper or cardboard; a smoothing layer (2) on one side, of polyethylene; a highly crosslinked solvent-free paint layer; an inorganic barrier layer (4) on the paint layer, and a <b>heat-sealable</b> cover layer (5). Pref. the smoothing layer is of a low-density polyethylene with a surface wt. pref. of 20 - 30 g/m 2; paint is an acrylate paint with a surface wt. of 2 - 5 g/m 2; barrier layer is an Al or Al oxide layer, respectively 30 - 60 nm or 20 - 40 nm thick; and cover layer is of low-density polyethylene. Also claimed is a process for mfr. of the packaging material from a continuous base material strip on which smoothing layer is applied and paint layer is cross linked by electron beam before application of subsequent layers.

40|$|Sulfamic acid, in {{polyvinyl}} alcohol envelopes, makes {{a safe and}} convenient preservative for urine, 10 g/Iiter of urine being a satisfactory con-centration. Of several chemical procedures for urine, this preservative altered the results only for steroids. Urine samples must be acidified if accurate calcium analyses are to be obtained (1). In many institutions the nursing staff is not permitted to dispense the strong acids traditionally used to decrease the pH of urine, so that the acid must be transferred into the collection vessels in the clinical laboratory. To avoid the dangerous practice of using a caustic liquid acid as a preservative, we have enclosed a dry strong acid in a water-soluble plastic envelope, which can be included with the urine container. In this way a predetermined quantity of acid may be dispensed safely. The package may be formed from any <b>heat-sealable</b> water-soluble polymer film that does {{not interfere with the}} common laboratory test procedures. Several strong acids are available in dry form. Boric acid has been used extensively as a urine preservative, but it is relatively weak, and large quantities are required to decrease the pH. Sulfamic acid is a stable dry acid that is strongly acid in aqueous solution (pK 9, 1. 0). It is readily obtained in purified form and is safe to handle in water-soluble plastic envelopes...|$|E
40|$|The {{relation}} between the diurnal sum of atmospheric precipitation and the diurnal volume of rainwater runoff from four experimental hardened surfaces {{was the subject of}} a pilot study conducted within the area of the Departmental Agro- and Hydrometeorology Observatory in Wrocław. The selection and the structure of the experimental surfaces were preceded with an inventory-taking of the coverage of hardened surfaces within a Wrocław housing estate with high-rise multifamily buildings. That estate was the second location, next to the area of the Observatory, at which the study presented here was conducted. The surfaces included in the experiment were roof surfaces P 1 and P 2 covered with <b>heat-sealable</b> roll roofing, surface APB made of gravel-filled openwork concrete plates, and tarmac surface AS. The pilot study was conducted during the period from April to November, 2014. During that period, depending on the type of experimental surface, from 81 to 87 days with atmospheric precipitation were analysed. The mean values of the rainwater runoff coefficients for the eightmonth period were 0. 77, 0. 77, 0. 33 and 0. 67 for surfaces P 1, P 2, APB and AS, respectively. The range of variability of mean values of the coefficients of rainwater runoff from the experimental surfaces in a month is presented by the following relation: APB > P 1 > AS > P 2. The study did not reveal any direct effect of the number of rainfall days in a month on the value of the coefficient of determination describing the cor{{relation between}} the diurnal sums of precipitation and the diurnal volumes of rainwater runoff...|$|E
40|$|Non-metallic, flexible, thin, {{microchannel}} {{heat exchangers}} made from <b>heat-sealable</b> polyimide films {{have recently been}} developed for refrigeration and air-conditioning applications. In order for these heat exchangers to function properly and independently, robust and reliable connectors are needed. The connectors must be easy to manufacture and assemble, hold high pressures without leaking, resist a pullout force, and {{have the ability to}} connect to standard tubing and piping and different heat exchangers together in series and parallel. Three uniquely different functional prototype connector designs have been developed, manufactured, and tested. The first includes a machined metal connector internally embedded within the heat exchanger that is capable of holding pressures up to 0. 83 MPa and 65. 5 N of pullout force before failure. The second connector design includes a two-piece polymer assembly containing an o-ring used to seal around the inlet and outlet holes of the heat exchanger. The design incorporates a 10 -degree wedge that creates the sealing force when fully assembled with the heat exchanger and has been pressure tested to 1. 83 MPa without leaking and 73. 6 N of pullout force applied before failure. A variation of the design allows multiple heat exchangers to connect in series and in parallel. Finally, the third design contains no additional parts and connects two heat exchangers together by thermally bonding the inlet of one heat exchanger to the outlet of another. The thermally bonded connection was able to hold pressures greater than 2. 07 MPa. Finally, fatigue testing of the heat exchangers is conducted using an Instron machine to develop a stress amplitude versus number of cycles to failure diagram for the zero pressure case.
