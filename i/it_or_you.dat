500|$|Homer Simpson {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular and {{influential}} television characters by a variety of standards. USA Today cited the character as being one of the [...] "top 25 most influential people of the past 25 years" [...] in 2007, adding that Homer [...] "epitomized the irony and irreverence at the core of American humor." [...] Robert Thompson, director of Syracuse University's Center for the Study of Popular Television believes that [...] "three centuries from now, English professors are going to be regarding Homer Simpson as one of the greatest creations in human storytelling." [...] Animation historian Jerry Beck described Homer as one of the best animated characters, saying, [...] "you know someone like <b>it,</b> <b>or</b> <b>you</b> identify with (it). That's really the key to a classic character." [...] Homer has been described by The Sunday Times as [...] "the greatest comic creation of [...] time". The article remarked, [...] "every age needs its great, consoling failure, its lovable, pretension-free mediocrity. And we have ours in Homer Simpson." ...|$|E
500|$|Most of the impostors were dismissed; however, Anna Anderson's claim persisted. Books and {{pamphlets}} {{supporting her}} claims included Harriet von Rathlef's book Anastasia, ein Frauenschicksal als Spiegel der Weltkatastrophe (Anastasia, a Woman's Fate as Mirror of the World Catastrophe), {{which was published}} in Germany and Switzerland in 1928, though it was serialized by the tabloid newspaper Berliner Nachtausgabe in 1927. This was countered by works such as La Fausse Anastasie (The False Anastasia) by Pierre Gilliard and Constantin Savitch, published by Payot of Paris in 1929. Conflicting testimonies and physical evidence, such as comparisons of facial characteristics, which alternately supported and contradicted Anderson's claim, were used either to bolster or to counter the belief that she was Anastasia. In the absence of any direct documentary proof or solid physical evidence, the question of whether Anderson was Anastasia was for many a matter of personal belief. As Anderson herself said in her own idiomatic English, [...] "You either believe <b>it</b> <b>or</b> <b>you</b> don't believe it. It doesn't matter. In no anyway whatsoever." [...] The German courts were unable to decide her claim one way or another, and eventually, after 40 years of deliberation, ruled that her claim was [...] "neither established nor refuted". Dr. Günter von Berenberg-Gossler, attorney for Anderson's opponents in the later years of the legal case, said that during the German trials [...] "the press were always more interested in reporting her side of the story than the opposing bench's less glamorous perspective; editors often pulled journalists after reporting testimony delivered by her side and ignored the rebuttal, resulting in the public seldom getting a complete picture." ...|$|E
2500|$|When {{asked whether}} the Republicans were abandoning their hopes of holding onto Domenici's seat, Senator John Ensign, the {{chairman}} of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, responded that [...] "You don’t waste money on races that don’t need <b>it</b> <b>or</b> <b>you</b> can’t win." ...|$|E

2500|$|Bradley {{contends that}} the Angus have been good to her. In an {{interview}} with screenwriter Anne Rapp, Bradley acknowledged that [...] "Most women don’t want to live out this far.

2500|$|... "It's {{amazing how}} many writers got it wrong," [...] said head writer Sharon Elizabeth Doyle. [...] "I mean very good writers, too. Either you get <b>it</b> <b>or</b> <b>you</b> don't. It's so {{important}} to have the relationships right, and {{the tone of the}} relationships right, to get that it's about the language and not the story. The characters in these books aren't modern human beings. You have to believe in the characters and respect the formality of the way they are characterized." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Wall Street Journal {{reported}} {{a story of}} National Republican Senatorial Committee chairman Senator John Ensign outlining the 10 most competitive seats of the 2008 Senate Election. When asked about the two GOP seats likely to switch parties, Virginia and New Mexico, on whether the NRSC is mulling walking away to work on other seats that can be won, Ensign said, [...] "You don’t waste money on races that don’t need <b>it</b> <b>or</b> <b>you</b> can’t win.” This suggested that the NRSC may have started cutting money off.|$|E

2500|$|After {{winning the}} Nobel Prize in 1996, Curl took a quieter path than Smalley, who became an outspoken {{advocate}} of nanotechnology, and Kroto, who used his fame to further {{his interest in}} science education, saying, [...] "After winning a Nobel, you can either become a scientific pontificator, or you can have some idea for a new science project {{and you can use}} your newfound notoriety to get the resources to do <b>it.</b> <b>Or</b> <b>you</b> can say, 'Well, I enjoy what I was doing, and I want to keep doing that.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Former {{graduate}} student Richard Terrile remembers that Westphal [...] "not only taught me about astronomy and science, {{but also about}} more down-to-earth topics like self-reliance, dealing with people, and how to keep focused when things go bad.

He said, 'There are always two {{ways to deal with}} a problem: You can get angry and upset and then try and fix <b>it,</b> <b>or</b> <b>you</b> can just fix it. Which way would you rather work on it?'".|$|E
2500|$|In February 2015, Eddie Murphy {{stated that}} his cameo {{appearance}} in the pilot ironically doomed the show's chances: [...] "I was gonna be in the pilot, and they thought I should be recurring. I’m not gonna do Beverly Hills Cop on TV. I remember when they tested it — they had this little knob that you turn if you like <b>it</b> <b>or</b> <b>you</b> don’t like it. So when Axel {{shows up in the}} pilot, some people turned the knob so much, they broke it. So the network decided 'if he isn’t recurring, then this isn’t gonna happen.' So it didn’t happen." ...|$|E

2500|$|Speaking {{shortly after}} the 2015 San Bernardino shooting, Hirsi Ali commented {{on the nature of}} radicalization within {{communities}} of Islamic believers saying, [...] "If we talk about the process of what we now call radicalization, that you see a process where individuals are putting on a religious identity. It's all about being a Muslim, you shed the rest of <b>it</b> <b>or</b> <b>you</b> downplay the rest of it and you try to make everyone else as pious as yourself. And this would be, looking back at San Bernardino, the telltale signs. These changes that the family, the friends, the close circle of relatives should have observed." ...|$|E
2500|$|He {{elaborated}} on that sentiment, {{and said}} [...] "It’s a very cynically romantic text about love, {{and how we}} behave, and how we’re expected to behave. It’s a party, but there’s something darker there as well". Inspired by the exposing nature of film, Whedon decided to infuse a recurring motif of sexuality, [...] "...because it’s a visual medium. You can say <b>it</b> <b>or</b> <b>you</b> can show it. [...] There’s an element to it, of debauchery, that was fun for a time {{but then it was}} just sort of dark". Whedon's idea to adapt the play for the screen originated from having [...] "Shakespeare readings" [...] at his house with several of his friends, years prior.|$|E
2500|$|Island Records {{gave the}} band a choice: [...] "We're legally obliged {{to make your}} [...] but we’re not really up for it. So we either do it or do a half-arsed job of <b>it</b> <b>or</b> <b>you</b> can take your full record advance and leave." [...] The band took the advance {{and used it to}} build a {{recording}} studio in Watford in July 2013. A friend of the band had a lease on a few rehearsal rooms. The band initially wanted the room as a storage area for their equipment, but this soon changed into a storage and rehearsal area, then into a storage, rehearsal and recording studio. Sansom spent a week looking up studio equipment on Gumtree, which the band would drive to pick up. Two items of gear the band acquired was a tape machine and a 1980s recording console.|$|E

2500|$|Ram {{was trained}} by Ronen Moralli at the Israel Tennis Centers in Jerusalem. [...] "My first {{inspiration}} was Jo Jo Lizmi, the famous Jerusalem tennis coach, who showed {{me all the}} basic techniques. I was with him {{four or five years}} and he taught me everything – how to hold the racket, forehand, and backhand. He was very tough." [...] "But the man who really developed my game was Ronen Moralli", says Ram. [...] "He was with me in Jerusalem from when I was 10 years old, but then he moved to Wingate as the national coach." [...] Moralli recalls: [...] "When I worked with Andy at the Jerusalem Tennis Center he was very very energetic and full of passion. [...] His technical abilities weren't as good as the other kids, but he had an understanding of the game. It was something spectacular. [...] He knew when to come to the net, when to stay back. [...] This is something you are born with. [...] Either you have <b>it</b> <b>or</b> <b>you</b> don't. [...] You can teach it, but only up to a certain point, and Andy was born with it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ted Ownby of the Center for the Study of Southern Culture {{stated that}} he {{believes}} producers of shows such as Call of the Wildman [...] "build on preexisting stereotypes, so they don't need to build characters", and added that [...] "people of the South get frustrated at the narrow range of representations [...] ". Dee Davis, president of the Center for Rural Strategies, expressed his concern that the shows approach [...] "the thin line between an honest documentary and exploitative reality show". Animal Planet president Marjorie Kaplan insisted, [...] "We haven't received any negative response at all" [...] to the show. Commenting on {{the potential for the}} show to advance negative stereotypes of Southerners, Animal Planet executive Dawn Sinsel added, [...] "As with all shows that explore a subculture of America that people might not be familiar with, we're careful {{to make sure that we}} represent the talent in their true colors and not 'cover up' their natural character. Turtleman likes to catch all types of animals. We hope Ernie's carefree and loyal personality and love of animals will replace any stereotypes."

2500|$|On February 10, 2006, in {{a meeting}} of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs of which Coleman was a member, during {{testimony}} of former Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) director Michael D. Brown, Coleman attacked Brown for poor leadership during Hurricane Katrina disaster relief efforts, [...] "you didn't provide the leadership, even with structural infirmities." [...] Coleman went on, [...] "you're not prepared to kind of put a mirror in front of your face and recognize your own inadequacies" [...] and [...] "the record reflects that you didn't get <b>it</b> <b>or</b> <b>you</b> didn't in writing or in some way make commands that would move people to do {{what has to be done}} until way after it should have been done." [...] Brown responded combatively, [...] "well, Senator, that's very easy for you to say sitting behind that dais and not being there in the middle of that disaster, watching that human suffering and watching those people dying and trying to deal with those structural dysfunctionalities" [...] and implored Coleman to stick to questions. He later likened Coleman's charges to a [...] "drive-by shooting." [...] Brown had recently stated that he notified Department of Homeland Security and the White House of the tremendous scale of Katrina flooding earlier than had been previously reported.|$|E

2500|$|... "Jack and Pearl are not criminals. They're not angels either. Villains perhaps? Well, he {{certainly}} is. They've {{been married for}} fifteen years, and haven't had sex {{with each other for}} thirteen of them. The marriage is a front {{for the sake of the}} pub's image. The daughter, Tracey is adopted—maybe for the same reason. They have a dog too—Prince—an Alsatian...Even with a marriage on the rocks, Jack still likes the area. His mates are here, it's friendly and it's his territory. [...] "Local lad makes good"...People look up to him. If you've dragged yourself up by the scruff of the neck and moved up a notch, you need a few people around you who didn't quite make <b>it,</b> <b>or</b> <b>you</b> might as well be invisible. He's had a mistress for five years...Unlike Pearl, she's a very up-market woman, a lady, real class. Jack's her bit of rough, and they're happy. They actually talk. With Pearl, you shout - or shut up...He's a smart dresser. Changes his shirt twice a day and his shoes sparkle. He runs a good pub. He's firm and fair with the staff (if you've got any problems—go to him, not her.) The cellars are well organised and spotless. His masculinity is the key to his character. It was called into question at an early stage in his marriage and he's defended it ever since. Some call him a ladies' man (because of his good looks) others - a man's man...He's a con man and has the gift of the gab. He can defend himself smartly in a brawl. (He's only ever thumped Pearly once.) You can accept Jack being a snob—because it's not malicious: it's done with a grin. Like Pearl, he's also trapped by is background...Jack and Pearl's relationship is pretty heated...The smooth public face (workers in pubs are always on stage); the trial reconciliations; the rows; the fights and the tears...Will Jack ever bring his mistress into the pub, which is Pearl's territory? Will Pearl accept too many free drinks from punters and lose control in public?...They were lovers. They are husband and wife. There was affection...love...if it came to it, could they give each other up? The private grins and winks to each other when they're working as a team—which usually means taking money. The love turning to hatred...Jack the lad and the artificial Pearl...They're an electric couple." [...] (page 74).|$|E
