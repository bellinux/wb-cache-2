40|$|Fasting is {{a common}} {{procedure}} for animals in experiments. Although fasting may be necessary for scientific reasons, it should be minimized. In the current study, jugular-catheterized male Sprague–Dawley rats in metabolism cages were <b>fasted</b> <b>for</b> 0 to 24 h before measurement of various physiologic markers (serum chemistry, CBC analysis, serum corticosterone). When controlled <b>for</b> cohort, rats <b>fasted</b> <b>for</b> 6 and 16 h had significantly lower serum glucose than did nonfasted rats. Other values {{did not differ from}} controls. Only rats <b>fasted</b> <b>for</b> 24 h had elevated serum corticosterone levels. Therefore, <b>fasting</b> <b>for</b> as long as 16 h has fewer effects on rats that does <b>fasting</b> <b>for</b> 24 h. <b>Fasting</b> <b>for</b> 24 h or more therefore should receive appropriate consideration by both scientists and the IACUC in the experimental design and the animal-use protocol...|$|R

5|$|If {{a spider}} walks under a P. schultzi female's capture web and the {{vertical}} distance {{is less than}} 8centimetres, the P. schultzi often drops onto the prey too <b>fast</b> <b>for</b> a human eye to follow. If the P. schultzi misses, it quickly returns up its safety line to its vantage point and looks for another chance - and seldom misses the second time. Most drops cover two to four centimetres, as longer drops are often obstructed by the web.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, bands {{from across the}} United States began to move towards {{what would become the}} glam metal sound. In 1981, Mötley Crüe (from Los Angeles) {{released}} their first album Too <b>Fast</b> <b>for</b> Love, Dokken (also from Los Angeles) released their first Breaking the Chains, and Kix (from western Maryland) released their first album, Kix. In 1982, Night Ranger (from San Francisco) released their initial album Dawn Patrol which reached the top 40 in the United States.|$|E

About 33% thinner {{than its predecessor}} and 15% lighter, the iPad 2 has a better processor, a dual core Apple A5 that Apple says is {{twice as fast as}} its predecessor for CPU operations and up to nine times as <b>fast</b> <b>for</b> GPU operations. The iPad 2 includes front and back cameras that support the FaceTime videophone application, as well as a three-axis gyroscope. It retained the original's 10‑hour battery life and had a similar pricing scheme.|$|E

40|$|The study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the effects of dietary supplementation of oregano essential oil (OEO) on the morphological development of small intestine of broilers with different feeding times (immediate, 24, 48 or 72 h posthatching delayed feeding) from d 0 to 14. The diets were supplemented with: no, 250 or 500 mg/kg of the OEO (OEO 250 and OEO 500, respectively). <b>Fasting</b> <b>for</b> 72 h significantly increased the weight and length of small intestine segments of broilers on d 14. The OEO 250 and OEO 500 significantly increased the jejunum villus height of chickens fed immediately and the duodenum villus height of broilers <b>fasted</b> <b>for</b> 48 h. The duodenum villus surface area of chickens <b>fasted</b> <b>for</b> 48 h and the ileum villus surface area of broilers <b>fasted</b> <b>for</b> 24 h were significantly increased by the OEO 250. The OEO 500 significantly enhanced the duodenum villus surface area of broilers <b>fasted</b> <b>for</b> 24 h and their ileum villus surface area <b>fasted</b> <b>for</b> 48 h. The crypt depths of small intestine segments of broilers <b>fasted</b> <b>for</b> 72 h were significantly reduced by OEO 250 and OEO 500. In conclusion, the dose of phenolic compounds in OEO reaching the small intestine might be enough for protecting the intestinal epithelial cells from damages of toxins and for removing {{the negative effects of}} delayed feeding on the morphological development of all the small intestine segments of broiler chicks on d 14...|$|R

5|$|The Beaufort was too <b>fast</b> <b>for</b> the torpedoes available, so new tactics {{had to be}} {{developed}} and the aircraft was restricted to mine-laying or bombing missions. It was soon grounded for other reasons. After No. 22 Squadron carried out more trials, it began operations on 31 August 1940. On 11 September a torpedo attack succeeded in hitting a 6,000 ton freighter. On 17 September No. 22, 53 and 57 Squadron sank a 1,600 ton freighter in Cherbourg harbour. An E-boat was also destroyed and oil tanks were also set ablaze and burned uncontrollably for several days. The cost was a single Beaufort.|$|E
5|$|The {{second child}} of Johnstone Melmore and Jessie Francis Leech, Leech {{was born in}} Bendigo in Australia. She was given the name Faith after her elder sister, who died from leukaemia {{at the age of}} two. A {{delicate}} child, Leech had an aversion to eating {{in the first two years}} of her life, so her mother fed her in small hourly doses. Leech was twice rushed from the family home to a Melbourne hospital. Conventional medicine failed to rectify Leech's dietary issues, so her mother put her on a <b>fast</b> <b>for</b> ten days at the recommendation of a naturopath. Leech was later placed on a diet of fruit, salad and vegetables, with an emphasis on beetroot juice and carrot juice.|$|E
5|$|Ticks satisfy all {{of their}} {{nutritional}} requirements as ectoparasites, feeding on a diet of blood. They are obligate hematophages, needing blood to survive and move from one stage of life to another. Ticks can <b>fast</b> <b>for</b> long periods but eventually die if {{unable to find a}} host. This behavior evolved approximately 120 million years ago through adaptation to blood-feeding. The behavior evolved independently in the separate tick families, with differing host-tick interactions driving the evolutionary change.|$|E

5|$|Allen {{played for}} Cambridge in 1922. He was {{left out of}} the team's first game; as the University was playing Middlesex, he played for the {{opposition}} instead and took six for 13. Around this time, he began to bowl <b>fast</b> <b>for</b> the first time. After success in the following games—including ten wickets in the game against Sussex—Allen was awarded his blue by being selected for the University Match against Oxford at Lord's. In that game, he had match figures of nine for 78 in a comfortable Cambridge victory. This was Cambridge's last game of the season—Allen had taken 49 first-class wickets at an average of 15. There were suggestions in the press at the time that Allen illegally threw, rather than bowled, the ball. In his biography of Allen, E. W. Swanton writes that these rumours were neither widespread nor repeated later in Allen's career, and that they may have resulted from a one-off lapse. Towards the end of the season, Allen returned to the Middlesex team and his 15 wickets placed him {{at the top of the}} county's bowling averages.|$|E
5|$|Amundsen {{was born}} in Fredrikstad (around 80km from Christiania (now Oslo)), Norway, in 1872, {{the son of a}} ship-owner. In 1893, he {{abandoned}} his medical studies at Christiania University and signed up as a seaman aboard the sealer Magdalena for a voyage to the Arctic. After several further voyages he qualified as a second mate; when not at sea, he developed his skills as a cross-country skier in the harsh environment of Norway's Hardangervidda plateau. In 1896, inspired by the polar exploits of his countryman Fridtjof Nansen, Amundsen joined the Belgian Antarctic Expedition as mate, aboard Belgica under Adrien de Gerlache. Early in 1898 the ship became trapped by pack ice in the Bellinghausen Sea, and was held <b>fast</b> <b>for</b> almost a year. The expedition thus became, involuntarily, the first to spend a complete winter in Antarctic waters, a period marked by depression, near-starvation, insanity, and scurvy among the crew. Amundsen remained dispassionate, recording everything and using the experience as an education in all aspects of polar exploration techniques, particularly aids, clothing and diet.|$|E
5|$|In 1994, Ayrton Senna joined Hill at Williams. As {{the reigning}} champion, this time Prost, was again no longer racing, Hill {{retained}} his number '0'. The pre-season betting was that Senna would coast to the title, {{but with the}} banning of electronic driver aids, the Benetton team and Michael Schumacher initially proved more competitive and won the first three races. At the San Marino Grand Prix on 1 May, Senna died after his car went off the road. With the team undergoing investigation from the Italian authorities on manslaughter charges, Hill found himself team leader with only one season's experience in the top flight. It was widely reported {{at the time that}} the Williams car's steering column had failed, though Hill told BBC Sport in 2004 that he believed Senna simply took the corner too <b>fast</b> <b>for</b> the conditions, referring to the fact that the car had just restarted the race with cold tyres after being slowed down by a safety car.|$|E

5|$|Journalist Ralph McGill, once a {{teammate}} of Cody's, said: He {{was a great}} big fellow {{and one of the}} most seriously dedicated fellows I've ever met. He was a farm boy and he didn't have any polish but he was very honest and sincere. He didn't have scholarshipwe had none in those days but he had a real job. He literally cleaned the gymnasium every day, cleaned up the locker rooms and the showers, and tended to the coal furnace after practice. He was a big man, squarely built, quiet, almost shy, and enormously decent. He practiced long hours to place kick and became the team's place kicker. He wasn't fast, but he was <b>fast</b> <b>for</b> a big man. He didn't like to wear pads. He got a hold of an old quilt and sewed it to the shoulders of the jersey and that was all the padding he wore.|$|E
5|$|Now {{beginning}} to compose independently, Rachmaninoff's next project {{was a group}} he titled Three Nocturnes, and is regarded as his first serious attempt at writing for the piano. The first nocturne, in F-sharp minor, was written 14-21 November 1887, and has three parts: a beginning and an end in andante cantabile and a central section in allegro. The slower andantes are gentle sections, influenced by Pyotr Tchaikovsky, while the allegro is unnatural and stiff and unusually <b>fast</b> <b>for</b> a nocturne. The second piece, in F major, followed on 22-25 November, also contains a slower portion coupled with a quick section. No. 3, in C minor, {{took more than a}} month to compose, dated from 3 December 1886 to 12 January 1887. With a chordal texture spread over the entire keyboard, it is reminiscent of the music of Robert Schumann. The nocturnes were published posthumously in Moscow in 1949, but were not assigned an opus number.|$|E
5|$|The diplosegments of millipedes {{have evolved}} in {{conjunction}} with their burrowing habits, and nearly all millipedes adopt a mainly subterranean lifestyle. They use three main methods of burrowing; bulldozing, wedging and boring. Members of the orders Julida, Spirobolida and Spirostreptida, lower their heads and barge {{their way into the}} substrate, the collum being the portion of their exoskeleton that leads the way. Flat-backed millipedes in the order Polydesmida tend to insert their front end, like a wedge, into a horizontal crevice, and then widen the crack by pushing upwards with their legs, the paranota in this instance constituting the main lifting surface. Boring is used by members of the order Polyzoniida. These have smaller segments at the front and increasingly large ones further back; they propel themselves forward into a crack with their legs, the wedge-shaped body widening the gap as they go. Some millipedes have adopted an above-ground lifestyle and lost the burrowing habit. This may be because they are too small to have enough leverage to burrow, or because they are too large to make the effort worthwhile, or in some cases because they move relatively <b>fast</b> (<b>for</b> a millipede) and are active predators.|$|E

5|$|The fate of {{the first}} egg is mostly unknown, but studies on the related royal penguin and erect-crested penguin show the female tips the egg out when the larger second egg is laid. The task of {{incubating}} the egg {{is divided into three}} roughly equal sessions of around 12days each over a five-week period. The first session is shared by both parents, followed by the male returning to sea, leaving the female alone to tend the egg. Upon the male's return, the female goes off to sea and does not return until the chick has hatched. Both sexes <b>fast</b> <b>for</b> a considerable period during breeding; the male fasts for 37days after arrival until he returns to sea for around 10 days before fasting while incubating eggs and young for another 36days, and the female fasts for 42days from her arrival after the male until late in the incubation period. Both adults lose 36–40% of their body weight during this period. The second egg hatches around 34days after it is laid. Macaroni penguins typically leave their breeding colony by April or May to disperse into the ocean.|$|E
