The FT-IR, contact angle and DLS measurements demonstrated a linkage of organic functional groups to the nano-TiO 2, resulting in improved agglomeration resistance. Then, the modified nano-TiO 2 was {{employed as a}} functional additive to prepare the polyester/nano-TiO 2 composites by melt-blend extrusion method. With a real-time FT-IR study, the nano-TiO 2 exhibited a promoting effect on the crosslinking reaction of polyester with TGIC. Furthermore, the <b>gloss</b> <b>retention,</b> colour aberration and the surface morphologies of the composites during an accelerated UV ageing were investigated. The {{results indicated that the}} nanocomposites exhibited much less degree of ageing degradation, due to a strong UV shielding ability of the nano-TiO 2. Particularly, the polyester/nano-TiO 2 presented an improvement of 42.5 % in the <b>gloss</b> <b>retention</b> and a reduction of 27.6 % in the colour aberration after 1500  h UV ageing. This work proposed a dry modification method for the nano-TiO 2 and its application as functional nanoscale additive, which are highly available for the widespread applications of polyester resin/TiO 2 composites, and would provide considerable insights into the protection of natural and synthetic carbohydrate polymers from the UV irradiation.|$|E

40|$|The {{combination}} {{of the characteristics of}} oil, or alkyd, emulsions and acrylic latexes in a waterborne binder has been the object of various studies in the past. Strategies for combining the positive properties of alkyds, e. g. autoxidative curing, gloss and penetration in wood, with the fast drying and <b>gloss</b> and color <b>retention</b> properties of acrylic latexes have mainly been directed towards the modification of the alkyd with an acrylate during alkyd synthesis followed by emulsification. This paper describes the preparation and application of oil-acrylic hybrid latexes as binders for waterborne coatings. The hybrid latexes were prepared using hydroperoxidized triglycerides as initiators for the mini-emulsion polymerization of acrylates in an Fe(II) /EDTA/SFS redox system. The particle morphology of hybrids initiated by fatty-acid hydroperoxides was compared with tert-butyl hydroperoxide-initiated systems. Cryo-TEM analysis indicated that, whereas tert-butyl hydroperoxide initiation resulted in the formation of heterogeneous particles, fatty-acid hydroperoxide-initiated hybrid particles showed no intra-particle heterogeneity. An AFM study of the film formation process of the oil/alkyd-acrylic hybrid latexes showed that phase separation occurred between the oil and the acrylic phases upon drying, resulting in films that consist of deformed acrylic particles embedded in a continuous matrix of oil. This results in a very smooth surface of the film...|$|R

30|$|The {{photodegradation}} {{of biological}} materials {{is a great}} challenge to overcome for outdoor application of biomass products. In this study, an organic UV absorber coating that consist of a UV-curing paint, ethyl acetate, anhydrous alcohol, and BTZ- 1 was prepared, and the behaviour of this coating applied on OBS (sample D) when exposed to UV radiation was investigated. The colour characterization has demonstrated {{the efficiency of the}} organic UV absorber coating in promoting the stability of L* and ∆E*. The results of glossiness showed that the organic UV absorber coating exhibited a high <b>gloss</b> <b>retention</b> during weathering treatment. A positive correlation between CAs and SFE stabilities of samples and the application amount of the organic UV absorber (BTZ- 1) was noticed. The chemical structure of the coating after the addition of the organic UV absorber became more stable during exposure. The slight colour change, high <b>gloss</b> <b>retention,</b> slight CAs/SFE changes, and high functional group stability illustrate that the rate of degradation is much lower for sample D with the applied coat d than that for the control sample (A and B). In conclusion, the addition of the organic UV absorber improved the exterior durability of OBS. The coating d is considered to be the best UV shielding layer in this study and is effective in protecting OBS and reducing the surface photodegradation of the substrate and the coating.|$|E

The {{aim of this}} paper was to systematically review the literature on how nanofills and submicrons react to polishing procedures and surface challenges in vitro compared with microhybrids. The paper has also given an overview of the compositional characteristics of all resin composites and polishing systems whose performance was presented herein. DATA: The database search for the effect of filler size on surface smoothness and gloss of commercial composites retrieved 702 eligible studies. After deduplication, 438 records were examined by the titles and abstracts; 400 studies were excluded and 38 articles were assessed for full-text reading. An additional 11 papers were selected by hand-searching. In total, 28 articles met inclusion criteria and were included in the study. SOURCES: The databases analyzed were MEDLINE/PubMed, ISI Web of Science, and SciVerse Scopus. STUDY SELECTION: Papers were selected if they presented a comparison between nanofill or submicron and microhybrid composites with quantitative analysis of smoothness and/or gloss on baseline and/or after any aging protocol to assess smoothness and <b>gloss</b> <b>retention.</b> Only in vitro studies written in English were included.

40|$|Hindered amine light {{stabilisers}} (HALS) are {{one class}} of additive {{known to be}} effective in retarding polymer degradation and have been deployed in a range of polymer-based surface coating applications. The use of HALS significantly improves <b>gloss</b> and colour <b>retention</b> of coatings in addition to maintaining surface integrity – resulting in a superior commercial product. Despite their demonstrable efficacy, the precise mechanism by which HALS protect coatings remains an open discussion. It is widely believed that HALS operate as chain-breaking antioxidants whereby, initially, the parent compound undergoes sacrificial oxidation of a heterocyclic amine to form an aminoxyl radical. It is this persistent aminoxyl radical that acts as a free radical scavenging intermediate and is thought to be involved in converting harmful free radicals to less harmful evenelectron species. In theory, this process could repeat indefinitely but empirical evidence suggests HALS become less effective over time suggesting that further investigation of their mechanism of action is required. The overarching goal of this research was to identify molecular-level changes in HALS within polymer systems. To achieve this required the development of new analytical methods that were sensitive to changes in molecular structure and abundance of HALS present in polymer-based surface coatings. The scope of this PhD project encompassed two major objectives. Firstly, to develop ambient ionisation mass spectrometric methods capable of interrogating additives within polymer-based surface coatings. Traditional mass spectrometry (MS) methods have long been employed for the characterisation of both polymers H vi and polymer additives but recent developments in the field suggest new approaches could provide distinct advantages for polymer analysis. Notable among these technological advancements are a class of desorption/ionisation methods capable of analysing solid and liquid material in its native state, under ambient conditions. These ambient ionisation MS methods are distinct from traditional MS in that they permit direct desorption and ionisation of analytes {{from a wide variety of}} substrates with minimum sample preparation, i. e., extraction, pre-concentration, and chromatographic separation are not required. Uncovering the true potential of these ambient sampling and ionisation methods for MS of synthetic polymers and their components is a major focus of the research undertaken for this thesis. The second objective was to use these optimised techniques to characterise changes in molecular structure and abundance of HALS in different polymers - mostly polyester and polyacrylate surface coatings - induced by different preparations and in-service conditions Results reported herein accomplish the objectives of method development and application. Three ambient ionisation mass spectrometry methods have been developed for polymer and polymer additive analysis. These are desorption electrospray ionisation (DESI), liquid extraction surface analysis (LESA), and paint spray ionisation – a new technique developed as a part of this PhD project. All three techniques are capable of detecting HALS directly from within the bulk polymer, removing laborious sample preparation steps required with traditional MS. Each technique is able to provide complementary information on the spatial distribution and change in molecular structure of HALS compounds. Applying these methods to polyester paint samples led to the discovery that all N-functionalised HALS (N-CH 3, N-C(O) CH 3, and N-OR) generate a substantial population of secondary amine (N-H). Detection of this molecular-level change represents key experimental evidence for a major role for secondary amines as intermediates in mechanisms of HALS stabilisation of polymers. These findings are consistent with the results of recent high-level computational studies that also identify secondary amines as a critical reaction intermediate and repository of active HALS (G. Gryn 2 ̆ 7 ova, K. Ingold and M. L. Coote, J. Am. Chem. Soc., 2012, 134, 12979 - 12988). The study suggested formation of secondary amines from N-OR functionalised HALS would primarily occur by hydrogen abstraction and subsequent β-scission under normal service temperatures (25 - 80 °C). At low radical concentrations or at high temperatures associated with curing (260 °C), secondary amine formation via direct N-OR bond homolysis may become competitive. Both mechanisms are consistent with the observed experimental presented data and the combination of these results represents a significant advancement in understanding the mechanisms of protection of polymers by HALS...|$|R

AIM: To determine the influence of the filler size content on surface, optical and mechanical properties before and after accelerated aging. METHODS: Seven resin composites were investigated: Filtek Supreme® (3 M/ESPE), Estelite &# 931; Quick® (Tokuyama), Evolu-X® (Dentsply), Esthet-X HD® (Dentsply), Opallis® (FGM), Herculite XRV Ultra® (Kerr) and Filtek Z 250 ® (3 M/ESPE). Elastic modulus (EM) and flexural strength (FS) were determined by three-point bending of specimens immersed or not in absolute ethanol for seven days. Roughness (Ra) and gloss (G. U.) analyses were determined before and after ethanol storage for seven days and CIELAB color change (&# 916;E*) was obtained with a spectrophotometer. Results were analyzed by two-way ANOVA (general linear model) for EM and FS, with repeated measures for roughness and gloss, and one-way ANOVA for &# 916;E*.

This JTR is made available as a reference for future pollution prevention endeavors by other NASA centers, the Department of Defense and commercial users to minimize duplication of effort. All coating system candidates were tested using approved NASA and AFSPC standard coating systems as experimental controls. This study looked at eight alternative coating systems and two control coating systems and was divided into Phase I Screening Tests, Phase II Tests, and Field Testing. The Phase I Screening Tests were preliminary tests performed on all the selected candidate coating systems. Candidate coating systems that did not meet the acceptance criteria of the screening tests were eliminated from further testing. Phase I Screening Tests included: Ease of Application, Surface Appearance, Dry-To-Touch (Sanding), Accelerated Storage Stability, Pot Life (Viscosity), Cure Time (Solvent Rubs), Cleanability, Knife Test, Tensile (pull-off) Adhesion, and X-Cut Adhesion by Wet Tape After a review of the Phase I test results, four of the alternative coating systems showed substandard performance in relation to the Control Systems and were eliminated from the Phase II testing.

To prepare the ormosil coating solutions, a crosslinking agent hexamethoxymethylmelamine (HMMM) and a blocked acid catalyst p-toluenesulphonic (p-TSA) were combined with the sol-gel solution. Aluminum substrates were dip coated and cured at 130 degrees C for 45 min. Effectiveness of HMMM as a crosslinking agent was analyzed by evaluating corrosion resistance, chemical resistance and hydrophobicity of coating using potentiodynamic polarization method, immersion test and water contact angle, respectively. UV stability of sol-gel solution, ormosil coating formulation and coated substrate was also studied using UV-vis spectroscopy and UV-weatherometer to see performance of coating in outdoor application. Thermal behavior of ormosil was characterized using TGA and DSC. Surface morphology and structural characteristics were also characterized using SEM, AFM and FIF-IR-RAS (reflection absorption spectroscopy).

Additionally, Scanning Electron Microscopy Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (SEM/EDX) and elemental surface mapping analysis were carried out. Laboratory testing of coating systems included Adhesion, Porosity, Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) analysis and cyclic UV/Salt Fog exposure. The performance of the ten coatings on all the substrates was good, but there were differences in <b>gloss</b> <b>retention</b> and on the degree of checking of the different coatings. The only significant difference in performance of the coatings compared to the method used for cleaning the substrate was higher undercreep observed for most of the coatings applied to the ultra-high pressure water jetted system. This shows the importance of substrate preparation due to the sensitivity of the coatings to even low levels of salt. Two coatings did not show increased undercreep and these may be more applicable for offshore maintenance applications where dry abrasive blasting is sometimes not used. The chemical treatment cleaning method used prior to coating application did not show any significant positive or negative effect on the performance of the applied coatings. The fact that the only differences in performance for the coatings applied to the differently prepared substrates was seen for undercreep suggests that the difference may be exacerbated for immersion situations. A follow up study to this one will examine the performance of internal coatings using immersion tests, and {{it will be interesting to}} see if these show increased effect on coating performance...|$|E
40|$|Paint coatings/films having pigments/filler particles, in general, are of {{technological}} importance {{because of their}} wide usage. Traditional quality control testing methods used in industry, such as tensile tests on bulk paint samples, and quick tests such as pencil scratch test, often could not predict coating performance during usage. Coating performance includes strength of adherence, scratch/mar resistance, erosion resistance, formability, colour fastness and <b>gloss</b> <b>retention.</b> Of particular interest in this thesis, is {{the determination of the}} elastic modulus of the coatings, since it can be linked to the cross-linking density and hence to the performance of the paint. The best way to evaluate performance are laboratory simulation tests and field exposure tests, but these tests often take weeks or years (in the latter case) to generate meaningful results, thus are not suitable for quality control (QC) purposes. It is therefore imperative to develop an improved quality control tool for quick assessment of pigmented paint coatings suitable for use in the industrial environment. Unlike unpigmented paint coatings, such as automotive top coats, pigmented coats have an inherent roughness imparted by the colour pigments and filler particles which makes determination of the paint matrix by indentation methods difficult. Three-body abrasion, caused by the dislodgment of these hard particles, also adds to the difficulties of interpreting scratch test results. The relationship between crosslink density in paint matrix and mechanical properties, such as ductility, is known [1], and can be correlated to scratch resistance. However, such correlation was difficult to establish in pigmented paint coatings as dislodgement of pigments during scratch tests sometimes led to accelerated wear. Indentation testing would yield information on paint properties, such as elastic modulus and hardness, without causing the dislodgement of pigments. Each indentation test typically takes a few minutes, making it an ideal candidate as a rapid quality control tool. The major drawback in using indentation techniques on soft, compliant materials such as polymers which make up the paint matrix are the timedependent response (creep at fixed load or stress relaxation on fixed displacement), leading to steeper and even negative unloading slopes and hence inaccurate modulus values. The literature review briefly covers some of the commonly used testing methods employed in industry for polymer coatings. Micro- and nano-indentation methods for the determination of elastic modulus are covered in detail. The effect of creep pertaining to indentation testing, and the treatment thereof, is also reviewed. The experimental work firstly examined the applicability of commercial microindentation equipment as QC tools. The results showed that these instruments could qualitatively differentiate the elastic modulus between paint coatings having different degrees of curing (hence differing crosslink densities and resultant mechanical properties), as well as different pigment/filler types and contents. However, creep affected the calculated values of the elastic modulus. Mechanical models using springs and dashpots to estimate elastic modulus values from the creep response were investigated, as were analytical methods to nullify the effect of creep in the unloading response. From this work it was proposed that the Boltzmann superposition principle (where strain response to a complex stress history for a linear viscoelastic material resulting from a complex loading history, is the algebraic sum of the strains due to each individual step in load) be used to extrapolate and then ‘subtract’ the creep displacement response during unloading to yield a more accurate value for the elastic modulus. This contribution provides the groundwork for possible future development of a rapid QC tool for industrial use...|$|E
40|$|In this study,Three {{kinds of}} drying oils for the {{manufacturing}} water soluble air-drying alkyd resins,then blend {{it with a}} high imino methylated melamine resin crosslinker, neutralizing agents and other additives for wood coatings and then the properties of paints were investigated. The molecular weight and its distribution were determined by Gel Permeation Chromatography (GPC). The rheological properties were measured by Viscometer, and the drying time of film was obtained by drying recorder. The crosslinking reaction and weatherability were determined by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR). Differential Scanning Calorimeter (DSC) {{was used to evaluate}} the curing kinetics. It was found that the nature of drying oils, neutralizing agents, and cosolvents would significantly influence on the molecular weight, viscosity, stability, drying time and curing kinetics of the paints. When the tung/castor oil, was used as resin generally it showed a higher molecular weight and viscosity than those using soybean or linseed oil. The diethylamine neutralizing agent for paints exhibited the best stability and lower viscosity, In contrast, ammonia exhibited lower stability. The paints which included the resin that using linseed oil,ammonia and butyl cellosolve (EGMBE), showing the fastest drying time for coating film. However, the drying time of the film was found to be significantly decreased, due to blending it with high imino methylated melamine resin. But the crosslinking peak was very weak on the FTIR plot. It was also found that below 109 ℃ during the solvent evaporation stage,the endothermic peak occurred and it would suppress the DSC exotherm associated with the autooxidation crosslinking reaction. However,the temperature was above 109 ℃,the solvent would be completely evaporated,and exothermic reaction would occur,therefore the crosslinking reaction of amino alkyd resin at high temperature would be performed. It was found that the solvent may significantly influence on thermal behavior, and it was also found that the alkyd resin with more iodine value and lower preexponential constant (InZ) and lower activation energy, generally it would have a short drying time. The physical and chemical properties of the coating film depended on the rate of evaporation and stability of the neutralizing agent and the number of unsaturated double bond and hydroxyl group of oil modified alkyd resin. The paints those including the neutralizing agent and using ammonia, showed the best film hardness and water-resistance; but the paint using diethylamine system, exhibited a higher thermal degradation than that of the other 2 kinds of neutralizing agents. Regarding the evaluation of paint which contained a drying oil, linseed oil modified resin, it had a higher film hardness. In contrast, a blend of the drying oil which soybean oil was used as modified resin, it showed both better water-resistance and thermal degradation-resistance. In addition, whatever the substrate was used as coating, {{it was found that the}} film had good flexibility after 15 cycles of cold and hot treatment. In order to qualify the weatherability, the coated wood was placed in the artificially accelerated weatherometer (enclosed carbon-arc type) for 240 hours. The paint system which included ammonia and soybean oil modified resin still maintained a higher <b>gloss</b> <b>retention</b> than that of the other formulations. In addition,the film of the coated wood appeared to have better appearance after 240 hours of exposure. According to the SRS-FTIR measurement, the absorption peak of the methoxyl group (915 cm- 1) and alkyl group (1376 cm- 1) disappeared after 240 hours of exposure. The absorption peak of the triazine ring (1556 cm- 1) disappeared after 268 hours, while the absorption peaks of the carbonyl group(1710 cm- 1, 1721 cm- 1) increased after 268 hours. It was found that the fastest drying time for coating film in air was the alkyd resin containing 5 % trimethylol propane diallyl ether (TMPDAE). Alkyd resin containing 10 % or 15 % had a longer drying time, therefore it would not have any improved effect. With a relative humidity under 65 % and various temperature, it was found that in creasing the temperature resulted in an increased speed of the drying of the film. It also indicated the synergism of both temperature and relative humidity in affecting the drying rate of film. The alkyd resin coating containing 5 % TMPDAE in air at 50 ℃ and under 45 % RH, 2 hours drying time would be required. When UV illumination was applied, the drying time was reduced to 1 hour. Under these condition, the drying time of film was 9 - 18 times faster than drying in air at 25 ℃ and under 65 %RH condition. With a DSC experiment, it was found that increasing the TMPDAE content, resulted in an increasing in the speed of the crosslinking reaction of the film. This indicated that the synergism of temperature and TMPDAE would affect the rate of crosslinking reaction. 高亞胺型甲基化三聚氰胺樹脂可作為水溶性醇酸樹脂之架橋劑，在不需添加酸觸媒下能夠調配氣乾型水性塗料。使用膠體滲透層析儀 (GPC) ， 霍氏 轉換紅外線光譜儀(FTIR) ，示差掃瞄熱卡儀(DSC) 及其他相關儀器 ，評估 樹脂塗料系統之性質及塗膜性能，結果歸納如下： 1. 樹脂塗料之分子量、黏度、穩定性、乾燥性、硬化動力學及塗膜物理 化學性能，主要受乾性油種類，中和劑種類所影響。桐油／篦麻油者 顯示最高分子量及黏度，依次為大豆油及亞麻仁油者；二乙胺中和之 塗料具有最佳穩定性及低黏度；氨者則穩定性最差，含亞麻仁油變性 之結合劑、氨中和劑及乙二醇單丁醚(EGMBE) 共溶劑之配方，塗膜乾 燥速度最快。 2.

40|$|Resumo: O objetivo deste estudo {{in vitro}} foi avaliar as propriedades físicas de uma resina composta nanoparticulada submetida ao envelhecimento {{artificial}} acelerado (AAA), ac&# 807;a&# 771;o de agentes clareadores e manchamento extrínseco. O estudo foi dividido em 2 experimentos. O experimento 1 avaliou a influência do AAA e do peróxido de carbamida a 16 % com diferentes espessantes na retenção do brilho (GU), cor (), microdureza (KHN) e rugosidade média (Ra) de superfície do compósito. A análise qualitativa da superfície de resina foi realizada através de microscopia de força atômica. Cem amostras cilíndricas (7, 0 mm x 2, 0 mm) foram confeccionadas e distribuídas aleatoriamente em 10 grupos (n= 10). Somente metade dos grupos foram envelhecidos. Para o tratamento clareador/espessante, os grupos com e sem AAA foram divididos em: peróxido de carbamida 16 % (PC) com carbopol, PC com natrosol, gel de carbopol, gel de natrosol e sem tratamento (controle). Os dados obtidos foram analisados por meio de ANOVA doisfatores e teste de Tukey. Para o as comparações múltiplas foram realizadas pelos teste de Tukey e Dunnett. Os valores de rugosidade foram analisados pelos testes de Kruskal Wallis, Dunn e Mann Whitney. O nível de significância considerado foi de 5 %. O PC com carbopol promoveu redução apenas na microdureza do compósito, diferindo estatisticamente do controle. Para o PC com natrosol esta alteração não foi observada. O PC com carbopol aumentou a rugosidade e diminuiu o brilho das resinas envelhecidas, enquanto o natrosol só o briho foi reduzido, diferindo estatisticamente do grupo controle. O Experimento 2 avaliou a influência dos tratamentos clareadores em diferentes concentrações e manchamento com café na propriedades físicas anteriormente citadas daresina nanoparticulada, submetidas ou não ao AAA. Duas amostras representativas de cada grupo foram avaliadas em microscopia eletrônica de varredura. Cento e vinte amostras cilíndricas foram confeccionadas, semelhante ao estudo anterior, distribuídas em 12 grupos (n= 10). Metade das amostras foram envelhecidas artificialmente. Para o tratamento clareador/pigmentação, os grupos com e sem AAA, foram divididos em: peróxido decarbamida a 10 % (PC 10 %), peróxido de hidrogênio a 35 % (PH 35 %) e sem tratamento clareador, com e sem pigmentação por café. Os dados foram coletados e submetidos a ANOVA três fatores e teste de Tukey para comparações múltiplas. Para o as comparac&# 807;ões múltiplas foram realizadas pelos testes de Tukey e Dunnett (&# 945;= 0, 05). Nas resinas sem envelhecimento, os agentes clareadores reduziram a microdureza do compósito,entretanto a rugosidade, brilho e cor não apresentaram alterações. Após o envelhecimento, o PC 10 % aumentou a rugosidade e diminuiu o brilho comparado ao PH 35 %. A pigmentação também reduziu a microdureza das resinas sem e com envelhecimento e alterou a cor das resinas envelhecidas. Portanto, a ação dos géis clareadores reduziu a microdureza do nanocompósito, sendo que a composição do gel clareador influenciou nessa alteração. O AAA promoveu significativas alterações nas propriedades físicas avaliadas, além de favorecer uma maior degradação da superfície da resina pelo agente clareador e este efeito contribuiu para um maior manchamento extrínseco. Abstract: nanocomposite subjected to artificial accelerated aging (AAA), {{to the action}} of bleaching agents and to extrinsic staining. This study was divided into two experiments. Experiment 1 : evaluate the influence on a composite surface of AAA and 16 % carbamide peroxide with different thickeners, in <b>gloss</b> <b>retention</b> (GU), color (&# 916;E), microhardness (KHN) and roughness (Ra). Qualitative analysis of the resin surface was performed by atomic force microscopy. One hundred cylindrical samples (7. 0 mm x 2. 0 mm) were prepared and randomly divided into 10 groups (n = 10). Only half of the groups were aged. For the bleaching/thickening treatment, the groups with and without AAA were divided into groups/ treatments: 16 % carbamide peroxide (PC) with carbopol, PC natrosol, carbopol gel,natrosol gel and untreated (control). Data were submitted to two-way ANOVA and Tukey’s test for multiple comparisons. The multiple comparisons for were performed by using Tukey’s and Dunnett’s tests, and roughness values was analysed by using Kruskal-Wallis,Dunn’s, and Mann-Whitney’s tests (&# 945; = 0. 05). The PC with carbopol promoted a decreased in the composite microhardness differing significantly from the control. As for CP +natrosol this change in the microhardness was not observed. The treatment with CP + carbopol increased the roughness and decreased the gloss of the aged resins, whereas natrosol reduced only the gloss which differed statistically from the control. Experiment 2 : evaluate the influence of bleaching treatments with different concentrations and coffeestaining, in the physical properties of nanocomposite, submitted or not to AAA. Two representative samples of each group were evaluated in scanning electron microscopy (SEM). One hundred twenty cylindrical samples were prepared similar to the previous study and divided into 12 groups (n = 10). Half of specimens were artificially aged. For the bleaching/pigment treatment, groups with and without AAA, were divided into the following groups: 10 % carbamide peroxide (10 % CP), 35 % hydrogen peroxide (35 % PH) without bleaching treatment, with and without pigmentation of coffee. Data were submitted to three-way ANOVA and Tukey’s test for multiple comparisons. The multiple comparisons for were performed by using Tukey’s and Dunnett’s tests (&# 945;= 0, 05). Theresins without aging, the bleaching agents promoted {{a reduction in the}} compositemicrohardness, however, in the roughness, gloss and color this changes were not observed. After aging, the pigmentation also reduced the microhardness of the resins with and without aging and altered the color of the aged resins (&# 916;E> 25). 10 % PC increased roughness and decreased gloss compared to 35 % PH. Pigmentation also reduced the microhardness of the resins with and without aging and change the color of the aging resins (&# 916;E> 25). The actionof bleaching agents reduced the microhardness of the nanocomposite, and this alteration was influenced by the composition of the bleaching gel. The AAA promoted significant changes in the evaluated physical properties and favored the further deterioration of the resin surface by the bleaching, contributing to a greater extrinsic staining...|$|E
