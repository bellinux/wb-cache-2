25|$|Charles Leavitt, a {{resident}} of Hartsdale, New York, was a longtime member of the American Society of Civil Engineers, the American Society of Landscape Architects, and the Architectural League of New York. Like many architects, especially in the era in which Leavitt practiced, he often bounced between his professional responsibilities and the social contacts which furnished him {{a steady stream of}} well-heeled clients. During his early years in business particularly, Leavitt was heavily reliant on his principal <b>engineering</b> <b>assistant</b> Robert W. Sayles, who died in 1913.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{graduation}} Glanville entered {{employment as}} an <b>engineering</b> <b>assistant</b> at the Building Research Station (which {{would become the}} Building Research Establishment) in East Acton. Glanville was only the third person employed by the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research to undertake research work at the underfunded station which was established in April 1921. Glanville's first investigation at the Building Research Station (BRS) was to study how the water permeability of concrete varied and, with Duff Abrams, {{was one of the}} first to attribute this primarily to the water-cement ratio and not to the type and proportions of aggregate used. He also found that concrete became much more impermeable when cured by immersion in water, compared with the more popular air curing method. In 1925 the BRS moved to Garston near Watford.|$|E
