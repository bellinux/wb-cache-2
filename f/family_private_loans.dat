Understanding who gets <b>private</b> <b>loans</b> and their reasons for borrowing these loans is critical for policymaking, but little research has been done. This report explores the <b>private</b> <b>loan</b> market, the practices of financial aid offices, and the perceptions of students and parents about <b>private</b> <b>loans.</b> The report explores these issues from various perspectives, drawing on nationally representative data from a variety of sources, including the National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS), the Survey of Undergraduate Financial Aid Policies, Practices, and Procedures, data from the College Board and the "Greentree Gazette, " and a survey of administrators. Different sources of research data led to the same inescapable conclusion: the use of <b>private</b> <b>loans</b> is a growing part of college financing.

40|$|The cost of {{attending}} college has surpassed federal financial aid limits and fewer parents {{are paying the}} balance. As private lenders have been targeting undergraduate students to obtain <b>private</b> (alternative) <b>loans</b> to fill the financial gap, many students do not have parents or other adults to help them navigate {{one of the largest}} financial investments they will ever make. ^ Financial aid counselors, more than anyone else on campus, {{are in a position to}} discuss quality consumer loan information with students and families. Federal financial aid requirements for counseling undergraduate students on federal student loans do not pertain to <b>private</b> student <b>loans.</b> This qualitative study examined the role of college financial aid counselors regarding <b>private</b> <b>loan</b> counseling for undergraduate students. ^ Participants in the study were 20 financial aid counselors at 4 -year public and 4 -year private, not-for-profit, colleges and universities located in 12 Middle West region states. The participant counselors were interviewed about their past and present <b>private</b> <b>loan</b> counseling practices, the reasons more undergraduate students obtain <b>private</b> <b>loans,</b> the differences between <b>private</b> <b>loans</b> and federal student loans, their perceptions of counseling effectiveness and counseling limitations, and their recommendations for counseling students about <b>private</b> <b>loans.</b> ^ There were five major findings: (a) participant counselors believed that the 2007 Slate Act significantly limited their ability to counsel students on private loans; (b) many undergraduate students do not read or do not comprehend the written and online information counselors provide on private loans; (c) more parents are not willing or are unable to pay college costs; (d) counselors believed that one-on-one <b>private</b> <b>loan</b> counseling for students would be more effective than their current 2 ̆ 7 surface 2 ̆ 7 counseling practices; and (e) many students and parents do not fully grasp the differences between private and federal student loan options. ...|$|R

50|$|Advocates of <b>private</b> student <b>loans</b> {{suggest that}} they combine the best {{elements}} of the different government loans into one: they generally offer higher loan limits than federal student loans, ensuring the student is not left with a budget gap.

Most experts unconnected to the <b>private</b> <b>loan</b> industry recommend <b>private</b> student <b>loans</b> only as an expensive last resort, because of the higher interest rates, multiple fees, and lack of the borrower protections which are built into the federal loans.|$|R

However, lenders rarely give complete details of the terms of the <b>private</b> student <b>loan</b> until after the student submits an application, in part because this helps prevent comparisons based on cost. For example, many lenders only advertise the lowest interest rate they charge (for good credit borrowers).

While students have historically relied on federal loans and grants and family contributions to pay for college, a growing number have turned to <b>private</b> education <b>loans</b> to help them cover the cost. In 2007 - 08, <b>private</b> <b>loan</b> volume, including <b>private</b> sector and state sponsored loans, totaled $ 19 billion, up from $ 3 billion in 1997 - 98, according to the 2008 College Board report on student aid. Unlike federal <b>loans,</b> <b>private</b> education <b>loans</b> are not guaranteed by the federal government and are typically more costly for students than loans offered through federal programs. Despite their generally higher cost, about 26 percent of students who obtained <b>private</b> education <b>loans</b> in 2007 - 08 did not obtain Federal Stafford loans, and more than one-half of these students did not apply for Federal financial aid, according to the Institute for College Access and Success.
