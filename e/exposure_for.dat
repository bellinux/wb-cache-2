40|$|SUBJECT: COMPLETION OF METHYL PARATHION MITIGATION The Methyl Parathion Mitigation {{memorandum}} (Sanders 2012) {{from the}} Worker Health and Safety Branch (WHS), dated April 24, 2012, describes our findings {{in regards to}} the need for mitigation of methyl parathion exposures. The Methyl Parathion Risk Characterization Document addendum identified occupational exposures, application site <b>exposures</b> <b>for</b> bystanders, aggregate <b>exposures</b> <b>for</b> the general public, and aggregate <b>exposures</b> <b>for</b> workers that exceeded levels of concern (Koshlukova 2010).

From 1992 to 2011, (the most recent year data were available), the last methyl parathion-related illness or injury case occurred in 2009 (DPR 2014 a). In December 2012, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (U. S. EPA) cancelled all methyl parathion registrations. U. S.

Eidos marketing manager David Burton oversaw marketing efforts, which attempted {{to portray the}} character as attractive and pleasant. However, interaction with the press, especially those in Europe, resulted in less clothing depicted in promotional images. Concerned with diluting Croft's personality, Eidos avoided products it felt did not fit the character. Ian Livingstone, Eidos's product acquisition director, commented that the company declines most merchandising proposals. He stated that Eidos primarily focused on game development and viewed such promotion outside video games as <b>exposure</b> <b>for</b> the character.
