50|$|In high schools, <b>gender-based</b> <b>harassment</b> {{serves as}} a form of gender {{boundary}} policing. Girls are expected to conform to stereotypical gendered appearances, as are boys. Both male and female students regularly take part in policing gender boundaries through bullying. Male students frequently harass male and female students, while female students generally only harass other female students. The practice of male students bullying other male students is explicitly linked to machismo that boys are expected to subscribe to in order to be constructed and related to as 'normal' boys. Many girls report that boys tease and ridicule them {{on the basis of their}} appearance, which is linked to boys asserting masculine power through sexist practices of denigrating girls. This also serves to perpetuate the idea that appearance is a female's most important asset. The way in which girls harass other girls is through gossiping, instead of confronting the other girls directly. Unique appearances and attempts to stand out among girls are regarded very negatively. This type of female on female bullying sets the standard for appearance norms and the importance of appearance for females. Overall, <b>gender-based</b> <b>harassment</b> serves to define and enforce gender boundaries of high school students by high school students.|$|E

40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} {{data collection}} owner. Audio {{of interviews with}} public campaigning political figures {{who want to be}} named and want their views to be known publicly. The interviewees were expressing their public political views and experiences with regard to unarmed neighbourhood watch schemes in Somaliland to prevent terrorist attacks, the global movement to prevent <b>gender-based</b> street <b>harassment</b> and the global citizen casualty recording movement to record the casualties of armed conflict. Project description: The ‘Transforming Insecurity through Nonviolent Networks’ (Trinsec) project was funded by the ESRC Transformative Call from 1 June 2013 until 30 June 2015 (seven month no cost extension due to illness). The main aim of this research was to analyse whether and how a particular form of civil society - nonviolent grassroots networks (NGNs) - can transform insecurity. The case studies were unarmed neighbourhood watch schemes in Somaliland to prevent terrorist attacks, the global movement to prevent <b>gender-based</b> street <b>harassment</b> and the global citizen casualty recording movement to record the casualties of armed conflict. Particular attention was paid to potential for integrating across issues and through levels of governance beyond specific NGNs. The research combined listening methodology (an open ended giving of space to the expression of the lived experience of an issue) and academic-practitioner co-production of research and impact (i. e. working together at every stage of the process rather than academics doing the research then trying to persuade practitioners to apply its findings). To achieve its main aim, the research delivered on five primary objectives. First, it assessed, integrated and advanced key disciplinary and interdisciplinary theoretical, conceptual and empirical literatures relevant to the overall research question. One of the main findings is that the co-production literature which focuses on identifying a concrete opportunity at the outset misses the value of strong relationships combining with serendipity in generating opportunities. Second, it analysed and compared the role of NGNs: the research found that they have had substantial successes with widely varying structures. Third, it analysed efforts by NGNs at cross-issue and cross-level integration. The research found that this was attempted in all three cases but with limited success. Fourth, the research considered how the bottom-across practices of NGNs can be integrated into bottom-up and top-down practices of transforming insecurity in ways which enhance rather than detract from the positive aspects of NGNs. The main finding here was that it takes sustained strategic effort to make headway: leaving it to viral, distributed digital networks is insufficient. Fifth, and the key payoff sought, the research identified underlying principles and practical mechanisms through which insecurity might be transformed that had the potential for wider application. In essence this involves using listening and co-production methodologies to underpin a practical step-by-step of finding good people, then agreeing on an approach, then building strong relationships and only then thinking about needs, then projects and then funding. The research refined these ideas through the creation of a research and impact initiative called ‘Somali First (SF) : Promoting Somali-led Development’. SF is the culmination of Trinsec and its main follow-on activity. It integrates Somali government, business, civil society, academia and diaspora to demonstrate what a transformed Somali-led development process might look like. For example, partnering with Somali NGO the Observatory of Conflict and Violence Prevention, SF has secured $ 698, 000 from the international Somalia Stability Fund to train sixty Somali researchers and produce sixty Somali research publications over the next two years...|$|R
40|$|This report {{seeks to}} expand conversations around {{educational}} opportunity {{by taking a}} comprehensive look at the barriers African American girls face and the educational and economic outcomes that result.

Analysis illustrates the politics of (in) visibility that women gamers negotiate: limited possibilities for women as “active” subjects and little recognition of women’s desires in gaming motivations.

40|$|This {{study is}} a {{contribution}} to the debate about the adoption of gender parity policies in Latin America analyzing particular obstacles and challenges related to the implementation of this principle. Electoral systems tend to either optimize or reduce the impact of such gender parity measures. As well as with quotas, the size of the electoral district and the kind of electoral list system are the two variables that most influence the effective implementation of these measures. At the same time, the socio-cultural context also influences the process of implementation of gender parity measures. In patriarchal societies –with high levels of gender-based violence– electoral processes are often characterized by <b>gender-based</b> <b>harassment</b> and political violence, one of the greatest obstacles for increasing women’s political participation.

40|$|A recent focal article {{submitted}} by Cortina et al. (2017) to the Industrial and Organizational Psychology: Perspectives on Science and Practice journal discusses {{the need for}} workplace literature {{to move away from}} victim precipitation. Essentially, we as I-O Psychologists need to follow the path of researchers in areas such as criminology and stop placing blame on the victims for being recipients of certain behaviors. The problem with this sentiment is that if we do not measure others’ perceptions of victim behavior in our research we are effectively ignoring the realities of workplace culture, {{especially when it comes to}} sexual harassment and sexual assault. As is, our culture perpetuates the ideations of a “rape culture” in that <b>gender-based</b> and sexual <b>harassment</b> are often ignored or excused, and women are considered at fault for being victimized (e. g., “Did you see what she was wearing?”). Much of my research and applied work on this topic focuses on dispelling the rape myth ideology that exists on college campuses in three ways: debunking rape myths, teaching students how to be empowered bystanders, and challenging the presence of a rape culture. This session will focus on applying these principles to workplace culture to be welcoming for women of all backgrounds. By making this culture change we really can leave behind the premise of victim blaming.

40|$|Street {{harassment}}, {{or sexual}} harassment in public places, is widely experienced by women and queer individuals as they move through cities across the globe. As a form of <b>gender-based</b> violence, street <b>harassment</b> prevents those who experience it from full participation in their cities, gendering access to and mobility in public space. Street harassment has implications for equity across genders {{with regards to the}} right to the city. This thesis explores the challenges of combatting street harassment through an examination of the creation of Hollaback!, a blog turned social movement organization based in New York City. Hollaback! began addressing street harassment through the collection of personal stories, formation of a cyber community, and presentation of a model for response to harassment based on subverting the hostile male gaze through documentation and surveillance. Throughout, Hollaback! operated with the intent of translating their online innovations into an altered geography of access and safety for women and queer individuals in New York. I ask, what does Hollaback!’s choice of a web-based response to street harassment tell us about urban space and resistance in the internet age? Though problematically uncritical of the technology they employ, I find that Hollaback! has innovated novel ways to connect physically disparate actors and implement initiatives against street harassment on the ground in New York City. However, a substantial amount of work remains in researching the effectiveness of Hollaback!’s model for response...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to put forward informed C 4 D recommendations to help organizations like UNICEF combat the situation for Syrian refugee children and youths in Lebanon, who through displacement and resettling into the complex Lebanese socio-political landscape may be at risk of becoming a lost generation. This paper focuses on the prevention and elimination of actions such as bullying, sexual <b>harassment,</b> <b>gender-based</b> violence, and early marriage. Conceptual framework: the communication theoretical framework considers Bourdieu’s habitus model as well as the uses and gratification model. Concepts conducive to social cohesion include citizenship, communitas and cosmopolitanism. Methodology: data were gathered through a variety of primary and secondary sources. The former includes semi-structured interviews with subject matter experts and analysis of UNICEF’s external communication practices. The latter comprises the collection, assessment, comparison and summarizing of various reports about Lebanese media. Findings: Lebanon has a pluralistic media landscape, though it appears fragmented, reflecting its socio-political sectarian situation. The media in Lebanon is criticized for lack of public service. The arts scene seems to fill a void in terms of examining the collective memory in respect of not only the civil war (1975 - 1990) but also of social issues arising as a result of globalization and modernity. Syrians in Lebanon consume Lebanese media as much as media from their own country. Interpersonal communication channels appear to be the preferred mode of communication among both the host and the refugee communities, although among the youth social media platforms such as WhatsApp and Facebook are commonplace. Among the traditional media channels, television appears to be popular. The representation of Syrian refugees in Lebanese media is varied, with about one fourth of the published material portraying Syrians as a security issue.

40|$|This article {{examines}} the workplace discrimination and harassment experiences of professional quantity surveyors in South Africa and explores the relationship between harassment, discrimination and perceived workplace stress. An online survey is administered and 177 responses (12. 2 % of the target population) received. Descriptive and inferential statistics are used to analyse the response data. A minority of respondent quantity surveyors claim to experience workplace harassment and discrimination on gender and ethnic grounds. Respondents also indicate that they feel underpaid and that their ethnicity adversely affects their job security. The article reports on sexual harassment and <b>gender-based</b> <b>harassment</b> and discrimination.

40|$|As society {{continues}} {{to become more}} dependent on science and technology, the disparity {{between women and men}} in the sciences not only represents a waste of human capital but is also problematic in terms of principles of gender equity. Yet, despite more than three decades of equal opportunity legislation, women remain underrepresented in the public sphere, and this is particularly evident in the sciences. This article builds on earlier research and investigates some {{of the reasons for the}} continued gender imbalance in the sciences as more and more women eagerly enter the sciences, achieve academic success, and enroll as PhD students, but ultimately do not remain in their chosen scientific field. More specifically, we use "storying" as a way of presenting the doctoral experiences of several women who, despite the unambiguously <b>gender-based</b> <b>harassment</b> they experienced during the period of their candidature, have successfully completed their PhDs in the sciences in Australian universities. We particularly focus on the experiences of women who completed their PhDs in 2007 and 2008. Their story shows how, as a direct consequence of their experiences, these women left their chosen research areas because they felt that they had little or no choice. Given the extant literature (see, for example, Gutek, 1985; Linehan, 2000; Sappleton & Takruri-Rizk 2008; Wirth, 2001), we suggest that their stories are not idiosyncratic but are illustrative of more general and widespread societal positions and concerns. Thus we argue that if the problem of women's underrepresentation in the sciences is to be addressed, we need to look to the masculinist culture of organizations as an explanatory factor. We conclude that it is organizational culture that needs to change and suggest that while antidiscriminatory legislation is important, it is not adequate to address both overt and covert discrimination in the workplace...|$|E
40|$|In the mid- 2000 s, {{the spread}} of casual, social, and mobile games led researchers, journalists, and players to believe that video gaming was opening up to {{previously}} marginalized audiences, especially women. At the same time, game culture has seen {{a significant increase in}} incidents of sexism and misogyny. This dissertation uses a critical exploration of industry texts and practices, as well as interviews with thirty-seven female gamers, to explain how these conflicting narratives can co-exist and how women navigate their contradictions. The dissertation posits that industrial changes and the broadening of gaming audiences have motivated a Gramscian crisis of authority, where previously hegemonic male gamers fear losing their privileged position in this space. As a protective measure, they have reacted with both overtly and implicitly sexist forces, such as <b>gender-based</b> <b>harassment,</b> that marginalize non-male gamers, barring them from cultural power. This works to maintain what this project describes as a “core” of gaming culture that is exclusionary and misogynistic. At the same time, women and other marginalized audiences express deep pleasure in gaming and have developed nuanced strategies for managing their exclusion, pursuing positive gaming experiences, and competing with men on their own turf. In doing so, they put themselves in a complicated position, often simultaneously enjoying their identity as gamers while being told they should not possess that identity. By embodying their conflicting identities in diverse and negotiated ways, however, they work to break down the idea of “women” as an essentialized group and instead outline new ways of being female. This performs feminist action not only by diversifying ideas of who women can be, but also in demonstrating how they are already deeply connected to technologies like games despite their historic masculinization. Women are barred from gaming identity in many ways, but they are also still already part of its “core”. In addition, their management of conflicted identities illustrates pathways along which players could build networks of affinity across gendered lines, encouraging the development of a more equitable power structure in gaming, and perhaps in other masculinized and sexist spaces as well...|$|E
40|$|This review {{assessed}} {{accounts of}} abuse at the Australian Defence Force Academy, and recommends a Royal Commission. Summary The Defence Abuse Response Taskforce (Taskforce) was established on 26 november 2012 {{as part of}} the Government’s response to the review conducted by law firm DLA piper into allegations of sexual or other forms of abuse in Defence (DLA piper Review). Among approximately 2400 complaints of alleged abuse in Defence received by the Taskforce, as at 2 october 2014, 50 have been assessed as raising plausible allegations of abuse at the Australian Defence Force Academy (ADFA), a tri-service military training establishment of the Australian Defence Force (ADF), in Canberra, Australian Capital Territory (ACT). At ADFA, midshipmen from the navy and officer cadets from the Army and Air force (referred to in this report collectively as ‘cadets’) undertake military education and training in combination with a university education. These complaints relate to allegations of abuse spanning from 1986, the year ADFA was established, until 2011. The vast majority of complainants were cadets at ADFA at the time. Women are significantly over represented as ADFA complainants (64 per cent of ADFA complainants) compared to the proportion of women at ADFA at any time (for example, women represented approximately 21 per cent of the cadet population in 2014). Many cadets no doubt had positive and formative experiences at ADFA, and have gone on to pursue successful careers as officers in Defence. However, the information provided by complainants and other people who have contacted the Taskforce raises a significant number of very serious allegations of abuse occurring at ADFA {{over a long period of}} time. The complaints made to the Taskforce raise a significant number of allegations of sexual abuse, sexual harassment, physical abuse and harassment and bullying, where the alleged abusers were either cadets, ADFA staff members or other more senior ranking members of Defence (including medical staff or members of Defence at locations where cadets attended for training or other purposes). While some complainants reported being subjected to one incident of abuse, many claim to have been subjected to multiple types of abuse and/or to ongoing incidents of abuse throughout their time at ADFA. A significant number of complainants reported experiencing serious incidents of sexual or physical abuse that may have constituted criminal conduct. This report includes numerous first-hand accounts of abuse experienced by complainants at ADFA, both in short extracts quoted throughout and in longer case studies in Appendix A. As at 2 october 2014, the Taskforce has assessed 63 of the 76 complaints received relating to ADFA. fifty of these complaints have been assessed as falling within the scope of the Taskforce Terms of Reference and as raising one or more plausible allegations of abuse. In these cases, complainants are now being provided with access to Taskforce outcomes appropriate to their individual circumstances. These may include: counselling; a Reparation payment; referral for criminal investigation; a recommendation to Defence that administrative and/or disciplinary action be taken; and the opportunity to have their personal story of abuse heard, acknowledged and responded to by a senior Defence representative through the Defence Abuse Restorative engagement program. Analysis of the complaints made to the Taskforce about ADFA reveals disturbing features of abuse and mismanagement including: widespread harassment and bullying across the entire period of ADFA’s operation, particularly of female cadets, cadets in their first year, or cadets who were ill or injured, frequently perpetrated by more senior cadets; a disturbing incidence of sexual abuse by cadets, including some serious incidents where it appears that those responsible were not held to account; a significant amount of <b>gender-based</b> <b>harassment</b> and bullying and sexual harassment experienced by female cadets; and some serious physical assaults of cadets. Virtually all ADFA complaints assessed as raising one or more plausible allegations of abuse have also been assessed as including one or more plausible cases of Defence mismanagement. In many cases, complainants indicated that they reported abuse to ADFA staff members who did not respond appropriately. In many other cases, complainants indicated that they did not report abuse for a number of reasons including: a culture that did not support reporting of abuse; a perceived lack of effective reporting mechanisms; stigma and shame associated with having been abused; threats of further abuse or fear of reprisal; lack of confidence in staff members; or because staff members or more senior cadets in a position of authority were responsible for the abuse. The Taskforce has found that many such complaints raise plausible cases of Defence mismanagement, as particular patterns or practices of abuse existed during certain periods at ADFA such that the Taskforce is satisfied Defence knew or ought to have known about the abuse and yet failed to take appropriate action to prevent or stop the abuse occurring. In line with its Terms of Reference, the Taskforce has examined allegations of sexual abuse of women at ADFA in the 1990 s using all available sources of information, including numerous documents provided by Defence relating to that period and material from accounts provided by complainants to the Taskforce. The Taskforce has concluded that there was a disturbingly high incidence of sexual abuse of female cadets during that time period; that in some of these cases, reports of sexual abuse were seriously mismanaged by Defence; and that a number of individuals allegedly responsible for perpetrating sexual abuse are still serving in Defence. The Taskforce is continuing to accept complaints from women who experienced sexual abuse at ADFA during this period. Individuals who have come forward to the Taskforce have told of the lasting impacts of the abuse they experienced at ADFA, in many cases including ruined careers, severe emotional distress, impacts on relationships, physical impacts, psychological disorders, suicidal ideation and social isolation. In some cases they have never told anyone about the abuse prior to reporting it to the Taskforce, and the experience of re-living the trauma has been a difficult one. The Taskforce continues to offer support to complainants engaging with this difficult process. This report primarily focuses on complaints made to the Taskforce about abuse at ADFA. The report: 	provides background information regarding the work of the Taskforce and about ADFA; 	outlines the complaints that have been assessed as raising plausible allegations of abuse at ADFA; 	examines the Defence response to reports of abuse at ADFA; 	considers the incidence of sexual abuse of women at ADFA during the 1990 s; 	identifies some of the significant factors contributing to abuse at ADFA; 	outlines the impacts of abuse on complainants; 	summarises the outcomes provided to complainants by the Taskforce to date; and 	draws some overarching conclusions about the nature and extent of abuse at ADFA...|$|E
