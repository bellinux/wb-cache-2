40|$|The {{strength}} of thin shells, under external pressure, is highly dependent {{by the nature}} of imperfection. This paper investigates buckling behaviour of imperfect thin cylindrical shells with analytical, numerical, and experimental methods in conditions for which, at present, a complete theoretical analysis was not found in literature. In general, collapse is initiated by yielding, but interaction with geometrical instabilities is meaningful, in that imperfections reduce the load bearing capacity by an amount of engineering significance also when thickness is considerable. The aim {{of this study was to}} conduct experiments that are representative of buckling, in the context of NPP applications as, for instance, the IRIS (international reactor innovative and secure) and LWR steam generator (SG) tubes. At Pisa University, a research activity is being carried out on the buckling of thin walled metal specimen, with a test equipment (and the necessary <b>data</b> <b>acquisition</b> <b>facility)</b> as well as numerical models were set up by means FEM code. The experiments were conducted on A- 316 test specimens, tubes with and without longitudinal welding.

40|$|Purpose: This paper investigates {{buckling}} behaviour of imperfect thin {{cylindrical shell}} with analytical andexperimental assessment methods, {{in the context}} of NPP applications as, for instance, the IRIS LWR integratedSteam Generator (SG) tubes. Design/methodology/approach: In this paper, thin shell, homogeneous and isotropic material, also tubegeometric imperfections as eccentricity/ovality/welding are assumed to investigate the effects of latter on thelimit pressure load in conditions for which, at present, a complete theoretical analysis was not found in literature. At Pisa University a research activity is being carried out on the buckling of thin walled metal specimen, with atest equipment (and the necessary <b>data</b> <b>acquisition</b> <b>facility),</b> suitable for carrying out test series on this issue, aswell as numerical models implemented on the MARC FEM code, were set up. Findings: The experiments were conducted on test specimens of the same material (AISI 316) tube withand without longitudinal welding. The comparison between numerical and experimental results, for the samegeometry and loading conditions, shows a good agreement between the elastic-plastic finite-element predictionsand the experimental data.

40|$|The Spacecraft Propulsion Research Facility at the NASA Lewis Research Center's Plum Brook Station was {{reactivated}} {{in order}} to conduct flight simulation ground tests of the Delta 3 cryogenic upper stage. The tests were a cooperative effort between The Boeing Company, Pratt and Whitney, and NASA. They included demonstration of tanking and detanking of liquid hydrogen, liquid oxygen and helium pressurant gas as well as 12 engine firings simulating first, second, and third burns at altitude conditions. A key {{to the success of}} these tests was the performance of the primary facility systems and their interfaces with the vehicle. These systems included the structural support of the vehicle, propellant supplies, <b>data</b> <b>acquisition,</b> <b>facility</b> control systems, and the altitude exhaust system. While the facility connections to the vehicle umbilical panel simulated the performance of the launch pad systems, additional purge and electrical connections were also required which were unique to ground testing of the vehicle. The altitude exhaust system permitted an approximate simulation of the boost-phase pressure profile by rapidly pumping the test chamber from 13 psia to 0. 5 psia as well as maintaining altitude conditions during extended steady-state firings. The performance of the steam driven ejector exhaust system has been correlated with variations in cooling water temperature during these tests. This correlation and comparisons to limited data available from Centaur tests conducted in the facility from 1969 - 1971 provided insight into optimizing the operation of the exhaust system for future tests. Overall, the facility proved to be robust and flexible for vehicle space simulation engine firings and enabled all test objectives to be successfully completed within the planned schedule...|$|E
40|$|The load {{carrying}} behaviour of cylindrical thin-walled shell structures under pressure load is strongly {{dependent on the}} nature and magnitude of the imperfections invariably caused by various manufacturing processes. The present paper examines instabilities of long homogeneous and isotropic thin elastic tubes, characterized by geometric imperfections like eccentricity or ovality, on the buckling behaviour in conditions for which, at present, a complete theoretical analysis was not found in literature. Moreover, the additional aspect of the influence of the welded joint geometry and position is investigated over a wide range of diameter to thickness ratio, extending the findings of previous works. The problem of buckling for variable load conditions is relevant in the context of NPP applications as, for instance the optimisation of an integrated and innovative LWR Steam Generator (SG) tubes, according to the updated ASME rules. To the purpose, at Pisa University a rather intense research activity is being carried out on the buckling of thin walled metal specimens in the dimensional range suitable for the above mentioned application. Therefore a test equipment (with the necessary <b>data</b> <b>acquisition</b> <b>facility),</b> suitable for carrying out test series on this issue, as well as numerical models implemented on the MARC FEM code, were set up. The experiments were conducted on test specimens with different materials, e. g. A- 316 ASTM (with and without seam weld) and Inconel 690 TT, as well as different loading conditions (lateral and hydrostatic external pressure). A validation of numerical evaluations by comparison with test results is also performed. A good agreement has been observed between the experimental data and the elasto-plastic finite element analyses results, highlighting also the different influence of the mentioned imperfections on the buckling loads...|$|E

This approach minimizes {{the impact of the}} sudden increase in the worload on <b>data</b> <b>acquisition</b> <b>facilities</b> and streamlines the operation of a seismic network, especially during a complex earthquakes sequence.

The method is implemented in the Southern California Digital Seismic Network. The method can be implemented at every field station, which would make it possible to process the time series locally and continuously telemeter desired amplitude parameters with sufficient accuracy from a field station to multiple users through a relatively low data-rate communication line (e. g., regular telephone line or limited bandwidth satellite link) ...|$|R

The <b>data</b> <b>acquisition</b> and <b>data</b> reduction process has been combined within DDAS. DDAS receives input from hot wires and anemometers, amplifies and filters the signals with computer controlled modules, and converts the analog signals to digital with real-time simultaneous digitization followed by digital recording on disk or tape.

40|$|An {{accurate}} and convenient two-channel wavenumber calibration {{program has been}} developed for a Laser Photonics diode laser system. The method is based solely on comparison of sample and reference spectra, as recorded and stored by the standard sweep control and <b>data</b> <b>acquisition</b> <b>facilities</b> supplied with the system. The calibration program reads the sample and reference data files in Laser Photonics format, extracts the spectral data, and converts them into standard IEEE data format. A simple procedure is implemented for peak finding, with the sample peak wavenumbers calculated from a calibration curve determined by least-squares fitting to the reference wavenumbers. Provided the reference spectrum has a suitable distribution of peaks, a calibration precision of +/- 0. 0002 cm- 1 or better is obtained for nitrogen-cooled diodes over the full width of the diode laser scan, and from +/- 0. 0005 to +/- 0. 001 cm- 1 for closed-cycle helium cooling, of the same order as the original standard reference data. Given the rapid ongoing improvement in availability of good reference spectra for all regions, this program offers a simple, reliable, and automatic procedure for accurate measurement of diode laser data.

Central displacement mea-surements were recorded using a high temperature linear variable differential transformer (LVDT), while forming into a hemispherical mould. Using this facility the pressure versus displacement relationships were established for Upilex-R, Upilex-S, and Kapton-H and superplastic aluminium (Supral) diaphragms. Both Upilex-S and Kapton-H {{were found to}} have similar stiffness values, about eight times greater than Upilex-R, while the Supral is about sixteen times stiffer than Upilex-R. Pressure versus displacement characteristics are reported for (0 &deg;) 8, (0 &deg;) 16, (0 &deg;/ 90 &deg;) 2 s,(0 &deg;/ 90 &deg;) 4 sand (0 &deg;/+ 45 &deg;/- 45 &deg;/ 90 &deg;) carbon fibre reinforced PEEK (APC- 2) layups, which show that the laminate stiffness at forming tem-perature is very low relative to the diaphragm stiffness of Upilex-S, Kapton or Supral. The effect of diaphragm stiffness on squeeze flow is clearly demonstrated as the stiffer di-aphragms, Upilex-S and Supral, require higher pressures to complete the forming and consequently cause increased squeeze flow over that shown when using Upilex-R. How-ever, it has also been demonstrated that the use of these stiffer diaphragms reduces the risk of laminate buckling.

40|$|Scientific {{research}} is now often conducted on large and expensive experiments that utilize collaborative efforts {{on a national}} or international scale to explore physics and engineering issues. This is particularly true for the current US magnetic fusion energy program where collaboration on existing facilities has increased in importance and will {{form the basis for}} future efforts. As fusion energy research approaches reactor conditions, the trend is towards fewer large and expensive experimental facilities, leaving many major institutions without local experiments. Since the expertise of various groups is a valuable resource, it is important to integrate these teams into an overall scientific program. To sustain continued involvement in experiments, scientists are now often required to travel frequently, or to move their families, to the new large facilities. This problem is common to many other different fields of scientific research. The next-generation tokamaks, such as the Tokamak Physics Experiment (TPX) or the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER), will operate in steady-state or long pulse mode and produce fluxes of fusion reaction products sufficient to activate the surrounding structures. As a direct consequence, remote operation requiring robotics and video monitoring will become necessary, with only brief and limited access to the vessel area allowed.

40|$|In this {{dissertation}} {{we provide}} an extensive {{survey of the}} techniques for repairing and querying inconsistent relational databases. We distinguish four parameters for classifying and comparing of the existing techniques. First, we discern two repairing paradigms, namely the tuple-based and the attribute-based repairing paradigm. According to the former paradigm a re- pair for a database is obtained by inserting and=or deleting tuples, whereas according to the latter a repair is obtained by (also) modifying attribute values within tuples. Second, we distinguish several repair semantics which entail di®erent orders among the set of consistent database instances that can be obtained for an inconsistent database {{with respect to a}} given set of integrity constraints. Third, we classify the techniques {{on the basis of the}} classes of queries considered for computing consistent answers. Finally, we compare the di®erent approaches in literature on basis of the classes of integrity constraints which are assumed to be de¯ned on the database. 2) We investigate the problem of repairing and extracting reliable information from data violating a given set of aggregate constraints. These constraints consist of linear inequalities on aggregate-sum queries issued on measure values stored in the database. This syntactic form enables meaningful con- straints to be expressed. Indeed, aggregate constraints frequently occur in many real-life scenarios where guaranteeing the consistency of numerical data is mandatory. We consider database repairs consisting of sets of value-update opera- tions aiming at re-constructing the correct measure values of inconsistent data. We adopt two di®erent criteria for determining whether a set of update operations repairing data can be considered " or not: set-minimal semantics and card-minimal semantics. Both these semantics aim at preserving the information represented in the source data as much as possible. They correspond to di®erent repairing strategies which turn out to be well-suited for di®erent application scenarios. We provide the complexity characterization of three fundamental prob- lems: (i) repairability: is there at least one (possible not minimal) repair for the given database with respect to the speci¯ed constraints? (ii) repair checking: given a set of update operations, is it a minimal repair? (iii) consistent query answer: is a given query true in every minimal repair? 3) We provide a method for computing card-minimal repairs for a database in presence of steady aggregate constraints, a restricted but expressive class of aggregate constraints. Under steady aggregate constraints, an instance of the problem of computing a card-minimal repair can be transformed into an instance of a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) problem. Thus, standard techniques and optimizations addressing MILP problems can be re-used for computing a repairs. On the basis of this data-repairing framework, we propose an architecture providing robust <b>data</b> <b>acquisition</b> <b>facilities</b> from input documents contain- ing tabular data. We exploit integrity constraints de¯ned on the input data to support the detection and the repair of inconsistencies in the data arising from errors occurring in the acquisition phase performed on input data.

40|$|In {{this report}} we {{describe}} the new two-phase flow facility that has been constructed at Brown University. Included is the design philosophy that led us to select a blow-down, Freon tunnel as the means of studying the flow of a pure substance undergoing liquid-vapor phase changes. Each component is discussed from the initial design considerations, through sizing calculations, to actual system specifications. Special {{emphasis is placed on}} the instrumentation and automatic <b>data</b> <b>acquisition</b> and processing system. Finally a sampling of results obtained so far is presented. Section 1 gives the reasons for the construction of the facility and lists some of the uses and objectives of its operation. The reader can gain a good overview of the facility from Section 2 without a great deal of detail. In Section 3 we present the rationale for the particular design choices that were made and give details about the selection and sizing of all major components except the instrumentation. The latter subject is treated in Section 4 where we discuss the temperature and pressure probes, mass flow rate measurement, and other instrumentation. Section 5 is devoted to the test section proper where all the two-phase flow measurements and observations take place. The electronic <b>data</b> <b>acquisition</b> and <b>facility</b> control system is the subject of Section 6. Results on two-phase friction factors and flow pattern observations in a horizontal pipe are given in Section 7 along with the ranges of flow that have been covered so far. In capsule summary, the two-phase flow test facility is operational and has demonstrated a wide range of flow conditions from purely liquid to purely vapor through a variety of two-phase situations. Only horizontal flows have been studied so far, but the test section has been designed to operate in inclined positions up to fully vertical. The instrumentation performs very well as does the fully automatic control system. We believe the test facility is capable of yielding highly reliable and accurate data on two-phase flows which will be of great value in practice and in validating the various theories that have been put forth to describe this phenomenon...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{describes}} {{development of}} the first Thailand Remote Sensing Satellite System (TRSSS- 1) by the National Research Council of Thailand (NRCT), Ministry of Science Technology and Environment (MOSTE). The TRSSS- 1 project has primarily been developed as {{a major component of}} the Space Base Information System (SBIS) for effective decision support system for Thailand 2 ̆ 7 s natural resources and environmental management. The Space Based Information System consists of three components namely, the up-stream component, the interfacing component and the downstream component. The up-stream component consists of the Space Segment and the Ground Segment [consisting of the Mission Control Center (MCC) and the <b>Data</b> <b>Acquisition</b> and Processing <b>Facility</b> (DAPF) ] and the Launch Segment. The interfacing component consists of telecommunication and associated Hypertext based user interface communication and software. The down-stream component consists of space based industries, human resources development, technology transfer and development and applications of space based information network for effective decision support system for natural resources and environmental management for Thailand and her neighboring countries in ASEAN and Asia region and globally. The spacecraft bus and instruments are described. The optical instruments including electronics are also presented. The TRSSS- 1 program has already been approved by the previous Royal Thai Government in 1996 and the required budget provided. The development period takes about 36 months with the target launch date towards midyear of the year 2000...|$|R
40|$|The first METEOSAT Second Generation {{satellite}} {{will come}} into service in 2001. It will acquire image data in 12 spectral channels with a total data volume of 265 Mbytes every 15 minutes. These data are received, processed, and distributed by the EUMETSAT Ground Segment in real-time. The Ground Segment architecture is composed of blocks of grouped functionality called facilities. The Image Processing Facility (IMPF) provides the functionality for radiometric and geometrical corrections of the SEVIRI raw data from the MSG satellite. It receives three independent data streams from the Primary Ground Station (PGS) : SEVIRI raw data (Level 1. 0), telemetry data, and GERB raw data. This paper describes {{the architecture of the}} Image Processing Facility and presents an overview of the main processing steps necessary to transform Level 1. 0 into Level 1. 5 data. The latter is a rectified multi-channel MSG image in the standard geo-stationary projection, which is then distributed to other facilities: the Unified Meteorological Archiving and Retrieval Facility (UMARF) for archiving, the Meteorological Product Extraction Facility (MPEF) as the basis of meteorological product generation, and the <b>Data</b> <b>Acquisition</b> and Dissemination <b>Facility</b> (DADF) for distribution to world wider users. In addition to the Level 1. 0 to Level 1. 5 transformation, the paper describes several support functions that are {{an essential part of the}} IMPF, e. g. radiometric and geometric quality assessment. ...|$|R
