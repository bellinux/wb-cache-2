40|$|Introduction: Due to {{ever-increasing}} {{need for}} diagnostic radiographs in dentistry, {{it is necessary}} to observe techniques to minimize the absorbed patient dose. The aim of this study was the comparative evaluation of inherent visual characteristics such as contrast and density and the <b>gross</b> <b>fog</b> of standard occlusal films with those of occlusal films taken with intensifying screens. Materials and Methods: In this experimental research, standard occlusal films and occlusal films prepared by cutting extraoral films to the size of occlusal films and placing them between intensifying screens were used. After determination of the most appropriate exposure time and maximum kVp and mA, radiographs were taken from one step wedge and processed using the same condition. A total of 25 radiographs were taken from each of the two film types and then the radiographs underwent densitometry at similar points. In order to evaluate the <b>gross</b> <b>fog,</b> densitometry was carried out at 5 similar points on one unexposed film from each type. Data were analyzed using SPSS 11. 5 software and Mann-Whitney test (Î± = 0. 05). Results: Based on the results of this study, the density of the standard occlusal film was more than that of the occlusal film with intensifying screens (p value < 0. 001). The contrast of the film with intensifying screens was more than that of the standard occlusal film (p value < 0. 001). The <b>gross</b> <b>fog</b> of the film with intensifying screens was less than that of the standard occlusal film (p value = 0. 006). Conclusion: Occlusal films with intensifying screens have higher contrast and lower <b>gross</b> <b>fog</b> and density, but in the diagnostic range, in comparison with standard occlusal films; therefore, films with intensifying screens are recommended because they decrease patient absorbed dose by decreasing exposure time.

40|$|Fog drop size {{distributions}} {{were collected}} from aircraft {{as part of the}} Synthetic Vision Technology Demonstration Program. Three west coast marine advection fogs, one frontal fog, and a radiation fog were sampled {{from the top of the}} cloud to the bottom as the aircraft descended on a 3 -degree glideslope. Drop size versus altitude versus concentration are shown in three dimensional plots for each 10 -meter altitude interval from 1 -minute samples. Also shown are median volume radius and liquid water content. Advection fogs contained the largest drops with median volume radius of 5 - 8 micrometers, although the drop sizes in the radiation fog were also large just above the runway surface. Liquid water content increased with height, and the total number of drops generally increased with time. Multimodal variations in number density and particle size were noted in most samples where there was a peak concentration of small drops (2 - 5 micrometers) at low altitudes, midaltitude peak of drops 5 - 11 micrometers, and high-altitude peak of the larger drops (11 - 15 micrometers and above). These observations are compared with others and corroborate previous results in <b>fog</b> <b>gross</b> properties, although there is considerable variation with time and altitude even in the same type of fog...|$|R
