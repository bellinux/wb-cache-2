5|$|Acid2 {{was first}} {{proposed}} by Håkon Wium Lie, {{chief technical officer}} of Opera Software and creator of the widely used Cascading Style Sheets web standard. In a 16 March 2005 article on CNET, Lie expressed dismay that Microsoft Internet Explorer did not properly support web standards and hence was not completely <b>interoperable</b> with other browsers. He announced that Acid2 would be a challenge to Microsoft to design Internet Explorer 7, then in development, to achieve {{a greater degree of}} standards compliance than previous versions of Internet Explorer. The original Acid1 test had forced browser makers to fix their applications or face embarrassment; Lie hoped that Acid2 would do the same.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, Cisco Systems and Apple {{negotiated}} over allowing Apple {{rights to}} use Cisco's Linksys iPhone trademark, but the negotiations stalled when Cisco {{pushed for the}} two products to be <b>interoperable.</b> Following the public unveiling of the Apple iPhone at the 2007 Macworld Expo, Cisco {{filed a lawsuit against}} Apple in January 2007, alleging Apple's iPhone name infringed on Cisco's iPhone trademark. Cisco alleged that Apple created a front company subsequent to their negotiations to try to acquire the rights another way, while Apple countered {{that there would be no}} likelihood of confusion between the two products, because Apple's iPhone product was the first cell phone with such a name, while Cisco's iPhone was a VoIP phone. Bloomberg reported Cisco's iPhone as a product marketed for less than $100 and part of the Linksys home routers, enabling internet-based calls through Skype and Yahoo! Messenger, and contrasted it with Apple's iPhone as a mobile phone which sold for around $600. In February 2007, Cisco and Apple announced an agreement under which both companies would be allowed to use the iPhone name worldwide.|$|E
25|$|Although {{increased}} flexibility {{could be}} obtained by keeping the system <b>interoperable</b> with the South African railway system, a strong case exists for keeping Gautrain separate from the existing network. According to the Gautrain planning and implementation study, an <b>interoperable</b> network may impact service delivery, increase the operating cost and tarnish Gautrain's image. Gautrain's rolling stock will be used only on the new tracks. An <b>interoperable</b> network might also increase safety requirements, as existing steam and diesel trains {{would be able to}} access the new network.|$|E

25|$|As O gauge regained {{popularity}} in the 1990s it also started to regain manufacturers, and as of late 2003, no fewer than six companies market O gauge locomotives and/or cars, all theoretically <b>interoperable</b> with one another.|$|E
25|$|The R179 {{cars are}} {{equipped}} with updated control systems, HVAC and public address systems. They are visually {{very similar to the}} R160s, but the two car types are not <b>interoperable</b> with each other due to electrical incompatibilities between them.|$|E
25|$|Kaspersky {{has also}} {{received}} certification {{of their products}} through the OESIS OK Certification Program, which verifies that the applications are <b>interoperable</b> with third-party technology solutions like NAC and SSL VPN products from Cisco Systems, Juniper Networks, F5 Networks, and others.|$|E
25|$|Portable, robust {{communications}} {{are needed}} for military ground operations. There will also be needs for air to ground and air-to-air communications. When operating with multinational coalitions, or with foreign nation intelligence systems, the appropriate HN personnel will need communications <b>interoperable</b> with those systems.|$|E
25|$|After Marx {{went out}} of {{business}} in 1978, K-Line bought much of Marx's tooling and entered the marketplace. K-Line's early offerings changed little from the old Marx designs, other than a new brand name and a Lionel-compatible coupler, making K-Line's offerings completely <b>interoperable</b> with Lionel.|$|E
25|$|AVST’s unified {{communications}} (UC) solutions service five primary market segments: enterprise, government, healthcare, education, and hospitality. The company’s primary product, CX-E, {{is a highly}} <b>interoperable</b> communications software platform that integrates with all other major vendor’s solutions and supports various voice, mobility, business process and collaboration solutions.|$|E
25|$|Mario Artist is a {{suite of}} four <b>interoperable</b> Nintendo 64 {{software}} titles, developed as flagship software for the 64DD peripheral's unique multimedia and Internet capabilities. A bundle of the 64DD unit, software plus hardware accessories, and an Internet service subscription package was released in Japan starting in December 1999.|$|E
25|$|Microsoft {{announced}} that it will demand 0.4% of the revenue (rather than 5.95%) in patent-licensing royalties, only from commercial vendors of <b>interoperable</b> software and promised not to seek patent royalties from individual open source developers. The interoperability information alone is available for a one-time fee of €10,000 (US$15,992).|$|E
25|$|The R160s {{are very}} similar to the R143s; however, the two car types can not be interchanged with each other. The R160s are also {{visually}} very similar to the R179s, but the two car types are not <b>interoperable</b> with each other due to electrical incompatibilities between the two car types.|$|E
25|$|Current {{research}} {{includes a}} {{collaboration with the}} University of Michigan to see computers act as an academic adviser for undergraduate computer science and engineering students at the university, and a partnership with AT, combining their cloud and Internet of Things (IoT) platforms to make them <b>interoperable</b> and to provide developers with easier tools.|$|E
25|$|CobraNet {{was first}} {{introduced}} as an <b>interoperable</b> standard in collaboration with manufacturer QSC Audio Products. QSC {{was the first to}} license the technology from Peak Audio and marketed it under the RAVE brand. At this point CobraNet had graduated to fast Ethernet and used a unique collision avoidance technique to carry up to 64 channels per Ethernet collision domain.|$|E
25|$|A DOI name also {{differs from}} {{standard}} identifier registries {{such as the}} ISBN, ISRC, etc. The purpose of an identifier registry is to manage a given collection of identifiers, whereas {{the primary purpose of}} the DOI system is to make a collection of identifiers actionable and <b>interoperable,</b> where that collection can include identifiers from many other controlled collections.|$|E
25|$|The Open Mobile Alliance {{created a}} {{standard}} for <b>interoperable</b> DRM on mobile devices. The first version of OMA DRM consisted of a simple rights management language and was widely used to protect mobile phone ringtones from being copied from the phone to other devices. Later versions expanded the rights management language to similar expressiveness as Fairplay, but did not become widely used.|$|E
25|$|EastLink is {{electronically}} tolled with no cash booths, using {{a system}} developed by SICE. The SICE Tolling System {{is similar to}} (and <b>interoperable</b> with) the e-TAG system used on the CityLink tollway. EastLink was opened to traffic on Sunday 29 June 2008 and {{in conjunction with the}} opening, a month-long toll-free period occurred before regular tolling commenced on 27 July 2008.|$|E
25|$|CobraNet was {{developed}} in 1996 by Boulder, Colorado-based Peak Audio. Initial demonstrations were of a 10 Mbit/s point-to-point system with limited channel capacity. The first permanent installation of CobraNet in this early form was to provide background music throughout Disney's Animal Kingdom theme park. The first commercial use of CobraNet as an <b>interoperable</b> standard was during the half-time show at Super Bowl XXXI in 1997.|$|E
25|$|In late 2010 and 2011, {{platform}} humps {{were installed}} on all Victoria line stations except Pimlico to provide step-free access to trains. This project was {{in accordance with}} the Rail Vehicle Accessibility (Non <b>Interoperable</b> Rail System) Regulations 2010 and the Disability Discrimination Act 1995. The Victoria line humps resemble in form the Harrington Hump, a ramp type being installed on some mainline stations, but are of a masonry construction.|$|E
25|$|Since 2008 Microsoft {{has also}} been using WMA Professional in its Protected <b>Interoperable</b> File Format (PIFF) based on the ISO Base Media File Format and most {{commonly}} used for Smooth Streaming, a form of adaptive bit rate streaming over HTTP. Related industry standards such as DECE UltraViolet and MPEG-DASH have not standardized WMA as a supported audio codec, deciding {{in favor of the}} more industry-prevalent MPEG and Dolby audio codecs.|$|E
25|$|WCF {{is capable}} of using SOAP for {{communication}} between two processes, thereby making WCF based applications <b>interoperable</b> with any other process that communicates via SOAP. When a WCF process communicates with a non-WCF process, XML based encoding {{is used for the}} SOAP messages but when it communicates with another WCF process, the SOAP messages are encoded in an optimized binary format, to optimize the communication. Both the encodings conform to the data structure of the SOAP format, called Infoset.|$|E
25|$|Scale is {{the ratio}} of a model {{dimension}} to the real life dimension. O Scale in the UK is commonly 1:43.5 or 7mm to the foot, in continental Europe it is commonly 1:45 though 1:43.5 is also used particularly in France, and in the USA 1:48. Each region tends to design models to its own scale. The NMRA and the MOROP maintain detailed standards {{for a variety of}} scales to help model makers create <b>interoperable</b> models.|$|E
25|$|At the 2000 Consumer Electronics Show (CES) trade show, {{the three}} {{companies}} announced {{the creation of}} the SD Association (SDA) to promote SD cards. The SD Association, headquartered in San Ramon, California, United States, started with about 30 companies and today consists of about 1,000 product manufacturers that make <b>interoperable</b> memory cards and devices. Early samples of the SD Card became available {{in the first quarter of}} 2000, with production quantities of 32 and 64MB cards available three months later.|$|E
25|$|The United States {{implementation}} is the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), {{while in}} Europe the treaty has been {{implemented by the}} 2001 European directive on copyright, which requires member states of the European Union to implement legal protections for technological prevention measures. , the lower house of the French parliament adopted such legislation {{as part of the}} controversial DADVSI law, but added that protected DRM techniques should be made <b>interoperable,</b> a move which caused widespread controversy in the United States. The Tribunal de grande instance de Paris concluded in 2006, that the complete blocking of any possibilities of making private copies was an impermissible behaviour under French copyright law.|$|E
25|$|IPv6 is not {{directly}} <b>interoperable</b> by design with IPv4. In essence, it establishes a parallel version of the Internet {{not directly}} accessible with IPv4 software. Thus, translation facilities must exist for internetworking or nodes must have duplicate networking software for both networks. Essentially all modern computer operating systems support both versions of the Internet Protocol. Network infrastructure, however, has been lagging in this development. Aside from the complex array of physical connections that make up its infrastructure, the Internet is facilitated by bi- or multi-lateral commercial contracts, e.g., peering agreements, and by technical specifications or protocols that describe the exchange of data over the network. Indeed, the Internet is defined by its interconnections and routing policies.|$|E
25|$|Microsoft {{attempted}} {{to address some}} of these shortcomings by introducing the Windows Script Host in 1998 with Windows 98, and its command-line based host: cscript.exe. It integrates with the Active Script engine and allows scripts to be written in compatible languages, such as JScript and VBScript, leveraging the APIs exposed by applications via COM. However, it has its own deficiencies: its documentation is not very accessible, and it quickly gained a reputation as a system vulnerability vector after several high-profile computer viruses exploited weaknesses in its security provisions. Different versions of Windows provided various special-purpose command line interpreters (such as netsh and WMIC) with their own command sets but they were not <b>interoperable.</b>|$|E
25|$|The LHC Computing Grid was {{constructed}} {{as part of}} the LHC design, to handle the massive amounts of data expected for its collisions. It is an international collaborative project that consists of a grid-based computer network infrastructure initially connecting 140 computing centres in 35 countries (over 170 in 36 countries as of 2012). It was designed by CERN to handle the significant volume of data produced by LHC experiments, incorporating both private fibre optic cable links and existing high-speed portions of the public Internet to enable data transfer from CERN to academic institutions around the world. The Open Science Grid is used as the primary infrastructure in the United States, and also as part of an <b>interoperable</b> federation with the LHC Computing Grid.|$|E
25|$|In the future, the Internet {{of things}} {{may be a}} {{non-deterministic}} and open network in which auto-organized or intelligent entities (Web services, SOA components), virtual objects (avatars) will be <b>interoperable</b> and able to act independently (pursuing their own objectives or shared ones) depending on the context, circumstances or environments. Autonomous behavior through the collection and reasoning of context information {{as well as the}} objects ability to detect changes in the environment, faults affecting sensors and introduce suitable mitigation measures constitute a major research trend, clearly needed to provide credibility to the IoT technology. Modern IoT products and solutions in the marketplace use a variety of different technologies to support such context-aware automation but more sophisticated forms of intelligence are requested to permit sensor units to be deployed in real environments.|$|E
25|$|In 2005, Getronics {{announced}} New VS (VSGX), {{a product}} designed to seamlessly run the VS operating system and all VS software on Intel 80x86 and IBM POWER machines under Linux or Unix, using a hardware abstraction layer. The product was a joint commercial effort of Getronics and TransVirtual Systems, developer of the Wang VS virtualization technology that makes the New VS possible. VS software can be run under New VS without program or data conversion. The New VS {{is a combination of}} very specifically configured mainstream PC or PowerPC server hardware running virtualization software. It is <b>interoperable</b> with SCSI-based Wang VS tape and disk drives, which provide a means of restoring VS files from standard backup tapes or copying VS disk drives. Wang networking and clustering are supported over TCP/IP.|$|E
25|$|Published in February 2014 by the OpenID Foundation, {{the third}} {{generation}} of OpenID technology, OpenID Connect, is an authentication layer that sits {{on top of the}} OAuth 2.0 authorization framework. It allows computing clients to verify the identity of an end-user based on the authentication performed by an authorization server, as well as to obtain the basic profile information about the end-user in an <b>interoperable</b> and REST-like manner. In technical terms, OpenID Connect specifies a RESTful HTTP API, using JSON as a data format. OpenID Connect allows a range of organizations, including web-based, mobile and JavaScript clients, to request and receive information about authenticated sessions and end-users. The OpenID Connect specification is extensible, supporting optional features such as encryption of identity data, discovery of OpenID providers, and session management.|$|E
25|$|The various {{services}} are currently not <b>interoperable,</b> though those {{that use the}} same DRM system (for instance the several Windows Media DRM format stores, including Napster, Kazaa and Yahoo Music) all provide songs that can be played side-by-side through the same player program. Almost all stores require client software of some sort to be downloaded, and some also need plug-ins. Several colleges and universities, such as Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, have made arrangements with assorted Internet music suppliers to provide access (typically DRM-restricted) to music files for their students, to less than universal popularity, sometimes making payments from student activity fee funds. One {{of the problems is}} that the music becomes unplayable after leaving school unless the student continues to pay individually. Another is that few of these vendors are compatible with the most common portable music player, the Apple iPod. The Gowers Review of Intellectual Property (to HMG in the UK; 141 pages, 40+ specific recommendations) has taken note of the incompatibilities, and suggests (Recommendations 8—12) that there be explicit fair dealing exceptions to copyright allowing libraries to copy and format-shift between DRM schemes, and further allowing end users to do the same privately. If adopted, some acrimony may decrease.|$|E

500|$|In {{support of}} the appeal, the Computer & Communications Industry Association {{submitted}} an amicus curiae brief claiming that the district court had made errors in concluding that Accolade had infringed upon Sega's copyright by reverse engineering its software, extending copyright protection to method of operation, and failing to consider whether Accolade's games were substantially similar to Sega's copyrighted material. [...] Amicus briefs were also submitted by the American Committee for <b>Interoperable</b> Systems, the Computer and Business Equipment Manufacturers Association, and copyright law professor Dennis S. Karjala from Arizona State University.|$|E
500|$|The {{new set of}} {{extensions}} {{proposed by}} the RPA, dubbed [...] "MetroLink", would make use of existing commuter rail infrastructure, {{so as to make}} it <b>interoperable</b> with the New York City Subway. Nine hundred and fifty [...] "Rx" [...] hybrid railcars would be ordered, with yard expansions and new yards being built. MetroLink, consisting of 31 new metro stations (not counting three recycled commuter rail stations) and 19 new route‑miles of track (...) (not including existing commuter rail and then-under construction AirTrain JFK route miles) would have reduced the load on the IRT Lexington Avenue Line, the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line, and the IND Queens Boulevard Line. Two of these stations would be in Brooklyn, three in Queens, nine in the Bronx, and twenty in Manhattan. Five services would be run: ...|$|E
