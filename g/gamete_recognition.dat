40|$|Abstract Background Reproductive {{character}} displacement (RCD) is {{a common}} and taxonomically widespread pattern. In marine broadcast spawning organisms, behavioral and mechanical isolation are absent and prezygotic barriers between species often operate only during the fertilization process. Such barriers are usually a consequence of differences {{in the way in}} which sperm and egg proteins interact, so RCD can be manifest as faster evolution of these proteins between species in sympatry than allopatry. Rapid evolution of these proteins often appears to be a consequence of positive (directional) selection. Here, we identify a set of candidate <b>gamete</b> <b>recognition</b> proteins (GRPs) in the ascidian Ciona intestinalis and showed that these GRPs evolve more rapidly than control proteins (those not involved in <b>gamete</b> <b>recognition).</b> Choosing a subset of these <b>gamete</b> <b>recognition</b> proteins that show evidence of positive selection (CIPRO 37. 40. 1, CIPRO 60. 5. 1, CIPRO 100. 7. 1), we then directly test the RCD hypothesis by comparing divergence (omega) and polymorphism (McDonald-Kreitman, Tajima's D, Fu and Li's D and F, Fay and Wu's H) statistics in sympatric and allopatric populations of two distinct forms of C. intestinalis (Types A and B) between which there are strong post-zygotic barriers. Results Candidate <b>gamete</b> <b>recognition</b> proteins from two lineages of C. intestinalis (Type A and B) are evolving more rapidly than control proteins, consistent with patterns seen in insects and mammals. However, ω (d N /d S) is not significantly different between the sympatric and allopatric populations, and none of the polymorphism statistics show significant differences between sympatric and allopatric populations. Conclusions Enhanced prezygotic isolation in sympatry has become a well-known feature of <b>gamete</b> <b>recognition</b> proteins in marine broadcast spawners. But in most cases the evolutionary process or processes responsible for this pattern have not been identified. Although <b>gamete</b> <b>recognition</b> proteins in C. intestinalis do appear to evolve more rapidly, on average, than proteins with other functions, rates of evolution are not different in allopatric and sympatric populations of the two reproductively isolated forms. That sympatry is probably human-mediated, and therefore recent, may explain the absence of RCD. </p...|$|E

Extensive {{research has focused on}} the pollen tube, namely, its interaction with the stigma and reception by maternal cells. Little is known, however, about the mechanism by which the gametes recognize each other and interact to form a zygote. We report that an ankyrin repeat protein (ANK 6) is essential for fertilization, specifically for <b>gamete</b> <b>recognition.</b> ANK 6 (At 5 g 61230) was highly expressed in the male and female gametophytes before and during but not after fertilization.

Moreover, male-female <b>gamete</b> <b>recognition</b> was found to be impaired only when an ank 6 male gamete reached an ank 6 female gamete, thereby preventing formation of homozygous zygotes. ANK 6 was localized to the mitochondria, where it interacted with SIG 5, a transcription initiation factor previously found to be essential for fertility.

40|$|Protein-carbohydrate {{interaction}} regulates multiple important processes during fertilization, {{an essential}} biological event where individual <b>gametes</b> undergo intercellular <b>recognition</b> to fuse and generate a zygote. In the mammalian female reproductive tract, sperm temporarily {{adhere to the}} oviductal epithelium via the complementary interaction between carbohydrate-binding proteins on the sperm membrane and carbohydrates on the oviductal cells. After detachment from the oviductal epithelium {{at the appropriate time}} point following ovulation, sperm migrate and occasionally bind to the extracellular matrix, called the zona pellucida (ZP), which surrounds the egg, thereafter undergoing the exocytotic acrosomal reaction to penetrate the envelope and to reach the egg plasma membrane. This sperm-ZP interaction also involves the direct interaction between sperm carbohydrate-binding proteins and carbohydrates within the ZP, most of which have been conserved across divergent species from mammals to amphibians and echinoderms. This review focuses on the carbohydrate-mediated interaction of sperm with the female reproductive tract, mainly the interaction between sperm and the ZP, and introduces the fertilization-suppressive action of dicalcin, a Xenopus laevis ZP protein-associated protein. The action of dicalcin correlates significantly with a dicalcin-dependent change in the lectin-staining pattern within the ZP, suggesting a unique role of dicalcin as an inherent protein that is capable of regulating the affinity between the lectin and oligosaccharides attached on its target glycoprotein...|$|R
40|$|An {{increasing}} number of molecular studies are indicating that, {{in a wide variety}} of species, genes directly related to fertilization evolve at extraordinarily high rates. We try to gain insight into the dynamics of this rapid evolution and its underlying mechanisms by means of a simple theoretical model. In the model, sexual selection and sympatric speciation act together in order to drive rapid divergence of <b>gamete</b> <b>recognition</b> proteins. In this process, intraspecific competition for fertilizations enlarges male gamete protein variation by means of evolutionary branching, which initiates sympatric speciation. In addition, avoidance of competition for fertilizations between the incipient species drives the rapid evolution of <b>gamete</b> <b>recognition</b> proteins. This mechanism can account for both strong stabilizing selection on <b>gamete</b> <b>recognition</b> proteins within species and rapid divergence between species. Moreover, it can explain the empirical finding that the rate of divergence of fertilization genes is not constant, but highest between closely related species...|$|E

Surface receptors involved in fertilization are targets of sexual selection, reinforcement, and other evolutionary forces including positive selection. This observation was made across different lineages of the eukaryotic tree from land plants to mammals, and is particularly evident in free-spawning animals. Here we use the brown algal model species Ectocarpus (Phaeophyceae) to investigate the evolution of candidate <b>gamete</b> <b>recognition</b> proteins in a distant major phylogenetic group of eukaryotes. ResultsMale gamete specific genes were identified by comparing transcriptome data covering different stages of the Ectocarpus life cycle and screened for characteristics expected from <b>gamete</b> <b>recognition</b> receptors. Selected genes were sequenced in a representative number of strains from distant geographical locations and varying stages of reproductive isolation, to search for signatures of adaptive evolution. One of the genes (Esi 0130 _ 0068) showed evidence of selective pressure. Interestingly, that gene displayed domain similarities to the receptor for egg jelly (REJ) protein involved in sperm-egg recognition in sea urchins.

40|$|SummaryFertilization {{requires}} recognition, attachment, and membrane fusion between gametes. In metazoans, rapidly evolving surface proteins {{contribute to}} <b>gamete</b> <b>recognition</b> and adhesion [1]. Flowering plants evolved a double fertilization process wherein two immotile sperm cells are delivered to female gametes by the pollen tube, guided by elaborate communications {{between male and}} female reproductive organs [2 – 7]. Once released, the sperm cells contact female gametes directly prior to gamete fusion. It remains unclear whether active <b>gamete</b> <b>recognition</b> and attachment mechanisms are required for double fertilization. Here, we provide functional characterization of Arabidopsis GAMETE EXPRESSED 2 (GEX 2), which encodes a sperm-expressed protein of unknown function [8]. GEX 2 is localized to the sperm membrane and contains extracellular immunoglobulin-like domains, similar to gamete interaction factors in algae and mammals [9, 10]. Using a new in vivo assay, we demonstrate that GEX 2 is required for gamete attachment, in the absence of which double fertilization is compromised. Ka/Ks analyses indicate relatively rapid evolution of GEX 2, like other proteins involved in male and female interactions [1, 3]. We conclude that surface proteins involved in gamete attachment and recognition exist in plants with immotile gametes, similar to algae and metazoans [11, 12]. This conservation broadens the repertoire of research for plant reproduction factors to mechanisms demonstrated in animals...|$|E

40|$|Ernst Mayr {{used the}} {{geography}} of closely related species {{in various stages of}} increasing divergence to “animate” the process of geographic, or allopatric, speciation. This approach was applied to a wide set of taxa, and a seminal paper by Mayr used it to explore speciation patterns in tropical sea urchins. Since then, taxonomic information in several of these genera has been augmented by detailed molecular phylogenies. We compare Mayr's animation with the phylogenies of eight sea urchin genera placed by Mayr into four speciation groups. True to Mayr's predictions, early-stage genera have on average lower species divergence and more polytypic species than genera in later stages. For six of these genera, we also have information about the evolution of the <b>gamete</b> <b>recognition</b> protein bindin, which is critical to reproductive isolation. These comparisons show that later-stage genera with many sympatric species tend to be those with rapid bindin evolution. By contrast, early-stage genera with few sympatric species are not necessarily earlier in the divergence process; they happen to be those with slow rates of bindin evolution. These results show that the rate of speciation in sea urchins does not only depend on the steady accumulation of genome divergence over time, but also on the rate of evolution of <b>gamete</b> <b>recognition</b> proteins. The animation method used by Mayr is generally supported by molecular phylogenies. However, the existence of multiple rates in the acquisition of reproductive isolation complicates placement of different genera in an evolutionary series...|$|E
40|$|Successful {{fertilization}} in free-spawning {{marine organisms}} {{depends on the}} interactions between genes expressed on the surfaces of eggs and sperm. Positive selection frequently characterizes the molecular evolution of such genes, raising {{the possibility that some}} common deterministic process drives the evolution of <b>gamete</b> <b>recognition</b> genes and may even be important for understanding the evolution of prezygotic isolation and speciation in the marine realm. One hypothesis is that <b>gamete</b> <b>recognition</b> genes are subject to selection for prezygotic isolation, namely reinforcement. In a previous study, positive selection on the gene coding for the acrosomal sperm protein M 7 lysin was demonstrated among allopatric populations of mussels in the Mytilus edulis species group (M. edulis, M. galloprovincialis, and M. trossulus). Here, we expand sampling to include M 7 lysin haplotypes from populations where mussel species are sympatric and hybridize to determine whether there is a pattern of reproductive character displacement, which would be consistent with reinforcement driving selection on this gene. We do not detect a strong pattern of reproductive character displacement; there are no unique haplotypes in sympatry nor is there consistently greater population structure in comparisons involving sympatric populations. One distinct group of haplotypes, however, is strongly affected by natural selection and this group of haplotypes is found within M. galloprovincialis populations throughout the Northern Hemisphere concurrent with haplotypes common to M. galloprovincialis and M. edulis. We suggest that balancing selection, perhaps resulting from sexual conflicts between sperm and eggs, maintains old allelic diversity within M. galloprovincialis...|$|E

40|$|Sexual {{reproduction}} is commonly assumed {{to occur in}} the vast majority of diatoms due to the intimate association of this process with cell size control. Surprisingly, however, little is known about the impact of sexual events on diatom population dynamics. The Sig 1 gene is strongly upregulated during sexual reproduction in the centric diatom Thalassiosira weissflogii and has been hypothesized to encode a protein involved in <b>gamete</b> <b>recognition.</b> In the present study, degenerate PCR primers were designed and used to amplify a portion of Sig 1 from three closely related species in the cosmopolitan genus Thalassiosira, Thalassiosira oceanica, Thalassiosira guillardii, and Thalassiosira pseudonana. Identification of Sig 1 in these three additional species facilitated development of this gene as a molecular marker for diatom sexual events. Examination of the new sequences indicated that multiple copies of Sig 1 are probably present in the genome. Moreover, compared to the housekeeping gene β-tubulin, the Sig 1 genes of isolates of T. weissflogii collected from different regions of the Atlantic and Pacific oceans displayed high levels of divergence. The Sig 1 genes of the four closely related Thalassiosira species also displayed high levels of sequence divergence compared to the levels observed with a second gene, Fcp, probably explaining why Sig 1 could not be amplified from more distantly related species. The high levels of sequence divergence both within and between species suggest that Sig 1 is rapidly evolving in a manner reminiscent of the manner observed in other genes that encode <b>gamete</b> <b>recognition</b> proteins. A simple model is presented for Sig 1 evolution and the implications of such a rapidly evolving sexual reproduction gene for diatom speciation and population dynamics...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 1998 I studied {{development}} and larval biology, host use, and gamete interactions in three obligately symbiotic polychaetes in the genus Arctonoe (Family Polynoidae). The three polychaetes are ectosymbionts of other marine invertebrates, {{and within the}} Puget Sound region, their host ranges do not overlap. Except for A. fragilis, which feeds on host tissue, they are probably commensals. The three species have similar ontogenies, with long-lived planktotrophic larvae; benthic juveniles seek out hosts soon after metamorphosis. Surveys of allozyme variation confirmed that the three Arctonoe species were genetically distinct. Populations of A. pulchra on two host species were also strongly differentiated, and should be considered distinct species. Populations of A. vittata associated with three host species were weakly differentiated {{in one of two}} years. Thus, some "host generalists" are actually comprised of isolated lineages of host specialists. I used transplant experiments to examine the role of physiological incompatibilities in restricting symbiont host range. A. pulchra and A. vittata died when paired with the seastar Evasterias troschelii, the principal host of A. fragilis. In other combinations of symbionts and hosts tested, all symbionts survived. While these incompatibilities can partially explain observed patterns of host use in Arctonoe, other processes must also be operating. Gamete incompatibilities among closely-related species may be a consequence of divergence at <b>gamete</b> <b>recognition</b> loci as a by-product of reproductive isolation, selection against hybrids, or a process of sexual selection at polymorphic <b>gamete</b> <b>recognition</b> loci. The first two hypotheses predict that gamete incompatibility appears after reproductive isolation has arisen, and the third that incompatibility appears simultaneously with isolation. Gametes of Arctonoe spp. are compatible in all crosses, over a range of concentrations and contact times, despite estimated divergence times of 1 - 3 million years before present. These data are consistent with the first two hypotheses but allow rejection of the third. Another common pattern in interspecific gamete interactions is asymmetric gamete compatibility. I use a simple genetic model to show that such asymmetries are predictable, but temporary, consequences of divergence between isolated populations...|$|E

Sperm undergo in {{the male and female}} genital tract important post-testicular endogenous changes enabling them to reach the site of fertilization and to ferlize the egg. In a species-comparing study (horse, cattle, pig) the expression of functional relevant proteins and their structure-function relationship have been studied. It could be shown that the expression of homologous proteins varies among species reflecting the post-testicular acquisition of sperm fertilizing capacity. Furthermore, the function of those proteins can be species-dependent modified or significantly changed. From studies in the mouse it has been concluded that in mammals the oocyte exclusively synthesizes the ZP glycoproteins. By immunocytochemistry and in situ hybridisation {{it has been shown that}} in species developing a thick zona pellucida the surrounding follicle cells contribute in a developmental manner to synthesis indicating that the synthesis activity of the oocyte may be not sufficient. The zona pellucida is thought to be the barriere against heterologous fertilization by regulating species-specific. <b>gamete</b> <b>recognition.</b> In vitro fertilization with bovine oocytes monitored by electron microscopy demonstrates that species-specificity can be also regulated at later steps of fertilization as at zona penetration or formation of the pronucleus. In conclusion, a contribution to understanding the complex processes of post-testicular sperm maturation and formation of the zona pellucida has been made.

We {{examined the}} role of gamete compatibility in species integrity using cross-fertilization studies between sympatric Asterias sea stars from a secondary contact zone in the northwest Atlantic. In crosses between single males and single females, gametes of both species were compatible and produced viable, fertile hybrid offspring, but with considerable variation in the receptivity of eggs to heterospecific sperm. Differential compatibility of heterospecific gametes was detected in sperm competition studies in which we used a nuclear DNA marker to assign paternity to larval offspring. Several families showed conspecific sperm precedence in A. forbesi eggs, and one family showed competitive superiority of A. forbesi sperm fertilizing A. rubens eggs. Gametic interactions are {{an important component of}} prezygotic reproductive isolation in sympatric Asterias. The interaction between gametes of these closely related sea stars is consistent with the function of <b>gamete</b> <b>recognition</b> systems that are known to mediate fertilization success and speciation in other marine invertebrates...|$|E
40|$|AbstractWe {{report the}} {{identification}} of SED 1, a protein required for mouse sperm binding to the egg zona pellucida. SED 1 is homologous to {{a small group of}} secreted cell-matrix adhesive proteins that contain Notch-like EGF repeats and discoidin/F 5 / 8 type C domains. SED 1 is expressed in spermatogenic cells and is secreted by the initial segment of the caput epididymis, resulting in SED 1 localization on the sperm plasma membrane overlying the acrosome. SED 1 binds specifically to the zona pellucida of unfertilized oocytes, but not to the zona of fertilized eggs. Recombinant SED 1 and anti-SED 1 antibodies competitively inhibit sperm-egg binding, as do truncated SED 1 proteins containing a discoidin/C domain. SED 1 null males are subfertile and their sperm are unable to bind to the egg coat in vitro. These studies illustrate that Notch-like EGF and discoidin/C domains, protein motifs that facilitate a variety of cellular interactions, participate in <b>gamete</b> <b>recognition</b> as well...|$|E
40|$|SummaryZP 3, a major {{component}} of the zona pellucida (ZP) matrix coating mammalian eggs, is essential for fertilization by acting as sperm receptor. By retaining a propeptide that contains a polymerization-blocking external hydrophobic patch (EHP), we determined the crystal structure of an avian homolog of ZP 3 at 2. 0 Å resolution. The structure unveils the fold of a complete ZP domain module in a homodimeric arrangement required for secretion and reveals how EHP prevents premature incorporation of ZP 3 into the ZP. This suggests mechanisms underlying polymerization and how local structural differences, reflected by alternative disulfide patterns, control the specificity of ZP subunit interaction. Close relative positioning of a conserved O-glycan important for sperm binding and the hypervariable, positively selected C-terminal region of ZP 3 suggests a concerted role in the regulation of species-restricted <b>gamete</b> <b>recognition.</b> Alternative conformations of the area around the O-glycan indicate how sperm binding could trigger downstream events via intramolecular signaling...|$|E
40|$|Abstract 				 				 					 						Background 					Strongylocentrotid {{sea urchins}} {{have a long}} {{tradition}} as model organisms for studying many fundamental processes in biology including fertilization, embryology, development and genome regulation but the phylogenetic relationships of the group remain largely unresolved. Although the differing isolating mechanisms of vicariance and rapidly evolving <b>gamete</b> <b>recognition</b> proteins have been proposed, a stable and robust phylogeny is unavailable. 				 				 					 						Results 					We used a phylogenomic approach with mitochondrial and nuclear genes {{taking advantage of the}} whole-genome sequencing of nine species in the group to establish a stable (i. e. concordance in tree topology among multiple lies of evidence) and robust (i. e. high nodal support) phylogenetic hypothesis for the family Strongylocentrotidae. We generated eight draft mitochondrial genome assemblies and obtained 13 complete mitochondrial genes for each species. Consistent with previous studies, mitochondrial sequences failed to provide a reliable phylogeny. In contrast, we obtained a very well-supported phylogeny from 2301 nuclear genes without evidence of positive Darwinian selection both from the majority of most-likely gene trees and the concatenated fourfold degenerate sites: ((P. depressus, (M. nudus, M. franciscanus), (H. pulcherrimus, (S. purpuratus, (S. fragilis, (S. pallidus, (S. droebachiensis, S. intermedius)). This phylogeny was consistent with a single invasion of deep-water environments followed by a holarctic expansion by Strongylocentrotus. Divergence times for each species estimated with reference to the divergence times between the two major clades of the group suggest a correspondence in the timing {{with the opening of the}} Bering Strait and the invasion of the holarctic regions. 				 				 					 						Conclusions 					Nuclear genome data contains phylogenetic signal informative for understanding the evolutionary history of this group. However, mitochondrial genome data does not. Vicariance can explain major patterns observed in the phylogeny. Other isolating mechanisms are appropriate to explore in this system to help explain divergence patterns not well supported by vicariance, such as the effects of rapidly evolving <b>gamete</b> <b>recognition</b> proteins on isolating populations. Our findings of a stable and robust phylogeny, with the increase in mitochondrial and nuclear comparative genomic data, provide a system in which we can enhance our understanding of molecular evolution and adaptation in this group of sea urchins...|$|E
40|$|Behaviors, morphologies, {{and genetic}} loci {{directly}} involved in reproduction have been increasingly shown to be polymorphic within populations. Explaining how such variants are maintained by selection is crucial to understanding the genetic basis of fertility differences, but direct tests of how alleles at reproductive loci affect fertility are rare. In the sea urchin genus Echinometra, the protein bindin mediates sperm attachment to eggs, evolves quickly, and is polymorphic within species. Eggs exposed to experimental sperm mixtures show strong {{discrimination on the basis}} of the males’ bindin genotype. Different females produce eggs that nonrandomly select sperm from different males, showing that variable egg–sperm interactions determine fertility. Eggs select sperm with a bindin genotype similar to their own, suggesting strong linkage between female choice and male trait loci. These experiments demonstrate that alleles at a single locus can have a strong effect on fertilization and that reproductive loci may retain functional polymorphisms through epistatic interactions between male and female traits. They also suggest that positive selection at <b>gamete</b> <b>recognition</b> loci like bindin involves strong selection within species on mate choice interactions...|$|E
40|$|Compelling {{evidence}} {{has demonstrated that}} zona binding represents <b>gamete</b> <b>recognition</b> by sperm binding with high affinity and specificity to complex glycoproteins of the zona pellucida. In the present study we evaluated the hemizona assay (HZA) {{in the investigation of}} the interaction of mouse spermatozoa with unfertilized murine oocytes and hemizonae after exposure to solubilized murine zonae pellucidae proteins. The zonae pellucidae were isolated from ovarian tissue following described mincing techniques. The sperm binding characteristics of murine spermatozoa were studied by using SDS-PAGE isolated ZP 2 (± 120 Kd) and ZP 3 (± 83 Kd) components of the zona pellucida. Sperm receptor activity was examined in a competitive gamete binding fashion using the HZA as an indicator of sperm/zona interaction. The results illustrated that isolated, solubilized ZP 2 and ZP 3 glycoprotein moieties of the zona pellucida inhibited sperm binding to hemizonae and oocytes when compared to controls, and that the HZA can be utilized as an internally controlled homologous bioassay to evaluate the effects of zona pellucida proteins on tight binding of spermatozoa to the zona pellucida.

40|$|Fertilization is {{a complex}} process {{involving}} several steps, including sperm activation, oocyte maturation, chemotaxis, <b>gamete</b> <b>recognition,</b> and cell fusion. Many of these essential steps are controlled and regulated by intercellular communication between gametes. This thesis work examines the communication events that occur between sperm and oocytes cells that facilitate fertilization. Oocyte meiotic maturation {{is one example of}} a step in fertilization in which intercellular signaling between gametes is required. In many species, sperm prepare the oocyte for fertilization by providing signals for meiotic maturation. Oocyte meiotic maturation is defined by the transition between diakinesis and metaphase I and is accompanied by MAP kinase activation, nuclear envelope breakdown, and meiotic spindle assembly. C. elegans sperm signal oocyte meiotic maturation using the major sperm protein (MSP) as a hormone. Interestingly, the MSP also functions as the central cytoskeletal protein required for the amoeboid motility of nematode sperm. The discovery of MSP’s signaling role raised the question of how sperm export MSP to signal oocytes at a distance. MSP lacks a hydrophobic leader sequence and C. elegans sper...|$|E
