On 16 November 1938, Bristol received <b>formal</b> <b>authorisation</b> to commence the detailed design phase {{of the project and}} to proceed with the construction of four prototypes. Amongst the design requirements was that the aircraft {{had to be able to}} accommodate the Rolls-Royce Griffon engine as an alternative powerplant to the proposed Hercules, and that it have maximum interchangeability between the two engines, which would feature removable installations.|$|E

Previously, there was no <b>formal</b> EU wide <b>authorisation</b> procedure, so each EU member state regulated these types of products at the national level.|$|R
40|$|Researching the {{equality}} implications {{of being a}} migrant in Britain is hampered by imprecise definitions of what a migrant is and {{by a lack of}} data on many equality groups (groups which share a common attribute in respect of age, disability, gender, race, religion or belief, or sexual orientation, as defined by the Equality Act 2006). The literature and evidence on inequalities tends to be more abundant on gender and race but remains focused on ethnic minority categories rather than on migrants as such. While the foreign-born population in the UK has increased from four to six million over the last decade, people arrive via different routes and with varying intentions. Much recent debate on the benefits and pressures resulting from immigration has been provoked by the large numbers of arrivals from Eastern Europe since 2004, but they, like other migrants from the European Union (EU), have freedom of movement guaranteed by EU Directives. Although they have to register or obtain authorisation to work legally (and 766, 000 had registered by the end of 2007), there are few reliable statistics on their presence in specific areas or in the UK as a whole. Other migrants from outside the EU also come to the UK to work (about 200, 000 in 2006) or study (309, 000 in 2006). A number of migrants, estimated at between 310, 000 and 570, 000, are believed to be living in the country without <b>formal</b> immigration <b>authorisation.</b> In 2007, the largest group of those born abroad was from India (553, 300), followed by those from Poland (423, 300). There are significant differences in terms of gender and age between different national groups, comprising recent and established migrants, and in their experiences of employment and access to services. This heterogeneity makes policymaking based on averages or an assumed homogeneity meaningless or even dangerous...|$|R
50|$|The Freischar was the German name {{given to}} an irregular, {{volunteer}} military unit that, unlike regular or reserve military forces, {{participated in a}} war without the <b>formal</b> <b>authorisation</b> {{of one of the}} belligerents, but on the instigation of a political party or an individual. A Freischar deployed against a foreign enemy was often called a Freikorps. The term Freischar has been commonly used in German-speaking Europe since 1848. The members of a Freischar were called Freischärler. As early as 1785 Johann von Ewald published in Kassel his Essay on Partisan Warfare (Abhandlung über den kleinen Krieg, which described his experiences with the rebels in the North American colonies.|$|E
50|$|Humanist weddings {{have since}} {{becoming}} increasingly popular and, in 2010, with over 70 celebrants authorised to conduct them 2,092 legal humanist weddings {{took place in}} Scotland, becoming the third most popular form of Wedding in Scotland after Registrars and the Church of Scotland. The Society organises training, mentoring and performance reviews of celebrants, and submits names of celebrants to the Registrar General annually for authorisation. Prior to the Marriage and Civil Partnership (Scotland) Act 2014, the Society performed a similar role for celebrants to conduct same-sex commitment ceremonies and weddings, although <b>formal</b> <b>authorisation</b> by the Registrar is not required for these ceremonies since they {{had no effect on}} the legal status of individuals concerned. Since the legalisation of same-sex marriages, both sets of same-sex and opposite-sex marriages are treated the same way.|$|E
50|$|Although it {{is unclear}} whether <b>formal</b> <b>authorisation</b> was {{actually}} granted, the station began to appear in the railway company's timetables in June 1903. The name Udiam Halt was first used but this was soon abandoned in favour of Junction Road (for Hawkhurst), even though the village of Hawkhurst was some 4 mi away and had been served by its own railway station for the last eleven years. A lack of funds meant that no station buildings were provided at Junction Road, the station consisting merely of a single unsheltered platform constructed of wood and earth. In 1909, a siding was commissioned on the western side of the B2244 on the Up side of the line facing Robertsbridge and this was controlled by a two-levered ground frame situated nearby. The position of the siding meant that trains wishing to shunt here had to be tow-roped.|$|E
40|$|The growing {{practice}} of Communion by Extension was given <b>formal</b> <b>authorisation</b> by the Church of England General Synod in 2000 {{with the expectation}} that it would be used in particular circumstances, including explicitly the rural multi-church benefice. This paper reviews the historical origins of the {{practice of}} Communion by Extension and clarifies the intentions of the authorisation given in 2000. Then the intentions of the 2000 authorisation are compared and contrasted with current parochial practice within one English diocese. Considerable divergence is found. Five main themes are identified and discussed: the relationship between worship and mission; the pressures on clerical time; sacramental self-sufficiency; the value given to familiarity; and the choice between reservation and congregationalism...|$|E
40|$|The regime {{governing}} {{class actions}} in the Federal Court of Australia is unique, by international standards, as {{it does not require}} the <b>formal</b> <b>authorisation</b> of the Court before a proceeding may be brought and conducted as a class action. A class action may be commenced in the Federal Court as long as certain prerequisites are satisfied. Another unique aspect of this regime is that wide powers have been conferred upon the Court to terminate, as class actions, proceedings that have complied with the requirements for commencing a class action. It is the aim of this article to explore the conceptual and practical issues raised by the availability and exercise of these powers to discontinue properly commenced class actions. As part of this evaluation, the Canadian and United States class action regimes are extensively canvassed...|$|E
40|$|Purpose The NHS’s National Programme for IT (NPfIT) in the UK {{with its}} {{proposed}} nation-wide online health record service poses serious technical challenges, {{especially with regard}} to access control and patient confidentiality. The complexity of the confidentiality requirements and their constantly evolving nature (due to changes in law, guidelines and ethical consensus) make traditional technologies such as role-based access control unsuitable. Furthermore, a more formal approach is also needed for debating about and communicating on information governance, as natural-language descriptions of security policies are inherently ambiguous and incomplete. Our main goal is to convince the reader of the strong benefits of employing formal policy specification in nation-wide electronic health record (EHR) projects. Approach Many difficulties could be alleviated by specifying the requirements in a <b>formal</b> <b>authorisation</b> policy language such as Cassandra. The language is unambiguous, declarative and machineenforceable, and is based on distributed constrained Datalog. Cassandra is interpreted within a distributed Trust Management environment, where digital credentials are used for establishing mutual trust between strangers...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{will argue}} that {{feminism}} is {{at the edge of}} a new wave brought about by the fragmentation of the feminist political movement and the rise of postmodern theory. It contends that postmodern theories have been used by feminists as a 'critical strategy' to understand why the movement fragmented and to move towards the acceptance of more strategic and conventional politics. Thus many feminists are now prepared to leave behind the utopian and separatist legacies of the second wave. These feminists are willing to consider how a future feminist movement can be built that will account for the differences between women, and realise that there will thus need to be a painful and precarious process of alliance-building. It is argued that given the precarious nature of the alliance, feminists in a new wave must also re-conceive democratic models of citizenship to ensure that women and feminists' concerns are met in the wider political sphere. This second concern also makes sure that they have institutional and procedural support should fragmentation recur. The thesis considers three such models of citizenship: Seyla Benhabib's deliberative model, Iris Young's communicative model and Chantal Mouffe's agonal one. It contends that these models only partly address the concerns of new wave feminism, because they are based on transformative and participatory models of politics. These models undermine the importance of feminists finding legitimate political relationships that respect the multiplicity of their demands as feminists, as women and as citizens. This thesis concludes that representative models of democracy are more suited to feminist concerns in a new wave. Such models have distinctive characteristics that allow women to be politically included in terms of a range of political concerns and identities. Representative models of democracy, moreover, make it clear that the political relationship is one of <b>formal</b> <b>authorisation</b> and not one of personal identity recognition and transformation...|$|E
40|$|Migration {{can be a}} {{hazardous}} venture, particularly if carried out clandestinely. Evidence indicates that foreigners working without <b>formal</b> <b>authorisation,</b> i. e. 'irregular migrant workers', are in a particularly vulnerable position primarily because of their irregular immigration status. They {{are more likely to}} be subjected to exploitative and unsafe employment practices in terms of benefits and conditions. This study examines the protection available to this category of migrant workers in South Africa, particularly their right of access to work-related social protection. South Africa is a major migrant-receiving country in Southern Africa because of its relatively stronger economy and political stability. However, the employment of foreign nationals without work permits, or foreigners working contrary to visa requirements, raises a series of policy issues. These issues, against the background of fairness and equity discourses pertaining to socio-economic entitlements, become exacerbated. This study examines the adequacy of domestic, constitutional and legislative frameworks that offer work-related social protection to foreign workers in South Africa. In the context of international, continental, and regional instruments that provide similar protection to irregular migrants, it could be argued that South Africa's restrictive legislative framework compromises equality in the right of access to social protection for some migrants. Although effective migration management depends on careful juxtaposition of myriad policies, emerging evidence suggests conflicting interplay between key South African policies intended to manage the rights of workers specifically and labour migration in the country generally. Critical analysis of relevant national immigration, labour, and social security laws indicates inconsistency with international human rights principles concerning the equality of opportunity or treatment of irregular migrants vis-àvis regular migrants and nationals regarding social protection. Yet, inequalities in the actual processes or opportunities (means) embedded in these policies disentitle many vulnerable foreign workers from important constitutionally entrenched fundamental rights because their presence and/or employment violates existing immigration laws. The study concludes by recommending policy interventions that may help remedy these problems...|$|E
