As {{they began to}} read, the duo noticed {{that it had a}} {{tendency}} to take [...] "readers on a lot of side trips"—"from detailed explanations of surveillance techniques to angry attacks on corrupt Swedish industrialists," [...] professed The Hollywood Reporter Gregg Kilday. Fincher recalled of the encounter: [...] "The ballistic, ripping-yarn thriller aspect of it is kind of a red herring in a weird way. It is the thing that throws Salander and Blomkvist together, but it is their relationship you keep coming back to. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>wondering</b> what 350 pages Zaillian would get rid of." [...] Because Zaillian was already cultivating the screenplay, the director avoided interfering. After a conversation, Fincher was comfortable [...] "they were headed in the same direction".|$|E

And John, it was about something you said a few weeks ago, actually. You said the title tag is a ranking signal, but you said that you use a part of the title tag. And that's really stuck with me. And <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>wondering</b> what you meant by that, when you say you use a part of the title tag as a ranking signal.JOHN MUELLER: We use that just as a part. I think it's not like the primary ranking factor of a page, to put it that way.DANIEL PICKEN: Right.JOHN MUELLER: We do use it for ranking, but it's not the most critical part of a page. So it's not worthwhile filling it with keywords to kind of hope that it works that way. In general, we try to recognize when a title tag is stuffed with keywords because that's also a bad user experience for users in the search results. If they're looking to understand what these pages are about and they just see a jumble of keywords, then that doesn't really help.Moz has already been cited as assigning critical importance to the Title tags. However, they have the following to say about the Meta description:... it's important to note that meta descriptions do not directly influence Google's ranking algorithms for normal web search. Help says pretty much the same things, as does Matt Cutts, in one of this [...]|$|E

40|$|AbstractAt a {{time when}} the {{supremacy}} of SQUIDs as the most sensitive magnetometers is being challenged by the recent progress of optically pumped atomic magnetometers operating at room temperature, looking into new opportunities to further improve SQUIDs sensitivity would probably be most welcomed by the SQUID community. By far the most promising such opportunity is to operate a double (D) rf SQUID (an rf-SQUID in which a dc-SQUID is used instead of a single Josephson junction) in a non-adiabatic regime at frequencies of about a few GHz. At these relatively high frequencies required to assure an ultra-high SQUID sensitivity the SQUID-design complexity and the cost of the electronics involved (current generator and SQUID amplifier) are still kept at reasonable levels. The advantages of using this concept, as presented in my contribution in more detail now, are overwhelming. Ironically, although this idea in its preliminary shape has been around for some time now [1], the opportunity has never <b>been</b> explored experimentally! <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>just</b> <b>wondering</b> what else {{needs to be done to}} get this message across the SQUID community and have this concept finally tested experimentally...|$|R

6000|$|The next afternoon, {{while we}} were sitting in the park waiting for the Troy band to begin playing, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>wondering</b> <b>just</b> when they would reach the [...] "Washington Post March," [...] which I like because <b>I</b> can always <b>be</b> sure of it, my unknown friends came strolling our way. The man looked bewildered and bored, with {{something}} of desperation in his troubled eye, and his wife looked tired and disheartened. The young girl, still in white duck, wore the same air of passive injury I had noted in her the night before. Their faces all three lighted up at sight of me; but they faded again at the cold and meagre response I made to their smiles under correction of my wife's fears of them. <b>I</b> own it <b>was</b> base of me; but I had begun to feel myself that it might be too large a contract to attempt their consolation, and, in fact, after one is fifty scarcely any romance will keep overnight.|$|R

5000|$|Diana Ross, Van Halen, Frankie Goes to Hollywood, The Smiths, Talking Heads and Donna Summer {{also turned}} down {{requests}} to appear. Depeche Mode, {{one of the}} most successful English bands of the 1980s, was not invited. Alan Wilder, one of the DM members at the time said: [...] "I doubt very much that we would have accepted the invitation, had we been asked. My personal view is that giving to 'chariddy' should be a totally private gesture, out of which no personal gain should be made. Inevitably, nearly all the artists who took part in Live Aid achieved a considerable rise in record sales and being the cynic <b>I</b> <b>am,</b> <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>just</b> how much of the profit gained from those sales actually ended up going to Ethiopia." [...] UB40 lead singer Ali Campbell admitted that his band also was also ignored by Geldof while planning the list of musical acts of the British leg of the event: [...] "We weren't asked to do Live Aid because Uncle Bob didn't like us. It was a great gig but <b>I</b> thought it <b>was</b> a bit dodgy not having any black acts on the bill when it was raising money for Africa." ...|$|R

Though {{the fellows}} usually call me 'Eddie'--Julius Edward Schwirtz is my full name--my father was named Julius, and my mother's oldest brother was named Edward--my old {{dad used to}} say it wasn't respectful to him because I always {{preferred}} 'Eddie'--old codger used to get quite het up about it. Julius sounds like you was an old Roman or something, and in the business {{you got to have}} a good easy name. Say, speaking of that, I ain't with Lowry any more; I'm chief salesman for the Ætna Automobile Varnish and Wax Company. I certainly got a swell territory--New York, Philly, Bean-Town, Washi'nun, Balt'more, Cleveland, Columbus, Akron, and so on, and of course most especially Detroit. Sell right direct to the jobbers and the big auto companies. Good bunch of live wires. Some class! I'm rolling in my little old four thousand bucks a year now, where before I didn't hardly make more 'n twenty-six or twenty-eight hundred. Keeps me on the jump alrightee. Fact. I got so tired and run-down-- I hadn't planned to take any vacation at all, but the boss himself says to me, 'Eddie, we can't afford to let you get sick; you're the best man we've got,' he says, 'and you got to take a good vacation now and forget all about business for a couple weeks.' 'Well,' <b>I</b> says, 'I <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>wondering</b> if you <b>was</b> smart enough to get along without me if <b>I</b> <b>was</b> to sneak out and rubber at some scenery and maybe get up a flirtation with a pretty summer girl'--and I guess that must be you, Miss Golden!--and he laughs and says, 'Oh yes, I guess the business wouldn't go bust for a few days,' and so I goes down and gets a shave and a hair-cut and a singe and a shampoo--there ain't as much to cut as there used to be, though--ha, ha!--and here I am." ...|$|R

"Away they went, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>wondering</b> whether I {{should not}} do well to follow them when up the lane came a neat little landau, the coachman with his coat only half-buttoned, and his tie under his ear, while all the tags of his harness were {{sticking}} out of the buckles. It hadn't pulled up before she shot out of the hall door and into it. I only caught a glimpse of her at the moment, but she was a lovely woman, with a face that a man might die for.|$|E
