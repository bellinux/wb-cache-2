Since such control measures are usually acontextual, they generally lack catalyzing effects that were originally claimed for them. The intent {{of this paper is}} to review the logical <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>security</b> measures and the manner in which these have been implemented in a British Hospital. It interprets the ad hoc nature of the security controls and argues that a fuller analysis of organizational contexts is necessary in order to develop secure environments...|$|E

40|$|We {{analyze the}} welfare {{properties}} of derivative securities that profit-maximizing issuers offer to investors who have inferior information and neglect the information {{content of the}} offer. To capture the markets for structured securities and exotic exchange-traded funds, we assume that issuers can choose both the underlying asset and the <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>security.</b> An issuer's optimal security induces investors to bet on unlikely market movements, creating both excess risk taking and undersaving. Giving more information to the issuer leads it to choose an underlying asset on which its information is more extreme, exacerbating both effects and hence lowering social welfare. Furthermore, providing inferior and noisy additional information to investors also lowers welfare because the security is then written on an underlying asset about which the information is misleading. If the issuer can base its security {{on a combination of}} underlying assets, it optimally creates a "custom-designed" index to maximize its informational advantage and minimize risk, minimizing investor and social welfare. Restricting the set of underlying assets - a kind of standardization - increases welfare by preventing the issuer from systematically selling a security with extreme or misleading information. Once this policy is adopted, increasing investor information becomes beneficial...|$|E

40|$|The {{editors of}} this book {{inviting}} this contribution ask a provocative question: does North America exist at all as a meaningful political entity, economic region, cultural idea or community? This chapter deals with this question by looking into the experiences of those women that have contested the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA thereafter) as a violent and far from sustainable project for regional integration, in particular, working class and Zapatista women in Mexico. My central argument is that despite the constraints that NAFTA, as particular mode of political economic governance has posed to Mexican womenʼs exercise of their citizenship rights, their strategies and activities of localized 1 resistance have unveiled the violent and unsustainable nature of regional enterprises such as NAFTA extension in the <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Security</b> and Prosperity Partnership (SPP thereafter) for North America. Furthermore, these strategies and activities might contribute to an open ended questioning on regions and regionalism as cultural and imperial constructs which produce and reproduce particular ways of understanding {{the world in which}} certain knowledges are actively produced as inexistent and/or irrelevant by/for International Political Economy/International Relations academic communities. In other to develop these ideas, this paper looks into the constraints that NAFTA and its ʻfailed ʼ extension in the form of SPP have posed to working class and indigenous women rights-claiming activities and strategies.

40|$|Information {{security}} {{is becoming an}} increasingly serious problem faced by many enterprises and organizations that perform part of their business processes via the Internet. It has been a hot topic among the industry and the academic community for many years. However, {{most of the research}} done in this field focuses on security technologies, while only {{a very small percentage of}} it focuses on economics of investment in security. Gordon and Loeb [1] have put forth a simple but useful model to determine the optimal investment in security. They consider the investment made in preventive mechanism, and derive that the optimal level of investment in information security should not exceed 37 % of the expected loss caused by the vulnerability without any protection, for two classes of security breach probability functions: power function and exponential function. Based on Gordon and Loeb's work, this thesis first relaxes the specific assumption of the functional <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>security</b> breach probability function, and provides a more general result on the upper bound of optimal investment in security. Second, it introduces hacker's response behavior and detective mechanism, and as a result makes a more general and adaptive economic model of investment in information security. It is concluded that for an arbitrary form of security breach probability function, the optimal level of total investment made in both preventive and detective mechanisms should not exceed one half of the expected loss without any protection; and this upper bound still holds if the hacker's response behavior is integrated to the model. In addition, this thesis derives the circumstance under which the investment should be made in detective mechanism for a better overall performance.
