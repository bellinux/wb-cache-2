40|$|AbstractIn recent years, {{the studies}} in <b>inter-devices</b> {{communication}} (M 2 M) {{which is considered}} to be the Internet, ecosystem of the objects have accelerated in line with the developments in mobile communication technologies. This way, development of systems making human lives easier in smart environment, smart agriculture, smart grid fields with monitoring purposes which can be considered among M 2 M implementations is now possible. These systems can be developed with sensor node platform which can detect and communicate. Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) consists of these sensor nodes containing simple processors, low power consuming antennas and various detectors. As the sensor networks do not require wired communication infrastructure, they can easily and inexpensively be formed with no harm to the environment. The sensor nodes have the ability to store and process data locally thanks to the software and hardware structure they have. The fact that they can get in contact with each other enables them to collaborate in performing complicated tasks along with exchanging information. As the communication means have low power consumption, it ensures that the life of the sensor nodes is long. The fact, too, that the nodes are programmable after being placed in the medium provides greater advantages. Because of the low cost and flexibility in use, the wireless sensor nodes are convenient to be used in many industrial and environmental applications.

The peak systolic velocity (PSV), the end-diastolic velocity (EDV) and the resulting resistivity index (RI) were averaged for 3 cardiac cycles. To {{evaluate the}} reproducibility between both device measurements, the Lin’s concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) was used.

30|$|We {{implemented}} the architecture and evaluated it through simulations, comparing its performance {{to that of}} a client/server system. A client/server system generates less traffic when the network is small and the volume of <b>inter-device</b> communication (i.e., number of CoAP observation relationships and the frequency of CoAP notifications) is low. A client/server system also puts a lower load on the Radio Access Network (RAN) since in a P 2 P system, each message goes through the RAN twice, both {{on the side of the}} sending and receiving peer. Further, the server of a client/server system is typically located in a high-speed network. However, a client/server system scales very badly as the network becomes larger or the volume of <b>inter-device</b> communication increases. The communication delays of client/server and decentralized systems are on the same level when using dedicated connections for CoAP observation relationships. However, when CoAP messages are tunneled, which is an appropriate strategy when the volume of <b>inter-device</b> communication is low, the delays associated with the decentralized architecture are higher.|$|E

The <b>inter-device</b> agreements of the 2 Cirrus HD OCTs for average, quadrant, and clock-hour RNFL thickness values were determined with Wilcoxon signed rank test, Friedman test, Cronbach’s alpha (α), intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), coefficient of variation (COV), and Bland-Altman plot. Results: The mean age of the participants was 25. 82 ± 3. 28 years and all had a 0. 00 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution of best-corrected visual acuity. The signal strengths of scans from the 2 Cirrus HD OCT were not significantly different (p = 0. 317). The <b>inter-device</b> agreement of average RNFL thickness was excellent (α, 0. 940; ICC, 0. 945; COV, 2. 45 ± 1. 52 %). However, the agreement of nasal quadrant RNFL thickness was not very good (α, 0. 715; ICC, 0. 716; COV, 5. 72 ± 4. 64 %).

MethodsThirty-one (31) volunteers free of pressure ulcers or broken skin at the sternum, sacrum, and heels were assessed with the SEM Scanner. Each of three operators utilized each of three devices to collect readings from four anatomical sites (sternum, sacrum, left and right heels) on each subject for a total of 108 readings per subject collected over approximately 30  min. For each combination of operator-device-anatomical site, three SEM readings were collected. Inter-operator and <b>inter-device</b> agreement and reliability were estimated.

40|$|Signal-scale {{cooperation}} is {{a class of}} techniques designed to harness the same gains offered by multi-antenna communication in scenarios where devices {{are too small to}} contain an array of antennas. While the potential improvements in reliability at the physical layer are well known, three key challenges must be addressed to harness these gains at the medium access layer: (a) the distributed synchronization and coordination of devices to enable cooperative behavior, (b) the conservation of energy for devices cooperating to help others, and (c) the management of increased <b>inter-device</b> interference caused by multiple spatially separate transmissions in a cooperative network. In this thesis, we offer three contributions that respectively answer the above three challenges. First, we present two novel cooperative medium access control protocols: Distributed On-demand Cooperation (DOC) and Power-controlled Distributed On-demand Cooperation (PDOC). These protocols utilize negative acknowledgments to synchronize and trigger cooperative relay transmissions in a completely distributed manner. Furthermore, they avoid cooperative transmissions that would likely be unhelpful to the source of the traffic. Second, we present an energy conservation algorithm known as Distributed Energy-Conserving Cooperation (DECC). DECC allows devices to alter their cooperative behavior based on measured changes to their own energy efficiency. With DECC, devices become self-aware of the impact of signal-scale cooperation [...] they explicitly monitor their own performance and scale {{the degree to which they}} cooperate with others accordingly. Third and finally, we present a series of protocols to combat the challenge of <b>inter-device</b> interference. Whereas energy efficiency can be addressed by a self-aware device monitoring its own performance, <b>inter-device</b> interference requires devices with network awareness that understand the impact of their behavior on the devices around them. We investigate and quantify the impact of incomplete network awareness by proposing a modeling approximation to derive relaying policy behaviors.

However, existing mobile devices rely on the wireless infrastructure to access Internet services provided by central application providers. This architecture is inefficient in many situations and also does not utilize abundant <b>inter-device</b> communication opportunities in many scenarios. This paper proposes the human network (HUNET), a network architecture that enables information sharing between mobile devices through direct <b>inter-device</b> communication. We design B-SUB, an interest-driven information sharing system for HUNETs. In B-SUB, content and user interests are described by tags, which are human-readable strings that are designated by users. An experiment is performed to demonstrate {{the effectiveness of this}} tag-based content description method. To facilitate efficient data dissemination, we invent the Temporal Counting Bloom filter (TCBF) to encode tags, which also reduces the overhead of content routing. Comprehensive theoretical analyses on the parameter tuning of B-SUB are presented and verify B-SUB’s ability to work efficiently under various network conditions. We then extend B-SUB’s routing scheme to provide a stronger privacy guarantee. Extensive real-world trace-driven simulations are performed to evaluate the performance of B-SUB, and the results demonstrate its efficiency and usefulness.
