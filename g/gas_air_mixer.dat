40|$|The {{outlook for}} {{increased}} gas cooling use {{has not only}} improved because the residential air conditioning market in general has grown but also {{because many of the}} factors that depressed <b>gas</b> <b>air</b> conditioner sales earlier have been eliminated. First, the gas cooling equipment available today is more reliable and durable than before. During the 1960 s, deficiencies in the <b>gas</b> absorption <b>air</b> conditioner caused an annual failure rate of about 8 percent. It is now less than 1 percent due to a number of improvements implemented by Arkla Industries during the 1970 s. For example, the stainless steel generators in the units were improved with chrome plating, which prolongs the system life of the units. The quality of the steel in the restrictors, burner tubes, and evaporator coils was also improved. Residential <b>gas</b> <b>air</b> conditioners now carry a ten-year warranty on all defects in material and workmanship on the sealed refrigeration unit, while a compressor in an electric air conditioner normally has only a one- to five-year warranty. ...|$|R

40|$|Nonlinear device {{behavior}} {{is one of}} the concerns in telecommunications because of the possible information interference and the reduction in effective bandwidth. Measurement systems and black box modeling techniques to characterize and simulate these nonlinear devices would be a valuable tool. This paper explains briefly a prototype of a measurement system for nonlinear RF and microwave devices, measuring both calibrated amplitudes and phases of signals on an arbitrary frequency grid and it introduces also black box modeling capabilities starting from these calibrated measurements. Introduction Use of the frequency spectrum is expensive and its redundant usage is the wrong solution to certain shortcomings. Any technique to avoid or reduce these shortcomings without additional consumption of the radio spectrum will payoff quickly considered the density of the future information traffic either across wires or through the <b>air.</b> <b>Mixers</b> and amplifiers are indispensable components in telec [...] ...|$|R
