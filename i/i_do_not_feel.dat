On 24 January 2009, Yousafzai wrote: [...] "Our annual exams are due after the vacations {{but this will}} only be possible if the Taliban allow girls to go to school.

She detailed her diagnosis, surgeries, and personal experiences, and described her decision to undergo preventive surgery as a proactive measure for the sake of her six children. Jolie further wrote, [...] "On a personal note, <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>feel</b> any less of a woman.

2500|$|There {{is not a}} {{day that}} goes by that <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>feel</b> remorse for what {{happened}} that day in My Lai", he told members of the club. [...] "I feel remorse for the Vietnamese who were killed, for their families, for the American soldiers involved and their families. I am very sorry....If you are asking why I did not stand up to them when I was given the orders, I will have to say that I was a 2nd lieutenant getting orders from my commander and I followed them—foolishly, I guess.|$|E
2500|$|Wilfried Martens (CD) {{criticized the}} French-speaking {{side of the}} country for misinterpreting a [...] "sign of goodwill" [...] made by Leterme. Karel de Gucht (Open VLD) said {{that they do not have}} a veto right about which Fleming can become prime minister. He also added that they overreacted. [...] "Who takes away his {{position}} as prime minister, turns him into a political martyr. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>feel</b> like competing against a political martyr during the next election. Why should he not be allowed to speak? The campaign waged against him...is unacceptable." ...|$|E
2500|$|Members of Occupy Harvard {{used the}} encampment as a {{platform}} to create discussion about the university {{and its role in}} the world. Many criticized Harvard's role in the global economy (and crisis therein): [...] "Year after year, Harvard supplies traders and analysts and financial advisers who go on to run the economy into the ground", said one participating graduate student. Occupiers also criticized finances within the university. Said one doctoral student studying slavery, [...] "I am grateful for what the school has given me, but the lack of transparency about where all that lovely money comes from is something <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>feel</b> comfortable with." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>feel</b> so {{much like}} congratulating Pepton as I had on the {{previous}} evening. I thought he was making too much of his badge-winning.|$|R
60|$|You {{may think}} that <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>feel</b> {{disposed}} to contradict him, though I could make nothing of this sudden and welcome change in his manner.|$|R
6000|$|I {{was proud}} to observe that <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>feel</b> frightened--I suppose because there were two of us. [...] "Why shouldn't we go out?" [...] I asked.|$|R
2500|$|Some fellow gossip bloggers {{have also}} objected to his approach. Trent Vanegas, who runs [...] "Pink Is the New Blog", told Salon.com, [...] "I do not {{outright}} call people gay. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>feel</b> {{it is my}} place, or anyone else's place, to make people {{come out of the}} closet. Being shockingly hurtful just to get attention is not my style." [...] David Hauslaib of gossip blog Jossip.com stated, [...] "The rationale that he's doing this for the good of that gay community is tantamount to saying that there is a gay agenda. Is this a positive for the gay community? I'd say, 'No.'" [...] Author, screenwriter, and former friend Japhy Grant has also questioned his motives, writing on Salon.com, [...] "Spreading gossip is just your average pedestrian variety of immorality. Claiming that you're doing it to further civil rights is an outright sham." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Copyright {{protection}} for computer software is a given, but <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>feel</b> {{that the courts}} should be astute to extend that protection into a region where only the functional effects of a program are in issue. There is a respectable case for saying that copyright is not, in general, concerned with functional effects, {{and there is some}} advantage in a bright line rule protecting only the claimant's embodiment of the function in software and not some superset of that software. The case is not truly analogous with the plot of a novel, because the plot is part of the work itself. The user interface {{is not part of the}} work itself. One could permute all the letters and other codes in the command names, and it would still work in the same way, and all that would be lost is a modest mnemonic advantage. To approach the problem in this way may at least be consistent with the distinction between idea and expression that finds its way into the Software Directive, but, of course, it draws the line between idea and expression in a particular place which some would say lies too far on the side of expression. I think, however, that such is the independence of the particular form of the actual codes used from the overall functioning of the software that it is legitimate to separate them in this way, and not to afford them separate protection when the underlying software is not even arguably copied." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'Oh, nothing; <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>feel</b> {{inclined}} to talk, that was all!' She stopped, and added carelessly after a pause, 'Don't {{you ever wonder}} what is in that soup-tureen?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>feel</b> {{any great}} alarm, sister," [...] said Pierre, smiling, [...] "since I could not but {{perceive}} that the decanter was still full to the stopple." ...|$|R

60|$|As for the Democratic journals, {{they are}} not human enough to affect me at all. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>feel</b> indignation at {{anything}} they may say.|$|E

6000|$|... "But--!" [...] <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>feel</b> angry. <b>I</b> had no sort of jealousy, no wounded pride, {{no sense}} of injury. I had only a sense of grey desolation, of hopeless cross-purposes.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Aunt Maria said so. She said <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>feel.</b> Oh, if <b>I</b> {{could only}} die before he grows up to let one see it. Why wont {{you begin to}} hate me?' ...|$|R
60|$|The most {{surprising}} {{part of the}} whole thing to me was that <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>feel</b> in the least alarmed. If anything, I was rather pleased to see him. It was company.|$|R

6000|$|... "Very strange," [...] muttered Aspel, on {{recovering}} {{sufficiently to}} be led by his friend towards Archangel Court,--"very strange that <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>feel</b> the scoundrels robbing me. I must have slept very soundly." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{had once}} had some thought of fixing in town myself--for I am fond of {{superior}} society; but <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>feel</b> quite {{certain that the}} air of London would agree with Lady Lucas." ...|$|R
