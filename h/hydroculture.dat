40|$|In December 2012 {{then in the}} {{following}} winter season, the occurrence of whitish mycelial coat was observed on the collar of 3 - to 6 -m high Bucida buceras trees grown in <b>hydrocultures</b> to decorate a spacious indoor community space in Vienna. (This plant [shown in Fig. 1] belongs to Combretaceae, Myrtales and commonly named black olive tree, bullet tree, gregorywood and oxhorn bucida.) The mycelium-infested area of the bark appeared to be water-soaked. Near {{the surface of the}} potting mix (earth ball embedded in clay pebbles), the roots were also covered with whitish mycelia (Fig. 2). Over the winter season when the indoor temperature increased from 20 °C to 25 °C, these symptoms were unnoticeable. Regardless of the season, the rhizosphere contained numbers of sclerotia, dark-grey, globose and 8 – 12 mm in diameter that occasionally developed rhizomorph-like mycelial cords. Direct plating of mycelium fragments from the bark and sclerotia from the rhizosphere onto potato dextrose agar amended with ampicillin (500 mg/l) eventually yielded pure fungal cultures of similar characteristics. Cultures routinely incubated in the dark developed white and submerged colonies with sparse aerial mycelia. The fungus grew well between 10 °C and 25 °C, and failed to grow at either 5 °C or 32 °C. The optimal growth was measured at 20 °C with an average radial growth rate of 11 mm per day. After 10 to 12 days, a ring of sclerotia begun to develop {{near the edge of the}} colonies; they turned dark grey and sized 3 – 8 mm. Rather misleadingly, neither conidia, nor sexual spores were observed in these cultures. However, when the fungus was cultured in natural light under laboratory conditions at 25 °C, a completely different colony pattern was observed; it was cottony, greyish then dark grey, and produced abundant hyaline conidia borne on grey, branching tree-like conidiophores. Conidia were one-celled and egg-shaped, and their dimensions fell in the range of 9. 89 – 14. 63 (11. 48 ± 0. 31) µm× 7. 05 – 10. 05 (8. 31 ± 0. 20) µm. These features concurred with those characterising the polyphagous grey mould fungus Botryotinia fuckeliana (anamorph: Botrytis cinerea) (Elad et al., 2007). The ITS 1 /ITS 2 including the 5. 8 S subunit of rDNA of one of the isolates were amplified with primers ITS 1 -F/ITS 4, then the PCR products were sequenced. The ITS sequence determined in this way was identical to known sequences of B. fuckeliana strains, e. g. that of CBS 131. 28 (GenBank accession number: KF 859918), the type material of Botrytis cinerea f. lini, DAOM 231372 (GenBank accession number: KF 859924) and so on. Pathogenicity tests resulted in rapidly (within 2 weeks) developing disease symptoms around the site of wound inoculation with a 5 -mm-diametre mycelial agar plug: fruit rot on apple and lemon in the laboratory, and sunken lesions on stems of hydrocultured ornamental plants such as the herbaceous Monstera deliciosa and the woody Dracena marginata. To fulfill Koch’s postulates, the fungus was re-isolated from symptomatic apple fruit, and was found to exhibit the afore-mentioned morpho-physiological characteristics. Inoculation test on Bucida was not performed because of the costly risk i. e., the sale price of the trees is € 3 to 10 thousand. Consequently, the actual sensitivity of Bucida to grey mould remains uncertain, so much the more because this plant species has not been recorded as a host of the pathogen or other important parasitic fungi in natural (subtropical) environment (e. g. Whelburg et al., 1975). To our knowledge, this report is the first description of Botryotinia fuckeliana on Bucida buceras. In addition to the fact that periodic emergence of fungal mycelia on the trunk impairs the tree’s aesthetic appearance, the sclerotia resting in the potting mix may cause more serious problems in the long term. However, it cannot be precluded that the elevated indoor temperature reduces disease progression and thus the economic importance of the pathogen on this plant...|$|R

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the relationship between}} salt tolerance and plant mineral status in celery (Apium graveolens L.) growth and the concentration of N, P, K, Ca, Na and Cl in different tissues were determined in plants grown in <b>hydroculture</b> with nutrient solutions containing 5 (control), 50, 100 and 300 mM NaCl for 4 weeks. At salinity levels of 50 and 100 mM NaCl there was a moderate, albeit significantly, reduction of growth, while a drastic decrease in both fresh and dry weight was found at 300 mM NaCl. Regardless of the salinity level, growth resumed promptly and completely once the stress was ceased. NaCl stress reduced the accumulation of nitrate-N in all plant tissues, {{but there were no}} relevant effects on the concentration of reduced N and P. The concentration of K in roots and leaf petioles was unaffected by NaCl treatment, but it gradually declined with increasing salinity in leaf blades; this reduction was less pronounced in the young leaves as compared to the mature ones. Increasing NaCl concentration decreased the concentration of Ca in all tissues, but it prevented the occurrence of black-heart, a typical Ca-related physiological disorder which affected severely the controls. Salt-stressed plants absorbed large amount of Na and Cl, which were accumulated in the mature leaves, particularly in the oldest leaves.

40|$|Purpose The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the indoor environmental quality benefits of plants in offices by undertaking trials using live plants. Methodology/Approach Using two offices in the same building, one with plants and one as a control, daily tests were undertaken for relative humidity, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Results were analysed to identify any differences between the office with plants and the one without. Findings Relative humidity increased following the introduction of plants and more significantly following additional <b>hydroculture</b> plants being installed, taking it to within the recommended range. Carbon dioxide was slightly higher in the planted office for the majority of the trial although there was an overall reduction in both offices. Carbon monoxide levels reduced with the introduction of plants and again with the additional plants. VOC levels were consistently lower in the non-planted office. Research Limitations It would be useful to extend this research in a greater range of buildings and with more flexible VOC monitoring equipment. Practical Implications This paper suggests that plants may provide an cost effective method of regulating the indoor environmental conditions within buildings. This can potentially lead to performance gains for the organisation and a reduction in instances of ill-health among the workforce.

Cultivars of Shiraz and Gascogen showed the highest and lowest root growth rates under normal while Azar 2 and Kavir showed the highest and lowest values under salt stress condition. Cultivars Shiraz and Azar 2 showed the highest and Kavir and Hirmand the lowest leaf growth rates under normal condition while under salt stress condition Mahdavi and Saison showed the highest and lowest values, respectively. Generally, growth rates were reduced under salt stress compared to the control condition. In another experiment, leaf samples were taken from 10 selected cultivars grown under the same stress condition and in all RWC and Na, K and Ca content were measured. Seedlings under salt stress condition had 34 % more Na, 25 % more Ca and 48 % more K/Na ratio while they had 29 % less RWC compared to the control condition. There were no significant correlations between growth rates and ion content. Meanwhile, cultivars with higher growth rates under control condition showed higher growth rates under stress condition. It was suggested that cultivars with higher growth rates under salt stress condition may be able to escape from the detrimental effects of saline top soils and produce more vigorous seedlings which may help them to have better yield performance under salt stress condition.

40|$|Lysobacter enzymogenes strain 3. 1 T 8 is a {{potential}} biocontrol agent of Pythium aphanidermatum (Edson) Fitzp. in cucumber (Cucumis sativa L.). It showed in vitro antagonistic activity, hemolytic activity, {{and the production of}} a surface active compound, which decreased in media of increasing strength. One or more low molecular compounds, present in culture filtrates of 3. 1 T 8, caused rapid immobilization of zoospores of P. aphanidermatum and inhibited cyst germination. Bioassays for suppression of root and crown rot were performed with 2 -week-old cucumber plants in nutrient solution. Complete disease suppression occurred after addition of a suspension of unwashed cells grown on nutrient-poor R 2 A, or the filtrate of this suspension, 1 day before inoculation with zoospores. Application of washed cells caused slight suppression in one of two bioassays only. No disease suppression occurred when bacterial inoculum grown on 1 / 10 TSBA or in 1 / 10 TSB was used. In two bioassays on cucumber plants grown for 4 – 5 weeks in 18 -L containers, application of R 2 A-grown cells of 3. 1 T 8 did not cause disease suppression. Density of 3. 1 T 8, monitored using immunofluorescence colony staining, decreased at least 100 -fold during these experiments to approximately log 3 – 4 cfu ml- 1 of nutrient solution and log 5 – 6 cfu g- 1 roots. Overall, the findings indicated a strong influence of nutritional resources on production of antifungal compounds by strain 3. 1 T 8.

40|$|The {{intake of}} {{contaminants}} through the human consumption of crops grown on contaminated land {{is one of}} the exposure routes in the standard calculation of the Dutch intervention values for soil remediation. This appeared to be a major exposure route in the standard calculation of potentential human risks of soil contamination with metals. This literature study focused on evaluating the estimation of the bioconcentration of contaminating metals in the crops growing on contaminated land. For this estimation of potential risks the subject was narrowed down to estimating average values of the bioconcentration factors (BCF) of metals in consumed parts of crops grown in home gardens and for various soil types, including standard soil. Data collected from the literature (n= 2260) were restricted to field data on existing contamination and excluded pot experiments, <b>hydroculture</b> and artificial contamination. BCF values were calculated for individual crops and an average consumption basket. For the calculation of intervention values, the BCF values had to be standardized to standard soil and soil concentrations near to the expected intervention values. To facilitate this standardization, a range of empirical relationships was calculated for variations in the BCF values of As, Cd, Cu, Hg, Ni, Pb and Zn with the parameters - soil concentration, soil acidity and percentages of organic carbon and silt in the soil. These relationships are also useful in a location specific actual risk analysis for a site with specific crops and known soiltype. The results of several calculation schemes were compared considering sometimes occurring uncertainties, like data not completely covering the required ranges of soil concentrations and soil type parameters.

40|$|Ferrous iron (Fe 2 +) {{toxicity}} {{is one of}} {{the major}} constraints to lowland rice production. It disrupts the rice plant physiology in several respects. The critical iron toxicity concentration in plant tissue depends partly on the overall nutritional status of the plant. African cultivars are generally less sensitive to this stress than Asian ones, but their yield potential is significantly lower. Interspecific hybridization between African and Asian rices is considered a possible solution to iron toxicity in lowland rice production. The objective of this work was to study the influence of high applied ferrous iron concentrations on the growth and mineral composition of the tissue of an interspecific rice, Oryza sativa L. x Oryza glaberrima Steud. Experiments were performed in hydroponics by applying different ferrous iron concentrations (0, 125, 250, and 500 mg L- 1 Fe 2 +) to an interspecific rice line at two different plant ages. Iron toxicity conditions and symptom development were achieved in a <b>hydroculture</b> system provided with a frequent adjustment of pH, oxygen content, associated iron redox state, and iron availability in the nutrient solution. Symptoms (bronzing, as well as reduction in plant growth and survival rate) appeared at and above 250 mg L- 1 applied Fe 2 + after 4 weeks of iron-toxicity stress. The hybrid line did not show iron toxicity symptoms at 125 mg L- 1 Fe 2 +, despite an iron concentration in its leaves (3356 mg kg(- 1)) well above the usual critical toxicity concentration in rice (700 mg kg(- 1)). The mineral elements were classified into three groups according to their concentration in the tissue under the different applied ferrous iron concentrations. In Group I [phosphorus (P), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), copper (Cu), manganese (Mn), molybdenum (Mo), and zinc (Zn) ], the concentrations were always the lowest at 125, intermediate at 250, and highest at 0 or 500 mg L- 1 applied Fe 2 +. In Group II [iron (Fe) and sodium (Na) ], the concentrations increased with ferrous iron applications. In Group III [nitrogen (N) and potassium (K) ], the concentrations did not vary significantly with applied ferrous iron. However, the concentrations of all mineral elements, except iron, were maintained between their critical deficiency and toxicity limits. This property may have contributed to the tolerance - at 125 mg L- 1 applied Fe 2 + - of the present line to leaf iron concentrations generally considered toxic to rice. Varietal screenings to evaluate of the resistance to ferrous iron toxicity will be performed in accordance with the results of the present study: after 4 weeks of iron-stress, at 250 mg L- 1 applied Fe 2 + and at the youngest tested age of stress application...|$|E
40|$|Hydroponic {{production}} was initially explored {{as an alternative}} to field production due to the ease of plant growth control and the hopes of preventing the majority of disease causing agents known to be present in general soil environments. Of primary concern in terms of pathogens are the water-borne and water-motile zoosporic fungi (especially Pythium spp.) which are able to spread easily throughout the system and cause root-rot and wilting. Few pesticides are currently registered for use in hydroponic systems due to the high costs of registration, while registered pesticides carry a high cost to the grower. Recent legislative moves by numerous countries are also resulting in a trend towards the re-use of hydroponic nutrient solution. As a result such hydroponic solutions require a greater level of disinfection to prevent disease outbreaks but without resulting in chemical buildup of phytotoxic and environmental concern. Sanitiser formulation has seen significant changes {{over the last few years}} resulting in sanitisers being used in many new areas and in a more environmentally friendly nature. Although sanitisers are not designed to have specific action against micro-organisms (as is the case with fungicides and anti-microbial agents such as antibiotics), most sanitisers are able to act on cell membranes due to the inherent surfactant properties. This study attempted to determine the suitability of various sanitisers and chemicals as alternate means of control of Pythium in recirculating gravel hydroponic systems by: 1). Exposing Pythium zoospores in a water suspension to the sanitisers Actsol®, Agral 90 ®, Fitosan®, Prasin®, Purogene®, TecsaClor®, Sporekill® and copper (as copper (I) sulphate) which all managed to eliminate 80 % or more of the viable inoculum within a 10 minute exposure time at relatively low concentrations. 2). Testing the above sanitisers for phytotoxicity effects on cucumber plants in a static <b>hydroculture</b> system under laboratory conditions and lettuce plants in a gravel bed hydroponic system under greenhouse conditions. Purogene® and TecsaClor® exhibited a slight growth promotion effect at low concentrations, yet still caused negative phytotoxic effects when dosed at high concentrations. All other sanitisers exhibited some measure of phytotoxicity, observed as growth retardation and leaf discolouration, with phytotoxic effects increasing with increasing concentrations. Copper sulphate was found to be the most phytotoxic chemical tested. 3). Addition of the sanitisers to a small scale hydroponic system (greenhouse), as well as to a semi-commercial scale (field) gravel bed hydroponic system artificially infested with Pythium and cultivated with lettuce. The sanitisers were also compared to a commercially available fungicide, Phytex®. Only Phytex® and Purogene® managed to effectively reduce disease incidence and promote growth over an untreated, Pythium infested control. The results indicated that Purogene® was the most effective for application into a gravel bed hydroponic system cultivated with lettuce, while no sanitiser treatment was able to equal the improved growth and disease control recorded with treatment of the commercial fungicide Phytex®. Although all the sanitisers were able to reduce levels of Pythium inoculum in the hydroponic nutrient solution, this beneficial effect did not translate into increased yields, due to the growth retardation due to phytotoxic effects.

In Part I, in one long term experiment, the effect of 17 root systems on plant behaviour of the scion cultivar Rosa 'Varlon' grown in soil without supplementary lighting was studied for three years under conditions of relatively low greenhouse temperatures. It became clear that the root system influenced the building up of the rose bush, and that this particularly took place during the first year after planting. Considering only the plants propagated by stenting, the number of bottom-breaks for R. 'Varlon' plants varied between 1. 5 for R. 'Motrea' and 2. 3 per plant for R. indica 'Major'. About 90 % of all the bottom-breaks were formed in the initial months after planting. The quality of these bottom- breaks, e. g. the diameter at the time they were harvested, was 15 percent higher for the best rootstock, R. 'Mme Alfred Carrière', compared with the least, R. 'Paul's Lemmon Pillar'. The percentage of secondary thickening of bottom-breaks after three years varied somewhat per rootstock and was on average about 20 %. Eventually, the difference between rootstocks with respect to bottom-break diameter was about the same as obtained during their harvest. After three years it became apparent that plants on R. 'Moonlight' produced the highest number of branches per bottom-break, i. e. 2. 4, whereas the bottom-breaks of R. zigrii had only 1. 4 laterals. The diameter of these laterals varied from 10. 2 mm for plants on R. 'Fredica' to 8. 6 mm. for plants on R. 'Paul's Lemmon Pillar'. The number of shoots at 60 cm above ground level and exceeding 0. 5 cm, diameter, the socalled structural shoots, was 6. 6 per plant for R. 'Moonlight', which means that it exceeded the least R. zigrii by 60 %. This means that the same tendency was found here as was noticed for the number of branches per bottom-break. It became clear that competition existed between the number of structural shoots per plant; the more shoots produced, the more eventually died off. The diameter of the structural shoots reached a maximum when grown on R. 'Mine Alfred Carrière' and a minimum when grown on R. 'Paul's Lemmon Pillar'. This result is comparable with that found for the diameter of the bottom-breaks. The method of propagation proved to be an important factor with respect to the building up of the plant; the plants bench grafted on R. canina 'Inermis' produced the highest total number of bottom-breaks but their diameter, secondary thickening and weight remained behind all the other rootstocks including the root-grafted R. canina 'Inermis' plants. In the same R. 'Varlon' experiment differences of more than 100 % between rootstocks, irrespective of the method of propagation, were found for the period with the lowest production, i. e. winter. The differences between rootstocks in average production per year was less (about 60 %). The highest production was found for R. 'Varlon' on its own roots and R. indica 'Major', the lowest for both R. canina types, irrespective of the method of propagation, and R. zigrii. Further, it proved that some of the rootstocks exceeded others during the whole year, whereas some diverged only in some periods. The high production of R. 'Varlon' might be related to the abscence of the graft union. The number of axillary buds per plant and the number of released buds, but also the readiness to break out and, thereafter, the time required to develop a harvestable flower, are important factors in determining the total amount of flowers produced. In this study it was shown that the differences found in bud break between rootstocks during the year explained, at least partly, the differences found in production between rootstocks and between the seasons of the year. Also, flower stem development after axillary bud break proved to be dependent on rootstock. The importance of the presence of the subtending leaf and the diameter of the parent shoot depends on the chosen rootstock. This in turn depends on the method of carbohydrate supply (from actual photosynthesis or from storage) for the release of the bud and the development of the young shoot. The effect of rootstock on production (number of flowers) {{as well as on the}} quality of the harvested flower (length and weight) was more pronounced in winter than it was in summer. The quality parameters used were well correlated. However, the flower stem length was less influenced by season than flower weight. Finally, using the data from the long term R. 'Varlon' experiment, production and quality were quantified by linear regression models, using the plant development parameters, irrespective of the rootstock, as regressors. Production as well as quality was (partly) explained, for each season, by the transverse sections of the branches of the bottom-breaks. The number of bottombreaks was less important for production, even less than the number of their laterals; the former parameter is only of importance for production in spring and summer. The importance of the transverse sections is probably due to their role in the storage of reserves and transport capacity. Therefore, easiness of bud break and the time required for flower development is better when emerging from thick parent shoots. This is especially emphasized by the more pronounced role of the transverse section of the shoot for production in winter and for production by older bushes. It was suggested, when comparing the data concerning bush development parameters at the start and after three years, that the development of the plant in the first six months after planting was important for the building up of the rose bush and therefore for production and quality throughout its whole life. In Part II, examination of the plant's root system revealed that root fresh weight for the root systems used as rootstock for R. 'Varlon' differed markedly after three years. The root system of R. 'Mme Alfred Carrière' had 40 % less weight compared with R. 'Moonlight'. Further, some evidence was found to suggest that propagation technique may play a role in root characteristics, such as root number and average root length. In this study, the shoot-root ratio of young rose plants (younger than one year), varied between three and six and proved to depend on growing technique, environmental factors and the combination of rootstock and scion cultivar used. With progressing plant age shoot-root ratio increased to 10 - 15 for three years old plants. It can be stated that the mutual influence of shoot and root, with respect to partitioning of assimilates between shoot and root, depends on the combination and can be influenced by climatic conditions, plant age and growing technique. For R. 'Varlon' grown on different root systems, a close relationship was found to exist between the plant's shoot-root ratio after three years and the ratio between total flower weight produced over three years and final root weight. It was suggested that a fixed share of assimilates of the upper parts is used for flower formation irrespective of the root genotype used. From several experiments it became clear that disturbance of the balance between shoot and root, either by shoot or root pruning, was followed by a re-establishment of the original shootroot ratio. This is achieved independently of the scion-rootstock combination used, or the age of the plant. When frequently repeated intervention was carried out by removing upper parts, the shoot- root ratio reached a new stable balance but at a lower level. It was suggested that in this case storage of reserves was taken over by the roots. In experiments with rooted leaf cuttings it was found that a surplus of assimilates can be reflected in a higher root mass. On the other hand, it was also found that a higher root mass can indicate that the sink activity and/or storage capacity of the root is higher. The amount of carbohydrates stored in the roots of a rose plant during the year is related to the development of the shoot and root and the photosynthetic activity of the leaves. It was shown that apart from the time of year the combination of scion and rootstock used also had a prominent effect. With respect to the storage of carbohydrates in rose roots, it became clear that rootstocks originating from 'winter active' plants, such as R. multiflora 'Multic' and R. indica 'Major' showed a less pronounced variation during winter, compared with the originally hardier ones such as the R. canina types. Further, aspects such as the difference in storage capacity, sink activity, redistribution and climatic factors may play a role in the storage of carbohydrates in roots. Root growth was related to the presence of leaves. Consequently the removal of leaves by harvesting flower stems or other methods of shoot pruning, resulted in inhibited root growth within one or two weeks. Additionally, root mortality may occur depending on the severity of pruning. The extent of root mortality proved to be dependent to some degree on the rootstockused. Their susceptibility to root mortality depended on the amount of carbohydrates stored, internal competition between roots and shoot-root competition. After root mortality the best root regeneration was observed when more carbohydrates were available. This means that a root system with a higher storage capacity (i. e. mostly thicker roots), plants with more leaves, plants grown under a higher light intensity, or plants treated with supplementary sucrose, showed better root regeneration. Stimulating the root's sink activity by application of auxin improved root regeneration too. The optimal concentration of auxin (IBA) applied for root regeneration was dependent on the temperature used for plant growth. With respect to temperature, root regeneration was optimal around 17 °C. Root growth of R. canina 'Inermis' plants grown in peat was not limited between pH values 4 to 8. Root growth for plants grown on <b>hydroculture</b> was optimal when pH was about 6. Dormant plants only remained inactive at a pH of 3. 5 or lower, but young active roots disintegrated within a few hours at this pH value. Bud release was inhibited at pH levels that hampered root growth, probably because production of cytokinin remained behind. Reduced root growth during a short period or to a relatively low extent was not necessarily damaging for the plant. In fact, shoot growth was enhanced when root mass was decreased temporarily by removing root ends. The emergence after a while of a higher number of root apices, suggested that the imroved shoot growth was due to a higher production of cytokinin. A more pronounced reduction of root growth led to less shoot development, more water stress and a higher susceptibility to disease. In conclusion, it may be said that the whole life of a rose plant and therefore also flower production and quality, is influenced by competition between upper parts and roots. Good development requires not only an adequate assimilating system but also good storage and redistribution capabilities. Storage capacity is of especial importance during unfavourable conditions. For optimal production throughout the year, the roots should be active and after mortality, a quick recovery is required to ensure the correct balance between shoot and root. In this respect the behaviour of the rootstock plays an important role. Therefore, new scion cultivars should be assessed when growing on rootstocks which have adapted properly to the grower's method of plant management and his growing conditions. Cultivars for year round production for instance should never be tested on R. canina selections, due to their poor winter activity. For the correct balance between shoot and root, plant management should he carried out in dependence of climatic conditions, rooting medium, scion and rootstock combination and plant condition itself. The requirements for the ideal rootstock as well as for the ideal scion cultivar are tremendous. Therefore, it is more practical to select rootstock and scion cultivars in separate programmes. Finally, the most suitable combination for a certain situation could then be combined by grafting...|$|E
