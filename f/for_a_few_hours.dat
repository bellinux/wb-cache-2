50|$|From the 1980s, the BBC {{planned to}} {{broadcast}} <b>for</b> only <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hours</b> <b>a</b> day and <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> minutes each <b>hour,</b> the intention being to conserve the batteries in domestic radios. There {{was to be}} no entertainment content for this reason and so that official messages could get through. With {{the end of the}} Cold War, the BBC deactivated the studios and emergency transmitter networks in 1993 as surplus to requirements. Many of these studios have become exhibits in bunkers, like the Kelvedon Hatch Secret Nuclear Bunker, which have now been converted into museums.|$|R

5|$|About 75% of {{the island}} chain lost power <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hours</b> during the storm. Damage {{occurred}} to downed trees and wooden homes. Between 13 and 17percent of the non-native Australian pine on San Salvador Island experienced damage, primarily from snapping, though some browning from salt spray was noted. Several feet of water flooded the international airport at Freeport.|$|E
5|$|Most bovids {{alternately}} {{feed and}} ruminate throughout the day. While those that feed on concentrates feed and digest in short intervals, the roughage feeders take longer intervals. Only small {{species such as}} the duiker browse <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hours</b> during day or night. Feeding habits are related to body size; while small bovids forage in dense and closed habitat, larger species feed upon high-fiber vegetation in open grasslands.|$|E
5|$|On January 20, 1843, {{members of}} the Spanish Armed Forces' Tayabas Regiment {{stationed}} in Manila, led by Sergeant Irineo Samaniego, rose in mutiny {{in retaliation for the}} November 1841 massacre of the cofradía members. They managed to capture Fort Santiago and held it <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hours,</b> but were defeated the next day. Eighty-two mutineers were immediately executed on Bagumbayan Field, while the rest were imprisoned.|$|E

The websites for the Bank of Portugal, the Assembly of the Republic, and the Ministry of Economy, Innovation and Development all became unavailable <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hours.</b>|$|E
5|$|Snow in {{the city}} is so rare {{that it has been}} {{observed}} only five times in the century-and-a-half that records have been kept. In 1949 and 1967, snow stayed on the ground <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hours</b> in higher locations like Point Loma and La Jolla. The other three occasions, in 1882, 1946, and 1987, involved flurries but no accumulation.|$|E

5|$|Although he {{appeared}} to be an unlikely candidate on account of his age and weak health, Nerva was considered a safe choice precisely because he was old and childless. Furthermore, he had close connections with the Flavian dynasty and commanded the respect of a substantial part of the Senate. Nerva had seen the anarchy which had resulted from the death of Nero; he knew that to hesitate even <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hours</b> could lead to violent civil conflict. Rather than decline the invitation and risk revolts, he accepted. The decision may have been hasty so as to avoid civil war, but neither the Senate nor Nerva appears to {{have been involved in the}} conspiracy against Domitian.|$|E
5|$|Another novel {{aspect of}} the {{offensive}} used by the attackers, which was extensively commented upon by American journalist Timothy Turner who was observing the battle from El Paso, was the rotation of troops that the rebels employed. Rather than attacking en masse with the whole army, Villa and Orozco had their soldiers engage the enemy <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hours,</b> {{then go back to}} secure positions to sleep, while other rebels took their place. As a consequence the rebel troops were always rested while the less numerous defending federal troops were forced to remain sleepless and ever vigilant.|$|E
5|$|Fried {{butter is}} a similar dish, for which recipes exist dating to the 17th century. The first known recipe for fried butter dates to 1615. Fried butter was {{documented}} in the cookbook The Art of Cookery Made Plain and Easy in 1747. The recipe entailed soaking butter in salted water <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hours,</b> placing it on a rotisserie ("spit it"), covering it with breadcrumbs and nutmeg, and roasting it under a low fire while continuously covering it with egg yolks and additional bread crumbs. Oysters were recommended to accompany the dish.|$|E
5000|$|A {{more recent}} use, applied {{to members of}} the {{legislative}} branch, means [...] "read the fucking bill". It is a reaction to the practice of passing massive legislation where the final bill is available <b>for</b> only <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hours</b> before it is voted upon.|$|R
5000|$|... 'Takatalvi' is a Finnish word {{literally}} meaning [...] "backwinter", i.e. a {{cold spell}} in the spring.

25|$|In Lima, 93% of {{households}} {{have access to}} water supply in their homes. In addition, 92% of homes connect with sewage systems. 99.6% of homes have grid electric service.

5|$|Heavy {{rainfall}} in Shanghai flooded 84city streets; in some locations insufficient {{water drainage}} left homes and apartments flooded, {{with a total}} of 20,000houses reporting flooding. The flooding also closed the city subway system <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hours.</b> Strong winds downed 2,700 trees and 400 power lines in the city. The typhoon damaged a construction site in the city, leaving three injured and one person killed. Throughout the city an estimated 15,000houses were destroyed. Additionally, four people were electrocuted {{as a result of the}} flooding. In Shanghai alone, damage totaled $1.33billion (2005CNY, $164.5million 2005USD); seven people died in the city.|$|E
5|$|In the wild, {{little brown}} bats {{can be very}} active during {{the day in the}} spring months, where they can be heard loudly squeaking, {{shuffling}} position and seen hanging out the bottom of the bat house during all hours of the daytime. The average sleep time of a little brown bat in captivity is said to be 19.9 hours per day. This long period of sleep is thought to be a way of conserving energy, by only hunting <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hours</b> each night when their insect prey are available.|$|E
5|$|Okapis are {{primarily}} diurnal {{but may be}} active <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hours</b> in darkness. They are essentially solitary, coming together only to breed. Okapis are herbivores, feeding on tree leaves and buds, grasses, ferns, fruits, and fungi. Rut in males and estrus in females {{does not depend on}} the season. In captivity, estrous cycles recur every 15 days. The gestational period is around 440 to 450 days long, following which usually a single calf is born. The juveniles are kept in hiding, and nursing takes place infrequently. Juveniles start taking solid food from three months, and weaning takes place at six months.|$|E

50|$|Sauromatum is a genus of {{flowering}} {{plants in the}} family Araceae. The genus is native to tropical Africa, tropical Asia, and the Arabian Peninsula.
