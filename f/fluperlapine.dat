50|$|<b>Fluperlapine</b> (NB 106-689), {{also known}} as fluoroperlapine, is a morphanthridine (11H-dibenzob,eazepine) {{atypical}} antipsychotic with additional antidepressant and sedative effects. It was first synthesized in 1979, and then subsequently studied in animals and humans in 1984 and beyond, but despite demonstrating efficacy {{in the treatment of}} a variety of medical conditions including schizophrenia, psychosis associated with Parkinson's disease, depressive symptoms, and dystonia, it was never marketed.This was perhaps due to its capacity for producing potentially life-threatening agranulocytosis, similarly to clozapine, which it closely resembles both structurally and pharmacologically.|$|E
40|$|According to {{a recent}} {{hypothesis}} suggesting the potential role of free radical formation in the clozapine-induced agranulocytosis, we have evaluated the susceptibility to the peroxidase-mediated oxidation of different dibenzazepine analogues. On the one hand, compounds with an arylamine group such as clozapine or isoclozapine present a high reactivity in the horseradish peroxidase or myeloperoxidase systems and, on the other hand, <b>fluperlapine,</b> though known to induce agranulocytosis, and other dibenzothiazepine and dibenzoxazepine derivatives appear insensitive to oxidation. Consequently, among tricyclic derivatives, the way of diaryloxa- and diarylthiazepine compounds could be an alternative {{for the development of}} safer drugs such as antipsychotics.

40|$|The {{effects of}} D- 2 {{dopamine}} (DA) receptor blockade were mod ulated by ICI 169, 369, a selective 5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 -HTh receptor antagonist, and by other 5 -HT 2 antagonists. Specifically, {{it appears that}} blockade of 5 -HT 2 receptors can attenuate the effects of D- 2 receptor blockade on rat stnatal dopaminergic transmission. Thus, the blockade of D- 2 receptors by halopendol results in a compensatory increase in rat stnatal DA metabolism, which is enhanced by lCl 169, 369. By itself, ICI 169, 369 did not significantly alter DA metabolism. Conversely, several corn pounds which possess appreciable activity at 5 -HT 2 sites in ex vivo binding assays, but possess little activity at D- 2 sites (i. e., pirenperone, setoperone, <b>fluperlapine</b> and clozapine), all pro duced large increases in striatal DA metabolism. Therefore, {{these data suggest that}} the 5 -HT 2 component of these compounds...|$|E
40|$|Some {{antipsychotic}} {{agents have}} been found to produce agranulocytosis and aplastic anemia. The oxidation phenomena and/or the formation of free radicals has been suggested to be causally related to various hematological disorders, e. g. agranulocytosis. Using five experimental conditions, we tested the oxidative potential of compounds with and without a history of hematological side effects, e. g. agranulocytosis and aplastic anemia. A statistical analysis was undertaken for each experimental condition and a multivariate analysis combining all results was performed. Two peroxidase-induced free radical models did not successfully discriminate between drugs with and without a history of causing hematologic problems (< 70 %). The lipid peroxidation system provided even less satisfactory discrimination, with only 56. 25 % correct classification. However, an 87. 5 % correct classification was obtained when using the oxidation potentials of these drugs determined at pH 4. 7 and at pH 7. 4. A multivariate analysis taking into account the five variables provided 87. 5 % success in classification. The two clusters were better discriminated in terms of a "distance coefficient. " In a second analysis, the putative antipsychotic pyridobenzodiazepine analogues (JL 5, JL 8, JL 18, and JL 25) were classified in the cluster of toxic compounds, while the oxa- and thiazepine analogues (JL 2, JL 3, and JL 13) were classified as nontoxic compounds. On the other hand, a few metabolites of clozapine and <b>fluperlapine</b> were classified in the toxic compound group. The procedure described herein is, to our knowledge, the first which classifies molecules of different structures as well as different pharmacological profiles according to their hematotoxic potential. Such a procedure could be used to predict drug-induced hematological side effects. Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U. S. Gov'tinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
