Kohlberg has responded by saying that although <b>different</b> <b>cultures</b> do indeed inculcate different beliefs, his stages correspond to underlying modes of reasoning, rather than to those beliefs.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In this study, {{the effect}} of <b>different</b> <b>culture</b> media on the {{germination}} times of basidiospores and mycelium growth rates which belongs to Lentinula edodes was tried to determine. For this purpose basidiospores were obtained from three fruit bodies and they were transferred on to four different agar media. All basidiospores in the four <b>different</b> <b>culture</b> media were successfully germinated in 5 - 10 days. Germination time in water agar medium {{was found to be}} one or two days longer than other three culture media. Germinated spores in <b>different</b> <b>culture</b> media were transferred on to Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA) medium to examine mycelial growth rates. Mycelial growth rates were measured on 15 th and 21 st days. Isolates obtained from potato dextrose agar medium showed faster growth rate than others...|$|R

5|$|Artists in {{the eighteenth}} century (e.g., Henry Fuseli, William Rimmer) {{depicted}} the witches variously, as have many directors since. Some have exaggerated or sensationalised the hags, or have adapted them to <b>different</b> <b>cultures,</b> as in Orson Welles's rendition of the weird sisters as voodoo priestesses. Some film adaptations have cast the witches as such modern analogues as hippies on drugs, or goth schoolgirls. Their influence reaches the literary realm as well in such works as the Discworld and Harry Potter series.|$|E
5|$|For {{thousands}} of years, {{the capital of}} Egypt was moved with <b>different</b> <b>cultures</b> through multiple locations {{up and down the}} Nile, such as Thebes and Memphis, depending on which dynasty was in power. After Alexander the Great conquered Egypt around 331 BC, the capital became the city named for him, Alexandria, on the Mediterranean coast. This situation remained stable for nearly a thousand years. After the army of the Arabian Caliph Umar captured the region in the 7th century, shortly after the death of Muhammad, he wanted to establish a new capital. When Alexandria fell in September 641, Amr ibn al-As, the commander of the conquering army, founded a new capital on the eastern bank of the river.|$|E

Published in four parts by F. S. Ellis, it soon gained a cult following and established Morris' reputation as a major poet.|$|E
