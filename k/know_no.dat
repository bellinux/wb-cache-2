25|$|Aristotle criticises the Spartans in his Politics: the helots keep rebelling; the Spartan {{women are}} luxurious; the magistrates (and {{especially}} the ephors) are irresponsible; reaching decisions by the loudest yell in the apella is silly; {{the wealth of}} the citizens is unequal (so that too many are losing the resources necessary to be a citizen and a hoplite); and the Spartiates let each other evade taxes, so the city is poor and the individual citizens are greedy. Above all, the Spartans <b>know</b> <b>no</b> other arts than war, so in peace they are incompetent and corrupt. The Cretan institutions, he says, are even worse.|$|E
25|$|Taz is {{generally}} {{portrayed as a}} ferocious, albeit dim-witted, omnivore with a notoriously short temper and little patience. Though he can be very devious, he is also sweet at times. His enormous appetite seems to <b>know</b> <b>no</b> bounds, as he will eat anything in his path. He {{is best known for}} his speech consisting mostly of grunts, growls, and rasps (in his earlier appearances, he does speak English with primitive grammar) as well as his ability to spin like a vortex and bite through nearly anything. Taz does have one weakness: he can be calmed by almost any music. While in this calm state, he can be easily dealt with.|$|E

Being a large man, {{accustomed}} to much elbow-room and rapid motion, and the house being small, John may be said to have been a dangerous character in the family on such occasions. Apart from baby, no elephant was ever more sluggish in his motions; but when coupled--professionally speaking--to his own tender infant, John <b>knew</b> <b>no</b> bounds, his wife <b>knew</b> <b>no</b> rest and his baby <b>knew</b> <b>no</b> higher earthly bliss.|$|R

I don't know him!" [...] He slams the door in Landis' face and then bursts {{out of the garage}} in a car.

500|$|Yorck was {{launched}} on 14 May 1904, and commissioned into the German navy on 21 November 1905. At the commissioning Field Marshal Wilhelm von Hahnke spoke, saying, [...] "old wisdom, si vis pacem, para bellum—he who wants peace shall {{be prepared for}} war...may the guns and machines of the Yorck be operated only by men with iron hearts and an iron will, men who <b>know</b> <b>no</b> other order than to put their lives at risk when the might, the greatness and honor of the German people are being fought for." [...] After her commissioning, Yorck served with the fleet in the cruiser squadron. In 19081909, Erich Raeder served aboard the ship as Yorcks navigation officer. From 1 October 1911 to 26 January 1912, Franz von Hipper, later commander-in-chief of the German navy, served as the ship's commanding officer.|$|E

500|$|The Puritan {{leaders of}} the Massachusetts Bay Colony gloated over Hutchinson's {{suffering}} and also that of Mary Dyer, a follower who suffered the premature and stillbirth of a severely deformed infant. The leaders classified the women's misfortunes as the judgement of God. [...] Winthrop wrote, [...] "She brought forth not one, but thirty monstrous births or thereabouts", then continued, [...] "see how the wisdom of God fitted this judgment to her sin every way, for look—as she had vented misshapen opinions, so she must bring forth deformed monsters." [...] Massachusetts continued to persecute Hutchinson's followers who stayed in the Boston area. Laymen were sent from the Boston church to Portsmouth to convince Hutchinson of her errors; she shouted at them, [...] "the Church at Boston? I <b>know</b> <b>no</b> such church, neither will I own it. Call it the whore and strumpet of Boston, but no Church of Christ!" ...|$|E
500|$|Various plotlines leaked {{before the}} episode's release, {{the most notable}} being {{the death of the}} Lone Gunmen. The choice to kill off the trio was controversial; Gilligan himself later {{admitted}} that [...] "I still think we made the wrong choice on that one." [...] Spotnitz later said, [...] "I can't say I regret killing them off, as you <b>know,</b> <b>no</b> one really dies in The X-Files [...] But I do feel tonally {{it was a mistake to}} end the episode on such a somber note. I wish we'd ended it on a laugh or smile." [...] The actors who played The Lone Gunmen complimented the script. Harwood admitted that the episode would have either featured the trio's death or would have featured them [...] "walk off into the sunset without hobo bags over our shoulders." [...] Ultimately, he concluded that [...] "I was glad we were killed off in the end". Dean Haglund said that he [...] "liked the way we were sent off", and called the ending [...] "cool".|$|E
500|$|Rain in England {{has been}} {{repeatedly}} referenced for its uniqueness and its demonstration of Lil B's {{broad range of}} styles. Hip hop writer Andrew Nosnitsky remarked in The Wire that Lil B was likely the only rapper who could pull off both an ambient release on Weird Forest and a collaboration with Soulja Boy in the same year. The San Francisco Bay Guardian said the album demonstrated Lil B's unpredictability; similarly, SF Weekly called it [...] "a different beast entirely" [...] {{from the rest of}} his work. In Seattle Weekly, Eric Grandy called Rain in England an [...] "oddity" [...] and said Lil B's music is better served by randomly listening to him on YouTube then in a long-form album format. In a 2012 profile of Lil B's career so far, The Wires Lisa Blanning said the album [...] "feels like a new musical expression." [...] Lil B himself described Rain in England as [...] "my favorite work ... I think that's my most powerful work, to myself. ... That's my favorite, because I <b>know</b> <b>no</b> one else has done that, and that's what I'm most proud of, when I do things that I know nobody else has done before." ...|$|E

500|$|The fourth song [...] "T-Shirt" [...] is {{complete}} with inorganic drum sounds, guitar and backwards loop as the trio sings about sleeping {{in bed with}} their man's T-shirt, [...] "craving his presence, and inhailing his scent". [...] "Is She the Reason" [...] is an R ballad which was noted to have a similar chord progression to materials by The Beatles, which lyrically speaks on being in competition with another woman for her mans love & attention. It contains a trumpet-laden sample from Melba Moore's song [...] "I Don't <b>Know</b> <b>No</b> One Else to Turn To". The next song, [...] "Girl" [...] was noted for its Motown influence and a theme talking about friendship. [...] "If", complete with strings, lyrically talks about men who don't appreciate their female lovers until their relationship ends and they realize their mistakes. [...] "Free" [...] {{was described as a}} [...] "soul classic from 1975" [...] with critics also noting elements of 1970s funk music, as the trio speaks on being [...] "set free" [...] after being in a relationship where her lover never tending to her desires like she does for him. The midtempo number [...] "Through with Love" [...] was noted for having an [...] "angry" [...] nature as it talks about a break-up. It contains an undulating piano line as the members of the group sing with restrained vocals and later religious redemption with elements of gospel. In [...] "Love", [...] "capital L kicks the daylights out of the forces of fear, doubt and disappointment", as the group [...] "thank God for love". They further sing about how people [...] "can't truly love another until [...] love God and then [...] ". They further proclaim that they have found love and are [...] "madly in it".|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} {{version of the}} tour was acclaimed by critics. Jane Stevenson from Toronto Sun gave the concert {{four out of five}} stars and said that Lady Gaga came across as a [...] "confident, colourful, and campy performer. [...] Gaga's success was evident with slick-looking videos, lights, elaborate costumes, dancers, and yes, a band, even if her stage was sometimes left dark as she left to make numerous changes." [...] T'Cha Dunlevy for The Gazette noted that the performance was lacking—adding that the show never reached its peak until the end, when Gaga performed the [...] "real rendition" [...] of [...] "Poker Face" [...] and [...] "Bad Romance." [...] "Better late than never", Dunlevy concluded. Aedan Helmer from Jam! magazine said that [...] "At first blush, it might seem the real driving force behind Gaga's meteoric rise to fame is her hand-picked cadre of costume and set designers—dubbed Haus of Gaga—who seemingly <b>know</b> <b>no</b> bounds when it comes to pushing the envelope of haute couture and the theatre of the absurd. [...] But what really sets Gaga apart from the middling masses of lip-synching Britney clones and Idol wannabes is her pure, unadulterated musical talent. [...] The Lady can sing." [...] Theatre critic Kelly Nestruck, while writing for The Guardian, said [...] "While The Monster Ball has nothing on the great operas or the golden age of musical theatre, Lady Gaga's 'electro-pop opera' is at least twice as entertaining and infinitely fresher than any stage musical written over the last decade." [...] Lauren Carter from Boston Herald praised the show saying [...] " [...] only has two albums under her belt but who cares? Every song feels like a hit, and Gaga-as-star is already taking on Madonna-like proportions. [...] After [...] at the Wang Theater, fans could justifiably walk away thinking Lady Gaga is crazy, brilliant or both." [...] Jeremy Adams from Rolling Stone reviewed the performance at Wang Center in Boston and said that [...] "Throughout the evening, Gaga [...] aimed for a kind of pop theatricality that might potentially cement her burgeoning status as performance artist." ...|$|E
