An ethernet cable connects the relay feeder and access units. The isolation between the relay feeder and access for 1 m separation at the measurement site and with additional shielding was only about 20 dB. Because of this low isolation, orthogonalization between the two relay units is needed. A simple relay time split strategy was employed for this purpose.

40|$|Background: Code cloning - copying and reusing {{pieces of}} source code - {{is a common}} {{phenomenon}} in software development in practice. There have been several empirical studies {{on the effects of}} cloning, but there are contradictory results regarding the connection of cloning and faults. Objective: Our aim is to clarify the relationship between code clones and faults. In particular, we focus on inconsistent (or type- 3) clones in this work. Method: We conducted a case study with TWT GmbH where we detected the code clones in three Java systems, set them into relation to information from issue tracking and version control and interviewed three key developers. Results: Of the type- 3 clones, 17 % contain faults. Developers modified most of the type- 3 clones simultaneously and thereby <b>fixed</b> <b>half</b> of the faults in type- 3 clones consistently. Type- 2 clones with faults all evolved to fixed type- 3 clones. Clone length is only weakly correlated with faultiness. Conclusion: There are indications that the developers in two cases have been aware of clones. It might be a reason for the weak relationship between type- 3 clones and faults. Hence, it seems important to keep developers aware of clones, potentially with new tool support. Future studies need to investigate if the rate of faults in type- 3 clones justifies using them as cues in defect detection. Comment: 11 pages, 0 figure...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Dies for {{aluminium}} alloys die-casting fail {{because of a}} great number of a different and simultaneously operating factors.

Design/methodology/approach: In the experimental part of our work the failures on the working surface of the <b>fixed</b> <b>half</b> of the testing die for die-casting of {{aluminium alloys}} were observed with the use of non-destructive testing methods: such as thermographic analysis, penetrants, and metallographic examination of polymeric replicas. Findings: In the process of the die-casting the primary source of loading is cyclic variation of the temperature; the influence of other loads is relatively insignificant. Research limitations/implications: For economical production of aluminium and aluminium alloys die-castings {{it is important that the}} dies have a long working life. The replacement of a die is expensive in both: money and production time. Practical implications: Beside, the die design, the material selection and the process thermal stress fatigue course, which is the consequence of the working conditions, the inhomogeneous and to low initial temperature of the die, contribute to the cracks formation. Originality/value: It is clearly seen from the presented thermographs, that the required temperatures and homogeneity of the temperature field of the discussed case are not possible to reach without the changing both: the heating method and the die design. Therefore in the first stage a solution of the problem should be in changing of the position of heating and/or cooling channels, i. e. their closer shifting to the working surface of the die...|$|E

Rectangular spiral is printed on a finite sized dielectric substrate (εr= 3. 27) backed by a finite-sized conducting plane. Rectangular spiral radiates in Right Handed Circular Polarization (RHCP). Horizontal spiral arm length (HL) is varied from HL= 0. 8 λo to HL= 5. 2 λo to choose the length that yields the proper axial ratio and gain. HL is chosen to be three values: HL 1 = 1. 16 λo, HL 2 = 2. 63 λo and HL 3 = 4. 64 λo. HL 1 radiates axial beam whereas HL 2 and HL 3 radiates tilt beams. By changing square dielectric substrate length (SL), maximum beam direction on the elevation angle has been tilted more to the higher elevation angle with HL 2 and HL 3 <b>fixed.</b> <b>Half</b> Power Beam Width (HPBW) in the elevation angle when Φ = maximum gain direction of RHCP is decreased by increasing square dielectric ubstrate length. s Introduction: Spiral antenna was previously investigated [1 - 3]. The main characteristics of spiral antenna are broad bandwidth and wide beam-width. Another feature of spiral antenna is tilt beam characteristic by changing its horizontal arm length [2]. To obtain a tilt beam, the outermost periphery of the spiral must be more than 2 λg, where λg is the guided wavelength [3].

40|$|We obtain quasi-static, {{two-dimensional}} {{solutions for}} earthquake nucleation on faults obeying Dieterich's “aging” {{version of the}} rate and state friction equations. Two distinct nucleation regimes are found, separated by roughly a/b ∼ 0. 5, where a and b are the constitutive parameters relating changes in slip rate V and state θ to frictional strength. When fault healing is unimportant (Vθ/D_c ≫ 1, where D_c is the characteristic slip distance {{for the evolution of}} θ), the nucleation zone spontaneously evolves toward a state of accelerating slip on a patch of <b>fixed</b> <b>half</b> length L_ν ≈ 1. 3774 (μ′D_c /bσ), where μ′ is the intrinsic stiffness of the medium and σ is the normal stress. This is the fixed length solution for which the stress intensity factor K = 0. Although this solution does not depend upon a/b explicitly, only for a/b < 0. 3781 does healing remain unimportant as instability is approached. For a/b ≳ 0. 5 and a wide range of slow loading conditions, Vθ/D_c ultimately approaches a quasi-constant value near 1, and the nucleation zone takes on the appearance of an expanding slip-weakening crack. A fracture energy balance indicates that in this regime the nucleation length asymptotically approaches π− 1 [b/(b − a) ] 2 (μ′D_c /bσ), a result that is consistent with the numerical simulations despite considerable complexity asa approaches b. This suggests that nucleation lengths can sometimes be much larger than those found by Dieterich (e. g., by a factor of 100 for a/b = 0. 95). For surfaces this close to velocity neutral, nucleation might produce signals detectable by surface seismometers for values of D_c at {{the upper end of the}} lab range (100 μm). However, the attributes of the aging law that give rise to such large nucleation lengths may be nonphysical; additional laboratory experiments are needed to address this issue...|$|E
