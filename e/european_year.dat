Language policy affects the overall European Union strategy of communication with its citizens and the effort to establish a European identity. In many of these issues, responsibility was shared with other Commissioners, namely the European Commissioner for Education, Training and Culture, Ján Figeľ. Orban was also responsible, alongside the President of the Commission, Barroso, and Figeľ to work on [...] "intercultural dialogue", including the 2008 <b>European</b> <b>Year</b> of Intercultural Dialogue.|$|E

In addition to the Lifelong Learning Programme 2007–2013 and other educational and cultural programmes, Orban promoted multilingualism within other relevant policies and programmes, including the Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development, the European Social Fund and immigration initiatives. He also intended to contribute to the 2008 <b>European</b> <b>Year</b> of Intercultural Dialogue, where multilingualism played a fundamental part. On planning further policy, Orban promised to, [...] "carefully analyse the results from the Action Plan for the promotion of language learning and linguistic diversity, the recommendations from the High Level Group on Multilingualism and the activities of the Commission internal network for multilingualism. Before the end of 2007, I would organise a Ministerial conference to discuss the way forward. I would then propose a new Action Plan in 2008 to continue work in this area." ...|$|E

2500|$|The immense {{popularity}} of Neill's work {{led to the}} Lobey Dosser stories being published as small one shilling booklets, and {{a decade after the}} strip ended he was still getting enquiries from around the world from fans desperately trying to purchase one of these increasingly rare volumes. By the mid 1970s Glasgow artist Ranald MacColl had begun collecting material for a biography. The Daily Express closed its Glasgow print works and dozens of bin bags of Neill's original work were thrown out, [...] fortunately another local artist Calum MacKenzie, Director of The Glasgow Print Studio and Gallery found and saved some of the works which eventually were exhibited in the exhibition, The Scottish Cartoonists (1979).During Glasgow's <b>European</b> <b>Year</b> of Culture Ranald MacColl organised a comprehensive exhibition of Bud's work,including unpublished pieces, at Glasgow's Art Galleries and Museum. Julian Spalding, the Director at this period, pronounced the show {{one of the most popular}} of that year.|$|E

The program commemorated the life and work of Asad, described as a great Austrian visionary, who earned international recognition by building bridges between religions. The honoree's son Talal Asad, the President of the Islamic Community of Austria Anas Schakfeh and Vienna's cultural adviser Andreas Mailath-Pokorny were present at the unveiling of the square. Mailath-Pokorny, while talking to the media said: [...] "There is probably no more appropriate place to honor Muhammad Asad than that {{in front of the}} UN-City. Muhammad Asad was a citizen of the world, who was at home, and left his mark, everywhere in the world, especially in the Orient." ...|$|E

Given the vast range of issues they address, EU policies {{are an integral part}} of Slovak higher-education study programmes with various specializations. They are devoted considerable space in university interpreting- translation study programmes, which are designed to form broadly educated minds able to play the role of intercultural and interlingual intermediary between members of different language communities. One example of European policies in practice are the so-called <b>European</b> <b>Years.</b> Thus in the second part of the paper {{we present a}} historical overview of them and summarize their objectives. With regard to the educational objectives set out in Slovakia's translation and interpreting study programmes, we will focus on the crucial terminology related to the <b>European</b> <b>Years</b> as well as to EU policies...|$|R

50|$|With {{respect to}} the broader sense, various {{philosophers}} have put forward theories contrasting the value of positive law relative to natural law. The normative theory of law, as put forth by the Brno school, gave pre-eminence to positive law because of its rational nature. Classical liberal and libertarian philosophers usually favor natural law over legal positivism. Positive law, to French philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau, was freedom from internal obstacles. Among the foremost proponents of legal positivism {{in the twentieth century}} was Hans Kelsen, both in his <b>European</b> <b>years</b> prior to 1940, and in his American years following 1940 until his death in 1973.|$|R
