5|$|By late 1461, risings in {{the north}} had been put down, and {{in the summer of}} 1462, Warwick {{negotiated}} a truce with Scotland. In October the same year, Margaret of Anjou invaded England with troops from France, and managed to take the castles of Alnwick and Bamburgh. Warwick had to organise the recapture of the castles, which was accomplished by January 1463. The leaders of the rebellion, including Sir Ralph Percy, were pardoned and left in charge of the retaken castles. At this point, Warwick felt secure enough to travel south; in February <b>he</b> <b>buried</b> the remains of his father and brother at Bisham Priory, and in March he attended parliament at Westminster.|$|E
5|$|The name of {{the roller}} coaster comes from the story of Hercules in Greek Mythology. According to the story, Hercules had to perform twelve labours. After {{defeating}} the Nemean lion for the first labour, the second was to defeat the Hydra, a nine-headed creature with eight serpentine heads that would regrow each time they were cut off, including one that was immortal. Dorney Park altered {{the remainder of the}} story- after Hercules managed to defeat the Hydra initially, <b>he</b> <b>buried</b> the immortal head stuck under a stone, with the intention of sealing it for all time. Years later however, the head slowly grew back, resurrecting the Hydra and taking its revenge on Hercules by killing him; hence why the Hydra roller coaster sits where Hercules once did.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} famous legends is about Shishman's final battle. The Ottomans camped at Kostenets, near the origins of the Maritsa river, while the Bulgarians were near Samokov, on a hill. After a fierce battle, Ivan Shishman was wounded seven times and retreated to the fortress, where he died; on the {{battlefield}} seven springs appeared, one for each of the emperor's wounds. He is also said to have fought in the Balkan mountains at Shishkin grad ("Shishman's town"), between Sliven and Kazanlak, where he killed 10,000 janissaries in a huge battle. The 18th century Bulgarian enlightener Paisius of Hilendar wrote in his Istoriya Slavyanobolgarskaya that during the siege of Tarnovo Ivan Shishman managed to reach Sofia with his boyars. He hid his treasury in the Iskar gorge and fought against the Turks for seven years before dying in battle. Some versions suggest that Kokalyanski Urvich remained the last fortress to fall and before Shishman died <b>he</b> <b>buried</b> treasure under the castle and tried to escape by cutting a passage through the mountain. The repeating motif of the treasure is a sacral symbol of the Bulgarian statehood and the usual locations of the imperial jewellery are monasteries, lakes or hideouts under rivers. Being undiscovered by the invaders, the treasure symbolises the sovereignty and power of the Bulgarian Empire and its inevitable resurrection. There are also a number of parallels between the legends about Ivan Shishman and the hagiography of saints, especially John of Rila, including the almost identical route of the emperor, Tarnovo-Sofia-Samokov in Rila, and the route of the return of the relics of Saint John of Rila to the Rila Monastery in 15th century – Tarnovo-Sofia-Rila, and also the motif of the immortal rulers who foresees the restoration of the country.|$|E

5|$|When Brian {{approaches}} Stewie {{about helping}} him find {{a tennis ball}} he'd buried, Stewie asks if Brian remembers the date that he lost it. Brian tells him that <b>he</b> <b>buried</b> it on January 31, 1999 (the day of the series' premiere on Fox). Using Stewie's time machine to travel back to that date, the two soon come upon the Griffin family, but notice that their past looks more strange than they remembered it: The family continually pauses for cutaways, and Meg's voice sounds different. Telling Brian that he mustn't alter the past by getting the tennis ball {{and that he should}} instead memorize its location, Stewie goes into his room to set up their return to the present before Past Stewie suddenly enters. The two Stewies then meet, and Stewie tells Brian to come out from his hiding place after explaining himself to Past Stewie. However, hanging outside the window, Brian fell onto Past Peter's car as he drives to the bachelor party at past Glenn Quagmire's house. Stewie finds Brian and the two then attempt to return to the present, but find that the transportation device's batteries are running low and moved only a bit forward in time towards their destination. Later, the two manage to take advantage of Peter dumping his extra welfare money out of a blimp above Super Bowl XXXIII to collect the money needed to purchase new batteries. It was only after the two return to the present that Stewie learns that Brian intentionally told his past self about the September 11 attacks ahead of time, allowing the Past Brian to beat American Airlines Flight 11 hijackers Mohamed Atta and Abdulaziz al-Omari with a baseball bat, and then preventing the other three planes from leaving the airports.|$|E

25|$|Edmond joined other clubs {{for their}} social status: the Jockey Club, the most exclusive, and the Cercle de la rue Royale, {{a venue for}} idling, smoking cigars, {{discussing}} politics and the stock market.

25|$|Prior to {{the fall}} of Singapore, Varley began a secret diary which he {{maintained}} {{for much of his}} captivity.

Before he was transferred to Singapore with the rest of A Force, <b>he</b> <b>buried</b> the diary which by now amounted to several volumes. The diaries were retrieved after the war and used as evidence in war crime trials of several Japanese officers.|$|E
25|$|The small action had the {{unexpected}} effect of relieving Potosí. Indeed, Castro believed that his squadron was shadowed {{by a combined}} force of 200 men and withdrawn to Condo, the headquarters of General Pezuela.

25|$|In 63 BC, Marcus Lucullus {{opposed the}} attempt of Catilina {{to kill the}} consuls, among them Cicero, and {{overthrow}} the government. In the following year, he served as the main witness for the defense in the trial against his friend, the poet Licinius Archias, in which Cicero gave his famous speech in defense of Archias' claims to Roman citizenship. Later, in 58 and 57 BC, Marcus Lucullus belonged to the group that worked {{behind the scenes to}} enable Cicero's return from exile. When his brother, Lucius Lucullus, lost his mental powers, Marcus Lucullus became his legal guardian; <b>he</b> <b>buried</b> him at his Tusculan estate in 56 BC.

25|$|After his {{ascent of}} Kangchenjunga, Mutschlechner {{flew back to}} Europe because his {{frostbite}} had to be treated and Messner needed rest. Thus the three mountains could not be climbed as planned. Messner was cured of his amoebic abscess in the liver and then travelled to Gasherbrum II, but could not use the new routes as planned. In any case, his climbing partners, Sher Khan and Nazir Sabir, {{would not have been}} strong enough. Nevertheless, all three reached the summit on 24 July in a storm. During the ascent, Messner discovered the body of a previously missing Austrian mountaineer, whom <b>he</b> <b>buried</b> two years later at the G I – G II crossing.|$|E
25|$|Following Freeman's {{death the}} estate passed to John Cooke his nephew, a merchant, dilettante and amateur architect, who under William's will {{changed his name}} to Freeman. He was an early member of the Society of Antiquaries, built the Gothic folly in the grounds and the Freeman family {{mausoleum}} in the village based on the design of the tomb of Caecilla Metella in Rome. <b>He</b> <b>buried</b> a time capsule of contemporary artefacts in a mound resembling a round barrow on the estate. These were rediscovered in the early 20th century when the site was excavated by archaeologists. Examples of its many day to day household items of the early 18th century are in the River and Rowing Museum in Henley.|$|E

For me, the rabbit is the symbol of incarnation.

25|$|Fred VII then {{impersonated}} the Commander himself, {{traveling to}} Cobra Island to vie {{for control of}} Cobra with Serpentor (eventually sparking the Cobra Civil War). Unknown to Fred VII, he had been under surveillance by another Crimson Guardsman when <b>he</b> <b>buried</b> the Commander's body. This agent discovered that Cobra Commander was not dead, and {{brought him back to}} health. Thereafter, the Commander formed an underground network of loyal agents within Cobra, and rebuilt his personal fortune and influence. When Doctor Mindbender went to harvest DNA from Cobra Commander's body {{for the creation of a}} new leader, he discovered the empty grave, upon which the original Cobra Commander revealed himself and seized open control of Cobra.|$|E
25|$|In June 1699 Kidd {{was stopped}} on the island while sailing to Boston to try to clear his name. With the {{permission}} of the proprietor, Mrs. Gardiner, <b>he</b> <b>buried</b> $30,000 in treasure in a ravine between Bostwick's Point and the Manor House. For her troubles he gave her a piece of gold cloth (a piece of which is now at the East Hampton library) that was captured from a Moorish ship off Madagascar, as well as a bag of sugar. Kidd warned that if it was not there when he returned he would kill Gardiner. Kidd was tried in Boston and Gardiner was ordered to deliver the treasure as evidence. The booty included gold dust, bars of silver, Spanish dollars, rubies, diamonds, candlesticks and porringers. Gardiner kept one of the diamonds, which he gave his daughter. A plaque on the island marks the spot, but it's on private property.|$|E
25|$|Upon the {{outbreak}} of the Third Carlist War in 1872 both Nocedals remained in Madrid, where they were subject to rather minor legal action. Their political activity was reduced almost to nil; unable to and indeed uneasy about openly supporting the rebels, they allowed themselves only veiled demonstrations of enmity towards the newly established republican regime. Ramón withdrew to privacy: in 1873 he got married and in 1875 <b>he</b> <b>buried</b> his mother. He was also busy preparing his plays for stage performance in Madrid theatres, though his whereabouts remain somewhat confused. Early 1875, with the war outcome still unclear, the Nocedals launched a new daily, El Siglo Futuro. Formatted as militantly Catholic, it evaded any political declarations though clearly identified itself as ultraconservative. Later that year the official mistrust towards the Nocedals climaxed in the order of exile; they spent the time travelling across Portugal and France until the ban was lifted in late 1876.|$|E

25|$|According to some sources, on {{the morning}} of her death, she took a bath, put on new clothes and lay down in bed. She asked for Ali and {{informed}} him that her time to die was very close. Upon hearing this news, Ali began to cry but was consoled by Fatimah who asked him to look after her two sons and for him to bury her without ceremony. It is further stated that her two sons were the first family members to learn of her death and immediately proceeded to the mosque to inform their father. Upon hearing the news, Ali fell unconscious. After recovering he followed Fatima's wishes and performed the janazah. <b>He</b> <b>buried</b> her during the night on 13 Jumada al-awwal 11AH (632 AD), also making three false graves to ensure her real grave could not be identified. With him were his family and a few of his close companions. After her death, Ali followed her wishes and buried her without informing the Medinan people.|$|E
25|$|Stieglitz's mother Hedwig died in November 1922, {{and as he}} {{did with}} his father <b>he</b> <b>buried</b> his grief in his work. He spent time with Paul Strand and his new wife Rebecca (Beck), {{reviewed}} the work of another newcomer named Edward Weston and began organizing a new show of O'Keeffe's work. Her show opened in early 1923, and Stieglitz spent much of the spring marketing her work. Eventually twenty of her paintings sold for more than $3,000. In the summer, O'Keeffe once again took off for the seclusion of the Southwest, and for a while Stieglitz was alone with Beck Strand at Lake George. He took a series of nude photos of her, and soon he became infatuated with her. They had a brief physical affair before O'Keeffe returned in the fall. O'Keeffe could tell what had happened, but since she did not see Stieglitz's new lover as a serious threat to their relationship she let things pass. Six years later she would have her own affair with Beck Strand in New Mexico.|$|E
25|$|Gilliam and Lamp {{were driven}} to the San Gabriel Mountains, where they were held captive for almost two days, being bound and gagged between {{repeated}} instances of sexual and physical abuse. Both men slept in the van alongside their two hostages, with each alternatively acting as a lookout. On one occasion, Bittaker walked Lamp onto a nearby hill and forced her to pose for pornographic pictures before returning her to the van. Bittaker also informed Norris to take several Polaroid pictures of himself and Gilliam, both nude and clothed. In {{the first of three}} instances in which Bittaker raped Gilliam, he also created a tape recording of himself raping her, forcing the girl to pretend she was his cousin and informing Gilliam to feel free to express her pain. (Bittaker later claimed <b>he</b> <b>buried</b> the tape in a cemetery. The tape recording of Gilliam's rape was never found.) Bittaker is also known to have tortured Gilliam by stabbing her breasts with an ice pick and using vise grip pliers to tear off part of one nipple.|$|E
