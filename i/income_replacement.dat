2500|$|The Pension Reform Law (1972) {{guaranteed}} all retirees {{a minimum}} pension {{regardless of their}} contributions and institutionalized the norm that the standard pension (of average earners with forty years of contributions) should not fall below 50% of current gross earnings. The 1972 pension reforms improved eligibility conditions and benefits for nearly every subgroup of the West German population. The <b>income</b> <b>replacement</b> rate for employees who made full contributions was raised to 70% of average earnings. The reform also replaced 65 as the mandatory retirement age with a [...] "retirement window" [...] ranging between 63 and 65 for employees {{who had worked for}} at least thirty-five years. Employees who qualified as disabled and had worked for at least thirty-five years were extended a more generous retirement window, which ranged between the ages of 60 and 62. Women who had worked for at least fifteen years (ten of which had to be after the age of age 40) and the long-term unemployed were also granted the same retirement window as the disabled. In addition, there were no benefit reductions for employees who had decided to retire earlier than the age of 65. The legislation also changed the way in which pensions were calculated for low-income earners who had been covered for twenty-five or more years. If the pension benefit fell below a specified level, then such workers were allowed to substitute a wage figure of 75% of the average wage during this period, thus creating something like a minimum wage benefit. According to one study, the 1972 pension reform “enhanced” the reduction of poverty in old age.|$|E

Whether or not these events will occur is uncertain. If the policyholder discontinues coverage because he or she has sold the insured car or home, the insurance company will not refund the full premium.|$|E

40|$|The <b>income</b> <b>replacement</b> rate (income {{immediately}} following retirement divided by income immediately preceding retirement) has become widely {{used as a}} measure of economic preparation for retirement. Yet a number of relevant issues are not adequately captured by the replacement rate concept. These include nontraditional transitions from full employment to full retirement, nonparallel transitions by the members of a married couple, and the ability to finance consumption out of savings. In this paper we estimate several measures of the <b>income</b> <b>replacement</b> rate that address some of these issues. Then we compare these <b>income</b> <b>replacement</b> rates with a consumption-based measure of economic preparation that takes into account the ultimate consequences for the retirement-to-death consumption path. Broadly speaking, the measure finds whether a household has, with high probability, the resources to finance a trajectory of spending from shortly following retirement until death. Our preferred measure of the <b>income</b> <b>replacement</b> rate somewhat understates the percentage of single persons adequately prepared for retirement, but it grossly understates the percentage of married persons adequately prepared. Furthermore, there is little relationship between the <b>income</b> <b>replacement</b> rate and our consumption-based measure. The implication is that the <b>income</b> <b>replacement</b> rate is of little use for assessing economic preparation for retirement: the chances that someone with a low <b>income</b> <b>replacement</b> rate is well prepared are not much different from the chances that someone with a high <b>income</b> <b>replacement</b> rate is well prepared...|$|E

40|$|This study employs an age-based, risk-averse {{investment}} strategy {{to decide the}} weight of risky assets and of risk-less assets for hypothetical pension fund portfolios {{in order to maximize}} investors' utility. The level of risk is affected by many factors including age, gender, and investment experience, etc. Here we use the factor of age to determine the level of risk. Then we construct the contribution model and retirement benefit model to simulate the <b>income</b> <b>replacement</b> rate and the amount of pension benefits and give each method a benchmark to examine if they are enough to maintain living standard before retirement. In this article, we find some relations between our variables: first, the positive relation between <b>income</b> <b>replacement</b> rate and retirement age; second, the positive relation between <b>income</b> <b>replacement</b> rate and contribution rate; third, the positive relation between <b>income</b> <b>replacement</b> rate and investment return; forth, the negative relation between <b>income</b> <b>replacement</b> rate and salary growth rate. Besides, we can find that V=age^ 0. 6 is the best allocation because it is the most fitting in our assumption that as an investor is years old, the weight of risk-less assets is nearly. However, if employees adopt this level of risk aversion, the <b>income</b> <b>replacement</b> rate almost can reach the benchmark and maintain the living standard before retirement.
