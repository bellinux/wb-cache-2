The surface quality of stents has a significant influence on biocompatibility, therefore the optimal method for <b>electropolishing</b> were explored.

40|$|The {{characteristics}} of surface roughness span {{a range of}} length scales determined {{by the nature of}} the surface generation process. The mechanism by which material is removed at a length scale determines the roughness at that scale. <b>Electropolishing</b> preferentially reduces the peaks of surface protuberances at sub-micron length scales to produce smooth surfaces. The material removal in <b>electropolishing</b> occurs by two different mechanisms of anodic leveling and microsmoothing. Due to insufficient lateral resolution, individual contribution of these two mechanisms could not be measured by conventional roughness measurement techniques and parameters. In this work, we utilize the high lateral resolution offered by Atomic force microscopy along with the power spectral density method of characterization, to study the evolution of roughness during <b>electropolishing.</b> The power spectral density show two corner frequencies indicating the length scales over which the two mechanisms operate. These characteristic frequencies are found to be a function of the <b>electropolishing</b> time and hence can be used to optimize the <b>electropolishing</b> process...|$|R
50|$|To achieve <b>electropolishing</b> of a rough surface, the {{protruding}} {{parts of a}} surface profile must dissolve faster than the recesses.

A total of 300 SSRCs were prepared with ProTaper Sx, S 1, and S 2 instruments using an automated testing platform. Maximum torque (in Ncm) and maximum force values (in N) were measured.

Potentiodynamic and ASTM F 746 potentiostatic tests in a 0. 9 % NaCl solution were conducted on wires in their as-received, chemically etched, aged in boiling water, and <b>electropolished</b> states. As-received wires with various surface finishes revealed breakdown potentials in the range from - 100 mV to + 500 mV; similar passive current density, 10 (- 6) A/cm(2); and a wide hysteresis on the reverse scan, demonstrating strong susceptibility to localized corrosion. Chemically etched wires with original black oxide displayed consistent corrosion performance and surpassed, in corrosion resistance, <b>electropolished</b> wires that showed significantly lower breakdown (400 - 700 mV) and localized corrosion potentials (similar to - 50 to + 113 mV). Sandblasted and fine-drawn wires exhibited rather inconsistent corrosion behavior. In potentiodynamic tests these wires could perform with equal probability either on the level of pretreated BO wires or rather similar to as-received wires. Both SB and FD wires revealed low breakdown potentials in the PS regime. SEM analysis performed before tests indicated that sandblasting was not efficient for the complete removal of the original scaling, and fine drawing aggravated the situation, resulting in a persistent scaling that contributed to the inferior corrosion performance. Inclusions (oxides, carbides, and oxidized carbides) inherited from the bulk and retained on <b>electropolished</b> surfaces are the cause of their inferior performance compared to chemically etched surfaces.
