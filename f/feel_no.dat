5|$|When {{asked how}} he, {{as the son}} of Holocaust survivors, felt about Israel’s {{operation}} in Gaza, Finkelstein replied:It {{has been a long time}} since I felt any emotional connection with the state of Israel, which relentlessly and brutally and inhumanly keeps these vicious, murderous wars. It is a vandal state. There is a Russian writer who once described vandal states as Genghis Khan with a telegraph. Israel is Genghis Khan with a computer. I <b>feel</b> <b>no</b> emotion of affinity with that state. I have some good friends and their families there, and of course I would not want any of them to be hurt. That said, sometimes I feel that Israel has come out of the boils (sic) of the hell, a satanic state.|$|E
25|$|Another {{theme is}} a kind of {{military}} racism, or species-ism. The Mushrooms are clearly described as different, although they would seem to be human, to some extent. However, when it comes to battle, the Mushrooms are treated like non-humans or animals—alien. Killing them is necessary, impersonal, and raises no questions of conscience. The Minnipins <b>feel</b> <b>no</b> pity for their enemy, even as the story describes the shrieks from the Mushrooms as they are killed.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, Professor Frank Perri {{has argued}} that police {{interviews}} with Christopher Porco were seriously flawed because police questioning procedures seemingly failed to account for Porco's probable psychopathy. Psychopaths have unusual emotional responses and <b>feel</b> <b>no</b> remorse for their misdeeds, so standard police interview tactics are useless, as in the Porco case, where police failed to obtain any valuable information during questioning. According to Perri, police should study the Porco case to more productively interview potentially psychopathic suspects by using a non-confrontational approach rather than appealing to emotions.|$|E

25|$|The skin {{of naked}} mole-rats lacks a key {{neurotransmitter}} called substance P {{that is responsible}} in mammals for sending pain signals to the central nervous system. As a result, the naked mole-rats <b>feel</b> <b>no</b> pain, {{even when they are}} exposed to acid or capsaicin. When they are injected with substance P, however, the pain signaling works as it does in other mammals, but only with capsaicin and not with acids. This is proposed to be an adaptation to the animal living in high levels of carbon dioxide due to poorly ventilated living spaces, which would cause acid to build up in their body tissues.|$|E

Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi are presently under investigation for fraud in the National Herald scam. Regional and State-level allies of the INC who were UPA coalition partners, sensing {{the mood of the}} people, have disassociated themselves from Rahul Gandhi. Entrance into politics by Priyanka Gandhi-Vadra is fraught with uncertainty due to ongoing investigations into business dealings brokered by her husband Robert Vadra. The INC, after dominating Indian politics for most of the post-Indian independence period, faces an uncertain future. The political elimination of dynastic heirs from prominent political families who have dominated Indian politics for decades (Palaniappan Chidambaram, Salman Khurshid, Oscar Fernandes, Sachin Pilot) has resulted in the advent of a new breed of Indian politicians who <b>feel</b> <b>no</b> obligation to stick to traditional approaches and constraints in domestic and foreign relations.

500|$|The {{co-operation}} between monarch and Parliament {{following the}} Gunpowder Plot was atypical. Instead, {{it was the}} previous session of 1604 that shaped the attitudes of both sides {{for the rest of}} the reign, though the initial difficulties owed more to mutual incomprehension than conscious enmity. On 7 July 1604, James had angrily prorogued Parliament after failing to win its support either for full union or financial subsidies.

500|$|The film {{focuses on}} Takao Akizuki, an {{aspiring}} 15-year-old shoemaker, and Yukari Yukino, a mysterious 27-year-old woman he keeps meeting at [...] Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden on rainy mornings. While Takao is skipping his morning class to design shoes, Yukari is avoiding work due to personal problems in her professional life. Yukari tells Takao nothing about herself, including her name, while Takao opens up to her, sharing {{his passion for}} shoes by offering to make a pair for her. When Takao learns Yukari's identity, emotions come to a head as both learn {{that they have been}} teaching each other [...] "how to walk". Shinkai wrote the story as a tale of [...] "lonely sadness", based on the meaning of the traditional Japanese word for [...] "love", and uses shoes as a metaphor for life. The story's motifs include rain, Man'yōshū poetry, and the Japanese garden. The age difference between the two main characters and their character traits demonstrate how awkwardly and disjointedly people mature, where even adults sometimes <b>feel</b> <b>no</b> more mature than teenagers, according to Shinkai.|$|E

500|$|His law {{practice}} increased greatly from this exposure, {{as did the}} demands on his time. In 1771, he moved Abigail and the children to Braintree, but he kept his office in Boston, saying, [...] "I shall spend more Time in my Office than ever I did." [...] He also noted {{on the day of}} the family's move, [...] "Now my family is away, I <b>feel</b> <b>no</b> Inclination at all, no Temptation, to be any where but at my Office. I am in it by 6 in the Morning – I am in it at 9 at night.... In the Evening, I can be alone at my Office, and no where else. I never could in my family." [...] Nevertheless, after some time in the capital, he became disenchanted with the rural and [...] "vulgar" [...] Braintree as a home for his family. In August 1772, therefore, Adams moved his family back to Boston. He purchased a large brick house on Queen Street, not far from his office. In 1774, Adams and Abigail returned the family to the farm due to the increasingly unstable situation in Boston, and Braintree remained their permanent Massachusetts home.|$|E
500|$|The film conveys {{what some}} viewers have {{described}} as {{a sense of the}} sublime and numinous. Roger Ebert writes in his essay on 2001 in The Great Movies: [...] In a book on architecture, Gregory Caicco writes that Space Odyssey illustrates how our quest for space is motivated by two contradictory desires, a [...] "desire for the sublime" [...] characterized by a need to encounter something totally other than ourselves—"something numinous"—and the conflicting desire for a beauty that makes us <b>feel</b> <b>no</b> longer [...] "lost in space," [...] but at home. Similarly, an article in The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Science Fiction and Fantasy, titled [...] "Sense of Wonder," [...] describes how 2001 creates a [...] "numinous sense of wonder" [...] by portraying a universe that inspires a sense of awe, which {{at the same time we}} feel we can understand. Christopher Palmer wrote that there exists in the film a coexistence of [...] "the sublime and the banal," [...] as the film implies that to get into space, mankind had to suspend the [...] "sense of wonder" [...] that motivated him to explore space to begin with.|$|E
500|$|Hot Fuzz {{received}} critical acclaim. The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes {{reported a}} 91% approval rating {{with an average}} rating of 7.7/10 based on 199 reviews.

The result is a bitingly satiric and hugely entertaining parody." [...] It also has a Metacritic score of 81/100. Olly Richards of Empire praised the chemistry between Pegg and Frost, saying: [...] "After almost a decade together, they're clearly so comfortable in each other's presence that they <b>feel</b> <b>no</b> need to fight for the punchline, making them terrific company for two hours". Johnny Vaughan of The Sun already called it the [...] "most arresting Brit-com of 2007". Phillip French of The Observer, who did not care for Shaun of the Dead, warmed to the comedy team in this film. The film also received positive reviews in the United States. Derek Elley of Variety praised Broadbent and Dalton as [...] "especially good as Angel's hail-fellow-well-met superior and oily No. 1 suspect". As an homage to the genre, the film was well received by screenwriter Shane Black. On Spill.com, it got their 2nd-highest rating of 'Full Price!!'.|$|E

500|$|Townsend had {{asserted}} {{in chapter}} {{one that the}} cause of China's present misery lies in the fundamental defects that exist in the ethnic characteristics of the Chinese people and in chapters three and four he explains what he believes these defects are. Townsend states that dishonesty is [...] "the most prominent characteristic in the Chinese mentality as opposed to our own". Townsend gives many examples of him being lied to by Chinese employees, coolies, shopkeepers, and government officials, and notes that many other consuls were driven out of the service by this relentless and [...] "aimless lying, with each lie merely a pretext for another". The other highly salient trait of the Chinese is their [...] "indifference to fellow suffering". Through a large number of personal and second-hand anecdotes, Townsend argues that the Chinese may be the only {{people in the world who}} are completely unable to comprehend the basic human impulses of sympathy or gratitude toward other people. Because the Chinese <b>feel</b> <b>no</b> empathy toward others, they behave in an unbelievably sadistic and cruel fashion toward one another, and they view altruistic foreigners as targets to be mercilessly taken advantage of. Other traits Townsend identifies as being typically Chinese are cowardice, [...] lust for money, lack of a sense of personal hygiene, lack of critical thinking skills, insincerity, and obsession with hollow rites. Townsend believes that these traits are as notable among China's leaders and educated strata as much as they are in the poor masses, and his analysis of historical documents leads him to believe that they are not a recent product of the present chaos, but rather are deeply ingrained traits of China's national character. He concludes that the [...] "outstanding characteristics" [...] of the Chinese people [...] "neither enable other peoples to deal satisfactorily with them, nor enable the Chinese to deal satisfactorily with themselves." ...|$|E
500|$|According to MTV News, {{the song}} [...] "touches on Drake {{reaction}} to fame and stardom". Drake told MTV News, that {{the song was}} [...] "definitely" [...] a choice of his for releasing as a single, {{and that it was}} a song he did for himself. [...] Brad Wete of Entertainment Weekly called the song, [...] "a prideful track about a guy who fought for notoriety, gained it, and now struggles with what comes with it: criticism, groupies, and the pressure of expected greatness." [...] The song makes heavy use of an orchestral backdrop, while Drake delivers confident, aggressive raps in a paced fashion. Drake makes references to film critics Roger Ebert & Richard Roeper, as well as actress Jada Pinkett Smith and her 1996 film, Set It Off. According to Michael Craggg of MusicOMH, the song contains three hooks. Several lines in the second verse are actually a flip of hip-hop group Dead Prez's [...] "Hip-Hop", from their 2000 debut, Let's Get Free. Ironically, Dead Prez's track is meant as a jab at media controlled artists like Drake, stating, [...] "One thing about music when it hits you <b>feel</b> <b>no</b> pain/ White folks say it controls your brain/ I know better than that/ It's just game", to which Drake stated when asked about it, [...] "I love that flow. So I took that flow and flipped it in the second verse." [...] He also references Michael Jackson's iconic attire in his [...] "Thriller" [...] video, though the lines, [...] "'Bout to go 'Thriller' Mike Jackson on these niggas/ All I need is a fucking red jacket with some zippers." [...] On the reference, Drake said, [...] "That was sort of my reference point; that phenomenon of Michael. He was young and had the world excited and anticipating his every move. That was my homage to him and the impact that he had on the world that I live in. It's also ... great for people to say. Especially, unfortunately what happened to him, just to honor him was great." ...|$|E
