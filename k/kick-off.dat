5|$|The game {{started with}} Maryland {{receiving}} the <b>kick-off</b> {{and on the}} first series, quarterback Chris Turner linked up with freshman Adrian Cannon for a 59-yard touchdown.

5|$|The {{match is}} largely remembered for the {{disaster}} that occurred before the <b>kick-off.</b> Liverpool fans breached a fence separating {{the two groups}} of supporters and charged the Juventus fans.

5|$|The {{match was}} the last for Borussia Dortmund veteran Jürgen Kohler, who was {{retiring}} after this match, however, the match did not go as intended as he was sent off after 31 minutes.

50|$|The yard {{lines in}} Canadian {{football}} are vitally important during game play, because a team's advance is measured against these lines, {{which in turn}} determines ball possession, whereas the halfway, 22 and 10 yards lines only determine the position of players during various rugby union <b>kick-offs</b> (which could be from the halfway line or 22s) or line-out {{in the case of}} the broken line 5 yd from the side lines.|$|R
