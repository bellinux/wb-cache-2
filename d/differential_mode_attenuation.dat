40|$|Abstract: Selective {{excitation}} of graded-index multimode fibers (GIMMFs) with a {{single-mode fiber}} (SMF) has gained increased interest for telecommunication applications. It {{has been proposed}} {{as a way to}} enhance the transmission bandwidth of GI-MMF links and/or create parallel communication channels over the same GI-MMF. Although the effect of SMF excitation on the transmission bandwidth has been investigated, its impact on the near-field intensity pattern at the output face of the GI-MMF has not been systematically addressed. We have carried out an analysis of the near-field intensity pattern at the output face of silica-based GI-MMFs excited by a radially offset SMF. Simulation results exhibit all of the features displayed by experimental ones. It turns out that <b>differential</b> <b>mode</b> <b>attenuation</b> and delay, full intra-group mode mixing, and small deviations in the refractive index profile of the GI-MMF do not affect the overall shape of the near-field intensity, which is determined by the radial offset of the input SMF. This can be exploited in mode group diversity multiplexing links. The effect of defects in the refractive index profile, such as a central dip or peak, is also examined...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—It is {{clarified}} for {{the first}} time that the effect of the mode coupling on the bandwidth characteristic is very small in the graded-index polymer optical fiber (GI POF) compared with in the step-index (SI) POF. Although there have been several trials regarding the theoretical prediction of bandwidth characteristics of the GI POF, a disagreement between measured and estimated properties was observed. The origin of disagreement has been gen-erally explained as the mode coupling effect. However, it is clari-fied in this paper that the effect of the differential mode attenua-tion is the dominant factor of disagreement between measured and predicted bandwidth characteristics, while the effect of the mode coupling is small. In order to clarify the reason why the calculated bandwidth characteristics of the GI POF show a disagreement with that measured, differential mode delay and differential mode at-tenuation were investigated. It was found that the highest order mode in the poly methyl methacrylate (PMMA) base GI POF atten-uated 17 dB compared with the lowest order mode through 100 -m transmission. By taking into account this differential mode atten-uation, an excellent agreement is observed between calculated and measured results of both the bandwidth characteristics and group delay, in which no mode coupling was considered.

30|$|This paper {{argues that}} both the logic of particularist guanxi {{operations}} and the logic of social prestige recognition are a social operational mechanism of Chinese people in the social structure of <b>differential</b> <b>mode</b> of association. The <b>differential</b> <b>mode</b> of association emphasizes “the differentiation of in-group and out-group” with different social trust patterns for acquaintances and strangers. In-group trust and out-group trust have distinct social psychological processes and operational mechanisms. The logic of particularist guanxi operations contains the social psychological process of emotional trust, whose primary approach is to draw out-group partner that is outside the trust boundary in the <b>differential</b> <b>mode</b> of association into the trust boundary through fictive kinship {{and a series of}} guanxi operations. This logic has a strong in-group preference. The operational process of social relation is in fact the expanding process of focal firms by which they extend their self-centered <b>differential</b> <b>mode</b> of association. The structure of a sectarian small-group network typically takes a core-periphery structure formed by the interest-dependent relationship between focal firm and peripheral enterprises. Sectarian financing trust networks thus have quite limited collective social capital. Under the logic of particularism, the cultivation of high-level collective social capital can hardly be achieved. This is also the reason that much of the literature suggests that Chinese people can hardly construct general trust on the logic of particularism.|$|R
40|$|The {{common mode}} {{inductor}} {{is an integral}} part of most EMI filters; its very high impedance over a wide frequency range suppresses high frequency power supply spikes. Switching power supplies gener-ate two types of noise: common <b>mode</b> and <b>differential</b> <b>mode.</b> <b>Differential</b> <b>mode</b> noise (Figure 1 a) follows the same path as the input power. Com-mon mode noise (Figure 1 b) is rep-resented by spikes that are equal to and in phase with each other and have a circuit path through ground. To suppress EMI, a typical filter will include common <b>mode</b> induc-tors, <b>differential</b> <b>mode</b> inductors and X and Y capacitors. The Y capaci-tors and the common mode induc-tors contribute to the attenuation of the common mode noise. The induc-tors become high impedances to the high frequency noise and either re-flect or absorb the noise while the capacitors become low impedance paths to ground and redirect the noise away from the main line (Figure 2). To be effective, the common mode inductor must provide the proper impedance over the switching fre-quency range. Common mode inductors are wound with two windings of equal numbers of turns. The windings are placed on the core so that the line currents in each winding create fluxes that are equal in magnitude but op-posite in phase.
