In particular, employees’ organizational commitment (primarily, the affective component) has been recognized as {{an essential component of}} organizational functioning and success. Hence, identifying the determinants of affective commitment {{is one of the most}} important research issues. This study tested the influence of leader-member exchange (LMX) and exchange ideology on employee’s affective commitment. In addition, the interactive effect of LMX and exchange ideology was examined. Data from 198 members of the Korean military supports each of the hypotheses. Lastly, implications for research and directions for future research are discussed. Keywords—Affective commitment, exchange ideology, leader-member <b>exchange,</b> <b>commitment.</b> I...|$|E
40|$|This study investigates {{organisational}} commitment of {{employees in the}} context of Jordanian banking industry. It aims at exploring this concept and identifying the factors that may influence it. Commitment was measured by using the Organisational Commitment Questionnaire (OCQ). Additional questions about background characteristics of subjects were also included in the questionnaire. The questionnaire was distributed to 250 subjects and 144 usable responses were used. The most salient findings of this study are: 1. Bankers in Jordan are committed to their organisation. The results do not reveal any significant differences between Jordanian bankers and their counterparts in other countries in terms of level of {{organisational commitment}}. 2. Old, high salaried and experiences bankers are more committed than young low salaried and unexperienced bankers. This indicates that Jordanian bankers express the side-bet theory of commitment (calculative commitment) in which individuals <b>exchange</b> <b>commitment</b> for economic rewards or inducements. 3. Female bankers are less committed than their male counterparts...|$|E

This is beneficial because it is lower risk, requires lower capital investments and the manufacturer gains the distributor’s expertise in the new market. Voxit AB {{is one of those}} growing {{companies that}} are in the starting phase of exporting one of their products within the area of speech recognition. The preparation for entering a new market through a foreign distributor is something Voxit is particularly interested in at the moment. A part of that is to build and keep a sustainable relationship with the foreign distributor.   With the purpose to increase my understanding about the relationship between manufacturers and foreign distributors, and to contribute with propositions to Voxit’s future international marketing strategy, six interviews with manufacturers were made. The focus is to study the factors trust, cultural differences, information <b>exchange,</b> <b>commitment</b> and opportunism that are affecting the relationship between these manufacturers and their foreign distributors and to see closer how these factors can be approached for a small company such as Voxit. The above purpose developed the research question; how should a manufacturer company such as Voxit, a SME that is starting to export a new product, develop a relationship with a foreign distributor?   Findings reveal that all factors that were studied, such as information exchange and cultural distance, are affecting the relationship between a manufacturer and a foreign distributor. However, the factors trust and commitment are especially affecting the relationship, which should be recognised when building a relationship with a foreign distributor...|$|E

40|$|It can {{be risky}} for governments to renege on <b>exchange</b> rate <b>commitments,</b> {{but it is}} {{misleading}} to characterize the costs as audience costs. While an audience costs approach assumes that the punishment for reneging is automatic, we model the choice of exchange rate policy {{in the shadow of}} elections as a signaling game between voters and governments, where governments have private information and voters are rational. We find that voters draw different inferences when they see reneging by different actors, and only Left governments are punished for breaking their promises. We test this hypothesis {{in the context of the}} post-Communist countries in the 1990 s, and find that Left governments were more likely to fall if they reneged on <b>exchange</b> rate <b>commitments,</b> but Right governments were not. ...|$|R

40|$|Motivated by {{the entry}} into service of new {{aircraft}} such as the Airbus A 380 {{as well as the}} pressure to operate existing fleets at lower cost, not only in civil but also in military aviation, a new industry paradigm has emerged where MRO (Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul) service providers or OEMs (Original Equipment Manufacturers) supply spare parts to airline operators on a maintenance-by-the-hour basis. As a consequence, the associated logistics networks have reached unprecedented complexity: Component <b>exchange</b> <b>commitments</b> are now made to multiple operators, not only at their main bases but also at outstations. In this setting, the limitations of conventional Initial Provisioning methods can be overcome with high-fidelity simulation-based optimisation techniques. In particular, this paper discusses how value can be unlocked from new logistics policies for spare parts management in aviation. ...|$|R

40|$|Aim To {{explore the}} {{relationships}} between climate for well-being, economic and social <b>exchange,</b> affective ward <b>commitment</b> and job strain among nurses in the Netherlands. Background This study focuses on the immediate work environment of nurses by exploring the way nurse perceptions {{about the extent to}} which the ward values and cares for their welfare influence their levels of affective ward commitment and job strain. Second, this study extends previous research on exchange relationships by examining the potential differential impact of social and economic <b>exchange</b> relationships on <b>commitment</b> and job strain. Design A cross-sectional survey among nurses. Methods The study was conducted in the Netherlands in 2011. Validated measures of climate for well-being, social exchange, economic <b>exchange,</b> ward <b>commitment</b> and job strain were used. Hypotheses were tested using regression analyses. MacKinnon et al. 's (2007) guidelines to assess mediation were used. Results The response rate was 41 % (271 questionnaires). The results show that climate for well-being positively influences social exchange relationships, which are in turn associated with enhanced ward commitment and reduced strain. Climate for well-being negatively influences evaluations of economic exchange, which are in turn negatively related to ward commitment. Conclusion This study shows that nurses use the information available in their immediate work environment to evaluate their exchange relationship with the organization. Second, the findings point towards the importance of economic and social exchange relationships as a mechanism between climate for well-being on the one hand and affective ward commitment and job strain on the other hand...|$|R

40|$|Two parties, A and B, want {{to sign a}} {{contract}} C over a communication network. To do so, they must “simultaneously” <b>exchange</b> their <b>commitments</b> to C. Since simultaneous exchange is usually impossible in practice, protocols are needed to approximate simultaneity by <b>exchanging</b> partial <b>commitments</b> in piece by piece manner. During such a protocol, one party or another may have a slight advantage; a “fair” protocol keeps this advantage within acceptable limits. We present a new protocol that is fair in the sense that, at any stage in its execution, the conditional probability that one party cannot commit both parties to the contract given that the other party can, is close to zero. This is true even if A and B have vastly different computing powers, and is proved under very weak cryptographic assumptions. Our protocol has the following additional properties: 4 during the procedure the parties exchange probadilistic options for committing both parties to the contract; the protocol never terminates in an asymmetric situation where party A knows that party B {{is committed to the}} contract while he is not; the protocol makes use of a weak form of a third party (judge). If both A and B are honest, the judge will never be called upon. Otherwise, the judge rules by performing a simple computation. No bookkeeping is required of the judge...|$|R
