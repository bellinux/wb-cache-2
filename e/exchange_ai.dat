40|$|Abstract. We {{describe}} {{an experience of}} transfer and ideas <b>exchange</b> between <b>AI</b> and FCA. The original motivation was a data analysis problem in which there were objects, structured attributes together with a categorization of objects, lead-ing {{to the idea that}} in some way the categorization should alter the selection of interesting patterns. On one hand, soon it appeared that to investigate the data it was interesting to use various degrees of coarseness not only on the pattern language but also on the extensions, i. e. the support, following the data mining terminology, of the patterns. On an other hand, closed patterns are known to sum-marize the whole set of frequent patterns, and FCA proposes to organize these closed patterns into a concept lattice, each node of which was a pair made of a closed pattern and its extension, but there were no known way to use categoriza-tion and relative coarseness in a flexible way. On the FCA technical side, this led us in particular to extend concept lattices to smaller conceptual structures, called abstract concept lattices, in which the extension of a term/motif/pattern in a set of objects is constrained by an external a priori view of the data together with...|$|R
40|$|The {{study of}} {{partially}} ionized plasmas {{is important in}} a number of astrophysical situations and is vital for the study of laboratory plasmas. The interactions between a neutral gas and a plasma define a hybrid medium that has aspects of each, but does not only sustain the pure modes of the individual species. Previously we have shown that momentum coupling between the gas and the magnetized plasma alters the behaviour of both; as an extension of that simulation, we present results for the extension to the coupling in which the relative motion between the species provides enough kinetic energy in the flow to allow a measure of species <b>exchange</b> Alfvén ionization (<b>AI)</b> (also known as critical velocity ionization), allowing the ionization fraction to evolve as the dynamics evolve...|$|R

The synthesis of Cs-aluminosilicate mica, with potential {{applications in the}} management of nuclear wastes, has been achieved for the first time by this approach. Ion exchange by Li +, Na + and alkaline-earth cations under hydrothermal conditions did not produce anhydrous mica phases but resulted in hydrous phases with one or two layers of water molecules between the clay layers, The formation of hydrous phases may be attributed to the high hydration energy of the above cations compared to K +, NH 4 +, RB + and Cs +. Ion <b>exchange</b> with <b>AI</b> 3 + produced a chlorite-like phase because of the hydrolysis of AI 3 + under these hydrothermal conditions. These studies are of relevance in the immobilization fwastes where hazardous ions can be fixed in highly stable insoluble phases like mica or chlorite.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Surface excess isotherms were {{determined}} for the adsorption of 1, 4 -dioxan (DIOX), tetrahydropyran (THP) and tetrahydrofuran (THF) from binary solution with methanol (MeOH) on AI 3 § and Cr 3 § montmorillonite containing different amounts of pre-adsorbed water. The isotherm type {{is dominated by}} the binary mixture whereas the amplitude, which follows the sequence DIOX> THP> THF, is further influenced by the <b>exchange</b> cation, <b>AI</b> 3 §> Cr 3 +, and the water content of the clay. The sorption of DIOX and THP from MeOH exhibit a type IV isotherm in the Schay-Nagy classification on both cation-exchanged forms, whilst that of THF from MeOH is of type I and THF is the preferred adsorbate. The azeotropic point for the type IV isotherms i close to a 1 : 1 mole ratio for the samples dried at 120 ~ but when the samples are rehydrated at 12 % r. h. following thermal pretreatment at 120 ~ the azeotropic point shifts in favour of the cyclic ethers DIOX and THP, making them the preferred component over {{a substantial portion of the}} composition range. As the number and diversity of reactions catalysed by trivalent cation-exchanged montmorillonites grows, so too does the realization that little information is available concerning both the dynamic and steady-state b haviour of these reaction systems.

40|$|Abstract [...] The {{adsorption}} {{mechanism of}} iso-propyiammonium (PAH*), the cationic omponent ofRoundup, by various homoionic montmorillonites and the structures ofthe associations {{obtained in the}} interlayer space were investigated, using infrared, X-ray, and carbon analysis methods. Adsorption from aqueous and ethanol solutions of Roundup was studied. The infrared spectra were compared with those obtained by the treatment of montmorillonites with ethanol and CCI~ solutions of the free iso-propylamine (PA). The adsorption of PA from ethanol gives rise to protonation ofthe amine. PA sorbed from CC 14 solution forms an ammonium-amine association. Adsorption ofPAH + from alcohol solution of Roundup occurs by the mechanism ofcation exchange. With transition metal exchangeable cations, PAH + is sorbed in excess, forming hydrogen bonds between NH 3 + groups and hydroxyls resulting from dissociation ofwater molecules. The process of adsorption ofPAH + from aqueous solutions of Roundup depends on the concentration ftbe solution. If montmorillonite is reacted with 0. 5 % solution of Roundup, PAH + is adsorbed by exchanging metal cations and the adsorption capacity of the clay does not exceed the c. e. c. If the montmorillonite s reacted with 5. 0 % solution of Roundup, the PAH + exchanges protons originating from the hydrolysis of the interlayer water. Protons which are transferred from the interlayer space to the water solution are accepted by the anion component ofRoundup. The amounts ofPAH + adsorbed from concentrated Roundup solutions are {{much higher than the}} cation exchange capacity of montmoriUonite. Hydrogen bonds are formed between the ammonium and water or hydroxyl groups on the interlayer space. With the trivalent <b>exchange</b> ions <b>AI</b> and Fe, which tend to polymerize inthe interlayer space, excess orption gives rise to hydrogen bonding of NH 3 + to oxygen of the polymer...|$|R
