We present a technique for automatic the detection and {{classification of}} cardiac arrhythmias using biorthogonal wavelet functions and support vector machines (SVM). For feature extraction the biorthogonal wavelet transforms are applied to decompose the ECG signal into wavelet scales. Further, a soft thresholding technique is used to denoise and extract important cardiac events in the signal. Subsequently, we applied SVM classifier to discriminate the detected event features into normal or pathological ones.

Despite this, studies on game development processes are relatively scarce on the scientific field. Game development is a subset of software development, but methodologies for traditional software production do not always fit with the unique challenges of making games. This thesis evaluates using retrospective meetings from agile methodologies in a game development context. The ultimate purpose is to learn whether retrospective meetings alone, without other parts of an agile framework, can help game development teams improve their production methods and work processes. Research was conducted as a case study in a game development company. The case study consisted of pre-study interviews, followed by several rounds of iteration retrospective meetings as well as two longer project retrospective meetings known as postmortems. Data was collected from the retrospectives throughout the study. A post-study questionnaire with open and structured questions was also used to measure employees’ attitudes towards retrospectives and postmortems {{at the end of the}} study. Multiple data sources indicated that employees of the company felt that retrospectives were useful and that their use should be a permanent part of the company’s processes.

METHODS: A systematic search of articles between January 1990 and June 2011 was conducted using EMBASE, Ovid MEDLINE, Evidence-Based Medicine Reviews-ACP Journal Club, the Cochrane Library and EBM Reviews. Studies investigating the efficacy of MTX as a single immunosuppressant medication in the treatment of ACU refractory to therapy with topical treatment and/or systemic treatment in children (≤ 16 years) were eligible for inclusion. The primary outcome measure was the improvement of intraocular inflammation, expressed as Tyndall, as defined by the Standardization of Uveitis Nomenclature working group criteria. The effect measure for each study was the proportion of people classified as responders. We determined a combined estimate of the proportion of children in the eligible studies responding to MTX.

40|$|The strong {{relationship}} between cigarette smoking and cardiovascular disease (CVD) has been well-documented, but the mechanisms by which smoking increases CVD risk appear to be multifactorial and incompletely understood. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are regarded as an important candidate for cell-based therapy in CVD. We hypothesized that MSCs derived from induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC-MSCs) or bone marrow (BM-MSCs) might alleviate cigarette smoke (CS) -induced cardiac injury. This study aimed to investigate the effects of BM-MSCs or iPSC-MSCs on CS-induced changes in serum and cardiac lipid profiles, oxidative stress and inflammation as well as cardiac function in a rat model of passive smoking. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly selected for exposure to either sham air (SA) as control or 4 % CS for 1 h per day for 56 days. On day 29 and 43, human adult BM-MSCs, iPSC-MSCs or PBS were administered intravenously to CS-exposed rats. Results from echocardiography, serum and cardiac lipid profiles, cardiac antioxidant capacity, cardiac pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines and cardiac morphological changes were evaluated {{at the end of}} treatment. iPSC-MSC-treated group showed a greater <b>effect</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>improvement</b> of CS-induced cardiac dysfunction over BM-MSCs-treated group as shown by increased percentage left ventricular ejection fraction and percentage fractional shortening, in line with the greater reversal of cardiac lipid abnormality. In addition, iPSC-MSCs administration attenuated CS-induced elevation of cardiac pro-inflammatory cytokines as well as restoration of anti-inflammatory cytokines and anti-oxidative markers, leading to ameliorate cardiac morphological abnormalities. These data suggest that iPSC-MSCs on one hand may restore CS-induced cardiac lipid abnormality {{and on the other hand}} may attenuate cardiac oxidative stress and inflammation via inhibition of CS-induced NF-κB activation, leading to improvement of cardiac remodeling and dysfunction. Thus, iPSC-MSCs may be a promising candidate in cell-based therapy to prevent cardiac complications in smokers...|$|E

The factors that trigger IPAH are poorly understood but an increase in reactive oxygen species in the circulation coincides with the onset of these conditions. Broiler chickens (n= 583) were fed a control diet (CTL), containing 3, 200 kcal of ME / kg of feed, 23 % CP, 1. 55 % (wt / wt) Arginine (Arg) and 40 IU of VE (alpha-tochopherol) / kg of feed; a high-Arg diet (HA), CTL diet plus 0. 8 % (wt / wt) supplemental L-Arg HCl; or a high Arg and vitamin diet (AEC), the HA diet plus 200 IU ?-tochopherol / kg of feed and 500 mg of ascorbic acid / L of drinking water 500 mg ascorbic acid / L of water (exp. 1 and 2) or Kg feed (exp. 3). Supplemented broilers were either exposed to hypobaric hypoxia or had a primary bronchus occluded (PBO) to induce PHS. Also, medial thickness was assessed in male broiler and Leghorn (n = 80) chickens fed a CTL diet and subjected to pulmonary artery occlusion (PAO). The results show that supplementation with Arg and VE plus VC have an additive effect on the velocity at which the pulmonary arterial pressure returned to basal levels in hypoxic chickens challenged with epinephrine. Also, supplementation increased xanthine oxidase (XO) activity {{in the vicinity of the}} pulmonary endothelium with no effect on NAD(P) H-oxidase activity or oxidative stress in hypoxic chickens subjected to PBO. These enzymes are upregulated in humans with IPAH. Furthermore, supplementation reduced pulmonary artery reactivity to phenylephrine in hypoxemic broilers. Unsupplemented broiler chickens had a lower specific lung weight compared to unsupplemented Leghorns. Hypoxemic broilers showed thicker resistant pulmonary arteries and were more hypertensive than hypoxemic Leghorns. Leghorns were more hypoxemic and resistant to PHS than broilers. In conclusion, Arg and VE plus VC show an additive <b>effect</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>improvement</b> of cardiovascular performance of hypoxemic broilers as well as in restoring reactivity to phenylephrine in hypoxemic pulmonary rings. Also, supplementation shows an additive effect in restoring XO activity in hypoxic broilers.

40|$|Graduation date: 1977 During the First World War, {{the need}} to secure a {{domestic}} supply of nitrate compounds necessary to the manufacture of explosives caused {{the federal government to}} undertake an extensive program of research and development of industrial nitrogen fixation processes. These government activities were to have far-reaching consequences {{for the development of the}} American chemical industry. At the outbreak of the war, Congress passed legislation appropriating 20, 000, 000 for the construction of plants which would produce nitrates for wartime use. Extensive study and review by various government agencies of currently available industrial nitrogen fixation processes led to the decision to build a synthetic ammonia plant using an experimental process developed by the General Chemical Company. The construction of a second plant was later authorized to use the process of the American Cyanamid Company. These two plants were. constructed near Florence, Alabama, and were completed just as the war ended. Three research facilities were established durinq the war by the Army Nitrate Abstract approved: aie 1) P. Jones Division, at Laurel Hill, New York, at Sheffield, Alabama and at Arlington Farms, Virginia. These three experiment stations did industrial research aimed at improving the synthetic ammonia process at Plant # 1, and succeeded in making a number of significant modifications in that process before the plants and these laboratories were closed at the war's end. While Congress argued about the disposition of these plants, the War Department established the Fixed Nitrogen Research Laboratory in Washington D. C. to perfect the synthetic ammonia process, and to find a peacetime use for the product of the cyanamid plant. This laboratory operated until 1926. Although congressional battles prevented the plants from benefiting from the Laboratory's research during its existence, that research was of major importance to the American fixed nitrogen industry. Due to the wartime research done on its process, the General Chemical Company was able to become the largest producer of ammonia in the United States within a few years. An improved ammonia synthesis catalyst was developed by the Fixed Nitrogen Research Laboratory, and a large body of data on all aspects of the ammonia synthesis reaction was collected which was then used in the following decade for theorectical studies of catalytic action. The Laboratory served as a training school for industrial chemists, and as a model for the kind of project-oriented team research which has since characterized industrial research activity. Thus, rather than serving only to provide an assured supply of explosives; as had been intended, the fixed nitrogen activities of the government proved to have their greatest <b>effect</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>improvement</b> of the American nitrogen fixation industry, and the economic growth of the country...|$|E

The microstructures and mechanical properties of as-cast and as-extruded Mg- 6 Li- 6. 5 Gd- 1 Dy- 2 Zn alloys were investigated. Extruding process refines the α(Mg) phase and β(Li) phase, {{and makes the}} Mg 3 X phase crushed and dispersed well. After heat treatment, Mg 3 X phase particles became finer and much more RE enriched phase particles formed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> matrix. These <b>effects</b> result <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>improvement</b> of mechanical properties of <b>the</b> alloys. <b>In</b> this study, after solution treated at 510 ℃ for 3 h and aged at 215 ℃ for 99 h, the as-extruded alloy exhibits the best mechanical properties, and the microhardness, ultimate tensile and elongation reach 103. 0, 249 MPa and 34. 8 %, respectively. Mg alloys have drawn much attention for their potential as structural materials with <b>the</b> usages <b>in</b> electric appliances, automobiles and aerospace, etc., because of its high specific strength and high specific stiffness[1 - 4]. The Mg-Gd-Dy-Zn alloys are the typical magnesium alloys with heat resistance and high strength. Zhang et. al have investigated the microstructures and mechanica...|$|R

40|$|Background: Morbidity, {{mortality}} {{and the costs}} of COPD form a large burden on the health system. A’ clinical practice guideline’ has a positive <b>effect</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>improvement</b> of processes of care and patient outcomes. Aim of the study: to investigate the effect of a digital Dutch College of General Practitioners (NHG) -practice guideline for COPD on the process of care. Research questions: 1. Is the percentage of indicators for the monitoring of COPD patients higher in practices where the practice nurse uses the NHG-Practice guideline (intervention group) then in practices where {{this is not the case}} (control group) ? 2. Is there a difference in the organisation of the COPD consultation between the intervention and the control group? 3. Which problems do the practice nurses encounter when using the digital version of the NHG-practice guideline? Setting and Methods: This is a cross-sectional comparative study between general practices with a practice nurse who uses the digital NHG- practice guideline versus general practices with a practice nurse who does not use the digital NHG-practice guideline. In each general practice 30 COPD patients were selected at random. In this study we used process and structure indicators to measure the quality of COPD care. We collected these outcomes from the digitized medical records of the patients and through a semi-structured questionnaire answered by the practice nurses. Descriptive statistics were used and the Mann-Whitney test was performed to test for statistical differences Results: Only one of the eleven process-indicators showed a significant difference; ‘registration of the GOLD stage in the medical record’, was done more often in the intervention (41, 8 %) than in the control group (24, 8 %). There was no difference in the organisation of the COPD consultation between the intervention and the control group. The groups made equal use of a recall system and standard letters. Also, the time spent by the nurse per COPD patient was the same in both groups. A few problems were reported by the nurses, mainly about logging into the digital NHG-practice guideline and problems with quickly finding information in the guideline. Conclusion: The NHG-practice guideline has no effect on the short term as to the frequency of monitoring of COPD disease between the two groups, except the registration of the GOLD stages in medical records. There was no significant difference in organisation of COPD consultation between the intervention and the control group. Evaluation of the NHG-practice guideline led to a few points for improving the guideline in the future such as: solving problems to log in and creating multiple options to quickly find information in the NHG- practice guideline. A suggestion for further research is to do a before and after study, and to investigate the implementation of the digital NHG-practice guideline not only on the short term but also on the long. And to investigate if the digital NHG-practice guideline improves on patients outcomes. ...|$|E

Besides, such men often bring their spirit of commerce into their estates with them, and make manufactures take a root, where the mere landed gentry had perhaps no capital, perhaps no inclination, and, most frequently, not sufficient knowledge, to effect anything of the kind. By these means, what beautiful and useful spots have there not been made about trading and manufacturing towns, and how has agriculture had reason to bless that happy alliance with commerce! and how miserable must that nation be, whose frame of polity has disjoined the landing and the trading interests! ...|$|R
40|$|Water {{plays an}} active role in many {{fundamental}} phenomena in cellular systems such as molecular recognition, folding and conformational equilibria, reaction kinetics and phase partitioning. Hence, our ability to account for the energetics of these processes is highly dependent on the models we use for calculating solvation effects. For example, theoretical prediction of protein-ligand binding modes (i. e., docking) and binding affinities (i. e., scoring) requires an accurate description of <b>the</b> change <b>in</b> hydration that accompanies solute binding. In this review, we discuss the challenges of constructing solvation models that capture these effects, with an emphasis on continuum models and on more recent developments <b>in</b> <b>the</b> field. <b>In</b> our discussion of methods, relatively greater attention will be given to boundary element solutions to the Poisson equation and to nonpolar solvation models, two areas that have become increasingly important but are likely to be less familiar to many readers. The other focus will be upon the trending efforts for evaluating solvation models in order to uncover limitations, biases, and potentially attractive directions for their <b>improvement</b> and applicability. <b>The</b> prospective and retrospective performance of a variety of solvation models <b>in</b> <b>the</b> SAMPL blind challenges will be discussed in detail.
