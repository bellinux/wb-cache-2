5|$|However, during Act V, {{there is}} no mention of Egeus, nor <b>does</b> <b>he</b> have a {{speaking}} role. It is logical, however, that he would have been in attendance since it is also his daughter Hermia's wedding that the group if there to celebrate.|$|E
5|$|The plot of {{the second}} film, , {{introduces}} a significant deviation from the book: Faramir does not at first let Frodo, Sam, and Gollum go, but decides to bring them and the Ring to Gondor. He takes them to Osgiliath and not until the Nazgûl attack the city and Frodo comes under the threat of capture <b>does</b> <b>he</b> release them.|$|E
5|$|Epaminondas was {{considered}} the greatest warrior-statesmen of ancient Thebes by many, including the Roman historian Diodorus Siculus. Diodorus does {{not have anything to}} say about the sexual orientation of Epaminondas or the Sacred Band, nor <b>does</b> <b>he</b> say anything about the following account, again from Plutarch (Amatorius 17). According to Plutarch's dramatic dialogue, Epaminondas had two male lovers: Asopichus and Caphisodorus, the latter died with him at Mantineia in battle. They were buried together, something usually reserved for a husband and wife in Greek society.|$|E

5|$|From the {{beginning}} of the novel, the narrator, and by extension McGregor, treats disorganized workers with scorn; from the miners of Coal Creek, to the downtrodden laborers of Chicago who are shown mastered by their bosses (unlike McGregor, who does not follow this trend). It is when McGregor comes back to Coal Creek to bury his mother and sees the usually jumbled miners marching in step as part of the funeral procession <b>does</b> <b>he</b> have an epiphany that together the workers are a powerful force, to be organized specifically by him. Indeed, this realization is foreshadowed in Chapter 3 of Book I when as a young man he sees a troupe of marching soldiers disperse a rowdy mob of miner's (and, as a consequence, save his family's bakery) during a strike.|$|E
5|$|Nikki, meanwhile, is {{determined}} to catch the actual thieves and bring forth the truth. After meeting Loudon, Nikki cons him into taking her shopping. After taking a Rolls Royce into Harlem to buy a gun– and nearly being arrested during a police raid– she explains her story to Loudon who believes that she is innocent, and decides to help her. She's also {{on the run from}} a pimp named Raoul (Coati Mundi) and his lackey Benny (Dennis Burkley), the people who killed Johnny. Only after dangling off a car smashed through the top floor of a parking garage, <b>does</b> <b>he</b> tell her the bank and the box number of Nikki's slain boyfriend.|$|E
5|$|Roman forces Sullivan to {{work with}} him in finding the treasure. Despite {{numerous}} warnings that the treasure and the island are haunted, Roman continues to use his men in search of the treasure. Roman captures Fisher, but Drake and Sullivan catch up to him, {{just in time to see}} Roman about to leave with the statue. However, Navarro tells Roman the real treasure is inside the statue. Roman opens the statue to collect the riches inside. As soon as Roman <b>does,</b> <b>he</b> is cursed and zombified. Apparently angered at this betrayal, Roman savagely charges towards Navarro, who shoots Roman in the head and reveals to Drake that he intended to sell the statue as a weapon the whole time.|$|E
6000|$|Then {{she turned}} {{fiercely}} on him, and fought him. He {{was not to}} do this to her, it was monstrous. What horrible hold <b>did</b> <b>he</b> want to have over her body? Why <b>did</b> <b>he</b> want to drag her down, and kill her spirit? Why <b>did</b> <b>he</b> want to deny her spirit? Why <b>did</b> <b>he</b> deny her spirituality, hold her for a body only? And was he to claim her carcase? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I know. But what <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>do?</b> How did the {{brainstorm}} burst? Did he jump at {{you from}} behind a door and bite a piece out of your leg, or <b>did</b> <b>he</b> say he was a teapot?" ...|$|R

5|$|The {{margin of}} the Empress Eudocia's copy of the Iliad has a note {{summarizing}} a Hellenistic poet who tells a different story of Orion's birth. Here the gods Zeus, Hermes, and Poseidon come to visit Hyrieus of Tanagra, who roasts a whole bull for them. When they offer him a favor, he asks {{for the birth of}} sons. The gods take the bull's hide and ejaculate or urinate into it and bury it in the earth, then tell him to dig it up ten months later. When he <b>does,</b> <b>he</b> finds Orion; this explains why Orion is earthborn.|$|E
5|$|The three {{families}} travel to a dude ranch in Wyoming. In the Pritchett family storyline, Gloria (Sofía Vergara) experiences hearing difficulty following the plane ride while a cowboy, Hank (Tim Blake Nelson), flirts with her. Gloria's husband, Jay (Ed O'Neill), takes notice, but Gloria is oblivious to his behavior. Later, Hank grabs Gloria's butt causing Jay {{to tell him}} to back off, which he <b>does.</b> <b>He</b> said {{if it were not for}} him being the bad guy Jay would not have been a hero, but Gloria fights back and says Jay is always a hero.|$|E
5|$|To crown {{all this}} , {{what is left}} but the amphitheatre? And this disgrace of the city you have as well—Gracchus not {{fighting}} as equipped as a Mirmillo, with buckler or falchion (for he condemns—yes, condemns and hates such equipment). Nor <b>does</b> <b>he</b> conceal his face beneath a helmet. See! he wields a trident. When he has cast without effect the nets suspended from his poised right hand, he boldly lifts his uncovered face to the spectators, and, easily to be recognized, flees across the whole arena. We can not mistake the tunic, since the ribbon of gold reaches from his neck, and flutters in the breeze from his high-peaked cap. Therefore, the disgrace, which the Secutor had to submit to, in being forced to fight with Gracchus, was worse than any wound.|$|E

If the latter, he {{certainly}} {{would not have been}} instigated by it to write to me such a letter as <b>he</b> <b>did.</b> <b>He</b> {{certainly would not}} have sent the paper to me had he felt it to contain a foul-mouthed calumny." ...|$|R

5|$|Van Gogh's gaze {{is seldom}} {{directed}} at the viewer. The portraits vary in intensity and colour, and in those painted after December 1888 especially, the vivid colours highlight the haggard pallor of his skin. Some depict the artist with a beard, others without. He can be seen with bandages in portraits executed just after he mutilated his ear. In only a few <b>does</b> <b>he</b> depict himself as a painter. Those painted in Saint-Rémy show the head from the right, the side opposite his damaged ear, as he painted himself reflected in his mirror.|$|E
5|$|As {{you long}} ago wrote me, {{and told me}} personally, nay predicted, Jackson has thrown me overboard; he is not only unwilling to give me employment, as he promised after I {{declined}} a reelection to Congress, but has in every single instance refused office to my friends, and even respectful consideration to my letters of recommendation to others. Nor <b>does</b> <b>he</b> stop here. I am at this moment enduring the whole weight of the opposition to him, his friends, and the power and patronage of his government to break down myself and my friends in Virginia, and to prevent my reelection to the office I now fill. Without having much reputation for political matters, I have read those folks at Washington thoroughly... I am not of a temper to pocket insult, neglect, or injury. I have, my dear friend, determined on my course. I can be as silent and patient as any of my aboriginal ancestors, and like them I feel that vengeance would be sweet, but when the day of retribution shall come, it will be marked by {{the effects of the}} tomahawk. You must know that notwithstanding all efforts to prevent it I calculate on a reelection. Then I will begin to formulate a message in which, as you know, my own principles will be maintained.|$|E
5|$|Later that night, Fung sends more killers to Kwai's {{refuge in}} order to {{eliminate}} Kwai's syndicate. A gunfight ensues, with the four men emerging victorious. As they escape, Kwai's syndicate lose track of Costello, who is walking through a crowded street, seemingly lost in the night rain. He pulls out the Polaroid pictures that he took of the hitmen earlier, and tries to find them in the crowd. They meet again, but it becomes evident that Costello {{has a problem with}} his memory, and has rapidly forgotten who his friends are, but also what he is doing. The hitmen try to explain to Costello that he is seeking revenge for his daughter, but Costello does not recognize her, nor <b>does</b> <b>he</b> understand the concept of revenge. The three men give up in despair, and take him to a beach where they meet a pregnant woman (Michelle Ye) with a group of children. Kwai gives her a stack of money and ask her to take care of Costello. Kwai's syndicate return to Macau because they lost contact with Kwai's cousin Tony who supplies their ammunition. When they reach the landfill where Tony is living, they find him and his partner dying as they were tortured by Fung and his gang. Soon, a large group of assassins sent by Fung show up and a gunfight ensues. Kwai, Chu and Fat Lok are killed. Costello and the pregnant woman learn of the shootout during a news report.|$|E

5|$|Throughout the poem, Gawain {{encounters}} numerous trials testing {{his devotion}} {{and faith in}} Christianity. When Gawain sets out on his journey to find the Green Chapel, he finds himself lost, and only after praying to the Virgin Mary <b>does</b> <b>he</b> find his way. As he continues his journey, Gawain once again faces anguish regarding his inevitable encounter with the Green Knight. Instead of praying to Mary, as before, Gawain places his faith in the girdle {{given to him by}} Bertilak's wife. From the Christian perspective, this leads to disastrous and embarrassing consequences for Gawain as he is forced to reevaluate his faith when the Green Knight points out his betrayal. Another interpretation sees the work in terms of the perfection of virtue, with the pentangle representing the moral perfection of the connected virtues, the Green Knight as Christ exhibiting perfect fortitude, and Gawain as slightly imperfect in fortitude by virtue of flinching when under the threat of death.|$|E
