5|$|Goebel {{played a}} role in a famous Ohio State-Illinois game on November 13, 1943. The game was Paul Brown's last game as coach of the Buckeyes. With the score tied 26–26, Ohio State threw an {{incomplete}} forward pass into the end zone as the gun sounded. The game appeared to have ended in a tie, the teams left the field, and the stands emptied. However, Ohio State assistant coach Ernie Godfrey had noticed Goebel, who was the head linesman, drop a handkerchief to signal a penalty. On hearing the gun sound, Goebel had picked up the <b>handkerchief</b> <b>and</b> put it back in his back pocket. Godfrey confronted Goebel, who conceded that Illinois was offsides. Twenty minutes later, the teams came back onto the field and the Buckeyes kicked a 33-yard field goal to give Coach Brown a 29–26 win in his final game.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Quagmire accidentally knocks over {{a carton}} of Kool-Aid mix {{on the kitchen floor}} of the Griffin's house and leaves Peter to take the blame. Frustrated with having to clean Peter's messes, Lois hires a Hispanic maid named Consuela to clean their house. But Consuela quickly proves to be very stubborn, refusing to leave after her work hours and {{sleeping}} at the Griffins' house overnight, much to Peter and Lois' annoyance. They try to fire her and even bribe her to leave, but she still refuses (though she takes the money they offer her anyway). In a last-ditch attempt, Peter finally gets rid of her by tricking her into inhaling chloroform on a <b>handkerchief,</b> <b>and</b> leaves her in a basket on Joe's front porch.|$|E
5|$|One {{man in the}} crowd, Leon Czolgosz, {{hoped to}} assassinate McKinley. He {{had managed to get}} close to the presidential podium, but did not fire, {{uncertain}} of hitting his target. Czolgosz, since hearing a speech by anarchist Emma Goldman in Cleveland, had decided to do something he believed would advance the cause. After his failure to get close enough on the fifth, Czolgosz waited the next day at the Temple of Music on the Exposition grounds, where the President was to meet the public. Czolgosz concealed his gun in a <b>handkerchief,</b> <b>and,</b> when he reached the head of the line, shot McKinley twice in the abdomen.|$|E

When A {{goes to the}} window to inspect Croker, however, he is {{surprised}} by something inexplicable that causes him to remove his <b>handkerchief</b> <b>and</b> bring it timidly to the would-be jumper’s face. Although critics Ackerley and Gontarski assert that A’s discovery is an “enigmatic smile” on Croker’s face, Beckett makes no mention of this in the ending, leaving it open to various interpretations such as Croker may be crying (justifying the handkerchief), smiling, was dead prior to A and B’s arrival or else died during the process.|$|E
25|$|Fort Sumter raised Wigfall's white {{handkerchief}} on its flagpole as Wigfall departed in {{his small}} boat back to Morris Island, where he was hailed as a hero. The handkerchief was spotted in Charleston and a delegation of officers representing BeauregardStephen D. Lee, Porcher Miles, a former mayor of Charleston, and Roger Pryorsailed to Sumter, unaware of Wigfall's visit. Anderson was outraged when these officers disavowed Wigfall's authority, telling him that the former senator had not spoken with Beauregard for two days, and he threatened to resume firing. Meanwhile, General Beauregard himself had finally seen the <b>handkerchief</b> <b>and</b> sent {{a second set of}} officers, offering essentially the same terms that Wigfall had presented, so the agreement was reinstated.|$|E

In the {{emotional}} climax of the opera, the Marschallin gracefully releases Octavian, encouraging him to follow his heart and love Sophie. She then withdraws elegantly to the next room to talk with Faninal. As soon as she is gone, Sophie and Octavian run to each other's arms. Faninal and the Marschallin return to find the lovers locked in an embrace. After a few bittersweet glances to her lost lover, the Marschallin departs with Faninal. Sophie and Octavian follow after another brief but ecstatic love duet (Ist ein Traum / Spür' nur dich), and the opera ends with little Mohammed running in to retrieve Sophie's dropped <b>handkerchief,</b> <b>and</b> racing out again after the departing nobility.|$|E

500|$|On 9 November 1858, the Bury and Norwich Post {{recorded}} {{that earlier}} that month, a waistcoat, silk <b>handkerchief,</b> <b>and</b> £3 in gold {{were stolen from}} a labourer, Richard Butcher, who lived in Stanford-le-Hope. Butcher had gone to Murrell, asking him to use his skills to locate and retrieve his stolen property; when Murrell failed to do so, Butcher turned to the police to apprehend the culprit. Other accounts were passed down in local folk accounts; Maple interviewed an eighty-six-year-old Mrs Petchey, who stated that [...] "My mother lost a brooch, and Murrell told her who had stolen it. It was her own sister-in-law. He wouldn't tell her, though, unless she promised not to tell anyone. The brooch was back in its old place a few days later." ...|$|E

500|$|Cambridge were pre-race favourites {{although}} former Oxford rower {{and author}} George Drinkwater {{noted that the}} public had been unaware of the significant improvements from Oxford following their transition to the Clasper vessel. Oxford won the toss and elected to start from the Surrey station, handing the Middlesex {{side of the river}} to Cambridge. [...] The race started at 5:39 p.m. and quickly descended into chaos: darkness was falling and it became quickly apparent that the Cambridge crew had not heard the command to [...] "go" [...] from the starter Searle. [...] By now, according to Oxford's bow G. C. Bourne, [...] he was [...] "old with a feeble voice", and although the Oxford stroke L. R. West saw Searle drop his <b>handkerchief,</b> <b>and</b> set off, the Cambridge boat did not move.|$|E
500|$|Officers also searched 5Eaton Row, {{into which}} Lucan had moved early in 1973, and after {{interviewing}} [...] his mother (who {{had called to}} take the children to her home in StJohn's Wood), his last address at 72aElizabeth Street. Nothing untoward was found; on the bed, a suit and shirt lay alongside a book on Greek shipping millionaires, and Lucan's wallet, car keys, money, driving licence, <b>handkerchief</b> <b>and</b> spectacles were on a bedside table. His passport was in a drawer and his blue Mercedes-Benz parked outside, its engine cold and its battery flat. Ranson then visited Veronica Lucan at St George's Hospital. Although heavily sedated, {{she was able to}} describe what had happened to her. A police officer was left to guard her, should her assailant return. Rivett's body was taken to the mortuary, and a search was undertaken of all local basement areas and gardens, skips and open spaces.|$|E
500|$|The {{triangular}} {{positioning of}} three figures became {{something of a}} vogue in prints of the mid-1790s. [...] The [...] "Three Beauties of the Kansei Era" [...] normally refer to the three who appear in this print; on occasion, Utamaro replaced Toyohina with Kikumoto O-Han. [...] Utamaro placed the three beauties in the same composition {{three or four years}} later in a print called Three Beauties, in which Hisa holds a teacup saucer in her left hand rather than a <b>handkerchief,</b> <b>and</b> Kita holds her fan in both hands. [...] To Eiji Yoshida, the figures in this print lack the personalities that were the charm of the earlier. [...] Yoshida thought less of the further undifferentiated personalities of a later print with the same triangular composition, Three Beauties Holding Bags of Snacks, published by Yamaguchiya. [...] As testimony to their popularity, the three models often appeared in the works of other artists, and Utamaro continued to use them in other prints, individually or in pairs.|$|E

500|$|Two {{weeks later}} William Whatton replied. He disputed Weatherill's {{claim that the}} only action taken to staunch the blood flow had been the <b>handkerchief,</b> <b>and</b> pointed out that his first action on arrival at Eccles vicarage had been to seal Huskisson's femoral artery. He stated that he had great {{experience}} with similar injuries from his time as an army doctor during the Peninsular War, and that [...] "none of them [...] would have ventured upon an operation where the chances were so decidedly against its success". He {{pointed out that the}} survival rate for amputations among soldiers with similar injuries—considerably healthier than the elderly Huskisson—was no better than 15% when attempted immediately after the injury. Instead, he cited the advice of leading surgeon George James Guthrie that amputation was not generally survivable until the patient's pulse had stabilised and the initial shock settled. Whatton pointed out that Huskisson's pulse did not stabilise and that he was in convulsions for the entire time Whatton attended him.|$|E
500|$|Seydlitz's {{first months}} as a cornet were made {{difficult}} by the regimental colonel, who considered him a spy for the Margrave, and abused him by sending him on useless errands and generally {{making it clear}} that the cornet was no match for the colonel. Within a year of Seydlitz's commission, the old King Frederick William died and his son, Frederick II of Prussia, ascended to the throne. [...] Frederick claimed Silesia from the Habsburg's Maria Theresa, and made a broad appeal to arms. [...] The Margrave's regiment {{played an important role in}} the ensuing war, during which Seydlitz came to the notice of the King several times. Once, when Frederick asked the caliber of the artillery shelling the Prussian line, opinions were divided and vague. Seydlitz rode in front of the battery, halting in their line of fire. When he saw a ball hit the ground, he picked it up, wrapped it in his <b>handkerchief</b> <b>and</b> presented it to the King.|$|E

The song was also produced by Mike Dean, along with being written by William Roberts, Sean Anderson, Kanye West, and Dijon McFarlane. Betty Wright lent her vocal talent to the song during a late night studio session she did {{as a favor to}} DJ Khaled in order for him to meet a deadline. She recorded the hook in fifteen minutes while sitting on a sofa [...] In the song, West raps about how he feels about people playing up his earlier works and dismiss who he is now, before saying that he's not going to worry about it. Then later he says, [...] "Wipe my forehead with a <b>handkerchief</b> <b>and</b> wash my sins in the blood of Jesus, People sayin', 'Ye, we need another Yeezus."
