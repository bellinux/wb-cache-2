40|$|Several axi-symmetric EN 3 B steel {{components}} differing {{in shape}} and size were forged on a 100 ton joint <b>knuckle</b> <b>press.</b> A load cell fitted under the lower die inserts recorded the total deformation forces. Job parameters were measured off the billets and the forged parts. Slug temperatures were varied and two lubricants - aqueous colloidal graphite and oil - were used. An industrial study was also conducted to check {{the results of the}} laboratory experiments. Loads were measured (with calibrated extensometers attached to the press frames) when adequately heated mild steel slugs were being forged in finishing dies. Geometric parameters relating to the jobs and the dies were obtained from works drawings. All the variables considered in the laboratory study could not, however, be investigated without disrupting production. In spite of this obvious limitation, the study confirmed that parting area is the most significant geometric factor influencing the forging load. Multiple regression analyses of the laboratory and industrial results showed that die loads increase significantly with the weights and parting areas of press forged components, and with the width to thickness ratios of the flashes formed, but diminish with increasing slug temperatures and higher billet diameter to height ratios. The analyses also showed that more complicated parts require greater loads to forge them. Die stresses, due to applied axial loads, were investigated by the photoelastic method. The three dimensional frozen stress technique was employed. Model dies were machined from cast araldite cylinders, and the slug material was simulated with plasticene. Test samples were cut from the centres of the dies after the stress freezing. Examination of the samples, and subsequent calculations, showed that the highest stresses were developed in die outer corners. This observation partly explains why corner cracking occurs frequently in industrial forging dies. Investigation of die contact during the forging operation revealed the development of very high stresses...|$|E

40|$|The article {{raises an}} issue to enhance {{technological}} forging capabilities on the known <b>knuckle</b> joint <b>presses.</b> It provides an illustrated overview of main design types of presses with crank-knuckle, toggle-knuckle, and knuckle joint mechanisms. The article also shows {{the advantages of}} the modernization way and improvement just of the active press equipment in terms of quality-to-price ratio, for example, as compared to the similar new foreign press equipment. It gives an overview of features, which provide forging processes owing to kinetic energy accumulated with the moving parts of the known designs of the <b>knuckle</b> joint <b>presses</b> depending on the drive actuating mechanism. Focused attention is drawn to forging on the <b>knuckle</b> joint <b>presses</b> for a time of contact with a work piece to be comparable with the duration of the work piece deformation process on hydraulic forging hammers. This allows us to forge thin-wall products with process automation compared to the forging hammers. Analysis of accumulating processes of kinetic energy by the moving parts of the <b>knuckle</b> joint <b>presses</b> has shown that presses driven by hydraulic cylinders or two screw hydraulic cylinder are the most optimal for technological operations as evidenced by references to domestic and foreign invention certificates and patents. The article presents disadvantages of forging on presses with hydraulic or pneumatic drive. It is a dependence of the deformation force, caused, mainly, by a force of the drive cylinder. The article gives linear movement rate quantities of press moving members depending on the drives of the actuating mechanism. Based on the above analysis of the features to manufacture work pieces on the <b>knuckle</b> joint <b>presses,</b> the article gives the rationale for the relevance of forging {{in a short period of}} time, provided that the moving parts of the press accumulate the required kinetic energy. This can be achieved only through modernization and improvement of forging equipment designs, in particular, using modern industrial hydraulics facilities, software and hardware systems for industrial automation. </p...|$|R

60|$|Imber {{was drawn}} to him at once. The fire leaped into his eyes at sight of a sabre slash that scarred his cheek. He ran a {{withered}} hand down the young fellow's leg and caressed the swelling thew. He smote the broad chest with his <b>knuckles,</b> and <b>pressed</b> and prodded the thick muscle-pads that covered the shoulders like a cuirass. The group had been added to by curious passers-by--husky miners, mountaineers, and frontiersmen, sons of the long-legged and broad-shouldered generations. Imber glanced from one to another, then he spoke aloud in the Whitefish tongue.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{dynamic analysis}} of a <b>knuckle</b> joint <b>press</b> by using CAE tool. The {{purpose of this study}} is to make it easy for engineers to predict the dynamics of the knucklejoint press. These predictions are essential for the optimal design of its mechanical system. At firs, we developed a computer aided design system for the analysis introducing dynamic simulation software named Working Model. In this system, Working Model is linked to other applications such as CAD and Excel in order to make it easy to draw a diagram of the analytical model and to analyze data generated by simulations. Then we performed the experiments of the knucklejoint press, and compared the experimental results with the simulation results to verifyã€€that this simulation results show accurately the dynamic characteristics of the actual machine. Finally we investigated the fluctuation in rotating speed and the effect of flywheel...|$|R
