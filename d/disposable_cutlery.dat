2500|$|Polystyrene (PS) [...] is a {{synthetic}} aromatic polymer {{made from the}} monomer styrene. Polystyrene can be solid or foamed. General-purpose polystyrene is clear, hard, and rather brittle. It is an inexpensive resin per unit weight. It is a rather poor barrier to oxygen and water vapour and has a relatively low melting point. Polystyrene {{is one of the}} most widely used plastics, the scale of its production being several million tonnes per year. Polystyrene can be naturally transparent, but can be coloured with colourants. Uses include protective packaging (such as packing peanuts and CD and DVD cases), containers (such as [...] "clamshells"), lids, bottles, trays, tumblers, <b>disposable</b> <b>cutlery.</b> and in the making of models.|$|E

50|$|Plastic cutlery is {{made for}} {{disposable}} use, and is frequently used outdoors for camping, excursions, and barbecues for instance. Plastic cutlery is also commonly used at fast-food or take-away outlets and provided with airline meals in economy class. Wooden <b>disposable</b> <b>cutlery</b> is also available as a biodegradable alternative.|$|E
50|$|Introduced for {{convenience}} purposes (lightweight, no cleanup after the meal required), <b>disposable</b> <b>cutlery</b> {{made of plastic}} has become a huge worldwide market. Along with other disposable tableware (paper plates, plastic table covers, disposable cups, paper napkins, etc.), these products have become essential for the fast food and catering industry. The products are emblematic of throw-away societies {{and the cause of}} millions of tons of non-biodegradable plastic waste.|$|E
5000|$|The city {{immediately}} began {{a campaign to}} collect donations for the homeless, stressing {{the urgent need for}} donations of toothbrushes, towels, glasses, <b>cutlery,</b> <b>disposable</b> dishes and especially drinking water. Also a bank account was opened to receive donations in cash. [...] Additionally, all municipal events since the day of the disaster until 16 November have been canceled. The note from the Mayor's Office said that [...] "at this point, the city of Mariana is focused on rescue work and support to hit".|$|R
5000|$|ANTM allowed Petrack {{to follow}} Judaism's kosher food laws; they allotted her a weekly budget to {{purchase}} food of her choice and <b>disposable</b> plates and <b>cutlery.</b> According to her mother, she [...] "toveled" [...] pots (Judaism's ritual to purify dishes made of certain materials) in the Pacific Ocean. In the episode of October 20, an entire segment {{was devoted to}} Petrack's Judaism {{and the degree to}} which it differentiated her from the other girls. During the segment, Jane Randall asked her to say something in Hebrew (she responded, [...] "Shmi Esther—"My name is Esther") and the camera zoomed on the cabinet marked, [...] "Esther's Stuff," [...] containing all of her kosher materials. Some blogs favored her involvement, others did not.|$|R
40|$|Biodegradable nanocomposites were {{prepared}} by adding ZnO nanoparticles to bacterial polyester poly(3 -hydroxybutyrate-co- 3 -hydroxyvalerate) (PHBV) via solution casting technique. The morphology, thermal, mechanical, antibacterial, barrier, and migration {{properties of the}} nanocomposites were analyzed. The nanoparticles were uniformly dispersed within PHBV {{without the aid of}} coupling agents, and acted effectively as nucleating agents, raising the crystallization temperature and the level of crystallinity of the matrix while decreasing its crystallite size. A gradual rise in thermal stability was found with increasing ZnO loading, since the nanofillers hinder the diffusion of volatiles generated during the decomposition process. The nanocomposites displayed superior stiffness, strength, toughness, and glass transition temperature, whereas they displayed reduced water uptake and oxygen and water vapor permeability compared to the neat biopolymer, related to the strong matrix-nanofiller interfacial adhesion attained via hydrogen bonding interactions. At an optimal concentration of 4. 0 wt % ZnO, the tensile strength and Young's and storage moduli showed a maximum that coincided with the highest crystallinity and the best barrier properties. PHBV/ZnO films showed antibacterial activity against human pathogen bacteria, and the effect on Escherichia coli was stronger than on Staphylococcus aureus. The overall migration levels of the nanocomposites in both nonpolar and polar simulants dropped upon increasing nanoparticle content, and were well below the limits required by the current normative for food packaging materials. These sustainable nanomaterials with antimicrobial function are very promising to be used as containers for beverage and food products as well as for <b>disposable</b> applications like <b>cutlery</b> or overwrap films.

5000|$|Polystyrene is {{manufactured}} {{in various forms}} that have different applications. Extruded polystyrene (PS) {{is used in the}} manufacture of <b>disposable</b> <b>cutlery,</b> CD and DVD cases, plastic models of cars and boats, and smoke detector housings. Expanded polystyrene foam (EPS) is used in making insulation and packaging materials, such as the [...] "peanuts" [...] and molded foam used to cushion fragile products. Extruded polystyrene foam (XPS), known by the trade name Styrofoam, is used to make architectural models and drinking cups for heated beverages. Polystyrene copolymers are used in the manufacture of toys and product casings.|$|E

5000|$|Prehistorically, and in less technologically {{advanced}} cultures even into modern times, tool and weapon blades {{have been made}} from wood, bone and stone. Most woods are exceptionally poor at holding edges and bone and stone suffer from brittleness making them suffer from fracture when striking or struck. In modern times stone, {{in the form of}} obsidian, is used in some medical scalpels as it is capable of being formed into an exceedingly fine edge. Ceramic knives are non-metallic and non-magnetic. As non-metals do not corrode they remain rust and corrosion free but they suffer from similar faults as stone and bone, being rather brittle and almost entirely inflexible. They are harder than metal knives and so more difficult to sharpen, and some ceramic knives may be as hard or harder than some sharpening stones. For example, synthetic sapphire [...] is harder than natural sharpening stones and is as hard as alumina sharpening stones. Zirconium dioxide is also harder than garnet sharpening stones and is nearly as hard as alumina. Both require diamond stones or silicon carbide stones to sharpen and care has to be taken to avoid chipping the blade. As such ceramic knives are seldom used outside of a kitchen and they are still quite uncommon. Plastic knives are difficult to make sharp and poorly retain an edge. They are largely used as low cost, disposable utensils or as children's utensils or occasionally in environments where it is considered that even a bread and butter knife would be undesirable. They are often serrated to make up for their general lack of sharpness but, as evidenced by the fact they can cut food, they are still capable of inflicting injury. Plastic blades of designs other than <b>disposable</b> <b>cutlery</b> are, as they are undetectable by metal detectors, restricted/illegal items or prohibited weapons in some jurisdictions.|$|E
40|$|Poly(1 -phenylethene), {{commonly}} referred to as Polystyrene, is one of the world’s most common polymers. Made from the monomer styrene (ethenylbenzene), this polymer is used {{in a wide range of}} products from packing peanuts to <b>disposable</b> <b>cutlery.</b> The method of polymerization used in this research project is called admicellar polymerization. This process consists of four main steps: admicelle formation, adsolubilization, polymerization, and removal of admicelle and polymer. Admicellar polymerization has a number of advantages over related methods of thin film polymerization including simplicity and low cost of components and process...|$|E
