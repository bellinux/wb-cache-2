25|$|Today, {{computers}} {{are widely used}} {{in many areas of}} applied linguistics. Speech synthesis and speech recognition use phonetic and phonemic knowledge to provide voice interfaces to computers. Applications of computational linguistics <b>in</b> <b>machine</b> <b>translation,</b> computer-assisted translation, and natural language processing are areas of applied linguistics that have come to the forefront. Their influence has had an effect on theories of syntax and semantics, as modelling syntactic and semantic theories on computers constraints.|$|E
2500|$|Modern {{dependency}} grammars, however, begin {{primarily with}} the work of Lucien Tesnière. Tesnière was a Frenchman, a polyglot, and a professor of linguistics at the universities in Strasbourg and Montpellier. His major work Éléments de syntaxe structurale was published posthumously in 1959 – he died in 1954. The basic approach to syntax he developed seems to have been seized upon independently by others in the 1960s {{and a number of other}} dependency-based grammars have gained prominence since those early works. DG has generated a lot of interest in Germany in both theoretical syntax and language pedagogy. In recent years, the great development surrounding dependency-based theories has come from computational linguistics and is due, in part, to the influential work that David Hays did <b>in</b> <b>machine</b> <b>translation</b> at the RAND Corporation in the 1950s and 1960s. Dependency-based systems are increasingly being used to parse natural language and generate tree banks. Interest in dependency grammar is growing at present, international conferences on dependency linguistics being a relatively recent development ( [...] , , [...] ).|$|E

Log-linear models {{represent}} nowadays the state-of-the-art <b>in</b> statistical <b>machine</b> <b>translation.</b> There, several {{models are}} combined altogether {{into a whole}} statistical approach. Finite-state transducers constitute a special type of statistical translation model whose interest has been proved in different translation tasks. The goal of this work is to introduce a finite-state framework for a log-linear modelling approach <b>in</b> statistical <b>machine</b> <b>translation.</b> Results for a French-English technical translation task show the convenience of the proposed methods. ...|$|R

40|$|Even though {{multilingual}} {{communities that}} use <b>machine</b> <b>translation</b> to overcome language barriers are increasing, we still lack a {{complete understanding of}} how <b>machine</b> <b>translation</b> affects communication. <b>In</b> this study, eight pairs from three different language communities–China, Korea, and Japan–worked on referential tasks in their shared second language (English) and in their native languages using a <b>machine</b> <b>translation</b> embedded chat system. Drawing upon prior research, we predicted differences in conversational efficiency and content, and in the shortening of referring expressions over trials. Quantitative results combined with interview data show that lexical entrainment was disrupted <b>in</b> <b>machine</b> translation-mediated communication because echoing is disrupted by asymmetries <b>in</b> <b>machine</b> <b>translations.</b> <b>In</b> addition, the process of shortening referring expressions is also disrupted because the translations do not translate the same terms consistently throughout the conversation. To support natural referring behavior <b>in</b> <b>machine</b> translation-mediated communication, we need to resolve asymmetries and inconsistencies caused by <b>machine</b> <b>translations...</b>|$|R

These unknown words could be abbreviations, names, acronyms and newly introduced terms. We have proposed an algorithm for the resolution of the unidentified words. This algorithm takes discourse unit (primitive discourse) as a unit of analysis and provides real time updates to the lexicon. We have manually applied the algorithm to news paper fragments. Along with anaphora and cataphora resolution, many unknown words especially names and abbreviations were updated to the lexicon. I...|$|R
40|$|Many <b>machine</b> <b>translation</b> {{evaluation}} metrics {{have been}} proposed after the seminal BLEU metric, and many among them {{have been found to}} consistently outperform BLEU, demonstrated by their better correlations with human judgment. It has long been the hope that by tuning <b>machine</b> <b>translation</b> systems against these new generation metrics, advances <b>in</b> automatic <b>machine</b> <b>translation</b> evaluation can lead directly to advances <b>in</b> automatic <b>machine</b> <b>translation.</b> However, to date there has been no unambiguous report that these new metrics can improve a state-of-theart <b>machine</b> <b>translation</b> system over its BLEUtuned baseline. In this paper, we demonstrate that tuning Joshua, a hierarchical phrase-based statistical <b>machine</b> <b>translation</b> system, with the TESLA metrics results in significantly better humanjudged translation quality than the BLEUtuned baseline. TESLA-M in particular is simple and performs well in practice on large datasets. We release all our implementation under an open source license. It is our hope that this work will encourage the <b>machine</b> <b>translation</b> community to finally move away from BLEU as the unquestioned default and to consider the new generation metrics when tuning their systems. ...|$|R
