40|$|Abstract We present new {{techniques}} for computing exact distributions of `Friedman-type¿ statistics. Representing the null distribution by a generating function {{allows for the}} use of general, not necessarily integer-valued rank scores. Moreover, we use symmetry properties of the multivariate generating function to accelerate computations. The methods also work for cases with ties and for permutation statistics. We discuss some applications: the classical <b>Friedman</b> rank <b>test,</b> the normal scores <b>test,</b> the <b>Friedman</b> permutation <b>test,</b> the Cochran¿Cox test and the Kepner¿Robinson test. Finally, we shortly discuss self-made software for computing exact p-values.

50|$|Legendre {{discusses}} {{a variant}} of the W statistic which accommodates ties in the rankings and also describes methods of making significance tests based on W. Legendre compared via simulation the <b>Friedman</b> <b>test</b> and its permutation version. Unfortunately,the simulation study of Legendre was very limited because it considered neither the copula aspect nor the F test. Kendall W is a rank-based correlation measure, and therefore it is not affected by the marginal distributions of the underlying variables, but only by the copula of the multivariate distribution. Marozzi extended the simulation study of Legendre by considering the copula aspect as well as the F test. It is shown that the <b>Friedman</b> <b>test</b> is too conservative and less powerful than both the F test and the permutation test for concordance which always have a correct size and behave alike. The F test should be preferred because it is computationally much easier. Surprisingly, the power function of thetests is not much affected by the type of copula.|$|E
