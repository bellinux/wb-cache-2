5|$|Potter {{intended}} to follow Mrs. Tittlemouse with a tale about a pig {{in a large}} format book similar to the original Ginger and Pickles. On one occasion, she passed an hour sketching inside the pig sty at Hill Top while the pig nibbled at <b>her</b> <b>boots.</b> She abandoned the pig book after fruitless attempts to make progress on it, and, instead, occupied the winter of 191011 with supervising the production of Peter Rabbit's Painting Book, and the composition of The Tale of Timmy Tiptoes.|$|E
25|$|Because several {{articles}} of the clothing the victim had worn {{at the time}} of her murder had been manufactured outside of America, she was theorized to have been a native of a country such as Spain or Canada, as <b>her</b> <b>boots</b> and jacket were made in these respective areas. Other articles of clothing included cutoff shorts from Massachusetts. Other articles of clothing worn by the victim included a leather belt and a sweater. A buckle on the belt was made of brass and the victim wore two metal rings; one white, and one yellow in color. The yellow ring contained a red stone and the white ring bore Native American designs and was created in Mexico.|$|E

25|$|In March 2010, Kim competed at the 2010 World Championships in Turin, Italy. Kim {{said she}} had {{struggled}} with finding the motivation to compete at the World Championships after winning the {{gold medal at the}} Olympic Games. Kim placed seventh in the short program with 60.30 points. She opened with a triple lutz–triple toe loop combination, but had problems with her layback spin and spiral sequence after unseen problems with <b>her</b> <b>boots.</b> She rebounded in the free skate to win the program with 130.49 points completing a triple lutz–triple toe loop combination, a triple flip, a double axel–double toe loop–double loop combination, a double axel–triple toe loop combination and a triple lutz, but having trouble with her triple salchow and double axel.

25|$|While {{she enjoyed}} primary school, Manson was bullied while {{in her first}} year at {{secondary}} school, causing her to suffer from depression and body dysmorphic disorder and engage in self-injury: she carried sharp objects in the laces of <b>her</b> <b>boots</b> and would cut herself when she felt low self-esteem, stress, or anxiety. The bullying stopped when Manson associated herself with a rebel crowd, which resulted in her rebelling herself. She was absent {{for most of her}} final year at school and began smoking cannabis, sniffing glue, drinking alcohol, shoplifting, and on one occasion breaking into Edinburgh Zoo. Manson had teenage ambitions to become an actress, but was rejected by the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama (RSAMD). Her first job was volunteer work in a local hospital's cafeteria, then as a breakfast waitress at a local hotel, before spending five years as a shop assistant for Miss Selfridge. She started on the shop's makeup counters, but was eventually moved into stockrooms because of her attitude toward customers. She became well known throughout Edinburgh's clubbing scene; making use of free samples from Miss Selfridge, she styled hair for a number of local bands. Manson also briefly modelled clothing for Jackie magazine.|$|E
500|$|That night, Julian {{finds that}} Kathy has {{scratches}} on her back, and the pair discover that <b>her</b> <b>boots</b> are stuffed with switches. Julian later finds Kathy downstairs. Celia calls {{to say she}} and Toby are safely home, and Kathy admits that her child is not Julian's. The Krampus snatches her, and Julian keels over, clutching his heart. He needs his medication, but Kathy watches him die, holding his empty pill bottle for him to see. [...] "The Krampus" [...] is revealed to be Klaus in a costume, but Klaus then removes a fake moustache and drops his accent; he is Simon, Kathy's lover.|$|E

500|$|Acid Tongue has {{received}} generally favorable reviews, scoring a 75% on review aggregator Metacritic. Creative Loafing {{said that while}} Rabbit Fur Coat [...] "glided through an Appalachian dream world", Lewis [...] "stomps <b>her</b> <b>boots</b> while exploring similar terrain" [...] on Acid Tongue. The review continued that while the album [...] "includes plenty of quirky meditations on lost love that recall her previous adventures, [...] well-placed jolts give Acid Tongue greater balance, a component that's lacking on Rabbit Fur Coat." [...] According to The Sunday Times, [...] "the results are magnificent, [...] but occasionally they are a shaky misstep." [...] Chicago Sun-Times writer Jim DeRogatis called Acid Tongue [...] "sensual and entrancing." [...] The Daily Trojan labeled the tracks as [...] "psychedelic, occasionally sexy, but always timeless", although noting that the album [...] "lacks a thematic focus {{that can be found}} on every other album Lewis has released".|$|E
500|$|When the exorcists {{are given}} the mission to save General Cross Marian from the Noah clan, she {{believes}} Allen was killed on the journey by her former ally Suman Dark. As she copes with this, Lenalee defeats a Level 3 Akuma attacking her group's ship. She then coaxes more power from her Innocence than she can safely handle, reducing her ability to use <b>her</b> <b>boots</b> {{as well as her}} physical mobility. During this state, her Innocence becomes a crystal to protect her from harm, a behavior unheard of in Innocence. This leads the Millennium Earl to believe that Lenalee might possess the [...] "Great Heart" [...] that both exorcists and the Noah search for as the user of it will win the war. However, the Earl tries to take her, but the exorcist is saved by the returning Allen. The group is then trapped in Noah's Ark where their enemies try to kill the exorcist before the Ark is destroyed. With Cross' help, Allen saves the Ark. After returning to the Black Order, a Level 4 Akuma attacks the HQ, and many people are injured or killed. Lenalee willingly expresses a desire to become an exorcist. Accepting her conviction, the Innocence grants her greater power, becoming a never-before-seen evolved Equipment-type, dubbed a Crystal-type. These new Boots are made up of Lenalee's blood and repair themselves as long as she has blood in her body. When the Dark Boots are in their dormant state, they form two blood-red anklets. With these powers, she saves Allen from the Level 4 Akuma whom they manage to exorcise thanks to Cross.|$|E
2500|$|Jones took McBride to his house, raped her, {{and held}} her in a closet. He forced McBride to use {{hydrogen}} peroxide on herself, washed McBride's clothes, and forced McBride to walk on towels {{in an attempt to}} conceal the crime by hiding any fibers and other possible evidence. He then drove McBride to a remote area, beat her to death with a tire iron, and deposited the body under a bridge in Coke County, Texas. McBride had been hit in the head at least nine times. Dr. Jan Garavaglia, who was {{at the time of the}} murder an associate medical examiner in Bexar County, examined McBride's body at a local morgue. [...] Garavaglia stated that the trauma to her head was [...] "worse than most high-impact car wrecks." [...] Jones likely forced McBride to walk to the point where she was killed; only mud was found on <b>her</b> <b>boots,</b> and no scuff marks were present. McBride's body was found clothed in her U.S. Army battle uniform, itself in excellent condition; the clothing had no forensic evidence of rape.|$|E

2500|$|The tour commenced, as scheduled, on February 28, 1999 at the Spokane Arena in Spokane, Washington. MTV {{reported}} that the inaugural show only sold 8,500 tickets, {{less than half of}} the arena's 18,000-person capacity. Monster Magnet's opening slot lasted 45 minutes and, as noted by MTV, displayed [...] "the same energy that made them a hit on Rob Zombie's last US tour". During Hole's performance, Love joked with the audience between songs. She also gave away two guitars and <b>her</b> <b>boots</b> to audience members. However, Hole left the stage after only 45 minutes into their show (out of a scheduled hour and a half set) due to Love's disappointment with the audience turnout. Marilyn Manson was due to perform after Hole's scheduled exit from the stage, but started 90 minutes late due to problems that arose from having to construct their complicated theatrics in a rush after Hole's impromptu walkout. After the problems were resolved, they played an hour and a half show marked by deliberate destruction of their instruments and explicit onstage antics that were the band's trademark. They ended the show with a performance of their signature song [...] "The Beautiful People" [...] followed by an encore.|$|E

Morneau had stayed in the car during the robberies, so she got a lighter sentence.|$|R
