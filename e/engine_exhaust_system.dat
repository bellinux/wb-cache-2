50|$|Although most ceramic {{coatings}} {{are applied}} to metallic parts {{directly related to the}} <b>engine</b> <b>exhaust</b> <b>system,</b> technological advances now allow thermal barrier coatings to be applied via plasma spray onto composite materials. It is now commonplace to find ceramic-coated components in modern engines and on high-performance components in race series such as Formula 1. As well as providing thermal protection, these coatings are also used to prevent physical degradation of the composite material due to friction. This is possible because the ceramic material bonds with the composite (instead of merely sticking on the surface with paint), thereby forming a tough coating that doesn't chip or flake easily.|$|E

To {{reduce the risk of}} engine knock at high compression, residual gas is reduced by using 4-2-1 <b>engine</b> <b>exhaust</b> <b>systems,</b> implementing a piston cavity, and optimizing fuel injection. In addition, combustion duration is shortened by intensifying air flow, increasing injection pressure, and using multi-hole injectors.|$|R

50|$|Exhausts emit a {{large amount}} of heat into the engine bay, which can have a {{negative}} effect on engine performance by raising the underhood temperatures. As a result, high temperature insulation is used, more commonly known as heat barriers, for exhaust heat management. Thermal barrier ceramic-coatings are specifically designed to reduce heat loss from <b>engine</b> <b>exhaust</b> <b>system</b> components including exhaust manifolds, turbocharger casings, exhaust headers, downpipes and tailpipes. When used under-bonnet, these have the positive effect of reducing engine bay temperatures, therefore lessening the intake temperature.

40|$|The {{problem of}} waste energy {{recuperation}} from the exhaust gas of diesel engines {{has been investigated}} for many years by the manufacturers of passenger vehicles, heavy-duty vehicles and non-road vehicles. Currently, {{the energy of the}} exhaust gas is manly used for driving turbochargers. However, only part of the energy contained in the exhaust gas is used for this process. The outstanding energy is wasted through a heat exchange from the exhaust gas through the exhaust pipe to ambient air. Many scientific research works are aimed at the recovery of energy through transferring it from the walls to heat exchangers. The objective of the authors was the analysis of the temperature distribution in a diesel <b>engine</b> <b>exhaust</b> <b>system</b> in the aspect of recuperation of energy lost through heat exchange. To complete the objective, temperature and gas flow measurements were performed on the exhaust system of a 1. 3 dm 3 diesel engine installed on a dynamic test stand. On the test stand a complete <b>engine</b> <b>exhaust</b> <b>system</b> was installed, identical to that used in a real vehicle. The tests were carried out in the NEDC homologation test that was reproduced on the dynamometer through ISAC 400 software made by AVL. For the measurements, the authors used thermoresistors and a mass flow meter for the exhaust gas mass flow measurement (part of the SEMTECH DS portable exhaust emissions analyzer) ...|$|E

40|$|The {{engine failure}} {{consisting}} in {{a lack of}} combustion in particular cylinders, commonly called as an engine misfire, is defined in the Directive 98 / 69 of the European Parliament which states that,,engine misfire means lack of combustion in the cylinder of a spark-ignition engine caused {{by a lack of}} an ignition spark, poor mixture, too low compression ratio value, or any other reason”. The engine misfire always leads to an increase in the <b>engine</b> <b>exhaust</b> <b>system</b> emission and it can result in an irreversible damage of the catalytic converter resulting from exceeding its admissible operating temperature. The vehicle with the damaged catalytic converter becomes an origin of an intensive emission from the <b>engine</b> <b>exhaust</b> <b>system.</b> Therefore the primary requirement of all OBD standards is an obligation to provide constant monitoring of the engine misfire events for the spark-ignition engines (SI) and to identify the cylinder number of the engine in which a lack of combustion occurs.
