5|$|The destroyers are a {{follow-on}} of the Project 15 s, but {{are considerably}} more capable due to major {{improvements in the}} design, the addition of substantial land-attack capabilities, and the <b>fitting-out</b> <b>of</b> modern sensors and weapons systems.|$|R

50|$|The {{expedition}} included 11,000 {{men and a}} {{fleet of}} 64 ships. The expedition was led by French Admiral Jean-Baptiste Louis Frédéric de La Rochefoucauld de Roye, Duc d'Anville. The <b>fitting-out</b> <b>of</b> this fleet was slow and difficult, {{and it did not}} set sail from Île-d'Aix, France until 22 June 1746. A subsequent storm in the Bay of Biscay and adverse winds slowed the transatlantic crossing. Disease broke out on the ships - typhus and scurvy.|$|R

5|$|With funding obtained, {{tunnelling}} for the CCE {{was carried}} out between September 1903 and December 1905, after which the station buildings and <b>fitting-out</b> <b>of</b> the tunnels commenced. The C's Euston extension was constructed {{at the same time}} from the newly opened Angel station and opened on 12 May 1907, with the station building designed by Sidney Smith located {{on the east side of}} Eversholt Street. The CCE opened on 22 June 1907, its building, designed by Leslie Green, is located at the corner of Drummond Street and Melton Street.|$|R
5|$|Tunnelling was {{completed}} in December 1905, after which work continued {{on the construction of}} the station buildings and the <b>fitting-out</b> <b>of</b> the tunnels with tracks and signalling equipment. As part of the UERL group, the CCE obtained its electricity from the company's Lots Road Power Station, originally built for the electrification of the MDR; the proposed Chalk Farm generating station was not built. The final section of the approved route between Charing Cross and the Embankment was not constructed, and the southern terminus on opening was Charing Cross. After a period of test running, the railway was ready to open in 1907.|$|R

50|$|Production of {{complete}} motor buses (and of any two-axle motor buses) had ended in 1978, and {{aside from the}} <b>fitting-out</b> <b>of</b> the last articulated MAN shells, the only production in 1979 was that of two batches of trolleybuses (and the only such vehicles ever built by the company). These were all 40 ft vehicles, model 10240T: 110 trackless trolleys for the Philadelphia trolleybus system, operated by SEPTA, and 109 for the Seattle trolleybus system, operated by Metro Transit (now King County Metro). One of the latter has been preserved (following its retirement in 2003) by King County Metro (see King County Metro fleet).|$|R

50|$|Distinctions between {{theories}} of moral reasoning can {{be accounted for}} by evaluating inferences (which tend to be either deductive or inductive)based on a given set <b>of</b> <b>premises.</b> Deductive inference reaches a conclusion that is true based on whether a given set <b>of</b> <b>premises</b> preceding the conclusion are also true, whereas, inductive inference goes beyond information given in a set <b>of</b> <b>premises</b> to base the conclusion on provoked reflection.|$|R
50|$|When the Telegraph Construction and Maintenance Company {{was formed}} in 1865, Canning was {{appointed}} its chief engineer. He had charge of the manufacture and laying of the transatlantic telegraph cables of 1865 and 1866, for which the company were the contractors. This work involved the <b>fitting-out</b> <b>of</b> the SS Great Eastern. On 2 August 1865 the cable broke in 2000 fathoms of water. After a second cable had been successfully laid by the Great Eastern (13-27 July 1866) Canning set to work to recover the broken cable, using special grappling machinery, which he devised for the purpose. After several failures the cable was eventually recovered on 2 September 1866.|$|R
5000|$|In opposition, the Abbott-led Coalition was {{critical}} of the Labor government's National Broadband Network policy, and proposed to deliver [...] "a cheaper version, more efficiently", by funding a technologically inferior {{fibre to the node}} network, rather than Labor's primarily fibre to the premises network.
