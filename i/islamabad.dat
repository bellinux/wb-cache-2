Performance of the <b>Islamabad</b> {{administration}} attracted the reprimand of the court for its slow pace. The court was informed that 61 students were in custody, of whom 39 were on bailable offences.

5|$|At {{the inauguration}} on 9 September 2008, Afghan President Hamid Karzai {{was a guest}} of honour, which was a signal for much closer {{cooperation}} {{between the two nations}} in addressing the tribal insurgency along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border. After the election, Zardari promised to approve the constitutional provision that removed the President's power to dismiss Parliament, but public scepticism remained on whether he would actually carry out his promise. His economic competence was questioned after allegations that he had raised grain procurement prices through inflationary subsidies and scrapped the capital gains tax.

40|$|This thesis {{explains}} Pakistan’s strategic {{choices in}} the 1990 s by examining {{the role of the}} United States in the shaping of <b>Islamabad’s</b> security goals. Drawing upon a diverse range of oral history interviews, the thesis explains the American contribution to Pakistani security objectives during the presidency of Bill Clinton (1993 - 2001). By doing this it addresses a gap in the relevant literature and moves beyond the available mono-causal explanations often distorted by a mixture of intellectual obfuscation and political rhetoric. By drawing upon the concept of the security dilemma in international politics as a lens {{to understand the nature of}} Pakistan’s India-specific security compulsions, this research investigates and explains the dynamics which drove <b>Islamabad’s</b> pursuit of nuclear weapons, its support for the Taliban and its approach towards the indigenous uprising in Indian Kashmir. In doing this, it highlights the extent to which Clinton’s foreign policy reinforced the immediate catalysts for US-Pakistan relations in the aftermath of the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan in 1989 and the end of the Cold War two years later. The primary argument of the thesis is that Clinton’s foreign policy contributed to the hardening of <b>Islamabad’s</b> security perspectives, creating space for the Pakistani military establishment to pursue its regional security goals; goals which were largely at variance with US global objectives in the 1990 s. Secondly, it argues that US-Pakistan relations during this period were driven by a Cold War mindset, causing a fissure between US global and Pakistan’s regional security goals. The Pakistani military and civilian leadership utilized these divergent and convergent trends to protect <b>Islamabad’s</b> India-centric strategic interests...|$|R

5|$|In August 2010, {{a former}} Pakistani {{intelligence}} officer approached the U.S. embassy station chief in <b>Islamabad</b> {{and offered to}} reveal bin Laden's location, {{in return for the}} $25 million reward, according to a retired senior U.S. intelligence official. This story was corroborated by two U.S. intelligence officials speaking to NBC News, and had been previously reported by intelligence analyst Raelynn Hillhouse. The Pakistani official informed U.S. intelligence that bin Laden had been located by Pakistani ISI in 2006, and held under house arrest near Pakistani intelligence and military centers ever since. The official passed polygraph tests, after which the U.S. began local and satellite surveillance of bin Laden's Abbottabad residence.|$|E
5|$|On Friday, 6 July, President General Musharraf {{left for}} the flood-affected areas of Balochistan. As the president's {{aircraft}} took off from the <b>Islamabad</b> airport, militants fired anti-aircraft weapons {{at it from the}} roof of a house in the Asghar Mall area of Rawalpindi. The militants' relationship with Lal Masjid remains unknown. Security forces recovered two anti-aircraft guns and a machine gun on the rooftop of a Rawalpindi high-rise, one mile (1.6km) from the airport. The government asserted that shots were heard minutes after the president's aircraft took off. Analysts suggest that it may have been retaliation for ongoing operations against Lal Masjid and the government's continued efforts to combat terrorism and Talibanization in northern Waziristan.|$|E
