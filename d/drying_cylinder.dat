40|$|One {{of the key}} {{technologies}} {{in the production of}} tissue is the creping process, where the wet paper is adhered to a large <b>drying</b> <b>cylinder</b> and then peeled off the cylinder, when dried, with a doctor blade. The doctoring process changes the structure of the tissue, breaking bonds between the fibres, greatly increasing the thickness while reducing the length of the sheet and creating the soft feel of the tissue. This paper describes a laboratory scale rig that we have built to investigate the creping process. The creping rig is fed by a continuous web from an unwind stand. The web is processed by spraying the desired level of adhesive, type, concentration and volume onto an internally heated cylinder, adhering the web to the heated rotating cylinder using a presser roll, and then doctoring the web from the cylinder and rewinding. Controllable parameters include spray rate, adhesive concentration and type, cylinder temperature, rewind tension and dryer speed. Creping effectiveness is measured on-line from the reduction in web length and from the force required to doctor the sample off the cylinder. Effectiveness is also measured off-line from the change in thickness, strength and stretch of the samples. To obtain stable operation it is necessary to control the rewind tension. The solution finally chosen was to drive the rewind roll with a variable speed motor controlled from the tension from a measuring roll. It was necessary to stringently filter the adhesive to avoid full and partial plugging of the feed lines and spray nozzles. A two stage filter system was necessary, with one filter on the tank outlet and individual filters protecting each of the spray nozzles. Initial results show that crepe ratio, tensile strength, thickness and stretch all fall with increasing web tension and temperature...|$|E

40|$|A {{theoretical}} {{model has been}} developed for the drop behaviour in siphon riser tubes in paper <b>drying</b> <b>cylinders.</b> Analytical solutions to the equations are presented for the systems air-water at atmospheric pressure and saturated steam-water. Numerical simulations are performed for {{a large number of}} input data. Calculated drop trajectories indicate that the drops travel {{only a small part of}} the riser tube length before they are deflected to the frontside of the riser tube. For the system air-water the drop radial velocity when hitting the tube does not exceed 50 % of the gas velocity, while with the system steam-water the radial velocity can be up to 90 % of the gas velocity. The azimuthal drop velocities are in the range 2 - 10 m/s. The condensate slip relative to the cylinder results in an initial backward motion of the drops before they are accelerated to the frontside. Thus, part of the drops will hit the backside wall resulting, in the formation of a liquid film. This film will also be subjected to the coriolis force resulting in a liquid redistribution to the frontside wall.

40|$|The {{topic of}} this thesis is {{modeling}} {{and control of}} {{the last part of the}} paper machine - the drying section. Paper is dried by letting it pass through a series of steam heated cylinders and the evaporation is thus powered by the latent heat of vaporization of the steam. The moisture in the paper is controlled by adjusting the set point of the steam pressure controllers. There exist several commercial incentives to focus on the performance of the moisture control. The time to perform a grade change is often limited by the moisture and shorter grade change time is directly correlated to economic profit. Studies have shown that the drying section uses 2 / 3 of the total energy requirement in paper making. Reduced variations in moisture gives opportunity for target shifts (changed set point) which reduces the amount of raw material and steam requirement. It also creates opportunity for increased production rate. The thesis is divided in two parts. The first part deals with the control of the steam pressure inside the cylinders. Both a black-box model and a physical model are given for the steam pressure process. A tuning rule for both PI and PID control is derived and various other controller structures are investigated. Many of the results are verified by experiments on paper machines at different paper mills. The second part of the thesis treats the moisture controller. The physical model from the first part is expanded with a model for the paper. This gives a complete simulation model for the drying section that is implemented in the object-oriented modeling language Modelica. Two new approaches to control the moisture by feedback are evaluated. The first utilizes the air around the paper in combination with the <b>drying</b> <b>cylinders</b> to improve the controller performance. The second uses only the last part of the drying section to control the moisture, while the first part is put at an appropriate level.
