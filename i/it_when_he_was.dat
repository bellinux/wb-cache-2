He also began writing a novel in a new style, using first-person narration but abandoned work on <b>it</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> commissioned into the Royal Marines in December and entered training at Chatham naval base. He never completed the novel: fragments were eventually published as Work Suspended and Other Stories (1943).|$|E

25|$|The Lombard reign {{began to}} recover only with Liutprand the Lombard (king from 712), son of Ansprand and {{successor}} of the brutal Aripert II. He managed to regain a certain control over Spoleto and Benevento, and, {{taking advantage of}} the disagreements between the Pope and Byzantium concerning the reverence of icons, he annexed the Exarchate of Ravenna and the duchy of Rome. He also helped the Frankish marshal Charles Martel drive back the Arabs. The Slavs were defeated in the Battle of Lavariano, when they tried to conquer the Friulian Plain in 720. Liutprand's successor Aistulf conquered Ravenna for the Lombards for the first time but had to relinquish <b>it</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> subsequently defeated by the king of the Franks, Pippin III, who was called by the Pope.|$|E
25|$|From the 1680s (army) {{and early}} 18th century (navy), all {{soldiers}} {{in a given}} company were required to have a unique name, {{to make it easier}} to give specific orders. This could be problematic when several soldiers had the same name (being usually from rural background, they generally had just a patronymic, and such were often very common, e.g. Andersson, Eriksson, Olsson or Persson), giving rise to the Swedish soldier names. When a soldier appeared before the military scribe, he was given a soldier's name (often, a rote's new soldier received his predecessor's name), which he kept during his service. Those surnames also tended to become hereditary, as the soldier often retained <b>it</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> pensioned or left the service, and his children were also registered under it in census lists and church booksthis is the origin of many present-day Swedish surnames. The name was usually short, consisting of only one syllableto make it easy and rapid to say. The names could be taken from a trait, such as the surname Stolt ("Proud") or from military terms, such as Svärd ("Sword"), but were often related to the rote. A soldier from a rote located in the village of Sundby, for example, could be given the surname Sundin. This meant that surnames often stayed with the croft, rather than with the soldier. Common practice amongst discharged soldiers in the 18th century was to reassume their original name. This changed in the 19th century, and many soldiers kept their old soldier names, passing it on to their children. Each soldier in the regiment also had a unique number, between 1 and 1,200, the number of the rote and croft he belonged to (for example nummer 15 Stolt, number 15 Stolt).|$|E

He settled in the Latin Quarter in an {{apartment}} that overlooked the Sorbonne, where he enrolled in 32 different classes.

Until Berg finished reading a paper, he considered it [...] "alive" [...] and refused to let anyone else touch <b>it.</b> <b>When</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> finished with it, he would consider the paper [...] "dead" [...] and anybody could read it. In January 1924, instead of heading back to New York and getting himself into shape for the upcoming baseball season, Berg toured Italy and Switzerland.|$|E
500|$|Critics' {{concerns}} did {{not stop}} the play from being a box office success. Several reviewers anticipated that focusing on the play's salacious content would increase patronage. Woods exploited {{the controversy over the}} play's content in his advertisements for <b>it.</b> <b>When</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> taken to court, The New York Times decided Woods could no longer use the name of the play in any ads placed with the paper. Woods worked around the problem by promoting the large number of people who had seen an unnamed production at his theater, with daily updates of the total. In ads where he could mention the name, he traded on its reputation with suggestive taglines, such as one inviting audiences to [...] "complete your education" [...] by seeing the play. Some ads suggested the reader should see the play to stay informed, because there was widespread discussion of it. In other ads, it was declared [...] "the most famous play in America".|$|E

500|$|The {{voice of}} SpongeBob was {{originally}} used by Kenny for a minor background character in Rocko's Modern Life. Kenny forgot the voice initially as he created it only for that single use. Hillenburg, however, remembered <b>it</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> {{coming up with}} SpongeBob and used a video clip of the episode to remind Kenny of the voice. When Hillenburg heard Kenny do the voice, he said, [...] "That's it—I don't want to hear anybody else do the voice. We've got SpongeBob." [...] He said that to Nickelodeon; however, the network said, [...] "Well, let's just listen to 100 more people." [...] Kenny said, [...] "But {{one of the advantages}} of having a strong creator is that the creator can say, 'No, I like that—I don't care about celebrities.'"

500|$|While Hillenburg, Drymon and Hill {{were writing}} the pilot, Hillenburg was also {{conducting}} auditions to find voices {{for the show}} characters.

Drymon said, [...] "Tom came in a few times so we could pitch him what we were working to help him find the right voice. Tom had already worked on lots of other animated shows, and Steve wanted to find an original sounding voice." [...] The voice of SpongeBob was originally used by Kenny for a very minor female alligator character named Al in Rocko's Modern Life.

Later on, the song {{was supposed to be}} featured in the film Saw, but ultimately was not for undisclosed reasons. This was later followed by the release of [...] "Of Mice and Men". Additionally, [...] "Kick the Chair" [...] was released as a free promotional download via Megadeth's website in May 2004, several months prior to the album's release. This version of the song was described by Mustaine as being a final mix, but not the master that would appear on the record. [...] "Tears in a Vial" [...] was written by Mustaine shortly after Megadeth disbanded in 2002 about a decision to trade success for happiness. The next track on the album, [...] "I Know Jack", is an instrumental featuring a sample of a sample of Texas Senator Lloyd Bentsen's famous response to Indiana Senator Dan Quayle during a 1988 vice-presidential debate.

500|$|Lyrically, {{the album}} focused on more unusual themes for rock music than the band had written for Hello Master as they instead wrote about {{personal}} interests. For his part, Heppner described the songs as being about [...] "mega geek shit", and recalled some advice {{he had been}} given to simply write about things he liked, which became how most of the songs on the album were written. Heppner wrote [...] "Murphy's Law" [...] as an ode to his favorite film, RoboCop; he was inspired to write <b>it</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> writing songs in his room and saw his poster for the movie on the wall. His lyrics to [...] "It Baffles the Mind" [...] recount a tournament in the manga/anime series Dragon Ball, while the seminal Lone Wolf and Cub inspired him to write [...] "Sideways Attack". The influential serial drama Twin Peaks served as the basis for a song that he wrote that did not make it into the final track listing; outtakes from the album, of which there were at least three, were set for separate release on 7" [...] singles. Watchorn has noted that this album {{was not the first time}} the band had described their favorite films in songs; although he did not specify which ones, he did note that there were songs from Hello Master that pertained to films as well.|$|E

We were showing Doug the storyboard, and he started reading back to us in his Tony the Tiger/Gregory Peck voice.

2500|$|During {{his rule}} in Kabul, {{when there was}} a time of {{relative}} peace, Babur pursued his interests in literature, art, music and gardening.
