5|$|Meanwhile, Avram <b>Glazer</b> – {{the son of}} Malcolm <b>Glazer</b> – {{was looking}} into {{investment}} in European football. The <b>Glazer</b> family already owned several businesses in the United States and had purchased the Tampa Bay Buccaneers National Football League franchise in 1995. They convinced the local government to fund a new stadium for the Buccaneers in 1998 and the franchise won its first Super Bowl in January 2003.|$|E
5|$|The Buccaneers first {{joined the}} NFL in 1976 {{as members of}} the AFC West. The {{following}} year, they moved to the NFC Central. The Tampa Bay expansion franchise was originally awarded to Tom McCloskey, a construction company owner from Philadelphia. It soon became apparent that McCloskey had financial problems, so the NFL found a replacement in Hugh Culverhouse. They were purchased by Malcolm <b>Glazer</b> in 1995 for $192 million, following Culverhouse's death. The front office staff of the team includes Bryan <b>Glazer,</b> Edward <b>Glazer,</b> and Joel <b>Glazer.</b>|$|E

40|$|Background: Cobalt {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} constituent present in ceramic industries. <b>Glazers</b> are the relevant workers when they are producing blue colored ceramic, causing occupational exposure to such metal. Through this study, urinary cobalt was determined in <b>glazers</b> in a ceramic industry when they were producing blue-colored ceramic glazes. Methods: In this case-control study, spot urine samples were collected from 49 <b>glazers</b> at the start and end of work shifts (totally 98 samples) in 2011. Control group were well matched for age, height, and weight. A solid phase extraction system was used for separation and preconcentration of samples followed by analysis by inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES). All participants filled out a self administered questionnaire comprises questions about duration of exposure, work shift, use of mask, skin dermatitis, kind of job, ventilation system, overtime work, age, weight, and height. The lung function tests were performed on each control and cobalt exposed subjects. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was used to evaluate the obtained results. Results: Urinary levels of cobalt were significantly higher in the <b>glazers</b> compared to the control group. There were significant differences at urinary concentration of cobalt at the start and end of the work shift in <b>glazers.</b> Spirometric parameters were significantly lower in the <b>glazers</b> compared to the control group. Among the variables used in questionnaire the significant variables were dermatitis skin, mask, ventilation, and overtime work. Conclusion: This study verified existence of cobalt in the urine <b>glazers,</b> showing lower amount than the ACGIH standard...|$|R

They then managed to secure the stake of the third-largest stakeholder, Scottish mining entrepreneur Harry Dobson, taking their share total to 62% of the club. By 13 May, the <b>Glazers</b> had bought a further 12.8% stake taking their total ownership to 74.81%, just shy of the 75% threshold {{that would allow them}} to end the club's public limited company (PLC) status and delist it from the London Stock Exchange. On 16 May, the <b>Glazers</b> took their shareholding in Manchester United to 75.7%, and a month later, on 22 June, they removed the club's shares from the stock exchange for the first time in 14 years.|$|R
5|$|On 8 May 2013, Ferguson {{announced}} that he was to retire as manager {{at the end of the}} football season, but would remain at the club as a director and club ambassador. The club announced the next day that Everton manager David Moyes would replace him from 1 July, having signed a six-year contract. Ryan Giggs took over as interim player-manager 10 months later, on 22 April 2014, when Moyes was sacked after a poor season in which the club failed to defend their Premier League title and failed to qualify for the UEFA Champions League for the first time since 1995–96. They also failed to qualify for the Europa League, meaning that it was the first time Manchester United hadn't qualified for a European competition since 1990. On 19 May 2014, it was confirmed that Louis van Gaal would replace Moyes as Manchester United manager on a three-year deal, with Giggs as his assistant.

5|$|In June 2012, {{after several}} months with no further {{developments}} on the Singapore front, several sources reported that the club was considering moving its share issue to the United States, and in July 2012, an application was made for the club to sell shares on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), with a target of raising $100million (£64million). More details of the sale were released {{at the end of}} July, with the club announcing that they intended to sell 16.7million shares (approximately 10% of the club) at between $16 and $20 each, raising up to $330million (£210million).

5|$|Following the Manchester United board's {{search for}} new investors, the <b>Glazers</b> {{purchased}} their first tranche of Manchester United shares on 2 March 2003, spending around £9million on a 2.9% stake, which they purchased through a holding company called Red Football. On 26 September 2003, {{it was reported that}} they had increased their share to 3.17%, taking their shareholding above the 3% threshold that required them to inform the club's management. There had already been considerable speculation {{about the possibility of a}} takeover of the club, either by the <b>Glazers</b> or by one of several other interested parties. By 20 October, they had increased their shareholding to 8.93%, and on 29 November it was reported that they owned around 15% of the club and had met David Gill, its chief executive, to discuss their intentions. On 12 February 2004, the <b>Glazers</b> increased their stake in the club to 16.31% and the following day's Financial Times reported that they had instructed Commerzbank to explore a takeover bid. The club's share price increased by 5% that day, valuing the club at a total of £741million. The <b>Glazers</b> increased their shareholding to over 19% the following June, although they were still not the largest shareholders. Their shareholding continued to increase, nearing 30% by October 2004. Upon reaching 30%, they would have to launch a formal takeover bid.|$|R
5|$|Manchester United was the highest-earning {{football}} {{club in the}} world for 2015–16, with an annual revenue of €689million, and the world's most valuable {{football club}} in 2017, valued at £2.86billion. As of June 2015, it is the world's most valuable football brand, estimated to be worth $1.2billion. After being floated on the London Stock Exchange in 1991, the club was purchased by Malcolm <b>Glazer</b> in May 2005 in a deal valuing the club at almost £800million, after which the company was taken private again, before going public once more in August 2012, when they made an initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange.

5|$|On 16 November 2010, it was {{revealed}} that the Glazers were to pay off the remaining £220million contained within the PIK loans by 22 November 2010. The loans were by then accruing interest at a rate of 16.25%, as the club's overall debt had exceeded its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) by more than five times. However, the club claimed that none of its own money had been put towards the repayment, raising questions as to how the <b>Glazer</b> family had raised the funds; suggested methods include the sale of a minority stake in the club to a third party, the sale of {{some or all of the}} family's other businesses, and – the most likely option – the refinancing of the PIKs with another loan at a lower interest rate.|$|E
5|$|Protests {{over the}} {{impending}} takeover of Manchester United by American businessman Malcolm <b>Glazer</b> {{had threatened to}} overshadow the final, though demonstrations in Cardiff required little intervention from the police.

5|$|F.C. United {{were formed}} in 2005 {{by a group}} of Manchester United {{supporters}} following the club's controversial takeover by Malcolm <b>Glazer</b> which led to hundreds of supporters defecting from the club. Without a stadium of their own they agreed to use Bury's Gigg Lane stadium, but the agreement continued at the cost of approximately £5,000 per match. Within a year, the fan-owned club set aspirations to build its own 7,000 to 10,000 capacity stadium as close to Manchester city centre as possible by 2012 and consequently entered into negotiations with New East Manchester and Manchester City Council to develop their plans. Despite attendances averaging over 2,000 in their first few seasons, the fact that the club did not have access to a stadium of its own on its match days was a contributory factor in the club's financial loss for three years (£42,267 in 2007, £40,669 in 2008 and £9,663 in 2009).|$|E
5|$|Johansson {{played the}} cyborg, supersoldier Motoko Kusanagi in Rupert Sanders's 2017 film {{adaptation}} of the Ghost in the Shell franchise. The film received mixed reviews: it was praised for its visual style, acting, and cinematography but was controversial for whitewashing the cast, particularly Johansson's character. Responding to the criticism, {{she said she would}} never play a person of another race, but wanted to use this rare opportunity to star in a franchise with a female protagonist. The film grossed $169.8million worldwide against a production budget of $110million. In March 2017, Johansson hosted Saturday Night Live for the fifth time, making her the 17th person, and the fourth woman (after Candice Bergen, Drew Barrymore, and former cast member Tina Fey) to enter the NBC sketch comedy series' prestigious Five-Timers Club. In the black comedy film Rough Night (2017), Johansson played Jess Thayer, one of the five friends—alongside Kate McKinnon, Jillian Bell, Ilana <b>Glazer,</b> and Zoë Kravitz—whose bachelorette party goes wrong after a male stripper dies. Despite mixed critical reception for the film, it had moderate box office returns.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the capital}} used by <b>Glazer</b> to {{purchase}} Manchester United {{came in the form}} of loans, the majority of which were secured against the club's assets, incurring interest payments of over £60million per annum. The remainder {{came in the form of}} PIK loans (payment in kind loans), which were later sold to hedge funds. Manchester United was not liable for the PIKs, which were held by Red Football Joint Venture and were secured on that company's shares in Red Football (and thus the club). The interest on the PIKs rolled up at 14.25% per annum. Despite this, the Glazers did not pay down any of the PIK loans in the first five years they owned the club. In January 2010, the club carried out a successful £500million bond issue, and by March 2010, the PIKs stood at around £207million. The PIKs were eventually paid off in November 2010 by unspecified means. In August 2012, as part of further refinancing, the Glazers sold a number of shares in Manchester United in an initial public offering (IPO) on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).|$|E

2500|$|While {{talks with}} the Raiders were {{secretly}} underway, the <b>Glazers</b> publicly pursued another respected offensive mind, San Francisco 49ers head coach Steve Mariucci. [...] Just when initial reports indicated that Mariucci had agreed to become both the Bucs' head coach and general manager, Raiders owner Al Davis agreed to release Jon Gruden to Tampa Bay. [...] Observers suggested that the Glazers' offer to Mariucci was merely a clever bargaining tactic: since Davis' large ego is well documented, it was very likely he wouldn't allow such a blockbuster trade to take place so near his turf. [...] If the tactic didn't work, then the Bucs would still get the type of head coach the <b>Glazers</b> desired.|$|R
40|$|<b>Glazers</b> {{are exposed}} {{to a variety of}} heavy metals in the ceramic industry, causing adverse effect on the body systems. Cadmium {{is one of the major}} raw {{materials}} for production of colored glazes. To evaluate occupational exposure to cadmium, spot urine samples were collected from 49 tile and pottery <b>glazers</b> in Yazd City in 2010 at the beginning and end of the work shift (98 samples). Totally, 55 office workers were also evaluated as control group. Samples were prepared using solid phase extraction followed by Inductively Coupled Plasma Atomic Emission Spectroscopy. All the participants filled out a self administered questionnaire comprises questions about work shift, kind of job, use of mask, ventilation,work history, overtime work, age, weight, and height. The lung function tests were performed in a standing position according to the American Thoracic Society recommendation on both control andcadmium exposed individuals. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was used to evaluate the data. The mean values of cadmium levels before and after shift in study group was 3. 88 and 10. 85 μg/gcreatinine,respectively. The mean values of cadmium levels at the end of the work shift in the <b>glazers</b> urine samples was almost 3. 53 times higher than the control group and 2. 17 times higher than the ACGIHbiological exposure indices (5 μg/g creatinine). In addition the lung functions of <b>glazers</b> was significantly lower than the office workers (p< 0. 001). Exposure to cadmium in ceramic industry can lead to the reduction of respiratory capacity. Hygienic behaviors such as using protective mask and working in efficient ventilated workplaces can decrease the rate of occupational exposure to cadmium...|$|R
