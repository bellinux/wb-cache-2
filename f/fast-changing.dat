5|$|This brought Kenney into {{conflict}} with the Chief of the Air Staff of the RAAF, Air Vice Marshal George Jones, who felt that an opportunity had been lost to simplify {{the administration of the}} RAAF. Kenney preferred to have Bostock in command, and while he regarded the antipathy between Jones and Bostock as a nuisance, was happy to leave arrangements the way they were. However, Kenney deviated from the normal structure of an air force by creating the Advanced Echelon (ADVON) under Whitehead. The new headquarters had the authority to change the assignments of aircraft in the forward area, where <b>fast-changing</b> weather and enemy action could overtake orders drawn up in Australia. Kenney was promoted to lieutenant general on 21 October 1942.|$|E

25|$|Featuring {{the renowned}} comic pair of the lighter-skinned Bert Williams and George W. Walker, {{the show was}} the first to {{introduce}} a critical discourse of African Imperialism into the vaudeville theatre scene. Walker and Williams were said to have emphasized {{some of the most important}} components of early 20th century Black musicals: <b>fast-changing</b> scenery using tableau (presumably painted backdrops), improvisation, traditional Black-facing, heavy pantomime, and interpolation of songs borrowed from other original source-texts.|$|E
25|$|The true Africanis {{is still}} found today in tribal areas where people {{maintain}} their traditional lifestyle.

The Africanis Society of Southern Africa was founded to conserve this ancient gene pool. Conserving the Africanis as a landrace stands for conserving biodiversity. The society has been praised as an ethically responsible canine association.|$|E

Education in the sciences encounters new dimensions with the changing landscape of science and technology, a <b>fast-changing</b> culture, and a knowledge-driven era. A reinvention of the school science curriculum is one that shapes students to contend with its changing influence on human welfare. Scientific literacy, which allows a person to distinguish science from pseudosciences such as astrology, is among the attributes that enable students to adapt to the changing world. Its characteristics are embedded in a curriculum where students are engaged in resolving problems, conducting investigations, or developing projects.|$|E
25|$|The {{development}} of fast fashion trend {{also contributes to}} the arisen of sweatshops. Fast fashion trend refers to “rapid reorders and new orders that retailers now exert as they discern sales trends in real time” (Ross, 2015) To {{catch up with the}} <b>fast-changing</b> fashion trends to satisfy increasing customers’ demand, these fast-fashion brands have to react and arrange production accordingly. To lower production and the storage cost, they are always searching for cheaper labour which can produce orders {{in a short period of}} time. This results in workers suffering from unreasonably long working hours without reasonable payment. A documentary, “The True Cost” (2015), points out that sweatshop is a story of passing pressure from the retailers to factory owners and ends on the workers (including sew-machine operators, cutters and pressers). Workers are exploited in the name of cheap clothes.|$|E
25|$|The {{end of the}} Cold War forced Turkish {{leaders to}} {{reassess}} their country's international position. The disappearance of the Soviet threat {{and the perception of}} being excluded from Europe have created a sense of vulnerability with respect to Turkey's position in the <b>fast-changing</b> global political environment. Özal believed Turkey's future security depended on the continuation of a strong relationship with the United States. For that reason, he supported the United States' position during the Persian Gulf War, although Turkey's economic ties to Iraq were extensive and their disruption hurt the country. After the war, he continued to support major United States initiatives in the region, including the creation of a no-fly zone over northern Iraq, the Arab–Israeli peace process, and expanded ties with the Central Asian members of the CIS. Özal's pro-United States policy was not accepted by all Turks. The United States' use of Turkish military installations during the bombing of Iraq in 1991 led to antiwar demonstrations in several cities, and sporadic attacks on United States facilities continued in 1992 and 1993. Nevertheless, among Turkey's political elite, a consensus had emerged by January 1995 that Turkey's security depended on remaining a strategic ally of the United States. For that reason, both the Demirel and Çiller governments undertook efforts to cultivate relations with the administrations of presidents George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton.|$|E
25|$|Whilst on {{the surface}} the new Potsdamer Platz appears so far to have {{lived up to its}} {{expectations}} as a futuristic centre of commerce at the heart of Europe's youngest capital city, there has been much debate as to just how successful it really is. Certainly its long term success and viability have become much harder to judge since the recent worldwide economic downturn, a situation compounded by the actions of its two principal owner-occupiers. Daimler and Sony caused a major surprise on 2 October 2007 when both announced that they were putting their respective complexes at Potsdamer Platz on the market. Whilst neither intended to move out, both felt it preferable to rent the space from new owners rather than continue to be the owners themselves (and so be responsible for the buildings' upkeep and maintenance). Daimler had recently come through a painful separation from their former American subsidiary Chrysler and needed a quick injection of cash in order to refocus on automotive production. Ironically, the announcement came on the ninth anniversary of their complex's official opening, a fact not lost on many people. Sony meanwhile, put their decision down to a need to review their global strategy {{in the face of a}} <b>fast-changing</b> worldwide economic climate. The implications for Potsdamer Platz were ominous, with suggestions that overall confidence in the project was faltering, and more pessimistic claims that the development had largely failed in its original intentions.|$|E

Critical reaction towards the film was mixed, but her performance received praise. Taran Adarsh wrote that Chopra [...] "is bound to win laurels yet again [...] the actor is emerging as one of the finest talents in these <b>fast-changing</b> times". Her next release was Suneel Darshan's romance Barsaat, co-starring Bobby Deol and Bipasha Basu. The film was a critical and commercial failure in India but fared better in the overseas market. Chopra's performance received mixed reviews, with Bollywood Hungama describing it as [...] "mechanical". However, Rediff.com considered Chopra to be an [...] "epitome of calm intelligence, who underplayed her role to perfection". Later that year, Rohan Sippy cast her with Abhishek Bachchan, Ritesh Deshmukh and Nana Patekar in the comedy Bluffmaster! Chopra played independent working woman Simran Saxena, Bachchan's love interest. The film proved to be a box-office success.|$|E
500|$|Fear of a Black Planet {{received}} {{rave reviews}} from contemporary critics.

USA Todays Edna Gundersen called it [...] "a masterpiece of innovation [...] challenging music" [...] that makes the group's pro-black lyrics more interesting and plausible. Rolling Stone magazine's Alan Light praised Public Enemy's self-assured and realistic lyrics, and viewed the album as a deeper, more focused version of [...] "the careening rage of Nation of Millions". Greg Sandow of Entertainment Weekly found it powerfully relevant to contemporary American culture and unparalleled by anything in popular music: [...] "It sounds like a partly African, partly postmodern collage, stitched together on tumultuous urban streets." [...] Tom Moon of The Philadelphia Inquirer observed [...] "some of the genre's most sophisticated sound designs and unconventionally agile rapping" [...] on the album and called it [...] "a major piece of work, the first hard evidence of rap's maturity and a measure of its continuing relevance".|$|E

He created the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Air Task Forces to control air operations in a forward area for a specific mission, another departure from doctrine. While Kenney was enthusiastic about this innovation, Washington did not like it and, over Kenney's objections, converted the three air task forces into the 308th, 309th and 310th Bombardment Wings. In June 1944, Major General St. Clair Streett's [...] Thirteenth Air Force was added to the Allied Air Forces. Kenney created the Far East Air Forces (FEAF) from his Fifth Air Force headquarters, while ADVON became the Fifth Air Force under Whitehead. [...] The RAAF formed the Australian First Tactical Air Force under Air Commodore Harry Cobby in October 1944, and when MacArthur became commander of all Army forces in the Pacific, the Seventh Air Force was added as well. Major General Paul Wurtsmith replaced Streett in March 1945, and Air Commodore Frederick Scherger replaced Cobby in May. [...] Allied Air Forces was abolished on 2 September 1945.|$|E
