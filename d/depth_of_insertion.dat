40|$|Introduction: The aim of {{this study}} is to {{formulate}} an accurate estimate of the spinal needle depth for a successful lumbar puncture in pediatric patients. Methods: This is a prospective study of pediatric oncology patients who had lumbar punctures in the course of their treatment. The distance from skin entry point to the tip of the spinal needle was measured after lumbar punctures were performed. The relationship between the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> needle <b>insertion</b> with weight, height, body surface area, body mass index, intervertebral space used, ethnicity, and sex of patient were studied. Predictive statistical models were used for the formulation of the ideal lumbar puncture needle depth. Results: Two hundred seventy-nine patients who had nontraumatic lumbar punctures were studied. The patient characteristics were as follows: age, 0. 5 to 15 years; weight, 7 to 63 kg; and height, 70 to 162 cm. Analysis using multiple regression tests with stepwise approach showed a strong relationship between the lumbar puncture needle depth and weight/height ratio. By using a predictive regression model, ideal <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> needle <b>insertion</b> (cm) = 10 [weight(kg) /height(cm) ] + 1, with a regression coefficient r = 0. 77.

Adductor muscle spasticity is a common complication of spinal cord and brain injury. It needs to be treated if it interferes with {{activities of daily living}} and self-care. Obturator neurolytic blockade is one of the cost-effective therapeutic possibilities to treat spasticity of adductor group of muscles. In this study, we assessed the efficacy of interadductor approach in alleviating the spasticity. Methods: Obturator neurolysis using 8 - 10 ml 6 % phenol was given with the guidance of a peripheral nerve stimulator in 20 spastic patients. Technical evaluation included number <b>of</b> attempted needle <b>insertions,</b> time to accurate location <b>of</b> the nerve, <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> needle <b>insertion,</b> and success rate.

40|$|AbstractCytochrome P 450 (CYP) 17 A 1 is a dual-function monooxygenase with a {{critical}} role in the synthesis of many human steroid hormones. The enzyme is an important target for treatment of breast and prostate cancers that proliferate in response to estrogens and androgens. Despite the crystallographic structures available for CYP 17 A 1, no membrane-bound structural features of this enzyme at atomic level are available. Accumulating evidence has indicated that the interactions between bounded CYPs and membrane could contribute to the recruitment of lipophilic substrates. To this end, we have investigated the effects on structural characteristics {{in the presence of the}} membrane for CYP 17 A 1. The MD simulation results demonstrate a spontaneous <b>insertion</b> process <b>of</b> the enzyme to the lipid. Two predominant modes of CYP 17 A 1 in the membrane are captured, characterized by the <b>depths</b> <b>of</b> <b>insertion</b> and orientations <b>of</b> the enzyme to the membrane surface. The measured heme tilt angles show good consistence with experimental data, thereby verifying the validity of the structural models. Moreover, conformational changes induced by the membrane might have impact on the accessibility of the active site to lipophilic substrates. The dynamics of internal aromatic gate formed by Trp 220 and Phe 224 are suggested to regulate tunnel opening motions. The knowledge of the membrane binding characteristics could guide future experimental and computational works on membrane-bound CYPs so that various investigations of CYPs in their natural, lipid environment rather than in artificially solubilized forms may be achieved...|$|R

For this purpose, we labeled the N-terminus of three synthetic peptides, melittin, magainin 2 and poly-l-lysine capable {{to interact with}} lipid membranes. Binding of these peptides to lipid vesicles induced a strong fluorescence increase, which enabled to quantify the peptide–membrane interaction. Moreover, the dual emission of the label in these peptides correlated well with the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> its <b>insertion</b> measured by the parallax quenching method. Thus, in melittin and magainin 2, which show deep <b>insertion</b> <b>of</b> their N-terminus, the label presented a dual emission corresponding to a low polar environment, while {{the environment of the}} poly-l-lysine N-terminus was rather polar, consistent with its location close to the bilayer surface. Using spectral deconvolution to distinguish the non-hydrated label species from the hydrated ones and two photon fluorescence microscopy to determine the probe orientation in giant vesicles, we found that the non-hydrated species were vertically oriented in the bilayer and constituted the best indicators for evaluating the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> the peptide N-terminus in membranes.

40|$|Background: Family {{practice}} residencies offer {{training in}} flexible sigmoidoscopy; however, {{there are no}} objective recommendations for determining competency in learners. We describe a longitudinal study designed to determine the mean procedure time and <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>insertion</b> for family practice residents. Methods: During a 21 -month period, data were collected for 421 patients undergoing flexible sig-moidoscopy. Second- or third-year family medicine residents supervised by family medicine faculty did all procedures. The data were analyzed with simple descriptive statistics, t test, and linear and logistic regression. Results: The mean procedure time was 18 9. 3 minutes (17. 2 – 19. 6, 95 % confidence interval [CI]). The mean insertion depth was 51. 4 12. 4 cm (50. 4 – 52. 6 cm, 95 % CI). Performing a biopsy was associated {{with an increase in}} procedure time (17. 0 vs 27. 3 minutes, P <. 0001). Women with a history of pelvic surgery had less <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>insertion</b> than did those who had no history of pelvic surgery (47 vs 53 cm, P. 002, t test). Conclusion: Procedural competency consists of knowledge, technical skills, and attitudes. Knowl-edge and attitudes can be assessed with other items, such as examinations and observation. Primary care faculty can now use these standards of insertion depth and procedure time when determining tech...|$|E
40|$|Lumbar {{puncture}} {{was performed}} in 195 children {{and the depth of}} needle was recorded. Our results show that the depth of lumbar puncture necessary to obtain uncontaminated cerebrospinal fluid correlates best with the child’s weight. The simple formula: mean <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>insertion</b> (cm) = 1. 3 + 0. 07 x body weight (kg), can be used to estimate the depth of lumbar puncture of children older than 3 months. The depths of lumbar puncture of children younger than 3 months are mostly 1. 0 – 1. 5 cm...|$|E

40|$|Background Although {{acupuncture}} manipulation {{has been}} {{regarded as one of}} the important factors in clinical outcome, it has been difficult to train novice students to become skillful experts due to a lack of adequate educational program and tools. Objectives In the present study, we investigated whether newly developed phantom acupoint tools would be useful to practice-naïve acupuncture students for practicing the three different types of acupuncture manipulation to enhance their skills. Methods We recruited 12 novice students and had them practice acupuncture manipulations on the phantom acupoint (5 % agarose gel). We used the Acusensor 2 and compared their acu-puncture manipulation techniques, for which the target criteria were depth and time factors, at acupoint LI 11 in the human body before and after 10 training sessions. The outcomes were <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> needle <b>insertion,</b> <b>depth</b> error from target criterion, time of rotating, lifting, an...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUNDd ANDd OBJEeCTIVEeS: To {{verify the}} {{prevalence}} of correct position of the tracheal tube after children intubation in two reference intensive care unit in south of Brazil. Evaluate {{the accuracy of the}} different methods and suggested formulas to estimate the <b>depth</b> <b>insertion</b> <b>of</b> the endotracheal tube. MEeTHODdS: A cross-sectional, observational study was designed. It was included all children intubated at pediatric ICU in Hospital São Lucas da PUCRS and Hospital de Clínicas de Porto Alegre between August and September of 2004. Patient with vertebral deviations, after surgeries or with airway malformations was excluded. In the first 24 hours after intubation the patients’ charts were reviewed, a questionnaire was filled, the physician who was responsible for the procedure was interviewed and the chest radiogram was analyzed. The position was considered correct if the tube extremity was between the first thoracic vertebra (T 1) and the third thoracic vertebra (T 3) with a tolerance of 0. 5 cm. The different formulas to estimate the <b>depth</b> <b>insertions</b> <b>of</b> the endotracheal tube were applied in all patients and this distance was measured with the aim of evaluate the accuracy of each method. REeSULTS: The endotracheal tube position was correct in 60 % (21 / 35) of the intubated children. A half of the physicians used some formula to estimate the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> tracheal tube <b>insertion.</b> There was no difference between the group that used any formula and the group that didn’t use in predict the correct tube position (75 % versus 47 % p = 0, 2). The most accurate method to estimate the endotracheal tube location was age group (68 %; p = 0. 02) when compared with height, tube diameter and age. CONCLUSIONS: The methods that are used to estimate the length of endotracheal tube to be introduced in children have low accuracy. It is imperative to develop a sharper and practical way to determine this distance...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: In this study, {{the effects}} of the intracochlear {{position}} of cochlear implants on the clinical fitting levels were analyzed. DESIGN: A total of 130 adult subjects who used a CII/HiRes 90 K cochlear implant with a HiFocus 1 / 1 J electrode were included in the study. The insertion angle and the distance to the modiolus of each electrode contact were determined using high-resolution CT scanning. The threshold levels (T-levels) and maximum comfort levels (M-levels) at 1 year of follow-up were determined. The degree of speech perception of the subjects was evaluated during routine clinical follow-up. RESULTS: The <b>depths</b> <b>of</b> <b>insertion</b> <b>of</b> all the electrode contacts were determined. The distance to the modiolus was significantly smaller at the basal and apical cochlear parts compared with that at the middle of the cochlea (p < 0. 05). The T-levels increased toward the basal end of the cochlea (3. 4 dB). Additionally, the M-levels, which were fitted in our clinic using a standard profile, also increased toward the basal end, although with a lower amplitude (1. 3 dB). Accordingly, the dynamic range decreased toward the basal end (2. 1 dB). No correlation was found between the distance to the modiolus and the T-level or the M-level. Furthermore, the correlation between the insertion depth and stimulation levels was not affected by the duration of deafness, age at implantation or the time since implantation. Additionally, the T-levels showed a significant correlation with the speech perception scores (p < 0. 05). CONCLUSIONS: The stimulation levels of the cochlear implants were affected by the intracochlear position of the electrode contacts, which were determined using postoperative CT scanning. Interestingly, these levels depended on the insertion depth, whereas the distance to the modiolus did not affect the stimulation levels. The T-levels increased toward the basal end of the cochlea. The level profiles were independent of the overall stimulation levels and were not affected by the biographical data of the patients, such as the duration of deafness, age at implantation or time since implantation. Further research is required to elucidate how fitting using level profiles with an increase toward the basal end of the cochlea benefits speech perception. Future investigations may elucidate an explanation for {{the effects of}} the intracochlear electrode position on the stimulation levels and might facilitate future improvements in electrode design...|$|R
