40|$|The {{current study}} aims to {{determine}} the relationship between individuals attentional bias scores, measured in a modified Addiction Stroop task, with four other variables; level of involvement in <b>Internet</b> <b>games,</b> impulsivity, behavioural inhibition/activation, and sensation seeking. Recruitment was gathered through the Psychology Sona Research Participation Pool at Western University and was exclusive to male, English speaking, non-colour blind individuals. Participant’s completed {{a modified version of}} the Addiction Stroop task (for Internet gamers). Additionally, participant’s fill out five questionnaires: a Demographics form, the Problem Online Gaming Questionnaire (POGQ), the Barratt Inhibition Scale (BIS), the Behavioural Inhibition/Activation Systems Scale (BIS/BAS), and the Sensation Seeking Scale (SSS). E-prime measured participants’ reaction times to target and matched control words in a modified Addiction Stroop task. Results suggest that higher levels of involvement with <b>Internet</b> <b>games</b> are significantly correlated with attentional bias. This correlation is shown by highly-involved individuals having slower reaction times to target words in comparison to matched control words in the modified Addiction Stroop task. BIS scores and the inhibition factor of the BIS/BAS were significantly correlated with participant’s level of involvement with <b>Internet</b> <b>games.</b> In conclusion, results suggest that individual’s with higher levels of involvement with <b>Internet</b> <b>games</b> display attentional bias indicating another similarity between IGD, substance use, and gambling disorders...|$|R
