If the right is then infringed, the author or director has legal recourse. For {{the right to}} be infringed, the author must show that they have not been properly identified, that this was in circumstances where the work should have been attributed, and that none of the exceptions or defences apply. In regards to the lack of proper identification, for identification to be acceptable the name of the author must appear in each copy of the work in a prominent fashion, under Section 77(7) of the 1988 Act; where it is not appropriate for the author's name to appear on each copy, it must appear in a fashion that brings their identity to the attention of any person using or acquiring a copy of the work. If the work is a building, the name must be visible to people entering or approaching it. If the author specifies a pseudonym or some other form of identification when asserting the right of attribution, that form of identification should be adopted.|$|E

25|$|The <b>Copyright</b> law <b>of</b> 1993 had {{specified}} {{a general}} <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>copyrights</b> <b>of</b> 50 years beyond an author's death, or 50 {{years since the}} publication of an anonymous work. The implementation act for the law made the new law apply retroactively, restoring copyrights (and neighbouring rights) on works on which the shorter copyright terms from the Soviet-era had already expired or which had not been copyrighted at all under Soviet law. In 2004, this copyright term was extended to 70 years for all works still copyrighted.|$|R
25|$|Copyright is {{free and}} {{automatic}} upon creation of the work. In general, the first owner of copyright will be the author (for literary, musical, dramatic and artistic works) or producer (for sound recordings and films) or broadcaster (for broadcasts). Under Australian law, where an employee is the author, the first owner of copyright is the employer (this is slightly different from the US works-made-for-hire doctrine: in Australia, <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>copyright</b> is still measured by the lifetime of the employee author). In 2004–2005, Australia also introduced some complicated provisions that give performers part ownership rights in sound recordings, and directors some limited ownership rights in relation to films.|$|E
25|$|Throughout {{these various}} {{revisions}} of the law, some characteristics remained constant. Copyright was automatic in the USSR: a work was copyrighted from its creation, and registration was not needed. Only creative works expressed in some objective form were subject to copyright. The <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>copyright</b> was much shorter than customary in the West. Copyright was, from the beginning, limited to works of Soviet citizens and to works by foreign authors that were first published in the USSR (or, if unpublished, existed in objective form on {{the territory of the}} Soviet Union). The economic rights of authors were limited by a long list of uses that did not constitute copyright infringements, and mandatory official royalty rates limited the income of authors. Soviet copyright law also granted the freedom of translation (until 1973): any work could be freely translated and then published without the original author's consent.|$|E

The report reviews the basic economic principals involved in copyright law and gives rough estimates of the value <b>of</b> <b>copyrights</b> on books, music, and movies produced in the 1920 s and 1930 s — those that would be most immediately affected by an extension <b>of</b> <b>copyright</b> terms...|$|R
50|$|The United States {{and most}} Latin American {{countries}} instead {{entered into the}} Buenos Aires Convention in 1910, which required a copyright notice on the work (such as all rights reserved), and permitted signatory nations to limit the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>copyrights</b> to shorter and renewable terms. The Universal Copyright Convention was drafted in 1952 as another less demanding alternative to the Berne Convention, and ratified by nations such as the Soviet Union and developing nations.|$|R
2500|$|Under the Soviet regime, the {{copyright}} law {{was changed to}} conform more to Socialist ideology and economics. The <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>copyright</b> was reduced, first to 25 years from the first publication of a work and then in 1928 to 15 years after the author's death, before it was increased again to 25 years [...] in 1973, when the USSR joined the Universal Copyright Convention. After {{the demise of the}} Soviet Union, the Russian Federation at first took over the last Soviet legislation from 1991, which hadn't even become effective anymore in the USSR. In 1993, a new, modernized copyright law of Russia entered in force, which was in-line with the leading international copyright treaties. As part of a project to develop a new Civil Code of Russia, {{the copyright}} law was completely rewritten and integrated into the Civil Code in 2006, with the new provisions becoming effective on January 1, 2008.|$|E

If this may be justly objected to, and in my opinion it may, it is because the showy tributes to genius are apt to draw off attention from those efforts by which the interests of literature might be substantially promoted; and to exhaust public spirit in comparatively unprofitable exertions, when the wrongs of literary men are crying out for redress on all sides. It appears to me, that towards no class of his Majesty's subjects are the laws so unjust and oppressive. The attention of Parliament has lately been directed, by petition, to the exaction of copies of newly published works for certain libraries; but this is a trifling evil compared with the restrictions imposed upon the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>copyright,</b> which, in respect to works profound in philosophy, or elevated, abstracted, and refined in imagination, is tantamount almost to an exclusion of the author from all pecuniary recompence; and, even where works of imagination and manners are so constituted as to be adapted to immediate demand, as is the case of those of Burns, justly may it be asked, what reason can be assigned that an author who dies young should have the prospect before him of his children being left to languish in poverty and dependence, while booksellers are revelling in luxury upon gains derived from works which are the delight of many nations.|$|E

25|$|In the European Union, {{copyrights}} {{have been}} harmonized amongst {{the member states}} by the EU directive 93/98/EEC on harmonising the term <b>of</b> <b>copyright</b> protection. This binding directive, which became effective on July 1, 1995, has raised the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>copyrights</b> throughout the union to 70 years p.m.a. It also includes in its article 7 a mandatory rule of the shorter term for works from non-EU countries. Within the EU, no comparison of terms is applied, and—as in the Berne Convention or in the UCC—existing international obligations (such as bilateral treaties) may override this rule of the shorter term. Directive 93/98/EEC was repealed and replaced by Directive 2006/116/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 December 2006 on the term <b>of</b> protection <b>of</b> <b>copyright</b> and certain related rights.|$|R

The <b>copyright</b> status <b>of</b> a music arranger is discussed in particular, whose work is usually defined in theory as adaptation of existing musical works, whereas in the practice of Slovenian popular music, arrangers often act as co-authors of new original music. The last part of the article examines the rules on the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> rights in musical works produced in co-authorship and discusses in what way the ownership and the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>copyrights</b> in musical works is affected by Directive 2011 / 77 /EU, which sets out unified rules on the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> rights in musical compositions with words...|$|R
