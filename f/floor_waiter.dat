60|$|The {{door was}} opened by the <b>floor</b> <b>waiter,</b> who held it while a thin, dark man, dressed in {{civilian}} clothes of most correct cut, passed in. Hobson gripped him at once by the hand.|$|E
60|$|Monsieur Picard {{was a tall}} man, black-bearded, immaculate in {{appearance}} and deportment, with manners and voice of velvet. Yet he, too, had lost his wonderful imperturbability. He waved away the <b>floor</b> <b>waiter,</b> who had drawn near. His manner was almost agitated.|$|E
6000|$|The sun {{was shining}} into his bedroom when Philip Romilly was awakened the next morning by a {{discreet}} tapping at the door. He {{sat up in bed}} and shouted [...] "Come in." [...] He had no occasion to hesitate for a moment. He knew perfectly well where he was, he remembered exactly everything that had happened. The knocking at the door was disquieting but he faced it without a tremor. The <b>floor</b> <b>waiter</b> appeared and bowed deferentially.|$|E
60|$|He sent {{a waiter}} ahead to {{announce}} him, and leisurely mounted the stairs. No. 56 was the sitting-room {{of a private}} suite on the first <b>floor.</b> The <b>waiter</b> was holding the door open. As he approached it a faint perfume from the interior made him turn pale. But he recovered his presence of mind sufficiently {{to close the door}} sharply upon the waiter behind him.|$|R
60|$|The stem of {{the wine}}-glass in John's fingers snapped suddenly, {{and the wine}} trickled down to the <b>floor.</b> A passing <b>waiter</b> hurried up with a napkin, and a fresh glass was brought. The affair was {{scarcely}} noticed, but John remained disturbed and a little pale.|$|R
5000|$|Bar girls {{dance to}} Bollywood and Indipop numbers on a colourfully lit dance floor, {{in the central}} focus of a dance bar's seating arrangement. Patrons sit in chairs lined up against {{the walls of the}} room. The dancing is minimalist kind and {{features}} no pelvic thrusting and bosom heaving seen typical Bollywood dance, nor any belly-dancing or suggestive gyrations. Most of the time, bar girls reservedly sway to music, in a movement designed for the conservation of energy, until they find a patron whose attention they wish to attract, or are called upon by a patron. They then dance in front of the patron, making fleeting eye contact, pointing, gesturing, or generally making their targeted patron [...] "feel special". No bodily contact between the two is allowed, and the bar dancers often stay {{within the confines of the}} dance <b>floor.</b> Male <b>waiters</b> hover over patrons and dancers who get too close to each other, both to oversee transactions between the two as well as ostensibly to prevent sex-for-money deals being made. Patrons sometimes shower bar girls with currency notes, which generally results in more animated dancing.|$|R
50|$|In 1872, Ritz became <b>floor</b> <b>waiter</b> of the HÃ´tel Splendide in Paris, {{which was}} one of the most lavish hotels in Europe at the time, where he met many rich, self-made Americans as guests who had a {{profound}} effect on him. In 1873 he was a waiter in Vienna at the time of the International Exhibition, by which time he had begun to acquire a considerable knowledge of the industry and the culinary preferences of esteemed people such as the Prince of Wales.|$|E
