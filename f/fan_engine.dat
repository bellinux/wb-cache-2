2500|$|The HS.141 {{design was}} a jet {{airliner}} of all-metal construction with a T-tail and a low-mounted swept wing with a quarter-chord sweepback of 28degrees. The design featured two wing-mounted [...] "cruise" [...] engines and 16 lift fan engines mounted in sponsons {{either side of}} the fuselage (eight per side). The engines under main consideration were the Rolls-Royce RB.220 turbofan for forward propulsion and the Rolls-Royce RB.202, a high bypass ratio lift <b>fan</b> <b>engine</b> using technology developed for the Rolls-Royce RB.162 lift jet. Both engines were themselves design studies by Rolls-Royce and it was feared that there would be delays in their development due to the company's problems at the time. One new engine type also considered for main propulsion was the 'SNECMA M.56', which became the CFM International CFM56. Variations using fewer lift fan engines for STOL operations only were also studied as it was realised that the engines could account for 15% of the total weight of the aircraft and 35% of the final cost.|$|E
2500|$|Sikorsky's first {{aircraft}} {{of his own}} design, the S-1 used a 15hp Anzani 3-cylinder <b>fan</b> <b>engine</b> in a pusher configuration, {{that could}} not lift the aircraft. His second design called the S-2 was powered by a 25hp Anzani engine in a tractor configuration and first flew on June 3, 1910 at a height of a few feet. On June 30 after some modifications, Sikorsky reached an altitude of [...] "sixty or eighty feet" [...] before the S-2 stalled and was completely destroyed when it crashed in a ravine. Later, Sikorsky built the two-seat S-5, his first design not based on other European aircraft. Flying this original aircraft, Sikorsky earned his pilot license; Fédération Aéronautique Internationale (FAI) license No. 64 issued by the Imperial Aero Club of Russia in 1911. During {{a demonstration of the}} S-5, the engine quit and Sikorsky was forced to make a crash landing to avoid a wall. It was discovered that a mosquito in the gasoline had been drawn into the carburetor, starving the engine of fuel. The close call convinced Sikorsky of the need for an aircraft that could continue flying if it lost an engine. His next aircraft, the S-6 held three passengers and was selected as the winner of the Moscow aircraft exhibition held by the Russian Army in February 1912.|$|E

2500|$|... 1909 saw {{radial engine}} forms rise to significance. The {{air-cooled}} Anzani 3-cylinder semi-radial or <b>fan</b> <b>engine</b> of 1909 (also {{built in a}} true, 120° cylinder angle radial form) developed only 25hp (16kW) but was much lighter than the liquid-cooled [...] Antoinette, and was chosen by Louis Blériot for his cross-Channel flight. A major advance came {{with the introduction of}} the Seguin brothers' Gnome Omega air-cooled rotary engine, exhibited at the Paris Aero Salon 1n 1908 and first fitted to an aircraft in 1909. [...] This radial-configuration engine was constructed {{in such a way that}} the entire crankcase and cylinder assembly rotated around a stationary crankshaft, itself fastened securely through the engine's rear attachment to the airframe, ensuring an adequate flow of cooling air over the cylinders even when the aircraft was not moving. [...] Although this type had been introduced as long ago as 1887 by Lawrence Hargrave and built two years later by Hargrave for compressed-air power — with an experimental five-cylinder internal combustion rotary engine used by French inventor Félix Millet that same year to power an early motorcycle design — improvements made to the Seguin brothers' Gnome series of engine designs created a robust, relatively reliable and lightweight design which revolutionised aviation and would see continuous development over the next ten years. Fuel was introduced into each cylinder direct from the crankcase meaning that only an exhaust valve was required. [...] Producing 37kW (50hp) for a dry weight of 75kg (165lb), this engine soon became one of the most widely used powerplants; the company went on to produce a number of similar engines producing more power, first by increasing the engine capacity and also by producing two-row variants. The larger and more powerful nine-cylinder. French-made Le Rhone 9C 80hp rotary was introduced in 1913 and was widely adopted for military use.|$|E

40|$|Predictions of the {{prevalence}} of annoyance associated with aircraft noise exposure are heavily influenced by field studies conducted in urban airport neighborhoods. Flyovers heard in such relatively high ambient noise environments are composed in large part of high absolute level, broadband noise. In contrast, noise exposure created en route by aircraft powered by unducted <b>fan</b> <b>engines</b> {{is expected to be}} relatively low in level, but to contain prominent low frequency tonal energy. These tones will be readily audible in rural and other low ambient noise environments. The annoyance of noise intrusions of low absolute level {{has been shown to be}} closely related to their audibility. Thus, one way to predict the annoyance of en route noise generated by unducted <b>fan</b> <b>engines</b> is to estimate its audibility relative to that of conventionally powered aircraft in different ambient noise environments. This may be accomplished by computing the audibility of spectra produced by an aircraft powered by unducted <b>fan</b> <b>engines</b> and comparing predicted probabilities of annoyance for them with those of conventionally powered transport aircraft...|$|R
