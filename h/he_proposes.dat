5000|$|In his Essay {{towards a}} Real Character and a Philosophical Language, {{published}} in 1668, John Wilkins proposed {{a system of}} measurement that was very similar in concept to today's metric system. <b>He</b> <b>proposed</b> retaining the second as the basic unit of time and proposed that {{the length of a}} pendulum which crossed the zero position once a second (i.e. had a period of two seconds) should be the base unit of length. This length, for which <b>he</b> <b>proposed</b> the name [...] "standard", would have been 994 mm. His base unit of mass, which <b>he</b> <b>proposed</b> calling a [...] "hundred", would have been the mass of a cubic standard of distilled rainwater.

5|$|German philosopher Jürgen Habermas has {{proposed}} a theory of discourse ethics that he claims is a descendant of Kantian ethics. <b>He</b> <b>proposes</b> that action {{should be based on}} communication between those involved, in which their interests and intentions are discussed so they can be understood by all. Rejecting any form of coercion or manipulation, Habermas believes that agreement between the parties is crucial for a moral decision to be reached. Like Kantian ethics, discourse ethics is a cognitive ethical theory, in that it supposes that truth and falsity can be attributed to ethical propositions. It also formulates a rule by which ethical actions can be determined and proposes that ethical actions should be universalisable, in a similar way to Kant's ethics.|$|E
5|$|Hadley {{is known}} for his account of animal {{property}} rights theory. <b>He</b> <b>proposes</b> that wild animals be offered property rights over their territories, and that guardians be appointed to represent their interests in decision-making procedures. He suggests that this account could be justified directly, {{on the basis of the}} interests of the animals concerned, or indirectly, so that natural environments are protected. The theory has received discussion in popular and academic contexts, with critical responses from farming groups and mixed responses from moral and political theorists. Hadley has also conducted research on normative issues related to animal rights extremism, the aiding of others and utilitarianism.|$|E

5|$|Philosopher G. H. R. Parkinson notes {{a common}} {{objection}} to Kant's argument: that {{what ought to}} be done does not necessarily entail that it is possible. He also argues that alternative conceptions of morality exist which do not rely on the assumptions that Kant makes – he cites utilitarianism as an example which does not require the summum bonum. Nicholas Everitt argues that much moral guidance is unattainable, such as the Biblical command to be Christ-like. <b>He</b> <b>proposes</b> that Kant's first two premises only entail that we must try to achieve the perfect good, not that it is actually attainable.|$|E
