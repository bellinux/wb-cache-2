500|$|Thom Jurek from AllMusic {{described}} [...] "Sing" [...] as a [...] "huge feminist anthem" [...] {{and described}} it as consisting of a [...] "killer hook, a big bad soul/gospel refrain, and a beat that, once <b>it</b> <b>gets</b> <b>into</b> the spine, will not be easily dismissed". Boston Globes Sarah Rodman compared it to the Eurythmics' 1985 single [...] "Sisters Are Doin' It for Themselves" [...] adding that it carried Lennox's characteristic messages of [...] "optimism and empowerment". Liz Hoggard of The Guardian called the song a [...] "showstopper" [...] and the collaboration as [...] "incandescent". Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine also noted the anthemic nature of the track and its [...] "smartly plays more like a broad-spectrum sisters-are-doin’-it-for-themselves" [...] nature, while believing {{that it would have}} been better suited as the album's title song than Songs of Mass Destruction. Similar thoughts were echoed by Chris Jones of BBC News who felt that [...] "Sing" [...] was able to [...] "overcome its weighty agenda to take life as a great song in its own right".|$|E
500|$|... "In these days, the {{construction}} and guidance of airships have been improved greatly", wrote The Providence Journal, [...] "and it is supposed, both by the Parisian experts and by the Swedish scientists who have been assisting M. Andree, {{that the question of}} a sustained flight in this case will be very satisfactorily answered by the character of the balloon, by its careful guidance and, providing <b>it</b> <b>gets</b> <b>into</b> a Polar current of air, by the elements themselves."Faith in the experts and in science was common in the popular press, but with international attention came also for the first time informed criticism. Andrée being Sweden's first balloonist, no national had the requisite knowledge to second-guess him about buoyancy or drag ropes; but both Germany and France had long ballooning traditions and several of their more experienced balloonists expressed skepticism about Andrée's methods and inventions. However, just as with the Svea mishaps, all objections failed to dampen Andrée's optimism. Eagerly followed by national and international media, he began negotiations with the well-known aeronaut and balloon builder Henri Lachambre in Paris, world capital of ballooning, and ordered a varnished three-layer silk balloon, 20.5meters (67ft) in diameter, from his workshop. The balloon, originally called Le Pôle Nord (French for [...] "The North Pole"), was to be renamed Örnen (Swedish for [...] "The Eagle").|$|E
2500|$|Tackett {{recalled}} that nine {{people tried to}} convince him that they were the Phantom. He said, [...] "But in every case they could not have been for their stories didn't jibe with what we knew were the detailed facts in the case. You don't tell everything you know about a case. When <b>it</b> <b>gets</b> <b>into</b> the paper, the real criminal finds out how much you know and the confessors will fit those facts into their confessions. You keep yourself two or three pertinent facts to protect yourself from crackpots." ...|$|E

2500|$|Capacitors are {{connected}} in parallel with the power circuits of most electronic devices and larger systems (such as factories) to shunt away and conceal current fluctuations from the primary power source to provide a [...] "clean" [...] power supply for signal or control circuits. Audio equipment, for example, uses several capacitors in this way, to shunt away power line hum before <b>it</b> <b>gets</b> <b>into</b> the signal circuitry. The capacitors act as a local reserve for the DC power source, and bypass AC currents from the power supply. This is used in car audio applications, when a stiffening capacitor compensates for the inductance and resistance of the leads to the lead-acid car battery.|$|E

The Goomtee beyond Oudypore is well enough, until <b>it</b> <b>gets</b> <b>into</b> Kaayn, which is what they call independent.

The hide of the walrus is nearly an inch thick, and is covered with close, short hair.
