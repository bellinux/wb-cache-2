25|$|In recent {{research}} that builds {{on his work}} in polymerisation, Gilbert has developed {{a new way of}} understanding the biochemistry of the <b>enzymatic</b> <b>processes</b> involved in starch biosynthesis, in collaboration with Dr Melissa Fitzgerald, International Rice Research Institute, Manilla. In this new field, he applied the methods he had developed for understanding molecular-weight distributions in synthetic polymers to understanding those of natural ones. He has thus created a powerful new technique for probing the <b>enzymatic</b> <b>processes</b> in starch biosynthesis in grains, again, creating a methodology to obtain reliable mechanistic knowledge by isolating steps in highly complex systems. Each enzymatic step that creates individual chains—analysed by debranching the starch—can now be associated with particular regions in the molecular-weight distribution of a starch. This supported the applicability of one of two rival mechanistic postulates made by starch biochemists. He has also recently developed a major innovation for solving the vexed problem of quantitatively interpreting data for branched systems.|$|E

25|$|Preceded by {{induced changes}} in eggshell permeability, {{hatching}} may involve physical and/or <b>enzymatic</b> <b>processes</b> in plant-parasitic nematodes. Cyst nematodes, such as Globodera rostochiensis, {{may require a}} specific signal from the root exudates of the host to trigger hatching. Root-knot nematodes are generally unaffected {{by the presence of}} a host, but hatch freely at the appropriate temperature when water is available. However, in an egg mass or cyst, not all eggs will hatch when the conditions are optimal for their particular species, leaving some eggs to hatch at a later date. Ammonium ions have been shown to inhibit hatching and to reduce the plant-penetration ability of M. incognita juveniles that do hatch.|$|E
40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} improve the nutritive value of palm oil sludge (POS) by fermentation process. Aspergillus niger BPT and NRRL 337 were used into fermenting POS {{for three days and}} followed by anaerobic <b>enzymatic</b> <b>process.</b> The {{experiment was}} arranged in 2 x 3 factorial design i. e., enzymatic incubation time (2, 3, and 4 days) and environmental temperature during <b>enzymatic</b> <b>process</b> (room temperature and 40 °C). Changes on chemical compositions (crude protein, true protein, ADF and NDF), in vitro dry matter digestibility (IVDMD) and protein digestibility (IVPD) were measured. The results showed that both A. niger BPT and NRRL 337 grew well on POS media with the best result at 3 days. The fermentation process by both strains increased crude protein and true protein of POS. The A. niger NRRL reduced the fiber content (ADF and NDF) more than A. niger BPT the IVDMD and IVPD were not significantly affected by fermentation <b>process</b> without <b>enzymatic</b> <b>process.</b> The IVDMD increased significantly when the fermentation followed by <b>enzymatic</b> <b>process.</b> Overall results showed that the best fermentation of POS was obtained by using A. niger NRRL followed by <b>enzymatic</b> <b>process</b> in room temperature for two days. ...|$|R

30|$|An enzymatic {{approach}} to N-bromoacetyl- 7 -ACA, the key intermediate for the industrial production of cefathiamidine, {{has been developed}} successfully in a fully aqueous medium in this work. Apparently, this new <b>enzymatic</b> <b>process</b> is superior to traditional chemical methods, because of being simple, mild reaction condition, producing less waste, and being environmentally benign. More importantly, the yield of the desired product in this <b>enzymatic</b> <b>process</b> {{is much higher than}} that in the traditional chemical processes (85 vs 73 %). Therefore, the enzymatic method exhibited promising application potential for the chemoenzymatic production of cefathiamidine. However, many problems associated with this <b>enzymatic</b> <b>process</b> such as relatively low substrate concentrations and unsatisfactory operational stability for its large-scale application may be addressed by the corresponding measures (e.g., using the supersaturated substrate solutions and fed-batch feeding strategy, and improving enzyme immobilization methods) (Volpato et al. 2010; Ferreira et al. 2007; Youshko et al. 2004; Illanes et al. 2007; Montes et al. 2007).|$|R
