40|$|A novel mode of {{achieving}} site selectivity between C- 2 and C- 4 {{positions in the}} indole framework by altering {{the property of the}} ketone <b>directing</b> <b>group</b> is disclosed. Methyl ketone, as <b>directing</b> <b>group,</b> furnishes exclusively C- 2 alkenylated product, whereas trifluoromethyl ketone changes the selectivity to C- 4, indicating that the electronic nature of the <b>directing</b> <b>group</b> controls the unusual choice between a 5 -membered and a 6 -membered metallacycle. The screening of other carbonyl-derived <b>directing</b> <b>groups</b> reveals that strong and weak <b>directing</b> <b>groups</b> exhibit opposite selectivity. Experimental controls and deuteration experiments lend support to the proposed mechanism...|$|R
25|$|Using {{the same}} {{catalyst}} system <b>directing</b> <b>groups</b> {{can be employed}} to achieve regioselectivity without substituents as steric mediators. For example, Boebel and Hartwig reported a method to conduct ortho-borylation where a dimethyl-hydrosilyl <b>directing</b> <b>group</b> on the arene undergoes iridium catalyzed borylation at the C–H bond ortho to the silane <b>directing</b> <b>group.</b> Selectivity for the ortho position {{in the case of}} using hydrosilyl <b>directing</b> <b>groups</b> has been attributed to reversible addition of the Si-H bond to the metal center, leading to preferential cleavage of the C–H bond ortho to the hydrosilyl substituent. Several other strategies to achieve ortho-borylation of arenes have been developed using various <b>directing</b> <b>groups.</b>|$|R

50|$|Compared {{with other}} parts of France, ethnic {{minorities}} in Sarcelles gained political power at a faster rate, with gains made in the 1980s instead of the 1990s and 2000s. Many politicians responded to minority demands sooner as many immigrants, especially Caribbeans and Sephardic Jews, had French citizenship. François Pupponi, the mayor in the 2000s dedicated monuments commemorating the histories of ethnic groups, authorized funding of organizations supporting specific ethnic groups such as running Arabic and Hindi language classes and permitted {{the use of public}} facilities for religious events.
