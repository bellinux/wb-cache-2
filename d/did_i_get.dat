500|$|Although the Queen was {{set against}} Beatrice marrying {{anyone in the}} {{expectation}} that she would always stay at home with her, {{a number of possible}} suitors were put forward before Beatrice's marriage to Prince Henry of Battenberg. One of these was Napoléon Eugéne, the French Prince Imperial, son and heir of the exiled Emperor Napoleon III of France and his wife, the Empress Eugénie. After Prussia defeated France in the Franco-Prussian War, Napoleon was deposed and moved his family to England in 1870. After the Emperor's death in 1873, Queen Victoria and Empress Eugénie formed a close attachment, and the newspapers reported the imminent engagement of Beatrice to the Prince Imperial. These rumours ended with the death of the Prince Imperial in the Anglo-Zulu War on 1 June 1879.

500|$|Like all {{the other}} tracks, album opener [...] "Born Under Punches (The Heat Goes On)" [...] borrows from [...] "preaching, {{shouting}} and ranting". The expression [...] "And the Heat Goes On", used in the title and repeated in the chorus, {{is based on a}} New York Post headline Eno read in the summer of 1980 whilst Byrne rewrote the song title [...] "Don't Worry About the Government" [...] from TalkingHeads' debut album, , into the lyric [...] "Look {{at the hands of a}} government man". [...] The [...] "rhythmical rant" [...] in [...] "Crosseyed and Painless"—"Facts are simple and facts are straight. Facts are lazy and facts are late."—is influenced by old school rap, specifically Kurtis Blow's [...] "The Breaks" [...] given to Byrne by Frantz. [...] "Once in a Lifetime" [...] borrows heavily from preachers' diatribes. Some critics have suggested that the song is [...] "a kind of prescient jab at the excesses of the 1980s". Byrne disagreed with the categorisation and commented that its lyrics are meant to be taken literally; he stated, [...] "We're largely unconscious.

Bagradian feels both proud and estranged from his Armenian roots, and throughout the novel Werfel develops this theme of estrangement, which is denoted with the book’s first sentence - the question [...] "How <b>did</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> here?". Bagradian also considers his French wife Juliette and their son Stephan, and how they will adjust to their new environment, given the state of war that now exists and prevents their return.|$|E
