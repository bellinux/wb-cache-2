40|$|African <b>geographical</b> <b>mobilities</b> {{should be}} {{understood}} in terms of their increasingly global development over the last two decades, and as an interplay of scales of mobility between continents and between African regions or nations. The relationship between these various times and scales of mobility shape mobile communities as a daily reality for many Africans. African family histories and personal lives are full of connecting with those who have left. In recent years, these daily practices have been radically altered by improvements in communication technology – with travel, radio messages and letter writing being replaced by mobile telephony as the main connecting technology. This article explores how the development of connecting technology has changed the social dynamics of African mobile communities and focuses on the changes in (old and new) social hierarchies that are related to possibilities of accessing mobility and connecting technologies. It is based on a qualitative case study of a mobile community in Africa, {{which is part of the}} Mobile Africa Revisited programme that is investigating the relationship between new ICTs, mobility, marginality and social hierarchies...|$|R

30|$|This paper only {{marginally}} discusses <b>geographical</b> labour <b>mobility</b> and rather {{focuses on the}} second line of reasoning: in fact, it studies the way industrial restructuring affects local unemployment and does so {{by looking at the}} local labour market dynamics. Newly available data with a longitudinal structure allow studying it with a detail that has never been available before. The data come both from sample surveys and administrative sources. This is an important pre-condition to study the impact of industrial restructuring on local unemployment. Related to this has been the flourishing of an increasing body of literature whose results this paper will try to summarise and interpret by proposing a theoretical framework that is often implicit in the empirical literature, but hardly made explicit and discussed in depth.|$|R

40|$|Residential {{change is}} a {{pervasive}} condition of North American society. In a lifetime, a person may go through many decisive and interrelated changes in occupational status, family situation and dwelling-place. This research tests the relationships among three major processes: residential mobility, social mobility, and family formation in Montreal between 1861 and 1901. Using sample households from three cultural communities: French Canadian, Irish Catholic, and British Protestants, {{it was determined that}} the majority of households were highly mobile, yet remained within a compact <b>geographical</b> area. <b>Mobility</b> is seen as a response to a changing set of needs and opportunities, and families facilitated adjustment through extensive networks of kinship and neighbouring. Studies of present-day household mobility provide a well-developed set of theories, on which several hypotheses were based.

30|$|First, {{there might}} be reasons why <b>geographical</b> labour <b>mobility</b> within a country is {{reinforcing}} rather than reducing regional differences in local unemployment rates, as assumed in traditional neoclassical models of regional unemployment (Marston, 1985). A growing body of literature (see, among others, Moretti, 2003, and the related contributions on social externalities of human capital; and, within the New Economic Geography literature, Epifani and Gancia, 2005; Francis, 2009) suggests that economies to scale and positive externalities among complementary production factors might explain this, in turn. In other words, although moving from high to low unemployment regions, labour would be attracted where its return is higher, not because labour is less abundant, but because the returns to capital is higher, which would reinforce the ability of wealthier regions to produce more than average, generating further divergence, rather than convergence. This means, however, that regional unemployment {{is not only a}} consequence of state failure, due to the proven inability of regional policy, also at the EU level, to cause convergence, but also a consequence of market failure.|$|R
