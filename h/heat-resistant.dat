5|$|Lithium and its {{compounds}} {{have several}} industrial applications, including <b>heat-resistant</b> glass and ceramics, lithium grease lubricants, flux additives for iron, steel and aluminium production, lithium batteries, and lithium-ion batteries. These uses consume more than three quarters of lithium production.|$|E
5|$|Thorium dioxide is a {{material}} for <b>heat-resistant</b> ceramics, {{as used in}} high-temperature laboratory crucibles, as a main material or as an addition to zirconium dioxide. An alloy of 90% platinum and 10% thorium is an effective catalyst for oxidising ammonia to nitrogen oxides, but this {{has been replaced by}} an alloy of 95% platinum and 5% rhodium because of its better mechanical properties and greater durability.|$|E
5|$|As well as copper, a new {{substance}} was found, extracted and exploited: this was variously called wad, black lead, plumbago or black cauke, {{and is now}} known as graphite. Many uses were quickly discovered for the mineral: it reduced friction in machinery, made a <b>heat-resistant</b> glaze for crucibles, and when used to line moulds for cannonballs, resulted in rounder, smoother balls that could be fired further by English naval cannon. Later, from {{the second half of the}} 18th century, it was used to make pencils, for which Keswick became famous.|$|E
5|$|The {{internal}} {{metal parts}} of a torch are made of hard alloys of copper or brass so it can transmit current and heat effectively. The tungsten electrode must be held firmly {{in the center of}} the torch with an appropriately sized collet, and ports around the electrode provide a constant flow of shielding gas. Collets are sized according to the diameter of the tungsten electrode they hold. The body of the torch is made of <b>heat-resistant,</b> insulating plastics covering the metal components, providing insulation from heat and electricity to protect the welder.|$|E
5|$|Thorium was {{discovered}} in 1828; its first application came in 1885, when Austrian chemist Carl Auer von Welsbach invented the gas mantle, a portable source of light which produces light from the incandescence of thorium oxide when heated by burning gaseous fuels. After that, many applications were found for thorium and its compounds, including ceramics, carbon arc lamps, <b>heat-resistant</b> crucibles, and as catalysts for industrial chemical reactions such as the oxidation of ammonia to nitric acid.|$|E
5|$|While every {{implementation}} of each kind of ALF is different, the vapor cell in each is relatively similar. The thermodynamic properties of vapor cells in filters are carefully controlled because they determine important {{qualities of the}} filter, for instance the necessary strength of the magnetic field. Light is let {{into and out of}} this vapor chamber by way of two low-reflection windows made of a material such as magnesium fluoride. The other sides of the cell may be of any opaque material, though generally a <b>heat-resistant</b> metal or ceramic is used as the vapor is usually kept at temperatures upwards of 100°C.|$|E
25|$|To control {{trajectory}} at liftoff and supersonic speeds, <b>heat-resistant</b> graphite vanes {{were used as}} rudders in the exhaust jet.|$|E
25|$|Polyetheretherketone (PEEK) – strong, chemical- and <b>heat-resistant</b> thermoplastic, {{biocompatibility}} {{allows for}} use in medical implant applications, aerospace moldings. One {{of the most expensive}} commercial polymers.|$|E
25|$|As briefly {{discussed}} above, {{the stresses}} involved in firing {{this sort of}} device require an extremely <b>heat-resistant</b> material. Otherwise the rails, barrel, and all equipment attached would melt or be irreparably damaged.|$|E
25|$|It {{is clear}} that any object {{traveling}} at hypersonic speeds will likewise {{be exposed to the}} same extreme temperatures as the gas behind the nose shock wave, and hence choice of <b>heat-resistant</b> materials becomes important.|$|E
25|$|There {{are some}} NASA {{spin-off}} technologies {{related to the}} Space Shuttle program which have been successfully developed into commercial products, such as using <b>heat-resistant</b> materials developed to protect the Shuttle on reentry, in suits for municipal and aircraft rescue firefighters.|$|E
25|$|Formica {{is a hard}} durable plastic {{laminate}} used for countertops, cupboard doors, and other surfaces which are <b>heat-resistant</b> and easy to clean. Formica was invented in 1913 by Herbert A Faber and Daniel J. O'Connor of Westinghouse Electric.|$|E
25|$|An {{ironing board}} is a {{portable}} and foldable {{table with a}} <b>heat-resistant</b> top used in the aid of removing wrinkles from clothing with an iron and spray starch. The first ironing board was co-patented on February 16, 1858, by inventors William Vandenburg and James Harvey of New York City.|$|E
25|$|A {{restored}} Columbia {{was used}} in episode 19 ("Wild Horses") of the anime Cowboy Bebop to rescue Spike when his Swordfish enters a steep orbit {{and is going to}} burn up. After the rescue, the shuttle crash-lands after losing <b>heat-resistant</b> tiles. The anime, made in 1998, predated the Columbia disaster by five years.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} recent {{commissioned}} works is the “Vochol,” a Volkswagen Beetle which was covered in Huichol designs using 2,277,000 beads fastened to the body of the car using a special <b>heat-resistant</b> resin. The car was commissioned by the Association of Friends of the Museo de Arte Popular and other public and private enterprises to be auctioned off to benefit Mexican artisans.|$|E
25|$|Natural {{graphite}} {{has found}} uses in zinc-carbon batteries, in electric motor brushes, and various specialized applications. Graphite of various hardness or softness results in different qualities and tones when {{used as an}} artistic medium. Railroads would often mix powdered graphite with waste oil or linseed oil to create a <b>heat-resistant</b> protective coating for the exposed portions of a steam locomotive's boiler, such as the smokebox or {{lower part of the}} firebox.|$|E
25|$|C. difficile is {{transmitted}} {{from person to person}} by the fecal-oral route. The organism forms <b>heat-resistant</b> spores that are not killed by alcohol-based hand cleansers or routine surface cleaning. Thus, these spores survive in clinical environments for long periods. Because of this, the bacteria may be cultured from almost any surface. Once spores are ingested, their acid-resistance allows them to pass through the stomach unscathed. Upon exposure to bile acids, they germinate and multiply into vegetative cells in the colon.|$|E
25|$|The {{redesigned}} 747-400 interior features new cabin sidewalls, <b>heat-resistant</b> phenolic glass, {{carbon composite}} paneling, and larger storage bins. An enhanced in-flight entertainment framework, called the Advanced Cabin Entertainment/Service System (ACESS), debuted on 747-400, which integrates 18-channel audio capability, four passenger intercom announcement zones, inter-cabin telephones, and passenger lighting into a central system. An eight-bunk overhead crew rest is installed above the aft cabin, while a second crew rest area {{is located on}} the upper deck behind the cockpit for flight crew use.|$|E
25|$|A {{bloomery}} {{is basically}} an enlarged blacksmith's hearth. It {{consists of a}} pit or chimney with <b>heat-resistant</b> walls made of earth, clay, or stone. (Sandstone was used at Cornwall.) Near the bottom, one or more clay pipes enter through the side walls. These pipes, called tuyeres, allow air to enter the furnace, either by natural draft or by forced with a bellows. An opening {{at the bottom of}} the bloomery may be used to remove the bloom, or the bloomery can be tipped over and the bloom removed from the bottom.|$|E
25|$|Underwood {{approached}} William Thompson Sedgwick, {{the chair}} of the Biology department at MIT about the concerns he had with product swells and explosion of cans of clams. Sedgwick conferred with his assistant, Samuel Cate Prescott, and from late 1895 to late 1896, Prescott and Underwood worked on the problem every afternoon, focusing on canned clams. They discovered that the clams contained <b>heat-resistant</b> bacterial spores that were able to survive the processing; then they learned that these spores' presence depended on the clams' living environment, and finally that these spores would be killed if processed at 250°F (121°C) for 10 minutes in a retort.|$|E
25|$|Inclusion of {{plasticizers}} {{tends to}} lower Tg and increase polymer flexibility. Plasticizers are generally small molecules that are chemically {{similar to the}} polymer and create gaps between polymer chains for greater mobility and reduced interchain interactions. A {{good example of the}} action of plasticizers is related to polyvinylchlorides or PVCs. An uPVC, or unplasticized polyvinylchloride, is used for things such as pipes. A pipe has no plasticizers in it, because it needs to remain strong and <b>heat-resistant.</b> Plasticized PVC is used in clothing for a flexible quality. Plasticizers are also put in some types of cling film to make the polymer more flexible.|$|E
25|$|Many plastic {{items for}} medical or {{laboratory}} use {{can be made}} from polypropylene because it can withstand the heat in an autoclave. Its heat resistance also enables it to be used as the manufacturing material of consumer-grade kettles. Food containers made from it will not melt in the dishwasher, and do not melt during industrial hot filling processes. For this reason, most plastic tubs for dairy products are polypropylene sealed with aluminum foil (both <b>heat-resistant</b> materials). After the product has cooled, the tubs are often given lids made of a less <b>heat-resistant</b> material, such as LDPE or polystyrene. Such containers provide a good hands-on example of the difference in modulus, since the rubbery (softer, more flexible) feeling of LDPE with respect to polypropylene of the same thickness is readily apparent. Rugged, translucent, reusable plastic containers made {{in a wide variety of}} shapes and sizes for consumers from various companies such as Rubbermaid and Sterilite are commonly made of polypropylene, although the lids are often made of somewhat more flexible LDPE so they can snap on to the container to close it. Polypropylene can also be made into disposable bottles to contain liquid, powdered, or similar consumer products, although HDPE and polyethylene terephthalate are commonly also used to make bottles. Plastic pails, car batteries, wastebaskets, pharmacy prescription bottles, cooler containers, dishes and pitchers are often made of polypropylene or HDPE, both of which commonly have rather similar appearance, feel, and properties at ambient temperature.|$|E
25|$|The way windcatchers work is {{that the}} moving air masses (wind, breeze, etc.) {{at the top of}} windcatchers create a {{pressure}} gradient between the top of the windcatcher and its base, inside, {{at the bottom of the}} shaft. This pressure gradient sucks out rising hot air from inside the shaft while the colder dense air remains. The superb <b>heat-resistant</b> material of the walls of the ab anbar further create an insulating effect that tends to lower the temperature inside an ab anbar, similar to a cave. The ventilating effect of the windcatchers prevent any stagnant air and hence any dew or humidity from forming inside, and the overall effect is pure, clean, cold water all year round.|$|E
25|$|As {{the largest}} private sector {{chemical}} engineering, procurement and construction management ("EPC") service provider in China in terms of revenue for 2011, as estimated by CMAI (Shanghai) Limited (CMAI), an independent industry consultant. The company specializes {{in the provision of}} construction and technical services for engineering installations in the petrochemical, coal-to-chemical and refining industries. From project planning and consultation to design, procurement and construction phase project management, as well as start-up and operational services, the company provides solutions to domestic and foreign clients. Aside from the provision of EPC service, the Company manufactures integrated piping systems comprising <b>heat-resistant</b> alloy tubes and fittings through its wholly owned subsidiary, Wison (Yangzhou) Chemical Machinery Co., Ltd.|$|E
25|$|Economic {{resources}} of the Rocky Mountains are varied and abundant. Minerals found in the Rocky Mountains include significant deposits of copper, gold, lead, molybdenum, silver, tungsten, and zinc. The Wyoming Basin and several smaller areas contain significant reserves of coal, natural gas, oil shale, and petroleum. For example, the Climax mine, located near Leadville, Colorado, was the largest producer of molybdenum in the world. Molybdenum is used in <b>heat-resistant</b> steel in such things as cars and planes. The Climax mine employed over 3,000 workers. The Coeur d'Alene mine of northern Idaho produces silver, lead, and zinc. Canada's largest coal mines are near Fernie, British Columbia and Sparwood, British Columbia; additional coal mines exist near Hinton, Alberta, and in the Northern Rockies surrounding Tumbler Ridge, British Columbia.|$|E
25|$|The {{mechanics}} of drag systems usually consist of {{any number of}} discs (drag washers) arranged in a stack on the spool shaft or in some cases, on the drive shaft. There is generally a screw or lever mechanism that presses against the washers—the higher the pressure, the greater the resistance. Drag washers are commonly made of materials such as steel, Teflon, carbon fiber, other reinforced plastics or metal alloys. Since large fish can generate a lot of pulling power, reels with higher available drag forces (which generate greater heat) for higher-test lines will use stronger and more <b>heat-resistant</b> materials than reels designed for low-test lines. A good drag system is consistent (generates the same force over and over), durable and smooth (no jerkiness).|$|E
25|$|On flight day 12, {{the crew}} of space shuttle Discovery secured the MPLM Leonardo in the payload bay for return to earth. Mission {{specialist}} Dorothy Metcalf-Lindenburger activated the latches to secure Leonardo in the payload bay at 07:15 UTC (03:15 EDT). After Leonardo was secured, Metcalf-Lindenburger, pilot Jim Dutton began the late inspection of Discoverys heat shield. The pair were joined by commander Alan Poindexter and mission specialist Naoko Yamazaki to complete the inspection of the shuttle's Reinforced Carbon-Carbon (RCC) panels on the wings and nose and the <b>heat-resistant</b> tiles. The scan which takes about 7 hours was completed 3 hours ahead of schedule, and was done while still docked to the International Space Station (ISS) due {{to the loss of}} the shuttles Ku-Band antenna.|$|E
25|$|Named after John Tyndall, Tyndallization is an {{obsolete}} and lengthy process {{designed to}} reduce the level of activity of sporulating bacteria that are left by a simple boiling water method. The process involves boiling for a period (typically 20 minutes) at atmospheric pressure, cooling, incubating for a day, then repeating the process {{a total of three}} to four times. The incubation periods are to allow <b>heat-resistant</b> spores surviving the previous boiling period to germinate to form the heat-sensitive vegetative (growing) stage, which can be killed by the next boiling step. This is effective because many spores are stimulated to grow by the heat shock. The procedure only works for media that can support bacterial growth, and will not sterilize non-nutritive substrates like water. Tyndallization is also ineffective against prions.|$|E
25|$|In training, {{the damage}} control team specializing in on-deck {{firefighting}} for Forrestal (Damage Control Team #8, led by Chief Petty Officer Gerald Farrier) had been shown films of Navy ordnance tests demonstrating how a 1000-lb bomb could be directly {{exposed to a}} jet fuel fire for a full 10 minutes and still be extinguished and cooled without an explosive cook-off. However, these tests were conducted using the new Mark 83 1000lb bombs, which featured relatively stable Composition H6 explosive and thicker, <b>heat-resistant</b> cases, compared to their predecessors; H6, which is still used in many types of naval ordnance due to its relative insensitivity to heat, shock and electricity, is also designed to deflagrate instead of detonate when it reaches its ignition point in a fire, either melting the case and producing no explosion at all, or, at most, a subsonic low order detonation {{at a fraction of}} its normal power.|$|E
500|$|The World Health Organization {{recommends}} any of {{the following}} three procedures for the sterilization of all <b>heat-resistant</b> surgical instruments to ensure that they are not contaminated with prions: ...|$|E
500|$|A {{thermal imaging}} camera {{consists}} of five components: an optic system, detector, amplifier, signal processing, and display. [...] Fire-service specific thermal imaging cameras incorporate these components in a <b>heat-resistant,</b> ruggedized, and waterproof housing. These parts {{work together to}} render infrared radiation, such as that given off by warm objects or flames, into a visible light representation in real time.|$|E
500|$|Exhaust {{heat from}} the V-22's engines can {{potentially}} damage the ships' flight decks and coatings. Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) devised a temporary fix of portable heat shields placed under the engines, and determined that a long-term solution would require redesigning decks with heat resistant coating, passive thermal barriers, and ship structure changes. Similar changes are required for F-35B operations. In 2009, DARPA requested solutions for installing robust flight deck cooling. A <b>heat-resistant</b> anti-skid metal spray named Thermion, has been tested on [...]|$|E
500|$|A {{decision}} was made to replace the six NR-23 guns in the nose with four AM-23 cannon with 225 rounds per gun that had a rate of fire 50% greater than that of the NR-23 and to totally revise the gun installation. The guns were moved to the very tip of the nose in a separate compartment made of <b>heat-resistant</b> steel and provided with a special blast deflector chamber to deflect the blast gasses away from the engine inlets. [...] Two doors were provided {{at the bottom of the}} chamber to ventilate the chamber while firing. One problem occurred almost immediately during testing when the blast gases accumulated in the section where spent cartridges and links were saved and sometimes ignited. Occasionally this was strong enough to actually deform the chamber. The spent shell case section was thoroughly ventilated and muzzle brakes were introduced to successfully cure the problem.|$|E
500|$|Due to the vehicle's {{use of a}} low-density fuel in {{the form}} of liquid hydrogen, a great volume is {{required}} to contain enough energy to reach orbit. The propellant is intended to be kept at low pressure to minimise stress; a vehicle that is both large and light has an advantage during atmospheric reentry compared to other vehicles due to a low ballistic coefficient. Because of the low ballistic coefficient, Skylon would be slowed at higher altitudes where the air is thinner; as a consequence, the skin of the vehicle would reach only [...] In contrast, the smaller Space Shuttle was heated to 2,000K on its leading edge, and so employed an extremely <b>heat-resistant</b> but fragile silica thermal protection system. The Skylon design does not require such an approach, instead opting for using a far thinner yet durable reinforced ceramic skin; however, due to turbulent flow around the wings during re-entry, some sections of the vehicle shall need to be provided with active cooling systems.|$|E
