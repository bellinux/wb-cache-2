40|$|Depending on {{the size}} and type of boiler, the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments {{required}} specific reductions in SO{sub 2 } emissions from coal-fired electric utilities. To meet these requirements, SO{sub 2 } reduction strategies have included installing scrubbing technology, switching to a more expensive low-sulfur coal, or purchasing SO{sub 2 } allowances. It is expected {{that over the next}} 10 years there will be an increase in the price of low-sulfur coals, but that higher-sulfur coal costs will remain the same. Technologies must be strongly considered that allow the use of high-sulfur fuels {{while at the same time}} meeting current and future SO{sub 2 } emission limits. One such technology is the ammonia based flue gas desulfurization (FGD) (NH{sub 3 }-based FGD) system manufactured by Marsulex Environmental Technologies (MET). The MET scrubber is a patented NH{sub 3 }-based FGD process that efficiently converts SO{sub 2 } (> 95 %) into a fertilizer product, ammonium sulfate ([NH{sub 4 }]{sub 2 }SO{sub 4 }). A point of concern for the MET technology, as well as other FGD systems, is the emission of sulfuric acid/SO{sub 3 } aerosols that could result in increased opacity at the stack. This is a direct result of firing high-sulfur fuels that naturally generate more SO{sub 3 } than do low-sulfur coals. SO{sub 3 } is formed during the coal combustion process. SO{sub 3 } is converted to gaseous H{sub 2 }SO{sub 4 } by homogeneous condensation, leading to a submicron acid fume that is very difficult to capture in a <b>dry</b> <b>electrostatic</b> <b>precipitator</b> (ESP). The condensed acid can also combine with the fly ash in the duct and scale the duct wall, potentially resulting in corrosion of both metallic and nonmetallic surfaces. Therefore, SO{sub 3 } in flue gas can have a significant impact on the performance of coal-fired utility boilers, air heaters, and ESPs. In addition to corrosion problems, excess SO{sub 3 } emissions can result in plume opacity problems. Thus the Energy & Environmental Research Center (EERC) was contracted by MET and the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) to evaluate the potential of a wet ESP for reducing SO{sub 3 } emissions. The work consisted of pilot-scale tests using the EERC's slagging furnace system (SFS) to determine the effectiveness of a wet ESP to control SO{sub 3 }/H{sub 2 }SO{sub 4 } aerosol emissions in conjunction with a dry ESP and MET's NH{sub 3 }-based FGD. Because these compounds are in the form of fine particles, it is speculated that a relatively small, highly efficient wet ESP following the MET scrubber would remove these fine aerosol particles. The performance target for the wet ESP was a particulate mass collection efficiency of > 90 %; this level of performance would likely ensure a stack opacity of < 10 %...|$|E

40|$|Selected Papers {{from the}} 4 th European Conference on Sludge Management (ECSM 2014) Because fine {{particulate}} matter ≤ 2. 5 µm in diameter (PM 2. 5) causes health problems, PM 2. 5 emissions are of concern. However, little research on stationary sources has been conducted. To determine the concentration and filtration behavior of PM 2. 5, dust was collected from five fluid-bed sewage sludge incinerators (SSIs) sorted by particle size using cascade impactors. The average PM 2. 5 concentration was 0. 00014 – 4. 8 mg/Nm 3. The total estimated amount of PM 2. 5 emissions from the SSIs for all plants in Japan was 0. 96 – 8. 9 tons/year. Since the SSIs with <b>dry</b> <b>Electrostatic</b> <b>Precipitators</b> (EP) contributed 75 – 99 % {{of the total}} emissions, replacing dry EPs with bag filters would significantly reduce the PM 2. 5 emissions from SSI...|$|R
40|$|Gaseous exhaust of {{different}} industries contains dust particles {{of different}} chemical precipitates that are harmful for the environment. <b>Electrostatic</b> <b>Precipitators</b> are very {{often used in}} industries to filter their gaseous exhaust and to prevent the atmosphere to being polluted. <b>Electrostatic</b> <b>Precipitators</b> are very efficient in their work. <b>Electrostatic</b> <b>Precipitators</b> use {{the force of the}} electric field to separate the dust particles from gaseous exhaust. <b>Electrostatic</b> <b>Precipitators</b> charge the dust particles and remove these particles by attracting these charged dust particles toward the collecting plates. The charging of dust particles requires a charging zone. When gas passes through that charging zone, the dust particles in the gas stream become charged and then these charged particles are attracted toward the collecting plates. The design of an <b>Electrostatic</b> <b>Precipitators</b> requires the knowledge of its working principle and the problems that often arise during its working. This thesis is the study of the working and the problems of the <b>Electrostatic</b> <b>Precipitators.</b> The main reason for problems in working of an <b>Electrostatic</b> <b>Precipitator</b> is the dust resistivity.
