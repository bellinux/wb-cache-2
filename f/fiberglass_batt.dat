5000|$|The {{method of}} {{installation}} {{and type of}} drywall can reduce sound transmission through walls and ceilings. Several builders' books state that thicker drywall reduces sound transmission, but engineering manuals recommend using multiple layers of drywall, sometimes of different thicknesses and glued together, or special types of drywall designed to reduce noise. Also important are the construction details of the framing with steel studs, wider stud spacing, double studding, insulation, and other details reducing sound transmission. Sound transmission class (STC) ratings can be increased from 33 for an ordinary stud-wall to as high as 59 with double 1/2" [...] drywall {{on both sides of}} a wood stud wall with resilient channels on one side and <b>fiberglass</b> <b>batt</b> insulation between the studs.|$|E
50|$|There {{are many}} factors {{that come into}} play when using R-values to compute heat loss for a {{particular}} wall. Manufacturer R values apply only to properly installed insulation. Squashing two layers of batting into the thickness intended for one layer will increase but not double the R-value. (In other words, compressing a <b>fiberglass</b> <b>batt</b> decreases the R-value of the batt but increases the R-value per inch.) Another important factor to consider is that studs and windows provide a parallel heat conduction path that is unaffected by the insulation's R-value. The practical implication {{of this is that}} one could double the R-value of insulation installed between framing members and realize substantially less than a 50% reduction in heat loss. When installed between wall studs, even perfect wall insulation only eliminates conduction through the insulation but leaves unaffected the conductive heat loss through such materials as glass windows and studs. Insulation installed between the studs may reduce, but usually does not eliminate, heat losses due to air leakage through the building envelope. Installing a continuous layer of rigid foam insulation on the exterior side of the wall sheathing will interrupt thermal bridging through the studs while also reducing the rate of air leakage.|$|E

50|$|Most {{insulated}} {{buildings that}} utilize concrete block, brick, adobe, stone, veneers {{or some combination}} thereof feature interior insulation {{in the form of}} <b>fiberglass</b> <b>batts</b> between wooden wall studs or in the form of rigid insulation boards covered with plaster or drywall. In most climates this insulation is much more effective on the exterior of the wall, allowing the building interior {{to take advantage of the}} aforementioned thermal mass of the masonry. This technique does, however, require some sort of weather-resistant exterior surface over the insulation and, consequently, is generally more expensive.|$|R
40|$|Tests were {{conducted}} by Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) to determine {{the magnitude of the}} energy savings brought about by installing radiant barriers in the attics of single-family houses. The radiant barrier used for this test was a product with two reflective aluminum surfaces on a kraft paper base. The radiant barrier has the potential to reduce the radiant heat transfer component impinging on the fiberglass attic insulation. Working as a system in conjunction with an air space, the radiant barrier could theoretically block up to 95 % of far-infrared radiation heat transfer. The experiment was conducted in three unoccupied research houses that are operated by ORNL. One house was used as the control house (no barrier was installed), while the other two were used to test the two different methods for installing the radiant barriers. In one house, the barrier was laid on top of the attic <b>fiberglass</b> <b>batt</b> insulation, and in the other house, the barrier was attached to the underside of the roof trusses. The attics of all three houses were insulated with kraft paper faced nominal R- 19 <b>fiberglass</b> <b>batt</b> insulation. The results showed a savings in the cooling loads of 21 % when the radiant barrier was laid on top of the attic fiberglass insulation and 13 % with the radiant barrier attached to the underside of the roof trusses. The savings in electrical consumption was 17 % and 9 %, respectively. The electrical consumption data and the cooling load data indicated that the most effective way of installing the foil was to lay it on top of the <b>fiberglass</b> <b>batt</b> insulation. The radiant barriers reduced the measured peak ceiling heat fluxes by 39 % for the case where the barrier was laid on top of the attic fiberglass insulation. The radiant barrier reduced the integrated heat flows from the attic to house by approximately 30 - 35 % over a 7 -day time period...|$|E
40|$|House mice (Mus musculus) were {{introduced}} into 20, 4 -inch thick insulated panels and provided unlimited {{food and water}} for six months. Mouse populations increased 3 -to 4 -fold inside the insulated panels. Aluminum foil vapor barriers were severely damaged by mice and in all cases, reduced to {{less than half of}} their original mass. All of the insulation materials tested (insulation board, <b>fiberglass</b> <b>batt,</b> rockwool, beadboard, and vermiculite) sustained significant levels of damage as measured by increased thermal conductance. Researchers have yet to discover an insulative material that is not susceptible to house mouse damage. Producers should use construction techniques that exclude house mice and other rodents from insulated walls. In addition, house mouse populations in and around buildings should be controlled to minimize economic damage...|$|E
30|$|Madrzykowski and Fleischmann (2012) {{performed}} {{a study of}} the response of gypsum wallboard and the reproducibility of the damage pattern created when exposed to known heat release rate (HRR) fires with varying types of fuel sources and wall construction. The fuels used for their experiments included a natural gas burner, gasoline pool fire and polyurethane foam. The wall construction was varied between a single sheet of gypsum wallboard with wood framing, a gypsum wallboard front and back with wood framing and gypsum wallboard front and back with <b>fiberglass</b> <b>batt</b> insulation in the voids of the wood framing. The gypsum wallboard was covered with a primer and cover coats of latex paint. This study focused on the effects where the paper had been burned away (consumed) and where the paper had been peeled up (penetration). To accomplish this, the researchers evaluated the variability of the flame height in comparison to the height and area of damage. As expected, the results indicated that the patterns generated by the polyurethane foam fire had greater uncertainty than the natural gas and gasoline pool fires. The wall construction had no significant impact on the damage.|$|E
50|$|Cotton {{insulation}} {{is increasing}} in popularity as an environmentally preferable option for insulation. It has an R-value of around 3.7 (RSI-0.65), {{equivalent to the}} median value for <b>fiberglass</b> <b>batts.</b> The cotton is primarily recycled industrial scrap, providing a sustainability benefit. The batts do not use the toxic formaldehyde backing found in fiberglass, and the manufacture is nowhere near as energy intensive as the mining and production process required for fiberglass. Boric acid {{is used as a}} flame retardant. A small quantity of polyolefin is melted as an adhesive to bind the product together (and is preferable to formaldehyde adhesives). Installation is similar to fiberglass, without the need for a respirator but requiring some additional time to cut the material. As with any batt insulation, proper installation is important to ensure high energy efficiency.|$|R
5000|$|Adding {{absorptive}} {{materials to}} the interior surfaces of rooms (e.g. fabric-faced fiberglass panels, thick curtains) {{will result in a}} decrease of reverberated sound energy within the room. However, absorptive interior surface treatments do not significantly improve the sound isolation from one room to another through demising partitions over the typical frequency range measured currently. Installing absorptive insulation (e.g., <b>fiberglass</b> <b>batts,</b> blow-in cellulose, mineral fiber batts) into the wall or ceiling cavities affects the sound isolation of the partition to varying degrees, depending on the framing configuration and joist or stud depth. For example, the presence of type of insulation in single 2x4 wood stud framing spaced 16" [...] (406 mm) on-center results in only a few STC points. In contrast, adding standard fiberglass insulation to an otherwise empty cavity in light-gauge (25-gauge or lighter) steel stud partitions can result in a nearly 10 STC-point improvement. As the stud gauge becomes heavier, the presence and type of insulation matters less.|$|R
40|$|There {{has been}} a {{significant}} amount of {{research in the area of}} building energy efficiency and durability. However, well-documented quantitative information on the impact of crawlspaces on the performance of residential structures is lacking. The objective of this study was to evaluate and compare the effects of two crawlspace strategies on the whole-house performance of a pair of houses in a mixed humid climate. These houses were built with advanced envelope systems to provide energy savings of 50 % or more compared to traditional 2010 new construction. One crawlspace contains insulated walls and is sealed and semi-conditioned. The other is a traditional vented crawlspace with insulation in the crawlspace ceiling. The vented (traditional) crawlspace contains <b>fiberglass</b> <b>batts</b> installed in the floor chase cavities above the crawl, while the sealed and insulated crawlspace contains foil-faced polyisocyanurate foam insulation on the interior side of the masonry walls. Various sensors to measure temperatures, heat flux through crawlspace walls and ceiling, and relative humidity were installed in the two crawlspaces. Data from these sensors have been analyzed to compare the performance of the two crawlspace designs. The analysis results indicated that the sealed and insulated crawlspace design is better than the traditional vented crawlspace in the mixed humid climate...|$|R
40|$|There is {{a growing}} shift within the {{construction}} materials industry towards green and sustainable building products. Spending in this area has increased 5 fold since 2011 to a total revenue of $ 70 billion. An area of particular interest has been aimed at replacing <b>fiberglass</b> <b>batt</b> insulation with cellulose. Cellulose is the most abundant polymer on earth, and has potential to replace petroleum derived insulations. This project explores the potential of selectively isolating cellulose by depolymerizing the support structures found in lignocellulosic materials – specifically lignin and hemicellulose. The current focus is on isolating cellulose from Cannibas sativa, but more specifically, industrial hemp. Previous studies have successfully delignified industrial hemp using chlorite as a nucleophile that can selectively dissolve lignin and hemicellulose, but not cellulose. However, no study to date has explored the effects of selective depolymerization {{and its effects on}} thermal insulation (R-value). By selectively dissolving support biopolymers away from cellulose, it should induce macro and nano sized pores within the cellulose matrix – a change that may increase thermal resistivity. The project has characterized depolymerized industrial hemp with materials characterization techniques such as: Scanning Electron Microscopy, Thermal Gravimetric Analysis, X-ray Diffraction, and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy. Third party laboratory testing was conducted at RADCO Laboratories to determine insulating performance by adhering to ASTM C 518. Untreated industrial hemp had an R value of 2. 4 and the depolymerized hemp had an R value of 2. ...|$|E
40|$|In wall construction, highly {{conductive}} members spaced {{along the}} wall, which allow higher heat transfer than that through less conductive areas, {{are referred to}} as thermal bridges. Thermal bridges in walls tend to increase heat loss and, under certain adverse conditions, can cause dust streaking (``ghosting``) on interior walls over studs due to temperature differentials, as well as condensation in and on walls. Although such adverse conditions can be easily avoided by proper thermal design of wall systems, these effects have not been well understood and thermal data has been lacking. Therefore, the present study was initiated to provide (1) {{a better understanding of the}} thermal behavior of steel-framed walls, (2) a set of R-values for typical wall constructions, and (3) information that could be used to develop improved methods of predicting R-values. An improved method for estimating R-value would allow an equitable comparison of thermal performance with other construction types and materials. This would increase the number of alternative materials for walls available to designers, thus allowing them to choose the optimum choice for construction. Twenty-three wall samples were tested in a calibrated hot box (ASTM C 9761) to measure the thermal performance of steel-framed wall systems. The tests included an array of stud frame configurations, exterior sheathing and <b>fiberglass</b> <b>batt</b> insulations. Other studies have not included the use of insulating sheathing, which reduces the extent of the thermal bridges and improves total thermal performance. The purpose of the project was to provide measured R-values for commonly used steel-framed wall configurations and to improve R-value estimating methods. Test results were compared to R-value estimates using the parallel path method, the isothermal planes method and the ASHRAE Zone method. The comparison showed that the known procedures do not fully account for the three-dimensional effects created by steel framing in a wall...|$|E
40|$|Hemcrete is an alternative, environmentally‐friendly {{building}} material gaining adherents in Great Britain and other European countries. It {{is an attractive}} choice as a {{building material}} because it is made from a renewable resource, hemp, a hardy plant that is a close, but non‐hallucinogenic relative of marijuana. This plant {{is relatively easy to}} cultivate, requires {{little in the way of}} pesticides or fertilizers, and almost all parts can be used for various products from paper to textiles to food. Hemcrete is made from a mixture of lime, water, and the fibrous outer portion of the hemp plant called the “hurd” or “shive”. When mixed, it is worked and placed much like conventional concrete ‐ hence the name. However, that is where the similarities with concrete end. Hemcrete is not comparable to concrete on a strength basis, and is better described as an alternative insulation product. When built into walls of sufficient thickness, Hemcrete offers high thermal efficiency, and has strong claims to being carbon negative. The purpose of this study was to evaluate this claim of carbon negativity, and to compare these environmentally friendly qualities against conventional <b>fiberglass</b> <b>batt</b> insulation. Our model was constructed using two identically sized “walls” measuring eight feet square by one foot in depth, one insulated using Hemcrete, and the other using fiberglass. Our study focused on three areas: water usage, cost, and carbon dioxide emissions. We chose water usage because we wanted to determine the feasibility of using Hemcrete in the Phoenix metropolitan region, where water is a troubled resource. Secondly, we wished to evaluate the claim on carbon negativity, so CO 2 equivalents throughout the production process were measured. Finally, we wished to know whether Hemcrete could compete on a cost basis with more conventional insulation methods, so we also built in a price comparison. Since the cultivation of hemp is currently unlawful in the United States, this study can help determine whether these restrictions should be relaxed in order to allow the construction of buildings insulated with Hemcrete...|$|E

A small roof cavity with little room for insulation at the eaves is often the case with single-wide units and limits practical ways to improve thermal performance. The purpose of the current tests was to obtain steady-state performance data for the roof cavity of the manufactured home test section when the roof cavity was insulated with <b>fiberglass</b> <b>batts,</b> blown-in rock wool insulation or combinations of these insulations and powder-filled evacuated panel (PEP) insulation. Four insulation configurations were tested: (A) a configuration with two layers of nominal R{sub US}- 7 h {center_dot} ft{sup 2 } {center_dot} F/BTU (R{sub SI}- 1. 2 m{sup 2 } {center_dot} K/W) fiberglass batts; (B) a layer of PEPs and one layer of the fiberglass batts; (C) four layers of the fiberglass batts; and (D) an average 4. 1 in. (10. 4 cm) thick layer of blown-in rock wool at an average density of 2. 4 lb/ft{sup 3 } (38 kg/m{sup 3 }). Effects of additional sheathing were determined for Configurations B and C. With Configuration D over the ceiling, two layers of expanded polystyrene (EPS) boards, each about the same thickness as the PEPs, were installed over the trusses instead of the roof. Aluminum foils facing the attic and over the top layer of EPS were added. The top layer of EPS was then replaced by PEPs...|$|R
40|$|During January and May, 2009, two {{configurations}} of steel-framed walls constructed with conventional 2 × 4 steel studs insulated with either R- 19, approximately 14 cm (5. 5 in.) thick, or R- 13, approximately 9 cm (3. 5 in.) thick, <b>fiberglass</b> insulation <b>batts</b> {{were tested in}} the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) guarded hot box using the ASTM Standard C 1363 test procedure. The first test wall used conventional 2 × 4 steel studs insulated with 2. 5 cm (1 in.) thick foam profiles, called stud-snugglers. These stud-snugglers converted the 2 × 4 wall assembly into a 2 × 6 assembly, allowing application of R- 19 fiberglass insulation. The second wall tested for comparison was a conventional 2 × 4 steel stud wall using R- 13 insulation batts. Furthermore, numerical simulations were performed in order to evaluate the steady-state thermal performance of various wood-and steel-framed wall assemblies.

40|$|ABSTRACT: By {{implementing}} various substrate {{barriers to}} a R- 30 <b>fiberglass</b> in-sulation <b>batt,</b> this research shows the overall {{changes in the}} substrate heat flux. Inde-pendently, a plastic vapor barrier, and both a perforated and nonperforated radiant barrier are analyzed in this study. Conduction, radiation heat transfer, and moisture (mass) transport {{are considered to be}} the main contributors to heat transport within attic fiberglass insulation. A transient, one-dimensional, computational thermal model has been developed to simultaneously model all three of these heat transport mechanisms, which allows the total heat flux at the attic insulation substrate to be predicted. This numerical model has the capabilities to determine the effect on each of the three modes of heat transfer once a substrate barrier has been added. Summer-time experimental data were collected at an occupied North Mississippi residence for cases with and without a vapor barrier at the substrate for R- 30 fiberglass insulation. Within this investigation, experimental and predicted total heat transfer results are compared and analyzed. Profiles such as temperature-time histories, vapor H 2 O con-centrations, and individual modes of heat transfer plots are presented to support the experimentally determined overall effects on the heat transfer at the substrate once a substrate barrier has been implemented...|$|R

Other materials like polystyrene or packaging peanuts have been economically used, and provide a purposeful use of recycled materials. A wall consisting of merely cordwood and mortar does not usually provide sufficient insulation for comfortable living in snowy regions, unless it is of the highly insulative Throughwall type.|$|R
