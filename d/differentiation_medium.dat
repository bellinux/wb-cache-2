40|$|AbstractPluripotent mouse {{embryonic}} stem cells (ESCs) derived from the early blastocyst can differentiate in vitro {{into a variety of}} somatic cell types including lineages from all three embryonic germ layers.

A serum-free <b>differentiation</b> (SFD) <b>medium</b> completely lacking exogenous retinoids was devised that allows for efficient conversion of aggregated mouse ESCs into neural precursors and immature neurons. Neural cells produced in this medium express neuronal ion channels, establish polarity, and form functional excitatory and inhibitory synapses.

Differentiation without RA yields neurons and neural progenitors with apparent telencephalic identity, whereas cells differentiated with exposure to RA express markers of hindbrain and spinal cord.

40|$|Terminal {{differentiation}} of myogenic cells {{has long been}} known to be positively regulated by insulin-like growth factors (IGFs). Arg 8 -vasopressin (AVP) has been recently reported to potently induce myogenic differentiation. In the present study, the effects and the mechanisms of action of AVP and IGFs on myogenic cells have been investigated under conditions allowing growth and {{differentiation of}} myogenic cells in a simple serum-free medium. Under these conditions, L 6 and L 5 myogenic cells slowly proliferate and do not undergo differentiation (less than 1 % fusion up to 7 days). AVP rapidly (2 - 3 days) and dose-dependently induces the formation of multinucleated myotubes. Creatine kinase activity and myosin accumulation are strongly up-regulated by AVP. Insulin or IGF-I or IGF-II, at concentrations that cause extensive <b>differentiation</b> in serum-containing <b>medium,</b> induces a modest degree of <b>differentiation</b> in serum-free <b>medium.</b> The simultaneous presence of AVP and of one of the IGFs in the synthetic <b>medium</b> induces maximal <b>differentiation</b> of L 6, L 5, and satellite cells. The expression of both myogenin and Myf- 5 is dramatically stimulated by AVP. Our results indicate that AVP induces a significant level of myogenic differentiation in the absence of other factors. Furthermore, they suggest that to express their full myogenic potential, IGFs require the presence of other factors normally present in serum and fully mimicked by AVP.

We investigated it by following the in vitro and in vivo differentiation of several androgenetic, biparental, parthenogenetic, and androgenetic Igf 2 −/− murine ES cell lines; these cells differed in endogenous IGF-II levels because Igf 2 is paternally expressed in the mouse embryo in most tissues. The expression of mesoderm markers and the subsequent formation of muscle structures were correlated with endogenous IGF-II level during teratoma formation and during in vitro differentiation. In addition, the absence of Igf 2 in androgenetic Igf 2 −/− ES cells led to a severe impairment of mesoderm development, demonstrating the dependence of the preferential mesoderm development of androgenetic ES cells upon Igf 2 activity, among the numerous known imprinted genes. The addition of exogenous IGF-II to in vitro <b>differentiation</b> culture <b>medium</b> led to a specific increase in the expression of mesoderm markers.

Immunohistochemical analysis of ATP 6 V 0 D 2 in growth cartilage showed stronger staining in hypertrophic than in reserve zone or proliferative chondrocytes.

The differentiation markers, homeobox B 2 (HoxB 2), collagen type IV and laminin B 2, were not induced by growth arrest. Treatment with all-trans retinoic acid (RA) produced a dose-dependent increase in alkaline phosphatase activity, which was unchanged in lysine-deficient medium and reduced in low-serum medium. Low-serum medium also reduced HoxB 2 expression. There was a transient 2 - 6 -fold increase in mRNAs for C/EBP-beta, gadd 153 /CHOP- 10 and gas 5 genes 24 h after transfer to amino-acid-deficient media. The mRNAs for the gas 2 and gas 6 genes began to rise slowly by 5 - 10 -fold after a delay of approx. 24 h.

Immunofluorescence and RT-qPCR demonstrated in vivo keratocyte expression of ALDH 3 A 1, CD 34 and keratocan, but not any of the typical MSC markers (CD 73, CD 90, CD 105). As the keratocytes were expanded in vitro, the phenotypic profile reversed and the cells expressed MSC markers but not keratocyte markers. Differentiating the cMSC back to a keratocyte phenotype using non-supplemented, serum-free medium restored keratocyte markers but did not maintain cell viability or support corneal extracellular matrix (ECM) production. Supplementing the <b>differentiation</b> <b>medium</b> with combinations of fibroblast growth factor- 2 (FGF- 2), transforming growth factor-β 3 (TGF-β 3) and retinoic acid (RA) maintained viability, restored expression of CD 34, ALDH 3 A 1 and keratocan, and facilitated production of abundant ECM as shown by immunofluorescent staining for collagen-I and lumican, alongside quantitative assays for collagen and glycosaminoglycan production.

40|$|The {{influences}} of cell density, <b>differentiation,</b> and <b>medium</b> calcium levels on glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis were evaluated in cultured human epidermal keratinocytes. Following metabolic labeling with [35 S]-sulfate and [3 H]-glucosamine {{under steady state}} conditions in “high” medium calcium (> 1. 0 mMol), the majority of sulfated glycosaminoglycans remained associated with the cell layers, whereas hyaluronic acid, which was present in smaller amounts than the sulfated products, was about equally distributed between the medium and the cell layers. Of the sulfated glycosaminoglycans, heparan sulfate and chondroitin 4 / 6 -sulfate were the major species and were present in roughly comparable amounts, whereas dermatan sulfate was quantitatively the lesser of the products. The effects of “low” medium calcium (0. 3 and 0. 025 mM) were complex, although a consistent decrease in the incorporation of the [3 H]-glucosamine precursor was found at high cell density, probably reflecting a decrease in its intracellular specific activity. In “high” calcium cultures, {{there was a strong}} inverse correlation (r = - 0. 92) between keratinocyte cell number and cellular production of sulfated glycosaminoglycans, whereas no such relationship was evident in cultures grown in “low” calcium medium at comparable cell density. Because keratinocyte differentiation is inhibited in the low calcium conditions, the results suggest that the decrease in production of sulfated glycosaminoglycans by confluent keratinocytes may actually correlate with differentiation rather than with cell number...|$|R
40|$|AbstractUsing {{specific}} antisera, {{the expression}} of the G protein α subunits, G 8, gi 1, Gi 2, Gi 3, and G 0, were determined in 3 T 3 -F 442 A cells during their differentiation to adipocytes in a hormonally defined <b>medium.</b> <b>Differentiation</b> caused distinct increases in {{the expression of}} two Gs isoforms and decreases in the expression of both Gi 2 and Gi 3. Differentiation also resulted in a 2 - to 4 -fold increase in forskolin-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity and a 15 -fold increase in the response of cells to a β-adrenergic agonist. The increase in Gs expression was also observed, to a lesser degree, in cells maintained at confluence under conditions where morphological conversion was negligible and the decreased expression of Gi 2 and Gi 3 and the increased β-adrenergic responsiveness did not occur...|$|R
