40|$|In Colombia, mainly classic {{forensic}} medicine methods {{were used to}} clarify crimes until 2004. However, other disciplines, including forensic entomology, started to be considered only after the New Accusatory System introduction in Bogotá and the Coffee Region in 2005. In order to provide tools for obtaining evidentiary material elements in judicial trials, it is presented here the succession of insects throughout the decomposition process of an <b>exposed</b> <b>carcass</b> of Sus scrofa Linnaeus 1758 (Suidae) and the Occurrence Matrix of colonizing species. This process was evaluated under ambient conditions in the Andean rural area {{of the city of}} Pereira, in the Mundo Nuevo district, located in a pre-montane Wet Forest area, from October to November 2006. A sampling period of 27 days and 3198 individuals were collected. We found these colonizing species in the following stages of decomposition: Lucilia eximia (Wiedemann, 1819) fresh; Hemilucilia semidiaphana (Rondani, 1850), Oxelytrum discicolle (Brullé, 1840), and Cochliomyia macellaria (Fabricius 1775) bloated; Chrysomya albiceps (Wiedemann 1819), Compsomyiops verena (Walker, 1849), Ophyra aenescens (Wiedemann, 1830) and Musca domestica Linnaeus, 1758 active; Fannia sp. advanced and Stearibia nigriceps (Meigen, 1826) remains.

For example, Mumbai has over 12 million human residents, of whom over half are slum-dwellers. At least five hundred tons of garbage remain uncollected daily. Therefore, conditions are perfect for supporting a particularly large population of stray dogs. India has the highest number of human rabies deaths in the world (estimated at 20,000 per annum).|$|R
40|$|Pig carcasses, {{as human}} proxies, {{were placed on}} the seabed at a depth of 300 m, in the Strait of Georgia and {{observed}} continuously by a remotely operated camera and instruments. Two carcasses were deployed in spring and two in fall utilizing Ocean Network Canada's Victoria Experimental Network under the Sea (formerly VENUS) observatory. A trial experiment showed that bluntnose sixgill sharks could rapidly devour a carcass so a platform was designed which held two matched <b>carcasses,</b> one fully <b>exposed,</b> the other covered in a barred cage to protect it from sharks, while still allowing invertebrates and smaller vertebrates access. The carcasses were deployed under a frame which supported a video camera, and instruments which recorded oxygen, temperature, salinity, density, pressure, conductivity, sound speed and turbidity at per minute intervals. The spring <b>exposed</b> <b>carcass</b> was briefly fed upon by sharks, but they were inefficient feeders and lost interest after a few bites. Immediately after deployment, all carcasses, in both spring and fall, were very rapidly covered in vast numbers of lyssianassid amphipods. These skeletonized the carcasses by Day 3 in fall and Day 4 in spring. A dramatic, very localized drop in dissolved oxygen levels occurred in fall, exactly coinciding with the presence of the amphipods. Oxygen levels returned to normal once the amphipods dispersed. Either the physical presence of the amphipods or the sudden draw down of oxygen during their tenure, excluded other fauna. The amphipods fed from the inside out, removing the skin last. After the amphipods had receded, other fauna colonized such as spot shrimp and a few Dungeness crabs but by this time, all soft tissue had been removed. The amphipod activity caused major bioturbation in the local area and possible oxygen depletion. The spring deployment carcasses became covered in silt and a black film formed on them and on the silt above them whereas the fall bones remained uncovered and hence continued to be attractive to large numbers of spot shrimp. The carcass remains were recovered after 166 and 134 days respectively for further study...|$|R
40|$|As carcass {{disposal}} options become limited, {{it is important}} that the disposal tools implemented protect human, livestock and environmental health. Burial, composting, and rendering are among the most common methods. With shallow burial or dragging carcasses out back, there are issues with wildlife and pets being <b>exposed</b> to <b>carcasses</b> and liquids leaving the carcass. Carcass burial is legal in most states but there is little assurance that pathogens are killed and the concentration of carcasses could affect ground or surface water. Burying animals does not ensure that they will degrade. Composting is a viable option that may provide the assurance needed to reduce the risk of disease affecting health or the environment. A comparison of disposal options shows that properly composted carcasses generate little leachate and that pathogen levels are reduced to lower than soil background levels. If composting is performed using too dense material that is not able to reach temperature, more leachate is generated and can become problematic in terms of nutrient loading as well as resulting in higher pathogen levels in the end product. Research shows there is flexibility in the process (as long as carbon source is not too dense) and composting can be used as a safe disposal method...|$|R
40|$|Xylanase is an {{exogenous}} {{enzyme that}} {{is added to}} non-ruminants diets in order to break down and ameliorate the effects that non-starch polysaccharides (NSPs) have on feed digestibility. Dietary supplementary xylanase reduces viscosity of the digesta to improve feed digestibility and growth performance. Recently a study in broiler chickens (Singh et al., 2012) showed {{a significant increase in}} circulating serum peptide-YY (PYY) concentration (p< 0. 001) in response to xylanase supplementation. PYY is a satiety hormone that inhibits gastric motility, increasing digesta retention times in non-ruminants which has also been identified to occur in studies where xylanase has been supplemented. It is thought this could potentially be another mechanism by which xylanase exerts its beneficial effects on growth outcomes. Therefore the aim of the current study was to explore the effects that xylanase (16, 000 BXU/kg diet, Econase XT, AB Vista, UK) supplementation, of a wheat-based feed, has on growth performance parameters and gut/metabolic hormones that are produced from the gastrointestinal tract in pigs, and if age at supplementation affects the efficacy of the enzyme. In a preliminary trial a human multiplex assay (Human Metabolic Hormone Milliplex HMHMAG 34 k kit, Merck Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) was successfully used to measure porcine gut/metabolic hormones simultaneously, and the assay was hence used in subsequent trials. In the same trial it was determined that animals subjected to commercial slaughter (S), which had an increased time to tissue sample collection (approximately 18 hours) and <b>exposes</b> <b>carcasses</b> to a 60 °C water bath, did not affect the quality of RNA extracted from gut, pancreatic and liver tissue and subsequent relative abundance of gene transcripts over animals not subjected to this slaughter method (NS). In two trials on weaned piglets, it was found that dietary xylanase supplementation at 0 - 2 weeks post-wean decreased glucose-dependent insulinotrophic peptide (GIP), glucagon like peptide- 1 (GLP- 1) and pancreatic polypeptide (PP) plasma concentrations (p< 0. 05) which resulted in a tendency for insulin and C-peptide (p< 0. 08) to be decreased in these animals when bloods were analysed at 6 weeks post-wean. Also at this time point PYY concentrations were found to be decreased (p< 0. 01) in animals fed diets supplemented with xylanase between 2 and 6 weeks post-wean. In a third trial, when blood parameters were measured at 13 weeks post-wean, leptin and ghrelin levels were higher in animals provided with the exogenous enzyme, supplemented feed at 0 - 2 weeks post-wean. In conclusion, it was found growth performance in pigs fed a wheat-based diet supplemented with xylanase was not significantly improved at any age. However timing and/or duration of supplementation affected production of certain gut/metabolic hormones, in particular those produced in the pancreas or those that influence production of these hormones, suggesting dietary xylanase supplementation fed to weaned pigs may affect pancreas function and development...|$|R

40|$|Background: Micro-organisms {{transmitted}} from vertebrate animals - including livestock - to humans account {{for an estimated}} 60 % of human pathogens. Micro-organisms can be transmitted through inhalation, ingestion, via conjunctiva or physical contact. Close contact with animals is crucial for transmission. The role of intensity and type of contact patterns between livestock and humans for disease transmission is poorly understood. In this systematic review we aimed to summarise current knowledge regarding patterns of human-livestock contacts and their role in micro-organism transmission. Methods: We included peer-reviewed publications published between 1996 and 2014 in our systematic review if they reported on human-livestock contacts, human cases of livestock-related zoonotic diseases or serological epidemiology of zoonotic diseases in human samples. We extracted any information pertaining the type and intensity of human-livestock contacts and associated zoonoses. Results: 1522 papers were identified, 75 were included: 7 reported on incidental zoonoses after brief animal-human contacts (e. g. farm visits), 10 on environmental exposures and 15 on zoonoses in developing countries where backyard livestock keeping is still customary. 43 studies reported zoonotic risks in different occupations. Occupations at risk included veterinarians, culling personnel, slaughterhouse workers and farmers. For culling personnel, more hours exposed to livestock resulted in more frequent occurrence of transmission. Slaughterhouse workers in contact with live animals were more often positive for zoonotic micro-organisms compared to co-workers only <b>exposed</b> to <b>carcasses.</b> Overall, little information was available about the actual mode of micro-organism transmission. Conclusions: Little {{is known about the}} intensity and type of contact patterns between livestock and humans that result in micro-organism transmission. Studies performed in occupational settings provide some, but limited evidence of exposure response-like relationships for livestock-human contact and micro-organism transmission. Better understanding of contact patterns driving micro-organism transmission from animals to humans is needed to provide options for prevention and thus deserves more attention...|$|R

The two orders of insects that are most commonly used to help establish such things as time of death (Post Mortem Interval), location, and manner of death are Diptera and Coleoptera. Of these orders, blow flies (Diptera:Calliphoridae) are the insects of most importance because they colonize a corpse or carcass first, often within minutes of exposure. <b>Exposed</b> pig <b>carcasses</b> were used to survey the species of blow flies present in Brazos and Burleson Counties. Cynomyopsis (=Cynomya) cadaverina (Townsend), Calliphora vicina (Robineau-Desvoidy), and Calliphora livida (Hall) have proved to be the three most important species to colonize carcasses during the winter and early spring. These are blue bottle flies, and morphologically very similar. The larvae are so similar that taxonomic keys do not distinguish between C. livida and C. vicina. These species of blow flies were chosen for identification using a method involving analysis of their mitochondrial DNA. The results of this study have shown that the species of blow flies in a given geographical area (Brazos and Burleson Counties) differ between seasons and locations, and that analysis of the mtDNA of these flies can be used as a method of identification when morphological methods are unavailable. In addition, some common methods of preservation were tested in order to provide recommendations about how these methods affect the amplification of the mtDNA of preserved specimens...|$|R

For this purpose, the decomposition of six wild animal carcasses was observed in order to collect and identify the main species of necrophagous flies {{associated with}} the decomposition process. The carcasses were found on highways near the cities of Pelotas and Capão do Leão in the initial stage of decomposition, with no significant injuries or prior larval activity. Four wild animal models were represented in this study: two specimens of Didelphis albiventris Lund, 1840; two Tupinambis merianae Linnaeus, 1758; one Nothura maculosa Temminck, 1815; and one Cerdocyon thous Linnaeus, 1766. A total of 16, 242 flies from 14 species were reared in the laboratory, where Muscidae presented the greatest diversity of necrophagous species.

40|$|As {{a result}} of {{criminal}} activity, human bodies are sometimes dismembered and concealed within sealed, plastic waste sacks. Consequently, due to the inhibited ingress of insects and dismemberment, the rate of decomposition of the body parts within may be different to that of whole, exposed bodies. Correspondingly, once found, an estimation of the postmortem interval may be affected and lead to erroneous inferences. This study set out to determine whether insects were excluded and how rate of decomposition was affected inside such plastic sacks. The limbs, torsos and heads of 24 dismembered pigs were sealed using nylon cable ties within plastic garbage sacks, half of which were of a type claimed to repel insects. Using a body scoring scale to quantify decomposition, the body parts in the sacks were compared to those of ten <b>exposed,</b> whole pig <b>carcasses.</b> Insects {{were found to have}} entered both types of plastic sack. There was no difference in rate of decomposition in the two types of sack (F 1, 65 = 1. 78, p = 0. 19), but this was considerably slower than those of whole carcasses (F 1, 408 = 1453, p < 0. 001), with heads showing the largest differences. As well as a slower decomposition, sacks resulted in formation of some adipocere tissue as {{a result of}} high humidity within.

40|$|Oxygen minimum zones (OMZs) in {{the ocean}} are of key {{importance}} for pelagic fixed-nitrogen loss (N-loss) through microbial denitrification and anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox). Recent studies document that zooplankton is surprisingly abundant in and around OMZs and that the microbial community associated with carcasses of a large copepod species mediates denitrification. Here, we investigate the complex N-cycling associated with sinking zooplankton <b>carcasses</b> <b>exposed</b> to the steep O 2 gradient in a coastal OMZ (Golfo Dulce, Costa Rica). 15 N-stable-isotope enrichment experiments revealed that the carcasses of abundant copepods and ostracods provide anoxic microbial hotspots in the pelagic zone by hosting intense anaerobic N-cycle activities even {{in the presence of}} ambient O 2. Carcass-associated anaerobic N-cycling was clearly dominated by dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) at up to 30. 8 nmol NH 4 + individual− 1 d− 1, followed by denitrification (up to 10. 8 nmol N 2 -N individual− 1 d− 1), anammox (up to 1. 6 nmol N 2 -N individual− 1 d− 1), and N 2 O production (up to 1. 2 nmol N 2 O-N individual− 1 d− 1). In contrast, anaerobic N-cycling mediated by free-living bacteria proceeded mainly through anammox and denitrification in the anoxic bottom water, which underpins the distinctive microbial metabolism associated with zooplankton carcasses. Pelagic N-loss is potentially enhanced by zooplankton carcasses both directly through N 2 and N 2 O production, and indirectly through NH 4 + production that may fuel free-living anammox bacteria. We estimate that in the hypoxic water layer of Golfo Dulce, carcass-associated N 2 and N 2 O production enhance N-loss as much as 1. 4 -fold at a relative carcass abundance of 36 %. In the anoxic bottom water, however, N-loss is likely enhanced only marginally due to high ambient rates and low zooplankton abundance. Thus, zooplankton carcasses may enhance N-loss mainly at the hypoxic boundaries of OMZs which are usually more extensive in open-ocean than in coastal settings. Notably, these contributions by zooplankton carcasses to pelagic N-loss remain undetected by conventional, incubation-based rate measurements...|$|R
40|$|Human {{decomposition}} is a little-understood {{process with}} even less currently {{known about the}} microbiology involved. The aim {{of this research was}} to investigate the bacterial community associated with <b>exposed</b> decomposing mammalian <b>carcasses</b> on soil and to determine whether changes in this community could potentially be used to determine time since death in forensic investigations. A variety of soil chemistry and molecular biology methods, including molecular profiling tools T-RFLP and DGGE were used to explore how and when bacterial communities change {{during the course of a}} decomposition event. General bacterial populations and more specific bacterial groups were examined. Decomposition was shown to cause significant and sequential changes in the bacterial communities within the soil, and changes in the bacterial community often correlated with visual changes in the stage of decomposition. Organisms derived from the cadavers and carcasses were able to be detected, using molecular methods, in the underlying soil throughout the decomposition period studied. There was little correlation found between decomposition stage and the presence and diversity within the specific bacterial groups investigated. Organisms contributing to the changes seen in the bacterial communities using molecular profiling methods were identified using a cloning and sequencing based technique and included soil and environment-derived bacteria, as well as carcass or cadaver-derived organisms. This research demonstrated that pig (Sus scrofa) carcass and human cadaver decomposition result in similar bacterial community changes in soil, confirming that pig carcasses are a good model for studying the microbiology of human decomposition. The inability to control for differences between donated human cadavers made understanding the human cadaver results difficult, whereas pig carcass study allowed many variables to be held constant while others were investigated. The information gained from this study about the bacteria associated with a cadaver and how the community alters over the course of decomposition may, in the future, enable the development of a forensic post mortem interval estimation tool based on these changes in the bacterial community over time. The findings in this thesis suggest that high variability between human bodies and their microflora is likely to present a challenge to the development of such a tool, but further study with emerging high-throughput molecular tools may enable identification of microbial biomarkers for this purpose...|$|R

30|$|The {{concept of}} {{accumulated}} degree hours (ADH) {{has been used}} to optimize the timing of insecticide applications to control agricultural pest which is based on the temperature-dependent rate of development of cold-blooded insects. In forensic entomology, this concept {{has been used to}} estimate the time of death by utilizing blowfly larva developmental records. In a laboratory, a total number of hours multiplied by temperature is used to determine the total ADH of a blowfly development. However, as ADH has been widely used, a problem arises due to the unknown thermal history of larva development. Researchers indicated that the ADH could be miscalculated when it is not referred to heat produced by the larvae within a maggot aggregation (Peters 2003; Slone and Gruner 2007). A previous finding showed that the actual temperature at which maggot develops is unknown, as maggots are continually moving down to the feeding site then back out to the exterior of the aggregation (Anderson and VanLaerhoven 1996). Moreover, the maggot aggregation temperature can remain high regardless of daily weather fluctuation. It was reported that maggot mass temperature could reach 16.7 [*]°C above ambient temperature in a pig exposed to the sun in summer and slightly lower, 11.4 [*]°C above ambient, in a pig in shade (Shean et al. 1993). A study also noted that heat can be higher, reaching 32 [*]°C above ambient temperature (Turner and Howard 1992). Due to this thermal generation, a question has been raised whether postmortem interval (PMI) calculation based on surrounding temperature (usually obtained from the nearest weather station) is accurate and reliable. Therefore, {{a number of studies have}} emphasized on fly larval aggregation (Byrd and Butler 1998; Campobasso et al. 2001; Goff 2000; Greenberg 1991; Greenberg and Kunich 2002; Hewadikaram and Goff 1991; Joy et al. 2002). However, there are very few studies have accessed the larval aggregation formation in <b>carcass</b> <b>exposed</b> in a surrounding natural condition (Slone and Gruner 2007). Therefore, this research was carried out to extend knowledge on the distribution and thermal generation of blowfly aggregation in a surrounding natural environment using three common forensic entomology animal models which were laboratory rats, domestic rabbits, and long-tailed macaque. These models are standard and have been a surrogate to human cadaver in forensic entomology study in Malaysia (Azwandi and Abu Hassan 2009; Zuha et al. 2016; Rumiza et al. 2008).|$|R
