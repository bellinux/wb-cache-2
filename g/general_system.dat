5|$|For a <b>general</b> <b>system,</b> {{states are}} {{typically}} not pure, but instead are represented as statistical mixtures of pure states, or mixed states, given by density matrices: self-adjoint operators of trace {{one on a}} Hilbert space. Moreover, for general quantum mechanical systems, {{the effects of a}} single measurement can influence other parts of a system {{in a manner that is}} described instead by a positive operator valued measure. Thus the structure both of the states and observables in the general theory is considerably more complicated than the idealization for pure states.|$|E

25|$|The whole {{continent}} of North America {{appears to be}} destined by Divine Providence to be peopled by one nation, speaking one language, professing one <b>general</b> <b>system</b> of religious and political principles, and accustomed to one general tenor of social usages and customs. For the common happiness of them all, for their peace and prosperity, I believe it is indispensable {{that they should be}} associated in one federal Union.|$|E
25|$|The step {{response}} {{of a system}} in a given initial state consists of the time evolution of its outputs when its control inputs are Heaviside step functions. In electronic engineering and control theory, {{step response}} is the time behaviour of the outputs of a <b>general</b> <b>system</b> when its inputs change from zero to one {{in a very short}} time. The concept can be extended to the abstract mathematical notion of a dynamical system using an evolution parameter.|$|E
25|$|In other {{languages}} – including most Indo-European and Afro-Asiatic languages – third-person personal pronouns (at least those {{used to refer}} to people) intrinsically distinguish male from female. This feature commonly co-exists with a full system of grammatical gender, where all nouns are assigned to classes such as masculine, feminine and neuter. However in some languages, such as English, this <b>general</b> <b>system</b> of noun gender has been lost, but gender distinctions are preserved in the third-person pronouns (the singular pronouns only, in the case of English).|$|E
40|$|To {{develop a}} <b>general</b> <b>systems</b> theory, many {{scientists}} have tried {{their best to}} reveal the principles and laws of <b>general</b> <b>systems</b> {{in the context of}} <b>general</b> <b>systems</b> research, and much further efforts still need to be made. This paper aims to achieve the principles and laws of <b>general</b> <b>systems,</b> using a mathematical analysis of the structural model of <b>general</b> <b>systems,</b> which can not only help scientists achieve a better understanding and control of complex systems in nature and society but also be applied to solve particular scientific problems, and then apply them to study a special kind of systems, i. e. storage cells. The structural model of a storage cell is achieved, and the approaches to improve the storage speed of a storage cell are proposed. Department of Logistics and Maritime Studie...|$|R

25|$|An {{attempt to}} devise a more <b>general</b> <b>system</b> of romanization is {{complicated}} by the long and varied history of the Hebrew language. Most Hebrew texts can be appropriately pronounced according to several different systems of pronunciation, both traditional and modern. Even today, it is customary to write Hebrew using only consonants and matres lectionis. There was no way to indicate vowels clearly in Hebrew writing until the time of the Second Temple. Since an earlier time, multiple geographically separated communities have used Hebrew as a language of literature rather than conversation.|$|E
25|$|Systems {{theory is}} the transdisciplinary study of systems in general, {{with the goal}} of elucidating {{principles}} that can be applied to all types of systems in all fields of research. The term does not yet have a well-established, precise meaning, but systems theory can reasonably be considered a specialization of systems thinking and a generalization of systems science. The term originates from Bertalanffy's <b>General</b> <b>System</b> Theory (GST) and is used in later efforts in other fields, such as the action theory of Talcott Parsons and the system-theory of Niklas Luhmann.|$|E

He often invited people from other professions to give talks and one of these was the atomic physicist, Mitsuo Taketani. Taketani was a scholar who was also interested in Marxist theory and he brought this along with his scientific theories to the group. Taketani's three stage methodology for scientific research influenced Kikutake's own three stage theory: ka (the <b>general</b> <b>system),</b> kata (the abstract image) and katachi (the solution as built), which he used to summarise his own design process from a broad vision to a concrete architectural form.|$|E
