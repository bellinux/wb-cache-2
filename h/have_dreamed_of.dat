Now, at last, I {{can tell you that}} we are going on the voyage which all submariners <b>have</b> <b>dreamed</b> <b>of</b> ever since they possessed the means of doing so. We have the ship and we have the crew. We’re going around the world, nonstop. And we’re going to do it entirely submerged.|$|E
25|$|The {{building}} of a canal was an old idea. Numerous and sometimes utopian projects were devised to build a canal between the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea. Leaders such as Augustus, Nero, Charlemagne, François I, Charles IX and Henry IV <b>have</b> <b>dreamed</b> <b>of</b> it {{as it is a}} true political and economic issue. King François I brought Leonardo da Vinci to France in 1516 and commissioned a survey of a route from the Garonne at Toulouse to the Aude at Carcassonne.|$|E
25|$|Thus Gregory VII, as a {{politician}} wanting to achieve some result, was driven in practice to adopt a different standpoint. He acknowledged {{the existence of the}} state as a dispensation of Providence, described the coexistence of church and state as a divine ordinance, and emphasized the necessity of union between the sacerdotium and the imperium. But at no period would he <b>have</b> <b>dreamed</b> <b>of</b> putting the two powers on an equal footing; the superiority of church to state was to him a fact which admitted of no discussion and which he had never doubted.|$|E

Then I remembered that I <b>had</b> <b>dreamed</b> <b>of</b> the stick-pins at another time, and <b>had</b> <b>dreamed</b> <b>of</b> going to the boathouse to put them in my locker there. That made me curious, and I went down to the locker, and there I found--what do you think? One of the stick-pins stuck in the wood." ...|$|R

500|$|Petar ruled {{at peace}} with the Bulgars, though he was {{probably}} not happy with his subordinate position, and may <b>have</b> <b>dreamed</b> <b>of</b> reasserting his independence. His situation and the succession wars of the three branches of Vlastimir's sons was to play a key part in the coming Bulgarian–Byzantine War.

500|$|Midway {{through the}} first part with its {{rattling}} drums and 'cacophonous' effects a genuine panic broke out. Around {{a quarter of the}} audience rushed for the exits with confusion and anger written over their faces, and those who remained tried to hiss down the 'spectacle', while the conductor Georg Schnéevoigt drove the orchestra to extremes of volume. This whole intermezzo underlined the humoristic-burlesque element in the symphony {{in such a way that}} Carl Nielsen could certainly never <b>have</b> <b>dreamed</b> <b>of.</b> His representation of modern life with its confusion, brutality and struggle, all the uncontrolled shouts of pain and ignorance—and behind it all the side drum's harsh rhythm as the only disciplining force—as the public fled, made a touch of almost diabolic humour.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{differences}} over {{the quality of}} the film, critics were in agreement that the film had drawn attention to von Stauffenberg's cause. It was applauded [...] "both as a history lesson and as a film". Tobias Kniebe of the Süddeutsche Zeitung described the film as [...] "maybe not the masterpiece we might <b>have</b> <b>dreamed</b> <b>of</b> ... but not much less", a sentiment shared by many German critics. The public-service German television channel ZDF called Valkyrie [...] "neither scandalously bad nor the event of the century.... Neither is it the action thriller we feared, but it is a well-made and serious film." [...] The newspaper Kölner Stadt-Anzeiger reported that any fear that the [...] "myth of the German resistance would be put through a Hollywood filter {{has turned out to be}} wrong and prejudicial".|$|E

500|$|In {{addition}} to his cartooning, Davenport is remembered for playing {{a key role in}} bringing some of the earliest desertbred or asil Arabian horses to America. [...] A longtime admirer of horses, Davenport stated in 1905, [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>dreamed</b> <b>of</b> Arabian horses all my life." [...] He had been captivated by the beauty of the Arabians brought to the Chicago Columbian Exposition in 1893. Upon learning that these horses had remained in America and had been sold at auction, he sought them out, finding most of the surviving animals in 1898 in the hands of millionaire fertilizer magnate Peter Bradley of Hingham, Massachusetts. [...] Davenport bought some Arabian horses outright between 1898 and 1905, paying $8,500 for one stallion, but he later partnered with Bradley in the horse business. Among his purchases, he managed to gather {{all but one of the}} surviving horses that had been a part of the Chicago Exhibition.|$|E
500|$|During {{the sixth}} season the {{development}} of the character was praised, Glenn Diaz of BuddyTV commented that [...] "You gotta love Mer when she's gloomy.", in addition to praising Pompeo's performance. In her review of the episode Tainted Obligation she wrote [...] "I felt for Meredith, but after Lexie's heartfelt begging and pleading, I was happy that Mere finally grows up and casts her selfishness aside. Three seasons ago Meredith would never <b>have</b> <b>dreamed</b> <b>of</b> putting Lexie first, and I was proud of her for giving up part of her liver—her offer to get to know her dad was an even bigger milestone." [...] Reviewing {{the first part of the}} eighth season, TV Fanatic lauded the character and wrote: [...] "this season belongs to Meredith Grey. She is the heart and soul of the show and has been outstanding. This is a character that used to be so dark and twisty and has now grown into a more mature woman. Ellen Pompeo has been at the top of her game this season." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} {{generally}} well received among television critics. Glenn Diaz of BuddyTV commented that Perry's character was [...] "the {{man of the}} hour", in addition to praising Pompeo's performance, writing: [...] "You gotta love Mer when she's gloomy." [...] Diaz also called Yang not having a surgery [...] "hilarious", and praised the chemistry between Ramirez's and Capshaw's characters. PopSugar called {{the title of the}} episode appropriate, and also praised Pompeo's performance, adding: [...] "I felt for Meredith, but after Lexie's heartfelt begging and pleading, I was happy that Mere finally grows up and casts her selfishness aside.

Cinema Blend Amanda Krill found Yang [...] "babyish" [...] and [...] "whiny".|$|E

[...] However, according to Clifton Fadiman, [...] "Kittredge always maintained that the question was never asked, and if it had been he would never <b>have</b> <b>dreamed</b> <b>of</b> answering in such a manner."

During the struggle, a white man was killed, and the eleven black men in the house were later arrested and charged with murder. Dr. Ossian Sweet and three members of his family were brought to trial, and after an initial deadlock, Darrow argued to the all-white jury: [...] "I insist that there is nothing but prejudice in this case; that if it was reversed and eleven white men had shot and killed a black man while protecting their home and their lives against a mob of blacks, nobody would <b>have</b> <b>dreamed</b> <b>of</b> having them indicted.

2500|$|In the Spring of 1788 he set {{off with}} John Playfair to the Berwickshire coast and found more {{examples}} of this sequence in the valleys of the Tour and Pease Burns near Cockburnspath. They then took a boat trip from Dunglass Burn east along the coast with the geologist Sir James Hall of Dunglass. They found the sequence in the cliff below St. Helens, then just to the east at Siccar Point found what Hutton called [...] "a beautiful picture of this junction washed bare by the sea". Playfair later commented about the experience, [...] "the mind seemed to grow giddy by looking so far into the abyss of time". Continuing along the coast, they made more discoveries including sections of the vertical beds showing strong ripple marks which gave Hutton [...] "great satisfaction" [...] as a confirmation of his supposition that these beds had been laid horizontally in water. He also found conglomerate at altitudes that demonstrated the extent of erosion of the strata, and said of this that [...] "we never should <b>have</b> <b>dreamed</b> <b>of</b> meeting with what we now perceived".|$|E
2500|$|The film {{revisited}} Almodóvar's familiar {{themes of}} the power of sisterhood and of family. Almodóvar shot parts of the film in Barcelona and used lush colors to emphasise the richness of the city. Dedicated to Bette Davis, Romy Schneider and Gena Rowlands, All About My Mother is steeped in theatricality, from its backstage setting to its plot, modeled on the works of Federico García Lorca and Tennessee Williams, to the characters' preoccupation with modes of performance. Almodóvar inserts a number of references to American cinema. One of the film's key scenes, where Manuela watches her son die, was inspired by John Cassavetes' 1977 film Opening Night. The film's title is also a nod to All About Eve, which Manuela and her son are shown watching in the film. The comic relief of the film centers on Agrado, a pre-operative transsexual. In one scene, she tells the story of her body and its relationship to plastic surgery and silicone, culminating with a statement of her own philosophy: [...] "you get to be more authentic the more you become like what you <b>have</b> <b>dreamed</b> <b>of</b> yourself".|$|E
