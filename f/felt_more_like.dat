25|$|Torquay is {{situated}} on the southwestern coast of England, forming one third of Torbay, {{on the western side}} of the bay. It has a mild microclimate, receiving among the longest hours of sunlight per day in the south west of the United Kingdom, with winters that tend to be mild and wet. The record low temperature of −8.9C was recorded in 1940 and again in 1947. A record high temperature of 31.5C was recorded on 14 July 2013 at 5:30 pm, humidity meant that the temperature actually <b>felt</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> 40C.|$|E
500|$|Charlie Hall from Polygon {{scored the}} game 7.5 out of 10.0, noting that Banished <b>felt</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> a [...] "survival simulation" [...] than a city-building simulation. Hall also praised the games {{graphics}} and animations, but {{noted that the}} game struggled with giving players solid feedback {{on the results of}} their actions. Dean Paul from Eurogamer gave the game a score of 6/10, noting that the game was a [...] "survival sandbox. It's harsh", agreeing with Hall that it was difficult to get information. Paul noted that having to build structures in a strict grid-like pattern felt generic and formulaic.|$|E

50|$|In 1984, writer Donald Wandrei {{caused some}} {{controversy}} {{after he was}} offered a World Fantasy Award for Life Achievement but refused to accept it because the award was a bust of H. P.

500|$|The game begot a Super Mario Land {{series of}} {{portable}} Mario games. [...] added a non-linear overworld and introduced Wario, an evil version of Mario, as the game's villain. The subsequent [...] began the Wario franchise. After 19 years, the 2011 title Super Mario 3D Land for the Nintendo 3DS became Mario's first game in stereoscopic 3D. Audrey Drake of IGN argued that both Wario Land and Super Mario 3D Land were not [...] "legitimate sequels", and {{wrote that the}} latter <b>felt</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> [...] "Super Mario Bros. 3 with Mario Galaxy influences" [...] than a successor to Super Mario Land 2.|$|E
500|$|Decades {{received}} better reviews than On Tour, with reviewers {{noting that}} the game, released {{only a short time}} after the original On Tour, <b>felt</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> an expansion pack than a new title. [...] Critics noted that there was no change in the hardware design and the gameplay mechanics, such that the same issues with hand-cramping and the inability to keep the DS steady while playing still persisted in Decades. [...] Reviewers did praise the compatibility with the previous On Tour title, the improved touch screen interface, and the ability to play competitively with other users regardless of which version of the game they possessed.|$|E
500|$|Will Ferrell's {{character}} received {{criticism in}} the episode. White criticized Deangelo Vickers, noting {{that she did not}} have a handle on the character and that he was too [...] "downright normal" [...] and [...] "practically boring". McNutt argued that, while Ferrell [...] "is not really the problem with the role" [...] of Deangelo Vickers, the actions between Ferrell and Carell <b>felt</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> [...] "hanging out to commemorate the former’s departure from a television show" [...] rather than the two playing believable characters. He also felt that Deangelo [...] "feels disruptive to the show’s narrative" [...] because his character {{gets in the way of}} the plot. Sepinwall felt that parts of the episode fell flat because it spent [...] "so much time giving Will Ferrell stuff to do". He further noted that [...] "nobody has come up with a good reason for him being here other than that he's Will Ferrell." ...|$|E

500|$|Adventures of Mana {{has been}} {{positively}} received by critics. Shaun Musgrave at TouchArcade {{felt that the}} sparse story set-up and lack of [...] "supervision or training", while likely to [...] "rub some people the wrong way", was refreshing; he liked the simplicity and [...] "efficiency" [...] of the game, and said that, as a remake, he was unsure if he could be any happier with it than he was. TouchArcade named Adventures of Mana as their [...] "Game of the Week", calling it a [...] "truly wonderful remake". Nadia Oxford at USgamer said that the game was [...] "a very decent re-construction of Final Fantasy Adventure" [...] and less tedious than Sword of Mana. Jason Schreier of Kotaku thought that the game was excellent; like Oxford, he preferred it over Sword of Mana, which he said <b>felt</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> a new game than like a remake. Harry Slater at Pocket Gamer, Musgrave, and Schreier all commented on the price, considering it to be high.|$|E
500|$|Gibson {{traveled}} to Tokyo in 2001 {{to prepare for}} this new novel, which takes place in London, Moscow, and Tokyo. He did not travel to London or Moscow but used interviews with friends and internet resources for research. In September 2001 Gibson had written about 100pages but was struggling to finish. He stopped writing after watching the September 11, 2001 attacks on television and [...] "realized [...] had become a story {{that took place in}} an alternate time track, in which Sept. 11 hadn't happened". He considered abandoning the novel but a few weeks later re-wrote portions to use the attacks as a motivating factor for the distress the main character feels. In a 2003 interview he said, [...] "There I was, in the winter of 2001, with no idea what the summer of 2002 was going to be like. ... In the original post-9/11 draft, London <b>felt</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> London is feeling right now. Cayce keeps seeing trucks full of soldiers. But I took that out, because as it got closer to the time, it wasn't actually happening." ...|$|E
500|$|Though {{isometric}} games {{had existed}} previously, in a retrospective review, Gillen (Rock, Paper, Shotgun) recalled that Knight Lore {{was the first}} game to offer a [...] "world" [...] with physical depth for exploration {{as opposed to the}} simple mechanics of arcade games. Jeremy Signor of USgamer agreed that Knight Lore <b>felt</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> a world than a painting and added that the game's innovative use of successive, single-screen rooms ("flip-screen") pre-dated The Legend of Zelda by years. Gillen said the game's punishing style (unforgiving gameplay, high difficulty, awkward controls) had become obsolete in the 30 years since its release and criticised Knight Lore as [...] "enormously innovative, incredibly atmospheric, and totally unplayable", suggesting that the similar Head over Heels (1987) had aged much better. Peter Parrish (Eurogamer), too, found the game frustrating, though well-made. Dan Whitehead of the same publication appreciated that the 2015 Rare Replay compilation version of Knight Lore emulated the original's choppy animations as the ZX Spectrum's processor once struggled to render the onscreen objects.|$|E
60|$|It was not deemed {{necessary}} that Dave {{and his friends}} return to {{the vicinity of the}} fort the next day, and they and a party of rangers numbering eighteen encamped along the bank of the Niagara.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study bases upon {{investigating}} if students' behavior changes with help of an ART component called token economy where rewards, feedback and rules are present. Focus lies on being able to see the eventual development and change in the individual student and group which are displayed in the classroom after the application of these components. The method, which is the foundation for the study, starts as an observational 10 week study, which has even been connected to interviews with a colleague and the nine pupils who were part of the study. The result unanimously shows that token economy contributes towards positive changes in the classroom for both teacher and student. The result also shows a development and change in the individual student and group in the classroom. Everyone was in agreement that clear rules were positive and the observation showed that changes occurred on all points. The interviews show a clear unanimity of the positive effects, where the overwhelming majority experienced that they <b>felt</b> <b>more</b> <b>liked,</b> had no urge to cause trouble and that feedback was important to be able to achieve the desired behavior the study rested on...|$|R
500|$|It {{is rated}} PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association of America for [...] "intense {{sequences}} of sci-fi violence, action, and language," [...] unlike {{the first three}} films which are rated R. The decision to release the film with a PG-13 rating has met with much criticism from fans, {{as well as the}} media. The rating decision was made after McG cut out a shot of Marcus stabbing a thug with a screwdriver, as the director felt disallowing the young audience due to that one shot was unfair. He also deleted a topless scene for Moon Bloodgood because [...] "It was a soft moment {{between a man and a}} woman that was designed to echo the Kelly McGillis/Harrison Ford moment in Witness [...] in the end, it <b>felt</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> a gratuitous moment of a girl taking her top off in an action picture, and I didn't want that to convolute the story or the characters." [...] The producers had expected the rating because of the modern leniency towards violence in PG-13 films, such as the 2007 action film, Live Free or Die Hard.|$|E
500|$|Martin Campbell {{spent three}} days of {{preparation}} on the [...] "Box" [...] set, analyzing it from every angle to learn {{the feel of the}} room. Fontana comes from a playwriting background, and [...] "Three Men and Adena" [...] involves long lengths of dialogue in a single setting, much like a play. The actors shot about 14 pages of dialogue each day, and had a very small amount of rehearsal time before shooting. According to Fontana, Campbell never shot a scene from the same angle twice, [...] "So the entire hour keeps changing {{the point of view of}} the camera, so that you never get tired of being in that room." [...] While filming the episode, Campbell would shoot single scenes with multiple pages of long dialogue, then film the scene again from another angle. Braugher said the experience <b>felt</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> staging a play than shooting a television episode, and allowed for a feeling of spontaneous human emotion in the performances. Although the dialogue in the final episode did not stray from the original script, Fontana said Campbell and the actors came up with the rhythm and pacing of the performances largely on their own, particularly during the fast-paced questions when Pembleton and Bayliss team up on Tucker.|$|E
500|$|Shooting Schindler's List {{was deeply}} {{emotional}} for Spielberg, {{the subject matter}} forcing him to confront elements of his childhood, such as the antisemitism he faced. He was surprised {{that he did not}} cry while visiting Auschwitz; instead he found himself filled with outrage. He was one of many crew members who could not force themselves to watch during shooting of the scene where aging Jews are forced to run naked while being selected by Nazi doctors to go to Auschwitz. Spielberg commented that he <b>felt</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> a reporter than a film maker – he would set up scenes and then watch events unfold, almost as though he were witnessing them rather than creating a movie. Several actresses broke down when filming the shower scene, including one who was born in a concentration camp. Spielberg, his wife Kate Capshaw, and their five children rented a house in suburban Kraków for the duration of filming. He later thanked his wife [...] "for rescuing me ninety-two days in a row... when things just got too unbearable". Robin Williams called Spielberg to cheer him up, given the profound lack of humor on the set. Spielberg spent several hours each evening editing Jurassic Park, which was scheduled to premiere in June 1993.|$|E
60|$|Captain Willoughby {{received}} {{the news of}} this addition to his ill luck {{with an air of}} military stoicism, though he <b>felt,</b> in reality, <b>more</b> <b>like</b> a father and a husband on the occasion than like a hero. Accustomed to self-command, he succeeded in concealing the extent of his uneasiness, while he immediately set about inquiring into the extent of the evil.|$|R
6000|$|The visitor's grimace {{grew more}} marked as he {{continued}} to look, and the conscious little schoolroom <b>felt</b> still <b>more</b> <b>like</b> a cage at a menagerie. [...] "Charming, charming, charming!" [...] Mr. Perriam insisted; but the parenthesis closed with a prompt click. [...] "There you are!" [...] said her ladyship. [...] "By-bye!" [...] she sharply added. The next minute they were on the stairs, and Mrs. Wix and her companion, at the open door and looking mutely at each other, were reached by the sound of the large social current that carried them back to their life.|$|R
60|$|On {{the morning}} of the third day, and while they could {{distinctly}} hear the sounds of heavy firing in the vicinity of Morro Castle and the Estrella battery, Walter and Gilberto started off, each on horseback. The youth <b>felt</b> once <b>more</b> <b>like</b> himself, for the Cubans had continued to give him drinks of herbs which had entirely banished the lurking fever in his system. Before leaving Walter heard from the negress Josefina. She had escaped injury, and fled to the northward, there to join a great number of women and children, the wives and young people of the insurgents.|$|R
500|$|The episode {{received}} mostly {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Entertainment Weekly gave the episode a C, writing, [...] "Aside from a well-executed invisible-elephant rampage, this one's {{pretty much on}} automatic pilot". Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club also graded it as a C, calling it [...] "forgettable, and under-baked; [...] not terrible {{enough to be a}} complete failure, but forgettable enough". John Keegan from Critical Myth gave the episode a moderately negative review and awarded it a 4 out of 10. He wrote, [...] "Overall, this episode <b>felt</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> a statement by the writer regarding animal rights than an episode of [...] The plot doesn’t seem to know which direction it wants to explore, and ultimately, elements of the episode contradict each other." [...] Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode two stars out of five. The two wrote that, despite the episode having [...] "rare anger" [...] and a [...] "genuine passion behind" [...] its conservation message, the entry was not [...] "a very good story". Shearman and Pearson called the plot [...] "so confusing that all that impact [...] soon dissipates." [...] The plot for [...] "Fearful Symmetry" [...] was also adapted as a novel for young adults in 1996 by Les Martin, under the title Tiger, Tiger.|$|E
500|$|The guest {{performances}} made by Kathy Griffin and Loretta Devine {{were met}} with mixed reception from several critics. Amy Reiter was more critical on Griffin's performance as Tammy Jean Albertson, and noted [...] "while Kathy Griffin was sight-gag funny as local tea party candidate Tammy Jean Albertson [...] her lines fell a bit flat." [...] She went on to praise Devine's performance as Sister Mary Constance, saying that her lines [...] "totally hit the bull's-eye." [...] Robert Canning praised both performances, {{saying that it was}} {{the best part of the}} episode. He continued, [...] "I love how the guest judge segments of these contest episodes are beginning to become mini-series unto themselves. I hope that tradition continues." [...] James Poniewozik had mixed feelings regarding Griffin's performance. He went on to write, [...] "Glee can be sharp and topical enough that I thought it could actually do something clever with the much-publicized cameo. Instead, the performance hinged on expected gags [...] and Griffin delivered it all with a stiffness that <b>felt</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> a recitation than a performance." [...] Todd VanDerWerff reacted negatively to both performances. In his review of the episode, he opined, [...] "That judges’ scene [...] was a pale retread of the original, only this time, it had Kathy Griffin and Loretta Devine, as well as a bunch of tired Tea Party gags that were tired when this episode was written." ...|$|E
500|$|The sixth season {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from the media. Laura Betker of the Winnipeg Sun said, [...] "Wrapping up plot lines so quickly creates {{a bit of}} disappointment for audiences. Typically, season finales end with exciting cliffhangers to entice fan interest. Degrassi’s finale really had no loose ends. There is no pending excitement for fans and the two-part finale became a disappointment. The episodes <b>felt</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> a series finale rather than just a season ending." [...] In his end of year review, Joel Rubnoff of the Waterloo Region Record said Degrassi: The Next Generation {{was one of the}} best shows of 2007, adding, [...] "The greatest teen show on the planet rediscovers its mojo with a same sex romance between control freak Paige and teen rebel Alexa. The year's most compelling—and bittersweet—love story." [...] AfterEllen.com, a website which focuses on the portrayal of lesbian and bisexual women in the media, and owned by MTV Networks' Logo cable television network reported on the portrayal of two Degrassi: The Next Generation lesbian characters. [...] "Paige and Alex's relationship, developed over three seasons, has become one of the best portrayals of a lesbian teen relationship we've seen on American television," [...] said Sarah Warn, the website's Editor in Chief, before giving the series an [...] "A" [...] Grade for the portrayal of class issues, character development, sexual orientation, dialogue, the relationship and lesbian sex.|$|E
60|$|She walked {{ahead in}} silence. Heyst remarked {{that they had}} never been out before during the hottest hours. It would do her no good, he feared. This solicitude pleased and soothed her. She <b>felt</b> <b>more</b> and <b>more</b> <b>like</b> herself--a poor London girl playing in an orchestra, and {{snatched}} out from the humiliations, the squalid dangers of a miserable existence, by a man like whom there was not, there could not be, another in this world. She felt this with elation, with uneasiness, with an intimate pride--and with a peculiar sinking of the heart.|$|R
5000|$|After {{just one}} season, Hyun retired from {{professional}} ice hockey {{to move to}} South Korea, where he worked with the National Assembly and the Ministry of Health and Welfare to promote Korean-German friendship. Though Hyun sometimes faced racism and exclusion in Germany, he stated that he <b>felt</b> even <b>more</b> <b>like</b> a stranger in South Korea; he returned to Germany to enroll in a doctoral programme at the University of Bonn, where he is writing his thesis on {{the experiences of the}} second-generation Korean youth in Germany. He also gained more experience in the political world with the German and European Parliament and the Ministry of Generations, Family, Women and Integration.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the middle}} of the 1970s the {{pressure}} on the Scherben from their anarchistic fanbase grew. The Band <b>felt</b> <b>more</b> and <b>more</b> <b>like</b> a [...] "music-box", playing for the radical scene on cue. While the band attempted a shift toward more personal lyrics, the radical scene insisted that they remain as political as before. Under this pressure the band escaped from Berlin to Fresenhagen, a little town in Nordfriesland, where they bought an old farm, which the numerous bandmembers, about 16 in all, repaired. There they tried to make their dream of [...] "working & living together" [...] come true.|$|R
500|$|Ostrow {{commented that}} the Monica and Rachel storyline [...] "was {{evidence}} of unfunny, lazy writing." [...] Kim, however, thought the storyline offered some [...] "funny moments." [...] Ostrow was complimentary of cast members Lisa Kudrow and David Schwimmer's performances. [...] "Lisa Kudrow, as Phoebe, singer of truthful folk songs, {{continues to be a}} Friends highlight and David Schwimmer can carry off amusing, emotionally tinged moments even opposite a monkey." [...] DVD Talk's Earl Cressey named the episode [...] {{one of the highlights of}} the second season of Friends. Hal Boedeker of The Orlando Sentinel praised [...] "The One After the Superbowl" [...] for being better than most episodes of Friends and [...] "pleasantly off-the-wall and in keeping with the Friends spirit." [...] The authors of Friends Like Us: The Unofficial Guide to Friends wrote that there are [...] "some lovely moments of slapstick" [...] in the episode. They called Roberts [...] "a fine guest-star", while Van Damme was [...] "embarrassing". Pergament said [...] "The One After the Superbowl" [...] "had its moments", but he thought it <b>felt</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> an episode of Seinfeld than an episode of Friends. The Houston Chronicles Ann Hodges gave the episode a more negative review, commenting that the Friends writers [...] "dropped the ball" [...] with it: [...] "Women's underwear, three-way-sex jokes, and a monkey — that was it. The insipid, stupid script was an insult to guest stars like Julia Roberts [...] and Jean-Claude Van Damme." ...|$|E
500|$|Peter Hartlaub, of the San Francisco Chronicle, felt Zombie was {{successful}} in both [...] " [...] his own spin on Halloween, {{while at the same}} time paying tribute to Carpenter's film"; he thought Zombie managed to make Michael Myers almost [...] "sympathetic" [...] as a child, but that the last third of the film <b>felt</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> a montage of scenes with Halloween slipping into [...] "slasher-film logic". Nathan Lee of The Village Voice disagreed in part with Harlaub, feeling that Halloween may have placed too much emphasis on providing sympathy for Michael Myers, but that it succeeded in [...] " [...] Carpenter's vision without rooting out its fear". The film critic Matthew Turner believed the first half of the film, which featured the prequel elements of Michael as a child, were better played than the remake elements of the second half. In short, Turner stated that performances from the cast were [...] "superb", with Malcolm McDowell being perfectly cast as Dr. Loomis, but that the film lacked the scare value of Carpenter’s original. Jamie Russell from the BBC agreed that the first half of the film worked better than the last half; she stated that Zombie’s expanded backstory on Michael was [...] "surprisingly effective"—also agreeing that McDowell was perfectly cast as Loomis—but that Zombie failed to deliver the [...] "supernatural dread" [...] that Carpenter created for Michael in his 1978 original.|$|E
500|$|The third series {{includes}} nine main cast members. Matthew Macfadyen {{returns as}} Tom Quinn {{in the first}} two episodes. Macfadyen intended to leave the series as he felt [...] "your senses get dull doing a long-running TV show." [...] As the producers were storylining the third series, they were [...] "99 per cent sure" [...] Macfadyen would not return until they heard he wanted to come back for two episodes because {{he did not want to}} leave the series so soon. Keeley Hawes also returns in the series as Zoe Reynolds. Hawes wanted to leave the series also after the first six episodes. David Oyelowo makes a return as Danny Hunter. After Tom's exit, it allowed Danny's character to develop further. Oyelowo also announced his intention to leave the series, after the finale episode. Peter Firth returns as superior Harry Pearce. After two seasons, Firth attempted to lighten Harry up [...] "a little bit" [...] after his mother suggested the character [...] "smile more," [...] despite the fact that Harry is a serious man. Nicola Walker returns as Ruth Evershed. First appearing in the second series, Walker <b>felt</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> the [...] "new girl," [...] but felt more experienced upon her return to the third. Shauna Macdonald also returns as Sam Buxton. The five-month filming gap between series two and three left Macdonald [...] "a bit de-Spookified" [...] as she was more focused on her film career. Hugh Simon and Rory MacGregor return as Malcolm Wynn-Jones and Colin Wells, respectively.|$|E
5000|$|Matt Richenthal from TV Fanatic {{said of the}} episode: [...] "Not every episode can {{feature a}} major battle between the {{survivors}} and the aliens, for both production reasons and storyline reasons. The show wouldn't last half a season {{if that were the}} case.But Falling Skies has done a strong enough job building up characters that [...] "Grace" [...] <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>more</b> than filler.|$|R
6000|$|Waymarsh {{fixed on}} his washing-stand the silent {{detached}} stare with which Milrose in person, as it were, might have marked the unexpectedness of a compliment from Woollett, and Strether for his part, <b>felt</b> once <b>more</b> <b>like</b> Woollett in person. [...] "I mean," [...] his friend presently continued, [...] "that your appearance isn't {{as bad as}} I've seen it: it compares favourably with what it was when I last noticed it." [...] On this appearance Waymarsh's eyes yet failed to rest; {{it was almost as}} if they obeyed an instinct of propriety, and the effect was still stronger when, always considering the basin and jug, he added: [...] "You've filled out some since then." ...|$|R
5000|$|Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club said [...] "'Accounting for Lawyers' nicely reaffirms {{everything}} {{that makes the}} show's character stuff work." [...] Kelsea Stahler of Hollywood.com praised the episode's comedic gags, saying the show [...] "got her undivided attention." [...] Matt Riechenthal of TV Fanatic also praised the episode's [...] "hilarious" [...] gags, {{and gave it a}} 3.9/5 rating. Alan Sepinwall of HitFix praised the episode for exploring the theme of friendship between the characters, noting that it was less funny but warmer and sweeter: [...] "I think I probably laughed a little more at the season premiere, but [...] "Accounting for Lawyers" [...] <b>felt</b> even <b>more</b> <b>like</b> the show 'Community' is at its best." ...|$|R
