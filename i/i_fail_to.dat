5|$|I am {{at first}} {{inclined}} to agree... But on re-reading the whole Ode, this line {{strikes me as}} a serious blemish on a beautiful poem, and the reason must be either that <b>I</b> <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> understand it, or that it is a statement which is untrue. And I suppose that Keats meant something by it, however remote his truth and his beauty may have been from these words in ordinary use. And I am sure that he would have repudiated any explanation of the line which called it a pseudo-statement... The statement of Keats seems to me meaningless: or perhaps {{the fact that it is}} grammatically meaningless conceals another meaning from me.|$|E

Chengal Reddy, secretary general of CIFA claimed retail reform could do lots for Indian farmers. Reddy commented, [...] "India has 600 million farmers, 1,200 million consumers and 5 million traders. <b>I</b> <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> understand why political parties are taking an anti-farmer stand and worried about half a million brokers and small shopkeepers". CIFA mainly operates in Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu; but has a growing members from rest of India, including Shetkari Sanghatana in Maharashtra, Rajasthan Kisan Union and Himachal Farmer Organisations.|$|E

2500|$|Beatty {{spent much}} of his life (when not at sea) in Leicestershire, and lived at Brooksby Hall and Dingley Hall. Beatty's old {{commander}} Admiral John Jellicoe died on 19 November 1935. Already suffering from heart failure, and sick with influenza, Beatty defied doctors' orders and left his bed to act as a pallbearer, saying, [...] "What will the Navy say if <b>I</b> <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> attend Jellicoe's funeral?" [...] He was so obviously ill that, as the funeral procession passed up Fleet Street, a bystander sent a glass of brandy out to him. He also insisted on attending the funeral of King George V in January 1936. These acts hastened his own death.|$|E
2500|$|The Justice {{also agreed}} that the outcome of Valley Forge Christian College v. Americans United for Separation of Church and State, Inc., 454 U. S. 464 (1982) {{was based on the}} Property Clause of Article IV, §3 and so was not a viable {{precedent}} in this case. Souter noted that the majority expressed their fear that a great many Executive branch actions would be open to lawsuit if they ruled for the Foundation, he said [...] "that does not mean taxpayers will prevail in such suits. If these claims are frivolous on the merits, <b>I</b> <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> see the harm in dismissing them for failure to state a claim instead of for lack of jurisdiction. To the degree the claims are meritorious, fear that there will be many of them does not provide a compelling reason, much less a reason grounded in Article III, to keep them from being heard." ...|$|E
