Michaels and Lampley were joined by analysts O. J. Simpson (who would normally have been the second color commentator; when interviewed as to why Theismann would join Gifford and Meredith in the booth instead of Simpson; director Chet Forte {{was quoted in the}} January 14, 1985 edition of Broadcasting Magazine as saying that Theismann could contribute more due to having played both teams in the regular-season as well as having played in the two previous Super Bowls.) and Tom Landry (in a separate booth during the game). Also helping out with ABC's coverage were Jack Whitaker, Dick Schaap, Donna de Varona, Ray Gandolf, and ABC News reporters Stone Phillips, Jeff Greenfield, <b>Judd</b> <b>Rose,</b> and Bill Redeker.|$|E

5000|$|When Royale was {{cut from}} the competition, Entertainment Weekly called the {{elimination}} [...] "shocking". When {{he was told to}} [...] "sashay away" [...] by RuPaul, Royale responded, [...] "You have changed my life forever. You have changed the world of drag forever. I love you and respect you so much, and thank you for seeing something special in me. Thank you." [...] Special judges in attendance were Wynonna <b>Judd</b> and <b>Rose</b> McGowan, the latter of whom teared up from Royale's speech.|$|R
5000|$|The Primary Structures art {{featured}} new, stripped-down {{naked and}} materials with smooth, shiny surfaces, {{but perhaps the}} most unusual new idea to come from the exhibit was the concept of artist as [...] "designer", not necessarily as [...] "maker". During a forum on the [...] "New Sculpture" [...] conducted at the museum, in which McShine, <b>Judd,</b> Barbara <b>Rose,</b> Robert Morris, and Mark di Suvero participated, di Suvero famously remarked, [...] "Primary Structures is the key show of the 1960s...", and also, [...] "...my friend Donald Judd cannot qualify as an artist because he doesn't do the work", to which Judd replied, [...] "...The point is not whether one makes the work or not... I don't see... why one technique is any more essentially art than another..." [...] This show ushered in a radical new way of presenting ideas and space that did not rely on the artist's hand, but rather on the final result.|$|R
