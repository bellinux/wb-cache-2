5|$|In {{the early}} 1900s, the main {{industries}} in the watershed of Roaring Brook included agriculture, brick making, and coal mining. Around this time, the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad followed the stream throughout much of its length and the Erie Railroad followed the stream from Elmhurst to its mouth. The former was created by an 1852 merger of the Cobbs Gap and Delaware Railroad and the Lackawanna and Western Railroad, which were previously in the stream's watershed. The main stem {{was used as a}} water supply for Scranton by the Scranton Gas and Water Company. It was also used as an <b>industrial</b> <b>water</b> supply by the Spencer Coal Company. The watershed continues to supply water to the Lackawanna Valley in the 21st century. In the early 1900s, major communities in the watershed included Scranton, Dunmore, Moscow, and Elmhurst. At the time, their populations were 129,867, 17,615, 650, and 379, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Since its {{completion}} in 1968, the Oroville Dam has allocated {{the flow of}} the Feather River from the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta into the State Water Project's California Aqueduct, which provides a major supply of water for irrigation in the San Joaquin Valley as well as municipal and <b>industrial</b> <b>water</b> supplies to coastal Southern California, and has prevented large amounts of flood damage to the area — more than $1.3 billion between the years of 1987 and 1999. The dam has confined fish migration up the Feather River and the controlled flow of the river {{as a result of the}} Oroville Dam has affected riparian habitat. Multiple attempts at trying to counter the dam's impacts on fish migration have included the construction of a salmon/steelhead fish incubator on the river, which began shortly after the dam was completed.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is an {{analysis}} of long-term changes in numbers of 28 selected waterbird species wintering at 4 different types of wetland refuge sites (reservoirs, fishponds, <b>industrial</b> <b>waters</b> and running waters) monitored within the International Waterbird Census between 1966 and 2015. We aimed to evaluate the pattern in water type preference and determine if there is a difference in number trends of particular species at different refuge sites types and if there are any variations according to the presumable existence of density dependance at wintering refuge sites. Results showed an increasing preference in waterbirds wintering at <b>industrial</b> <b>waters</b> (sandpit and gravel lakes, industrial settling ponds) over running waters. Rather herbivorous, benthivorous and omnivorous species than pescivorous species prefer <b>industrial</b> <b>waters,</b> which is probably caused by a lower concentration of fish in <b>industrial</b> <b>waters</b> than in other water types. Waterbird species of lower count numbers and northern species showed a higher preference for wintering at reservoirs over running water sites. The preference change leads to the density dependence of wintering sites confirmation...|$|R

25|$|In {{the early}} 2000s, Saudi Arabia began {{to invite the}} private sector not only to build, but also to finance and operate new {{desalination}} plants. A Water and Energy Corporation (WEC) was established as an off-taker that buys water used for municipal uses from the IWPPs through 20-year power and water purchase agreements (PWPAs). The government fully guarantees the payments due from WEC to the IWPPs. This follows the example of Persian Gulf countries, which had introduced IWPPs several years earlier. The first such project in Saudi Arabia was the Shoaiba III Independent Water and Power Producer (IWPP) signed in 2007 and completed in 2010. It {{is located on the}} Red Sea and provides water to Jiddah, Mecca and Taif. The second IWPP was the Jubail II project, located next to the Jubail industrial complex on the Persian Gulf coast.
