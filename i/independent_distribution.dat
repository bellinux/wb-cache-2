25|$|The {{last few}} decades have seen a further {{diffusion}} of jazz from New York and other major long-time capitals, to cities and regions across the United States and the world. Many New York jazz performers during this period played fusions of jazz with rock and other styles; among the earliest of these modern musicians was Carla Bley, cofounder of the Jazz Composers Orchestra Association, an <b>independent</b> <b>distribution</b> company for avant-garde and jazz artists. The city has also been home to the well-known modern performer from New Orleans, Louisiana, Wynton Marsalis and the large M-Base Collective, {{as well as people}} such as John Zorn who use jazz as a prominent part of their experimental music in many different styles.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} a flexible class of models, with {{elements that are}} finite mixtures of multivariate skew-normal <b>independent</b> <b>distributions.</b> A general EM-type algorithm is employed for iteratively computing parameter estimates and this is discussed with emphasis on finite mixtures of skew-normal, skew-t, skew-slash and skew-contaminated normal distributions. Further, a general information-based method for approximating the asymptotic covariance matrix of the estimates is also presented. The accuracy of the associated estimates and the efficiency of some information criteria are evaluated via simulation studies. Results obtained from the analysis of artificial and real data sets are reported illustrating {{the usefulness of the}} proposed methodology. The proposed EM-type algorithm and methods are implemented in the R package mixsmsn.

500|$|For {{many years}} Burger King owned and {{operated}} its own distribution system, known originally as Distron. Distron, founded shortly after establishment of Burger King, primarily served the company-owned stores and 50–60 percent of franchised stores. Franchise groups were free to purchase supplies from one of seventeen <b>independent</b> <b>distribution</b> systems, often operated by larger franchise groups such as Carrols Restaurant Group. The Distron setup remained relatively stable until BK was purchased from Pillsbury by Grand Metropolitan. Grand Met originally planned to sell it after the purchase, but ended up reorganizing the division into two separate groups for procurement (Burger King Purchasing [...] ) and distribution (Burger King Distribution Services [...] ). The move resulted in the layoff of over a hundred staff members.|$|E
500|$|Upon its {{original}} stereo LP release in May 1974, the album {{had a short}} supply and distribution due to the Strata-East label's <b>independent</b> <b>distribution</b> policy of their artists' releases. Consequently, Winter in America became considered by many fans to be the great [...] "lost" [...] Gil Scott-Heron album, before a proper reissue on compact disc thirty years following {{its original}} issue. The album served as the first of their collaborations to have Jackson receive co-billing for a release. Unlike Scott-Heron's previous albums, Winter in America experienced some commercial success {{with the help of}} promotional resources in the form of underground music deejays and club promoters, in spite of the album's limited distribution. While it did not chart on the U.S. Billboard Pop Albums chart, the album charted on the Top Jazz Albums chart and peaked at number six. Winter in America entered the Top Jazz Albums on June 29, 1974 and remained there for 40 weeks, until March 29, 1975. According to a 1990 Los Angeles Times article on Scott-Heron, the album ended up selling more than 300,000 copies.|$|E
500|$|Released in 1972, The Legend of Boggy Creek premiered at {{what was}} later called the Perot Theatre, where lines {{stretched}} around the block to see it. Pierce did not expect it to become a financial success, but it made $55,000 {{in the first three}} weeks from that single theater. Eventually, Pierce entered into a distribution deal with Joy N. Houck, owner of the <b>independent</b> <b>distribution</b> company Howco, who paid Pierce $1.29 million for a 50 percent interest in the film. Pierce and Houck signed with American International Pictures for foreign and television distribution. It became a hit at drive-in movie theaters, eventually gaining a cult status and bringing Pierce a modicum of fame. The film went on to gross about $25 million, {{making it one of the}} highest-grossing films of the year. At the time of the film's release, Pierce incorrectly predicted to newspapers that it would win several Academy Awards. Several similarly-styled films about strange and allegedly true phenomena were released in subsequent years due to success of The Legend of Boggy Creek. Julius E. [...] "Smokey" [...] Crabtree, a Fouke resident who appeared as himself in the film, became disgruntled with the production company and filed a lawsuit against Pierce and his financial supporters. Pierce declined to speak to the media about the suit.|$|E
