2500|$|The {{song was}} spoofed by Bob Rivers, as Shaggy One Handed, making a {{reference}} to the Scooby-Doo character, Shaggy Rogers. The video focused on him being caught masturbating (about the girl next door) by his mother. The song was also spoofed on Svengoolie. On The Chris Moyles Show, the song was used as a prank call with Shaggy trying to book a taxi, with the final line being [...] "Can you <b>drop</b> <b>me</b> off at The Chris Moyles Show on BBC Radio 1?, 97 to 99 FM".|$|E
2500|$|During the program's 1955 premiere, Foley asked, [...] "If {{you folks}} {{want us to}} come and visit at your house like this every Saturday night, why don't you <b>drop</b> <b>me</b> a line in Springfield, Missouri?" [...] In the next week 25,258 cards and letters arrived from 45 of the 48 states, and the show {{typically}} received 6,000 letters each week. In May 1955, carried by 72 ABC affiliates, {{it was the only}} TV show with an audience equally divided among men, women and children, according to the American Research Bureau (ARB).

5000|$|It is {{revealed}} in [...] "Money" [...] that Ringo's mother dropped him as a baby ("Me mother <b>dropped</b> <b>me</b> once").|$|R
2500|$|... "It's {{horses for}} courses, skipper." [...] I told him. [...] "It's madness {{to go with}} three pace bowlers on that pitch. One of us has to be dropped {{if we are to}} stand a chance of winning. I'm loyal to my country, <b>drop</b> <b>me</b> if you like, you can always put {{yourself}} on as a third seamer if need be." [...] Ted discussed the matter with the other selectors and the decision was to ignore my advice, and play Len, Brian and myself. It was a farce. The pitch didn't have a blade of grass on it and I was reduced to bowling off-cutters, but I couldn't pitch them slow enough to have much effect.|$|E
2500|$|Hornsby {{had played}} 155 games {{at second base}} in the 1927 season, but he was traded by the Giants to the Boston Braves in January 1928, freeing up a slot for Cohen. With the Mayor of New York City, Jimmy Walker, on hand {{to throw out the}} first ball at the 1928 Opening Day game, Cohen led the Giants to a 5–3 victory over the Boston Braves, hitting two singles and a double, {{knocking}} in two runs, and scoring two. Thousands of fans rushed onto the field after the game and carried Cohen off the field on their shoulders. As the Giants' regular second baseman, Cohen had his best season in the major leagues, batting [...]274 with 24 doubles, 7 triples, and 9 home runs. The Giants played on his success on the field, with vendors selling [...] "Ice Cream Cohens" [...] in the concession stands at the Polo Grounds. The Los Angeles Times called the Giants' promotion of Cohen one of [...] "the most efficient job of ballyhoo that has been performed in the sport industry..." [...] Time magazine noted his popularity, reporting on a note from an adoring fan that read [...] "I understand you are Jewish and single... if you would care to meet a brunette... Anyway <b>drop</b> <b>me</b> a little note...", one of hundreds Cohen said he had received.|$|E

6000|$|... "You {{know well}} enough where I came from, Josiah Crabtree," [...] cried Dick wrathfully. [...] "You <b>dropped</b> <b>me</b> into the hollow for dead, didn't you!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nothing, I suppose," [...] he admitted, [...] "yet there's {{a certain}} risk about <b>dropping</b> <b>me,</b> isn't there? You might drive {{me into the}} arms of the enemy." ...|$|R
60|$|Charley {{laid down}} her pen, the copy being finished, opened and shut her cramped little hand, looked gravely at the page, half in pride and half in doubt, and got up, and <b>dropped</b> <b>me</b> a curtsy.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yuh, I know, Wrenn. I'd {{like to go}} {{traveling}} myself--I {{suppose you}} fellows think I wouldn't care to go bumming around like you do and {{never have to worry}} about how the firm's going to break even. But--Well, good-by, old man, and don't forget us. <b>Drop</b> <b>me</b> a line now and then and let me know how you're getting along. Oh say, if you happen to see any novelties that look good let us hear about them. But <b>drop</b> <b>me</b> a line, anyway. We'll always be glad to hear from you. Well, good-by and good luck. Sure and <b>drop</b> <b>me</b> a line." ...|$|E
60|$|Well, {{you think}} it over, Nast, and <b>drop</b> <b>me</b> a line. We should have some fun.|$|E
60|$|LEMMY. 'Ere! 'Arf a mo'! Yer said yer'd <b>drop</b> <b>me</b> at my plyce. Well, I tell yer candid--this 'yn't my plyce.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm sorry, Mr. Austin, but {{he never}} came near {{my side of the}} bridge," [...] he said. [...] "If I had got up he'd have <b>dropped</b> <b>me</b> with the pistol, and that wouldn't have done much good to anybody." ...|$|R
60|$|With a convulsive shudder {{the thing}} stiffened, the jaws relaxed, <b>dropping</b> <b>me</b> to the ground, and then, {{careening}} once in mid air, the creature plunged headforemost to the road, full upon Woola, who still clung tenaciously to its gory head.|$|R
60|$|RIDGEON. Well, did {{you find}} us so very cruel, after all? They tell me that though you have <b>dropped</b> <b>me,</b> you stay for weeks with the Bloomfield Boningtons and the Walpoles. I think it must be true, because they never mention you to me now.|$|R
6000|$|LIZA [to Pickering, {{taking no}} {{apparent}} notice of Higgins, and working away deftly] Will you <b>drop</b> <b>me</b> altogether {{now that the}} experiment is over, Colonel Pickering? ...|$|E
6000|$|As we rode off Rube shouted out, 'If {{you change}} your mind again about coming with me to Missouri, you just <b>drop</b> <b>me</b> a line, Pepita.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A. <b>DROP</b> <b>ME</b> A LINE, PETE, EVEN IF YOU HAVE {{to write}} {{with your left}} hand. Address X. Y. Z., General Postoffice, Washington. From YOU KNOW WHO." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{that ought}} not to take you all the evening. Come along; I don't {{want to have the}} extra ticket and not use it. A friend of mine from Brooklyn was going with me, but he has just <b>dropped</b> <b>me</b> a postal card saying he is sick." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What," [...] said I, turning {{round to}} an old man of the world, who {{happened}} to be in the room at the time, [...] "what do these people mean by asking a fellow to dinner in August, and taking <b>me</b> up after <b>dropping</b> <b>me</b> for two years?" ...|$|R
60|$|Then her quiet, {{travelling}} glance descended and {{hovered in}} secret colloquy with mine. She <b>dropped</b> <b>me</b> a little smiling, formal nod, moistened her lips, and composed herself for Mrs Monnerie. And {{it was then}} I became conscious that Susan had quietly {{slipped out of the}} room.|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps," [...] he {{observed}} pleasantly, [...] "I am {{out of place}} here. <b>Drop</b> <b>me</b> a line {{and let me know}} how things are going to the Hotel Capitol at Washington." ...|$|E

60|$|July 20.--A rainy day, and I am very drowsy {{and would}} give the world to ------[358].

60|$|She {{wiped her}} eyes with {{the corner of her}} apron, <b>dropped</b> <b>me</b> a curtsey, and withdrew. Feurgéres came in presently, and I avoided looking at him for the first few minutes. To tell the truth, there was a lump in my own throat. When he spoke, however, his tone was as usual.|$|R
60|$|FRANKLYN [to Conrad] What {{on earth}} does this mean? I havnt {{heard from him}} nor {{exchanged}} a word with him for years. I resigned {{the chairmanship of the}} Liberal Association and shook the dust of party politics from my feet before he was Prime Minister in the Coalition. Of course, he <b>dropped</b> <b>me</b> like a hot potato.|$|R
60|$|If you {{see your}} way to meet us in New Orleans, <b>drop</b> <b>me</b> a line, now, and as we {{approach}} that city I will telegraph you what day we shall arrive there.|$|E

6000|$|I {{gave her}} every assistance. [...] "It was when, after the music, I {{had been talking}} to Lady John.

6000|$|... "Sit down, gentlemen," [...] cried Grant, {{striking}} {{his hands}} heartily. [...] "Sit down {{all of you}} and {{have a glass of}} wine.

Not that you would have liked that, eh?" ...|$|R
5000|$|He {{remarked to}} an {{interviewer}} after the bout that [...] "I {{did not expect}} the Thai to put up such a good fight, it was my hardest fight so far."
