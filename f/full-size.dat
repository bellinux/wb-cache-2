5|$|Lodge Hill Garage, Abingdon, Oxfordshire has a <b>full-size</b> replica Spitfire {{as its own}} rooftop monument. Owner Peter Jewson {{bought the}} replica in a {{campaign}} to build the first ever national memorial to honour the 166 women from the Air Transport Auxiliary (ATA) who flew Spitfires and other aircraft from factories to their operational airbases; 14 died during these ferry flights.|$|E
5|$|No {{architectural}} drawings {{survive for}} any English cathedral earlier than 1525 (although an engineer's {{design for a}} proposed new water supply at Canterbury cathedral priory exists in a 12th-century plan). Architectural details, such as window tracery designs, were not executed as scale drawings, but were incised <b>full-size</b> onto a large flat gypsum tracing-floor, examples of which survive at York and Wells.|$|E

5|$|A pony-sized Finnhorse must measure no {{more than}} 148cm (14.2-1/2 hands, 58-1/2inches) at the withers or the croup. Both sexes are also {{required}} to pass either a drivability or a ridability test. The horse's pedigree is also evaluated, and uncharacteristically small individuals descending from larger-sized lines are not accepted. The horse should be proportionately small all over, and express all the qualities of a <b>full-size</b> Finnhorse. Especially thorough {{attention is paid to}} the pony-sized horse's character, obedience and cooperation. The pony-sized Finnhorse is suited to practically any use the larger Finnhorse is, with the exception of heavy draught work because of its smaller size and proportionally reduced strength. However, some individuals have been able to compete with and even win against <b>full-size</b> Finnhorses in work horse competitions. Many pony-sized individuals are cross-registered for trotter section breeding, as small Finnhorses can be equal competitors in harness against larger ones. In combined driving, the pony-sized Finnhorse's size is an advantage, allowing for greater agility. The section is popular for therapy and riding school use.|$|E
5|$|Crowley {{started the}} process of {{designing}} the Tumbler for the film by model bashing. Crowley used the nose cone of a P-38 Lightning model {{to serve as the}} chassis for the Tumbler's turbine engine. Six models of the Tumbler were built to 1:12 scale in the course of four months. Following the scale model creation, a crew of over 30 people, including Crowley and engineers Chris Culvert and Annie Smith, carved a <b>full-size</b> replica of the Tumbler out of a large block of Styrofoam in two months.|$|E
5|$|In 1962 Moore {{created an}} edition of 10 working models (LH 504) {{for a new}} two-piece sculpture. The Tate Gallery in London {{acquired}} a small working model in 1963. Other working models are in the collections of the Gemeentemuseum in The Hague, the Didrichsen Art Museum in Helsinki, the Memorial Art Gallery of the University of Rochester in Rochester, New York, and the Kunsthaus in Zurich. Moore planned the <b>full-size</b> sculpture to be over 10 feet high, large enough {{for a person to}} walk between the two elements.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, a <b>full-size</b> {{replica of}} the mill was built at the Binjiang Park in Nanjing, China. Together with replicas of three other Dutch monuments, {{it is part of}} the 'Van Gogh Friendship Park', in honour of the {{relationships}} between the sister cities of Eindhoven and Nanjing, and the sister provinces of North-Brabant and Jiangsu. The mayor of Nanjing, Ji Jianye, visited the Watermill at Opwetten in 2012, during his visit to Eindhoven.|$|E
5|$|Lighting {{designer}} Cory FitzGerald {{worked with}} VER {{for the light}} setup, which was handled by A.C.T Lighting. On the Moonshine Jungle Tour, FitzGerald used 276 panels of Chromlech Elidy, 42 Clay Paky Sharpy Washes, 80 Clay Paky Sharpy beams. In order to control the 8,000 lighting set, two grandMA2 <b>full-size</b> units with 6 MA Network Processing Unit were used. Dave Marcucci was the lighting director for Mars' tour.|$|E
5|$|Many notable {{people have}} either lived or {{stayed in the}} Royal Crescent since it was first built over 240 years ago, and some are commemorated on special plaques {{attached}} to the relevant buildings. Of the Royal Crescent's 30 townhouses, 10 are still <b>full-size</b> townhouses; 18 have been split into flats of various sizes; 1 is the No. 1 Royal Crescent museum and the large central house at number 16 is the Royal Crescent Hotel.|$|E

5|$|Teams {{that have}} won the UEFA Champions League {{three times in a}} row, or five times overall, receive a multiple-winner badge. Six teams have earned this privilege: Real Madrid, Ajax, Bayern Munich, Milan, Liverpool and Barcelona. Until 2009, clubs that had earned that badge were allowed to keep the European Champion Clubs' Cup and a new one was commissioned; since 2009, the winning team each year has {{received}} a <b>full-size</b> replica of the trophy, while the original is retained by UEFA.|$|E
5|$|Teaneck has 24 {{municipal}} parks, {{of which}} 14 are developed. Votee Park, the township's largest, covers , surrounded by Queen Ann Road, Palisade Avenue, Court Street and Colonial Court. Including baseball fields, soccer fields, playgrounds and the township's inground swimming facility, {{the park was}} renamed in honor of former mayor Milton Votee in 1958. A Sportsplex was opened {{at the southern end}} of Votee Park in 2014, which includes two synthetic turf <b>full-size</b> soccer fields, one of which is also lined for use for football.|$|E
5|$|The Canadian Air and Space Museum (CASM), {{located at}} the former CFB Downsview, {{features}} a <b>full-size</b> replica Arrow built by volunteers with assistance from local aerospace firms. With a metal structure, the replica features many authentic-looking components including landing gear constructed by Messier-Dowty, the original Arrow primary landing gear sub-contractor. Painted in the colours of Arrow 25203, the Arrow replica was rolled out for a media event on 28 September 2006 and was on public display on 8–9 October 2006 to commemorate the original aircraft's rollout in 1957.|$|E
5|$|The Halifax Gibbet was {{dismantled}} {{after the}} last executions in 1650, and the site was neglected until the platform on which the gibbet had been mounted was rediscovered in about 1840. A <b>full-size</b> non-working replica was erected on the original stone base in August 1974; it includes a blade made from a casting of the original, which as of 2011 is displayed in the Bankfield Museum in Boothtown {{on the outskirts of}} Halifax. A commemorative plaque nearby lists the names of the 52 people known to have been executed by the device.|$|E
5|$|The Maya {{had a long}} {{tradition}} of mural painting; rich polychrome murals have been excavated at San Bartolo, dating to between 300 and 200 BC. Walls were coated with plaster, and polychrome designs were painted onto the smooth finish. The majority of such murals have not survived, but Early Classic tombs painted in cream, red, and black have been excavated at Caracol, Río Azul, and Tikal. Among the best preserved murals are a <b>full-size</b> series of Late Classic paintings at Bonampak.|$|E
5|$|The Natural History Museum in London {{contains}} a famous mounted skeleton and life-size {{model of a}} blue whale, which were both the first of their kind in the world, but have since been replicated at the University of California, Santa Cruz. Similarly, the American Museum of Natural History in New York City has a <b>full-size</b> model in its Milstein Family Hall of Ocean Life. A juvenile blue whale skeleton is installed at the New Bedford Whaling Museum in New Bedford, Massachusetts.|$|E
5|$|The {{reconstruction}} of Castell Coch was delayed until 1875, {{because of the}} demands of work at Cardiff Castle and an unfounded concern by the Marquess's trustees that he was facing bankruptcy. On commencement, the Kitchen Tower, Hall Block and shell wall were rebuilt first, followed by the Well Tower and the Gatehouse, and the Keep Tower last. Burges's drawings for the proposed rebuilding survive at the Bute seat of Mount Stuart. The drawings were supplemented by {{a large number of}} wooden and plaster models, from smaller pieces to <b>full-size</b> models of furniture.|$|E
5|$|The second cast of {{the work}} is located in Abingdon Street Gardens (better known as College Green) in the City of Westminster. The other <b>full-size</b> casts are located near the Bloedel Floral Conservatory in Queen Elizabeth Park in Vancouver, donated by Prentice Bloedel; near the Rose Garden of the Rockefeller family house at Kykuit at Tarrytown, New York. Moore donated his artist's copy (0/3) to the Henry Moore Foundation in 1977, and it is {{displayed}} at Perry Green, Hertfordshire.|$|E
5|$|The second park is Carr Hill Reservoir Park, which {{occupies}} {{the site of}} the covered reservoir at Carr Hill and Ruskin Roads. This is a larger park containing a play area and contained sports area paid for by fundraising by local residents. There is also a <b>full-size</b> football pitch, which is the base of Sheriff Hill Football Club; a mixed-sex club of around 125 players which is substantially funded by Gateshead Council.|$|E
5|$|The sleeve {{front cover}} used a {{black-and-white}} still from The Man Who Fell to Earth, in which Bowie, as the character Thomas Jerome Newton, {{steps into the}} space capsule that will return him to his home planet. Bowie had insisted on the cropped black-and-white image as he felt that in the original coloured <b>full-size</b> image the sky looked artificial; when Rykodisc reissued Bowie's catalogue in the early 1990s the colour version was used. The back cover showed Bowie sketching the Kabbalah Sephirot with chalk—something {{he had been doing}} on the set of the film.|$|E
5|$|A <b>full-size</b> {{replica of}} the Coandă-1910, built in 2001, is {{displayed}} in Bucharest at the National Military Museum, and a scale model is displayed in the French Air and Space Museum at Paris – Le Bourget Airport. At {{the site of the}} historic Issy-les-Moulineaux airfield, a large plaque lists the three pioneers of flight most closely associated with the airfield: Louis Blériot, Alberto Santos-Dumont and Henri Farman. Later, a plaque honouring Coandă and Romanian aviation engineer Traian Vuia was placed on a nearby building {{under the auspices of the}} mayor of Issy-les-Moulineaux, L'Aéroclub de France, and the Romanian Association for Aviation History.|$|E
5|$|A <b>full-size</b> {{reproduction}} of September Morn was {{displayed in a}} window of Jackson and Semmelmeyer, a photography shop in Chicago, Illinois, in March 1913. A passing police officer noticed the print and on grounds that it was indecent, insisted it be taken down. The mayor of the city, Carter Harrison, Jr., agreed with the policeman's decision, and deemed that the image could be sold, but should not be displayed in public as children could see it. Fred Jackson, the owner, was charged with indecency, and at his request the case was brought to trial on March 18.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{original}} fleet {{did not include}} any minibuses, {{a large number of}} Mercedes-Benz vehicles were introduced from September 1986 on a high-frequency route in central and northern Glasgow; it did not prove profitable and was converted to <b>full-size</b> operation a year later, with many of the minibuses transferred to other SBG subsidiaries. Another unusual vehicle in the Kelvin fleet was the only Leyland Lynx bought by Scottish Bus Group, which was delivered new in 1989. Six rare Leyland Lion double-deckers were ordered in 1988, but owing to a large cut in Kelvin's peak vehicle requirement they did not enter service with the company and were instead sent to Clydeside Scottish.|$|E
