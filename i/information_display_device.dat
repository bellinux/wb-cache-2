40|$|A novel {{information}} system for detecting mastitis in dairy cattle and managing their milking {{processes in the}} milking parlor is designed. The system comprises three major subsystems—the mastitis detection device, the <b>information</b> <b>display</b> <b>device,</b> and the cloud database. The mastitis detection device can detect and evaluate the degree of mastitis immediately before the milking operations are carried out. The <b>information</b> <b>display</b> <b>device</b> shows information {{on the health of}} the dairy cattle obtained from a cloud database to manage the milk production of a dairy farm. Importantly, the proposed system utilizes a wireless sensor network (WSN) with low power consumption that connects the <b>information</b> <b>display</b> <b>device</b> with the remote management system. Experimental results reveal that our proposed system can reduce the risk of milking cattle with mastitis and improve efficiency of milk production...|$|E

40|$|The {{functionality}} of {{an information}} kiosk {{can be extended}} by allowing it to interact with a smartphone, {{as demonstrated by the}} Kimono system, and the user interface can be greatly simplified by “associations ” between pieces of information. A kiosk provides information that is relevant to a particu-lar location and can use valuable context information, such as the fact that a user is physically {{standing in front of the}} kiosk, to tailor the display. Its graphically rich screen is suit-able for presenting information to the user and has a natural input modality requiring the user to simply touch the screen. However, a kiosk lacks mobility and cannot stay with the user as he or she moves about the environment. Also, infor-mation provided by the kiosk must be remembered by the user. Finally, it is difficult to add information to the kiosk, and so the kiosk remains an <b>information</b> <b>display</b> <b>device.</b> All this changes when a handset, such as a PDA or smart-phone, can interact with the kiosk. The handset acts like a personalized proxy of the kiosk. It accompanies the user serving as a memory device. It is also an excellent media cre-ation device, capable of taking pictures and recording voice memos as well as short text messages. Associating newly created content with other currently selected content makes for a simpler user interface. Content and its associations can be uploaded to a kiosk allowing others to access to it. ...|$|E

40|$|Self-cleaning {{technology}} {{is used in}} a variety of products today, with glazing products being the foremost area of application. However, there are several self-cleaning technologies in use and their self-cleaning efficiency may be unclear. This study aims to give a comprehensive state-of-the-art review of the self-cleaning glazing products available on the market today and investigate methods for measuring the self-cleaning effect. Various future research pathways and opportunities for the self-cleaning products of tomorrow are also explored within this study, with emphasis on solar energy application areas such as daylight, solar radiation transmission, electrochromism, building integrated photovoltaics (BIPV), solar cell glazing and solar cells in general. Self-cleaning products from several manufacturers that utilize two different self-cleaning technologies of either photocatalytic hydrophilic or hydrophobic capability are presented. The photocatalytic hydrophilic products in question are self-cleaning glazing products ready-to-use when purchased, whilst the presented hydrophobic products are coatings that must be applied to existing glazing products in order to yield a water-repellent and self-cleaning surface. It is stated that the self-cleaning action of the photocatalytic hydrophilic products is evident through 25 – 30 years, even during dry spills, and that they are able to maintain a cleaner surface than ordinary untreated float glass. However, the self-cleaning action of hydrophobic-coated products is limited by a relatively short life expectancy of about 3 – 4 years, and their self-cleaning performance is found to be feeble compared to ordinary untreated float glass. Nonetheless, the potential for future use of both self-cleaning technologies are apparent, with focus on alternative application areas such as solar cells, BIPV and <b>information</b> <b>display</b> <b>devices,</b> which indeed could benefit from utilizing the self-cleaning technology. Visions for future self-cleaning products are also discussed, which combine self-cleaning abilities with photovoltaism and electrochromism, whereupon the applicability of the self-cleaning technology may be greatly increased...|$|R

40|$|With the {{discovery}} of moving pictures around 1880, a paradigm change took place that decisively altered human perception. With the advent of electronic images, the separation between information carriers and image carriers was consummated in a radical way {{during the second half}} of the 20 th century – we assume this to be a paradigm change as important as that of 120 years ago. Because, as a result of a delay in knowledge, electronic images today are all too generously labelled ‘digital’, but fail to be explained by that designation, a formal classification into analogue and digital, hardware and software appears indispensable both for understanding and for preserving this type of media (art). This reveals that it is not at all the case that we simply live in the digital age and from now on can pass on our cultural artefacts without loss. Quite the contrary: abandoning the originals – and in media art, this just happens to include also the <b>display</b> <b>devices</b> with their techno-cultural specificities – is threatening to bring about a knowledge surrogate very soon, right under our nose so to speak, encouraging a precarious relationship between action and history. In this sense, the text is also intended as a critique of the ‘Variable Media Initiative’ which – paradoxically, with regard to art being passed on on a very long-term basis – threatens to abandon the material basis of a number of contemporary works of art. The independence of <b>information</b> carriers and <b>display</b> <b>devices</b> has led to specialised sensitivities, making it extremely difficult to bring together works in their entirety...|$|R
