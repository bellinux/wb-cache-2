5000|$|Waterfront {{station was}} built by the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) in 1914, and was the Pacific {{terminus}} for the CPR's transcontinental passenger trains to Montreal and Toronto. The current station is the third CPR station. The previous CPR station was located one block west, {{at the foot of}} Granville, and unlike the current classical-styled Waterfront station was built in [...] "railway gothic" [...] like the CPR's many railway hotels. In 1978, when Via Rail took over the passenger operations of the CPR and the Canadian National Railway, it continued using both railways' Vancouver stations, but a year later, Via consolidated its Vancouver operations at the CN station near False Creek (now called Pacific Central station), and ceased using the CPR station. The last scheduled Via passenger train to use Waterfront station departed on 27 Oct 1979.Waterfront station's transformation into a public <b>intermodal</b> <b>transit</b> <b>facility</b> began in 1977. That year, SeaBus began operating out of a purpose-built floating pier that was connected to the main terminal building via an overhead walkway above the CPR tracks. The CPR's passenger platform and some of its tracks were torn up in the early 1980s {{to make way for the}} guideway of the original SkyTrain line (Expo Line), which opened on December 11, 1985. During Expo 86, SkyTrain operated special shuttle trains between Waterfront station and Stadium-Chinatown station (then named Stadium station), connecting the Canadian Pavilion at Canada Place to the main Expo site along False Creek.In 1995, platforms were built adjacent to the SkyTrain station for the new West Coast Express, which uses the existing CPR tracks. (The West Coast Express platforms are in the same location as the old CPR platforms.) In 2002, Millennium Line trains began sharing the SkyTrain tracks with the Expo Line. In 2009, the Canada Line opened with a separate platform and entrance/exit point within the grand CPR station. Waterfront station serves as the common terminus point for all three SkyTrain metro lines.|$|E

40|$|This project proposes {{an urban}} design {{strategy}} for the North End of downtown Sacramento, California; the culmination {{of which is the}} design for a new <b>intermodal</b> <b>transit</b> <b>facility.</b> The intention is to recapture development into downtown by reclaiming the former Southern Pacific Railyard site, and propose a formal and programmatic development strategy allowing Sacramento to balance downtown growth through renewed connections into its North End. Conceptually this occurs at three scales: City, District, and Architectural, represented by the three scales of site. The entire 240 acre rail yard site will balance growth at the scale of downtown; the smaller 45 acre transit district will balance growth between the central business district and a new activity district in the North End; and finally the transit facility will itself act as a bridge across the tracks allowing for direct communication between the new and the old city fabrics...|$|E
