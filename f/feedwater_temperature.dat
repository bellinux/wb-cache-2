The use of renewable energy to power reverse osmosis desalination plants to provide potable water for around 50, 000 people in Newhaven, in South East England, and in Massawa in Eritrea, was investigated. The following energy sources, {{in a variety of}} combinations were specifically assessed: • Wind Power • Wave Power • Solar Power • Tidal Current Power • Hydrogen production, storage and use in Fuel Cells The following types of reverse osmosis plants were studied: • No Brine Stream Recovery (BSR) reverse osmosis plant • Pelton Wheel BSR reverse osmosis plant • Pressure Exchanger BSR reverse osmosis plant Modelling was conducted to derive the amount of water that each reverse osmosis plant would deliver from various combinations and amounts of renewable power input, at varying <b>feedwater</b> <b>temperatures.</b> Scenarios that were not able to deliver enough water to meet the users' needs were scaled-up so that they could. • The cost of the scaled-up scenarios that were able to meet the users' water demands were compared with the costs associated with the equivalent conventionally-powered scenario over a 25 -year life. Specifically, the following were considered: l' 1 • A coal-fired plant with carbon capture and storage (CCS) at Newhaven and • A diesel generator at Massawa.

40|$|This work {{advances}} {{the state}} of the art by presenting a transport analysis of air gap membrane distillation (AGMD) and of direct contact membrane distillation (DCMD), based on a two-dimensional conjugate model in which, the temperature and concentration of the hot and cold solutions both normal to the membrane and along it are solved, so that the sensitivity of the permeate flux to the major system parameters could be better evaluated. Employment of spacers in the flow channels for improving the process by reducing the convective resistance is also investigated. Significantly, this is the first comprehensive analysis and exposition of all resistance to heat and mass transfer in the process. ^ The solutions were validated in comparison with available experimental results. The modeling and sensitivity analysis provide useful basic detailed information about the nature of the process, and are helpful for process improvement and optimization. Some of the principal conclusions are: (1) the air/vapor gap has the major role in reducing the parasitic heat loss in the process, (2) the gap width has an important effect: decreasing it 5 -fold increases the permeate flux 2. 6 -fold, but the thermal efficiency improves only slightly because the conductive heat loss increases too, (3) increasing the inlet temperature of the hot solution has a major effect on the permeate flux and also increase the thermal efficiency, while decreasing the coolant temperature has a lesser effect on the flux increase, and even slightly reduces the efficiency, (4) the feedwater salt concentration has a very small effect on the permeate flux and thermal efficiency, (5) the inlet velocities of the hot and cold solutions have a relatively small effect, (6) reducing the thermal conductivity of the membrane material improves the process thermal efficiency somewhat, (7) the permeate flux of DCMD is higher than that of AGMD by about 2. 3 -fold at Thi = 80 °C and becomes even higher for low inlet saline <b>feedwater</b> <b>temperatures</b> (at Thi = 40 °C, JDCMD/JAGMD = 4. 8), (8) the sensitivity of DCMD to the main process parameters is more noticeable than that in AGMD, (9) for MD it appears that the central type is the most effective one, and can improve the flux by about 33 % over the empty channel.

40|$|The {{combination}} of MBR membrane technology with reverse osmosis (RO) for wastewater treatment {{has been proven}} to provide a very high quality effluent. The MBR efficiently removes nutrients (C, N & P) from the influent wastewater together with suspended solids and colloids making it suitable to feed it to a RO membrane which removes most of {{the remainder of the}} dissolved compounds, to produce very high quality effluent which is of drinking water quality. The main advantages of the wastewater treatment systems based on MBR technology are the quality of output water and the need of little installation space, in comparison with conventional activated sludge (CAS) systems. However, fouling particularly of the RO membrane, remains a problem when using the RO membrane as a final stage in a wastewater reclamation plant. Membranes require frequent chemical cleaning processes to control the build-up of organic, inorganic and biological fouling on the membrane surface. As the membrane gets fouled, increasing amounts of energy are required to produce the same amount of product water. Therefore it is essential to understand what is causing the fouling and what control measures must be applied to achieve long-term sustainable operation. The objective of this project is to understand how the composition of the RO influent water (MBR effluent) in terms of inorganic contaminants, temperature, pH and the system recovery affects membrane fouling. To achieve this objective, the feedwater of an MBR-RO pilot plant located at Quart was studied to obtain a characterisation of RO feedwater quality. The results of a membrane autopsy were used to see what types of membrane fouling are observed during operation. An RO membrane simulation model was then used to understand through multiple simulations how the feed water quality, temperature, pH and system recovery affect membrane fouling, the product water quality and the energy consumption. The results are then used to propose strategies to control membrane fouling and optimize process operation in terms of energy use and permeate quality. The results from the autopsy and those from the modelling studies confirm that the main component of inorganic fouling is Calcium Carbonate (CaCO 3) particularly on the concentrate side of the membrane (the end of the membrane). On the feed side of the membrane, organic fouling was predominant. The modelling studies showed that the addition of acid to control the pH could control the CaCO 3 precipitation. Furthermore, we have shown that the optimal process recovery to run the RO membrane at the lowest energy consumption for different <b>feedwater</b> <b>temperatures</b> between 24 and 27 ºC is 70 - 75 %.

The design process {{of a nuclear}} power plant control system is a {{multi-step}} process, whose final result is the implementation of the feedback controllers. In particular, the control system configuration has been finalized after having considered different strategies to govern the variables of interest (e. g., power produced in the core, coolant temperature, pressure, etc.). In a previous work (Ponciroli et al., 2014 b), the most relevant issues regarding both the controlled outputs (e. g., the lead temperature in the cold leg) and the control inputs (e. g., the <b>feedwater</b> inlet <b>temperature</b> and the lead mass flow rate) have been allowed for.

Indeed, starting from the linearization of the dedicated object-oriented model, the level of decoupling among the control loops has been verified, confirming the validity of the proposed solution based on the outcomes of the Relative Gain Array (RGA) method. This result has been achieved thanks to a proper tuning of the controller parameters, which allows damping the undesired influence due to the other control loops.

The effects of main steam pressure and temperature, final <b>feedwater</b> <b>temperature,</b> and hot salt and cold salt return temperatures were determined on gross and half-net efficiencies. The main steam pressures ranged from 120 bar-a (subcritical) to 260 bar-a (supercritical). Hot salt temperatures of 566 and 600 %C 2 %B 0 C were evaluated, which resulted in main steam temperatures of 553 and 580 %C 2 %B 0 C, respectively. Also, the effects of final <b>feedwater</b> <b>temperature</b> (between 260 and 320 %C 2 %B 0 C) were evaluated, which impacted the cold salt return temperature. The annual energy production and levelized cost of energy (LCOE) were calculated using the System Advisory Model on 165 MWe subcritical plants (baseline and advanced) and the most promising supercritical plants. It was concluded that the supercritical steam plants produced more annual energy than the baseline subcritical steam plant for the same-size heliostat field, receiver, and thermal storage system. Two supercritical steam plants had the highest annual performance and had nearly the same LCOE. Both operated at 230 bar-a main steam pressure.

One of the most cost-effective ways of improving the efficiency of a high pressure steam boiler is to install an economizer on the boiler. Typically, on a high pressure water tube boiler, the efficiency improvement with an economizer is 2 to 4 %, depending on firing rate. On a high pressure fire tube boiler, the improvement is 2 to 3. 5 %, depending on boiler size and firing rate. The economizers are located in the boiler stack close to the stack gas outlet of the boiler. A feedwater line, which serves the boiler, is piped to the unit. No additional feedwater control valves or stack gas dampers are required. Presently in NTPC stage II units there are some bank of tubes in economizer. There was a proposal from management to add another bank of tubes in the economizer so that there will be control of pollutants coming out from boiler, and to find how much feed water temperature raises both from subcritical and Supercritical operating conditions. An investigation is conducted on the effect of performance of the boiler by incorporating the additional bank of tubes in the space below the lower bank of tubes.

Dicho método consistirá en la utilización de un algoritmo genético, que buscará maximizar el rendimiento de la central y minimizar el coste de la electricidad. El diseño de centrales térmicas con rendimientos elevados es fundamental para el sector energético. Mejoras marginales en el funcionamiento de las instalaciones de producción de energía eléctrica disminuyen significativamente el coste de generación. La obtención de estas mejoras permite a las empresas del sector ser más competitivas en los mercados eléctricos modernos. El conjunto de parámetros que gobierna el rendimiento de la central es numeroso, e incluye el número de calentadores cerrados, la presión de las extracciones o las temperaturas en los calentadores. Incrementar el rendimiento termodinámico de una central térmica supone un aumento del coste de los componentes de la misma. Esto da lugar a que la optimización de una central térmica sea un problema complejo que no tiene solución única, y que debe tener en cuenta las limitaciones técnicas de los propios componentes de la instalación. Para el desarrollo del programa de optimización se utilizó el software Matlab, que permite implementar un algoritmo genético de forma sencilla y construir una interfaz de usuario para el programa. La herramienta informática desarrollada permite la configuración de los parámetros que definen a la central de manera intuitiva, permitiendo escoger entre establecer las variables de diseño como valores fijos o rangos. Cuando una variable se establece como rango, el algoritmo genético busca el valor óptimo dentro del rango proporcionado. El tren de calentadores de una central térmica cumple la función de elevar el rendimiento termodinámico del ciclo. Mediante la extracción de vapor procedente de las turbinas del ciclo, se eleva la temperatura del agua de alimentación de la caldera. El aumento de rendimiento se produce al disminuir el consumo de combustible, puesto que la carga del generador de vapor se reduce. Físicamente, el tren de calentadores está compuesto por intercambiadores de calor cerrados y un intercambiador abierto. Se detalla en este proyecto un método de cálculo para resolver un ciclo termodinámico Rankine y obtener el coste de la electricidad de una central térmica. Adicionalmente se dimensionarán los calentadores cerrados que componen el tren de calentadores. Se han estudiado diversas configuraciones del tren de calentadores en centrales térmicas mediante el programa creado. Tras el análisis de las soluciones óptimas, se concluye que es posible mejorar los diseños industriales modernos mediante la modificación de la presión de las extracciones y la temperatura de los calentadores. Aunque las configuraciones existentes hoy en día se acercan a los valores óptimos, mejorar el tren de calentadores puede suponer incrementos de entre el 0. 5 y el 1 % de rendimiento, y disminuciones de entre el 1 y el 2 % del coste. Debe notarse {{sin embargo}} que estos resultados están sujetos a la incertidumbre de las funciones de costes, y a que se deben analizar aspectos adicionales del funcionamiento de una central térmica (como pueden ser los procesos de arranque y operación a carga parcial) para validar los resultados. The {{purpose of this}} project {{is to develop a}} method for the optimization of the feedwater heater train of a subcritical coal power plant. Using a genetic algorithm, the thermodynamic efficiency will be maximized and the cost of electricity minimized. Thus, the mathematical problem becomes a multi-objective optimization. The design of high-performance power stations is a matter of great importance for the electric power industry. Marginal improvements in power plant operations and efficiency can have a substantial impact in the cost of generation. In order to better compete in the evolving electricity markets, utilities are in a constant pursuit of these advances. The set of parameters which determines the efficiency of a coal power plant has several components, such as the number of closed feedwater preheaters, the turbine steam bleed pressures, or the <b>temperatures</b> in the <b>feedwater</b> preheaters. The design trade-offs between increasing the efficiency and decreasing the cost of electricity are a significant challenge for engineers. Due to this trade-offs, the design problem has multiple solutions. To guarantee the validity of the solutions, the technical limitations of the power plant equipment must be always accounted for. The optimization software has been developed using the Matlab environment, which provides the user with a simple method for the implementation of a genetic algorithm, and also includes the tools needed to develop a graphical user interface. The developed software tool allows the user to set the values of the optimization parameters in a simple way, and to choose which parameters shall be fixed or shall be a range. When a range is chosen, the genetic algorithm will search for an optimal value within the range provided. The feedwater heater train fulfills the purpose of increasing the thermodynamic efficiency of the cycle. By means of bleed steam from the turbine, the water heading to the steam generator is heated up. The efficiency rises {{as a consequence of the}} reduced thermal load in the steam generator, which leads to a reduced fuel consumption. The feedwater heater train itself is composed of several closed heat exchangers and one open heat exchanger. In this project, a method to solve a Rankine thermodynamic cycle and calculate the cost of electricity is described. Additionally, the closed feedwater heaters will be dimensioned. Several different feedwater heater train configurations were studied using the developed software. After analysing the results, it is concluded that modern industrial designs can be improved through a combination of modifying the steam bleed pressure and the <b>feedwater</b> heater <b>temperature.</b> Though the configurations used today are close to the optimal values, enhancing the feedwater heater train can lead to increases of between 0. 5 and 1 % in thermodynamic efficiency, and to reductions of between 1 and 2 % in the cost of electricity. However, it should be noticed that these results are subject to uncertainties in the cost functions, and that additional aspects of a power plant operation -such as startup procedures and partial load operation- should be analysed in order to validate the solutions.

In addition, a thermodynamic turbine cycle model was developed using the commercial software PEPSE® to compare {{the performance of the}} ANFIS based turbine cycle model. The results show that the proposed ANFIS based turbine cycle model is capable of accurately estimating turbine-generator output and providing more reliable results than the PEPSE® based turbine cycle models. Moreover, test results show that the ANFIS performed better than the artificial neural network (ANN), which has also being tried to model the turbine cycle. The effectiveness of the proposed neuro-fuzzy based turbine cycle model was demonstrated using the actual operating data of Kuosheng NPP. Furthermore, the results also provide an alternative approach to evaluate the thermal performance of nuclear power plants...|$|E
40|$|Lead-cooled Fast Reactors (LFRs) {{are being}} deeply studied within the Generation IV International Forum (GIF) {{framework}} {{because of their}} features which well suit nuclear sustainability and safety. Different design configurations have been considered, each of them requiring different modelling approaches {{for the study of}} the reactor dynamics and in particular of the most critical transients in terms of safety and control. In this work a linearized one-dimensional model of a lead-cooled fast reactor is presented assuming as reference design for the primary loop the European Lead SYstem (ELSY) reactor. Differently from the ELSY reference option, a supercritical water steam cycle is considered as secondary loop, which represents an attractive option for future developments of ELSY design. In order to properly describe the heat transfer in supercritical water, different correlations (available in open literature) have been analyzed and compared. The present model implements mass and energy equations, referred to a single-channel thermal-hydraulic analysis both for primary and secondary reactor system, handled in the frequency domain according to the theory of linear systems. The adopted transfer function approach simplifies the study of the reactor stability, and permitted to solve analytically in time the governing equations by means of Laplace transform method. Limitation of computer cost is a further benefit. The reactor dynamics has been characterized by simulating significant operational transients due to disturbances of input variables. In particular, system responses to perturbations of reactor power, <b>feedwater</b> <b>temperature</b> and mass flow rate, are discussed. Drawbacks due to the linearization and to the appearance of non-minimum phase effects related to the secondary loop modelling are pointed out also in the view of future development of a reactor control strategy. A discussion on the non-minimum phase source is also presented...|$|E
40|$|Presented at the International Forum on Water – Resources, Technologies And Management In The Arab World, 8 – 10 May, 2005, University of Sharjah, Sharjah, United Arab EmiratesHybrid RO MSF {{desalination}} system {{combines the}} advantages of the high desalting performance of distillation processes and the lower energy requirement of membrane processes. It allows better match between power and water requirements and enables better utilization of the power generated from MSF into the RO. Hybrid RO and MSF system will yield some economical and technical advantages. It also has potential advantages of a low power demand, improved water quality and possible lower running cost as compared to stand-alone RO or MSF plants. Hybrid RO MSF can lead to an optimized <b>feedwater</b> <b>temperature</b> of the RO plant since it is possible to use cooling seawater from the reject stage of the MSF plant as feed to RO plant. Higher feed temperature is advantageous for the RO plant since water flux of the membrane is about 2. 5 % higher per degree of temperature rise at constant pressure. This allows an increase in the RO productivity. The rate of water permeation through the membrane increase as the feed water temperature increases since the viscosity of the solution is reduced and higher diffusion rate of water through the membrane is obtained. However, increasing feed water temperature will yield lower salt rejection or higher salt passage due to higher diffusion rate for salt through the membrane. Various RO MSF combinations will be studied. Current status of RO MSF hybrid desalination systems will be reviewed. The potential advantages of RO MSF hybrid desalination systems together with the future trends will be discussed. The appropriate combinations of RO MSF hybrid desalination systems depend on the local conditions and power/water requirements. The required power to water ratio and product water quality are among the important factors in the selection of the optimum RO MSF schemes...|$|E

Department of Energy National Energy Technology Laboratory (DOE NETL), American Electric Company (AEP) and Parsons Energy and Chemical Group {{to conduct a}} {{comprehensive}} study evaluating coal fired steam power plants, known as Rankine Cycles, equipped with three different combustion systems: Pulverized Coal (PC), Circulating Fluidized Bed (CFB), and Circulating Moving Bed (CMB{trademark}). Five steam cycles utilizing {{a wide range of}} steam conditions were used with these combustion systems. The motivation for this study was to establish through engineering analysis, the most cost-effective performance potential available through improvement in the Rankine Cycle steam conditions and combustion systems {{while at the same time}} ensuring that the most stringent emission performance based on CURC (Coal Utilization Research Council) 2010 targets are met: > 98 % sulfur removal; 90 % Hg removal. The final report discusses the results of a coal fired steam power plant project, which is comprised of two parts. The main part of the study is the analysis of ten (10) Greenfield steam power plants employing three different coal combustion technologies: Pulverized Coal (PC), Circulating Fluidized Bed (CFB), and Circulating Moving Bed (CMB{trademark}) integrated with five different steam cycles. The study explores the technical feasibility, thermal performance, environmental performance, and economic viability of ten power plants that could be deployed currently, in the near, intermediate, and long-term time frame. For the five steam cycles, main steam temperatures vary from 1, 000 F to 1, 292 F and pressures from 2, 400 psi to 5, 075 psi. Reheat steam temperatures vary from 1, 000 F to 1, 328 F. The number of feedwater heaters varies from 7 to 9 and the associated <b>feedwater</b> <b>temperature</b> varies from 500 F to 626 F. The main part of the study therefore determines the steam cycle parameters and combustion technology that would yield the lowest cost of electricity (COE) for the next generation of coal-fired steam power plants. The second part of the study (Repowering) explores the means of upgrading the efficiency and output of an older existing coal fired steam power plant. There are currently more than 1, 400 coal-fired units in operation in the United States generating about 54 percent of the electricity consumed. Many of these are modern units are clean and efficient. Additionally, there are many older units in excellent condition and still in service that could benefit from this repowering technology. The study evaluates the technical feasibility, thermal performance, and economic viability of this repowering concept...|$|E
30|$|Further {{attempts}} have been made by researchers to investigate the effect of water depth in double-slope single-basin solar still. A digital simulation method has been done for the productivity of a complicated still by Cooper [16], and the influence of more common variables such as water depth, wind velocity, still insulation, double glass cover, cover slope, and daily variability on the productivity has been investigated. Results of the simulation indicate that water depth and thermal insulation have little effect on the productivity at shallow water depth and that a double glass cover and high cover slopes are not justifiable. Garg and Mann [17] have investigated the effect of climatic, operational, and design parameters for single- and double-slope solar stills under the Indian arid zone regions and to find the effect of all possible variables on the performance of the single-effect solar still. Akash et al. [18] have studied the basin-type solar still under local climatic conditions and concluded that lower water depth and salinity of the brine produced higher distillate yields for the double-slope passive solar still. The effect of wind speed on daily productivity of some active and passive solar stills using computer simulation for different solar still designs has been studied by El-Sebaii [19]. It has been shown that for the active and multi-effective passive stills, daily productivity increases with the increase of wind velocity up to a typical velocity; beyond that, the productivity becomes insignificant for single-effect passive stills. Al-Hinani et al. [20] have studied the effect of climatic, design, and operational parameters such as solar intensity, wind velocity, ambient temperature, glass cover slope angle, <b>feedwater</b> <b>temperature</b> water depth on the basin, and basin material on the distillate output of the basin-type solar still. They found that the 23 ° cover tilt angle, 0.1 -m insulation thickness, and asphalt coating of solar still of the shallow water basin are the optimum parameters for producing higher yields. Al-Hayeka and Badran [21] have found the productivity of freshwater of two different designs of stills, which are asymmetric greenhouse with mirror and symmetric greenhouse solar stills, under the climatic conditions of Jordan. It was inferred that the distilled water output of the asymmetric greenhouse type was 20 % higher than that of the symmetric greenhouse type. Mowla and Karimi [22] have simulated a mathematical model for a solar still; the rate of production of freshwater has been calculated, and experiments have been carried out in Shiraz. It has been found that the experimental and calculated results are in good agreement. The effect of water depth on the transient performance of a double-basin solar still has been investigated by Tiwari and Tiwari [23].|$|E
40|$|Increasing the {{economic}} competitiveness {{of nuclear energy}} is vital to its future. Improving {{the economic}}s of BWRs is the main goal of this work, focusing on designing cores with higher power density, to reduce the BWR capital cost. Generally, the core power density in BWRs {{is limited by the}} thermal Critical Power of its assemblies, below which heat removal can be accomplished with low fuel and cladding temperatures. The present study investigates both increases in the heat transfer area between the fuel and coolant and changes in operating parameters to achieve higher power levels while meeting the appropriate thermal as well as materials and neutronic constraints. A scoping study is conducted under the constraints of using fuel with cylindrical geometry, traditional materials and enrichments below 5 % to enhance its licensability. The reactor vessel diameter is limited to the largest proposed thus far. The BWR with High power Density (BWR-HD) is found to have a power level of 5000 MWth, equivalent to 26 % uprated ABWR, resulting into 20 % cheaper O&M and Capital costs. This is achieved by utilizing the same number of assemblies, but with wider 16 x 1 6 assemblies and 50 % shorter active fuel than that of the ABWR. The fuel rod diameter and pitch are reduced to just over 45 % of the ABWR values. Traditional cruciform form control rods are used, which restricts the assembly span to less than 1. 2 times the current GE 14 design due to limitation on shutdown margin. Thus, it is possible to increase the power density and specific power by 65 %, while maintaining the nominal ABWR Minimum Critical Power Ratio (MCPR) margin. The optimum core pressure {{is the same as the}} current 7. 1 MPa. The core exit quality is increased to 19 % from the ABWR nominal exit quality of 15 %. The pin linear heat generation rate is 20 % lower, and the core pressure drop and mass of uranium are 30 % lower. The BWR-HD's fuel, modelled with FRAPCON 3. 4, showed similar performance to the ABWR pin design. The fuel cycle is only 12 month long, but on the per kWhr, the new design operates with 14 % lower fuel cycle front-end costs and similar total fuel cycle cost to the 18 month ABWR fuel cycle. The plant systems outside the vessel are assumed to be the same as the ABWR- 1 I design, utilizing a combination of active and passive safety systems. Safety analyses applied a void reactivity coefficient calculated by SIMULATE- 3 for an equilibrium cycle core that showed a 15 % less negative coefficient for the BWR-HD compared to the ABWR. The <b>feedwater</b> <b>temperature</b> was kept the same for the BWR-HD and ABWR which resulted in 4 °K cooler core inlet temperature for the BWR-HD given that its feedwater makes up a larger fraction of total core flow. The stability analysis using the STAB and S 3 K codes showed satisfactory results for the hot channel, coupled regional out-of-phase and coupled core-wide in-phase modes. A RELAP 5 model of the ABWR system was constructed and applied to six transients for the BWR-HD and ABWR. The AMCPRs during all the transients were found to be equal or less for the new design and the core remained covered for both. The lower void coefficient along with smaller core volume proved to be advantages for the simulated transients. Helical Cruciform Fuel (HCF) rods were proposed in prior MIT studies to enhance the fuel surface to volume ratio. In this work, higher fidelity models (e. g. CFD instead of subchannel methods for the hydraulic behaviour) are used to investigate the resolution needed for accurate assessment of the HCF design. For neutronics, conserving the fuel area of cylindrical rods results in a different reactivity level with a lower void coefficient for the HCF design. In single-phase flow, for which experimental results existed, the friction factor is found to be sensitive to HCF geometry and cannot be calculated using current empirical models. A new approach for analysis of flow crisis conditions for HCF rods in the context of Departure from Nucleate Boiling (DNB) and dryout using the two phase interface tracking method was proposed and initial results are presented. It is shown that the twist of the HCF rods promotes detachment of a vapour bubble along the elbows which indicates no possibility for an early DNB for the HCF rods and in fact a potential for a higher DNB heat flux. Under annular flow conditions, it was found that the twist suppressed the liquid film thickness on the HCF rods, at the locations of the highest heat flux, which increases the possibility of reaching early dryout. It was also shown that modeling the 3 D heat and stress distribution in the HCF rods is necessary for accurate steady state and transient analyses. The safety analysis of the 20 % uprated HCF design in the context of a BWR/ 4 RPV showed satisfactory AMCHFR performance only if CR is estimated by the EPRI- 1 correlation. by Koroush Shirvan.
