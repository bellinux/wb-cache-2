25|$|To {{construct}} a government, power will be balance and peer-reviewing <b>everything</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> core principle. Moreover, {{there will be}} separation of concerns and convention over configuration. For example, in United Kingdom, the Prime Minister leads the government {{with the support of}} the Cabinet and ministers. While departments and their agencies are responsible for putting government policy into practice and the public can engage with government through consultations and petitions to inform and influence the decisions it makes.|$|E

25|$|VLC, {{like most}} {{multimedia}} frameworks, {{has a very}} modular design which {{makes it easier to}} include modules/plugins for new file formats, codecs, interfaces, or streaming methods. VLC 1.0.0 has more than 380 modules. The VLC core creates its own graph of modules dynamically, depending on the situation: input protocol, input file format, input codec, video card capabilities and other parameters. In VLC, almost <b>everything</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> module, like interfaces, video and audio outputs, controls, scalers, codecs, and audio/video filters.|$|E

Delegates may vote differently from how their sending council might wish, but are mandated to communicate the wishes of their sending council. Delegates are recallable at any time. Referendums are possible at any time via votes of most lower-level councils, however, not <b>everything</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> referendum as this is most likely a waste of time.

25|$|Leah Chishugi, a {{survivor}} of the Rwandan genocide, traveled to the DRC. Upon discovering the mass rapes which were ongoing she began to document testimony from survivors. In a two-month period she interviewed up to 500 survivors of sexual assaults. The youngest victim was just one year old, and the eldest was 90 and one victim, aged 14, had already given birth twice, having been forcibly impregnated. Chishugi founded the charity <b>Everything</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> Benefit which campaigns {{on behalf of the}} survivors of the victims of rape and other human rights abuses during civil conflicts.|$|E

25|$|The power thus {{given to}} the {{commanding}} officer over all the people … is that of an absolute monarch … He alone is permitted to determine the rights of persons and property … It places at his free disposal all the lands and goods in his district, and he may distribute them without let or hindrance to whom he pleases. Being bound by no State law, and there being no other law to regulate the subject, he may make a criminal code of his own; and can make it as bloody as any in history … <b>Everything</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> crime which he chooses to call so, and all persons are condemned who he pronounces to be guilty.|$|E
500|$|Actress Anna Torv {{called the}} episode's hotel scene her {{favorite}} of the show so far, explaining [...] "I loved shooting that {{because it was the}} first time that Olivia really inched her way into that dynamic of Peter and Walter. She’s been kind of on the outside, and wrangling them constantly, but this gave me a glimpse into realizing <b>everything</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> little bit entwined, and building more of that emotional conflict between them. I really loved shooting that." ...|$|E
500|$|The book explores {{a tension}} between {{originality}} and monoculture {{by focusing on the}} artist's relationship with a commercialized world and its marketing of free art and consumer products. Critic Lisa Zeidner argues that the artist's [...] "loyalty and love" [...] involved with creating originality counters Bigend's assertion that <b>everything</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> reflection of something else and that the creative process no longer rests with the individual. Commercialism is portrayed as a monoculture that assimilates originality. The Tommy Hilfiger brand is used as an example, [...] "simulacra of simulacra of simulacra. A dilute tincture of Ralph Lauren, who had himself diluted the glory days of Brooks Brothers, who themselves had stepped on the product of Jermyn Street and Savile Row ... There must be some Tommy Hilfiger event horizon, beyond which it is impossible to be more derivative, more removed from the source, more devoid of soul." ...|$|E

5000|$|I find OOP {{technically}} unsound. It {{attempts to}} decompose {{the world in}} terms of interfaces that vary on a single type. To deal with the real problems you need multisorted algebras — families of interfaces that span multiple types. I find OOP philosophically unsound. It claims that <b>everything</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> object. Even if it is true it is not very interesting — saying that <b>everything</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> object <b>is</b> saying nothing at all.|$|R
500|$|When he was twenty, the National Post {{described}} Raonic as a [...] "hothead whose on-court demeanour {{was holding}} him back." [...] As he grew older, commentators {{came to see}} him as [...] "stoic", [...] "robotic", and [...] "emotionless", with The Daily Telegraph referring to him as [...] "an analytical character who questions everything he does in practice". In 2014, Raonic explained: [...] "I'm the son of two engineers, so <b>everything</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> numbers and calculation game." [...] In 2016, he added: [...] "I am very systematic in how [...] need to go about things to bring out the best tennis for myself, and maybe that comes off as mechanical and robotic and those kind of things, but I don't know if I'd ever change that because I feel that's the way I get the best out of myself when it comes to my tennis." ...|$|E
500|$|Cooder's displeasure {{with the}} Republican Party and its {{financial}} supporters, particularly the Koch Brothers, also inspired his songwriting. He found {{the party to}} be [...] "insanely dangerous" [...] to Barack Obama's presidency and the US, and said of them in an interview for The Guardian, [...] "in case anybody thinks Michele Bachmann or Sarah Palin are clowns because they misspeak or don't know their history or they say silly things: that's just an act, and it's a useful act. <b>Everything</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> distraction from the core truths which are, first of all, that corporations have taken over the country." [...] He viewed that his songs for the album provide a more convenient alternative for citizens who do not research politicians, saying that [...] "I don't write books and give speeches but with a four-minute song you can use allegory and other means to suggest {{a different point of}} view. It's like looking around the corner, and that's what songs are good at sometimes. They hit you with a new thought – assuming that people will listen." ...|$|E

2500|$|It is a game, <b>{{everything}}</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> game. When {{all four}} of them are lying on the ground, that cannot be handled naturalistically. That has got to be done artificially, balletically. Otherwise everything becomes an imitation, an imitation of reality [...] It should become clear and transparent, not dry. It is a game in order to survive." ...|$|E
2500|$|In Spinozism, {{the concept}} of a {{personal}} relationship with God comes from the position that one is a part of an infinite interdependent [...] "organism". Spinoza argued that <b>everything</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> derivative of God, interconnected with all of existence. [...] Although humans only experience thought and extension, what happens to one aspect of existence will still affect others. Thus, Spinozism teaches a form of determinism and ecology and supports this as a basis for morality.|$|E

But <b>everything</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> tradeoff – we also do not have the funding infrastructure these traditional institutions have, and {{over the past few years}} I’ve frankly exhausted my imagination in searching for new realistic sources of funding for IMSLP.|$|E

2500|$|Mereology {{has been}} {{explored}} {{in various ways}} as applications of predicate logic to formal ontology, in each of which mereology is an important part. Each of these fields provides its own axiomatic definition of mereology. A common element of such axiomatizations is the assumption, shared with inclusion, that the part-whole relation orders its universe, meaning that <b>everything</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> part of itself (reflexivity), that {{a part of a}} part of a whole is itself a part of that whole (transitivity), and that two distinct entities cannot each {{be a part of the}} other (antisymmetry), thus forming a poset. [...] A variant of this axiomatization denies that anything is ever part of itself (irreflexivity) while accepting transitivity, from which antisymmetry follows automatically.|$|E
2500|$|According to Stephen Laumakis, pratītyasamutpāda {{is also an}} {{epistemological}} principle; that is, {{a theory}} about how we gain correct and incorrect knowledge about being, becoming, existence and reality. The 'dependent origination' doctrine, states Peter Harvey, [...] "highlights the Buddhist notion that all apparently substantial entities within the world are in fact wrongly perceived. We live under the illusion that terms such as 'I', [...] self, mountain, tree, etc. denote permanent and stable things. The doctrine teaches this is not so." [...] There is nothing permanent (anicca), nothing substantial, no unique individual self {{in the nature of}} becoming and existence (anatta), because <b>everything</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> result of [...] "dependent origination". There are no independent objects and independent subjects, according to the Pratītyasamutpāda doctrine, there is fundamental emptiness in all phenomena and experiences.|$|E
2500|$|Under the tutorship {{lessons of}} modernist artist, Dorrit Black, Smart acquainted {{himself with the}} 'Golden Mean.' Also {{referred}} to as 'the golden ratio', 'the divine proportion', 'the mean of Phidias' {{and a number of}} other names, it has been used since ancient Greek times in many works of art and architecture. The golden mean is a geometric proportion, the ratio of which is approximately 1:1.618. This complex network of interlocking rectangles, triangles and diagonal lines, is used to calculate the structure of Smart's paintings, which form the basis of all his artworks. For Smart, geometry and precision of the composition is the key to successful art, much like how comedic timing is the key to the effectiveness of a punch line. [...] "Today's most prevalent myth is that Smart's work has no content: that <b>everything</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> compositional exercise devoted to capturing a formal ideal of beauty".|$|E
