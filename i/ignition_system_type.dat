40|$|There {{are over}} 7 million {{gas-fired}} fireplaces currently installed in US households. On an annual basis, these use substantial energy. However, {{the details of}} the fireplace energy use and the factors that influence it are currently not well understood. Fireplaces are a type of hearth product, which is a product category that primarily consists of fireplaces, stoves, and gas log sets. For the purpose of this study, the fuels used in hearth products are primarily natural gas, propane, or electricity. They may be vented or unvented. This study reports the results of a web survey of 2, 100 respondents in the United States performed in February 2016. The responses were cleaned and weighted using the raking method to form a nationally representative population. The reported data include hearth product characteristics, usage information, and repair and maintenance practices. The hearth product characteristics include the hearth product type, fuel type, <b>ignition</b> <b>system</b> <b>type,</b> features, venting, and installation details. The usage information includes seasonal usage of the main burner and standing pilot (if present), daily usage, and the primary utility (whether decorative or for heating). These raw data are further processed and combined with values from the literature to estimate the annual operating hours and energy use and to assess how these are impacted by the hearth product type, features, age, and the main heating appliance, if present. Based on the survey responses, the estimated average annual hours of usage was 234 for the main burner, and 4, 593 for the standing pilot. The results presented provide the most comprehensive data regarding hearth products in the United States published to date. These new data allow for an improved understanding of hearth products’ energy use, which in turn may facilitate the development of more informed analyses, and ultimately more efficient hearth products and reduced energy use. These new data also provide insight into topics not previously studied, such as the effect of hearth product features on energy use...|$|E

50|$|There {{are many}} factors that {{influence}} proper ignition timing for a given engine.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} an experimental investigation into <b>ignition</b> <b>systems,</b> {{their effects on}} the combustion process, and how the discharge {{is affected by the}} prevailing pressure, temperature and flow. The work is divided into four main areas, a comprehensive literature review, engine testing for <b>ignition</b> <b>system</b> suitability, non-flow rig testing (including erosion) and flow rig testing. The literature review concluded that the most practical <b>ignition</b> <b>system</b> for lean burn gas engines will continue {{to be based on the}} spark plug, but in the medium to long term, laser ignition may become viable. The measurement of the HT voltage and current is not straightforward, and appropriate methods have been identified. Capacitive and inductive <b>ignition</b> <b>system</b> <b>types</b> were compared in lean and diluted conditions on a single cylinder research engine of modern design at different engine loads and speeds. It was found that the most beneficial <b>ignition</b> <b>system</b> was an inductive <b>ignition</b> <b>system,</b> although that for some conditions, capacitive systems induced better engine performance with a fraction of the stored energy of the inductive alternative. Non flow tests showed that the early part of the spark discharge is sensitive to pressure and temperature effects, and as a consequence, the latter stages of the discharge are also affected. A correlation has been developed, for use with conventional nickel electrode spark plugs, to predict breakdown voltage as a function of pressure, temperature and gap. Experiments were carried out at elevated pressures in a stream of flowing air with capacitive and inductive <b>ignition</b> <b>systems.</b> Different electrode designs and orientations were also compared. It was shown that when exposed to a flow field, the discharge can be stretched which results in a shortened spark duration; in some cases the electrode can shield the discharge from flow field effects. This work showed that flow through the spark gap is a hindrance to the spark process, especially for longer duration systems. However for flame kernel growth, the literature review identified that flow is beneficial, serving to convect the kernel away from the electrodes, reducing the heat transfer from the flame. Analysis of the glow voltage history in the pressurised flow rig has been used to develop a correlation relating the voltage, current, flow velocity, pressure and time. This correlation was used to analyse the velocity records from the spark plug in a firing engine. The predicted velocities and turbulence intensity were in agreement with independent measurements.

50|$|The {{choice in}} HEI <b>system</b> <b>type</b> is vitally {{important}} based on the engine {{it will be used}} with. Each GM division had its own engine design. Thus, a Chevrolet ignition may not be identical to an Oldsmobile, Pontiac, Buick, or Cadillac engine. Typically, the <b>ignition</b> <b>system</b> compatibility followed the engine size. Most GM engines (of the same size) between 1974 and 1988 used a similar distributor <b>ignition</b> <b>system.</b> The module <b>type</b> is important as well. For non-computer controlled carburetor engines, the 4-pin unit is used since it uses mechanical timing controls (vacuum and centrifugal advance). The 5-pin module is like the 4-pin, with an added knock/detonation sensor input to the module so the ignition could be deliberately retarded and the power output dropped to the spark plug to aid disruption of the knock condition. The 7-pin module is designed for computer timing controls. It incorporates 2 magnetic signals from the pickup sensor, and 3 signals shared with the ECM engine control module), while the remaining 2 pins provide signal and power to the coil. Normally the 7 pin is not used on non-computerized engines since it does not contain mechanical timing controls, but some early designs used a seven-pin distributor module in conjunction with mechanical and vacuum advance in the distributor body, so the seven-pin module would be backward compatible.|$|R

2500|$|Ballast {{was also}} a {{component}} used in early model automobiles engine [...] that lowered the supply voltage to the <b>ignition</b> <b>system</b> after the engine had been started.

But once the vehicle was started and the starter disengaged, the normal operating voltage was too high for the <b>ignition</b> <b>system.</b> To avoid this problem, a ballast resistor was inserted in series with the <b>ignition</b> <b>system,</b> resulting in two different operating voltages for the starting and <b>ignition</b> <b>systems.</b>|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} study {{was done to}} examine the effects of elevated initial tube pressure in the Pulse Detonation Engine (PDE). Measured parameters were the ignition time, deflagration to detonation transition (DDT) run-up distance, DDT times, and Chapman-Jouguet (C-J) velocity. Mixed with air, three fuels, i. e., aviation gasoline, ethylene, and hydrogen, were tested at various initial pressures and equivalence ratios. An aftermarket automotive <b>ignition</b> <b>system</b> was employed, along with two plasma <b>ignition</b> <b>systems</b> to quantify the benefits of each. Measured results show a reduction in the ignition time of roughly 50 % and in the DDT distance of roughly 30 %, for all three fuels at an initial tube pressure of 3 atmospheres.
