40|$|The article {{highlights}} {{results of}} research over simulative apomixes in pear and its utilization for obtaining haploids and homozygote diploids. It {{has been established}} that over 50 % pear varieties with failed remote hybridization are capable of generating seeds of apomictic origin producing diploid plants. Genotypes displaying maximal inclination to apomixes have been singled out. Apomictic pear seedlings obtained from <b>foreign</b> <b>pollination</b> {{within the limits of}} the same combination are inherent in profound morphological diversity. Fruit-bearing apomicts originated from one and the same maternal plant differ to the same extent as hybrid seedlings of the same family. Genetic markers have enabled to establish that these are embryo sacs in which meiosis has completed that give rise to apomictic seeds. In vitro method as used for the purpose of increasing apomictic plants output has been illustrated. The greatest induction of apomictic shoots in vitro has been reached by alternation of BAP cytokinin at concentration of 1 mg/l and 2 mg/l on the background of GA 3 amounting to 1, 5 mg/l. Grafting with shoots in vitro on non-sterile rootstocks of pear (Pyrus communis) has increased the output of plants up to 80 %. A cytological assessment of 9 apomictic samples is provided. The cytological analysis of samples of apomictic forms has certified the presence of simulative haploid parthenogenesis in pear...|$|E
40|$|The {{introduction}} {{of genetically modified}} (GM) crops in the EU has raised questions concerning gene dispersal and co-existence with non-GM farming. Quantitative estimates of the gene dispersal from fields with GM crops to fields with conspecific non-GM crops (conventional or organic) are therefore {{needed in order to}} suggest isolation distances and other management strategies to keep GM-pollination below acceptable threshold values. A meta-analysis of available gene-flow data for oilseed rape (Brassica napus) was performed. The probability distribution that seeds of non-GM oilseed rape are fertilised by foreign pollen grains from a neighbouring field of GM oilseed rape is modelled as functions of the width of the recipient (i. e. pollen receiving) field and the distance to the pollen donor fields. Furthermore, the significance of using a buffer zone (removal of a 1 - 5 m border of a recipient field parallel to the pollen donor field) to reduce GM-pollination of the crop, is quantified and discussed. The predicted median and 95 % credibility level of the probability of <b>foreign</b> <b>pollination</b> is calculated {{as a function of the}} width of the recipient field and the buffer zone, as well as the distance between fields. Analysis of different management strategies shows that an increasing isolation distance is more effective to reduce GM pollen dispersal than the use of a buffer zone, especially for small recipient fields. The analysis shows that increasing the width of a recipient oilseed rape field, relative to the pollen donor field, will have a large effect on reducing the average level of fertilisation by foreign pollen within the recipient field. The results indicate that a GM-pollination percentage < 0. 1 % will be possible if the isolation distance exceeds 100 m and the width of the non-GM field is larger than 200 m. If a threshold value of 0. 3 % is acceptable, an isolation distance of 50 m should be sufficient even for smaller fields. The use of a 5 m discarded buffer zone surrounding the non-GM field is expected to reduce GM pollination by about a third. The implications of the results for field management in conventional and organic farming are discussed...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Competition for {{pollination}} {{can be an}} impor-tant {{factor in}} plant reproduction, but {{little attention has been}} given to the effect of the growing number of inva-sive plant species on pollination of native species. As a first step in understanding this threat, we used hand pol-lination to investigate the effects of pollen from an inva-sive species (Lythrum salicaria) on seed set in a sympa-tric and co-flowering native congener (L. alatum). Dis-persal of fluorescent dyes in the field confirms that polli-nators (bumble bees and honey bees) transfer pollen be-tween species. To determine the potential effect of such interspecific pollen transfer on seed set of the native, we pollinated 773 flowers on 20 plants with one of three treatments: legitimate conspecific pollen, a mixture of conspecific and foreign pollen, and foreign pollen. The mixed-pollen treatment resulted in 28. 8 % lower seed set relative to conspecific <b>pollination.</b> <b>Foreign</b> crosses re-sulted in extremely low seed set. Observations of pollen germination indicate that events at the stigmatic surface contribute to the reduction in seed set for mixed pollina-tion. Our results indicate that the impacts of invasive species may extend beyond vegetative competition to in-clude competition for pollination...|$|R
