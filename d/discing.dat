50|$|Just before {{cover crops}} are killed (by such {{practices}} including mowing, tilling, <b>discing,</b> rolling, or herbicide application) they contain {{a large amount}} of moisture.

In agroecosystems where water for crop production is in short supply, cover crops {{can be used as a}} mulch to conserve water by shading and cooling the soil surface. This reduces evaporation of soil moisture. In other situations farmers try to dry the soil out as quickly as possible going into the planting season.

50|$|Mechanical {{control of}} Christmas berry is a challenge. Useful methods include hand-pulling {{in the case}} of {{small-scale}} invasions. This is not a very efficient method due to the difficulty of eliminating all the surrounding berries littering the ground that will soon replace the removed material.

This must be carefully administered to prevent harm of the surrounding local flora and ensuring that the rhizomes are subdued.

40|$|Core <b>discing</b> {{is common}} in gas wells in the Cooper Basin, central Australia. The {{occurrence}} of <b>discing</b> {{is consistent with the}} high in situ horizontal stresses that prevail in the basin. Thin sections in intervals of disced core reveal the occurrence of pre–existing, clay–filled, horizontal tensile microfractures in the same interval. This association implies that, although <b>discing</b> is a drilling–induced phenomenon in a high in situ stress environment, it utilizes pre–existing weaknesses presented by the microfractures. The development of the horizontal, tensile microfractures suggests that the basin must have been subject to a reverse fault stress state consistent with observed Tertiary thrusting. Indeed, regions exhibiting the greatest amount of Tertiary exhumation are most prone to horizontal microfracturing and associated core <b>discing.</b> Microfracture development is interpreted to be due to stress concentrations at grain contacts and microfractures are most prevalent in fine–to medium–grained, well–sorted sandstones. The presence of horizontal microfractures can complicate hydraulic fracture stimulations in the area. Hence an understanding of the origin of and controls on these fractures has a profound influence on strategies for well completions during field development. Together, grain size and amount of exhumation can be used as key criteria to successfully predict the occurrence of horizontal microfractures in sandstone reservoirs...|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} confirm the stress state of the region where seismic {{activities}} are low, the stress measurement by the hydrofracturing method was performed in Okayama city drilling a 200 m deep vertical borehole. The measuring site consists of the homogeneous rock bed of the Mannari granite of the Late Cretaceous. The boring core looks almost homogenous for all 200 m long, however, cracks and Aplite dyke are observed at places. Especially, deeper than 175 m were seen <b>discing</b> phenomena.

Magnitude of the maximum and the minimum principal stresses in the horizontal plane show approximately the equal increasing rate with that of the West Japan standard stress gradient up to 90 m deep, however, between 90 m to 170 m deep, the stresses decrease to show almost lithostatic state, and then, from 175 m below, they increase very rapidly.

40|$|Abstract. The Magnetic Cataclysmic Variables (MCVs) {{are close}} {{interacting}} binaries where mass {{is transferred from}} a late type secondary star to a magnetic white dwarf. Two modes of accretion can be identified depending {{on the strength of}} the magnetic field, the mass transfer rate and orbital parameters. (a) <b>Disced</b> Accretion: In the Intermediate polars (IPs), the mass transfer stream circularises and forms an accretion disc. Material couples on to field lines in a narrow inner transition region where the velocity in the orbital plane changes from Keplerian to co-rotation (b) Discless Accretion: In the polars, the accretion stream is disrupted by the magnetic field before it can circularise. Material couples on to field lines via an inner transition region where the velocity changes from essentially free fall to co-rotation. The polars have no counterparts in neutron star systems and their study provides unique insights into the complex nature of the magnetospheric boundary. The observed prop-erties of accretion shocks at the white dwarf surface such as the anomalous soft-X-ray excess and its time variability provide strong support for the hypothesis that under certain circumstances the field channelled funnel flow is "blobby". This has been attributed to in-terchange instabilities such as the Magnetic Rayleigh-Taylor instability in the shocked gas at the stream-magnetosphere boundary where the stream fragments into discrete clumps of gas. As the clumps penetrate into the magnetosphere, they are shredded into smaller mass blobs via the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability that then couple on to field lines over an extended inner transition region in the orbital plane. The more massive blobs penetrate deep into the photosphere of the white dwarf releasing their energy as a reprocessed soft-X-ray black body component. Although similar instabilities are expected in the inner transition region in <b>disced</b> accretion albeit on a different scale there has been no direct observational evidence for blobby accretion in the generally lower field and <b>disced</b> IPs. ...|$|R
