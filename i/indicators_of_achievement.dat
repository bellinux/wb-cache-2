Numerous research studies have empirically examined the implications these “constructs ” have for understanding students’ performance in the classroom.

Recently, however, theorists have suggested that students might hold both mastery and performance goals and that both goals can be beneficial. This study compared the <b>achievement</b> patterns <b>of</b> students who held both goals simultaneously to students who held either mastery or performance goals only.
