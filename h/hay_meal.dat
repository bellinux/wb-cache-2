Now as {{to the nature of}} the taxes which provide for this debt, as well as for their ordinary establishments, the author has thought proper to affirm that [...] "they are comparatively light"; that [...] "she has mortgaged no such oppressive taxes as ours"; his effrontery on this head is intolerable. Does the author recollect a single tax in England to which something parallel in nature, and as heavy in burden, does not exist in France; does he not know that the lands of the noblesse are still under the load of the greater part of the old feudal charges, from which the gentry of England have been relieved for upwards of a hundred years, and which were in kind, as well as burden, much worse than our modern land-tax? Besides that all the gentry of France serve in the army on very slender pay, and to the utter ruin of their fortunes, all those who are not noble have their lands heavily taxed. Does he not know that wine, brandy, soap, candles, leather, saltpetre, gunpowder, are taxed in France? Has he not heard that government in France has made a monopoly of that great article of salt? that they compel the people to take a certain quantity of it, and at a certain rate, both rate and quantity fixed at the arbitrary pleasure of the imposer?[66] that they pay in France the Taille, an arbitrary imposition on presumed property? that a tax is laid in fact and name, on the same arbitrary standard, upon the acquisitions of their industry? and that in France a heavy capitation-tax is also paid, from the highest to the very poorest sort of people? Have we taxes of such weight, or anything at all of the compulsion, in the article of salt? do we pay any taillage, any faculty-tax, any industry-tax? do we pay any capitation-tax whatsoever? I believe the people of London would fall into an agony to hear of such taxes proposed upon them as are paid at Paris. There is not a single article of provision for man or beast which enters that great city, and is not excised; corn, <b>hay,</b> <b>meal,</b> butcher's-meat, fish, fowls, everything. I do not here mean to censure the policy of taxes laid on the consumption of great luxurious cities. I only state the fact. We should be with difficulty brought to hear of a tax of 50s. upon every ox sold in Smithfield. Yet this tax is paid in Paris. Wine, the lower sort of wine, little better than English small beer, pays 2d. a bottle.|$|E

40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. May 2014. Major: Animal sciences. Advisor: Krishona L. Martinson, PhD. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); vi, 70 pages. Horses {{have evolved to}} be hindgut fermenters, requiring small amounts of forage to be consumed throughout the day [1]. However, due to the recent increase in equine obesity [2 - 4], it has become necessary to restrict the amount of feedstuffs a horse consumes, often resulting in a restriction of forage intakes. In order to maintain a healthy gastrointestinal system, management strategies should attempt to replicate a horse's natural foraging habits. The objectives of the following studies were: 1) to investigate the effectiveness of decreasing pasture forage intakes via use of a grazing muzzle, and whether the effectiveness could be altered by grass morphology and palatability, 2) to investigate the effectiveness of "slow-feed hay nets" at increasing time to consumption of a preserved forage meal in stalled horses and 3) to observe the effects of increased time to consumption of daily rations on the post-prandial metabolic response. To determine objective 1, a two-year study was designed where four horses were used in a Latin square design in Year 1, while 3 horses were used in a completely randomized design in Year 2. Horses were grazed for 4 hours on monoculture plots four days per month for four months. Initial herbage mass and residual herbage mass measurements were taken to determine forage intakes. For objective 2, 8 horses were used in a replicated Latin square design, with 2 horses assigned to a treatment at a time. There was a control (C) of feeding hay on the ground, as well as three treatments: small-opening net (SN), medium-opening net (MN) and large-opening net (LN). Horses were allowed 4 h to consume their <b>hay</b> <b>meal.</b> Time to consumption and dry matter intake rate were measured using a stopwatch and any orts remaining after the 4 h were collected and weighed. To estimate objective 3, 8 overweight horses were enrolled in a randomized complete block design. Horses were blocked by bodyweight, BCS, and gender. Horses were fed a control diet of hay at 2 % BW {{for a period of}} 10 days, and were then switched to a restricted diet of hay fed at 1. 08 % and ration balancer fed once daily at a rate of 0. 001 % BW. Horses were assigned to one of two treatments: hay fed off the floor (FLOOR) and hay fed in a small-opening hay net (HN). Serial 24 h blood samples were taken on day 0, when horses were still on baseline diet, as well as days 14 and 28. Plasma glucose, insulin, cortisol, and leptin values were estimated. Results of objective 1 found that grazing muzzles were effective at decreasing pasture intakes by 30 % (P < 0. 0001). Species had no effect on intakes in Year 1 (P = 0. 27), but did impact intakes in Year 2 (P = 0. 042). Results of objective 2 found that SN and MN were effective at increasing total time to consumption (P < 0. 0001) compared to horses on the control and LN, more closely mimicking a horses' natural foraging behavior. Results of objective 3 found that hay nets decreased overall stress of horses on a restricted diet (P < 0. 05), however length of sampling and weight loss had a larger impact on post-prandial metabolite. Horses on day 28 of the trial had higher average glucose, insulin and cortisol values, as well as lower AUC cortisol. Increasing time to consumption of forages is a healthy method of decreasing body weight while maintaining healthy post-prandial metabolite values...|$|E

In this in vitro study, a significant influence of rumen inoculum (buffalo vs. cow) on fermentation and degradability of the examined substrates was found. The differences in buffalo and cattle rumen fermentation can be explained with a different microbial activity of the two ruminant species, because of different amount of microbial population or microbial population constituted by different species of bacteria and protozoa...|$|R

40|$|THE {{importance}} of alfalfa meal {{as a source}} of vitamin A in animal nutri-tion makes it imperative to know under what conditions of storage the vitamin A activity in the meal may best be main-tained. Since the vitamin A activity of plant tissue is largely, if not wholly, based on its carotene content, the loss of vitamin A potency during storage can be measured by means of carotene determinations. Several investigators have reported on the stability of carotene in plant tissues. Russell, Taylor, and Chichester (1934) found no loss of carotene in finely ground alfalfa stored for two to three months in vacuo at 0 ° ± S°C.

The infusion of pro-pionate increased its ruminal molar percentage from 19 (C, M 7) to 32 % (P 1, P 7). Ruminal pH, osmolality, ammonia concentration, and protozoa counting were not or were poorly affected by the treatments.

40|$|SUMMARY 	Three {{trials were}} {{conducted}} to investigate the intake of oven-dried gliricidia by sheep, namely trial 1, addition of polyethylene glycol (PEG), trial 2, pretreatments, and trial 3 addition of additives. In the first trial, six rumen fistulated sheep were used to compare two dietary treatments in a change over design to study whether infusion of polyethelene glycol (PEG) into the rumen might increase intakes of gliricidia leaf as tannin in the leaf was believed to limit its intake. In the second trial, four sheep were used to compare four dietary treatments in a latin square design to study whether reheating or freezing the already oven-dried gliricidia leaf might increase its intake by the animals. On the other hand, the third trial was aimed to supplement the sheep with various supplements which {{are believed to be}} able to increase the taste of the leaf by the animals. These supplements were wheat millrun, molases, grass <b>hay,</b> cottonseed <b>meal,</b> palm kernel meal, or barley grain. For this reason, ten sheep were used to compare seven dietary treatments in a randomised complete block design. Differences between means were examined by analysis of variance using the General Linear Model procedure of the Statistical Analysis System. The results showed that neither administration of PEG into the rumen nor pretreatments (reheating or freezing) increased intake of gliricidia leaf by sheep. However, only mixing gliricidia with molasses increased the intake of the leaf by sheep over the control diet (gliricidia alone) over the six hours feeding period (43 vs 74 g DM) ...|$|R
40|$|Aim. One of drought-resistant {{crops that}} can provide stable high yields is sorghum, which is salt-tolerant, {{heat-resistant}} and a flexible crop of versatile use (green forage, silage, <b>hay,</b> grass <b>meal,</b> grain forage). The research conducted in 2010 - 2013 included studies {{on the effectiveness of}} the methods and norms of sowing the sorghum, required quantities of mineral fertilizers to increase the crop yields and nutritional value of sorghum sown in the irrigated lowland areas of Dagestan. Methods. We conducted three field researches. In experiments with grain sorghum (the middle ripening group Zernogradskiy 88) we studied drill and broad-cast methods of sowing, seeding rate, the calculated doses of mineral fertilizers on programmable levels of crop yields: 6 t/ha (N 160 P 112 K 70), 7 t/ha (N 190 P 128 K 80) and 8 t/ha (N 220 P 144 K 90). Seeding rate was 300, 350 and 400 thousand viable seeds per 1 ha; broadcast was chosen as a sowing method. A field experiment with sweet sorghum included promising hybrid crop Debut, fertilizers N 140 P 80 K 70, N 190 P 110 K 95 and N 240 P 140 K 120 to obtain 60, 70 and 80 t/ha of green mass for two mowings, respectively. Results. The use of fertilizers based on a given level of productivity at optimum plant population can significantly improve the nutritional regime of the soil during the growing season of the sweet sorghum and create optimal conditions for nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium security for the crops and thus obtain the planned crop yield. Conclusion. The fodder quality of sweet sorghum varies depending on the nutrient status of the soil and mowing time. </p...|$|R

Products were tested on four substrates: lucerne <b>hay,</b> soyabean <b>meal,</b> maize meal and a total mixed ration (TMR). Digestibility was determined at 4 and 24 h of fermentation. Both CIN and CIN-C increased NDFD 4 of lucerne and maize meal, and decreased NDFD 24 of soyabean meal; while CIN-C reduced NDF 24 of TMR and CIN reduced DMD of soyabean at both examined hours. CLO and EUG decreased the NDFD 24 of soyabean meal improving its DMD 24. Also initial DMD of lucerne was increased by both these factors. Only CLO reduced NDFD 24 of maize meal. Both THY and THY-C reduced DMD 4 of soyabean meal; however only THY-C improved NDF 4 of lucerne and reduced NDFD 24 of soyabean meal and TMR.

The feed contained about 121. 2 and 544. 98 g kg- 1 of crude protein and total digestible nutrients, respectively, and was composed of tifton grass <b>hay,</b> cornmeal, soybean <b>meal,</b> mesquite pod meal and mineral salt. The right half carcass of each animal was separated between the 5 th and 6 th ribs, in front and rear quarters, from which commercial cuts were obtained. There was no effect (p > 0. 05) as to the replacement of corn for mesquite pod meal on the weights and yields of front cuts (shoulder, brisket, chuck, hump and flanks) and rear cuts (tenderloin, shank, knuckle, thin flank, flat, eye round, rump tail, top side, cap of rump, rump, cut of rump, striploin, cap of cube roll). Mesquite pod meal can substitute cornmeal in 100 % in the concentrate without changes in weight and yield of the commercial front and rear cuts of male bovines of dairy origin...|$|R
40|$|Thirteen steers {{were used}} in a 4 13 {{incomplete}} Latin square to determine chemical composition and digestibility for 13 samples of tallgrass prairie hay. Hays were collected {{from a variety of}} locations in east-central Kansas and represented a wide array of harvest dates and storage conditions. Steers were fed prairie <b>hay</b> and soybean <b>meal</b> at 1. 5 % and. 2 % of body weight, respectively, to equalize intakes relative to body weight and prevent degradable intake protein (DIP) from limiting extent of digestion. Prairie hay samples were analyze d for N, ADIN, ADF, NDF, ADIA, monosaccharides (sugars), and alkali-labile phenolic acids (lignin components). The relationships of various forage chemical components to diet organic matter digestibility (OMD) were examined using simple, linear regression. There was a close relationship between OMD and ADF (r 2 =. 62; OMD =. 822 [ADF] + 96. 47). In addition, the ratio of xylose:glucose (r 2 =. 62; OMD = 41. 93 [X:G] + 94. 14) explained significant amounts of the variation in OMD. Defining the chemical composition of bluestem hay may be of value in predicting organic matter digestibility and, ultimately, energetic value...|$|R

Foram avaliadas as degradabilidades da matéria seca, fibra em detergente neutro do feno de coastcross e do farelo de trigo, matéria seca do milho em grãos moídos e do farelo de soja; digestibilidade com indicador (Cr 2 O 3). Os animais foram delineados em dois quadrados latinos (4 x 4) com arranjo fatorial 4 x 2, sendo quatro níveis crescentes de FDN na MS (54, 60, 66 e 72 %) e duas espécies (bubalinos e bovinos). Cada subperíodo compreendeu 29 dias, sendo 13 de adaptação. Os bubalinos apresentaram maior desaparecimento ruminal da MS e FDN do feno de coastcross e da MS do farelo de soja que os bovinos, na maioria dos tempos de incubação. Por outro lado, o desaparecimento ruminal da FDN do farelo de trigo foi maior para os bovinos, somente nas primeiras horas. Para o coeficiente de digestibilidade da MS, houve interação de espécies com níveis de FDN. O coeficiente de digestibilidade da FDN foi influenciado pelos níveis de FDN e, para o coeficiente de digestibilidade da PB, não foram notados efeitos de espécies ou níveis de FDN. Four buffaloes {{and four}} cattle rumen fistulated were {{used with the}} {{objective}} to {{study the effects of}} different levels of neutral detergent fiber in the diet on the digestion characteristics. The In situ degradations of dry matter (DM), neutral detergent fiber (NDF) of the coastcross <b>hay</b> and wheat <b>meal,</b> DM of the corn ground and soybean meal were evaluated. The digestibilities of DM, crude protein and NDF of the diets were also evaluated using a Cr 2 O 3 as a marker. The animals were allotted to two in a 4 x 2 factorial arrangement with four increasing levels of NDF in the DM (54, 60, 66 and 72 %) and two animal species (buffaloes and cattle). Four twenty-nine days subperiods were used, with 13 days for diet adaptation. The buffaloes showed higher ruminal DM and NDF disappearance of the Coast-cross <b>hay</b> and soybean <b>meal</b> DM than cattle, in most of the incubation times. On the other hand, the ruminal NDF disappearance of wheat meal was higher for the cattle only in the first hours. There was interaction between species and NDF levels for the DM digestibility coefficients. The NDF levels influenced the NDF digestibility coefficient and it was not noticed effects of species or NDF levels for the CP digestibility coefficient...|$|R

For each feed 2 increasing dosages (0. 15 and 1. 5 mg/g of feed) of BHT and RCE and a Control (C) {{were tested in}} 4 replications and 2 incubations. First incubation lasted 72 h, the 2 (nd) one was stopped at the times on which half of GP was produced (t(1 / 2)), which were 9 and 16 h for corn and hay, respectively. From the supernatants of the 2 (nd) incubation, VFA, NH(3), N content of the residual NDF were analysed and the microbial N balance was computed. The 2 feeds significantly affected rumen fermentation parameters; BHT significantly increased asymptotic GP, t(1 / 2) and IVTOMD (P< 0. 01), decreased the proportion of butyrate (P< 0. 01) but did not affect microbial N balance; RCE did not influence any of the parameters measured with respect to C, except for a significant increase of the estimated N available for microbes at the higher dosag...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} digestibility and feeding behavior of Nellore heifers belonging to different classes of residual feed intake (RFI). Thirty-two heifers ranked high in RFI (0. 491 ± 0. 51 kg/d; n= 15) and RFI low (- 0. 447 ± 0. 51 kg/d; n= 17) with a mean age of 502 ± 23. 61 days and average weight 364 ± 27. 96 kg were kept in confinement for 48 days, with formulated diet based on Tifton 85 <b>hay,</b> corn, cottonseed <b>meal</b> and urea, and ratio of forage: concentrate ratio of 45 : 55 %. The parameters analyzed were digestibility, ingestive behavior and their correlation. Animals low RFI showed higher digestibility of dry matter (DMD), neutral detergent fiber (NDF), acid detergent fiber (ADF) and cellulose that high RFI animals (49. 14 % versus 45. 38 %, 56. 65 % versus 49. 88 %, 49. 96 % versus 45. 08 %, 61. 61 % versus 56. 40 % for DMD, NDFD, ADFD, CELD, respectively). These results indicate that more efficient animals have better food utilization. No differences were found in the variables of ingestive behavior among classes of RFI. Changes in the RFI can be partly explained by the digestibility of nutrients, which is related to ingestive behavior of animals. </p...|$|R
40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. December 2010. Major: Veterinary Medicine. Advisor: Stephanie J Valberg. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xx, 216 pages. Type 1 Polysaccharide Storage Myopathy (PSSM) is a heritable glycogen storage disease {{found in many}} breeds that is managed with low carbohydrate, high fat diet and regular exercise. The purpose of these studies was to better understand different modes of exercise and to further study dietary management of this disease. The central hypotheses of this thesis are: 1) Resistance training as provided by a water treadmill increases fitness parameters and metabolic properties of muscle tissue; 2) feeding forage with nonstructural carbohydrate (NSC) concentration > 11 % increases blood insulin and glucose concentrations compared to lesser NSC; 3) feeding a short odd carbon chain fat reduces muscle damage with exercise in PSSM horses. The first investigation examined the effect of resistance training via {{the use of a}} water treadmill. Healthy unfit horses performed a standardized exercise test on a conventional treadmill before and after training on an underwater treadmill for 4 weeks to measure relative fitness and the effect on muscle enzyme activities and metabolite and substrate concentrations found in gluteal and superficial digital flexor (SDF) tissue. No increase in fitness or difference in muscle enzyme activity, or concentrations of metabolite or substrates was detected with training. SDF had lower oxidative capacity and substrate concentrations when compared to gluteal tissue. iv The second investigation examined the effect of feeding hay with differing amounts of carbohydrate to healthy Quarter Horses (QH) and QH with PSSM. Hay with high and low NSC concentrations was fed to randomly assigned horses over a period of 5 days. The diets were then reversed after a 7 day washout in which medium NSC hay was fed. The insulinemic response to the high NSC forage diet were higher compared to the low NSC diet for both the control and PSSM horses. The third investigation studied the effect of feeding hay with differing amounts of carbohydrate to healthy QH and Thoroughbreds (TB). A baseline FSGIT was conducted on both groups, after which hay with different NSC concentrations was fed over a period of 5 days in a crossover block design similar to the previous study. FSGIT results showed that QHs were more insulin sensitive and had a faster rate of Sg (glucose mediated glucose disposal) than TB. QHs secreted more insulin in response to hay > 17 % NSC than hays of lower NSC, and that QHs secreted more insulin than TBs in response to higher NSC <b>hay</b> <b>meals.</b> Of note, all QH were mares, all TB were geldings, so gender, along with breed differences, could be a factor in the results. The fourth investigation examined the effect of feeding odd carbon (C 7) short chain oil (triheptanoin) and other more conventional feeds to healthy and QH with PSSM with exercise. Both groups were fed isocaloric diets of triheptanoin (TH) and corn oil (CO) and exercised daily on a treadmill for 3 weeks, then performed a 15 min exercise test on the last day. These horses were also fed high carbohydrate and a commercial high fat diet. The high NSC and TH diets resulted in muscle damage with exercise indicated by plasma creatine kinase activity. The high NSC diet increased citrate and lactate concentrations compared to the other diets. The high fat and corn oil diets increased the amount of serum non-esterified fatty acids available. Long chain fat supplementation and consistent exercise remain the best choice for management of PSSM. In conclusion, resistance training as provided by water treadmill use following manufacturer‘s protocol for tendon rehabilitation did not produce an increase in cardiocirculatory fitness. Feeding hay with NSC of 17 % produced an increase in insulin secretion in normal horses compared with hay of lower NSC concentrations. There may be a difference in how TB and QH respond to a glucose challenge test, but the confounding factor of breed remains unexplored. Feeding an odd carbon short chain fat to type 1 PSSM horses increased muscle damage and exercise intolerance...|$|R
40|$|Continuing {{the work}} of this station in dairy lines, we grew cabbages, mangel wurzels, white flat turnips, and rutabagas, made com fodder and {{ensilage}} {{during the summer and}} fall of 1893, and fed them to twenty cows during the winter of 1893 - 4. The object in view was to get indications of the effect these feeds would have on milk giving and its quality, the grade of butter each would make in the creamery, and what the chemist might find from analyses in his laboratory, so that Iowa farmers might get suggestions regarding their relative value. The plan was to feed a uniform ration of <b>hay</b> and <b>meals</b> while cabbage, mangels and turnips were being tested, and get the effects of each, and when corn fodder and ensilage were being tested, to arrange meal rations to be fed with them, so as to get the effects of both in comparison with roots. Ten of the twenty cows were advanced in their periods of lactation; the average time they had been giving milk was 209 days. Their milking periods ended {{at the close of the}} experiment or soon after. Ten were fresh fall cows, and had been giving milk thirty-five days on an average. The ten fresh cows would have made the best showing, but would not have represented the average Iowa winter dairy herd. Eighteen were selected that could be milked from November 15 to February 19, and two that would be replaced during the experiment by two fresh cows. The trial lasted ninety-seven days; thirteen days were given to cabbage; twenty to mangels—first period; eighteen to turnips; eight to mangels—second period; seventeen to com fodder; and twenty-one to ensilage. The variation in time was controlled by the amount of the tested feeds on hand to some extent. The second period given to mangels was suggested by the sharp decline in per cents of fat from the turnips after feeding mangels, and the desire to ascertain whether the per cents of fat would advance if mangels were fed again, which will be discussed farther along...|$|R
40|$|We {{assessed}} {{the ability of}} rumen microbes to significantly incorporate propionate when they are subjected in vivo to no infusion, long-term infusion of minerals, and short- and long-term infusion of high amounts of propionate. Four ruminally cannulated sheep fed 1000 g <b>hay</b> (8 <b>meals</b> per d) were used in a 4 x 4 Latin square design. The treatments consisted of no infusion (C), ruminal infusion of propionate (86 g. d(- 1)) for 1 (P 1) and 7 d (P 7), and of minerals for 7 d (M 7). The infusion of propionate increased its ruminal molar percentage from 19 (C, M 7) to 32 % (P 1, P 7). Ruminal pH, osmolality, ammonia concentration, and protozoa counting were not or were poorly affected by the treatments. Rumen contents (100 mL liquid + 100 g solid) were incubated at 39 degreesC in anaerobic flasks containing artificial saliva, (NH 4) (2) SO 4, ground hay, and 0. 45 muCi[2 -C- 14] propionate. After 6 and 16 h, clarified fermenter fluid, liquid-associated protozoa, and liquid-associated bacteria considered as representative of total bacteria were separated by fractional centrifugations. Microbial pellets were washed with saline before C- 14 determination. In flasks, pH, osmolality, gas, volatile fatty acid (VFA) production, ammonia concentration, protozoal counting {{and the amount of}} C- 14 in clarified fermenter fluid, liquid-associated protozoa and liquid-associated bacteria were similar among the treatments. Between 6 h and 16 h, the amount of C- 14 decreased in the clarified fermenter fluid, and increased in liquid-associated protozoa and liquid-associated bacteria. The amount of estimated microbial DM was 11. 0 g per flask. After 6 h and 16 h incubation, the amount of C- 14 incorporated into microbial fractions averaged 9. 1 and 12. 2 % of the total amount of C- 14, and was estimated to account for 10. 3 % of propionate net production irrespective of the treatment and incubation time. It is concluded that the uptake of propionate by ruminal protozoa and bacteria is quantitatively significant, and may not be significantly affected when rumen microbes are submitted to minerals or propionate infusion. These results may explain the differences observed between the methods in the determination of the ruminal production rate of VFA...|$|R
