5|$|As part {{of their}} {{corporate}} philosophy, Linn intended significant dealer involvement in customer education and decision-making, and included teaching customers how to listen correctly for musical attributes. The trial and evaluation of the product prior to purchase and dealer's expert installation are considered by Linn to be <b>important</b> <b>parts</b> of the value added of their top-end products. As such, no instructions were supplied with the product. The Isobaric PMS retailed at £2,400 including stands in May 1991, and the 4-ohm crossover was priced at just under £500.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the points}} of {{interest}} of the English cathedrals {{is the way in}} which much of the history of medieval architecture can be demonstrated within a single building, which typically has <b>important</b> <b>parts</b> constructed in several different centuries with no attempt whatever to make the later work match or follow through on an earlier plan. For this reason a comprehensive architectural chronology must jump backwards and forwards from one building to another. Only at one building, Salisbury Cathedral, is stylistic unity demonstrated.|$|E

5|$|When {{hiding in}} the dark is a {{gameplay}} element, light and shadow become <b>important</b> <b>parts</b> of the level design. Usually the player is able to disable certain light sources. Stealth games also emphasize the audio design when players {{must be able to}} hear the subtle sound effects that may alert enemies to their actions; noise will often vary as the player walks on different surfaces such as wood or metal. Players who move recklessly will make more noise and attract more attention.|$|E
5|$|While {{there are}} earlier {{examples}} in the Republican period and early Imperial period, the growth of domed construction increased under Emperor Nero and the Flavians in the 1st century AD, and during the 2nd century. Centrally planned halls become increasingly <b>important</b> <b>parts</b> of palace and palace villa layouts beginning in the 1st century, serving as state banqueting halls, audience rooms, or throne rooms. Formwork was arranged either horizontally or radially, {{but there is not}} enough surviving evidence from the 1st and 2nd centuries to say what was typical.|$|E
5|$|Demosthenes {{tailored}} {{his style}} {{to be very}} audience-specific. He took pride in not relying on attractive words but rather simple, effective prose. He was mindful of his arrangement, he used clauses to create patterns that would make seemingly complex sentences easy for the hearer to follow. His tendency to focus on delivery promoted him to use repetition, this would ingrain the importance into the audience's minds; he also relied on speed and delay to create suspense and interest among the audience when presenting to most important aspects of his speech. One of his most effective skills was his ability to strike a balance: his works were complex so that the audience would not be offended by any elementary language, but the most <b>important</b> <b>parts</b> were clear and easily understood.|$|E

5|$|Diving {{medicine}} {{deals with}} medical research {{on issues of}} diving, the prevention of diving disorders, treatment of diving accident injuries and diving fitness. The field includes {{the effect on the}} human body of breathing gases and their contaminants under high pressure, and the relationship between the state of physical and psychological health of the diver and safety. In diving accidents it is common for multiple disorders to occur together and interact with each other, both causatively and as complications. Diving medicine is a branch of occupational medicine and sports medicine, and first aid and recognition of symptoms of diving disorders are <b>important</b> <b>parts</b> of diver education.|$|E
5|$|From 1933, {{the threat}} of Japanese {{invasion}} forced the evacuation of the most <b>important</b> <b>parts</b> of the Museum's collection. After the end of World War II, this collection was returned to Nanjing. However, with the Communists' victory imminent in the Chinese Civil War, the Nationalist government decided to ship the pick of this collection to Taiwan. Of the 13,491 boxes of evacuated artefacts, 2,972 boxes are now housed in the National Palace Museum in Taipei. More than 8,000 boxes were returned to Beijing, but 2,221 boxes remain today in storage under the charge of the Nanjing Museum.|$|E
5|$|Marco Antonio Barbaro, the Venetian bailo who {{had been}} imprisoned since 1570, {{conducted}} the negotiations. In view of the Republic's inability to regain Cyprus, the resulting treaty, signed on 7 March 1573, confirmed the new state of affairs: Cyprus became an Ottoman province, and Venice paid an indemnity of 300,000 ducats. In addition, {{the border between the}} two powers in Dalmatia was modified by the Turkish occupation of small but <b>important</b> <b>parts</b> of the hinterland that included the most fertile agricultural areas near the cities, with adverse effects on the economy of the Venetian cities in Dalmatia.|$|E

5|$|One {{important}} element {{for the formation}} of skeletal material in marine animals is calcium, but calcium carbonate becomes more soluble with pressure, so carbonate shells and skeletons dissolve below its compensation depth. Calcium carbonate also becomes more soluble at lower pH, so ocean acidification is likely to have profound effects on marine organisms with calcareous shells, such as oysters, clams, sea urchins, and corals, because their ability to form shells will be reduced, and the carbonate compensation depth will rise closer to the sea surface. Affected planktonic organisms will include the snail-like molluscs known as pteropods, and single-celled algae called coccolithophorids and foraminifera. All of these are <b>important</b> <b>parts</b> of the food chain and a diminution in their numbers will have significant consequences. In tropical regions, corals are likely to be severely affected as it becomes more difficult to build their calcium carbonate skeletons, in turn adversely impacting other reef dwellers.|$|E
5|$|The Decorated Gothic style, with traceried windows, {{is further}} {{subdivided}} dependent upon whether the tracery is Geometric or Curvilinear. Many cathedrals have <b>important</b> <b>parts</b> in the Geometric {{style of the}} mid 13th to early 14th centuries, including much of Lincoln, Lichfield, the choir of Ely and the chapter houses of Salisbury and Southwell. By the late 13th century the style of tracery evolved to include {{a greater number of}} narrow shapes that adapted easily to Gothic openings in combination with circular shapes {{as can be seen in}} the windows of the chapter house of York, the Octagon of Ely and the west window of Exeter.|$|E
5|$|In the 1860s Dublin {{received}} occasional {{visits from}} international stars, and Stanford {{was able to}} hear famous performers such as Joseph Joachim, Henri Vieuxtemps and Adelina Patti. The annual visit of the Italian Opera Company from London, led by Giulia Grisi, Giovanni Matteo Mario and later Thérèse Tietjens, gave Stanford a taste for opera that remained with him all his life. When he was ten, his parents took him to London for the summer, where he stayed with his mother's uncle in Mayfair. While there he took composition lessons from the composer and teacher Arthur O'Leary, and piano lessons from Ernst Pauer, professor of piano at the Royal Academy of Music (RAM). On his return to Dublin, his godmother having left Ireland, he took lessons from Henrietta Flynn, another former Leipzig Conservatory pupil of Moscheles, and later from Robert Stewart, organist of St Patrick's Cathedral, {{as well as from}} a third Moscheles pupil, Michael Quarry. During his second spell in London two years later, he met the composer Arthur Sullivan and the musical administrator and writer George Grove, who later played <b>important</b> <b>parts</b> in his career.|$|E

5|$|The nymph is the {{dominant}} life history stage of the mayfly. Different insect species vary in their tolerance to water pollution, but in general, the larval stages of mayflies, stoneflies (Plecoptera) and caddis flies (Trichoptera) are susceptible {{to a number of}} pollutants including sewage, pesticides and industrial effluent. In general, mayflies are particularly sensitive to acidification, but tolerances vary, and certain species are exceptionally tolerant to heavy metal contamination and to low pH levels. Ephemerellidae are among the most tolerant groups and Siphlonuridae and Caenidae the least. The adverse effects on the insects of pollution may be either lethal or sub-lethal, in the latter case resulting in altered enzyme function, poor growth, changed behaviour or lack of reproductive success. As <b>important</b> <b>parts</b> of the food chain, pollution can cause knock-on effects to other organisms; a dearth of herbivorous nymphs can cause overgrowth of algae, and a scarcity of predacious nymphs can result in an over-abundance of their prey species. Fish that feed on mayfly nymphs that have bioaccumulated heavy metals are themselves at risk. Adult female mayflies find water by detecting the polarization of reflected light. They are easily fooled by other polished surfaces which can act as traps for swarming mayflies.|$|E
