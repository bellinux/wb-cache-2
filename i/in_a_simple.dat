5|$|A {{problem with}} early bombsights {{was that they}} could only correct {{for the effects of}} the wind <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> way and {{required}} the bomber to fly directly up- or down-wind from the target, to minimise the complexity of the required calculations.

5|$|The {{genetic code}} is {{the set of}} rules by which {{information}} encoded within genetic material (DNA or mRNA sequences) is translated into proteins by living cells.

5|$|After {{three years}} of dating, they {{eventually}} decided to marry while discussing {{the issue in the}} couple's favorite booth at Chasen's, a restaurant in Beverly Hills. They married on March 4, 1952, at the Little Brown Church in the San Fernando Valley of Los Angeles, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> and hastily arranged ceremony designed to avoid the press. The only people in attendance were fellow actor William Holden (the best man) and his wife, actress Brenda Marshall (the matron of honor). Nancy was already pregnant during the ceremony; the couple's first child, Patricia Ann Reagan (later better known by her professional name, Patti Davis), was born less than eight months later on October 21, 1952. Their son, Ronald Prescott Reagan (later better known as Ron Reagan) was born six years later on May 20, 1958. Reagan also became stepmother to Maureen Reagan (1941–2001) and Michael Reagan (born 1945), the daughter and adopted son of her husband's first marriage to Jane Wyman.|$|E

5|$|DX arrays {{have been}} made to form hollow {{nanotubes}} 4–20nm in diameter, essentially two-dimensional lattices which curve back upon themselves. These DNA nanotubes are somewhat similar in size and shape to carbon nanotubes, and while they lack the electrical conductance of carbon nanotubes, DNA nanotubes are more easily modified and connected to other structures. One of many schemes for constructing DNA nanotubes uses a lattice of curved DX tiles that curls around itself and closes into a tube. In an alternative method that allows the circumference to be specified <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>simple,</b> modular fashion using single-stranded tiles, the rigidity of the tube is an emergent property.|$|E

On September 3, Smith and Castellano signed the agreed-upon text on behalf of Eisenhower and Pietro Badoglio, respectively, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> ceremony beneath an olive tree at Cassibile, Sicily.

5|$|In {{response}} to the financial crisis, Disney and his brother Roy started the company's first public stock offering in 1940, and implemented heavy salary cuts. The latter measure, and Disney's sometimes high-handed and insensitive manner of dealing with staff, led to a 1941 animators' strike which lasted five weeks. While a federal mediator from the National Labor Relations Board negotiated with the two sides, Disney accepted an offer from the Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs to make a goodwill trip to South America, ensuring he was absent during a resolution he knew would be unfavorable to the studio. As {{a result of the}} strikeand the financial state of the companyseveral animators left the studio, and Disney's relationship with other members of staff was permanently strained as a result. The strike temporarily interrupted the studio's next production, Dumbo (1941), which Disney produced <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> and inexpensive manner; the film received a positive reaction from audiences and critics alike.|$|E
5|$|La Masia is {{also the}} name of FC Barcelona's {{football}} training facilities, originally located near the Camp Nou in the Les Corts district of Barcelona. The original building itself was an ancient country residence (In Catalan: masia) built in 1702, and once Camp Nou was inaugurated in 1957, the building was remodelled and extended for use as the club's social headquarters. With the gradual expansion of the club, the building became too small for headquarters, and on 20 October 1979, La Masia was converted into a dormitory for young players from outside Barcelona. On 30 June 2011, the Masia building ceased housing the young sportsmen who are trained {{to become a part}} of the club’s professional teams. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> ceremony, the doors were closed and the Ciutat Esportiva Joan Gamper took over the function of the residential center for the youngsters.|$|E

5|$|Like {{the other}} {{characters}} of the series, Perry was structured <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> style to allow young viewers to easily draw him. In keeping with the show's general design scheme, Perry is constructed of geometric shapes in a style reminiscent of deceased Looney Tunes animator Tex Avery. Povenmire uses different design styles for drawing Perry depending on how he is portrayed. When Perry is portrayed as a domesticated and mindless pet, Povenmire begins with a square shaped like a loaf of bread. He then draws his front legs and feet before drawing his bill, which is set at a certain angle. Povenmire then draws his eyeballs, which are never focused and look in opposing directions in a daze. He concludes the figure by adding his hind legs, tail, hair, and finally color.|$|E
5|$|Professor Johannes Krahn, {{who built}} several churches and early skyscrapers {{such as the}} Beehive House in Frankfurt am Main, {{designed}} a space recalling elements of an early Romanesque Basilica. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> shape, a single long nave is concluded by a semicircle choir around the altar. On the right side the wall opens to a side chapel, reminiscent of a transept. The outer walls are sandstone, visible both inside and outside.

The building recalls the austere style of sacred architecture of the 1950s.|$|E
5|$|Syntax {{refers to}} {{patterns}} for combining {{words and phrases}} to make clauses and sentences. Verbal and nominal inflectional morphology are central to Ottawa syntax, as they mark grammatical information on verbs and nouns {{to a greater extent}} than in English (which has few inflections, and relies mainly on word order). Preferred word orders <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> transitive sentence are verb-initial, such as verb–object–subject (VOS) and VSO. While verb-final orders are avoided, all logically possible orders are attested. Ottawa word order displays considerably more freedom than is found in languages such as English, and word order frequently reflects discourse-based distinctions such as topic and focus.|$|E
