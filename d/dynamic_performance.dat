25|$|One {{distinctive}} {{advantage of}} PID controllers is that two PID controllers {{can be used}} together to yield better <b>dynamic</b> <b>performance.</b> This is called cascaded PID control. In cascade control there are two PIDs arranged with one PID controlling the setpoint of another. A PID controller acts as outer loop controller, which controls the primary physical parameter, such as fluid level or velocity. The other controller acts as inner loop controller, which reads the output of outer loop controller as setpoint, usually controlling a more rapid changing parameter, flowrate or acceleration. It can be mathematically proven that the working frequency of the controller is increased and the time constant of the object is reduced by using cascaded PID controllers..|$|E

2500|$|Mazda of Japan ceased {{production}} of direct drive Wankel engines within their model range in 2012, leaving the motor industry worldwide with no production cars using the engine. The company is continuing {{development of the}} next generation of their Wankel engines, the SkyActiv-R, with a new rear-wheel-drive sports car model announced in October 2015. The company later withdrew this proposed model. Mazda states that the SkyActiv-R solves the three key issues with previous rotary engines: fuel economy, emissions and reliability. Takashi Yamanouchi, the global CEO of Mazda said: [...] "The rotary engine has very good <b>dynamic</b> <b>performance,</b> but it's not so good on economy when you accelerate and decelerate. However, with a range extender you can use a rotary engine at a constant 2,000rpm, at its most efficient. It's compact, too." [...] No Wankel engine in this arrangement has yet been used in production vehicles or planes. However, in November 2013 Mazda announced to the motoring press a series-hybrid prototype car, the Mazda2 EV, using a Wankel engine as a range extender. The engine, located under the rear luggage floor, is a tiny, almost inaudible, single-rotor 330cc unit, generating [...] at 4,500rpm, and maintaining a continuous electric output of 20kW. In October 2017 Mazda announced that the rotary engine would be utilised in a hybrid car with 2019 the introduction date.|$|E
