5|$|Triturus {{included}} most European newt species {{until the}} end of the 20th century, but was substantially revised after it was shown to be polyphyletic. Three separate genera now accommodate former members of the genus: the small-bodied newts (Lissotriton), the banded newts (Ommatotriton), and the alpine newt (Ichthyosaura). The monophyly of the genus Triturus <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>strict</b> <b>sense</b> is supported by molecular data and synapomorphies such as a genetic defect causing 50% embryo mortality (see below, Egg deposition and development).|$|E
5|$|Eremoryzomys polius, {{also known}} as the gray rice rat or the Marañon oryzomys, is a rodent species in the tribe Oryzomyini of the family Cricetidae. Discovered in 1912 and first {{described}} in 1913 by Wilfred Osgood, it was originally placed in Oryzomys and named Oryzomys polius. In 2006, a cladistic analysis found that it was not closely related to Oryzomys <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>strict</b> <b>sense</b> or to any other oryzomyine then known, so that it is now placed in its own genus, Eremoryzomys. The Brazilian genus Drymoreomys, named in 2011, is probably the closest relative of Eremoryzomys. Eremoryzomys has a limited distribution in the dry upper valley of the Marañón River in central Peru, but may yet contain more than one species.|$|E
5|$|While The Legend of Korra was {{produced}} in the United States and therefore not a work of Japanese animation ("anime") <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>strict</b> <b>sense,</b> The Escapist magazine argued that the series is so strongly influenced by anime that it would otherwise easily be classified as such: its protagonists (a superpowered heroine, her group of talented, supporting friends, a near-impervious villain who wants to reshape the world), its themes (family, friendship, romance, fear, and death) {{and the quality of}} its voice acting as well as the visual style {{are similar to those of}} leading anime series such as , Bleach or Trigun. A notable difference from such series is the absence of lengthy opening and ending sequences set to J-pop songs; to save broadcast time, The Legend of Korras openings and endings last only a few seconds. The series mostly abstains from using the visual tropes characteristic of anime, but does occasionally use exaggerated facial expressions to highlight emotions for comic effect.|$|E

5|$|Studies of {{the ecology}} and {{genetics}} of Paxillus involutus {{indicate that it}} may form a complex of multiple similar-looking species. In a field study near Uppsala, Sweden, conducted from 1981 to 1983, mycologist Nils Fries {{found that there were}} three populations of P.involutus unable to breed with each other. One was found under conifers and mixed woodlands, while the other two were found in parklands, associated with nearby birch trees. He found that the first group tended to produce single isolated fruit bodies which had a thinner stipe and cap which was less inrolled at the margins, while the fruit bodies of the other two populations tended to appear in groups, and have thicker stipes, and caps with more inrolled and sometimes undulating margins. However, there were only general tendencies and he was unable to detect any consistent macroscopic or microscopic features that firmly differentiate them. A molecular study comparing the DNA sequences of specimens of Paxillus involutus collected from various habitats in Bavaria found that those collected from parks and gardens showed a close relationship with the North American species P.vernalis, while those from forests were allied with P.filamentosus. The authors suggested the park populations may have been introduced from North America. A multi-gene analysis of European isolates showed that P.involutus sensu lato (in the loose sense) could be separated into four distinct, genetically isolated lineages corresponding to P.obscurosporus, P.involutus sensu stricto (<b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>strict</b> <b>sense),</b> P.validus, and a fourth species that has not yet been identified. Changes in host range have occurred frequently and independently among strains within this species complex.|$|E

Fifteenth-century hose were often particolored, with each leg in a different-coloured fabric or even more than one colour on a leg. However, many types of braies, chausses and hose were not intended to be covered up by other clothing, so they were not actually underwear <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>strict</b> <b>sense.</b>|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} stages of the First Punic War (264 BC) the first known Roman gladiatorial munus was held, {{described}} as a funeral blood-rite to the manes of a Roman military aristocrat. The gladiator munus was never explicitly acknowledged as a human sacrifice, probably because death was not its inevitable outcome or purpose. Even so, the gladiators swore their lives to the infernal gods, and the combat was dedicated as an offering to the di manes or other gods. The event was therefore a sacrificium <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>strict</b> <b>sense</b> of the term, and Christian writers later condemned it as human sacrifice.|$|E
