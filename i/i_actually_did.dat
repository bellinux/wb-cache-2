500|$|Cagney was {{diagnosed}} with glaucoma and began taking eye drops, but continued to have vision problems. On Zimmermann's recommendation, he visited a different doctor, who determined that glaucoma had been a misdiagnosis, and that Cagney was actually diabetic. Zimmermann then took it upon herself to look after Cagney, preparing his meals to reduce his blood triglycerides, which had reached alarming levels. Such was her success that, by the time Cagney made a rare public appearance at his American Film Institute Lifetime Achievement award ceremony in 1974, he had lost [...] and his vision had improved. Charlton Heston opened the ceremony, and Frank Sinatra introduced Cagney. So many Hollywood stars attended—said {{to be more than}} for any event in history—that one columnist wrote at the time that a bomb in the dining room would have ended the movie industry. In his acceptance speech, Cagney lightly chastised the impressionist Frank Gorshin, saying, [...] "Oh, Frankie, just in passing, I never said 'MMMMmmmm, you dirty rat!' What <b>I</b> <b>actually</b> <b>did</b> say was 'Judy, Judy, Judy!'"—a joking reference to a similar misquotation attributed to Cary Grant.|$|E
500|$|Nirvana singer/guitarist Kurt Cobain {{described}} [...] "Lithium" [...] as [...] "one {{of those}} songs <b>I</b> <b>actually</b> <b>did</b> finish {{while trying to}} write it instead of taking pieces of my poetry and other things." [...] Nirvana recorded [...] "Lithium" [...] with producer Butch Vig at Smart Studios in Madison, Wisconsin during April 1990. The material recorded at Smart Studios was intended for the group's second album for the independent record label Sub Pop. The book Classic Rock Albums: Nevermind (1998) stated that observers considered the session for [...] "Lithium" [...] as a key event in the developing rift between Cobain and drummer Chad Channing. Cobain was dissatisfied with Channing's drumming as their musical styles were inconsistent. Cobain told Channing to perform the drum arrangement he had devised for the song. According to Vig, Cobain overexerted his voice while recording vocals for [...] "Lithium," [...] which forced the band to halt recording. The songs from these sessions were placed on a demo tape and circulated within the music industry, generating interest in the group among major record labels.|$|E

5000|$|Ph.D. Kirill Pankratov {{commented on}} the theory of Satter and Putley in the Johnson's Russia List: [...] "these {{allegations}} are not new, and were kept afloat {{for a long time}} already, mostly by people close to Berezovsky and his money. I know it is very hard for people like David Satter and Jeremy Putley to understand, but <b>I</b> <b>actually</b> <b>do</b> believe there aren’t many people in Russia willing to purposefully kill hundreds of their own citizens for some political cause." [...] In the letter Pankratov provided four reasons against that theory.|$|R

[...] "Well, <b>I</b> was <b>actually</b> {{brought up in}} a Christian household, so I have, you know, a pretty broad knowledge of it; and strayed from it for quite a while. And, now that I have children, <b>I</b> <b>actually</b> <b>do</b> go to church, so I've kinda sorta returned to it, you know?" [...] Ellefson further discussed his Chistianity in a 2010 interview on The Full Armor of God Broadcast explaining [...] "I've found that when you just suit up and show up and walk your talk instead of talking your talk all the time, that is often the best testimony!" ...|$|R
500|$|On January 31, 2010, Pink {{performed}} the song at the 52nd Grammy Awards {{in a similar}} fashion. She began the performance walking out in a white silk robe, {{standing in front of}} a backdrop of electric blue screens. She descenced into the aisle and took off the robe to reveal the bodysuit. After being lifted from the tank of water, Pink kept twirling and spreading water into all directions, before finally descending to the main stage. The audience greeted her with a standing ovation. The performance was deemed by various media outlets as the best of the ceremony. Glenn Gamboa of Newsday commented, [...] "With her stunning Grammy performance of 'Glitter in the Air,' Pink proved that you don’t have to be shocking or over-the-top to be the best or the most-talked-about. You just have to be amazing." [...] It was also voted on a readers' poll in MTV.com as the best performance of the night. Staff reporter Kyle Anderson said [...] "It's easy to see why, as her acrobatic performance of 'Glitter in the Air' was not only visually gorgeous, but also technically impressive — she was able to keep singing even as she was spinning around in the air". Pink later explained she had almost fallen during the song, saying, [...] "When I do it on tour, I don't have lights above me. There were lights above me, so it almost went into a strobe thing, and <b>I</b> <b>actually</b> <b>did</b> get a little turned around. I thought... I was going to fall on my nude butt. But I worked it out." [...] In 2013, Brad Wete for Billboard ranked the performance as the best performance at the Grammy Awards from 2000 to 2012, commenting it [...] "graceful, show-stopping performance of aerial, acrobatic and vocal brilliance." ...|$|E
2500|$|Following his {{departure}} from Guns N' Roses, according to Adler, {{he was set}} to join AC/DC and relocate to Australia. However, during the MTV Video Music Awards in September 1990, Axl Rose announced Adler's firing onstage and branded him a drug addict, which Adler said caused AC/DC's manager to withdraw their offer. Adler instead reformed Road Crew with a new line-up, consisting of former Vain members singer Davy Vain, guitarist Jamie Scott, and bassist Ashley Mitchell, along with guitarist Shawn Rorie. They recorded an album and attracted attention from a major label, but due to Adler's persistent drug problems, the group disbanded shortly thereafter. Adler then entered a prolonged, self-imposed exile from the music industry; he later recalled, [...] "I wish I could say that I {{did a lot of}} traveling or self-improvement, but all <b>I</b> <b>actually</b> <b>did</b> was sit on the couch and get high—while the TV watched me. It was a very, very hard time." ...|$|E

5000|$|I {{started in}} pop, then crossed over into country. And <b>I</b> <b>actually</b> <b>do</b> some swing music, {{so that was}} the first idea. The second ruling factor was when I went to these artists, I asked them if there were songs they liked that they had not had a chance to record. So that was interesting, to let the {{individual}} artist pick the song, almost like they do on their record. For me it was like making three records. These singers are so wonderful and unique — I really wanted to be on my game. I lived with my headphones on, studying the songs and preparing my interpretations." ...|$|R
2500|$|In his {{freshman}} year of college in 2007, when Yom Kippur (the holiest {{day of the year}} in Judaism; a fast day that is the [...] "Day of Atonement") fell on a Saturday, he fasted until an hour before the Big Ten Conference opener against Iowa started that night. Carimi said, [...] "Religion is a part of me, and I don't want to just say I'm Jewish. <b>I</b> <b>actually</b> <b>do</b> make sacrifices that I know are hard choices.” [...] At the 2011 NFL combine, when asked whether he would play on Yom Kippur in the NFL, he responded: [...] "I already looked out over the next 15 years, and Yom Kippur doesn't fall on a Sunday." ...|$|R
60|$|Then I {{wanted to}} go away and hide behind a thicket and kick myself, but what <b>I</b> <b>actually</b> <b>did</b> was to give Pups part of my meat.

60|$|Words cannot {{tell what}} a sense I had, {{at the same}} time, of the dreadful mystery {{that he was to}} me. When he fell asleep of an evening, with his knotted hands {{clenching}} the sides of the easy-chair, and his bald head tattooed with deep wrinkles falling forward on his breast, I would sit and look at him, wondering what he had done, and loading him with all the crimes in the Calendar, until the impulse was powerful on me to start up and fly from him. Every hour so increased my abhorrence of him, that I even think I might have yielded to this impulse in the first agonies of being so haunted, notwithstanding all he had done for me and the risk he ran, but for the knowledge that Herbert must soon come back. Once, <b>I</b> <b>actually</b> <b>did</b> start {{out of bed in the}} night, and begin to dress myself in my worst clothes, hurriedly intending to leave him there with everything else I possessed, and enlist for India as a private soldier.|$|E
60|$|As the day {{advanced}} rain again {{began to}} fall, but nothing could damp me now. I had almost worked {{myself into the}} belief that I was tiger-hunting! I advanced with cautious tread, looked earnestly into dark caverns, and passed under the deep shadow of thick and tangled bushes with feelings of awe. I even indulged my wayward fancy by thinking of Gordon Cumming and Livingstone; {{did my best to}} mistake gnarled roots for big snakes, and red stones for couching leopards. At last, while in the sombre twilight of a dense mass of underwood, <b>I</b> <b>actually</b> <b>did</b> see a bit of brown hair moving. I threw forward my rifle with a promptitude worthy of Hawkeye himself, but experienced no shock of excitement, for the object was so palpably a small rabbit, or coney, that imagination sternly refused to deceive me. Baboons had been heard barking on the evening of our arrival. I looked out for these, but saw none. In short, none of the inhabitants of wood, glen, or mountain, save myself, were foolish enough to go out in such weather. Nevertheless I returned to the house happy and ready for supper.|$|E

Carimi said, [...] "Religion {{is a part of}} me, and I don't want to just say I'm Jewish. <b>I</b> <b>actually</b> <b>do</b> make sacrifices that I know are hard choices."

500|$|One of Paul's main storylines {{culminated in}} him having his leg amputated after an accident. The storyline has {{received}} some criticism as Paul was shown on different occasions not limping with his false leg.

One time I did change my leg, as in I swapped it over and limped on the other one to see if anyone noticed." [...] Dennis revealed in May 2011, that he wears a brace on his leg as remembering which leg to limp on was becoming a [...] "little distracting." ...|$|R
6000|$|So {{the child}} made the big four-post bed, all curtained round, into a fortress, and I besieged her there, till she screamed with glee, while the Queen took my mother's arm, and they paced the rooms together, sadly {{discussing}} {{the times and}} the utter lack of news from home, when the last tidings had been most alarming. Poor lady! I {{think it was a}} comfort to her, for she loved my mother; but we could not but grieve to see her in such a plight. As we went home we planned that we would carry a faggot in the carriage the next day, and that I would take it upstairs to her. And so <b>I</b> <b>actually</b> <b>did,</b> but the sentry insisted on knowing what I was carrying hidden in a cloak, and when he saw it, the honest man actually burst into tears that the daughter of Henri IV. should be in such straits. The Queen kissed me for it, and said I was like the good girl in Madame d'Aulnoy's tales, and she would fain be the benevolent fairy to reward me. And then the little Princess insisted that I was Capuchon Rouge, and that she was my Grandmother Wolf, and after making her great eyes at me, she ate me up with kisses over and over again! Ah! how happy children can be. It was strange to remember that this was the way King Charles's little daughter spent that 30th of January! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "To confess repentance," [...] he said slowly, [...] "would be {{to confess}} to a monstrous crime. Don't you see that? Oh, monsieur, have {{patience}} with me; let me explain myself a little. You say that I am in part responsible for something of all this that has happened. My exhortations {{of the people at}} Rennes and twice afterwards at Nantes are said to have had their share in what followed there. It may be so. It would be beyond my power positively to deny it. Revolution followed and bloodshed. More may yet come. To repent implies a recognition that I have done wrong. How shall I say that I have done wrong, and thus take a share of the responsibility for all that blood upon my soul? I will be quite frank with you to show you how far, indeed, I am from repentance. What I did, <b>I</b> <b>actually</b> <b>did</b> against all my convictions at the time. Because there was no justice in France to move against the murderer of Philippe de Vilmorin, I moved in the only way that I imagined could make the evil done recoil upon the hand that did it, and those other hands that had the power but not the spirit to punish. Since then I have come to see that I was wrong, and that Philippe de Vilmorin and those who thought with him were in the right.|$|E
60|$|When my uncles {{changed their}} minds in regard to colonizing their {{families}} at the mills, {{as they did in}} about a year, it became necessary for my father to look about for some new employment, and he naturally looked in the old direction. There were several schemes for getting hold of this paper and that, and there were offers that came to nothing. In that day there were few salaried editors in the country outside of New York, and the only hope we could have was of some place as printers in an office which we might finally buy. The affair ended in our going to the State capital, where my father found work as a reporter of legislative proceedings for one of the daily journals, and I was taken into the office as a compositor. In this way I came into living contact with literature again, and the daydreams began once more over the familiar cases of type. A definite literary ambition grew up in me, and in the long reveries of the afternoon, when I was distributing my case, I fashioned a future of overpowering magnificence and undying celebrity. I should be ashamed to say what literary triumphs I achieved in those preposterous deliriums. What <b>I</b> <b>actually</b> <b>did</b> was to write a good many copies of verse, in imitation, never owned, of Moore and Goldsmith, and some minor poets, whose work caught my fancy, as I read it in the newspapers or put it into type.|$|E
