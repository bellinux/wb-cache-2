40|$|AIM: The {{purpose of}} this study was to test the {{reliability}} of an <b>exophthalmometer</b> commonly used in the Netherlands; to determine the exophthalmometry value distribution with this instrument and to assess the upper exophthalmometry limits of normal in a healthy, adult, Caucasian, Dutch population. Furthermore, to assess the effects of gender and age on exophthalmometry readings in this group and in a group of Graves' patients by comparing healthy, adult, Caucasian, Dutch individuals with adult, Caucasian, Dutch Graves' patients. METHODS: To test the reliability of our Hertel <b>exophthalmometer,</b> we determined the interobserver variation between two observers by measuring 160 eyes in healthy, adult, Caucasian, Dutch females and males (10 females and 10 males in each decade between 20 and 60 years of age). These data were also used for the assessment of the Hertel value distribution and for defining the upper limits of normal in these individuals by logistic regression analysis. The effects of disease, age and gender were established using these data plus data of a retrospective study of 393 adult, Caucasian, Dutch females (n= 294) and males (n= 99) with Graves' orbitopathy in whom Hertel values were measured with the same <b>exophthalmometer.</b> RESULTS: Exophthalmometry using an Hertel <b>exophthalmometer</b> appeared reliable (Pearson correlation coefficient for interobserver variation 0. 89; 96 % of the Hertel values measured by two observers were within the limits (of 2 mm) of agreement). Hertel values usually show a normal distribution in healthy individuals and in Graves' patients and are sex- and age-dependent, but there was no dependence on age in this small series in adults. Logistic regression analysis revealed an upper limit of normal of 16 mm in females and 20 mm in males in our group, using the <b>exophthalmometer</b> described.

40|$|The {{projection}} of the cornea from the bony orbit has been determined, in facial approximation, by centrally locating the eyeball in the orbit and positioning the cornea so that its most anterior point falls in line with a tangent dropped from the mid-superior to the mid-inferior orbital rim. However, {{there appears to be}} no scientific evidence to justify this guideline; yet, there have been numerous studies that measure globe projection in living subjects, from the lateral orbit using an <b>exophthalmometer.</b> The aim of this study was to determine if the traditional facial approximation guideline is consistent with the exophthalmometry literature. MRI research shows that corneal projection is underestimated using the traditional facial approximation guideline. An underestimation is also strongly supported by statistical comparisons of globe projection measures taken using more traditional instruments (e. g., Hertel 2 ̆ 7 s <b>exophthalmometer)</b> to skull morphology (p < 0. 006). It is suggested that the traditional facial approximation guideline not be used in future facial approximations since it appears to under-predict anterior globe projection by 4 mm on average.

40|$|Purpose. The {{more common}} method to {{quantify}} interzigomatic distance and proptosis {{of the eye}} {{is the use of}} Hertel <b>exophthalmometer.</b> The eyelid width is usually determined using a ruler. These measurements are subjected to numerous variables and the reproducibility is very poor. The purpose of this work was the evaluation of a new computerized method useful to determine proptosis and width of the eyelid rim. Materials and methods. The study has been conducted on 20 patients with thyroid ophthalmopathy. Proptosis and interzigomatic distance have been measured with the use of an Hertel <b>exophthalmometer,</b> while the amplitude of the eyelid rim and lid retraction have been evaluated by a common ruler. Each measurement has been made by two different eye doctors. The same patients have been photographed from the front and the side by using similar conditions of illumination. The pictures underwent a computerized image analysis with a software developed in our Institute. The same examiners who made manual measurements evaluated ocular proptosis, interzigomatic distance, the width of eyelid rim, and the superior and inferior retraction of the lids using the computer. Results. Results of the measurements obtained by the two physicians with the Hertel <b>exophthalmometer</b> and with the ruler were significantly different. On the contrary, there was not significant difference between the data obtained with image analysis by the same examiners. Conclusions. The use of an appropriate software to carry out the image analysis to determine proptosis and width of the eyelid rim seems to be more accurate as compared to traditional methods.

To {{compare the}} {{measurements}} of retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL), macula and optic disc parameters obtained by {{optical coherence tomography}} (OCT), and intraocular pressure (IOP) between the patients with thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy (TAO) and healthy controls. Methods. One hundred and thirty-two eyes of 66 patients with TAO and 72 eyes of 36 healthy controls {{were included in the}} study. Proptosis level was determined by Hertel <b>exophthalmometer.</b> Optic disc, peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer, and macula parameters were measured by OCT. All measurements of the patients were compared with those of age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Results. No statistically significant difference was found between the patients with TAO and control group in terms of demographic characteristics (P> 0. 05). <b>Exophthalmometer</b> measurements and IOP were higher in TAO group (P< 0. 05). Mean macula thicknesses in TAO and control groups were 239. 3 ± 29. 8 [*]μm and 246. 6 ± 31. 8 [*]μm, respectively, and the difference between the groups was statistically significant (P= 0. 000).

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{assess the}} effect of {{simultaneous}} measurement of the two eyes in Hertel exophthalmometry (i. e., when both readings are taken sequentially, without removing the instrument from the orbital rims) {{and to find out}} whether simultaneous measurement would influence the final reading of each eye. METHODS: In this prospective, comparative study, Hertel exophthalmometry was performed on 61 patients by two experienced observers. Only patients with no history of orbital disease were included. Three different measurements were performed on each patient by each observer. Initially, the right eye was measured separately, then the left eye was measured separately, and finally, both eyes were measured together. RESULTS: When the eyes were measured separately, in 30 % of cases observers obtained equal readings in both eyes; in 47 %, {{the difference between the two}} eyes was 1 mm; and in 23 %, the difference was 2 mm or more. However, in simultaneous bilateral measurements, in 73 % of cases, observers obtained equal readings in both eyes; in 24 %, the difference between the two eyes was 1 mm; and only in 3 % was the difference 2 mm or greater. Paired t tests showed that the mean difference between measurements of the two eyes was significantly smaller in simultaneous bilateral measurements (p < 0. 001). Interobserver variation was similar for measurements taken separately on each eye and for simultaneous bilateral measurements. CONCLUSIONS: When both eyes were measured simultaneously with the Hertel <b>exophthalmometer,</b> examiners were inclined to obtain similar readings in both eyes of patients with symmetrical-appearing eyes. The possible bias arising this way may reduce the reliability of Hertel <b>exophthalmometer</b> in relative exophthalmometry...|$|E

40|$|We {{searched for}} a {{possible}} target tissue in eye orbit for thyroid autoantibodies in endocrine ophthalmopathy (Graves’ disease), using correlation analysis method. We examined a group of 139 patients (278 eye orbits) with thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy associated with diffuse toxic goiter. Serological parameters (antibodies to thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor; thyroglobulin, thyroid peroxidase) were compared with instrumental diagnostic data (multi-layer CT, ultrasonography of eye orbit, and <b>exophthalmometer),</b> as well as clinical symptoms. Statistical correlation analysis enabled us to show different degrees of association between thyroid antibodies and clinical manifestations of Graves’ disease and eye orbit involvement. Especially, carriers of antibodies to TSH receptor and thyroglobulin (as compared to seronegative patients) exhibited higher exophthalmos scores (19. 16 ± 0. 26 mm, p < 0. 001, and 19. 41 ± 0. 40 mm, p < 0. 05, respectively), and with total muscle index (2. 42 ± 0. 05, p < 0. 01, and 2. 42 ± 0. 08, respectively). Meanwhile, eyelids in carriers of antibodies to TSH receptor and thyroid peroxidase {{proved to be more}} swollen (p < 0. 001, p < 0. 05, respectively). Carriage of antibodies to thyroglobulin was associated with synchronous involvement of two structures of the eye orbit: extraocular muscles and retrobulbar tissue, which is reflected by increase in the average ntegral exophthalmos index within the group. </p...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} a new surgical method, using calvarial bone graft {{combined with a}} wedge of irradiated homologous costal cartilage, for the revision repair of posttraumatic enophthalmos. METHODS: This retrospective study was performed from January 1, 2003, through December 31, 2007. Eight patients were diagnosed as having unilateral posttraumatic enophthalmos. All the patients had previously undergone insufficient primary repair of their orbital fractures. In the revision surgery a calvarial bone graft {{was placed in the}} area of the defect using a transconjunctival approach. In combination with this technique, a wedge of irradiated rib cartilage was placed on the bone graft behind the globe. Patients were assessed preoperatively and postoperatively by ophthalmologists and maxillofacial surgeons. Standard follow-up examinations were performed at 2 and 4 weeks and at 3 and 6 months after surgery. Computed tomographic scans were obtained preoperatively and postoperatively from all patients. RESULTS: For all 8 corrected orbits, favorable cosmetic results were obtained regarding the position of the globe. The mean preoperative Hertel <b>exophthalmometer</b> showed a difference of 3. 1 mm and 0. 7 mm postoperatively. Improvement of ocular motility and reduction of diplopia were achieved in only 1 patient; in the others, motility and diplopia remained unchanged. No postoperative complications were observed.

40|$|Purpose: This study {{investigated}} the intra-observer and inter-observer variation of Hertel exophthalmometry. Methods: Seventy normal Chinese adults had bilateral exophthalmometry performed by two examiners. The two examiners were masked to the measurement results. One examiner did the measurement twice and the other examiner measured it once; the order was randomised. The same Hertel <b>exophthalmometer</b> was used throughout the study. The Bland-Altman method was used to analyse the intra-observer and inter-observer agreement. Results: The mean intra-observer and inter-observer agreements on the interorbital distance (IOD) were ± 3. 31 mm and ± 6. 39 mm, respectively. The intra-observer exophthalmometry difference was - 0. 01 ± 0. 61 mm for the right eye and 0. 09 ± 0. 56 mm for the left eye. Agreements were ± 1. 19 mm and ± 1. 09 mm for {{the right and left}} eyes, respectively. The inter-observer exophthalmometry difference was - 0. 61 ± 0. 89 mm for the right eye and - 0. 49 ± 0. 80 mm for the left eye.

Methods: One hundred and twenty-two males and 114 healthy females with age ranging from 18 to 87 years were included in the study. The study population was recruited from patients presenting to our institution for routine refractive examination. Hertel <b>exophthalmometer</b> was used to measure the degree of ocular protrusion. Effect of age, refractive error, interpupillary distance, and axial length on globe position was detected with linear regression analyses. Results: The mean Hertel exophthalmometric size was 15. 7 + 2. 6 mm (range; 11 to 21 mm). The mean value for males was 16. 1 ± 2. 6 mm (range; 11 to 21 mm), and for females 15. 5 ± 2. 6 mm (range; 11 to 20 mm). The mean distance between the lateral rims of the orbit was 102 + 5. 1 mm (range; 88 to 111 mm). The mean exophthalmometric values were not statistically different in males and females. Age and mean spherical equivalents were negatively correlated with exophthalmometric measurements. Axial length was positively correlated with exophthalmometric measurements. Conclusion: The exophthalmometric measurement of the eye is affected by the age, spherical equivalent and the axial length.

40|$|Background: The {{purpose of}} this {{retrospective}} follow-up study is to evaluate the prevalence of patients with thyroid eye disease presenting with apparent unilateral proptosis and determine the occurrence of exophthalmos in contralateral non-proptotic eye over the time. Associated features with this event were evaluated. Methods. A cohort of 655 consecutive patients affected by thyroid eye disease with a minimum follow-up of 10 years was reviewed. Exophthalmos was assessed by using both Hertel <b>exophthalmometer</b> and computed tomography (CT). The influence of age, gender, hormonal status and of different therapies such as corticosteroids, radiotherapy and surgical decompression on this disease progression was evaluated. Results: A total of 89 patients (13. 5 %) (95 % confidence interval [CI] 15 %- 10 %) had clinical evidence of unilateral exophthalmos at the first visit. Among these, 13 patients (14 %) (95 % CI 22 %- 7 %) developed subsequent contralateral exophthalmos. The increase of protrusion ranged from 2 to 7 mm (mean of 4. 2). The time of onset varied from 6 months to 7 years (mean time: 29 months). Smoking status, young age and surgical decompression are significantly associated with development of contralateral proptosis (p<. 05). Conclusions: Asymmetric thyroid eye disease {{with the appearance of}} unilateral exophthalmos at the initial examination is a fairly frequent event, while subsequent contralateral proptosis occurs less commonly. However, physicians should be aware that young patients, particularly if smokers, undergoing orbital decompression in one eye may need further surgery on contralateral side over time...|$|E

Patients and methods: A prospective descriptive study {{was carried out in}} the ophthalmic unit of the Yaoundé Central Hospital from March to May 2015. Consenting patients aged 20 – 40  years with no intraocular pathology who were seen for refractive errors were included. Ocular protrusion was measured using the Hertel <b>exophthalmometer.</b> Automatic refraction was done following cycloplegia with cyclopentolate and tropicamide. Results: A total of 200 patients were included (68 % females and 32 % males). The mean age was 27. 2 ± 6  years. Hyperopia was the most common refractive error (51 %), followed by hyperopic astigmatism (19. 3 %). EV varied between 9  mm and 23  mm, with a mean of 14. 8 ± 2. 5  mm in the right eye and 15. 0 ± 2. 5  mm in the left eye. The mean EVs were 17. 10 ± 2. 80  mm in myopia, 14. 24 ± 1. 92  mm in hyperopia, 16. 72 ± 2. 58  mm in myopic astigmatism, 14. 07 ± 2. 19  mm in hyperopic astigmatism, and 14. 77 ± 2. 40  mm in mixed astigmatism.

40|$|Purpose: To {{determine}} {{absolute and}} relative ocular protrusion values for healthy Lithuanian {{children and adolescents}} and analyze the data according to the age, gender, weight, height, and outer orbital distance. Methods: A total of 397 children and adolescents were included in this study. Measurements for {{the right and left}} eyes protrusions were done with Hertel <b>exophthalmometer</b> in healthy subjects aged from 5 to 18  years old. Height, weight, age and gender of subjects were recorded. Results: The mean age for all children and adolescents was 11. 5  ±  3. 6  years. For all subjects, the mean (±SD) absolute ocular protrusion value of both eyes (OU) was 14. 91  ±  1. 68  mm. There {{was no significant difference in}} measurements between male and female subjects although female eye protrusion was higher. No individual had more than 2  mm of asymmetry between eyes. Mean exophthalmometric values for right eye were greater than the values of the left eye, and the mean relative protrusion for all participants was 0. 2  mm. The mean distance between the lateral rims of the orbits was 98. 7  ±  5. 2  mm for all subjects.

Methods: The Kandy Eye {{study was a}} population-based, cross-sectional study. By randomized cluster sampling, 1721 eligible participants, who were 40 years old and over were identified; 1375 participated. Exophthalmometry was performed with Hertel's <b>exophthalmometer.</b> Participants' demographics including age, gender and ethnicity were recorded. Height, weight, body mass index, non-cycloplegic refraction and ocular biometry were measured with standardized methods. Summary {{statistical analysis was performed}} for exophthalmometric values and relationships with other factors were tested using Pearson product–moment correlation coefficient analysis, standard single and multiple linear regression analysis. Results: A total of 1341 subjects were included in the analysis. Exophthalmometric values for the population had a mean of 15. 82 mm, standard deviation of 2. 73 mm and range of 10. 46 – 21. 28 mm. Exophthalmometric values for men were significantly higher than women. There {{were no significant differences between}} the racial groups' exophthalmometric values (Sinhalese, Tamils, Moors). Exophthalmometric values were significantly correlated with age, gender, height, weight, body mass index, base and axial length but not to refractive spherical equivalents.

CT findings showed an increase in orbital fat and/or muscle thickening in all patients at baseline, proving to be a useful procedure for ophthalmologic diagnosis in doubtful cases. No patient in either group developed hypothyroidism or elevated TSH levels during the study period; this may explain our good results in the evolution of Graves' ophthalmopathy after treatment with I- 131 and antithyroid drugs. Euthyroidism seems to be an important factor in the outcome of ophthalmopathy after therapy, whatever the mode of treatment chosen to achieve it.

40|$|Sarcoidosis is a {{systemic}} granulomatous disease of unknown etiology. In most cases, mediastinal lymph nodes and lung parenchyma are involved. In addition, the eyes, skin, abdominal organs, {{central nervous system}} or the joints might be involved {{during the course of}} the disease. Sarcoidosis has been found to be related with other autoimmune diseases such as thyroiditis. In this report, we present the case of a patient in whom hyperthroidism was found and Graves’ disease and papillary thyroid carcinoma were diagnosed while being investigated with a preliminary diagnosis of sarcoidosis. A 50 -year-old male patient was admitted to our chest diseases clinic with the complaints of cough with colorless sputum, joint pain, weakness, weight loss (36 kgs), palpitations, tremor of the hands and pain in the right eye. Mediastinal lympadenopathy was detected on CT scan. Laboratory tests demonstrated hypercalcemia and low levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH). Eye examination revealed uveitis. Bronchoscopy was planned to confirm the diagnosis of sarcoidosis. Thyroid function test was performed and the patient turned out to have hyperthyroidism with high free T 4 and low TSH levels. TSH receptor antibody titer was 71 U/L (0 - 14 U/L). Ultrasonographic examination demonstrated enlarged thyroid gland and heterogeneous parenchyma with increased blood flow pattern. 4 - and 24 -hour radioiodine uptakes were 30 % and 60 %, respectively and scintigraphy findings were compatible with diffuse toxic goiter. On Hertel <b>exophthalmometer,</b> the measurements of the right and left eye were 23 and 24 mm, respectively. The diagnosis of Graves’ disease was made and thionamide therapy was started. Since active ophthalmopathy was present and the patient did not want to receive medical therapy for a long time, surgery was the best option for definitive therapy. The patient was prepared for the surgery with lugol solution (3 x 10 drops daily) and after eutyroidism was achieved, bilateral total thyroidectomy was performed. Before and after surgery, the patient was given 20 mg methylprednisolone in order to control hypercalcemia due to sarcoidosis and to control eye symptoms caused by Graves’ disease. The postoperative pathology report was compatible with thyroiditis and 6 mm micropapillary carcinoma at one focal area in the right lobe. The patient received radioactive iodine therapy after thyroidectomy. Sarcoidosis occurs as a result of immune response created against environmental and genetic factors in the presence of a triggering agent. The disease can involve many organ and systems. The classical pathological finding is granulomatosis without caseification. Autoimmune thyroiditis may accompany the disease in any stage and hypo or hyperthyroidism may develop. In our case, hyperthyroidism developed during the active phase of the disease and, interestingly, papillary thyroid cancer was detected although there were no thyroid nodules found by preoperative thyroid ultrasonography.

40|$|OBJETIVO: Estabelecer padrões de normalidade dos valores da exoftalmometria de ambos os olhos e da distância entre os rebordos orbitários laterais (base) em adultos jovens da população do Grande ABC São Paulo/Brasil. MÉTODOS: Realizou-se a exoftalmometria com o exoftalmômetro de Hertel, em 129 pacientes do sexo feminino e 75 do sexo masculino, na faixa etária de 25 a 55 anos. Os pacientes foram separados em três grupos raciais (brancos, negros e pardos). RESULTADOS: A variação da exoftalmometria encontrada na população em estudo foi de 10 a 23 mm, média de 15, 57 ± 2, 43 mm. No sexo feminino a média foi de 15, 42 ± 2, 40 mm e no masculino, 15, 83 ± 2, 47 mm. Não se encontrou uma relação estatisticamente significativa entre os sexos feminino e masculino (p= 0, 25). Na raça branca a média foi de 15, 57 ± 2, 46 mm, na negra foi de 16, 20 ± 2, 70 mm e na parda foi de 15, 02 ± 2, 01 mm. A diferença foi estatisticamente significativa (p= 0, 008) entre as raças negra e parda. A medida da base variou de 104 a 125 mm (média de 113, 91 ± 4, 37 mm). A diferença entre homens e mulheres foi estatisticamente significativa (p PURPOSE: To {{determine}} the normal exophthalmometry of both eyes {{and of the}} distance between lateral orbital rims (the base measurement) in young adults from ABC Region, São Paulo/Brazil. METHODS: Exophthalmometry, by Hertel's <b>exophthalmometer,</b> was made in 129 female and 75 male subjects, age ranging from 25 to 55 years. The subjects were divided in three groups of races (white, black and mulatto). RESULTS: The values of exophthalmometry ranged from 10 to 23 mm, mean 15, 57 ± 2, 43 mm. In female the mean was 15, 42 ± 2, 40 mm and in male, 15, 83 ± 2, 47 mm. There is {{no statistically significant difference}} between female or male (p= 0, 25). In whites subjects the mean was 15, 57 ± 2, 46 mm, in black was 16, 20 ± 2, 70 mm and in mulatto was 15, 02 ± 2, 01 mm. There was a statistically significant difference between blaks and mulattos (p= 0, 008). The base measurement ranged from 104 to 125 mm (mean 113, 91 ± 4, 37 mm). There was a statistically significant difference between males and females (p< 0, 001). In whites the base was 112, 18 ± 4, 02 mm, in blacks 115, 37 ± 4, 71 mm and in mulattos, 115, 18 ± 3, 66 mm. There was a statistically significant difference for the base measurement between white subjects and black ones, and between white subjects and mulattos (p< 0, 001). No individual had more than 2 mm of assimetry between eyes. CONCLUSION: The normal exophthalmometric value in the studied population was 10 to 23 mm and the base measurement ranged from 104 to 125 mm...|$|E
40|$|We {{compared}} {{the effectiveness of}} systemic corticosteroids {{with the use of}} high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) in the treatment of Graves' ophthalmopathy. This was performed as a prospective, nonrandomized study including a blinded ophthalmological and orbital computed tomographic (CT) evaluation. The two groups of patients were not significantly different in relation to sex composition, age distribution, duration of Graves' disease, and ophthalmopathy and previous hyperthyroidism. All patients were followed up by endocrinologic evaluation and blinded ophthalmological (before therapy = B, at the end of therapy = E, and 6 months after the end = 6 M) and orbital CT (B and E) evaluations. Twenty-seven patients treated with IVIG were followed up after the end of treatment for an average of 21 months (range 12 to 48 months). Soft tissue involvement (NOSPECS) improved or disappeared in 32 of 35 (90 %) patients treated with IVIG and in 25 of 27 (92. 5 %) patients treated with corticosteroids. Diplopia improved or disappeared in 22 of 29 (75 %) patients treated with IVIG and in 16 of 20 (80 %) patients treated with corticosteroids. The results observed by clinical evaluation were confirmed with orbital CT score in 30 IVIG patients and in the corticosteroid-treated patients; a significant reduction of extraocular muscle thickness was observed after treatment in both groups. Proptosis improved or disappeared in 20 of 31 (65 %) patients treated with IVIG and in 15 of 24 (62 %) patients treated with corticosteroids. Mean values of proptosis evaluated by Hertel's <b>exophthalmometer</b> showed a slight reduction both in IVIG as well as in corticosteroid-treated patients. It is interesting to observe that in 28 IVIG-treated patients in whom it was possible to evaluate soft tissue involvement, proptosis and diplopia in the period between the fifth and sixth month from the start of therapy, {{the most important part of}} the amelioration (if responders) was already obtained at that time. Responder patients were defined in relation to the decrease in the highest NOSPECS class or grade. Among IVIG-treated patients 26 of 34 (76 %) responded; while in the corticosteroid group 18 of 27 (66 %) responded to treatment. The prevalences of patients who responded to the treatments were not significantly different in the two groups (Chi-square). The initial values of the subjective eye score were similar in the two groups, and a significant reduction was observed in both. Major side effects requiring discontinuation of the corticosteroid therapy were observed in two patients with hemorrhagic gastritis and in one patient with manic-depressive psychosis. Among 15 patients submitted to the evaluation of bone mineral content before and after corti-costeroid therapy, 4 presented signs of osteoporosis and 3 a reduction of bone mineral content. Moderate and minor side effects were more frequently noted in steroid-treated patients than in the IVIG group. These data suggest that IVIG is safe and effective in reducing the eye changes in patients with Graves' ophthalmopathy...|$|E
