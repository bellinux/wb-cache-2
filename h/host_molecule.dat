500|$|Several {{obstacles}} {{have been}} {{encountered in the}} development of astatine-based radiopharmaceuticals for cancer treatment. World War II delayed research for close to a decade. Results of early experiments indicated that a cancer-selective carrier would need to be developed and {{it was not until the}} 1970s that monoclonal antibodies became available for this purpose. Unlike iodine, astatine shows a tendency to dehalogenate from molecular carriers such as these, particularly at sp3 carbon sites (less so from sp2 sites). Given the toxicity of astatine accumulated and retained in the body, this emphasized the need to ensure it remained attached to its <b>host</b> <b>molecule.</b> While astatine carriers that are slowly metabolized can be assessed for their efficacy, more rapidly metabolized carriers remain a significant obstacle to the evaluation of astatine in nuclear medicine. Mitigating the effects of astatine-induced radiolysis of labeling chemistry and carrier molecules is another area requiring further development.

40|$|The {{propensity}} for capsid disassembly and uncoating of human adenovirus is modulated by interactions with <b>host</b> cell <b>molecules</b> like integrins and alpha defensins. Here, we use {{atomic force microscopy}} (AFM) nanoindentation to elucidate, at the single-particle level, the mechanism by which binding of these <b>host</b> <b>molecules</b> affects virus particle elasticity. Our results demonstrate the direct link between integrin or defensin binding and the mechanical properties of the virus. We show that the structure and geometry of adenovirus result in an anisotropic elastic response that relates to icosahedral symmetry. This elastic response changes upon binding <b>host</b> <b>molecules.</b> Whereas integrin binding softens the vertex regions, binding of a human alpha defensin has exactly the opposite effect. Our results reveal that the ability of these <b>host</b> <b>molecules</b> to influence adenovirus disassembly correlates with a direct effect on the elastic strength of the penton region.

50|$|Molecular {{recognition}} can be {{subdivided into}} static molecular recognition and dynamic molecular recognition.

VSD movements are coupled to BK channel opening with a unique allosteric mechanism and are modulated by Ca 2 + and Mg 2 + binding via the interactions among the channel pore, VSD and CTD. These properties are energetically advantageous for the pore {{to be controlled by}} multiple stimuli, revealing the adaptability of the VSD to its <b>host</b> <b>molecules</b> and showing the potential for intracellular signals to affect the VSD in order to modulate the function of its <b>host</b> <b>molecules...</b>|$|R

40|$|Cerebral malaria (CM) is {{a primary}} cause of malaria-associated deaths among young African children. Yet no {{diagnostic}} tools are available {{that could be used}} to predict which of the children infected with Plasmodium falciparum malaria will progress to CM. We used the Plasmodium berghei ANKA murine model of experimental cerebral malaria (ECM) and high-density oligonucleotide microarray analyses to identify <b>host</b> <b>molecules</b> that are strongly associated with the clinical symptoms of ECM. Comparative expression analyses were performed with C 57 BL/ 6 mice, which have an ECM-susceptible phenotype, and with mice that have ECM-resistant phenotypes: CD 8 knockout and perforin knockout mice on the C 57 BL/ 6 background and BALB/c mice. These analyses allowed the identification of more than 200 <b>host</b> <b>molecules</b> (a majority of which had not been identified previously) with altered expression patterns in the brain that are strongly associated with the manifestation of ECM. Among these <b>host</b> <b>molecules,</b> brain samples from mice with ECM expressed significantly higher levels of p 21, metallothionein, and hemoglobin α 1 proteins by Western blot analysis than mice unaffected by ECM, suggesting the possible utility of these molecules as prognostic biomarkers of CM in humans.

The resulting polymer-cavitand assemblies exhibited a thermoresponsive behavior that could be modulated by variation of the copolymer composition and length.

50|$|In {{order to}} meet the {{geometric}} requirements for polymerization, a host-guest strategy is used by combining a <b>host</b> <b>molecule</b> and diiodobutadiyne in solution and allowing co-crystalization to occur. This can be utilized because hosts that are most commonly used are able to bond to the diyne monomer by halogen bonding from the lewis acidic iodine atom to a lewis basic nitrogen of the host (usually a nitrile or pyridine). In order to give a proper repeat distance to the monomers (5 Å), the hosts also contain oxalamide groups that create a hydrogen bonding network throughout the crystal.|$|E
5000|$|Many {{clathrates}} {{are derived}} from organic hydrogen-bonded frameworks. These frameworks are prepared from molecules that [...] "self-associate" [...] by multiple hydrogen-bonding interactions. The most famous clathrates are methane clathrates where the hydrogen-bonded framework is contributed by water and the guest molecules are methane. Large amounts of methane naturally frozen in this form exist both in permafrost formations and under the ocean sea-bed. Other hydrogen-bonded networks {{are derived from}} hydroquinone, urea, and thiourea. A much studied <b>host</b> <b>molecule</b> is Dianin's compound. Hofmann compounds are coordination polymers with the formula Ni(CN)4Ni(NH3)2. These materials crystallize with small aromatic guests (benzene, certain xylenes), and this selectivity has been exploited commercially for the separation of these hydrocarbons.

50|$|In {{the basic}} reaction, 2-methyl-6-nitrobenzoic {{anhydride}} (MNBA) is primarily {{used as a}} dehydration condensation agent. First, the nucleophilic catalyst acts on the MNBA to produce activated acyl carboxylate. The reaction of carboxyl group in the carboxylic acid with the activated acyl carboxylate produces the corresponding MA, {{in the same manner}} as in the acidic reaction. Then, the nucleophilic catalyst acts selectively on a carbonyl group derived from the carboxylic acid in MA to again produce activated acyl carboxylate. The hydroxyl group in alcohol attacks its <b>host</b> <b>molecule</b> through intermolecular nucleophilic substitution, and at the same time, carboxylate anion, derived from 2-methyl-6-nitrobenzoic acid, acts as a deprotonation agent, promoting the progression of the esterification and producing the desired carboxylic ester. To balance the reaction, each MNBA accepts the atoms of one water molecule from its starting materials, changing itself into two molecules of the amine salt of 2-methyl-6-nitrobenzoic acid, and thus, terminating the reaction. Because the nucleophilic catalyst is reproduced at the end of the reaction, only small stoichiometric quantities are required.|$|E

5000|$|Clathrate hydrates, or gas clathrates, gas hydrates, clathrates, hydrates, etc., are {{crystalline}} water-based solids physically resembling ice, {{in which}} small non-polar molecules (typically gases) or polar molecules with large hydrophobic moieties are trapped inside [...] "cages" [...] of hydrogen bonded, frozen water molecules.

Clathrate hydrates are not officially chemical compounds, as the sequestered molecules are never bonded to the lattice. The formation and decomposition of clathrate hydrates are first order phase transitions, not chemical reactions. Their detailed formation and decomposition mechanisms on a molecular level are still not well understood.Clathrate hydrates were first documented in 1810 by Sir Humphry Davy who found that water was a primary component of what was earlier thought to be solidified chlorine.|$|E
