25|$|Verdemont {{is part of}} the Inland Empire Metropolitan Area of California, the 3rd {{largest in}} the state, and the 12th largest in the nation. Verdemont is made up of mainly <b>desert</b> <b>shrub.</b> Verdemont {{consists}} of many hills and lacks vegetation.|$|E
25|$|The central Sahara is hyperarid, with sparse vegetation. The {{northern}} and southern reaches of the desert, along with the highlands, have areas of sparse grassland and <b>desert</b> <b>shrub,</b> with trees and taller shrubs in wadis, where moisture collects. In the central, hyperarid region, there are many subdivisions of the great desert: Tanezrouft, the Ténéré, the Libyan Desert, the Eastern Desert, the Nubian Desert and others. These extremely arid areas often receive no rain for years.|$|E

25|$|Sagebrush cover types {{other than}} big {{sagebrush}} can fulfill greater sage-grouse habitat requirements; in fact, the grouse may prefer other sagebrush cover types to big sagebrush. Greater sage-grouse in Antelope Valley, California, for example, use black sagebrush (A. nova) cover types {{more often than}} the more common big sagebrush cover types. Hens with broods on the National Antelope Refuge in Oregon were most frequently found (54–67% of observations) in low sagebrush (A. arbuscula) cover. <b>Desert</b> <b>shrub</b> habitat may also be used by greater sage-grouse.|$|E
25|$|The Southwest has {{the worst}} droughts; one {{is thought to}} have lasted over 500 years and to have {{decimated}} the Anasazi people. Large stretches of <b>desert</b> <b>shrub</b> in the west can fuel the spread of wildfires. Although severe drought is rare, it has occasionally caused major problems, such as during the Dust Bowl (1931–1942), which coincided with the Great Depression. Farmland failed throughout the Plains, entire regions were virtually depopulated, and dust storms ravaged the land. More recently, the western US experienced widespread drought from 1999 to 2004.|$|E
25|$|At the age {{of forty}} Moses kills an Egyptian, after he sees him beating a Hebrew to death, and escapes as a {{fugitive}} into the Sinai desert, where he is taken in by the Midianites and marries Zipporah, {{the daughter of the}} Midianite priest Jethro. When he is eighty years old, Moses is tending a herd of sheep in solitude on Mount Sinai when he sees a <b>desert</b> <b>shrub</b> that is burning but is not consumed. The God of Israel calls to Moses from the fire and reveals his name, Yahweh (from the Hebrew root word 'HWH' meaning to exist), and tells Moses that he is being sent to Pharaoh to bring the people of Israel out of Egypt.|$|E

50|$|He was a {{professor}} at BYU for over 40 years. His primary areas of research were {{on the history of}} the cultivation of crops, such as rye, and on <b>desert</b> <b>shrubs.</b> He is most well known for his research on Atriplex.|$|R
50|$|The native {{vegetation}} {{is dominated}} by high and low <b>desert</b> <b>shrubs</b> such as creosote bush. City residents have introduced many non-native plants, prominent among which are trees such as Aleppo pine, Italian cypress, fan palm, ailanthus, ash, palo verde and redbud.|$|R
25|$|Occasional severe {{flooding}} is experienced. There was the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927, the Great Flood of 1993, {{and widespread}} flooding and mudslides {{caused by the}} 1982–83 El Niño event in the western United States. Localized flooding can, however, occur anywhere, and mudslides from heavy rain can cause problems in any mountainous area, particularly the Southwest. Large stretches of <b>desert</b> <b>shrub</b> in the west can fuel the spread of wildfires. The narrow canyons of many mountain areas {{in the west and}} severe thunderstorm activity during the summer lead to sometimes devastating flash floods as well, while nor'easter snowstorms can bring activity to a halt throughout the Northeast (although heavy snowstorms can occur almost anywhere).|$|E
500|$|In the west, the Tanguts {{took control}} of the Ordos region, where they {{established}} the Western Xia dynasty. Although the Xia were not traditionally known for building walls, in 2011 archeologists uncovered [...] of walls at Ömnögovi Province in Mongolia in what had been Western Xia territory. Radiocarbon analysis showed that they were constructed from 1040 to 1160. The walls were as tall as [...] at places when they were discovered, and may have been around [...] taller originally. They were built with mud and saxaul (a <b>desert</b> <b>shrub)</b> in one section, and dark basalt blocks in another, suggesting that the rocks may have been quarried from nearby extinct volcanoes and transported to the construction site. Archaeologists have not yet found traces of human activity around this stretch of wall, which suggests that the Xia wall in this location may have been incomplete and not ready for use.|$|E
2500|$|For the {{navigation}} season of 1851, two newly built steamers arrived from Sweden, again by caravan from Orenburg. As the geological surveys had found no coal deposits in the area, the Military Governor-General of Orenburg Vasily Perovsky ordered [...] "as large as possible supply" [...] of saxaul (Haloxylon ammodendron, a <b>desert</b> <b>shrub,</b> {{akin to the}} creosote bush) to be collected in Aralsk {{for use by the}} new steamers. Unfortunately, saxaul wood did not turn out a very suitable fuel, and in the later years, the Aral Flotilla was provisioned, at substantial cost, by coal from the Donbass.

50|$|The islands {{may seem}} barren {{due to the}} lack of fresh water and arid {{conditions}} allowing only a few <b>desert</b> <b>shrubs</b> and cactus. The marine flora consists of several varieties of algae. The algae serves as an ideal habitat for small marine species.|$|R

50|$|Like all dicynodonts, Diictodon were herbivorous. They {{used their}} beaks {{to break off}} pieces of the sparse <b>desert</b> <b>shrubs.</b> Like modern <b>desert</b> animals, Diictodon may have had unusually {{efficient}} digestive systems, {{due to the lack}} of nutrients present in desert plants. As burrowing animals, they may have fed off of water-rich plant tubers (roots).|$|R
