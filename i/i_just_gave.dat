500|$|After {{returning}} from Alaska, Hubbard applied {{to join the}} United States Navy. His Congressman, Warren G. Magnuson, wrote to President Roosevelt to recommend Hubbard as [...] "a gentleman of reputation" [...] who was [...] "a respected explorer" [...] and had [...] "marine masters papers for more types of vessels than any other man in the United States". Hubbard was described as [...] "a key figure" [...] in writing organizations, [...] "making him politically potent nationally". The Congressman concluded: [...] "Anything {{you can do for}} Mr Hubbard will be appreciated." [...] His friend Robert MacDonald Ford, by now a State Representative for Washington, sent a letter of recommendation describing Hubbard as [...] "one of the most brilliant men I have ever known". It called Hubbard [...] "a powerful influence" [...] in the Northwest and said that he was [...] "well known {{in many parts of the}} world and has considerable influence in the Caribbean and Alaska". The letter declared that [...] "for courage and ability I cannot too strongly recommend him." [...] Ford later said that Hubbard had written the letter himself: [...] "I don't know why Ron wanted a letter. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>gave</b> him a letter-head and said, 'Hell, you're the writer, you write it!'" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Nan, {{what could}} you expect?" [...] was the cool reply. [...] "You sat up in the stand with your {{handsome}} friend. I reckon I couldn't pitch. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>gave</b> the game away." ...|$|E
6000|$|Before they started, Milt had {{the chance}} to say to her, [...] "I'm getting so I can handle Pinky now. Have to. Thinking of getting hold of his gold-mine. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>give</b> him the eye, as your friend Mr. Saxton would, and he gets so meek----" ...|$|R
6000|$|I didn't answer up prompt. I tried to, but {{the words}} wouldn't come. I tried {{for a second or}} two to brace up and out with it, but I warn't man enough--hadn't the spunk of a rabbit. I see I was weakening; so <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>give</b> up trying, and up and says: ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>give</b> up then. <b>I</b> knowed {{what the}} matter was. That cut bank was an island, and Jim {{had gone down}} t'other side of it. It warn't no towhead that you could float by in ten minutes. It had the big timber of a regular island; it might be five or six miles long {{and more than half}} a mile wide.|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{was afraid}} of getting me into trouble," [...] said Mr. Carter, [...] "and <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>gave</b> her a wink not to {{recognize}} me; but she knew me well enough, bless her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's {{the joint}} {{commendation}} of the publisher {{and the kind}} little blonde who united to sell me the book <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>gave</b> to that poor Subway trainman. Do you ever buy a new book?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, sir, not I," [...] {{answered}} the boy, laughing; [...] "I didn't {{think of any}} answer half so clever; and so <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>gave</b> him a dig in the nose, and that, laid on with right good will." ...|$|E
40|$|I {{have to give}} an {{introductory}} course of physics of electromagnetic waves within about an hour for participants of this winter school of radio astronomy. It is impossible to talk deep aspects of physics of electromagnetic waves {{in such a short}} time, even though all students here are best and brightest from various Asian countries. Therefore I describe only very basics and essentials. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>give</b> man...|$|R
6000|$|... "So I say. But that Grace Hollis is a one! I wouldn't {{have her}} for my sister. Here, come in, Amy, <b>I</b> must <b>just</b> <b>give</b> mother the pepper." ...|$|R
60|$|Rosy. <b>I</b> was <b>just</b> <b>giving</b> him {{a little}} advice.--Well I must go for the present.--Good-morning to your worship--you need not fear the {{lieutenant}} while he is in your house.|$|R
6000|$|Toby related {{all of his}} movements, {{and gave}} the driver a {{faithful}} account of all {{that had happened to}} him, concluding his story by saying, [...] "That was one of Mrs. Treat's doughnuts that <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>gave</b> to Mr. Stubbs." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{last one}} I sent off," [...] {{continued}} the lady, [...] "had done all that. When she filled up her cup of iniquity by melting the tea-pot, <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>gave</b> {{her a good}} hearty slap on the face. I couldn't help it. Of course she left me after that." ...|$|E
60|$|I just {{caught my}} breath, sharp like, {{and then turned}} {{and ran for the}} gate like a race-horse. I 'ad left the key in the padlock, in case of {{anything}} happening, and <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>gave</b> it one turn, flung the wicket open and slammed it in the ghost's face, and tumbled out into the road.|$|E
6000|$|... "What!" [...] he said, [...] "do you {{white men}} refuse me this little favour, when <b>I</b> have <b>just</b> <b>given</b> you so much--you who have {{wonderful}} medicines that can cure the sick?" ...|$|R

5000|$|Sometimes Rita {{and other}} parents thought I was too tough on kids. 'You push them too hard.' they'd say. 'Bloody rubbish,' I'd respond. 'If we don't {{do it this}} way we're never going to get {{anything}} out of them and they're never going to learn and improve.' Yes, I've pushed kids through the barriers that exist. Mainly <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>give</b> them the facts: 'You've got to work hard … you've got to train four or five days a week'. Frank Ponta ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Exactly so; and therefore, {{while for}} distant landscapes, motionless, and already {{softened}} by atmosphere, the daguerreotype is invaluable (I shall do nothing else this summer but work at it), yet for taking portraits, in any true sense, {{it will be}} always useless, {{not only for the}} reason <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>gave,</b> but for another one which the pre-Raphaelites have forgotten." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{was in such}} {{a temper}} that I daren't trust myself to stop. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>gave</b> 'er one look, and then I drew myself up and went out. 'Alf the fools in our street was {{standing}} in front of the 'ouse, 'umming like bees, but I took no notice. I held my 'ead up and walked through them with that woman trailing arter me.|$|E
60|$|BROADBENT [hugely self-satisfied]. I think I've {{done the}} trick this time. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>gave</b> {{them a bit}} of {{straight}} talk; and it went home. They were greatly impressed: everyone of those men believes in me and will vote for me when the question of selecting a candidate comes up. After all, whatever you say, Larry, they like an Englishman. They feel they can trust him, I suppose.|$|E

6000|$|... "Just look," [...] {{she said}} proudly. [...] "I have {{every bit of}} the bread baked. I got up at three, and it was lovely and light, so <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>gave</b> it a right good {{kneading}} and popped it into the oven. And it's all done {{and out of the}} way. But the loaves don't seem quite as big as they should be," [...] she added doubtfully.|$|E
6000|$|... 'But, Jerry, it's absurd. All I {{did was to}} {{give him}} a tip or two. We were the only men down there, as it was out of the season, and that drew us together. And when I spotted this slice of his <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>gave</b> him a bit of advice. I give you my word that was all. He can't have left me a fortune on the {{strength}} of that!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then how did ye {{expect me}} to know what orders ye'd given?" [...] Mr. Blood's tone was {{positively}} aggrieved. [...] "All that I knew was {{that one of your}} slaves was being murthered by the sun and the flies. And I says to myself, {{this is one of the}} Colonel's slaves, and I'm the Colonel's doctor, and sure it's my duty to be looking after the Colonel's property. So <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>gave</b> the fellow a spoonful of water and covered his back from the sun. And wasn't I right now?" ...|$|E

2500|$|Earlier in the season, Tech's {{head coach}} Mike Leach had been fined US$10,000 for criticizing the officiating {{during the game}} at Texas. Fans contributed nearly $5,000 to help pay it and the money was spent to give free Christmas hams to Lubbock families. So {{following}} the Gator Bowl, he joked when referring to the two penalties assessed against his team for intentional grounding in the end zone, [...] "I felt like we had a back there on the one safety, but I don't comment on officiating. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>give</b> out hams is what I do." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Father;" [...] he said, {{speaking}} {{with a little}} difficulty, [...] "I can't {{tell you how much}} I appreciate your--your coming round. I wanted to do the right thing, but <b>I</b> <b>just</b> couldn't <b>give</b> up such a girl as that." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>gave</b> {{a little}} cry, slipped {{from the bed}} to the floor, laid my head in her lap, and told her everything. It was such a relief, and such a relief to feel those good motherly arms around me and to realize that here was a love that would never fail me no matter what I did or how foolish I was. Sara heard me out and then she said, without a word of reproach or contempt, [...] "It will all come out right yet, dear. Write to Walter and tell him you are sorry." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{could not}} help it, George; 'twas by chance, I give you my word, by the merest chance. You know Governor Dinwiddie {{is to have the}} Major's room, and the state-room is got ready for Mr. Braddock, and we are expecting ever so much company, and I had to take the things which the Major leaves here--he treats the house just as if it was his own already--into his new room, and this {{half-sheet}} of paper fell out of his writing-book, and <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>gave</b> one look at it by the merest chance, and when I saw what it was it was my duty to read it." ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{put her arm}} {{about me}} and kissed me. [...] "I want you," [...] she said, [...] "just as if I had nothing of you. You don't understand--how a woman wants a man. I thought once if <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>gave</b> myself to you it would be enough. It was nothing--it was just a step across the threshold. My dear, every moment you are away I ache for you--ache! I want to be about when it isn't love-making or talk. I want to be doing things for you, and {{watching}} you when you're not thinking of me. All those safe, careless, intimate things. And something else--" [...] She stopped. [...] "Dear, I don't want to bother you. I {{just want you to}} know I love you...." ...|$|E
