Such modulation may enhance or depress effects of these <b>agents.</b> Interactions between <b>environmental</b> factors and the alimentary tract depend on (1) factors related to the alimentary tract that are determined by anatomic, physiologic, and biochemical considerations; (2) factors related to the environmental agents; and (3) individually determined factors. The role of these factors in development of disease and injury is considered.

40|$|Reducing {{exposure}} to toxic <b>environmental</b> <b>agents</b> {{is a critical}} area of intervention for obstetricians, gynecologists, and other reproductive health care professionals. Patient {{exposure to}} toxic environmental chemicals and other stressors is ubiquitous, and preconception and prenatal exposure to toxic <b>environmental</b> <b>agents</b> can have a profound and lasting effect on reproductive health across the life course. Prenatal exposure to certain chemicals has been documented to {{increase the risk of}} cancer in childhood; adult male exposure to pesticides is linked to altered semen quality, sterility, and prostate cancer; and postnatal exposure to some pesticides can interfere with all developmental stages of reproductive function in adult females, including puberty, menstruation and ovulation, fertility and fecundity, and menopause. Many environmental factors harmful to reproductive health disproportionately affect vulnerable and underserved populations, which leaves some populations, including underserved women, more vulnerable to adverse reproductive health effects than other populations. The evidence that links exposure to toxic <b>environmental</b> <b>agents</b> and adverse reproductive and developmental health outcomes is sufficiently robust, and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Society for Reproductive Medicine join leading scientists and other clinical practitioners in calling for timely action to identify and reduce exposure to toxic <b>environmental</b> <b>agents</b> while addressing the consequences of such exposure...|$|R

Crit-ical windows of vulnerability to the effects of these agents occur both pre-and postnatally. The nervous system is relatively unique in that different parts are responsible for different functional domains, and these develop at different times (e. g., motor control, sensory, intelligence and attention). In addition, the many cell types in the brain have different windows of vulner-ability with varying sensitivities to <b>environmental</b> <b>agents.</b> This review fo-cuses on two <b>environmental</b> <b>agents,</b> lead and methylmercury, to illustrate the neurobehavioral and cognitive effects that can result from early life exposures.

5000|$|Vulnerability is the {{summation}} of all risk and protective factors that ultimately determine whether {{an individual or}} subpopulation experiences adverse health outcomes when an exposure to an <b>environmental</b> <b>agent</b> occurs. Sensitivity is an individual’s or subpopulation’s increased responsiveness, primarily for biological reasons, to that exposure. [...] Biological sensitivity {{may be related to}} developmental stage, pre-existing medical conditions, acquired factors, and genetic factors. Socioeconomic factors also {{play a critical role in}} altering vulnerability and sensitivity to environmentally mediated factors by increasing the likelihood of exposure to harmful agents, interacting with biological factors that mediate risk, and/or leading to differences in the ability to prepare for or cope with exposures or early phases of illness. Populations living in certain regions may be at increased risk due to location and the environmental characteristics of a region. Specifically, populations that live in toxic areas that are heavily polluted, are at risk of developing pollution-related diseases such as heart disesae.|$|E

Agger fled to a small cave in which he found a statue and prayed for revenge unknowingly making a pact with an unknown dark god. He strives to make as much as money as possible regardless of the effects {{on the environment and}} uses Roxxon's vast financial resources to pay for lobbyists and lawyers in order to exploit and pollute as much as he wanted without consequence.

When Agent Rosalind Solomon learned that Dario and Roxxon had mined ice mined from Europa and were planning to sell it as well for a lot of money, Solomon decided to teach them a lesson by convincing Thor to bring an even larger chunk of ice from the realm of Jotunheim and give it away for free. Dario brushed off Thor's interference at first. Dario was forced to deal with Thor after he was motivated to fight Roxxon Energy Corporation after Agent Solomon explained the company's negative effects on the environment. Thor's first act against Roxxon Energy Corporation was to destroy some of its factories with a blast of lightning. Dario angrily asked his lawyers what they should do. When his lawyers didn't give a satisfactory answer, Dario fed some of them to bloodthirsty bears.|$|E
40|$|We use {{laboratory}} experiments to test three different water market institutions designed to incorporate instream flow values into the allocation. The institutions are (1) a baseline with fixed minimum flow constraints, (2) an <b>environmental</b> <b>agent</b> {{contributing to the}} cost of providing instream flows, and (3) creating an instream flow right in which an <b>environmental</b> <b>agent</b> can sell the right to reduced flows. Using a “smart ” computer-coordinated market, we find that direct environmental participation in the market can achieve highly efficient and stable allocations. A particularly attractive and practical feature of the third institution is that it nests the status quo in the sense that, should the <b>environmental</b> <b>agent</b> choose not to participate in the market, the default minimum instream flow constraints will be maintained. Although flows may be lower in this institution relative to a fixed constraint on minimum flows, because these flow reductions are voluntary and compensated, all deviations from the status quo (i. e., binding flow constraints) are necessarily Pareto improving in the sense that no agent, including th...|$|E
40|$|Summary. In the {{simplest}} case-only design, cases {{of a disease}} are cross-classified into a 2 × 2 table describing a genotype attribute and exposure to some <b>environmental</b> <b>agent.</b> In some instances, the genetic attribute has described inherited genes; in other instances, it has described mutations, for instance, damage to proto-oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes leading to cancer. Here, the population case-only odds ratio is written as a causal parameter in terms of potential outcomes with and without exposure to the agent. It is shown that the case-only odds ratio makes sense as a causal parameter with inherited genes, but its magnitude {{does not have a}} causal interpretation with mutations, although deviations from 1 do provide information. The difference is that the <b>environmental</b> <b>agent</b> certainly did not cause an individual to inherit particular genes, but it may have caused the mutation.

50|$|Studies {{designed}} {{to test the}} teratogenic potential of <b>environmental</b> <b>agents</b> use animal model systems (e.g., rat, mouse, rabbit, dog, and monkey). Early teratologists exposed pregnant animals to <b>environmental</b> <b>agents</b> and observed the fetuses for gross visceral and skeletal abnormalities. While this is still part of the teratological evaluation procedures today, the field of Teratology is moving to a more molecular level, seeking the mechanism(s) of action by which these agents act. Genetically modified mice are commonly used for this purpose. In addition, pregnancy registries are large, prospective studies that monitor exposures women receive during their pregnancies and record the outcome of their births. These studies provide information about possible risks of medications or other exposures in human pregnancies.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a methodological {{approach}} for tackling the early design stages of self-organising MAS (multi-agent systems). On the one hand, we adopt an architectural pattern based on the A&A (agents & artifacts) meta-model, factoring recurrent situations in MAS scenarios: self-organisation mechanisms are added to an existing envi-ronment of artifacts in terms of <b>environmental</b> <b>agents</b> acting solely based on locality principles. On the other hand, due to the complexity of self-organisation mechanisms, we rely on a three stage design approach with modelling, simulation, and tuning, so as to identify a suitable de-sign of <b>environmental</b> <b>agents</b> and their interaction with artifacts. The main objective is to design a MAS environment providing services that self-organise in response to the unpredictable dynamics of the agents exploiting them. As a case study, we analyse the problem called collective sort, a service for decentralised sorting of items in MAS environments that has been inspired by social insects behaviour. To exemplify our approach, we propose a solution with <b>environmental</b> <b>agents</b> and tuple spaces, whose design choices and evaluation have been driven by formal simulations of system behaviour, according to the proposed methodology...|$|R
