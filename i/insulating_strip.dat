In this case, the fixture may clamp onto a track made of two metal strips separated with an <b>insulating</b> <b>strip.</b> Two-circuit configurations are rare in such systems.

5000|$|Terminal strip construction, {{which is}} often {{referred}} to as point-to-point construction within the tube guitar amplifier community, uses terminal strips (also called [...] "tag boards"). A terminal strip has stamped tin-plated copper terminals, each with a hole through which wire ends could be pushed, fitted on an <b>insulating</b> <b>strip,</b> usually made of a cheap, heat-resistant material such as synthetic-resin bonded paper (FR-2), or bakelite reinforced with cotton. The insulator has an integral mounting bracket, sometimes electrically connected to one or more of the stamped loops to ground them to the chassis.|$|E

The lower {{surface of the}} slab is taken to be insulated with the upper surface maintained at a uniform temperature, apart from a narrow strip which is also insulated. The critical value of the Frank-Kamenetskii stability parameter 8 (e) {{is found to be}} equal to < 5 oc(l- iidocS 2 + [...] .), where 5 ^ = 0 - 87846 and e, the ratio of half the width of the <b>insulated</b> <b>strip</b> to the slab thickness, is small.

40|$|Microchannel array {{plates with}} a {{performance}} {{comparable to that}} of a conventional channel electron multiplier have been obtained for the first time. These array plates employ an angled electrostatic field to inhibit the feedback of positive ions within the microchannels. Saturated output pulse height distributions with modal gain values in excess of 10 million have been obtained and stable operation demonstrated over a range of ambient pressures from 0. 0000001 to 0. 00008 torr. However, a time-dependent reduction in the gain has been observed with these experimental plates because of the accumulation of charge on the <b>insulating</b> <b>strips</b> which are inserted in the wall of the microchannel to establish the angled electrostatic field...|$|R
40|$|It is {{an object}} of the {{invention}} to provide a miniature traveling wave tube which will have most {{of the advantages of}} solid state circuitry but with higher efficiency and without being highly sensitive to temperature and various types of electromagnetic radiation and subatomic particles as are solid state devices. The traveling wave tube which is about 2. 5 cm in length includes a slow wave circuit (SWS) comprising apertured fins with a top cover which is insulated from the fins by strips or rungs of electrically insulating, dielectric material.

40|$|The {{edges of}} a {{two-dimensional}} electron gas (2 DEG) in the quantum Hall effect (QHE) regime are divided into alternating metallic and <b>insulating</b> <b>strips,</b> with their widths determined by the energy gaps of the QHE states and the electrostatic Coulomb interaction. Local probing of these submicrometer features, however, is challenging due to the buried 2 DEG structures. Using a newly developed microwave impedance microscope, we demonstrate the real-space conductivity mapping of the edge and bulk states. The sizes, positions, and field dependence of the edge strips around the sample perimeter agree quantitatively with the self-consistent electrostatic picture. The evolution of microwave images {{as a function of}} magnetic fields provides rich microscopic information around the ν = 2 QHE state. Comment: 12 pages, 4 figures in the main text.

5000|$|A Dream Play is {{positioned}} at the median of Strindberg's series of portrayals {{of his own}} marriage, the Bosse role imbued with both light and darkness. With its associative dream structure, this play is a milestone of modernist drama, described by Strindberg as a lawless reflection of The Dreamer's (Strindberg's) consciousness, limited only by his imagination which [...] "spins and weaves new patterns… on an insignificant basis of reality". Agnes, played by and representing Bosse, {{is the daughter of}} the Vedic god Indra, descending to earth to observe human life and bring its disappointments to the attention of her divine father. The [...] "Oriental" [...] aspect of the play is based on Bosse's dark, exotic looks. [...] Yet she is also drawn into mere humanity and into a claustrophobic marriage to The Lawyer, one of the versions of The Dreamer and, thereby, of Strindberg. Shut up indoors by a possessive husband, Agnes can not breathe; she despondently watches the servant working to exclude light and air from the house by pasting <b>insulating</b> <b>strips</b> of paper along the windows' edges. Recognizably, the [...] "insignificant basis of reality" [...] of Agnes' marriage to The Lawyer is the frustration of the newly married Bosse, yearning for fresh air, sunshine, and travel but fobbed off with a Baedeker.|$|R
5000|$|The chassis was {{constructed}} first, from sheet metal or wood. <b>Insulated</b> terminal <b>strips</b> were then [...] riveted, nailed or screwed to the underside or {{interior of the}} chassis. Transformers, large capacitors, tube sockets and other large components were mounted {{to the top of}} the chassis. Their wires were led through holes to the underside or interior. The ends of lengths of wire or wire-ended components such as capacitors and resistors were pushed through the terminals, and usually looped and twisted. When all wires to be connected had been fitted to the terminal, they were soldered together (and to the terminal).|$|R
50|$|The {{design of}} the Lynch motor {{armature}} is significantly different compared to other types of motor. The armature coils are formed from <b>insulated</b> copper <b>strips</b> each in a 'U' shape (like a tuning fork). One leg is then bent 45 degrees clockwise, while the other leg is bent 45 degrees anticlockwise. Each coil leg contains several bends before reaching {{the outside of the}} armature to be able to pass radially through the ferrite ring before the ends finish 90 degree apart. At the outer edge each copper strip has a crimp forming an electrical connection to its companion 90 degrees rotated. The inner edge of the copper strips have the insulation removed on the front face only, to form the commutator surface where the brushes make contact.|$|R

Aluminum oxide <b>insulated</b> wire or <b>strip</b> (with a melting point of 2050 C) is unique for {{applications in the}} electronic, missile, atomic reactor, aerospace, and aircraft industries. The oxide film is highly flexible, suitable for all windings of any {{size and shape of}} coil (magnetic). Briefly touched upon are the ultraviolet, proton gamma radiation uses, as well as high vacuum and cryogenic applications.

25|$|A magnetically {{shielded}} room (MSR) model {{consists of three}} nested main layers. Each of these layers is made of a pure aluminium layer, plus a high-permeability ferromagnetic layer, similar in composition to molybdenum permalloy. The ferromagnetic layer is supplied as 1mm sheets, while the innermost layer is composed of four sheets in close contact, and the outer two layers are composed of three sheets each. Magnetic continuity is maintained by overlay <b>strips.</b> <b>Insulating</b> washers {{are used in the}} screw assemblies to ensure that each main layer is electrically isolated. This helps eliminate radio frequency radiation, which would degrade SQUID performance. Electrical continuity of the aluminium is also maintained by aluminium overlay strips to ensure AC eddy current shielding, which is important at frequencies greater than 1Hz. The junctions of the inner layer are often electroplated with silver or gold to improve conductivity of the aluminium layers.|$|R
40|$|In this work, the {{classical}} and the quantum capacitances are calculated for a Fabry-Pérot interferometer {{operating in the}} integer quantized Hall regime. We first consider a rotationally symmetric electrostatic confinement potential and obtain the widths and the spatial distribution of the <b>insulating</b> (incompressible) circular <b>strips</b> using a charge density profile stemming from self-consistent calculations. Modelling the electrical circuit of capacitors composed of metallic gates and incompressible/compressible strips, we investigate the conditions to observe Aharonov-Bohm (quantum mechanical phase dependent) and Coulomb blockade (capacitive coupling dependent) effects reflected in conductance oscillations. In a last step, we solve the Schrödinger and the Poisson equations self-consistently in a numerical manner taking into account realistic experimental geometries. We find that, describing the conductance oscillations either by Aharanov-Bohm or Coulomb blockade strongly depends on sample properties also other than size, therefore, determining the origin of these oscillations requires further experimental and theoretical investigation.

40|$|The current {{distribution}} in zinc eleetrowinning cells was determined experimentally by weigh ing the deposited zinc {{and it was}} calculated using a mathemat ica l model. The Laplace equation was solved for a two-dimensional {{cross section of the}} intereleetrode space with boundary conditions corresponding to secondary {{current distribution}}. Good agreement was obtained between experimental and calculated data. The effect of changing the position of the cathode with respect to a fixed anode position was studied. When mov ing one cathode 50 mm in either direction, the current density {{at the end of the}} active w idth of the cathode varied f rom 20 to 180 % of the average current density. In this case some current flows between this cathode and the second nearest anode. Setting a cathode at an angle with respect to the anode had only a minor effect on current distribution. Depend ing on the thickness of the <b>insulating</b> edge <b>strips</b> the cathodic current density in some cases exhibited min ima close to the strips going f rom 90 to 130 % on the average for 2 mm thickness while no significant variation occurred for a 15 mm strip.

5000|$|Insulation of a {{sustainable}} home {{is important because}} of the energy it conserves throughout {{the life of the}} home. Well insulated walls and lofts using green materials are a must as it reduces or, in combination with a house that is well designed, eliminates the need for heating and cooling altogether. Installation of insulation varies according to the type of insulation being used. Typically, lofts are <b>insulated</b> by <b>strips</b> of <b>insulating</b> material laid between rafters. Walls with cavities are done in much the same manner. For walls that do not have cavities behind them, solid-wall insulation may be necessary which can decrease internal space and can be expensive to install. Energy-efficient windows are another important factor in insulation. Simply assuring that windows (and doors) are well sealed greatly reduces energy loss in a home. [...] Double or Triple glazed windows are the typical method to insulating windows, trapping gas or creating a vacuum between two or three panes of glass allowing heat to be trapped inside or out. Low-emissivity or Low-E glass is another option for window insulation. It is a coating on windowpanes of a thin, transparent layer of metal oxide and works by reflecting heat back to its source, keeping the interior warm during the winter and cool during the summer. Simply hanging heavy-backed curtains in front of windows may also help their insulation. “Superwindows,” mentioned in Natural Capitalism: Creating the Next Industrial Revolution, became available in the 1980s and use a combination of many available technologies, including two to three transparent low-e coatings, multiple panes of glass, and a heavy gas filling. Although more expensive, they are said to be able to insulate four and a half times better than a typical double-glazed windows.|$|R
