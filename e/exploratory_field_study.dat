40|$|Concerns over Information Technology security, {{including}} theft, {{fraud and}} abuse have forced organizations to take a cautious approach to Electronic Commerce. This research study suggests that organizations can keep secure their resources by implementing an effective and accurate identification system, which {{will enable them to}} provide a better service to their customers and to prevent individuals from misrepresenting themselves to the organization. Various means of identification are available, but the key focus should be to establish accurate identity. The research study addresses biometric identification methods as a means of improving the security of on-line transactions. The specific focus is an investigation of user perceptions with regard to biometric identification methods. The research study, through a theoretical understanding of the concepts found within the research problem statement, compiles a Technology Adoption Model for understanding why individuals accept or reject Information Technology innovations, which has proved {{to be one of the}} most challenging issues in Information Technology research. The <b>exploratory</b> <b>field</b> <b>study</b> section of the research study makes use of interpretive research as a basis to identify various themes related to user perceptions of biometrics. The themes identified are discussed during a focus group session with research participants. The main focus of the <b>exploratory</b> <b>field</b> <b>study</b> section is on user perceptions related to biometric identification methods and to enhance the Technology Adoption Model compiled by gathering user perceptions regarding the Internet, Electronic Business, biometrics and user adoption via a questionnaire to provide a possible solution for the research study problem statement. From the <b>exploratory</b> <b>field</b> <b>study,</b> it was concluded that user perceptions will play a role with regard to identification through biometrics within Electronic Business and that the social factors trust, security, and privacy considerations will also have to be taken into account.

40|$|Previous {{research}} has firmly established {{the importance of}} knowledge sharing in Research and Development (R 2 ̆ 6 amp;D) settings. However, current theories provide only fragmented insights into the origination of knowledge sharing, and thus offer limited guidance for knowledge management practices in R 2 ̆ 6 amp;D. To integrate and extend these fragmented insights, we undertook two <b>exploratory</b> <b>field</b> <b>studies</b> of knowledge sharing in industrial research organizations. The contributions {{of this study are}} the following. First, we introduce three dimensions that differentiate origination mechanisms for knowledge sharing. Second, we show that some of these mechanisms correspond to mechanisms assumed in particular streams of literature, whereas others have been neglected till now. Third, based on our <b>field</b> <b>studies,</b> we show that each of these knowledge-sharing mechanisms have a different value for industrial research practices.

40|$|Serious games can {{be defined}} simply as games with an {{educational}} intent. These games are regularly positioned within a curriculum as simple teaching agents and often lack meaningful participation from learners in their development. In 1992, Roger Hart proposed {{a model for the}} roles children play in participatory projects with adults. ‘Hart’s Ladder’ presents eight levels of children’s participation moving from tokenistic manipulation of children at the base of this ladder to ‘citizenship’ at the top where children can initiate and share activities with adults. This research contributes to knowledge on methods of integrating serious games into formal educational settings by investigating how children, as participants, can work with their educators, as facilitators, to create serious games for use by their peers. <b>Exploratory</b> <b>field</b> <b>studies</b> have worked with secondary school children (11 - 16 years) to evaluate the hypothesis that higher levels of participation of children in making serious games will produce more effective educational artefacts.

40|$|The {{subject of}} the study are telecentres, public places where people can access {{information}} through ICT, and which should fulfill the communication needs of the communities {{in which they are}} located. The central question of this thesis sprang from the study of the available literature and from nine <b>exploratory</b> <b>field</b> <b>studies</b> carried out in West Africa (in Burkina Faso, Benin, Guinea and Mali). This thesis aimed at developing a cognitive tool to capture the extra-technological dimensions, which have an impact onto sustainability, studying the awareness and the understanding that different social groups have of telecentres. The social groups taken into consideration are the representatives of the founding organization, local staff, users and non- users of a telecentre. The research was undertaken in South Africa, namely in 4 eGovernment telecentres, called Cape Access Centres, set up by the Western Cape Government in communities throughout the region. This thesis explored the adoption of the theory of social representation and concept mapping techniques in telecentre-related researches and developed a cognitive tool to study and analyze telecentre conceptualizations. This approach brought interesting results in deepening the knowledge the research community has of telecentres. Furthermore, the developed tool is a useful instrument to detect interesting case studies and to assess telecentres effectiveness...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – This paper aims to {{describe}} three <b>exploratory</b> <b>field</b> <b>studies</b> investigating which characteristics add to later {{time to market}} and/or low product functionality of newly developed products. The studies are conducted {{at the level of}} developments tasks, or work packages. The first and second studies investigate to what extent the unpredictability of the project’s outcome {{is the result of the}} unpredictability of the completion time of individual work packages, and of the instability of the total network of work packages. Design/methodology/approach – Statistical analysis of the empirical data about the progress of three design projects carried out in the development department of a high-tech capital equipment manufacturer was used. The third study examines the reasons that members of the product development teams in this firm give for the unpredictability of time and quality of the project’s outcome. Findings – The results result indicate the existence of three very different sources of unpredictability: the usual uncertainty about the duration of a design task, the discovery of unexpected new problems in a design task, and the reprioritization of a work package by project leaders due to new problems in other work packages. Originality/value – Together the three studies provide a detailed account of the operational characteristics of time-paced product development projects in a particular firm and suggest ways to effectively manage such a project...|$|R
40|$|Access to {{essential}} medicines is a core {{element of}} the effective health systems that are required to deal with endemic disease. Cost-effective access relies in turn on efficient market functioning and on appropriate polices towards the role of markets at national and international levels. This article argues that current international policy frameworks for promoting access to essential medicines lack coherence and display weak empirical foundations for proposed market interventions. A study of medicines markets in Tanzania questions some assumptions about market functioning underlying international policy, and shows how <b>exploratory</b> <b>field</b> <b>studies</b> can reduce the knowledge gap. Medicines policy should aim for rational use of essential medicines and for universal access free {{at the point of}} use to medicines essential to treat endemic diseases and other major causes of death. Unregulated retail market competition in essential medicines should be progressively constrained by government and NGO action. Wholesale market competition, in contrast, should be promoted, while the rebuilding of African pharmaceutical manufacturing is important for promoting and sustaining access. At each market level, public and non-governmental non-profit traders and providers can play a regulatory role alongside greater citizen information and civic activism. Copyright 2010 The author 2010.

40|$|In {{military}} training contexts, {{short and long}} term decisions, where survival and security are priori-tized, are intermixed. Simulation-based training, here applied to ground patrols in Afghanistan, can provide preparation for mission critical and life critical operations prior to exposure to real dan-ger. Optimising the effectiveness of simulation-based training raises the need for more detailed representations of the competences required, both for simulation design and for evaluating sim-ulation effectiveness. These needs are here con-sidered in terms of three research questions. The first research question asks how objects trigger dialogue in observational tasks. Eye gaze tracking and recorded dialogue provide a foun-dation for proposing the cognitive operational structures behind how objects and dialogue are structured when people work together when col-laborating in simulation-based training sessions. The objects are tracked along with related obser-vational tasks and the communication between people in a team in ground vehicles and in the Tactical Operations Centre (TOC). The second research question asks how the re-sults of simulation-based training for emergency situations can be described and evaluated. The last research question asks how debriefing and learning create and refine cognitive compre-hension, the competency developed in a group. Low level visual cognition in a tactical environ-ment is explored using an eye gaze tracking sys-tem integrated with a simulation environment. The integrated system has been evaluated, its accuracy characterized, and the system was then used to evaluate hypotheses related to visual queuing and target selection. The research questions are then explored more broadly based upon two <b>exploratory</b> <b>field</b> <b>studies</b> of simulation-based training sessions held for mili-tary staff before leaving for ISAF in Afghanistan. Study methods here include eye gaze tracking, video and audio recording, behavioral observa-tion and retrospective questions.

40|$|There is {{increased}} recognition in society about {{the urgency of}} taking life cycle considerations into account in industry, {{and a desire to}} let the market be a driving force in this process. Yet little is known about why companies engage in life cycle considerations and about the environmental interaction with the market. In this licentiate thesis, the premises for linking life cycle considerations with marketing in industry are discussed. Three research projects form the basis for the discussion: two <b>exploratory</b> <b>field</b> <b>studies</b> aimed at improving the understanding of life cycle considerations in industry, and a theoretical analysis comparing green and conventional marketing literature. Three basic premises for linking life cycle considerations with marketing are further analysed: their existence in the company, meeting points, and their interaction. To allow for continuous use of life cycle considerations in industry, commitment needs to be justified in a company perspective. This was done in the studied companies through an individual adaptation of LCA practice, where context and sense-making of individuals were identi¬fied as important to the shaping of life cycle work. After studying the literature, several possible areas where life cycle consi¬der¬ations and marketing could meet were identified, e. g. business strategy, product development and market communications. The <b>field</b> <b>studies</b> showed that life cycle related activities could be found in several of the departments in the studied companies. Yet these activities were rarely carried out with the life cycle perspective in mind, or linked to marketing activities. The most tangible link was found in the case of environmental information to consumers, for example through various types of environ¬men¬tal labels. Ecolabelling is also often put forward as a tool to advance greener production and consumption. From the literature review, however, it was concluded that there are reasons to explore also other marketing means. Suggestions for further research include how green market signals are collected, and how the perception of the consumer is built up and used within the company...|$|R
