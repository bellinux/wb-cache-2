5|$|Enderlin {{responded to}} Leconte and Jeambar in January 2005 in Le Figaro. He thanked them for rejecting that the scene had been staged. He had {{reported}} that the shots were fired by the Israelis because, he wrote, <b>he</b> <b>trusted</b> the cameraman, {{who had worked for}} France 2 since 1988. In the days following the shooting, other witnesses, including other journalists, offered some confirmation, he said. He added that the Israeli army had not responded to France 2's offers to cooperate with their investigation.|$|E
5|$|The {{top three}} drivers {{appeared}} on the podium to collect their trophies and in the subsequent press conference. Michael Schumacher revealed that his early pit stop was down to a possible sensor failure which caused his team to receive misinformation. He also added that the wet-weather conditions forced him to change the entire brake balance towards {{the front of his}} car. Barrichello said that he informed Ferrari technical director Ross Brawn that it would be quicker to make an extra pit stop had it rained for ten more laps. Nevertheless, he stated that <b>he</b> <b>trusted</b> his team in their judgement and revealed his car developed an clutch issue during the Grand Prix. Fisichella stated that he was driving a conservative race as he was on a one-stop strategy. Additionally, he praised the team for their achieving a continued run of consistent podium position finishes at the circuit.|$|E
5|$|Though the location, plan of attack, {{and timing}} were {{determined}} by Hitler, he blamed the defeat on his General Staff. Unlike Stalin, who gave his commanding generals the liberty to make important command decisions, Hitler's interference in German military matters progressively increased while {{his attention to the}} political aspects of the war decreased. The opposite was true for Stalin; throughout the Kursk campaign, <b>he</b> <b>trusted</b> the judgment of his commanders, and as their decisions led to battlefield success it increased his trust in their military judgment. Stalin stepped back from operational planning, only rarely overruling military decisions, resulting in the Red Army gaining more freedom of action {{during the course of the}} war.|$|E

25|$|As he rose {{to power}} {{as leader of the}} Nazi Party, Hitler was domineering and possessive of Raubal, keeping a tight rein on her. When he {{discovered}} in December 1927 that she was having a relationship with his chauffeur, Emil Maurice, he forced an end to the affair and dismissed Maurice from his personal service. After that he did not allow her to freely associate with friends and attempted to have himself or someone <b>he</b> <b>trusted</b> near her at all times, accompanying her on shopping trips, to the movies, and to the opera.|$|E
25|$|Augustinas Voldemaras, {{the first}} Prime Minister of Lithuania, {{did not believe}} that forming the {{military}} was a priority and advocated Lithuanian neutrality. <b>He</b> <b>trusted</b> that German mercenaries would protect Lithuania until the upcoming Paris Peace Conference could establish peace. Residents organized local self-defense units to defend themselves from retreating Germans. The first laws regarding the army were not issued until November 23. Some Lithuanians, who had served in the Russian army during the World War, returned to Lithuania and started organizing battalions in Kaunas, Hrodna, Alytus. They lacked guns, ammunition, and officers.|$|E
25|$|Between 41 and 44 CE, Iudaea regained its nominal autonomy, when Herod Agrippa {{was made}} King of the Jews by the emperor Claudius, thus {{in a sense}} {{restoring}} the Herodian Dynasty, {{though there is no}} indication Iudaea ceased to be a Roman province simply because it no longer had a prefect. Claudius had decided to allow, across the empire, procurators, who had been personal agents to the Emperor often serving as provincial tax and finance ministers, to be elevated to governing magistrates with full state authority to keep the peace. He elevated Iudaeas's procurator whom <b>he</b> <b>trusted</b> to imperial governing status because the imperial legate of Syria was not sympathetic to the Judeans.|$|E

25|$|Though {{aware of}} the {{weakness}} of his defense lines, Moreaux {{did not want to}} retreat, possibly because he was masking Jourdan's transfer of troops to the north. Kaiserslautern was held by the division of Jean-Jacques Ambert with eight battalions, a cavalry regiment and two squadrons of chasseurs à cheval. Many of the soldiers were raw recruits and some were not even armed. One of the few veteran battalions was commanded by Nicolas Oudinot. Anxious about the position, Moreaux sent Laurent Gouvion Saint-Cyr, an adjutant general whose advice <b>he</b> <b>trusted,</b> to look over the ground. Saint-Cyr advised Ambert to retreat but that general had orders to hold his ground though he had only 5,000 troops. Meanwhile, Möllendorf chose to make his main effort against Kaiserslautern.|$|E
25|$|Adolf Hitler {{personally}} {{selected for}} the counter-offensive on the northern shoulder of the western front the best troops available and officers <b>he</b> <b>trusted.</b> The lead role in the attack was given to Sepp Dietrich’s 6th Panzer Army, while the 5th Panzer Army was to attack to their south, covering their flank. The 6th Panzer Army was given priority for supply and equipment and were assigned the shortest route to the ultimate objective of the offensive, Antwerp. The 6th Panzer Army included the elite of the Waffen-SS, including four Panzer divisions and five infantry divisions in three corps. Hitler personally designated a group of , 128mm Jagdtiger tank destroyers from the 653rd Heavy Panzerjäger Battalion {{to assist with the}} attack, although their rail transport was held up by American air attacks.|$|E
25|$|Like French, Haig {{wanted to}} push along the North Sea Coast to Ostend and Zeebrugge but Joffre {{did not want}} the British acting so independently. Germany had {{recently}} sent eight infantry divisions to the Eastern Front, with twelve newly raised divisions, reducing their net strength in the west from 106 divisions at the time of First Ypres to 98, so French and Joffre, thinking that the war would be won by the summer, agreed that a French offensive in Artois and Champagne, should be accompanied by a British offensive at Neuve-Chapelle to be conducted by Haig, as <b>he</b> <b>trusted</b> him more than Smith-Dorrien, after the latter's failure at Messines in December. At Neuve Chapelle, Haig wanted a quick bombardment and his subordinate Henry Rawlinson (GOC IV Corps), a longer and more methodical one. Shortage of shells meant that only a thirty-five-minute bombardment was possible but the small front of the attack gave it the concentration to succeed.|$|E

25|$|At {{the same}} time, Scaliger had made {{numerous}} enemies. He hated ignorance, but he hated still more half-learning, {{and most of}} all dishonesty in argument or in quotation. Himself the soul of honour and truthfulness , he had no toleration for the disingenuous argument and the misstatements of facts of those who wrote to support a theory or to defend an unsound cause. His pungent sarcasm soon reached the ears of the persons who were its object, and his pen was not less bitter than his tongue. He was conscious of his power, and not always sufficiently cautious or sufficiently gentle in its exercise. Nor was he always right. <b>He</b> <b>trusted</b> much to his memory, which was occasionally treacherous. His emendations, if often valuable, were sometimes absurd. In laying the foundations of a science of ancient chronology he relied sometimes on groundless or even absurd hypotheses, often based on an imperfect induction of facts. Sometimes he misunderstood the astronomical science of the ancients, sometimes that of Copernicus and Tycho Brahe. And he was no mathematician.|$|E
25|$|Sun Hao {{turned out}} to be a cruel and superstitious tyrant. His {{subjects}} were hesitant in attempting to persuade him to mend his ways, but due to Teng Mu's honoured status, they often asked Teng Mu to help them present their proposals to Sun Hao because the emperor might be offended if they gave him advice directly. Sun Hao eventually grew tired of Teng Mu's suggestions and Empress Teng fell out of her husband's favour as a consequence. In 266, Sun Hao suddenly ordered Teng Mu to move to Cangwu (蒼梧; in present-day Wuzhou, Guangxi) — effectively sending the latter into exile — even though he did not strip the latter of his titles. Teng Mu died of distress on the journey to Cangwu. Sun Hao considered deposing Empress Teng as well but his superstitious beliefs worked in the empress's favour — his sorcerers (whom <b>he</b> <b>trusted)</b> told him that replacing the empress would lead to disaster for him. Sun Hao's mother, Empress Dowager He, also intervened by protecting and speaking up for Empress Teng. Empress Teng lived with her mother-in-law and rarely saw Sun Hao again but retained her authority as the empress. At the same time, Sun Hao gave empress signets to many of his other concubines.|$|E
25|$|Friedkin went to some {{extraordinary}} lengths, {{reminiscent of}} some directors {{from the old}} Hollywood directing style, manipulating the actors, to get the genuine reactions he wanted. Yanked violently around in harnesses, both Blair and Burstyn suffered back injuries and their painful screams went right into the film. Burstyn injured her back after landing on her coccyx when a stuntman jerked her around using a special effects cable during the scene when Regan slaps her mother. According to the documentary Fear of God: The Making of the Exorcist, however, the injury did not cause permanent damage, although Burstyn was upset the shot of her screaming in pain {{was used in the}} film. After asking Father William O'Malley if <b>he</b> <b>trusted</b> him and being told yes, Friedkin slapped him hard across the face before a take to generate a deeply solemn reaction that was used in the film as a very emotional Father Dyer read last rites to Father Karras; this offended the many Catholic crew members on the set. He also fired blanks without warning on the set to elicit shock from Jason Miller for one of the takes, and only told Miller that pea soup would hit him in the chest rather than the face concerning the projectile-vomiting scene, resulting in his disgusted reaction. Lastly, he had Regan's bedroom set built inside a freezer so that the actors' breath could be visible on camera, which required the crew to wear parkas and other cold-weather gear.|$|E
