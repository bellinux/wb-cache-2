After the group folded, Stipe and Hopper formed Oh-OK, whose line-up later included Matthew Sweet and David McNair. That project ended in 1984 and Hopper briefly belonged to a Washington, D.C. band named Holiday, who released their only EP in 1987.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{we propose}} a {{framework}} where functional requirements are traced from use case model to component model via analysis and design models. Here, {{components of the}} component models are derived by grouping and packaging <b>design</b> <b>classes</b> based {{on the type of}} analysis classes they are derived from. As there are three different types of analysis classes: boundary, controller and entity, the <b>design</b> <b>classes</b> derived from the corresponding analysis classes get classified at the first iteration. The components thus derived using this approach form the components of Model View Controller Architecture; different components having <b>design</b> <b>classes</b> of similar functionalities. This framework can be used to verify and ensure that use case flow of events is traced in analysis model and then to component model via design models. The architecture with the components designed using this framework also ensures separation of concerns, roles among the components to achieve high cohesion and low coupling.
