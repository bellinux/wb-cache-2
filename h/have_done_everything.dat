25|$|Looking at {{that picture}} today makes me cringe. It {{was done in}} the worst {{possible}} taste. Back then I was too immature to see that. Shame on me—I should <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>everything</b> in my power to stop it. The record company came up with the idea, I think. The lyrics incidentally were a take-off on Kiss, whom we had just supported on a tour. I was fooling around and played the riff of the song in the rehearsal room and spontaneously improvised 'cause he's a virgin killer!' trying to do a more or less way-off-the-mark Paul Stanley impersonation. Klaus immediately said 'that's great! You should do something with it.' Then I had the unenviable task of constructing a meaningful set of lyrics around the title, which I actually managed to do to some degree. But the song has a totally different meaning from what people would assume at first. Virgin Killer is none other than the demon of our time, the less compassionate side of the societies we live in today—brutally trampling upon {{the heart and soul of}} innocence.|$|E

She was ranked World No. 3 at that time. Graf said, [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>everything</b> I wanted to do in tennis. I feel I have nothing left to accomplish.

2500|$|Committee on Infractions {{head for}} the NCAA, Greg Sankey, stated [...] "While student-athletes likely benefited from the {{so-called}} ‘paper courses’ offered by North Carolina, the information available in the record did not establish that the courses were solely created, offered and maintained as an orchestrated effort to benefit student-athletes."

[...] Tyrone P.

But guess what? Maybe that’s not the N.C.A.A.’s job. This is something the schools have always self-regulated." ...|$|E
2500|$|Born at 11 Valley Road, an interwar {{council house}} in Grove Hill, Middlesbrough, Yorkshire, Brian Clough was the sixth of nine {{children}} of a local sweet shop worker, later sugar boiler and then manager.

[...] On his upbringing in Middlesbrough, Clough claimed that it was not the most well-appointed place in the world, [...] "But to me it was heaven". [...] "Everything I <b>have</b> <b>done,</b> <b>everything</b> I've achieved, everything that I can think of that has directed and affected my life – apart from the drink – stemmed from my childhood.

2500|$|On the day Scheller and Peters were sentenced, Maj. Herbert Strobel and Maj. August Kraft were {{summoned to}} Field Marshal Model's office in Oberirsen, {{unaware of the}} charges pending against them. Kraft and his {{commanding}} officer Strobel {{were in charge of}} the combat engineers in the Koblenz-Remagen sector covering [...] of the Rhine. Kraft, commander of III Landes Pi Battalion, had laid the charges on the Remagen bridge. Kraft was [...] away at the time the bridge was captured. Strobel had ordered Kraft to counterattack which had completely failed. On 17 March Hübner conducted a 20-minute trial for the two men at 11:00 AM. He quickly found them guilty and sentenced them to be executed immediately. The two men were given about 45 minutes to write to their families before they were escorted to a wooded site and executed at 1:00 PM with a bullet {{to the back of the}} head. The executioners emptied their pockets, tore up the family letters, covered their bodies with a few shovel-fulls of dirt, and left them where they fell. A sixth officer, 12th Regiment Engineer Commander Capt. Friesenhahn, had been captured but not convicted, as he was found by the court to <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>everything</b> within his power to destroy the bridge.|$|E
2500|$|Generally {{early action}} {{is similar to}} early {{decision}} except the decision is not binding, so a student could apply to multiple colleges. The time frame is similar: apply by early November, get a decision by mid-December, although specific deadlines vary by school. It allows a student to compare competing offers. The exception {{is that there are}} four colleges – Harvard, Princeton, Stanford, and Yale—which have a single-choice early action program, meaning that an applicant can only apply early action to one school. Early action can be the best choice for students who know they prefer one particular school and <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>everything</b> possible to secure admission since a student will know the result of the application sooner, and to varying extents allows a student to compare aid offers from different schools. One report suggested that non-binding early action programs continued to be highly popular, and noticed that three schools––Harvard, Princeton, and the University of Virginia—which had abandoned early admissions programs in 2006, reestablished them in 2011 after other colleges failed to follow their lead. Generally fewer schools offer the early action program but ones that do include Georgetown University, MIT, and Boston College. One account suggested that early action did not give as much of an [...] "admissions edge" [...] as early decision because it was non-binding.|$|E
2500|$|Emperor Taizong, {{for several}} years, had often {{suffered}} from severe illnesses, and Empress Zhangsun often attended to him day and night, carrying poison within her belt and resolving {{to commit suicide}} if the emperor should die. [...] Empress Zhangsun herself was said to suffer from severe asthma, and her conditions were exacerbated in 634 when she was ill, but nevertheless attended to Emperor Taizong when {{he was forced to}} {{wake up in the middle}} of the night and put on armor and weapons due to an emergency report by his brother-in-law, Chai Shao (柴紹) the Duke of Qiao. [...] By 636, her conditions were severe, and Li Chengqian suggested to her that, as the doctors appeared to <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>everything</b> they could, Emperor Taizong declare a general pardon and encourage commoners to become Buddhist or Taoist monks, to try to gain divine favor. [...] Empress Zhangsun, knowing that Emperor Taizong had long disapproved of Buddhism and Taoism and herself believing over use of pardons to be improper, refused. [...] Li Chengqian instead told the idea to the chancellor Fang Xuanling, who reported it to Emperor Taizong. [...] Emperor Taizong considered issuing a general pardon, but Empress Zhangsun again refused.

2500|$|During the war, an {{agreement}} between the SS and the Auswärtige Amt ruled that Jews from neutral or allied nations living in nations occupied by Germany could not be deported to the death camps unless the Auswärtige Amt gave its permission first. Papen claimed after the war to <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>everything</b> within his power to save Turkish Jews living in countries occupied by Germany from deportation to the death camps, but {{an examination of the}} Auswärtige Amts records do not support this claim. The German historian Corry Guttstadt wrote: [...] "As far as can be discerned from the extensive documentary materials, von Papen did not object once to the deportation of Turkish Jews from the occupied countries of Europe. In fact, he attempted several times to obtain the Turkish government's general consent to the deportation of its Jews. All von Papen did was to suggest a more adroit approach from time to time". During the war, Papen used his connections with Turkish Army officers with whom he served in World War I to try to influence Turkey into the joining the Axis; in addition, he frequently held parties at the German embassy which were attended by leading Turkish politicians; and to further facilitate his work, Papen had use of [...] "special funds" [...] to bribe anyone and everyone in Turkey who was dishonest enough to accept a bribe into following a pro-German line. Papen bribed the editors [...] of the Turkish newspapers with money from the [...] "special funds" [...] to print pro-Axis stories as a bid to win Turkish public opinion. As an ambassador to Turkey, Papen survived a Soviet assassination attempt on 24 February 1942 by agents from the NKVD: [...] a bomb exploded prematurely, killing the bomber and no-one else, although Papen was slightly injured. Papen's rival Knatchbull-Hugessen who often met him at official receptions commented that Papen's name was [...] "universally connected with all that was sharp and disreputable in diplomatic dealings", as everybody considered him an [...] "artful dodger" [...] who seemed [...] "quick and clever on the surface", but who always caused [...] "grave doubts" [...] for [...] "there was something terribly professional about his charm with all its virtuosity which bespoke considerable practice".|$|E
