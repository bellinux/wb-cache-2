25|$|As the 20th century progressed, {{trade on}} the Newcastle and Gateshead quaysides {{gradually}} declined, until by the eighties {{both sides of the}} river were looking rather derelict. Shipping company offices had closed along with offices of firms related to shipping. There were also derelict warehouses lining the riverbank. A decision was taken by local government to re-develop the Newcastle quayside and this was begun in the 1990s following a master plan. New offices, restaurants, bars and residential accommodation were built and the area has changed {{in the space of a}} few years into a vibrant area. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>ironic</b> <b>that</b> this development has partially returned the focus of Newcastle to the riverside, where it was in medieval times.|$|E
25|$|Cavalry {{were rarely}} {{used by the}} Assyrians or many other Mesopotamians until the 9th century BC, when their use is {{mentioned}} {{during the reign of}} Tukulti-Ninurta II. Before then, many nomads or steppe warriors relied on cavalry, who raided Assyrian lands. The Assyrians had to counter this mobile form of warfare and so beat their opponents, notably the Iranians, at their own game. Perhaps the greatest outside influence is that of the Iranian Medes. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>ironic</b> <b>that</b> the raiding by that people assisted Assyrian attempts in building a cavalry army with which to destroy the Kingdom of Elam. However, Assyrian attempts were not without difficulties; horse archers were used but could not use their bows and the reins of their horses at the same time. As a result, cavalry under Ashurnasirpal are depicted in pairs, with one rider holding both reins and the other shooting with a bow. The Assyrians experienced fewer problems with cavalry when they were deployed as lancers; under Tiglath Pileser III, the Assyrian Cavalry continued to be paired of but this time each warrior held his own lance and controlled his own horse. By the 7th century BC, mounted Assyrian warriors were well armed with a bow and a lance, and armored with lamellar armour, while their mounts were equipped with fabric armour, providing limited yet useful protection in close combat and against missiles. Cavalry were to form the core of the later Assyrian armies.|$|E
500|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>ironic</b> <b>that</b> Rifenburg {{was born}} in Petoskey, Michigan in 1926 for several reasons. [...] Ted Petoskey preceded Rifenburg as an All-American end on the University of Michigan {{football}} team. Petoskey had excelled {{as a representative of}} Saginaw County in MHSAA competition. Petoskey posted significant football accomplishments in 1926 making 1926 a significant year for himself as well. Achieving All-American status as an end at Michigan would be Rifenburg's next step after excelling in MHSAA competition.|$|E
2500|$|Šejna {{was granted}} asylum in the United States, {{much to the}} dismay of Soviet {{authorities}} and became an intelligence source for American agencies and policy makers.

50|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>ironic</b> <b>that</b> Ford {{ended up}} at Arkansas, since his {{replacement}} at Clemson was former Razorback head coach Ken Hatfield, who had had his own falling out with Arkansas athletic director Frank Broyles.

500|$|Another {{approach}} to critique {{taken in the}} classroom has been to propose the insignificance of female characters in the story as sexist. While Bilbo {{may be seen as}} a literary symbol of small folk of any gender, a gender-conscious approach can help students establish notions of a [...] "socially symbolic text" [...] where meaning is generated by tendentious readings of a given work. By this interpretation, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>ironic</b> <b>that</b> the first authorized adaptation was a stage production in a girls' school.|$|E
2500|$|Having written {{extensively}} about ID, philosopher of science Robert Pennock says [...] "When lobbying for ID in the public schools, wedge members sometimes deny that ID makes any claims about {{the identity of the}} designer. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>ironic</b> <b>that</b> their political strategy leads them to deny God in the public square more often than Peter did." ...|$|E
2500|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>ironic</b> <b>that,</b> {{although}} famous Lautner {{works like}} the Carling and Harpel houses, the Chemosphere and the Sheats Goldstein Residence have become inextricably linked with Los Angeles {{in the public}} imagination, Lautner repeatedly expressed his dislike of California.

5000|$|Edward Herrmann portrayed Eastman in {{the film}} Reds (1981), {{directed}} by and starring Warren Beatty, {{which was based on}} the life of John Reed. John Patrick Diggins, Eastman's biographer, said <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>ironic</b> <b>that</b> Herrmann <b>was</b> cast as Eastman, who was an extremely handsome man, while the good-looking Beatty portrayed Reed, who had a bookish appearance.|$|R
50|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>ironic</b> <b>that</b> both <b>were</b> {{famous as}} Shakespearean actors: in an America that {{had yet to}} {{establish}} its own theatrical traditions, the way to prove its cultural prowess was to do Shakespeare {{as well as the}} British, and even to claim that Shakespeare, had he been alive at the time, would have been, at heart at least, an American.|$|R
5000|$|Dodd died {{of cancer}} in Baton Rouge General Medical Center. Death came at 6 a.m. {{on the day of the}} Edwin Edwards-David Duke gubernatorial showdown. Had he been able to {{comprehend}} fully, Dodd would have surely known the outcome of <b>that</b> battle, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>ironic</b> <b>that</b> this [...] "political man" [...] would die on the day of one of the most contentious elections in Louisiana history.|$|R
2500|$|George Crile III, {{author of}} the book on which the film is based, wrote that the mujahideen's victory in Afghanistan {{ultimately}} opened a power vacuum for bin Laden: [...] "By the end of 1993, in Afghanistan itself there were no roads, no schools, just a destroyed country—and the United States was washing its hands of any responsibility. It was in this vacuum that the Taliban and Osama bin Laden would emerge as the dominant players. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>ironic</b> <b>that</b> a man who had almost {{nothing to do with the}} victory over the Red Army, Osama bin Laden, would come to personify the power of the jihad." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{light of}} all that has happened, it appears {{inappropriate}} for the MEC to deny {{the request of the}} local 14th medical examiner district to defer any further action until Dr. Siebert has been afforded the opportunity through normal proceedings to both defend his findings and refute the allegations against him as due process requires. ... Imposing sanctions against a medical examiner without requiring these theories to be tested by an impartial jury jeopardizes the independent judgment of the medical examiner that our system of government has come to rely upon precisely because of its independent objective inquiry. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>ironic</b> <b>that</b> in Dr. Siebert's case the medical examiner has been denied the very protection that his presence in such judicial proceedings is meant to provide.|$|E
2500|$|Since Millikan's work formed some of {{the basis}} for modern {{particle}} physics, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>ironic</b> <b>that</b> he was rather conservative in his opinions about 20th century developments in physics, {{as in the case}} of the photon theory. Another example is that his textbook, as late as the 1927 version, unambiguously states the existence of the ether, and mentions Einstein's theory of relativity only in a noncommittal note at the end of the caption under Einstein's portrait, stating as the last in a list of accomplishments that he was [...] "author of the special theory of relativity in 1905 and of the general theory of relativity in 1914, both of which have had great success in explaining otherwise unexplained phenomena and in predicting new ones." ...|$|E
40|$|During {{the recent}} oil price ‘crisis’ <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>ironic</b> <b>that</b> the UK’s Chancellor of the Exchequer, while castigating OPEC’s members {{for failing to}} produce enough oil to bring prices down, ignored the UK’s role since the early 1990 s {{as one of the}} top- 10 global oil producers.

2500|$|Japanese {{companies}} {{are known for}} management methods such as [...] "The Toyota Way". Kaizen ( [...] , Japanese for [...] "improvement") is a Japanese philosophy that focuses on continuous improvement throughout all aspects of life. When applied to the workplace, Kaizen activities continually improve all functions of a business, from manufacturing to management and from the CEO to the assembly line workers. By improving standardized activities and processes, Kaizen aims to eliminate waste (see Lean manufacturing). Kaizen was first implemented in several Japanese businesses during the country's recovery after World War II, including Toyota, and has since spread to businesses throughout the world. Within certain value systems, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>ironic</b> <b>that</b> Japanese workers labor amongst the most hours per day, even though kaizen is supposed to improve all aspects of life.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{aircraft}} produced {{under this}} system was the S.E.1, ostensibly a refurbishment of a Blériot XII. This {{was destroyed in}} a crash before flight testing was complete, killing Ridge. In the hands of Geoffrey de Havilland the Voisin which had been donated to the Army Air Battalion by the Duke of Westminster was reborn as the B.E. 1, a neat biplane with an excellent performance which first took to the air in December 1911, and this was followed rapidly {{by a series of}} similar aircraft, ostensibly improvements of the motley collection of aircraft in the Factory's possession, which in some cases did not even retain the original engine. [...] <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>ironic</b> <b>that</b> the first visible fruits of a programme intended to bring order to chaos were the result of a subversion of the system.|$|E
2500|$|The Loebner Prize tests {{conversational}} intelligence; {{winners are}} typically chatterbot programs, or Artificial Conversational Entities (ACE)s. Early Loebner Prize rules restricted conversations: Each entry and hidden-human conversed {{on a single}} topic, thus the interrogators were restricted to one line of questioning per entity interaction. The restricted conversation rule was lifted for the 1995 Loebner Prize. Interaction duration between judge and entity has varied in Loebner Prizes. In Loebner 2003, at the University of Surrey, each interrogator was allowed five minutes to interact with an entity, machine or hidden-human. Between 2004 and 2007, the interaction time allowed in Loebner Prizes was more than twenty minutes. In 2008, the interrogation duration allowed was five minutes per pair, because the organiser, Kevin Warwick, and coordinator, Huma Shah, consider {{this to be the}} duration for any test, as Turing stated in his 1950 paper: [...] " ... making the right identification after five minutes of questioning". They felt Loebner's longer test, implemented in Loebner Prizes 2006 and 2007, was inappropriate for the state of artificial conversation technology. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>ironic</b> <b>that</b> the 2008 winning entry, Elbot from Artificial Solutions, does not mimic a human; its personality is that of a robot, yet Elbot deceived three human judges that it was the human during human-parallel comparisons.|$|E
2500|$|In 2005, the Swans {{came under}} {{enormous}} public scrutiny, even from AFL CEO Andrew Demetriou, for their unorthodox, [...] "boring" [...] defense-oriented tactics that included tightly controlling the tempo {{of the game}} and starving the opposition of possession (in fact, seven teams that season had their lowest possession total whilst playing against the Swans). Swans coach Paul Roos maintained that playing contested football was the style used by all recent Premiership-winning teams, and felt <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>ironic</b> <b>that</b> the much criticised strategy proved ultimately successful.|$|R
5000|$|Shipton wrote <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>ironic</b> <b>that</b> [...] "All for the Beatles" [...] {{approached}} Beatlemania by adapting a Rolling Stones hit. [...] "Borrowing unashamedly from <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{calculated to}} put everyone who {{heard it in}} mind of the 'British Invasion'." [...] Nilsson sang [...] "in an Americanized approximation of John Lennon," [...] but the main guitar solo was {{very similar to that}} of Keith Richards. Shipton concludes that the song is the first real example of Nilsson's preference for overdubbing, which he perfected during his career, to take-up with the close harmony of The Beatles.|$|R
500|$|... "Everybody" [...] was commercially {{released}} as Madonna's first single in October 6, 1982, and {{came with a}} Lou Beach-designed sleeve depicting a hip hop–style NYC street scene. Because of the ambiguous nature of the record sleeve and the R groove of the song, Madonna was widely {{believed to be a}} black artist when the single was released. According to Matthew Lindsay of The Quietus, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>ironic</b> <b>that</b> the record sleeve did not depict Madonna on the cover, as she would become [...] "the face of the 80s." ...|$|R
2500|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>ironic</b> <b>that</b> an {{acclaimed}} biblical novel, {{one that}} would rival the Bible in popularity during the Gilded Age, {{was inspired by a}} discussion with a noted agnostic and written by an author who was never a member of any church. Its publication prompted speculation about Wallace’s faith. Wallace claimed that when he began writing Ben-Hur, he was not [...] "in the least influenced by religious sentiment" [...] and [...] "had no convictions about God or Christ", but he was fascinated by the biblical story of the three Magi's journey to find Jesus, king of the Jews. After extensive studies of the Bible and the Holy Land, and well before he had completed the novel, Wallace became a believer in God and Christ. In his autobiography Wallace acknowledged:In the very beginning, before distractions overtake me, I wish to say that I believe absolutely in the Christian conception of God. As far as it goes, this confession is broad and unqualified, and it ought and would be sufficient were it not that books of mine—Ben-Hur and The Prince of India—have led many persons to speculate concerning my creed ... I am not a member of any church or denomination, nor have I ever been. Not that churches are objectionable to me, but simply because my freedom is enjoyable, and I do not think myself good enough to be a communicant.|$|E
5000|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>ironic</b> <b>that</b> the 1st Arkansas Infantry, {{the parent}} {{unit of the}} 153rd Infantry Regiment were {{stationed}} in this same area of New Mexico ninety years earlier during General [...] "Black Jack" [...] Pershing's punitive Mexican Expedition against Pancho Villa.|$|E
5000|$|Eugenio di Savoia {{was built}} by Ansaldo, Genoa, and named after Prince Eugene of Savoy. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>ironic</b> <b>that</b> both Eugenio di Savoia and her Kriegsmarine namesake [...] honour a general who was such a staunch ally of the British in an earlier era.|$|E
50|$|While in drydock, an {{additional}} 2 in of steel {{was added to}} the main deck over the magazines. This reflected the lessons from the sinking of Hood {{as well as of the}} effectiveness of dive bombers at the Battle of Midway. Four 6-inch (152 mm) guns were replaced by two more four-barrelled anti-aircraft pompoms, reflecting the awareness of the greater risk posed by aircraft than by torpedo armed destroyers. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>ironic</b> <b>that</b> Ramillies faced such a surface attack later in the war. Fortunately the remaining 6-inch (152 mm) guns were sufficient to handle it.|$|R
5000|$|... "Everybody" [...] was commercially {{released}} as Madonna's first single in October 6, 1982, and {{came with a}} Lou Beach-designed sleeve depicting a hip hop-style NYC street scene.

50|$|Feyer graduated, aged 23, in 1932 {{and caused}} a minor scandal by turning to pop music full-time. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>ironic</b> <b>that</b> {{he became a}} pianist after having been a student of {{composition}} and conducting, whereas his classmate Georg Solti, a piano prodigy, {{became one of the}} world's most acclaimed conductors.|$|E

5000|$|When Parallax (Kyle Rayner) brought Hal Jordan to Qward, {{the entire}} Sinestro Corps {{attacked}} him.

When Lau was awarded the Israel Prize in May 2005, there were protests from the Masorti and Reform movements in Israel. Non-Orthodox leaders noted <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>ironic</b> <b>that</b> Lau <b>was</b> being honored for [...] "bridging rifts in Israeli society".
