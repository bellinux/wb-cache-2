These qualities determine which type of mission or missions they are best suited for.|$|E
50|$|Packard's new Ultramatic model {{introduced}} {{in the middle of}} the 1954 model year, was officially called: Gear-Start Ultramatic Drive, offering a new selector sequence on the column shift: 'D', for Drive, placed in between High, now represented with a simple dot, and Low (PN•DLR). In this new <b>DRIVE</b> <b>range,</b> it would use the low ratio and torque converter to start off, switching to the high ratio and ultimately to direct drive as the car accelerated; effectively automating what many Packard drivers had been doing manually with the older Ultramatic Drive.|$|E

50|$|When {{starting}} out in <b>Drive</b> <b>range,</b> low gear was automatically selected {{and the low}} band applied under pressure modulated by a vacuum modulator which sensed engine output and adjusted clutch and band apply pressures to provide smooth engagement without slip. As the vehicle accelerated, rear pump output would increase and initiate a shift to direct. The rear pump pressures were modified by a throttle valve, and governor, both of which could delay the upshift, or even trigger a forced downshift at driver command. Full throttle downshifts were achieved by the throttle valve which permitted the transmission to stay in low range or be forced into downshifting to speeds between 45 - 50 mph. At speeds under 35 mph, heavy throttle would delay upshifts, or initiate a forced 'detent touch' kickdown for better performance. When Low Range or Reverse are selected, the apply pressures are not modulated and the full line pressure of the transmission is applied to ensure positive engagement. The multiple plate reverse clutch and double wrap low band design offered a slight buffer to engagement to prevent harshness even under high apply pressures. A quite sophisticated valve body timed shifts and apply pressures carefully in <b>Drive</b> <b>range</b> to ensure smoothness and prevent 'hunting' between gears, which is a common complaint of small cars with automatic transmission. Corvair Powerglides had a good reputation for reliability and were ordered on {{a large majority of}} Corvair passenger cars.|$|E
50|$|More {{upmarket}} {{models were}} designated 1308 (1508 in some markets) and 1309. All {{of the models}} replaced the Simca 1301/1501 range in France, while on the British market it was sold alongside the ageing Hillman Hunter, a rear-wheel <b>drive</b> <b>range</b> of saloons and estates which would continue until 1979. This type of car was generally more popular in Britain in 1975, with the best selling cars in this sector being the Ford Cortina and Morris Marina. The Chrysler Alpine was first sold in Britain in January 1976, going on sale just after the similar-sized Vauxhall Cavalier, a rear-wheel drive saloon which went on to consistently outsell it.|$|E
5000|$|Output of the 240 {{engine was}} {{increased}} from [...] @ 5,750 r.p.m. to [...] at 5,500 rpm. and torque was increased. It {{now had a}} straight-port type cylinder head and twin HS6 SU carburettors with a new inlet manifold. The automatic transmission was upgraded to a Borg-Warner 35 dual <b>drive</b> <b>range.</b> Power steering by Marles Varamatic was now available on the 340. Servicing intervals were increased from 2000 mi to 3000 mi. There was a slight reshaping of the rear body and slimmer bumpers and over-riders were fitted. For {{the first time the}} 2.4 litre model could exceed 100 mph, resulting in a slight sales resurgence.|$|E

50|$|The British car {{designer}} Roy Axe, {{who originally}} {{started his career}} with Rootes, was responsible for unifying the designs of the new European range starting with the 1975 Simca 1307 hatchback, which was sold in the UK as the Chrysler Alpine. It was voted European Car of the Year for 1976. The 1307/Alpine was a five-door hatchback with front-wheel drive, in a market sector which was still almost exclusively populated by rear-wheel drive saloons like the Ford Cortina/Taunus and Opel Ascona (Vauxhall Cavalier in the UK). Chrysler decided to keep the Hillman Hunter, a rear-wheel <b>drive</b> <b>range</b> of saloons and estates, in production for the UK market as a traditional alternative to the Alpine, production finally finishing in 1979 just after Peugeot took over.|$|E
50|$|General Motors enjoyed an upturn in Britain {{during the}} 1980s, as its Vauxhall-badged cars {{increased}} their {{market share and}} the company's image also improved. At the beginning of 1980, it replaced the Viva with a new front-wheel <b>drive</b> <b>range</b> of hatchback and estates - the Astra, which was built in Britain and also in Opel factories on the continent. The MK2 Cavalier was launched in 1981, and became the company's best selling car of the decade. Its replacement for the Chevette was the Nova, a rebadged version of the Spanish built Opel Corsa, which was launched in 1983. The MK2 Astra was voted European Car of the Year shortly after its launch in 1984, as was the flagship MK2 Carlton (Opel Omega on the continent) two years later.|$|E
5000|$|In June 1991 {{the last}} update of the Delta went on sale, almost twelve {{years after its}} 1979 début. The front-wheel <b>drive</b> <b>range</b> was reduced to three models, LX, GT i.e. and HF turbo; {{all three of them}} had gained body-colour side skirts, dual body-colour wing mirrors, athermic glass, {{electric}} windows and seat belts. LX and GT i.e. donned a chrome grille, the louvered bonnet from the HF integrale 8v and optional 8-spoke diamond-cut alloy wheels from the Dedra. Updated colour and trim included green and blue [...] "Metallescente" [...] mica paint and glen plaid cloth upholstery. The Delta LX abandoned the 1.3 in favour of a revised version of the 1.5-litre engine.Dual round headlights and the domed, vented bonnet from the HF integrale 16v made the HF turbo look almost like an HF integrale.|$|E

50|$|After {{its first}} year, the Ultramatic Drive became {{available}} on all Packard models, {{and was immediately}} popular. It continued with a Packard program of modifications to improve reliability until 1954, when it underwent a major upgrade to both the power transfer and hydraulic control components reconfigured to give low gear starts automatically in the added <b>Drive</b> <b>range.</b> Many Packard owners had complained of lackluster acceleration, and had discovered that starting off in Low ratio and switching to High {{while on the move}} gave a much brisker pickup, but the Ultramatic handled the manual shift from low to high poorly. By 1954, both the Borg-Warner and Chevrolet Powerglide in addition to the aforementioned Hydramatic and Chrysler's new PowerFlite, performed ratio switches automatically while Buick's Dynaflow continued using high gear starts until its demise after the 1963 model year.|$|E
5000|$|In {{his review}} of Hiaasen's later novel Skinny Dip, Michael Grunwald made several {{references}} to the characters of Sick Puppy: [...] Carl Hiaasen is South Florida's literary proctologist: he examines the region's assholes. The rapacious villains of Hiaasen's crime novels do not just commit murder, extortion, assault, fraud, and every conceivable variety of larceny; they also park in handicapped spaces, cheat on their trophy wives, tell racist jokes, flaunt their wealth in unusually obnoxious ways, and mangle the lyrics to good rock-and-roll songs. They do not just do bad things, like steal wheelchairs, shoot cops, and scam retirees; they are bad people, [...] "maggots," [...] "vermin," [...] "cretins," [...] "sleazeballs," [...] "sewer scum," [...] "reprobates," [...] "whorehoppers." [...] They care more about their golf games than their families, and more about money than anything else on earth. They <b>drive</b> <b>Range</b> Rovers with [...] "COJONES" [...] on their vanity plates. They don't listen and they don't learn.|$|E
5000|$|In 1955, Packard {{switched}} to a new V8 engine from its traditional straight-8, and launched a new evolution of its automatic transmission at the same time, the Twin-Ultramatic Drive. McFarland, his assistant John DeLorean, and their team were {{not satisfied with the}} improved pick-up of the Gear-Start Ultramatic, and modified the angle of the converter [...] "pump" [...] to allow a higher stall speed thus increasing the torque multiplication better suited to the torque curve of the new V8 engines. In addition, a slightly higher stall converter was produced for the sportier Caribbean model due to its use of two four-barrel carburetors. The Gear-Start's ability to start in low range and switch to high automatically was retained, but the selector quadrant indicator was altered and PN•DLR became PN'D'LR to better reflect the dual <b>drive</b> <b>range</b> capability of this transmission, all the better to compete with the Dual-Range Hydra-Matic. Functionality was the same; the first Drive position, to left of the 'D equated to High on the Gear-Start Ultramatic, while the second, situated to the right of D', was equivalent to the Drive position on the Gear-Start, giving the driver the option of starting in either High or Low with automatic upshifts, ending with Direct Drive engagement of the torque converter, thus the Twin- designation referred to this dual Drive capability.|$|E
