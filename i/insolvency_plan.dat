40|$|By giving further {{effect to}} the European Convention on Human Rights,the Human Rights Act 1998 {{has had a}} {{significant}} effect on property law. Article 1 of the First Protocol to the Convention is particularly important, as it protects against the interference with the enjoyment of possessions. Compulsory acquisition, <b>insolvency,</b> <b>planning,</b> taxation, environmental regulation, and landlord and tenant laws {{are just some of the}} fields where the British and European courts have already had to assess the impact of the Protocol on private property. The Human Rights Act 1998 also restricts the scope of property rights, as some Convention rights conflict with rights of private property. For example, the Article 8 right to respect for the home has been used to protect against environmental harm, in some cases at the expense of property and economic rights. This book seeks to provide a structured approach to the extensive case law of the European Court of Human Rights and the UK courts on these issues, and to provide guidance on the direction the law is likely to take in future. Chapters cover the history and drafting of the relevant Convention rights, the scope and structure of the rights (especially Article 1 of the First Protocol), and how, through the Human Rights Act 1998, the Convention rights have already affected and are likely to affect developments in selected areas of English law...|$|R

50|$|Arcandor {{filed for}} {{bankruptcy}} on 9 June 2009. On 12 April 2010 the board of creditors agreed to the <b>insolvency</b> <b>plan</b> proposed by the insolvency administrator Klaus Hubertus Görg which envisaged a sale of the Karstadt department stores as a single entity to an investor and the waiver by the creditors of {{a large part of}} their demands. Some municipalities initially refused to agree to the required waiver of business tax payments. Four parties expressed interest in purchasing the Karstadt stores: the German-Swedish investor group Triton, Whitehall together with the Borletti Group and the German financial investor Nicolas Berggruen. Metro AG also expressed interest, but only in the acquisition of certain lucrative and strategically interesting Karstadt stores, which it intended to combine with its own Kaufhof stores into the “Deutsche Warenhaus AG”.|$|E
30|$|At most {{three months}} after the {{beginning}} of the insolvency procedure, the insolvency administrator reports on the potential future options for the bankrupt firm at the creditors’ meeting (Sec. 156 InsO). On the basis of this report, creditors decide to liquidate and shut down the firm or to continue the firm. Furthermore, they can enable the insolvency administrator to devise an <b>insolvency</b> <b>plan</b> (Sec. 157 InsO). The main purpose of such an <b>insolvency</b> <b>plan</b> is the development of a detailed proposal on how the bankrupt firm can be reorganized.|$|E

The pension plan deficit is a debt of the company, with explicit funding requirements and priority in the event of company <b>insolvency.</b> Pension <b>plan</b> deficits and options on future deficits and surpluses affect investment incentives as does the size and composition of company debt. We examine incentives for the firm to pay dividends rather than fund the pension plan and incentives to overfund the pension plan.

40|$|After a {{long period}} of {{prosperity}} and steady economic growth, the world's leading economies are now in crisis, and although there will be debate about its origins, the scale and seriousness of the crisis is in no doubt. There is also no doubt that excessive amounts of consumer credit, allied to a weak understanding of how globalised credit markets might react to a crisis, have played a significant part. This book, which is primarily about credit, debt and the trouble they have led to, is written by authors who have specialised in researching into over-indebtedness, that is, situations in which an individual's debt burden has become overwhelming. For these authors the plight of individuals is a primary concern, but the wider issue is how credit is used and how it changes societies. The essays in this volume, addressing topics which are fundamental {{to our understanding of the}} current crisis, range widely across the whole sector of consumer finance, including mortgages, 'credit-binges', the regulation of consumer lending, <b>insolvency,</b> repayment <b>plans,</b> debt counselling and much more besides. The conclusions drawn from the book are equally wide-ranging, but above all the lesson learned from these essays is that the financialisation of contemporary life ensures that issues of the appropriate role of credit remain of critical importance in society. ...|$|R
40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) insures the pensions of nearly 44 million private sector workers in over 30, 000 employer-sponsored defined benefit pension plans. Established in 1974 as a self-financing government corporation, PBGC's primary responsibility is to insure, under statutory limits, the pension benefits of participants in covered private defined benefit plans. PBGC collects premiums from the sponsors of defined benefit pension plans and administers plans that are terminated for reasons such as <b>plan</b> <b>insolvency</b> or bankruptcy. In {{the event of a}} termination, PBGC assumes control of plan assets, determines plan benefit liabilities, and pays benefits as guaranteed by statute. In fiscal year 2006, about 612, 000 plan participants and beneficiaries received $ 4. 1 billion in benefit payments from PBGC. An additional 659, 000 participants in plans already trusteed by the corporation will receive benefits from PBGC when they become eligible to retire. An increase in underfunded plan terminations in recent years increased the number of plan participants receiving and eligible for benefit payments. In 2005, PBGC reorganized, creating an additional legal department called the Office of the Chief Counsel, and placed this new office under the Chief Insurance Program Officer. The Chief Counsel was given the responsibility for overseeing legal issues pertaining to PBGC's core mission functions, such as negotiations involving terminations resulting from bankruptcies, while the General Counsel retained responsibility for such general law issues as ethics, procurement, and personnel law. Concerns have been raised, however, that this organizational change, a decentralization of legal functions, has affected the uniformity of PBGC's legal opinions, because there is no single chief legal officer ultimately responsible for overseeing all programmatic or regulatory issues. Because of these concerns, and in light of PBGC's growing workload, you asked us to examine the effect the reorganization of the corporation's legal functions into separate offices has had on PBGC's operations. Accordingly, we assessed whether the reorganization has (1) clearly defined the roles and responsibilities of PBGC's legal offices and (2) ensured that consistent legal advice is provided to the PBGC Director. ...|$|R
30|$|According to German {{bankruptcy}} law, an insolvency administrator’s compensation {{depends on}} {{the total amount of}} the insolvency assets realized in the insolvency procedure and on the compensation parameters defined by the insolvency code. The monetary compensation is typically defined as a share of the realized assets (Sec. 1 et seq. Insolvenzrechtliche Verguetungsverodnung (InsVV)). From this compensation, the insolvency administrator has to pay his general administrative costs (Sec. 4 InsVV). However, {{in the event of a}} highly complex procedure, a reorganization of the firm or a preparation of an <b>insolvency</b> <b>plan,</b> the insolvency court can individually adjust the compensation parameters (Sec. 3 InsVV and Haarmeyer et al. (2007), to Sec. 3, Note 8 et seq.).|$|E
40|$|Unitary {{insolvency}} proceeding was {{the core}} of insolvency code reformation, {{that has been in}} effect since 1991. This law replaced former bankruptcy code and compensation code. The pattern was set by American Chapter 11 US Bankruptcy codes. One of the main goals was to create legal system that would enable to reorganize companies in difficulties and so protect values and jobs. German insolvency law proposes in fact two reorganisation modes. Reorganization according to an <b>insolvency</b> <b>plan</b> and transferred reorganization (asset deals). Especially the transferred reorganization is very popular in practise because of quite fast process and risk and former burden elimination. Twenty years application of this legal regulation proved the insolvency code application in practise. The insolvency code provided many companies second chance. In spite of that, a critical approach is necessary as well as realisation of limits and problems that appear in practise. Two decades experience with companies' reorganization in Germany could be an inspiration for solving critical situations in Czech companies and for Czech insolvency law as well. reorganization, reorganizace, insolvency law, company crisis, German insolvency code, reorganization plan, insolvenční zákon, podniková krize, německý insolvenční řád, plán reorganizace...|$|E
