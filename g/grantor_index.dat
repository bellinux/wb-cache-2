2500|$|The 1870-71 Evansville City Directory {{shows that}} Henry Hart was a barber, with shop located at 25 Locust Street and {{residence}} on Oak Street between 7th and 8th Streets. [...] The latter property matches a deed dated June 25, 1870, {{for real estate}} sold to Henry Hart for $1300.00. The card catalogs for Vanderburgh County Grantee Index of Deeds and <b>Grantor</b> <b>Index</b> of Deeds show that during the years 1870 to 1908 there were several property transactions in which individual grantors were Henry, Sarah, and Angeline.|$|E
50|$|A grantor-grantee {{index is}} a general term for two lists of real {{property}} transfers maintained in alphabetical order of the last name of the parties transferring the property. One list is the <b>grantor</b> <b>index,</b> an alphabetic list of sellers (grantors). The other list is the grantee index, an alphabetic list of purchasers (grantees).|$|E

50|$|In {{municipalities}} with a {{large population}} and states that do not support tract indices, the Grantor/Grantee method can be time consuming and difficult altogether due to common names within the index. In these municipalities, a geographic index is often created to aid in title searching. In this system, each document is posted in both a <b>Grantor</b> and Grantee <b>index</b> {{in addition to being}} posted to indexes describing attributes of the property's location such as a lot number, subdivision name or Parcel Identification Number (PIN). With a functioning geographic index, a search can be done with a combination of a Grantor/Grantee, Legal Description or PIN search.|$|R
5000|$|A Grantor/Grantee {{title search}} {{attempts}} to locate records by searching the parties listed on a recorded instrument. One approach to conducting a full Grantor/Grantee title search starts by searching the <b>grantor</b> <b>index</b> in the County records and determining {{the name of}} the first recorded owner of title. This is usually the sovereign, which is the Federal Government or the Crown of the nation which owned a former colony now located within the United States. The search finds the grant from the sovereign to the first grantee. This is usually {{in the form of a}} patent. Then, the grantee's name is searched in the <b>grantor</b> <b>index</b> to find the deed by which it has subsequently conveyed the title, and so forth until no more grants are found. Liens or encumbrances granted by any of the parties shown on recorded instruments are also found in the search. Though theoretically accurate, this approach has practical difficulties due to there often being numerous grants from the sovereign. Therefore, an alternative method is to reverse the process, i.e. to search backward in the grantee index. This is done by beginning with {{the name of the}} person or entity who is thought to own the land to find the grantor to it. Then the grantee index is searched again to find the source of that grantor's title, and so on until you reach the grant from the sovereign. These linkages from grantor to grantee are called the [...] "chain of title." [...] The last grantee found is the [...] "record title holder." ...|$|E
50|$|In {{a typical}} {{county in the}} United States, the index is kept by an {{official}} known as the County Recorder (or the Recorder of Deeds). Transfers are not necessarily listed in strict alphabetical order, but are often placed chronologically in a letter index corresponding to the first letter of the party's last name. In the <b>grantor</b> <b>index,</b> the alphabetic order of entries is by the grantors' last names. In each entry, {{the name of the}} grantee (purchaser) is then given, along with the location of the affected parcel and the volume and page number where the full text of the deed or other recorded instrument describing the transfer may be found. In the grantee index, the order of entries is by the grantees' last names, and each entry provides the same identifying information for the recorded instrument.|$|E
5000|$|A deed that is recorded, {{but is not}} {{connected}} to the chain of title of the property, is called a wild deed. A wild deed does not provide constructive notice to later purchasers of the property, because subsequent bona fide purchasers cannot reasonably be expected to locate the deed while investigating the chain of title to the property. Haupt has stated thatBecause title searching relies on the grantor/grantee indexes, it's possible that a deed won't be discovered {{even though it was}} recorded. [...] "Example: Atwood sells his land to Burns, but Burns does not record his deed. Burns later sells the land to Cooper, and Cooper records her deed. But because the previous deed (the deed from Atwood to Burns) was not recorded, Cooper's deed is outside the chain of title. In a title search, someone looking up Atwood's name in the <b>grantor</b> <b>index</b> would find no indication that Atwood conveyed the property, and nothing would lead the searcher to Cooper's deed." [...] A deed that is outside the chain of title is called a wild deed. The general rule is that a subsequent purchaser is not held to have constructive notice of a wild deed. In the example, Cooper's title is unprotected against subsequent good faith purchasers. Suppose Atwood were to fraudulently sell the same property to another person, Dunn. A court would rule that Dunn has good title to the property, not Cooper.|$|E
