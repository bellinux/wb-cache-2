40|$|Plant {{mitochondrial}} genomes {{have very}} low mutation rates. In contrast, they also rearrange and expand frequently. This is easily understood if DNA repair in genes {{is accomplished by}} accurate mechanisms, whereas less accurate mechanisms including nonhomologous end joining or break-induced replication are used in nongenes. An important question is how different mechanisms of repair predominate in coding and noncoding DNA, although one possible mechanismis transcription-coupled repair (TCR). This work tests the predictions of TCR and finds no support for it. Examination of the mutation spectra and rates in genes and <b>junk</b> reveals what <b>DNA</b> repair mechanisms are available to plant mitochondria, and what selective forces act on the repair products. A model is proposed that mismatches and other DNA damages are repaired by converting them into double-strand breaks (DSBs). These can then be repaired {{by any of the}} DSB repair mechanisms, both accurate and inaccurate. Natural selection will eliminate coding regions repaired by inaccurate mechanisms, accounting for the low mutation rates in genes, whereas mutations, rearrangements, and expansions generated by inaccurate repair in noncoding regions will persist. Support for this model includes the structure of the mitochondrial mutS homolog in plants, which is fused to a double-strand endonuclease. The model proposes that plant mitochondria do not distinguish a damaged or mismatched DNA strand from the undamaged strand, they simply cut both strands and perform homology based DSB repair. This plant-specific strategy for protecting future generations from mitochondrial DNA damage has the side effect of genome expansions and rearrangements...|$|R
500|$|Therefrom emerged a film {{treatment}} called The Message. The original script {{had more}} of a police procedural approach, with the alien being created by a [...] "bathtub geneticist" [...] who had just had his project aborted by the government, and a biologist who had worked on the project getting along with a police officer {{to search for the}} creature. Eventually Feldman came to believe this concept had some credibility issues, and instead changed the protagonists to a government team. After coining the name [...] "Sil," [...] Feldman initially thought of forming an acronym, but in the end chose only the three-letter name after learning about the codons of the genetic code, which can be represented in groups of three letters. Sil would originally emerge from a DNA sequence manipulating human DNA, and constantly mutate as she used the human <b>junk</b> <b>DNA</b> to access [...] "all the defenses of the entire animal kingdom that [...] evolved through – including ones that had never developed, plus ones [...] don't know about that have become extinct." [...] Among the research Feldman did for the script included going to sessions of UCLA's Center for the Study of Evolution and the Origin of Life (CSEOL), talking to SETI scientists, and visiting the Salk Institute for Biological Studies to talk with researchers working on the Human Genome Project. The Message was offered to several studios, but was passed up.|$|E

2500|$|Versteeg et al. (2003) tried, with {{a better}} human genome map and better SAGE taqs, to {{determine}} the characteristics of RIDGEs more specific. Overlapping genes were treated as one gene, and genes without introns were rejected as pseudogenes. They determined that RIDGEs are very gene dense, have a high gene expression, short introns, high SINE repeat density and low LINE repeat density. Clusters containing genes with very low transcription levels had characteristics that were the opposite of RIDGEs, therefore those clusters were called antiridges. LINE repeats are <b>junk</b> <b>DNA</b> which contains a cleavage site of endonuclease (TTTTA). Their scarcity in RIDGEs {{can be explained by}} the fact that natural selection favors the scarcity of LINE repeats in ORFs because their endonuclease sites can cause deleterious mutation to the genes.

50|$|The {{amount of}} noncoding DNA varies greatly among species. Often, {{only a small}} {{percentage}} of the genome is responsible for coding proteins, but a rising percentage is being shown to have regulatory functions. When there is much non-coding DNA, a large proportion appears to have no biological function, as predicted in the 1960s.

50|$|Often, {{model organisms}} are chosen {{on the basis}} that they are {{amenable}} to experimental manipulation.

50|$|Historically {{intergenic regions}} have {{sometimes}} been called <b>junk</b> <b>DNA</b> {{suggesting that they}} have no function.

5000|$|Gould and Brosius {{took the}} concept of {{exaptation}} to the genetic level. It is possible {{to look at a}} retroposon, originally thought to be simply <b>junk</b> <b>DNA,</b> and deduce that it may have gotten a new function to be termed as an exaptation. Given an emergency situation in the past, a species may have used <b>junk</b> <b>DNA</b> for a useful purpose in order to evolve and be able to survive. This may have occurred with mammalian ancestors when confronted with a large mass extinction about 250 million years ago and a substantial increase in the level of oxygen in the Earth’s atmosphere.

5000|$|In 2013, {{the genome}} of U. gibba was sequenced. At only 82 megabases, the genome is {{exceptionally}} small for a multicellular plant. Despite its size, the genome accommodates 28,500 genes - more than plants with much larger genomes. [...] The main difference between other plant genomes {{and that of}} U. gibba is a drastic reduction in non-coding DNA.

5000|$|An Intergenic region (IGR) is {{a stretch}} of DNA {{sequences}} located between genes. Intergenic regions are a subset of noncoding DNA.

50|$|Because pseudogenes were {{initially}} {{thought of as}} the last stop for genomic material that could be removed from the genome, they were often labeled as <b>junk</b> <b>DNA.</b> Nonetheless, pseudogenes contain biological and evolutionary histories within their sequences.

50|$|Genome size is {{the total}} amount of DNA {{contained}} within one copy of a single genome. It is typically measured in terms of mass in picograms (trillionths (10−12) of a gram, abbreviated pg) or less frequently in Daltons or as the total number of nucleotide base pairs typically in megabases (millions of base pairs, abbreviated Mb or Mbp). One picogram equals 978 megabases.

50|$|In {{order to}} nudge the {{evolution}} of the dinosaurs towards intelligence, The Watcher and the Jijaki chose to resort to genetic engineering. The Jijaki wished to use Troodon as the base, but The Watcher saw more potential in the Tyrannosaurs due to their long and successful history as a group. The only problem was that Tyrannosaur arms were far too reduced. The Jijaki modified the genetic code of a sample of Nanotyrannus to bring back the five ancestral digits buried in their <b>junk</b> <b>DNA.</b> With more capable forelimbs and enough time, Nanotyrannus eventually evolved into the Quintaglios.|$|E

50|$|Transcripts {{of unknown}} {{function}} (TUFs) {{is the name}} that has been suggested for known RNA transcripts of DNA whose function is unclear.

The DNA sequences for TUFs reside in the intergenic or intronic regions of the genome, which is often called <b>junk</b> <b>DNA.</b> This currently makes up much of the human genome, although {{the percentage of the}} genome that falls under the TUFs category is likely to go down significantly as more progress is made towards understanding the many roles of RNA.|$|E

5000|$|Though the fruitfulness of {{the term}} [...] "junk DNA" [...] has been {{questioned}} {{on the grounds that}} it provokes a strong a priori assumption of total non-functionality and though some have recommended using more neutral terminology such as [...] "noncoding DNA" [...] instead; [...] "junk DNA" [...] remains a label for the portions of a genome sequence for which no discernible function has been identified and that through comparative genomics analysis appear under no functional constraint suggesting that the sequence itself has provided no adaptive advantage. Since the late 70s it has become apparent that the majority of non-coding DNA in large genomes finds its origin in the selfish amplification of transposable elements, of which W. Ford Doolittle and Carmen Sapienza in 1980 wrote in the journal Nature: [...] "When a given DNA, or class of DNAs, of unproven phenotypic function can be shown to have evolved a strategy (such as transposition) which ensures its genomic survival, then no other explanation for its existence is necessary." [...] The amount of <b>junk</b> <b>DNA</b> can be expected to depend on the rate of amplification of these elements and the rate at which non-functional DNA is lost. In the same issue of Nature, Leslie Orgel and Francis Crick wrote that <b>junk</b> <b>DNA</b> has [...] "little specificity and conveys little or no selective advantage to the organism". The term occurs mainly in popular science and in a colloquial way in scientific publications, and it has been suggested that its connotations may have delayed interest in the biological functions of noncoding DNA.|$|E
50|$|It {{is often}} {{reported}} {{that the goal of}} sequencing a genome is to obtain information about the complete set of genes in that particular genome sequence. The proportion of a genome that encodes for genes may be very small (particularly in eukaryotes such as humans, where coding DNA may only account for a few percent of the entire sequence). However, it is not always possible (or desirable) to only sequence the coding regions separately. Also, as scientists understand more about the role of this noncoding DNA (often referred to as <b>junk</b> <b>DNA),</b> it will become more important to have a complete genome sequence as a background to understanding the genetics and biology of any given organism.|$|E
50|$|There {{are other}} {{times when the}} {{implicit}} interests of the vehicle and replicator are in conflict, such as the genes behind certain male spiders' instinctive mating behaviour, which increase the organism's inclusive fitness by allowing it to reproduce, but shorten its life by exposing it {{to the risk of}} being eaten by the cannibalistic female. Another example is the existence of segregation distorter genes that are detrimental to their host, but nonetheless propagate themselves at its expense. Likewise, the persistence of <b>junk</b> <b>DNA</b> that believed at that time provides no benefit to its host can be explained on the basis that it is not subject to selection. These unselected for but transmitted DNA variations connect the individual genetically to its parents, but confer no survival benefit.|$|E
5000|$|The DNA {{sequence}} in the exon provides instructions for coding proteins. The {{function of the}} intron was not understood at first, and they were called noncoding or <b>junk</b> <b>DNA.</b> Split genes were independently discovered by Richard J. Roberts and Phillip A. Sharp in 1977, for which they shared the 1993 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine [...] Their discovery implied the existence of then-unknown machinery for splicing out introns and assembling genes; namely, the spliceosome. It was soon accepted that 94% of human genes were interrupted, and perhaps 50% of hereditary diseases involved errors in splicing introns out of interrupted genes. [...] The best-known example of a disease caused by a splicing error is Beta-thalassemia, in which extra intronic material is erroneously spliced into the gene for making hemoglobin.|$|E
5000|$|Legacy-1 and Legacy-2 {{searched for}} a target organism's [...] "X-factor," [...] the {{sequence}} of mutant genes that gave a mutant his/her superpowers. If it did not find an activated X-factor in the target, the viroid would die off, leaving the person completely unaffected. If, however, it did detect the X-factor, it would begin inserting introns (<b>junk</b> <b>DNA</b> sequences) into the transcription codings of the victim's mutant RNA, the process commonly being triggered after the patient used their powers {{for the first time}} after contracting the disease. The result was a major compromise of the replication and transcription process so disruptive as to eventually render the body incapable of creating healthy cells, ultimately resulting in the death of the victim. Prior to death, the viroid causes its host's powers to flare out of control.|$|E
50|$|In {{response}} to such views, other scientists argue that the wide spread transcription and splicing that is observed in the human genome directly by biochemical testing is a more accurate indicator of genetic function than genomic conservation because conservation estimates are relative due to incredible variations in genome sizes of even closely related species, it is partially tautological, and these estimates are not based on direct testing for functionality on the genome. Conservation estimates {{may be used to}} provide clues to identify possible functional elements in the genome, but it does not limit or cap the total amount of functional elements that could possibly exist in the genome since elements that do things at the molecular level can be missed by comparative genomics. Furthermore, much of the apparent <b>junk</b> <b>DNA</b> is involved in epigenetic regulation and appears to be necessary for the development of complex organisms.|$|E
5000|$|Ohno {{postulated}} that gene duplication {{plays a major}} role in evolution in his classic book Evolution by Gene Duplication (1970). [...] While subsequent research has overwhelmingly confirmed the key role of gene duplication in molecular evolution, research to evaluate Ohno's model for the preservation of duplicate genes (now termed neofunctionalization) is ongoing and very active. He also discovered in 1956 that the Barr body of mammalian female nuclei was in fact a condensed X chromosome. [...] In Evolution by Gene Duplication, he also suggested that vertebrate genome is the result of one or more entire genome duplications; variations of this idea have come to be known as the 2R hypothesis (also called [...] "Ohno's hypothesis"). He indicated that mammalian X chromosomes are conserved among species; it has been referred to as Ohno's law. He also popularized the term <b>junk</b> <b>DNA</b> for segments of the DNA that have no known function.|$|E
5000|$|The {{science writer}} Peter Forbes, writing in The Guardian, notes that when Watson and Crick cracked {{the genetic code}} in 1953, it seemed that {{medicine}} would instantly profit: but half a century went by before the genome was decoded, and 98% of it seemed at first glance to be <b>junk</b> <b>DNA.</b> Now its complexity is starting to be understood, one function at a time. One specialised area is the immune system, with its own ultra-variable set of proteins. They are not only complicated, but have many functions, in immunity, sexual attraction (perhaps), pregnancy, and brain function. Unsurprisingly, Forbes observes, this makes immunology, and its popularisation, [...] "extremely difficult". Davis [...] "sugars the pill" [...] by choosing {{to go into the}} researchers' lives and struggles in great detail. Forbes notes that Davis does not mention that most of the genetic differences between humans and chimpanzees are to do with the immune system and brain development: perhaps (he suggests) these are connected.|$|E
5000|$|The term [...] "junk DNA" [...] {{became popular}} in the 1960s. According to T. Ryan Gregory, a genomic biologist, David Comings {{was the first to}} discuss the nature of <b>junk</b> <b>DNA</b> {{explicitly}} in 1972, and he applied the term to all noncoding DNA. The term was formalized in 1972 by Susumu Ohno, who noted that the mutational load from deleterious mutations placed an upper limit on the number of functional loci that could be expected given a typical mutation rate. Ohno hypothesized that mammal genomes could not have more than 30,000 loci under selection before the [...] "cost" [...] from the mutational load would cause an inescapable decline in fitness, and eventually extinction. This prediction remains robust, with the human genome containing approximately 20,000 genes. Another source for Ohno's theory was the observation that even closely related species can have widely (orders-of-magnitude) different genome sizes, which had been dubbed the C-value paradox in 1971.|$|E
