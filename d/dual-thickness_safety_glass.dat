In 1914 Shuman invented a process for making laminated <b>safety</b> <b>glass,</b> called <b>safety</b> <b>glass,</b> and manufactured by the <b>Safety</b> <b>Glass</b> Company. In 1916 he patented a [...] "Danger Signal" [...] for railroad crossings, as well as the use of liquid oxygen or liquid air to propel a submarine.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{two kinds of}} <b>safety</b> <b>glasses</b> are considered: for {{protection}} against the impact by thrown objects and against the impact due to burglary violation. The methods were explained for testing the glass against the impact, the glass being divided into protection classes (A, B, C) in a connection with the tests results. Cited are main features of <b>safety</b> <b>glassing</b> of protection class A and B. Three kinds of glasses {{can be used as}} protective ones, according to the British Standard, and these are: laminated, quenched and wired <b>glass.</b> Key words: <b>safety</b> <b>glass,</b> laminated glass, annealed glass 1...|$|R
2500|$|<b>Safety</b> <b>glasses</b> {{are worn}} {{to protect the}} eyes in {{different}} situations. [...] They are made with break-proof plastic lenses to protect the eye from flying debris or other matter. Construction workers, factory workers, machinists and lab technicians are often required to wear <b>safety</b> <b>glasses</b> to shield the eyes from flying debris or hazardous splatters such as blood or chemicals. As of 2017, dentists and surgeons in Canada and other countries are required to wear <b>safety</b> <b>glasses</b> to protect against infection from patients' blood or other body fluids. There are also <b>safety</b> <b>glasses</b> for welding, which are styled like wraparound sunglasses, but with much darker lenses, for use in welding where a full sized welding helmet is inconvenient or uncomfortable. These are often called [...] "flash goggles", because they provide protection from welding flash. Nylon frames are usually used for protection eyewear for sports because of their lightweight and flexible properties. Unlike most regular <b>glasses,</b> <b>safety</b> <b>glasses</b> often include protection beside the eyes {{as well as in}} front of the eyes.|$|R
