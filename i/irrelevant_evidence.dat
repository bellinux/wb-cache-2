40|$|AbstractEarly {{psychological}} researchers {{proposed a}} link between intelligence and low-level perceptual performance. It was recently suggested that this link is driven by individual variations {{in the ability to}} suppress <b>irrelevant</b> information, <b>evidenced</b> by the observation of strong correlations between perceptual surround suppression and cognitive performance. However, the neural mechanisms underlying such a link remain unclear. A candidate mechanism is neural inhibition by gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), but direct experimental support for GABA-mediated inhibition underlying suppression is inconsistent. Here we report evidence consistent with a global suppressive mechanism involving GABA underlying the link between sensory performance and intelligence. We measured visual cortical GABA concentration, visuo-spatial intelligence and visual surround suppression in a group of healthy adults. Levels of GABA were strongly predictive of both intelligence and surround suppression, with higher levels of intelligence associated with higher levels of GABA and stronger surround suppression. These results indicate that GABA-mediated neural inhibition may be a key factor determining cognitive performance and suggests a physiological mechanism linking surround suppression and intelligence...|$|R

The starting point of this rather general belief was their discovery of “the law of small numbers ” i. e. their discovery that the pitch of a string is simply related to its length. When the length is shortened in ratio 1 : 2 the pitch jumps up an octave, when shortened in ratio 2 : 3 it jumps up a fifth, in ratio 3 : 4 it jumps up a fourth, in ratio 4 : 5 a major third etc. To shorten the length is to enlarge the frequency and we could say that the Pythagoreans discovered that the frequency ratio between the octave and the fundamental i...|$|R
5000|$|The Goya expert Nigel Glendinning {{rejects the}} idea that the picture was painted by Asensio Juliá, stating that the {{arguments}} supporting Mena's views are [...] "totally subjective" [...] and that the brush strokes that Mena claims are the signature [...] "A. J." [...] are actually the first digits of the inventory number 176 that is visible in old photographs of the painting. It is also possible to see other numbers in these old photographs such as the number 18 that is alluded to in the sentence [...] "A giant with the number eighteen" [...] used in a description of the painting A Giant which was the name used for the painting in the inventory of Goya's works carried out in 1812 after the death of the painters wife Josefa Bayeu. In 2012 Jesusa Vega published an article entitled [...] "The Colossus is by Francisco de Goya" [...] in which she shows how the strokes of various figure eights drawn by Goya correspond to those visible on [...] "The Colossus." [...] Vega rejects the basic premise that initially threw doubt on Goya's authorship of the painting. In addition, she shows that the other findings of the study carried out by the Prado have all indicated that the picture was painted by Goya; these included the analysis of pigments and binders, assessment of the artistic techniques used and the theme and composition of the painting along with its similarity to Goya's other Black Paintings. Then in 2009 the Art Historian Valeriano Bozal, after seeing Mena's press release, stated that [...] "the report is not conclusive". and he later unsuccessfully tried to hold a congress of international experts with the objective of arriving at a consensus, declaring in June 2010 that [...] "Goya's authorship has been removed on the basis of weak <b>irrelevant</b> <b>evidence.</b> The heritage of the painting has been mutilated without conclusive evidence". Other scholars, restorers and former directors of the Prado have indicated that they disagree with Mena's hypothesis.On {{the other side of the}} argument Manuela Mena refused to definitively conclude that the letters A. J. were the signature of Asensio Juliá, one of the main arguments supporting the attribution of the painting to the Valencian painter. In March 2009, Nigel Glendinning and Jesusa Vega published an article in the academic journal Goya entitled A failed attempt to delist The Colossus by the Prado Museum? in which they question the methodology and arguments of Mena's report: In summary, the arguments in favour of delisting The Colossus put forward in the report are not only unconvincing but ultimately they are scandalous due to the errors made and the sophistry used. To publish a document of this type under the protection of the Prado, as if that institution had already accepted its conclusions, is a seriously misguided move that calls into question the trust that society places in the Museum. Ever since 2001 Juliet Bareau-Wilson and Manuela Mena have questioned Goya's authorship of the painting, postulating that Goya's son, Javier, painted it. In addition, they attribute The Milkmaid of Bordeaux to the goddaughter of painter Rosarito Weiss. However, in an article entitled The problem of the allocations from the 1900 Goya Exposition Nigel Glendinning and the then-director of the Museo del Prado, Fernando Checa, reject these claims. In 2004 Nigel Glendinning also published an article entitled Goya's The Colossus and the patriotic poetry of its time, establishing the relationship between Goya's ideas regarding the giant represented in the picture and the literature that aroused patriotic fervour in a population that had survived the war provoked by Napoleon's invasion of Spain. This conjunction of ideas would not have existed if The Colossus had been painted later, which is an argument that Glendinning uses to refute Bareau-Wilson and Mena's hypothesis. This hypothesis tries to distance the painting from the inventory of the estate of Goya's wife, Josefa Bayeu, on her death in 1812. The inventory lists a painting with the same dimensions as The Colossus, which is called A Giant and which has traditionally been identified as the same painting.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Digital evidence, such as digital signatures, is {{of crucial}} {{importance}} in the emerging digitally operating economy because {{it is easy to}} transmit, archive, search, and verify. Nevertheless the initial promises of the usefulness of digital signatures were too optimistic. This calls for a systematic treatment of digital evidence. The goal {{of this paper is to}} provide a foundation for reasoning about digital evidence systems and legislation, thereby identifying the roles and limitations of digital evidence, in the apparently simple scenario where it should prove that an entity agreed to a digital contract. Our approach is in sharp contrast to the current general views documented in the technical literature and in digital signature legislation. We propose an entirely new view of the concepts of certification, time-stamping, revocation, and other trusted services, potentially leading to new and more sound business models for trusted services. Some of the perhaps provocative implications of our view are that certificates are generally <b>irrelevant</b> as <b>evidence</b> in a dispute, that it is generally irrelevant when a signature was generated, that a commitment to be liable for digital evidence cannot meaningfully be revoked, and that there is no need for mutually trusted authorities like certification authorities. We also propose a new type of digital evidence called digital declarations, based on a digital recording of a willful act indicating agreement to a document or contract.

40|$|Abstract. Judges and jurors {{must make}} {{decisions}} {{in an environment}} of ignorance and uncertainty for example by hearing statements of possibly unreliable or dishonest witnesses, assessing possibly doubtful or <b>irrelevant</b> <b>evidence,</b> and enduring attempts by the opponents to manipulate the judge’s and the jurors ’ perceptions and feelings. Three important aspects of decision making in this en-vironment are the quantification of sufficient proof, the weighing of pieces of evidence, and the relevancy of evidence. This paper proposes a mathematical framework for dealing with the two first aspects, namely the quantification of proof and weighing of evidence. Our approach is based on subjective logic, which is an extension of standard logic and probability theory, in which the notion of probability is extended by including degrees of uncertainty.

Due to the limitations of current intrusion detection and network forensic analysis tools, reconstructing attack scenarios from evidence left behind by attackers of enterprise systems is challenging.

The problems faced in such reconstructions include large amounts of data (including <b>irrelevant</b> data), missing <b>evidence</b> and evidence corrupted or destroyed by anti-forensic techniques. The model addresses these problems using various methods, including mapping evidence to system vulnerabilities, inductive reasoning and abductive reasoning, to reconstruct attack scenarios.

The system, which is designed for network forensic analysis, reduces the time and effort required to reach definite conclusions about how network attacks occurred...|$|R
40|$|Although {{there is}} now a large {{evidence-based}} dentistry literature, previous investigators have shown that dentists often consider research <b>evidence</b> <b>irrelevant</b> to their practice. To understand why this is the case, we conducted a qualitative study. Objective: Our aim was to identify how dentists define evidence and how they adopt it in practice. Methods: A qualitative study using grounded theory methodology was conducted. Ten dentists working in eight dental practices were interviewed about their experience and work processes while adopting evidence-based preventive care. Analysis involved transcript coding, detailed memo writing, and data interpretation. Results: Findings revealed that dentists’ direct observations – referred to as clinical evidence – provided the most tangible and trusted evidence in practice and during discussions with colleagues. Dentists described a detailed process used to gather, compare and implement clinical evidence. This process began when they were exposed to novelty in daily practice and proceeded through self-driven testing, producing clinical or tangible evidence that clinicians could use in practice.

40|$|Perceptual {{decisions}} {{in the presence of}} decision-irrelevant sensory information require a selection of decision-relevant sensory evidence. To characterize the mechanism that is responsible for separating decision-relevant from irrelevant sensory information we asked human subjects to make judgments about one of two simultaneously present motion components in a random dot stimulus. Subjects were able to ignore the decision-irrelevant component to a large degree, but their decisions were still influenced by the irrelevant sensory information. Computational modeling revealed that this influence was not simply the consequence of subjects forgetting at times which stimulus component they had been instructed to base their decision on. Instead, residual irrelevant information always seems to be leaking through, and the decision process is captured by a net sensory evidence signal being accumulated to a decision threshold. This net sensory evidence is a linear combination of decision-relevant and irrelevant sensory information. The selection process is therefore well-described by a strong linear gain modulation, which, in our experiment, resulted in the relevant sensory evidence having at least 10 times more impact on the decision than the <b>irrelevant</b> <b>evidence...</b>|$|E

40|$|Jurors in {{negligence}} {{cases are}} supposed to judge a defendant by the reasonableness {{of his or her}} conduct and not by the consequences of that conduct. But several stud-ies have shown that a cognitive heuristic known as hindsight bias can skew post hoc judgments of some prior behavior.

40|$|It {{is widely}} {{believed}} that one should not become more confident that _all swans are white and all lions are brave_ simply by observing white swans. Irrelevant conjunction or "tacking" of a theory onto another is often thought problematic for Bayesianism, especially given the ratio measure of confirmation considered here. It is recalled that the irrelevant conjunct is not confirmed at all. Using the ratio measure, the irrelevant conjunction is confirmed {{to the same degree}} as the relevant conjunct, which, it is argued, is ideal: the irrelevant conjunct is irrelevant. Because the past's really having been as it now appears to have been is an <b>irrelevant</b> conjunct, present <b>evidence</b> confirms theories about past events only insofar as irrelevant conjunctions are confirmed. Hence the ideal of not confirming irrelevant conjunctions would imply that historical claims are not confirmed. Confirmation measures partially realizing that ideal make the confirmation of historical claims by present evidence depend strongly on the (presumably subjective) degree of belief in the irrelevant conjunct. The unusually good behavior of the ratio measure has a bearing on the problem of measure sensitivity. For non-statistical hypotheses, Bayes' theorem yields a fractional linear transformation in the prior probability, not a linear rescaling, so even the ratio measure arguably does not aptly measure confirmation in such cases...|$|R

After learning and executing a mock crime scenario, subjects underwent three deception detection tests: an RT-based CIT, an RT-based CIT plus a concurrent memory task (CITMem), and an RT-based CIT plus a concurrent set-shifting task (CITShift). The concealed information effect, consisting in increased RT and lower response accuracy for probe items compared to <b>irrelevant</b> items, was <b>evidenced</b> across all three conditions. The group analyses indicated a larger difference between RTs to probe and irrelevant items in the dual-task conditions, but this difference was not translated in a significantly increased detection efficiency at an individual level.

Overall response accuracy on the CITMem was highest {{and the difference between}} response accuracy to probes and irrelevants was smallest in this condition. Accuracy on the concurrent tasks (Mem and Shift) was high, and responses on these tasks were significantly influenced by CIT stimulus type (probes vs. irrelevants).

The only essential and unchangeable difference between RCTs and cohort studies is that the former always include randomized control groups and the latter never do, giving RCTs {{a head start on}} internal validity that cohort studies cannot match. However, randomization nearly always has dramatic consequences for LTP research: The control conditions that are most informative (no treatment, wait list, placebo) are so unacceptable for the patients that decisive RCTs are, in most cases, unfeasible, but more feasible RCTs are less decisive. In contrast, the decisive power of cohort studies is determined by their methodological quality and knowledge of the natural course of the investigated disorders. Cohort studies are as capable as RCTs of meeting all quality criteria for intervention research, except for randomization.

Different studies in Iran reported various prevalences, and combining their results could be important for health policy makers. This study aims to determine the total prevalence of HPV infection as well as its related genotypes, particularly HPV 16 and HPV 18 among Iranian healthy women. Methods: Searching the Scientific Information Database, Iranmedex, Magiran, Irandoc, PubMed, Google Scholar, Scopus, and ScienceDirect databanks using relevant keywords and excluding duplicates and <b>irrelevant</b> <b>evidence</b> followed by applying exclusion criteria and quality assessment, eligible articles were selected. Standard error of the prevalence was calculated based on binomial distribution. Random effects model was used because of the high heterogeneity among the results. Results: Of 14 studies entered into the systematic review, 24 pieces of evidence reported the HPV prevalence among 7655 healthy and noncancerous women in different Provinces of Iran. Total prevalence of HPV, 9. 4 % (95 % confidence interval [CI]: 6. 8 - 12. 02); HPV 16, 2. 03 % (95 % CI: 1. 3 - 2. 8); HPV 18, 1. 7 % (95 % CI: 0. 9 - 2. 5); and other genotypes of HPV, 5. 3 % (95 % CI: 3. 6 - 6. 9) were estimated.

40|$|Background: A {{significant}} challenge {{associated with}} practicing evidence-based medicine {{is to provide}} physicians with relevant clinical information when it is needed. At {{the same time it}} appears that the notion of relevance is subjective and its perception is affected by a number of contextual factors. Objectives: To assess to what extent physicians agree on the relevance of evidence in the form of systematic reviews for a common set of patient cases, and to identify possible contextual factors that influence their perception of relevance. Methods: A web-based survey was used where pediatric emergency physicians from multiple academic centers across Canada were asked to evaluate the relevance of systematic reviews retrieved automatically for 14 written case vignettes (paper patients). The vignettes were derived from prospective data describing pediatric patients with asthma exacerbations presenting at the emergency department. To limit the cognitive burden on respondents, the number of reviews associated with each vignette was limited to three. Results: Twenty-two academic emergency physicians with varying years of clinical practice completed the survey. There was no consensus in their evaluation of relevance of the retrieved reviews and physicians’ assessments ranged from very relevant to <b>irrelevant</b> <b>evidence,</b> with the majority of evaluations being somewhere in the middle. This indicates that the study participants did not share a notion of relevance uniformly. Further analysis of commentaries provided by the physicians allowed identifying three possible contextual factors: expected specificity of evidence (acute vs chronic condition), the terminology used in the systematic reviews, and the micro environment of clinical setting. Conclusion: There is no consensus among physicians with regards to what constitutes relevant clinical evidence for a given patient case. Subsequently, this finding suggests that evidence retrieval systems should allow for deep customization with regards to physician’s preferences and contextual factors, including differences in the micro environment of each clinical setting...|$|E

The general rule is that the evidence of opinion or belief of a witness is irrelevant because it is the function of a court to draw inferences and form its opinion from the facts; the witnesses give evidence as to the facts and the court forms its opinion from those facts. The opinion of an expert is admissible if it is relevant. It will be relevant if the witness’s skill, training or experience enables him materially to assist the court on matters in which the court itself does not usually have the necessary knowledge to decide. Where the topic is such that an ordinary judicial officer could be expected to be able, unassisted, to draw an inference, expert evidence is superfluous. In principle, there is no rule that a witness cannot give his opinion on an issue that the court has to decide ultimately. It is not experts alone who may give their opinions on ultimate issues but, in practice, there is a strong tendency to regard the evidence of lay persons on ultimate issues as constituting prima facie evidence only. If such lay testimony remains unchallenged, it may be of greater significance. It is generally true that relevant evidence is admissible and <b>irrelevant</b> <b>evidence</b> is inadmissible. At this stage the following question may be posed: is the opinion of any witness – whether from an expert or lay person – admissible evidence? Should an opinion be admitted for purposes of persuading the court to rely on it in deciding the issue at hand? The basic answer is that relevance remains the fundamental test for admissibility. Certain issues simply cannot be decided without expert guidance. Expert opinion evidence is therefore readily received on issues relating to ballistics, engineering, chemistry, medicine, accounting and psychiatry, to mention only a few examples. The problem which arises is this: {{what is the best way}} of cross-examining the expert witness? Although the concept of skilful cross-examination conjures up the image of the crossexaminer destroying the expert witness in the witness box, total annihilation of expert evidence in court occurs only rarely. In reality, lawyers who are expected to cross-examine experts are often at a disadvantage in that they do not possess sufficient in-depth knowledge of the specific field of expertise to enable them to cross-examine the witness. Despite the expert nature of the evidence, it is suggested that the true basis of crossexamination should not be abandoned when dealing with experts. The effectiveness of crossexamination is enhanced by keeping the number of questions to a minimum as well as opening and concluding with good strong points. At the outset it should be mentioned that there is a distinction between matters of scientific fact and matters of mere opinion. On matters of scientific fact experts seldom differ but within the province of opinion one encounters difficulties. Lengthy cross-examination concerning expert’s theoretical knowledge is usually inefficient and should rarely be attempted. Cross-examination should be directed at pure logic or scientific analysis. The cross-examiner should always have relevant authority with him in court so as to confront the expert with these. The whole effect of the testimony of an expert witness can also be destroyed by putting the witness to test at the trial as to his qualifications, his experience and his ability and discriminations as an expert. A failure to meet this test renders his evidence nugatory...|$|E
40|$|The {{debate on}} whether {{institutions}} or geography prevail in driving economic {{growth has been}} rife (e. g. Sachs 2003 vs. Rodrik et al. 2004). Most of the empirical analyses delving into this debate have focused on world countries, whose geographical and institutional conditions differ widely. Subnational analyses considering groups of countries with, in principle, more similar institutional and geographical conditions have been limited and tended to highlight that geography {{is more important than}} institutions at subnational level. This paper aims to address whether this is the case by investigating how differences in institutional and ‘first-nature’ geographical conditions have affected economic growth in Europe’s regions in the period 1995 - 2009. In the analysis we use a newly developed dataset including regional quality of government indicators and geographical charactersitics and employ 2 -SLS and IV-GMM estimation techniques with a number of regional historical variables as instruments. Our results indicate that at a regional level in Europe institutions rule. Regional institutional conditions – and, particularly, government effectiveness and the fight against corruption – {{play an important role in}} shaping regional economic growth prospects. This does not imply, however, that geography is <b>irrelevant.</b> There is <b>evidence</b> of geographical factors affecting regional growth, although their impact is dwarfed by the overriding influence of institutions. Regional economic growth, institutions, geography, quality of government, NUTS- 2 regions, Europ...|$|R
40|$|In {{his article}} “Why Philosophical Theories of Evidence Are (and Ought to Be) Ignored by Scientists,” Peter Achinstein argues that {{philosophical}} theories of evidence are ignored by scientists because they rest on assumptions which make their concepts of evidence too weak for scientists to work with, or which entail {{that the truth}} or falsity of evidential statements can be determined a priori. Given that, as Achinstein argues, the truth of many evidential statements can only be determined empirically, this “a priorist” assumption makes scientists consider philosophical accounts of <b>evidence</b> <b>irrelevant</b> to their work. In this article I examine the value of evidence, its nature, {{and its relation to}} science. I try to show that, while Achinstein’s conclusions are mostly right, the arguments and examples he gives to support them are flawed in some of their details. Specifically, I propose an account of evidence according to which, though evidential claims are objective to a large extent, something counts as evidence only if, ultimately, it has a relation to beings for whom it counts as evidence. On this view something’s status as evidence does not derive merely from people’s beliefs, but from shared practices that are embodied in what I call contexts of inquiry. I also propose that this concept of evidence is one according to which evidential claims, though defeasible, are in one respect a priori. I argue that this account of evidence is one that should be of interest to scientists...|$|R

Katherine Seley-Radtke (2 ̆ 2 Seley-Radtke 2 ̆ 2) and Ramachandra Hosmane (2 ̆ 2 Hosmane 2 ̆ 2) were professors at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (2 ̆ 2 UMBC 2 ̆ 2). Following allegations that Hosmane sexually assaulted one of his graduate students, Brahmi Shukla (2 ̆ 2 Shukla 2 ̆ 2), UMBC officials conducted an investigation and determined that Hosmane violated UMBC 2 ̆ 7 s sexual harassment policy. On January 1, 2010, Hosmane resigned from his position on the condition that the findings from the UMBC investigation would not be publicized. Later, Hosmane and Shukla entered into a settlement agreement in which Hosmane paid Shukla 10, 000 in return for Shukla dropping any civil and criminal claims against Hosmane...|$|R
