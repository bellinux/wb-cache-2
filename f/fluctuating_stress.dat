We show explicitly that by forcing the surrounding fluid with a <b>fluctuating</b> <b>stress</b> and employing the FCM framework to obtain the motion of the particles, one obtains the random particle velocities and angular velocities that satisfy the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. This result holds even when higher-order multipoles, such as stresslets, are included in the FCM approximation.

However, due to their brittleness, low velocity impact can cause delaminations beneath the surface, while the surface {{may appear to be}} undamaged upon visual inspection. Such a damage is called barely visible impact damage (BVID). Such internal damages lead to significant reduction in local strengths. These initial delaminations can slowly grow under alternating or <b>fluctuating</b> <b>stress</b> leading to a loss in stiffness and ultimately could lead to catastrophic failures. It is therefore important to detect and monitor damages in high loaded composite components to receive an early warning for a well timed maintenance of the aircraft. The non-linear acoustic spectroscopy methods are promising damage detection and material characterization tools. Detailed studies of dynamic non-linearities and hysteresis in inhomogeneous media[1, 2] have shown that the occurrence of mesoscopic elements in the material structure gives rise to strongly nonlinear dynamic phenomena accompanying the elastic wave propagation [3].

Here, cell-to-cell variation in the stress resistance of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, particularly to cadmium, was revealed {{to depend on the}} antioxidant glutathione. Heterogeneity was decreased strikingly in gsh 1 mutants. Furthermore, cells sorted according to differing reduced-glutathione (GSH) contents exhibited differing stress resistances. The vacuolar GSH-conjugate pathway of detoxification was implicated in heterogeneous Cd resistance. Metabolic oscillations (ultradian rhythms) in yeast are known to modulate single-cell redox and GSH status. Gts 1 p stabilizes these oscillations and was found to be required for heterogeneous Cd and hydrogen-peroxide resistance, through the same pathway as Gsh 1 p. Expression of GTS 1 from a constitutive tet-regulated promoter suppressed oscillations and heterogeneity in GSH content, and resulted in decreased variation in stress resistance. This enabled manipulation of the degree of gene expression noise in cultures. It was shown that cells expressing Gts 1 p heterogeneously had a competitive advantage over more-homogeneous cell populations (with the same mean Gts 1 p expression), under continuous and <b>fluctuating</b> <b>stress</b> conditions.
