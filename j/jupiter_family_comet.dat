50|$|Scientists at {{the time}} largely {{believed}} that comets originated outside the solar system, and therefore initial attempts to model the comet's orbit assumed a parabolic trajectory, which indicated a perihelion date (the date of the closest approach to the Sun) of August 9-10.

The runaway crystallization of amorphous ice can produce the energy needed to power outbursts such as those observed for Centaur Comet 29P/Schwassmann-Wachmann 1.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In the {{framework}} of an observational campaign for increasing the knowledge {{on the relationship between}} cometary nuclei and asteroids, we performed spectroscopic observations of P/Gehrels 3. The <b>Jupiter</b> <b>family</b> <b>comet</b> P/Gehrels 3 moves on a particular orbit, with a very high Tisserand invariant with respect to Jupiter, that makes the encounters with the planet very effective. This implies that the comet spends part of its life as a temporary satellite of Jupiter, on an orbit that shows similarity with those of Trojans. This comet has been observed when it was far from the Sun, with the aim to acquire data on the nucleus status. In order to study from a theoretical point of view the possible status and evolution of a body on this orbit we have developed different nucleus models using a numerical code for the thermal evolution of the nucleus...|$|E
