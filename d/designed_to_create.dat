The agency's plans call for the purchase of a 150-passenger catamaran for delivery in 2018, two 250-passenger bow loading catamarans for delivery in 2020 and 2021, and an additional 118-passenger high-speed, low-wake catamaran to be delivered in 2022.|$|E
5|$|Originally <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> dynamic web pages, PHP now focuses {{mainly on}} {{server-side}} scripting, {{and it is}} similar to other server-side scripting languages that provide dynamic content from a web server to a client, such as Microsoft's Classic ASP, Sun Microsystems' JavaServer Pages, and mod_perl. PHP has also attracted the development of many software frameworks that provide building blocks and a design structure to promote rapid application development (RAD). Some of these include PRADO, CakePHP, Symfony, CodeIgniter, Laravel, Yii Framework, Phalcon and Zend Framework, offering features similar to other web frameworks.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} {{chemical}} process, PUREX (Plutonium–URanium EXtraction) reprocesses {{spent nuclear fuel}} to extract plutonium and uranium {{which can be used}} to form a mixed oxide (MOX) fuel for reuse in nuclear reactors. Weapons-grade plutonium can be added to the fuel mix. MOX fuel is used in light water reactors and consists of 60kg of plutonium per tonne of fuel; after four years, three-quarters of the plutonium is burned (turned into other elements). Breeder reactors are specifically <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> more fissionable material than they consume.|$|E

5|$|The {{strategic}} situation {{permitted the}} development of the Vance plana ceasefire supervised by United Nations peacekeepers <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> conditions for the political settlement of the conflict in Croatia. The Sarajevo Agreement, regarding the implementation of the ceasefire, was signed on 2 January 1992, bringing the campaign to an end. Nonetheless, the JNA took several more months to withdraw from Croatia as it was replaced by the UN peacekeepers. In 1991 alone, the conflict caused more than 7,000 deaths and the internal displacement of 400,000–600,000 people. More than 1,700 persons remain missing {{as a result of the}} campaign.|$|E
5|$|But {{the aliens}} became extinct before {{completing}} their work. As {{the human race}} bred and evolved, only a percentage retained their psychic abilities, which surfaced only sporadically. For centuries the buried ship had occasionally triggered those dormant abilities, which explained the reports of poltergeists; people were unknowingly using their own telekinesis to move objects around, and the ghost sightings were traces of a racial memory. The authorities, and Breen in particular, find this explanation preposterous despite being shown the recording of Barbara's vision. They believe that the craft is a Nazi propaganda weapon and the alien bodies fakes <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> exactly the impressions that Quatermass has succumbed to, and decide to hold a media event to stem the rumours that are already spreading.|$|E
5|$|The game {{featured}} advanced {{artificial intelligence}} {{due to the}} inclusion of the game's squad command system. Adams and Lugo will assist Walker in battles and react to the battle situation accordingly even if they are not given any orders. They will also analyse the situation when instructed and decide the best approach to defeat enemies. The battle command system was designed to be accessible and easy to use, so that players would not have {{to spend a lot of}} time managing the squad. Lugo and Adams may get severely injured and if both of them die, the game ends. This mechanic prompts the player to rescue them as quickly as possible, and the system is <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> tense situations. The AI for enemies is affected by various factors, including visibility and hearing.|$|E

5|$|Japanese rule of Taiwan {{ended in}} 1945, {{following}} the armistice with the allies on September 2 {{and the subsequent}} appropriation of the island by the Chinese Nationalist Party (Kuomintang, or KMT) on October 25. In 1949, on losing the Chinese Civil War to the Communist Party of China, Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek led the Kuomintang in a retreat from Mainland China, withdrawing its government and 1.3 million refugees to Taiwan. The KMT installed an authoritarian form of government and shortly thereafter inaugurated a number of political socialization programs aimed at nationalizing Taiwanese people as citizens of a Chinese nation and eradicating Japanese influence. The KMT pursued highly centralized political and cultural policies rooted in the party's decades-long history of fighting warlordism in China and opposing competing concepts of a loose federation following {{the demise of the}} imperial Qing. The project was <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> a strong national Chinese cultural identity (as defined by the state) at the expense of local cultures. Following the February 28 Incident, the Kuomintang placed Taiwan under martial law, which was to last for nearly four decades.|$|E
5|$|The {{computer}} console {{explosion that}} causes the transporter malfunction was simulated using brillo pads. Weldon hid steel wool inside the console and attached an arc welder to operate by remote control when the actor pulled a wire. The welder was <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> a spark instead of actually welding, causing the steel wool to burn and make sparks; so effective was the setup that the cast members were continually startled by the flare-ups, resulting in additional takes. Various canisters and cargo containers appear to be suspended by Anti-gravity throughout the film. These effects were executed by several of Weldon's assistants. The crew built a circular track that had the same shape as the corridor and suspended the antigravity prop on four small wires that connected to the track. The wires were treated with a special acid which oxidized the metal; the reaction tarnished the wires to a dull gray that would not {{show up in the}} deep blue corridor lighting. Cargo boxes were made out of light balsa wood so that fine wires could be used as support.|$|E
5|$|The {{last week}} of {{production}} was fraught with issues. Red gel lights appeared orange upon reviewing the daily footage; the lights were faulty, and three people were nearly electrocuted. On January 26, 1979, the film finally wrapped after 125 days. The three leads (Shatner, Nimoy, and Kelley) delivered their final lines at 4:50 pm. Before the crew could go home, a final shot had to be filmed — the climactic fusing of Decker and V'Ger. The script prescribed a heavy emphasis on lighting, with spiraling and blinding white lights. Collins was covered in tiny dabs of cotton glued to his jacket; these highlights were <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> a body halo. Helicopter lights, 4000–watt lamps and wind machines were used to create the effect of Decker's fusion with the living machine. The first attempts at filming the scene became a nightmare for the crew. The extreme lighting caused normally invisible dust particles {{in the air to}} be illuminated, creating the appearance that the actors were caught in a blizzard. During the retakes throughout the week the crew mopped and dusted the set constantly, and it required later technical work to completely eliminate the dust in the final print.|$|E

5|$|The JNA's planned {{campaign}} {{included an}} {{advance in the}} Šibenik area by the 9th (Knin) Corps, which was tasked with isolating Dalmatia {{from the rest of}} Croatia. As it was fully mobilised and prepared for deployment, the corps began operations against the ZNG on 16 September. Its main axis of attack was directed at Vodice, with supporting advances towards Zadar, Drniš and Sinj. The push was <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> favourable circumstances to attack Zadar, Šibenik and Split. With support from a corps-level battalion of M-84 tanks and the SAO Krajina Territorial Defence, the JNA 221st Mechanised Brigade (without its battalion of T-34 tanks), was committed to the main axis of the attack. The secondary advance, towards Biograd na Moru on the right flank, was assigned to the 180th Mechanised Brigade, supported by the armoured battalion removed from the 221st Brigade, the 557th Mixed Antitank Artillery Regiment and the SAO Krajina Territorial Defence. Offensive support was provided by the 9th Mixed Artillery Regiment and the 9th Military Police Battalion. The 221st Brigade was commanded by Colonel Borislav Đukić. Elements the 46th Partisan Division, drawn from the 24th (Kragujevac) Corps, also provuded support for the corps. The JNA garrison in Šibenik barracks included the 11th Marine Infantry Brigadeone of a handful of units regularly maintained at full combat readiness.|$|E
