However, she felt that in cases like that of Christine Ohuruogu, who missed three out-of-competition drugs tests, that she should be allowed to compete in the Olympics, as the BOA does not allow anyone who has served a doping ban to compete. However, when Ohuruogu admitted to not {{trying to get to the}} tests, Radcliffe expressed her disappointment and hoped that it was a lesson learned.

In the 1970s, the Oregon Legislature passed a law against filling Smith or Bybee lakes below a contour line [...] above mean sea level except to enhance fish and wildlife habitat. Plans for a Willamette River Greenway project proposed by Oregon Governor Tom McCall in the late 1960s called for park and recreation areas along the Willamette and many of its tributaries but ignored the slough.
