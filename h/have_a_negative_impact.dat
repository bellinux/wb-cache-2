5|$|Biological control {{can affect}} {{biodiversity}} through predation, parasitism, pathogenicity, competition, or other attacks on non-target species. An introduced control {{does not always}} target only the intended pest species; it can also target native species. In Hawaii during the 1940s parasitic wasps were introduced to control a lepidopteran pest and the wasps are still found there today. This may <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>negative</b> <b>impact</b> on the native ecosystem, however, host range and impacts need to be studied before declaring {{their impact on the}} environment.|$|E

Wild individuals can be competitors of commercial livestock, and can transmit fatal diseases like rinderpest and cause epidemics among animals, particularly domestic cattle. They can also spread ticks, lungworms, tapeworms, flies and paramphistome flukes.|$|E

5|$|As word of {{the massacres}} got out, many Jews fled; in Ukraine, 70 to 90 per cent of the Jews ran away. This was seen by the leader of Einsatzkommando VI as beneficial, as it would save the regime the costs of deporting the victims further east over the Urals. In other areas the {{invasion}} was so successful that the Einsatzgruppen had insufficient forces to immediately kill all the Jews in the conquered territories. A situation report from Einsatzgruppe C in September 1941 noted that not all Jews {{were members of the}} Bolshevist apparatus, and suggested that the total elimination of Jewry would <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>negative</b> <b>impact</b> on the economy and the food supply. The Nazis began to round their victims up into concentration camps and ghettos and rural districts were for the most part rendered Judenfrei (free of Jews). Jewish councils were set up in major cities and forced labour gangs were established {{to make use of the}} Jews as slave labour until they were totally eliminated, a goal that was postponed until 1942.|$|E
5|$|On February 12, 2006, {{shortly after}} the {{beginning}} of the General Assembly's legislative session, Fletcher was hospitalized with abdominal pain. Doctors at St. Joseph East hospital in Lexington found a gallstone in his common bile duct and also diagnosed him with an inflamed pancreas and gallbladder disease. After surgery to remove the gallbladder, Fletcher developed a blood infection that slowed his recovery, but was discharged from the hospital on March 1. Days later, he returned to St. Joseph's with a blood clot which had to be dissolved, resulting in another five-day stay in the hospital. Fletcher staffers insisted that his absence did not <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>negative</b> <b>impact</b> on his ability to get legislation passed during the session. A right-to-work law and a repeal of the state's prevailing wage law – both advocated by Fletcher – failed early in the session, but both had been considered unlikely to pass before the session started. Among the bills that did pass the session were a mandatory seat belt law, a law requiring children under 16 years old to wear a helmet when operating an all-terrain vehicle, and legislation allowing the Ten Commandments to be posted on Capitol grounds in a historical context.|$|E
5|$|The {{unfolding}} events {{seemed to}} <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>negative</b> <b>impact</b> on the cohesion between U.S. and South Vietnamese indigenous forces. The resolve of the South Vietnamese, Montagnard CIDG soldiers in particular, {{had apparently been}} shaken and they disobeyed an order {{to carry out a}} sweep operation at the rear end of the camp, and their Vietnamese commander even refused to leave his bunker to encourage the soldiers. The morale and discipline of the indigenous forces had sunk so low that they began to leave their defensive positions without permission, although their section of the camp was never subjected to a major ground attack. Consequently, the behavior of indigenous CIDG soldiers during the various stages of the battle, coupled with information that 'friendly' Montagnard soldiers had turned on U.S. Marines at Ngok Tavak, had the effect of unnerving U.S. Army soldiers in Khâm Đức. To ensure CIDG soldiers would not abandon their posts, U.S. soldiers threatened to shoot anyone attempting to run away.|$|E

5|$|While {{harmonics}} in the PWM output {{can easily}} be filtered by carrier-frequency-related filter inductance to supply near-sinusoidal currents to the motor load, the VFD's diode-bridge rectifier converts AC line voltage to DC voltage output by super-imposing non-linear half-phase current pulses thus creating harmonic current distortion, and hence voltage distortion, of the AC line input. When the VFD loads are relatively small {{in comparison to the}} large, stiff power system available from the electric power company, the effects of VFD harmonic distortion of the AC grid can often be within acceptable limits. Furthermore, in low-voltage networks, harmonics caused by single-phase equipment such as computers and TVs are partially cancelled by three-phase diode bridge harmonics because their 5th and 7th harmonics are in counterphase. However, when the proportion of VFD and other non-linear load compared to total load or of non-linear load compared to the stiffness at the AC power supply, or both, is relatively large enough, the load can <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>negative</b> <b>impact</b> on the AC power waveform available to other power company customers in the same grid.|$|E
5|$|Because {{of their}} large size, {{elephants}} {{have a huge}} impact on their environments and are considered keystone species. Their habit of uprooting trees and undergrowth can transform savannah into grasslands; when they dig for water during drought, they create waterholes that can be used by other animals. They can enlarge waterholes when they bathe and wallow in them. At Mount Elgon, elephants excavate caves that are used by ungulates, hyraxes, bats, birds and insects. Elephants are important seed dispersers; African forest elephants ingest and defecate seeds, with either no effect or a positive effect on germination. The seeds are typically dispersed in large amounts over great distances. In Asian forests, large seeds require giant herbivores like elephants and rhinoceros for transport and dispersal. This ecological niche cannot be filled by the next largest herbivore, the tapir. Because most of the food elephants eat goes undigested, their dung can provide food for other animals, such as dung beetles and monkeys. Elephants can <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>negative</b> <b>impact</b> on ecosystems. At Murchison Falls National Park in Uganda, the overabundance of elephants has threatened several species of small birds that depend on woodlands. Their weight can compact the soil, which causes the rain to run off, leading to erosion.|$|E
5|$|From 1988, {{environmental}} groups started opposing the Triangle Link. The most active was the {{local chapter of}} the Norwegian Society for the Conservation of Nature, who stated that the road would <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>negative</b> <b>impact</b> for local boat traffic to the recreational islands of Føyno and Nautøy. They therefore recommended that the municipalities select a pontoon bridge. Another opponent to the project was the Action Committee Against a Hasty Construction of the Triangle Link, who wanted to delay the decision until after the 1991 municipal elections to ensure that the municipal councils had backing in the public. Also Gisle Tjong, a local citizen, opposed the project, stating that the risk was too large and that it was uncertain how long the tolls would last. He argued that the tolls could just as well last 60 as 15 years. Instead, he wanted to use advance tolls and fuel fees, place the income in the bank and then pay the whole fixed link with the saved-up funds. Most of the opposition against the project was from Stord, while in Bømlo there was near consensus in favor of the project. The exception was in southern Bømlø, where there was concerns that their ferry service to the mainland would be terminated, which would result in considerably longer driving time to Haugesund. Concerns were also raised regarding people with fear of tunnels and proposals were made to keep a ferry service for such people.|$|E
