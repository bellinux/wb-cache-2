Mad {{to a certain extent}} I must have been, for I recollect that I reined in my horse {{at the head of the}} 'rickshaw, and politely wished Mrs. Wessington [...] "Good evening." [...] Her answer was one I knew only too well. I listened to the end; and replied that I had heard it all before, but should be delighted if she had anything further to say. Some malignant devil stronger than I must have entered into me that evening, for I have a dim recollection of talking the commonplaces of the day for five minutes to the Thing in front of me.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{recent years}} Tokyo has seen much {{construction}} of large new office and hotel complexes, shopping centers, and other notable redevelopment projects. Almost {{all of these}} developments include public spaces such as plazas in their designs, as well as public art such as sculptures, statues, and decorative fountains. A significant number of the statues show nude females. This is {{to the dismay of}} many women passersby, who argue that the purpose of these statues is to please men at the expense of women, and that the landscape of the new Tokyo is sexist. This paper is based on field research that was undertaken in Tokyo during summer 1993, and reports on (1) a detailed inventory of public art in the city's new redevelopment projects and major commercial centers; and (2) the results from questionnaires that were administered to a sample {{of men and women in}} Tokyo about their opinions on the city's new public art. Like many other important cities, Tokyo has recently seen much construction of large new office and hotel complexes, shopping centers, and public buildings such as convention centers, museums and recreation facilities. Almost all of this construction includes outdoor public spaces such as plazas, as well as public art such as sculptures, statues and decorative fountains. Many of these projects are extremely well designed, and add significantly to the beautification of the city. However, the design of these projects also reveals many examples of sexism against women, particularly with respect to the unusually large number of statues of nude females that have been included in much of the new construction. This reflects the deeply ingrained gender bias of Japanese society and, I think, detracts significantly from the overall appeal of otherwise impressive architectural achievements. This paper is a report on field work in Tokyo about sexism in public art at recent redevelopment sites. My interest in this research came initially from casual observations during daily travels around the city, and then from a brief exchange of letters to the editor that <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> about <b>th...</b>|$|R
