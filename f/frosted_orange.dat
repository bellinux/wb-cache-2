5000|$|<b>Frosted</b> <b>orange</b> (Gortyna flavago) - {{recorded}} by Richardson on 18 September 1959.|$|E
50|$|The <b>frosted</b> <b>orange</b> moth (Gortyna flavago) is a moth of the Noctuidae family {{which is}} found in Europe, Armenia, Syria and east through the Palearctic to western Siberia. It has also been {{recorded}} in Algeria. The <b>frosted</b> <b>orange</b> is a night-flying species with orange and brown speckled wings allow for perfect camouflage against autumn leaves in the daytime. It is attracted to light and does not come to flowers, and its larva inhabit the stems and roots of the species' food plants.|$|E
50|$|Orange County {{was formed}} in 1852 from {{portions}} of Jefferson County. It was named after the orange fruit, the common citrus fruit grown by the early settlers of this County {{near the mouth of}} the Sabine River.Due to periodic spells of quite cold winter weather (<b>frosts)</b> in <b>Orange</b> County, it is no longer the home of orange trees and citrus orchards. The production of those fruits in Texas long ago was moved a long way southwest into the Rio Grande Valley, where the weather is almost always warm all winter long. Citrus trees produce their fruit in the wintertime, which makes them especially vulnerable to frost and icy weather.|$|R
50|$|For Digital Delay, Frost uses a Boss DD-6 pedal and a Line 6 DL4 Modeler stompbox, as well {{as using}} MXR M-106 6-Band Graphic EQ, {{and a number of}} Electro-Harmonix effects {{including}} an Electro-Harmonix POG, Holy Stain and Holy Grail, whilst using an Orange Channel Footswitch. During the recording of Not Accepted Anywhere, the album sleeve states that <b>Frost</b> uses both <b>Orange</b> and Marshall guitar amplifiers.|$|R
50|$|The snacks are {{typically}} wrapped, individual portions of food, {{such as a}} brownie cookie, snack cake, bag of peanuts, or a Moon Pie, usually in the flavors of chocolate, banana, or <b>orange</b> <b>frosted</b> marshmallow cake. Several newer flavors of coconut, vanilla, mint, peanut butter, and salted caramel have been added, over the years. The tossed snacks have also included various bags of pork rinds crackers. Other snacks include dried fruits and whole bags of candy and gum.|$|R
50|$|Citrus {{trees are}} not {{generally}} <b>frost</b> hardy. Mandarin <b>oranges</b> (C. reticulata) {{tend to be}} the hardiest of the common Citrus species and can withstand short periods down to as cold as −10 C, but realistically temperatures not falling below −2 C are required for successful cultivation. Tangerines, tangors and yuzu can be grown outside even in regions with more marked sub-freezing temperatures in winter, although this may affect fruit quality. A few hardy hybrids can withstand temperatures well below freezing, but do not produce quality fruit. Lemons can be commercially grown in cooler-summer/moderate-winter, coastal Southern California, because sweetness is neither attained nor expected in retail lemon fruit. The related trifoliate orange (Citrus trifoliata) can survive below −20 C; its fruit are astringent and inedible unless cooked but a few better-tasting cultivars and hybrids have been developed (see citranges).The trees thrive in a consistently sunny, humid environment with fertile soil and adequate rainfall or irrigation. Abandoned trees in valleys may suffer, yet survive, the dry summer of Central California's Inner Coast Ranges. At any age citrus grows well enough with infrequent irrigation in partial shade, but the fruit crop is smaller. Being of tropical and sub-tropical origin, oranges, like all citrus, are broadleaved and evergreen. They do not drop leaves except when stressed. The stems of many varieties have large sharp thorns. The trees flower in the spring, and fruit is set shortly afterward. Fruit begins to ripen in fall or early winter months, depending on cultivar, and develops increasing sweetness afterward. Some cultivars of tangerines ripen by winter. Some, such as the grapefruit, may take up to eighteen months to ripen.|$|R
