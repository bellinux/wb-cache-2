This thesis shows one basic approach of a wide computer aided planning of <b>flexible</b> <b>automated</b> <b>assembly</b> <b>systems</b> and its realization with a software prototype. During planning a flexible automated assembly cell, a big amount of information describing among others the product, the possible equipment and the surroundings where the assembly cell e. g. shall be placed, are essential and must be analyzed. The planner transforms these data to the necessary requirements for selecting assembly devices by using his knowledge. For developing a prototype for selecting devices in a partly automated computer aided way this knowledge and the accompanying data are scrutinized, structured and put into an appropriate software system for representing and processing these informations. The prototype consists of an extended CAD-system for the geometrical processing and an expert system for processing the non-geometrical data. (orig.)

40|$|<b>Flexible</b> <b>automated</b> <b>assembly</b> is an {{emerging}} need in several industries. In {{the case of}} a very wide set of models and a total medium/low derived production volume, the proper <b>assembly</b> <b>system</b> to use is a single cell with high flexibility capabilities. An innovative concept in <b>flexible</b> <b>automated</b> <b>assembly</b> has recently been introduced: the fully flexible <b>assembly</b> <b>system</b> (F-FAS). The F-FAS relies on a single-station robotized <b>assembly</b> <b>system,</b> where a unique fully flexible feeder is responsible for the delivery of the parts needed for assembly, guaranteeing a higher level of flexibility than the traditional automated FAS.

40|$|In recent years, growing {{national}} and international competition {{as well as the}} increasingly exacting demands of the consumer have led to greater product diversity and ever shorter product life cycles while the size of production lots decreased at the same time. As a result of this development, the importance of <b>flexible</b> <b>automated</b> <b>assembly</b> in the production of small and medium-sized lots is growing apace. In most of the flexible <b>assembly</b> <b>systems</b> workpieces are mostly stored in workpiece-specific feeding systems which are normally integrated in an assembly station and they go on causing a major proportion of all breakdowns in <b>automated</b> <b>assembly</b> <b>systems.</b> The aim {{of this study was to}} develope a sorting and order-picking cell that is decoupled from and independent of the <b>assembly</b> <b>system</b> for delivering different workpieces in a highly flexible manner. After identifying the major requirements and constraints governing workpiece delivery in flexible <b>assembly</b> <b>systems,</b> scientific facts and solutions for a feeding system that would simultaneously convey and sort a variety of workpieces was also developed as a process by which workpiece-specific magazines for flexible positioning and sorting systems could be designed automatically. To describe the behaviour of workpieces in a magazine cavity during the magazining process, a mathematical approach was developed in which a computer simulation is used to determine the boundaries for adjusting device parameters such as maximum oscillation amplitudes and magazine tilt angles. Next, the processes and components that had been developed were assembled in an auto-mated sorting and order-picking cell. The functions of this pilot system were verified in tests in which a representative range of workpieces was used. The technical feasibility of a sorting and order-picking cell for the highly flexible delivery of a wide variety of workpieces for assembly purposes may be regarded as having been successfully demonstrated...|$|R

PGB contracted with an industry partner to supply the <b>automated</b> <b>assembly</b> <b>system,</b> which will be built and tested in 2015. Amid the wide spread perception that automation projects purchased from suppliers include schedule delays and performance deficiencies, PGB must specify the activities to verify <b>automated</b> <b>assembly</b> <b>system</b> performance prior to purchasing it from the Supplier. Interviews with project teams were completed to gather data about the procurement of existing automated systems at Company A. A range of success in completing project buyoff on time with no deficiencies was found with variation in buyoff results mainly associated with the presence or lack of fully-defined requirements and detailed procedures to verify and validate the system according to the requirements. The findings led to the hypothesis that automation system buyoff can be improved by applying an approach that includes development of good requirements, planning detailed procedures to verify and validate the system according to the requirements, and tracking progress towards meeting requirements to a schedule. To test the hypothesis, an approach to buyoff plan development and execution incorporating these factors was defined and then evaluated using a model. Buyoff of the <b>automated</b> <b>assembly</b> <b>system</b> will occur in 2015 according to the approach defined in this research.

To meet new and changing market needs, the difficulties of integrating their systems must be significantly reduced. Since 1994, the Microdynamic Systems Laboratory at Carnegie Mellon University has been developing an automation framework, called Agile Assembly Architecture (AAA). Additionally to the concept, a prototype instantiation, {{in the form of a}} modular tabletop precision <b>assembly</b> <b>system</b> termed Minifactory, has been developed. The platform, provided by the Minifactory and AAA, is able to support and integrate various precision manufacturing processes. These are needed to assemble a large variety of small mechatronic products. In this thesis various enhancements for a second generation agent-based micro <b>assembly</b> <b>system</b> are designed, implemented, tested and improved. The project includes devising methods for tray feeding of precision high-value parts, micro fastening techniques and additional work on visual- and force-servoing. To help achieving these functions, modular and reconfigurable robot end-effectors for handling millimeter sized parts have been designed and built for the existing robotic agents. New concepts for robot end effectors to grasp and release tiny parts, including image processing and intelligent control software, were required and needed to be implemented in the prototype setup. These concepts need to distinguish themselves largely from traditional handling paradigms, in order to solve problems introduced by electrostatic and surface tension forces, that are dominant in manipulating parts that are millimeter and less in size.

The {{purpose of this}} paper is to address the introduction of an innovative concept in flexible assembly: the fully flexible <b>assembly</b> <b>system</b> (F-FAS). Design/methodology/approach – After an analysis of the state of the art, the authors describe the proposed F-FAS, from a layout, constitutional elements, functioning principles and working cycle point of view. Second, the authors compare the traditional FAS and the manual <b>assembly</b> <b>system</b> versus the proposed F-FAS according to their throughput and unit production costs, deriving a convenience map as a function of the number of components used in assembly and of the efficiency of the F-FAS. Finally, using a prototype work cell developed at the Robotics Laboratory of University of Padua, the authors validate the F-FAS concept. Findings – Results of the research indicate that the concept of full-flexibility can be exploited to bring automation to a domain where traditional FAS are not competitive versus manual assembly. In fact, the F-FAS outperforms both traditional FAS and manual assembly, in terms of unit direct production costs, when the size of the batch is small, the number of components used in assembly is large and the efficiency of the F-FAS is reasonably high. The F-FAS prototype demonstrated the possibility of working, for certain conditions (models/components/production mix), in the F-FAS convenience area, highlighting the achievable cost reduction versus traditional <b>assembly</b> <b>systems.</b> Originality/value – The novelty of the study lies in the F-FAS concept, its performances in terms of flexibility, compactness, throughput and unit direct production costs.
