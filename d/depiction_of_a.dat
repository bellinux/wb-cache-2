5|$|A god {{standing}} on or {{seated on a}} pattern of scales is a typical scenery for the <b>depiction</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> theophany. It is associated with gods who have some connection with mountains but not restricted to any one deity in particular.|$|E
5|$|Ayudhapurusha is the {{anthropomorphic}} <b>depiction</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> divine {{weapon in}} Hindu art. Ayudhapurushas are sometimes considered as partial incarnates of their divine owners.|$|E

5|$|The {{painting}} {{has been}} called a masterpiece <b>depiction</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> battle scene, and much more than a simple <b>depiction</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> bloody battle. It is a complex picture, requiring more than a cursory look; a French critic, viewing it in Paris in 1879, declared that it was a museum in its own right, requiring eight days of study before one could properly appreciate it. At the same time, critics have pointed to the unrealistic depiction of the battle, and some anachronistic accessories present in the painting. Others have criticized the painting for being too crowded and chaotic.|$|E
5|$|Hergé's {{depiction}} {{of the city of}} Tapiocapolis was visually based on the city of Belo Horizonte in Brazil. His <b>depiction</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> public sculpture in the city was inspired by the work of sculptor Marcel Arnould, while the paintings that he designed for the Tapiocapolis hotel in which Tintin and Haddock stay are {{based on the work of}} Serge Poliakoff.|$|E

5|$|Sarah Siddons {{starred in}} John Philip Kemble's 1794 {{production}} at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane and offered a psychologically intricate portrait of Lady Macbeth {{in the tradition of}} Hannah Pritchard. Siddons was especially praised for moving audiences in the sleepwalking scene with her <b>depiction</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> soul in profound torment. Siddons and Kemble furthered the view established by Pritchard and Garrick that character was the essence of Shakespearean drama.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{examples of}} portable art {{from what is}} now Scotland are highly decorated carved stone balls from the Neolithic period, which share patterns with Irish and Scottish stone carvings. Other items from this period include elaborate carved maceheads and figurines from Links of Noltland, including the Westray Wife, which is the earliest known <b>depiction</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> human face from Scotland.|$|E
5|$|The fifth {{season of}} Degrassi: The Next Generation {{was the most}} {{successful}} season to date, averaging 767,000 viewers in Canada, and had one episode watched by a million viewers. It received praise for its <b>depiction</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> relationship between two gay characters, but mixed reviews for highlighting the issue of anorexia and bulimia in teenage girls.|$|E

5|$|The mid-11th century Gosforth Cross {{located in}} Cumbria, England, has been {{interpreted}} as featuring various figures from Norse mythology. The bottom portion of {{the west side of}} the cross features a <b>depiction</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> long-haired female, kneeling figure holding an object above another prostrate, bound figure. Above and to their left is a knotted serpent. This {{has been interpreted}} as Sigyn soothing the bound Loki.|$|E
5|$|The {{painting}} depicts 125 wedding guests. As was customary in the Renaissance period, the brides {{wore black}} and men wore codpieces. Voyeurism is depicted {{throughout the entire}} art work; dancing was disapproved of by the authorities and the church, and the painting {{can be seen as}} both a critique and comic <b>depiction</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> stereotypical oversexed, overindulgent, peasant class of the times.|$|E
5|$|According to Renaissance accounts, gigantic, {{triangular}} fossil teeth {{often found}} embedded in rocky formations were once {{believed to be}} the petrified tongues, or glossopetrae, of dragons and snakes. This interpretation was corrected in 1667 by Danish naturalist Nicolas Steno, who recognized them as shark teeth, and famously produced a <b>depiction</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> shark's head bearing such teeth. He described his findings in the book The Head of a Shark Dissected, which also contained an illustration of a megalodon tooth.|$|E

5|$|As {{with other}} early van der Weyden {{depictions of the}} Madonna, her head is {{slightly}} too large for her body. Her dress is creased and almost paper-like. However, the description of her lap contains inconsistencies also in Campin's Virgin and Child before a Firescreen; it appears to lack volume and is if she had only one leg. This seems to reflect an early difficulty both with foreshortening and in the <b>depiction</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> body under clothing.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of World War Two the British Government created the War Artists' Advisory Committee, WAAC, and {{appointed}} Kenneth Clark as its Chairman. Despite the public hostility between Clarke and himself, Nevinson was disappointed not to be offered a commission by WAAC. He submitted three paintings to WAAC in December 1940 which were also rejected. He worked as a stretcher-bearer in London throughout the Blitz, during which his own studio and the family home in Hampstead were hit by bombs. WAAC eventually purchased two pictures from him, Anti-aircraft Defences and a <b>depiction</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> fire-bomb attack, The Fire of London, December 29th – An Historic Record.|$|E
5|$|By 1970, Warhol {{established}} the record auction {{price for a}} painting by a living American artist with a $60,000 sale of Big Campbell's Soup Can with Torn Label (Vegetable Beef) (1962) in a sale at Parke-Bernet, the preeminent American auction house of the day (later acquired by Sotheby's). This record was broken {{a few months later}} by his rival for the artworld's attention and approval, Lichtenstein, who sold a <b>depiction</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> giant brush stroke, Big Painting No. 6 (1965) for $75,000.|$|E

5|$|Cannon: The {{earliest}} known <b>depiction</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> cannon is {{a sculpture}} from the Dazu Rock Carvings in Sichuan dated to 1128, however the earliest archaeological samples and textual accounts {{do not appear}} until the 13th century. The primary extant specimens of cannon from the 13th century are the Wuwei Bronze Cannon dated to 1227, the Heilongjiang hand cannon dated to 1288, and the Xanadu Gun dated to 1298. However, only the Xanadu gun contains an inscription bearing a date of production, so it is considered the earliest confirmed extant cannon. The Xanadu Gun is 34.7cm in length and weighs 6.2kg. The other cannon are dated using contextual evidence.|$|E
5|$|Episode 232 of the anime series had a {{defamatory}} <b>depiction</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{character that}} referenced a specific politician, the current Minister for Government Revitalisation Renhō Murata, {{which resulted in}} the cancellation of its rerun on AT-X. Series supervisor Shinji Takamatsu explained that TV Tokyo cancelled the rerun on its own. Renhō's representative denied having objected to the episode although a report from the Mainichi Shimbun paper stated the affected party contacted TV Tokyo. When the story arc the episode belonged to was completed, Takamatsu expressed doubts about the arc's release in DVD format.|$|E

A Region 2 release of Eyes Without a Face {{was released}} April 21, 2008 by Second Sight Films. A Region 4 edition of the film {{was released on}} July 2, 2007 by Umbrella Entertainment.
