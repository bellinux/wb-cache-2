5|$|Another blow to Soviet {{communism}} in the First World {{came with the}} establishment of eurocommunism. Eurocommunists espoused and supported the ideals of Soviet communism {{while at the same time}} supporting rights of the individual. The largest obstacle was that it was the largest communist parties, those with highest electoral turnout, which became eurocommunists. Originating with the Prague Spring, this new thinking made the First World more skeptical of Soviet {{communism in}} general. The <b>Italian</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> notably declared that should war break out in Europe, they would rally to the defense of Italy and resist any Soviet incursion on their nation's soil.|$|E
5|$|Vizzini’s {{support for}} the DC was not a secret. During the crucial 1948 {{elections}} that would decide on Italy’s post-war future, Vizzini and Genco Russo sat {{at the same table}} with leading DC politicians, attending an electoral lunch. In the course of the start of the Cold War, the 1948 elections were a triumph for the Christian Democrats, who would govern Italy with up and downs for the next 45 years in different coalitions. One of its main aims was to keep the <b>Italian</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> – the biggest communist party in a NATO member state – away from power.|$|E

50|$|Already in the 1960s, Italy's FIAT built a car-assembling {{plant in}} the Soviet city of Tolyatti (a city named after the <b>Italian</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party's</b> {{secretary}} Palmiro Togliatti). Finally, {{for a long time}} Italy had the largest <b>communist</b> <b>party</b> in the Western world, with over 2 million members.|$|R
5|$|A few {{recent works}} {{have become a}} part of the modern repertoire, {{including}} scores and theatrical works by composers such as Luciano Berio, Luigi Nono, Franco Donatoni, and Sylvano Bussotti. These composers are not part of a distinct school or tradition, though they do share certain techniques and influences. By the 1970s, avant-garde classical music had become linked to the <b>Italian</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party,</b> while a revival of popular interest continued into the next decade, with foundations, festivals and organization created to promote modern music. Near the end of the 20th century, government sponsorship of musical institutions began to decline, and several RAI choirs and city orchestras were closed. Despite this, a number of composers gained international reputations in the early 21st century.|$|E
5|$|In July 1943, Calogero Vizzini {{allegedly}} {{helped the}} American army during {{the invasion of}} Sicily during World War II (Operation Husky). In the US, the Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI) had recruited mafia support to protect the New York City waterfront from Axis Powers sabotage since the US had entered the war in December 1941. The ONI collaborated with Lucky Luciano and his partner Meyer Lansky, a Jewish mobster, in what was called Operation Underworld. The resulting Mafia contacts were also used by the US Office of Strategic Services (OSS) – the wartime predecessor of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) – during the invasion of Sicily. Later, the alliance was maintained in order to check the growing strength of the <b>Italian</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>party</b> on the island.|$|E

50|$|The CIA {{provided}} {{an average of}} $5 million annually in covert aid to Italy from the late 1940s to the early 1960s. This aid went towards financially supporting centrist Italian governments and using the awarding of contracts to weaken the <b>Italian</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party's</b> hold on labor unions.|$|R
50|$|Whereas Eurocommunist {{factions in}} the French and <b>Italian</b> <b>communist</b> <b>parties</b> fairly {{successfully}} managed {{to impose their}} agenda on the party platforms, things were not so simple in other countries. In Britain, particularly, there were bitter struggles from the 1970s on. The party became divided into 'Euros' and 'tankies' (so called for their support of Soviet interventions in Eastern Bloc countries).|$|R

25|$|The early-1978 {{proposition}} by Moro of a Christian Democracy-Italian Socialist Party cabinet supported {{also by the}} <b>Italian</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> {{was strongly}} opposed by both super-powers. The United States feared that the collaboration of an Italian government with the Communists might have allowed these later to gain information on strategic NATO military plans and installations, and pass them to Soviet agents. Moreover, the participation in government of the Communists in a Western country would have represented a cultural failure for the USA. The Soviets considered potential participation by the <b>Italian</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> in a cabinet a form of emancipation from Moscow and rapprochement to the Americans, therefore also opposing it.|$|E
25|$|Spinelli {{was born}} in Rome, and joined the <b>Italian</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> (PCI) {{at an early age}} in order to oppose the regime of Benito Mussolini's National Fascist Party. Following his entry into radical journalism, he was arrested in 1927 and spent ten years in prison and a further six in confinement. During the war he was interned on the island of Ventotene (in the Gulf of Gaeta) along with some eight hundred other {{political}} opponents of the regime. During those years, he broke with the <b>Italian</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> over Stalin's purges (resulting in him being ostracised by many of the other prisoners), but refused to compromise with the fascist regime, despite offers of early release.|$|E
25|$|On 26 September 2006, Napolitano made an {{official}} visit to Budapest, Hungary, where he {{paid tribute to}} the fallen in the 1956 revolution, which he initially opposed as member of the <b>Italian</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party,</b> by laying a wreath at Imre Nagy's grave.|$|E
50|$|After the {{armistice}} of 8 September 1943, {{as a central}} member of the National Liberation Committee, the Action Party actively participated in the Italian resistance movement with units of Giustizia e Libertà commanded by Ferruccio Parri. It maintained a clear anti-monarchical position and it was opposed to Togliatti and the <b>Italian</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party's</b> Salerno Initiative for postwar governance. The party adopted the symbol of a flaming sword.|$|R

25|$|The {{repression}} by the Fascist {{regime of}} its opponents {{within the region}} was ruthless. Antonio Gramsci, {{one of the founders}} of <b>Italian</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party,</b> was arrested and died in prison.

25|$|In 1976–1977, Berlinguer's <b>Italian</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> {{broke with}} Moscow, and convened with the Spanish and French parties {{to draw the}} lines of Eurocommunism. Such a move made an {{eventual}} collaboration more acceptable for DC voters, and the two parties began an intense parliamentary debate, {{in a moment of}} deep social crises.|$|E
5000|$|In 1973, the <b>Italian</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party's</b> General Secretary Enrico Berlinguer {{launched}} {{a proposal for}} a [...] "democratic alliance" [...] with the Christian Democracy, embraced by Aldo Moro. This alliance was inspired by the Allende Government in Chile, that was composed by a left-wing coalition Popular Unity and supported by the Christian Democratic Party. After the Chilean coup of the same year, there was an approach between PCI and DC, that became a political alliance in 1976. In this time, the Berlinguer's PCI attempted also a parting from the USSR, with the launch of the [...] "Eurocommunism" [...] along with the Spanish <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> and the French <b>Communist</b> <b>Party.</b>|$|R
40|$|Until now, {{there has}} been little in either Italian or English that clearly maps {{the rise and fall of}} the 'autonomist Marxism' movement. Steve Wright, an {{academic}} at Monash University, has pulled off something of a coup with "Storming Heaven", creating a remarkably readable and thorough discussion not only of autonomist ideas but of the successes and failures of their political practice. Wright traces the origins of autonomism to the late 1940 s and the <b>Italian</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party’s</b> shift towards the centre...|$|R

The call for this alliance was inspired by the overthrow of the Allende Government in Chile. For Berlinguer, the events in Chile proved that the Marxist left could not aspire to govern in democratic countries without establishing alliances with more moderate forces. After the 1973 Chilean coup, there was cooperation between the PCI and DC that became a political alliance in 1976. Then Berlinguer's PCI attempted to distance itself from the USSR, with the launching of [...] "Eurocommunism" [...] along with the Spanish <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> and the French <b>Communist</b> <b>Party.</b>|$|R
