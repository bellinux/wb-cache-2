2500|$|In {{his later}} years, Sima Yi favoured his {{concubine}} Lady Bai (柏夫人) and started neglecting Zhang Chunhua. Once, when Sima Yi was ill, Zhang Chunhua visited him, {{and he said}} to her, [...] "Old creature, your looks are disgusting! Why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>even</b> bother to visit me?" [...] Zhang Chunhua became angry and attempted to starve herself to death. Their sons did so too. Sima Yi was so shocked that he immediately apologised to his wife and reconciled with her. Sima Yi later secretly told someone, [...] "It doesn't matter if that old creature died. I was actually worried about my boys!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{what did}} I say to you?" [...] cried Mrs Davidson, exultant, next morning. [...] "Did {{you ever hear}} {{anything}} more dreadful? You don't wonder that I couldn't tell you myself, <b>do</b> <b>you?</b> <b>Even</b> though you are a doctor." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'If {{all this}} be true,' said I, 'and if your mission is indeed {{as you have}} said, why <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>even</b> now propose to make for France?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] she answered, motioning {{to him to}} sit down. [...] "Please stay." [...] She {{seemed to}} rouse herself with an effort. [...] "Of course, {{there was only one}} thing George could do when he was lamed--send them on. But Clarence, who was with him, never made his fortitude and cheerfulness so clear as <b>you</b> have <b>done.</b> <b>You</b> <b>even</b> {{mentioned}} the exact words he said now and then--how <b>did</b> <b>you</b> hear of them?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I came," [...] {{she said}} softly, [...] "because {{it was the}} only atonement I could make. I ought to have trusted <b>you.</b> <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> know, <b>even</b> my father told me that." ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{turned to}} me. The hard, inflexible, persecuting woman, turned {{with a mild}} {{expression}} of face, and said, [...] "If our beloved angel sees us now, it will delight her to find that I <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>even</b> tardy justice. You were worthy of her; and from my heart I am glad that you won her away from me. Pardon, my son, the many wrongs I have done you; forget my bitter words and unkind treatment--take me, and govern me as you will." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{are in a}} hurry, you are," [...] {{the other}} said. [...] "You don't suppose {{we are going to}} take Canada in a week's time, <b>do</b> <b>you.</b> <b>Even</b> if the Canadians join us, and by what I hear that aint so sartin after all, we shall have to march down to Quebec, and that's no child's play. I know the country there. It is now September 4. Another month and the winter will be upon us, and a Canadian winter is no joke, I can tell you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 64. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>even</b> know {{distinctly}} {{from each}} other,--(for {{that is the}} real naturalist's business; instead of confounding them with each other),--do you know distinctly the five great species of this familiar bird?--the swallow, the house-martin, the sand-martin, the swift, and the Alpine swift?--or can you so much as answer the first question which would suggest itself to any careful observer of the form of its most familiar species,--yet which I do not find proposed, far less answered, in any scientific book,--namely, why a swallow has a swallow-tail? ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'How <b>do</b> <b>you</b> know, you heap of confusion,' asked Mrs Clennam sternly, 'that in <b>doing</b> what <b>you</b> are <b>doing</b> now, <b>you</b> are <b>even</b> serving Arthur?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'With my daughter, sir? Pelagia! Will <b>you</b> insult me? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> suppose, <b>even</b> if her own pity should so far tempt her {{to degrade}} herself, that I could allow her so to {{contaminate}} her purity?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Most certainly. Marian {{ask me to}} tell! {{you must}} be dreaming. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> think, <b>even</b> if Marian were capable of making an advance, that I would consent {{to act as a}} go-between? Really, Mr. Douglas!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not {{think any}} more about it! My child, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>even</b> faintly realize what five {{thousand}} dollars--or a quarter of five thousand dollars--means to me? I {{would do anything for}} it--anything! And there's the fun of it. I don't suppose you can realize that, either. I want a change. I've been grubbing away here on nothing a week for years, and it's time I had a vacation. There must be a way by which you could get me down--Why, of course! Why didn't I think of it before! You shall take me on Friday as your lady's maid!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Your {{hands are}} indeed burning," [...] the sister said, convinced, {{as soon as}} she touched them, that the countess was really indisposed. [...] "Yes; and your pulse is beating quicker than I can count. Yes, you have a touch of fever. I will mix you a draught and bring it up to you at once. Hark! that is the first peal of thunder; {{we are going to have}} a storm. It will clear the air, and <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>even</b> more good than my medicine. I will leave you here for tonight; if you are not better {{tomorrow}} we will move you into the infirmary." ...|$|E
6000|$|Laura bent her head, resting it on {{the back}} of her hand, on the leathern arm of the sofa. So she remained, while Lionel stood smoking; but at last, to leave the room, she got up with an effort that was a {{physical}} pain. He came to her, to detain her, with a little good intention that had no felicity for her, trying to take her hand persuasively. 'Dear old girl, don't try and behave just as she did! If you'll stay quietly here I won't call you, I give you my honour I won't; there! You want to see the doctor--that's the fellow you want to see. And what good will it <b>do</b> <b>you,</b> <b>even</b> if you bring her home in pink paper? Do you candidly suppose I'll ever look at her--except across the court-room?' ...|$|E
6000|$|Dorian rose up {{from the}} piano, and passed {{his hand through his}} hair. [...] "Yes, life has been exquisite," [...] he murmured, [...] "but I am {{not going to have the}} same life, Harry. And you must not say these extravagant things to me. You don't know {{everything}} about me. I think that if <b>you</b> <b>did,</b> <b>even</b> <b>you</b> would turn from me. You laugh. Don't laugh." ...|$|R
2500|$|When General Wilhelm Keitel, {{the head}} of the OKW, {{explained}} the political importance of the offensive, Guderian remarked, [...] "How many people <b>do</b> <b>you</b> think <b>even</b> know where Kursk is? It's a matter of profound indifference to the world whether we hold Kursk or not..." ...|$|R
6000|$|BUILDER. The disrespect of you {{young people}} is {{something}} extraordinary. And {{that reminds me}} where <b>do</b> <b>you</b> go every <b>evening</b> now after tea? ...|$|R
60|$|An {{accidental}} merit, {{thinks the}} reader? No, reader, you may believe me, {{it is by}} no means altogether such. Nay, I rather think, could we look into the Account-Books of the Recording Angel for a course of centuries, no part of it is such! There are Nations in which a Friedrich is, or can be, possible; and again there are Nations in which he is not and cannot. To be practically reverent of Human Worth to the due extent, and abhorrent of Human Want of Worth in the like proportion, do you understand that art at all? I fear, not,--or that you are much forgetting it again! Human Merit, do you really love it enough, think you;--human Scoundrelism (brought to the dock for you, and branded as scoundrel), <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>even</b> abhor it enough? Without that reverence and its corresponding opposite-pole of abhorrence, there is simply no possibility left. That, my friend, is the outcome and summary of all virtues in this world, for a man or for a Nation of men. It is the supreme strength and glory of a Nation;--without which, indeed, all other strengths, and enormities of bullion and arsenals and warehouses, are no strength. None, I should say;--and are oftenest even the REVERSE.|$|E
6000|$|... "To dust? Prince, if I am mistaken, why am I {{the best}} of wizards, or the worst, and why did your jaw drop and your face change at my words, and why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>even</b> now touch your dry lips with your tongue? Yes, I {{know that it is}} dark here, yet some can see in it, and I am one of them. Ay, Prince, and I can see your mind also. You would be rid of your father: he has lived too long. Moreover his love turns to Nodwengo, the good and gentle; and perhaps--who can say?--it is even in his thought, when all his regiments are about him two days hence, to declare that you, Prince, are deposed, and that your brother, Nodwengo, shall be king in your stead. Now, Nodwengo you cannot kill; he is too well loved and too well guarded. If he died suddenly, his dead lips would call out 'Murder!' in the ears of all men; and, Prince, all eyes would turn to you, who alone could profit by his end. But if the king should chance to die--why he is old, is he not? and such things happen to the old. Also he grows feeble, and will not suffer the regiments to be doctored for war, {{although}} day by day they clamour to be led to battle; for he seeks to end his years in peace." ...|$|E
5000|$|Besides showing readers' mail, the OXM crew {{revealed}} their 'Top 5' {{things on}} their {{mind at the}} moment. The 'Top 5' tradition was broken in Issue #85 of July 2008, when the staff instead answered to the question [...] "What's your worst habit - and <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>even</b> want to break it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What can I <b>do</b> for <b>you</b> this <b>evening,</b> Mr. Cuthbert?" [...] Miss Lucilla Harris inquired, briskly and ingratiatingly, {{tapping the}} counter with both hands.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am glad! I {{should like}} to see you Member for Medchester. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> know, <b>even</b> now, {{although}} I am so happy, I cannot think about the last few months there without a shudder. It seemed to me that things were getting worse and worse. The people's faces haunt me sometimes." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is an accident," [...] he answered. [...] "Besides, {{it is not}} so. You sing {{better than}} Annabel ever <b>did,</b> <b>you</b> have <b>even</b> a better style. 'Alcide' or no 'Alcide,' {{there is not a}} music hall manager in London or Paris who would not give you an {{engagement}} on your own merits." ...|$|R
50|$|One day, a Mullah asks Sharif, “So, I see you’ve {{stopped coming}} to the mosque! <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>even</b> {{remember}} what Namaz is?” To this, Sharif calmly replies, pointing at His own body, “I dwell in this mosque, so why go and come? I am in constant worship of “I AM”, so what can be greater Namaz?” The Mullah was dumbstruck.|$|E
5000|$|Anderson blasted Couppee at halftime, screaming, [...] "When we {{get down}} on the goal line, there's just one guy on this {{football}} team that should get that football! <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>even</b> know who he is? Why don't you meet Nile Kinnick!" [...] Anderson then forced Couppee to walk over to Kinnick and [...] "introduce" [...] himself and shake his hand.|$|E
5000|$|Robertson {{is an avid}} pinball {{player and}} collector. The title of Barenaked Ladies 2015 album [...] "Silverball" [...] {{reflects}} this, and the music video for the title track was filmed in Robertson's own collection of 10 pinball machines. In February 2016 Ed appeared on the popular Twitch pinball stream [...] "Bro, <b>Do</b> <b>You</b> <b>Even</b> Pinball?" [...] where {{he talked about his}} love for the game and competed against the shows hosts from Buffalo Pinball.|$|E
6000|$|... "'This is {{all very}} fine, Courtenay Ivor--all very fine in its way; but {{how are you going}} to prove it? that's the real question. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> think any jury in England will believe, on your {{unsupported}} oath, such a cock-and-bull story? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> think, <b>even</b> if Richard Wharton's come back, and you've got him on your side, I can't cross-examine all the life out of his body?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{pretended to}} <b>do</b> it, and <b>you</b> <b>even</b> pretended {{reluctance}} {{to make me}} more willing to trust you. Then you began to use your ingenuity {{to get him out}} of the way." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "At once, {{without the}} delay of an hour. Lady Harry started last night. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> start this <b>evening.</b> She will thus {{have you with}} her twenty-four hours after her arrival." ...|$|R

5000|$|Margeaux Watson of Entertainment Weekly took a major {{swipe at}} the group for their overemphasis of Scherzinger as the lead singer. Watson said, [...] "there {{are two kinds of}} girl groups: those {{anchored}} by a superstar (the Supremes, Destiny's Child), and those made up of charismatic personalities endowed with limited individual gifts (Spice Girls, TLC). The Pussycat Dolls are neither—they're a brand, not a band. This follow-up to 2005's multi-platinum PCD finds lead Doll Nicole Scherzinger in the spotlight, and she's no Beyoncé. As for the others, well...can you name them? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>even</b> know how many there are?" ...|$|E

5000|$|With {{his friends}} Xena and Gabrielle now dead, Eli begins doubting {{the power of}} his god. Amarice blames him because his preaching the Way of Love made Gabrielle weak. He asks his god: [...] "What good is this gift if I can't at least protect the ones I love? Why <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>even</b> give this to me? What am I {{supposed}} to do?" [...] Eli's god answers his questions when the powers in heaven send an angelic Callisto to Eli in a vision. In the vision she tells Eli that he must use his powers to bring Xena and Gabrielle back from the dead. He begins praying to his god for help, and Callisto comes to aid him in resurrecting Xena and Gabrielle.|$|R
