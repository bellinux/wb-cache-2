500|$|Joel wrote [...] "Captain Jack" [...] in late 1971, {{while sitting}} in his {{apartment}} in Oyster Bay, Long Island, looking out the window, trying to find inspiration for a song. Across the street was a housing project, and he observed suburban teenagers going into the project and obtaining heroin from a dealer known as [...] "Captain Jack". [...] "It's about {{coming out of the}} New York suburbs," [...] Joel told John Kalodner in 1974. [...] "But in my travels <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>a</b> lot of the same suburb all over the country. [...] The song is sort of brutal, but sometimes it is good to be brutal and offend people—it keeps them on their toes." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{a letter}} to his friend and {{landlord}} Lorenz Hagenauer (1712–1792), written after the tour, Leopold quotes the German diplomat Friedrich Melchior, Baron von Grimm, who after hearing the children play had said: [...] "Now for once in my life <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>a</b> miracle: this is the first". Leopold believed that it was his duty to proclaim this miracle to the world, otherwise he would be [...] "the most ungrateful creature". He was said to have describe Wolfgang as [...] "The miracle which God let be born in Salzburg". Mozart biographer Wolfgang Hildesheimer has suggested that, at least in the case of Wolfgang, this venture was premature: [...] "Too soon, [...] father dragged [...] son all over Western Europe for years. This continual change of scene would have worn out even a robust child..." [...] However, there is little evidence to suggest that Wolfgang was physically harmed or musically hindered by these childhood exertions; it seems that he felt equal to the challenge from the start.|$|E
2500|$|<b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>a</b> {{little fellow}} {{of six years}} old, with a troop of fat {{toddlers}} of only three and four, teaching [...] to throw stones at a Jew, and one little urchin would, with the greatest coolness, waddle up to the man and literally spit upon his Jewish gaberdine. To all this the Jew is obliged to submit; {{it would be more}} than his life was worth to offer to strike a Mahommedan.|$|E
60|$|Although at {{that time}} <b>I</b> <b>had</b> never <b>seen</b> <b>a</b> gorilla in the flesh, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>a</b> {{coloured}} picture of the brute, and if that picture had been photographed on the flower the likeness {{could not have been}} more perfect.|$|R

2500|$|Hamas {{spokesman}} Moussa Abu Marzouk {{blamed the}} conflict between Hamas and Fatah on Israel, stating that the constant pressure of economic sanctions resulted in the [...] "real explosion." [...] Associated Press reporter Ibrahim Barzak wrote an eyewitness account stating: [...] "Today I have seen people shot before my eyes, I heard the screams of terrified {{women and children in}} a burning building, and I argued with gunmen who wanted to take over my home. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>a</b> lot in my years as a journalist in Gaza, but this is the worst it's been." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1884, the 17-year-old Beatrix Potter spotted Ruskin at the Royal Academy of Arts exhibition. She {{wrote in}} her journal, [...] "Mr Ruskin {{was one of the}} most ridiculous figures <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen.</b> <b>A</b> very old hat, much necktie and aged coat buttoned up on his neck, humpbacked, not {{particularly}} clean looking. He had on high boots, and one of his trousers was tucked up on the top of one. He became aware of this half way round the room, and stood on one leg to put it right, but in doing so hitched up the other trouser worse than the first one had been." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{show was}} almost universally {{critically}} panned. [...] Matt Roush {{wrote in his}} USA Today review that Curry [...] "gives it his maul", and that the show's leads seemed [...] "lost in the TV equivalent of summer stock". Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly went one step further, likening it to a variation of The Odd Couple that possessed [...] "neither romantic spark nor crisp verbal byplay". [...] The Los Angeles Daily News claimed {{it was the worst}} new show of the season, and that if you tuned in to the show at 8:30, you would [...] "probably be watching something else by 8:38". TeeVee's Peter Ko wrote a lengthy review (which itself got some publicity nine years later) in which he heavily bashed Curry, then he went on to state, [...] "I have stood in a freezer full of dead people at the morgue. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>a</b> man's scalp pulled back over his nose. I've even seen 35 minutes of Ellen DeGeneres's Mr. Wrong. But I can now honestly say that until Steve Carell's turn in the premiere of Over the Top, I have never known true horror." [...] The Washington Posts Tom Shales, on the other hand, was substantially kinder than most critics, saying [...] "the show seemed merely okay at first encounter," [...] but after seeing the season's other new shows, [...] "Over the Top is looking better and better. [...] I could almost kiss it right on the lips." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>have</b> {{followed}} {{the example of}} Botanists, and added the interjection [!] to synonyms, when <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>an</b> authentic specimen bearing the name in question.|$|R

6000|$|... "Shall I!" [...] {{cried the}} young midshipman, laughing; [...] "then <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>a</b> little clipper, in disguise, out sail an old man-of-war's {{man in a}} hard chase, and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>a</b> straggling rover in long-togs as much like my cousin----" ...|$|E

60|$|A few minutes, {{thinking}} thus, I paced up and down. Then, glancing casually for'ard, {{along the}} port side, I leaped like a startled deer {{and in a}} blind madness of terror rushed aft along the poop, heading for the cabin. Gone was all my arrogance of youth and my intellectual calm. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>a</b> ghost. There, in the dim light, where we had flung the dead man overboard, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>a</b> faint and wavering form. Six-feet in length it was, slender, and of substance so attenuated that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> distinctly <b>seen</b> through it the tracery of the fore-rigging.|$|R
6000|$|... .... There {{is nothing}} so {{progressive}} as grief, and nothing so infectious as progress. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>an</b> acre of cemetery infected {{by a single}} innovation in spelling cut upon a tombstone.|$|R
6000|$|Nigel {{scratched}} his head. [...] "Surely, fair sir, I would {{be content to}} say that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>a</b> number of lions, if indeed I could say aught after so wondrous an adventure." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "My dear boy, {{you must}} have seen--you cannot have helped seeing--that my time is not long here. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>an</b> English doctor today, {{and he says the}} end may come at any moment." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>an</b> {{extract from}} a private letter of Mr. Chorley, editor of the 'Athenaeum,'[48] which speaks huge praises of my poems. If he were to say a tithe of them in print, it would be nine times above my expectation! ...|$|R
60|$|I said no, {{this was}} the first one <b>I</b> <b>had</b> ever <b>seen.</b> It cost me a pang to tell that generous lie, for <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>a</b> million of them in my time, this humble jewel of hers being nothing but a {{battered}} old New York Central baggage check.|$|R

60|$|We {{were both}} a little {{surprised}} at the encounter, and <b>I</b> fancied <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>a</b> momentary shrinking from me {{in the eyes of}} the girl. This at once furnished cause for wonder, and hurt me. She had shown no shrinking at our last meeting.|$|R
60|$|Though I ran quickly back to {{the spot}} where the {{shadower}} <b>had</b> disappeared <b>I</b> could find no trace of him, yet in the brief glimpse that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> caught <b>I</b> could <b>have</b> sworn that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>a</b> white face surmounted by a mass of yellow hair.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{was seeking}} you, sir, for <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>a</b> strange sight," [...] said Dick. [...] "That woman who {{spoke with us}} at Tideswell was here again; yea, and she talked with the little old Frenchman that they call Gorion, the same that is with Cis now." ...|$|R

6000|$|She {{passed on}} to greet a {{decrepit}} old lord with a languishing smile, and I stood staring after her with, I fear, a somewhat stupid expression, until some young fool came up grinning, to ask me whether <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>a</b> ghost or backed a [...] "wrong 'un." ...|$|R
6000|$|After a while, I {{asked them}} if these volcanoes did not cast out a kind of liquid fire, as <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>an</b> account of on the eruptions at Mount-Ætna, which cast out, as we are told, a prodigious stream of fire, and run several leagues into the sea? ...|$|R
