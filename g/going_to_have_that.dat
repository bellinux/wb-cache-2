Don't {{spend the money}} unless you're sure you're going to have the permit. No, I can't tell you that I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>that</b> permit until June, but we need to plan like we're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>that</b> permit in June. And so probably the biggest lesson is to make sure we could smooth out the on/off switches wherever we could and take control of our own destiny.|$|E
500|$|Phineas and Ferb makes liberal use {{of running}} gags, and Phineas has several {{recurrent}} lines that are featured in most episodes. When {{he comes up}} with an idea of what adventure he and his brother are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>that</b> day, he says [...] "Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today!" [...] During the course of an adventure, Phineas is generally asked by a disbelieving adult if he is not [...] "a little young to be..." [...] part of whatever occupation he is currently carrying out. For example, while constructing a shrine to his sister on the face of Mount Rushmore, a park ranger asks him [...] "Aren't you boys a little young to be restoring a national monument?" [...] Phineas generally answers [...] "Yes, yes I am," [...] though on a few occasions has responded [...] "No" [...] or [...] "Well, I don't think so." ...|$|E
2500|$|Dammeier {{addressed}} the SCA and Richland's argument {{that it was}} too complex to bear on the reasonableness of Quon's expectation of privacy. [...] "It certainly may be not the end-all to the question, but it should be a factor in determining whether or not there’s going to be an expectation of privacy". Scalia said he had not been aware of the statute, and asked if it was reasonable to assume that Quon did. [...] "Petitioners make an argument that because there is this California Public Records Act, that that may diminish one's expectation of privacy", Dammeier said. [...] "Certainly, if we're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>that,</b> then we should also be having the Stored Communications Act." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{characters}} of Rosario + Vampire have received criticism from publications dedicated to anime, manga, and other media. Theron Martin of Anime News Network describes Tsukune as a [...] "cookie-cutter harem male lead, an unfailingly kind-hearted, indecisive wimp who primarily has {{a thing for}} Moka but still treasures the other girls as friends." [...] Carlo Santos of Anime News Network, in reviewing the manga, noted Tsukune's character design as lazy: [...] "shove in any other male protagonist from a harem series and nobody would notice too much". He found the girls [...] "distinctive, if predictable (the beauty, the boobs, the jailbait)", but concluded in a later volume that [...] "The story's never going to go anywhere, the characters {{are never going to}} go anywhere, and the artwork is always <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>that</b> same polished-but-flawed look." [...] Stig Høgset of THEM Anime Reviews found Moka to be ditzy and a [...] "pink-haired dolt"; he criticized her lack of vampire weaknesses such as walking around in broad daylight at a beach, but found her alternate personality as [...] "pretty damn badass", [...] "a great addition to the show, if a severely underutilized one", and wished that her character was developed better. Deb Aoki of About.com called Moka a magical ditz who loves the doofus but also kicks butt. Neil Lumbard of DVD Talk noted that Kokoa is not another character that has a massive crush on the same guy; however, Høgset noted that her anime role was reduced to obnoxious comedy acts.|$|E

6000|$|This was {{received}} with much {{approval by the}} crowd, which had evidently more than half-forgotten the terrible purpose for which it had assembled there, and was now much interested in what bid fair to be a keen dispute. When the noise abated, Dan raised his voice and said--"If Burke had not interrupted me, I was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> said <b>that</b> another thing which proves the letter to be no forgery is, that the post-mark of San Francisco is {{on the back of}} it, with the date all right." ...|$|R

Henderson told his team that their performances were not acceptable and they were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> practice <b>that</b> next morning at 7 a.m. “I suggested they stay home because I was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> try to kill them,” says Henderson. As the next week came Henderson and the Gladiators shocked the undefeated and fourth ranked Dunwoody, 14-7. Not to mention this game was their first victory of the season. This team worked very hard and won the sub-region championship.|$|R
2500|$|In 2013, Bruce Forsyth {{questioned}} the show's allowing children to audition. He said, [...] "I don't think that's entertainment. I don't {{think they should}} put children on that are too young. If you're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do <b>that,</b> <b>have</b> a separate show.

6000|$|Penelope recoiled {{from this}} terrible courage; {{she did not}} answer directly, and Irene went on, [...] "Because if you did, I'll thank you {{to bring him back}} again.

2500|$|Mattis {{believes}} that Iran {{is the principal}} threat to {{the stability of the}} Middle East, ahead of Al-Qaeda and ISIS. Mattis says: [...] "I consider ISIS nothing more than an excuse for Iran to continue its mischief. Iran is not an enemy of ISIS. They <b>have</b> a lot <b>to</b> gain from the turmoil in the region that ISIS creates." [...] On the Iran nuclear deal, although he sees it as a poor agreement, he believes there is now no way to tear it up, saying: [...] "We are just <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> recognize <b>that</b> we <b>have</b> an imperfect arms control agreement. Second, that what we achieved is a nuclear pause, not a nuclear halt". Mattis argues that the nuclear inspections may fail to prevent Iran from seeking to develop nuclear weapons, but that [...] "f nothing else at least we will have better targeting data if it comes to a fight in the future." ...|$|R

That traitor I intend to have, tonight; and if I have him, I will hang him, as sure as fate.|$|E
6000|$|... "Isn't {{it a good}} cubby-house? Ben Cox and I {{fixed it}} for Jill, and she can have it for hers.

6000|$|When the {{big brother}} {{came home and}} {{discovered}} {{what had been done}} he was in a mighty rage, and went off in search of the avaricious little rebel who had dared to destroy his work. But the little rebel was not to be caught; at the right moment he fled from the coming tempest to his parents and claimed their protection. Then the whole matter had to be inquired into, and the big boy was told that he was not to thrash his little brother, that he himself was to blame for everything on account of the extravagant language he had used, which the poor little fellow had taken quite seriously. If he actually believed The Tin Box article was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>that</b> disastrous effect on him, who could blame him for destroying it? ...|$|E
5000|$|From 2001 to 2004, the {{membership}} of the teams was based the origin of the jockeys rather the ownership of the horses, with two teams of six jockeys each: one team of jockeys from Great Britain and Ireland (GB&I), and one from ROW. [...] It was suggested in 2002 that team racing tactics used by GB&I captain Kieran Fallon contravened the Rules of Racing (he ran a two-mile race hard to tire the opposition, and then let his teammate Pat Eddery through to win). The controversy led to a Stewards' enquiry; Fallon's explanation that he took up the pace in a slow race was accepted, but there were complaints from Hughie Morrison who trained Fallon's ride, and later clarificatory changes to the Rules. Fallon was quoted as commenting laconically: [...] "They told me it was an individual team thing. I know I am from the west of Ireland but someone is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> explain <b>that</b> to me." ...|$|R
5000|$|January 10: The Chemung County Legislature {{voted to}} {{maintain}} the current arrangement. The Chemung County Executive said, [...] "If that place is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> survive, with us at least helping him to get him started, and the money he’s <b>going</b> <b>to</b> put in, this thing is doable. We’re either <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> an arena open {{at the end of}} the season, or we’re <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> an arena <b>that’s</b> closed. There’s no in-between.
