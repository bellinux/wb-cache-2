40|$|Interatomic {{pairwise}} {{methods are}} currently {{among the most}} popular and accurate ways to include <b>dispersion</b> <b>energy</b> in density functional theory (DFT) calculations. However, when applied to more than two atoms, these methods are still frequently perceived to be based on ad hoc assumptions, rather than a rigorous derivation from quantum mechanics. Starting from the adiabatic connection fluctuation-dissipation (ACFD) theorem, an exact expression for the electronic exchange-correlation energy, we demonstrate that the pairwise interatomic <b>dispersion</b> <b>energy</b> for an arbitrary collection of isotropic polarizable dipoles emerges from the second-order expansion of the ACFD formula. Moreover, for a system of quantum harmonic oscillators coupled through a dipole [...] dipole potential, we prove the equivalence between the full interaction energy obtained from the Hamiltonian diagonalization and the ACFD correlation energy in the random-phase approximation. This property makes the Hamiltonian diagonalization an efficient method for the calculation of the many-body <b>dispersion</b> <b>energy.</b> In addition, we show that the switching function used to damp the dispersion interaction at short distances arises from a short-range screened Coulomb potential, whose role is to account for the spatial spread of the individual atomic dipole moments. By using the ACFD formula we gain {{a deeper understanding of the}} approximations made in the interatomic pairwise approaches, providing a powerful formalism for further development of accurate and efficient methods for the calculation of the <b>dispersion</b> <b>energy...</b>|$|E
40|$|An {{accurate}} {{description of}} electron correlation {{is essential for}} the calculation of interaction energies in cases where <b>dispersion</b> <b>energy</b> is a major component, for example, for the rare gas atoms, physisorption on graphite, and graphene-graphene interactions. Such calculations are computationally demanding using supermolecule methods and the energies calculated lack a simple, physical interpretation. Alternatively density functional theories (DFTs) may be used to give an approximate estimate of the correlation energy. However, the physical nature of this DFT estimate of electron correlation energy is not well understood and, in fact, most current DFT methods do not describe <b>dispersion</b> <b>energy</b> at all. Hence, an analysis of the correlation energy contribution to interaction energies where <b>dispersion</b> <b>energy</b> is important is needed. In order to do this we provide an analysis of the correlation energy contribution to the potential energy curves of He 2, Ne 2, and Ar 2 in terms of the Hartree [...] Fock (HF) interaction term EintHF, a <b>dispersion</b> <b>energy</b> term Edisp and an electron correlation term EintC. EintC includes all other correlation energy effects besides Edisp and is shown to be repulsive, of a similar short range character to, but of smaller magnitude than EintHF.

40|$|<b>Dispersion</b> <b>energy</b> is {{calculated}} in the systems H 2 O–HOH, H 2 O–HF, H 3 N–HF, and HF–HF {{as a function}} of the intermolecular separation using a variety of methods. M≂ller–Plesset perturbation theory to second and third orders is applied in conjunction with polarized basis sets of 6 ‐ 311 G∗∗ type and with an extended basis set including a second set of polarization functions (DZ+ 2 P). These results are compared to a multipole expansion of the <b>dispersion</b> <b>energy,</b> based on the Unsöld approximation, carried out to the inverse tenth power of the intermolecular distance. Pairwise evaluation is also carried out using both atom–atom and bond–bond formulations. The MP 3 / 6 ‐ 311 G∗∗ results are in generally excellent accord with the leading R− 6 term of the multipole expansion. This expansion, if carried out to the R− 10 term, reproduces extremely well previously reported dispersion energies calculated via variation‐perturbation theory. Little damping of the expansion is required for intermolecular distances equal to or greater than the equilibrium separation. Although the asymptotic behavior of the MP 2 <b>dispersion</b> <b>energy</b> is somewhat different than that of the other methods, augmentation of the basis set by a second diffuse set of d functions leads to quite good agreement in the vicinity of the minima.

40|$|Strictly {{ab initio}} {{calculations}} of the <b>dispersion</b> <b>energy</b> are unfeasible in practice {{but for the}} smallest systems. A sensible alternative is to model the dispersion contribution through a damped multipolar expansion. This thesis proposes to represent the <b>dispersion</b> <b>energy</b> {{by means of a}} non-empirical, atom-atom model using damping functions scaled from 'exact' results for one electron-one electron systems. We start by investigating the scalability of ab initio calculated damping functions for closed-shell atom-atom dimers. Ab initio scaling parameters are employed to assess the quality of the damping functions yielded by a predictor scheme based on the charge overlap between the interacting monomers. The investigation of the scaling properties is extended to atom-linear molecule systems, focusing on the dependence on orientation of the short-range <b>dispersion</b> <b>energy</b> and how to account for it using isotropic damping parameters. We study the possibilities of an 'atomic' (multicentre) representation of the <b>dispersion</b> <b>energy,</b> in contrast to the conventional 'molecular' (single-centre) picture, devising a well-defined method to obtain 'atomic' dispersion coefficients from the computed molecular ones, as well as 'atomic' damping parameters. In all the studied cases, the 'atomic' approach describes more adequately the anisotropy of the interaction, through a localisation process of the charge overlap effects. The CO sub 2 /CO case, in particular, encourages to believe in the transferability of 'atomic' dispersion coefficients and damping parameters, which being confirmed by further work, the present results can be regarded as the basis of an universal and affordable model to estimate the dispersion contribution in intermolecular potentials...|$|E

For structural studies, {{soil organic matter}} can be isolated in particle size fractions after complete dispersion of the aggregates by ultrasonication. The ultrasonic <b>dispersion</b> <b>energy</b> necessary for complete dispersion was investigated in three A and two B horizons originating from four soils differing in pedogenesis (Gleysol, Phaeozem, Podzol, Alisol), organic C (4. 2 - 34. 5 g kg(- 1)) and clay content (24 - 294 g kg(- 1)). Calorimetric calibration of five probe-type ultrasonifiers revealed that the actual energy output from an instrument can depart widely from its nominal output, and that this discrepancy varies from instrument to instrument. Calorimetric calibration is therefore essential for consistency and comparisons between laboratories. Between 450 and 500 J ml(- 1) of ultrasonic <b>dispersion</b> <b>energy</b> was enough to disperse completely all samples investigated. The particle size distributions obtained were close to those from standard analysis, except for smaller yields (- 20 to - 80 g kg(- 1)) of sand size fractions, which suggests that dispersion by ultrasound is more effective.
