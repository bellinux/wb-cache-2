5|$|Though {{different}} theories abound as to {{the exact}} centuries the kulintang was finally realized, there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>consensus</b> that kulintang music developed from a foreign musical tradition which was borrowed and adapted to the indigenous music tradition already present in the area. It’s likely the earliest gongs used among the indigenous populace had no recreational value but were simply used for making signals and sending messages.|$|E
5|$|The mid-1880s {{marked a}} turning point in Shaw's life, both {{personally}} and professionally: he lost his virginity, had two novels published, and began a career as a critic. He had been celibate until his twenty-ninth birthday, when his shyness was overcome by Jane (Jenny) Patterson, a widow some years his senior. Their affair continued, not always smoothly, for eight years. Shaw's sex life has caused much speculation and debate among his biographers, but there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>consensus</b> that the relationship with Patterson was one of his few non-platonic romantic liaisons.|$|E

5|$|The vast {{majority}} of Amir's writings were published in Poedjangga Baroe, although some earlier ones were published in Timboel and Pandji Poestaka. None of his creative works are dated, {{and there is no}} consensus regarding when individual poems were written. However, there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>consensus</b> that the works included in Nyanyi Sunyi were written after those included in Buah Rindu, despite the latter being published last. Johns writes that the poems in the collections appear to be arranged in chronological order; he points to the various degrees of maturity Amir showed as his writing developed.|$|E
5|$|The {{main body}} of most {{clarinets}} is divided into the upper joint, the holes and most keys of which are operated by the left hand, and the lower joint with holes and most keys operated by the right hand. Some clarinets have a single joint: on some basset horns and larger clarinets the two joints are held together with a screw clamp and are usually not disassembled for storage. The left thumb operates both a tone hole and the register key. On some models of clarinet, such as many Albert system clarinets and increasingly some higher-end Boehm system clarinets, the register key is a 'wraparound' key, with the key {{on the back of}} the clarinet and the pad on the front. Advocates of the wraparound register key say it improves sound, and it is harder for moisture to accumulate in the tube beneath the pad. Nevertheless, there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>consensus</b> among repair techs that this type of register key is harder to keep in adjustment, i.e., it is hard to have enough spring pressure to close the hole securely.|$|E

25|$|There is a {{wide range}} of {{published}} energy-related studies which conclude that energy efficiency programs and renewable power technologies are a better energy option than nuclear power plants.

Organization of African Unity in 1963 cemented colonial boundaries permanently by proclaiming that any changes made were illegitimate. This, in effect, avoided readdressing the basic injustice of colonial partition, while also reducing the likelihood of inter-state warfare as territorial boundaries were considered immutable by the international community.|$|E
25|$|Unlike provincial {{government}}s {{and the government of}} Yukon, the government of the Northwest Territories does not have political parties, except for the period between 1898 and 1905. It <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>consensus</b> government called the Legislative Assembly. This group is composed of one member elected from each of the nineteen constituencies. After each general election, the new Assembly elects the Premier and the Speaker by secret ballot. Seven MLAs are also chosen as cabinet ministers, with the remainder forming the opposition.|$|E
25|$|One {{implication}} of the Laffer curve is that increasing tax rates beyond a certain point is counter-productive for raising further tax revenue.

There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>consensus</b> among leading economists that {{a reduction in the}} US federal income tax rate would not raise annual total tax revenue.|$|E

25|$|Although his {{presidency}} was initially regarded fairly poorly, now, two decades later, there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>consensus</b> {{across much of}} the political spectrum that Bush was a president of some consequence, a man of conscience and reason, a steady hand at a time of geopolitical instability. A 2014 survey of 162 members of the American Political Science Association’s Presidents and Executive Politics section ranked Bush 17th among the 43 individuals who had at that time been president, immediately beneath James Monroe and above Barack Obama. Respondents also identified him (along with Dwight D. Eisenhower and Harry S. Truman) as the most underrated president.|$|E
25|$|The {{impact of}} World War I on the {{evolution}} of Canada’s identity is debated by historians. While there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>consensus</b> that {{on the eve of the}} war, most English speaking Canadians had a hybrid imperial-national identity, the war's effects on Canada’s emergence as a nation are complex. The Canadian media often refers to the First World War and, in particular, the Battle of Vimy Ridge, as marking “the birth of a nation.” Some historians consider the First World War to be Canada’s “war of independence.” They argue that the war decreased the extent to which Canadians identified with the British Empire and intensified their sense of being Canadians first and British subjects second.|$|E
25|$|On 1 January 1944 the State National Council (Krajowa Rada Narodowa, KRN) {{replaced}} the Gwardia Ludowa with the AL. The KRN intended to gain volunteers from other groups. Upon its establishment, the organization comprised some 10,000 members. By {{the end of}} July 1944 (when much of Poland had been occupied by the Red Army) there were some 20,000–30,000 members, 5,000 of them being Soviet nationals. Lower estimates quote about 14,000 as its peak strength, whereas high estimates double the middle number, up to 50,000–60,000. About 6,000 of them were active full-time partisans. There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>consensus</b> among scholars that whatever its exact size, AL was much smaller ("a fraction of") than the primary Polish resistance organization, the Armia Krajowa (Home Army).|$|E
