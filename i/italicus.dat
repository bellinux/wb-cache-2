Plutarch wrote of the sky being on fire near Naples and Silius <b>Italicus</b> mentioned in his epic poem Punica that Vesuvius had thundered and produced flames worthy of Mount Etna in that year, although both authors were writing around 250 years later. Greenland ice core samples of around that period show relatively high acidity, which is assumed to have been caused by atmospheric hydrogen sulfide.|$|E

25|$|There {{are little}} {{subsequent}} account of its fortunes. It {{appears to have}} been in Cicero's time a considerable municipal town. Silius <b>Italicus</b> speaks of it as abounding in fish, litus piscosa Calacte and its name, though omitted by Pliny, is found in Ptolemy, {{as well as in the}} Antonine Itineraries; but there is considerable difficulty in regard to its position. The distances given in the Tabula Peutingeriana, however (12 M. P. from Alaesa, and 30 M. P. from Cephaloedium), coincide with the site of the modern town of Caronia, on the shore below which Fazello tells us that ruins and vestiges of an ancient city were still visible in his time. Cluverius, who visited Caronia, speaks with admiration of the beauty and pleasantness of this part of the coast, littoris excellens amoenitas et pulchritudo, which rendered it fully worthy of its ancient name.|$|E
25|$|In 216 BC, Marcus Aemilius Lepidus, late consul and augur, was honoured by {{his sons}} with {{three days of}} gladiatora munera in the Forum Romanum, using twenty-two pairs of gladiators. Ten years later, Scipio Africanus gave a {{commemorative}} munus in Iberia for his father and uncle, casualties in the Punic Wars. High status non-Romans, and possibly Romans too, volunteered as his gladiators. The context of the Punic Wars and Rome's near-disastrous defeat at the Battle of Cannae (216 BC) link these early games to munificence, the celebration of military victory and the religious expiation of military disaster; these munera appear to serve a morale-raising agenda {{in an era of}} military threat and expansion. The next recorded munus, held for the funeral of Publius Licinius in 183 BC, was more extravagant. It involved three days of funeral games, 120 gladiators, and public distribution of meat (visceratio data)– a practice that reflected the gladiatorial fights at Campanian banquets described by Livy and later deplored by Silius <b>Italicus.</b>|$|E
25|$|During {{his life}} at Rome, {{although}} he never {{rose to a}} position of real independence, and had always a hard and close struggle with poverty, he seems to have known everybody, especially every one of any eminence at the bar or in literature (friend to all). In addition to Lucan and Quintilian, he numbered among his manifold friends or more intimate acquaintances Silius <b>Italicus,</b> Juvenal, the younger Pliny; and there were many others of high position whose society and patronage he relished. The silence which he and Statius, although authors writing at the same time, having common friends and treating often of the same subjects, maintain in regard to one another may (nay must certainly) be explained by mutual dislike or want of sympathy or healthy rivalry or simple disgust. Martial in many places shows an undisguised contempt for the artificial kind of epic on which Statius's reputation chiefly rests; and it seems quite natural in the mind of an eminent litteraturist that the respectable author of the Thebaid and the Silvae should feel little admiration, nay perhaps even outright contempt, for either the life or the works of the populist and unsophisticated bohemian epigrammatist.|$|E

25|$|Sulmona {{was one of}} the {{principal}} cities of the Peligni, as an independent tribe, but no notice of it is found in history before the Roman conquest. A tradition alluded to by Ovid and Silius <b>Italicus,</b> which ascribed its foundation to Solymus, a Phrygian and one of the companions of Aeneas, is evidently a mere etymological fiction. The first mention of Sulmo occurs in the Second Punic War, when its territory was ravaged by Hannibal in 211 BC, who, however, did not attack the city itself. Its name is not noticed during the Social War, in which the Paeligni took so prominent a part; but according to Florus, it suffered severely in the subsequent civil war between Sulla and Gaius Marius, having been destroyed by the former as a punishment for allegiance to his rival. The writings of that rhetorical writer are not, however, to be taken literally, and it is more probable that Sulmo was confiscated and its lands assigned by Sulla to a body of his soldiers. In all events it is certain that Sulmo was a well-peopled and considerable town in 49 BC, when it was occupied by Domitius Calvinus with a garrison of seven cohorts; but the citizens, who were favorably inclined towards Julius Caesar, opened their gates to his lieutenant M. Antonius as soon as he presented himself.|$|E

2500|$|The chief {{claim to}} fame of Sulmona is derived from its having been the birthplace of Ovid, who {{repeatedly}} alludes to it as such, and celebrates its salubrity, and the numerous permanent streams of clear water in which its neighbourhood abounded. But, like the whole district of the Paeligni, it was extremely cold in winter, whence Ovid himself, and Silius <b>Italicus</b> in imitation of him, calls it [...] "gelidus Sulmo" [...] Its territory was fertile, cultivation of both in grain and wine are common, and one district, the Pagus Fabianus, is particularly mentioned by Pliny for the care bestowed on the irrigation of the vineyards.|$|E
2500|$|According to Thucydides, {{the city}} was founded in 1360 BC or 1031 BC and was {{inhabited}} by the Sicels in the 7th century BC. It was probably a dependency of Syracuse. Modica was occupied by the Romans after {{the battle of the}} Egadi islands against the Carthaginians in the Punic Wars 241 BC, together with Syracuse and all of Sicily. [...] Modica became one of the thirty-five decuman ("spontaneously submitted") cities of the island and was oppressed by the praetor Verres. It became an independent municipium, and apparently a place of some consequence. The city is also mentioned among the inland towns of the island both by Pliny and Ptolemy; and though its name is not found in the Itineraries, it is again mentioned by the Geographer of Ravenna. Silius <b>Italicus</b> also includes it in his list of Sicilian cities, and immediately associates it with Netum (now Noto Antico), with which it was clearly in the same neighborhood. The southeast of Sicily and Modica (according to the German historian L. Hertling) was rapidly Christianized, as the diocese of Syracuse boasts an apostolic foundation by St. Paul in 61AD. In 535, the Byzantine general Belisarius expelled the Ostrogoths and established for Justinian I the government of the East-Roman Empire (also known as the Byzantine Empire) and the already Greek-speaking population fixed their culture until the Latinization of the Normans in the 11th century.|$|E
2500|$|Roman {{writing as}} a whole {{demonstrates}} a deep ambivalence towards the gladiatoria munera. Even the most complex and sophisticated munera of the Imperial era evoked the ancient, ancestral dii manes of the underworld and were framed by the protective, lawful rites of sacrificium. Their popularity made their co-option by the state inevitable; Cicero acknowledged their sponsorship as a political imperative. Despite the popular adulation of gladiators, they were set apart, despised; and despite Cicero's contempt for the mob, he shared their admiration: [...] "Even when [...] have been felled, let alone when they are standing and fighting, they never disgrace themselves. And suppose a gladiator has {{been brought to the}} ground, when do you ever see one twist his neck away after he has been ordered to extend it for the death blow?" [...] His own death would later emulate this example. Yet, Cicero could also refer to his popularist opponent Clodius, publicly and scathingly, as a bustuarius– literally, a [...] "funeral-man", implying that Clodius has shown the moral temperament of the lowest sort of gladiator. Such finer distinctions aside, [...] "gladiator" [...] could be (and was) used as an insult throughout the Roman period, and [...] "Samnite" [...] doubled the insult, despite the popularity of the Samnite type. Silius <b>Italicus</b> wrote, as the games approached their peak, that the degenerate Campanians had devised the very worst of precedents, which now threatened the moral fabric of Rome: [...] "It was their custom to enliven their banquets with bloodshed and to combine with their feasting the horrid sight of armed men [...] fighting; often the combatants fell dead above the very cups of the revelers, and the tables were stained with streams of blood. Thus demoralised was Capua." [...] Death could be rightly meted out as punishment, or met with equanimity in peace or war, as a gift of fate; but when inflicted as entertainment, with no underlying moral or religious purpose, it could only pollute and demean those who witnessed it.|$|E
