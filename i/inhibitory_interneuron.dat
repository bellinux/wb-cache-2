25|$|A {{key factor}} in the neural {{plasticity}} underlying neuropathic pain is altered gene expression in sensory dorsal root ganglia neurons. Injury to sensory nerves induces neurochemical, physiological and anatomical modifications to afferent and central neurons, such as afferent terminal sprouting and <b>inhibitory</b> <b>interneuron</b> loss. Following nerve damage, NaCl channel accumulation causes hyperexcitability, and downregulation of the TTX-resistant Nav1.8 (sensory neuron specific, SNS1) channel and upregulation of TTX-sensitive Nav1.3 (brain type III) and TRPV1 channels. These changes contribute to increased NMDA glutamate receptor-dependent excitability of spinal dorsal horn neurons and are restricted to the ipsilateral (injured) side. A combination of these factors could contribute to the neuropathic pain state of postherpetic neuralgia.|$|E

Thus, depending on the relative rates of firing of C and Aβ fibers, the firing of the nonnociceptive fiber may inhibit the firing of the projection neuron and the transmission of pain stimuli.|$|E

40|$|<b>Inhibitory</b> <b>interneurons</b> of {{the spinal}} dorsal horn play {{critical}} {{roles in the}} processing of noxious and innocuous sensory information. They form a family of morphologically and functionally diverse neurons that likely fall into distinct subtypes. Traditional classifications rely mainly on differences in dendritic tree morphology and firing patterns. Although useful, these markers are not comprehensive and cannot be used to drive specific genetic manipulations targeted at defined subsets of neurons. Here, we have used genome-wide expression profiling of spinal dorsal horns of wild-type mice and of two strains of transcription factor-deficient mice (Ptf 1 a(-/-) and Ascl 1 /Mash 1 (-/-) mice) to identify new genetic markers for specific subsets of dorsal horn <b>inhibitory</b> <b>interneurons.</b> Ptf 1 a(-/-) mice lack all <b>inhibitory</b> <b>interneurons</b> in the dorsal horn, whereas only the late-born <b>inhibitory</b> <b>interneurons</b> are missing in Ascl 1 (-/-) mice.

In situ hybridization analyses of all 30 genes identified four genes with primarily non-overlapping expression patterns in the dorsal horn. Three genes, pDyn coding the neuropeptide dynorphin, Kcnip 2 encoding a potassium channel associated protein, and the nuclear receptor encoding gene Rorb, were expressed in Ascl 1 -dependent subpopulations of the superficial dorsal horn.

We studied the mechanisms of this selective neuronal activation using a mouse somatosensory thalamocortical preparation.

Axons from the thalamus made stronger and more frequent excitatory connections onto <b>inhibitory</b> <b>interneurons</b> than onto excitatory cells. Furthermore, circuit dynamics allowed feedforward inhibition to suppress responses in excitatory cells more effectively than in interneurons. Thalamocortical excitatory currents rose quickly in interneurons, allowing them to fire action potentials before significant feedforward inhibition emerged. In contrast, thalamocortical excitatory currents rose slowly in excitatory cells, overlapping with feedforward inhibitory currents that suppress action potentials.

40|$|Information {{processing}} within {{neuronal networks}} {{is determined by}} a dynamic partnership between principal neurons and local circuit <b>inhibitory</b> <b>interneurons.</b> The population of GABAergic interneurons is extremely heterogeneous and comprises, in many brain regions, cells with divergent morphological and physiological properties, distinct molecular expression profiles, and highly specialized functions. GABAergic interneurons have been studied extensively {{during the past two}} decades, especially in the hippocampus, which is a relatively simple cortical structure. Different types of hippocampal <b>inhibitory</b> <b>interneurons</b> control spike initiation (e. g., axo-axonic and basket cells) and synaptic integration (e. g., bistratified and oriens–lacunosum moleculare interneurons) within pyramidal neurons and synchronize local network activity, providing a means for functional segregation of neuronal ensembles and proper routing of hippocampal information. Thus, it is thought that, at least in the hippocampus, GABAergic <b>inhibitory</b> <b>interneurons</b> represent critical regulating elements at all stages of information processing, from synaptic integration and spike generation to large-scale network activity. However, this raises an important question: if <b>inhibitory</b> <b>interneurons</b> are fundamental for network computations, what are the mechanisms that control the activity of the interneurons themselves? Given the essential role of synaptic inhibition in the regulation of neuronal activity, it would be logical to expect that specific inhibitory mechanisms have evolved to control the operation of interneurons. Here, we review the mechanisms of synaptic inhibition of interneurons and discuss their role in the operation of hippocampal inhibitory circuits...|$|R
50|$|The afferent of {{the muscle}} spindle bifurcates in the spinal cord. One branch innervates the alpha motor neuron that causes the homonymous muscle to contract, {{producing}} the reflex. The other branch innervates the <b>inhibitory</b> <b>interneuron,</b> which in turn innervates the alpha motor neuron that synapses onto the opposing muscle. Because the interneuron is inhibitory, it prevents the opposing alpha motor neuron from firing, thereby reducing the contraction of the opposing muscle. Without this reciprocal inhibition, both groups of muscles might contract simultaneously and work against each other.|$|E

They receive excitatory input from mossy fibres, also synapsing on granule cells, and parallel fibers, which are long granule cell axons. Thereby this circuitry allows for feed-forward and feed-back inhibition of granule cells.|$|E
50|$|Reciprocal {{inhibition}} {{describes the}} process of muscles {{on one side of}} a joint relaxing to accommodate contraction {{on the other side of}} that joint. Joints are controlled by two opposing sets of muscles, extensors and flexors, which must work in synchrony for smooth movement. When a muscle spindle is stretched and the stretch reflex is activated, the opposing muscle group must be inhibited to prevent it from working against the resulting contraction of the homonymous muscle. This inhibition is accomplished by the actions of an <b>inhibitory</b> <b>interneuron</b> in the spinal cord.|$|E
40|$|In {{a variety}} of {{neuronal}} systems it has been hypothesized that <b>inhibitory</b> <b>interneurons</b> corral principal neurons into synchronously firing groups that encode sensory information and sub-serve behavior (Buzs&# 225;ki and Chrobak, 1995;Buzs&# 225;ki, 2008). This mechanism is particularly relevant to the olfactory system where spatiotemporal patterns of projection neuron activity act as robust markers of odor attributes (Laurent et al., 1996;Wehr and Laurent, 1996). In the insect antennal lobe, a network of local <b>inhibitory</b> <b>interneurons</b> arborizes extensively throughout the antennal lobe (Leitch and Laurent, 1996) providing inhibitory input to the cholinergic projection neurons. Our theoretical work has attempted to elaborate the exact role of inhibition in the generation of odor specific projection neuron responses(Bazhenov et al., 2001 a;Bazhenov et al., 2001 b;Assisi et al., 2011). In large-scale antennal lobe (AL) network models we characterized the inhibitory sub–network by its coloring (Assisi et al., 2011) and showed that it can entrain excitatory projection neurons to the odor specific patterns of transient synchronization. In this focused review, we further examine the dynamics of entrainment in more detail by simulating simple model networks in various parameter regimes. Our simulations in conjunction with earlier studies point to the key role played by lateral (between <b>inhibitory</b> <b>interneurons)</b> and feedback (from <b>inhibitory</b> <b>interneurons</b> to principal cells) inhibition in the generation of experimentally observed patterns of transient synchrony...|$|R

Quantitative studies in rat have shown that <b>inhibitory</b> <b>interneurons</b> account for 25 - 40 % of all neurons in this region. The sst 2 A receptor is expressed by around half the <b>inhibitory</b> <b>interneurons</b> in laminae I-II, and is associated with particular neurochemically-defined populations. Although much of the work on spinal pain mechanisms has been performed on rat, the mouse is now increasingly used as a model, due to the availability of genetically altered lines. However, quantitative information on the arrangement of interneurons is lacking in the mouse, and it is possible that there are significant species differences in neuronal organisation. In this study, we show that as in the rat, nearly all neurons in laminae I-III that are enriched with glycine also contain GABA, which suggests that GABA-immunoreactivity can be used to identify <b>inhibitory</b> <b>interneurons</b> in this region. These cells account for 26 % of the neurons in laminae I-II and 38 % of those in lamina III. As in the rat, the sst 2 A receptor is only expressed by <b>inhibitory</b> <b>interneurons</b> in laminae I-II, and is present on just over half (54 %) of these cells. Antibody against the neurokinin 1 receptor was used to define lamina I, and we found that although the receptor was concentrated in this lamina, it was expressed by many fewer cells than in the rat. By estimating the total numbers of neurons in each of these laminae in the L 4 segment of the mouse, we show that there are around half as many neurons in each lamina as are present in the corresponding segment of the rat...|$|R

5000|$|Joints are {{controlled}} by two opposing sets of muscles called extensors and flexors that must work in synchrony to allow proper and desired movement. [...] When a muscle spindle is stretched and the stretch reflex is activated, the opposing muscle group must be inhibited to prevent from working against the agonist muscle. The spinal interneuron called Ia <b>inhibitory</b> <b>interneuron</b> is responsible for this inhibition of the antagonist muscle. The Ia afferent of the muscle spindle enters the spinal cord, and one branch synapses on to the alpha motor neuron that causes the agonist muscle to contract. Thus, it results in creating the behavioral reflex. At the same time, the other branch of the Ia afferent synapses on to the Ia <b>inhibitory</b> <b>interneuron,</b> which in turn synapses the alpha motor neuron of the antagonist muscle. Since Ia interneuron is inhibitory, it prevents the opposing alpha motor neuron from firing. Thus, it prevents the antagonist muscle from contracting. Without having this system of reciprocal inhibition, both groups of muscles may contract {{at the same time}} and work against each other. This results in spending a greater amount of energy as well. In addition, the reciprocal inhibition is important for mechanism underlying voluntary movement. When the antagonist muscle relaxes during movement, this increases efficiency and speed. This prevents moving muscles from working against the contraction force of antagonist muscles. Thus, during voluntary movement, the Ia inhibitory interneurons are used to coordinate muscle contraction. Further, the Ia inhibitory interneurons allow the higher centers to coordinate commands sent to the two muscles working opposite of each other at a single joint via a single command. The interneuron receives the input command from the corticospinal descending axons in such a way that the descending signal, which activates the contraction of one muscle, causes relaxation of the other muscles.|$|E

Cleavage of synaptobrevin affects {{the stability of the}} SNARE core by restricting it from entering the low energy conformation which is the target for NSF binding. Synaptobrevin is an integral V-SNARE necessary for vesicle fusion to membranes. The cleavage of synaptobrevin is the final target of TeNT and even in low doses the neurotoxin will inhibit neurotransmitter exocytosis in the inhibitory interneurons. The blockage of these neurotransmitters is what causes the physiological effects that accompany TeNT, specifically the blockage of the neurotransmitters GABA and glycine.|$|E
