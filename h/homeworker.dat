40|$|Analyzing two {{research}} projects on the industrial home-based work (HBW) in 2003 and 2006 in Istanbul, Turkey, this paper argues that {{two forms of}} rigidities shape the organizational characteristics of the HBW: limited physical mobility of the <b>homeworkers</b> and the in-built pressures within the labor process of the factory system. On one hand, the rigidities regarding the mobility of <b>homeworkers</b> determine {{the conditions of the}} labor process of the HBW. Among some dimensions of the labor process of HBW, mechanisms for the distribution of piecework, the training of <b>homeworkers,</b> or storage of the piecework are directly related with the physical mobility of <b>homeworkers.</b> On the other hand, the co-existence of labor- and capital-intensive processes in the factory system unavoidably creates management bottlenecks, which account for another form of rigidity. HBW appears as the solution for such management problems. These corresponding rigidities characterize the organizational variety of the HBW. Negative work conditions of the <b>homeworkers</b> such as low piece-wages and precariousness in the employment practices are accounted for by these rigidities. As much as the low piece-wages generally associated with the HBW in the literature. Thus, investigation of the HBW should go beyond the argument about the low piece-wages and start to analyze the actual conditions of organization resulting in the deteriorating conditions of work for <b>homeworkers.</b> The literature emphasizes the centrality of the low piece-wages turning this form of labor into an alternative for the factory system. Although the {{research projects}} analyzed in this paper verify this consensus, two forms of rigidities motivate both workers and employers to 'get into the HBW-nexus': <b>Homeworkers</b> shape the organizational arrangements significantly, given that HBW does not pertain to a formal form of employment. Thus, their conditions of physical mobility account for a key element in the organization of HBW. Since the state of mobility by <b>homeworkers</b> is rather one of rigidity than an advantage, their regarding condition should be the focus to understand the mindsets of the <b>homeworkers.</b> mobility of <b>homeworkers,</b> labor market rigidity...|$|R

In 2007, the National Statistical Office (NSO) reported that out of the 249, 290 households, there were 440, 251 people earning their livelihoods through homeworking. Of this number, 337, 526 or slightly more than three quarters of them were women and 102, 725 were men. This study builds on previous research conducted in 2006 on the status of women <b>homeworkers</b> in Thailand and their use of Information and Communications Technology (ICT) to promote economic empowerment and generate new income opportunities. Since 2006, Thailand has undergone numerous social, economic, and political changes.

5000|$|A garden {{office is}} {{an office in}} a garden. This is usually {{separate}} to a house, {{being used as a}} dedicated office space by a professional <b>homeworker</b> or by a home-based business. In the UK, planning permission is not normally needed for a garden office if you are only using it as a home study and if it is similar in size and construction to a garden shed. A garden office used as a home study does not need planning permission {{as long as it is}} not more than 4 metres tall for a pitched roof, at least 2 metres from the property line and does not cover more than half of the garden area. If you are running a business from your garden office it will need planning permission regardless of its size or position within the garden. This is because working at home, in the garden, can cause a problem for neighbours. The cost will depend upon the facilities and will be between £5,000 and £60,000. Internet and telephone connections may be required and this can perhaps be achieved by use of a wireless network based in the main building.|$|E

As in buyer-driven chains of production, retailers in the clothing value chain wield a substantial amount of power in determining prices.

40|$|The {{papers in}} this {{dissertation}} explore women’s labour market {{decisions in the}} context of an industrializing economy by focusing on female industrial <b>homeworkers</b> in Sweden during the second industrial revolution. Three different datasets were compiled for these studies: one cross-sectional, individual-level dataset based on survey data from interviews conducted with a large number of individual industrial <b>homeworkers</b> in 1911; one longitu- dinal, individuallevel panel dataset based on poll tax records; and one dataset comprising qualitative data based on contemporary texts. Both quantitative and qualitative methods were used to analyse the data. The dissertation consists of an introduction, four research papers and a description of the compilation of the first two datasets. Paper 1 investigates how the birth of a first child affected the timing of the transition into industrial homework for the individuals. The main result was that having a first child significantly increased an individual’s propensity to start industrial homework, both in the urban and rural contexts. Paper 2 identifies life-course patterns of paid work for industrial <b>homeworkers</b> and explores how marital status affected the trajectories in and out of industrial homework. The results showed that for most women, industrial homework was part of a continuous occupational trajectory and few experienced any occupational mobility during the tran- sition to or from industrial homework. The focus of paper 3 is seasonal variations in hours worked and how seasonal variation can be explained. The main finding was instead a general lack of seasonal variation in hours worked, in both the urban and rural samples. Most women worked surprisingly consistent hours year-round, despite often being described as highly flexible and seasonal workers. There was however some seasonal variation found in hours worked and this was mainly related to differences in products made. Paper 4 explores the theory of “housewifization” and whether industrial <b>homeworkers</b> were marginalized and unprotected in the labour market because they were considered to be housewives working for pin money. Industrial <b>homeworkers</b> were not found to be described as housewives or working for pin money in the public debate in early 20 th century Sweden. Nor were they housewives – most of them contributed significantly to the household income and the majority of industrial <b>homeworkers</b> were heads of their own households. This dissertation provides new individual-level evidence of the labour market decisions made by an important but little studied segment of the labour market: industrial <b>homeworkers.</b> By combining quantitative and qualitative methods with data from unconventional sources, it tells us about the conditions of <b>homeworkers</b> as individuals, as parts of families and households, and as a group in the labour market...|$|R

For <b>homeworkers,</b> perceptions of physical labor are influenced primarily by the number of hours invested in housework. The mental demands of waged and nonwaged labor are also perceived differently. Women in the waged economy report significantly higher mental demands than do <b>homeworkers.</b> This too varies across labor segments.

40|$|Changes in {{the nature}} of work e. g. Location Independent Working and the growth of homeworking, mean that {{managers}} and their staff may not work in close proximity and so rarely meet in person. The consequent loss of visibility and physical presence creates specific challenges and constraints in relation to the managers' role in the employment relationship. As previous research has compartmentalised the perspectives of <b>homeworkers</b> and their managers, analysis has always been restrictive, lacking in an all-encompassing view of the employment relationship. Seeking to address this disparity, this research assesses the views of both sides of the employment relationship, thereby exploring the experiences of managers and <b>homeworkers.</b> Using contrasting organisations, this research explores how the practice of management control differs in a homeworking environment. The case study organisations suggest that job role, skill level and organisational size can influence a line manager’s ability to exercise control. Direct control is possible for organisations employing low skilled workers undertaking repetitive tasks. Close electronic monitoring of performance stimulates a cyclical process of resistance and increased management surveillance. For an organisation employing highly skilled autonomous workers, direct control is problematic. Managers become increasingly reliant on external proxies of performance. The objectivity of these external measures is questionable, which consequently reduces the manager’s ability to control performance. As a limited amount of research has investigated the practicalities of managing <b>homeworkers,</b> this research is unique as it has explored the influence of homeworking on a manager’s ability to exercise control. Consequently, these findings will offer new insights into the practice of management control in a homeworking environment. As these findings have uncovered some of the specific challenges of homeworking from a managers and <b>homeworkers</b> perspective, the practicalities of managing <b>homeworkers</b> and the potential advantages and drawbacks of working at home may now be more readily understood.

40|$|Global competition, {{societal}} {{changes and}} other environmental influences have forced organisations to review existing work arrangements. Flexible work practices {{have been identified as}} one mechanism for the alignment of organisational and individual goals. Homebased work or telecommuting, which involves working at a remote site, is an example of such a practice. Working from home can have advantages for the organisation in terms of savings in infrastructure costs. Individual employees would also potentially benefit through reduced costs associated with work (e. g. travel and food), and the ability to better manage their work and home life. However, since 25 years ago when home based work was starting to be recognised as a viable work option, projections for homebased work have not come to fruition. Much of this is attributed to conservative organisational cultures, specifically managerial resistance towards work at home. The relatively small amount of research on homebased work has to some extent perpetuated management uncertainty in Australia and overseas. This study aimed to examine the attributes needed by homebased workers, that is, the personal and job characteristics that could make the arrangement successful in both individual and organisational terms. This knowledge would lessen management uncertainty in relation to the types of jobs and employees who could be deemed suitable to engage in this new work practice. The study was exploratory in nature. Information was collected from human resource managers at 472 organisations in Australia. This was followed by semi-structured interviews with 21 homeworkers. Based on the literature, and information collected through the first two phases of the study, a questionnaire was designed to collect more specific information from homeworkers, and clarify points of interest. All up 42 responses were received from this phase of the study. This study was cross-sectional in nature, however, the three-phased approach allowed for cross validation of results, and was therefore very valuable in detecting trends. Findings from this research indicated that personal characteristics, such as demography, competencies, and the psychological profile of the <b>homeworker,</b> do contribute to the benefits gained from the program. Job characteristics, in terms of occupation and the design of the job to be performed at home, also contribute to success. Although, the main focus of this study was on personal and job characteristics deemed suitable for homebased work, it was also found that the home and work environment of the <b>homeworker</b> are major success factors. It can therefore be surmised that benefits from a homebased work program can be enhanced by selecting for appropriate employees and jobs, and devising policies that account for the home and work environment of the <b>homeworker...</b>|$|E
