5000|$|In {{his later}} years, Mérimée {{had very little}} good to say about other French and European writers, with a few exceptions, such as his friends Stendhal Turgenev. Most of his {{criticism}} was contained in his correspondence with his friends. He described the later works of Victor Hugo as [...] "words without ideas". Describing Les Miserables, Mérimée wrote: [...] "What a shame that this man who has such beautiful images at his disposal lacks even a shadow of good sense or modesty, and is unable to refrain from saying these platitudes not worthy of an honest man." [...] He wrote his friend Madame Montijo that the book was [...] "perfectly mediocre; not a moment that is natural." [...] Speaking of Flaubert and Madame Bovary, {{he was a little}} kinder. He wrote: [...] "There is a talent there which he wastes under the pretext of realism." [...] Describing the Fleurs de Mal by Baudelaire, he wrote: [...] "Simply mediocre, nothing dangerous.

He also alluded to an opposition to [...] "left-wing bitterness" [...] and the spectre of [...] "political correctness", but the model of free speech he cited was the anarchic 1970s, and not the Thatcher era, or a more distant past.

5000|$|On July 6, 2011, 3 Doors Down had an {{interview}} with K-Mart Music. The band discussed several different topics ranging from their influences to {{where they will be}} touring along with the dates. Most importantly, they discussed their new album Time of my Life, and what made the album different from the past albums they have recorded. When asked the question, [...] "What has influenced the work of 3 Doors Down the most?", frontman Brad Arnold replied, “I think the things that have influenced the work of 3 Doors Down the most is just our life experiences, and things that we’ve all gone through, and I think that all things that people really go through on a daily basis and that’s the songs that we always sit out and write are songs that people can really identify with. <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> identify with these songs, and I hope that everybody takes away something from these songs". The following question was, [...] "What makes your latest album different from your previous work?". Brad responded, “I think what makes Time of My Life different from our previous works is just the fact that we went into the studio with a goal, and that goal was to make a bigger, better record that we have ever made before. I think our experience helped a lot with reaching our goal, and this album exemplifies the whole statement of having the time of our lives".|$|E

He came backstage at the House of Blues in West Hollywood and thanked the band members."I thanked him for not suing us," [...] Cordero says. [...] "Then he sang 'I Am ... I Said' with us. Now his steel drummer often plays with us when he's not on the road." [...] "In 2000, Diamond finally {{came to see the}} band at the House of Blues, which is a couple of miles from Diamond's home in Beverly Hills. He came again in 2001 when Super Diamond was performing at the premiere party for the romantic comedy [...] "Saving Silverman," [...] in which Neil Diamond has a cameo role as himself. Both times Diamond took the stage and sang with his bizarro band. Performing with the real Neil was a blast, Cordero says. [...] "I couldn't believe how nice and normal he seemed for someone who is a living legend"(The Morning Call 2004). [...] "The real Neil sat in with Super Diamond at the House of Blues, singing [...] "I Am, I Said." [...] Or should that have been [...] "We Are, We Said?"

5000|$|On April 7, 2014 Watts {{released}} his sixth studio album which reportedly marks {{a bit of}} a departure from the more straightforward songwriting of previous releases. The album is said to lean more heavily on influences including Philip Glass and Thomas Newman while still incorporating his singer-songwriter and rock roots. As Watts states, [...] "This approach to music has been growing in me for awhile. You can hear elements of it popping up on previous albums and especially on a few tracks from [...] "Life on Earth". I was profoundly effected by something Philip Glass said in his documentary ("GLASS"). I'm paraphrasing here, but he spoke about how poetry is about speaking, dance about movement and music about listening... and that he does't think about music, he listens to it and writes it down. This sparked something in me. It instantly felt true... that there was this current of music in me that I'm not always listening to in as pure a way as I could. So I sat down at the piano and began to just listen to what was there. Trying to avoid playing an instrument, I didn't want any habits to guide me, I just listened until there was music coming from inside of me and beyond technique. And rather than judge it or its validity, I trusted it and let myself go. I would compose the music this way as well as approach the lyrics similarly. What surprised me was the results were very new, yet felt truthful, or natural in a way I couldn't put my finger on... I guess it was just that it felt honest and {{it was sort of a}} given that I liked what I heard. I was preventing myself from getting into a headspace where I had a self-image associated with the music... it was more about expression. My approach to recording the album was an extension of this as well. I would write and record all in the same time frame. This isn't new for me, but my mindset was different, I was going for a moment and not letting the producer side of me take over too much. Rather than seek perfection in a technical sense, the new perfection became the truth of the moment more so. It's really transformed the way I approach my solo work. I noticed that this approach was closer to how I approached my visual arts as well... so there's this sense of it all coming together and coming from the same place... it just so happens that sometimes I'm creating for the ears and sometimes for the eyes, but it's all unified. This recent music and art feels as close to my core as anything I've done in the past... when I listen or look, there's this mirror like effect... like it's reflecting what it's like to be inside my skin. It's funny because with this kind of process, I don't find myself thinking much about whether people like it or not... <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>they</b> <b>do,</b> but I realize people will either get it or they won't and it has nothing to do with me. It's liberating." ...|$|E

40|$|O. This {{paper is}} sort of an {{extended}} footnote, with a faint Borgesian flavorl. What I'm {{going to do is}} show how one rather prominent argument in the linguistics literature against one aspect of the research program of behaviorism fails to go through. But I'll also observe that this argument appears to have had no practical effect on linguistic investigations, and that many people seem to assume (tacitly, at least) that this argument fails anyway. So my remarks here don't move the field forward any, but what <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> do is help to get us all a bit clearer about where we are. The argument I'll be examining, given by Noam Chomsky in Reflections on Language (Chomsky 1975), is against a point of view called "general process learning theory ", a view that regards one goal of psychological theorizing to be the discovery of laws of learning that hold across species and across domain...|$|E

In very recent discussions, however, the issues of War, Peace, Destruction, Post War Recovery and their correlation to architecture and urbanism are starting to gain momentum toward shaping a new body of theories or cases on destruction and their underlying applications in terms of recovery efforts.

The people in St. Louis are very hospitable and go to great lengths to keep the boys happy. I believe it rates second to New England. I was out there and in the south for ten months so you can be sure it felt pretty swell to back home in New England. I don’t know how long I’ll be here but I intend to enjoy myself while I’m here.
