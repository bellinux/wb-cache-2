In Briony Fer's essay for the catalogue that accompanied Horn's 2009 traveling retrospective Roni Horn aka Roni Horn, she writes about the experience one has with the surfaces of these glass works, [...] "There is an almost unbearable precision in the effect of the light on the smooth surface of glass or an accidental but infinitesimal flaw in the surface that creates an effect of massive turbulence in certain lights and absolutely none in others. Depending on the angle of view, glass has a surface of either razor sharpness or infinite depth. At one moment its surfaces can seem as thin and dazzling as the gold leaf laid out on the floor of Paired Gold Mats, for Ross and Felix, at another it is purely transparent. You cannot see the change happenings in perception; it is only visible in its sudden effect when one kind of surface has switched invisibly into another. You can see into it and then suddenly the light changes, and it has no inside at all--only a surface and a shine that reflects outward. The line between the two is so fine that in perception it no longer exists. But it is our experience that fractures in an instant." ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{process of}} molding {{was just the}} initial step in the {{manufacture}} of three-mold glass. After removal from the mold, the glass was expanded by means of additional blowing. [...] The object was then cracked off at the rim and hand finished by grinding and polishing. [...] Pitcher rims, decanter necks and bases all required hand work. In New England, pieces were often finished with threaded lips. Handles were also added after removal from the mold. [...] Lamps, candlesticks and vases were pressed in separate parts and fused together while still hot. [...] Finished pieces were <b>fire</b> <b>polished</b> by reheating in the furnace, which softened the pattern and gave the piece a diffuse brilliance.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} {{a number of}} gas flames for <b>fire</b> <b>polishing</b> borosilicate glass capillaries used in the manufacturing of IVF micro-pipettes. Hydrofluoric acid (HF) was also used {{as an alternative to}} finish the pipette end. Glass micro tools in the IVF industry are drawn from hollow glass capillaries of diameter 1 mm. These capillaries are cut manually to a length of 100 mm from hollow glass rods resulting in sharp and chipped edges. These capillaries are held in a customised holder having padding of soft silicone or rubber. Sharp and uneven edges of these capillaries pick up particles of rubber or soft silicone shavings, rendering them ineffective for IVF treatments. The working range of borosilicate glass is 800 - 1, 200 degrees C. The experiments involved analysis of <b>fire</b> <b>polishing</b> process for borosilicate glass capillaries using candle, butane, propane, 2350 butane propane, oxyacetylene gas flames, finding the optimum distance of the capillary relative to the flame, optimum time for which the capillary should be held in the flame and optimum region of the flame which gives the required temperature range. The results show that 2350 butane propane gas mix is optimum for <b>fire</b> <b>polishing</b> of borosilicate glass capillaries. The paper is concluded by comparing the results of <b>fire</b> <b>polishing</b> with the results of acid polishing, in which HF of 1. 6 % concentration is used to etch the ends of the borosilicate glass pipettes...|$|R

50|$|Right-Angle weave stitch, {{also known}} as RAW, is an off-loom bead weaving technique. Beads are {{stitched}} together with thread only making right angle turns, hence the name. The result is an almost fabric like piece of beadwork. Right-Angle weave can be woven with either one needle or two. With single needle right-angle weave, the thread path moves in a figure-eight pattern. For double needle right-angle weave, the threads cross each other along the center bead of each stitch as they head in opposite directions. RAW can be formed into flat pieces, tubes, or 3 dimensional figures. There are also variations on the basic stich like cubic right angle weave, or CRAW. Seed beads, <b>fire</b> <b>polished</b> beads and crystal beads are common choices in pieces using right-angle weave.|$|E
5000|$|Custom {{architectural}} crafted glass, tempered glass, textured glass pieces, and {{the ancient}} art of verre églomisé, or reverse gilded glass, are applied to contemporary uses including countertops, backsplashes, and tabletops. Glass work may be customized to suit by craftsmen in the studio, then installed on site either in small components (such as a kitchen countertop composed of three rectangles of verre églomisé) or as immense, single units (for example, a glass countertop and sink basin formed of one continuous piece of textured glass). Surface texture comes in several variations, such as sanded, melted, pixels, and linear. Glass countertops also often have customized edges, including: bushed polished, textured, and <b>fire</b> <b>polished</b> edges. The glass is non-porous, relatively stain-proof, extremely hygienic, and [...] "extremely heat resistant (up to 700 degrees)."Much work {{is being done to}} [...] "recycle" [...] glass using sources such as post consumer glass or post industrial float glass. The material can be crushed or cut into strips that is heated until the softening point of glass, binding the loose material back into a solid form.|$|E

30|$|Injection needles (needle types: O.D. = 20  μm; BM 100 T- 10, ends <b>fire</b> <b>polished,</b> beveled, Biomedical Instruments, Germany or Femtotip II, Eppendorf, Germany) were backfilled with 10  μL {{substance}} by a Microloader (Eppendorf, Germany). The needle {{was placed}} in the microinjection manipulator (Narishige MN- 151, Narishige International Limited, London, United Kingdom) connected to a pneumatic microinjection pump (FemtoJet from Eppendorf, Germany). Injections were made with[*]×[*] 20 magnification under an inverted microscope (Nikon MSZ 800, Nikon GmbH, Düsseldorf, Federal State of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany). Injection volume was determined according to Sive et al. [37] by an object micrometer (Bresser 1 / 10  mm, Bresser GmbH, Rhede, Federal State of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany). Briefly, for the three vehicles, DMSO, methanol, and water, a mineral droplet was mounted on the scale of the object micrometer. For triolein, a drop of water was used as matrix for measurements. The arising vehicle sphere was measured with the scale of the object micrometer. Each vehicle was administered several times into the oil droplet until the target injection volume was achieved. According to the sphere volume formula (V[*]=[*] 1 / 6 πd 3), a sphere diameter of 1  bar corresponded to an injection volume of 0.5  nL. Two bars corresponded to 4.2  nL. Injection volume needed to be measured and adjusted for every solution, concentration as well as for every control prior and past injections due to the putative variations at the needle tip during injection procedure.|$|E
40|$|In this video, we {{demonstrate}} {{the preparation of}} E 18 cortical rat neurons. E 18 cortical rat neurons are obtained from E 18 fetal rat cortex previously dissected and prepared. The E 18 cortex is, upon dissection, immediately dissociated into individual neurons. It is possible to store E 18 cortex in Hibernate E buffer containing B 27 at 4 °C {{for up to a}} week before the dissociation is performed. However, there will be a drop in cell viability. Typically we obtain our E 18 Cortex fresh. It is transported to the lab in ice cold Calcium free Magnesium free dissection buffer (CMFM). Upon arrival, trypsin is added to the cortex to a final concentration of 0. 125 %. The cortex is then incubated at 37 °C for 8 minutes. DMEM containing 10 % FBS is added to the cortex to stop the reaction. The cortex is then centrifuged at 2500 rpm for 2 minutes. The supernatant is removed and 2 ml of Neural Basal Media (NBM) containing 2 % B 27 (vol/vol) and 0. 25 % Glutamax (vol/vol) is added to the cortex which is then re-suspended by pipetting up and down. Next, the cortex is triturated with previously <b>fire</b> <b>polished</b> glass pipettes, each with a successive smaller opening.

40|$|Double-clad silica fibres used in {{high power}} lasers {{typically}} comprise a core doped with a laser active ion, a silica inner-cladding pump guide {{and a low}} refractive index outer polymer coating for protection and low loss pump guidance. For efficient pump absorption in the active-ion doped core, the inner-cladding must be shaped in order to scramble the pump radiation to achieve a high spatial overlap with the core. This shaping is traditionally undertaken via diamond milling of the fibre preform into an octagon or hexagon, leaving a rough surface that is subsequently <b>fire</b> <b>polished.</b> We report on a new approach for shaping the inner-cladding using a CO 2 laser to machine the fibre preform. This process is shown to allow fabrication of novel cladding structures, which include concave and convex surfaces, {{as well as a}} significant increase in the processing speeds and avoids the need for fire polishing prior to fibre drawing. The laser processing set-up (shown in Fig. 1) employs a 100 W 10. 6 µm pulsed CO 2 laser (Coherent G- 100). The beam is passed through a periscope system before being directed vertically down through a focusing lens (f= 100 mm) onto the fibre preform surface. The preform itself is mounted within a rotation stage on an X-Y translation stage. The X stage translates the preform through the laser beam along its length at speeds of up to 300 mm/s, with a slower Y stage utilised for repositioning for raster scanning along the surface. The laser is modulated at up to 3 kHz repetition rates with varying pulse lengths fro...|$|E
40|$|The {{surface of}} glass and glass {{coatings}} have been studied using x-ray and neutron scattering techniques. In particular, the effect of aqueous solutions and humid atmospheres on both the <b>fire</b> <b>polished</b> and the tin rich side of float glass have been investigated using neutron and x-ray reflection. Isotopic substitution has enabled the number density of water molecules within the float glass surface to be monitored with respect to immersion time, temperature and impurity content. A thin gel-like water-rich layer of thickness #approx# 30 A is observed at the surface accompanied by a more deeply penetrating layer which increases in depth with time reaching #approx# 500 A after 6 months. The rate of water ingression is higher than predicted from previous work carried out at elevated temperatures. Small decreases in the depth of penetration have been observed for glass containing alumina and tin. Water penetration into thin films made by a sol-gel process have also been studied. The hydrophobicity of these films had been varied {{by the addition of}} fluoroalkylsilane. Neutron and X-ray reflection revealed that water entered the highly hydrophobic films readily from the vapour phase. This suggests a method of film destabilisation by which water enters the film and freezes, causing the film to crack. Changes in fluoroalkylsilane content and annealing have little effect on the penetration of water into the coatings. Etched float glass surfaces have been used as a system for testing the applicability of current off-specular scattering models. A rich surface structure has been found which results in reflection effects that cannot be explained by these models. Model systems have also been developed in an attempt to combine x-ray fluorescence techniques with reflectivity.
