5|$|Many {{caves in}} the Mendip area were {{excavated}} for archaeological and natural history studies by pioneer explorer Herbert E. Balch and were expertly photographed by caver Harry Savory {{early in the}} 20th century using huge cameras, glass plates and <b>flash</b> <b>powder.</b>|$|E
25|$|Riis and his photographers {{were among}} the first Americans to use flash photography. Pistol lamps were {{dangerous}} and looked threatening, and would soon be replaced by another method for which Riis lit magnesium powder on a frying pan. The process involved removing the lens cap, igniting the <b>flash</b> <b>powder</b> and replacing the lens cap; the time taken to ignite the <b>flash</b> <b>powder</b> sometimes allowed a visible image blurring created by the flash.|$|E
25|$|In 1887, <b>flash</b> <b>powder</b> was invented, {{enabling}} journalists such as Jacob Riis {{to photograph}} informal subjects indoors, {{which led to}} the landmark work How the Other Half Lives. By 1897, it became possible to reproduce halftone photographs on printing presses running at full speed.|$|E

50|$|Initiator {{compositions}} {{are similar}} to <b>flash</b> <b>powders,</b> but they differ in burning speed, as explosion is not intended, and have intentionally high production of hot particles. They {{also tend to be}} easier to ignite than thermites, with which they also share similarities.|$|R
2500|$|The {{electric}} flash-lamp is {{a device}} that uses an electrical circuit to trigger a fuse to ignite explosive powder such as magnesium, for a brief sudden burst of bright light [...] "flash" [...] from a chemical reaction of <b>flash</b> <b>powder</b> burning. It was principally used for flash photography in the early 20th century, but had other uses as well. The flash-lamp was invented and patented on November 7, 1899 by New York City resident Joshua Lionel Cowen.|$|E
2500|$|Riis had {{for some}} time been {{wondering}} how to show the squalor of which he wrote more vividly than his words could express. He tried sketching, but was incompetent at this. Camera lenses of the 1880s were slow as was the emulsion of photographic plates; photography thus {{did not seem to}} be of any use for reporting about conditions of life in dark interiors. In early 1887, however, Riis was startled to read that [...] "a way had been discovered to take pictures by flashlight. The darkest corner might be photographed that way." [...] The German innovation, by Adolf Miethe and Johannes Gaedicke, <b>flash</b> <b>powder</b> was a mixture of magnesium with potassium chlorate and some antimony sulfide for added stability; the powder was used in a pistol-like device that fired cartridges. [...] This was the introduction of flash photography.|$|E
2500|$|On January 12, 1920, {{a front-page}} story in The New York Times, [...] "Believes Rocket Can Reach Moon", {{reported}} a Smithsonian press release about a [...] "multiple-charge, high-efficiency rocket." [...] The chief application envisaged was [...] "the possibility of sending recording apparatus to moderate and extreme altitudes within the Earth's atmosphere", the advantage over balloon-carried instruments being ease of recovery, since [...] "the new rocket apparatus would go straight up and come straight down." [...] But it also mentioned a proposal [...] "to [...] to the dark {{part of the new}} moon a sufficiently large amount of the most brilliant <b>flash</b> <b>powder</b> which, in being ignited on impact, would be plainly visible in a powerful telescope. This would be the only way of proving that the rocket had really left the attraction of the earth, as the apparatus would never come back, once it had escaped that attraction." ...|$|E
50|$|Many {{clubmosses}} produce {{highly flammable}} spores. Historically clubmoss spore coats {{have been used}} in the formation of fireworks and used in <b>flash</b> <b>powders</b> in the early life of photography. Clubmoss spores have also been used in the production of fingerprint powder and in the pharmaceutical industry to coat pills.|$|R
50|$|Various {{pyrotechnic}} compositions can be used, {{depending on}} the desired burn rate and required amount of energy and volume of gas produced. Some materials, such as RDX, sublimate in vacuum, which limits their usefulness in aerospace applications. Composition with the character of bipropellants and <b>flash</b> <b>powders</b> are often used.|$|R
5000|$|For {{photographic}} use, mixtures containing magnesium and nitrates {{are made}} much more fuel rich. The excess magnesium is volatilized by the reaction and burns in air providing additional light. In addition, the higher concentration of fuel {{results in a}} slower burn, providing more of a [...] "poof" [...] and less of a [...] "bang" [...] when ignited. A formula from 1917 specifies 5 parts of magnesium to 6 parts of barium nitrate for a stoichiometry of nine parts fuel to one part oxidizer. [...] Modern recreations of photographic <b>flash</b> <b>powders</b> may avoid the use of barium salts because of their toxic nature. A mixture of five parts 80 mesh magnesium to one part of potassium nitrate provides a good white flash without being too violent. Fuel rich <b>flash</b> <b>powders</b> are also used in theatrical flash pots.|$|R
2500|$|Though most of {{this work}} dealt with the {{theoretical}} and experimental relations between propellant, rocket mass, thrust, and velocity, a final section, entitled [...] "Calculation of minimum mass required to raise one pound to an 'infinite' altitude", discussed the possible uses of rockets, not only to reach the upper atmosphere, but to escape from Earth's gravitation altogether. He determined that a rocket with an effective exhaust velocity (see specific impulse) of 7000 feet per second and an initial weight of 602 pounds {{would be able to}} send a one-pound payload to an infinite height. Included as a thought experiment was the idea of launching a rocket to the moon and igniting a mass of <b>flash</b> <b>powder</b> on its surface, so as to be visible through a telescope. He discussed the matter seriously, down to an estimate of the amount of powder required; Goddard's conclusion was that a rocket with starting mass of 3.21 tons could produce a flash [...] "just visible" [...] from Earth, assuming a final payload weight of 10.7 pounds.|$|E
2500|$|On May 27, 1983 at {{approximately}} 9:15 AM, eleven workers were on duty when {{a cache of}} M-80 and M-100 explosives, <b>flash</b> <b>powder,</b> and other chemicals in the [...] barn detonated producing a massive explosion, instantly killing all eleven workers and leveling the barn. The initial blast was followed by several smaller blasts witnesses described as sounding like shotguns, and {{are believed to have}} been of individual firework cases that were not detonated in the initial blast. Dan Lee Webb's cousin Tommy Lee Webb, who was mowing the grass near the site, was reported to have been thrown more than 70 yards. The blast also threw debris as far as 200 yards away from the site, and produced a shock wave that leveled trees as far as 100 yards away. Bodies were hurled through the roofs of the nearby house and carport and as far away as 500 feet from the site. Nothing in the barn was left intact; all of the bodies had lost limbs and six were decapitated. Some were stripped by the force of the blast. Several witnesses claimed to have seen a white mushroom cloud which was estimated to be 600 to 800 feet tall, and the blast was heard and felt in Cleveland over 20 miles away. Several 911 calls were received moments after the initial blast, and within minutes, several police units arrived on the scene. Tommy Lee Webb, who was critically injured, was taken to Erlanger Medical Center in Chattanooga with burns on about 35 % of his body. A Tennessee Emergency Management Association (TEMA) crew, which included forensic anthropologist Dr. William M. Bass, later arrived on the scene to identify the victims.|$|E
2500|$|The matchlock firing {{mechanism}} {{became a}} common {{term for the}} arquebus after it {{was added to the}} firearm. Prior to the appearance of the matchlock, handguns were fired from the chest, tucked under one arm, while the other arm maneuvered a hot pricker to the touch hole to ignite the gunpowder. The matchlock changed this by adding a firing mechanism consisting of two parts, the match, and the lock. The lock mechanism held within a clamp a two to three feet long length of smoldering rope soaked in saltpeter, which was the match. Connected to the lock lever was a trigger, which lowered the match into a priming pan when pulled, igniting the priming powder, causing a flash to travel through the touch hole, also igniting the gunpowder within the barrel, and propelling the bullet out the muzzle. While matchlocks provided a crucial advantage by allowing the user to aim the firearm using both hands, it was also awkward to utilize. To avoid accidentally igniting the gunpowder the match had to be detached while loading the gun. In some instances the match would also go out, so both ends of the match were kept lit. This proved cumbersome to maneuver as both hands were required to hold the match during removal, one end in each hand. The procedure was so complex that a 1607 drill manual published by Jacob de Gheyn in the Netherlands listed 28 steps just to fire and load the gun. In 1584 the Ming general Qi Jiguang composed an 11 step song to practice the procedure in rhythm: [...] "One, clean the gun. Two pour the powder. Three tamp the powder down. Four drop the pellet. Five drive the pellet down. Six put in paper (stopper). Seven drive the paper down. Eight open the flashpan cover. Nine pour in the <b>flash</b> <b>powder.</b> Ten close the flashpan, and clamp the fuse. Eleven, listen for the signal, then open the flashpan cover. Aiming at the enemy, raise your gun and fire." [...] Reloading a gun during the 16th century took anywhere from between 20 seconds to a minute under the most ideal conditions.|$|E
50|$|Per{{chlorates}}, chlorates and nitrates are {{the most}} commonly used oxidizers for <b>flash</b> <b>powders.</b> Other possibilities include permanganates, chromates, and some oxides. Generally, the less the oxidizer, the slower the burning and the more light produced. For use at very high temperatures, sulfates can be used as oxidizers in combination with very strongly reducing fuels.|$|R
50|$|Magnesium based {{compositions}} degrade {{over long}} periods of time, as magnesium does not form a passivating oxide coating, meaning the metallic Mg will slowly react with atmospheric oxygen and moisture. In military pyrotechnics involving magnesium fuels, external oxygen can be excluded by using hermetically sealed canisters. Commercial photographic <b>flash</b> <b>powders</b> are sold as two-part mixtures, to be combined immediately before use.|$|R
50|$|<b>Flash</b> <b>powders</b> - {{especially}} those that use chlorate - are often highly sensitive to friction, heat/flame and static electricity. A spark of as little as 0.1-10 millijoules can set off certain mixtures. Certain formulations prominent in the underground press contain both sulphur and potassium chlorate. These mixtures are especially shock and friction sensitive and in many applications should be considered unpredictable. Modern pyrotechnic practices call for never using sulphur in a mix containing chlorate salts.|$|R
5000|$|Most of the [...] "salutes" [...] {{are made}} with <b>flash</b> <b>powder.</b> <b>Flash</b> <b>powder</b> has a very fast burn rate, unlike black powder.|$|E
50|$|A shell {{intended}} {{to produce a}} loud report rather than a visual effect. Salute shells usually contain <b>flash</b> <b>powder,</b> producing a quick flash followed by a very loud report. Titanium may {{be added to the}} <b>flash</b> <b>powder</b> mix to produce a cloud of bright sparks around the flash. Salutes are commonly used in large quantities during finales to create intense noise and brightness. They are often cylindrical in shape to allow for a larger payload of <b>flash</b> <b>powder,</b> but ball shapes are common and cheaper as well. Salutes are also called Maroons.|$|E
50|$|Flash powders {{even within}} {{intended}} usages often release explosive force of deadly capacity. Nearly all widely used <b>flash</b> <b>powder</b> mixtures {{are sensitive to}} shock, friction and electrostatic discharge. In certain mixtures, {{it is not uncommon}} for this sensitivity to spontaneously change over time, or due to change in the environment, or to other unknowable factors in either the original manufacturing or in real-world storage. Additionally, accidental contaminants such as strong acids or sulphur compounds can sensitise them even more. Because <b>flash</b> <b>powder</b> mixtures are so easy to initiate, there is potentially a high risk of accidental explosions which can inflict severe blast/fragmentation injuries, e.g. blindness, explosive amputation, permanent maiming, or disfigurement. Fatalities have occurred. The various <b>flash</b> <b>powder</b> compositions should therefore not be handled by anyone who is unfamiliar with their properties, or the handling techniques required to maintain safety. <b>Flash</b> <b>powder</b> and <b>flash</b> <b>powder</b> devices pose exceptionally high risks to children, who typically cannot understand the danger and may be less adept with safe handling techniques. As a result, children tend to suffer more severe injuries than adults.|$|E
5000|$|Barium nitrate - {{most common}} oxidizer/colorant for {{green and white}} colors, but with {{somewhat}} weak colorant effect;requires a chlorine donor. Also used in <b>flash</b> <b>powders</b> and some military infrared flares. Barium {{also serves as a}} stabilizer for the mixtures; decomposes at higher temperatures than nitrates of lighter metals and promotes higher burning temperatures. With aluminium produces bright silver sparks; when used with aluminium, addition of boric acid as stabilizer is advised. Not very hygroscopic.|$|R
50|$|Some {{pyrotechnic}} compositions {{are used}} in industry and aerospace for generation of large volumes of gas in gas generators (e.g. in airbags), in pyrotechnic fasteners, and in other similar applications. They are also used in military pyrotechnics, when production of large amount of noise, light, or infrared radiation is required; e.g. missile decoy flares, <b>flash</b> <b>powders,</b> and stun grenades. A new class of reactive material compositions is now under investigation by military.|$|R
5000|$|Antimony trisulfide finds use in {{pyrotechnic}} compositions, namely in {{the glitter}} and fountain mixtures. Needle-like crystals, [...] "Chinese Needle", {{are used in}} glitter compositions and white pyrotechnic stars. The [...] "Dark Pyro" [...] version is used in <b>flash</b> <b>powders</b> to increase their sensitivity and sharpen their report. It is also a component of modern safety matches. It was formerly used in flash compositions, but its use was abandoned due to toxicity and sensitivity to static electricity.|$|R

40|$|A {{new method}} has been {{developed}} to allow the determination of potassium in post-explosion residues to be made using miniaturised isotachophoresis.

With the conditions selected no interference was noted from other small inorganic cations, such as ammonium, barium, calcium, magnesium, sodium or strontium. The method was successfully applied to the analysis of seven samples containing explosive residues obtained from the unconfined burning of several <b>flash</b> <b>powders.</b> The procedure was found to offer good linearity for potassium determinations over the concentration range of 1. 25 – 150 μg/mL with a coefficient of determination of 0. 999 achieved...|$|R
