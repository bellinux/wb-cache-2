In order to limit the maximum power, an air restrictor of 20 mm of diameter is imposed in the intake line. To overcome the limitations caused by the restrictor, Firenze Race Team equipped its one-cylinder engine with a turbocharger, which is conventionally provided with a wastegate (WG) valve to limit the maximum boost pressure and avoid <b>knocking</b> <b>phenomena.</b> Typically, the WG valve is controlled by a pneumatic actuator, which opens the valve according to a defined and constant maximum boost pressure downstream the compressor in the whole engine operating range.

40|$|A {{promising}} {{approach for}} improving the efficiency of internal combustion engines is to employ a working fluid with a high specific heat ratio such as the noble gas argon. Moreover, all harmful emissions are eliminated when the intake charge is composed of oxygen, nonreactive argon, and hydrogen fuel. Previous research demonstrated indicated thermal efficiencies greater than 45 % at 5. 5 compression ratio in engines operating with hydrogen, oxygen, and argon. However, knock limits spark advance and increasing the efficiency further. Conditions under which knock occurs in such engines differs from typical gasoline fueled engines. In-cylinder temperatures using hydrogen-oxygen-argon are higher due to the high specific heat ratio and pressures are lower because of the low compression ratio. Better understanding of knock under these conditions can lead to operating strategies that inhibit knock and allow operation closer to the knock limit. In this work we compare knock with a hydrogen, oxygen, and argon mixture to that of air-gasoline mixtures in a variable compression ratio cooperative fuels research (CFR) engine. The focus is on stability of <b>knocking</b> <b>phenomena,</b> as well as, amplitude and frequency of the resulting pressure waves...|$|E

In general, damage {{is located in}} the combustion chamber surfaces and in the ring grooves, where a layer of non-volatile combustion products is deposited. These deposits attached to the surfaces reduce heat transfer and increase inner temperature, which produces a <b>knocking</b> <b>phenomena</b> damaging the crank bearings and fusing of the piston head material. Lubrication problems also appear due to the formation of a layer of soft paste silicone deposits in the rings grooves, which increases friction losses and accelerates wear on cylinder and rings. In this paper, some typical examples of damaged engines are presented. The deposits found were analysed using Scanning Electron Microscope and Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (SEM–-EDX). Additionally, the engine oil used was also analysed by Infra-Red Spectrometry (IR) and the results were compared with known organo-compounds. A method to detect incipient failure caused by organo-compounds contained in landfill gas is introduced. Silica appears in the layers covering the combustion chamber, as well as silicone compound in the top cylinder zone, piston and ring grooves.

40|$|In {{the effort}} to reduce {{pollutant}} emissions from diesel engines various solutions have been proposed, {{one of which is}} the use of natural gas as supplement to liquid diesel fuel, with these engines referred to as fumigated, dual fuel, compression ignition engines. One of the main purposes of using natural gas in dual fuel (liquid and gaseous one) combustion systems is to reduce particulate emissions and nitrogen oxides. Natural gas is a clean burning fuel; it possesses a relatively high auto-ignition temperature, which is a serious advantage over other gaseous fuels since then the compression ratio of most conventional direct injection (DI) diesel engines can be maintained high. In the present work, an experimental investigation has been conducted {{to examine the effects of}} the total air-fuel ratio on the efficiency and pollutant emissions of a high speed, compression ignition engine located at the authors' laboratory, where liquid diesel fuel is partially substituted by natural gas in various proportions, with the natural gas fumigated into the intake air. The experimental results disclose the effect of these parameters on brake thermal efficiency, exhaust gas temperature, nitric oxide, carbon monoxide, unburned hydrocarbons and soot emissions, with the beneficial effect of the presence of natural gas being revealed. Given that the experimental measurements cover a wide range of liquid diesel supplementary ratios without any appearance of <b>knocking</b> <b>phenomena,</b> the belief is strengthened that the findings of the present work can be very valuable if opted to apply this technology on existing DI diesel engines.

40|$|Gaseous fuels, such as Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) and Natural Gas (NG), {{thanks to}} their {{excellent}} mixing capabilities and high knocking resistance, allow complete and cleaner combustion than gasoline in Spark Ignition (SI) engines, resulting in lower pollutant emissions, above all if particulate matter is considered. In previous works [1, 2] the authors proved how the simultaneous combustion of gasoline and gaseous fuel (NG or LPG) may strongly reduce both fuel consumption and pollutant emissions with respect to pure gasoline operation without a significant power loss. These very encouraging results were obtained thanks to the strong knock resistance increase obtained adding gaseous fuel to gasoline, which allowed the use of stoichiometric mixtures and better spark advances, even at full load. The introduction of such a kind of combustion in series production engines would however {{require the use of}} properly calibrated simulation models, capable to adequately predict the performance and efficiency of engines fuelled by gaseous fuel-gasoline mixtures; in particular, specific combustion models are needed, together with reliable knock onset prediction sub-model. The total absence of such sub-models in the scientific literature induced the authors to investigate the knocking resistance of gasoline-propane mixtures and calibrate a proper knock onset prediction sub-model to be implemented in the zero dimensional thermodynamic models usually employed for engine performance optimization. To this purpose several light knocking in-cylinder pressure cycles have been recorded on a CFR engine, fuelled by gasoline, propane and their mixtures, varying the most important knock-related parameters: compression ratio, spark advance, inlet mixture temperature and fuel mixture composition. The collected data have been used to calibrate two different models, compared in terms of knock onset prediction accuracy: the Knock Integral model (KI) and the Ignition Delay model (ID). Both models revealed a good reliability in predicting the onset of <b>knocking</b> <b>phenomena,</b> with maximum errors around 4 crank angle degrees. The Knock Integral model showed a slightly higher accuracy, which, together with its lower computational effort, makes it preferable for the implementation in the commonly employed thermodynamic engine models...|$|E

For modelling the combustion first the laminar flamelet model and a hybrid Lagrangian / Eulerian method are developed and implemented {{to provide a}} framework for incorporating detailed chemical kinetics. This model can be applied to an engine for the validation of the chemical kinetic mechanism. The chemical kinetics, reaction rates and their equations lead to a certain formula for which the coefficients can be obtained from different sources, such as NASA polynomials [1]. This is followed by study of the simulation results and significant findings. Finally, for investigation of the <b>knock</b> <b>phenomenon</b> some characteristics such as compression ratio, fuel equivalence ratio, spark timing and their effects on the performance of an engine are examined and discussed. The OH radical concentration (which is the main factor for production of knock) is evaluated with regard to adjustment of the above mentioned characteristic parameters. In the second part of this work the specification of the sample engine is given and the results obtained from simulation are compared with experimental results for this sample engine, in order to validate the method applied in AVL Fire software. This method is used to investigate and optimize the effects of parameters such as inlet temperature, fuels ratio, diesel fuel injection timing, engine RPM and EGR on combustion in a dual fuel HCCI engine. For modelling the dual fuel HCCI engine AVL FIRE software is applied to simulate the combustion and study the optimization of a combustion chamber design. The findings for the dual fuel HCCI engine show that the mixture of methane and diesel fuel has a great influence on an engine's power and emissions. Inlet air temperature has also {{a significant role in the}} start of combustion so that inlet temperature is a factor in auto-ignition. With an increase of methane fuel, the burning process will be more rapid and oxidation becomes more complete. As a result, the amounts of CO and HC emissions decrease remarkably.

In particular, a 1 D model, properly accounting for cycle-by-cycle variations, and coupled to a reduced kinetic sub-model, is used to reproduce the measured cycles, in terms of statistical distribution of a theoretical knock index. In addition, few individual cycles, representative of the whole dataset, are selected in a single operating condition in order to perform a more detailed knock analysis {{by means of a}} 3 D CFD approach, coupled to a tabulated chemistry technique for auto-ignition modeling. Outcomes of 1 D and 3 D models are compared to the ARMA results and a substantial coherence of the numerical and experimental results is demonstrated.

40|$|International audienceMost of the time, Spark Ignition (SI) engine {{performance}} {{is limited by}} <b>knock</b> <b>phenomena</b> (especially for turbocharged engines), which are linked to fuel resistance to auto-ignition, quantified by its octane number (Research Octane Number – RON and Motor Octane Number-MON). If high octane numbers are crucial for efficient high load operating points, they are less necessary at low load. Thus, if the octane number of the fuel could be tuned as any other engine setting parameter, the engine efficiency and CO 2 emissions could be improved, leading to an " Octane on Demand " concept, using for instance a dual fuel strategy. This requires understanding the behavior of dual fuel combustions with lower / higher octane fuels, and more particularly the evolution of RON when blending high RON fuels with low RON ones. Developing an Octane on Demand concept requires to choose appropriate octane enhancers and understand their blending behavior. For this purpose, RON measurements were performed on a CFR engine using {{a wide range of}} mixtures of low-octane base fuels with various boosters capable of increasing the antiknock resistance of the blends.

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. It {{has been}} {{known for a long time}} that alcohol-gasoline blended fuels exhibit an unexplained {{tendency}} to knock at high engine speeds; a characteristic that is not generally experienced with conventional gasoline. Early studies showed that the problem could be linked to an unusually high temperature sensitivity exhibited by the blended fuels, but the exact cause of this temperature sensitivity was not readily identified, and research efforts became diversified in attempts to make headway. Initial studies in the field of high-speed knock were based on the assumption that a chemical reaction sensitivity to temperature was the root cause. It is now suspected that the effect may be due to a thermal manifestation of the variation in evaporative cooling characteristics of different fuels at different engine speeds. Research findings leading up to the present project have indicated that the high-speed <b>knock</b> <b>phenomenon</b> could be explained by the influence on the overall mixture temperature of the thermal-evaporative behaviour of a fuel during the inlet process. The thermal-evaporative behaviour is very complex, however, and has been characterized only tentatively, as yet. The present project was initiated to study the effect of engine speed on the fuel evaporation behaviour and on the complex heat transfer processes that occur within the intake manifold of a spark-ignition engine. The primary aim of the project was to establish the temperature of the air/fuel mixture after the inlet process has been completed, and to identify how this temperature responds to changes in engine speed and fuel composition. The fuels investigated included conventional gasoline and gasoline-alcohol blends.

40|$|Experiments {{were carried}} out to collect {{in-cylinder}} pressure data and microphone signals from a single-cylinder test engine using spark timings before, at, and after knock onset for four different octane-rated toluene reference fuels. This data was then processed and analyzed in various ways to gain insight into the autoignition phenomena that lead to knock. This was done to develop a more fundamentally based prediction methodology that incorporates both a physical and chemical description of knock. The collected data was also used to develop a method of data processing that would detect knock in real time without {{the need to have}} an operator listening to the engine. Bandpass filters and smoothing techniques were used to process the data. The processed data was then used to determine knock intensities for each cycle for both the cylinder pressure data and microphone signal. Also, the rate of build-up before reaching peak amplitude in a bandpass filtered pressure trace was found. A trend was found showing that cycles with knock intensities greater than 1 bar with rapid build-up (5 - 10 oscillations) before reaching the peak are the type the cycles whose autoignition events lead to engine knock. (cont.) The cylinder pressure knock intensities and microphone knock intensities were plotted and then fit with a linear trendline. The R 2 value for these linear trendlines will transition from considerably lower values to values greater than 0. 85 at the spark timing of knock onset. It is believed that the higher cylinder pressure knock intensities, in conjunction with the faster build-up of 5 - 10 oscillations before reaching peak, helps to explain the <b>knock</b> <b>phenomena.</b> It supports conclusions from previous works that the end gas contains one or more hot spots that autoignite in sequence causing pressure gradients that can trigger rapid pressure oscillations. These pressure oscillations can cause block and head vibrations that lead to audible noise outside the engine. by Bridget M. Revier. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|Recently, a {{tendency}} is consolidating to produce low displacement turbocharged spark-ignition engines. This design philosophy, known as “engine downsizing”, allows to reduce mechanical and pumping losses at low load {{as a consequence}} of the higher operating Brake Mean Effective Pressure (BMEP). The presence of the turbocharger allows to restore the maximum power output of the larger displacement engine. Additional advantages are a higher low-speed torque and hence a better drivability and fun-to-drive. Of course, at high loads, the spark-advance must be carefully controlled to avoid the knock occurrence and this determines a substantial penalization of the fuel consumption. The knowledge of the knock-limited spark timing is hence a key point in order to reduce the fuel consumption drop at high loads. In a previous study [1], a combined procedure for the quasi-dimensional modeling of both combustion and <b>knock</b> <b>phenomena</b> was developed and applied to a 1 D thermodynamic engine model in order to find the knock-limited spark-advance at wide-open-throttle (WOT) conditions, for different engine speeds. In the present paper, indeed, the previous analysis is extended to include the cycle-by-cycle variations effects. Cyclic dispersion is characterized through the introduction of a random variation on a number of parameters controlling the rate of heat release (air/fuel ratio, initial flame kernel duration and radius, EGR rate, turbulence intensity). The intensity of the random variation is specified in order to realize an Indicated Mean Effective Pressure (IMEP) coefficient of variation similar to the experimentally observed one. A kinetic scheme is then solved within the unburned gas zone, characterized by different thermodynamic conditions occurring cycle-by-cycle. This allows, for a given spark timing, to estimate a statistical distribution of a properly defined knock indicator. To the aim of validating the developed methodology, a DFT analysis of consecutive experimental pressure cycles is carried out in different operating conditions. High frequency pressure oscillations, typical of knocking occurrence, can be recognized and the statistical distribution of knocking intensity is in this way identified. Numerical and experimental results are finally compared in terms of coefficient of variation, and a good agreement is found...|$|R

40|$|The {{globalization}} {{of the gas}} market and the drive towards sustainability are increasing {{the diversity of the}} supply of gases to the natural gas infrastructure. As a rule, "new" gases have different chemical compositions than the gases traditionally distributed. For the optimal and safe operation of gas engines, it is of great importance to characterize the knock resistance of gases accurately. <b>Knock</b> <b>phenomena</b> are caused by autoignition of unburned fuel mixture, the so-called end gas, in the cylinder before the mixture is completely consumed by the propagating flame. Mild engine knock increases pollutant emissions, while severe knock can cause engine failure or physically damage the engine, and should thus be avoided. Rather than rely on the empirical methods using gas mixtures and “standard” engines traditionally employed for this purpose, we have developed a method to characterize the knock resistance of gases based on the combustion properties of the fuel mixtures. The core of the method described in this paper is the computation of the autoignition process during the compression and burn periods of the engine cycle. The chemical mechanism used to compute autoignition has been tested against experimentally determined autoignition delay times for a broad range of gaseous fuels measured in our Rapid Compression Machine (RCM) at conditions relevant to spark-ignited gas engines. In addition to the effects on autoignition itself, the effects of fuel composition on the in-cylinder pressure and temperature conditions relevant for knocking, such as changes in the combustion rate are also incorporated in the method. Comparison between predicted and measured pressure profiles shows that the model accurately predicts the changes in the in-cylinder pressure when varying the fuel composition in our high-speed medium Brake Mean Effective Pressure (BMEP) engine. To rank the knock resistance of different gases for the lean-burn, spark-ignited gas engine used in this study the recently developed propane-based scale (Propane Knock Index, PKI) is extended to consider pipeline gases ‎ 34]. In this scale, the knock resistance for a given gaseous fuel mixture is expressed as an equivalent fraction of propane in methane under the same engine conditions. We demonstrate the veracity of the knock model by comparing the predictions of autoignition of the end gas using the model {{for a wide variety of}} fuel compositions, expressed as the computed PKI, with the Knock-Limited Spark Timing (KLST) measured in the DNV GL engine for the following mixtures: Dutch Natural Gas (DNG), DNG/C 2 H 6 /C 3 H 8, DNG/H 2, DNG/C 2 H 6 /C 3 H 8 /H 2, CH 4 /C 2 H 6, CH 4 /C 3 H 8, CH 4 /i-C 4 H 10, CH 4 /n-C 4 H 10, CH 4 /C 2 H 6 /C 3 H 8 and CH 4 /C 3 H 8 /N 2. The predicted ranking of knock resistance of these mixtures is shown to be in excellent agreement with the KLST measurements. Comparison of the verified PKIs calculated for the range of gases studied with methane numbers calculated using the AVL and the MWM methods points to shortcomings in these yardsticks in predicting knock resistance for the gas engine used in this study. Since the DNV GL method is based on the physical and chemical processes that govern knock, it can be adapted in a straightforward manner to new engines and fuels. Being a fundamentally correct approach, the predictive power of the DNV GL method makes this methodology well suited to serve as the basis for a standard. Additionally, the method provides a valuable tool for gas engine manufacturers to define knock-free gas engine performance ratings for today’s and tomorrow’s gaseous fuels...|$|R

40|$|Gasoline - ethanol blends were {{explored}} {{as a strategy}} to mitigate engine <b>knock,</b> a <b>phenomena</b> in spark ignition engine combustion when {{a portion of the}} end gas is compressed to the point of spontaneous auto-ignition. This auto-ignition is dangerous to the operation of an internal combustion engine, as it can severely damage engine components. As engine designers are trying to improve the efficiency of the internal combustion engine, engine knock is a key limiting factor in engine design. Two methods have been used to limit engine knock that will be considered here; retarding the spark timing and addition of additives to reduce the tendency of the fuel mixture to knock. Both have drawbacks. Retarding spark reduces the engine efficiency and additives typically lower the heating value of the fuel, requiring more fuel for a given operating point. To study this problem a turbocharged engine was tested with a variety of combinations of gasoline and ethanol, an additive with very good anti-knock abilities. Pressure was recorded and GT Power simulations were used to determine the temperature within the cylinder. An effective octane number was calculated to measure the ability of the fuel to resist knock. Effective octane numbers varied from 91 for UTG 91 to 111 for E 25, respectively. Engine simulations were used to extrapolate to points that couldn't be tested in the experimental setup and generate performance maps which could be used to predict how the engine would act inside of a vehicle. It was found that increasing the compression ratio from 9. 2 to 13. 5 leads to a 7 % relative increase in part load efficiency. When applied in a vehicle this leads to a 2 - 6 % increase in miles per gallon of gasoline consumption depending on the drive cycle used. Miles per gallon of ethanol used were significantly higher than gasoline; 141 miles per gallon of ethanol was the lowest mileage over all cycles studied. by Raymond Lewis. Thesis: S.

In this context, research work has been proceed with CORE (CO 2 reduction for long distance transport) project, which is a collaborative large-scale integrating project for a call within FP 7 -SUSTAINABLE SURFACE TRANSPORT of the EC. The project consortium consists of three truck manufactures in Europe: Volvo, Daimler and IVECO, together with 13 other partners in the automotive industry and universities and it aims to demonstrate a substantial reduction of CO 2 emissions, 15 % improved fuel efficiency compared to a EURO V engine and fulfilling EURO VI emission legislation at the same time. The project is inserted in a series of research projects, which have been performed by the EC with the aim of boosting the cooperation among car manufactures, suppliers and technical universities as well as of defining enhanced and feasible solutions for the market. During this thesis research work within the CORE Project, a heavy duty engine fuelled with compressed natural gas (CNG) using VVA technology has been numerically modelled using 0 / 1 D commercial tool GT Power. Since with VVA technology, it results lower exhaust temperatures which is not favoured by considering the aftertreatment working conditions. The advanced combustion management, thus the retarding combustion strategy combined with different valve profiles, has been numerically simulated in order to reach a good condition for aftertreatment working conditions both at steady state and transient conditions. Retarding combustion strategies have been numerically tested in order to increase the turbine outlet temperature by limiting the fuel consumption increment. At the same time, the upper limit of the turbine inlet temperature has also been taken into account. In order to obtain more opportunities to increase the model accuracy and to extend its applicability, based on the engine model built with GT Power, a user defined combustion based on fractal approach has been embedded. This user defined combustion is composed of several submodels (flow submodel, CAD submodel, flame submodel, combustion submodel [...] . etc). The validation of these submodels' coupling is done by comparing simulated and experimental data over a complete engine operating map after the calibration work. The model has shown its ability to reproduce the experimental data under the same working conditions with very high accuracy. Thus with this embedded combustion approach, it makes the model from a non-predictive one to a predictive one. Several applications have been numerically proceeded with this new model under transient condition tests with advanced combustion management and it demonstrates its good applicability and accuracy. Then this newly developed user combustion approach has been applied on the other two light duty engines: 1. 4 l T-jet PFI natural gas engine and 1. 4 l T DI natural gas engine. The engine models built in GT power have been carefully calibrated and they are able to reproduce the experimental data under the same working conditions with very high accuracy. A new application has been tested based on the engine models in which it is able to produce a spark advance value by targeting a proper MFB 50 value. The models are able to give comparable spark advance results once the users target the experimental MFB 50 values. This again further proves the robustness of the predictive model the developed user combustion approach. Meanwhile doing the predictive modelling for both engines, the flow submodel of the user combustion approach has also been improved with a available set of flow data obtained from 3 D CFD simulations. The simulated turbulence intensity over the engine revolution has reached a comparable level of the results coming from 3 D CFD data. The outcome of the work during the Ph. D study has been published in the following list. 1. Mirko Baratta, Roberto Finesso, Daniela Misul, Ezio Spessa, Yifei Tong, and Cesare Peletto.

40|$|Different {{technologies}} are being utilized nowadays aiming {{to boost the}} fuel efficiency of Spark-Ignition (SI) engines. Two promising technologies which are used to improve the part load efficiency of SI engines are the utilization of downsizing in combination with turbocharging and cylinder deactivation. Both technologies allow a shift of load points towards higher loads and therefore towards more efficient zones of the engine map, while performance is being preserved or even enhanced despite the smaller displacement thanks to high boost levels. However, utilization of both technologies will {{increase the risk of}} knock dramatically. Therefore, the abovementioned systems can be coupled with other technologies such as gasoline direct injection, Miller cycle and water injection to mitigate knock at higher load operating conditions. Therefore, the aim of the current work is to investigate, through experimental and numerical analysis, the potential benefits of different knock mitigation techniques and to develop reliable and predictive simulation models aiming to detect root cause of cyclic variations and <b>knock</b> <b>phenomena</b> in downsized turbocharged SI engines. After a brief introduction in Chapter 1, three different typical European downsized turbocharged SI engines have been introduced in Chapter 2, which were used for both experimental and simulation investigations, named as Engine A, which is downsized and turbocharged, Port Fuel Injection (PFI) with fixed valve lift and represents the baseline; Engine B, represents an upgraded version of Engine A, featuring Variable Valve Actuation (VVA), and Engine C which is a direct injection and further downsized engine. Engine B, equipped with MultiAir VVA system, was utilized to evaluate the possible benefits of cylinder deactivation in terms of fuel economy at part load condition, which is discussed in Chapter 3. Since the MultiAir VVA system does not allow exhaust valve deactivation, an innovative strategy was developed, exploiting internal Exhaust Gas Recirculation (iEGR) in the inactive cylinders in order to minimize their pumping losses. However, at higher load operating condition, risk of knock occurrence limits the performance of the engine. Therefore, the possible benefits of different knock mitigation techniques such as Miller Cycle and water injection in terms of fuel consumption were discussed in Chapter 4. Potential benefits of Miller cycle in terms of knock mitigation are evaluated experimentally using Engine B, as shown in Chapter 4. 2. After a preliminary investigation, the superior knock mitigation effect of Late Intake Valve Closure (LIVC) with respect to Early Intake Valve Closure (EIVC) strategy was confirmed; therefore, the study was mainly focused on the latter system. It was found out that utilization of LIVC leads up to 20 % improvement in the engine indicated fuel conversion efficiency. Afterwards, Engine C, a gasoline direct injection engine, has been utilized {{in order to understand the}} potential benefits of water injection for knock mitigation technology coupled with the Miller Cycle, which is discussed in Chapter 4. 3. Thanks to water injection potential for knock mitigation, the compression ratio could be increased from 10 to 13, which leads to an impressive efficiency improvement of 4. 5 %. However, utilization of various advanced knock mitigation techniques in the development of SI engines make the system more complex, which invokes the necessity to develop reliable models to predict knock and to find the optimized configuration of modern high-performance, downsized and turbocharged SI engines. Considering that knock is strictly related to Cycle-to-Cycle Variations (CCV) of in-cylinder pressure, CCV prediction is an important step to predict the risk of abnormal combustion on a cycle by cycle basis. Consequently, in Chapter 5, a procedure has been introduced aiming to predict the mean in-cylinder pressure and to mimic CCV at different operating conditions. First, a 0 D turbulent combustion model has been calibrated based on the experimental data including various technologies used for knock mitigation which can impact significantly on the combustion process, such as Long Route EGR and water injection. Afterwards, suitable perturbations are adapted to the mean cycle aiming to mimic CCV. Finally, the model has been coupled with a 0 D knock model aiming to predict knock limited spark advance at different operating conditions. Finally, in order to provide a further contribution towards the prediction of CCV, 3 D-CFD Large Eddy Simulation (LES) has been carried out in order to better understand the root cause of CCV, presented in Chapter 6. Such analysis could be used to extract the physical perturbation from the 3 D-CFD and to use it as an input for the 0 D combustion model to predict CCV. The operating condition studied in this work is at 2500 rpm, 16 bar brake mean effective pressure (bmep) and stoichiometric condition. Based on the analysis conducted using LES, it was found out that the variability in combustion can be mainly attributed to both the direction of the velocity flow-field and its magnitude in the region around the spark plug. Furthermore, the effect of velocity field and equivalence ratio on the combustion has been decoupled, confirming that the former has the dominant effect while the latter has minor impact on combustion variability. In conclusion, simulation models using 0 D and 3 D-CFD tools when calibrated properly based on experimental measurements can be used to support the design and the development of innovative downsized turbocharged SI engines considering the effects of CCV and knock on engine performance parameters...|$|R

40|$|Increasingly {{stringent}} {{regulations and}} rising fuel costs require that automotive manufacturers reduce their fleet CO 2 emissions. Gasoline engine downsizing {{is one such}} technology {{at the forefront of}} improvements in fuel economy. As engine downsizing becomes more aggressive, normal engine operating points are moving into higher load regions, typically requiring over-fuelling to maintain exhaust gas temperatures within component protection limits and retarded ignition timings in order to mitigate knock and pre-ignition events. These two mechanisms are counterproductive, since the retarded ignition timing delays combustion, in turn raising exhaust gas temperature. A key process being used to inhibit the occurrence of these <b>knock</b> and pre-ignition <b>phenomena</b> is cooled exhaust gas recirculation (EGR). Cooled EGR lowers temperatures during the combustion process, reducing the possibility of knock, and can thus reduce or eliminate the need for over-fuelling. It has also been shown to reduce exhaust gas temperature and improve combustion efficiency through improved combustion phasing. This paper reviews data collected on ‘ULTRABOOST’, a collaborative research project which is co-funded by the Technology Strategy Board, the UK's innovation agency. The project is based on a prototype, heavily downsized 2. 0 L DISI engine running under controlled boost conditions, featuring low pressure or ‘long route’ EGR. This allows for the EGR feed gas to be fed from either pre- or post-catalyst sampling points. This paper will present data collected at equivalent operating conditions using both catalyzed and un-catalyzed exhaust gas to feed the EGR system. Some comparison of equivalent BMEP levels will be made {{but this is not the}} focus of the investigation. Current standards utilize a CO 2 ratio for EGR measurement, but the results presented highlight inaccuracies in this measurement method when repeatable test conditions for pre- and post-catalyst EGR routes are required due to the significant changes in gas composition pre- and post-catalyst. The test engine was artificially boosted utilizing a Combustion Air Handling Unit to simulate commercially available turbo-machinery, which allowed for the catalyst effects to be assessed in isolation. Results from the engine are presented for constant intake manifold pressure and constant EGR mass flow to highlight the effects of the EGR feed gas composition on a range of engine performance metrics...|$|R
