500|$|Touchscreen control {{components}} on iPhone 6 logic boards have insufficient support, including {{a lack of}} underfill—which strengthens and stabilizes integrated circuits, {{and a lack of}} rigid metal shielding on the logic board unlike previous iPhone models; the touchscreen controller is instead shielded by a flexible [...] "sticker". Normal use of the device can cause the logic board to flex internally, which strains the touchscreen IC connectors and leads to a degradation or outright loss of touchscreen functionality. A symptom that has been associated with this type of failure is a flickering <b>grey</b> <b>bar</b> {{near the top of the}} display. iFixit reported that this issue, nicknamed [...] "touch disease", was a byproduct of the previous [...] "Bendgate" [...] design flaw because of the device's demonstrated lack of rigidity. As such, the larger iPhone 6 Plus is more susceptible to the flaw, but it has also been reported on a small percentage of iPhone 6 models. The devices' successor, the iPhone 6S, is not afflicted by this flaw due to changes to their internal design, which included the strengthening of [...] "key points" [...] in the rear casing, and the re-location of the touchscreen controllers to the display assembly from the logic board.|$|E

50|$|The {{male and}} female buffy hummingbird are similar in {{appearance}} but the female tends to be less brightly coloured, and there is considerable variation in shade between individuals. The back and upper parts of the bird are a dull green, the underparts pale cinnamon-buff and the belly and undertail coverts white. The tail is dull green with a transverse <b>grey</b> <b>bar</b> and a rounded end. There is a white spot behind the eye and the beak is slender and straight.

The chat itself involved a type of console by which the user apparently linked to the Hell.com parallel web.

50|$|The four {{resources}} of the game are money, power, food, and water. Each is measured by a meter in the upper-left corner of the screen and by clicking on any individual item, a graph of the resource over time is displayed. Each turn, a red section on the <b>grey</b> <b>bar</b> shows the estimated amount by which that resource will be reduced, and a green section shows the estimated growth. These bars adjust themselves to the selected policies as they are affected. Most policy cards deplete or grow different resources, and {{if any of the}} resource bars are reduced to nothing or are entirely in the red, policy cards requiring that resource become unavailable. When a resource is exhausted {{by the end of the}} turn, the player must manage a corresponding disaster the following turn.|$|E

The circular <b>grey</b> <b>bar</b> inside the health bar is your grappling stamina. When grabbing or mounting an opponent, your bar will drain. The top-left hand side represents the character rage meter, which, when filled, allows the player {{to pull off a}} variety of combos and styles. In rage, you will become temporarily invincible, using finishing moves and inflicting serious damage on the opponent. The player's allies, if they are knocked out, the player can use flash to replenish their health. However, if the playable character's loses all of their health, the mission ends and the player will be prompted to resume from the checkpoint or restart the mission from the beginning. Defeating enemies will cause items to fall from their bodies; flash to restore your health; spray to spray over enemy gang territory's; and money which can be used to purchase items from dealers.|$|E

50|$|The African goshawk is {{a medium}} sized to large Accipiter which is mainly grey and rufous with the typical broad winged and long tailed shape of its genus.

The underwing is pale rufous fading to white on some birds and the flight {{feathers}} and tail vary from sooty brown to grey with faint <b>grey</b> <b>bars</b> above, white with <b>grey</b> <b>bars</b> below. The bill is black, the cere is greenish-grey, the eyes are yellow and the legs and feet are yellow. Juveniles are brown above and boldly blotched with brown and with brown flank bars too. Females weigh 270 - 510 g, while smaller males weigh 150 - 340 g. They wingspan is 172 - 225 mm for males and 211 - 275 mm in females, the wingspan is 1.7 times the bird's total length.|$|R
50|$|The {{gabar goshawk}} is {{polymorphic}} and occurs in two distinct forms which fluctuate in relative abundance across the geographic {{range of the}} species. The more frequent, paler form has mostly grey upperparts with a conspicuous, white rump and white and <b>grey</b> <b>barring</b> on the chest, thighs and underwings, and a dark <b>grey,</b> <b>barred</b> tail. In contrast, the less frequent form, which accounts on average for approximately 25 percent of the overall population, is almost completely black. In both forms of adult the eyes are dark, and the long legs and the cere are red. The cere and the legs are yellow in immatures and the plumage is generally browner, with the pale birds having untidy barring on the chest than the adult. The females are significantly larger than the males, the male's weigh 90 - 173g and the females 167 - 240g The body length is 28-36 cm and the wingspan 63 cm.|$|R

These are terminated by an angulated dark <b>grey</b> <b>bar</b> in the middle of the disc, edged with orange and pale ochreous suffusion. The posterior area from near beyond this is light ochreous suffused orange in the disc, towards the dorsum anteriorly forming streaks on the veins and tinged crimson, including a dark ferruginous dot on the end of the cell, two short oblique dark grey marks from the costa before and beyond three-fourths and one just above the apex, a deep ferruginous transverse line at seven-eights edged anteriorly by white marks below the costa and below the middle, and limiting a deep ferruginous blotch extending along the termen, becoming purplish towards its middle. The hindwings are dark fuscous.|$|E
5000|$|Seaman {{displayed}} rank {{through the}} use of sleeve chevrons and badges. Enlisted sailors, who wore no insignia, were known by the generic term Matrose and used a rating system similar to other European navies of the day. Rating badges {{in the form of a}} small patch were worn on the upper left sleeve and indicated the particular specialty of the sailor in question. The enlistment system of the Kriegsmarine was designed to differentiate between those sailors wishing to make the navy a career and those simply completing a standard tour of enlistment. Those who were drafted, or who had no aspirations to become Petty Officers, could advance to become Matrosengefreiter (literally [...] "Seaman Corporals"). Special grades existed for those sailors with six and eight years of service, denoted by embroidered sleeve chevrons. A further classification for Seaman was that of Unteroffizier Aspirant. Such seaman were recognized as in training to become Petty officers and wore a silver <b>grey</b> <b>bar</b> beneath their sleeve chevron while in training and a [...] "nested" [...] chevron bar once training was complete.
