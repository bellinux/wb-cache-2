40|$|AbstractFor gas {{cogeneration}} system, {{there are}} problems to be solved. There is great heat transfer temperature difference in the heat-exchange progress. It can cause huge irreversible loss of heat transfer. More seriously, exhaust temperature of flue gas is generally more than 90 °C. The part of the heat {{is equal to the}} 40 percent of heating load. The return water conventionally has a high temperature, so the flue gas waste heat is difficult to recover. Based on the situation, this paper introduced the technique of flue gas waste heat recovery in gas cogeneration based on absorption heat-exchange. Absorption <b>heat-exchange</b> <b>units</b> are set up in thermal station to lower temperature of water in heat network to about 20 °C. The return water is heated orderly by gas-water heat exchanger, absorption heat pump and the peak load heater. Compared with the traditional systems, this system runs with a greater circuit temperature drop so that the delivery capacity of the heat network increases dramatically. The heating capacity and the energy efficiency of the cogeneration plant is increased by the exhausted heat recovery from the flue gas. Finally, this paper has analyzed the advantages on energy-saving benefit, environmental benefit and economic benefit by one example that a gas cogeneration plant is reformed using the technology...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{contains}} {{analysis of}} natural and technogenic factors influencing properties of mine atmosphere, defining level of mining safety and probability of emergencies. Main trends in development of energy-saving technologies providing comfortable microclimate conditions are highlighted. A complex of methods and mathematical models has been developed to carry out aerologic and thermophysical calculations. Main ways of improvement for existing calculation methods of stationary and non-stationary air distribution have been defined: use of ejection draught sources to organize recirculation ventilation; accounting of depression losses at working intersections; inertance impact of  air streams and mined-out spaces for modeling transitory emergency scenarios. Based on the calculation algorithm of airflow rate distribution in the mine network, processing method has been developed {{for the results of}} air-depressive surveys under conditions of data shortage. Processes of dust transfer have been modeled in view of its coagulation and settlement, as well as interaction with water drops in case of wet dust prevention. A method to calculate intensity of water evaporation and condensation has been suggested, which allows to forecast time, duration and quantity of precipitation and its migration inside the mine during winter season. Solving the problem of heat exchange between mine airflow and timbering of the ventilation shaft in a conjugation formulation permits to estimate depression value of natural draught and conditions of convective balance between air streams. Normalization of microclimatic parameters for mine atmosphere is forecasted for the use of <b>heat-exchange</b> <b>units</b> either heating or cooling and dehumidifying ventilation air. Algorithms are presented that permit to minimize ventilation energy demands at the stages of mine design and exploitation...|$|E
40|$|The {{toxicological}} {{assessments of}} grab sample canisters (GSCs) returned aboard STS-l 13 and Soyuz 5 are reported. Analytical methods {{have not changed}} from earlier reports. Surrogate standard recoveries from the GSCs were 79 - 120 % except {{as noted in the}} table. One sample was returned with the valve opened. The two general criteria used to assess air quality are the total-non-methane-volatile organic hydrocarbons (NMVOCs) and the total T-value (minus the CO 2 and formaldehyde contributions). Control of atmospheric alcohols is important to the water recovery system engineers, hence total alcohols (including acetone) are also shown for each sample. Octafluoropropane (OFP) has leaked from <b>heat-exchange</b> <b>units</b> in large quantities, so its concentration is tracked separately. Because formaldehyde is quantified from sorbent badges, its concentration is also listed separately. The table shows that the air quality in general was acceptable for crew respiration through the middle of December 2002. No conclusions can be made about the air quality after that date due to NASA's inability to return air samples from the ISS. Alcohols are not being controlled to the recently lowered guideline of 5 mg/m 3, which was recommended to protect the water recovery systems. The airlock sample was taken during the regeneration of Met ox canisters in the adjacent Node. The trace pollutants were not increased above background; however, inspection of table 1 in the appendix shows a CO 2 concentration of 17, 000 mg/cu m, which is a relatively high concentration, but still below the 24 -hour SMAC of 23, 000 mg/cu m. The control of OFP continues to be adequate at least through December 2002. Formaldehyde concentrations suggest that the high levels that were being found in the Lab atmosphere have subsided. This is probably attributable to the restoration of IMV in early February 2003. Before the obstructing material was removed from ducts the Lab formaldehyde concentrations approached 0. 06 mg/cu m, whereas after the repair the levels were near 0. 04 mg/m 3. This does not mean that local sources in the Lab have been reduced, only that the excess of formaldehyde produced in the Lab is distributed into the whole volume of the ISS...|$|E

Aiming at {{the application of}} such heat exchanger in an air-handling unit, restriction conditions are given for the minimum <b>heat-exchanging</b> <b>unit</b> {{in accordance with the}} requirement of control precision of indoor temperature and humidity. The structure adjustable heat exchanger improved the hydraulic adjusting characteristics of existing air handling units in the respective structure, and overcame the problems of existing air-handling units such as a narrow hydraulic adjusting range due to the rapid-opening performance of the continuous motor-driven value. As a result, such kind of heat exchanger is extremely suitable to fuzzy control...|$|R
40|$|The {{object of}} investigation: the {{collision}} {{process and the}} field of welding of metal plates made from titanium and steel with their explosive load by the ammonium-potassium nitrate mixed ES {{on the base of}} ammonites 6 ZHY, AT-I, A- 2 G. The purpose of the work: the development of the scientifically grounded technology of welding by the explosion of the large-dimension sheet bimetal titanium+steel on the base of studying the influence of phase of acceleration of the plate to be thrown {{on the quality of the}} welding joint and creating the design of the rational welding conditions by the explosion. The methods of design of the welding conditions by the explosion of materials to be hard-welded have been developed. It has been shown, that for welding by the explosion of the large-dimensional blanks, the value of the peak residual pressure of the detonation products shall be used as the additive parameter of the process. Developed and introduced in the production have been the technologies of welding by the explosion of the large-dimensional sheet bimetals, which have been used for manufacture of the different parts and assemblies of the <b>heat-exchange</b> and electrolysis <b>units.</b> The new technological methods allowing to receive the high-quality items have been developed. The developed design methods of the welding conditions have allowed to operatively decide the questions on obtaining the defectless large-dimensional bimetal blanks under the conditions of the minor-series production. The results have been introduced in the Production Association "Uralschimmash" for the manufacture of the blanks of the chemical machine construction items.
