2500|$|A DNA {{microarray}} (also {{commonly known}} as <b>DNA</b> <b>chip</b> or biochip) {{is a collection of}} microscopic DNA spots attached to a solid surface. Scientists use DNA microarrays to measure the expression levels of large numbers of genes simultaneously or to genotype multiple regions of a genome. Each DNA spot contains picomoles (10−12 moles) of a specific DNA sequence, known as probes (or reporters or oligos). These can be a short section of a gene or other DNA element that are used to hybridize a cDNA or cRNA (also called anti-sense RNA) [...] sample (called target) under high-stringency conditions. Probe-target hybridization is usually detected and quantified by detection of fluorophore-, silver-, or chemiluminescence-labeled targets to determine relative abundance of nucleic acid sequences in the target. The original nucleic acid arrays were macro arrays approximately 9cm × 12cm and the first computerized image based analysis was published in 1981.|$|E

Oligonucleotide probes specific for these polymorphisms were designed and printed on the poly-lysine coated slides to prepare the <b>DNA</b> <b>chip.</b> PCR products from the Fritillaria species were labeled with fluorescence by incorporation of dye-labeled dideoxyribonucleotides and hybridized to the immobilized probes on the chip.
