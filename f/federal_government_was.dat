5|$|As Secretary of Administration and Finance, Baker was a main {{architect}} of the Big Dig financing plan. In 1997 the <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> <b>was</b> planning to cut funding for the Big Dig by $300 million per year. The state set up a trust and sold Grant Anticipation Notes (GANs) to investors. The notes were secured by promising future federal highway funds.

5|$|A {{constitutional}} {{convention was}} convened in Salt Lake City on March 8, 1849, {{to work on}} a proposal for federal recognition of a state or territory. The convention resulted in the provisional State of Deseret. Deseret claimed most of present-day Utah, Nevada and Arizona, with parts of California, Colorado, Idaho, New Mexico, Oregon, and Wyoming. Brigham Young was elected governor on March 12, 1849, and the legislature first met on July 2, 1849. The state, having never been recognized by the <b>federal</b> <b>government,</b> <b>was</b> formally dissolved on April 5, 1851, several months after word of the creation of Utah Territory reached Salt Lake City.|$|E
5|$|American Continental went {{bankrupt}} in April 1989, and Lincoln {{was seized by}} the FHLBB on April 14, 1989. About 23,000 customers were left with worthless bonds.

The total bondholder loss came to between $250 million and $288 million.

5|$|Another {{major concern}} of the Shelby {{administration}} was free navigation on the Mississippi River, which was vital to the state's economic interests. For political reasons the Spanish had closed the port at New Orleans to the Americans. This {{would have been the}} natural market for the tobacco, flour and hemp grown by Kentucky farmers; overland routes were too expensive to be profitable. This made it difficult for land speculators to entice immigration to the area to turn a profit on their investments. Many Kentuckians felt the <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> <b>was</b> not acting decisively or quickly enough to remedy this situation.|$|E
5|$|At that time, the <b>Federal</b> <b>government</b> <b>was</b> subsidizing oil prices, {{driving the}} price up from $.35 a barrel in 1862 to {{as high as}} $13.75. This created an oil-drilling glut, with {{thousands}} of speculators attempting to make their fortunes. Most failed, but those who struck oil did not even need to be efficient. They would blow holes {{in the ground and}} gather up the oil as they could, often leading to creeks and rivers flowing with wasted oil in the place of water.|$|E

The <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> <b>was</b> the largest source of funding, with grants from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council and the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council amounting to about one-third of the research budget. About eight percent of research funding came from corporations, mostly in the healthcare industry.|$|E

5|$|The {{collapse}} {{focused attention}} on the Harper government's cancellation of the Joint Emergency Preparedness Program, which provides funds to Canada's five HUSAR teams. The province and the National Fire Protection Association denounced the cuts. The Canadian Centre for Emergency Preparedness suggested that such cuts would necessitate Canada asking for assistance from the United States in similar situations. Also cancelled by the Conservative <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> <b>was</b> the Canadian Emergency Management College, established in 1954 to train first responders. A spokesperson for Public Safety Minister Vic Toews deflected criticism of the cuts, noting that 90 per cent of emergencies are managed municipally or provincially.|$|E
5|$|The <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> <b>was</b> {{initially}} lauded for its {{swift and}} thorough preparation to which most observers, including the United Nations, attributed Dean's low death toll.

Members of President Felipe Calder√≥n's Partido Accion Nacional (PAN) distributed bags of bread, funded by the nation's disaster relief coffers, carrying the party's logo. In Veracruz Governor Fidel Herrera was accused by both the PAN and his own Partido Revolucionario Institucional (PRI) of using state resources, including hurricane relief, to support the campaigns of PRI candidates.|$|E
5|$|Britain {{recognized}} {{the independence of}} the United States following their defeat at Yorktown in 1781. In the peace treaty of 1783, American sovereignty was recognized from the Atlantic coast west to the Mississippi River. Nationalists led the Philadelphia Convention of 1787 in writing the United States Constitution, ratified in state conventions in 1788. The <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> <b>was</b> reorganized into three branches, on the principle of creating salutary checks and balances, in 1789. George Washington, who had led the revolutionary army to victory, was the first president elected under the new constitution. The Bill of Rights, forbidding federal restriction of personal freedoms and guaranteeing a range of legal protections, was adopted in 1791.|$|E

5|$|By mid-1841, {{the federal}} {{government}} faced a projected budget deficit of $11 million. Tyler recognized the need for higher tariffs, but wished {{to stay within the}} 20 percent rate created by the 1833 Compromise Tariff. He also supported a plan to distribute to the states any revenue from the sales of public land, as an emergency measure to manage the states' growing debt, even though this would cut federal revenue. The Whigs supported high protectionist tariffs and national funding of state infrastructure, and so there was enough overlap to forge a compromise. The Distribution Act of 1841 created a distribution program, with a ceiling on tariffs at 20 percent; a second bill increased tariffs to that figure on previously low-tax goods. Despite these measures, by March 1842 it had become clear that the <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> <b>was</b> still in dire fiscal straits.|$|E
5|$|During Harper's tenure, Canada had {{budgetary}} surpluses from 2006 to 2008 of $13.8 and 9.6 billion respectively. Following the 2008 financial crisis, Canada ran deficits from 2009-2013. The {{deficit was}} $55.6 billion in 2009 and was gradually lowered to $5.2 billion in 2013. In 2014, {{the federal budget}} was balanced with a surplus of $1.9 billion. For the first 11 months of 2015, the <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> <b>was</b> on track for a $7.5 billion surplus. Following the 2015 federal election and a change in government, the 2015 fiscal year ended in a $1 billion deficit instead. In 2010, Canada had the lowest debt-to-GDP ratio in the G7 economies. The Economist magazine stated that Canada had come out the recession stronger than any other rich country in the G7. In 2013, Canada came out with Global Markets Action Plan to generate employment opportunities for Canadians.|$|E
5|$|MIT {{was elected}} to the Association of American Universities in 1934 and remains a {{research}} university with a very high level of research activity; research expenditures totaled $718.2 million in 2009.

MIT employs approximately 1300 researchers in addition to faculty. In 2011, MIT faculty and researchers disclosed 632 inventions, were issued 153 patents, earned $85.4 million in cash income, and received $69.6 million in royalties. Through programs like the Deshpande Center, MIT faculty leverage their research and discoveries into multi-million-dollar commercial ventures.|$|E

5|$|Site {{preparation}} for L'Enfant promenade and plaza began in November 1965. Air rights over 9th Street SW were granted for a rent of $500 {{per year for}} 99 years on November 23, 1965. The actual groundbreaking for L'Enfant Plaza occurred on December 9 but the project was still hindered by delays. The <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> <b>was</b> building the James V. Forrestal Building at {{the northern end of}} L'Enfant promenade, and the whole northern end of the promenade and the associated roadway was a year behind its construction schedule by June 1967. Meanwhile, over-optimistic construction schedules and labor shortages meant L'Enfant Plaza Corp's building of the North and South buildings were six months behind projected schedules. The $23 million complex neared completion in January 1968, and the office buildings, plaza, and promenade opened to the public and businesses in June 1968. The plaza was formally dedicated on Saturday, November 16, 1968.|$|E

The TFG is allied with the Islamic Courts Union and the Alliance for the Re-liberation of Somalia, and is backed by the United States, the United Nations and the African Union. Its forces are fighting to quell the ongoing insurgency in Somalia and are attempting to gain control of the southern half of the country, as the northern regions are both autonomous and comparatively stable. As a truce, in March 2009, Somalia's newly established coalition government announced that it would implement shari'a as the nation's official judicial system.|$|E
