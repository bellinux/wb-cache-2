SeAl essentially consists of a monitoring/accounting subsystem, an auditing/verification subsystem, and incentive mechanisms.

40|$|Text {{mining and}} search have become {{important}} research areas {{over the past}} few years, mostly due to the large popularity of the Web. A natural extension for these technologies is the development of methods for exploring the geographic context of Web information. Human information needs often present specific geographic constraints. Many Web documents also refer to speci c locations. However, relatively little e ort has been spent on developing the facilities required for geographic access to unstructured textual information. Geographically aware text mining and search remain relatively unexplored. This thesis addresses this new area, arguing that Web text mining can be applied to extract geographic context information, and that this information can be explored for information retrieval. Fundamental questions investigated include handling geographic references in text, assigning geographic scopes to the documents, and building retrieval applications that handle/use geographic scopes. The thesis presents appropriate solutions for each of these challenges, together with a comprehensive evaluation of their efectiveness.

40|$|Flora S. Bacelar [...] . et al. Angiogenesis is {{acknowledged}} {{as an essential}} mechanism for tumor spreading and metastasis of neoplastic diseases. Consequently, anti-angiogenic therapy has been proposed as a complementary or perhaps an alternative strategy to the traditional cytotoxic therapies. This work considers a model of ordinary di®erential equations that describe the dynamics of tumors at the vascular stage (after the angiogenic process has been triggered), under the action of chemical and anti-angiogenic ther- apies. Due to the increase of endothelial cells at the vascular stage, the cancer state prevails over the internal state in the no treatment situation. Results from the lo- cal stability analysis and numerical integration, indicate {{that the combination of}} chemotherapy and anti-angiogenic therapy is the best strategy to eliminate the tu- mor, reducing the cytotoxic e®ect. At a ¯xed infusion rate, the cure state may be reached when the combined therapy is considered but not for the anti-angiogenic therapy only. On the other hand, pure chemotherapy <b>efectively</b> destroys the tumor, but only when higher infusion doses are applied.
