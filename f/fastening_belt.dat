The narrating individual “I” in the poet’s verses, and the universal or plural “I” is a constancy that permeats al-Qasim’s lyrics. Besides the <b>fastened</b> <b>belt</b> strongly ties up his Palestinian soul to its soil.

5000|$|Standards and Double Standards is an {{interactive}} installation {{that consists of}} 10 to 100 <b>fastened</b> <b>belts</b> that are suspended at waist height from stepper motors on {{the ceiling of the}} exhibition room. Controlled by a computerized tracking system, the belts rotate automatically to follow the public, turning their buckles slowly to face passers-by. When several people are in the room, their presence affects the entire group of belts, creating chaotic patterns of interference. Non-linear behaviours emerge such as turbulence, eddies, and relatively quiet regions. One of the aims of this piece is to visualize complex dynamics, turning a condition of pure surveillance into an unpredictable connective system. The piece creates an [...] "absent crowd" [...] using a fetish of paternal authority: the belt.|$|R

50|$|In North America, cars sold {{since the}} early 1970s have {{included}} an audiovisual reminder system consisting of a tell-tale light on the dashboard and a buzzer or chime reminding the driver and passengers to <b>fasten</b> their <b>belts.</b> Originally, these lights were accompanied by a warning buzzer whenever the transmission was in any position except park if either the driver was not buckled up or, as determined by a pressure sensor in the passenger's seat, {{if there was a}} passenger there not buckled up. However, this was {{considered by many to be}} a major annoyance, as the light would be on and the buzzer would sound continuously if front-seat passengers were not buckled up. Therefore, people who did not wish to buckle up would defeat this system by <b>fastening</b> the seat <b>belts</b> with the seat empty and leaving them that way.|$|R

50|$|Latches in seatbelts {{typically}} <b>fasten</b> the <b>belt</b> which constrains {{the occupant}} {{to the body}} of the car. Particularly in rear seats slightly different latches may be used for each seat in order to prevent adjacent seatbelts from being attached to the wrong point. Inertial seatbelt release is a potential circumstance where, in a collision, the seatbelt latch can unintentionally come loose leading to potential injury of the passenger. An additional risk of seatbelt latches is that in some cases the occupant may believe the latch is secure (e.g., by hearing a characteristic click) when in fact it has not.|$|R

The winner is the person who lasts the longest.|$|R
