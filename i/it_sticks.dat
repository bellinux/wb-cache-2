5|$|The melampittas are insectivores, {{although}} {{in the case of}} the greater melampitta, this statement is inference as their diet isn't described. All that is known is that <b>it</b> <b>sticks</b> to the ground and understory. The lesser melampitta feeds on insects as well as worms, snails, small frogs and even small fruit. It forages on the ground, probing through leaves by flipping them with its bill.|$|E
5|$|Targets for NIF are {{extremely}} expensive. Each one {{consists of a}} small open ended metal cylinder with transparent double-pane windows sealing each end. In order to efficiently convert the driver laser's light to the x-rays that drive the compression, the cylinder has to be coated in gold or other heavy metals. Inside, suspended on fine plastic wires, is a hollow plastic sphere containing the fuel. In order to provide symmetrical implosion, the metal cylinder and plastic sphere have extremely high machining tolerances. The fuel, normally a gas at room temperature, is deposited inside the sphere and then cryogenically frozen until <b>it</b> <b>sticks</b> {{to the inside of}} the sphere. It is then smoothed by slowly warming it with an infrared laser to form a 100µm smooth layer on the inside of the pellet. Each target costs tens of thousands of dollars.|$|E

In January 1982 Richard Burton had his private aeroplane fly Lowe to film a cameo role in the television series Wagner, his last screen performance.|$|E

25|$|Magnesium {{chloride}} is used {{in three}} ways for pavement ice control: Anti-icing, when maintenance professionals spread it onto roads before a snow storm to prevent snow from sticking and ice from forming; pre-wetting, which means a liquid formulation of magnesium chloride is sprayed directly onto salt as it is being spread onto roadway pavement, wetting the salt so that <b>it</b> <b>sticks</b> to the road; and pre-treating, when magnesium chloride and salt are mixed together before they are loaded onto trucks and spread onto paved roads.|$|E
25|$|Many webs span {{gaps between}} objects which the spider could not cross by crawling. This {{is done by}} first {{producing}} a fine adhesive thread to drift on a faint breeze across a gap. When <b>it</b> <b>sticks</b> to a surface at the far end, the spider feels {{the change in the}} vibration. The spider reels in and tightens the first strand, then carefully walks along it and strengthens it with a second thread. This process is repeated until the thread is strong enough to support the rest of the web.|$|E
25|$|The {{photoreceptor}} ribbon synapse {{is around}} 30nm in thickness. <b>It</b> <b>sticks</b> {{out into the}} cytoplasm around 200-1000nm and anchors along its base to the arciform density which is an electron dense structure that is anchored to the presynaptic membrane. The arciform density is located within the synaptic ridge, a small evagination of the presynaptic membrane. Hair cells lack an arciform density so the anchor of this ribbon {{is considered to be}} invisible by electron microscope. The ribbon’s surface has small particles that are around 5nm wide where the synaptic vesicles tether densely via fine protein filaments. There are multiple filaments per vesicle. There are also voltage gated L-type calcium channels on the docking sites of the ribbon synapse which trigger neurotransmitter release. Specifically, ribbon synapses contain specialized organelles called synaptic ribbons, which are large presynaptic structures associated in the active zone. They are thought to fine-tune the synaptic vesicle cycle. Synaptic ribbons are in close proximity to synaptic vesicles, which, in turn, are close to the presynaptic neurotransmitter release site via the ribbon.|$|E

500|$|Lyrically, Aguilera compares {{her love}} to office equipment, from paperclips to rubber-bands, {{as a metaphor}} for a relationship.

The part [...] "If I was a ruler I'd try to set you straight, but your love is like a sharpener, it really grates" [...] was praised by several critics, while the lines [...] "A rubber band was an analogy, you can even say it's a metaphor" [...] were {{described}} by others as unnecessary, with Becky Bain for Idolator calling it [...] "dumber-than-dumb".

500|$|Nolan {{has denied}} the film criticizes the Occupy {{movement}} and insists {{that none of}} his Batman films are intended to be political: [...] "I've had as many conversations {{with people who have}} seen the film the other way round.

What we're really trying to do is show the cracks of society, show the conflicts that somebody would try to wedge open. We're going to get wildly different interpretations of what the film is supporting and not supporting, but it's not doing any of those things. It's just telling a story. If you're saying, 'Have you made a film that's supposed to be criticizing the Occupy Wall Street movement?' – well, obviously, that's not true." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1982 Le Mesurier reprised {{the role}} of Arthur Wilson for <b>It</b> <b>Sticks</b> Out Half a Mile, a radio sequel to Dad's Army, in which Wilson had become bank manager of the Frambourne-on-Sea branch, while Arthur Lowe's character, Captain George Mainwaring, was trying {{to apply for a}} loan to {{renovate}} the local pier. The death of Lowe in April 1982 meant that only a pilot episode was recorded, and the project was suspended. It was revived in 1982 with Lowe's role replaced by two other Dad's Army cast members: Pike, played by Ian Lavender, and Hodges, played by Bill Pertwee. A pilot and twelve episodes were subsequently recorded, and broadcast in 1984. Le Mesurier also teamed up with another ex-Dad's Army colleague, Clive Dunn, to record a novelty single, [...] "There Ain't Much Change from a Pound These Days"/"After All These Years", which had been written by Le Mesurier's stepson, David Malin. The single was released on KA Records in 1982.|$|E
500|$|In late 1997, Hole {{released}} a compilation album, My Body, the Hand Grenade, featuring rare singles and B-sides, and an EP titled The First Session {{which consisted of}} the band's first recording session in 1990. In September 1998, Hole released their third studio album, Celebrity Skin, which marked something of a transformation for Love, featuring a stark power pop sound {{as opposed to the}} group's earlier punk rock influences. Love divulged her ambition of making an album where [...] "art meets commerce... there are no compromises made, it has commercial appeal, and <b>it</b> <b>sticks</b> to [...] original vision." [...] She said she was influenced by Neil Young, Fleetwood Mac, and My Bloody Valentine when writing the album. The Smashing Pumpkins' Billy Corgan helped co-write several songs on the album. Celebrity Skin was well received by critics; Rolling Stone called the album [...] "accessible, fiery and intimate—often at the same time... a basic guitar record that's anything but basic". Celebrity Skin went multi-platinum, and topped [...] "Best of Year" [...] lists at Spin and The Village Voice. The album garnered the band their only No.1 hit single on the Modern Rock Tracks chart with the title track [...] "Celebrity Skin". The band promoted the album through MTV performances and at the 1998 Billboard Music Awards.|$|E

500|$|Critics have {{sometimes}} struggled {{to define the}} immense public appreciation for the film. In an interview, Freeman said, [...] "About everywhere you go, people say, The Shawshank Redemption—greatest movie I ever saw [...] " [...] and that such praise [...] "Just comes out of them". Robbins said, [...] "I swear to God, all over the world—all over the world—wherever I go, {{there are people who}} say, 'That movie changed my life' ". In a separate interview, Stephen King said, [...] "If that isn't the best , it's one of the two or three best, and certainly, in moviegoers' minds, it's probably the best because it generally rates at the top of these surveys they have of movies. ... I never expected anything to happen with it." [...] In a 2014 Variety article, Robbins claimed that South African politician Nelson Mandela told him about his love for the film, while it has been cited as a source of inspiration by several sportsmen including Jonny Wilkinson (UK), Agustín Pichot (Argentina), Al Charron (Canada), and Dan Lyle (USA), and Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York. Gunton said he had encountered fans in Morocco, Australia, South America, Germany, France, and Bora Bora. Director Steven Spielberg said that the film was [...] "a chewing-gum movie—if you step on it, <b>it</b> <b>sticks</b> to your shoe".|$|E
500|$|In {{his review}} of [...] "The Food Wife", HitFix's Alan Sepinwall commended it for [...] "stay true to the characters. Of course the kids would {{consider}} Homer to be the fun dad on those occasions when he's actually making an effort, and of course Marge would feel jealous of this. And if she goes too far in trying to keep this as her special thing, she also recognizes it immediately, feels guilty throughout the meal and then heads off to save the day, complete with a great homage to the climax of Ratatouille." [...] Sepinwall also praised the episode for being [...] "packed with great jokes", such as Heidecker and Wareheim's hip hop song and the scenes at the video game convention where the screen turns into a first-person shooter game. Similarly, Haydens Childs of The A.V. Club praised the episode as [...] "funny and well-observed", giving it a B+ grade, and cited the hip hop song as {{the highlight of the}} episode. He also praised Bourdain, Batali, and Ramsay, and stated that he wished Bourdain would have gotten a bigger part in the episode. Childs further wrote that [...] "The best thing about this episode is that it doesn’t try to stuff any outlandish plot mechanics or out-of-character character moments down the viewers’ throats. <b>It</b> <b>sticks</b> to the basics: the family dynamic combined with gentle mocking of a still-current fad. I say 'still-current' because although it is probably true that food blogging is a bit past its expiration date in some cities, I don’t think that it has been overdone everywhere." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Vig, Not Your Kind of People evokes ambient vibes of Garbage's {{first two}} albums, Garbage and Version 2.0: [...] "There's lots of {{elements}} of things we've always loved: noisy guitars, big electronic beats, atmospheric film moments", {{adding that the}} band [...] "wanted to make a record sound like something {{that we want to}} hear when we're driving the car." [...] While the record was reminiscent [...] "vibe-wise" [...] of the band's early work, the production aimed for a rawer sound, instead of cleaning up the sound through computers, to [...] "capture a performance" [...] and [...] "sound kind of trashy and for the songs to blow out a little bit." [...] Vig said, [...] "we tried to leave a lot of the performance raw on this album. A lot of the songs, we sort of throw paint at the wall and some of <b>it</b> <b>sticks</b> and some of it drips off." [...] He explained that the group avoided reinventing themselves: [...] "We wanted to just embrace exactly who we are and what we like to do and just sort of update it sonically for 2012. For better or worse, when we approach a song, it's going to end up sounding like Garbage. I think we have a strong sonic identity, and I think that's an asset these days." [...] Manson similarly noted that what mattered most was the record sounding authentic to who they are as a band. Manson considered that while the record recalled the band's classic sound [...] "it fits in with radio programming right now"; She said that they are interested in also reaching a new generation and, regarding their distinct sound, [...] "We don't sound like anyone else on the radio. Much to our surprise there hasn't been another band like ours since we came off the road." ...|$|E

500|$|Clarkson {{continued}} feuding with Tedder in 2010. In December 2009, Tedder {{said that}} he was no longer angry over the accusations Clarkson made, but warned, [...] "fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me. [...] I don't wanna get some crazy-ass backlash or get my head snapped off for writing a hit song." [...] He later told The Denver Post that he had gotten over the situation and is working on new material for Clarkson's fifth album. Clarkson, however, told the Daily Star that she is writing and recording new songs with new, low-profile producers. [...] "I don’t like working with people who have worked with everyone. Sometimes I get blackmailed into doing so by my label," [...] she said, [...] "but I prefer collaborating with people who aren't on the grid. I don’t want to sound exactly like other people's records." [...] In May, an unreleased electro-pop song by Clarkson called [...] "Wash, Rinse, Repeat" [...] was leaked on the Internet. The song contains auto tuned lyrics that Idolator say are likely written about Tedder: [...] "I can't take the pressure of new. Give me old, rip it off. / Let's see if <b>it</b> <b>sticks</b> to the wall again. / Does it sound familiar? Does it linger in your ear? / Like something you remember from just last year?" [...] and [...] "Music from the past, from the present, well, just last week / We will change a note and get away with it, wait and see." [...] Tedder {{said that he}} thinks the song was written about him, too, but admitted he likes the song. [...] "I think Kelly speaks her mind regardless of anything.

500|$|Reviews for 1984 were {{generally}} favorable. Robert Christgau rated the album a B+.

[...] He also called side two [...] "consolation for their loyal fans—a little sexism, a lot of pyrotechnics, and a standard HM bass attack on something called 'House of Pain'." [...] J.D. Considine, a reviewer for Rolling Stone, rated 1984 {{four out of five}} stars. He called it [...] "the album that brings all of Van Halen's talent into focus." [...] He stated that [...] ""Jump" [...] is not exactly the kind of song you'd expect from Van Halen", but that [...] "once Alex Van Halen's drums kick in and singer David Lee Roth starts to unravel a typically convoluted story line, things start sounding a little more familiar". Although he mentioned [...] "Jump" [...] as having [...] "suspended chords and a pedalpoint bass in a manner more suited to Asia", he went on to state that [...] "Eddie Van Halen manages to expand his repertoire of hot licks, growls, screams and seemingly impossible runs to wilder frontiers than you could have imagined." [...] He concluded that [...] "what really makes this record work is the fact that Van Halen uses all this flash as a means to an end—driving the melody home—rather than as an end in itself" [...] and that [...] "despite all the bluster, Van Halen is one of the smartest, toughest bands in rock & roll. Believe me, that's no newspeak." ...|$|E
