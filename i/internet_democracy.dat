Methodology [...] Chapter Six. Results [...] Chapter Seven. Analysis and {{discussion}} [...] Chapter Eight. Conclusion. The popularity {{and growth of}} numerous online platforms which citizens can use to discuss news and current affairs has become a new area for studies on cyber culture and online journalism. In that context, this study makes enquiries {{into the nature of}} online publics in news websites and their most popular affiliated social network: Facebook. The study refers to the question of genre and its possible role in creating spaces of deliberative communication on the Web, as discussed by Ridell (2005), Dufrasne, M., and Patriarche, G. (2011). The presence of deliberative practices is then observed within discussions which emerged in news genre to reflect on Setala’s (2014) question on the function and outcome of public deliberation in the cyberspace. The thesis argues that public opinions which emerged from discussions on and about news genres should be considered as legitimate reflections of public opinion and therefore a reasonable source for policymakers and analysts for pilot studies and feedback. Recognition of publics which are created in forms of public sphericules or mini-publics is important to reinvigorate discussion on the discourse of <b>internet</b> <b>democracy</b> in the context of participatory internet forums. Recognising the contribution of online publics will lead future research to focus on the implications of the outcomes of these publics in different areas of public policy, politics, social sciences research and public relations. This study investigates the relationship between genres of communication and the emergence of deliberative practices and the formulation of public opinion within six international news websites (BBC World News, the Guardian Global edition, the New York Times Global edition, CNN international, Al Jazeera English and the Washington Post) and their official pages on Facebook.

40|$|Modern {{technologies}} have already changed and will keep changing {{the face of}} communication at large. The intense development of e-communication means and especially Internet builds new communication parameters in society. The virtual sphere benefits the formation of diverse forms and methods of communication for participants while presenting more perfect and effective instruments of interaction and their effect on each other. Thus, at the same time Internet incites intensification of communication processes which result the swift penetration of computer technologies in all spheres of society life. Therefore the global net, while shaping new forms and communication reality, turns to be the most dynamic and technological one and moreover, it becomes nowadays even economical, cultural, social and political phenomenon of present time. Internet is multi-measurable phenomenon which combines different aspects of technical and social nature. That is why it is particularly logical to scrutinize the present effect in the context of its complex conception, where taking into account the latest tendencies, the purpose of Internet is considered to be in the formation of technical mediated communicative process in society. It should be accepted that Internet is the global communication area where mass media has to be considered as separate aspect of virtual environment together with person-to-person communication form, commercial agreements with other course of social life which gradually transfers into the net. It is inherent for Internet to have substantially new distinct features which are not natural for traditional forms of communication and mass media. There are several views among scientists as regards the aforesaid, however, they tend to reckon that determinant features of virtual media are interactivity, hyper-textuality, multi-media, packet communication, synchronism. From the technical point of view Internet makes it possible to create maximum information communication, to extend them indefinitely (multimedia, hyper-textuality); to inform action-oriented audience on the timely basis (synchronism); to have feedback at will and to step out to personal level (interactivity). Undetermined status of net publication permits to publicize information that does not meet format or contest of traditional mass media (packet communication). Familiarization with virtual environment occurs in two directions such as utilization of Internet by the state as new net resource as well as by other users as a factor to form the virtual civil society. Internet grows to everyday practice of objective reality of average Ukrainians. Internet actively builds up its social influence on society and turns to be such a social environment which like barometer reflects social and political situation in the country and determines integration processes in Ukrainian society. Ukrainians consider Internet at present time as potential resource to realize social and civil activity, the resource which makes it possible to impact on power structures and to control power by citizens. Still the social and civil practices in Internet have not become the everyday practice of average Ukrainians. This outcome is caused because of Ukrainians assess their ability too low as regards the impact on power as well as objective reasons of internet technologies development in modern society. The <b>Internet</b> <b>democracy</b> development has still young history of its emerge and social development. E-government, provision of e-services by e-governments, e-interaction of different social objects today, all of those things have just begun to grow and to win out their rights for existing in full value in the society. Undoubtedly, all of those peculiarities affect the special features of citizens’ participation in Internet in modern word.

40|$|The {{number of}} {{internet}} users in Estonia has grown significantly over the years. As {{the usage of}} internet is widespread and the popularity of e-voting is increasing the political parties are realizing more and more that {{a part of their}} electorate is actively using internet and spends much of their time online. Different companies and organizations have created opportunities for their clients or citizens to communicate with them online. Political parties have done the same. Parties have their own websites, some of them even several sites. Each party who plays a role in e-scene and has enough self respect has information about upcoming election and central issues on their website. Candidates have their own blogs and in some cases, if the blogger is more active, live discussions are going on in the commentaries. Social networking opportunities useful for campaigning are explored before the elections. Are these opportunities just one-sided or is feedback and participation expected? The main aim of the thesis „Internet use in election campaigns 2005 – 2009 ” is to study whether and how the political parties use the opportunities of participatory and deliberative democracy in election campaigns through their websites. The concept of internet as idealistic public sphere describes it as a place where free deliberation leads to perfect discussion and where to realize the opportunities that participatory democracy provides. Participatory and deliberative democracies are main concepts which help to create the theoretical bases as internet is carrying the idea of ideal participation in itself. Theoretical part of the thesis discusses the importance of internet campaigning and the growing importance of it and whether it helps to raise the quality of the campaign or are possibilities of political marketing used only to catch the attention of internet users as potential voters. The existence of opportunities may not mean that there is conceptual change in campaign quality although the terms “participatory and deliberative democracies” {{are becoming more and more}} common among people. Classical marketing mix can help to reach wider target groups. There is a concern that the use of participation opportunities may not serve the set purposes as the opposition party may start to use it for their own goals. 87 Participatory democracy is often seen as a solution and a chance to keep the electorate active. Citizens have the opportunity to cooperate. More web environments offer a chance for visitors to create their own content. Here a big opportunity is seen for specific or narrow target groups. Taking all the assumptions into account, not all theorists are convinced by the ideality of the internet and it is pointed out that rapidly developed public sphere does not automatically guarantee democracy. Once again questions arise – what motivates the participant and on which topics would the participant agree to discuss and express opinion? The changes concerning the development Estonian e-society and the spread of the internet are described briefly as well. Politics can also be perceived as a forum or as a market. Bearing in mind the stages of development of <b>internet</b> <b>democracy,</b> the term of “consumer democracy” is described that is directly linked to political marketing. Consumer democracy means that tailored services are offered to citizens, but at the same time there is no space for discussion or wider deliberation. This is replaced by a relationship which is similar to a market-consumer relationship model. Focusing on a consumer or a client and knowing certain target groups will provide a significant advantage during the elections. Theorists point out that internet gives an opportunity for participation and political parties have more or less realized that. Optimists hope that ideally the communication between citizen and the state will become easier. Pessimists find that web offers only good opportunities for electronic propaganda. The degree of participation in political websites in Estonian context is very different. Some see it as an obligation, for some it is a great opportunity. Some have chosen a strategy that concentrates on web marketing, but there is a long way to participation. Others also offer possibilities to participate during the campaigns. We assume that we can take over all the positive characteristics of the internet that will improve the campaign substantially. Although it might mean more political commercials and online marketing activities. The empirical part of this thesis is based on data gathered from monitoring the development of political parties’ websites during 2005 – 2009 (only parties which are present at the Parliament are represented). Eight interviews with e-democracy expert, party representatives as customers administrating their web sites and web marketing expert were conducted. Estonian parties consider, at least judging from their websites that their potential voter is an internet user. However it seems that internet users profiles and its change in time is taken into account. For example comparing the web sites in the years 2005 – 2007 it is clear that some sites are more static and only most important information is presented in very laconic way. At the same time other part of webs are more attractive and interactive, also more activities are offered to visitor so that they would spend more time on their website. It is a pleasure to see that websites offer more participation opportunities, even if these are mixed with entertainment and just spending time. Web is changed and most certainly the terms social networking and interactivity have become more important during election campaigns in the short run. It must be admitted that it is also complicated to regulate the web and the upcoming elections will present a real cyber battle of campaigns. Assuming that internet only takes over the possibilities of participatory democracy we would like to address the negative campaigning which is also moving online rapidly. Taking a look at the impact of internet to democracy we cannot yet speak about electronic glut – there is much space to develop further...|$|E
40|$|The {{relationship}} between the <b>Internet</b> and <b>democracy</b> has been a continuing matter of debate for decades. Optimists foresaw new opportunities for accelerating the democratization process, for consolidating and promoting democratic societies, and for facilitating the collapse of authoritarian regimes, maintaining that the Internet is inherently a powerful force for democracy (e. g. Barber, 1998, p. 573 - 589; Hirschkop, 1996, p. 86 - 98). Pessimists lamented the arbitrary manipulation of the Internet by political authorities, who used it to enhance their surveillance capability and controlled its use and appropriation {{in response to a}} fear of political resistance (e. g. Gandy, 1993; Lyon, 2003, p. 67 - 82). Research concerning the <b>Internet</b> and <b>democracy</b> in China mostly concentrated on the government’s censorship system from a top-down perspective, while few studies focus on the meso-level of collectives and organizations, and on the micro-level of individual Internet users. Many scholars mentioned that in China, censorship is often not initiated by the government alone, but is in fact self-censorship by organizations, such as Internet service providers and Internet content providers (e. g. Sinclair, 2002, p. 24; Sohmen, 2001, p. 21 - 22). Therefore, a detailed study of collectives and organizations in terms of their attitudes and implementation of self-censorship is essential to understand the political impact of the Internet in the Chinese context...|$|R

40|$|Possible {{changes of}} {{political}} {{communication in the}} age of the internet and their impact on democracy are the main focus of this dissertation. An interdisciplinary approach is chosen, combining perspectives of media studies and communication sciences as well as public law and political science. The specific research object is the online communication of the parties present in the 17 th legislative session of the German Bundestag and its impact on German democracy. The dissertation begins with theoretical remarks which define basic terms and make the case for the chosen approach. Then the term democracy is examined in the context of the history of political thought and three important theoretical traditions or strands of democracy are presented. Based on these, the effect of theoretical foundations on the assessment of the internet's ‘democratizing’ powers is shown. The argument is made that any analysis of the effects of the <b>internet</b> on <b>democracy</b> should explicitly reveal its understanding of democracy. The dissertation then moves on to introduce the specific notion of democracy encompassed by the German 'constitution', the Basic Law or Grundgesetz. Based on this notion three communicative functions for political parties are extracted from the constitutional order. The final chapters explore how the political parties fulfill these functions and which impact this may have on German democracy. Besides the external online communication of the parties the respective demand by citizens is assessed. The dissertation provides theoretical as well as empirical results. On the level of theory the need for normative evaluation of the impact of the <b>internet</b> on <b>democracy</b> is demonstrated and a corresponding theoretical framework is developed with reference to the German Basic Law. The examination of empirical data of the offerings of parties as well as their use by citizens show that the changes on the supply side of political online communication are greater than those on the supply side. The evaluations of these changes according to the principles of the Basic Law are positive over all, but vary within the functions...|$|R
