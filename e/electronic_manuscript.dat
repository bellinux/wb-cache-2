After a preliminary investigation of all the available <b>electronic</b> <b>manuscripts,</b> the Dhamma Society found that it was necessary to undertake anew the entire proof-reading and editing in Pāḷi language of the International Council Edition, both in printing and electronic formats. In 2004, the development of the electronic Pāḷi Tipiṭaka version was completed and was presented to Her Royal Highness Princess Galyani Vadhana, the Royal Matriarch of Thailand. In 2005, the printing project was finally completed and was published in Latin script in 40 volumes as a homage to the Buddha and in honour of the Buddhist Sovereign Monarchy of Thailand. For an inaugural presentation, HRH Princess Galyani Vadhana, as Honorary President and Royal Patron, led a historic 24-hour Pilgrimage by a special flight from Bangkok to Colombo to present the special inaugural edition as a royal gift of Dhamma to the President of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka on March 6, 2005.

40|$|Abstract This article, {{prepared}} for the 75 th-anniversary issue of Public Opinion Quarterly, observes some trends in the articles {{published in the journal}} from 2002 to 2008 and examines marked shifts brought about by changes in academic publishing. Methodological publication trends include a major focus on nonresponse in sample surveys and mode of survey administration. Trends in substantive articles include a focus on homosexuality and gay rights, on public opinion–policy linkage, and on historical analysis of public opinion. Changes in publishing led to fully <b>electronic</b> <b>manuscript</b> processing and publication, space for supplementary content, and a fully accessible electronic archive con-taining all issues of the journal. These developments and a new AAPOR-publisher relationship enable POQ to better fulfill its mission to advance the field of public opinion research. The content of Public Opinion Quarterly (POQ) from 2002 to 2008 was shaped by what might be called ‘‘routine’ ’ developments in academic disciplines and by unprecedented changes in the world of academic publishing. In the ‘‘routine’’ category, there was continuity in the overall balance of published substantive and methodological articles, but new emphases were evident in both types of papers. In the publishing sphere, changes in technology and business arrange-ments made possible a remarkable expansion of opportunities for readers and contributors. The work of editing issues of POQ was also transformed by the addition of electronic to the traditional print format...|$|E

40|$|Economic agents {{generally}} {{operate in}} uncertain environments and, prior to making decisions, invest {{time and resources}} to collect useful information. Consumers compare the prices charged by di [...] erent firms before purchasing a product. Politicians gather information from di [...] erent sources before implementing a policy. Doctors conduct several tests on patients before subscribing a treatment. Since having access to valuable information requires time, e [...] ort, and often money, a problem typically addressed by economists is how much information a decision-maker should collect before being su [...] - ciently convinced about one state of the world. Implicit in economic models that aim to identify the optimal amount of information to be gathered is the idea that, once information is available, there are no costs involved in interpreting and transmitting it. However there are plausible reasons {{to believe that the}} activity of information processing is far from being perfect. Looking at the quantitative dimension of information, a larger amount of information usually implies that more resources are needed in order to interpret it. In this respect, with the rise of the Internet, the cost of generating and transmitting information has fallen so dramatically that the scarce resource is not anymore information itself, but the attention needed to understand it. For example, the cost of sending an <b>electronic</b> <b>manuscript</b> to a journal is much lower than the opportunity cost of {{the time it takes to}} a referee to read and understand the paper. Modelling explicitly such opportunity costs may shed light on phenomena such as market congestion and information overload. Sinds het baanbrekende werk van Akerlof (1970) is de term ‘informatie’ uitgegroeid tot een essentieel begrip in het economische vocabulaire en is er een hele reeks vervolgonderzoek naar het onderwerp gedaan. Het voornaamste argument dat men tegenwoordig in de literatuur betre [...] ende Akerlof’s paper tegenkomt is, dat economische ine [...] ciëntie (b. v. adverse selection en moral hazard) te wijten zijn aan het gebrek aan informatie.

40|$|On January 11, 2008, the National Institutes of Health ('NIH') {{adopted a}} revised Public Access Policy for peer-reviewed journal {{articles}} reporting research supported {{in whole or}} in part by NIH funds. Under the revised policy, the grantee shall ensure that a copy of the author's final manuscript, including any revisions made during the peer review process, be electronically submitted to the National Library of Medicine's PubMed Central ('PMC') archive and that the person submitting the manuscript will designate a time not later than 12 months after publication at which NIH may make the full text of the manuscript publicly accessible in PMC. NIH adopted this policy to implement a new statutory requirement under which: The Director of the National Institutes of Health shall require that all investigators funded by the NIH submit or have submitted for them to the National Library of Medicine's PubMed Central an electronic version of their final, peer-reviewed manuscripts upon acceptance for publication to be made publicly available no later than 12 months after the official date of publication: Provided, That the NIH shall implement the public access policy in a manner consistent with copyright law. This White Paper is written primarily for policymaking staff in universities and other institutional recipients of NIH support responsible for ensuring compliance with the Public Access Policy. The January 11, 2008, Public Access Policy imposes two new compliance mandates. First, the grantee must ensure proper manuscript submission. The version of the article to be submitted is the final version over which the author has control, which must include all revisions made after peer review. The statutory command directs that the manuscript be submitted to PMC 'upon acceptance for publication. ' That is, the author's final manuscript should be submitted to PMC at the same time that it is sent to the publisher for final formatting and copy editing. Proper submission is a two-stage process. The <b>electronic</b> <b>manuscript</b> must first be submitted through a process that requires input of additional information concerning the article, the author(s), and the nature of NIH support for the research reported. NIH then formats the manuscript into a uniform, XML-based format used for PMC versions of articles. In the second stage of the submission process, NIH sends a notice to the Principal Investigator requesting that the PMC-formatted version be reviewed and approved. Only after such approval has grantee's manuscript submission obligation been satisfied. Second, the grantee also has a distinct obligation to grant NIH copyright permission to make the manuscript publicly accessible through PMC not later than 12 months after the date of publication. This obligation is connected to manuscript submission because the author, or the person submitting the manuscript on the author's behalf, must have the necessary rights under copyright at the time of submission to give NIH the copyright permission it requires. This White Paper explains and analyzes only the scope of the grantee's copyright-related obligations under the revised Public Access Policy and suggests six options for compliance with that aspect of the grantee's obligation. Time is of the essence for NIH grantees. As a practical matter, the grantee should have a compliance process in place no later than April 7, 2008. More specifically, the new Public Access Policy applies to any article accepted for publication on or after April 7, 2008 if the article arose under (1) an NIH Grant or Cooperative Agreement active in Fiscal Year 2008, (2) direct funding from an NIH Contract signed after April 7, 2008, (3) direct funding from the NIH Intramural Program, or (4) from an NIH employee. In addition, effective May 25, 2008, anyone submitting an application, proposal or progress report to the NIH must include the PMC reference number when citing articles arising from their NIH funded research. (This includes applications submitted to the NIH for the May 25, 2008 and subsequent due dates.) Conceptually, the compliance challenge that the Public Access Policy poses for grantees is easily described. The grantee must depend to some extent upon the author(s) to take the necessary actions to ensure that the grantee is in compliance with the Public Access Policy because the electronic manuscripts and the copyrights in those manuscripts are initially under the control of the author(s). As a result, any compliance option will require an explicit understanding between the author(s) and the grantee about how the manuscript and the copyright in the manuscript are managed. It is useful to conceptually keep separate the grantee's manuscript submission obligation from its copyright permission obligation because the compliance personnel concerned with manuscript management may differ from those responsible for overseeing the author's copyright management. With respect to copyright management, the grantee has the following six options: (1) rely on authors to manage copyright but also to request or to require that these authors take responsibility for amending publication agreements that call for transfer of too many rights to enable the author to grant NIH permission to make the manuscript publicly accessible ('the Public Access License'); (2) take a more active role in assisting authors in negotiating the scope of any copyright transfer to a publisher by (a) providing advice to authors concerning their negotiations or (b) by acting as the author's agent in such negotiations; (3) enter into a side agreement with NIH-funded authors that grants a non-exclusive copyright license to the grantee sufficient to grant NIH the Public Access License; (4) enter into a side agreement with NIH-funded authors that grants a non-exclusive copyright license to the grantee sufficient to grant NIH the Public Access License and also grants a license to the grantee to make certain uses of the article, including posting a copy in the grantee's publicly accessible digital archive or repository and authorizing the article to be used in connection with teaching by university faculty; (5) negotiate a more systematic and comprehensive agreement with the biomedical publishers to ensure either that the publisher has a binding obligation to submit the manuscript and to grant NIH permission to make the manuscript publicly accessible or that the author retains sufficient rights to do so; or (6) instruct NIH-funded authors to submit manuscripts only to journals with binding deposit agreements with NIH or to journals whose copyright agreements permit authors to retain sufficient rights to authorize NIH to make manuscripts publicly accessible...|$|E
