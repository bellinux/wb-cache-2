5|$|After {{appearing}} in Bus Stop (1956), Monroe founded her own production company, Marilyn Monroe Productions, in 1955; the company produced one film independently, The Prince and the Showgirl (1957). Monroe then appeared in Some Like <b>It</b> <b>Hot</b> (1959) and The Misfits (1961). She was {{suspended from the}} filming of Something's Got to Give in June 1962, and the film remained uncompleted when she died in August. Although she was a top-billed actress for only a decade, her films grossed $200 million {{by the time of}} her unexpected death in 1962.|$|E
5|$|Jack is {{concerned}} for his mother, Colleen (Elaine Stritch). He tells Liz that {{the anniversary of}} his father, Jimmy Donaghy, abandoning their family is coming up and he is afraid of the effect it will have on Colleen. When Jack arrives at Colleen's hotel room {{to take her to}} dinner, however, he discovers she is staying with a man, Paul. Jack, worried she has been taken in by a con man in her time of grief, asks his private investigator Lenny Wosniak (Steve Buscemi) to look into Paul. Wosniak cannot find anything distasteful in Paul's background, but tells Jack that he is married. Jack reveals this to his mother, but she says she knew and did not care. Colleen is also surprised that Jack thought the anniversary of Jimmy leaving would hurt her, noting that he had once left from the spring of 1957 until he came back and invited her to see Some Like <b>It</b> <b>Hot.</b> Jack talks this over with Liz and comes to realize that as Some Like <b>It</b> <b>Hot</b> was released in 1959, Jimmy Donaghy cannot have been his biological father because Jack was conceived in 1958, during the period Jimmy had been absent.|$|E
5|$|When {{the studio}} was still {{reluctant}} {{to change her}} contract, Monroe founded a film production company in late 1954; she named it Marilyn Monroe Productions (MMP). She dedicated 1955 to building her company and began studying method acting at the Actors Studio. In late 1955, Fox awarded her a new contract, which gave her more control and a larger salary. After a critically acclaimed performance in Bus Stop (1956) and acting in the first independent production of MMP, The Prince and the Showgirl (1957), she won a Golden Globe for Best Actress for Some Like <b>It</b> <b>Hot</b> (1959). Her last completed film was the drama The Misfits (1961).|$|E

5|$|Monroe won, or was {{nominated}} for, several awards during her career. Those she won included the Henrietta Award for Best Young Box Office Personality (1951) and World Film Favorite (1953), and a Crystal Star Award and David di Donatello Award for The Prince and the Showgirl (1958). She was inducted to the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1960 and a Golden Palm Star was dedicated at the Palm Springs Walk of Stars in 1995. In the 1999 American Film Institute's list of AFI's 100 Years...100 Stars, she was ranked as the sixth greatest film star; {{two of the}} films in which she appeared—Some Like <b>It</b> <b>Hot</b> and The Asphalt Jungle—have {{been added to the}} Library of Congress's National Film Registry, and the former earned her a Golden Globe for Best Actress.

It also allows the farrier to make more modifications to the shoe, such as drawing toe- and quarter-clips. The farrier must take care not to hold the hot shoe against the hoof too long, as the heat can damage the hoof.|$|E
500|$|Barbette {{served as}} a {{consultant}} {{on a number of}} films, including the circus sequences for Till the Clouds Roll By (1946) and The Big Circus (1959), and was hired to coach Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis on gender illusion for the film Some Like <b>It</b> <b>Hot</b> (1959). Cocteau biographer Francis Steegmuller wrote a profile of Barbette for The New Yorker in 1969 entitled [...] "An Angel, A Flower, A Bird".

500|$|In the end, Wilder {{was happy}} with Monroe's performance, stating: [...] "Anyone can {{remember}} lines, {{but it takes a}} real artist to come on the set and not know her lines and yet give the performance she did!" [...] Despite the difficulties of its production, Some Like <b>It</b> <b>Hot</b> became a critical and commercial success when it was released in March 1959. Monroe's performance earned her a Golden Globe for Best Actress, and prompted Variety to call her [...] "a comedienne with that combination of sex appeal and timing that just can't be beat". It has been voted one of the best films ever made in polls by the American Film Institute and Sight & Sound.|$|E
500|$|A {{historic}} puzzle {{concerned the}} source of energy that can maintain the optical supernova glow for months. Although the energy that disrupts each type of supernovae is delivered promptly, the light curves are mostly dominated by subsequent radioactive heating of the rapidly expanding ejecta. Some have considered rotational energy from the central pulsar. The ejecta gases would dim quickly without some energy input to keep <b>it</b> <b>hot.</b> The intensely radioactive nature of the ejecta gases, which is now known to be correct for most supernovae, was first calculated on sound nucleosynthesis grounds in the late 1960s. [...] It was not until SN 1987A that direct observation of gamma-ray lines unambiguously identified the major radioactive nuclei.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Catch Me If You Can" [...] was {{directed}} by Toshiyuki Suzuki and features the members dancing in white tank tops and orange uniforms at a construction zone. Jeff Benjamin from American music magazine Billboard described the choreography as [...] "powerful and sexy" [...] and [...] "mind-blowing". He further commented that the members sure [...] "can dance their asses off" [...] and compared the video to Ciara's 2009 music video for [...] "Work" [...] for the same construction zone background and the white tank top look. Similarly, Filipino channel Myx praised the music video's visual, commenting that the group were [...] "keeping <b>it</b> <b>hot</b> with their steamy moves and outfits". In June 2015, {{an earlier version of}} the music video featuring ex-member Jessica was unofficially released onto the Internet.

500|$|After Some Like <b>It</b> <b>Hot,</b> Monroe {{took another}} hiatus until late 1959, when she {{returned}} to Hollywood and starred in the musical comedy Let's Make Love, about an actress and a millionaire who fall in love when performing in a satirical play. She chose George Cukor to direct and Miller re-wrote portions of the script, which she considered weak; she accepted the part solely because she was behind on her contract with Fox, having only made one of four promised films. The film's production was delayed by her frequent absences from the set. She had an affair with Yves Montand, her co-star, which was widely reported by the press and used in the film's publicity campaign. Let's Make Love was unsuccessful upon its release in September 1960; Crowther described Monroe as appearing [...] "rather untidy" [...] and [...] "lacking ... the old Monroe dynamism", and Hedda Hopper called the film [...] "the most vulgar picture she's ever done". Truman Capote lobbied for her to play Holly Golightly in a film adaptation of Breakfast at Tiffany's, but the role went to Audrey Hepburn as its producers feared that Monroe would complicate the production.|$|E
500|$|Monroe {{returned}} to Hollywood in July 1958 to act opposite Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis in Billy Wilder's comedy on gender roles, Some Like <b>It</b> <b>Hot.</b> Although she considered {{the role of}} Sugar Kane another [...] "dumb blonde", she accepted it due to Miller's encouragement and the offer of receiving {{ten percent of the}} film's profits in addition to her standard pay. The difficulties during the film's production have since become [...] "legendary". Monroe would demand dozens of re-takes, and could not remember her lines or act as directed– Curtis famously stated that kissing her was [...] "like kissing Hitler" [...] due to the number of re-takes. Monroe herself privately likened the production to a sinking ship and commented on her co-stars and director saying [...] " [...] why should I worry, I have no phallic symbol to lose." [...] Many of the problems stemmed from a conflict between her and Wilder, who also had a reputation for being difficult, on how she should play the character. Monroe made Wilder angry by asking him to alter many of her scenes, which in turn made her stage fright worse, and it is suggested that she deliberately ruined several scenes to act them her way.|$|E
500|$|Pfeiffer then {{accepted}} {{the role of}} Susie Diamond, a hard-edged former call girl turned lounge singer, in The Fabulous Baker Boys (1989), which co-starred Jeff Bridges and Beau Bridges as the eponymous Baker Boys. She underwent intensive voice training for the role for four months, and performed all of her character's vocals. The film was a modest success, grossing $18.4 million in the US (equivalent to $million in [...] dollars [...] ). Pfeiffer's portrayal of Susie, however, drew rave reviews from critics. Janet Maslin of The New York Times wrote of the performance: [...] "she proves to be electrifyingly right. Introducing Ms. Pfeiffer's furiously hard-boiled, devastatingly gorgeous Susie into the Bakers' world affects the film the way a match might affect a fuse," [...] Fellow critic Roger Ebert compared her to Rita Hayworth in Gilda and to Marilyn Monroe in Some Like <b>It</b> <b>Hot,</b> adding that the film was [...] "one of the movies they will use as a document, years from now, when they begin to trace the steps by which Pfeiffer became a great star." [...] Variety singled out her performance of 'Makin' Whoopee', writing that Pfeiffer [...] "hits the spot in the film's certain-to-be-remembered highlight... crawling all over a piano in a blazing red dress. She's dynamite." ...|$|E
