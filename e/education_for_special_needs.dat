It is suggested that art educators would benefit from at least one course in their pre-service training that specifically addresses art education for students with special needs. This content analysis of pre-service art education programs reveals that 5 of 18 programs studied, (28 %), require such a course, with no other option, to fulfill the special education requirement.

40|$|Despite the {{availability}} of online learning applications and management systems used to deliver, house and organize e-learning content, students learning online continue to struggle with barriers that create an unnecessary disconnect between themselves and their peers, professors, the learning material and their parents (where applicable). Barriers personally experienced through participation in a synchronous online university-level graduate class, and documented barriers experienced by other students in similar distance learning environments, served as the primary narrative and driving incentive for this study. In addition to an extensive literature review, an in-depth study of a distance learning environment was conducted using an adaptation of Smart Designâ��s 6 Real People approach which included 5 personaâ��s, based on 5 real participants; a high school special needs class, a Masters of Inclusive Design Class, the Director of <b>Education</b> <b>for</b> <b>Special</b> <b>Needs,</b> A University Professor of Distance Learning, and a Visually Impaired User (Blind Participant). The usersâ�� experiences were documented through means of ethnographic observations, direct observations, and detailed interviews. Findings from these revealed many barriers and disruptions, including psychological, emotional, social, gender-related, environmental and cultural issues that were detrimental to class involvement and student success. These findings were then synthesized and applied to create a prototype, called inClass, developed to address these barriers and provide {{a model for a}} more cohesive, unified and accessible e-learning solution.

In 2008 reviews were conducted in seven project countries except in Thailand. Some major gaps were identify such as the gap between pre-service teacher education and what follows throughout the teacher's career, {{as well as the}} gap between the best and worst practices of inclusive right-based education in the region. This study aims to identify both the gaps and omissions with regard to the inclusion of human rights, gender equality multilingual mother-tongue-based educational inclusive of marginalized, underprivileged groups, as well as special education, with policies, curricular material and pedagogy of pre-service teacher training institutes in four regions. The study was carried out mainly with qualitative method. The data were obtained from the two parts of data collection: documentary study and analysis of curriculum of sixteen teacher training institutes in four regions. It was found that: 1) the policy analysis revealed that the Ministry of Education launched supporting scheme to strive to Education for All, 2) the pre-service teacher training policy revealed that there was no explicit item related to rights based, opportunities, limitation of students to attend schools, gender promotion, or mother tongue based multilingual education. There were few universities provided clear issues in human rights education, 3) provision of knowledge, formation of attitude, behaviours and skills necessary for a thoroughly understanding and practice of a right-based teaching were integrated into special education and inclusive education courses. All sixteen sampling institutes offered a course or two in Special Education and Inclusive education, and teaching material and pedagogical aspects, stressed issues in <b>education</b> <b>for</b> <b>special</b> <b>needs.</b> In conclusion, every in-service teaching institute provided special education or inclusive education course. It was believed that experiences from the course would help students develop attitude, value and respect toward persons with special needs. As for issues of gender education, human rights education and mother -tongue-based multilingual education, there was still the gap between pre-service teacher education and practical work among school teachers...|$|E

40|$|This {{action plan}} focuses on {{addressing}} {{the educational needs}} of children and young people from disadvantaged communities, from pre-school through second-level education (3 to 18 years).
