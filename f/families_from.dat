5|$|Despite being a {{very weak}} storm, forecasters were wary about Katrina, as Central America was devastated by Hurricane Mitch exactly one year earlier. There was {{considerable}} fear of additional flash flooding and mudslides across the mountainous region. Immediately after being declared a tropical depression, a tropical storm warning was issued for Nicaragua, and it was extended to the San Andrés islands of Colombia shortly afterward. Officials in Honduras evacuated 71 <b>families</b> <b>from</b> the district of Colón and another 17 <b>families</b> <b>from</b> other at-risk areas. Along the coastline of Honduras, a red alert was declared as torrential rains were anticipated to produce deadly mudslides in areas still recovering from Mitch nearly one year ago.|$|E

5|$|By the 16th century, {{control of}} Nakhichevan {{passed to the}} Safavid dynasty of Persia. Because of its {{geographic}} position, it frequently suffered during the earlier wars between Persia and the Ottoman Empire in the 14th to 18th centuries. In 1604–1605, Shah Abbas I, concerned that the lands of Nakhichevan and the surrounding areas could potentially pass into Ottoman hands, decided to institute a scorched earth policy. He forced some 300,000 Armenians, including the Armenian population of Nakhichevan {{to leave their homes}} and move to the Persian provinces south of the Aras River. After the last 1826-1828 Russo-Persian War, Nakhichevan became part of Russia per the Treaty of Turkmenchay after Persia's forced ceding. Alexandr Griboyedov, the Russian envoy to Persia, reported that 1,228 Armenian <b>families</b> <b>from</b> Persia migrated to Nakhichevan, while prior to their migration there were 2,024 Muslim and 404 Armenian families living in the province.|$|E

5|$|Civil service examinations: In the Han Dynasty (202 BC– 220 AD), the xiaolian {{system of}} {{recruiting}} government officials through formal recommendations {{was the chief}} method of filling bureaucratic posts, although there was an Imperial Academy to train potential candidates for office and some offices required its candidates to pass formal written tests before appointment. However, {{it was not until}} the Sui Dynasty (581–618) that civil service examinations became open to all adult males not belonging to the merchant class (although having wealth or noble status were not requirements) and were used as a universal prerequisite for appointments to office, at least in theory. The civil service system was implemented on a much larger scale during the Song Dynasty (960–1279), when an elite core of dynastic-founding and professional families lost their majority in government to a broad strata of lesser gentry <b>families</b> <b>from</b> throughout the country.|$|E
5|$|During the High Middle Ages, Crompton was a {{collection}} of scattered woods, farmsteads, moorland, swamp and a single corn mill, occupied by a small and close community of families. The area was thinly populated and consisted of several dispersed hamlets, including Whitfield, High Crompton, Cowlishaw, Birshaw and Bovebeale (above Beal). These hamlets were situated above the water-logged valley bottoms and below the exposed high moors. Owing to complicated local arrangements of land tenure, inheritance, and absentee landlords, the local lordship was weak, and Crompton failed to emerge as a manor with its own lord and court. This slowly facilitated comparative freedoms and independence for the early people of Crompton, which encouraged the influx of <b>families</b> <b>from</b> the neighbouring parish of Rochdale, including the Buckleys, Cleggs, Greaves and Milnes.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{outbreak}} of World War II in September 1939, the 26th Battalion undertook a series of training camps around northern Queensland as it began to re-establish its numbers. Between September and November, it was based around Kissing Point, Queensland, before moving to Townsville in February 1940, and then south of Bowen the following month. At this time, it was placed {{under the command of}} the 11th Brigade, along with the 31st and 51st Battalions, both of which were Queensland-based Militia battalions. In mid-1940, the battalion's strength fluctuated as compulsory service was reintroduced and drafts of national servicemen marched in for short periods of training, while volunteers were released to join the Second Australian Imperial Force (2nd AIF) and other services. Many of the initial recruits came from Italian-Australian <b>families</b> <b>from</b> north Queensland, but as the battalion grew, reinforcements from other Australian states arrived during 1942 and early 1943.|$|E

Birnholz tendered his resignation in 1973, and Wax began to think of retirement. Danziger, then at Baltimore's Temple Oheb Shalom, was approached as Wax's successor, and returned to Temple Israel that year as associate rabbi.

On June30, a mudslide knocked down a tree onto a 115-kV transmission line near El Vergel, causing 82 {{cities and towns}} in the municipalities of Villaflores and Villa Corzo to lose power; 32,000 residents were left without electricity from this outage alone.

5|$|Islanders {{struggled}} with food shortage {{in the last}} months of the occupation. Hathaway organised a raid on German grain stocks and saved many <b>families</b> <b>from</b> starvation with her secret potato hoard. Sark was liberated on 10 May 1945. Three British officers arrived and, explaining that no British troops were available, asked the Dame to take command of 275 men belonging to the defeated German garrison. She made sure the garrison cleared up the island of land mines. She was, however, so concerned about the legal status of the decisions she had issued during the war that she sailed to Guernsey to validate them as soon as the island was liberated. Her experience of the German occupation inspired William Douglas-Home's play The Dame of Sark. Hathaway's manner of receiving Germans has been described as both impressive and overly cordial.|$|E

5|$|Mutations {{can involve}} large {{sections}} of a chromosome becoming duplicated (usually by genetic recombination), which can introduce extra copies of a gene into a genome. Extra copies of genes are {{a major source of}} the raw material needed for new genes to evolve. This is important because most new genes evolve within gene <b>families</b> <b>from</b> pre-existing genes that share common ancestors. For example, the human eye uses four genes to make structures that sense light: three for colour vision and one for night vision; all four are descended from a single ancestral gene.|$|E
