5|$|Castle is {{sometimes}} {{used as a}} catch-all term {{for all kinds of}} fortifications and, as a result, has been misapplied in the technical sense.

5|$|Homosexual arousal in {{childhood}} appeared to predict adult homosexuality, while homosexual activities and arousal during adolescence <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> strong connection with adult homosexuality. Rape and sexual molestation {{did not appear}} to be significant in the development of homosexuality. Heterosexual arousal during childhood <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> small effect on adult sexual preference. Homosexual women were more likely to have their first homosexual encounter before their first heterosexual encounter. Phenomena associated with physical maturation, such as the age at which menstruation began, {{did not appear to}} play a significant role in the development of sexual preference, while parental attitudes toward sex and failure to enjoy early heterosexual activity also seemed unimportant. Sexual feelings seemed important in the development of adult homosexuality.|$|E

It is likely that his pop art was nothing more than an attempt to attract attention to his work.|$|E

5|$|Somewhat unusually among theropods, T.rex <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> long cochlea. The {{length of}} the cochlea is often related to hearing acuity, {{or at least the}} {{importance}} of hearing in behavior, implying that hearing was a particularly important sense to tyrannosaurs. Specifically, data suggests that Tyrannosaurus rex heard best in the low-frequency range, and that low-frequency sounds were an important part of tyrannosaur behavior.|$|E
