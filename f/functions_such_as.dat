5|$|Many {{proteins}} {{are composed}} of several protein domains, i.e. segments of a protein that fold into distinct structural units. Domains usually also have specific <b>functions,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> enzymatic activities (e.g. kinase) or they serve as binding modules (e.g. the SH3 domain binds to proline-rich sequences in other proteins).|$|E

Tours of the prison show aspects of prison life and recount successful and attempted escapes. Sections of the tunnels are accessible, and night tours focus on the prison's reputation for being haunted.|$|E
5|$|Because {{it was not}} {{possible}} to upgrade Gardner Hall, a new modern block, Orchard Hall, was built to replace it. Gardner became an assessment centre for prospective students. In September 2009 Gardner was made available as a venue for hire for <b>functions</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> weddings. In addition to the halls of residence, the college also owns several houses both on and off campus which enable students to gain a greater level of independent living.

Dandanayakas {{were in charge of}} armies and the chief justice of the Hoysala court was the Dharmadhikari.|$|E
5|$|Linear probing {{can provide}} high {{performance}} {{because of its}} good locality of reference, but is {{more sensitive to the}} quality of its hash function than some other collision resolution schemes. It takes constant expected time per search, insertion, or deletion when implemented using a random hash function, a 5-independent hash function, or tabulation hashing. However, good results can be achieved in practice with other hash <b>functions</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> MurmurHash.|$|E
