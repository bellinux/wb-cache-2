40|$|Purpose: To {{assess the}} {{compliance}} of Daily Disposable Contact Lenses (DDCLs) wearers with replacing lenses at a manufacturer-recommended replacement frequency. To evaluate {{the ability of}} two different Health Behavioural Theories (HBT), The Health Belief Model (HBM) and The Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB), in predicting compliance. Method: A multi-centre survey was conducted using a questionnaire completed anonymously by contact lens wearers during the purchase of DDCLs. Results: Three hundred and fifty-four questionnaires were returned. The survey comprised 58. 5 % females and 41. 5 % males (mean age 34. Â±. 12. years). Twenty-three percent of respondents were non-compliant with manufacturer-recommended replacement <b>frequency</b> (<b>re-using</b> DDCLs at least once). The main reason for re-using DDCLs was "to save money" (35 %). Predictions of compliance behaviour (past behaviour or future intentions) {{on the basis of}} the two HBT was investigated through logistic regression analysis: both TPB factors (subjective norms and perceived behavioural control) were significant (p. <. 0. 01); HBM was less predictive with only the severity (past behaviour and future intentions) and perceived benefit (only for past behaviour) as significant factors (p. <. 0. 05). Conclusions: Non-compliance with DDCLs replacement is widespread, affecting 1 out of 4 Italian wearers. Results from the TPB model show that the involvement of persons socially close to the wearers (subjective norms) and the improvement of the procedure of behavioural control of daily replacement (behavioural control) are of paramount importance in improving compliance. With reference to the HBM, it is important to warn DDCLs wearers of the severity of a contact-lens-related eye infection, and to underline the possibility of its prevention...|$|R

40|$|Immunoglobulins {{are highly}} diverse protein {{sequences}} that are processed and presented to T-cells by B-cells and other antigen presenting cells. We examined a large dataset of immunoglobulin heavy chain variable regions (IGHV) {{to assess the}} diversity of T-cell exposed motifs (TCEM). TCEM comprise those amino acids in a MHC-bound peptide which face outwards, surrounded by the MHC histotope, and which engage the T-cell receptor. Within IGHV there is a distinct pattern of predicted MHC class II binding and a very high <b>frequency</b> of <b>re-use</b> of the TCEMs. The <b>re-use</b> <b>frequency</b> indicates that {{only a limited number}} of different cognate T-cells are required to engage many different clonal B-cells. The amino acids in each outward-facing TCEM are intercalated with the amino acids of inward-facing MHC groove-exposed motifs (GEM). Different GEM may have differing, allele-specific, MHC binding affinities. The intercalation of TCEM and GEM in a peptide allows for a vast combinatorial repertoire of epitopes, each eliciting a different response. Outcome of T-cell receptor binding is determined by overall signal strength, which is a function of the number of responding T-cells and the duration of engagement. Hence, the frequency of T-cell exposed motif re-use appears to be an important determinant of whether a T-cell response is stimulatory or suppressive. The frequency distribution of TCEMs implies that somatic hypermutation is followed by clonal expansion that develop along repeated pathways. The observations of TCEM and GEM derived from immunoglobulins suggest a relatively simple, yet powerful, mechanism to correlate T-cell polyspecificity, through re-use of TCEMs, with a very high degree of specificity achieved by combination with a diversity of GEMs. The frequency profile of TCEMs also points to an economical mechanism for maintaining T-cell memory, recall, and self-discrimination based on an endogenously generated profile of motifs...|$|R

40|$|While {{the number}} of variant CreutzfeldtâJakob disease (vCJD) cases {{continues}} to decline, concern has been raised that transmission could occur directly {{from one person to}} another through routes including the transfer of blood and shared use of surgical instruments.

We then apply a mathematical framework to assess the potential for self-sustaining epidemics via surgical procedures. Data from hospital episode statistics on the rates of high- and medium-risk procedures in the UK were used to estimate model parameters, and sensitivity to other unknown parameters about surgically transmitted vCJD was assessed. Our results demonstrate that a key uncertainty determining the scale of an epidemic and whether it is self-sustaining is {{the number of}} times a single instrument is re-used, alongside the infectivity of contaminated instruments and the effectiveness of cleaning.

50|$|Cellular Mobile Networks: In {{cellular}} mobile communication (GSM & LTE Systems, for instance), frequency spectrum is a precious resource which {{is divided into}} non-overlapping spectrum bands which are assigned to different cells (In cellular communications, a cell refers to the hexagonal/circular area around the base station antenna). However, after certain geographical distance, the <b>frequency</b> bands are <b>re-used,</b> i.e. the same spectrum bands are reassigned to other distant cells. The co-channel interference arises in the {{cellular mobile}} networks owing to this phenomenon of frequency reuse. Thus, besides the intended signal from within the cell, signals at the same frequencies (co-channel signals) arrive at the receiver from the undesired transmitters located (far away) in some other cells and lead to deterioration in receiver performance.|$|R
40|$|In current {{satellite}} systems operating above 10 GHz the {{main sources of}} interference are the differential rain attenuation, {{as well as the}} rain cross-polarization (valid for <b>frequency</b> <b>re-use</b> systems).
