25|$|Early {{papers on}} <b>geosynthetics</b> (as {{we know them}} today) in the 1960s {{documented}} their use as filters in the United States and as reinforcement in Europe. A 1977 conference in Paris brought together many of the early manufacturers and practitioners. The International <b>Geosynthetics</b> Society (IGS) founded in 1982 has subsequently organized a worldwide conference every four years and its numerous chapters have additional conferences. Presently, separate geosynthetic institutes, trade-groups, and standards-setting groups are active. Approximately twenty universities teach stand-alone courses on <b>geosynthetics</b> and almost all include the subject in geotechnical, geoenvironmental, and hydraulic engineering courses. <b>Geosynthetics</b> are available worldwide and the activity is robust and steadily growing.|$|E
25|$|Containment {{involves}} geomembranes, geosynthetic clay liners, or some geocomposites which {{function as}} liquid or gas barriers. Landfill liners and covers make critical {{use of these}} <b>geosynthetics.</b> All hydraulic applications (tunnels, dams, canals, surface impoundments, and floating covers) use these <b>geosynthetics</b> as well.|$|E
25|$|<b>Geosynthetics</b> such as geotextiles, geogrids and geocells are {{frequently}} {{used in the}} various pavement layers to improve road quality. These materials and methods are used in low-traffic private roadways as well as public roads and highways. <b>Geosynthetics</b> perform four main functions in roads: separation, reinforcement, filtration and drainage; which increase the pavement performance, reduce construction costs and decrease maintenance.|$|E

25|$|The low {{thickness}} of <b>geosynthetics,</b> {{as compared to}} their natural soil counterparts, is an advantage insofar as light weight on the subgrade, less airspace used, and avoidance of quarried sand, gravel, and clay soil materials.|$|E
25|$|<b>Geosynthetics</b> are {{generally}} {{designed for a}} particular application by considering the primary function that can be provided. As seen in the accompanying table there are five primary functions given, but some groups suggest even more.|$|E
25|$|The {{manufactured}} {{quality control}} of <b>geosynthetics</b> {{in a controlled}} factory environment is a great advantage over outdoor soil and rock construction. Most factories are ISO 9000 certified and have their own in-house quality programs as well.|$|E
25|$|<b>Geo{{synthetic}}s</b> are synthetic products used {{to stabilize}} terrain. They are generally polymeric products used to solve civil engineering problems. This includes eight main product categories: geotextiles, geogrids, geonets, geomembranes, geosynthetic clay liners, geofoam, geocells and geocomposites. The polymeric {{nature of the}} products makes them suitable for use in the ground where high levels of durability are required. They can also be used in exposed applications. <b>Geosynthetics</b> are available {{in a wide range of}} forms and materials. These products have a wide range of applications and are currently used in many civil, geotechnical, transportation, geoenvironmental, hydraulic, and private development applications including roads, airfields, railroads, embankments, retaining structures, reservoirs, canals, dams, erosion control, sediment control, landfill liners, landfill covers, mining, aquaculture and agriculture.|$|E
25|$|Mechanically {{stabilized}} earth, {{also called}} MSE, is soil constructed with artificial reinforcing via layered horizontal mats (<b>geosynthetics)</b> fixed at their ends. These mats provide added internal shear resistance {{beyond that of}} simple gravity wall structures. Other options include steel straps, also layered. This type of soil strengthening usually needs outer facing walls (S.R.W.'s – Segmental Retaining Walls) to affix the layers to and vice versa.|$|E
25|$|Drainage is the {{equilibrium}} soil-to-geosynthetic {{system that allows}} for adequate liquid flow without soil loss, within {{the plane of the}} geosynthetic over a service lifetime compatible with the application under consideration. Geopipe highlights this function, and also geonets, geocomposites and very thick geotextiles. Drainage applications for these different <b>geosynthetics</b> are retaining walls, sport fields, dams, canals, reservoirs, and capillary breaks. Also to be noted is that sheet, edge and wick drains are geocomposites used for various soil and rock drainage situations.|$|E
25|$|Geogrids {{represent}} {{a rapidly growing}} segment within <b>geosynthetics.</b> Rather than being a woven, nonwoven or knitted textile fabric, geogrids are polymers formed into a very open, gridlike configuration, i.e., they have large apertures between individual ribs in the transverse and longitudinal directions. Geogrids are (a) either stretched in one, two or three directions for improved physical properties, (b) made on weaving or knitting machinery by standard textile manufacturing methods, or (c) by laser or ultrasonically bonding rods or straps together. There are many specific application areas; however, geogrids function almost exclusively as reinforcement materials.|$|E
25|$|A {{geocomposite}} {{consists of}} a combination of geotextiles, geogrids, geonets and/or geomembranes in a factory fabricated unit. Also, any one of these four materials can be combined with another synthetic material (e.g., deformed plastic sheets or steel cables) or even with soil. As examples, a geonet or geospacer with geotextiles on both surfaces and a GCL consisting of a geotextile/bentonite/geotextile sandwich are both geocomposites. This specific category brings out the best creative efforts of the engineer and manufacturer. The application areas are numerous and constantly growing. The major functions encompass the entire range of functions listed for <b>geosynthetics</b> discussed previously: separation, reinforcement, filtration, drainage, and containment.|$|E
25|$|Geonets, and {{the related}} geospacers by some, {{constitute}} another specialized segment within the <b>geosynthetics</b> area. They are formed by a continuous extrusion of parallel sets of polymeric ribs at acute angles to one another. When the ribs are opened, relatively large apertures are formed into a netlike configuration. Two types are most common, either biplanar or triplanar. Alternatively many very different types of drainage cores are available. They consist of nubbed, dimpled or cuspated polymer sheets, three-dimensional networks of stiff polymer fibers in different configurations and small drainage pipes or spacers within geotextiles. Their design function is completely within the drainage area where {{they are used to}} convey liquids or gases of all types.|$|E
25|$|Geo{{textiles}} {{form one}} of the two largest groups of <b>geosynthetics.</b> They are textiles consisting of synthetic fibers rather than natural ones such as cotton, wool, or silk. This makes them less susceptible to bio-degradation. These synthetic fibers are made into flexible, porous fabrics by standard weaving machinery or are matted together in a random non woven manner. Some are also knitted. Geotextiles are porous to liquid flow across their manufactured plane and also within their thickness, but to a widely varying degree. There are at least 100 specific application areas for geotextiles that have been developed; however, the fabric always performs at least one of four discrete functions: separation, reinforcement, filtration, and/or drainage.|$|E
25|$|Geomembranes {{represent}} the other {{largest group of}} <b>geosynthetics,</b> and in dollar volume their sales are {{greater than that of}} geotextiles. Their growth in the United States and Germany was stimulated by governmental regulations originally enacted in the early 1980s for the lining of solid-waste landfills. The materials themselves are relatively thin, impervious sheets of polymeric material used primarily for linings and covers of liquids- or solid-storage facilities. This includes all types of landfills, surface impoundments, canals, and other containment facilities. Thus the primary function is always containment as a liquid or vapor barrier or both. The range of applications, however, is great, and in addition to the environmental area, applications are rapidly growing in geotechnical, transportation, hydraulic, and private development engineering (such as aquaculture, agriculture, heap leach mining, etc.).|$|E
25|$|The {{juxtaposition}} {{of the various}} types of <b>geosynthetics</b> just described with the primary function that the material is called upon to serve allows for the creation of an organizational matrix for geosynthetics; see table below. In essence, this matrix is the “scorecard” for understanding the entire geosynthetic field and its design related methodology. In the table the primary function that each geosynthetic can be called upon to serve is seen. Note that these are primary functions and in many cases (if not most) cases there are secondary functions, and perhaps tertiary ones as well. For example, a geotextile placed on soft soil will usually be designed {{on the basis of its}} reinforcement capability, but separation and filtration might certainly be secondary and tertiary considerations. As another example, a geomembrane is obviously used for its containment capability, but separation will always be a secondary function.|$|E
500|$|Although {{construction}} {{using the}} basic principles of MSE has a long history, MSE was developed in its current form in the 1960s. The reinforcing elements used can vary but include steel and <b>geosynthetics.</b> The term MSE is usually used in the USA to distinguish it from [...] "Reinforced Earth", a trade name of the Reinforced Earth Company, but elsewhere Reinforced Soil is the generally accepted term. MSE construction is relatively fast and inexpensive, and although labor-intensive, it does not demand high levels of skill. It is therefore suitable for developing as well as developed countries.|$|E
2500|$|Earlier in the 20th century, taller {{retaining}} walls were often gravity walls made pevert people [...] from large masses of concrete or stone. Today, taller {{retaining walls}} are increasingly built as composite gravity walls such as: <b>geosynthetics</b> such as geocell cellular confinement earth retention [...] or with precast facing; gabions (stacked steel wire baskets filled with rocks); crib walls (cells built up log cabin style from precast concrete or timber {{and filled with}} granular material); or soil-nailed walls (soil reinforced in place with steel and concrete rods).|$|E
2500|$|Asphalt (specifically, asphalt concrete), {{sometimes}} called flexible pavement {{due to the}} nature in which it distributes loads, has been widely used since the 1920s. The viscous nature of the bitumen binder allows asphalt concrete to sustain significant plastic deformation, although fatigue from repeated loading over time is the most common failure mechanism. [...] Most asphalt surfaces are laid on a gravel base, which is generally at least as thick as the asphalt layer, although some 'full depth' asphalt surfaces are laid directly on the native subgrade. [...] In areas with very soft or expansive subgrades such as clay or peat, thick gravel bases or stabilization of the subgrade with Portland cement or lime may be required. Polypropylene and polyester <b>geosynthetics</b> have also been used for this purpose and in some northern countries, a layer of polystyrene boards have been used to delay and minimize frost penetration into the subgrade.|$|E
2500|$|Asphalt {{overlays}} {{are sometimes}} laid over distressed concrete {{to restore a}} smooth wearing surface. A disadvantage of this method is that movement in the joints between the underlying concrete slabs, whether from thermal expansion and contraction, or from deflection of the concrete slabs from truck axle loads, usually causes [...] reflective cracks in the asphalt. To decrease reflective cracking, concrete pavement is broken apart through a break and seat, crack and seat, or rubblization process. <b>Geosynthetics</b> {{can be used for}} reflective crack control. With break and seat and crack and seat processes, a heavy weight is dropped on the concrete to induce cracking, then a heavy roller is used to seat the resultant pieces into the subbase. The main difference between the two processes is the equipment used to break the concrete pavement {{and the size of the}} resulting pieces. The theory is frequent small cracks will spread thermal stress over a wider area than infrequent large joints, reducing the stress on the overlying asphalt pavement. Rubblization is a more complete fracturing of the old, worn-out concrete, effectively converting the old pavement into an aggregate base for a new asphalt road.|$|E

50|$|Novel {{polymeric}} alloy, {{also known}} as Neoloy, is a polymeric alloy composed of polyolefin and thermoplastic engineering polymer. It was developed specifically for use in high-strength <b>geosynthetics.</b> The first commercial application was in the manufacturer of polymeric strips used to form cellular confinement systems (geocells). Novel polymeric alloy was developed to replace high-density polyethylene (HDPE) in <b>geosynthetics.</b> Although HDPE is widely used due to its low cost, ease of manufacturing and flexibility, its relatively high creep, low tensile strength and sensitivity to elevated temperatures limit its use, for example, in long-term, critical geocell applications. Used {{in the manufacture of}} <b>geosynthetics,</b> such as the Neoweb cellular confinement system, novel polymeric alloy provides geocells with a higher tensile strength and stiffness, and are more durable over dynamic loading and under elevated temperatures than those made from HDPE (Han, 2011). The lifespan of novel polymeric alloy <b>geosynthetics,</b> such as geocells, makes them suitable for long-term design in infrastructure, such as highways, railways, container yards and high retaining walls.|$|E
