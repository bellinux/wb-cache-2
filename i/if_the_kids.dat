25|$|That night, {{the family}} stays {{at a hotel}} where they {{try to come up}} with a plan and Jules shows Sandspur to his girlfriend, Cindy. Based on the story of the Pied Piper of Hamelin, Nick thinks about the {{possibility}} of asking the merfolk to lure the giants to the sea, since they seem to be hypnotized by a nixie's singing. The kids sneak out to the beach, where they find that the mermaids hate land-dwellers and kidnap Jules, promising to let him go and sing the giants to the sea <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> bring them a fish that has never been in their sea. They steal a tropical fish from Cindy's father's aquarium and race back to the beach. The mermaids are amazed that they completed the task and return Jules. Keeping their promise but intending to trick the humans, the mermaids sing for only a little while and to no effect before disappearing. However, Nick manages to tape their song in a tape recorder, which they intend to use to lure the giants themselves.|$|E

5000|$|The first {{image in}} chapter one of Rankine's book {{is an image}} with a street named Jim Crow Road. The {{original}} website from where this image originated states, [...] "In 2007, there's still a place called [...] "Jim Crow Road." [...] It runs through a typical southern neighborhood, past a strip mall with a Curves franchise, past a few gated McMansions, a small country store, and the white houses seen here. The road crosses behind an Elementary school, right past the playground. One wonders <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> there are still being taught what Jim Crow means, in Hall County, which adjoins Forsyth County, known for its infamous [...] "sundown town" [...] that existed well until the '80s" [...] (Murphy). [...] Rankine attacks {{a different part of}} your brain when using an image, and her reasons for that is to interject abstractness to force you to rethink the historical picture, and ask the reader to {{go out of their way}} to do some of their own research. She does this to not only keep interest but for you to do thinking on your own. This image came from either Georgia or Florida from an upper-middle-class neighborhood. An inherently racist street name is followed by white houses, a white fence, and a white car, a historical reference to the name of the road, Jim Crow laws were state and local laws enforcing racial segregation in the Southern United States during the reconstruction period until 1965. The image comes after the story where Rankine tells about how in catholic school the teacher did not notice the white girl cheating off her paper, referencing one central her themes on how blacks are seen as invisible. Her reasons are to show a literal setting of the type of neighborhood she is from and is talking about. The image reinforces the idea that even in a suburban area, where if anyone has money white or black, that you can not escape the racism being that a street with that name actually exists. It provides to Rankine's argument that racism is an invisible institution, as an infrastructure of the community desensitizes racism from the people living there, because they have lived there so long the do not see the problem, adding to the bigger picture of how this upper-middle-class neighborhood is similar to middle class America, representing the ongoing problems not only in the book but in America.|$|E
