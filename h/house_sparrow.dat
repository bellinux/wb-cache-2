5|$|The <b>house</b> <b>sparrow</b> is host to a {{huge number}} of parasites and diseases, and the effect of most is unknown. Ornithologist Ted R. Anderson listed thousands, noting that his list was incomplete. The {{commonly}} recorded bacterial pathogens of the <b>house</b> <b>sparrow</b> are often those common in humans, and include Salmonella and Escherichia coli. Salmonella is common in the <b>house</b> <b>sparrow,</b> and a comprehensive study of <b>house</b> <b>sparrow</b> disease found it in 13% of sparrows tested. Salmonella epidemics in the spring and winter can kill large numbers of sparrows. The <b>house</b> <b>sparrow</b> hosts avian pox and avian malaria, which it has spread to the native forest birds of Hawaii. Many of the diseases hosted by the <b>house</b> <b>sparrow</b> are also present in humans and domestic animals, for which the <b>house</b> <b>sparrow</b> acts as a reservoir host. Arboviruses such as the West Nile virus, which most commonly infect insects and mammals, survive winters in temperate areas by going dormant in birds such as the <b>house</b> <b>sparrow.</b> A few records indicate disease extirpating <b>house</b> <b>sparrow</b> populations, especially from Scottish islands, but this seems to be rare.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the recent}} years, the <b>house</b> <b>sparrow</b> {{population}} {{has been on the}} decline in many Asian countries, and this decline is quite evident in India. To promote the conservation of these birds, in 2012, the <b>house</b> <b>sparrow</b> was declared as the state bird of Delhi.|$|E
5|$|Protecting insect {{habitats}} on farms, {{and planting}} native plants in cities benefit the <b>house</b> <b>sparrow,</b> as does establishing urban green spaces. To {{raise awareness of}} threats to the <b>house</b> <b>sparrow,</b> World Sparrow Day has been celebrated on 20 March across the world since 2010.|$|E
40|$|Birds lose feathers, whether during molt or by accident, {{and replace}} them by {{processes}} that are energetically demanding. We hypothesized that <b>house</b> <b>sparrows</b> Passer domesticus biblicus use behavioral means to save energy when feathers are lost, and tested the general prediction that <b>house</b> <b>sparrows</b> growing new feathers adjust their behavior to minimize the energy costs of foraging and to increase net energy gain from their food. To test these predictions we divided 18 <b>house</b> <b>sparrows</b> into three groups: 1) plucked – <b>house</b> <b>sparrows</b> from which we plucked 15 flight feathers; 2) cut – <b>house</b> <b>sparrows</b> in which the same 15 feathers were cut off at the calamus below the barbs; and 3) control – unmanipulated <b>house</b> <b>sparrows</b> with plumage intact. We recorded both the quantity of seeds the <b>house</b> <b>sparrows</b> ate and the time they spent foraging from assay food patches. We found that ‘plucked’ sparrows growing new feathers adjust their foraging behavior by reducing their feeding time {{and the number of}} visits to a food patch. This allowed them to increase their patch harvest rate while maintaining a steady body mass...|$|R
5|$|Animals form another {{important}} part of the <b>house</b> <b>sparrow's</b> diet, chiefly insects, of which beetles, caterpillars, dipteran flies, and aphids are especially important. Various noninsect arthropods are eaten, as are molluscs and crustaceans where available, earthworms, and even vertebrates such as lizards and frogs. Young <b>house</b> <b>sparrows</b> are fed mostly on insects until about 15 days after hatching. They are also given small quantities of seeds, spiders, and grit. In most places, grasshoppers and crickets are the most abundant foods of nestlings. True bugs, ants, sawflies, and beetles are also important, but <b>house</b> <b>sparrows</b> take advantage of whatever foods are abundant to feed their young. <b>House</b> <b>sparrows</b> have been observed stealing prey from other birds, including American robins.|$|R
5000|$|Eskin's most cited paper {{while in}} Menaker's lab {{concerns}} his research of non-ocular entraining cues in <b>house</b> <b>sparrows.</b> [...] In it, Eskin and Menaker showed {{the scientific community}} the ability of <b>house</b> <b>sparrows</b> to entrain to auditory cues as opposed to previously shown light cues.|$|R
5|$|Several {{studies of}} the <b>house</b> <b>sparrow</b> in {{temperate}} agricultural areas have found the proportion of seeds in its diet to be about 90%. It will eat almost any seeds, but where it has a choice, it prefers oats and wheat. In urban areas, the <b>house</b> <b>sparrow</b> feeds largely on food provided directly or indirectly by humans, such as bread, though it prefers raw seeds. The <b>house</b> <b>sparrow</b> also eats some plant matter besides seeds, including buds, berries, and fruits such as grapes and cherries. In temperate areas, the <b>house</b> <b>sparrow</b> has an unusual habit of tearing flowers, especially yellow ones, in the spring.|$|E
5|$|Tchernov {{argued that}} the <b>house</b> <b>sparrow</b> and related species have {{undergone}} considerable morphological changes in adapting to a commensal relationship with humans, with the beak becoming longer and narrower. He wrote that P.predomesticus was intermediate between the <b>house</b> <b>sparrow</b> and Spanish sparrow (Passer hispaniolensis), and suggested {{that it may be}} a primitive relative of the ancestor of the <b>house</b> <b>sparrow</b> that did not become dependent on humans. In a 1984 paper, Tchernov suggested that the period in which the <b>house</b> <b>sparrow</b> and P.predomesticus could have separated was the Würm glaciation 70,000–10,000 years ago. Markus found that the fossil species was closest to living house sparrows from Palestine and to the great sparrow (P.motitensis), and proposed that the <b>house</b> <b>sparrow</b> evolved in Africa. In a 1977 account of the evolution of the <b>house</b> <b>sparrow,</b> American zoologists Richard F. Johnston and William J. Klitz considered that the <b>house</b> <b>sparrow</b> evolved with the beginning of agriculture, dating any fossils that could even be assigned to the common ancestor of the house and Spanish sparrows as more recent than P.predomesticus. In his 1988 work The Sparrows, British ornithologist J. Denis Summers-Smith considered that P.predomesticus was roughly contemporary with the common ancestor of the house and Spanish sparrows and that all present-day Palaearctic Passer species evolved later. Drawing on more recent studies of molecular data, Ted R. Anderson stated in his 2006 Biology of the Ubiquitous <b>House</b> <b>Sparrow</b> that all Passer species have a long evolutionary history, with speciation possibly occurring as early as the Miocene.|$|E
5|$|The house sparrow's main predators are {{cats and}} birds of prey, {{but many other}} animals prey on them, {{including}} corvids, squirrels, and even humans—the <b>house</b> <b>sparrow</b> has been consumed in the past by people {{in many parts of}} the world, and it still is in parts of the Mediterranean. Most species of birds of prey have been recorded preying on the <b>house</b> <b>sparrow</b> in places where records are extensive. Accipiters and the merlin in particular are major predators, though cats are likely to have a greater impact on <b>house</b> <b>sparrow</b> populations. The <b>house</b> <b>sparrow</b> is also a common victim of roadkill; on European roads, it is the bird most frequently found dead.|$|E
50|$|With AN aim to {{disseminate}} {{information about the}} conservation of <b>house</b> <b>sparrows</b> the Nature Forever Society has created the websites below. The websites give detailed information about the decline of <b>house</b> <b>sparrows,</b> monitoring and how citizens can {{play a vital role}} in their conservation.|$|R
40|$|<b>House</b> <b>sparrows</b> (Passer domesticus) are {{abundant}} and widespread {{species of birds}} within the order Passeriformes and may contribute to AIV transmission and maintenance in nature. This study was carried out to find the role of <b>house</b> <b>sparrows</b> in the spread of low-pathogenicity avian influenza viruses as carrier birds. For this reason seroprevalence survey {{was carried out in}} two-hundred <b>house</b> <b>sparrows,</b> using the hemagglutination-inhibition (HI) test. The studied sparrows did not show any clinical signs of disease. The Overall HI titer and seroprevalence against H 9 N 2 were 7. 14 and 76 %, respectively. Results of this study revealed that <b>house</b> <b>sparrows</b> showed ability to be infected with H 9 N 2 avian influenza virus and {{play an important role in}} spreading of AIV as natural carriers...|$|R
40|$|Wild {{birds are}} {{potential}} vehicles of zoonotic pathogen transmission to humans. The zoonotic concern increases for small wild birds like <b>house</b> <b>sparrows</b> (Passer domesticus) and starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) which are hunted {{in developing countries}} and commercialised in Italy for human consumption. From June to October 2011, 330 <b>house</b> <b>sparrows</b> and 140 starlings were hunted and slaughtered. Deepfrozen carcasses were transported to Italy and stored for 6 - 8 months at - 18 °C. Aerobic colony count and Salmonella detection in carcasses were assessed following standard microbiological methods (ISO 4833 : 2003 and ISO 6579 : 2004, respectively). Carcasses of <b>house</b> <b>sparrows</b> showed higher levels of aerobic bacteria in comparison to starling carcasses (5. 7 vs 3. 2 log 10 CFU/g). Moreover, 7 out of 11 lots of carcasses of <b>house</b> <b>sparrows</b> were positive for Salmonella. Among the 18 isolates of Salmonella, 14 were S. Typhimurium, 2 were S. Enteritidis, and 2 were not distinguishable. All of them were susceptible to antibiotics. All tested carcasses of starling were Salmonella negative. Deep-freezing was not efficient as a decontamination technique on carcasses of <b>house</b> <b>sparrows...</b>|$|R
5|$|The <b>house</b> <b>sparrow</b> {{is closely}} {{associated}} with humans. They {{are believed to have}} become associated with humans around 10,000 years ago. Subspecies P. d. bactrianus is least associated with humans and considered to be evolutionarily closer to the ancestral noncommensal populations. Usually, it is regarded as a pest, since it consumes agricultural products and spreads disease to humans and their domestic animals. Even birdwatchers often hold it in little regard because of its molestation of other birds. In most of the world, the <b>house</b> <b>sparrow</b> is not protected by law. Attempts to control house sparrows include the trapping, poisoning, or shooting of adults; the destruction of their nests and eggs; or less directly, blocking nest holes and scaring off sparrows with noise, glue, or porcupine wire. However, the <b>house</b> <b>sparrow</b> can be beneficial to humans, as well, especially by eating insect pests, and attempts at the large-scale control of the <b>house</b> <b>sparrow</b> have failed.|$|E
5|$|The immune {{response}} of tree sparrows is less robust {{than that of}} the <b>house</b> <b>sparrow</b> and has been proposed as a factor in the greater invasive potential of the latter. The <b>house</b> <b>sparrow</b> and tree sparrow are the most frequent victims of roadkill on the roads of Central, Eastern and Southern Europe. The maximum recorded age is 13.1 years, but three years is a typical lifespan.|$|E
5|$|When the Eurasian {{tree sparrow}} {{and the larger}} <b>house</b> <b>sparrow</b> occur in the same area, the <b>house</b> <b>sparrow</b> {{generally}} breeds in urban areas while the smaller Eurasian tree sparrow nests in the countryside. Where trees are in short supply, as in Mongolia, both species may utilise man-made structures as nest sites. The Eurasian tree sparrow is rural in Europe, but is an urban bird in eastern Asia; in southern and central Asia, both Passer species may be found around towns and villages. In parts of the Mediterranean, such as Italy, both the tree and the Italian or Spanish sparrows {{may be found in}} settlements. In Australia, the Eurasian tree sparrow is largely an urban bird, and it is the <b>house</b> <b>sparrow</b> which utilises more natural habitats.|$|E
40|$|Determining {{the effect}} of an {{invasive}} species on enzootic pathogen dynamics is critical for understanding both human epidemics and wildlife epizootics. Theoretical models suggest that when a naive species enters an established host–parasite system, the new host may either reduce (‘dilute’) or increase (‘spillback’) pathogen transmission to native hosts. There are few empirical data to evaluate these possibilities, especially for animal pathogens. Buggy Creek virus (BCRV) is an arthropod-borne alphavirus that is enzootically transmitted by the swallow bug (Oeciacus vicarius) to colonially nesting cliff swallows (Petrochelidon pyrrhonota). In western Nebraska, introduced <b>house</b> <b>sparrows</b> (Passer domesticus) invaded cliff swallow colonies approximately 40 years ago and were exposed to BCRV. We evaluated how the addition of <b>house</b> <b>sparrows</b> to this host–parasite system affected the prevalence and amplification of a bird-associated BCRV lineage. The infection prevalence in <b>house</b> <b>sparrows</b> was eight times that of cliff swallows. Nestling <b>house</b> <b>sparrows</b> in mixed-species colonies were {{significantly less likely to}} be infected than sparrows in single-species colonies. Infected <b>house</b> <b>sparrows</b> circulated BCRV at higher viraemia titres than cliff swallows. BCRV detected in bug vectors at a site was positively associated with virus prevalence in <b>house</b> <b>sparrows</b> but not with virus prevalence in cliff swallows. The addition of a highly susceptible invasive host species has led to perennial BCRV epizootics at cliff swallow colony sites. The native cliff swallow host confers a dilution advantage to invasive sparrow hosts in mixed colonies, while at the same sites <b>house</b> <b>sparrows</b> may increase the likelihood that swallows become infected...|$|R

5|$|Some {{intraspecific}} brood parasitism occurs, and {{instances of}} unusually {{large numbers of}} eggs in a nest {{may be the result}} of females laying eggs in the nests of their neighbours. Such foreign eggs are sometimes recognised and ejected by females. The <b>house</b> <b>sparrow</b> is a victim of interspecific brood parasites, but only rarely, since it usually uses nests in holes too small for parasites to enter, and it feeds its young foods unsuitable for young parasites. In turn, the <b>house</b> <b>sparrow</b> has once been recorded as a brood parasite of the American cliff swallow.|$|E
5|$|The Sind sparrow (Passer pyrrhonotus) is a {{passerine}} bird of the sparrow family Passeridae, found {{around the}} Indus valley region in South Asia. It {{is also known}} as the jungle, Sind jungle, or rufous-backed sparrow. Very similar to the related <b>house</b> <b>sparrow,</b> it is smaller and has distinguishing plumage features. As in the <b>house</b> <b>sparrow,</b> the male has brighter plumage than female and young birds, including black markings and a grey crown. Distinctively, the male has a chestnut stripe running down its head behind the eye, and the female has a darker head than other sparrow species do. Its main vocalisations are soft chirping calls that are extended into longer songs with other sounds interspersed by breeding males. Historically, this species was thought to be very closely related to the <b>house</b> <b>sparrow,</b> but its closest evolutionary affinities may lie elsewhere. Discovered around 1840, this species went undetected for several decades after its discovery.|$|E
5|$|The <b>house</b> <b>sparrow</b> is infested by {{a number}} of {{external}} parasites, which usually cause little harm to adult sparrows. In Europe, the most common mite found on sparrows is Proctophyllodes, the most common ticks are Argas reflexus and Ixodes arboricola, and the most common flea on the <b>house</b> <b>sparrow</b> is Ceratophyllus gallinae. A number of chewing lice occupy different niches on the house sparrow's body. Menacanthus lice occur across the house sparrow's body, where they feed on blood and feathers, while Brueelia lice feed on feathers and Philopterus fringillae occurs on the head.|$|E
40|$|Hosts {{can manage}} {{parasitic}} infections using {{an array of}} tactics, which are likely to vary contingent on coevolutionary history between the host and the parasite. Here we asked whether coping ability of congeners that differ in host-parasite coevolutionary history differed in response to experimental infections with a coccidian parasite. <b>House</b> <b>sparrows</b> (Passer domesticus) and gray-headed sparrows (Passer griseus) are sympatric and ecologically similar, but <b>house</b> <b>sparrows</b> are recent colonizers of Kenya, the site of our comparison, whereas gray-headed sparrows are native. We evaluated three variables as barometers of infection coping ability: vertical flight, pectoral muscle size, and fat score. We also measured routing of a dose of 13 C-labeled leucine, an essential amino acid, among tissues to compare resource allocation strategies in response to infection. We found that burden effects on performance were minimal in both species, but <b>house</b> <b>sparrows</b> maintained considerably higher burdens than gray-headed sparrows regardless of exposure. <b>House</b> <b>sparrows</b> also had more exogeneous leucine tracer in all tissues after 24 h, demonstrating {{a difference in the}} way the two species allocate or distribute resources. We argue that <b>house</b> <b>sparrows</b> may be maintaining larger resource reserves to mitigate costs associated with exposure and infection. Additionally, in response to increased parasite exposure, gray-headed sparrows had less leucine tracer in their spleens and more in their gonads, whereas <b>house</b> <b>sparrows</b> did not change allocation, perhaps indicating a trade-off that is not experienced by the introduced species...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{fenitrothion}} exposure on birds was examined by measuring aerobic metabolism, blood hemoglobin content, plasma cholinesterases, and body weight {{for up to}} 21 d postdose. Peak metabolic rate was measured in a flight chamber in three-dose groups of <b>house</b> <b>sparrows</b> (Passer domesticus; 100 mg/kg = high, 60 mg/kg = medium, 30 mg/kg = low) and one-dose groups of zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata; 3 mg/kg) and king quails (Coturnix chinensis; 26 mg/kg). Aerobic metabolism was measured during 1 h of exposure to subfreezing thermal conditions in low-dose <b>house</b> <b>sparrows</b> and king quails (26 mg/kg). Fenitrothion {{had no effect on}} metabolic rate during cold exposure or on blood hemoglobin at any time. By contrast, aerobic performance during exercise in sparrows was reduced by 58 % (high), 18 % (medium), and 20 % (low), respectively, 2 d postdose. <b>House</b> <b>sparrows</b> (high) had the longest recovery period for peak metabolic rate (21 d) and plasma cholinesterase activity (14 d). <b>House</b> <b>sparrows</b> (high) and treated king quails had significantly lower myoglobin at 48 h postdose, whereas myoglobin was invariant in zebra finches and <b>house</b> <b>sparrows</b> (medium and low). Cholinesterase was maximally inhibited at 6 h postdose, and had recovered within 24 h, in <b>house</b> <b>sparrows</b> (low), king quails, and zebra finches.

5|$|The <b>house</b> <b>sparrow</b> {{was among}} the first animals to be given a {{scientific}} name in the modern system of biological classification, since it was described by Carl Linnaeus, in the 1758 10th edition of Systema Naturae. It was described from a type specimen collected in Sweden, with the name Fringilla domestica. Later, the genus name Fringilla came to be used only for the common chaffinch and its relatives, and the <b>house</b> <b>sparrow</b> has usually been placed in the genus Passer created by French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson in 1760.|$|E
5|$|Hybridisation {{between the}} Eurasian tree sparrow and the <b>house</b> <b>sparrow</b> has been {{recorded}} {{in many parts of}} the world with male hybrids tending to resemble the Eurasian tree sparrow while females have more similarities with the <b>house</b> <b>sparrow.</b> A breeding population in the Eastern Ghats of India, said to be introduced, may also hybridise with house sparrows. On at least one occasion a mixed pair has resulted in fertile young. A wild hybridisation with the resident sparrows of Malta, which are intermediate between the Spanish sparrow (P. hispaniolensis) and Italian sparrows (P. italiae), was recorded in Malta in 1975.|$|E
5|$|In adult house sparrows, annual {{survival}} is 45–65%. After fledging {{and leaving the}} care of their parents, young sparrows have a high mortality rate, which lessens {{as they grow older}} and more experienced. Only about 20–25% of birds hatched survive to their first breeding season. The oldest known wild <b>house</b> <b>sparrow</b> lived for nearly two decades; it was found dead 19years and 9months after it was ringed in Denmark. The oldest recorded captive <b>house</b> <b>sparrow</b> lived for 23years. The typical ratio of males to females in a population is uncertain due to problems in collecting data, but a very slight preponderance of males at all ages is usual.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{observation}} of avian mortality associated with West Nile virus (WNV) infection {{has become a}} hallmark epidemiologic feature in the recent emergence of this pathogen in Israel and North America. To determine if phenotypic differences exist among different WNV isolates, we exposed <b>house</b> <b>sparrows</b> (Passer domesticus) to low passage, lineage 1 WNV strains from North America (NY 99), Kenya (KEN), and Australia (KUN; also known as Kunjin virus). <b>House</b> <b>sparrows</b> inoculated with the NY 99 and KEN strains experienced similar mortality rates and viremia profiles. The KUN strain elicited significantly lower-titered viremia {{when compared with the}} other strains and induced no mortality. This study suggests that natural mortality in <b>house</b> <b>sparrows</b> due to Old World strains of WNV may be occurring where the KEN strain occurs...|$|R
5|$|In towns, the Cape sparrow {{competes with}} both the native {{southern}} grey-headed sparrow and <b>house</b> <b>sparrow,</b> which was introduced to southern Africa in the 19thcentury. Since it is more established around humans in its range than either, it successfully competes with both species, though they may exclude it from nesting in holes. A survey by birdwatchers completed in 2000 found the Cape sparrow increasing in abundance in some suburban areas of South Africa (the northern Johannesburg area, and Pietermaritzburg) and decreasing in others (the southern Cape Town area). The <b>house</b> <b>sparrow</b> was reported decreasing in several urban areas, {{as it has in}} parts of Europe, declines which are attributed to factors including the increasing density of garden plantings and increases in predation.|$|E
5|$|The Sind sparrow's {{chirping}} chup call is softer, less strident, {{and higher}} pitched {{than that of}} the <b>house</b> <b>sparrow,</b> and is easily distinguished. The song of breeding males includes chirrups interspersed with grating t-r-r-rt notes and short warbles or whistles.|$|E
5|$|The {{breeding}} male has a {{short and}} narrow black bib {{and a broad}} chestnut eye stripe that {{does not meet the}} mantle. The male has a grey crown and nape and a rufous lower back and rump. The female has a darker and greyer crown and cheek than the female <b>house</b> <b>sparrow</b> and the shoulder is darker chestnut. The female Dead Sea sparrow of the subspecies Passer moabiticus yattii is also similar to the female Sind sparrow, but has yellow tinges on the underparts and sometimes on parts of the head. The bill is black on the breeding male and pale brown on the non-breeding male and female. With a culmen length of , the Sind sparrow is slightly smaller-billed than the <b>house</b> <b>sparrow.</b>|$|E

500|$|Young <b>house</b> <b>sparrows</b> {{remain in}} the nest for 11 to 23 days, {{normally}} 14 to 16 days. During this time, they are fed by both parents.

40|$|The {{effect of}} parasites in natural populations has {{received}} increasing attention in recent years. Studies {{have shown that}} parasites may play {{an important part in}} population ecology due to their potential effects on host fitness. The main {{purpose of the present study}} was to investigate the effect of a nematode parasite (gapeworm, Syngamus trachea) on survival probability of <b>house</b> <b>sparrows</b> Passer domesticus from six natural populations located on 4 islands in the Helgeland archipelago in northern Norway. Infection status was obtained from feces samples collected from 603 <b>house</b> <b>sparrows</b> in the summer and autumn of 2007 – 2011. We also collected data on a visible symptom of severe infection (gasping for air) in 1391 <b>house</b> <b>sparrows</b> in the summer and autumn 2004 – 2011. We took advantage of recent advances in disease modeling in a multi-event capture–mark–recapture framework to account for imperfect observations (state uncertainty). Each dataset was separately analyzed, in both analyses we investigated the relationships of year, island, individual body condition, age class and population density with survival probabilities. The relationship between infection (determined by feces egg counts) on annual survival of <b>house</b> <b>sparrows</b> was not statistically significant. However, the probability of annual survival was found to be significantly lower for adult <b>house</b> <b>sparrows</b> exhibiting a symptom of severe gapeworm infection, gasping for air. The present study demonstrates that severe infection by a parasite can have a negative relationship with survival probability of short-lived avian hosts in wild populations...|$|R
