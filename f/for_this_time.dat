5|$|Absolutely. There's a {{song called}} 'Army of Me,' {{which is sort of}} a 'Fighter 2.0.' There is a new {{generation}} of fans from a younger demographic that might not have been with me all the way but that watch me on the show now. I feel like every generation should be able to enjoy and have their piece of 'Fighter' within. This time, the way it musically came together it just felt right <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> and this generation. There's {{always going to be a}} fighter in me getting through some obstacle and some hurdle. All these 6-year-olds who know me from pushing my button and turning around in a big red chair who weren't around for the actual 'Fighter,' this is my chance to recharge it, rejuvenate it and do something modernized for them.|$|E
5|$|The {{music for}} the 2011 neo-noir detective video game L.A. Noire, {{developed}} by Team Bondi and published by Rockstar Games, was composed by musicians Andrew Hale and Simon Hale. Recorded at Abbey Road Studios in London, the score also features contributions from Woody Jackson, who had collaborated with Rockstar on previous projects. Andrew Hale felt that composing the game's score was about setting a mood, attempting to compose music that felt accessible to players. The score was inspired by films from the 1940s, though the team avoided specifically composing <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> period, instead opting {{to focus on that}} after the music had been produced. Three supplementary vocal recordings were composed by The Real Tuesday Weld and performed by Claudia Br√ºcken; they also sought to fit with the game's setting.|$|E

25|$|Modern {{historians have}} doubted the {{historical}} accuracy of Livy's description {{of these three}} battles. Livy's battle-scenes <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> period are mostly free reconstructions by him and his sources, {{and there are no}} reasons why these should be different. The number of Samnites killed and the amounts of spoils taken by the Romans have clearly been exaggerated. Historians have noted the many similarities between the story of Publius Decius Mus, and an event said to have taken place on Sicily in 258 when the Romans were fighting the First Punic War against Carthage. According to the ancient sources, a Roman army was in danger of being trapped in a defile when a military tribune led a detachment of 300 men to seize a hilltop {{in the middle of the}} enemy. The Roman army escaped, but of the 300 only the tribune survived. It is unlikely that this latter, in ancient times more famous, episode has not influenced the descriptions of the former.|$|E
500|$|Historian David Hackett Fischer {{compiled}} a list that he describes as [...] "incomplete", consisting of 58 actions that occurred between January 4 and March 21, 1777.

[...] Combined with their losses at Trenton and Princeton, the British lost more men in New Jersey than they did during the campaign for New York City.

500|$|In 1979, Southern Rhodesia was {{restored}} under the direct {{control of a}} British governor following the Lancaster House Agreement. Despite {{the restoration of the}} colony, the Union Jack was treated as the only official flag of Southern Rhodesia <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>time,</b> though the flag of Zimbabwe Rhodesia was also used as a de facto flag. When Lord Soames arrived to become Governor of Southern Rhodesia, the Zimbabwe Rhodesia flag was flying at the airport and not the Union Jack. When asked why, the Rhodesian airport officials stated [...] "We can fly whatever flag we like". The flag of Southern Rhodesia was not used again; it was the Union Jack rather than the Southern Rhodesian flag that was lowered when Britain granted independence to Zimbabwe in April 1980.|$|E
500|$|Shortly {{following}} {{the release of}} the Sugababes' fourth studio album, Taller in More Ways, it was announced in December 2005 that founding group member Mutya Buena had left the band. Two singles were subsequently released from the album featuring new group member Amelle Berrabah, who was announced as Buena's replacement 24 hours after her departure. In June 2006, the Sugababes began working on their fifth studio album which was confirmed for release in 2007. However, group member Heidi Range also revealed that a greatest hits album would be released in time for Christmas 2006, which would include all of the group's hits. When rumours arose that {{the release of the}} album was premature, band member Keisha Buchanan stated that the group had already started to plan a greatest hits album. She explained how it was essential for the album to be released following Buena's departure, saying: [...] "When Mutya left, we decided it was even more important, we should do this as closure so we don't have to relive history all the time." [...] Group member Heidi Range also reflected upon this, saying: [...] "When Mutya was still in the band the greatest hits was always planned <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> anyway.

500|$|The 18th century, in {{contrast}} to the disruption of the 17th century, was a comparatively quiet time for the college. A historian of the college, J. N. L. Baker, wrote that the college records <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> [...] "tell of little but routine entries and departures of fellows and scholars". [...] The Napoleonic Wars saw a reduction in the numbers of students and entries in the records for the purchase of muskets and other items for college members serving in the university corps. After the war, numbers rose, to an average of twenty new students per year between 1821 and 1830. However, debts owed to the college had increased, perhaps due to the economic effects of the war‚Äì by 1832, the college was owed ¬£986 10s 5d (approximately ¬£ in present-day terms). During {{the first half of the}} 19th century, the academic strength of the college diminished: scholarships were sometimes not awarded because of a lack of suitable candidates, and numbers fell: there were only seven new entrants in 1842. Ernest Hardy wrote in his history of the college in 1899 that it had been becoming [...] "increasingly evident for years... that the exclusive connection with Wales was ruining the college as a place of education." ...|$|E

500|$|D'Angelo was {{dissatisfied}} with the direction of R and soul music when conceiving the album. In an interview for Jet, he said that [...] "the term R doesn't mean {{what it used to}} mean.

It's sad‚Äîthey've turned black music into a club thing." [...] In the liner notes for Voodoo, Saul Williams examined the album's concept and echoes D'Angelo's dissatisfaction with the mainstream direction of contemporary R/soul and hip hop, noting a lack of artistic integrity in the two music genres. In an interview for Ebony, D'Angelo said of his role and influences for Voodoo, [...] "I consider myself very respectful of the masters who came before. In some ways, I feel a responsibility to continue and take the cue from what they were doing musically and vibe on it. That's what I want to do. But I want to do it <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> and this generation". In the album's EPK, D'Angelo said that Voodoo is [...] "like a funk album.

500|$|By {{the next}} day, the {{convection}} had decreased, although barometric pressures {{in the area}} remained low, a trademark of development.

By 1500UTC on October22, surface observations and satellite imagery, which indicated the system had developed enough organized convection to be classified as Tropical Depression Eighteen. At {{the time of the}} upgrade, the system was situated about 320mi (515km) south of Kingston, Jamaica The environment around the newly formed depression was characterized by an area of weak steering currents south of a ridge extending eastward from the Gulf of Mexico. Low wind shear and warm sea surface temperatures were conducive for strengthening, and perhaps rapid deepening. Late on October22, a Hurricane Hunters flight observed winds of [...] in a rainband well removed from the center of circulation, prompting the NHC to upgrade the depression to Tropical Storm Sandy. Outflow increased, while moist air helped the convection organize further. The NHC noted that [...] "remaining nearly stationary over the warm waters of southwestern Caribbean Sea is never a good sign <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> of year." [...] Still, the cloud pattern initially remained largely unchanged. Early on October24, an eye began developing, as observed on microwave imagery, and Sandy was moving steadily northward, drawn by a trough approaching from the northwest.
