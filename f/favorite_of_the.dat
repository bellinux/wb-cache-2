5|$|On June 10, 1880, Cabaniss {{graduated}} from the academy and was sent home to await his orders.

Cabaniss was never admonished for shore misconduct, a considerable issue for most other new officers and sailors. He was reportedly a <b>favorite</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> superior officers stationed in Kobe, and was appointed to a spot on the admiral's staff as a reward for his conduct.

5|$|The {{first chapter}} of Team of Rivals portrays four major contenders for the 1860 Republican presidential {{nomination}} on May 18, 1860, awaiting {{the results of the}} national convention by telegraph: New York Senator and former governor William H. Seward, widely considered the frontrunner; Ohio Governor Salmon P. Chase, a <b>favorite</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> party's more radical wing; former Missouri Attorney General Edward Bates, preferred by more conservative elements of the party; and Abraham Lincoln, a former U.S. Representative from Illinois. Goodwin then describes how each candidate rose to national political prominence: Seward through a long alliance with New York political boss Thurlow Weed, Chase through his early advocacy of the abolition of slavery, Bates through a speech opposing President James K. Polk at the 1847 River and Harbor Convention, and Lincoln through a series of debates with Democratic rival Stephen A. Douglas in the 1858 Illinois Senate election. Lincoln is ultimately the victor at the 1860 convention through a superior political operation and by making himself the unobjectionable second choice of all Republican factions, and proceeds to win the presidency.|$|E
