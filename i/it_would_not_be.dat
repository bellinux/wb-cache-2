5|$|In October 2013, in {{a conference}} to promote the 25th season of the show, {{producer}} Al Jean revealed that a major character would die in this episode. The character would have appeared more than twice in the show, and be voiced by an Emmy Award-winning voice actor who won an Emmy for the role as the character. Later that month, {{following the death of}} Marcia Wallace, it was confirmed that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> her character, Edna Krabappel. Voice actor Hank Azaria, whose roles include Apu Nahasapeemapetilon and Moe Szyslak, stated that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> one of his characters. It was shown at the 2014 Comic-Con that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> Homer, although there is a scene that features Lisa worrying about Homer's health as he struggles with a CPAP mask.|$|E
5|$|Outside of his {{numerous}} appearances with WWE, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> Michaels {{first visit}} to Pittsburgh. In 2013, he appeared {{at the opening of}} the first Field & Stream store in suburban Cranberry Township.|$|E
5|$|After {{the success}} of Sputnik 1 in October 1957, Nikita Khrushchev, the Soviet leader, wanted a {{spacecraft}} launched on 7 November 1957, the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution. Construction had already started on a more sophisticated satellite, but <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> ready until December; this satellite would later become Sputnik 3.|$|E

6000|$|... "Of {{course you}} are glad I like him, my dear. If I did n't like him, and you did, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>n't</b> <b>be</b> {{satisfactory}} at all. I can imagine nothing more miserable; I should n't die in any sort of comfort." ...|$|R
5|$|Although <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> {{publicly}} announced until March 18, 1965, senior Alaskan {{officials were}} notified the previous February. After the devastating Great Alaska earthquake of March 27, 1964, the governor {{expressed concern about}} the psychological effects of the test on the populace. He was quickly reassured.|$|E
5|$|Amid {{the general}} {{euphoria}} in Poland – {{the acquisition of}} Teschen was a very popular development – no one {{paid attention to the}} bitter comment of the Czechoslovak general who handed the region over to the incoming Poles. He predicted that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> long before the Poles would themselves be handing Teschen over to the Germans.|$|E
5|$|Another two judges, Justice Brennan and Justice Dawson, dissented, Justice Brennan {{arguing that}} <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> proper for judges {{to use their}} power to adjourn trials to put {{pressure}} on the various legal aid agencies to change their decisions.|$|E

5|$|In {{the first}} week of January 2015, Sony {{announced}} The Interview would receive a wide theatrical release in the United Kingdom and Ireland on February 6, but <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> distributed digitally in the UK. The film became available for streaming on Netflix on January 24.|$|E
5|$|Screening for aneurysms is not {{performed}} on a population level; {{because they are}} relatively rare, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> cost-effective.

5|$|The {{premiere of}} The Watch {{took place on}} July 23, 2012 at Grauman's Chinese Theatre in Hollywood. It was {{released}} in North America on July 27, 2012. On July 25, Harkins Theatres (the sixth-largest North American cinema chain) announced <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> showing the film after failing to reach a financial agreement with Fox.|$|E

5|$|The {{route through}} the station will be busier from December 2014 to 2018 as Thameslink trains serving London Bridge will be {{diverted}} via Herne Hill– an additional four trains per hour in both directions. This {{is due to}} the redevelopment of London Bridge that will temporarily close it to Bedford-Brighton trains. The additional trains will not call at Herne Hill; they will run fast between London Blackfriars and East Croydon. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> possible for the 12-car peak trains to call at Herne Hill as the platforms are too short and <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> viable to use selective door operation as the carriages not on the platforms would foul the junctions.|$|E
5|$|With the Dodgers crowded outfield situation, Kemp was {{the subject}} of much trade {{speculation}} after the season. His agent, Dave Stewart, publicly stated that he expected Kemp to be traded during the off-season. However, Stewart later remarked that the team had assured him that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> making such a trade.|$|E
5|$|Ahead of the 2011 season, NFF and NTF {{stated that}} Superfinalen would be discontinued, {{stating that the}} {{championship}} was interesting neither from a sports nor from a commercial aspect. However, the two would-be qualified teams, league winner Rosenborg and cup winner Strømsgodset, were free to play a pre-season friendly, although <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> regarded as an official match. Rosenborg has traditionally played its final pre-season game against Viking and stated that they intended to take up that tradition following the abandoning of Superfinalen.|$|E

5|$|Casterman {{felt that}} the {{black-and-white}} volumes of The Adventures of Tintin were not selling as well as colour comic books, and thus that the series should be produced in colour. At the same time, Belgium was facing a paper-shortage, with Casterman wishing to cut down the volumes from 120-pages in length to 62. Hergé was initially sceptical, but ultimately agreed to their demands in February 1942. For these new editions, Casterman introduced a four-colour system, although Hergé insisted that colour should remain secondary to line, and that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> used for shading.|$|E
5|$|In June 2013, {{shortly after}} the game's main release, a PlayStation 4 version was announced; <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> {{released}} until January of the following year. In a January 2014 interview, Rollins mentioned internal discussions of creating a PlayStation Vita version of Don't Starve, citing massive community interest in playing it on the PlayStation 4 remotely. An iOS edition was released in July 2014. The company is also considering other mobile phone adaptations, {{as well as a}} potential sequel, but is not prioritizing them.|$|E
5|$|In {{a preview}} of the TGS demo, Ryan Geddes of IGN was left excited as to where the game would go after {{completing}} the demo, along with enjoying the improved visuals over Valkyria Chronicles II. Kotaku's Richard Eisenbeis was highly positive about the game, citing is story as a return to form after Valkyria Chronicles II and its gameplay being the best in the series. His main criticisms were its length and gameplay repetition, along with expressing regret that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> localized.|$|E

5|$|On {{his way to}} a still-standing {{track record}} of 1:59, Secretariat ran each quarter-mile segment faster than the one before it. The {{successive}} quarter-mile times were :25, :24, :23, :23, and :23. This means he was still accelerating as of the final quarter-mile of the race. No other horse had won the Derby in less than 2 minutes before, and <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> accomplished again until Monarchos ran the race in 1:59.97 in 2001.|$|E
5|$|Some {{major changes}} were {{introduced}} in a third watercolour painting (№ 238) which he made during the autumn of 1913. This version was given the text En drömsyn.

5|$|State Highway 168 {{was first}} {{proposed}} in 1931-1932, traveling from Campbellton in Atascosia County northeastward to Floresville in Wilson County before bending further eastward and terminating at SH 81. The proposal {{was listed as}} a conditional designation, meaning that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> maintained by the State Highway Commission. However, in late 1933, the portion from Campbellton to Floresville was cancelled, and SH 168 was rerouted to Pleasanton. As a result, SH 168 was cancelled and transferred to an extended SH 97. On September 26, 1939, SH 87 was designated to a road that followed the general course of present-day SH 168.|$|E
