5|$|The XF-104 had {{a radical}} wing design. Most {{supersonic}} jets use a swept or delta wing. This allows a reasonable balance between aerodynamic performance, lift, and internal space for fuel and equipment. However {{the most efficient}} shape for high-speed, supersonic flight had {{been found to be}} a small, straight, mid-mounted, trapezoidal wing of low aspect ratio and <b>high</b> <b>wing</b> loading. The wing was extremely thin, with a thickness-to-chord ratio of only 3.4%. The leading edges of the wing were so thin (0.016in/0.41mm) and so sharp that they presented a hazard to ground crews, and protective guards had to be installed during ground operations. The thinness of the wings meant that fuel tanks and landing gear had to be contained in the fuselage. The hydraulic actuators driving the ailerons were only one inch (25mm) thick to fit into the available space and were known as Piccolo actuators because of their resemblance to this musical instrument. The wings had electrically driven leading and trailing edge flaps to increase lift at low speed. The XF-104 did not feature the Boundary Layer Control System of the production aircraft.|$|E
25|$|The company's first design, {{introduced}} in 1992, was the InterPlane Griffon, a single-seat, strut-braced, <b>high</b> <b>wing</b> kit plane for the US FAR 103 Ultralight Vehicles category. The same year the company introduced the two seats in side-by-side configuration, strut-braced <b>high</b> <b>wing</b> InterPlane Skyboy, which was supplied {{only as a}} complete ready to fly aircraft. The Skyboy was accepted as a US light-sport aircraft and in Canada as an Advanced Ultralight Aeroplane.|$|E

50|$|Most {{kinds of}} bird wing can be grouped into four types, with some falling {{between two of}} these types. These types of wings are {{elliptical}} <b>wings,</b> <b>high</b> speed <b>wings,</b> <b>high</b> aspect ratio <b>wings</b> and soaring wings with slots.|$|R
50|$|The faster an {{aircraft}} flies, the more lift {{can be produced}} by each unit of wing area, so a smaller wing can carry the same mass in level flight. Consequently, faster aircraft generally have <b>higher</b> <b>wing</b> loadings than slower aircraft. This increased wing loading also increases takeoff and landing distances. A <b>higher</b> <b>wing</b> loading also decreases maneuverability. The same constraints apply to winged biological organisms.|$|R

50|$|One serious {{downside}} to these <b>higher</b> <b>wing</b> loadings is at low speed, when there isn't enough wing left to provide lift {{to keep the}} plane flying.
