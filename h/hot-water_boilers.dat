40|$|Flow, {{combustion}} {{and heat}} transfer in a grate fired furnace burning wood with a heating power of 1 MW has been analysed numerically using the CFD software FLUENT 6. 0. Such furnaces {{are used for}} example in <b>hot-water</b> <b>boilers</b> of real estate heating systems. The submodels of FLUENT are used for turbulence, for combustion of devolatilised fuel and for radiative heat transfer. The user-defined functions of FLUENT are used to incorporate a submodel for the description of drying, pyrolysis, combustion and gasification of wood on a grate. The grate submodel considers the interactions between the fuel bed and gas phase above the bed, and it predicts {{the temperature of the}} fuel bed and the temperature and the composition of the gas mixture released into the furnace from the bed. Subsequently, these are used to calculate the source terms for the flow modeling. The fuel bed model is employed together with the flow simulation. According to the results of the two simulation cases that are considered, minor changes to the construction of the present furnace could considerably reduce CO emissions. The predictions also show that the present fuel bed model is rather insensitive to the conditions of the gas phase above the bed but {{are more likely to be}} affected by the properties of the fuel bed.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work {{was to assess the}} feasibility of a photodiode to control combustion, instead of a spectrometer (which is an expensive sensor to be used in commercial burners). For that purpose, the flame emission has been measured in a <b>hot-water</b> <b>boiler</b> fired with light fuel-oil, whose nominal output power goes up to 370 kW. The parameters investigated were: overall air excess, combustion air distribution, burner power and atmospheric conditions. High influence of air distribution on the flame emission was detected by the diode, since it modifies directly the mixing quality reducing rich-fuel regions where soot can be formed. Low influence of air excess and burner power was found. When these parameters increase, the flame emission decreases. This behavior is explained by the better mixing attained at high burner power and at high air excess. However the high emission level observed at low firing rate can be reduced with a good burner adjustment. With the photodiode, it was possible to find the optimum air excess value where NO, CO and soot are as low as possible. As the photodiode measures locally in the flame, results were compared with images obtained with a CCD camera. Finally, these results are in good agreement with those obtained previously with the spectrometer...|$|R

This program led to the award {{of a number of}} cooperative agreements, including one to Control Techtronics International. The technical objective of CTI�s cooperative agreement is to apply combustion controls to existing boiler plants in Krakow and transfer knowledge and technology through a joint U.

Three of these were for domestic <b>hot-water</b> <b>boilers,</b> and two were for steam for industrial boilers. The following results have occurred due to the addition of CTI�s combustion controls on these five existing boilers: ! 25 % energy savings ! 85 % reduction in particulate emissions The joint venture company CTI-Polska was then established. Eleven additional technical and costing proposals were initiated to upgrade other coal boilers in Krakow. To date, no co-financing has been made available on the Polish side.

40|$|M. Ing. Scaling {{problems}} in a heating or cooling system can be recognised {{by one or more}} of the following symptoms. Reduction in heat transfer rate, in which the formation of an insulating deposit on a heat transfer surface significantly reduces the cooling or heating efficiency of the equipment. Reduced water flow, which results from a partial or complete blockage of pipelines, condenser tubes, or other openings. Even a small build-up of scale on a heat exchange surface reduces water flow. Scale may continue to build up in boilers until heat transfer is so low that the metal overheats, permitting the tubes to rapture under the operating pressure. Scale is usually found in water-handling equipment in which water is heated, i. e. <b>hot-water</b> storage tanks, <b>boilers,</b> etc. The magnitude of this problem may be appreciated by considering that scaling can cause degradation, or complete failure in thermal and hydraulic performance which increases initial and operating costs (Chan and Ghassemi, 1991). A fairly low-pressure boiler, with only 0. 6 mm of calcium sulphate scale on the tubes results in a 180 °C temperature drop. The cost involved due to heat transfer inefficiency and the removal of scale, in Britain alone, is estimated at £ 1 billion per annum (Darvill, 1993). Poor conductivity of a 25 mm thick CaC 03 scale layer can decrease the heat transfer by 95 % (Glater eta/., 1980), whereas a Si 02 scale layer 0. 5 mm thick results in a 90 % decrease in heat transfer (Grutsch and McClintock, 1984) ...|$|R
