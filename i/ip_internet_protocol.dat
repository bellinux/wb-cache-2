40|$|Abstract. The {{majority}} of today’s multimedia applications and content reside on the Internet. Since the <b>Internet</b> <b>Protocol</b> (<b>IP)</b> is the “glue ” {{that holds the}} Internet together, there is enormous interest in extending IP to multimedia mobile terminals. This would allow mobile terminals direct Internet access as well as access to intranet based multimedia. The current status of the emerging successor to <b>IP,</b> named Mobile <b>Internet</b> <b>Protocol</b> version 6 (MIPv 6), is examined in this paper. A quantitative estimate of MIPv 6 overhead is calculated and conclusions are drawn about the short-term evolution of MIPv 6 technology {{and its impact on}} the Mobile Ubiquitous Multimedia (MUM) industry...|$|R

As IP addresses may be considered public goods, {{it is important that}} they are allocated efficiently in order to comply in an equitable manner with the demands of all Internet participants. At the moment it is uncertain as to when, or even whether, <b>Internet</b> <b>Protocol</b> version 6 (IPv 6) will replace IPv 4.

The first generation of IP Intelligence {{was referred to as}} geotargeting or geolocation technology.

The second-generation ADT-2 standard defines iADT, use of the ADT protocol over <b>IP</b> (<b>Internet</b> <b>Protocol)</b> connections, such as over Ethernet.

40|$|This paper {{gives an}} outline and {{solutions}} to the problem of running RSVP signalling in Mobile <b>IP</b> (Mobile <b>Internet</b> <b>Protocol)</b> networks using optimised routing. First, we discuss a basic solution to this problem. By modifying RSVP at mobile and correspondent nodes to become aware of MIPv 6 addressing, we provide a simple repair that allows RSVP flows to be established between the fixed network and mobiles. Then, by adding optional objects to RSVP messages, a performance enhancement is proposed to make handovers smooth and seamless. A different technique to enhance performance is called flow extension which provides flows with fixed flow-ids from the correspondent node into the wireless access network at the expense of forwarding traffic inside the access network, whenever the mobile node moves. We conclude that the basic solution is a requirement in order to make MIPv 6 and RSVP interoperable. For well performing and uninterrupted operation we strongly recommend one of the performa [...] ...|$|R
50|$|In {{parallel}} {{with the development of}} the OSI model, a research network was being implemented by the United States Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). The internetworking protocol developed to support the network, called ARPAnet, was called TCP or Transmission Control Program. As research and development progressed {{and the size of the}} network grew, it was determined that the internetworking design that was being used was becoming unwieldy and it did not exactly follow the layered approach of the OSI Model. This led to the splitting of the original TCP and the creation of the TCP/IP architecture - TCP now standing for Transmission Control Protocol and <b>IP</b> standing for <b>Internet</b> <b>Protocol.</b>|$|R

50|$|In digital {{broadcasting}} systems, the analog audio signal is digitized, compressed using formats such as MP2, and transmitted using a digital modulation scheme. The {{aim is to}} increase the number of radio programs in a given spectrum, to improve the audio quality, to eliminate fading problems in mobile environments, to allow additional datacasting services, and to decrease the transmission power or the number of transmitters required to cover a region.

50|$|Corporate voice-mail did {{not change}} much until the advent of Voice over IP (VoIP—voice being {{transmitted}} over the internet) {{and the development of}} IP telephony applications to replace legacy PBX telephony (called TDM technologies). <b>IP</b> (<b>Internet</b> <b>Protocol)</b> telephony changed the style and technology of PBXs and the way voice-mail systems integrated with them. This, in turn, facilitated a new generation of Unified Messaging, which is now likely to catch on widely. The flexibility, manageability, lower costs, reliability, speed, and user convenience for messaging convergence is now possible where it wasn't before. This might include intra- and inter-enterprise contacts, mobile contacts, proactive application information delivery, and customer contact applications.|$|E

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} challenges in mobile <b>Internet</b> <b>Protocol</b> (<b>IP)</b> is to provide service for a mobile node to maintain its connectivity to network when it moves from one domain to another. IP is responsible for routing packets across network. The first major version of <b>IP</b> is the <b>Internet</b> <b>Protocol</b> version 4 (IPv 4). It is one of the dominant protocols relevant to wireless network. Later a newer version of IP called the IPv 6 was proposed. Mobile IPv 6 is mainly introduced for the purpose of mobility. Mobility management enables network to locate roaming nodes in order to deliver packets and maintain connections with them when moving into new domains. Handoff occurs when a mobile node moves from one network to another. It is a key factor of mobility because a mobile node can trigger several handoffs during a session.

30|$|Enabling the {{composition}} of functionally-compatible software components regardless of the technology they use and the protocols according to which they interact is a fundamental challenge in the Future Internet [1]. It {{has been the focus}} of extensive research, from approaches that identify the causes of interoperability issues and give guidelines on how to address them [2], to approaches that try to automate the application of such guidelines [3]. This challenge is exacerbated when heterogeneity spans the application, middleware, and network layers. At the application layer, components may exhibit disparate data types and operations, and may have distinct business logics. At the middleware layer, they may rely on different communication standards (e.g., SOAP and JMS) which define disparate data representation formats and induce different architectural constraints. Finally, at the network layer, data may be encapsulated differently according to the network technology in place. Heterogeneity at the network layer has partially been solved by convergence to a common standard (i.e., <b>IP</b> - <b>Internet</b> <b>Protocol).</b> In this paper, we focus on achieving interoperability across the application and middleware layers assuming the use of IP at the network layer.|$|R
