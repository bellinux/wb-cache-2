5|$|In Greek mythology, Auriga {{is often}} {{identified}} as the mythological Greek hero Erichthonius of Athens, the chthonic son of Hephaestus who was raised by the goddess Athena. Erichthonius was generally credited to be {{the inventor of the}} quadriga, the four-horse chariot, which he used in the battle against the usurper Amphictyon, the event that made Erichthonius the king of Athens. His chariot was created {{in the image of the}} Sun's chariot, the reason Zeus placed him in the heavens. The Athenian hero then dedicated himself to Athena and, soon after, Zeus raised him <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> <b>sky</b> in honor of his ingenuity and heroic deeds.|$|E

The UFO, joining a group of three other UFOs, is pursued by Neary and three police cars, but the spacecraft fly off <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> <b>sky.</b> Roy becomes fascinated by UFOs, much to the dismay of his wife, Ronnie. He also becomes increasingly obsessed with subliminal, mental images of a mountain-like shape and begins to make models of it. Jillian also becomes obsessed with sketching a unique-looking mountain. Soon after, she is terrorized in her home by a UFO which descends from the clouds. The presence of the UFO energy field makes every appliance in Jillian's house malfunction and Barry is abducted by unseen beings.|$|E

Searching more for a learned appreciation of nature and our exact place within the cosmos than academic scientific knowledge, science and travel writer Jamie Carter takes the reader on a 12 month tour of <b>the</b> <b>night</b> <b>sky's</b> incredible annual rhythms that say so much about Earth. During the journey he learns about the celestial mechanics {{at work in the}} skies above that are – to the beginner – almost beyond belief. As well as the vital constellations and clusters, and the weird and wonderful nebulas, he searches out “dark sky destinations” across the globe that help increase knowledge and give a new perspective on familiar <b>night</b> <b>sky</b> sights. On <b>the</b> journey he witnesses a solar eclipse and grapples with star-charts, binoculars, smartphone apps, telescopes, spots satellites and attempts basic astro-photography.   By year's end, the reader will be able to glance at <b>the</b> <b>night</b> <b>sky</b> from anywhere on the planet and tell what direction he or she is facing, what time it is, where all the planets are and even where the Galactic Center Point is. ...|$|R

The mother, Victoire, came out but she too could see nothing. The boys’ parents could not see what their children were seeing that night and called for Sister Vitaline, the local school teacher. She, like the boys’ parents, could also not see the apparition, and called for two girls, Françoise Richer and Jeanne-Marie Lebosse, aged nine and eleven. Sister Vitaline suggested that perhaps Our Lady was visible only to the children. Without any knowledge of the apparition, these two girls looked <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> <b>sky</b> and began describing Our Lady in the same exact detail as the Barbedette boys had described.|$|E

However, it was later announced that the video would premiere the following day on August 25, 2011. The video premiered officially via iTunes and VEVO on August 26, 2011. A 15-second teaser video was released the day before it officially premiered, and featured Rihanna applying make-up before taking to the stage, as well as fans screaming her name while fireworks were launched <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> <b>sky.</b> The video was directed and edited by New York based director Evan Rogers and Ciara Pardo.|$|E
500|$|F/L Currie and F/O Rose saw a V-2 rocket {{in flight}} {{on the night}} of 10/11 September, the first Canadian pilots to do so. While on patrol from Brussels to Antwerp and Rotterdam they saw a bright orange light {{directly}} ahead and seemingly at their own altitude, [...] At first glance, Currie paid no attention to it, taking it for a bright star. Suddenly, Currie said: [...] "It began to climb – hell it climbed!" [...] The light appeared to go straight up so rapidly that within a few seconds it had passed out of sight. On return to base, the crew reported the sighting as a V-1 flying bomb, but their account of the spectacular rate of climb and other details aroused great interest amongst senior officers. That night, a few moments after Currie and Rose had made their sighting, a V-2 rocket crashed onto the English coast. Two nights later, F/Os Fullerton and Gallagher saw a similar ball of yellow flame streak vertically <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> <b>sky,</b> and {{in the weeks that followed}} there were many other reports.|$|E
5000|$|During glacial periods, {{there is}} clear {{evidence}} for intense aridity due to water {{being held in}} glaciers and their associated effects on climate. The mammoth steppe was like a huge 'inner court' that was surrounded on all sides by moisture-blocking features: massive continental glaciers, high mountains, and frozen seas. These kept rainfall low and created more days with clear skies than are seen today, which increased evaporation in the summer leading to aridity, and radiation of warmth from <b>the</b> ground <b>into</b> <b>the</b> black <b>night</b> <b>sky</b> in <b>the</b> winter leading to cold.

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Always Be My Baby" [...] {{was the second}} video Carey's directed. In it, she is the {{seemingly}} happy narrator of a tale of young love, {{as a young boy}} and a girl elope in the middle of <b>the</b> <b>night.</b> <b>The</b> video was filmed on location at Carey's sponsored charity, the Fresh Air Fund upstate New York camp. The video begins with scenes of Carey on a lakeside tire-swing, smiling and beginning to retell a story of young love. As she sits upon the swing, scenes of two children sneaking out of their bungalow in the middle of <b>the</b> <b>night</b> are shown. They frolic together beside a fireplace, soon coming up to the lakeside swing Carey had been on before. They soon go swimming wearing their clothes, much like Carey did in her video for [...] "Dreamlover" [...] though she does not jump <b>into</b> <b>the</b> water herself this time. As they jump <b>into</b> <b>the</b> water, Carey is then seen by the campfire they passed on their journey to the lake, smiling with friends and enjoying herself by the fire. Eventually the boy and girl are seen kissing underwater. The video concludes with scenes of the young boy and girl walking together back to their bungalow, walking hand-in-hand. Having possibly witnessed the entire event, Carey is seen once again by the large swing, chuckling and staring <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>night's</b> <b>sky.</b>|$|R

500|$|He {{heads to}} her house, which is eerily quiet. Going in, he discovers {{a bottle of}} whiskey, several {{cigarette}} butts, and a telegram from the government. Dorothy's husband is dead, his plane shot down over France. Dorothy comes out of her bedroom, crying, and Hermie tells her [...] "I'm sorry." [...] The sense of empathy triggers her to channel to Hermie some of her loneliness. She turns on the record player and invites Hermie to dance with her. They kiss and embrace, tears on both their faces. Without speaking, and to the sound only of the waves, they move to the bedroom, where she draws him into bed and gently makes love with him. Afterward, withdrawing again into her world of hurt, Dorothy retires to the porch, leaving Hermie alone in her bedroom. He approaches her on the porch, where she can only quietly say [...] "Good night, Hermie." [...] He leaves, his last image of Dorothy being of her leaning against the railing, as she smokes a cigarette and stares <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> <b>sky.</b>|$|E
500|$|The {{video is}} set in a forest; Jackson, in scruffy clothes, sings [...] "Childhood" [...] while sitting on a tree stump. The camera moves up the trees <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> <b>sky</b> and flying {{airships}} travel overhead. On board the ships, children are seen playing a variety of games as they travel further away from Jackson, towards the moon. Other children appear in the forest undergrowth before floating up towards the airships, but Jackson remains seated on the tree stump. Although the concept of the video had little in common with the corresponding film, Free Willy 2, two of its actors-Jason James Richter and Francis Capra-appear in the video. Richter appears halfway through, leading the armada of airships. Capra appears {{near the end of the}} video alongside Jackson as he watches the airships above. Richter looks down and sees him and extends his arm to bring him up to the airship as Capra floats upward toward it. Erika Christensen and Jena Malone also appeared in the video playing baseball. The video for [...] "Childhood" [...] is 4:27 minutes long. In the publication, Doug Pratt's DVD: Movies, Television, Music, Art, Adult, and More!, Pratt describes the video as [...] "outstanding, a Chris Van Allsburg-style vision of children in flying airships, crusading through a forest at night".|$|E
500|$|... "My All" [...] and the [...] "My All/Stay Awhile" [...] (So So Def Remix) {{featured}} different music videos. The {{video for}} [...] "My All" [...] was shot entirely {{in black and}} white in Puerto Rico, and was directed by fashion photographer Herb Ritts. The video begins with Carey lying on an overturned vessel on a beach, staring <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> <b>sky,</b> lamenting her estranged lover. As the scenes progress, Carey's love interest is seen atop a lighthouse {{in the middle of the}} ocean, searching for his lost companion. Further scenes show Carey laying on a large conch shell, wet and vulnerable. Soon after, she begins walking on a path of large white flowers, until she reaches the top of the lighthouse where she is rejoined with her lover. After the song's second verse, Carey and the man begin caressing each other, and embracing atop the lighthouse. After they share an intimate moment, Carey is shown walking back on the trail of white flowers, smiling and happy. The scenes of Carey lying in the shell and in front of the flowers were inspired by Sandro Botticelli's painting The Birth of Venus. According to author Chris Nickson, the snippets of Carey on the overturned vessel showed her vulnerability without her loved one, truly highlighting the yearning emphasized in the song.|$|E

2500|$|According to one Greek myth, Pisces {{represents}} the fish, sometimes represented by koi fish, into which Aphrodite (also considered Venus) {{and her son}} Eros (also considered Cupid) transformed in order to escape the monster Typhon.

A similar myth, one which the fish [...] "Pisces" [...] carry Aphrodite and her son out of danger, is resounded in Manilius' five volume poetic work Astronomica: [...] "Venus ow'd her safety to their Shape." [...] Another myth is that an egg fell into the Euphrates river. It was then rolled to the shore by fish. Doves sat on the egg until it hatched, out from which came Aphrodite. As a sign of gratitude towards the fish, Aphrodite put the fish <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> <b>sky.</b> Because of these myths, the Pisces constellation was also known as [...] "Venus et Cupido," [...] "Venus Syria cum Cupidine," [...] "Venus cum Adone," [...] "Dione," [...] and [...] "Veneris Mater," [...] the latter being the formal Latin term for mother.|$|E
