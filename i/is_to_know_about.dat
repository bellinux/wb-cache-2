He would issue video game challenges and answered questions on cheats and tips. The show's host, Dominik Diamond, claimed that Moore did not understand anything that he said on the show, yet managed to record his contributions in single takes.|$|E
5|$|The {{goal of this}} {{executive}} order is to help address questions about favoritism in city contracting by preventing conflicts of interest, or even the appearance of such conflicts.... There should be a level playing field, where no one has an advantage—or a disadvantage—in obtaining city contracts, simply because they know me or anyone else in government.... Under the steps I'm taking today and recommending to the City Council, the public can easily learn everything there <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>about</b> a city contract: who is involved, who will benefit and whether the city is paying a fair price. I and every other city official {{must be prepared to}} defend every contract on its merits.|$|E
5|$|After his {{baseball}} career ended, Paciorek {{returned to school}} and {{earned a degree in}} physical education from the University of Houston, a degree that he began to pursue while recovering from back surgery. While acquiring his degree, he became a Christian Scientist and married Linda Cupp. After graduating from college, he spent several years as an instructor at a Jewish community center, then became a physical education teacher after inquiring about a Christian Science Monitor advertisement for a teaching position at Clairbourn School in San Gabriel, California. Linda died of breast cancer in 1987, and Paciorek married Karen Purdy two years later. Paciorek has four sons and four daughters. His nephew, Joey Paciorek, played in the Milwaukee Brewers minor league organization, and his sons, Pete and Mack, had minor league careers as well. While watching his son in training camp, Paciorek became an author after watching what he felt was improper instruction given to the players. He has since written two books, Plato & Socrates, Baseball's Wisest Fans and The Principle of Baseball, and All There <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>Know</b> <b>About</b> Hitting.|$|E

25|$|If Mary {{really does}} know {{everything}} physical there <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>about</b> {{the experience of}} color, then this effectively grants her almost omniscient powers of knowledge. Using this, she {{will be able to}} deduce her own reaction, and figure out exactly what the experience of seeing red will feel like.|$|E
25|$|Frank Jackson {{formulated}} his well-known knowledge argument {{based upon}} similar considerations. In this thought experiment, known as Mary's room, he {{asks us to}} consider a neuroscientist, Mary, who was born, and has lived all of her life, in {{a black and white}} room with a black and white television and computer monitor where she collects all the scientific data she possibly can on the nature of colours. Jackson asserts that as soon as Mary leaves the room, she will come to have new knowledge which she did not possess before: the knowledge of the experience of colours (i.e., what they are like). Although Mary knows everything there <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>about</b> colours from an objective, third-person perspective, she has never known, according to Jackson, {{what it was like to}} see red, orange, or green. If Mary really learns something new, it must be knowledge of something non-physical, since she already knew everything about the physical aspects of colour.|$|E
25|$|The boat {{is first}} {{directly}} addressed in chapter 43; there Gangleri asks that, if Skíðblaðnir {{is the best}} of ships, what there <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>about</b> it, and asks if there is no other ship as good or as large as it. High responds that while Skíðblaðnir is the finest ship and the most ingeniously created, the biggest ship is in fact Naglfar, which is owned by Muspell. The Sons of Ivaldi, who High adds are dwarfs, crafted the ship and gave it to Freyr. High continues that the ship is big enough for all of the gods to travel aboard it with wargear and weapons in tow, and that, as soon as its sail is hoisted, the ship finds good wind, and goes wherever it need be. It is made up of so many parts and with such craftsmanship that, when it is not needed at sea, it may be folded up like cloth and placed into one's pocket. Gangleri comments that Skíðblaðnir sounds like a great ship, and that it must have taken a lot of magic to create something like it.|$|E

500|$|It was Sarah, Duchess of York, who {{conceived}} {{the idea for}} a film based upon the early years of Queen Victoria. She had been interested in the queen since her marriage to Prince Andrew, Duke of York, a great-great-great-grandson of Victoria and Albert, and had written two books about her {{with the help of an}} historian. The Victoria-Albert relationship in particular drew her into the queen's history, as she believed there were parallels between their marriage and her own with Prince Andrew, as they both [...] "fought for their love" [...] in the midst of public scrutiny. A friend set up a meeting with producer Graham King, to whom she pitched the idea along with several others. At the time wrapping up his work on The Departed, King, a native of Britain, had been looking for a project set in his home country for years. The producer later remembered, [...] "she pitched me a bunch of things, and among them was a three-page synopsis of Victoria’s early life: the precise span covered in The Young Victoria. [...] just fell into place." [...] King brought frequent collaborator Martin Scorsese on board as a co-executive producer, as the Academy Award-winning director knew [...] "pretty much all there <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>about</b> British history".|$|E

2500|$|If qualia of {{this sort}} exist, then a {{normally}} sighted person who sees red {{would be unable to}} describe the experience of this perception {{in such a way that}} a listener who has never experienced color will be able to know everything there <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>about</b> that experience. Though it is possible to make an analogy, such as [...] "red looks hot", or to provide a description of the conditions under which the experience occurs, such as [...] "it's the color you see when light of 700-nm wavelength is directed at you", supporters of this kind of qualia contend that such a description is incapable of providing a complete description of the experience.|$|E

2500|$|Former {{president}} of Sarah Lawrence College, Michele Tolela Myers, responded to Michael Skube's rebuttal in the 12 July 2007 Letter to the Editor for the Los Angeles Times, [...] "Argument {{may be a}} rank disgrace." [...] On the general topic of U.S. News methodology, she states, [...] "what many of us dispute is the validity of a single score computed by using [...] "data points" [...] to which weights are arbitrarily ascribed (why should retention count for 20% instead of 30%; why is peer assessment 25% instead of 10%; and who decides?). How can a single measure be valid when, in some cases, values are made up {{when they are not}} provided (the case of the missing SATs at Sarah Lawrence — the point of my Washington Post Op-Ed)? However, that's exactly what U.S. News does each year. Professional statisticians have reported that the methodology used by the magazine is seriously flawed and cannot be trusted." [...] She also responds to Skube's discussion of Sarah Lawrence's decision not to consider SAT or ACT scores by stating, [...] "Skube says he knows 'all he needs to know about Sarah Lawrence' because the college does not use SAT scores in its admission process, and therefore he infers we don't take aptitude seriously. Perhaps he doesn't know the research showing that SAT tests do not measure aptitude and at best provide a guess about academic performance {{in the first year of}} college. I do not think Elon University's SAT scores tell all there <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>about</b> Elon. To think so would be falling into the trap of using one single measure as a proxy for the complex nature of any college. Which is precisely why the rankings are flawed." ...|$|E
