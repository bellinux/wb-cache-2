He highlighted weaknesses in the manual and Sinclair's accompanying software, criticising them for [...] "a misconceived design and sloppiness in execution which make the machine seem harder to use and more limited than it should" [...] and questioned whether {{it might be more}} worthwhile to save up for a more powerful computer such as Acorn or Commodore's offerings. Overall, he concluded, the ZX81 might have a limited value in helping to teach BASIC programming and overcoming psychological barriers to computing, but [...] "the Sinclair systems <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>way</b> to go before they raise the quality and level of understanding of the nature and use of computer-based information systems among computer unbelievers." ...|$|E

2500|$|At age 81 Parks {{was robbed}} and {{assaulted}} {{in her home}} in central Detroit on August 30, 1994. The assailant, Joseph Skipper, broke down the door but claimed he had chased away an intruder. He requested a reward and when Parks paid him, he demanded more. Parks refused and he attacked her. Hurt and badly shaken, Parks called a friend, who called the police. A neighborhood manhunt led to Skipper's capture and reported beating. Parks was treated at Detroit Receiving Hospital for facial injuries and swelling {{on the right side}} of her face. Parks said about the attack on her by the African-American man, [...] "Many gains have been made ... But as you can see, at this time we still <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>way</b> to go."

2500|$|MacNeish’s {{ultimate}} {{goal was to}} make archaeology more of a science. [...] He was a processual archaeologist who championed the necessity of experimental archaeology and hypothesis testing in the exploration of human cultural ecology. [...] By adopting, creating or championing methods that made archaeological results more generalizable and amenable to hypothesis testing MacNeish was attempting to learn, and teach, about the broader patterns of social change that can inform our choices in the future; he wished to use archaeology to improve the human condition. [...] “…laws of cultural change may be of use not only in explaining the past, but more important, in predicting the future or at least indicating the steps in cultural change we might take in the future”. [...] His ultimate legacy, {{the sum total of}} all of his individual accomplishments in methodology and theory, was his commitment to archaeology as a science that could produce laws and theories to aid humanity in the future. In his autobiographical discussion of American archaeology (1978), MacNeish writes, “We are still fumbling along, perfecting techniques as well as improving methodology, and our field – as well as I – <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>way</b> to go”.|$|E
2500|$|In present day, the {{residents}} discover that Grif has disappeared, but Arthur, {{who had his}} squire killed, kept silent about his [...] "whereabouts." [...] Henry, on the other hand, believes {{the only way to}} stay positive in light of all this is to hold a dance, which in turn was a way to ask Violet out. At the same time, Emma continues to make a real man out of Gold without telling him exactly why she needed him. Gold tried to tell Emma that being the Dark One would cost her the ones she loved, but she didn’t want to listen. She then brings in Merida to do her bidding and sends them to the woods. Emma, heeding Gold's words, was having second thoughts about everything as she went to her shed full of dreamcatchers and cried. As they arrive in the woods, Merida began putting Gold to work on making him a hero, but he is shown to be weak, which infuriated the Scottish archer from DunBroch. She then finds something that he can fight for by showing him Belle's chipped teacup, then taunts Gold on how cowardly he was, even to Belle. Gold immediately takes the sword and swings at Merida, who stops and tells him that what he did was an act of bravery, he was not thinking about himself or his limp: he was thinking of her. But, [...] she also says that they <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>way</b> to go so they can kill Emma.|$|E
2500|$|Mercy {{is one of}} four {{characters}} {{created by}} a team of 13 writers aged between 17 and 22 for the Internet spin-off series EastEnders: E20. The characters were created in August 2009 and open auditions were held for the cast at Theatre Royal Stratford East. Mojekwu's casting was announced on 25 November 2009, on which she commented: [...] "I feel so blessed to be part of EastEnders: E20. My first day on set was just crazy. I was on Albert Square—a dream come true—I'm enjoying every second." [...] When Mojekwu was asked in an interview with media website Digital Spy how she felt about being the only main cast member from EastEnders: E20 not appearing in EastEnders, she said: [...] "If I was meant to go into the main show, then I would have done. Obviously I'd have loved to but for someone like my character, it'll be the support of the viewers that decide her fate. I don't feel upset or anything, I just thought that it's the way these things go." [...] It was announced on 24 January 2010 that Mercy would appear in EastEnders later in 2010. Executive producer Diederick Santer said that once he had seen the completed episodes of EastEnders: E20, he wanted Mercy in the main show as well, and stated: [...] "Mercy's also been a huge hit with E20 viewers—she's funny, warm, sensitive and rather mysterious. [...] I'm delighted Bunmi will be bringing those qualities to the wider EastEnders audience." [...] Mercy and her grandmother Grace's introduction to EastEnders made them the first Nigerian family to appear in the series. Mojekwu was surprised at how long it took the programme to represent her community in the series, but congratulated them for doing so, saying [...] "they <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>way</b> to go in representing us." [...] Mercy's younger sister Faith Olubunmi was introduced in series 3 of E20.|$|E
