Cope and team were approached by Florida businessman Don Arnold and his team, Arnold Motorsports, for a merger. Cope had attempted the 2003 finale at Homestead, but failed to qualify. The merger consisted of the 79 and 37 teams merging to create the No. 50 Arnold Motorsports Dodge. The team used Cope's 2003 Owner Points, to ensure {{a better chance of}} making races, as well as Cope's equipment. Cope successfully made the Daytona 500, but crashed and finished 30th. A few weeks later at Darlington, Cope qualified 5th, ran up front the {{majority of the}} race, but a pit road issue relegated the team to a 25th place finish. After the Coca-Cola 600, Cope and Arnold Split, with Cope taking his equipment away from the team, but leaving Arnold with the points.

40|$|In {{the early}} 1990 s, UCAR {{fabricated}} a snowfall simulator {{that they have}} used to test deicing fluids for aircraft, among other applications. Ice cores are actuated by a stepper motor and travel along a linear guide rail feeding it into an auger bit. This bit shaves the ice core, creating conditions that simulate snowfall. Currently, the simulator is in satisfactory operating condition, however upgrades have been proposed to make the simulator more user <b>friendly.</b> When one <b>ice</b> core has been exhausted, the motor controlling the carriage must be actuated in reverse to move the mount along a lead screw back to reloading position, which can take upwards of three minutes. The purpose of this project is to retrofit the simulator with a quick release system that allows for the user to manually unlock the carriage and quickly pull {{it back into the}} reloading position, decreasing turn around time in the testing process. The final design is a symmetric 2 -clamp system that is installed directly onto the ice core mount. The two clamps engage the lead screw from the left and the right. To reload the ice cores, the user must simply lift the Destaco clamps on each side and pull the entire carriage back to the original position {{at the front of the}} simulator...|$|R
