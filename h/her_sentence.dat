5|$|Kinne's appeal, {{rather than}} {{overturning}} <b>her</b> <b>sentence,</b> lengthened it. The three-man superior court which heard her case overturned {{one aspect of}} her conviction—charges of attempted robbery—but upheld her murder conviction and increased <b>her</b> <b>sentence</b> from ten to thirteen years, saying that her original sentence had been too lenient.|$|E

Lawyers familiar with clemency applications stated in December 2016 that the pardon was unlikely to happen; the request did not fit into the usual criteria.|$|E

According to Dr. Marilyn Hutchinson, Green was immature and lacked the adult-level {{ability to cope}} with emotion. Green read another statement to the court and {{was formally}} sentenced to two concurrent forty-year prison sentences, minus the one hundred and ninety-one days she had already served. Green is serving <b>her</b> <b>sentence</b> at the Topeka Correctional Facility. , Kansas Department of Corrections records show her earliest possible release date as November 21, 2035—when she will be 84 years old.|$|E
5|$|In 1962, as {{a result}} of Wise's good {{behavior}} in prison, Ohio governor Michael DiSalle commuted Wise's sentence to second-degree murder and she was paroled at age 79. Wise's remaining family refused to take her in, and a number of rest homes for the elderly similarly declined her residency; within three days Wise returned to prison, lacking anywhere else to go. Her parole and the commutation of <b>her</b> <b>sentence</b> were revoked. Wise died in prison on June 28, 1971.|$|E

5|$|Lady Jane Grey was the {{great-granddaughter}} of Henry VII {{through his}} youngest daughter Mary Tudor, and first cousin once removed to his grandson, King Edward VI. After Edward's death, a Protestant faction proclaimed her queen over Henry VIII's daughters, hoping {{to prevent the}} Catholic Mary Tudor from taking the throne. Two weeks {{after the death of}} her brother, Mary, {{with the support of the}} English people, claimed the throne, which Jane relinquished only nine days after being installed. She and her husband, Lord Guildford Dudley, were imprisoned in the Tower of London on charges of high treason. Jane's trial was conducted in November, but <b>her</b> <b>sentence</b> of death was suspended. In February 1554, Jane's father Henry, who had been pardoned, participated in Wyatt's rebellion. On 12 February, Mary had Jane, then aged 16, and her husband beheaded; Jane's father suffered the same fate two days later.|$|E
5|$|On 6 September 2006, it was {{revealed}} {{that as a result of}} appeals brought by prosecutors and heard by the Supreme Court, Chen had the death penalty reimposed after his reduced sentence of life imprisonment was overturned. Rush, Nguyen and Norman also had their appeal verdicts overturned and the death penalty imposed. The new death sentences were unexpected. Prosecutors, in their appeals against the 20-year terms faced by most of the nine, had only called for them to be upgraded to life imprisonment. Czugaj's life sentence, after being reduced to 20 years on appeal, was reinstated. Stephens' life sentence was upheld on appeal as were Sukumaran's and Chan's death sentences. Lawrence had not lodged a further appeal to her 20-year sentence, so <b>her</b> <b>sentence</b> was not rejudged.|$|E
5|$|After serving <b>her</b> <b>sentence,</b> she was {{deported}} to Canada, something which left her feeling bitter. There, Max Hyatt, the gothi of the Asatru Alliance-affiliated group Wodan's Kindred, {{invited her to}} live {{at his home in}} Vancouver Island, British Columbia. However, after personal and political differences surfaced, Christensen left Hyatt's home and moved into an RV park in Parksville, Vancouver Island, where she lived in a small trailer. Despite being far less involved in Odinic activities than she had been previously, she set about trying to revive the Odinist Fellowship. In 1998 she began publication of Midgard Page, which was produced in both paper and electronic copies, the latter of which was housed on Hyatt's Wodansdaeg Press website. During her later years, she became more moderate in her views, encouraging a cultural change among Aryans rather than political actions. This contrasted with the more radical views of newer groups like Wotansvolk, who embraced militant action to bring about socio-political change. She died on May 4, 2005.|$|E

5|$|On December 7, 1969, Kinne was {{not present}} for a routine 5 p.m. {{roll-call}} at the Ixtapalapan prison where she was serving <b>her</b> <b>sentence,</b> but her absence was not officially noted until she also {{failed to show up}} at a second roll-call later that evening. The news of her disappearance was not reported to Mexico City police until 2 a.m. the following morning. A manhunt was then arranged, initially focusing on the northern Mexican states due to authorities' belief that Kinne may have been heading for the last known whereabouts of a former inmate to whom she had grown close while they were in prison together, but also encompassing country-wide transport hubs and eventually circling back to the Mexico City area. American authorities, including the FBI, were also alerted of Mexican authorities' belief that Kinne may have been attempting to work her way back into her native country, but the FBI noted that it was unlikely to have jurisdiction in the case.|$|E
5|$|Salim {{rebels and}} amasses an army to confront Akbar and rescue Anarkali. Defeated in battle, Salim is {{sentence}}d to death by his father, but is told that the sentence will be revoked if Anarkali, now in hiding, is handed over to die in his place. Anarkali gives herself up to save the prince's life, and is condemned to death by being entombed alive. Before <b>her</b> <b>sentence</b> is carried out, she begs {{to have a few}} hours with Salim as his make-believe wife. Her request is granted, as she has agreed to drug Salim so that he cannot interfere with her entombment. As Anarkali is being walled up, Akbar is reminded that he still owes her mother a favour, as it was she who brought him news of Salim's birth. Anarkali's mother pleads for her daughter's life. The emperor has a change of heart, but although he wants to release Anarkali he cannot, because of his duty to his country. He therefore arranges for her secret escape into exile with her mother, but demands that the pair are to live in obscurity, and that Salim is never to know that Anarkali is still alive.|$|E
5|$|His exile over, Vladimir {{was banned}} from Saint Petersburg, instead {{settling}} in Pskov, {{a small town}} two hours' train ride from the capital, in February 1900. His wife, who had not served the entirety of <b>her</b> <b>sentence,</b> remained in exile in Ufa, where she fell ill. Intent on founding a newspaper, Vladimir and Struve raised money for the publication of Iskra (The Spark), a new organ of the Russian Marxist movement, now calling itself the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (RSDLP). After visiting his wife, on 29 July 1900, Vladimir left Russia for Western Europe. In Switzerland and Germany, he met with Axelrod, Plekhanov and Potresov, and lectured on the Russian situation. On 24 August 1900, a conference of Russian Marxists {{was held in the}} Swiss town of Corsier to discuss Iskra, but both Vladimir and Potresov were shocked at Plekhanov's controlling nature and antisemitism. It was agreed that the paper would be produced in Munich, where Vladimir moved in September 1900. The first issue was printed on Christmas Eve, and contained an article written by Vladimir decrying European intervention in the Boxer Rebellion. A second RSDLP publication, Zarya, appeared in March 1901, and would run for four issues, but Iskra was far more successful, being smuggled into Russia illegally, becoming the most successful Russian underground publication for 50 years. It contained contributions from such figures as the Polish Rosa Luxemburg, the Czech-German Karl Kautsky, and a young Ukrainian Marxist, Leon Trotsky, who became a regular contributor from the autumn of 1902.|$|E

5|$|In 1997, the ICTY {{secretly}} indicted Arkan for {{war crimes}} carried out in Sanski Most in 1995, but not for those in Bijeljina. In January 2000, {{he was killed in}} a Belgrade hotel lobby by masked gunmen, and did not face trial. In 1999, Milošević was indicted for carrying out a genocidal campaign that included Bijeljina and other locations in Bosnia and Herzegovina, among other charges, but he died mid-trial in March 2006. In February 2000, Plavšić and Momčilo Krajišnik, the speaker of the National Assembly of Republika Srpska, were indicted for the same genocidal campaign in Bosnia and Herzegovina, among other charges. On 2 October 2002, Plavšić pleaded guilty to persecuting the non-Serb populations in 37 municipalities in Bosnia and Herzegovina, including Bijeljina. This plea was entered under an agreement that involved the prosecution moving to dismiss the remaining charges. She was subsequently sentenced to 11 years imprisonment. On 27 September 2006, Krajišnik was found guilty on a five counts of crimes against humanity, including the same count as Plavšić regarding the persecution of non-Serb populations in municipalities including Bijeljina, but he was found not guilty of genocide. In 2009, he was handed a twenty-year prison sentence. After serving two-thirds of <b>her</b> <b>sentence,</b> Plavšić was released in October 2009. Krajišnik was released in August 2013, having served two-thirds of his sentence (including time spent in custody).|$|E
