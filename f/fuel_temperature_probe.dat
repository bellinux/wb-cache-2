The purpose {{of this research is}} to design and develop a new data logger to monitor general car performance. Data has been collected via a wireless device attached to the car, which transmits information to the base station. The data logger (data acquisition processor) was developed based on an 8 -bit Single-Chip Microcontroller. Speed, revs, <b>fuel</b> levels and <b>temperature</b> <b>probes</b> placed in the experimental car provided the required information. The information was then processed by the data acquisition processor before being transmitted to a computer via an RLM 3000 -Radio Link Modem. Laboratory results of the data logger for different speeds, revs and fuel levels are presented and discussed herein...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{droplet size}} {{distribution}} and in-cylinder mixture {{formation of a}} slit injector were investigated under varied <b>fuel</b> <b>temperature</b> and air flow conditions. This variance in <b>fuel</b> <b>temperature</b> and air flow represents the altered spray momentum and external forces acting upon the spray. Phase Doppler anemometry (PDA) was used to investigate the effect of <b>fuel</b> <b>temperature</b> and air flow on droplet size distribution. The in-cylinder mixture formation process and the factors affecting the in-cylinder mixture distribution were analyzed under various <b>fuel</b> <b>temperature</b> and air flow conditions using laser induced fluorescence (LIF). When the <b>fuel</b> <b>temperature</b> and air flow velocity increased, the smaller droplets were entrained to the upper and central parts of the spray altering the initial droplet size distribution. The reduced spray momentum decreased the spray penetration in the combustion chamber, and {{the interaction between the}} spray and piston bowl was degraded. This phenomenon eventually caused a relatively lean and dispersed mixture distribution near the spark plug at high <b>fuel</b> <b>temperatures.</b> The optimal spray momentum and external force depend on the fuel quantity (air-fuel ratio) and piston bowl shape. Consequently, the spray momentum and the external forces acting upon the spray should be optimized to form the stoichiometric and well-distributed mixture near the spark plug. 1...|$|R

40|$|Extensive {{literature}} {{exists on}} spray development, mixing and combustion regarding engine modeling and diagnostics using single-component and model fuels. However, often {{the variation in}} data between different fuels, particularly relating to spray development {{and its effect on}} combustion, is neglected or overlooked. By injecting into a quiescent chamber, this work quantifies the differences in spray development from a multi-hole direct-injection spark-ignition engine injector for two single-component fuels (iso-octane and n-pentane), a non-fluorescing multi-component model fuel which may be used for in-cylinder Laser Induced Fluorescence experiments, and several grades of pump gasoline (with and without additives). High-speed recordings of the sprays were made for a range of <b>fuel</b> <b>temperatures</b> and gas pressures. It is shown that a <b>fuel</b> <b>temperature</b> above that of the lowest boiling point fraction of the tested fuel at the given gas pressure causes a convergence of the spray plumes. Increasing the <b>fuel</b> <b>temperature</b> increases this convergence, whilst an associated increased rate of evaporation tends to reduce the penetration of individual plumes. The convergence increases gradually with increasing <b>fuel</b> <b>temperature</b> until all plumes combine to form a single wider plume with a penetration rate greater than that of the individual plumes. When all plumes are converged to form a single plume along a central axis to all the plumes, any further increase in <b>fuel</b> <b>temperature</b> at the given gas pressure acts to increase the rate of evaporation of the fuel. At experiments up to 180 °C <b>fuel</b> <b>temperature</b> and down to 0. 3 bar absolute gas pressure, none of the tested fuels were found to spontaneously vaporize; all observed spray formations being a gradual evolution. Increasing the gas pressure at any given <b>fuel</b> <b>temperature,</b> leads to an increase in the boiling temperature of all components of that fuel and, hence, diminishes these effects.

This paper describes the rig experimental tests {{to assess the}} high <b>fuel</b> <b>temperature</b> effect on combustor emissions. A special test rig facility has been designed and set up for emission measurements with preheated fuel. The purpose of the tests is to evaluate the combustor emission characteristics under nominal and elevated <b>fuel</b> <b>temperatures.</b> The scope of the project is two fold: (1) to design, procure and establish a dedicated hot fuel deoxygenation, fuel preheat facility that can reach temperature up to 600 0 F (589 K); (2) to measure combustion emissions, mainly NOx, CO and UHC, at normal and elevated <b>fuel</b> <b>temperature</b> under representative engine operating conditions. The test rig has run for extended duration and proved reliable over the whole test campaign. Measured emission results show that <b>fuel</b> <b>temperature</b> effect on NOx, CO, UHC emissions are marginal, possibly due to the low emission capability of the sector combustor that is less sensitive to fuel inlet condition changes than other combustor designs.
