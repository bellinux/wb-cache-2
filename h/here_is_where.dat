25|$|The Prince {{then goes}} into the streets and into the Swank Bar, a 1970s-style disco, in Scenes Five and Six. <b>Here</b> <b>is</b> <b>where</b> the choreography veers from {{classical}} ballet, with jazz forms and modern dance dominating. The Prince gets into a fight with sailors at the bar, and he is thrown out into the street. In Scene Seven, he sees the Girlfriend being paid off by von Rothbart, and he is totally shattered {{to discover that the}} only person who appeared to love him is a fake. This increases his desperation and he vows to kill himself.|$|E
60|$|And {{now they}} had {{finished}} the rooms, but the matron, catching a glow from these enthusiastic pilgrims, had yet other things to show them.

60|$|That was {{far away}} from the place where my first Little Brother to the Bear lived, and many years had passed since I had visited the ledge by the old beaver dam. One day I came back, and turned swiftly into the old wood road that had a happy memory for me by every turn and rock and moldering stump. <b>Here</b> <b>was</b> <b>where</b> the grouse used to drum; and there, {{at the end of the}} log, were signs to tell me that it still {{sometimes}} rolled off the muffled thunder of the wings above. <b>Here</b> <b>was</b> the break in the wall that the fox used as a runway; and there was a crinkly yellow hair caught on a rough rock telling its story mutely. <b>Here</b> <b>was</b> <b>where</b> the pines stood thickest; but they were all cut away now, and the hardwood seeds that had waited so many years under the pines for their chance at the sunlight were shooting up into vigorous life at last. And <b>here</b> <b>was</b> the place <b>where</b> the road twisted about to look back on the pretty spot where the shy children lived, with whom I had once made friends.|$|R
25|$|Kierkegaard {{decided to}} step up to the Tree of the {{knowledge}} of good and evil for himself, replacing Adam, and make his choice in the presence of God, where no one was there to accuse or judge him but his Creator. This is what he had Abraham do in Fear and Trembling. This is how Kierkegaard thought learning about oneself takes place. <b>Here</b> <b>is</b> <b>where</b> the single individual learns about guilt and innocence. His book, The Concept of Anxiety, makes clear that Adam did have knowledge when he made his choice and that was the knowledge of freedom. The prohibition was there but so was freedom and Eve and Adam decided to use it.|$|E

Williams is known for her claims she can communicate with the deceased. The Soulspring website carried the following message: “We in Soulspring do not communicate with dead souls in our work.

2500|$|Polish Jews were a 'visible minority' {{by modern}} standards, {{distinguishable}} by language, behavior and appearance. Only 12 percent of Jews declared Polish as {{their first language}} in the national census of 1931, while 79 percent listed Yiddish and the remaining 9 percent Hebrew as their mother-tongue. For {{hundreds of thousands of}} Jews the Polish language was barely familiar. By contrast, the overwhelming majority of German Jews of this period spoke German as their first language. In the labour market of many cities including Poland's provincial capitals, the presence of such large, mostly non acculturated minority, was a source of competitive tension. <b>Here</b> <b>is</b> <b>where</b> the temptation to jump to conclusions with regard to Polish-Jewish relations in wartime should be resisted, wrote Gunnar Paulsson: [...] "leaving aside acts of war and Nazi perfidy, a Jew's chances of survival in hiding were no worse in Warsaw, at any rate, than in the Netherlands" [...] once the Holocaust began.|$|E

L- and f- are regular asymmetric and symmetric forms; although f- is actually asymmetric in form, it is derived from p- and therefore rotates 90° as p- does. <b>Here</b> <b>is</b> <b>where</b> the two algorithms to derive vowel orientations, which are equivalent for the symmetrical forms of the original script, come to differ: For the ᕙ f- series, as well as a rare ᕦ th- series derived from ᑕ t-, vowels of like height are derived via counter-clockwise rotation; however, an eastern sh- series, which perhaps not coincidentally resembles a Latin s, is rotated clockwise with the opposite vowel derivations: high -i from low -a and lower (mid) -e from higher (mid) -o. The obsolete sp- series shows this to be the original design of the script, but Inuktitut, perhaps generalizing from the ᕙ series, which originated as ᐸ plus a circle {{at the start of the}} stroke used to write the letters, but as an independent form must be rotated in the opposite (counter-clockwise) direction, is consistently counter-clockwise. (The eastern Cree r- series can be seen as both of these algorithms applied to ro (bold), whereas western Cree l- can be seen as both applied to la (bold).) ...|$|E
2500|$|Arthur M. Diamond argues Hayek's {{problems}} arise {{when he goes}} beyond claims that can be evaluated within economic science. Diamond argued that: “The human mind, Hayek says, is not just limited {{in its ability to}} synthesize a vast array of concrete facts, it is also limited in its ability to give a deductively sound ground to ethics. <b>Here</b> <b>is</b> <b>where</b> the tension develops, for he also wants to give a reasoned moral defense of the free market. He is an intellectual skeptic who wants to give political philosophy a secure intellectual foundation. It is thus not too surprising that what results is confused and contradictory.” Chandran Kukathas argues that Hayek's defence of liberalism is unsuccessful because it rests on presuppositions that are incompatible. The unresolved dilemma of his political philosophy is how to mount a systematic defence of liberalism if one emphasizes the limited capacity of reason. Norman P. Barry similarly notes that the “critical rationalism” in Hayek’s writings appears incompatible with “a certain kind of fatalism, that we must wait for evolution to pronounce its verdict.” Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz argue that the element of paradox exists in the views of Hayek. Noting Hayek's vigorous defense of [...] "invisible hand" [...] evolution that Hayek claimed has created better economic institutions than could be created by rational design, Friedman pointed out the irony that Hayek was then proposing to replace the monetary system thus created with a deliberate construct of his own design. Also, John N. Gray summarized this view as [...] "his scheme for an ultra-liberal constitution was a prototypical version of the philosophy he had attacked." [...] Bruce Caldwell wrote: [...] "If one is judging his work against the standard of whether he provided a finished political philosophy, Hayek clearly did not succeed," [...] although he thinks that [...] "economists may find Hayek's political writings useful." ...|$|E
