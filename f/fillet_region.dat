40|$|Presented to the 13 th Annual Symposium on Graduate Research and Scholarly Projects (GRASP) {{held at the}} Rhatigan Student Center, Wichita State University, April 28, 2017. Research {{completed}} in the Department of Aerospace Engineering, College of EngineeringHoneycomb cores are typically produced {{in the form of}} flat sheets and are heat formed to the desired shapes for use in sandwich structures with curvatures. Understanding of the high temperature behavior of honeycomb core is fundamental to the process of forming honeycomb core. A 3 D non-linear finite element model (FEM) of the repetitive unit cell of hexagonal honeycomb core is employed to predict the CTE of Fiberglass/Phenolic honeycomb core. It is shown that the CTE of the honeycomb core is highly dependent on node bond adhesive layer and its <b>fillet</b> <b>region.</b> Inclusion of the node bond adhesive layer and its <b>fillet</b> <b>region</b> in FEM leads to orthotropic thermal expansions. The wedge action created by the adhesive fillet contributes to the higher magnitudes of CTE's as well as a negative CTE along the ribbon direction. Good agreement is observed between numerical model predictions and test results. Graduate School, Academic Affairs, University Libraries, Regional Institute on Agin...|$|E

40|$|Two cracked NLG brackets; one in {{finished}} {{condition and}} the other in semi-finished condition, were sent to the laboratory for analysis. Cracks were noticed in the components during dye penetrant inspection. It was established that the cracks were resulted during heat treatment of the semi-finished components. Hence, study was undertaken to establish first whether or not there were any problems in the material or in heat treatment procedure. Microstructural and fractographic examination confirmed that there were no abnormalities in the material. Based on the microstructural study, the possibility of overheating during heat treatment was also ruled out. However, analysis of the failure, in general, indicated that most probably, the cracking of the NLG brackets occurred due to differential stresses that got developed in different sections of the components during quenching process. Because of the shape, varying thickness and extra material left in the component after semi-finishing operation, some of the <b>fillet</b> <b>regions</b> were found to be vulnerable for crack generation during quenching operation. Analysis also shows that such heat treatment cracking in the NLG brackets in its present form is probably unavoidable. In view of this, it is recommended that suitable modification be made in the design so that the fabrication problems encountered currently can be avoided...|$|R
40|$|A {{methodology}} {{has been}} developed that allows the use of plate elements instead of numerically inefficient solid elements for modeling structures with 90 degree fillets. The technique uses plate bridges with pseudo Young's modulus (Eb) and thickness (tb) values placed between the tangent points of the fillets. These parameters are obtained by solving two nonlinear simultaneous equations {{in terms of the}} independent variables rlt and twallt. These equations are generated by equating the rotation at the tangent point of a bridge system with that of a fillet, where both rotations are derived using beam theory. Accurate surface fits of the solutions are also presented to provide the user with closed-form equations for the parameters. The methodology was verified on the subcomponent level and with a representative filleted structure, where the technique yielded a plate model exhibiting a level of accuracy better than or equal to a high-fidelity solid model and with a 90 -percent {{reduction in the number of}} DOFs. The application of this method for parametric design studies, optimization, and dynamic analysis should prove extremely beneficial for the finite element practitioner. Although the method does not attempt to produce accurate stresses in the <b>filleted</b> <b>region,</b> it can also be used to obtain stresses elsewhere in the structure for preliminary analysis. A future avenue of study is to extend the theory developed here to other fillet geometries, including fillet angles other than 90 and multifaceted intersections...|$|R
40|$|Examination of over 3, 000 fish, all sciaenids, {{has shown}} that plerocercoids of Poecilancistrium caryophyllum infect Cynoscion nebulosus, Bairdiella chrysura, Sciaenops ocellata, C. arenarius, Micropogonias undulatus, and Pogonias cromis in Mississippi Sound. In {{addition}} to P. caryophyllum, a pseudophyllidean-like trypanorhynch also infected C. nebulosus and M. undulatus. Pseudogrillotia pleistacantha selectively infected large P. cromis, Pterobothrium heteracanthum infected M. undulatus, and Pterobothrium lintoni infected Menticirrhus americanus. Prevalence and intensity of infections of P. caryophyllum in C. nebulosus from Mississippi, roughly 40 % of the fish each possessing {{an average of about}} two worms, compare with infections observed in fish from Texas and Louisiana. However, values for fish from Apalachee Bay, but not Tampa Bay, Florida, are about twice as high. Extensive seasonal sampling in Mississippi Sound indicates fluctuations but no clear-cut seasonal trends other than a possible relationship between infections and salinity. As C. nebulosus increases in length, the prevalence of infections, but not the intensity, increases. This finding suggests an immune response to challenge infections. No fish less than 140 mm SL and relatively few less than 250 mm SL revealed infections, suggesting either the unavailability of the intermediate host to young fish or the ultimate death of most young infected individuals. Based on condition coefficients and liver-weight analysis, no apparent detrimental effect on infected, moderately-heavy adult fish occurred. Infections primarily involve the middle of a <b>fillet</b> or the <b>region</b> adjacent to the vertebral column below the dorsal fins and cause an esthetically displeasing product and consequently depress economically the trout fishery. Relatively more male than female fish harbored worms, but the significance of that finding is questioned...|$|R

The flight data included heat transfer rates and sparse pressure coefficients primarily in the <b>fillet</b> <b>region</b> of the vehicle.

40|$|A prematurely {{fractured}} {{main wheel}} hub of an aircraft {{was sent to}} the laboratory for investigation. Analysis showed that the main wheel hub has failed by fatigue. Multiple fatigue cracks were found to have initiated at the fillet of the outer face rim flange and propagated simultaneously before giving rise to final overload failure. Microstructural study indicated that stress corrosion cracking at a mechanically damaged site on the <b>fillet</b> <b>region</b> was responsible for fatigue crack initiation. Microstructure of the wheel hub material was found to be satisfactory. The material was found to conform to L- 42 Al-alloy specification. No metallurgical abnormalities were found responsible for the stress corrosion cracking...|$|E
40|$|All {{the three}} TGB {{housings}} had fatigue crack at the fillet of the lug fusing {{area with the}} temperature sensor – locating boss.

Analysis also shows that the incorporation of the temperature sensor – locating boss had made the lug vulnerable for early fatigue crack initiation. A detailed analysis of the failure is presented in this report. A few recommendations are made for enhancing the fatigue life of the component...|$|E
40|$|Evidences {{suggest that}} the LH top root fitting of the {{aircraft}} has failed by stress corrosion cracking (SCC). Laboratory study showed that SCC was promoted due to poor machining at the <b>fillet</b> <b>region</b> of the component. The stress concentrators and the residual stresses resulting from this poor machining {{were responsible for the}} SCC. The situation was further aggravated due to destruction of the surface protective layer at some point of time in the service life of the component. The material of construction was found to conform to specification in terms of composition, microstructure and hardness. No metallurgical abnormalities were found responsible for the failure.

40|$|Abstract. A {{pressure}} plate, {{a component}} of the clutch system, was analyzed by two-dimensional and three-dimensional finite element method under three major load conditions of thermal loading due to temperature distribution, centrifugal force and contact pressure of diaphragm spring. The results show that the effects of thermal loading and contact pressure of diaphragm spring are important, which suggests the direction of design improvement. A hub plate was also analyzed with finite element modeling. A stress concentration occurs around the <b>fillet</b> <b>region</b> around the window in the plate where the fracture analysis is executed to find the stress intensity factors. These results will be used as the fundamental data for design improvement of the shapes of pressure plates and hub plates...|$|E
40|$|The {{wheel rim}} {{referred}} to the laboratory had developed a crack at the <b>fillet</b> <b>region</b> of the outer rim flange. The fractographic features were obliterated due to post failure corrosion and hence, the mode of fracture could not be identified unambiguously. However, gross fractographic features and the failure pattern suggest that wheel has failed by fatigue. Microstructural study revealed linear defects entrapped with iron oxide at the fillet of the wheel rim. These defects were identified to be laps/folds in the material which appeared to have developed during flange rolling operation. It is believed that these defects had acted as stress raisers for premature fatigue crack initiation resulting in failure of the wheel rim. A detailed analysis is presented in this report...|$|E

40|$|A major cost in the {{fabrication}} of carbon-epoxy composite structures for aircraft is the non-destructive inspection (NDI) {{performed at the}} end of the manufacturing process to reveal the presence of any defects and damage such as porosity, backing paper and bond-line cracks. The inspection can account for up to 50 % of the cost and time involved in {{the fabrication}} of aircraft composite components. Compounding this problem is that NDI often fails to detect damage in difficult to inspect regions, such as the centre fillet of T-stiffened panels. Structural proof testing is a potentially cheaper, faster and more reliable inspection method, which typically involves externally loading the component (static or dynamic loading), and assessing the structural response for the presence of damage and qualification of structural integrity. The current proof testing body of knowledge is limited to detection of active defects that propagate within a structure under load, such as delaminations and cracks. Currently no work has been performed to detect small and passive damages that do not propagate during proof loading, such as voids and porosity. In the current work, the feasibility, methodology and technical challenges of surface strain monitoring and mode shape curvature (MSC) analysis as damage detection techniques within a proof testing scenario were investigated numerically and experimentally. A carbon/epoxy T-stiffened panel was used as the case study to assess the two damage monitoring techniques in detecting delamination, voids, and porosity. An experimentally validated finite element model was used in a parametric study to assess the ability of surface strain monitoring to detect and locate damage in the skin-stiffener bond-line and central <b>fillet</b> <b>region</b> of a T-stiffened panel. Not only are these regions susceptible to manufacturing damage, but the central <b>fillet</b> <b>region</b> is difficult to inspect using conventional NDI. The proof test conditions necessary to optimise the strain field for damage detection were determined, and the detection and location of delamination and voids throughout the T-joint was successfully achieved. However, surface strain monitoring was limited to the detection of porosity in high, wide-spread concentrations, and could not reliably provide damage location. The difference in mode shape curvature from undamaged-to-damaged structures was investigated experimentally and numerically. A scanning laser vibrometer was used to experimentally measure the mode shape displacements of the T-joints under sinusoidal excitations from 0 – 5 kHz. The results of the MSC differences yielded accurate and consistent results with respect to damage presence, location and severity. Delamination damage was detected and located. Porosity was also detected although the exact location was not as clear due to the high stiffness of the structure affecting the indication of damage location. However, the MSC difference technique successfully detected porosity throughout the T-joint including the central <b>fillet</b> <b>region,</b> which cannot be easily inspected using conventional NDI. The results of this investigation have provided the foundations necessary to successfully implement a novel structural proof testing methodology for certification of aircraft composite components, capable of detecting and locating damage in complex structures...|$|E
40|$|This paper evaluates {{structural}} {{proof testing}} methods {{for the detection}} of manufacturing defects in aircraft composite components. A static proof test method based on compliance and surface strain mapping and a dynamic (vibration) method based on mode shape curvature (MSC) analysis are evaluated {{for the detection of}} manufacturing defects. The evaluation of these structural proof methods was performed using finite element analysis to identify the test conditions best suited for damage/defect detection. The finite element modelling was validated by structural proof tests performed on T-joint composite specimens containing the manufacturing defects of large voids, porosity and delaminations. The coupled compliance and surface strain mapping technique was able to detect a delamination crack along the stiffener-skin bond-line or a void within the <b>fillet</b> <b>region</b> when the joint was elastically loaded, but failed to detect porosity at the concentrations which typically occur in joints with defects. The MSC technique successfully detected voids, porosity and delaminations in the T-joint excited by elastic stress waves induced by random frequency vibrations...|$|E
40|$|Imported Straight Bevel Gear {{originally}} {{fitted in}} the 13; Merchant-Mill {{was replaced by}} indigenously made straight bevel gear in Steel Rolling Mill at TISCO, Jamshedpur. The replaced gears were developing crack originating at the <b>fillet</b> <b>region</b> extending towards the centre with {{in a short period}} of two to three months operation,causing large production loss. It was suspected that certain unpredicted peak loads exceeding designed limits might be present during Mill operation. To make a quantitative assesment of the peak load, the measurement of tooth load and torque in the driving axle was undertaken. For this purpose, a six channel FM-FM telemetry system was developed at N A L for measuring gear stresses using foil strain gauges. In the Strip Rolling Mill, the thickness of the sheet was depending on the roller load. A load monitoring system consisting of two load cells of 100 tonnes range each and a digital load indicator was developed at N A L for monitoring the roller bearing load for better thickness control...|$|E
40|$|Reduced {{weight is}} a major design goal in {{aircraft}} power transmissions. Some gear designs incorporate thin rims to help meet this goal. Thin rims, however, may lead to bending fatigue cracks. These cracks may propagate through a gear tooth or into the gear rim. A crack that propagates through a tooth would probably not be catastrophic, and ample warning of a failure could be possible. On the other hand, a crack that propagates through the rim would be catastrophic. Such cracks could lead to disengagement of a rotor or propeller from an engine, loss of an aircraft, and fatalities. To help create and validate tools for the gear designer, the NASA Lewis Research Center performed in-house analytical and experimental studies to investigate the effect of rim thickness on gear-tooth crack propagation. Our goal {{was to determine whether}} cracks grew through gear teeth (benign failure mode) or through gear rims (catastrophic failure mode) for various rim thicknesses. In addition, we investigated the effect of rim thickness on crack propagation life. A finite-element-based computer program simulated gear-tooth crack propagation. The analysis used principles of linear elastic fracture mechanics, and quarter-point, triangular elements were used at the crack tip to represent the stress singularity. The program had an automated crack propagation option in which cracks were grown numerically via an automated remeshing scheme. Crack-tip stress-intensity factors were estimated to determine crack-propagation direction. Also, various fatigue crack growth models were used to estimate crack-propagation life. Experiments were performed in Lewis' Spur Gear Fatigue Rig to validate predicted crack propagation results. Gears with various backup ratios were tested to validate crack-path predictions. Also, test gears were installed with special crack-propagation gages in the tooth <b>fillet</b> <b>region</b> to measure bending-fatigue crack growth. From both predictions and tests, gears with backup ratios (rim thickness divided by tooth height) of 3. 3 and 1. 0 produced tooth fractures, whereas a backup ratio of 0. 3 produced rim fractures. For a backup ratio of 0. 5, the experiments produced rim fractures and the predictions produced both rim and tooth fractures, depending on the initial geometry of the crack. Good correlation between predicted and measured crack growth was achieved when the fatigue crack-closure concept was introduced into the analysis. As the gear rim thickness decreased, the compressive cyclic stress in the gear-tooth <b>fillet</b> <b>region</b> increased. This retarded crack growth and increased the number of crack-propagation cycles to failure...|$|E
40|$|A {{fractured}} MGB {{housing and}} a cracked TGB housing {{belonging to a}} helicopter were forwarded to the laboratory for analyzing the causes of failures. The components were made of Mg-alloy of RZ- 5 specification. Investigation revealed that both the components have failed by fatigue. The fatigue crack initiation in the mounting lugs of the MGB housing was stress related. It is believed that the component has experienced unexpected high loads at these mounting locations, probably due to some abnormalities in the gearbox. However, {{this needs to be}} ascertained by detailed examination of the gearbox components. The fatigue crack initiation in the TGB housing was due to high stress concentration arising from a thin edge at the <b>fillet</b> <b>region.</b> The fatigue crack initiation was also facilitated because of wide difference in the length of the webs of the mounting lug, which was caused due to incorporation of a temperature sensor-locating boss at this location. It is recommended that the design aspects of the lug be reviewed for a possible relocation of the temperature sensor-locating boss to a non-critical region or isolation of the boss from the attachment lug. ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{deals with}} three-point flexure tests on hybrid I- and Π-beams, {{made out of}} {{multi-layer}} carbon fiber/epoxy resin (including twill woven fabric CF 3031 / 5284 and unidirectional cord fabric U 3160 / 5284) reinforced composites, processed using the RTM (resin transfer molding) technique. Static bending properties were determined and failure initiation mechanism was deduced from experimental observations. Failure mode of the tested hybrid RTM-made I-beams can be reckoned to be characteristic of the delamination from the cutout edge within the web and the debonding propagation along the interface between the inverted triangular resin-rich zone and the adjacent curved web until local buckling within the curved webs around the conjunction <b>fillet</b> <b>region.</b> In contrast, as distinct from hybrid RTM I-beams subjected to three-point bending loading, hybrid RTM-made Π-beams in three-point flexure tests experienced the resin debonding in the inverted triangular resin-rich zones and the debonding propagation along the interface between the inverted triangular resin-rich zone and the adjacent curved web until complete separation of the curved web from the flange. Progressive damage models (PDMs) were presented to predict failure loads and process of hybrid RTM-made I- and Π-beams under three-point flexure. Good correlation was achieved between experimental and numerical results...|$|E
40|$|AbstractGas turbine {{compressor}} blades {{are subjected}} to centrifugal, gas bending and vibratory loads. This repeated loading and unloading can reduce the life of compressor blades. This research aims at the estimation of fatigue crack growth and fatigue life of various three dimensional crack in a compressor blade considering the stress intensity factor calculations for a half-elliptical crack, subjected to centrifugal loading. Static stress analysis was carried out to ascertain the critical region or crack zone of the blade. The maximum Von - Mises stress was found at the <b>fillet</b> <b>region</b> near {{the root of the}} blade, the predicted state of stress has helped in identifying the region of singularity which may lead to crack initiation. Finite Element Method was used to evaluate the range of stress intensity factor solutions in the blade with a half-elliptical flaw. Semi-elliptical crack lengths ranging from 0. 2 mm to 6 mm were considered in the crack zone. Stress intensity factor was evaluated for different rotational velocity of 5000, 10000 and 20000 rpm. The stress intensity factor range obtained is employed to predict fatigue crack growth behavior and fatigue crack life estimation by using Paris law. The maximum Mode I stress intensity factor of 61. 4 Mpa√m was found at the surface interception point, for a crack length of 6 mm and crack depth of 2. 4 mm. With the increase in rotational velocity of 5000 rpm, 10000 rpm and 20000 rpm, fatigue crack length growth rate was estimated to be and 1. 95 x 10 - 09, 1. 65 x 10 - 07 m/cycle and 4. 15 x 10 - 05 m/cycle and the fatigue crack propagation life was estimated to be of 4. 3 x 108 cycles, 7. 3 x 106 cycles and 5 x 103 cycles respectively. It was concluded that at the surface crack interception point, fatigue crack growth rate increases with increase in crack depth and the fatigue crack propagation life tends to decrease with increase in the rotational velocity of the compressor blade...|$|E
40|$|A few {{components}} {{belonging to}} an engine retrieved {{from the wreckage}} of crashed aircraft were sent to this laboratory for investigation. The components that were sent for laboratory analysis are (i) fractured rim and diaphragm of stage IV compressor disc, (ii) spline bolt, (iii) HPTR blade, (iv) LPTR blade, (v) HP nozzle guide vane, (vi) stage I compressor rotor blades, and (vii) a metallic piece recovered from fuel oil unit. Examination revealed that the diaphragm of stage IV compressor disc had sheared off circumferentially and along the fillet of the rim. While majority of the fracture surface showed reverse slant fracture features, a region spanning about 50 - 60 mm on the fracture surface had smooth and flat appearance. Fractographic study conducted on this region showed presence of a half-moon shape region, indicative of progressive mode of crack propagation. Further examination of this region under a scanning electron microscope confirmed that the crack propagation was by fatigue. The fatigue crack {{was found to have}} initiated at the fillet of the rim of the disc on the side facing stage V compressor. Detailed examination revealed that after initiation, the crack had propagated progressively over about 18 mm in length and 2. 5 mm in depth. Followed by this, the fatigue crack propagation was relatively fast through the remaining thickness of the diaphragm and over a length of 50 - 60 mm on the diaphragm surface. Once the fatigue crack attained this length, the diaphragm sheared off circumferentially and along the fillet of the rim instantaneously by overload. The fatigue crack origin region was severely damaged due to post fracture rubbing and hence, no further study was possible to examine {{whether or not there was}} any localized stress concentrator either mechanical or metallurgical, which could be responsible for the fatigue crack initiation. It may, however, be noted that there were no metallurgical abnormalities in the material of construction of the compressor disc and it was found to conform to specification of BT 3 - 1 Ti-alloy. Study of the surfaces and the metallurgical examination did not reveal any evidences of overheating in the components such as HPTR blade, LPTR blade and HP nozzle guide vane. Although certain microstructural changes were observed in the material of HPTR blade, these changes were found to be within the acceptable range, and they are expected to occur in the material over prolonged use at elevated temperatures. Although the features on the fracture surfaces of the spline bolts were completely obliterated due to oxidation/exposure to fire, gross fractographic features and deformation preceding fracture indicated that the failure was by overload. Compositional analysis confirmed that the metallic piece recovered from the fuel oil unit is a fractured segment of the nose-fairing. Analysis also showed presence of traces of nose-fairing on the damaged regions of stage I compressor rotor blades. Analysis suggests that the compressor disc with a fatigue crack of length 50 - 60 mm at the rim <b>fillet</b> <b>region</b> would not survive, and it is likely to fracture during engine run. It is, therefore, stated that the fatigue fracture of stage IV compressor disc was the first in the chain of events that led to engine failure...|$|E
