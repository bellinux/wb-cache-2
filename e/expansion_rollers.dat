50|$|The longer span, (136 ft) {{uses the}} same {{materials}} but is more intricate. It has nine panels, each 15 ft wide, creating chords which arch both {{above and below the}} deck {{to the point that they}} are 22 ft apart at their most distant from each other, in mid-span. The upper chord is made of flanged plate girders riveted together with top and bottom iron cap plates bolted on; the lower of double 1+1/4 by 3 in wrought iron bars. Both are joined at the span's end with end pins. A lattice-braced system similar to that on the short span supports the lenticular truss, with similar members serving as horizontal braces below the deck. Iron tie rods 1+1/4 in wide serve as diagonal cross-braces on the panels, and there is a horizontal tension rod at each end of the truss. A set of <b>expansion</b> <b>rollers</b> at the west end, intended to provide additional stability, has since corroded due to road salt and rust.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. According to the {{characteristic}} of plate rolling {{process and the}} on-line applications, the non-homogeneous wear and thermal <b>expansion</b> of <b>rollers,</b> the elastic recovery and thermal expansion of work pieces, the variation of oil film thickness and the zero point deviation, which influence the precision of gap setting model, are analyzed. Based {{on the results of}} analysis, a high-precision gap setting model is proposed, and a zero point correction method is developed, in order to avoid overshoot, damp coefficient, which is affected by the thickness of work piece and zero point deviation are considered, is introduced. On-line applications indicate that the gap setting model improves the precision of gap setting and laid a good foundation of further improvement of thickness accuracy...|$|R
50|$|Initially, the {{majority}} of Hans Theodor Vleugels Organs were produced for the Southern German and Swedish markets. In addition {{to the production of}} instruments in accordance with classical principals, organ building in Hardheim stepped into new territories and established new accents in the field of organ building. Milestones include organs with electric action, the organ from Cologne-Gremberg, which set on a concrete mushroom shaped pedestal; a new smaller console (i.e. in Sinsheim III/36); and stops set {{on the side of the}} console which can be moved around (i.e. in Stuttgart-Möhringen III/37). Another highlight was the restoration of a decaying, but priceless baroque organ case (Walldürn, Basilika III/40). The positioning of a free-hanging organ in a steel frame, the use of Plexiglas for a swell box (<b>expansion</b> chamber), <b>roller</b> boards, and a transparent console were only a few of the features that often caused surprised and sometimes shocked reactions.|$|R

It was requested that BNL evaluate plasma sprayed Ni-Al coatings for safe ending heat exchanger tubes exposed to geothermal brine. The tubes of interest had an internal diameter of 0. 875 inches. It is not typical to thermal spray small diameter components or use such small standoff distances. In this project a nozzle extension was developed by Zatorski Coating Company to spray the tube ends as well as flat coupons for testing. Four different Ni-Al coatings were investigated. One of these was a ductilized Ni-AIB material developed at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The coatings were examined by optical and scanning electron microscopy. In addition, the coatings were analyzed by X-ray diffraction and subjected to corrosion, tensile adhesion, microhardness and field tests in a volcanic pool in New Zealand. It was determined that the Ni-Al coatings could be applied to a depth of two inches on the tube ends. When sprayed on flat coupons the coatings exhibited relatively high adhesion strength and microhardness. Polarization curves showed that the coating performance was variable. Measured corrosion potentials indicated that the Ni-Al coatings are active towards steel coated with thermally conductive polymers, thereby suggesting preferential corrosion. Corrosion also occurred on the coated coupons tested in the volcanic pool. This may have been exacerbated by the difficulty in applying a uniform coating to the coupon edges. The Ni-Al coatings applied to the tubes had significant porosity and did not provide adequate corrosion protection. This is associated with the short standoff distance and is not a reflection of the normal quality of plasma sprayed coatings. Even if coating porosity could be reduced, the coupling of an alloy coating to a polymer-based barrier coating in the same electrolyte is not recommended. Therefore, polymer coatings that can be field applied to the tube ends after <b>roller</b> <b>expansion</b> should be sought...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—A {{method is}} {{established}} for joining a tube to a tubesheet by expanding the tube to the tubesheet. The expansion done using different method such as rolling. The joint integrity {{is important to}} ensure the roundness {{of the structure of}} the heat exchanger, and to prevent leakage. Many parameters affect the joint integrity such as the initial clearance, wall reduction and material properties. The residual contact stress is the main parameter indicating the strength of the joint. In this paper, the two dimensional planar FE model is established for the tube to tubesheet <b>roller</b> <b>expansion.</b> The planar model is great way for our attempt to understand and analyze the problem. The planar model reveals a realistic motion of the rollers in addition to the exact geometry of the tubesheet. This eliminates the need for the assumption of uniform expansion and tubesheet sleeve diameter sets on the axisymmetric model. That, the ligament dimensional effect will be shown on this model...|$|R
