2500|$|Hookah [...] A {{basic form}} of surface-supplied diving {{in which the}} air supply is via a single hose is often {{referred}} to as airline or Hookah (occasionally <b>Hooka)</b> diving. This often uses a standard scuba second stage as the delivery unit, but is also used with light full-face masks. Bailout gas may be carried, but this is not always the case. Commercial diamond divers working in the shallow zone off the west coast of South Africa under the codes of practice of the Department of Minerals and Energy use half mask and demand valve hookah, and no bailout as standard practice. Their safety record is relatively poor.|$|E

In {{the cool of the}} evening, when the sun has sunk behind the {{mountains}} of Afghanistan, and the valleys are filled with a delicious twilight, the elders of the village lead the way to the chenar trees by the water's side, and there, while the men are cleaning their rifles, or smoking their <b>hookas,</b> and the women are making rude ornaments from beads, and cloves, and nuts, the Mullah drones the evening prayer. Few white men have seen, and returned to tell the tale. But we may imagine the conversation passing from the prices of arms and cattle, the prospects of the harvest, or the village gossip, to the great Power, that lies to the southward, and comes nearer year by year. Perhaps some former Sepoy, of Beluchis or Pathans, will recount his adventures in the bazaars of Peshawar, or tell of the white officers he has followed and fought for in the past. He will speak of their careless bravery and their strange sports; of the far-reaching power of the Government, that never forgets to send his pension regularly as the months pass by; and he may even predict to the listening circle the day when their valleys will be involved in the comprehensive grasp of that great machine, and judges, collectors and commissioners shall ride to sessions at Ambeyla, or value the land tax on the soil of Nawagai. Then the Mullah will raise his voice and remind them of other days when the sons of the prophet drove the infidel from the plains of India, and ruled at Delhi, as wide an Empire as the Kafir holds to-day: when the true religion strode proudly through the earth and scorned to lie hidden and neglected among the hills: when mighty princes ruled in Bagdad, and all men knew that there was one God, and Mahomet was His prophet. And the young men hearing these things will grip their Martinis, and pray to Allah, that one day He will bring some Sahib--best prize of all--across their line of sight at seven hundred yards so that, at least, they may strike a blow for insulted and threatened Islam.|$|R

5000|$|The name Dapto {{is said to}} be an Aboriginal word {{either from}} Dabpeto meaning [...] "water plenty", or from tap-toe which {{described}} the way a lame Aboriginal elder walked. The suburb was officially founded in 1834, when George Brown transferred the Ship Inn from Wollongong to Mullet Creek Farm, in an area now named in his honour as Brownsville. After an unsuccessful attempt at wheat growing in the 1850s, Dapto embraced the dairy industry. In 1887 the railway opened and a butter factory was established. This began a transformation of Dapto and the town centre shifted south to where the new station was located. The Australian Smelting Company's works were established on Kanahooka Road and employed over 500 men. A railway, operated by the Illawarra Harbour and Land Corporation Limited, connected the smelter with the Government railway at Dapto. By 1903 the Commissioner for Railways declared that Dapto was the most valuable station on the Illawarra line, its traffic being double that of Wollongong. The books John Brown of Brownsville (2012), Gooseberry and <b>Hooka</b> (2012) and Lake Illawarra: an ongoing history (2005) - all written by Joseph Davis and published by the Lake Illawarra Authority - contain lots of detail about Dapto's history.

40|$|ABSTRACT The minus end–directed {{microtubule}} motor cytoplasmic dynein transports vari-ous cellular cargoes, including early endosomes, but how dynein binds to its {{cargo remains}} unclear. Recently fungal Hook homologues {{were found to}} link dynein to early endosomes for their transport. Here we identified FhipA in Aspergillus nidulans as a key player for <b>HookA</b> (A. nidulans Hook) function via a genome-wide screen for mutants defective in early-endosome distribution. The human homologue of FhipA, FHIP, is a protein in the previously discovered FTS/Hook/FHIP (FHF) complex, which contains, besides FHIP and Hook proteins, Fused Toes (FTS). Although this complex was not previously shown {{to be involved in}} dynein-mediated transport, we show here that loss of either FhipA or FtsA (A. nidulans FTS homo-logue) disrupts HookA–early endosome association and inhibits early endosome movement. Both FhipA and FtsA associate with early endosomes, and interestingly, while FtsA–early endosome association requires FhipA and <b>HookA,</b> FhipA–early endosome association is inde-pendent of <b>HookA</b> and FtsA. Thus FhipA is more directly linked to early endosomes than <b>HookA</b> and FtsA. However, in the absence of <b>HookA</b> or FtsA, FhipA protein level is signifi-cantly reduced. Our results indicate that all three proteins in the FtsA/HookA/FhipA complex are important for dynein-mediated early endosome movement...|$|E

In this study, I present some biological and fishery parameters described after a sample of 843 lobsters, landed in Playa Lagarto from November 2007 to October 2008. From landing records, a total of 74. 9 % of lobsters were below the minimum legal catch size (80 mm CL). Carapace lengths were {{in the range of}} 42. 8 and 143. 6 mm for males and 115 and 35. 8 mm for females. The size structure showed a wide overlapping of population segments, and a trend to increase with depth, where lung diving and ?<b>hooka?</b> diving operations take place. Sex ratio was 1. 36 M:H. The relationship between weight and LC revealed that females are heavier than males of the same size, and this difference was significant (p < 0. 05). The von Bertalanffy growth parameters for males and females respectively (K= 0. 45 - 0. 38, LC??= 166. 9 - 121. 7) showed accelerated growth compared to other species. Males observed a higher growth rate than females. Furthermore, natural mortality (M), total mortality (Z) and fishing mortality (F) was higher in males (0. 49 - 2. 34 - 1. 92) than in females (0. 47 - 1. 82 - 1. 42).

40|$|IntroductionHookah {{smoking is}} {{becoming}} increasingly popular among young adults and is often perceived as less harmful than cigarette use. Prior studies show that {{it is common for}} youth and young adults to network about substance use behaviors on social media. Social media messages about hookah could influence its use among young people. We explored normalization or discouragement of hookah smoking, and other common messages about hookah on Twitter. MethodsFrom the full stream of tweets posted on Twitter from April 12, 2014, to May 10, 2014 (approximately 14. 5 billion tweets), all tweets containing the terms hookah, <b>hooka,</b> shisha, or sheesha were collected (n = 358, 523). The hookah tweets from Twitter users (tweeters) with high influence and followers were identified (n = 39, 824) and a random sample of 5, 000 tweets was taken (13 % of tweets with high influence and followers). The sample of tweets was qualitatively coded for normalization (ie, makes hookah smoking seem common and normal or portrays positive experiences with smoking hookah) or discouragement of hookah smoking, and other common themes using crowdsourcing. ResultsApproximately 87 % of the sample of tweets normalized hookah use, and 7 % were against hookah or discouraged its use. Nearly half (46 %) of tweets that normalized hookah indicated that the tweeter was smoking hookah or wanted to smoke hookah, and 19 % were advertisements/promotions for hookah bars or products. ConclusionEducational campaigns about health harms from hookah use and policy changes regarding smoke-free air laws and tobacco advertising on the Internet may be useful to help offset the influence of pro-hookah messages seen on social media.
