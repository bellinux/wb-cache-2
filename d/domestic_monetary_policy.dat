25|$|A renewed {{interest}} in Keynesian ideas {{was not limited to}} Western countries and stimulus plans were a common response to the crisis from nations across the globe. Stimulus packages in Asia were on a par with those in Europe and America. In a speech delivered in March 2009 entitled Reform the International Monetary System, Zhou Xiaochuan, the governor of the People's Bank of China, revived Keynes's idea of a centrally managed global reserve currency. Dr Zhou argued that it was unfortunate that Keynes's bancor proposal was not accepted at Bretton Woods in the 1940s. He argued that national currencies were unsuitable for use as global reserve currencies {{as a result of the}} Triffin dilemma – the difficulty faced by reserve currency issuers in trying to simultaneously achieve their <b>domestic</b> <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> goals and meet other countries' demand for reserve currency. Zhou proposed a gradual move towards adopting IMF special drawing rights (SDRs) as a centrally managed global reserve currency.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper will}} propose {{a plan to}} reform {{international}} finance—the World Financial Authority (WFA) Plan. Under such a plan, the IMF and other existing international financial institutions would be reformed and coordinated around a newly created WFA. The WFA would have two core functions. The first function would be to manage international liquidity, thus reducing externalities arising from <b>domestic</b> <b>monetary</b> <b>policies</b> adopted by its members, and addressing global liquidity problems involving financial activities of transnational private banks. The second function would be to help countries make their <b>domestic</b> <b>monetary</b> <b>policies</b> more effective, thus regaining traction and preventing contagion. A central instrument to this end {{is the creation of}} the World Financial Unit (WFU), an international currency unit conceived as a synthetic security backed by reserves composed of currencies surrendered to the WFA by member countries. The WFA would support the financial globalization, as well as help governments to maintain their power to manage the domestic macroeconomic conditions, contain externalities, align incentives, and allow for more responsible policies...|$|R

30|$|In {{view of that}} {{international}} capital movements which are extremely hard to restrict, the trilemma could be reduced to the dilemma, i.e., the incompatibility of <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> autonomy and stable foreign exchange rates. In a real world in which international capitals move freely more than ever, stable exchange rates can only be maintained by forsaking the independence of <b>domestic</b> <b>monetary</b> <b>policies.</b> For instance, when the Fed implements loose <b>monetary</b> <b>policy,</b> China imports <b>monetary</b> ease passively; when the Fed tightens up, China tightens up along with the USA.

40|$|In small open economies, {{external}} factors exert a strong {{influence on the}} autonomy and efficiency of <b>domestic</b> <b>monetary</b> <b>policies.</b> For the Czech National Bank, no exchange rate regime can guarantee a lasting degree of policy autonomy. Within the present CNB's strategy of direct inflation targeting, changes of exchange rate and of world prices proved especially hard to tackle. In 1998 and 1999, a substantially faster disinflation took place than was presupposed by CNB's own inflation targets. This helped to throw the economy into a recession. A credit crunch subsequently set out of function the most important transmission channel of <b>monetary</b> <b>policy.</b> Inflation targets were repeatedly undershot, and only a strong capital inflow initiated the money supply growth for economic recovery. A lower level of ambition to steer the economy via autonomous <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> is probably desirable.

40|$|This paper applies two {{traditional}} empirical {{approaches to}} investigate how successfully Korea managed to control money supply {{in response to}} the changes in foreign reserves since 1980. One is to estimate offset coefficients and the other is to estimate sterilization coefficients. The estimation results are as follows. Reflecting strict and effective capital controls, the <b>domestic</b> <b>monetary</b> <b>policies</b> were partially offset mainly by short-term capital flows. The Bank of Korea pursued sterilization policies very actively. Particularly, sterilization was more active during the late 1980 s of huge current account surplus than during the early 1990 s of a surge in capital flows. There were over-sterilization during the early 1 980 s when foreign reserves kept dropping, which implied that <b>monetary</b> <b>policies</b> were directed to worsening the balance of payments deficit rather than improving it.

40|$|High {{interest}} rate currencies tend to appreciate. This is the uncovered {{interest rate}} parity (UIP) puzzle. It {{is primarily a}} statement about short-term interest rates {{and how they are}} related to exchange rates. Short-term interest rates are strongly affected by <b>monetary</b> <b>policy.</b> The UIP puzzle, therefore, can be restated in terms of <b>monetary</b> <b>policy.</b> Do foreign and <b>domestic</b> <b>monetary</b> <b>policies</b> imply exchange rates that violate UIP? We represent <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> as foreign and domestic Taylor rules. Foreign and domestic pricing kernels determine the relationship between these Taylor rules and exchange rates. We examine different specifications for the Taylor rule and ask which can resolve the UIP puzzle. We find evidence in favor of a particular asymmetry. If the foreign Taylor rule responds to exchange rate variation but the domestic Taylor rule does not, the model performs better. A calibrated version of our model is consistent with many empirical observations on real and nominal exchange rates, including Fama’s (1984) negative correlation between interest rate differentials and currency depreciation rates...|$|R
