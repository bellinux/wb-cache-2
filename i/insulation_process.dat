40|$|An {{increasing}} number of applications {{require the use of}} high temperature superconductors (HTS) such as (RE=Rare Earth) Ba 2 Cu 3 O 7 -x (REBCO) coated conductors [1]. HTS conductors show particularly great potential for high field magnets applications [1] due to their high upper critical fields [2], But several groups have shown that REBCO coated conductors are prone to delamination failure [3] [4] [5]. Under relatively low transverse stress the HTS film separates from the substrate and the conductor degrades [6]. This is problematic due to high transverse stresses that occur in fully epoxy impregnated solenoids wound with this conductor. Application of thin walled heat shrink tubing introduces a weak plane around the conductor, preventing delamination degradation [7]. However, manual application of the shrink tubing is impractical, requiring three operators limited to insulating 100 m lengths or less of REBCO conductor. The high risk of damage to the conductor, also associated with this process, shows the need for a mechanized process. Strict guidelines for the capabilities of the mechanized process were set: a single operator must have the capability to insulate continuous 200 m lengths of REBCO conductor with a minimum insulation rate of 50 m per work day. This thesis presents the ideation, prototyping, and construction of such a mechanized <b>insulation</b> <b>process.</b> Results of prototyping yielded an insulation rate of 100 m per work day with two operators, and the capacity to insulate 130 m of REBCO conductor [8]. Local critical current test indicated that no damage is caused to the tape from the <b>insulation</b> <b>process</b> [9]. A final mechanized Shrink Tube Insulation Apparatus (STIA) was developed, increasing the conductor length capacity to 450 m and reducing the number of operators to one. Due to unforeseen motor and tape tension issues, modifications to STIA were required, which increased the number of operators to two. Through a collaborative effort between the Applied Superconductivity Center (ASC) and the Kyushu University in Japan, a continuous 200 m length of Fujikora-produced REBCO conductor was provided, to be insulated by STIA. An insulation rate of 100 m per work day was achieved with two operators. In the latter of the paper, current work to rectify the issues causing the need for two operators is presented...|$|E

Examining functional relationships between model variables can provide insight into the ability of models to capture fundamental processes and aid in minimizing uncertainties or deficiencies in model forcing. This study quantifies the proficiency of land models to appropriately transfer heat from the soil through a snowpack to the atmosphere during the cooling season (Northern Hemisphere: October–March). Using the basic physics of heat diffusion, we investigate the relationship between seasonal amplitudes of soil versus air temperatures due to insulation from seasonal snow. Observations demonstrate the anticipated exponential relationship of attenuated soil temperature amplitude with increasing snow depth and indicate that the marginal influence of snow insulation diminishes beyond an effective snow depth of about 50  cm. A snow and heat transfer metric (SHTM) is developed to quantify model skill compared to observations. Land models within the CMIP 5 experiment vary widely in SHTM scores, and deficiencies can often be traced to model structural weaknesses.

These interventions included installing insulated ceilings (retrofitting), roof insulation, partitions, wall insulation, window insulation, solar water heaters (SWH) and compact fluorescent lights (CFL's). Of these interventions, wall insulations and ceiling installations were the most cost-effective interventions. This approach was coined "Heat as medicine" by Howden‐Chapman (2011) and a CBA conducted by his team concluded a 2 : 1 benefit to cost ratio (B:C) from the <b>insulation</b> <b>process</b> (IEA, 2011).

With ceilings having such a substantial cost-effective impact on energy efficiency, this paper will be focusing on the ceiling retrofitting intervention in addressing energy poverty. Surprisingly, solar water heater interventions offer a much smaller net benefit, {{as a result of}} high installation costs and increased usage of water.

40|$|Submitted {{on behalf}} of EDA Publishing Association ([URL] audienceA new ISM (image sensor module) WLP (wafer level package) for reflow process is designed, {{fabricated}} and tested. The ISM WLP is composed of polymer bonding layer, glass cap wafer for particle free process and CIS (CMOS Image Sensor) chip wafer which has micro via hole interconnection. During the last decades, WLP is highlighted as the next generation ISM Package method for many advantages like high yield (particle free process), small form factor (3 D interconnection), low assembly cost and so on. Nevertheless these benefits, there are some problems like micro via hole fabrication, low temperature <b>insulation</b> <b>process</b> (inside hole), bottom side oxide etching, warpage control according to wafer level bonding using different material, and whole process temperature limitation for micro lens damage. Among various fabrication methods for ISM package, COB (Chip on board), COF (Chip on film), and L, T contact WLP from ShellCase are generally used. In case of COB and COF package, it has difficulty in particle control during assembly process. In case of ShellCase type WLP has very complicated fabrication process. Additionally, most of above package has disadvantage in size point of view. Through suggested ISM WLP using through interconnection via, wafer level fabrication & packaging technology is realized. It can not only solve problems of conventional packaging structures but also tremendously reduce the manufacturing & assembly cost (include time) of ISM package and realize real chip scale package. Based on sensor size, 3. 67 X 3. 42 X 0. 39 (H) mm 3 WLP is designed. During the parametric study using commercial 3 -D simulation programs, silicon thickness, polymer bonding layer thickness, and glass thickness were chose the effective factor.

40|$|The {{integrated}} {{series connection}} of solar cells {{is an essential}} aspect for thin-film photovoltaic technology. With a series connection a high output voltage of the module is achieved while the output current is kept low. Thus, Ohmic losses in the contact materials are kept low as well. In thin-film silicon solar technology the steps to create the interconnection are commonly done by laser ablation integrated in-between the depositions of the solar cell layer materials. In three steps laser scribing is used to selectively remove layers locally {{in the form of}} lines across the module substrate. In a first step the front-contact is removed for electrical insulation and cell stripe definition. Afterwards, the absorber is removed locally exposing the front-contact beneath. Finally, the interconnection is formed when the back-contact is removed locally as well. The area that is needed for the interconnection of two neighboring cells is no longer active for current generation. Depending on the technology 5 - 10 % of active area is lost. The reduction of this area holds an attractive potential for an increase of the module efficiency. The topic of this thesis is the investigation of the lower geometrical limits for the dead area reduction for substrate side laser processing of thin-film silicon solar cells. It is well-known that the interconnection and the laser processes can {{have an impact on the}} performance of the solar module. Therefore, the characterization of the impact on the performance is of special importance when laser processes are used that are capable of generating a reduced interconnection width. P 1 : for the front-contact <b>insulation</b> <b>process</b> it was found out that the scribe quality strongly depends on the used laser wavelength. Ablation mechanisms that are driven by material phase changes (scribing with 532 nm or 1064 nm) can lead to smoother scribe edges compared to mechanisms dominated by stress-induced removal (355 nm) where non-uniform rip-off at the edges occurs. However, in certain processing regimes, strong ablation debris redeposition in direct vicinity of the P 1 scribe is observed when small beam spot radii (< 10 µm) are used. Such redeposition has a severe impact on the solar cell performance in this region. With proper wet-chemical cleaning the amount of redeposited debris on the front-contact and the negative impact on the solar module can be minimized. Parasitic shunting of two neighboring cell stripes by deposition of absorber material into the P 1 scribe increases when the scribe width is reduced. Measurements show that the overall magnitude of the shunt is in a value range that impact on the solar module is negligible for commonly used cell topologies. P 2 : the width reduction approach was extended for the absorber removal process (P 2). To ensure the selectivity of silicon removal without damaging of the front-contact beneath, only 532 nm was used for scribing. For this wavelength ablation is strongly assisted by mechanical stresses generated by hydrogen diffusion from the absorber layer and/or thermal expansion of the absorber layer. Mechanical constraints limiting the lower scribe width are found that depend on the absorber thickness and the laser beam spot size. Such behavior can be explained directly from linear elastic fracture mechanics where removal of the layer is determined by the relation between delamination at the interface and fracture of the absorber along the circumference of the spot. It can be concluded that for substrate side laser-induced ablation thin scribe lines are only possible for thin layers. The parasitic series resistance formed by P 2 also increases as the scribe width is decreased. However, for processing of amorphous silicon absorbers, with a beam radius 10 µm, the minimal achievable resistance value is strongly increased. In fact, much more than what would be expected just by the geometrical contact area reduction. This is most likely owed to changes of the specific contact resistance due to increased debris redeposition within the P 2 scribe prior to back-contact deposition. In contrast, such effects are not observed for processing of tandem absorber where debris redeposition is less pronounced. Here, low series resistances, with only minor impact on the module performance, are achieved for all investigated beam spot sizes. P 3 : the back-contact <b>insulation</b> <b>process</b> (P 3) is similar to P 2 since the back-contact is removed indirectly by removal of the absorber beneath. Shunting between front- and back-contact can occur at the direct P 3 scribe edges. These shunts are possibly formed due to heat generated by sub-threshold energy intake of excess energy from the shoulders of Gaussian distribution of the laser. The mechanical constraints on the minimal achievable scribe widths are even stronger than what was observed for the optimization of the P 2 process. This is owed to the additional overall thickness of the layer-stack due to the back-contact. Furthermore, for tandem solar cell processing the scribe edges are strongly distorted by delaminated material while clean edges are obtained for a-Si:H solar cells. The parasitic shunting by P 3 scribing increases by many orders of magnitude when a processing beam radius of 10 µm is used. However, just like it was observed from P 2, an overall weaker deterioration is obtained for scribing of tandem solar cells than for amorphous silicon cells. It is possible that material modifications are more localized in the a-Si:H top-cell. Together with the higher thickness of the tandem cells (300 nm vs. 1. 4 µm) the impact on the whole device is not as pronounced...|$|E
40|$|The {{design of}} novel {{solutions}} for packaging {{and integration of}} power semiconductor devices to deliver switches with advanced performance and reliability is very important aspect of power electronics technology evolution. The advancement of technology {{in this area is}} committed to bring significant improvements in the design and implementation of power converters particularly in the enhancement of efficiency, higher power density and better cooling system as compared to the state-of-the-art solutions. A power module is a combination of either multiple semiconductor or discrete devices which are connected to form an electrical circuit of certain structure. They are mainly constructed with a stack of four main parts (power semiconductor devices, insulating substrate with circuit conductor, baseplate, and interconnecting material encapsulated in a plastic case) and each of these parts is of a different material. Some of the interfaces within the module are prone to failure with thermal cycling such as wire-bond, solder die attach and substrate. Therefore reducing the number of interfaces in the assembly will greatly reduce the thermal resistance from the junction to ambient and yields noticeable increase of performance. Moreover, using solid posts as opposed to wires to connect the surface of vertical power components enable a significant improvement in power density as compared with standard modules based on wire bond technology. Additionally, the replacement of wires with such posts drastically reduces the distributed parasitic inductance, together with double-sided cooling of the devices, results in an increase of performance and reliability of the components and assemblies. In this work, 70 um thick Infineon technology power devices which are rated at 600 V/ 200 A were used for the assembly of a Bi-directional switch based converter and discussing the challenges and trade-offs related to selecting processes and materials. Encapsulation {{is also one of the}} important factors in making of power module to protect the power chip and the interconnections from moisture, chemicals, dust, gases, and so on. Here, <b>insulation</b> <b>process</b> was carried out for a given prototype using silicone gel; however, it is worth to note the existing challenge on insulating a very small gap between the sandwich layers of the prototype as compared with the standard planar power module structure. A basic partial discharge test was also taken to demonstrate the performance of the insulation. This research has presented an advanced modular integration approach for power device packaging demonstrating the progress beyond the state of the art in power system assembly by proposing a solution which significantly improves electromagnetic and thermomechanical performance of the power module. In particular, fully bond wireless, double sided cooling and layout symmetry are key aspects. The proposed approach is transferable to many topologies having extra benefit of restricting the impact of single device or switch failure on the general system accessibility...|$|E
40|$|Porous {{polymeric}} materials {{have a good}} impact strength, light wt. and high porosity. Therefore, these foams are used {{in a wide range}} of applications, including <b>insulation,</b> sepn. <b>processes</b> and packaging. Since it is important to have an objective comparison of polymeric foams, this paper discusses a quant. method using Voronoi diagrams, which has been developed to analyze and compare different morphologies of polymers foamed with supercrit. carbon dioxide, based on the av. cell area, cell area distribution and homogeneity. In contrast to SEM anal. only, different foam morphologies can be compared with this technique in an objective manner. The anal. is based on the centers of the cells and is therefore to a large extent independent of the sample prepn. Using the Voronoi-approach, it is possible to extrapolate the 2 D view of the SEM picture to a 3 D representation of the foam with the thickness of one cell layer...|$|R
40|$|Frequency Domain Spectroscopy (FDS) is {{successfully}} {{being used}} to assess the insulation condition of oil filled power transformers. However, it has to date only been implemented on de-energized transformers, which requires the transformers to be shut down for an extended period which can result in significant costs. To solve this issue, a method of implementing FDS under energized condition is proposed here. A chirp excitation waveform is used to replace the conventional sinusoidal waveform to reduce the measurement time in this method. Investigation of the dielectric response under the influence of a high voltage stress at power frequency is reported based on experimental results. To further understand the <b>insulation</b> ageing <b>process,</b> the geometric capacitance effect is removed to enhance the detection of the ageing signature. This enhancement enables the imaginary part of admittance {{to be used as a}} new indicator to assess the ageing status of the insulation...|$|R
40|$|The thermal {{insulation}} market {{is dominated by}} petroleum insulations. A gap has been identified for the manufacture of “green ” insulations. These insulations must perform to the same levels of heat transfer resistance as their petroleum based counterparts. Modern petroleum derived insulations can be carcinogenic, toxic to manufacture and release toxins as they degrade. The majority are not environmentally friendly. The aim {{of this research is}} to create an insulation that combats the above points and addresses the gap between sustainable and non-sustainable insulations. This research will address the uncertainties in the alternative <b>insulation</b> validation <b>process,</b> achieved through experimental research. Soap will be manufactured from lye, animal fats and oils and aerated to produce soap insulation. These manufactured soap samples will be tested in both laboratory and real-world settings. Soap insulation could be a useful addition to low environmental impact insulations and create a foundation for further research to build off...|$|R
