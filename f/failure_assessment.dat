40|$|Probabilistic <b>failure</b> <b>assessments</b> for {{integrally}} bladed disks are {{system reliability}} problems where a failure {{in at least}} one blade constitutes a rotor system failure. Turbine engine fan and compressor blade life is dominated by High Cycle Fatigue (HCF) initiated either by pure HCF or Foreign Object Damage (FOD). To date performing an HCF life assessment for the entire rotor system has been too costly in analysis time to be practical. Although the substantial run-time has previously precluded a full-rotor probabilistic analysis, reduced order models make this process tractable as demonstrated in this work. The system model includes frequency prediction, modal stress variation, mistuning amplification, FOD effect, and random material capability.

40|$|A {{model is}} {{constructed}} for risk management of crude pipeline subject to rupture {{on the basis}} of a methodology that incorporates structured expert judgment and analytic hierarchy process (AHP). The risk model calculates frequency of failure and their probable consequences for different segments of crude pipeline, considering various failure mechanisms. Specifically, structured expert judgment is used to provide frequency of <b>failure</b> <b>assessments</b> for identified <b>failure</b> mechanisms of the pipeline. In addition, AHP approach is utilized to obtain relative failure likelihood for attributes of failure mechanisms with very low probability of occurrence. Finally, the expected cost of failure for a given pipeline segment is estimated by combining its frequency of failure and the consequences of failure, estimated in terms of historical costs of failure from the pipeline operator’s database. A real-world case study of a crude pipeline is used to demonstrate the application of the proposed methodology. Hydraulic EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R

Since initiation and crack-extension resistance are geometry dependent any transfer of the measured data to a structural omponent is subject to the individual responsibility of the engineer. The introduction of a second parameter for <b>failure</b> <b>assessments</b> beyond J-control has, therefore, been widely discussed, recently, and different approaches have been used to quantify the local stress triaxiality and crack tip constraint. Three basic ideas underlie these various approaches, - including higher order terms in the analysis of asymptotic fields at the crack tip, - utilizing the J-CTOD relationship as a measure of crack tip constraint, - considering micro-mechanisms of ductile failure. Before adding new results of test or calculations to the existing ones it seems worthwhile to discuss the different concepts with respect to their advantages and drawbacks, limitations and generality of application, physical evidence, etc. It seems that constitutive models of damage have the highest degree of physical evidence and generality of applications. "Constraint effects" do not even arise as separate problems since triaxiality of stresses enters the model directly.

40|$|Background: The {{ability to}} {{recognize}} {{the severity of the}} disease in those who their survival depend entirely on admission to the intensive care unit, is very valuable clinically. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of modified sequential organ <b>failure</b> <b>assessment</b> (MSOFA) scale to predict mortality and length of stay in intensive care unit patients respectively. Methods: This was a retrospective cross-sectional study conducted on hospital records of patients admitted to the intensive care unit. All patients’ records who admitted to the intensive care unit of Kowsar Hospital, Semnan city (the capital of the province), Iran, in 2015 considered as the sample. Collecting data were done during 4 weeks in April and May 2016. The data collection tool was a demographic questionnaire and modified sequential organ <b>failure</b> <b>assessment</b> scale. Exclusion criteria included discharge in the first 24 hours after admission, the patient died a few hours after admission and incomplete information to complete the modified sequential organ <b>failure</b> <b>assessment</b> form. Results: The study of 105 patients' records of the intensive care unit showed that 45. 7 % of patients were died, 15. 2 % and 39 % were discharged and moved to other wards respectively. The results of logistic regression analysis and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve showed that this criterion had moderate sensitivity and specificity for prediction of mortality and length of stay in ICU patients (Area= 0. 635, CI= 0. 527 - 0. 743) and each unit increase in modified sequential organ <b>failure</b> <b>assessment</b> score is accompanied by increasing 32 percent chance of death (OR= 1. 325; 95 % CI: 1. 129, 1. 555; P= 0. 001 (.

40|$|Graduation date: 2013 An {{open area}} of {{research}} in complex systems is to move reliability and <b>failure</b> <b>assessments</b> earlier in the engineering design process. When compared to later design, early decisions are cost effective and have a large impact on the system. Standard methods are limited by the availability of data and often rely on detailed representations of the system. This dissertation will focus on this need by developing an Early Design Reliability and Failure Modeling framework. This framework presents a suite of engineering design methods used to assess reliability and failure modes during the early design process. Several instances are provided to show how specialized data sets can be developed that are specific to early design applications. Specific importance in this dissertation will be placed on design theory and methodology to support decision making. Overall these methods address important early design considerations including the automated identification and mitigation of high-occurrence failure modes, the abstraction level of failure modes and mechanisms, quantifying uncertainty and functional reliability, a customer's risk of losing functionality, a system's risk {{to a set of}} failure modes, and the behavior modeling of important failure modes...|$|R

40|$|A {{methodology}} {{is presented}} for integrating probabilistic fracture mechanics with quantitative NDT {{for the purpose}} of <b>failure</b> risk <b>assessment</b> in load-carrying elements under fatigue circumstances. The definition of the failure risk of structural components is made {{in the context of the}} general approach of structural reliability with a discussion of the sources of uncertainties and variability encountered in the assessment. The quality of NDT is accounted by the probability of detection (POD) as function of the flaw size. The main focus is placed on the presentation on the fatigue <b>failure</b> risk <b>assessment</b> in conjunction with the quality and timing of the envisaged non-destructive inspection. On the base of Monte Carlo computer simulation, a rationale have been developed encompassing the fatigue crack growth under short- and long-crack regime, thus addressing the entire fatigue life. For this purpose, the concepts of "initial fictitious crack" size and "equivalent initial flaw" size are discussed and implemented in the analysis. By computer simulation, it is exemplified, for a notched member of an aluminum alloy, the modeling of the scatter of the total fatigue life and the scatter of the crack size at a given life. Further, by fitting the simulated random data into continuous statistical distributions enabled to model the key distributions involved in the <b>failure</b> risk <b>assessment.</b> Finally, the probability of failure, at a specific timing during the fatigue life, is estimated by Monte Carlo simulation of the failure on the base of Failure Analysis Diagram (FAD) approach. The benefit of applying a non-destructive inspection technique, qualified by a specific POD dependence on the crack size, is demonstrated by evincing the decrease in the predicted failure probability. Bootstrap techniques are also exemplified for constructing confidence intervals on POD vs. crack size. The integration of quantitative NDT with probabilistic fracture mechanics, in order to evince the failure risk, enables a better timing and ranking of inspection procedures...|$|R
