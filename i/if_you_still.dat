2500|$|The {{film was}} re-released internationally on the tenth anniversary of Fellini's death in 2003. For the San Francisco Chronicle, Mick LaSalle noted that I Vitelloni was [...] "a film of sensitivity, {{observation}} and humor – a must-see for Fellini enthusiasts and a worthwhile investment for everyone else. Those less {{taken by the}} maestro may find I Vitelloni to be a favorite among his works". Michael Wilmington of the Chicago Tribune wrote: [...] "In Italy, it remains one of Fellini's most consistently loved movies. It should be in America as well... <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>still</b> remember that terrific drunk scene, Alberto Sordi's pre-Some Like It Hot drag tango or the way the little boy balances on the train track at the end, {{you should know that}} this picture plays as strongly now as it did in 1956 or whenever you first saw it. I know I had a ball watching I Vitelloni again. It reminded me of the old gang." ...|$|E

[...] "Call on Me" [...] is the ninth song and lead single from 20 Y.O. It features Nelly, and samples The SOS Band's 1983 song [...] "Tell Me <b>If</b> <b>You</b> <b>Still</b> Care". It includes whispered vocals from both Jackson and Nelly. Second interlude finds Jackson remembering her Good Times days as Penny. [...] "Daybreak", the eleventh song, begins with fairy tale infused chimes before introducing electronic soul handclaps before Jackson starts singing. It has a few lyrics which deal about sex. The following track, [...] "Enjoy", is composed by piano and bass. In the song, Jackson's vocals were heavily treated. Both songs have additional carnival charms, sing-along melodies, and a children's chorus at its end of the latter. An interlude follows, with Jackson calling her lover, asking him to come home. Fourteenth song [...] "Take Care" [...] is a love song which finds the singer pleasuring herself while she waits for her lover.
