5|$|While Bayreuth {{presented}} a useful front for Nazi culture, and Wagner's music was used at many Nazi events, the Nazi hierarchy {{as a whole}} did not share Hitler's <b>enthusiasm</b> <b>for</b> Wagner's operas and resented attending these lengthy epics at Hitler's insistence.|$|E

50|$|One of {{the main}} criticisms leveled at Children of Albion is that it {{contains}} work by {{a large number of}} poets who subsequently ceased writing, or at least publishing, poetry of any note.

40|$|Drawing on {{four decades}} of {{literature}} on African migration and development, this paper argues that concepts of development have sedentary roots, focused on the control of mobility and viewing migration as symptom of development failure. This analysis highlights fundamental contradictions {{at the heart of}} the current academic and policy <b>enthusiasms</b> <b>for</b> linking migration and development...|$|R
5|$|Accounts {{of their}} {{marriage}} diverge widely. Frances's congenital hip dislocation left her in constant pain, and often irritable.

Two years later Alderson was posted to the Indian 6th Infantry Division based in Poona, Southern India. In 1912 he returned to England in semi-retirement on half-pay, becoming a hunt master in Shropshire and developing an <b>enthusiasm</b> <b>for</b> yachting.|$|E
5|$|It did {{not seem}} to Dietz as if there was any {{relationship}} between critical praise and audience <b>enthusiasm</b> <b>for</b> January films. The best-rated, Disney's 2004 animated musical Teacher's Pet, was a commercial failure, as was 2001's The Pledge. Cloverfield, the third entry, was a success, and behind it Freedom Writers had ridden its good reviews to do some modest box office in 2007; however How She Move had flopped that same year.|$|E

40|$|A Holistic and Contextual Approach to Overcome Character Crisis in Indonesia. Indonesia {{has been}} confronting {{character}} crisis structural in nature as {{it occurs in}} all orders of society’s life. Life practice has lost its important values needed to build people with character. Such values as honesty, self-confidence, appreciation to diversity, and <b>enthusiasms</b> <b>for</b> learning and working have been decreasing. Actually, such values {{play an important role}} in solving problems that Indonesia is now facing, such as corruption, continuous-horizontal conflicts, inferior feelings, and low <b>enthusiasms</b> <b>for</b> learning and working. In relation to this, education can be a means to build people with character. It can be implemented with a holistic and contextual approach. Such an approach deals with not only the cognitive factor but also all potentials belonging to people. Principles of character education should be socialized and implemented in all levels of society.

5|$|Sorabji, {{who claimed}} to be of Spanish–Italian–Sicilian ancestry, {{composed}} various pieces that reflect an <b>enthusiasm</b> <b>for</b> those cultures, such as Fantasia ispanica, Rosario d'arabeschi and Passeggiata veneziana sopra la Barcarola di Offenbach. These are works of a Mediterranean character and are inspired by Busoni's Elegy No. 2, All'Italia, and the Spanish music of Isaac Albéniz, Debussy, Enrique Granados and Liszt. They are considered among his outwardly more virtuosic and musically less ambitious works.|$|E
5|$|The <b>enthusiasm</b> <b>for</b> relics continued, and foundations' {{prestige}} {{was greatly}} increased by success in obtaining {{the remains of}} important saints. The period between the Benedictine Reform and the Norman Conquest saw the most lavish donations of land to monasteries of any period in medieval England, and the leading reformed foundations became immensely wealthy, retaining their status after the Conquest. Monasteries founded in the Anglo-Saxon period enjoyed greater prosperity and prestige than post-Conquest establishments.|$|E
5|$|This {{version was}} criticised {{even before the}} museum board had had time to present their own view. August Brunius, who had {{expressed}} his <b>enthusiasm</b> <b>for</b> the Gustav Vasa painting, reacted against the choice of subject, like most critics. The choice of subject was only aggravated by {{the way it was}} presented. Brunius felt the painting to be unreal, unbelievable and not very relevant for the modern Swedes of the early 20th century.|$|E

The Guida d’Italia: Milano 1998 (Touring Club Editore, p. 154) points out that the early Romantics tended to praise it in “the first intense <b>enthusiasms</b> <b>for</b> Gothic.” As the Gothic Revival brought in a purer taste, condemnation was often equally intense.|$|R

5|$|A {{railroad}} link to Aspen {{was therefore}} {{likely to be}} highly profitable, and two railroads, the Colorado Midland and the Denver & Rio Grande Western, hoped to be the first. In the early 1880s, however, neither seemed able to do so. The Midland was a paper railroad with no money to build anything. The Rio Grande was building, but too quickly, forcing it into receivership. Financially cautious from its recent troubles, it chose not to build to Aspen despite its president's <b>enthusiasm</b> <b>for</b> the project.|$|E
5|$|After Croatia {{launched}} the Battle of the Barracks to capture JNA facilities in Croatia on 14–15 September, the JNA launched a small-scale operation against Vukovar {{to relieve the}} city garrison. At the same time, it began large-scale mobilization in preparation for its campaign in Croatia. It was met with widespread refusal of mobilised personnel to report to their designated units, desertions and an overall lack of <b>enthusiasm</b> <b>for</b> the campaign. This resulted in low troop availability, forcing the JNA to deploy fewer infantry units. Response to the mobilisation was particularly poor in Central Serbia, where only 26 percent of those called up reported for service.|$|E
5|$|An Lushan was a Tang {{general of}} mixed Turkic and Soghdian ancestry whose revolt between 755 and 763, the An Shi Rebellion, devastated the Tang Dynasty. Unlike the {{majority}} of Turkic military officers, An Lushan served the Tang as an official closely involved with {{the politics of the}} imperial court, rather than as a general in a garrison on the Tang frontier. The dynasty might have collapsed {{had it not been for}} their alliance with the Uyghur Turks. The rebellion diminished the Tang <b>enthusiasm</b> <b>for</b> cosmopolitanism that was a characteristic of the dynasty's earlier years.|$|E
60|$|The new {{minister}} {{and his wife}} were a young, pleasant-faced couple, still on their honeymoon, and full of all good and beautiful <b>enthusiasms</b> <b>for</b> their chosen lifework. Avonlea opened its heart to them from the start. Old and young liked the frank, cheerful young man with his high ideals, and the bright, gentle little lady who assumed the mistress-ship of the manse. With Mrs. Allan Anne fell promptly and wholeheartedly in love. She had discovered another kindred spirit.|$|R
5000|$|The {{underlying}} drive, in Weil and Chevalley at least, was {{the perceived}} need for French mathematics {{to absorb the}} best ideas of the Göttingen school, particularly Hilbert and the modern algebra school of Emmy Noether, Artin and van der Waerden. It is fairly clear that the Bourbaki point of view, while encyclopedic, was never intended as neutral. Quite the opposite: {{it was more a}} question of trying to make a consistent whole out of some <b>enthusiasms,</b> <b>for</b> example for Hilbert's legacy, with emphasis on formalism and axiomatics. But always through a transforming process of reception and selection — their ability to sustain this collective, critical approach has been described as [...] "something unusual".|$|R

5|$|As he {{indicated}} in the title, Kepler thought he had revealed God's geometrical plan for the universe. Much of Kepler's <b>enthusiasm</b> <b>for</b> the Copernican system stemmed from his theological convictions about {{the connection between the}} physical and the spiritual; the universe itself was an image of God, with the Sun corresponding to the Father, the stellar sphere to the Son, and the intervening space between to the Holy Spirit. His first manuscript of Mysterium contained an extensive chapter reconciling heliocentrism with biblical passages that seemed to support geocentrism.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of his}} {{contract}} with the Batavian Society, van Kinsbergen had to take photographs of Borobudur, which had just been cleaned and restored. However, {{when he went to}} photograph the Panataran Hindu temple complex in East Java in 1867, he ran out of chemicals. In his <b>enthusiasm</b> <b>for</b> photographing the many reliefs of the temple complex, he used up so many glass slides that he could not go to Borobudur as he had intended to. The Society was nervous about van Kinsbergen's delay, so they did not grant his request to supply new slides.|$|E
