50|$|A {{crucible}} with {{a bottom}} perforated with small holes {{which is designed}} specifically for use in filtration, especially for gravimetric analysis as just described, is called a <b>Gooch</b> <b>crucible</b> after its inventor, Frank Austin Gooch.|$|E
50|$|Gooch {{invented the}} <b>Gooch</b> <b>crucible,</b> which is used, for example, to {{determine}} the solubility of bituminous materials such as road tars and petroleum asphalts. He was awarded a Ph.D. by Harvard University in 1877. Gooch was a Professor of Chemistry at Yale University from 1885 to 1918.|$|E
50|$|A <b>Gooch</b> <b>crucible,</b> {{named after}} Frank Austin Gooch, is a {{filtration}} device for laboratory use (and was also called a Gooch filter). It is convenient for collecting a precipitate directly within the vessel {{in which it}} is to be dried, possibly ashed, and finally weighed in gravimetric analysis.|$|E
5000|$|The {{device was}} {{originally}} a standard platinum laboratory crucible with a perforated base into which asbestos pulp was placed {{to form the}} filter mat. [...] The crucible was then heated in an oven to dry out until it attained constant weight. The use of these materials meant that after filtration, the crucible and its contents could be subjected to high temperature to dry the filtrate and possibly oxidize or ash it to minimum weight. However, {{because of the high}} cost of platinum, versions made of porcelain were introduced in 1882. Some <b>Gooch</b> <b>crucibles,</b> such as the one in the drawing, permit two layers of asbestos to be used, separated by a perforated porcelain plate. Other inorganic fibers, notably glass, have been used in place of asbestos. <b>Gooch</b> <b>crucibles</b> made of borosilicate glass with fritted glass bases are more common today. [...] Platinum may still be required for the most corrosive materials, and porcelain ones are used where ashing at high temperature is required, but the borosilicate glass ones are adequate for drying.|$|R
50|$|It {{is often}} used in {{combination}} with a Büchner flask, Büchner ring and sinter seals. A vacuum tight seal and stability of the Büchner flask and filter are essential during the filtration process. A Büchner ring {{can be used with}} Büchner funnels, flasks, glass <b>crucibles</b> and <b>gooch</b> <b>crucibles.</b> The wide flange and large surface contact ensures an excellent vacuum tight seal whilst the rings are easy to remove and offer excellent support to even the largest funnels.|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} 14 {{herbicides}} on cellulose decomposition by Sporocytophaga myxococcoides were studied by growing the organism {{in two different}} liquid cellulose-mineral salts media {{in the presence of}} the test agent and then quantitatively determining the residual cellulose. In the first medium, containing acid-hydrolyzed cellulose, anthrone reagent was used to determine residual carbohydrate. In the second medium, <b>Gooch</b> Pyrex fritted-glass <b>crucibles</b> were used to determine the amount of residual Whatman powdered cellulose. The herbicides used were Atrazine, Simazine, Dacthal, Diuron, Amiben, Banvel-D, Banvel-T, 2, 3, 6 -TBA, Dicryl, Maleic Hydrazide, Stam F- 34, Zytron, Fenac, and Dalapon. Of these, Zytron appeared to be the most inhibitory to the test bacterium, and was the only compound exhibiting inhibition at a commonly used field rate of application (2 ppm) ...|$|R
40|$|In 1884 SCHULZE {{described}} 'a simple {{process for}} the determination of Halogens in the side chains of Aromatic Compounds,' in which an excess of hot saturated Alcoholic Silver Nitrate was added to a weighed quantity of the substance to be tested contained in a small flask. On boiling {{the contents of the}} flask for five minutes under a reflux condenser the Halogen was precipitated quantitatively as the Silver Halide and on filtering through a <b>Gooch</b> <b>crucible,</b> washing with Alcohol (to remove the by products which were insoluble in water) and water, and drying, it could be weighed as such.

40|$|Infertility is a {{widespread}} problem, and in some cases, the routine basic semen analysis {{is not sufficient to}} detect the cause of male infertility. The use of the scanning electron microscope (SEM) could provide a detailed insight into spermatozoa morphology, but it requires specific sample preparation techniques. The {{purpose of this study was}} to select, adjust, and optimize a method for the preparation of spermatozoa samples prior to SEM analysis, and to establish the protocol required for its use in clinical practice. We examined sperm samples of 50 men. The samples were fixed with modified iso-osmolar aldehyde solution followed by osmium post-fixation. In the first method, dehydration of the cells and subsequent critical point drying (CPD) were performed on a coverslip. In the second method, the samples were dehydrated in centrifuge tubes; hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS) was used as a drying agent instead of CPD, and the samples were air-dried. The third procedure was based on a membrane filter. The samples were dehydrated and dried with HMDS in a <b>Gooch</b> <b>crucible,</b> continuously, without centrifugation or redispersion of the sample. Our results showed that the fixation with modified iso-osmolar aldehyde solution followed by osmium post-fixation, and combined with dehydration and CPD on a coverslip, is the most convenient procedure for SEM sample preparation. In the case of small-size samples or low sperm concentration, dehydration and drying with HMDS on the membrane filter enabled the best reliability, repeatability, and comparability of the results. The presented procedures are suitable for routine use, and they can be applied to confirm as well as to correct a diagnosis. </p...|$|E
