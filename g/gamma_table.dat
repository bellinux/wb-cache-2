50|$|When {{a source}} and display are connected, the source first queries the display's {{capabilities}} {{by reading the}} monitor EDID block over an I²C link. The EDID block contains the display's identification, color characteristics (such as <b>gamma</b> level), and <b>table</b> of supported video modes. The table can designate a preferred mode or native resolution. Each mode {{is a set of}} CRT timing values that define the duration and frequency of the horizontal/vertical sync, the positioning of the active display area, the horizontal resolution, vertical resolution, and refresh rate.|$|R
40|$|Gamma ray {{energies}} from radioactive (η,γ) produced nuclides {{have been}} measured very accurately {{in the past}} few years and have been compiled in a publication by Lederer et al. (1967). However, these data are not presented in a manner which allows rapid identification of gamma spectra and although earlier publications such as Crouthamel (1960) and Heath (1964) have gamma ray data in a suitable form, the values of energies given are less precise that those in Lederer et al. The energies and abundances in the following tables are taken from Lederer et a. and rearranged in a form suitable for rapid identification of <b>gamma</b> spectra: <b>Table</b> 1 - Major gamma rays ordered by energy (each energy followed by all other gamma rays from that particular nuclide). Table 2 - All gamma rays ordered by energy <b>Table</b> 3 - <b>Gamma</b> rays from mass ordered nuclides. Similar tables containing data on fission products are being compiled. Half-lives start at two minutes, this time being chosen to suit irradiation and counting procedures in our laboratories. However, tables with half-lives from one second are available from the authors. Nuclides with characteristic x-rays and gamma rays less that 30 keV are not included in the tables. Only the immediate daughters of thorium and uranium are given in the Active Relation column. Other explanatory notes precede each table...|$|R
50|$|Thermal {{radiation}} is {{a byproduct of}} the collisions arising from various vibrational motions of atoms. These collisions cause the electrons of the atoms to emit thermal photons (known as black-body radiation). Photons are emitted anytime an electric charge is accelerated (as happens when electron clouds of two atoms collide). Even individual molecules with internal temperatures greater than absolute zero also emit black-body radiation from their atoms. In any bulk quantity of a substance at equilibrium, black-body photons are emitted {{across a range of}} wavelengths in a spectrum that has a bell curve-like shape called a Planck curve (see graph in Fig. 5 at right). The top of a Planck curve (the peak emittance wavelength) is located in a particular part of the electromagnetic spectrum depending on the temperature of the black-body. Substances at extreme cryogenic temperatures emit at long radio wavelengths whereas extremely hot temperatures produce short <b>gamma</b> rays (see <b>Table</b> of common temperatures).|$|R
5000|$|On June 12, BxB Hulk {{unveiled}} a persona {{that he had}} hinted at doing several months ago called [...] "Killer Hulk" [...] (later renamed Black Hulk), wearing black pants and black make-up and using a violent fighting style. Under this persona, he dismantled Real Hazard's Yasushi Kanda, blowing off {{what was left of}} their feud that they had going on for the last few months. He then got into a feud with Takagi. They fought in a match on June 29 to determine the #1 contender for CIMA's Open the Dream Gate Championship, but the match ended in a one-hour draw. They were soon scheduled to do battle again on July 27, but this time it would be for the Open the Dream Gate Title itself, due to CIMA vacating it because of a neck injury. Hulk lost that match, but his performance impressed Takagi enough that he retracted his statement about Hulk being weak and shook hands with him. He then got into a feud with Gamma, and he as Black Hulk fought Gamma as Gamma Daiou on November 16, which he won by count-out after putting <b>Gamma</b> through a <b>table</b> outside the ring with his E.V.O. finisher.|$|R
40|$|This work {{deals with}} the {{development}} and set-up of an auxiliary software for gamma spectrometry aimed to reduce uncertainty in quantitative analysis. Its outstanding feature is to avoid that a gamma lines set, generated from different radionuclides, might be erroneously associated to another radionuclide characterised by a gamma emission spectrum which is a random combination of those lines. This is obtained by an algorithm inspired to the so-called “Fuzzy Logic”. The input of the software is the typical output of the commercial software adopted for <b>Gamma</b> Spectrometry (a <b>table</b> which reports detected peak energy, net peak area and net area uncertainty). By means of a gamma library, the software identifies the radionuclides correspondent to the detected energies and generates a new table with the following quantities: energy of the peak detected, count rate, count rate uncertainty, peak efficiency, library energy, radionuclide name and corresponding yield. Usually in this table many lines are associated {{to more than one}} radionuclide. As first hypothesis the fuzzy logic algorithm considers as effectively existing all the radionuclides reported in the table while {{at the end of the}} process an index of compatibility is assigned to every line detected. From this value is then possible to devise the acceptability degree of every line...|$|R
40|$|Recently, high {{values of}} precipitable iodine of the serum (SPI) in certain {{instances}} of hepatitis and variable values in cirrhosis {{of the liver}} have been reported from this laboratory (1, 2). Inas-much as these sporadic high values in hepatitis were at variance with our usual findings, and be-cause high, low and normal values {{have been found in}} cirrhosis, additional studies of patients with dis-orders of the liver have been conducted. MATERIALS AND METHODS Patients with obstructive jaundice, cirrhosis of the liver and infectious hepatitis were observed on the wards of the New Haven Hospital. All were in a post-absorp-tive state. None had had gall bladder dyes, diodrast, lipiodol or other substances known to give high arti-factual values of SPI. None had had any mercurial di-uretics within the period during which these substances may affect the determination of SPI (3). None had had any unusual contact with inorganic iodine (4). SPI, lipids, proteins, bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase and the percentage of bromsulphalein retention were determined by methods previously described (2, 5 - 7). RESULTS In obstructive jaundice six values of SPI ob-tained in five individuals were all within the estab-lished normal range (2) (Table I). In addition to considerable jaundice these patients had grossly disturbed liver function as measured by the high ratio of free to total cholesterol and other tests. In cirrhosis of the liver 31 values of SPI in 21 indi-viduals varied from 1. 0 to 8. 8 <b>gamma</b> per cent (<b>Table</b> I). Of these values, however, only two are greater than occur in normal persons. A con-centration of 8. 0 gamma per cent, a value barely exceeding the normal 7. 8 gamma per cent, was found in HD in whom a value of 6. 6 gamma per cent had been found 16 months previously at a tim...|$|R
