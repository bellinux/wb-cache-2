His Senate committee preferences included education, transportation, and foreign relations. He also criticized the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act and the No Child Left Behind Act, but supported <b>gay</b> <b>marriage,</b> abortion rights, stem cell research, the death penalty, and universal healthcare. Chico was the only candidate who supported <b>gay</b> <b>marriage</b> out of all seven Democrats and eight Republicans. Then-State Senator Barack Obama ultimately won the nomination over six other candidates including Chico.|$|E

5|$|In February 2007, a {{controversy}} arose after Brown's appearance at King Philip Regional High School in Wrentham, Massachusetts {{as part of}} a debate on <b>gay</b> <b>marriage.</b> The high school students had launched a Facebook group attack on Brown and had made a derogatory remark about his daughter, Ayla.

5|$|Seattle {{is widely}} {{considered}} one of the most liberal cities in the United States, even surpassing its neighbor, Portland, Oregon.

In the same election, an overwhelming majority of Seattleites also voted to approve the legalization of the recreational use of cannabis in the state. Like much of the Pacific Northwest (which has the lowest rate of church attendance in the United States and consistently reports the highest percentage of atheism), church attendance, religious belief, and political influence of religious leaders are much lower than in other parts of America.|$|E
5|$|In November 2006, Keyes criticized Massachusetts {{governor}} Mitt Romney for instituting <b>gay</b> <b>marriage</b> {{entirely on}} his own—according to Keyes—with no requirement or {{authority to do}} so under Massachusetts law. Keyes said Romney's actions, which he suggested were due to a complete misunderstanding of his role as governor and {{of the limitations of}} the judicial branch of government, were not necessitated by a ruling of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court in November 2003 that directed the state legislature to institute same-sex marriage. The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial court had ruled that the state law banning same-sex marriage was not constitutional. The court gave the Massachusetts Legislature 180 days to modify the law; after it failed to do so, Gov. Mitt Romney ordered town clerks to begin issuing marriage licenses on May 17, 2004, in compliance with the court ruling.|$|E

She returns to Quahog to convince Brian to free the mayor, saying that if he pursues this any further, he will be hurting his own cause. Brian agrees, and ends the hostage situation.

5|$|Despite DOMA, Clinton was {{the first}} {{president}} to select openly gay persons for administrative positions, and he is generally credited as being the first president to publicly champion gay rights. During his presidency, Clinton issued two substantially controversial executive orders on behalf of gay rights, the first lifting the ban on security clearances for LGBT federal employees and the second outlawing discrimination based on sexual orientation in the federal civilian workforce. Under Clinton's leadership, federal funding for HIV/AIDS research, prevention and treatment more than doubled. Clinton also pushed for passing hate crimes laws for gays and {{for the private sector}} Employment Non-Discrimination Act, which, buoyed by his lobbying, failed to pass the Senate by a single vote in 1996. Advocacy for these issues, paired with the politically unpopular nature of the gay rights movement at the time, led to enthusiastic support for Clinton's election and reelection by the Human Rights Campaign. Clinton came out for <b>gay</b> <b>marriage</b> in July 2009 and urged the Supreme Court to overturn DOMA in 2013. He was later honored by GLAAD for his prior pro-gay stances and his reversal on DOMA.|$|E
5|$|Season 6 {{focuses on}} Rachel Berry, who returns to McKinley after her {{television}} pilot fails. She decides to reconstitute the glee club with all-new McKinley students and with Kurt's help. Will Schuester is now coaching rival club Vocal Adrenaline, while Blaine is coaching the Dalton Academy Warblers. All {{of the new}} main cast members from the fifth season have returned to guest star status in this final season when they appear; Amber Riley as Mercedes rejoins the main cast, and Dot-Marie Jones as Coach Beiste joins the main cast for the first time. The cast members deal with <b>gay</b> <b>marriage,</b> gender identity, transitioning and other social issues. The newly reconstituted club wins the Nationals competition, Sue is fired as principal and Will is hired to be the principal of a McKinley High repurposed as a magnet arts school, with Sam as the new director of New Directions. The finale jumps five years into the future: Rachel has married Jesse St. James (Jonathan Groff), wins a Tony Award, and is a surrogate mother for Kurt and Blaine (who are themselves Broadway stars). Artie has directed Tina in a film, Mercedes is a highly successful recording artist, and Sue has just been re-elected Vice President of the United States. The McKinley auditorium is renamed after Finn.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the issue of {{same-sex}} marriage in California, Texas and Florida. <b>Gay</b> <b>marriages</b> is a very hot topic nowadays in the US. After the Supreme Court decision in June 2013, which struck down a law that explicitly defined marriage as a union only {{between a man and a}} woman, ensued a wave of states legalizing <b>gay</b> <b>marriages.</b> After another Supreme Court decision in October 2014 on the issue, it became legal in the majority of US states to wed couples of the same gender. Texas and Florida did not join these states. California on the contrary legalized same-sex marriages. The thesis searches for reasons of this disparity in legal status of <b>gay</b> <b>marriages</b> between the three states. Particularly it looks at political aspects of the issue. The thesis describes the political situation in the examined states and approach of the politicians to the question of same-sex marriages. It also deals with relevant court cases which are essential to the issue. From the researched outcomes it finds reasons for differences in legal status of same-sex marriages between California, Texas and Florida before the October 2014 Supreme Court decision...|$|R
