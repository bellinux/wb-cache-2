Gerald turns off the music as the {{doorbell}} is heard. Answering the door, Gerald sees a man (Novak) who holds up a sign reading [...] "Hello, my name is Paul. I am deaf & dumb." [...] The reverse of the sign reads [...] "Do you need any cleaning products today?" [...] Gerald heads inside and hides Sabrina's body as Paul waits. Gerald splashes his soup onto the blood and invites Paul to clean it. Ray runs down the stairs and meets Paul; he proceeds to buy rope before returning upstairs. Paul continues to clean, but sees the bullethole in the cushion, and then the suitcase being lowered outside the window. Gerald heads outside to investigate, but Eddie and Ray drop the case on his head. The burglars run past Paul and look out to see the canvas in the pool, before both being shot by Paul. Paul rings someone and says [...] "Hello, it's me. Yeah, it's done." [...] He looks to the fake painting, and says [...] "I've got <b>it</b> <b>right</b> <b>here.</b> Yeah, it's fine. Not a peep out of anyone." [...] He takes down the painting and walks out, as the real canvas is seen sinking in the pool.|$|E

Easing up on the darker S themes of her recent albums, 'Make Me' is a fun, breezy tune with an elastic disco beat" [...] adding that [...] "he chorus twists Michael's refrain into a Janet-worthy, sexy come-on, with the lyrics, 'Don't stop 'til you get it up'." [...] Clover Hope of Vibe magazine commented: [...] "Fun, rhythmic, buoyant—it's the type of rebound we'd hoped for with 2008's Discipline, where Jackson teamed up with Rodney Jerkins {{in search of a}} youthful edge that only seemed to date her. They got <b>it</b> <b>right</b> <b>here</b> though, as Jerkins taps into Janet's sense of fanciful pleasure, rewinding time in a Janet way." [...] Jerkins also had Larry Ryckman and Ari Blitz Master [...] "Make Me" [...] with AfterMaster HD Audio which gave it a uniquely powerful presence. Michael Menachem of Billboard magazine hailed the song as her best dance recording since [...] "All for You" [...] (2001). Noting the single's similarity to Michael Jackson's disco themed [...] "Don't Stop Til You Get Enough" [...] from Off the Wall, Menachem comments [...] " [...] isn't just Jackson's best dance song in years—it's a hit that would make her brother proud." [...] Glenn Gamboa of Newsday referred to the single as [...] "remarkably upbeat, blending a bit of the playfulness that has been missing in her recent work with a high-energy Euro-dance backdrop." ...|$|E

[...] He {{glanced at}} her bewildered face and went on rapidly: [...] "You pleased me the first day I set eyes on you in the store I said to myself, 'Hopper, there's the one for you to marry.' I'm plain, but my folks was good people. I set to work right then to make a fortune for you, Miss Jinny. You've just what I need. I'm a plain {{business}} man with no frills. You'll do the frills.

[...] "It's sad and beautiful--and true. I do love to tell stories that I know really happened. Mrs. Dunbar lives next door to Aunt Louisa in town. She is so sweet. You wouldn't think {{to look at her}} that she had a tragedy in her life, but she has. Aunt Louisa told me the tale. It all happened long, long ago. Interesting things like this all did happen long ago, it seems to me. They never seem to happen now. This was in '49, when people were rushing to the gold fields in California. It was just like a fever, Aunt Louisa says. People took <b>it,</b> <b>right</b> <b>here</b> on the Island; and a number of young men determined they would go to California.|$|E

We have to thank you for all you did for us while we were making hogs of ourselves; you'll find me turn-to all right in future; and as for the wine, which I grant we stole from you, I'll take stock and see you paid for it. That's good enough, I believe. But what I want to point out to you is this. The old game was a risky game. The new game's as safe as running a Vienna bakery. We just put this Farallone before the wind, and run till we're well to looard of our port of departure, and reasonably well up with some other place where they have an American consul. Down goes the Farallone, and good-bye to her! A day or so in the boat; the consul packs us home, at Uncle Sam's expense, to 'Frisco; and if that merchant don't put the dollars down, you come to me!" ...|$|E

The original working title of the film was Around. While exploring film title designs for the picture, Carradine came across a style called Americana. [...] "I {{was trying to figure}} out what it would look like if it said Around. Suddenly, I said to myself, 'Why am I doing this, anyway? <b>It's</b> <b>right</b> <b>here</b> in front of me.'

A man like you don't want diamonds and jewellery, nor a gold-headed cane, when it's got {{to be used as a}} crutch. No, sir. What you want is suthin' that won't run away from you; that is always there before you and won't wear out, and will last after you're gone. That's land! And if it wasn't that I have sworn never to sell or give away this house and that garden, if it wasn't that I've held out agin the old woman and Mamie on that point, you should have THIS house and THAT garden. But, mebbee, for the same reason that I've told you, I want that land to keep for myself. But I've selected four acres of the hill this side of my shaft, and here's the deed of it. As soon as you're ready, I'll put you up a house as big as this--that shall be yours, with the land, as long as you live, old man; and after that your children's." ...|$|E

[...] exclaim the {{provoked}} and despairing opposition party, who {{find that there}} is no such thing as going to sleep till they have made the old lady below and the young ladies above understand exactly the philosophy of a lock. After a while the conversation again subsides; again all is still; you hear only the trampling of horses and the rippling of the rope in the water, and sleep again is stealing over you. You doze, you dream, and all of a sudden you are started by a cry, [...] "Chambermaid! wake up the lady that wants to be set ashore." [...] Up jumps chambermaid, and up jump the lady and two children, and forthwith form a committee of inquiry as to ways and means. [...] "Where's my bonnet?" [...] says the lady, half awake, and fumbling among the various articles of that name. [...] "I thought I hung it up behind the door." [...] "Can't you find it?" [...] says poor chambermaid, yawning and rubbing her eyes. [...] "O, yes, here it is," [...] says the lady; and then the cloak, the shawl, the gloves, the shoes, receive each a separate discussion. At last all seems ready, and they begin to move off, when, lo! Peter's cap is missing. [...] "Now, where can it be?" [...] soliloquizes the lady. [...] "I put <b>it</b> <b>right</b> <b>here</b> by the table leg; maybe it got into some of the berths." [...] At this suggestion, the chambermaid takes the candle, and goes round deliberately to every berth, poking the light directly in the face of every sleeper. [...] "Here it is," [...] she exclaims, pulling at something black under one pillow. [...] "No, indeed, those are my shoes," [...] says the vexed sleeper. [...] "Maybe it's here," [...] she resumes, darting upon something dark in another berth. [...] "No, that's my bag," [...] responds the occupant. The chambermaid then proceeds to turn over all the children on the floor, to see if it is not under them. In the course of which process they are most agreeably waked up and enlivened; and when every body is broad awake, and most uncharitably wishing the cap, and Peter too, at the bottom of the canal, the good lady exclaims, [...] "Well, if this isn't lucky; here I had it safe in my basket all the time!" [...] And she departs amid the--what shall I say?--execrations?--of the whole company, ladies though they be.|$|E

"Well, what's {{the matter}} with this country {{is not in the}} least political, but an all round {{entanglement}} of physical, social, and moral evils and corruptions, all more or less due to the unnatural treatment of women. You can't gather figs from thistles, and so long as the system of infant marriage, the prohibition of the remarriage of widows, the lifelong imprisonment of wives and mothers in a worse than penal confinement, and the withholding from them of any kind of education or treatment as rational beings continues, the country can't advance a step.
