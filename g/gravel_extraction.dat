5|$|Lafarge Aggregates owns various {{sites in}} the parish. In 1974 the village won an appeal against Pioneer Concrete's {{application}} for <b>gravel</b> <b>extraction</b> near the village. Similar events took place in March 2003 when hundreds of local residents protested against an application of <b>gravel</b> <b>extraction</b> by Lafarge. Larfarge's initial appeal, in April 2003, was turned down by West Berkshire Council. A further application to extract aggregate at the Wasing Estate was due to be decided in 2010. One former extraction site, Butts Lake Quarry, is now a nature reserve and the flooded lakes {{have been identified as}} a Site of Special Scientific Interest and is now operated by the Berkshire, Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire Wildlife Trust. The reserve contains specimens of trees such as alder, cherry, hawthorn, oak, and willow. Examples of reeds present include typha latifolia, phragmites australis, mentha aquatica, and lythrum salicaria. Numerous species of bird nest in the reserve, including the common teal, shoveler, warbler, kingfisher, water rail, and nightingale.|$|E
5|$|In 1965, the Ministry of Works asked Jones {{to conduct}} an {{excavation}} at Linford, a gravel pit {{near the village of}} Mucking on the Thames Estuary. The site had been discovered in aerial photographs taken by Kenneth St Joseph and confirmed in a small fieldwalking survey by the Thurrock Local History Society. These initial investigations resulted in the site being designated a Scheduled Monument under the Ancient Monuments Act 1931 and, since it was threatened by <b>gravel</b> <b>extraction,</b> prompted the Ministry to commission an exploratory excavation. Jones quickly concluded that the crop marks at Mucking represented an extensive site with Iron Age, Roman, Anglo-Saxon and early Medieval remains. On that basis, the Ministry extended her contract and initiated a full excavation of the site.|$|E
5|$|Later inhabitation of Southcote was {{discovered}} at Anslow's Cottages {{south of the}} Kennet, where excavation suggests that a Bronze Age waterfront was made on {{a branch of the}} river. A 1991 report by the Historic Buildings and Monuments Commission for England—now known as English Heritage—detailed the discovery of fragments of twined basketry at Anslow's Cottages, showing that eel or fish traps were used on the river near Southcote. Archaeological findings of timber structures adjacent to the trap suggest that it dated from the eight or ninth century. Later discoveries, made in the 1980s during <b>gravel</b> <b>extraction</b> in the area, also uncovered evidence of a landing stage or jetty on the river channel.|$|E

5|$|There was {{an ancient}} {{farmstead}} from the 1st {{century to the}} 3rd century in the Upminster area, and agriculture was the predominant industry throughout the following centuries. The area was once wooded, but clearances in the 12th century gave more land over to arable farming; and by the 17th century there were a variety of crops and livestock. There was a growth in market gardening in the 19th century. There {{have been a number}} of windmills in Upminster and one of which, a smock mill built in 1803, remains. Local industry included a tannery, <b>gravel</b> <b>extraction</b> and a brick works that was connected to the railway station by a tramway in 1895.|$|E

40|$|In April 1990, an {{excellently}} preserved cranium {{was found}} during <b>gravel</b> <b>extractions</b> {{from the bottom}} of the river Danube at Moča, in the Komárno district of southern Slovakia. Neither animal, nor archaeological remains were associated with this find. According to the calibrated 14 C date, the individual had lived during the second half of the twelfth millennia cal BC, during the Late Upper Palaeolithic. The geologic-morphological background of this find, combined with absolute dating, made the reconstruction of its approximately primary position possible. The skull’s primary fossilization site is presumed to have been somewhere on the periphery of the local Kravany Terrace of the Danube. Both the fossiliferous layer sediments and the skull were later eroded and transported to the flood plain. Regarding the skull, its sex, age, morphology and morphometrics were investigated. The partly fossilised cranium was of an adult female, most probably aged 40 ± 10 years. Her skull has a gracile to moderate construction, with moderately marked muscle relief. The Moča find adds to the small collection of directly dated Late Upper Palaeolithic humans in Central Europe. Measurements of the Moča skull and most of its morphology are mainly within the recent human remains variability; however, it does not basically differ from the Late Upper Palaeolithic sample. Conversely, some of its measurements, e. g. great basion-prosthion length, individualize it...|$|R

25|$|As {{a result}} of this {{exploratory}} dig, and of the earlier investigations, Jones' contract was extended and she was appointed director of the full scale excavations. She was joined by her husband Tom and in 1965 (after the crops had been harvested) they began the mammoth task that was to last for the next 14years on the Mucking hill top. The excavation was unusual in that it continued through the winter, unlike most excavations which only took place in the summer. The need to stay ahead of the <b>gravel</b> <b>extraction</b> sometimes meant softening the frozen ground with a blow torch to enable a find to be lifted in time.|$|E
25|$|Ashford is in {{the almost}} flat {{alluvial}} plain formed by the historic courses of the River Thames on fairly fertile but gravelly soil in centuries past covered by deciduous forest for wood gathering, with clearings of meadow for pasture {{and to a lesser}} extent arable farming to supply the London market; sheep grazing continues today around the reservoirs. In common with western fringes of Greater London, gravel commences often within a metre of the surface which has led to 20th-century <b>gravel</b> <b>extraction,</b> which has formed the lakes to the north of the railway line. The extreme west is Shortwood Common, partly converted to a recreation ground, Ashford Park School, a cemetery.|$|E
25|$|Over 100 {{lakes and}} ponds {{can be found}} within the forest varying in size and age. They all provide {{important}} habitats for numerous species of fauna and flora.

Activities allowed on the waters include angling which is permitted in 24 of the lakes and ponds. A wide range of freshwater fish can be caught. All of the lakes and ponds are accessible to the public and are located on or close to forest paths.|$|E
50|$|The main {{economic}} activity of the Feltham area was market gardening {{until well into the}} twentieth century.

40|$|International audienceThe Durance River is a gravel-bed river deeply {{impacted}} in its downstream part by gravel {{mining and}} flow diversion. The {{modification of the}} flow regime and the <b>gravel</b> <b>extractions</b> {{have led to a}} significant reduction of the bankfull channel width (from 50 to 80 % for the 1960 - 2000 period), a river bed degradation and, above all, a vegetation encroachment associated to an important overbank sedimentation. These changes result in a modification of flowing conditions during floods and an increase in flood risk because the lateral mobility is not high enough to rework regularly the vegetated landforms. Therefore lateral mobility processes and rate have to be better understood and quantified. We work on three different spatial scales (bar, bend and reach scales) in order to characterize and quantify the lateral mobility. First of all, at fine scale, we use PIT Tags and an event topographic survey to study the entrainment threshold variability of the particles of the bar and the bank toe. Then the link between discharge, lateral bank mobility and vertical channel mobility is investigated at bend scale thanks to event topographic survey and physical characterization of the bed material (size and shape). Finally, the lateral mobility quantification at reach scale requires both a diachronic study on orthophoto and an in situ topographic survey. The first results highlight not only a coupled mobility between bank and channel but also a high spatial variability of lateral mobility linked to both local hydrodynamic conditions and geographical position of sediment sources...|$|R

25|$|For much of {{its history}} Rainham was an {{agricultural}} settlement, using the River Thames for trade. In the 16th century industry was limited to a boat-builder and tannery. There are links between Rainham farms and the City of London from the Middle Ages and after the wharf was redeveloped in the 1720s trade increased; including the bringing of muck from London {{for use in the}} fields. By 1929 most of the farmland had been given over to market gardening. The ferry to London was supplemented with new coaching links in the 18th century and a railway station opened in 1854. A second wharf was constructed in 1872 and from 1869 there was a growth in industrial development, including chemical and fertiliser factories. The Murex iron-founders moved to Rainham in 1917 and grew along the river, eventually becoming part of the British Oxygen Company. Away from the river, other industries included brickmaking and after World War II there was a growth in <b>gravel</b> <b>extraction.</b>|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the heavy}} human populations and high level of {{industrialization}} along its shores, the wildlife of the North Sea has suffered from pollution, overhunting, and overfishing. Flamingos and pelicans were once found along the southern shores of the North Sea, but became extinct over the 2nd millennium. Walruses frequented the Orkney Islands through the mid-16th century, as both Sable Island and Orkney Islands lay within its normal range. Gray whales also resided in the North Sea but were driven to extinction in the Atlantic in the 17th century Other species have dramatically declined in population, though they are still found. North Atlantic right whales, sturgeon, shad, rays, skates, salmon, and other species were common in the North Sea until the 20th century, when numbers declined due to overfishing. Other factors like the introduction of non-indigenous species, industrial and agricultural pollution, trawling and dredging, human-induced eutrophication, construction on coastal breeding and feeding grounds, sand and <b>gravel</b> <b>extraction,</b> offshore construction, and heavy shipping traffic have {{also contributed to the}} decline.|$|E
25|$|A notable {{exception}} to this trend are the inshore diamond diving operations {{on the west coast}} of South Africa, where hookah is still the standard equipment for diamondiferous <b>gravel</b> <b>extraction</b> in the hostile conditions of the surf zone, where the water temperature is usually around 8 to 10°C, visibility is usually low, and surge is often strong. Divers work shifts of about two hours with a crowbar and a suction hose, are heavily weighted to stay in place while working, and the standard method of ascent is to ditch the weighted harness and regulator and make a free swimming ascent. The next diver will free dive down the airline, fit the regulator and wriggle into the harness before continuing with the job. Until the South African abalone fishery was closed, hookah was the only mode of diving permitted for harvesting wild abalone, and several aspects of this practice were in direct contravention of the diving regulations at the time. Abalone divers were not allowed to have a standby diver on the boat.|$|E

500|$|Academic archaeologists criticised Jones' work at Mucking {{as one of}} {{the prime}} {{examples}} of [...] "excavation without publication". They argued that since the primary aim of any archaeological excavation is [...] "preservation by record", failing to publish the results amounted to destroying the archaeology without purpose, and that it was irresponsible to excavate large areas without the means to properly process and disseminate the results. Indeed, in thirteen years of continuous excavation at Mucking, Jones only published a single, short paper on the results of her trial excavations in 1965. When the project was completed in 1978, despite the huge volume of material that had been recovered, very little had been analysed and none had been published. Ultimately, the final publication of Mucking was undertaken by others (English Heritage and the Cambridge Archaeological Unit), the first volume of which did not appear until 2015, fourteen years after Jones' death. Jones argued that as the site was being constantly destroyed by the <b>gravel</b> <b>extraction</b> on the site, she could not afford to take time out of the year for post-excavation, nor did she have the funding to complete it.|$|E

40|$|Cambridgeshire {{has been}} subject to {{widespread}} <b>gravel</b> (aggregates) <b>extraction</b> throughout the 20 th century and, like {{much of the rest}} of the country, intensively since World War 2. The county is crossed by three great river valleys - the Cam, the Great Ouse and the Nene - that produced large swathes of river gravels thus creating the local resource for extraction. A considerable amount of archaeological records have been generated by this extraction activity and collectively these records provide details of human habitation and impact on the Cambridgeshire landscape from the Palaeolithic through, unbroken and often in great detail, to the modern day. An investigation of this material affords an opportunity to chronicle the landscape history of great swathes of Cambridgeshire and to contribute to both the archaeological and palaeontological records. A study by Oxford Archaeology East has been carried out as part of an Aggregates Levy Sustainability Fund (ALSF) commission to identify and assess the full spectrum of archaeological records and interventions on the Cambridgeshire Gravels, and subsequently to identify the degree to which backlogs of analysis and publications exist...|$|R
40|$|In the UK, at present, the {{majority}} of aggregate materials, for all construction applications, are obtained from primary resources such as crushed rock and sand and <b>gravel.</b> Material <b>extraction</b> results in many adverse environmental impacts and utilisation consumes a finite natural resource. In the UK we also produce large quantities of waste and by-product materials, from industrial and domestic activities, that require management or disposal. To maintain levels of development and construction but reduce the utilisation of primary aggregates, two principal options are available: optimise the use of primary materials or utilise alternative materials. This paper summarises ongoing research at the University of Nottingham, UK, which addresses both of these issues for aggregates used in road construction and bulk fill. Predictions of the in-situ performance of alternative and conventional aggregate materials have been investigated as regards both mechanical and environmental loading. Performance based mechanical specifications have been developed using a repeated load triaxial test and indirect tensile test for assessing untreated and treated materials.

40|$|This article {{examines}} {{the way in which}} an environmental 'problem' comes to be constructed as such. It takes as a case study the issue of sand and <b>gravel</b> aggregate <b>extraction</b> from the Brisbane River, in South-east Queensland, and analyses how this came to be defined as a 'problem' requiring a policy response on the part of key decision-makers, including concrete companies, local and state government agencies, riverside residents and environmental groups. The dispute over whether dredging should be labeled as an environmental problem is analysed using the theory of environmental claims-making, which provides an analytical structure for identifying the three major stages through which environmental problems are constructed, namely: assembling, presenting and contesting claims. In addition, we discuss the process of 'non-decision making' by which certain policy options are ruled out from consideration and political action. Data were collected from interviews with key players in the dredging dispute, and were combined with analysis of relevant documents and newspaper articles. The environmental claims-making analysis illustrates the way that environmental problems are socially constructed and therefore can be fully understood only when placed in their social, cultural and political context.

50|$|Starting {{from the}} 1960s the northeastern {{flank of the}} volcano was quarried for lapilli <b>gravel.</b> The <b>extraction</b> of {{material}} from the volcano cone and the degradation of the volcanoes of the Garrotxa Volcanic Field sparked a series of protests in the 1970s to protect the volcanic field, a campaign {{that came to be}} known as Save the Volcanoes (Salvem els Volcans). The extraction area was also used as an uncontrolled municipal landfill for the city of Olot. In 1982 the Garrotxa Volcanic Zone Natural Park was created to protect the area but the extraction lasted for another nine years. Further protests were sparked after an agreement was reached between the concessionaire of the quarry, Minas de Olot, SA, and the Generalitat of Catalonia for the further extraction of 2.7 million tons with educational and scientific purposes, with the commitment of restoration of all excavated areas. The successive non-fulfillment of the restoration program resulted in the issue of at least ten disciplinary proceedings in the subsequent years. The mining operations were stopped in 1991, when the Generalitat of Catalonia acquired the majority of shares of the mining company.|$|R
