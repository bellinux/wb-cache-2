40|$|Nodularin is a cyclic pentapeptide {{produced}} by the cyanobacterium Nodularia spumigena. This cyanotoxin {{is responsible for the}} contamination of water bodies, and potentially can lead to human illness. Current analytical techniques that quantify nodularin often require several sample preparation steps that are time consuming and use organic solvents. Our objective was to develop a simple, relatively fast and solventless method for extracting and quantifying nodularin using solid-phase microextraction (SPME) coupled with high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Two concentrations of nodularin (1 ppm and 10 ppb) were used to evaluate extraction capabilities of Carbowax/Templated (CW/TPR, 50 ?m) coated SPME <b>fibres.</b> <b>Extraction</b> efficiency of the nodularin solutions was optimised by adjusting the salt concentration to 30 % (w/w), decreasing pH to 2 and exposing the SPME fibre to the nodularin solutions for either 60 or 120 minutes, depending on nodularin concentration. Under optimised conditions, the SPME-HPLC methodology produced linear, reproducible calibration curves using fresh or seawater samples spiked with nodularin. Results suggest that SPME-HPLC could be useful in screening nodularin-contaminated water samples, with the added advantage over other traditional extraction methods of being relatively quick, simple and solventless which avoids the dangers of occupational exposure and disposal of organic solvents...|$|R

The fibre content was determined by different methods and a correlation was found between the values obtained by warm water retting and the autoclave procedure. However, the data obtained by green decortication show up to 20 nd on average 15 igher fibre content values. This higher value roughly corresponds to the weight of the cuticula and remaining xylem tissue that is more efficiently removed by retting and autoclave treatments. The reproducibility of this fibre content determination method for small straw sample analysis (25 g) is a promising tool for accelerated breeding protocol...|$|E
40|$|Commonly, {{fibre hemp}} (Cannabis sativa) is not {{considered}} {{for the production of}} soft and easy-care textiles. However, initial tests in the textile industry have shown that certain processes allow improvement in the everyday-wear characteristics of hemp textiles. In the framework of the EU R&D project Hemp-sys [QLRT- 01 - 01363] the potential of hemp as a feedstock in textile processing is investigated. Therefore, a detailed study on the effects of agronomy and <b>fibre</b> <b>extraction</b> processing on fibre properties for textile processing has been carried out. To relate the crop growing conditions with fibre quality and productivity it is required that information is obtained on hemp bast fibre formation. At various stages of the plant development the fibre development has been monitored by microscopic techniques. The two distinct bast fibre types occurring in hemp-the so called primary and secondary fibres-show different and independent development. The primary fibres appear earlier in the development in the rapid growth stage and are formed from the primary meristem in the outer layers (phloem). Primary fibres are thick, extremely long and with compact cell walls and small lumen and are present from bottom to top of the plant. In contrast, the secondary fibres are formed in later stages during thickness growth from the secondary meristem. Secondary fibres are thinner, shorter and with higher lignin content than the primary fibres. In early developmental stages secondary fibres only occur {{at the bottom of the}} stem. Substantial secondary fibre formation is observed at the start of flowering or when the plants grow taller than 2. 25 m and/or thicker than approximately 1 cm. Based upon these observations a selection of conditions can be made for growing and harvesting of hemp to obtain the best quality fibre for textile processing. To produce a crop with maximum amount of primary fibres free from secondary fibres, the recommended practice is to grow hemp at high seed density to avoid thickness growth and to harvest the hemp stems around flowering of the plants...|$|E
40|$|The {{analysis}} of volatile compounds in Funchal, Madeira, Mateus and Perry Vidal cultivars of Annona cherimola Mill. (cherimoya) {{was carried out}} by headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) combined with gas chromatography–quadrupole mass spectrometry detection (GC–qMSD). HS-SPME technique was optimized in terms of <b>fibre</b> selection, <b>extraction</b> time, extraction temperature and sample amount to reach the best extraction efficiency. The best result was obtained with 2 g of sample, using a divinylbenzene/carboxen/polydimethylsiloxane (DVB/CAR/PDMS) fibre for 30 min at 30 °C under constant magnetic stirring (800 rpm). After optimization of the extraction methodology, all the cherimoya samples were analysed with the best conditions that allowed to identify about 60 volatile compounds. The major compounds identified in the four cherimoya cultivars were methyl butanoate, butyl butanoate, 3 -methylbutyl butanoate, 3 -methylbutyl 3 -methylbutanoate and 5 -hydroxymethyl- 2 -furfural. These compounds represent 69. 08 ± 5. 22 %, 56. 56 ± 15. 36 %, 56. 69 ± 9. 28 % and 71. 82 ± 1. 29 % of the total volatiles for Funchal, Madeira, Mateus and Perry Vidal cultivars, respectively. This study showed that each cherimoya cultivars have 40 common compounds, corresponding to different chemical families, namely terpenes, esters, alcohols, fatty acids and carbonyl compounds and using PCA, the volatile composition in terms of average peak areas, provided a suitable tool to differentiate among the cherimoya cultivars...|$|R
40|$|The {{interfacial}} {{shear strength}} (IFSS), evaluated by single fibre pull-out tests was quantified for various biopolymer-flax fibre composites that were modified with additives. The additives included a plasticiser (glycerol triacetate) (GTA) absorbed onto/into the fibres, 4, 4 &# 039;-thiodiphenol (TDP) that {{is capable of}} forming hydrogen bonds between the matrix and cellulose from the fibres, and a hyperbranched polyester (HBP) to impart improved fracture toughness. Fibres were washed with acetone to remove the surface impurities and dried under vacuum before absorption of plasticiser and adsorption of thiodiphenol. It was found that the different additives significantly influenced the IFSS for the biopolymer-flax <b>fibre</b> systems while <b>extraction</b> with acetone had a no effect on the IFSS compared with the untreated fibres. The use of TDP imparted the most significant increase in IFSS whilst the HBP had an opposing effect. The use of ESEM corroborated with the findings of the single fibre pull-out tests...|$|R
40|$|Solid phase microextraction (SPME) {{offers a}} solvent-free and less {{labour-intensive}} alternative to traditional flavour isolation techniques. In this instance, SPME was optimised for {{the extraction of}} 17 stale flavour volatiles (C 3 - 11, 13 methyl ketones and C 4 - 10 saturated aldehydes) from the headspace of full-cream ultrahigh-temperature (UHT) -processed milk. A comparison of relative extraction efficiencies was made using three <b>fibre</b> coatings, three <b>extraction</b> times and three extraction temperatures. Linearity of calibration curves, limits of detection and repeatability (coefficients of variation) were also used in determining the optimum extraction conditions. A 2 cm fibre coating of 50130 gm divinylbenzene/Carboxen/polydimethylsiloxane {{in conjunction with a}} 15 min extraction at 40 degrees C were chosen as the final optimum conditions. This method can be used as an objective tool for monitoring the flavour quality of UHT milk during storage. (c) 2005 Society of Chemical Industry...|$|R
