In December, Plymouth ship breaker Sidney Castle won the tender to dismantle the railway. The remaining track was lifted by June 1936, and in September, surviving loco Lew was shipped to Brazil.

Mark Aguirre and James Donaldson both played in the 1988 NBA All-Star Game, the Mavericks rattled off a franchise-best 11-game winning streak, and Rolando Blackman scored his 10,000th career point. Aguirre led the team in scoring for the sixth consecutive year with 25.1 points per game, and Roy Tarpley won the NBA Sixth Man Award with averages of 13.5 points and 11.8 rebounds. The season saw the Mavs' deepest playoff run to date. They dispatched the Houston Rockets in four games and the Nuggets in six, leaving only the defending NBA Champion Lakers between them and their first-ever trip to the NBA Finals.

Sepinwall also praised the Chris/April pairing and the fact that Adam Scott got to do more than play his usual straight man role.

Lynnette Porter feels that Ianto's demise is intended as a watershed moment where Jack loses his effectiveness as a hero.

500|$|February was a busy {{month for}} the club. Benfica trailed Porto by 11 points in the Primeira Liga, with crucial European and {{domestic}} cup matches between league matches. The first was on 2 February against Nacional. Like past home performances, Benfica failed to score and lost points in another scoreless draw. Camacho tried to explain his team's performance: [...] "We did not lack attitude, but at home, we sometimes feel disturbed, pressured. We played two forwards and we still did not score." [...] He saw his first white handkerchiefs, an action commonly seen as a request for resignation. Benfica regained their feet with a home win against Paços de Ferreira in the Portuguese Cup. An opening goal by Pedrinha in the second minute was answered with an equaliser by Cardozo before half-time. In the second half, Cardozo, Rui Costa and Nuno Assis scored to send Benfica to the quarter-finals. On 14 February, Benfica hosted 1. FC Nürnberg {{in the first of}} two games against the German team. Recent acquisition Ariza Makukula scored the only goal in the 43rd minute, a 20-meter strike which fooled goalkeeper Jaromír Blažek. Camacho called the narrow victory important. Three days later, Benfica played Naval at the Municipal José Bento Pessoa. Cristian Rodríguez scored the club's opening goal in the 18th minute, with László Sepsi assisting Nuno Assis on a second goal in the final minute. On 21 February, Benfica played the second leg of their European double-header with Nürnberg. The Bundesliga side scored twice in seven minutes during the second half before Cardozo scored in the 89th minute and Di María tied the game in the 92nd, sending Benfica to the round of 16 with Spanish side Getafe. Camacho said, [...] "Benfica made some defensive errors in the second half that put them in a though spot. They managed to react and continued their search for goals until they arrived." [...] In domestic-league play, Benfica hosted Braga on 24 January. Braga scored first with a fifth-minute goal by Zé Manel, with Luisão tying the game in the 21sth minute. The draw complicated the league race, with Porto increasing their lead. Camacho said, [...] "Benfica did <b>everything</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> win. They tried to score from every way possible, but could not". The club ended the month with a 2–0 victory over Moreirense in the Portuguese Cup, sending them to the semi-finals.|$|E
