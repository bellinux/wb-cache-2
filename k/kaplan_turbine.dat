5000|$|The <b>Kaplan</b> <b>turbine</b> was an {{evolution}} of the Francis turbine. Its invention allowed efficient power production in low-head applications that was not possible with Francis turbines. The head ranges from 10-70 metres and the output from 5 to 200 MW. Runner diameters are between 2 and 11 metres. Turbines rotate at a constant rate, which varies from facility to facility. That rate ranges from as low as 69.2 rpm (Bonneville North Powerhouse, Washington U.S.) to 429 rpm. The <b>Kaplan</b> <b>turbine</b> installation believed to generate the most power from its nominal head of 34.65 m is as of 2013 the Tocoma Dam Power Plant (Venezuela) <b>Kaplan</b> <b>turbine</b> generating 230 MW (Turbine capacity, 257MVA for generator) with each of ten 8.6 m diameter runners.|$|E
