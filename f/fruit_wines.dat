Sea buckthorn-based juice is popular in Germany and Scandinavian countries. It provides a nutritious beverage, rich in vitamin C and carotenoids.|$|E
25|$|The Saccharomyces (sugar mold) yeast genus {{is favored}} for {{winemaking}} (for both grapes {{as well as}} other <b>fruit</b> <b>wines</b> in addition also to being used in brewing and breadmaking) because of the generally reliable and positive attributes it can bring to the wine. These yeasts will usually readily ferment glucose, sucrose and raffinose and metabolize glucose, sucrose, raffinose, maltose and ethanol. However, Saccharomyces cannot ferment or utilize pentoses (such as arabinose) which is usually present in small amount in wines as residual sugars.|$|E
25|$|Wine {{production}} in Oregon, like {{elsewhere in the}} United States, shut down during the Prohibition era, but resumed in 1933. The Oregon wine industry remained small for several decades, and was dominated by <b>fruit</b> <b>wines</b> rather (including wines based on grapes other than Vitas vinifera), {{by that time the}} California wine industry, with its warmer climate, had come to dominate wine {{production in}} the United States. Only two Oregon wineries produced wine using V. vinifera through the middle of the century; both on a rather small scale.|$|E

25|$|Yeast consumes {{the sugar}} in the grapes and {{converts}} it to ethanol and carbon dioxide. Different varieties of grapes and strains of yeasts produce different styles of wine. These variations result from the complex interactions between the biochemical development of the grape, the reactions involved in fermentation, the terroir, and the production process. Many countries enact legal appellations intended to define styles and qualities of wine. These typically restrict the geographical origin and permitted varieties of grapes, {{as well as other}} aspects of wine production. Wines not made from grapes include rice wine and <b>fruit</b> <b>wines</b> such as plum, cherry, pomegranate and elderberry.|$|E
25|$|While soju is {{the best}} known liquor, there are well over 100 {{different}} alcoholic beverages, such as beers, rice and <b>fruit</b> <b>wines,</b> and liquors produced in South Korea {{as well as a}} sweet rice drink. The top-selling domestic beers (the Korean term for beer being maekju) are lagers, which differ from Western beers in that they are brewed from rice, rather than barley. Consequently, Korean beers are lighter, sweeter and have less head than their Western counterparts. The South Korean beer market is dominated by the two major breweries: Hite and OB. Taedonggang is a North Korean beer produced at a brewery based in Pyongyang since 2002. Microbrewery beers and bars are growing in popularity after 2002.|$|E

25|$|The first {{vineyard}} {{planted in}} the Okanagan was at the Oblate Mission in Kelowna in 1859, planted by French Catholic priest Charles Pandosy and was solely intended {{for the production of}} sacramental wine for the celebration of the Eucharist. Several small vineyards, planted mostly with Vitis labrusca sprang up until prohibition encouraged the uprooting and replanting with other agricultural crops. For most of the 20th century after prohibition, what limited wine production {{that took place in the}} Okanagan was mostly <b>fruit</b> <b>wines</b> made from berries, apples, cherries or even table grapes. One winery, Calona Wines founded in 1932, still remains from that period and was the first commercial winery in British Columbia and remains the oldest continuously running winery in the province. Eventually the use of French-American hybrid grapes, such as Marechal Foch and Vidal blanc took hold, led by the Stewarts of Quails' Gate Estate Winery.|$|E
25|$|In California, American {{sparkling}} wine producers wishing {{to emulate the}} Champagne method began planting Pinot Meunier in the 1980s. Today most of the state's plantings {{are located in the}} Carneros AVA. Bouchaine Vineyards, Mumm Napa and Domaine Chandon are a few wineries in the all of the Napa Valley to produce a still Pinot Meunier. In Australia, the grape has had a longer history in Australian wine production than Pinot noir. In the Grampians region of Victoria, Pinot Meunier was known at one time as Miller's Burgundy and used to make still red varietal wine. In the late 20th century plantings were starting to decline until a revival of Champagne-style {{sparkling wine}} took hold in the 2000s which sparked renewed interest in Pinot Meunier. The New Zealand wine industry has recently discovered Pinot Meunier for both still & sparkling wine production. As a varietal red wine, Pinot Meunier tends to produce slightly jammy, <b>fruit</b> <b>wines</b> with moderate acidity and low tannins.|$|E

2500|$|Wine {{production}} in the Okanagan dates to the 1850s, {{with the establishment of}} Okanagan Mission and the planting of grapevines to supply sacramental wines. In the early 20th century, prohibition in Canada wiped out many of the Okanagan's earliest wineries and the commercial wine industry in the area was not revived until the 1930s. From this time through the mid-1970s, the Okanagan wine industry was based entirely on the production of <b>fruit</b> <b>wines</b> and those produced from hybrid grapes.|$|E
