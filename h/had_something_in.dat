According to Chris Davids, {{a high school}} classmate in Cho's English class at Westfield High School, Cho looked down and refused to speak when called upon. Davids added that, after one teacher {{threatened}} to give Cho a failing grade for not participating in class, he began reading in a strange, deep voice that sounded [...] "like he <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>in</b> his mouth. [...] " [...] While several students recalled instances of Cho being bullied and mocked at Westfield, most left him alone and later {{said they were not}} aware of his anger. Cho graduated from Westfield High School in 2003.|$|E
500|$|Early on, I {{realized}} {{that what this}} particular crew needed from me was not pressure but the light touch. [...] Once informed of our objective, their enthusiasm infected everything they did, and here and there might easily have caused stress-related dysfunction. [...] Extended separation from home and family with no means of communications {{was not a problem}} — submariners are used to that — but bearing down too much on the job might be. [...] My concern was about our performance in an emergency, being at the same time unable to predict what emergencies might be in store for us. [...] It was important, I thought, to hold back on the pressure until a really tough problem came up. [...] This happened several times, as I knew it would, and I was glad I <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>in</b> reserve.|$|E

500|$|Peel's {{view was}} contested by Anderson's and Cull's {{belief that the}} series, with its bespectacled main {{character}} of Joe McClaine, can increase the self-confidence of young viewers who wear glasses: [...] "Suddenly they were proud because they <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>in</b> common with Joe 90." [...] Since the series' first appearance, the epithet [...] "Joe 90" [...] has become a popular term of endearment for both children and adults with glasses reminiscent of Joe's (such as snooker player Dennis Taylor). During UK repeats in the 1990s, similarities were drawn between Joe and then-Prime Minister John Major, also known for wearing large spectacles. Jeff Evans, writer of The Penguin TV Companion, criticises the plot element of the glasses, writing, [...] "Joe simply dons a pair of scientific glasses, making him look like the class swot than a secret agent." ...|$|E
500|$|On 24 August {{he was at}} White Webbs near Enfield, with Anne Vaux, {{her sister}} Eleanor Brooksby, her nephew William Brooksby and his wife Dorothy. [...] A few days later the group {{set out on a}} pilgrimage to St Winefride's Well at Holywell in Wales. [...] They {{travelled}} to John Grant's home at Norbrook, then Huddington Court near Worcester, through Shrewsbury, and finally to Wales. [...] About 30people made the journey west, including Everard Digby and his wife, and their secret chaplain Edward Oldcorne, and Nicholas Owen. On his return from Wales, Garnet travelled with Anne Vaux to Rushton Hall, home of the recently deceased Thomas Tresham (father to Francis Tresham). [...] From there they travelled to Digby's home at Gayhurst House in Buckinghamshire. [...] Vaux was suspicious that so many horses were being collected at the homes of her friends and family, and confessed to Garnet her fear that [...] "these wild heads <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>in</b> hand". [...] She asked him to speak with Catesby, but Garnet reassured her that Catesby was instead seeking a commission in Flanders. [...] Garnet wrote a letter of recommendation for Catesby for that very purpose. When in October Vaux raised the issue once more, claiming that several women had asked her where they should retreat to once [...] "the brunt was passed in the beginning of Parliament", Garnet again mentioned Flanders, although Fraser suggests that Vaux's questioning must have concerned him deeply.|$|E

2500|$|It was whilst at Birmingham (1905 to 1911) Boughton was {{presented}} with many new opportunities and made many friends. He proved an excellent teacher and an outstanding choral conductor which won him much recognition. He was drawn into socialist ideas through the writings of John Ruskin, William Morris, Edward Carpenter and George Bernard Shaw, the last with whom he developed a lifelong relationship. It was also during those years that he became attached to the young art student, Christina Walshe, who was later to become his partner and artistic [...] "right-hand man" [...] for his Glastonbury projects. His friendship with Shaw had begun when Boughton had been turned down from his invitation to collaborate on an opera. Shaw initially refused {{to be associated with}} any of Boughton's music but Boughton would not be dissuaded and eventually Shaw realised they <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>in</b> common that was to endure.|$|E
2500|$|Nina Eliade {{fell ill}} with uterine cancer and died during their stay in Lisbon, in late 1944. As the widower later wrote, {{the disease was}} {{probably}} caused by an abortion procedure she had undergone {{at an early stage}} of their relationship. He came to suffer from clinical depression, which increased as Romania and her Axis allies suffered major defeats on the Eastern Front. Contemplating a return to Romania as a soldier or a monk, he was on a continuous search for effective antidepressants, medicating himself with passion flower extract, and, eventually, with methamphetamine. This was probably not his first experience with drugs: vague mentions in his notebooks have been read as indication that Mircea Eliade was taking opium during his travels to Calcutta. Later, discussing the works of Aldous Huxley, Eliade wrote that the British author's use of mescaline as a source of inspiration <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>in</b> common with his own experience, indicating 1945 as a date of reference and adding that it was [...] "needless to explain why that is".|$|E
2500|$|Garner rose to fame in 2001 {{when she}} was cast as {{the star of the}} ABC spy drama Alias. The show's creator, J.J. Abrams, wrote the part of Sydney Bristow with Garner in mind: [...] "I always thought she <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>in</b> her {{personality}} that was funnier and sexier and smarter and more mischievous than anything I'd seen her do ... I wanted to show that." [...] However, he had to convince wary studio executives that Garner was right for the role. Robert Bianco of USA Today remarked: [...] "You've probably never noticed her. You'll notice her now ... Garner creates one of the season's strongest new characters — a sensitive young woman who hides her vulnerability behind a mean right cross." [...] Julie Salamon of The New York Times said she brought [...] "an attractive combination of vulnerability and entrepreneurial self-protectiveness" [...] to the role. Alias aired for five seasons between 2001 and 2006; Garner's salary began at $40,000 per episode and rose to $150,000 per episode by the series' end. During the show's run, Garner won a Screen Actors Guild Award for Best Actress and a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress (with a further three Globe nominations), and received four nominations for the Emmy Award for Best Actress.|$|E

2500|$|By this time, {{however, the}} taste in French art for a cool and {{classical}} form of Baroque that {{had set in}} from the 1620s was already reducing the appreciation of Bellange, whose reputation continued to fall, along with that of Mannerism in general. For the same reason, there are no artists who {{can be seen to}} have been directly influenced by Bellange's style. Unlike the Dutch and Italians, French artists had no large collection of biographies until {{the latter part of the}} century, but the great print collector Michel de Marolles was aware of 47 or 48 prints by Bellange, most of which were in his collections; these would not be exactly the same as the 47 or 48 in modern works, but very largely so. By the mid-18th century, the great French authority Pierre-Jean Mariette was scornful and dismissive: [...] "Bellange is one of those painters whose licentious manner, completely removed from a proper style, deserves great distrust. It nevertheless had its admirers, and Bellange had a great vogue. ... Several pieces by him are known, which one cannot bear to look at, so bad is their taste". Many biographical compendiums simply omitted him, even as late as the 1920s. Another judgment of 1767 was quoted with approval by A. P. F. Robert-Dumesnil in his biographical dictionary Le Peintre-Graveur Français (1841), complaining that Bellange's etchings had [...] "much more bizarreness than judgment, and very little correctness". However, Robert-Dumesnil did recognise that his style <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>in</b> common with the Romantics.|$|E
2500|$|Stevens {{also took}} part—illegally—in {{lobbying}} for the statehood bill, {{working closely with}} the Alaska Statehood Committee from his office at Interior. Stevens hired Margaret Atwood, daughter of Anchorage Times publisher Robert Atwood, who was chairman of the Alaska Statehood Committee, to work with him in the Interior Department. [...] "We were violating the law," [...] Stevens told a researcher in an October 1977 oral history interview for the Eisenhower Library. [...] "e were lobbying from the executive branch, and there's been a statute against that for a long time.... We more or less, I would say, masterminded the House and Senate attack from the executive branch." [...] Stevens and the younger Atwood created file cards on members of Congress based on [...] "whether they were Rotarians or Kiwanians or Catholics or Baptists and veterans or loggers, the whole thing," [...] Stevens said in the 1977 interview. [...] "And we'd assigned these Alaskans to go talk to individual members of the Senate and split them down on the basis of people that <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>in</b> common with them." [...] The lobbying campaign extended to presidential press conferences. [...] "We set Ike up quite often at press conferences by planting questions about Alaska statehood," [...] Stevens said in the 1977 interview. [...] "We never let a press conference go by without getting someone to try to ask him about statehood." [...] Newspapers were also targeted, according to Stevens. [...] "We planted editorials in weeklies and dailies and newspapers in the district of people we thought were opposed to us or states where they were opposed to us so that suddenly they were thinking twice about opposing us." ...|$|E
2500|$|Reading {{the words}} of [...] "And the Lord was with Joseph, {{and he was a}} prosperous man; and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian," [...] the Zohar taught that {{wherever}} the righteous walk, God protects them and never abandons them. The Zohar taught that Joseph walked through [...] "the valley of the shadow of death" [...] (in {{the words of}} [...] ), having been brought down to Egypt, but the Shechinah was with him, as [...] states, [...] "And the Lord was with Joseph." [...] Because of the Shechinah's presence, all that Joseph did prospered in his hand. If he <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>in</b> his hand and his master wanted something else, it changed in his hand to the thing that his master wanted. Hence, [...] says, [...] "made to prosper in his hand," [...] as God was with him. Noting that [...] does not say, [...] "And his master knew," [...] but [...] "And his master saw," [...] the Zohar deduced that Potiphar saw every day with his eyes the miracles that God performed by the hand of Joseph. [...] reports, [...] "the Lord blessed the Egyptian's house for Joseph's sake," [...] and the Zohar taught that God guards the righteous, and for their sakes also guards the wicked with whom they are associated, so that the wicked receive blessings through the righteous. The Zohar told that Joseph was thrown into the dungeon, in the words of [...] "His feet they hurt with fetters, his person was laid in iron." [...] And then God liberated him and made him ruler over Egypt, fulfilling the words of [...] which reports that God [...] "forsakes not his saints; they are preserved forever." [...] Thus the Zohar taught that God shields the righteous in this world and in the world to come.|$|E
