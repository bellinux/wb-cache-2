40|$|Checking the tree-ring {{structure}} of 39 living and 9 crossdated dead samples of Swissstone pine (Pinus cembra L.) {{collected from the}} upper timberline of the CalimaniMts. we haveidentified 59 frost rings over the past 250 years. We found concentrated occurrence of frost events inthree decades: in the 1790 s, 1810 s and 1910 s. No <b>frost</b> <b>ring</b> was observed in two bidecadal periods: 1750 - 1770 and 1850 - 1870. Out of the analysed interval 1963 - 2004 is the longest period without frostring occurrence. After 1920 both frequency and severity of frost events seem to decrease compared tothe prior 170 years. We determined the altitude of highest growing stone pine individuals in theBradului Ciont–Pietrosu region in June, 2006. Individuals were sorted into tree-form or bush-likemorphological groups. Mean elevation data of the groups were corrected by an estimated constant biasof GPS measurements (- 30 m). Comparing the corrected values to early 20 th century inventory data 65 m and 95 m upward migration was determined for treeline and boundary of bush-like occurence,respectively. The parallel {{results suggest that the}} 20 th century advance of the upper forest limit wasdue to the decrease of frost stress at the zone of timberline...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of analysis of the Miocene woods collected from three sampling sites in the Polish part of the Carpathian Foredeep. The location in the stratigraphic profile and the state of fossil preservation indicate that the woods were transported by waters flowing from highland or from mountainous regions and then deposited and fossilised in delta areas. Fragments of 16 lignified or silicified woods were collected for anatomical research. The fossil woods were classified as Piceoxylon piceae, Juniperoxylon pachyderma, Cupressinoxylon canadense and Cupressinoxylon poloni-cum. Disturbance zones observed in Cupressinoxylon polonicum are interpreted as <b>frost</b> <b>rings.</b> <b>Frost</b> <b>rings</b> suggest that despite the documented existence of warm and humid climatic conditions during the Miocene period, the temperatures in mountainous areas could temporarily drop below freezing point...|$|R

40|$|Various {{attempts}} have been made to link tree-ring and ice-core records, something vital for the understanding of the environmental response to major volcanic eruptions in the past. Here we demonstrate that, by taking note of the spacing between events, it is possible to clarify linkages between tree-response, as witnessed by <b>frost</b> <b>rings</b> in bristlecone pines from Western North America and volcanic acid deposition in ice cores. The results demonstrate that in the 6 th and 7 th centuries of the current era, and presumably for all earlier dates, the key European ice chronologies from the North Greenland Ice Core Project, namely Dye 3, GRIP, NGRIP and NEEM appear to have been wrongly dated by 7 years, with the ice dates being too old. Similar offsets are observed for the Antarctic Law Dome and West Antarctic Ice Sheet Divide WDC 06 A ice-core chronologies that have been linked to the Greenland record. Importantly, the results clarify which <b>frost</b> <b>rings</b> in bristlecone pines are related to volcanic activity and which may be the result of other causes. In addition, it is possible to show that ice core researchers have used inappropriate linkages to tree effects to justify their chronology...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{this article}} the authors present a 300 -year tree-ring {{chronology}} of Pinus peuce from a treeline {{site in the}} Pirin Mts in Bulgaria. The possible climate that influences tree-ring growth is discussed, {{as well as the}} reasons for occurrence of <b>frost</b> and light <b>rings.</b> On the basis of our results, we have concluded that radial growth depends mostly on the temperature regime of the preceding vegetation period and the current summer. The reason for formation of <b>frost</b> <b>rings</b> is abnormally sharp cooling at the treeline zone, with temperatures dropping below the freezing point at the end of May or at the beginning of June. Light rings form in years with very low average summer temperatures or short vegetation period. Severe droughts during the growth period may also cause decreased radial growth and consequent narrow rings...|$|R
5|$|Another {{method that}} has been used to {{establish}} the date of eruption is tree-ring dating. Tree-ring data has shown that a large event interfering with normal tree growth in North America occurred during 1629–1628 (±65 years)BCE. Evidence of a climatic event around 1628BCE has been found in studies of growth depression of European oaks in Ireland and of Scotch pines in Sweden. Bristlecone pine <b>frost</b> <b>rings</b> also indicate a date of 1627BCE, supporting the late 1600sBCE dating. Procedural changes in how ice cores are interpreted would bring that data more in line with the dendrochronological numbers.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Tree-ring {{studies may}} help better {{understand}} climate variability and {{extreme climate event}} frequency and are especially useful in regions where detailed mete-orological records lack. We studied the effect of droughts and unusually cold periods on Pinus sylvestris tree-ring width and wood anatomy. Study sites were selected along an altitudinal gradient on Vitosha Mountain, Bulgaria. Drought conditions caused the formation of narrow tree rings or light rings if the drought occurred in July–August at the lower altitude sites. In years with droughts in June and {{the first half of}} July, followed by precipitation in the middle of July, intra-annual density fluctuations (IADFs) were formed. Trees in the zone with optimal growth con-ditions produced fewer light rings and narrow rings in years with either strongest droughts or unusually cold summers. At the timberline zone, low summer temperature triggered narrow tree rings and light <b>rings.</b> <b>Frost</b> <b>rings</b> were formed when there was a drop in temperatures below the freezing point {{in the second half of}} May or at the beginning of June. Our findings show that studies of tree-ring anat-omy may contribute to obtain further knowledge about extreme climatic events in the Balkan Peninsula and in other regions where meteorological data lack...|$|R
40|$|The {{impact of}} {{volcanic}} eruptions on forest ecosystems can be investigated using dendrochronological records. While long-range effects are usually mediated by decreased air temperatures, resulting in <b>frost</b> <b>rings</b> or reduced maximum latewood density, local effects include abrupt suppression of radial growth, occasionally followed by greater than normal growth rates. Annual rings in Mexican mountain pine (Pinus hartwegii Lindl.) on Nevado de Colima, {{at the western}} end of the Mexican Neovolcanic Belt, indicate extremely low growth in 1913 and 1914, following the January 1913 Plinian eruption of Volcán de Fuego, 7. 7 km to the south. That event, which is listed among the largest explosive eruptions since A. D. 1500, produced ashflow deposits up to 40 m thick and blanketed our study area on Nevado de Colima with a tephra fallout 15 – 30 cm deep. Radial growth reduction in 1913 – 14 was 30 % in 73 % of the sampled trees. We geostatistically investigated the ecological impact of the eruption by mapping the decrease in xylem increment and found no evidence of a spatial structure in growth reduction. Little information has been available to date on forest species as biological archives of past environments in the North American tropics, yet this historical case study suggests that treeline tropical sites hold valuable records of prehistoric phenomena, including volcanic eruptions...|$|R
40|$|Studies have {{attempted}} to 'isolate' the volcanic signal in noisy temperature data. This assumes {{that it is possible}} to isolate a distinct volcanic signal in a record that may have a combination of forcings (ENSO, solar variability, random fluctuations, volcanism) that all interact. The key to discovering the greatest effects of volcanoes on short-term climate may be to concentrate on temperatures in regions where the effects of aerosol clouds may be amplified by perturbed atmospheric circulation patterns. This is especially true in subpolar and midlatitude areas affected by changes in the position of the polar front. Such climatic perturbation can be detected in proxy evidence such as decrease in tree-ring widths and <b>frost</b> <b>rings,</b> changes in the treeline, weather anomalies, severity of sea-ice in polar and subpolar regions, and poor grain yields and crop failures. In low latitudes, sudden temperature drops were correlated with the passage overhead of the volcanic dust cloud (Stothers, 1984). For some eruptions, such as Tambora, 1815, these kinds of proxy and anectdotal information were summarized in great detail in a number of papers and books (e. g., Post, 1978; Stothers, 1984; Stommel and Stommel, 1986; C. R. Harrington, in press). These studies lead to the general conclusion that regional effects on climate, sometimes quite severe, may be the major impact of large historical volcanic aerosol clouds...|$|R

40|$|Common juniper (Juniperus communis L.) {{is by far}} {{the most}} {{widespread}} conifer in the world. However, despite its wide distribution, tree-ring research dealing with this species is still scarce. The main reason is likely related to the hardness in crossdating not just comparing different samples, but also within the same plant due to irregular stem shape with strip-bark growth form in the older individuals and to the high number of missing, wedging and false rings. Considering that a precipitation signal is generally missing in the Alpine high-elevation tree species, here we present a pilot study aimed to i) test the dendrochronological potential of common juniper growing above the treeline and ii) verify the precipitation sensitivity of the species. We collected more than 200 samples from three sites in the central and eastern Alps, all between 2100 and 2400 m altitude. As expected, crossdating was exceptionally challenging. However, thanks to the conspicuous number of <b>frost</b> <b>rings</b> acting as pointer years, we were able to successfully date an adequate number of samples to produce a reliable chronology longer than 200 years in all three study sites. Chronology statistics (EPS, rbar, PC 1, etc.) were significantly lower than the corresponding values for the high-elevation tree species (larch, stone pine, spruce), but were similar to other species of the same genus found in literature. Climate/growth relationships computed in the last century highlight a significant precipitation signal in winter months, with a high variability among sites that well corresponds to the low spatial dependence of this factor. Despite the difficulties encountered, the possibility of building fairly long chronologies and the likely presence of a significant precipitation signal seems a promising starting point to apply classical dendroclimatological approach on this creeping shrub...|$|R
2500|$|A {{volcanic}} eruption did occur in antiquity {{and could have}} caused some of the plagues if it occurred at the right time.

The enormous global impact of this eruption has been recorded in an ash layer deposit found in the Nile delta, tree <b>ring</b> <b>frost</b> scars in the bristlecone pines of the western United States, and a layer of ash in the Greenland ice caps, all dated to the same time and with the same chemical fingerprint as the ash from Thera.|$|R
40|$|In 2012 Plummer et al., in {{presenting}} the volcanic chronology of the Antarctic Law Dome ice core, chose to list connections to acid layers in other ice cores and also possible chronological coincidences between ice acid dates and the precise dates of frost damage, and/or reduced growth in North American bristlecone pines. We {{disagree with the}} chronological links indicated by Plummer et al. for the period before AD 700, and {{in this paper we}} show that a case can be made that better linkages between ice acid and tree ring effects occur for this period if the ice chronologies are systematically moved forward by around 7 years, consistent with a hypothesis published by Baillie in 2008. In the paper we seek to explore the proposition that <b>frost</b> damage <b>rings</b> in North American bristlecone pines are a very useful indicator of the dates of certain large explosive volcanic eruptions; the dating of major eruptions being critical for any clear understanding of volcanic forcing. This paper cannot prove that there is an error in the Greenland Ice Core Chronology 2005 (GICC 05), and in equivalent ice chronologies from the Antarctic, however, it does provide a coherent argument for an apparent ice dating offset. If the suggested offset were to prove correct it would be necessary to locate where the error occurs in the ice chronologies and in this regard the dating of the increasingly controversial Icelandic Eldgjá eruption in the AD 930 s, and the China/Korean Millennium eruption which occurs some 7 years after Eldgjá, may well be critical. In addition, if the offset were to be substantiated it would have implications for the alleged identification of tephra at 429. 3 m in the Greenland GRIP core, currently attributed to the Italian volcano Vesuvius and used as a critical zero error point in the GICC 05 chronology...|$|R
60|$|Wonderful {{to go out}} on {{a frozen}} road, to see the grass in shadow bluish with hoar-frost, to see the grass in the yellow winter-sunrise beams melting and going cold-twinkly. Wonderful the bluish, cold air, and things {{standing}} up in cold distance. After two southern winters, with roses blooming all the time, this bleakness and this touch of <b>frost</b> in the <b>ringing</b> morning goes to my soul like an intoxication. I am so glad, on this lonely naked road, I don't know what to do with myself. I walk down in the shallow grassy ditches under the loose stone walls, I walk on the little ridge of grass, the little bank on which the wall is built, I cross the road across the frozen cow-droppings: and it is all so familiar to my feet, my very feet in contact, that I am wild as if I had made a discovery. And I realize that I hate lime-stone, to live on lime-stone or marble or any of those limey rocks. I hate them. They are dead rocks, they have no life--thrills for the feet. Even sandstone is much better. But granite! Granite is my favorite. It is so live under the feet, it has a deep sparkle of its own. I like its roundnesses--and I hate the jaggy dryness of lime-stone, that burns in the sun, and withers.|$|R
60|$|I {{am quite}} ready {{to admit that the}} fact that you make a {{particular}} branch of trade more profitable, induces more people to engage in that branch of trade. That is what I call stimulating Colonial production through the agency of price. I am quite prepared to admit that a very small tax on staple articles would affect prices in a very small manner. Reference has been made to the imposition of a shilling duty on corn, and I think it was Mr. Moor[3] who said, yesterday, that when the shilling duty was imposed prices fell, and when it was taken off prices rose. That may be quite true. I do not know that it is true, but it may be. The imposition of such a small duty as a shilling on a commodity produced in such vast abundance as wheat, might quite easily be swamped or concealed by the operation of other more powerful factors. A week of unusual sunshine, or a night of late <b>frost,</b> or a <b>ring</b> in the freights, or violent speculation, might easily swamp and cover the operation of such a small duty; but it is the opinion of those whose economic views I share--I cannot put it higher than that--that whatever circumstances may apparently conceal the effect of the duty on prices, the effect is there all the same, and that any duty that is imposed upon a commodity becomes a factor in the price of that commodity. I should have thought that was an almost incontestable proposition.|$|R
60|$|I {{will not}} {{describe}} the subsequent manoeuvres, which would interest nobody: enough if I {{say that on}} the 16th of January, 1679, it had become of the highest moment for Friedrich Wilhelm to get from Carwe (Village near Elbing) {{on the shore of}} the FRISCHE HAF, where he was, through Konigsberg, to Gilge on the CURISCHE HAF, where the Swedes are,--in a minimum of time. Distance, as the crow flies, is about a hundred miles; road, which skirts the two HAFS [Pauli, v. 215-222; Stenzel, ii. 392-397.] (wide shallow WASHES, as we should name them), is of rough quality, and naturally circuitous. It is <b>ringing</b> <b>frost</b> to-day, and for days back:--Friedrich Wilhelm hastily gathers all the sledges, all the horses of the district; mounts some four thousand men in sledges; starts, with the speed of light, in that fashion. Scours along all day, and after the intervening bit of land, again along; awakening the ice-bound silences. Gloomy Frische Haf, wrapt in its Winter cloud-coverlids, with its wastes of tumbled sand, its poor frost-bound fishing-hamlets, pine-hillocks,--desolate-looking, stern as Greenland or more so, says Busching, who travelled there in winter-time, [Busching's Beitrage (Halle, 1789), vi. 160.]--hears unexpected human noises, and huge grinding and trampling; the four thousand, in long fleet of sledges, scouring across it, in that manner. All day they rush along,--out of the rimy hazes of morning into the olive-colored clouds of evening again,--with huge loud-grinding rumble;--and do arrive in time at Gilge. A notable streak of things, shooting across those frozen solitudes, in the New-Year, 1679;--little short of Karl Gustav's feat, which we heard of, in the other or Danish end of the Baltic, twenty years ago, when he took Islands without ships.|$|R

Epiphany, along with Bailey Parker, Adrienne and Belle Von Black lost to the team of C.J. Lane, Taryn Shay, Jessica Cheyanne and Odessa Firechild. On June 28 at OVW's Trial by Fire event, after winning her tag team match with Andrew Lacroix against Hog Wild and Taryn Shay, Epiphany attacked Adrienne, Bailey Parker, C.J. Lane and Jessica Cheyenne during a tag team match. She then challenged the other women to take her on during OVW television. During the weeks following, Epiphany took out each female during one on one matches or attacking them during matches for which she was not scheduled. On July 26 at OVW's Futureshock event, Epiphany once again attacked C.J. Lane, but Melody returned to save Lane. Epiphany then received a match for the OVW Women's Championship against Melody on the August 12 episode of OVW, defeating her and winning the championship for the first time. On September 22, at OVW's Capitol Punishment event, Epiphany successfully defended her championship against C.J. Lane. On September 27 at OVW's Fall Brawl, Epiphany teamed up with Taryn Shay in a losing effort to Lane and Bailey Parker, with Lane earning a championship match. On the September 30 episode of OVW, Epiphany defeated Lane to retain her championship. However, she lost the championship to The Blossom Twins on the October 12 episode of OVW, after the two twins switched, ending her reign at 56 days. After time off Epiphany, made her return to the women's division as a spectator for match 1 of what would be a best of 3 series between Taryn Shay and C.J. Lane for contendership for the OVW Women's Championship. Later it was reported by Josie that Epiphany attacked Shay in order to take her spot in a contendership match, which she would go on to lose via disqualification against Lane.|$|R
