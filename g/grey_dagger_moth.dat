5000|$|Barrens <b>dagger</b> <b>moth</b> {{habitat is}} often {{described}} as sandy, xeric, and open oak-dominated communities. Rare moths that occur in pitch pine-bear oak communities, including barrens <b>dagger</b> <b>moth,</b> were associated with early successional habitat patches in southeastern Massachusetts. Barrens <b>dagger</b> <b>moths</b> have not been documented in most potential habitat, despite being relatively easy to detect (see Sampling) [...] More detailed studies on barrens <b>dagger</b> <b>moth</b> habitat requirements are needed.|$|R

50|$|The vulpina <b>dagger</b> <b>moth</b> or miller <b>dagger</b> <b>moth</b> (Acronicta vulpina) is a moth of the Noctuidae family. It {{is found}} from New York and Newfoundland west to central British Columbia, south to Colorado.|$|R
5000|$|Threats to the {{persistence}} of barrens <b>dagger</b> <b>moths</b> include habitat loss, fire suppression, extensive fires, high levels of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) browsing, introduced species, insecticides, off-road vehicles, and light pollution. Introduced species that may negatively impact barrens <b>dagger</b> <b>moth</b> are gypsy moths (Lymantria dispar) and parasitoids such as compsilura (Compsilura concinnata). Spraying for mosquitoes (Culicidae) and gypsy moths could negatively impact barrens <b>dagger</b> <b>moth.</b> Since {{it is not as}} persistent as other insecticides, use of the insecticide Bacillus thuringiensis var. kurstaki in spring is recommended if severe defoliation by gypsy moths appears imminent. White-tailed deer damage {{may have contributed to the}} extirpation of the barrens <b>dagger</b> <b>moth</b> population at Pinery Park, Ontario [...]|$|R
5000|$|Landscape-scale {{characteristics}} {{may have}} greater influence on barren <b>dagger</b> <b>moth</b> habitat quality than patch- or plot-level characteristics. Patches of remnant habitat occupied by barrens <b>dagger</b> <b>moths</b> are typically larger than 2,000 acres (1,000 ha). In models based on surveys of rare moths in a pitch pine-bear oak community in southeastern Massachusetts, barrens <b>dagger</b> <b>moth</b> was {{positively associated with}} landscapes with {{a high percentage of}} open-canopy oak scrub [...] and negatively associated (P=0.03) with mixed hardwood-conifer forest without pitch pine at the 1,120-acre (450 ha) scale. At a smaller scale (17 acres (7 ha)), barrens <b>dagger</b> <b>moth</b> was negatively associated (P=0.02) with the dispersion and interspersion of cover types. Connectivity of habitat did not appear important in this study area, but connectivity was generally low.|$|R

5000|$|Bear oak, and {{possibly}} other oaks, are the host plants for barrens <b>dagger</b> <b>moth</b> larvae. According to a fact sheet {{published by the}} New York Natural Heritage Program, larvae feed on bur oak (Q. macrocarpa), post oak, chestnut oak (Q. prinus), and probably black oak, and adults likely eat honeydew from sucking insects and tree sap. According to the NatureServe review, larvae have been observed on post oak and dwarf chinkapin oak (Q. prinoides). Barrens <b>dagger</b> <b>moths</b> were successfully raised on black oak in captivity, but they rejected blackjack oak (Q. marilandica).
