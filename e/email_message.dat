50|$|Empirical studies {{demonstrated}} that all team members on a software development team used this tool effectively.

25|$|A false {{positive}} occurs when spam filtering or spam blocking techniques wrongly classify a legitimate <b>email</b> <b>message</b> as spam and, as a result, interferes with its delivery. While most anti-spam tactics can block or filter {{a high percentage}} of unwanted emails, doing so without creating significant false-positive results is a much more demanding task.|$|E
25|$|To {{help fill}} the gap from that loss, SafetyLit began in early 1995 as a simple <b>email</b> <b>message</b> sent to about 20 people who were {{affiliated}} with the CDC-funded state Disability Prevention Programs in Louisiana {{and a few other}} U.S. states. As more and more people learned about SafetyLit, the mailing list expanded. By the end of 1998 the updates were circulated to more than 5000 addresses. By the close of 1999 the address list had expanded beyond 15,000.|$|E
25|$|Notepad accepts {{text from}} the Windows {{clipboard}}. When clipboard data with multiple formats is pasted into Notepad, the program only accepts {{text in the}} CF_TEXT format. This is useful for stripping embedded font type and style codes from formatted text, such as when copying text from a web page and pasting into an <b>email</b> <b>message</b> or other WYSIWYG text editor. Formatted text can be temporarily pasted into Notepad, and then immediately copied again in stripped format to paste into the other program.|$|E

25|$|What {{is crucial}} in setting the level of {{formality}} in any legal document is assessing the needs and expectations of the audience. For example, an appellate brief to the highest court in a jurisdiction calls for a formal style—this shows proper respect for the court and for the legal matter at issue. An interoffice legal memorandum to a supervisor can probably be less formal—though not colloquial—because it is an in-house decision-making tool, not a court document. And an <b>email</b> <b>message</b> to a friend and client, updating {{the status of a}} legal matter, is appropriately informal.|$|E
25|$|Some {{time during}} the {{evolution}} of Fido, file attachments {{were added to the}} system, allowing a file to be referenced from an <b>email</b> <b>message.</b> During the normal exchange between two instances of FIDONET, any files attached to the messages in the packets were delivered after the packet itself had been up or downloaded. It is not clear when this was added, but it was already a feature of the basic system when the 8 February 1985 version of the FidoNet standards document was released, so this was added very early in Fido's history.|$|E
25|$|Bildt was {{an early}} pioneer among {{politicians}} of using the Internet for communicating. On 4 February 1994, he sent an <b>email</b> <b>message</b> to US president Bill Clinton, {{which was the first}} publicly known electronic message sent between two heads of government. In the message he praised Clinton's decision to end the trade embargo on Vietnam. In the same year, he also started a weekly electronic newsletter which was active until 2005. He is an active blogger, starting his first blog in February 2005. His current blog, started in January 2007, {{is one of the most}} widely read political blogs in Sweden.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} {{the results of an}} {{investigation}} into identifying the authorship of <b>email</b> <b>messages</b> by analysis of the contents and style of the <b>email</b> <b>messages</b> themselves. A set of stylistics features applicable to text in general and an extended set of email-specific structural features were identified. A Support Vector Machine learning method was used to discriminate between the authorship classes. Through a series of baseline experiments on non-email data, it was found that approximately 20 <b>email</b> <b>messages</b> with approximately 100 words in each message should be sufficient to discriminate authorship in most cases. These results were confirmed with a corpus of email data and performance was further enhanced when a set of email-specific features were added. This outcome has important implications in the management of such problems as email abuse, anonymous <b>email</b> <b>messages</b> and computer forensics...|$|R

500|$|A {{supporter}} of the Democratic Party, Ebert publicly urged liberal filmmaker Michael Moore to give a politically charged acceptance speech at the Academy Awards: [...] "I'd like to see Michael Moore {{get up there and}} let 'em have it with both barrels and really let loose and give them a real rabble-rousing speech." [...] During a 1996 panel at the University of Colorado at Boulder's Conference on World Affairs, Ebert coined the Boulder Pledge, by which he vowed never to purchase anything offered through the result of an unsolicited <b>email</b> <b>message,</b> or to forward chain emails or mass emails to others. Ebert endorsed Barack Obama for re-election as President in 2012.|$|E
500|$|The game {{is played}} {{over the course of}} a school semester; the first day of school is on April 1. In [...] "boy mode", each day concludes with a super {{deformed}} image of the heroine the player chose at the onset of the game slumped over her computer in her room; an <b>email</b> <b>message</b> from a girl that she interacted with during the day in on the monitor. As the heroine sleeps, the object of her affection appears in a thought bubble above her head. In [...] "girl mode", she is seen writing in her diary instead. The first day in the game requires no interaction from the player. The player gets through the first day by reading the text and getting acquainted with the girls. The game uses an angel and devil system where miniature angel and devil versions of each girl float beside her when critical decisions have to be made; this is not restricted to the three playable characters. It also features a [...] "Strawberry chance" [...] system, where the outcome of some scenes changes if the player presses one of the analog sticks fast enough after the message [...] is displayed in the upper right screen corner.|$|E

40|$|Problem statement: With {{the rapid}} growth of the number of <b>email</b> <b>messages</b> and the diverse use of email, people have become {{overwhelmed}} by the large volumes of email archives. As a result, email tools that facilitate the browsing of <b>email</b> <b>messages</b> are highly required. This study described an empirical study that aimed to investigate whether the usability of email client can be improved by incorporating graphical visualization techniques to browse email data. Approach: Two email visualization approaches, called LinearVis and MatrixVis, were developed for this empirical study which presented <b>email</b> <b>messages</b> based on a dateline together with other email information. The usability of each approach was compared to atypical email tool in terms of locating messages. Results: The results demonstrated that LinearVis was the most usable email approach in terms of browsing <b>email</b> <b>messages</b> whereas MatrixVis was found to be the least usable email condition. Conclusion: The results showed that usability of email clients can be significantly improved by presenting graphically <b>email</b> <b>messages</b> with only a small volume of hidden email data. Results also indicated that usability of the graphical representations, that hide large volume of email data, can be negatively affected...|$|R

2500|$|As stated above, the ETSI {{architecture}} is equally applicable to IP-based services where IRI (or CD) {{is dependent on}} parameters associated with the traffic from a given application to be intercepted. [...] For example, {{in the case of}} email IRI would be similar to the header information on an <b>email</b> <b>message</b> (e.g., destination email address, source email address, time email was transmitted) as well as pertinent header information within the IP packets conveying the message (e.g., source IP address of email server originating the <b>email</b> <b>message).</b> [...] Of course, more in-depth information would be obtained by the interception system so as to avoid the usual email address spoofing that often takes place (e.g., spoofing of source address). [...] Voice-over-IP likewise has its own IRI, including data derived from Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) messages that are used to set up and tear down a VOIP call.|$|E
