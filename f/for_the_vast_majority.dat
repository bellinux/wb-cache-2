5|$|DAB+ is a {{major upgrade}} to DAB, widely used in other {{countries}} in Europe. It was first tested in the United Kingdom in 2013 before regular services were launched in 2016. DAB+ is not backwards compatible with DAB so older radios cannot receive DAB+ stations. There are no plans {{in the foreseeable future}} <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>vast</b> <b>majority</b> of BBC and commercial stations to transition from DAB to DAB+. Estimates given by multiplex operator Switch Digital suggests that a third of radio sets in 2016 were DAB+ compatible.|$|E
5|$|Ann Bishop (19 December 1899– 7 May 1990) was a British {{biologist}} from Girton College at the University of Cambridge and a Fellow of the Royal Society, {{one of the}} few female Fellows of the Royal Society. She {{was born}} in Manchester but stayed at Cambridge <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>vast</b> <b>majority</b> of her professional life. Her specialties were protozoology and parasitology; early work with ciliate parasites, including the one responsible for blackhead disease in the domesticated turkey, lay the groundwork for her later research. While working towards her doctorate, Bishop studied parasitic amoebae and examined potential chemotherapies for the treatment of amoebic diseases including amoebic dysentery.|$|E
5|$|Insectivorous insects, or {{insects that}} feed on other insects, are {{beneficial}} to humans if they eat insects {{that could cause}} damage to agriculture and human structures. For example, aphids feed on crops and cause problems for farmers, but ladybugs feed on aphids, {{and can be used}} as a means to get significantly reduce pest aphid populations. While birds are perhaps more visible predators of insects, insects themselves account <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>vast</b> <b>majority</b> of insect consumption. Ants also help control animal populations by consuming small vertebrates. Without predators to keep them in check, insects can undergo almost unstoppable population explosions.|$|E

5|$|Andover's {{traditional}} {{strip of}} red and black stripes was worn <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>vast</b> <b>majority</b> of their history. This was changed to red and black quarters in 1950 and remained so until 1957 when the club reverted to the traditional stripes. When promotion to the Southern League was gained in 1972, the team's colours were changed, this time to red with a single white stripe. This kit was worn until 1988, when the familiar red and black stripes were re-introduced. For the 2008–09 season, a plain red kit was introduced to commemorate the club's 125th anniversary—this was worn {{for the first time}} in the pre-season friendly against Salisbury City. The last away kit worn by the team was yellow and black shirts with white shorts. However, various combinations have been worn in recent years, such as white shirts with blue sleeves and blue shorts, and tangerine shirts with white shorts.|$|E
5|$|Business tycoon Louis Benjamin was {{involved}} with Lew Grade as {{part of one of}} the four major record companies in the UK at the time. The company was Pye Records which, along with EMI, Philips, and Decca Records (UK), accounted <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>vast</b> <b>majority</b> of music records sold in the UK. In 1959, ATV acquired 50% of Pye Records. Between them, Grade and Benjamin held most of the shares. ATV Music Publishing was created to exploit the catalogue of songs written by artists on the Pye Record label, and for the themes to ITC and ATV television programmes. The UK rights to some of the rock 'n' roll music from the US were also bought by ATV. Grade established ATV's headquarters alongside those of Pye Records; off Edgware Road, beside the Marble Arch in central London.|$|E
5|$|The {{industry}} expanded {{rapidly in}} the 1940s because World WarII created a huge demand for inexpensive, mass-produced products. In 1946, American inventor James Watson Hendry built the first screw injection machine, which allowed much more precise control over the speed of injection {{and the quality of}} articles produced. This machine also allowed material to be mixed before injection, so that coloured or recycled plastic could be added to virgin material and mixed thoroughly before being injected. Today, screw injection machines account <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>vast</b> <b>majority</b> of all injection machines. In the 1970s, Hendry went on to develop the first gas-assisted injection moulding process, which permitted the production of complex, hollow articles that cooled quickly. This greatly improved design flexibility as well as the strength and finish of manufactured parts while reducing production time, cost, weight and waste.|$|E

25|$|The United States is {{the largest}} single {{supplier}} of military equipment to Israel. According to the U.S. Congressional Research Service, between 1998–2005 the U.S. accounted <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>vast</b> <b>majority</b> of Israel's arms transfer agreements, accounting for $9.1 billion out of $9.5 billion worth of agreements. Israel deals directly with U.S. companies <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>vast</b> <b>majority</b> of its military purchases from the United States, though it requires permission from the U.S. government for specific purchases. Permission is not always automatic; for instance, in March 2000 it became known that the Israeli government had been refused permission to purchase BGM-109 Tomahawk missiles.|$|E
25|$|According to the {{conclusion}} of the most detailed study of the event it seems that Machen's story provided the genesis <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>vast</b> <b>majority</b> of the tales. The stories themselves certainly boosted morale on the home front, as popular enthusiasm was dying down in 1915 and they demonstrate the importance of religion in wartime.|$|E

25|$|The two New World cotton species account <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>vast</b> <b>majority</b> {{of modern}} cotton production, {{but the two}} Old World species were widely used before the 1900s.

25|$|The apple {{industry}} {{is of particular}} importance to Washington. Because of the favorable climate of dry, warm summers and cold winters of central Washington, the state has led the U.S. in apple production since the 1920s.

After gaining the Gaumont Company's trust, Perret began directing his own screenplays starting around 1911.|$|E
