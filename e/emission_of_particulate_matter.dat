Residential and {{commercial}} burning of wood materials may be restricted during times of poor air quality, eliminating the immediate <b>emission</b> <b>of</b> <b>particulate</b> <b>matter</b> and requiring use of non-polluting heating methods.

Its manufacture was prohibited as part of a suite of restrictions adopted internationally in the Montreal Protocol to the Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer. Still another example is the ban on use of asbestos in building construction materials, to eliminate future exposure to carcinogenic asbestos fibers when the building materials are disturbed.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Since {{seed coating}} with {{neonicotinoid}} insecticides {{was introduced in}} the late 1990 s, European beekeepers have reported severe colony losses in the period of corn sowing (spring).

Trade openness has a benign effect on the environment in high-income countries, but a harmful effect in middle- and low-income countries. These results are generally robust to different measures of trade openness and environmental quality.

The blend ratio used in this study was 5 : 20 : 75 (ethanol: methyl soyate: diesel fuel) by volume. The results from the operation of diesel engine with BE-diesel showed a significant reduction in PM emissions and 2 %- 14 % increase of NOx emissions. The change of CO emission was not conclusive and depended on operating conditions. Total hydrocarbon (THC) from BE-diesel was lower than that from diesel fuel under most tested conditions. Formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, propionaldehyde and acetone in the exhaust were measured, and the results indicated that use of BE-diesel led to a slight increase of acetaldehyde, propionaldehyde and acetone emissions.

40|$|Abstract: Emissions {{into the}} {{atmosphere}} of Greenhouse Gases (GHGs) and particulate matter resulting from fossil fuel burning {{are considered to be}} the main anthropogenic forcing on the global climate. We show here that the external cyclic influences of cosmic origin that modulate the earth’s climate may either reinforce or mitigate the ‘local’ terrestrial forcings. Among the external influences is cosmic radiation, whose intensity shows a cyclic variation of 11 years, accompanying the 11 -year cycle of solar activity. We put forward a mechanism to explain how the <b>emission</b> <b>of</b> <b>particulate</b> <b>matter</b> {{into the atmosphere}} might influence global lightning activity. With respect to global lightning activity, we show why, during the 11 -year cycle, the influence of an increase in particulate matter concentration in the atmosphere may be negligible in some years, while it will be reinforced in other years, depending on the place of the years in the cycle. We also remark that the effect on global warming of fossil fuel burning is also modulated by the cosmic ray flux, whose influence is mediated by the variation that it promotes on the cloud cover...|$|E

The use of renewable fuels (biodiesel and butanol blend) and aftertreatment systems in diesel engines are the main requirements for reducing and controlling the pollutant emissions. To understand the effect of alternative fuels on PM characteristics and a diesel oxidation catalyst (DOC), rapeseed oil methyl ester (RME) biodiesel and an alcohol blend (butanol-diesel blend) were used for various engine operating conditions. The results revealed that the combustion of alternative fuels produces lower emissions of unburnt hydrocarbons (UHC), carbon monoxide (CO), and PM number concentration, which enhanced the catalyst activity at lower temperatures. Studying the effect of oxygenated fuel and fuel injection strategies on the combustion characteristics and PM characteristics, and hence the catalyst’s performance, can unveil synergies that can benefit vehicle emissions and fuel economy, as well as guide the design of the next generation of sustainable fuels. It was found that post-injection incorporation with a butanol blend produced lower PM concentration and modified the soot’s morphological parameters by reducing number of primary particles (npo), the radius of gyration (Rg), and the fractal dimension (Df) ...|$|E
