40|$|In {{order to}} {{decrease}} the influence on the recognition of for drivers' eye states when the lightness or view angle change suddenly, a new algorithm {{in this study is}} proposed to improve the recognition rate, which combines Kanade-Lucas (K-L) optical algorithm with Adaboost cascade classifier. This algorithm recognizes and saves the Harris corner using Adaboost algorithm. Those saved corner features would be tracked using K-L algorithm, if Adaboost algorithm did not recognize them again. The method improves the recognition rate and reduces the iterate computation of identification. Because, it is difficult to distinguish the eye with the eyebrow or the <b>eye-rim,</b> the second threshold segmentation algorithm is advanced {{to decrease the}} initial value of the global threshold and the second threshold is set to improve the recognition rate. Freeman chain code is used to search the contour of the recognized eye and three states of the drivers' eye are determined according to Elliptic equations. The experiments showed that the method can decrease the influence of the lightness and view angle and improve the recognition precision efficiently...|$|E

The nose, <b>eye-rims</b> and paw pads are the same colour as the darkest part of the coat or darker. The eyes are expressive and set fairly wide apart. They should be hazel, chestnut or dark brown in colour, depending on the coat colour. The ears are set at medium height on the skull, and are triangular.|$|R

The coat can also be glossy and short in most cases. [...] The only colour accepted by most kennel clubs is red; though the shades of red colour varies, and accepted shades range from a tan to a deep chestnut and all shades in between. White markings on the chest, toes, tail-tip, centre of forehead, and {{the bridge of the}} muzzle are accepted, but not required. Pharaoh's eyes are always amber, and should complement the coat colour. They are born with blue eyes, which change to a light gold or yellow colour during early puppyhood and then begin to darken well into adulthood. [...] The nose, whiskers, nails, paw-pads, and <b>eye-rims</b> should also be the same colour as the coat. Pharaohs also have a unique trait of [...] "blushing" [...] when excited or happy, with their ears and nose becoming bright pink.|$|R
