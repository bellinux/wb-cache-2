25|$|Ford New Zealand's Seaview {{plant in}} Lower Hutt built 1.1 and 1.3-litre versions, {{initially}} as Deluxe (1.1) and Super (1.3) two-door sedans plus panel vans. The four-door sedan was added in 1970. Trim levels were revised after the 1972 UK facelift {{with just one}} run of 1.3XLs (with the GT <b>instrument</b> <b>pack)</b> before these were downgraded to 'L' trim. Base and L trims were offered {{to the end of}} the Mk I run. Some 1.6 Mexicos were imported in 1973â€“74 after the government temporarily freed up import licensing owing to a shortage of new cars.

2500|$|As {{with the}} Australian-assembled models, New Zealand Rebels also reused the 1967 Rambler Ambassador dash and <b>instrument</b> <b>pack</b> for all model years.

Other parts were boxed and shipped inside the car for final assembly in New Zealand. The New Zealand models were more [...] "American" [...] than the Australian models as Australian laws required more local content for tariff concessions. For example, New Zealand models came with the U.S seats, door cards, headlining and sun visors, whereas the seats, door cards, headlining, and sun visors on Australian models were all locally supplied. Australian Law prohibited the use of rear red turn signals, whereas these were allowed in New Zealand.|$|E
2500|$|... 4-door {{sedan and}} station wagon Rebels from CKD (Completely Knocked Down) kits were {{assembled}} by Australian Motor Industries (AMI) in Port Melbourne, Victoria. Australian models {{were made with}} a RHD version of the 1967 Rambler Ambassador dash and two-dial <b>instrument</b> <b>pack</b> rather than the North American dash and rectangular speedo. The dash and cluster were reused for all subsequent models, including the Matador. The cars were built with right-hand drive and the body had the engine, transmission, front suspension, rear axle, and doors installed in Kenosha, Wisconsin. Other parts were boxed and shipped inside the car for final assembly in Australia. Australian models had to have aftermarket amber rear indicator lights fitted in the boot (trunk) lid to 1969 and amber lenses fitted behind the clear reverse lenses on 1970 models, as flashing red indicators were barred in Australia. Also in Australia, numerous other parts and components such as brakes, seats, carpet, lights, heaters, etc. were sourced locally to gain tariff concessions. As AMI also assembled Toyota vehicles, some parts used on the AMI Rebels were sourced from Toyota.|$|E

At this time, the Viva 2300 SL and Firenza Sport SL {{did away with}} the letter-box speedometer and substituted an attractive seven-dial <b>instrument</b> <b>pack.</b> Firenza SLs had a two round-dial pack, though all other Vivas and Firenzas stuck with the original presentation.|$|E

The <b>instrument</b> <b>pack</b> had enough battery power for sixty hours of operation and measured temperature, pressure, wind speed and aerosol density. The balloon envelopes were surfaced with polytetrafluoroethylene to resist attack by the corrosive atmosphere. Both Vega-1 and Vega-2 balloons operated for more than 46 hrs from injection to the final transmission.|$|E

40|$|Despite {{the use of}} ultraclean air, {{there are}} still casesof {{infection}} in total joint arthroplasty. One possible route by which bacteria may enter the wound is indirectly by contamination of instruments during skin preparation and draping. We found that bacterial air counts were 4. 4 times higher during preparation and draping for hip or knee arthroplasty using an unscrubbed, ungowned leg holder than during the operation itself. With the leg holder scrubbed and gowned during preparation and draping, the air counts were reduced but were still 2. 4 fold greater than intraoperatively. On some occasions, the air counts during preparation and draping exceeded the standards for ultraclean air irrespective of the attire of the leg holder. We recommend that the leg is held by a scrubbed and gowned member of the team.

5000|$|In New Zealand, the Viva was {{originally}} built in two- or four-door sedan and wagon/van form with 1,159 cc and 1256 cc engines. For {{a short time}} a special New Zealand only variant was produced, called Viva Score 7. This {{was originally}} intended {{to have a higher}} performance engine fitted, as a sports model, but the accountants stepped in and it became just a [...] "paint-job-and-trim" [...] special. It was available in three colour schemes of lime green, bright red/orange and bright yellow, with extensive black stripes and a prominent [...] "Score 7" [...] logo on the rear mudguards. A batch of 1.8-litre models, some with automatic transmission, was imported from the UK in 1973/4 when the government temporarily relaxed import restrictions on built-up cars as local CKD plants could not meet demand[...]The 1.8-litre engine and automatic transmission later were added to CKD assembly and the entire range was renamed Magnum in 1976. This had the four headlight nose and improved trim and equipment, such as a two-dial <b>instrument</b> <b>pack</b> and heated rear window, in a bid to overcome the Viva's basic car image - its original place in the GM range now taken by a newly launched, wide range of locally-made 1.3-litre Chevettes - and slowing sales.

The experimental setup and instrumentation for the dolphin studies are described in (25). The <b>instrument</b> <b>pack</b> was neutrally buoyant and weighed 8 kg in air. Twenty experimental dives from 50 to 110 m were conducted in open water. 19. Blue whale studies used CRITTERCAM instrumentation (36) attached with a low-profile silicon suction cup (22 cm diameter). The cup released after a predetermined interval through the dissolution of a corrosible magnesium plug. The blue whale (length ï¿½ 22 to 25 m) had been individually identified photographically during 1990 â€“ 98 along the California coast. It was considered an adult of at least 10 years in age. 20. Gliding was defined as periods exceeding 3 to 12 s in which no locomotor movements occurred and flippers or flukes were aligned along the body axis. Deployments involving forward-facing cameras on Weddell seals also used a tail-mounted ï¿½ 2 -g, single-axis accelerometer (Ultramarine Instruments, Galveston, TX) to assess stroking activity. Head movements of the blue whale were considered indicative of stroke activity because of counter movements {{of the head and}} tail in swimming cetaceans (25, 37).

40|$|The {{principal}} {{theories of}} human motor skill are compared. Disagreements between them centre around the exact {{details of the}} feedback loops used for control. In order to throw some light on this problem a commonplace skill was analysed using computer techniques to both record and model the movement. Bicycle riding was chosen as an example because it places strict constraints on {{the freedom of the}} rider's actions and consequently allows a fairly simple model to be used. Given these constraints a faithful record of the delicate balancing movements of the handlebar must also be a record of the rider's actions in controlling the machine. An <b>instrument</b> <b>pack,</b> fitted with gyroscopic sensors and a handlebar potentiometer, recorded the roll, yaw and steering angle changes during free riding in digital form on a microcomputer disc. A discrete step computer model of the rider and machine was used to compare the output characteristic of various control systems with that of the experimental subjects. Since the normal bicycle design gives a measure of automatic stability {{it is not possible to}} tell how much of the handlebar movement is due to the rider and how much to the machine. Consequently a bicycle was constructed in which the gyroscopic and castor stability were removed. In order to reduce the number of sensory contributions the subjects were blindfolded. The recordings showed that the basic method of control was a combination of a continuous delayed repeat of the roll angle rate in the handle-bar channel, with short intermittent ballistic acceleration inputs to control angle of lean and consequently direction. A review of the relevant literature leads to the conclusion that the proposed control system is consistent with current physiological knowledge. Finally the bicycle control system discovered in the experiments is related to the theories of motor skills discussed in the second chapter...|$|E
