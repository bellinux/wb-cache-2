30|$|The dNBR {{data have}} been operationally used for both rapid {{response}} and <b>initial</b> <b>assessments,</b> and for extended assessment and monitoring (Bobbe et al. 2003, Key and Benson 2002, Gmelin and Brewer 2002). For <b>initial</b> <b>assessments,</b> imagery acquired immediately after a fire {{is used to}} characterize first-order fire effects on vegetation and soils, and to facilitate the prioritization of rehabilitation resources. Extended assessments have relied on image data typically acquired {{during the growing season}} following the fire in order to capture delayed first-order effects (e.g., delayed tree mortality) and dominant second-order effects that are ecologically significant (e.g., initial site response and early secondary mortality agents). Extended assessments are intended to provide a more comprehensive ecological indication of fire severity than <b>initial</b> <b>assessments.</b> In both <b>initial</b> and extended <b>assessments,</b> there is a level of uncertainty in the characterization of fire severity. Pre-fire vegetation conditions and post-fire management activity influence the nature and magnitude of this uncertainty. The decision to use an <b>initial</b> or extended <b>assessment</b> should be based on specific management objectives.|$|R

5|$|In {{an attempt}} to resolve their {{persistent}} shortage of oil, the Wehrmacht had launched Fall Blau (Case Blue), a massive offensive aimed against the Caucasian oilfields, {{in the summer of}} 1942. After German air attacks, the 6th Army, led by Friedrich Paulus, was tasked with capturing Stalingrad, a key city on the River Volga. His troops, supported by 4th Panzer Army, entered the city on 12 September. Hand-to-hand combat and street fighting ensued. The Red Army launched a huge counteroffensive on 19 November, codenamed Operation Uranus, which was designed to encircle the German armies and trap them in the city; this goal was accomplished on 23 November. Hitler, aware that if Stalingrad were lost it would likely never be retaken, appointed Manstein as commander of the newly created Army Group Don (Heeresgruppe Don), tasked with mounting a relief operation named Unternehmen Wintergewitter (Operation Winter Storm), to reinforce the German hold on the city. Manstein's <b>initial</b> <b>assessment</b> on 24 November was that the 6th Army, given adequate air support, would be able to hold on.|$|E

25|$|In the Philippines, tuna {{driftnet}} fisheries have {{a substantial}} impact on the populations. One tuna fishery alone kills 400 Spinner Dolphin (Stenella longirostris) and Fraser's dolphins (Lagenodelphis hosei) each year. Round-haul nets are an even greater concern with a bycatch of up to 3000 dolphins per year. Dolphins that are bycaught often end up as shark bait for longline fisheries. There is not enough data to conclude total bycatch for the Philippines. <b>Initial</b> <b>assessment</b> indicates that bycatch is not sustainable. Monitoring of dolphin populations and fisheries is urgently needed.|$|E
