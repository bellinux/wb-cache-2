25|$|The {{skeletal}} remains of 28 people were unearthed at Masada. The {{remains of a}} male 20–22 years of age, a female 17–18, and a child about 12 years old {{were found in the}} palace. The remains of two men and a full <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>hair</b> with braids belonging to a woman were also found in the bath house. Forensic analysis showed the hair had been cut from the woman's head with a sharp instrument while she was still alive (an old practice for captured women) while the braids indicated that she was married. Based on the evidence, anthropologist Joe Zias believes the remains may have been Romans whom the rebels captured when they seized the garrison.|$|E
25|$|Ghigny {{was awarded}} the Military William Order 3rd Class on 8 July 1815. He was {{promoted}} to lieutenant general on 26 October 1826. During the Belgian Revolution he was in command at Ghent, which he declared {{in a state of}} siege. Soon after, he was placed on the inactive list and he received an honorable discharge from the Dutch Army on 31 December 1830. Ghigny entered Belgian service as a lieutenant general on 15 February 1831. He received the Belgian Order of Leopold on 9 July 1837 for meritorious service. He died on either 1 December or 30 November 1844. A sepia print from the 1800s shows Ghigny in a dark military coat with epaulettes and a single row of buttons on the front. He is thin in appearance with large eyes, a small mouth, a small toothbrush moustache and a full <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>hair.</b>|$|E
25|$|In chapter 96, a myth {{explaining}} Skíðblaðnirs {{creation is}} provided. The chapter details that the god Loki once {{cut off the}} goddess's Sif's hair {{in an act of}} mischief. Sif's husband, Thor, enraged, found Loki, caught hold of him, and threatened to break every last bone in his body. Loki promises to have the Svartálfar make Sif a new <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>hair</b> that will grow just as any other. Loki goes to the dwarfs known as Ivaldi's sons, and they made not only Sif a new head of gold hair but also Skíðblaðnir and the spear Gungnir. As the tale continues, Loki risks his neck for the creation of the devastating hammer Mjöllnir, the multiplying ring Draupnir, and the speedy, sky-and-water traveling, bright-bristled boar Gullinbursti. In the end, Loki's wit saves him his head, but results in the stitching together of his lips. The newly created items are doled out by the dwarfs to Sif, Thor, Odin, and Freyr. Freyr is gifted both Gullinbursti and Skíðblaðnir, the latter of which is again said to receive fair wind whenever its sail was set, and that it will go wherever it needs to, and that it can be folded up much as cloth and placed in one's pocket at will.|$|E

500|$|Designed to be [...] "harder and wilder" [...] {{than the}} {{original}} Mega Man, Zero's design ultimately resembled Mega Man X in several ways due to his initial character concept, Inafune's insistence on drawing the character, and input from other project artists. In the X series, Zero has red and white armor with twin [...] "horns" [...] on his helmet. Zero also has his signature long blonde hair. His main weapon is the Z-saber, an energy-based sword that introduced melee combat to the Mega Man games. His secondary weapon is the Z-buster, a cannon mounted {{at the end of}} his right arm, similar to Mega Man X's primary weapon. A tertiary weapon that would orbit around Zero was also considered, but left uncompleted. Unlike the original Mega Man, who had a full <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>hair</b> under his helmet, Zero has a smooth secondary helmet, intended to imply the characters were older. In Mega Man X4, Zero was going to receive his own enhanced armor in the same way X does, but the development team decided not to finish it.|$|E
500|$|The South Park creators and animators {{said they}} were still {{developing}} the characters {{and trying to figure}} out the future direction of the show with [...] "Weight Gain 4000", which was more slow-paced than the series would eventually become. The 30-page script was shorter than in later episodes, which would average between 45 to 50 pages. The child protagonists also spoke slower. While recording their voice performances, the actors read the lines slowly and the dialogue was then sped up to create the characters' distinctive voices. At that time, Parker and Stone had not mastered the pace at which they needed to speak. The crowd shots in [...] "Weight Gain 4000" [...] took a particularly long time to animate due to the large number of people featured, and the animators were especially proud of the use of depth and motion in the perspective of the crosshairs in Mr. Garrison's rifle scope as he tried to assassinate Kathie Lee Gifford. Mr. Garrison's hatred for Gifford was foreshadowed in [...] "Cartman Gets an Anal Probe", where the sentence [...] "I'm not positive, but I think Cathy [...] Lee Gifford is much older than she claims to be", can be seen on his classroom's chalkboard. During a flashback scene in [...] "Weight Gain 4000", an eight-year-old Mr. Garrison is shown to already be bald on top with gray hair on the side of his ears. This led to an inconsistency in the first season episode [...] "Cartman's Mom is a Dirty Slut", in which he has a full <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>hair</b> during a flashback.|$|E

500|$|Herbert [...] "Herb" [...] Powell (voiced by Danny DeVito), is Homer's {{paternal}} half-brother. He resembles Homer, {{though he}} is much thinner, boasts a full <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>hair</b> and is more astute. He {{first appeared in the}} season two episode [...] "Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?" [...] when Homer discovered he had a half-brother, the product of a short-lived affair between his father Abe and a carnival dunk-tank worker who was also a prostitute (identified in The Simpsons Uncensored Family Album as [...] "Gaby"). [...] A year after putting the baby up for adoption, Abe married Mona, who insisted he promise never to tell Homer about Herb or how he was conceived. [...] Herb was raised by his adoptive parents Edward and [...] Mililani Powell (first names given in The Simpsons Uncensored Family Album), put himself through college by working odd jobs, then founded Powell Motors, a car company based in Detroit. Herb is an exception to [...] "the Simpson Gene", which causes all male members of the Simpson family to gradually lose their intelligence as they mature, as Herb is intelligent, successful and an astute businessman, becoming extremely wealthy due to his car dealership. Overjoyed to learn that he had a blood family, Herb bonded with the children and hired Homer, as a representative of average Americans, to design a car. The car was a flop, bankrupting the company, and Herb angrily rejects Homer as a brother and became a street vagrant. The episode was written by Jeff Martin but the idea of having Herb voiced by Danny DeVito had been pitched by Sam Simon. Some were upset with the sad ending of the episode, and as a result the producers decided to make a sequel. Herb re-appeared the next season in [...] "Brother, Can You Spare Two Dimes?". Now broke and homeless, he briefly settled in the Simpson household, despite his intense continuing antipathy toward Homer. Homer loaned Herb $2000, which Herb used to build an invention that translated infantile speech into comprehensible English, based on observations he made of Maggie. He proceeded to mass-produce his new product and regained his fortune. In gratitude, he bought gifts for each member of the family and paid Homer back with his forgiveness. Homer's [...] "seldom seen half-brother" [...] has had only one brief speaking part since this episode: DeVito reprised his role for the Season 24 episode [...] "The Changing of the Guardian", in which Powell's answering machine message, [...] "Hi, you've reached Herb Powell. I'm poor again.", is heard.|$|E

2500|$|Caesar {{was born}} into a patrician family, the gens Julia, which claimed descent from Iulus, son of the legendary Trojan prince Aeneas, {{supposedly}} the son of the goddess Venus. The cognomen [...] "Caesar" [...] originated, according to Pliny the Elder, with an ancestor who was born by Caesarean section (from the Latin verb to cut, caedere, caes-). The Historia Augusta suggests three alternative explanations: that the first Caesar had a thick <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>hair</b> (Latin caesaries); that he had bright grey eyes (Latin oculis caesiis); or that he killed an elephant (caesai in Moorish) in battle. Caesar issued coins featuring images of elephants, suggesting that he favored this interpretation of his name.|$|E

2500|$|His co-stars on {{the show}} would {{frequently}} mock him for being Canadian and for his receding hairline, though this did not come until later as very {{early on in the}} UK version, Mochrie still had a fairly full <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>hair.</b> Instead, the bald jokes were done {{at the expense of the}} UK host, Clive Anderson. In the American version, he would often perform the female role in certain frequently-performed skits, such as [...] "Whose Line" [...] and [...] "Two Line Vocabulary". [...] In the few times he played the man in the scene, the producers were making further fun of his baldness (e.g. Colin was Samson, and Ryan was his girlfriend, and Samson had lost all his strength because Ryan had cut off his hair). While initially the co-anchor in the beginning, he would be cast as the anchor in the [...] "Weird Newscasters" [...] segment (the position had previously been played by Greg Proops and Brad Sherwood), wherein he would frequently begin by announcing himself with a fictitiously humorous name (e.g. Jose Canyousee) and continue with a fake news report that ended in an unexpected and pun-laden segue.|$|E
2500|$|Sombra, {{one of the}} {{beautiful}} but naïve Arcadians, is troubled by reports of a place beyond the sea where [...] "monsters" [...] live in cages of brick and stone and never tell the truth – a place called London. The Arcadians beg Father Time to bring them a Londoner. He reluctantly agrees and causes the amateur aviator James Smith, an ageing London restaurateur with passions for aeroplanes and philandering, to crash land in Arcadia, where no one tells lies or grows older, where money is unknown, and employment is unnecessary. The Arcadians and Smith exchange stories, and Smith introduces the Arcadians to some new concepts: ugliness, jealousy and lying. He attempts to seduce Sombra by telling a lie. Far from impressed, the Arcadians immerse him in the Well of Truth, from which he emerges transformed into a young man, wearing the scanty costume of Arcadia, with a luxuriant <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>hair</b> but minus his mutton-chop whiskers. They christen him [...] "Simplicitas", and he will remain young until he tells a lie.

2500|$|Puyi {{could not}} speak Manchu; he only knew a single word in the language, yili ("arise"). Despite {{studying}} Manchu for years, he admitted {{that it was his}} [...] "worst" [...] subject among everything he studied. According to the journalist S. M. Ali, Puyi spoke Mandarin when interviewed but Ali believed that he could understand English. Johnston also introduced Puyi to the new technology of cinema, and Puyi was so delighted with the movies, especially Harold Lloyd films, that he had a film projector installed in the Forbidden City, despite the opposition of the eunuchs who disliked foreign technology operating in the Forbidden City. Johnston was also the first to argue that Puyi needed glasses, as he was extremely near-sighted, and after much argument with Prince Chun, who thought it was undignified for an Emperor to wear glasses, finally prevailed. Johnston, who spoke fluent Mandarin, closely followed the intellectual scene in China, and introduced Puyi to the [...] "new style" [...] Chinese books and magazines, which so inspired Puyi, that he wrote several poems that were published anonymously in [...] "New China" [...] publications. In 1922, Johnston had his friend, the writer Hu Shih, visit the Forbidden City to teach Puyi about recent developments in Chinese literature. Under Johnston's influence, Puyi embraced the bicycle as a way to exercise, cut his queue and grew a full <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>hair,</b> and wanted to go to study at Oxford, which was Johnston's alma mater. Johnston also introduced Puyi to the telephone, which Puyi soon become addicted to, phoning people in Beijing at random just to hear their voices on the other end. Johnston also pressured Puyi {{to cut down on the}} waste and extravagance in the Forbidden City, noting that all of these eunuch slaves had to be fed. Johnston convinced Puyi that he could open doors for himself and did not need eunuchs standing by idly all the time by the main doors of the palaces just to open the door for him if he should happen to come along. Puyi cut off his queue so he would look like a Western gentleman and under Johnston's advice embraced the bicycle as the best way to move about in the Forbidden City, retaining a lifelong enthusiasm for cycling, though it is doubtful that the eunuchs working as gardeners much appreciated Puyi's habit of riding through the flowers.|$|E
