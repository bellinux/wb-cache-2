40|$|International audienceIn this paper, {{we present}} a method for symbol {{recognition}} based on the spatio-structural description of a 'vocabulary' of extracted visual elementary parts. It is applied to symbols in <b>electrical</b> <b>wiring</b> <b>diagrams.</b> The method consists of first identifying vocabulary elements into different groups based on their types (e. g., circle, corner). We then compute spatial relations between the possible pairs of labelled vocabulary types which are further used {{as a basis for}} building an Attributed Relational Graph that fully describes the symbol. These spatial relations integrate both topology and directional information. The experiments reported in this paper show that this approach, used for recognition, significantly outperforms both structural and signal-based state-of-the-art methods...|$|R
50|$|The {{first edition}} of Die-Cut Plug <b>Wiring</b> <b>Diagram</b> Book is a small softback book {{containing}} 36 photocopied plug <b>wiring</b> <b>diagrams,</b> mostly in colour using different coloured toners in monochrome photocopiers; 3 full colour photocopies have been tipped in as well. The 'de-luxe version' {{of the book is}} sewn together using different coloured threads that mimic <b>electrical</b> <b>wiring,</b> whilst the ordinary edition is stapled. The 'de-luxe' version sold for £3.00, twice the asking price of the stapled version. The cover is a grainy photocopy of the back of a plug diagram with three holes cut into it (where the pins would go). There is a brief essay at the end by Pawson discussing his collection of plugs, and their essential Britishness. The last page lists credits of 'contributing electricians'.|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{develops}} a structural symbol recognition method with integrated statistical features. It applies spatial organization descriptors to the identified shape features within a fixed visual vocabulary that compose a symbol. It builds an attributed relational graph expressing the spatial relations between those visual vocabulary elements. In order {{to adapt the}} chosen vocabulary features to multiple and possible specialized contexts, we study the pertinence of unsupervised clustering to capture significant shape variations within a vocabulary class and thus refine the discriminative power of the method. This unsupervised clustering relies on cross-validation between several different cluster indices. The resulting approach is capable of determining part of the pertinent vocabulary and significantly increases recognition results {{with respect to the}} state-of-the-art. It is experimentally validated on complex <b>electrical</b> <b>wiring</b> <b>diagram</b> symbols...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — It is the {{fundamental}} requirement for power system graphical editor {{to be able to}} draw rapidly, precisely and allocate corresponding configuration parameters for the power components and reserve operation interface. Element of this editor uses the SVG format and defines metadata tags based on the CIM specification carrying metadata in the SVG document which makes the graphics and data can be linked to a unified canonical form. The editor achieves the purpose as follows: editing, storing, and exporting a wiring diagram; importing a wiring diagram from other systems; automatically extracting and storing layers and elements in the importing process; creating and maintaining the user-defined primitive library or layer library and binding associated data. This SVG graphics editor for power system has met the functional requirements of the user and has been applied in several practical projects.

40|$|This {{monograph}} is {{a comprehensive}} study of the combinatorial structure of various operads of <b>wiring</b> <b>diagrams</b> and undirected <b>wiring</b> <b>diagrams.</b> Our first main objective is to prove a finite presentation theorem for each operad of <b>wiring</b> <b>diagrams,</b> describing each one in terms {{of just a few}} operadic generators and a small number of generating relations. For example, the operad of <b>wiring</b> <b>diagrams</b> has 8 generators and 28 generating relations, while the operad of undirected <b>wiring</b> <b>diagrams</b> has 6 generators and 17 generating relations. Our second main objective is to prove a corresponding finite presentation theorem for algebras over each operad of <b>wiring</b> <b>diagrams.</b> As applications we provide finite presentations for the propagator algebra, the algebra of discrete systems, the algebra of open dynamical systems, and the (typed) relational algebra. We also provide a partial verification of Spivak's conjecture regarding the quotient-freeness of the relational algebra. Our third main objective is to construct explicit operad maps among the several operads of <b>wiring</b> <b>diagrams.</b> In particular, there is a surjective operad map from the operad of all <b>wiring</b> <b>diagrams,</b> including delay nodes, to the operad of undirected <b>wiring</b> <b>diagrams.</b> This monograph is intended for graduate students, mathematicians, scientists, and engineers interested in operads and <b>wiring</b> <b>diagrams.</b> Assuming no prior knowledge of categories, operads, and <b>wiring</b> <b>diagrams,</b> this monograph is self-contained and {{can be used as a}} supplement in a graduate course and for independent study. There are over 100 graphical illustrations and a chapter with a list of problems. Comment: 302 pages. Substantially revised.

40|$|AbstractFor drawing <b>electrical</b> <b>wiring</b> <b>diagram</b> of buildings, mostly two {{dimensional}} CAD programs are used. Drawing is done {{starting from the}} source (utility pole) to main power panel and then it is distributed towards to subpanels. Then, end points such as sockets, lighting armature, etc are defined. In this study several algorithms are developed in order to evaluate different part of drawing project. Tree structure of drawing is analyzed and all materials to be used are decided based on an algorithm. Apart from these, some of the supplies {{to be used in}} project but not shown in the drawings are also be chosen with certain criteria. These decision systems will result in efficiency of overall cost of the project. In wire drawing {{one of the most important}} point is the line drawing with reference to an object. Apart from light outlet all wires are referenced to walls. Furthermore, all supplies shown in drawings are allocated with reference to walls and with an angle to walls. In wiring diagram drawings, standard CAD programs have no ability for wire drawing with reference to walls. Besides that, suggestion and selection of the most appropriate supplies is not possible. These increase drawing time and result in very high cost calculation errors. These algorithms provide fast and correct implementation. By analyzing drawings in a tree structure on which users have minimal impact, and with automatic selection of supplies all type of calculation mistakes are minimized...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the integration of}} MATLAB and LabVIEW {{for the implementation of}} testing system for control panel of medium voltage switchgear. This system tests two types of sockets of control panel i. e. nonstandard socket and standard socket. The standard socket is the one who has universal <b>wiring</b> <b>diagram</b> (64 pins socket) and nonstandard socket (generally 8, 16, 24 or even 32 pins socket) is the one who‟s <b>wiring</b> <b>diagram</b> changes from panel to panel. For testing of nonstandard type of socket system needs its <b>wiring</b> <b>diagram,</b> which is to be decoded by Image processing algorithm implemented in MATLAB. The LabVIEW is central controlling element and it is also used to test nonstandard socket along with DAQ hardware. The system checks „Normally closed ‟ and „Normally open ‟ status of pin pairs of control panel mentioned in the <b>wiring</b> <b>diagram</b> in case of non standard socket while in case of standard socket there is no such need of scanning the <b>wiring</b> <b>diagram</b> as it has universal <b>wiring</b> <b>diagram,</b> so those pin pairs are already mentioned in LabVIEW those need to be checked.
