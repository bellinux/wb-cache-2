500|$|When Tom is {{introduced}} in the first season finale, he wears a fake beard and old clothes. He continues to appear under this guise throughout the second season, only revealing his beard to be fake in the finale. M. C. Gainey, the actor who portrays Tom, was only informed that his character's beard was fake {{near the end of}} season two. The producers describe Tom as [...] "friendly", earning him the nickname [...] "Mr. Friendly". One critic has described him as [...] "sarcastic" [...] and [...] "bright". Tom's dislike of blood causes him to struggle while supervising Ben's operation, which Emerson believes makes him [...] "cuddly". Gainey does not think he is very similar to Tom, commenting, [...] "He seems to be very loyal and I'm a very loyal person so I <b>have</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> common, but other than that, I don't really know what he's about. He seems much more socially awkward than I am." [...] After Tom was revealed to be gay during season four, M. C. Gainey stated that [...] "anytime you've got a group of people, somebody's got to be marching to a different drummer- that would be Tom Friendly." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2006, Beyoncé Knowles told a {{reporter}} from The Independent [...] "how inspired she's been by the whole drag-house circuit in the States, an unsung part of black American culture where working-class gay men channel ultra-glamour in mocked-up catwalk shows. 'I still <b>have</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> me', {{she says of the}} 'confidence and the fire you see on stage... '" ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{regards to}} the album as a whole, Amos surmised, [...] "I {{would say that it}} embraces the rebirth of light, but light means knowledge, light means consciousness. Everybody can attain that and <b>have</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> their life. Consider the idea that it’s inner God. It’s in every child that’s born; every child carries this ability within them. And I like that sentiment." ...|$|E

2500|$|After {{several years}} in Laredo, Tatangelo became active in local politics. He {{considered}} himself a Democrat, but, as an independent businessman, he was more pragmatic than partisan. [...] "I had a summer house in Zapata (also Zapata County) and learned {{that they had a}} fire station manned by volunteers. I thought we could <b>have</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> Laredo," [...] he told The Laredo Morning Times. He recruited thirty-nine volunteers, and in 1973, a fire station was built on Del Mar Boulevard across from St. Patrick's Catholic Church.|$|E
2500|$|In November 2007, a {{separate}} American remake was announced. Rather than Craggy Island, this version {{would be set}} in an unfortunate fishing village in New England. American actor John Michael Higgins was cast as Ted, but expressed concerns about the show's religious themes: [...] "The English have a very robust history of being unkind about religion. We don't <b>have</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> our country, we're frightened of it. It's basically that you guys are doing an Irish joke also, we don't have that. So I'll be Father Ted, we'll see how it goes." [...] Filming was scheduled to begin in January 2008.|$|E
2500|$|In 1991, in {{a debate}} in the {{regional}} parliament, a Socialist leader attacked Haider's plan of reducing unemployment payments for people seen as [...] "freeloaders", calling it forced work placement reminiscent of Nazi policies. Haider replied, [...] "No, they didn't <b>have</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> the Third Reich, because in the Third Reich they had a proper employment policy, which not even your government in Vienna can manage to bring about." [...] Haider claimed that the legislators understood his comment as a criticism of the present Austrian government, but {{in the days that}} followed the SPÖ joined with the ÖVP in a vote of no confidence against him.|$|E

2500|$|Columbia University's president, Lee Bollinger, {{introduced}} Ahmadinejad with a combative tone: [...] "Mr. President you exhibit all {{the signs}} of a petty and cruel dictator." [...] Ahmadinejad responded by opening his speech saying that his introduction was [...] "an insult to information {{and knowledge of the}} audience there." [...] Some of his arguments were met with derisive laughter, for example [...] "... in Iran we don't have homosexuals, like in your country. [...] We don't <b>have</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> our country. [...] In Iran we do not have this phenomenon. I don't know who told you that we have it." [...] An aide later claimed that he was misrepresented and was saying that [...] "compared to American society, we don't have many homosexuals".|$|E
2500|$|The Morning Call's John L. Moser {{wrote that}} [...] "trends come and trends go," [...] but that Yanni's music [...] "seems to defy trends and... feels like it’s music for all time." [...] Moser interviewed the composer, {{asking if he}} {{intentionally}} tries to create [...] "something that’s going to last forever as opposed to something that’s just going to sell 1 million copies right away," [...] Yanni replied that [...] "There’s {{no way you can}} create art to last forever... so you can’t <b>have</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> your mind." [...] Instead, describing his creative process, Yanni explained that his knowledge of music and instruments and his experience in different cultures is a [...] "primordial soup that comes together and it shows itself and it appears.

2500|$|When Lopez {{released}} her eighth studio album, A.K.A., she enlisted Australian rapper Iggy Azalea as a last-minute addition. Azalea {{contributed to the}} track [...] "Acting Like That" [...] and claimed she was honoured {{to be part of}} the remix, because she [...] "used to sit in [...] bedroom as a young girl and lip-sync Jennifer Lopez songs, so it's very cool to have a song with her on her album." [...] They also performed [...] "Acting Like That" [...] for the first time during a concert at B96′s Summer Bash in Chicago and eventually became friends, with Lopez also appearing on Azalea's MTV fashion show [...] "House of Style". During their interview, Lopez revealed that [...] "Booty" [...] would be her next single and confirmed Azalea as the featuring guest. Lopez told that Azalea [...] "did something on it and obviously because [...] <b>have</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> common," [...] she says referencing their buttocks. Azalea completed that they [...] "have high fashion booty." ...|$|E

2500|$|Other {{scores are}} average, mixed or negative: The Scotsman {{gave it a}} score of three stars out of five and said that it [...] "employs stillness as a set-up for all manner of disruption: sharply pealing riffs, phantasmagorical metaphors, {{convoluted}} song structures. In many ways it's a typical effort from the guitarist Omar Rodriguez-Lopez and the vocalist Cedric Bixler-Zavala, {{who make up the}} Mars Volta's core. But that's not to discredit the more measured side of Octahedron. Presented as an eight-song suite, the album delivers a panoramic range of intensity, sliding along that range in ways both gradual and startling." [...] BBC Music gave it an average review and said that the album [...] "shows the band maintaining a frighteningly productive work rate... while continuing to mature. [...] Its vaulting ambition demands over-inflated self-confidence. And MV <b>have</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> spades." [...] Uncut also gave it a score of three stars out of five and said, [...] "As ever with The Mars Volta, there are enough flashes of brilliance {{to make up for the}} wearying material elsewhere." [...] Q likewise gave the album three stars out of five and said it [...] "bucks the band's trend for obfuscation, though; conventional song structures are very much in evidence, while its relatively trim 49-minute running time is on par with some of Mars Volta's more involved live jams." [...] Alternative Press likewise gave it three stars and said the album [...] "will appeal to elderly prog fans immune to attention deficit disorder, who have the patience to let its charm gradually unfold." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{game was}} first hinted at during E3 2009 by EA’s CEO, John Riccitiello. Riccitiello stated that Criterion Games, {{developers}} of EA's own Burnout series, {{was working on}} a [...] "revolutionary" [...] addition to the Need for Speed franchise, stating: [...] "We don't have a plan right now for a separate major launch on Burnout, because the team doing it is working on a revolutionary take on Need for Speed." [...] The title was confirmed to be in development by EA's chief operating officer, John Pleasants, at a Stock meeting in June 2009, where he stated: [...] "We've taken the Burnout team and combined it with our Need for Speed franchise. So we now <b>have</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> our favor because that Burnout team {{is probably one of the}} more online-centric and notably high-quality game developers that we have out at Criterion." [...] Shift producer, Jesse Abney, expressed his delight to work with Criterion Games, stating that it would be a [...] "great team to work with on that stuff," [...] referencing the development of Need for Speed. [...] It was reported that the game was scheduled for release in Q4 2010. EA's COO, John Schappert, said that the Q4 NFS title was, [...] "a new action based Need for Speed from our Criterion Studio," [...] in a post-financial report conference call. The title was officially revealed as Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit at EA's Media Briefing during E3 2010, with a trailer which showed a high-speed police chase involving three different racers. The trailer was followed by a live demo of the game on stage between creative director Craig Sullivan as a cop and producer Matt Webster as a racer. According to Riccitiello, the game was in development for two years.|$|E
