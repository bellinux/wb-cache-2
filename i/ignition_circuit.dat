50|$|Mercury-Scout 1 was readied {{for launch}} on October 31 from LC-18B. The {{prelaunch}} countdown proceeded normally, but the engine failed to ignite. Pad crews checked out and repaired the <b>ignition</b> <b>circuits</b> {{and the flight}} was reattempted the next day. Control started failing only seconds after liftoff and at T+28 seconds, the first stage started to disintegrate. Range Safety issued the destruct command at T+43 seconds. The failure was traced to a technician who had accidentally installed the wiring for the guidance system backwards, causing pitch signals to be transmitted to roll and vice versa.|$|R
50|$|Thermal noise {{can be made}} lower by cooling the circuits, {{but this}} is only usually {{worthwhile}} on radio telescopes. In other applications the limiting noise source depends on the frequency range in use. At low frequencies (longwave or mediumwave) and at high frequencies (shortwave), interference caused by lightning or by nearby electrical impulses in electrical switches, motors, vehicle <b>ignition</b> <b>circuits,</b> computers, and other man-made sources tends to swamp transmissions with thermal noise. These noises are {{often referred to as}} static. Atmospheric noise is radio noise caused by natural atmospheric processes, primarily lightning discharges in thunderstorms. At very high frequency and ultra high frequency these sources can still be important, but at a much lower level, such that thermal noise is usually the limiting factor. Cosmic background noise is experienced at frequencies above about 15 MHz when highly directional antennas are pointed toward the sun or to certain other regions of the sky such as the center of the Milky Way Galaxy.|$|R
40|$|Generating {{high voltage}} {{by means of}} flyback {{topology}} is a common approach. Using the generated voltage to charge a capacitor for a high energy pulse are used in defibrillators, photo-flashs, strobes and <b>ignition</b> <b>circuits</b> to name a few. The procedure outlined {{in this article is}} useful in the initial transformer design phase for charging a capacitor in a stated time. The procedure presented eliminates “cut and try ” or over-design approaches. Selection of critical values can be made with confidence using the guidance provided. First a little background in flyback topology. Flyback topology has several advantages- 1) Simple circuit. 2) High voltage output is not dependent on large turns ratios. 3) Circuit is self limiting. Output can be shorted without damage. 4) Output can be regulated over a large range. 5) Transformer can provide voltage isolation. 6) Multiple isolated outputs are possible. One output can be used for a low ratio feedback voltage. 7) Smoothing choke not required. Some disadvantages- 1) Requires a transformer. 2) Fast switching can generate EMI problems. 3) Leakage inductance must be kept low for good efficiency. 4) Without a feedback loop, circuit may be damaged if the load is removed...|$|R

50|$|A {{distributor}} is {{an enclosed}} rotating shaft used in spark-ignition internal combustion engines that have mechanically-timed ignition. The distributor's main {{function is to}} route secondary, or high voltage, current from the ignition coil to the spark plugs in the correct firing order, and for the correct amount of time.

It has two large circular headlights iconic of Yamaha FZR's large and small displacement. The fuel tank has a triangular side profile that matches the frame well, with a flat top and a fuel petcock at the bottom left with an overflow hose fitting {{at the bottom of}} the front.

40|$|The new, 125 °C, solid polymer {{aluminum}} (SPA) capacitors have performance {{advantages over}} {{other types of}} low ESR capacitors when used as output filters in DC-DC modules. The principal advantage of an SPA capacitor is that its ultra low ESR permits filtering in a DC-DC converter with fewer capacitors. This reduces the cost {{and size of the}} converter. Other advantages are <b>ignition</b> free, open <b>circuit</b> failure mode, better filtering from lower ESR, higher peak current capability and more rapid energy transfer. The new type is available as Cornell Dubilier Type ESRH. While SPA capacitors are inherently reliable, they do have a wear out mechanism. Entrapped moisture causes a steady increase in ESR.

The ECU must provide effective fuel injection and spark ignition control and provide for easy adjustment by the user for engine tuning purposes. The controller was designed to operate using a speed-throttle fuel map, with acceleration enrich, meet and other fuel compensating factors. A paired double-tiring strategy was adapted to avoid the complications associated with sequential fuel injection. The ECU utilized a Motorola 68 HC 16 development board, as well as special injector and <b>ignition</b> driver <b>circuits.</b> The software was designed to be primarily interrupt driven, with a task manager to arbitrate among other tasks. A user interface program, which runs on a PC, allows the user to instantly alter operating parameters in the ECU during engine tuning and development.

A reference pointer is attached to the flywheel housing or other fixed point, and an engraved scale gives the offset between the spark time and the top dead centre position of the piston in the cylinder. The distributor can be rotated slightly until the reference pointer aligns with the specified point on the timing scale.|$|E
