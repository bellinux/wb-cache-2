2500|$|In an {{interview}} in The Guardian in 2000, Sontag was quite open about being bisexual: [...] "'Shall <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> getting older?', she says, and she is laughing. 'When you get older, 45 plus, men stop fancying you. Or put it another way, the men I fancy don't fancy me. I want a young man. I love beauty. So what's new?' She says {{she has been in}} love seven times in her life. 'No, hang on,' she says. 'Actually, it's nine. Five women, four men.'" [...] Many of Sontag's obituaries failed to mention her significant same-sex relationships, most notably that with Annie Leibovitz. In response to this criticism, New York Times Public Editor, Daniel Okrent, defended the newspaper's obituary, stating {{that at the time of}} Sontag's death, a reporter could make no independent verification of her romantic relationship with Leibovitz (despite attempts to do so). After Sontag's death, Newsweek published an article about Annie Leibovitz that made clear references to her decade-plus relationship with Sontag.|$|E
