40|$|The <b>tarnished</b> <b>plant</b> <b>bug,</b> known principally as an {{agricultural}} pest, injures young hybrid Populus by feeding on the stems and meristems. <b>Tarnished</b> <b>plant</b> <b>bug</b> eggs, fungi associated with some lesions, and simple mechanical stimuli alone from feeding appeared not to cause lesion formation. Of 20 Populus hybrids {{tested in a}} clonal trial, four appeared to be consistently susceptible to lesion injury, with Populus nigra var. betulifolia x trichocarpa the most susceptible.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The western <b>tarnished</b> <b>plant</b> <b>bug</b> Lygus hesperus is an {{economically}} important pest {{that belongs to}} a complex of morphologically similar species that makes identification problematic. The present study provides evidence {{for the use of}} DNA barcodes from populations of L. hesperus from the western United States of America for accurate identification. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: This study reports DNA barcodes for 134 individuals of the western <b>tarnished</b> <b>plant</b> <b>bug</b> from alfalfa and strawberry agricultural fields in the western United States of America. Sequence divergence estimates of < 3 % reveal that morphologically variable individuals presumed to be L. hesperus were accurately identified. Paired estimates of F(st) and subsequent estimates of gene flow show that geographically distinct populations of L. hesperus are genetically similar. Therefore, our results support and reinforce the relatively recent (< 100 years) migration of the western <b>tarnished</b> <b>plant</b> <b>bug</b> into agricultural habitats across the western United States. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This study reveals that despite wide host plant usage and phenotypically plastic morphological traits, the commonly recognized western <b>tarnished</b> <b>plant</b> <b>bug</b> belongs to a single species, Lygus hesperus. In addition, no significant genetic structure was found for the geographically diverse populations of western <b>tarnished</b> <b>plant</b> <b>bug</b> used in this study...|$|R

40|$|Introduction The {{project is}} based on {{research}} on pheromones and the project SoftPest Multitrap. Copenhagen Universitys Science and Life Sciences, more specifically Department of Plant and Environmental Sciences, has researched and developed the pheromonis for mass trapping of the Strawberry Blossom Weevil (Anthonomus Rubi) and the European <b>Tarnished</b> <b>Plant</b> <b>Bug</b> (Lygus Rugulipennis). Our foucus is on the user-experience Associated with the pheromonibased traps. Especially the distrubution, assembly, setup, Collection, cleaning, storage and The Problem The Strawberry Blossom Weevil and European <b>Tarnished</b> <b>Plant</b> <b>Bug</b> are a major problem to European strawberry producers and reduces the annual yield remarkably. The conventional strawberry producers can efficiently spray with pesticides to control the pest, however, this is harmful to the environment. The ecological strawberry producers lack effective pest control methods and has no options if they are attacked by the mentioned pest. A preromone-based pest control method is a promising alternative and it is useful for both conventional and ecological strawberry producers. However, a userdriven redesign of SoftPest Multitrap (figure 1) is nescessary. This {{is to ensure that}} the traps can be easily implemented in the various production methods and be a competitive alternative to pesticides...|$|R
40|$|The {{biology of}} the <b>tarnished</b> <b>plant</b> <b>bug</b> {{is known to}} some extent, though there is {{apparently}} no literature on its morphology. The object {{of this paper is}} to give a brief discussion of the external morphology of the immature and adult stages and also to make a contribution to the study of the biology of this well-known polyhagous insect. The history of Lygus pratensis dates as early as 1746, when Linnaeus described it as Cimex griseus. A few years later, in 1758, the same author published the tenth edition of his “Systema Naturae” and described it as Cimex pratensis. The specific name has been retained, although the insect has been placed in different genera from time to time, such as Phytocoris, Lygaeus, Miris, Capsus. Now it definitely belongs to the genus Lygus. Many species of the genus Lygus, especially that of the sub-genus Lygus, have been called the “tarnished <b>plant</b> <b>bug.</b> ” This confusion is not surprising, however, since these species are so closely related and the morphological differences so small. But the fact that so many of them are called by the same common name is rather confusing. At the present time, Lygus pratensis Linn., is recognized as the <b>tarnished</b> <b>plant</b> <b>bug</b> and this is the species dealt with in this paper...|$|R
