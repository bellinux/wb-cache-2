25|$|In 1945 the occupying powers {{took over}} all {{newspapers}} in Germany and purged them of Nazi influence. The American occupation headquarters, the Office of Military Government, United States (OMGUS) began its own newspaper based in Munich, Die Neue Zeitung. It was edited by German and Jewish émigrés who {{fled to the}} United States before the war. Its mission was to encourage democracy by exposing Germans to <b>how</b> <b>American</b> culture operated. The paper was filled with details on American sports, politics, business, Hollywood, and fashions, as well as international affairs.|$|E

25|$|In 1965, Wolfe {{published}} {{a collection of}} his articles in this style, The Kandy-Kolored Tangerine-Flake Streamline Baby, adding to his notability. He {{published a}} second collection of articles, The Pump House Gang, in 1968. Wolfe wrote on popular culture, architecture, politics, and other topics that underscored, among other things, <b>how</b> <b>American</b> life in the 1960s had been transformed by post-WWII economic prosperity. His defining work from this era is The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test (published {{the same day as}} The Pump House Gang in 1968), which for many epitomized the 1960s. Although a conservative in many ways (in 2008, he claimed never to have used LSD and to have tried marijuana only once) Wolfe became one of the notable figures of the decade.|$|E
25|$|Korelitz (1996) shows <b>how</b> <b>American</b> Jews {{during the}} late 19th and early 20th centuries {{abandoned}} a racial definition of Jewishness in favor of one that embraced ethnicity. The key to understanding this transition from a racial self-definition to a cultural or ethnic one {{can be found in}} the ‘’Menorah Journal’’ between 1915 and 1925. During this time contributors to the Menorah promoted a cultural, rather than a racial, religious, or other view of Jewishness as a means to define Jews in a world that threatened to overwhelm and absorb Jewish uniqueness. The journal represented the ideals of the menorah movement established by Horace M. Kallen and others to promote a revival in Jewish cultural identity and combat the idea of race as a means to define or identify peoples.|$|E

500|$|... "Jubilation" [...] was {{included}} on Anka's 1972 studio album (also titled Jubilation) and released by Buddah Records in May. It {{was one of}} the two songs written by Anka on the album, with the other being [...] "She's a Lady". [...] "Jubilation" [...] was first sent to United States Top 40 radio stations in 1972 as an airplay single, accompanied by the release of two different 7" [...] singles. In a September 1972 Billboard article describing <b>how</b> <b>American</b> music would often find more success in Canada, the author claimed that despite Anka having Canadian citizenship, [...] "Jubilation" [...] was listed as [...] "domestic content" [...] on Canadian radio stations.|$|E
500|$|The {{surviving}} {{members of}} the original line-up of the Quarrymen reunited in 1997 for the 40th anniversary of their performance at the 1957 Woolton village fete—which was {{the occasion of the}} first meeting of Lennon and McCartney. [...] All five surviving original members, Pete Shotton, Rod Davis, Len Garry, Eric Griffiths and Colin Hanton, performed. Following this, the group continued to perform—undertaking tours of the UK, the US, Germany, Japan, Russia, Cuba and other countries. [...] The group's repertoire focuses on the skiffle and early rock and roll they played in their original incarnation with the added roots rock historical perspective of illustrating <b>how</b> <b>American</b> roots music inspired the nascent Beatles.|$|E
500|$|Deriving from [...] "the biting {{humor of}} Ray Davies and the {{bitterness}} of Paul Weller", Albarn's lyrics on Modern Life Is Rubbish are a social commentary and satire on contemporary suburban English life. While Rubbish celebrates modern British life, it also takes a cynical look at middle-class existence. The overt Anglo-centricism of the album was also retaliation against American popular culture; James later explained, [...] "it was f***ing scary <b>how</b> <b>American</b> everything's becoming ... so {{the whole thing was}} a f***ing big two fingers up to America". NME summarised the theme of the [...] "thinly-veiled concept album" [...] as a [...] "London odyssey crammed full of strange commuters, peeping Thomases and lost dreams; of opening the windows and breathing in petrol ... It's the Village Green Preservation Society come home to find a car park in its place".|$|E

500|$|Hill {{experienced}} discrimination {{throughout her}} climbing career {{and in an}} interview with John Stieger in Climbing, she pointed out that despite her success and prowess at climbing, this was a problem for her. She pointed to sexist remarks from male climbers who believed particular routes were impossible for female climbers and the fact that [...] "there's a lot less importance and prestige placed on women in climbing, no matter what your ability is". Hill has also commented extensively about <b>how</b> <b>American</b> culture encourages women to be passive and to forego developing muscles, which makes it harder for them to excel at climbing. She lamented this trend and was happy that her family and friends had allowed her to be the [...] "tomboy" [...] she wanted to be. Hill has explained that when competing she is not competing against men or women but with people's expectations of what women can do.|$|E
500|$|Jason Kaufman, a Harvard {{professor}} who teaches {{the sociology of}} culture, wrote that MOBA {{is part of a}} social trend he calls [...] "annoyism", where mass media venues promote performances and artists who mix the deliberately bad with the clever. The Museum of Bad Art happens to embody this trend, and further illustrates its central aim to mock the judgment system by which people identify what is bad from what is not. For Kaufman, [...] "The beauty of MOBA—though beauty is surely the wrong word—is the way it undermines aesthetic criteria from numerous angles." [...] Amy Levin, describing <b>how</b> <b>American</b> history and culture have been shaped by small local museums, suggests that MOBA is a parody of art itself, and that MOBA's commentary, newsletter, website, and publications mock museums as authorities on what is good art. The director of the Ellipse Arts Center, a gallery in Arlington, Virginia, that hosted a traveling exhibition of MOBA works, was astonished to see people's exuberant laughter because no one visiting the Ellipse had ever responded to art this way. She observed, [...] "If I didn't have a sign on the door, people might not think it's so bad. Who's to say what's bad and what's good?" ...|$|E

Moreover, at a recent London gathering, GTS filmed how Popoff supposedly 'healed' a woman 'who said her body was wracked with pain', but who Marshall and his colleague believed could have been planted in the audience as part of Popoff's team: they saw she was handing out pens and a questionnaire {{at the start of}} the event, and quietly left the room soon after the alleged miracle.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the article}} [...] "Against School" [...] (2003), the retired teacher John Taylor Gatto {{addresses}} education in modern schooling.

The objective was to divide children into sections, by distributing them by subject, by age, and by test score. Inglis introduces six basic functions for modern schooling; functions three, four, and five are related to cultural capital, and describe the manner in which schooling enforces the cultural capital of each child, from a young age.
