By this point, Guðni and Hilmar {{decided to leave the}} band’s management, and were replaced by Guðmundur Sigurfreyr Jónason. With the tour, the band gained more popularity and even managed to appear on radio and television in Denmark, they also went to a studio and recorded a few songs which were released on the 12-inch EP The Fourth Reich, in memory of Wilhelm Reich whose books had been banned by the Nazi regime. The image cover was alleged Nazi incitation because it depicted Wilhelm Reich wearing a Nazi-styled armband and the British label Shout was obligated to change the cover. However, it should be said, that the armband shown on the cover contained the symbol of the orgone physics, which represented duality and its origins in unity, referred by Reich as functionalism. On The Fourth Reich the use of percussions and rhythmical efforts were far more important than in earlier works. In this respect, the song “Zen” was particularly important due to its marked rock style, but the album did not have the impact of earlier works because the music was less accessible. The <b>Icelandic</b> <b>version</b> of this EP was released by label Mjöt, which had been created by Magnús.|$|E

Apart from that, the Scandinavian tradition is unanimous in dwelling on the incestuous relationship between Halga and his daughter Yrsa which resulted in Hroðulf, a story which was either not presented in Beowulf or was not known to the poet. The Danish sources (Chronicon Lethrense, Annales Lundenses, Gesta Danorum) all agree with Beowulf by making Hrothgar the king of Denmark. The Icelandic (Skjöldunga saga, Bjarkarímur, Hrólf Kraki's saga) all agree with Beowulf by mentioning that they had a sister, and by mentioning their feud with Froda and Ingeld, albeit with alterations.

60|$|If we {{take the}} Nibelungenlied, [Footnote: See chapter on the Nibelungenlied in Homer AND the Epic, pp. 382- 404.] we find {{that it is a}} thing of many rehandlings, even in {{existing}} manuscripts. For example, the Greeks clung to the hexameter in Homer. Not so did the Germans adhere to old metres. The poem that, in the oldest MS., is written in assonances, in later MSS. is reduced to regular rhymes and is retouched in many essential respects. The matter of the Nibelungenlied is of heathen origin. We see the real state of heathen affairs in the <b>Icelandic</b> <b>versions</b> of the same tale, for the Icelanders were peculiar in preserving ancient lays; and, when these were woven into a prose saga, the archaic and heathen features were retained. Had the post-Christian prose author of the Volsunga been a great poet, we might find in his work a true parallel to the Iliad. But, though he preserves the harmony of his picture of pre-Christian princely life (save in the savage beginnings of his story), he is not a poet; so the true parallel to the Greek epic fails, noble as is the saga in many passages. In the German Nibelungenlied all is modernised; the characters are Christian, the manners are chivalrous, and Märchen older than Homer are forced into a wandering mediaeval chronicle-poem. The Germans, in short, had no early poet of genius, and therefore could not produce a true parallel to ILIAD or Odyssey. The mediaeval poets, of course, never dreamed of archaeological anxiety, as the supposed Ionian continuators are sometimes said to have done, any more than did the French and late Welsh handlers of the ancient Celtic Arthurian materials. The late German bearbeiter of the Nibelungenlied has no idea of unity of plot--enfin, Germany, having excellent and ancient legendary material for an epic, but producing no parallel to ILIAD and Odyssey, only proves how absolutely essential a Homer was to the Greek epics.|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with how a set of different texts, all titled with various English or <b>Icelandic</b> <b>versions</b> of Egils saga, exists, can be interrelated, and may be read. The first level of interpretation, before reading of the text even begins to occur, {{is a response to}} the book as a physical object whose ordering encourages and excludes certain interpretations. The first two chapters analyze the six English translations of Egils saga : W. C. Green (1893), E. R. Eddison (1930), Gwyn Jones (1960), Christine Fell and John Lucas (1975), Hermann Palsson and Paul Edwards (1976), Bernard Scudder (1997) : together with the Icelandic editions used as their source texts, in terms of paratext, as developed by Gerard Genette. The third chapter consists of translation analyses. These use some of the methods of traditional translation criticism, together with more liberal methods of analysis associated with 'Translation Studies', as established by Susan Bassnett, among others. I conclude that the reader of translations who intends to move between 'target language' (language of translation) and 'source language' (language for translation), or who {{is in the process of}} getting the freedom to make transitions between these languages, is a special case, and that there is a literature which exists for them. By this I mean that, while it can be liberating to read literary translations as works 'in their own right', there are areas in some literary translations where it is best, or possible, to manipulate several languages and culture levels. There are also literary translations where the play between source language and target language, texts and paratexts, is necessary to their existence. Although I retain the 'source' and 'target' terminology of Translation Studies, I begin the chapter by questioning the direction of the vector: "target" texts are in some senses the 'source' texts for the 'source' texts subsequently encountered by readers between languages. The final chapter studies processes of transformation in Egils saga, following the Islenzk fornrit text. It shows how the saga itself {{is concerned with}} the meaning and powers of language and processes of transmission: it translates itself, not in a modern self-reflexive sense, but with its own, historically particular aesthetic. </p...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{present study}} was {{designed}} to evaluate the psychometric properties of the Brazilian Portuguese version of the Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory - Revised. METHOD: The Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory - Revised was administered to a total of 260 participants: a clinical sample of 130 patients with anxiety disorders (64 with a diagnosis of obsessive-compulsive disorder patients, 33 diagnosed with social phobia, and 33 with panic disorder) and a sample of 130 non-clinical subjects. RESULTS: The findings indicate that the Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory - Revised is a valid measure for identifying and assessing the severity of the six symptom subtypes in obsessive-compulsive disorder. The original factor structure of the instrument was replicated in an exploratory factor analysis. Test-retest reliability was examined using data from 64 obsessive-compulsive disorder patients who completed the inventory on two different occasions. In each sample, the overall and subscale scores showed moderate to good internal consistency, good convergent and divergent validity, and sensitivity to changes resulting from cognitive-behavioral group therapy. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that the Brazilian Portuguese version of the Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory - Revised retains the psychometric properties of its original version and the Spanish, German and <b>Icelandic</b> <b>versions.</b> OBJETIVO: O presente estudo foi delineado para avaliar as propriedades psicométricas da versão em português do Brasil do Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory - Revised.

These skills are critical for school success, but {{few studies have examined}} self-regulation among children in Iceland. In the present study, an Icelandic translation of two widely-used measures of self-regulation, one behavioral and one assessment tool for parents or teachers, will be described and their validity and reliability will be assessed. Two versions of the behavioral measure were used; the Head-to-toe-Task (HttT; McClelland, et al., 2007) was used with children around the age four, and the Head-Toe- Knees-Shoulder task (HTKS; Cameron Ponitz, McClelland, Matthews, & Morrison, 2009) was used with children in first grade. The Child Behavior Rating Scale (CBRS; Bronson, Tivnan, & Seppanen, 1995) is a parent/teacher rated scale consisting of 10 items describing children's self-regulatory behaviors. 111 children in preschool and 111 children in first grade participated in the study and the children's teachers assessed their self-regulatory skills. Results indicated that the <b>Icelandic</b> <b>versions</b> of the HttT, HTKS and CBRS captured substantial variability, had acceptable reliability, and was related to age and outcome measures of language and emergent literacy in the expected directions, which provided information about the validity of the measures. These findings suggest that both measures can be useful for assessment of self-regulation among children around the ages of four and six in Iceland. Implications of these findings for future research and applied work are discussed. Sjálfstjórn (self-regulation) er ein forsenda farsællar skólagöngu.
