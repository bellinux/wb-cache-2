Moran received his B.A. in economics in 1967. In 1970, he received a Master of Public Administration from the University of Pittsburgh. After college, Moran followed his father's <b>footstep</b> to become an amateur boxer, and during a campaign in 1992, he admitted that he had used marijuana during his early twenties. After a brief career as a stockbroker and graduate school attendance, Moran moved to Washington, D.C.|$|E
5|$|The Robillon wing {{contains}} an {{entrance to the}} palace reached by flights of ingeniously designed graduated steps. Their design creates an illusion of a longer and higher perspective, centred on a corner of a terrace because of exigencies of the site, and divided mid-flight {{so as not to}} lead the eye and <b>footstep</b> towards an angle of the colonnade beyond. The steps are adorned with elaborate statuary (see key 11). The bays of the façade are stuccoed rose-pink, contrasting with the motifs and pilasters in natural stone (see illustration).|$|E

25|$|The arpent (58.464 m), {{the unit}} of {{measurement}} employed {{in the first years}} of colonisation, fell out of use in several decades. In this context, new standards were ripe for appearance. Among these were the geometric <b>footstep</b> and above all the gaulette (4.872 m), an agrarian unit that continued to be used on a daily basis through the end of the 20th century.|$|E
25|$|Before {{the start}} of the 1877 flat season, Petrarch was offered for sale by Dupplin. He was bought by Lord Lonsdale and was moved across Newmarket to the Bedford Lodge stable of Joseph Cannon. On his first {{appearance}} of the year he carried the second highest weight of 125 pounds in the Lincolnshire Handicap on 21 March. Ridden by the champion jockey Fred Archer, he started at odds of 9/1 and finished eleventh of the thirty-three runners behind the filly <b>Footstep.</b> He was then allowed to walk over in a race at Newmarket before winning the High Level Handicap at Epsom.|$|E
25|$|As China's {{situation}} was becoming worse, Lim Goh Tong {{decided to take}} the plunge in venturing out to Malaysia (known as Malaya at that time) following his cousin, Lim Kheng Chong's <b>footstep.</b> He left China through Xiamen in early February 1937 at the age of 19. He worked for his uncle as a carpenter in the first two years, learning the Malay language in the meantime. After gaining experience he {{went on to become a}} building sub-contractor and completed his first job of building a two-storey school. He returned to Anxi in 1940, but went back to Malaya the next year amidst a deteriorating war environment.|$|E

500|$|Every main {{character}} in the show has its own unique <b>footstep</b> sound. The sound of Patrick's footsteps is recorded by the show's Foley crew, with a Foley talent wearing a slip-on shoe.

500|$|Conflicting {{statements}} from Hillenburg and Nickelodeon's official website {{have led to}} some doubt over whether the character is an octopus or a squid. Hillenburg named him Squidward because the name Octowardin the words of Squidward's voice actor Rodger Bumpass"just didn't work". The sound of Squidward's footsteps is produced by rubbing hot water bottles. The footsteps, {{and those of the}} rest of the main characters, are recorded by the show's foley crew. Sound designer Jeff Hutchins said that <b>footstep</b> sounds [...] " [...] tell which character it is and what surface they're stepping on". Bumpass inspired the idea of having Squidward ride a recumbent bicycle; Bumpass owns one of these bicycles, which he rides around Burbank, California. Bumpass described it as his [...] "little inside joke".|$|E
500|$|To obtain certain {{snow and}} ice sound effects, sound {{designer}} Odin Benitez traveled to Mammoth Mountain, California, to record them at a frozen lake. However, the foley work for the film was recorded on the foley stage on the Warner Bros. lot by a Warner Bros. crew. The foley artists received daily deliveries of 50 pounds (22.6kg) of snow ice while working, to help them record all the necessary {{snow and ice}} sounds for the film. Because the film's visuals were finalized so late, five separate versions of nearly every <b>footstep</b> on snow were recorded (corresponding to five different types of snow), then one was later selected during mixing to match the snow as rendered in {{the final version of}} each scene. One issue that the production team was [...] "particular" [...] about was the sound of Elsa's footsteps in the ice palace, which required eight attempts, including wine glasses on ice and metal knives on ice; they ended up using a mix of three sounds.|$|E

500|$|The {{introduction}} of Nos.A876A880 into service allowed No.A822 {{to be withdrawn}} for rebuilding with three separate sets of Walschaerts valve gear in August 1931. Other modifications included moving the regulator valve from the smokebox to a new Nclass-type dome to ease access during routine maintenance {{and the addition of}} a front <b>footstep</b> behind the bufferbeam. Despite the opportunity to upgrade to the [...] tender attached to the new class members, No.A822 retained its smaller-capacity [...] flat-sided Ashford tender. The result of the various modifications was a heavier locomotive, although it now benefited from upgraded track on the Eastern section and the interchange of standardised parts that reduced the time needed to complete repairs. The rebuilt locomotive emerged from Ashford works as No.1822 in October 1931. Although the N1s displayed little overall improvement over the Nclass, they proved ideal for the gauge-restricted Hastings route, where their narrower profile allowed them to operate through narrow bridges and tunnels, and their power enabled them to haul heavier trains than the predominant ex-SECR 4-4-0 and 0-6-0s.|$|E
500|$|The children’s {{publisher}} John Marshall & Co. produced The <b>footstep</b> to Mrs. Trimmer's Sacred history: for {{the instruction}} and amusement of little children in 1785. Trimmer had always advocated {{the use of}} pictorial material in books for children, and the publisher, who was experienced in producing cheap popular prints, was {{in a good position}} to publish them for her. In May 1786 Marshall published A series of prints of scripture history, [...] "designed as ornaments for those apartments in which children receive the first rudiments of their education." [...] The prints were sold [...] "pasted on boards, for hanging up in nurseries" [...] at 1s 6d, in sheets for 8d, sewed in marbled paper ‘for the pocket,’ for 10d. or else neatly bound in read leather at 1s 2d. They were also published with an accompanying small book entitled, A description of a set of prints of scripture history, which was also available in different bindings. The venture proved to be successful and these two works were quickly followed by the publication of five similar ‘Series of Prints’ together with accompanying ‘Descriptions’, compiled by Mrs Trimmer, on the subjects of Ancient history (1786), Roman history (1789), English history (1789), the New Testament (1790) and the Old Testament (1797). These were hugely popular and were reprinted by the Marshalls and their successors at regular intervals over the next thirty years.|$|E
500|$|Wildflower is a plunderphonics album; every {{track on}} the record is sample-based, similar to Since I Left You. The album has also been {{described}} as featuring electronic music, neo-psychedelia, disco, and hip hop throughout. When asked if Wildflower has more than the estimated 3,500 samples on the former record, Chater stated [...] "I’ve got no idea...there’s probably more. It’s so fragmented. Every little <b>footstep</b> and voice and yell and clatter and cowhorn and dog barking, it’s just ridiculous." [...] The group had been clearing samples starting in 2011-12, but would occasionally need to re-negotiate when owners of the source material discovered who the Avalanches were and would request more money. The sample clearance was done by Pat Shannahan in Los Angeles, who also cleared the samples for Since I Left You. The track [...] "Subways" [...] features vocals sampled from a 1980 track {{of the same name}} sung by then 12-year-old post punk artist Chandra off her EP Transportation. Chandra had not heard of the Avalanches until they approached her in early 2014 for permission to sample the track, but has since become a fan of their work. The most difficult sample to clear was of a choir from Kew High School in Melbourne singing [...] "Come Together" [...] by The Beatles on the track [...] "The Noisy Eater". Initially their request was refused, but Chater and Di Blasi made contact with Paul McCartney and Yoko Ono directly through [...] "friends of friends". They sent them the track along with a letter written by Tony explaining their process and in return were granted approval. The song would have not been added to Wildflower if the sample could not be cleared.|$|E

2500|$|Camm's {{priority}} {{was to provide}} the pilot with good all-round visibility. To this end, the cockpit was mounted reasonably high in the fuselage, creating a distinctive [...] "hump-backed" [...] silhouette. Pilot access to the cockpit was aided by a retractable [...] "stirrup" [...] mounted below {{the trailing edge of}} the port wing. This was linked to a spring-loaded hinged flap which covered a handhold on the fuselage, just behind the cockpit. When the flap was shut, the <b>footstep</b> retracted into the fuselage.

2500|$|Alongside server issues, Pokémon Go {{suffered}} from several glitches. One {{of the more}} prominent bugs appeared in mid-July 2016 and rendered the game's tracking feature useless. Normally, this feature shows between zero and three footprints to inform the player of how close they are to a nearby Pokémon; however, it universally became [...] "stuck" [...] at three steps, earning it the name [...] "three-step-glitch". Niantic removed the <b>footstep</b> feature altogether on July 30, sparking criticism from players. By August 1, players reported a new glitch that swaps their captured Pokémon with another creature at random. Another bug, confirmed by Niantic in August, inadvertently made capturing Pokémon more difficult. Some legendary Pokémon, which are rare and powerful versions of the creatures, were also obtained by players in a glitch, though they were later removed from the accounts of the trainers to keep the game fair.|$|E
2500|$|Design of a {{molecular}} dynamics simulation should account for the available computational power. Simulation size (n=number of particles), timestep, and total time duration must be selected so that the calculation can finish within a reasonable time period. However, the simulations should be {{long enough to be}} relevant to the time scales of the natural processes being studied. To make statistically valid conclusions from the simulations, the time span simulated should match the kinetics of the natural process. Otherwise, it is analogous to making conclusions about how a human walks when only looking at less than one <b>footstep.</b> Most scientific publications about the dynamics of proteins and DNA [...] use data from simulations spanning nanoseconds (10−9 s) to microseconds (10−6 s). To obtain these simulations, several CPU-days to CPU-years are needed. Parallel algorithms allow the load to be distributed among CPUs; an example is the spatial or force decomposition algorithm.|$|E
