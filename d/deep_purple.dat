5|$|The Book of Taliesyn is {{the second}} studio album by English rock band <b>Deep</b> <b>Purple,</b> {{recorded}} only three months after Shades of <b>Deep</b> <b>Purple</b> and released by Tetragrammaton Records in October 1968, just before their first US tour. The name for the album {{was taken from the}} 14th-century Book of Taliesin.|$|E
5|$|The {{music of}} the album <b>Deep</b> <b>Purple</b> was played only during the tours of 1969 and never {{performed}} again by other line-ups, though Simper played songs from the first three <b>Deep</b> <b>Purple</b> albums with the tribute band Nasty Habits in Europe in 2010.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to his main work—performing with <b>Deep</b> <b>Purple</b> and other bands during the 1970s and 1980s—he sang the role of Jesus in the original recording of Andrew Lloyd Webber's rock opera Jesus Christ Superstar, performed in the charity supergroup Rock Aid Armenia, and engaged {{in a number of}} business investments and ventures, including a hotel, a motorcycle manufacturer, and music recording facilities at Kingsway Studios. More recently, he has performed solo concerts concurrently with his latter career in <b>Deep</b> <b>Purple,</b> and his work and affinity with Armenia, combined with his continued friendship with Tony Iommi since his brief time in Black Sabbath, has led him to form the supergroup WhoCares with Iommi. His solo career outside of <b>Deep</b> <b>Purple</b> was given a comprehensive overview with the Gillan's Inn box set in 2006.|$|E

5|$|On {{the first}} of August 1968, <b>Deep</b> <b>Purple</b> entered De Lane Lea Studios in Kingsway, London, with {{producer}} Derek Lawrence and sound engineer Brian Aintsworth, who had both worked on their previous album. Tetragrammaton's advance of $250,000 {{had been used to}} book two weeks in the studio, a time which covered songwriting, rehearsals and recording sessions. Time was granted in larger amount than for the making of Shades of <b>Deep</b> <b>Purple</b> in May, feeding the band’s ambition of coming up with better original material than their previous effort.|$|E
5|$|Shades of <b>Deep</b> <b>Purple</b> is {{the debut}} studio album by the English rock band <b>Deep</b> <b>Purple,</b> {{released}} in July 1968 on Tetragrammaton in the United States and in September 1968 on Parlophone in the United Kingdom. The band, initially called Roundabout, {{was the idea}} of former Searchers drummer Chris Curtis, who recruited Jon Lord and Ritchie Blackmore before leaving the project. The Mk. I line-up of the band was completed by vocalist/frontman Rod Evans, along with bassist Nick Simper and drummer Ian Paice, in March 1968.|$|E

5|$|In April 2006 Gillan {{released}} a CD/multimedia project to document his 44-year career called Gillan's Inn. Tony Iommi, Jeff Healey, Joe Satriani, Dean Howard, {{as well as}} current and former members of <b>Deep</b> <b>Purple</b> such as Jon Lord, Roger Glover, Ian Paice, Don Airey and Steve Morse are featured on this 2006 CD and DVD. The project, produced by Nick Blagona, includes a re-recorded selection of his <b>Deep</b> <b>Purple,</b> Black Sabbath and solo tracks. At {{the same time as}} Gillan's Inn, Gillan announced that his solo albums with the Ian Gillan Band and Gillan from the 1970s and 1980s would be re-issued late in 2006 and early 2007 through Demon Records.|$|E
5|$|Made in Japan is {{a double}} live album by English rock band <b>Deep</b> <b>Purple,</b> {{recorded}} during their first tour of Japan in August 1972. It was originally released in December 1972, with a US release in April 1973, and became a commercial and critical success.|$|E
5|$|The band {{started their}} second US tour in April 1969 with little support from their almost-bankrupt American label and without an album to promote, {{because of a}} delay in the {{manufacturing}} of the new LP. During the tour, <b>Deep</b> <b>Purple</b> showed a remarkable progress as performers and a musical direction more oriented towards a heavier and louder sound than before. Doubts about compatibility of vocalist Rod Evans with the hard rock music that other band members wanted to pursue brought about the decision of searching for a substitute, which was found in Ian Gillan of the band Episode Six. Gillan formed a songwriting duo with Episode Six's bassist Roger Glover, who was also invited to join <b>Deep</b> <b>Purple</b> and replaced Nick Simper. The band's new line-up, identified as Mark II, debuted live in London on 10 July 1969.|$|E

5|$|While {{the band}} was {{recording}} the new album and touring in the UK, their managers at HEC Enterprises had found an agreement for <b>Deep</b> <b>Purple</b> to support the Rolling Stones in their upcoming US tour during Spring 1969, the first in three years and a certain sold-out event. Unfortunately, the Rolling Stones decided {{to spend more time}} at Olympic Studios in London to record their album Let It Bleed and postponed their tour. Thus, in early April 1969 <b>Deep</b> <b>Purple</b> were on their way back to the US to start off a two-month coast-to-coast tour as headliners which, similarly to what had happened in Britain, brought them mainly to small clubs and colleges. This time their trek also touched Canada, where their albums were distributed by Polydor Records.|$|E
5|$|After {{about two}} months of rehearsals, Shades of <b>Deep</b> <b>Purple</b> was {{recorded}} in only three days in May 1968 and contains four original songs and four covers, thoroughly rearranged to include classical interludes and sound more psychedelic. Stylistically the music is close to psychedelic rock and progressive rock, two genres with an ever-growing audience in the late 1960s.|$|E
5|$|At {{the urging}} of Glover, Lord and Paice, who wanted him in the fold for the band's 25th anniversary tour, Gillan rejoined <b>Deep</b> <b>Purple</b> in 1992 to record the album The Battle Rages On. Gillan was unhappy with working on the album, as {{it had already been}} {{partially}} completed with Joe Lynn Turner, and he was only required to write replacement lyrics and vocal melodies, which, unsurprisingly, drew criticism from Blackmore.|$|E
