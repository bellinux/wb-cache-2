The video reflects the song's central theme of being in unsettled situations and getting through them. In {{the beginning of the}} video, Armstrong is shown as a solitary figure; his bandmates Mike Dirnt and Tre Cool are sitting lethargically in a different location. The video explores situations of various other characters as well, all starting out in a dejected state. The shots of Armstrong, Dirnt, and Cool are repeatedly seen interspersed with developments {{in the lives of the}} other characters. Eventually, all of them manage to <b>find</b> <b>things</b> that make them happy. As the video reaches its end, Armstrong is seen entering a warehouse and being happily reunited with his bandmates, who had begun to play their instruments.|$|E
500|$|Gatiss has criticised recent {{television}} {{adaptations of}} the Conan Doyle stories as [...] "too reverential and too slow", aiming instead {{to be as}} irreverent to the canon as the 1930s and 1940s films starring Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce, which were mostly set in the then contemporary interwar era. Benedict Cumberbatch's Sherlock uses modern technology, such as texting, the internet and GPS to solve crimes. Paul McGuigan, who directed two episodes of Sherlock, says that this {{is in keeping with}} Conan Doyle's character, pointing out that [...] "n the books he would use any device possible and he was always in the lab doing experiments.

It's kind of exhilarating for that reason," [...] he said. The nude scene was DiCaprio and Winslet's first scene together. [...] "It wasn't by any kind of design, although I couldn't have designed it better. There's a nervousness and an energy and a hesitance in them," [...] Cameron stated. [...] "They had rehearsed together, but they hadn't shot anything together. If I'd had a choice, I probably would have preferred to put it deeper into the body of the shoot." [...] Cameron said he and his crew [...] "were just trying to <b>find</b> <b>things</b> to shoot" [...] because the big set [...] "wasn't ready for months, so we were scrambling around trying to fill in anything we could get to shoot." [...] After seeing the scene on film, Cameron felt it worked out considerably well.|$|E

They are both {{surprised}} by Roy's beautiful home and the elegant wedding details, and Roy tells them he runs a very successful gravel company. During his wedding toast, Roy stuns his lovely bride by performing [...] "She's Got a Way" [...] by Billy Joel on the piano, saying that {{he told her he}} was taking boxing lessons as a cover for learning some music for her instead. Pam and Jim, convinced they already know everything about one another but stunned by Roy's transformation, try to <b>find</b> <b>things</b> about themselves the other does not know. This is exacerbated by Jim's frequent calls about a new business he is starting with a friend, because Jim and Pam agreed that the venture was not right for them, but Jim then signed onto it without telling his wife he had done so.

500|$|A {{lot of my}} {{performances}} {{have had}} fire involved, so we thought 'Heat.' Also, red {{is one of my}} favorite colors, as is gold. So then we thought of making the bottle look like it's on fire. I love antique bottles — my mother had a collection of them when I was growing up. I wanted something with an antique yet modern feeling. Even with my wardrobe, I always try to <b>find</b> <b>things</b> that have a little bit of something vintage, yet still timeless and classic. The bottle, I felt, was a great mixture of the two... Everything, from the bottle design to the name and the ideas for the commercials–that's me.

I learned a lot of great things from the past — but I always asked myself, 'If I could have my own scent, what would it be?' I wasn't worried about deadlines. It could have taken me three, four, however many years — this was my first fragrance, and I wanted to make sure that it was something I would love forever.|$|E
500|$|... "Mortal Folly" [...] and [...] "Mortal Recoil" [...] {{feature the}} first {{substantial}} {{appearance of the}} Lich, the series' primary antagonist, who made an early appearance in the season one episode [...] "His Hero" [...] being defeated by Billy in a flashback. The Lich had appeared in concept drawings in the series' pitch bible, which Ward himself had created in 2007. Ward's original drawing was re-designed by former creative director McHale; he purposely gave the Lich a desiccated and dried-up look, and was instrumental in crafting the Lich's rotting appearance. In both this episode and other episodes where the character appears, the Lich was voiced by Ron Perlman. The snail, an easter egg that appears in every episode, appears in the episodes and plays a prominent part. Originally, the snail {{was inspired by the}} in-jokes in episodes of The Simpsons, and was Ward's attempt to [...] "make a game out of every episode of Adventure Time, where you could freeze-frame and <b>find</b> <b>things</b> in the background", such as the snail. However, in [...] "Mortal Folly", the snail serves as the catalyst for the Lich's escape. The snail would also play an important part in other mythology-heavy episodes like [...] "In Your Footsteps", and [...] "The Lich". Osborne later noted that the snail's appearance was pleasing to fans who knew that the snail had been appearing in all the episodes and had actively searched for it before.|$|E

500|$|In September 2006 Pope Benedict XVI gave {{a speech}} on the {{question}} of the [...] "reasonableness" [...] of the Christian faith, to the University of Regensburg in Germany. In the Regensburg lecture he spoke about rationality in faith, and cited comments by the fourteenth-century Byzantine emperor Manuel II Palaiologos, who, as the Pope put it, said [...] "show me just what Mohamed brought that was new, and there you will <b>find</b> <b>things</b> only evil and inhuman, such as his command to spread by the sword the faith he preached." [...] The citation attracted severe criticism from Muslims around the world, including the parliament of Pakistan which condemned the Pope for his comments, and which sought an apology from him. [...] Following the speech, on 17 September Choudary led a protest outside Westminster Cathedral, where he told reporters [...] "Whoever insults the message of Mohammed is going to be subject to capital punishment." [...] The Daily Mail reported him as saying: [...] "I am here [...] have a peaceful demonstration, but there may be people in Italy and other parts that would carry that out." [...] The Metropolitan Police investigated his comments, but concluded that [...] "no substantive offences" [...] were committed during the demonstration. The Shadow Home Secretary, David Davis, who had called for action to be taken against Choudary, said: [...] "It is quite disgraceful. It sends out a message to Muslim extremists that we, as a country, do not have the moral courage to stand up to them." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{development}} team {{felt that}} with previous Ace Attorney games, players could identify with Phoenix Wright and Apollo Justice; for Ace Attorney Investigations, they wanted players to be {{immersed in the}} game and feel like they are Edgeworth. He said that they think players will feel a connection with Edgeworth and understand his character. As examples of this, Eshiro cited the ability to directly control Edgeworth, and the possibility to see inside his head: the game's logic system was created because the development team wanted to show how Edgeworth thinks. It represents what is happening inside his mind, which Eshiro describes as a [...] "very cool, calm and collected way of thinking". For the rebuttal phases in the game, Eshiro wanted to try out new things that could not be done in courtroom battles: during rebuttals, several characters come in and out during each scene at a rapid pace, providing the player with evidence, to create drama with tension. Ace Attorney Investigations has a larger focus on the environment than previous Ace Attorney titles had; previous titles featured gameplay elements in which the player finds contradictions in suspects' statements, whereas the goal of Ace Attorney Investigations is to <b>find</b> <b>things</b> at the crime scene that contradict the evidence the player has. The game's third person perspective was specifically chosen to be different from the main series' first person perspective, and to show the environment so that players can walk around inside it. The game system was designed specifically for Ace Attorney Investigations, with the aim of being different from the main series; therefore, Eshiro felt that a lot of its features should stay within the Investigations series, and not be used in other Ace Attorney titles.|$|E

2500|$|As {{a part of}} his {{explication}} of this distinction, Pope Benedict {{referred to}} a specific aspect of Islam that Manuel II considered irrational, namely the practice of forced conversion.

The lecture received much attention from political and religious authorities. Many Islamic politicians and religious leaders registered their protest against what they labelled an insulting mischaracterisation of Islam, although his focus was aimed towards the rationality of religious violence, and its effect on the religion. Muslims were particularly offended by this passage that the Pope quoted in his speech: [...] "Show me just what Muhammad brought that was new and there you will <b>find</b> <b>things</b> only evil and inhuman, such as his command to spread by the sword the faith he preached." ...|$|E

2500|$|The cast of playable {{characters}} in Overwatch {{was selected to}} portray diverse representations of genders and ethnicities, including males, females, and non-human characters such as robots and a gorilla. The need for a diverse cast was important to the developers, as some of Blizzard's previous games had been criticized before for missing this mark; Metzen explained that even his daughter had asked him why all the female characters from Warcraft seemed to be only wearing swimsuits. Metzen stated: [...] "Specifically for Overwatch {{over the past year}} we've been really cognizant of that, trying not to oversexualize the female characters." [...] Kaplan explained that the industry was [...] "clearly in an age where gaming is for everybody," [...] going on to say that [...] "increasingly, people want to feel represented, from all walks of life, boys and girls, everybody. We feel indebted to do our best to honor that." [...] Michael Chu expressed that the diverse group of characters is a result of Blizzard's approach to game design, elaborating that [...] "We've tried [...] have a diverse cast of characters and diverse locations that you go through, and hopefully these characters - even beyond national diversity; just seeing their personalities, their backstories, their occupations - hopefully people will <b>find</b> <b>things</b> in common with these characters." ...|$|E
