5000|$|When naturalised in the Pacific Northwest, it {{is often}} seen in {{association}} with the related European plant, <b>herb</b> <b>Robert</b> (Geranium robertianum), also classified as a noxious weed. In these areas, shining cranesbill seems to thrive in woodlands and forest glades, where it tends to overwhelm the native plants. State legislation has been enacted making it [...] "prohibited to transport, buy, sell, offer for sale, or to distribute plants or plant parts, seeds in packets, blends or [...] "wildflower mixes" [...] of this species, into or within the state of Washington".|$|E
5000|$|In {{traditional}} herbalism, <b>Herb</b> <b>Robert</b> {{was used}} as a remedy for toothache and nosebleeds and as a vulnerary (used for or useful in healing wounds). The name has been explained as a reference to abbot and herbalist Robert of Molesme. Freshly picked leaves have an odor resembling burning tires when crushed, and if they are rubbed on the body the smell is said to repel mosquitoes. [...] The active ingredients are tannins, a bitter compound called geraniin, and essential oils. It was carried to attract good luck, and due to its analogical association with storks, to enhance fertility.|$|E
50|$|Several factors {{contribute}} to the biodiversity of Bartholomew's Cobble. First, the region is so spacially and climatically located that it contains a number of species that reach the northern or southern limit of their range in North America. Second, the property {{is located at the}} boundary of two distinct state bioregions: the marble valley lowlands of The Berkshires geology and the Taconic uplands. Third, the Cobbles, twin rocky knolls abutting the Housatonic River, are composed of quartzite, an acidic rock, and marble, an alkaline (calcareous) rock. This produces high variation in soil chemistry, which in turn supports species of ferns and other plants that do not normally grow in close proximity to one another. Fern species include the walking fern, maidenhair spleenwort, mountain spleenwort, maidenhair fern, bulblet fern, marginal woodfern, polypody, ostrich fern, and evergreen woodfern. Flowering plant species include red columbine, <b>herb</b> <b>Robert,</b> northern prickly ash, bloodroot, spring beauty, bergamot, mayapple, and round-lobed hepatica.|$|E
25|$|The hybrid {{nature of}} A.×ebenoides was {{suspected}} {{at the time}} of its discovery in 1862, but the existence of fern hybrids was scientifically controversial at the time. (The existence of the fertile individuals in Havana Glen, discovered in 1873, further confused the issue.) In 1902, Margaret Slosson hybridized A.rhizophyllum and A.platyneuron in pure culture to produce specimens effectively identical to A.×ebenoides, one of the first uses of this technique to demonstrate the parentage of a natural hybrid fern. In 1957, <b>Herb</b> Wagner and <b>Robert</b> S. Whitmire experimentally converted sterile diploid A.×ebenoides to the fertile tetraploid form, the first creation of an allopolyploid fern in the laboratory.|$|R
5000|$|Soon {{after the}} first scripts for Star Trek were being written, Gene Roddenberry spoke of a new character, a female {{communications}} officer and introduced <b>Herb</b> Solow and <b>Robert</b> Justman to Nichols, {{who had worked for}} him on The Lieutenant. [...] Although [...] "The Cage" [...] (the first pilot episode of Star Trek, featuring a female first officer, Number One) was knocked back, Roddenberry continued to seek diversity in his casting for the series, including a greater emphasis on racial diversity, with Nichols as Uhura and George Takei as Sulu. [...] Uhura's role of [...] "answering the phone" [...] has been described as gender normative for the era.|$|R
5000|$|Sagebrush Symphony is {{the nineteenth}} album by American singer-songwriter Michael Martin Murphey, his second live album since his 1979 live/studio album Peaks,Valleys,Honkytonks and Alleys, {{and his first}} album with a symphony orchestra. Recorded live with the San Antonio Symphony Orchestra, this ambitious album, which {{presents}} cowboy songs and poems in a symphonic setting, contains a selection of Murphey's most popular songs, as well as traditional cowboy music. Murphey turns in [...] "an impassioned performance" [...] and the inclusion of guest artists Sons of the San Joaquin, Ric Orozco, <b>Herb</b> Jeffries, and <b>Robert</b> Mirabal [...] "adds to the musical diversity and richness of the album." ...|$|R
