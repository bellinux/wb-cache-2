5|$|Reception of the Game Gear was mixed, with {{praise for}} its full-color backlit screen and {{processing}} power for its time, criticisms over its large size and short battery life, and questions over {{the quality of}} its <b>game</b> <b>library.</b>|$|E
5|$|Selling 3.5 million units, the WonderSwan only {{picked up}} 8% of the marketshare in Japan and was {{ultimately}} outperformed by Nintendo's Game Boy Advance. Due to its brightly colored screen and deep <b>game</b> <b>library,</b> the Game Boy Advance ensured Nintendo {{would have a}} near-monopoly on the handheld console market in Japan until {{the release of the}} PlayStation Portable by Sony in 2004.|$|E
5|$|The 32X is {{considered}} a commercial failure. Reception after the add-on's unveiling and launch was positive, highlighting the low price {{of the system and}} power expansion to the Genesis. Later reviews, both contemporary and retrospective, for the 32X have been mostly negative because of its shallow <b>game</b> <b>library,</b> poor market timing and the resulting market fragmentation for the Genesis.|$|E

5|$|Nintendo of America's Nintendo Entertainment System was {{the best}} selling console system and almost all video game {{developers}} and publishers wanted to contribute the video <b>game</b> <b>library.</b> The NES, at its peak, controlled 90% of the 8-bit market in the United States. Companies such as Konami, Capcom and Acclaim Entertainment derived many of their gaming ideas from two sources to better capitalize on the growing industry. The first strategy was to take games that were already popular on arcade, such as Contra, and port them to home console versions. Their second idea was to produce game versions of popular movies and television.|$|E
5|$|Succeeding the SG-1000, the Master System was {{released}} {{as a direct}} competitor to the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) in the third generation of video game consoles. The NES used virtually the same hardware as the 1983 Famicom while the Master System was constructed with more up-to-date hardware. Despite improved hardware, it failed to overturn Nintendo's significant market share advantage in Japan and North America. However, it attained significantly more success in Europe and Brazil. Compared with its competition from Nintendo, the Master System's <b>game</b> <b>library</b> lacked a number of well-received titles, due to Nintendo licensing policies requiring platform exclusivity to the NES.|$|E
5|$|The Sega Saturn is a 32-bit {{fifth-generation}} {{home video}} game console {{that was developed}} by Sega and released on November 22, 1994 in Japan, May 11, 1995 in North America, and July 8, 1995 in Europe. The successor to the successful Sega Genesis, the Saturn has a dual-CPU architecture and eight processors. Its games are in CD-ROM format, and its <b>game</b> <b>library</b> contains several arcade ports as well as original titles.|$|E
50|$|Plug-and-play {{systems have}} been {{released}} or licensed by companies such as Atari, Sega, and Nintendo. These systems include stand-alone <b>game</b> <b>libraries</b> and plug directly into the user’s television.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to supporting its {{own line of}} game cartridges, the console was intended to have plugin modules that would have supported the ColecoVision and Atari 2600 <b>game</b> <b>libraries.</b>|$|R

5|$|Since its release, Jetpac {{has been}} {{included}} in other games developed by Rare. The game is playable in Donkey Kong 64, where it could be unlocked to play in Cranky Kong's laboratory after obtaining 15 Banana Medals. Beating Cranky Kong's high score rewards the player with the Rareware Coin, which is necessary to beat the game. The game was retained in the April 2015 Virtual Console re-release of Donkey Kong 64 on the Wii U, despite it being technically owned by Microsoft. An enhanced remake of Jetpac, entitled Jetpac Refuelled, was released on the Xbox Live Arcade in March 2007. Microsoft's E3 2015 press conference unveiled the compilation title Rare Replay, which has a selection of thirty games from Rare's lifetime <b>game</b> <b>library,</b> including Jetpac and its sequels and remake.|$|E
5|$|The Nomad {{does not}} have its own <b>game</b> <b>library,</b> but instead plays Genesis games. At {{the time of its}} launch, the Nomad had over 500 games {{available}} for play. However, no pack-in title was included. The Nomad can boot unlicensed, homebrew, and bootleg games made for the Genesis. Some earlier third-party titles have compatibility issues when played on the Nomad, but can be successfully played {{through the use of a}} Game Genie. Likewise, due to its lack of compatibility with any of the Genesis' add-ons, it is unable to play any games for the Sega Master System, Sega CD, or Sega 32X. The Nomad employs two different regional lockout methods, physical and software, but methods have been found to bypass these.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{revealed}} at E3 2003, with a playable demo being a mostly complete {{version of the}} game, albeit with a few levels missing. Grabbed by the Ghoulies was released in North America on 21 October 2003, in Europe on 21 November 2003 and in Japan on 29 April 2004, becoming Rare's first game to be released under Microsoft. It was later re-released as an Xbox Originals game for the Xbox 360 on 16 February 2009, later being removed from the store on 16 June 2015. At Microsoft's E3 2015 press conference, the compilation title Rare Replay was unveiled. Rare Replay has a selection of thirty games from Rare's lifetime <b>game</b> <b>library,</b> including Grabbed by the Ghoulies. The game was remastered to run natively on the Xbox One, increasing its resolution and framerate relative to the original Xbox release.|$|E

50|$|Aside from Objective-C, {{there are}} {{official}} bindings for Ruby, and third party interfaces exist for Python, Haskell, OCaml, and others. Chipmunk is endorsed {{by a number}} of <b>game</b> <b>libraries,</b> including Aerosol, Gosu, and Cocos2d.|$|R
5|$|Windows 10 {{provides}} heavier {{integration with}} the Xbox ecosystem. Xbox SmartGlass is succeeded by the Xbox app, which {{allows users to}} browse their <b>game</b> <b>library</b> (including both PC and Xbox console games), and Game DVR is also available using a keyboard shortcut, allowing users to save the last 30 seconds of gameplay as a video that can be shared to Xbox Live, OneDrive, or elsewhere. Windows 10 also allows users to control and play games from an Xbox One console over a local network. The Xbox Live SDK allows application developers to incorporate Xbox Live functionality into their apps, and future wireless Xbox One accessories, such as controllers, are supported on Windows with an adapter. Microsoft also intends to allow cross-buys and save synchronization between Xbox One and Windows 10 versions of games; Microsoft Studios games such as ReCore and Quantum Break are intended as being exclusive to Windows 10 and Xbox One.|$|E
5|$|The Steam client, {{as part of}} {{a social}} network service, allows users to {{identify}} friends and join groups using the Steam Community feature. Users can use text chat and peer-to-peer VoIP with other users, identify which games their friends and other group members are playing, and join and invite friends to Steamworks-based multiplayer games that support this feature. Users can participate in forums hosted by Valve to discuss Steam games. Each user has a unique page that shows his or her groups and friends, <b>game</b> <b>library</b> including earned achievements, game wishlists, and other social features; users can choose to keep this information private. In January 2010, Valve reported that 10million of the 25million active Steam accounts had signed up to Steam Community. In conjunction with the 2012 Steam Summer Sale, user profiles were updated with Badges reflecting the user's participation in the Steam community and past events. Steam Trading Cards were introduced in beta in May 2013 and were fully supported by June 2013. By playing specific games, players would earn virtual trading cards, which they could trade with friends and use towards gaining rewards on the service such as game discounts, downloadable content, or in-game items, and customize their user profile page. In 2010, the Steam client became an OpenID provider, allowing third-party websites to use a Steam user's identity without requiring the user to expose his or her Steam credentials. In order to prevent abuse, access to most community features is restricted until a one-time payment of at least 5 is made to Valve. This requirement can be fulfilled by making any purchase of five dollars or more on Steam, or by adding at the same amount to their wallet.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} media center {{software}} solutions exist for Linux, Unix, and BSD based operating systems; for example MythTV is a fully fledged integrated suite of software which incorporates TV recording, video library, video <b>game</b> <b>library,</b> image/picture gallery, information portal and music collection playback among other capabilities.|$|E

25|$|MacKimmie {{library was}} the first library to open at the University of Calgary in 1966. Since then, five {{different}} library branches have been opened {{in order to provide}} students with a greater amount of literary choice in many subjects. In addition, the University of Calgary has the first library system in North America to contain a video <b>game</b> <b>library.</b> Over 3.7million printed volumes combined with online access to more than 300,000 full-text electronic journals and more than 800 electronic databases are available at the university. As of 2012, the library system is the eighth largest, by the number of volumes held, in Canada. In 2011–2012 the university library was rated 43rd in North America for Total Library Expenditures by the Association of Research Libraries.|$|E
25|$|The Xbox Guide {{has also}} been redesigned. Players are not only able to view their friends and messages, but are able to access their <b>game</b> <b>library.</b> If a user has {{installed}} any game onto their Xbox 360 Hard drive, {{they are able to}} immediately start the game from the guide, whether they are in a game or in the dashboard. Microsoft also confirmed that every new 360 comes with 3 free Xbox Live Gold trial accounts, upon creating a new account the player is allowed to claim a trial period upon refusing to pay for Gold subscription; therefore allowing the user to try online gameplay for that one-month trial period, after which the player is required to pay subscription fees to continue matchmaking online. Major Nelson also announced that the update supports 16:10 on VGA or HDMI, expanding the choice of resolutions.|$|E
25|$|The GameCube (officially called Nintendo GameCube, {{abbreviated}} NGC in Japan and GCN in North America) {{was released}} in 2001, in Japan and North America, and in 2002 worldwide. The sixth-generation console is the successor to the Nintendo 64 and competed with Sony's PlayStation 2, Microsoft's Xbox, and Sega's Dreamcast. The GameCube is the first Nintendo console to use optical discs as its primary storage medium. The discs {{are similar to the}} miniDVD format, but the system was not designed to play standard DVDs or audio CDs. Nintendo introduced a variety of connectivity options for the GameCube. The GameCube's <b>game</b> <b>library</b> has sparse support for Internet gaming, a feature that requires the use of the aftermarket Nintendo GameCube Broadband Adapter and Modem Adapter. The GameCube supports connectivity to the Game Boy Advance, allowing players to access exclusive in-game features using the handheld as a second screen and controller.|$|E
50|$|Linux {{has been}} criticized for a number of reasons, {{including}} lack of user-friendliness and having a steep learning curve, being inadequate for desktop use, lacking support for exotic hardware, having a relatively small <b>games</b> <b>library</b> and lacking native versions of widely used applications.|$|R
25|$|Midway Amusement Games, L.L.C. in Chicago, Illinois. Its {{assets were}} {{acquired}} by Happ Controls on October 1, 2001. This {{was the original}} arcade division of the company (founded as Midway Manufacturing Company) and maintained its own intellectual property, specifically the Midway, Bally/Midway and Williams arcade <b>game</b> <b>libraries.</b>|$|R
50|$|The console's multi-chip {{architecture}} made game {{development for}} the console difficult, and underwhelming sales further contributed to the console's lack of third party support. This, {{in addition to the}} lack of internal development at Atari, led to a limited <b>games</b> <b>library,</b> comprising only 67 licensed titles.|$|R
25|$|The {{concept of}} the Switch came about as Nintendo's {{reaction}} to several quarters of financial losses into 2014, attributed to poor sales of its previous console, the Wii U, and market competition from mobile gaming. Nintendo's then-president Satoru Iwata pushed the company towards mobile gaming and novel hardware. The Switch's design is aimed at a wide demographic of video game players through the multiple modes of use. Nintendo opted to use more standard electronic components, such as a chipset based on Nvidia's Tegra line, to make development for the console easier for programmers and more compatible with existing game engines. As the Wii U had struggled to gain external support, leaving it with a weak software library, Nintendo preemptively sought the support of many third-party developers and publishers to help build out the Switch's <b>game</b> <b>library</b> alongside Nintendo's own first-party titles, including many independent video game studios. Prior to launch, Nintendo had announced that over 100 titles were in development by 70 developers.|$|E
500|$|... 2.24 million Sega CD {{units were}} sold by March 1996, {{after which the}} system was officially {{discontinued}} as Sega shifted its focus to the Sega Saturn. Retrospective reception to the add-on is mixed, praising the Sega CD for its individual offerings and additions to the Genesis' functions, but offering criticism to the <b>game</b> <b>library</b> for its depth issues, {{the high price of}} the unit, and how the add-on was supported by Sega.|$|E
500|$|Though the Game Gear {{was rushed}} to market, its unique <b>game</b> <b>library</b> and price point gave it an edge over the Atari Lynx and TurboExpress. [...] However, due to issues with its short battery life, lack of {{original}} titles, and weak support from Sega, the Game Gear was unable to surpass the Game Boy, selling 10.62 million units by March 1996. The Game Gear was succeeded by the Genesis Nomad in 1995 and discontinued in 1997. It was re-released as a budget system by Majesco Entertainment in 2000, under license by Sega.|$|E
5000|$|Development was in {{progress}} [...] on new core features integrating a built-in Games Manager and Game Launcher front-end GUI with a <b>Games</b> <b>Library,</b> and <b>Game</b> Console Emulator API into XBMC.
