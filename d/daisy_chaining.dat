25|$|Some {{products}} that implement SPI may be connected in a daisy chain configuration, the first slave output being {{connected to the}} second slave input, etc. The SPI port of each slave is designed to send out during the second group of clock pulses an exact copy of the data it received during {{the first group of}} clock pulses. The whole chain acts as a communication shift register; <b>daisy</b> <b>chaining</b> is often done with shift registers to provide a bank of inputs or outputs through SPI. Such a feature only requires a single SS line from the master, rather than a separate SS line for each slave.|$|E

50|$|<b>Daisy</b> <b>chaining</b> DNA is {{the process}} of when DNA {{undergoing}} PCR amplification becomes tangled and forms a 'daisy chain.' During PCR, primers or dNTP's will eventually be used up and limit further reactions; it is when the primers deplete that causes <b>daisy</b> <b>chaining.</b> Since the denaturing and annealing processes still continue without primers, the single-stranded DNA molecules reanneal to themselves. However, this reannealing does not always occur to another complementary strand. It is this imperfect match up that causes 'tangles'. These tangles look like a daisy chain.|$|E
50|$|When clipped in, <b>daisy</b> <b>chains</b> {{should not}} be {{shortened}} by clipping in another pocket to the same carabiner. Failure of the pocket stitching results in the <b>daisy</b> <b>chain</b> disconnecting from the anchor, with potentially fatal consequences. If shortening the <b>daisy</b> <b>chain</b> when clipped in, in order to eliminate dangerous slack, a second carabiner {{should be used to}} connect to the anchor.|$|R

40|$|For many {{positive}} odd integers n, whether prime or not, the set Un of units of Zn contains members t, u, v and w, say with respective orders τ, ψ, ω and π, such {{that we can}} write Un as the direct product Un = 〈t〉×〈u〉×〈v〉×〈w〉. Each element of Un can then be written in the form thuiv jwk where 0 ≤ h<τ, 0 ≤ i<ψ, 0 ≤ j<ωand 0 ≤ k<π. We can then often use the structure of 〈t〉×〈u 〉 ×〈v〉×〈w 〉 to arrange the τψωπ elements of Un in a <b>daisy</b> <b>chain,</b> i. e. in a circular arrangement such that, as we proceed once round the chain in either direction, the set of differences between each member and the preceding one is itself the set Un. We describe <b>daisy</b> <b>chains</b> based on such 4 -factor decompositions as <b>daisy</b> <b>chains</b> with four generators. We study {{the existence of such}} arrangements, and we note their relationships with the previously studied <b>daisy</b> <b>chains</b> with three generators.

5000|$|A <b>daisy</b> <b>chain</b> is a strap, {{several feet}} long and {{typically}} constructed from one-inch tubular nylon webbing of the same type used in lengthening straps between anchor-points and the main rope. The webbing is bar tacked at roughly two-inch intervals (or, in the past, tied) to create a length of small loops for attachment. Unlike the use of similar devices in backpacking, <b>daisy</b> <b>chains</b> in technical rock climbing {{are expected to be}} of sufficient strength to be [...] "load bearing,". <b>Daisy</b> <b>chain</b> pockets however are not rated to full strength, and can only take static loads.|$|R

50|$|The {{original}} ADM-3 terminal {{was introduced}} in May, 1975 at a price of $995. It only displayed capital letters; in 1976, an option was added {{to allow it to}} display both lower and upper case. The standard version of the terminal displayed only twelve (rather than twenty-four) rows of eighty characters. In those days RAM was expensive, and halving the display size halved the RAM requirement (and likewise all uppercase required only six bits per character to be stored rather than seven). Further optional add-ons included a graphics card enabling it to emulate a Tektronix 4014 and an extension port which would allow <b>daisy</b> <b>chaining</b> several ADM-3As on a single RS-232 line.|$|E

50|$|Typically of Sinclair Research, the ZX Microdrive was {{comparatively}} cheap (£49.95 at launch) and technologically innovative {{but also}} rather limited. Connecting a ZX Microdrive to a ZX Spectrum required the ZX Interface 1 unit, costing £49.95, although {{this could be}} bought packaged with a Microdrive for £79.95. Later, in March 1985, the ZX Spectrum Expansion System was launched for £99.95. This consisted of Interface 1, a Microdrive, a blank cartridge and several cartridges containing Tasword Two word processor plus Masterfile filing system, Quicksilva's Games Designer and Ant Attack game, and an introductory cartridge. A total of eight ZX Microdrive units could {{be connected to the}} Interface 1 by <b>daisy</b> <b>chaining</b> one drive to the next via an electrical connector block.|$|E
50|$|All {{of these}} {{enhancements}} are collected {{as part of}} the IEEE 1284 standard. The first release in 1994 included original Centronics mode ("compatibility mode"), nibble and byte modes, as well as a change to the handshaking that was already widely used; the original Centronics implementation called for the BUSY lead to toggle with each change on any line of data (busy-by-line), whereas IEEE 1284 calls for BUSY to toggle with each received character (busy-by-character). This reduces the number of BUSY toggles and the resulting interruptions on both sides. A 1997 update standardized the printer status codes. In 2000, the EPP and ECP modes were moved into the standard, as well as several connector and cable styles, and a method for <b>daisy</b> <b>chaining</b> up to eight devices from a single port.|$|E
50|$|The first {{variation}} of the Disk II introduced for the Apple ///, called the Disk III (A3M0004), used the identical drive mechanism inside a modified plastic case with a proprietary connector. With some modification both drives are interchangeable.

The Disk III {{was the first to}} allow <b>daisy</b> <b>chaining</b> of up to three additional drives to the single 26-pin ribbon cable connector on the Apple ///, for a total of 4 floppy disk drives - the Apple /// was the first Apple to contain a built-in drive mechanism.
