In this paper we analyse the Italian natural gas market, focusing in particular on retail with the objective of assessing the performance of the natural gas retail operators whilst also taking into account the strategies adopted after the liberalization process. To that aim, company performance is analysed using the <b>Edgeworth</b> <b>index</b> which enables an assessment of levels of both profitability and productivity. Two types of comparisons are carried out based on the processed data. The first of which concerns the size of the company and second regards the degree of specialisation or diversification of the services offered...|$|E

40|$|We are constructing, for {{the problem}} of {{univariate}} symmetry (with respect to specified or unspecified location), a class of signed-rank tests achieving optimality against the family of asymmetric (local) alternatives considered in Cassart et al. (Bernoulli 17 : 1063 – 1094, 2011). Those alternatives {{are based on a}} non-Gaussian generalization of classical first-order <b>Edgeworth</b> expansions <b>indexed</b> by a measure of skewness such that (1) location, scale, and skewness play well-separated roles (diagonality of the corresponding information matrices), and (2) the classical tests based on the Pearson-Fisher coefficient of skewness are optimal in the vicinity of Gaussian densities. Asymptotic distributions are derived under the null and under local alternatives. Asymptotic relative efficiencies are computed and, in most cases, indicate that the proposed rank tests significantly outperform their traditional competitors.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to provide, for the problem of univariate symmetry (with respect to specified or unspecified location), a concept of optimality, and to construct parametric and signed rank tests achieving such optimality. This requires embedding symmetry into adequate families of asymmetric (local) alternatives. We construct such families by considering non-Gaussian generalizations of classical first-order <b>Edgeworth</b> expansions <b>indexed</b> by a measure of skewness such that (i) location, scale and skewness play well-separated roles (diagonality of the corresponding information matrices), and (ii) the classical tests based on the Pearson-Fisher coefficient of skewness are optimal in the vicinity of Gaussian densities. The signed-rank tests we are proposing are based on an original estimator of crossinformation quantities, and are distribution-free (asymptotically distribution-free, in the case of unspecified location) under an extremely broad class of symmetric densities. Asymptotic relative efficiencies with respect to the classical Gaussian procedure are particularly high when Gaussian scores are considered, and uniformly larger than one, for instance, over the whole class of Student and power-exponential densities...|$|R
40|$|This thesis in {{the area}} of {{environmental}} economics examines medical waste. The goal is to assess the current practices employed by healthcare institutions regarding categorisation, handling, data collection, data analysis, and to evaluate the recent trends in waste’s price and quantity movements. This goal is to be accomplished using the index number theory. I have analysed the data for two hospitals in Finland: Kuopio University Hospital for the years 2003 through 2006 and Oulu University Hospital for the period of 2004 to 2005. I have discovered major flaws in the current categorisation and handling practices. Waste is divided into very uneven categories, with only part of the waste types being recognised. The current method of categorisation is mainly based on the classification of waste used by the waste managing companies. I propose to make it common practice to identify all the waste types and record simultaneously each waste type’s quantity and service price charged for that quantity. I also propose determining all the main factors used in handling each waste type at the healthcare institution to establish the total price for that type and give examples of how to accomplish this. The index number theory and its main concepts are introduced. I criticise the practices of healthcare institutions of adding the quantities of different wastes together to report total amount as wrong. Regardless of units of measurement various wastes constitute different values. I propose the use of index numbers instead. I argue that relative changes and index numbers should be measured in natural logarithms and results presented in log-percentages. The index numbers are shown to be ideal tools for examining medical waste. The changes in the total value of waste are decomposed into changes due to variations of prices and changes due to variations of quantities. These are calculated using five different index number formulas. I demonstrate a great degree of consistency between these index numbers and show that the calculated values are within one log-per cent for all index numbers, and within half a log-per cent for precision index numbers. The index number formulas used in the analysis are Laspeyres, Paasche, Fisher, <b>Edgeworth</b> and Montgomery-Vartia <b>indices.</b> The chief references used in this thesis are “The Making of Index Numbers” by Irving Fisher (1927), “From Binary Index Comparisons to Index Series” by Yrjö Vartia (1995) and “Relative Changes and Index Numbers” by Yrjö Vartia (1976) as well.
