5|$|Since 1972, BGH {{provides}} <b>ground-handling</b> {{services for}} all airports in Bangladesh; {{the company reported}} a profit of BDT4.5billion for the FY 2011–12. The wholly owned subsidiary BFCC {{was set up in}} 1989 to provide in-flight meals. It is one of Biman's profitable operations, supplying food to Saudia, Etihad, Malaysia Airlines, Thai Airways, Emirates, Dragon Air, China Southern Airlines and Regent Airways, along with casual orders from other airlines operating into Bangladesh. The BFCC consumes 90% of the eggs and chickens from the BPC, another profit-making subsidiary of Biman formed in 1976 and put into operation in November 1980 to rear poultry at farms in Dhaka. Bird flu was detected at one of the farms in March 2007, and many of the birds were culled. This was the first incident of bird flu in Bangladesh.|$|E
25|$|In 2003, it was {{proposed}} {{to set up}} a Myanmar-based airline for chartered international passenger and cargo flights, which was planned to be called Air Myanmar. What would have been a joint-venture between Myanma Airways and private investors was abandoned in 2005. Myanmar National Airlines provides <b>ground-handling</b> services for Other airline's charter,schedule and non schedule flight.|$|E
25|$|The {{aircraft}} is {{fitted with}} a retractable tricycle undercarriage with steerable nosewheels, allowing a fairly large crab angle during cross-wind landing. The reverse pitch control with which the aircraft is fitted allows the constant-speed mechanism to be manually overridden to reverse the blade pitch angle, thus providing excellent <b>ground-handling</b> characteristics, helping {{to slow down the}} plane to shorten the landing run. This control also allows the aircraft to back up on its own during taxiing.|$|E

It was {{originally}} {{transferred to the}} Norton Air Force Base (near San Bernardino, California) in 1950, still in a damaged state after its last emergency landing. When the base museum was closed and its collection dispersed, the second XF-85 prototype languished in an unrestored condition {{as part of the}} Tallmantz private collection in California, until being acquired by Offutt AFB. It is now refurbished and displayed on its <b>ground-handling</b> trestle, nestled under the wing of a B-36J bomber (serial number 52-2217).|$|E

The new addition increases DXB's throughput capacity to 1.6 million tons a year.|$|E
2500|$|AI {{produced}} a smaller airship, the Sentinel 1000, {{as part of}} the development programme. The 1000 was a half-linear-scale model of the 5000, having a modified Skyship 600 gondola but a larger (...) envelope and an empennage resembling the [...] "X" [...] form planned for the 5000, rather than the cruciform one of the 600. Other features included fly-by-light controls, an envelope material that eliminated the need for routine hangaring and a <b>ground-handling</b> technique that required a comparatively small crew of eight. However, the ship, which was assembled at WAI's Weeksville facility in North Carolina, did not fly until 26 June 1991, by which time AI had collapsed and Westinghouse had taken full control of the programme.|$|E
2500|$|The Piper PA-20 Pacer was {{originally}} {{designed as a}} tailwheel aircraft and thus had somewhat limited forward visibility {{on the ground and}} more demanding <b>ground-handling</b> characteristics. To help introduce more pilots to easier, safer flying, from February 1951, Piper introduced the PA-22 Tri-Pacer with a nosewheel instead of the tailwheel landing gear. Both the Pacer and the Tri-Pacer belong to a sub-group of Piper aircraft called [...] "Short Wing Pipers." [...] Additionally, the Tri-Pacer offered higher-powered engine options in the form of 150hp (112kW) and 160 HP (120kW) engines, whereas the largest engine available to the original Pacer had an output of 135hp (100kW). [...] At the time the tricycle undercarriage became a popular preference and 1953 saw the PA-22 Tri-Pacer outsell the Pacer by a ratio of six to one. Due to the geometry of the nosewheel installation it is sometimes called the [...] "Flying Milk Stool".|$|E
2500|$|The Cockle [...] was an {{all-metal}} aircraft {{apart from}} the fabric-covered flying surfaces. [...] The hull was a duralumin monocoque structure with a concave V-shaped planing bottom incorporating two steps, the main one near the centre of gravity. [...] These steps were external to the monocoque to prevent step damage leading to water leakage into the hull. [...] The top of the hull was rounded, with a single-seat open cockpit near the nose. [...] The wings had steel spars and were mounted {{on the top of}} the fuselage, with pairs of bracing struts to the chines. [...] The wings carried full-span ailerons which could be drooped together, flap-like, for landing. There were stabilising floats near the wingtips in trouser-like fairings. [...] The two engines were mounted on top of the wing at about mid-chord, the twin-bladed propellers being driven via long extension shafts to the leading edge. [...] Originally the Cockle had a shallow triangular fin and rudder, but this was later extended upwards to a curved and slightly pointed profile which more than doubled the area, to cope better with single-engine flying. A tube ran transversely across the hull just above the main step, into which the axle of a pair of <b>ground-handling</b> wheels could be inserted.|$|E
2500|$|The Ryan AQM-34V, an {{electronic}} countermeasures update of the AQM-34H leaflet-dropping RPV {{used in the}} conflict in Southeast Asia (and known as [...] "bullshit bombers"), was thoroughly tested by TAC in an exercise named [...] "Gallant Eagle", conducted at Eglin AFB, {{during the week of}} 30 October through 3 November 1978. M. E. [...] "Gene" [...] Juberg, Teledyne Ryan Aeronautical's ops manager for the exercise, [...] "summarized [...] the purpose and results of the show in a memorandum to the main plant after completion of the maneuvers. It reads, in part: 'This trip report covers the writer's observations of the 432nd TDG participation. [...] Their deployment team consisted of 134 personnel operating out of Hurlburt Field, four miles west of Fort Walton Beach. Gallant Eagle was a combined Air Force, Army, Navy, and Marine exercise. The 432nd's participation was to fly four EW sorties with AQM-34V vehicles on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. The squadron deployed from Davis-Monthan with three DC-130 launch planes with four drones uploaded on each, three CH-3 MARS recovery helicopters, a TPW-2 Ground Director and a minimum of <b>ground-handling</b> equipment and spares. Two additional DC-130 aircraft were flown in from Davis-Monthan with spares for the launch planes, and a third came in {{at the end of the}} exercise to transport the Ground Director back home. The EW mission for the exercise was to lay a chaff corridor at 3,000 feet MSL while heading toward the coastline. The two drones, flying two minutes apart in trail formation, were then climbed to 19,000 and 20,000 feet MSL respectively, where they took up an active jamming orbit. The drones were followed by an E6A [...] or EB-57 aircraft which also dispensed chaff and provided EW active jamming through the chaffed corridor. The operation clearly demonstrated TAC's philosophy of sending in the decoy drones first to protect the manned jammers and fighter planes to follow.' Gene Juberg's field report concluded, stating that all objectives of the meet were met with unqualified success from the performance of the AQM-34V. The 432nd Tactical Drone Squadron, under the command of Col. James Witzel, was recognized by top TAC generals and commended for a job well done." ...|$|E

50|$|Air Pegasus was an Indian {{regional}} airline {{headquartered in}} Bangalore and based at Kempegowda International Airport. The airline was {{a subsidiary of}} Decor Aviation, an aircraft <b>ground-handling</b> services company. It commenced operations on 12 April 2015 with its inaugural flight between Bangalore and Hubli. The airline suspended operations on 27 July 2016, facing financial difficulties. At that time, Air Pegasus was serving eight airports across South India with a hub at Kempegowda International Airport in Bangalore, using a fleet of three ATR 72-500 aircraft. Their flying licence was suspended by DGCA on 22 November 2016.|$|E
50|$|The Chadwick C-122 was a single-seat {{ultralight}} helicopter {{developed in}} the United States in the 1980s. It was a minimalist design consisting of a fibreglass shell enclosing a truss structure to which the engine, rotor mast, landing gear, and pilot's seat were attached. A wide variety of roles were envisaged for the aircraft, and therefore it was equipped with attachment points for spray bars, a cargo hook, external cargo racks, and even weapons for law enforcement work. The skid-type undercarriage could be quickly fitted with wheels for <b>ground-handling,</b> or floats for operations from water.|$|E
50|$|The Myrsky proved {{fast and}} {{manoeuvrable}} enough to dogfight the contemporary Soviet aircraft; {{it was the}} second fastest Finnish Air Force airplane after the Messerschmitt Bf 109G. Pilots liked the plane as it had good cockpit ergonomics and decent flight and ground handling properties. Its aerodynamic design was excellent, and was later used on the VL Pyörremyrsky fighter and the Valmet Vihuri trainer. Its wide undercarriage gave it decent <b>ground-handling</b> properties. Its main drawback was the construction method: the ersatz materials simply did not stand the harsh Finnish weather.|$|E
5000|$|The {{aircraft}} was very simple, being made from [...] "non-strategic" [...] materials (mainly wood and steel). To save weight, {{it was to}} use a jettison-able undercarriage (there was to be no landing), so a simple welded steel tube undercarriage {{was attached to the}} aircraft. This, however, was found to give unmanageable <b>ground-handling</b> characteristics, so a simple shock absorber was then incorporated. The cross section of the fuselage was circular and not elliptical as were most planes of this size and type; such a fuselage was easier to make.|$|E
