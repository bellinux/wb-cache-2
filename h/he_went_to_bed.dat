5|$|On Saturday night, Max Mayfield, {{director}} of the National Hurricane Center, did something he had done only once before. He called the governors of Alabama, Louisiana, and Mississippi to warn them {{of the severity of}} the coming storm. He issued a special warning to Mayor Ray Nagin, telling him that some levees in the greater New Orleans area could be overtopped. Later, Mr. Mayfield would tell Brian Williams with NBC Nightly News that <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed</b> that night believing he had done what he could. On Sunday, he made a video call to U.S. President George W. Bush at his farm in Crawford, Texas about the severity of the storm.|$|E

Green said that she had fallen asleep around eleven-thirty. At some point before falling asleep, she recalled, she had spoken to Farrar, who had phoned asking which member of the {{household}} had paged him.

5|$|Mansfield {{spent the}} {{remainder}} of his life at Kenwood House. Most of his time was spent maintaining the grounds. In the summer, he was visited by groups of barristers who informed him of the goings-on at court. On 1 August 1792 he was made Earl of Mansfield, in the County of Middlesex. On 10 March 1793, he complained of feeling sleepy, and although he recovered the next day, by 12 March, he was again complaining of a need for sleep. <b>He</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed</b> early and remained asleep until 18 March, when he finally died. His body was buried in the North Transept of Westminster Abbey. Mansfield left a large amount of money after his death, including land worth £26,000. He gave £2,000 to Francis Buller.|$|E

He then began to construct his coalition cabinet: before <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed</b> at 3 am on Saturday, 11 May, six hours after Chamberlain's original announcement, Churchill had established the composition of the new War Cabinet, including the heads of the Service Ministries.|$|E
500|$|LeHand's {{importance}} {{as an adviser}} and gatekeeper to FDR grew during the second term. Following Howe's death in 1936, she became the de facto White House chief of staff, and was seen {{as one of the}} most powerful people in the administration. She [...] met with the other members of the secretariat around FDR's bedside every morning, vetted his mail, provided a [...] "back door" [...] entrance to the Oval Office—which adjoined hers alone—and spent many evenings with the president in his upstairs study, as well as accompanying him on weekend cruises on the presidential yachts, the Sequoia and its successor, the Potomac. Because FDR could not be awakened after <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed</b> at night without LeHand's permission, she was the first person to learn by telephone that Hitler had invaded Poland in September 1939, setting off World War II. [...] Samuel I. Rosenman, a close FDR adviser and speechwriter, called her [...] "one of the most important people of the Roosevelt era." ...|$|E
500|$|Lionel Luthor {{is portrayed}} in the program by John Glover; Glover said he appreciates the [...] "clear canvas" [...] {{he had to work}} with when {{developing}} his portrayal of Lionel. In season one, Glover traveled from New York to Vancouver every week while filming his scenes because he was already committed to stage appearances in New York at the time. When portraying the character's struggle with terminal liver disease, Glover was inspired by a friend's battle with cancer; he said his friend was a [...] "cheerleader to people", who supported and boosted others when they were feeling bad. When Glover's friend learned he had cancer he fought hard to get over it, but when he learned that it was terminal <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed</b> and stopped eating until he died about ten days later. This helped Glover understand how someone powerful and full of life could commit suicide—which Lionel prepares to do when he learns his illness is terminal.|$|E

500|$|Walker {{had thought}} he was in mid-stream when he issued the order. In fact, he was about seven leagues (about [...] ) north of his proper course, and in the grasp of strong {{currents}} which steered his ships towards the northwest. [...] Propelled by an easterly wind, the fleet was gradually closing on the north-south shore near Île-aux-Oeufs. [...] When Captain Paddon reported to Walker that land had been sighted around 10:30 pm, presumably dead ahead, Walker assumed that the fleet was approaching the south shore, and ordered the fleet to wear, and bring-to on the other tack, before <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed.</b> [...] This manoeuvre put the fleet onto a more northerly heading. [...] Some minutes later, an army captain named Goddard roused Walker, claiming to see breakers ahead. [...] Walker dismissed the advice and the man, but Goddard returned, insisting that the admiral [...] "come upon deck myself, or we should certainly be lost".|$|E
2500|$|King's {{favorite}} singer was Frank Sinatra. In {{his autobiography}} {{he spoke about}} how he was a [...] "Sinatra nut" [...] and how <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed</b> every night listening to Sinatra's classic album In the Wee Small Hours. During the 1960s Sinatra had arranged for King to play at the main clubs in Las Vegas. He credited Sinatra for opening doors to black entertainers who were not given the chance to play in [...] "white-dominated" [...] venues.|$|E
2500|$|Fleming died {{suddenly}} on 7 August 1613 at Stoneham Park in Hampshire, having given to his servants and farm-labourers {{what was known}} in Hampshire as a [...] "hearing day." [...] After joining in the festivities, <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed,</b> apparently in sound health, but was taken suddenly ill, and died before morning. He was buried in St. Nicolas' Church, North Stoneham, where a stately monument records the numerous successes of his career. Known locally as the [...] "Floating Flemings", it is ornamented with recumbent whole length figures of Fleming in his robes, with his official insignia, and his wife, with ruff and hood, and the singular waist favoured by ladies of the Tudor era.

2500|$|To {{build his}} character, Day-Lewis {{started with the}} voice. Anderson sent him {{recordings}} from the late 19th century to 1927 {{and a copy of}} the 1948 film The Treasure of the Sierra Madre, including documentaries on its director, John Huston, an important influence on Anderson's film. According to Anderson, he was inspired by the fact that Sierra Madre is [...] "about greed and ambition and paranoia and looking at the worst parts of yourself". While writing the script, he would put the film on before <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed</b> at night. To research for the role, Day-Lewis read letters from laborers and studied photographs from the time period. He also read up on oil tycoon Edward Doheny, upon whom Sinclair's book is loosely based.|$|E
2500|$|In [...] "Confidence and Paranoia" [...] (1988), Lister {{believes}} {{that the only reason}} that Rimmer became a part of the love celibacy society was because he couldn't get a date, and he could never get a date because Rimmer's mum bought all of Rimmer's casual clothes. Rimmer denies this, pointing out <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed</b> with Yvonne McGruder, but Lister says she thought Rimmer was someone else due to her wonky vision from a concussion. Lister, {{with the help of a}} solid manifestation of Lister's confidence (played by Craig Ferguson), deduces where Kochanski's personality disc is hidden as well as a means of how the ship can power two holograms at once. Lister is still unable to go on a date with Kochanski, however, as the disc inside Kochanski's box has been swapped with one containing a duplicate of Rimmer.|$|E
2500|$|On April 13, Lincoln invited Stanton, Grant {{and their}} wives to join him at Ford's Theatre the next evening. Lincoln had invited Stanton {{to go with him}} to the theatre several times, invitations Stanton {{routinely}} rejected. Further, neither of Stanton or Grant's wives would go unless the other went. The Grants used a visit to their children in New Jersey as their excuse. Finally, Lincoln decided to go to the theatre with Major Henry Rathbone and his betrothed. Stanton retired home that night after visiting a bedridden Secretary Seward. <b>He</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed</b> at about 10 pm. Soon after, he heard Ellen yell from downstairs: [...] "Mr. Seward is murdered!" [...] Stanton rushed downstairs. Upon hearing that Lincoln, too, might be dead, Stanton grew intensely animated. He wanted to leave immediately. He was cautioned: [...] "You mustn't go out ... As I came up to the house I saw a man behind the tree-box, but he ran away, and I did not follow him." [...] Stanton paid little mind to the man; he found a taxi and went to Seward's home.|$|E
