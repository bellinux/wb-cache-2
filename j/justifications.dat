On a rather common view, which accounts for doxastic <b>justification</b> in terms of propositional <b>justification</b> plus the so-called ‘basing relation’, propositional <b>justification</b> is seen as the prior notion, and doxastic <b>justification</b> is explained in terms of it. According to the opposing view, the direction of explanation needs to be reversed, and doxastic <b>justification</b> should be seen as primary. I distinguish between two notions of priority, and I argue that they give different verdicts with respect to the issue of which notion of <b>justification</b> comes first. The lesson may be taken to be that propositional and doxastic <b>justification</b> are in a relation of intertwinement...|$|R

Moreover, the GRC scheme is also said to disadvantage opposition parties because it is more difficult for them to find enough candidates to contest GRCs.

5|$|Jeffrey Jowell proposes two <b>justifications</b> for {{limiting}} parliamentary sovereignty: {{legitimacy and}} the current hypothesis of constitutionalism. The argument from legitimacy highlights that Parliament's supremacy depends on the democratic and accountable nature of legislature; anything that undermines this status would invalidate {{the applicability of the}} doctrine. Jowell suggests that this view was expressly supported by Lord Hope and impliedly supported in other opinions that legislation limiting Parliament's accountability would be challenged by the judiciary. The argument based on the current hypothesis of constitutionalism reasons that no authority should be allowed to violate fundamental rights in a democratic society: they are essential features that cannot be removed, even by a supposedly sovereign Parliament. This view was also expressly endorsed in Jackson by Lord Hope, who regarded Parliament's sovereignty as subject to the rule of law.|$|E

40|$|The primary aim of {{this thesis}} is to present the crucial Pauline {{doctrine}} of <b>Justification</b> through Christ {{as it has been}} understood and expounded by St John Chrysostom, one of the greatest exegetes of Holy Scripture in the early Church. Chrysostom's Commentary on Paul’s Letter to the Romans is the primary source and the presentation of the most basic aspects of the doctrine of <b>justification</b> in it is the method. The short introduction, relating to Chrysostom's text (ch. l) is followed in turn by: the presuppositions of Paul's doctrine of <b>justification,</b> located in original death and pattern of creation, i. e. in humanity's fall into death through sin, and its link with Christ as God the Creator (ch. 2); the soteriological sense of <b>justification,</b> connected with Christ as man (new Adam) and giver of the <b>justification</b> by grace through faith as distinct from the <b>justification</b> in the law through works (ch. 3); <b>justification</b> as restoration of humanity in the knowledge of God through Christ; <b>justification</b> as an act of faith as distinct from the acts of the Law (ch. 5); <b>justification</b> as sacrifice involving Christ's redemptive sacrifice and the living sacrifice of the Christians (ch. 6); the verification of <b>justification</b> through the resurrection (ch. 7); <b>justification</b> as doxology, i. e. the worship of God by man in Christ (ch. 8); <b>justification</b> and the new morality of the life in the Spirit (ch. 9); <b>justification</b> as adoption of humanity by God in Christ (ch. 10); <b>justification</b> as punishment and recompense in Christ (ch. 11); <b>justification</b> as an indistructible grace and gift of God's love (ch. 12) and finally, the secular sense of <b>justification</b> (ch. 13). The rich doctrine emerging there from entails destruction of death, victory over sin, participation in God's life in and through Christ.

I argue that defeasibility independence is not a necessary condition for a priori <b>justification.</b> I argue that source independence is a necessary condition for a priori <b>justification.</b> A priori <b>justification</b> must have a non-experiential source.

Ian Walker, author of the most recent scholarly biography of Harold Godwinson, suggests that it was Robert, while in exile after the return of Godwin, who testified that King Edward had nominated Duke William to be Edward's heir. However, this view is contradicted by David Douglas, a historian and biographer of William the Conqueror, who believes that Robert merely relayed Edward's decision, probably while Robert {{was on his way to}} Rome to receive his pallium. Several medieval chroniclers, including the author of the Life of Saint Edward, felt that the blame for Edward and Godwin's conflict in 1051–1052 lay squarely with Robert; modern historians tend to see Robert as an ambitious man, with little political skill.|$|E

While the USSBS did not state that any single factor caused the surrender, during interrogations most Japanese wartime leaders nominated the prolonged air {{attacks on the}} home islands as {{the single most important}} factor which influenced their decision to end the war. In particular, Prime Minister Kantarō Suzuki stated that the combination of the conventional B-29 raids, Potsdam Declaration and atomic bombings gave the Government the opportunity to begin negotiations with the Allies. Emperor Hirohito cited damage from the attacks, inadequate preparations to resist invasion and the Soviet offensive as his <b>justifications</b> for authorizing the surrender. To achieve this, the American Twentieth Strategic Air Force, in concert with its Allies, dropped 160,800 tons of bombs on the Japanese home islands. Of this total, 147,000 tons of bombs were dropped by the B-29 bomber force. Around 90percent of the American tonnage fell in the last five months of the war. The financial cost of the campaign to the United States was $4 billion; this expenditure was much lower than the $30 billion spent on bomber operations in Europe, and a small proportion of the $330 billion the US Government spent on the war.|$|E

Failure to acknowledge and accept that conscientious judgements can be seriously mistaken, may only promote situations where one's conscience is manipulated by others to provide unwarranted <b>justifications</b> for non-virtuous and selfish acts; indeed, insofar as it is appealed to as glorifying ideological content, and an associated extreme level of devotion, without adequate constraint of external, altruistic, normative justification, conscience may be considered morally blind and dangerous both to the individual concerned and humanity as a whole. Langston argues that philosophers of virtue ethics have unnecessarily neglected conscience for, once conscience is trained so that the principles and rules it applies are those one would want all others to live by, its practise cultivates and sustains the virtues; indeed, amongst people in what each society considers to be the highest state of moral development there is little disagreement about how to act.Emmanuel Levinas viewed conscience as a revelatory encountering of resistance to our selfish powers, developing morality by calling into question our naive sense of freedom of will to use such powers arbitrarily, or with violence, this process being more severe the more rigorously the goal of our self was to obtain control.|$|E

Six people were initially charged in connection with the Rova's destruction in an Antananarivo court of law, but the official investigation concluded that the fire was an accident.

Widespread belief persists within and outside Madagascar that a deliberate arson was the cause. Rumoured <b>justifications</b> for arson at the Rova were numerous and remain unproven. The revelation that important financial archives had been destroyed early on the morning of the fire sparked rumours that corrupt government officials had lit the blaze to create a public distraction from their illicit activities. Other explanations have included popular dissatisfaction with the election of divisive mayor Guy Willy Razanamasy or a flare-up of long-standing tensions among coastal peoples resentful of Merina socio-political domination.
