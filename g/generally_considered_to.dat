The toothcomb of the colugos is <b>generally</b> <b>considered</b> <b>to</b> {{function as}} a toothcomb, but {{due to the lack}} of striations on the teeth and no documented observations of toothcomb use during oral grooming, its use seems to be limited to food procurement.|$|E
5|$|Gene {{expression}} in prokaryotes {{is influenced by}} an RNA-based system similar in some respects to RNAi. Here, RNA-encoding genes control mRNA abundance or translation by producing a complementary RNA that anneals to an mRNA. However these regulatory RNAs are not <b>generally</b> <b>considered</b> <b>to</b> be analogous to miRNAs because the dicer enzyme is not involved. It {{has been suggested that}} CRISPR interference systems in prokaryotes are analogous to eukaryotic RNA interference systems, although none of the protein components are orthologous.|$|E

During the first half century of statehood, it was considered a Democratic stronghold, being carried by the Republican Party in only two presidential elections (1920 and 1928).

The {{process by which the}} Delian League transformed into an Athenian empire is <b>generally</b> <b>considered</b> <b>to</b> have begun well before Pericles' time, as various allies in the league chose to pay tribute to Athens instead of manning ships for the league's fleet, but the transformation was speeded and brought to its conclusion by Pericles.|$|E
5|$|Renaissance is {{a concept}} {{formulated}} by cultural historian Jacob Burckhardt {{in the mid-nineteenth century}} to describe the intellectual and artistic movement that began in Italy in the fourteenth century and saw an attempt to revive the principles of the Greek and Roman classical worlds. It encompassed a rational and sceptical attitude, a return to ideas of original sources and proportion and balance in art. The major ideas of the Renaissance are <b>generally</b> <b>considered</b> <b>to</b> have reached Northern Europe much later, in the late fifteenth century. Scotland has been seen as part of a wider Northern Renaissance that is <b>generally</b> <b>considered</b> <b>to</b> have stretched into the early seventeenth century, when it was replaced by the grander styles of the Baroque. However, the association of Baroque styles with Catholicism in predominantly Protestant Scotland tended to result in this trend being overlooked and the period from about 1620 {{to the end of the}} seventeenth century is sometimes characterised as a late Renaissance.|$|E

This has led to its becoming virtually ubiquitous in the discography of concert violinists, even including those who were only active at the very dawn of recorded sound and of whom very little recorded music exists, such as Eugène Ysaÿe. Even so, it remains technically challenging and is <b>generally</b> <b>considered</b> <b>to</b> be as difficult as many other famous counterparts.|$|E
5|$|Accounts of snaring and {{destroying}} the beast are rare, {{as it is}} not <b>generally</b> <b>considered</b> <b>to</b> be a threat. In 1819 John MacCulloch, a noted geologist, described how inhabitants around the areas of Loch Awe and Loch Rannoch tried to capture a water bull by shackling a sheep to an oak tree as an enticement, but the tackle was not strong enough. Another story describes a farmer and his two sons hunting a water bull. The farmer's musket was filled with silver sixpence coins as the beast can only be killed with silver.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} there was a growing {{movement}} to attract native intelligentsia, educated at schools run by the Dutch colonial government, and convince them to view domestic films, which were <b>generally</b> <b>considered</b> <b>to</b> be of much lower quality than imported Hollywood productions. This was blamed, in part, on the dominance of theatrically trained actors and crew. As such, Ariffien invited Gani, at the time a medical doctor and a prominent member of the nationalist movement, to join the cast. Although some nationalists considered Gani's involvement in Asmara Moerni as besmirching the independence movement, Gani considered it necessary: he believed audiences needed to have higher opinions of domestic film productions.|$|E
