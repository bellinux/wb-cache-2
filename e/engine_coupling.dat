50|$|The {{idea behind}} the shock factor is that an {{explosion}} close to a ship generates a shock wave that can impart sudden vertical motions to a ship's hull and internal systems. Many of the internal mechanical systems (e.g. <b>engine</b> <b>coupling</b> to prop) require precise alignment in order to operate. These vibrations upset these critical alignments and render these systems inoperative. The vibrations can also destroy lighting and electrical components, such as relays.|$|E
40|$|PLuTO – Patent Language Translation Online – is a {{partially}} EU-funded commercialization project {{which specializes in}} the automatic retrieval and translation of patent documents. At {{the core of the}} PLuTO framework is a machine translation (MT) engine through which web-based translation services are offered. The fully integrated PLuTO architecture includes a translation <b>engine</b> <b>coupling</b> MT with translation memories (TM), and a patent search and retrieval engine. In this paper, we first describe the motivating factors behind the provision of such a service. Following this, we give an overview of the PLuTO framework as a whole, with particular emphasis on the MT components, and provide a real world use case scenario in which PLuTO MT services are exploited. ...|$|E
40|$|Understanding how organisms {{cope with}} global {{change is a}} major {{scientific}} challenge. The molecular pathways underlying rapid adaptive phenotypic responses to global change remain poorly understood. Here, we highlight the relevance of two environment-sensitive molecular elements: transposable elements (TEs) and epigenetic components (ECs). We first outline the sensitivity of these elements to global change stressors and review how they interact with each other. We then propose an integrative molecular <b>engine</b> <b>coupling</b> TEs and ECs and allowing organisms to fine-tune phenotypes in a real-time fashion, adjust the production of phenotypic and genetic variation, and produce heritable phenotypes with different levels of transmission fidelity. We finally discuss {{the implications of this}} molecular engine in the context of global change...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{compares the}} results of a techno-economic {{performance}} analysis of seven plants for energy production from biomass with the aim of identifying the most effective solution. Small (≤ 250 KWe) and micro (≤ 100 KWe) size plants were investigated: 50 kWe diesel internal combustion <b>engine</b> <b>coupled</b> with a gasifier and 35 kWe Stirling <b>engine</b> <b>coupled</b> with a gasifier with an overall efficiency of 41. 1 % and 87. 5 % respectively, two biomass cogenerators, one of 25 kWe and the other of 100 kWe, 250 kWe Otto internal combustion <b>engine</b> <b>coupled</b> with a gasifier and 250 kWe diesel internal combustion <b>engine</b> <b>coupled</b> with a gasifier and 238 kWe biomass ORC plant. The technical analysis provided calculations for specific biomass consumption, electricity generation, heat produced and overall system efficiency. The economic evaluation was carried on through a discounted cash flow analysis. Data were provided by literature, analysis of case study at Italian and European level, and directly by the manufacturers of cogeneration systems. The results showed that a combined heat and power (CHP) generator is the best solution because it is economically viable with a high NPV and a PBP of five years and also technically performing with a global efficiency of 78. 2 % and a low biomass consumption...|$|R
