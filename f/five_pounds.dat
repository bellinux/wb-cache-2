5|$|Men {{were to be}} enlisted {{into the}} Force by a {{specific}} county association {{and as part of}} a specific corps; if that corps contained multiple units, he was to be posted to one of his choosing. As with the Regular Army, men were not permitted to be transferred from one corps to another or to a regular unit without their consent. Periods of service were not to exceed four years, and could be extended for a further four years {{at the end of that}} period. If the Force was called out for permanent service when the time for a man's discharge came due, he could be required to prolong his service by up to twelve months. A member of the Force could buy his discharge before the end of his term by giving three months notice and paying a sum of up to <b>five</b> <b>pounds,</b> except in times of embodiment for service, and could be discharged for disobedience to orders or misconduct as judged by his commanding officer. First appointments to the lowest grade of officer in any Territorial Force unit were to be given to persons recommended by the association president, provided they fulfilled all the necessary qualifications.|$|E

25|$|The five guineas {{gold coin}} started out {{life as a}} five-pound coin before the {{fluctuating}} value of the guinea eventually settled at twenty-one shillings; therefore it is arguable that the <b>five</b> <b>pounds</b> piece issued after the Great Recoinage of 1816 is merely {{a continuation of the}} earlier value. However, the £5 coin tends to have a more modern 'feel' and so is normally considered separately.|$|E
25|$|After {{losing his}} job and {{discovering}} {{that he had a}} special aptitude for blindfold chess, Blackburne began giving blindfold and simultaneous exhibitions all over Britain, and for most of his career made most of his income from these exhibitions, including blindfold displays against up to twelve opponents simultaneously. He even travelled to Australia in 1885 to give exhibitions; on his arrival in Melbourne he was fined <b>five</b> <b>pounds</b> for assaulting a fellow passenger on the ship.|$|E

25|$|There {{are also}} {{commemorative}} issues of crowns. Before 1990, these had a face value of twenty-five pence (25p), {{equivalent to the}} five shilling crown used in pre-decimal Britain. However, in 1990 crowns were redenominated with a face value of <b>five</b> <b>pounds</b> (£5) as the previous value was considered not sufficient for such a high-status coin. The size and weight of the coin remained exactly the same. Decimal crowns are generally not found in circulation as their market value {{is likely to be}} higher than their face value, but they remain legal tender.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} years of television, the ABC had been using Lissajous figures as fillers {{in-between}} programs. A staff competition was conducted in 1963 to create a new logo for use on television, stationery, publications, microphone badges and ABC vehicles. Graphic designer, Bill Kennard, who had been experimenting with telerecording of the Cathode Ray Oscillograph displays, submitted a design in 1965 which was part of the waveform of an oscilloscope. The letters A-B-C were added to the wavelength design and it was adopted as the ABC's official logo. Mr Kennard was paid twenty <b>five</b> <b>pounds</b> for his design.|$|E

Miss Jummy tracked the leaders before taking the lead approaching the final furlong. She was immediately challenged by Argo Navis and the two fillies raced together throughout the final furlong with Miss Jummy prevailing by a neck over her old rival. The winning time of 3:20.5 was almost a second faster than that recorded by Ormonde, carrying <b>five</b> <b>pounds</b> less, in the St Leger two days earlier.|$|E

25|$|Sherine first {{proposed}} {{the campaign in}} June 2008 in a guardian.co.uk Comment is Free blog post, Atheists – gimme five in the Guardian. She expressed her frustration that the Christian organisation JesusSaid.org was allowed to use bus advertising to promote the web address of a website that said that all non-Christians would burn in hell for all eternity. Sherine called on atheists to counter this kind of evangelical advertising by donating <b>five</b> <b>pounds</b> towards a positive philosophical advert. Her idea was taken up by political blogger Jon Worth, {{who went on to}} set up a PledgeBank page. The PledgeBank page closed on 31 July 2008, having received 877 of the 4,679 pledges necessary for the original target of £23,400. This event attracted some limited comment in the mainstream media early in August. Sherine then wrote a follow-up Comment is free article, Dawkin 'bout a Revolution, detailing events since the original piece. In response, the British Humanist Association offered to lend the campaign its official support and undertook to administer all donations. Sherine then asked Richard Dawkins for a quote for the campaign, at which point he offered to match the first £5,500 raised.|$|E
25|$|Increasing {{nitrogen}} emission is {{a problem}} facing the delicate balance within the ecosystems that contain the Bay checkerspot in many areas. At Coyote Ridge the problem is well documented by conservation biologist Stuart Weiss. Faced with a declining population of Bay checkerspots at Coyote Ridge, Weiss searched for a cause. He found a link {{to a combination of}} pollution from the freeway below the ridge and, again, a cutback in cattle grazing locally. Weiss documented how nitrogen oxide emissions from cars enriched the nutrient-poor serpentine soil. This {{is a prime example of}} the nitrogen effect explained above. Aside from helping decrease nitrogen, the cattle also help to control invasive grasses by eating them. Any question about whether nitrogen emissions from cars traversing U.S. Route 101, 110,000 vehicles daily, is significant evaporates when faced with monitoring statistics from Weiss. His monitoring equipment has confirmed that 15 to 20 pounds of nitrogen per acre is deposited on Coyote Ridge annually. Some of the particles stick to the plant and ground and are washed into the soil, and others are directly absorbed by the plants themselves. By contrast, pollution from power plants and vehicles drops only about four to <b>five</b> <b>pounds</b> of nitrogen per acre per year on the Jasper Ridge preserve.|$|E
25|$|Through his {{prolonged}} stay in India House, however, Acharya {{gradually became}} {{deeply involved in}} its activities. Scotland Yard had at one point been able to infiltrate the organisation with an Indian student {{by the name of}} Kritikar, who had arrived at the organisation with a story similar to that of Acharya, and had for some time been able to report to Scotland Yard about its activities before he was uncovered and forced by Savarkar to confess at gunpoint. After this, Kirtikar's reports are believed to have been regularly screened by Savarkar before they were passed on to Scotland Yard. For some time, Acharya himself had been under suspicion of being a Scotland Yard mole before he was able to convince his fellow residents of his integrity and commitment to the nationalist cause. It is believed that Acharya was instructed by V.V.S. Iyer and V.D. Savarkar to set himself up as an informer to Scotland Yard, which they reasoned would allow them to carefully feed information to the police and also help them provide a corroboration to the version of reports that were being sent by Kritikar. For his reports, Acharya took <b>five</b> <b>pounds</b> (later doubled) which also eased from his fellow house-mates the financial strain of supporting him.|$|E

500|$|The {{range of}} G.caroliniana {{includes}} Oklahoma to the Carolinas and {{north to the}} Great Lakes. Erich Benedix reported the fungus in Thuringia and Austria, where he claimed it had previously often been misidentified with young forms of Gyromitra infula. A more recent revision disputes those claims, saying [...] "Reports from Europe are unsubstantiated and are due to confusion with G.fastigiata and G.gigas".

500|$|Grissom stated he {{had done}} nothing to cause the hatch to blow. Robert F. Thompson, Director of Mercury Operations, was {{dispatched}} to the [...] by Space Task Group Director Robert Gilruth and spoke with Grissom upon his arrival on the aircraft carrier. Grissom explained that he had gotten ahead in the mission timeline and had removed the detonator cap, and also pulled the safety pin. Once the pin was removed, the trigger was no longer held in place and could have inadvertently fired {{as a result of}} ocean wave action, bobbing as a result of helicopter rotor wash, or other activity. NASA officials concluded Grissom had not necessarily initiated the firing of the explosive hatch, which would have required pressing a plunger that required <b>five</b> <b>pounds</b> of force to depress.|$|E
500|$|In 1956, Julia bought John {{his first}} guitar. The {{instrument}} was an inexpensive Gallotone Champion acoustic {{for which she}} [...] "lent" [...] her son <b>five</b> <b>pounds</b> and ten shillings {{on the condition that}} the guitar be delivered to her own house and not Mimi's, knowing well that her sister was not supportive of her son's musical aspirations. Mimi was sceptical of his claim that he would be famous one day, and she hoped that he would grow bored with music, often telling him, [...] "The guitar's all very well, John, but you'll never make a living out of it". On 15 July 1958 (when Lennon was 17 years old) his mother was struck and killed by a car while she was walking home after visiting the Smiths' house.|$|E
