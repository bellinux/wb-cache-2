5|$|Around 1900, {{there were}} six {{stopping}} trains an hour between Willesden Green and Baker Street. One of these came from Rickmansworth and another from Harrow, the rest started at Willesden Green. There was also a train every two hours from Verney Junction, which stopped at all stations to Harrow, then Willesden Green and Baker Street. The timetable was arranged so that the <b>fast</b> <b>train</b> would leave Willesden Green just before a stopping service and arrived at Baker Street just behind the previous service.|$|E

25|$|Initial {{services}} were poor: only six services per day were laid on, with one <b>fast</b> <b>train</b> in each direction. Only two trains each way ran on Sundays. The {{entire length of}} the line was , making for a journey time of 55 minutes (assuming an all-stations service).|$|E

One of the victim later succumbed to his death due to severe injuries.|$|E
25|$|Where {{the signals}} and points (UK term) or rail {{switches}} (US) are power-operated, {{it can be}} worthwhile to signal each line in both directions, so that the double line becomes a pair of single lines. This allows trains to use one track where the other track is out of service due to track maintenance work, or a train failure, or for a <b>fast</b> <b>train</b> to overtake a slow train.|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless, {{increases}} in traffic from January 1874 led to general service improvements, with notably {{the introduction of}} a 09:00 service to London from Tunbridge Wells. From July 1877 another London service was introduced, a <b>fast</b> <b>train</b> leaving Tunbridge Wells at 10:00 to arrive at London Victoria at 11:30, with stops at Groombridge and Withyham (for first class passengers), and then at Forest Row, East Grinstead and Three Bridges.|$|E

25|$|Herrmann had a {{remarkable}} Mille Miglia race in 1954, when {{the gates of}} a railroad crossing were lowered in the last moment before the <b>fast</b> <b>train</b> to Rome passed. Driving a very low Porsche 550 Spyder, Herrmann decided {{it was too late}} for a brake attempt anyway, knocked on the back of the helmet of his navigator Herbert Linge to make him duck, and they barely passed below the gates and before the train, to the surprise of the spectators.|$|E
25|$|In 1972 Paul Wild invented Interscan, a {{standard}} microwave landing system. From 1978 to 1985 {{he was chairman}} of the CSIRO, during which time he expanded the organisation's scope and directed its restructuring. He retired from the CSIRO to lead (from 1986) the Very <b>Fast</b> <b>Train</b> Joint Venture, a private sector project that sought to build a high-speed railway between Australia's two most populous cities. Lack of support from government brought it to an end in 1991. In his later years he worked on gravitational theory.|$|E
25|$|Since 2006, Indonesian {{authorities}} have {{expressed an interest}} in high-speed rail for the densely populated island of Java, probably linking the cities of Jakarta, Bandung, and Surabaya. Since 2008, government with Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) and Japan Transportation Consultant has done pre-Feasibility study. The Jakarta-Surabaya 685 kilometers <b>fast</b> <b>train</b> will connect both cities in 2 hours 53 minutes with maximum speed 300 kilometers/hour and average speed 250 kilometers/hours. The construction project will need 14.3 billion, exclude land acquisitions and detail engineering design, so the total cost predicted was $20 billion.|$|E

25|$|The Secretariat of Communications and Transport of Mexico {{proposed}} a high-speed rail link that would transport passengers from Mexico City to Guadalajara, Jalisco, with {{stops in the}} cities of Querétaro, Guanajuato, Leon and Irapuato; and a connected line running from {{the port city of}} Manzanillo to Aguascalientes. The train which would travel at 300km/h allows passengers to travel from Mexico City to Guadalajara in just 2hours at an affordable price (the same trip by road would last 7hours). The network would also connect the network to Monterrey, Chilpancingo, Cuernavaca, Toluca, Puebla, Tijuana, Hermosillo, Cordoba, Veracruz, Oaxaca, Colima, Zacatecas, Torreon, Chihuahua, Puebla, San Luis Potosi, Mexicali Saltillo and Acapulco by 2015. The whole project was projected to cost 240billion pesos, or about 25billion dollars. Mexican billionaire Carlos Helú expressed an interest in investing in high-speed rail. Most recently the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico has highlighted {{as one of the most}} probable areas for the development of high-speed rail in Latin America with the Transpeninsular <b>Fast</b> <b>Train</b> for bidding in September 2011.|$|E

50|$|The fast-growing {{popularity}} of the trains has, however, created problems with capacity. The time taken for the X2000 trains are longer in 2008 than in 2000. For Stockholm-Malmö the <b>fastest</b> <b>train</b> takes 21 minutes more time than in 2000. It is the congestion on the railways that impedes the <b>fast</b> <b>trains,</b> especially the prioritized fastest connections. The railways are used by <b>fast</b> X2000 <b>trains,</b> slower passenger trains, and much slower freight trains.|$|R
2500|$|Wild {{retired from}} CSIRO in October 1985, but CSIRO {{continued}} to support pre-feasibility studies until October 1988. By September 1986 {{he had brought}} together an unincorporated joint venture of TNT, Elders IXL and Kumagai Gumi. In August 1987, after delay caused by uncertainties surrounding a potential takeover of their company, the BHP joined as the fourth, and subsequently foremost, partner.

It {{is worth noting that}} the SYD-MEL air traffic corridor is one of the busiest in the world, HSR would allow for journey times city center to city center quicker than flights plus associated procedures and travel. In September 2010, Infrastructure Partnership Australia (IPA) and AECOM proposed an east coast very <b>fast</b> <b>train</b> corridor from the Sunshine Coast and Brisbane (Queensland) and onto Sydney (N.S.W), Canberra (A.C.T.) and through to Melbourne (Victoria).|$|E
