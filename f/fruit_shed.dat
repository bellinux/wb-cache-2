Calden pods are a highly valuable fodder supplement for livestock but its production is highly variable. Our objective was to analyze and model the temporal pattern in inter-annual variability of Calden pod production. Our key hypothesis is that weather conditions are the main determinant of the pod masting behavior. Tree size and climatic variables were evaluated as explanatory covariates using a zero-inflated log-normal modelling approach. The proposed final model structure incorporated 25 parameters, including four variance components, two intercepts for both the logistic and the log-normal parts of the model, and nineteen parameters associated with fixed effects. Climate had a strong influence on the flowering-fruiting Calden process and on the inter-annual variability of the final pod production at the tree level.

Phenological observations were carried out on the plants growing on alluvial soil developed from light loam in Zakrz 6 w near Tarnobrzeg. It was proved that phenological development of Canada thistle, during broad-bean vegetation, depended on course of weather conditions and method of crop care. Emergence of the weed occurred earlier than broad-bean plants during warm and rather dry seasons. In every vegetation period, emergence and early vegetation stage (to 4 leaves seedling) of Canada thistle lasted about 3 months, until broad-bean got full pod setting. During wet and cold season (in 2001) the weed emerged also early under herbicide (Afalon 1, 5 kg ha- 1) condition.

40|$|Seed {{shattering}} (or pod dehiscence, or <b>fruit</b> <b>shedding)</b> {{is essential}} for the propagation of their offspring in wild plants but is a major cause of yield loss in crops. In the dicot model species, Arabidopsis thaliana, pod dehiscence necessitates a development of the abscission zones along the pod valve margins. In monocots, such as cereals, an abscission layer in the pedicle is required for the seed shattering process. In the past decade, great advances have been made in characterizing the genetic contributors that are involved in the complex regulatory network in the establishment of abscission cell identity. We summarize the recent burgeoning progress in the field of genetic regulation of pod dehiscence and <b>fruit</b> <b>shedding,</b> focusing mainly on the model species Arabidopsis thaliana with its close relatives and the fleshy fruit species tomato, as well as the genetic basis responsible for the parallel loss of seed shattering in domesticated crops. This review shows how these individual genes are co-opted in the developmental process of the tissues that guarantee seed shattering. Research into the genetic mechanism underlying seed shattering provides a premier prerequisite for the future breeding program for harvest in crops...|$|R

40|$|Yields of Washington Navel orange [Citrus sinensis (L.) Osbeck] under Arizona desert {{conditions}} are low, due mostly {{to a low}} number of harvested fruit and secondly to small sized fruits. To determine at which development stage yield reduction occurred, flowering branches were tagged at mid-bloom and the leaves and flowers were counted. The percent flowers shed at certain times was then recorded. In addition, 27 years yield data for the Arizona-California and Central California production regions were examined in relation to temperature and relative humidity to identify factors causing low yields in the desert climate. It was found that a low number of fruit was due to a low percentage fruit set, while fruit shedding during June drop contributed somewhat less to {{reducing the number of}} harvested fruits. A lower percentage of fruits were lost from Arizona Navel orange trees during and after June drop than reported for trees in Florida and California. This resulted in a higher percentage of initial flowers becoming mature fruit, even though there were fewer harvested fruits per tree in Arizona. It was concluded that Navel orange trees growing in Arizona have relatively fewer flowering branches. A correlation between yields and temperatures for 27 years showed that mean and maximum temperatures during the period from June prior to flowering through June after flowering had a highly significant, adverse effect on yields of Arizona grown trees, but not on yields of California grown trees. Relative humidity had no observable effect on yield. In addition, low yields of Navel orange trees in Arizona was disassociated with soil salinity. Low leaf to flower ratios (L/F) had a significant effect on fruit set only if L/F was 1. 0 or less. However, the effects of L/F were insignificant to the number of harvested fruits. Foliar applications of potassium nitrate (KNO₃) for two successive years significantly increased yield. Gibberellic acid (GA₃) did not increase fruit set and harvested yields.

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references (leaves 45 - 51). Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Transgenic cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) cultivars expressing herbicide tolerance to topical applications of herbicides are commercially available. It has been documented that under certain conditions, applications of Roundup Ultra? (glyphosate) to Roundup Ready[] (RR) cotton can lead to <b>fruit</b> <b>shed</b> and possible yield reductions. To assess these problems with RR cotton, growth chamber and field studies were conducted at the Texas A&M Agricultural Experiment Station using glyphosate-tolerant cotton, cv. 'DPL 5690 RR'. For the laboratory study, glyphosate treatments consisted of 0, 0. 56, 1. 12, and 2. 24 a. i. kg ha?? sprayed with a hand-boom to all exposed foliage at the 11 - to 13 -leaf stage. Immediately following this application, ??C-glyphosate was applied using a microsyringe to the three uppermost fully expanded leaves at 0, 37, 74, and 148 kBq per leaf for the 0, 0. 56, 1. 12, and 2. 24 a. i. kg ha?? treatments, respectively. As rates of topically applied glyphosate increased, the amount of glyphosate translocated to bolls increased, with the 2. 24 a. i. kg ha?? rate causing more abscission than all other rates. The critical concentration promoting boll abscission was estimated as 126. 4 [u]g g?? of dried boll, which was achieved only with a non-labeled rate of 2. 24 a. i. kg ha??. Fruit number was reduced throughout the plant rather than only on the lower portion of the plant. These data suggest that translocated glyphosate to the bolls was the cause for boll abscission because of the strong relationship between the concentration of glyphosate found in abscised bolls and fruit abscission levels (r?= 0. 99). Field studies were conducted to determine if application time and method affected fruit retention. Treatments consisted of applying 1. 12 a. i. kg ha?? either postdirected, non-labeled postdirected (25 % foliage coverage), or topical at the 8 [th]? or 18 [th]?leaf stage after an initial topical application at the 4 [th]?leaf stage. Both non-labeled postdirected and topical applications of glyphosate caused yield loss. Glyphosate appeared to affect the cotton plant below and above the application zone suggesting both basipetal and acropetal translocation. Producers may need to prevent glyphosate contact with both cotton stems and leaves when applying glyphosate after the 4 [th]?leaf stage to prevent possible yield losses...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Cell {{separation}} {{that occurs}} during fleshy fruit abscission and dry fruit dehiscence facilitates seed dispersal, {{the final stage}} of plant reproductive development. While our understanding of the evolutionary context of cell separation is limited mainly to the eudicot model systems tomato and Arabidopsis, less is known about the mechanisms underlying fruit abscission in crop species, monocots in particular. The polygalacturonase (PG) multigene family encodes enzymes involved in the depolymerisation of pectin homogalacturonan within the primary cell wall and middle lamella. PG activity is commonly found in the separation layers during organ abscission and dehiscence, however, little is known about how this gene family has diverged since the separation of monocot and eudicots and the consequence of this divergence on the abscission process. Results The objective of the current study was to identify PGs responsible for the high activity previously observed in the abscission zone (AZ) during <b>fruit</b> <b>shedding</b> of the tropical monocot oil palm, and to analyze PG gene expression during oil palm fruit ripening and abscission. We identified 14 transcripts that encode PGs, all of which are expressed in the base of the oil palm fruit. The accumulation of five PG transcripts increase, four decrease and five do not change during ethylene treatments that induce cell separation. One PG transcript (EgPG 4) is the most highly induced in the fruit base, with a 700 – 5000 fold increase during the ethylene treatment. In situ hybridization experiments indicate that the EgPG 4 transcript increases preferentially in the AZ cell layers in the base of the fruit in response to ethylene prior to cell separation. Conclusions The expression pattern of EgPG 4 is consistent with the temporal and spatial requirements for cell separation to occur during oil palm <b>fruit</b> <b>shedding.</b> The sequence diversity of PGs and the complexity of their expression in the oil palm fruit tissues contrast with data from tomato, suggesting functional divergence underlying the ripening and abscission processes has occurred between these two fruit species. Furthermore, phylogenetic analysis of EgPG 4 with PGs from other species suggests some conservation, but also diversification has occurred between monocots and eudicots, in particular between dry and fleshy fruit species. </p...|$|R

40|$|Fruitlet abscission during fruit {{development}} {{is due to}} the activation of pre-differentiated abscission zones (AZs) located between twig and pedicel, and/or pedicel and pericarp. Major advances on biochemical and molecular aspects are related to β- 1, 4 -endoglucanase (EG) and polygalacturonase (PG), two cell hydrolases involved in the cell wall disassemblement responsible for <b>fruit</b> <b>shedding.</b> AZ activation is accompanied by an increase in activity and transcript accumulation of one or both enzymes. Expression of PG genes specifically related to abscission has been found in tomato flower AZ. In peach, an EG gene highly expressed in leaf and fruitlet AZs has been isolated. AZ activation is preceded by an induction of ethylene biosynthesis, paralleled by a stimulation of ACO activity and transcript accumulation. Ethylene, besides a dramatic stimulation of PG and EG, up or down regulates several other abscission related genes. The specific expression of genes encoding for ethylene receptors in the AZ would support the hypothesis that fruitlet AZ specificity may depend on the ability of this region to sense ethylene...|$|R
40|$|Has the {{introduction}} of Bt genes into the cotton plant affected its c pa ity for compensation after insect damage? This question is relevant for three reasons. First, and most obviously, Bt cottons remain vulnerable to non-lepidopteran pests, including thrips and mirids.

Third, under some (yet undefined) environmental conditions, Bt efficacy can be low even in young crops, {{and we have seen}} <b>fruit</b> <b>shedding</b> in young commercial Bt crops that has been attributed to Helicoverpa damage.

Tolerance of desiccation to 10 % moisture content was first detected at 70 DAF and was maximal by 84 DAF.
