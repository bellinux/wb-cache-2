5|$|It is {{very obvious}} to me that you must remove Sir George Prevost. I see he has gone to war about trifles with the general {{officers}} I sent him, which are certainly the best of their rank in the army; and his subsequent failure and distresses will be aggravated by that circumstance; and will probably with the usual <b>fairness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> public be attributed to it.|$|E

5|$|A {{young girl}} was found raped and murdered, and Max Stuart, an Aborigine, {{was convicted and}} sentenced to be {{executed}} only a month later, {{on the basis of a}} confession gained during interrogation, although he had protested his innocence in pidgin English. Stuart's lawyer claimed that the confession was forced, and appeals to the Supreme and High Courts were dismissed. A linguist who investigated the case thought that the style of English in the confession was inconsistent with Stuart's background and speech. This aroused disquiet and objections against the <b>fairness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trial among an increasing number of legal academics and judges, and The News brought much attention to Stuart's plight with an aggressive, tabloid-style campaign. Soon, the case attracted international attention, some on the assumption that the legal system was racist. The former High Court Justice Sir John Latham also spoke out.|$|E

5|$|Amid loud outcry, Playford {{started a}} Royal Commission {{to review the}} case. However, two of the Commissioners appointed, Chief Justice Mellis Napier and Justice Geoffrey Reed, had already been involved, Napier as {{presiding}} judge in the Full Court appeal and Reed as the trial judge. This provoked worldwide controversy with claims of bias {{from the likes of}} the President of the Indian Bar Council, the esteemed British judge Norman Birkett, the leader of the United Kingdom Liberal Party Jo Grimond and former British Prime Minister Clement Attlee. Years later, Playford admitted that he erred in his appointments of Reed and Napier and that it could have shaken public confidence on the <b>fairness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hearing.|$|E
5|$|In a 5–4 opinion {{written by}} Justice Harry Blackmun, the Supreme Court of the United States vacated the Appellate Division's ruling, holding that states seeking to sever parental rights irrevocably must show at least {{clear and convincing}} {{evidence}} of neglect. Justice William Rehnquist, joined by three others, dissented, {{on the grounds that}} the majority's focus on a single aspect of the law disregarded the <b>fairness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> scheme as a whole. The ruling has since been criticized for its intrusion into state affairs. Because of the ruling, all states previously using the fair preponderance standard changed to the clear and convincing standard, but California has since abandoned the clear and convincing standard and returned to the fair preponderance standard.|$|E

40|$|It {{is widely}} agreed that exams must be fair; yet what this exactly means {{is not made}} clear. One may mean <b>fairness</b> <b>of</b> treatment, but this merely propagates <b>the</b> <b>fairness</b> or {{unfairness}} <b>of</b> pre-existing rules. <b>Fairness</b> <b>of</b> opportunity on <b>the</b> other hand necessarily leads to identical grades for everyone, which clearly makes it inapplicable. Neither view is helpful to make decisions on competing claims: <b>fairness</b> <b>of</b> treatment ignores <b>the</b> problem and <b>fairness</b> <b>of</b> opportunity holds all claims to be equally valid. To escape this deadlock one needs an external criterion to replace fairness viewed as student-student comparison.

40|$|Slowdown is used {{to measure}} <b>the</b> <b>fairness</b> degree <b>of</b> a {{scheduling}} algorithm in existing work.

The new scheduling algorithm is called MPQ-LP which compromises both <b>the</b> <b>fairness</b> <b>of</b> PS and <b>the</b> highest performance <b>of</b> SRPT.

30|$|The {{results for}} the between and within {{components}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Theil Index are particularly interesting. When they are both included in the regressions, higher between-group inequality – a measure of inequality of opportunity – is associated with lower life satisfaction and perception <b>of</b> <b>fairness</b> in <b>the</b> society. And higher within-group inequality –the component of inequality that {{can be attributed to}} unobserved effort or luck – is also associated with lower life satisfaction, but higher perception <b>of</b> <b>fairness.</b> When <b>the</b> between and within components of Theil are added one at a time in the regressions, the former has significant and negative correlation with life satisfaction and perception <b>of</b> <b>fairness,</b> while <b>the</b> latter is correlated with only life satisfaction. Moreover, <b>the</b> between component <b>of</b> Theil and <b>the</b> D-Indices have consistently better correlation with perception <b>of</b> <b>fairness</b> than Gini <b>of</b> income.|$|R

25|$|Regulated {{games are}} overseen by referees or marshals, who patrol {{the course to}} ensure {{enforcement}} of the rules {{and the safety of}} the players. If a player is marked with paint, they will call him out, but competitors may also be expected to follow the honor code; a broken ball means elimination. Field operators may specify variations to this rule, such as requiring a tag to certain body locations only – such as the head and torso only. There are game rules that can be enforced depending on the venue, to ensure safety, balance the <b>fairness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> game or eliminate cheating.|$|E
25|$|The {{election}} campaign was overshadowed by allegations of planned electoral fraud, irregularities and the controversial involvement of President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan {{in the electoral}} process. Numerous politically motivated acts of violence and vandalism targeted party activists, candidates, vehicles and campaign offices. Prospects of electoral fraud was particularly significant during the election, due to the extensive fraud allegations made during the 2014 local elections {{and the fact that}} opinion polls suggested that the governing AKP may lose its parliamentary majority. Various irregularities throughout the campaign, {{such as the use of}} state funds by AKP politicians for campaigning, media bias, forced participation for the government's electoral rallies, incorrect voter data and the use of bogus opinion polls also raised concerns about the <b>fairness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> election.|$|E

25|$|If an adjudicator has a pecuniary or {{monetary}} {{interest in}} the matter {{he or she is}} presiding over, no matter how small it is, he or she is automatically disqualified from making the decision. The decision, if made, may be set aside. Thus, in Dimes v. Grand Junction Canal Proprietors (1852), the House of Lords held that the Lord Chancellor, who was a shareholder of one of the companies that was a party to certain legal proceedings he was presiding over, was disqualified from hearing the case. His ruling had to be annulled. This was not because there was a real possibility of bias, but because the situation created a possibility that a reasonable person might suspect the existence of bias, which would taint the <b>fairness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> proceedings.|$|E

In December 2005, as the trials began, it was reported that tensions were building between the Bali Nine drug mules and Sukumaran and Chan. Several days later, lawyers acting for some members of the Bali Nine initially sought the support of the Director of Public Prosecutions to intervene and lay charges for conspiracy to import drugs, so that the nine could be extradited and charged under Australian law. However, the judges hearing the trial matters in Bali called for Australia not to intervene in Indonesia's right to impose capital punishment, with Australian lawyers counter-claiming that the <b>fairness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trial was in jeopardy.|$|E
25|$|Hamdeen Sabahi, {{a former}} presidential {{candidate}} in the 2012 presidential election, officially announced his presidential bid on 8 February 2014.

The pro-Sabahi Revolution's Candidate campaign has also expressed reservations {{about the nature of}} the presidential elections law, suggesting that the provision establishing inviolability for the decisions of the Supreme Electoral Committee raises doubts about the integrity of the election process and could potentially force a reassessment of the Sabahi candidacy. On 14 March, Hamdeen Sabahi's presidential campaign announced that Sabahi has decided to continue his candidacy in the presidential election, despite the perceived unconstitutionality of the presidential elections law. Sabahi has taken the medical tests needed to run for presidential office. Sabahi acquired 31,555 endorsements.|$|E
