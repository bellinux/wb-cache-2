500|$|Kennedy's wife Ethel {{stood outside}} the crush {{of people at the}} scene, seeking help. She was soon led to her husband and knelt beside him. He turned his head and seemed to {{recognize}} her. Smith promptly appeared on television and calmly asked for a doctor. Friend and journalist Pete Hamill recalled that Kennedy, as he lay dying, had [...] "a kind of sweet accepting smile on his <b>face,</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> he knew it would all end this way". After several minutes, medical attendants arrived and lifted Kennedy onto a stretcher, prompting him to whisper, [...] "Don't lift me..." [...] which were to become his last words. He lost consciousness shortly thereafter. Kennedy was taken a mile away to Central Receiving Hospital, where he arrived near death. One doctor slapped his face, calling, [...] "Bob, Bob", while another doctor manually massaged Kennedy's heart. After obtaining a good heartbeat, doctors handed a stethoscope to Ethel so she could hear her husband's heart beating, much to her relief.|$|E
2500|$|At {{dawn of the}} day the {{operation}} was to take place , Dick Aldrich called : Gertrude had become comatose; would I please come to the hospital at once? [...] I found her surrounded by interns frantically pumping intravenous fluids and stimulants into her. [...] As I bent over her, she opened her eyes for a second or two, looked up at me, and made a <b>face</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> to say, [...] "What are you doing here?" ...|$|E

2500|$|Upon its {{original}} Swedish release, The Seventh Seal {{was met with}} a somewhat divided critical response; its cinematography was widely praised, while [...] "Bergman the scriptwriter [...] lambasted." [...] Swedish journalist and critic Nils Beyer, writing for Morgon-tidningen, compared it to Carl Theodor Dreyer's The Passion of Joan of Arc and Day of Wrath. While finding Dreyer's films to be superior, he still noted that [...] "it isn't just any director that you feel like comparing to the old Danish master." [...] He also praised the usage of the cast, in particular Max von Sydow whose character he described as [...] "a pale, serious Don Quixote character with a <b>face</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> sculpted in wood", and [...] "Bibi Andersson, who appears as if painted in faded watercolours but still can emit small delicious glimpses of female warmth." [...] Hanserik Hjert√©n for Arbetaren started his review by praising the cinematography but soon went on to describe the film as [...] "a horror film for children" [...] and said that beyond the superficial, it is mostly reminiscent of Bergman's [...] "sophomoric films from the 40s." ...|$|E
2500|$|Quranic and hadith traditions such as Sahih Bukhari {{as well as}} tafsir {{have given}} an oral {{depiction}} of what Jesus looked like, although some accounts do not match, such as Jesus being both curly haired and straight-haired. The hadith refer to Muhammad's account of the Night Journey, when {{he is supposed to}} have been taken up to heaven by the angel Gabriel (Jibra'il), where he saw Jesus and other prophets. Most versions of this say that [...] "Jesus had curly hair and a reddish complexion". Others say his face was flushed as if he just had a bath ("a reddish man with many freckles on his <b>face</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> he had just come from a bath"). In another account from Bukhari Jesus is seen in a dream near the Kaaba, as [...] "a man of a wheatish complexion with straight hair. I asked who it was. They said: This is the Messiah, son of Mary". However, other narrations give variations in the color. Salim ibn Abd-Allah reports from his father Abdullah ibn Umar that the prophet [...] "did not say that Jesus was of red complexion", rather he was [...] "a man of brown complexion and lank hair". In contrast Abd Allah ibn Abbas says that Jesus was of [...] "moderate complexion inclined to the red and white colors and of lank hair." ...|$|E
2500|$|This era {{ended with}} the 1962 Borough Park Tobacco {{warehouse}} robbery in Brooklyn. Two detectives were killed, the first double homicide of NYPD officers in 30 years led to a massive manhunt. One of the accused robbers, Tony Dellernia, surrendered in Chicago. Upon his extradition to New York, he was perp-walked. Some photographers complained to the police at the Brooklyn precinct house where he was being held that they had missed it. Albert Seedman, a high-ranking detective, not only restaged it for reporters three hours after the original walk, he held up Dellernia's head {{so it would be}} visible. The defendant's pained expression, next to Seedman with a cigar stub in his mouth, [...] "stretching the suspect's <b>face</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> it were pizza dough", as the New York Times put it years later, was captured in the photographs, leading to public outrage. Seedman, who later became the department's chief detective, knew he would regret it, and was later reprimanded. Another, Jerry Rosenberg, also surrendered. [...] "He is the killer," [...] Ray Martin, the detective in charge, told the press during the perp walk, [...] "and he is going to burn for it." [...] After his conviction, Rosenberg sued the city and Martin for that and alleged police brutality during his arrest. Representing himself, the beginning of his career as a jailhouse lawyer, Rosenberg won a small verdict against Martin in district court that was later reversed on appeal.|$|E

60|$|Brisbane, up-borne by Lawson {{and a tall}} young stranger, first appeared, {{followed}} by a dozen men, who walked two and two with bared heads and serious <b>faces,</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> following a hearse.

60|$|As {{they went}} out both men turned to look their last on the martyrs. The death knell which had rung in the ears of the Christians, was to them the voice of God.
