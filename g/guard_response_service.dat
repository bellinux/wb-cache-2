40|$|Background Good {{decision-making}} requires {{gathering and}} using sufficient information. Several knowledge translation platforms {{have been introduced}} in Burkina Faso to support evidence-informed decision-making. One {{of these is the}} rapid <b>response</b> <b>service</b> for health. This platform aims to provide quick access for policy-makers in Burkina Faso to highquality research evidence about health systems. The {{purpose of this study is}} to describe the process and extent of the institutionalization of the rapid <b>response</b> <b>service.</b> Methods A qualitative case study design was used, drawing on interviews with policy-makers, together with documentary analysis. Previously used institutionalization frameworks were combined to guide the analysis. Results Burkina Faso’s rapid <b>response</b> <b>service</b> has largely reached the consolidation phase of the institutionalization process but not yet the final phase of maturity. The impetus for the project came from designated project leaders, who convinced policy-makers of the importance of the rapid <b>response</b> <b>service,</b> and obtained resources to run a pilot. During the expansion stage, additional policy-makers at national and sub-national levels began to use the service. Unit staff also tried to improve the way it was delivered, based on lessons learned during the pilot stage. The service has, however, stagnated at the consolidation stage, and not moved into the final phase of maturity. Conclusion The institutionalization process for the rapid <b>response</b> <b>service</b> in Burkina Faso has been fluid rather than linear, with some areas developing faster than others. The service has reached the consolidation stage, but now requires additional efforts to reach maturity...|$|R
