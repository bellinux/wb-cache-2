5|$|The video {{starts with}} {{different}} {{views from the}} city, then shifts to a store where Drake is speaking to the cashier. Rihanna enters, grabbing his attention. She smiles at him and walks towards a fridge and grabs a milk package. Drake follows her and his verse begins. He holds her hand as he raps his verse, the milk package falls from her <b>hand</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> holds his, thus spilling milk on the floor. When Drake's verse is over, Rihanna pushes him and walks away with a smile.|$|E
5|$|Harris {{signed with}} the University of North Carolina Tar Heels to play for head coach Anson Dorrance. Due to {{national}} team commitments for the FIFA U-19 Women's World Cup in Thailand {{in the fall of}} 2004, Harris delayed her enrollment and did not start training with the Tar Heels until the spring of 2005. During one spring practice, a ball caught her right <b>hand</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> was warming up and shattered her thumb. After a surgery that inserted three pins in her thumb, she was put on the bench until the summer. At her first practice back with the Tar Heels in the summer of 2005, Harris tore her right anterior cruciate ligament, which kept her out for the entire 2005 season. Despite being hurt, Harris still made the 2006 Atlantic Coast Conference Academic Honor Roll team.|$|E
25|$|The Queen {{died in the}} {{presence}} of her eldest son, the Prince Regent, who was holding her <b>hand</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> sat in an armchair at the family's country retreat, Dutch House in Surrey (now known as Kew Palace). She was buried at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle. Her husband died just over a year later. She is the second longest-serving consort in British history (after the present Duke of Edinburgh), having served as such from her marriage (on 8 September 1761) to her death (17 November 1818), a total of 57 years and 70 days.|$|E

25|$|One story {{associated}} with the siege, which is related by Nigel Tranter, is that the great cannon Mons Meg was built in Kirkcudbright by a smith named Mollance. The cannon was then presented to James II and employed in the siege of Threave. The story goes that the first cannonball smashed right through the castle, taking off the Fair Maid's <b>hand</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> drank. However, {{it is known that}} Mons Meg was actually made in Burgundy and did not arrive in Scotland until 1457.|$|E
25|$|On 3 October 1968, {{at the age}} of 15, Dupas, still {{attending}} school in Waverley High in the south-eastern Melbourne suburb of Mount Waverley, visited his next-door neighbour, requesting to borrow a knife for the purpose of peeling vegetables. Dupas was apprehended after he stabbed the woman in the face, neck, and <b>hand</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> attempted to fight off his attack. He later told police he could not help himself and did not know why he began to attack the woman. He was placed on 18 months probation and admitted to the Larundel Psychiatric Hospital for evaluation; he was released after two weeks and treated as an outpatient.|$|E
25|$|After touring {{for nearly}} two years {{straight}} for her album Speak for Yourself, Heap continued her travels, this time with only a laptop and video camera on <b>hand,</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> began her writing trip for her next album. Nine weeks later she returned to the UK with the beginnings of the award-winning Ellipse and footage (as requested by a fan to film the making of the album) from its quiet beginning. Back in Essex, Heap hired Justine Pearsall to document the creation of the album. The film documents the creation of the album and the renovation of Heap’s childhood home, including turning her old playroom into her new home studio. Everything In-Between: The Story of Ellipse was released in November 2010.|$|E

25|$|In March 1812 Seringapatam, still {{owned by}} William Melish {{and under the}} command of Captain William Stavers, sailed for the South Atlantic. (Her crew {{included}} John Stavers as Mate and Francis Stavers as gunner.) She then sailed towards the Galapagos Islands via Cape Horn. At the time of her capture Seringapatam did not have a letter of marque in <b>hand</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> had left before the outbreak of war with the United States and as she did not expect to encounter any French vessels. She carried 14 guns on her spar deck; she was pierced to carry guns on her gun deck, but did not carry any there. Although she did not have a letter of marque in hand, she nevertheless, on her way, captured Edward, of Nantucket, which was carrying 1200 barrels of oil, and sent her in to London as a prize. Edward was an American South Seaman, Woodward, master, and she arrived in the Downs on 14 June 1813.|$|E
25|$|On {{the first}} slab, BM 536, {{the battle is}} evenly balanced, one Amazon and one Greek having the better of the {{fighting}} {{in a pair of}} duels. On the following slab, BM 533, appears the first casualty, BM 533:1, an Amazon probably holding the handle of an axe in her right <b>hand</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> collapses. Her helmet lies on the ground to her right side. The dress of the dying Amazon here, an overgirt peplos and mantle, distinguishes her from the other Amazon warriors who wear the more typical chitoniskos. The axe and helmet identify her as a combatant, and the peplos therefore must indicate that {{she is one of the}} three Amazonian queens who take part in the battle. As a queen and the first casualty she must be Melanippe, and the Greek who kills her must be Telamon. Telamon, BM 533:2, stands adjacent to his victim but now has tumed his spear to another.|$|E
2500|$|The {{plan was}} to have the nine {{children}} arrive together, but when the meeting place was changed the night before, the Eckford family's lack of a telephone left Elizabeth uninformed of the change. Instructions were given by Daisy Bates, a strong activist for desegregation, for the nine students to wait for her so that they could all walk together to the rear entrance of the school. This last-minute change caused Elizabeth {{to be the first to}} take a different route to school, walking up to the front entrance completely alone. Elizabeth Eckford’s family were not informed of the meeting, and didn’t know that the school board asked the parents to accompany her. Also, Eckford rode a public bus alone to the segregated school. That day, Elizabeth wore a starched black-and-white dress, and she covered her face under black sunglasses. Elizabeth also held her school book in her <b>hand.</b> <b>As</b> <b>she</b> walked toward the school, Elizabeth was surrounded by a crowd of armed guards and a mob of people, and she did not see any black faces. The mob included men, women, and teenagers (white students) who opposed integration. The white teenagers chanted “Two, four, six, eight, we ain’t gonna integrate.” Elizabeth attempted to go into the school through the mob, but was denied entrance. Eckford ran to a bus bench at the end of the block. Eckford described her experience: ...|$|E
