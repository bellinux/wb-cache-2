5|$|In 1926, West Mersea {{became a}} self-governing urban district, which {{allowed it to}} set up a {{self-contained}} water and sewer system. Unlike several other coastal resorts, the island did not immediately develop any <b>holidaymaker</b> facilities aside from the beach huts which now stretch along the Esplanade.|$|E
5|$|The {{sighting}} by Jane Tanner, {{one of the}} Tapas Seven, of a man {{carrying a}} child that night became {{an important part of}} the early investigation. She had left the restaurant just after 21:00 to check on her own daughter, passing Madeleine's father on Rua Dr Francisco Gentil Martins on his way back to the restaurant from his 21:05 check. He had stopped to chat to a British <b>holidaymaker,</b> but neither man recalled having seen Tanner. This puzzled the Portuguese police, given how narrow the street was, and led them to accuse Tanner of having invented the sighting.|$|E

40|$|We {{estimate}} a pooled travel {{model for}} the destination choice of tourists from the Republic of Ireland in 2006. We distinguish between <b>holidaymakers</b> (further split into travelling with children, elderly, and other), visitors to family, visitors to friends, business travellers and other travellers. We show that {{the different types of}} tourist have very different preferences. Elderly <b>holidaymakers</b> and family visitors stand out most from the ?average? tourist. Preferences for cultural heritage, population density, and temperature discriminate the most between tourist types. We find some evidence that destination preferences vary over the year, but limited data prevent a full investigation. All types of Irish tourists are indifferent to precipitation. Only <b>holidaymakers</b> respond to temperature differences. All <b>holidaymakers</b> dislike cold destinations, but only elderly <b>holidaymakers</b> dislike hot destinations as well.

25|$|In {{the late}} {{afternoon}} a <b>holidaymaker</b> reported seeing four people apparently stranded on Diamond Rock, a semi-submerged reef off Porthluney Cove, west of Dodman Point. The police were informed, {{but at that time}} Darlwyne was not overdue, and thus {{there was no reason to}} connect these people with those on the boat. This incident was not referred to in the subsequent searches, nor in the later Board of Trade enquiry which fixed the most likely time of sinking several hours later.|$|E
500|$|The {{sighting}} became {{important because}} it offered investigators a time frame for the abduction, but Scotland Yard came to {{view it as a}} red herring. In October 2013 they said that a British <b>holidaymaker</b> had been identified as the man Tanner had seen; he had been returning to his apartment after collecting his daughter from the Ocean Club night creche. Scotland Yard took photographs of the man wearing the same or similar clothes to the ones he was wearing on the night, and standing in a pose similar to the one Tanner reported. The pyjamas his daughter had been wearing also matched Tanner's report. Operation Grange's lead detective, DCI Andy Redwood, said they were [...] "almost certain" [...] the Tanner sighting was not related to the abduction.|$|E
2500|$|The {{coming of}} the railway changed Brighton from an {{exclusive}} resort to a town popular with all classes of <b>holidaymaker</b> and permanent resident alike: the population grew by nearly 50% in the first decade. The seafront remained the main attraction, so an array of features were added: pleasure piers, promenades, hotels, entertainment kiosks and an aquarium. [...] The West Pier and Palace Pier date from 1863 and 1891 respectively, although both were completed several years later; Madeira Drive was laid out in 1872 and received its [...] "signature cast-iron terrace" [...] (including a pagoda-shaped lift decorated with Greek gods) in the 1890s; Kings Road was widened in the 1880s; and large hotels began to line it even before this. [...] Early-19th-century hotels such as the Royal Albion, Royal York and Bedford were joined by an Italianate pair by John Whichcord Jr. (the Grand, 1864) and Horatio Nelson Goulty (the Norfolk, 1865). [...] Then in 1890 the vast Metropole Hotel by Alfred Waterhouse [...] "broke the orthodoxy of stucco along the seafront" [...] due to its prominent red-brick and terracotta façade. Its deliberately different design caused shock and brought criticism, but the British Architect journal considered it [...] "a wonderful relief" [...] from the homogeneity of stuccoed Regency buildings. Brighton's architecture was beginning to reflect trends in {{the country as a}} whole, but the Regency style and the Royal Pavilion's onion-domed, minaret-studded opulence continued to influence architecture throughout the town, and on the seafront in particular.|$|E
