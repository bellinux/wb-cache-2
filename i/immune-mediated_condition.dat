Several mutually nonexclusive mechanisms of action ac-count for the immunoregulatory effects of IVIg. Although IVIg inhibits T-cell prolifera-tion and T-cell cytokine production, it is unclear whether these effects are directly dependent on the effects of IVIg on T cells or they are dependent through the inhibi-tion of antigen-presenting cell activity. Here, we examined the effects of IVIg on differentiation, maturation, and function of dendritic cells (DCs). We show that IVIg inhibits the differentiation and maturation of DCs in vitro and abrogates the capacity of mature DC to secrete interleukin- 12 (IL- 12) on activation while enhancing IL- 10 production. IVIg-induced down-regula-tion of costimulatory molecules asso-ciated with modulation of cytokine se-cretion resulted in the inhibition of autoreactive and alloreactive T-cell activa-tion and proliferation. Modulation of DC maturation and function by IVIg is of potential relevance to its immunomodula-tory effects in controlling specific im-mune responses in autoimmune dis-eases, transplantation, and other <b>immune-mediated</b> <b>conditions.</b> (Blood. 2003; 101...|$|R

30|$|IgG 4 -related disease (IgG 4 -RD) is a {{pathological}} condition that {{is characterized by}} an infiltrate composed of IgG 4 -positive plasma cells and recently recognized as an <b>immune-mediated</b> <b>condition.</b> It causes tissue throughout the body to become stiff and thickened due to autoimmune reactions that cause fibrosis and scarring.

A diagnosis of IgG 4 -RD is suspected if {{a high level of}} IgG 4 is found on a blood test. The ideal diagnostic method is pathological examination, but because the clinical manifestations of IgG 4 -RD are very diverse and nonspecific, the disease may often go undiagnosed until an unrelated biopsy or resection specimen is obtained. The most common treatment for IgG 4 -RD is steroid use. However, tapering or stopping steroid administration is seen to result in recurrence in approximately 50 % of cases.

30|$|Eosinophilic {{esophagitis}} (EoE) is {{a relatively}} newly described disease [1], and {{is defined as a}} chronic, allergen- and <b>immune-mediated</b> <b>condition</b> characterized by esophageal dysfunction with unusually high levels of eosinophilic infiltration of the esophageal mucosa (≥ 15 eosinophils/high-power field [eos/hpf]) [2]. Dysphagia (difficulty swallowing) and food impaction are the most common symptoms in adolescents and adults presenting with EoE [2]. In children, other symptoms, such as feeding intolerance, feeding refusal, heartburn and chest pain, are more common [2]. With increasing EoE disease duration and age, there is a concomitant and significant increase in dysphagia symptoms, esophageal strictures and risk of food impaction requiring interventional measures [3 – 5]. A recent meta-analysis of North American and European population-based studies of patients with EoE has estimated that the prevalence and incidence of this disease has been steadily increasing over time [6], with the healthcare-related cost of EoE estimated to be as high as $ 1.36 billion per annum in the USA (data collected from 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2010) [7].|$|E

Therapies consist of anti-eosinophilic medications and specialized diets aimed {{to decrease the}} progression of EoE and alleviate its symptoms, namely, dysphagia and food impaction. Assessing response to therapy remains challenging, as treatment end points are not well defined and currently consist of clinical, histologic, and endoscopic features. Newer validated measures may help standardize treatment end points. Emerging data {{support the use of}} maintenance therapy, which may reduce disease progression. Optimal dosages, delivery techniques, and duration of treatment need to be determined. When features of fibrostenosis develop, esophageal dilation is a safe and effective adjunctive strategy for improving symptoms.

It has wide spectrum of manifestations ranging from failure to thrive, gastrointestinal symptoms to various autoimmune diseases and malignancies. Materials and Methods: The clinical profile of patients diagnosed as CD, presenting at tertiary care hospital of armed forces, was evaluated. The patients were diagnosed as CD as per ESPGHAN guidelines {{on the basis of}} symptoms, positive serology, and histological findings (duodenal biopsy). After history and clinical suspicion of CD, IgA anti-tissue transglutaminase antibody was done. Complete history, physical examination, and baseline investigations including complete blood counts, serum glucose, thyroid function tests, etc., were recorded. Results: The average age of the cohort was 21. 03 years (range 3 – 75 years). The most common presentation was diarrhea (80. 7 %) followed by anemia (63. 2 %) and weight loss (56 %). Anemia was found to be second most common presentation after diarrhea and was seen in 63. 2 %.

Using novel models of Crohn’s disease-like ileitis (i. e., SAMP 1 /YitFc and CD 4 � T cell transfer models), we have begun to understand the adhesive pathways that mediate lymphocyte trafficking to the chronically inflamed small bowel. Expansion of the CD 4 /� 7 population and increased mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule- 1 (MAdCAM- 1) expression were observed within the intestinal lamina propria with disease progression. However, Ab blockade of the � 7 integrin, the � 4 � 7 heterodimer, MAdCAM- 1, or L-selectin did not attenuate inflammation. Blockade of two pathways (L-selectin and MAdCAM- 1 or � 4 integrins) was required to improve ileitis. Further analyses showed that 55 � 7 % of the mesenteric lymph node � 4 � 7 CD 4 expressed L-selectin. These L-selectin � T cells were the main producers of TNF- � and the predominant ileitis-inducing subpopulation.

40|$|Abstract Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is an <b>immune-mediated</b> <b>condition</b> {{driven by}} {{improper}} responses to intestinal microflora {{in the context}} of environmental and genetic background. GWAS in humans have identified many loci associated with IBD, but animal models are valuable for dissecting the underlying molecular mecha-nisms, characterizing environmental and genetic contribu-tions and developing treatments. Mouse models rely on interventions such as chemical treatment or introduction of an infectious agent to induce disease. Here, we describe a new model for IBD in which the disease develops spon-taneously in 20 -week-old mice in the absence of known murine pathogens. The model is part of the Collaborative Cross and came to our attention due to a high incidence of rectal prolapse in an incompletely inbred line. Necropsies revealed a profound proliferative colitis with variable degrees of ulceration and vasculitis, splenomegaly and enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes with no discernible anomalies of other organ systems. Phenotypic character-ization of the CC 011 /Unc mice with homozygosity ranging from 94. 1 to 99. 8 % suggested that the trait was fixed and acted recessively in crosses to the colitis-resistant C 57 BL/ 6 J inbred strain. Using a QTL approach, we identified four loci, Ccc 1, Ccc 2, Ccc 3 and Ccc 4 on chromosomes 12, 14, 1 and 8 that collectively explain 27. 7 % of the phenotypic variation. Surprisingly, we also found that minute levels of residual heterozygosity in CC 011 /Unc have significant impact on the phenotype.

This study aimed explore health care providers' personal models of psoriasis. Design and methodsQualitative analysis of 23 semi-structured interviews with health care professionals providing care for psoriasis patients was performed. Purposive sampling achieved maximum variation regarding participant discipline, level of experience, gender and age. The self-regulatory/common sense model informed data collection and initial data analysis. Principles of framework analysis were used to generate predetermined and emergent key issues related to practitioners' personal models. ResultsThree types of personal model emerged. Sophisticated-Linear Model: 70 % of practitioners recognized psoriasis as a complex condition but managed it as a skin condition. Mixed Model: 17 % of practitioners recognized/managed some elements of psoriasis as complex and some as a skin condition. Sophisticated-Sophisticated Model: 13 % recognized and managed psoriasis as a complex condition. Across the data set, five themes emerged illustrating key patterns underpinning these different models including (1) Recognising complexity, (2) Putting skin first, (3) Taking on the complexities of psoriasis with the patient, (4) Aiming for clearance, and (5) Affective experiences within psoriasis consultations.
