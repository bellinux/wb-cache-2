5|$|Olivier's stage {{roles in}} 1934 {{included}} Bothwell in Gordon Daviot's Queen of Scots, {{which was only}} a moderate success for <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>for</b> the play, but led to an important engagement for the same management (Bronson Albery) shortly afterwards. In the interim {{he had a great}} success playing a thinly disguised version of the American actor John Barrymore in Edna Ferber's Theatre Royal. His success was vitiated by his breaking an ankle two months into the run, in one of the athletic, acrobatic stunts with which he liked to enliven his performances.|$|E
5|$|Hemingway's stories {{typically}} position {{nature as}} a source of refuge and rebirth. His characters are often shown retreating to the country in search of regeneration. Nature acts as the setting for hunters' or fishermen's existential moment of transcendence—especially at the moment when prey is killed. In Big Two-Hearted River, Nick walks away from a ruined town, and enters the woods to hike toward the river, unharmed by the fire. His journey is motivated by absolution; the river is described as two-hearted because it gives life in the form of food (fish) and offers redemption. In the woods, Nick stops in a grove of trees that is described as chapel-like, a description that echoes Stephen Crane's The Red Badge of Courage in which Henry Fleming flees to a chapel-like grove of trees. In the grove Nick sleeps well {{for the first time since}} the war, and there he begins the healing process. The next morning he goes to the river, wading into the water to fish. At first the strength of the current frightens <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> <b>for</b> some moments he has difficulty controlling himself.|$|E

25|$|This match {{had a very}} {{exciting}} climax. When time ran out, England were six runs short of the 234 {{that they needed to}} win. The ninth wicket fell when Derek Shackleton was run out from the fourth ball of the final over. Colin Cowdrey had had his left arm broken earlier in the innings, and had retired hurt. Now he reappeared, with his arm in plaster. Luckily for <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> <b>for</b> England, he was not required to face a ball, David Allen playing out the remaining two deliveries.|$|E
25|$|He soon {{clashed with}} the more {{conservative}} politicians who had been members of the PNR. In March 1930, the mention of his name during a public celebration provoked a number of Romanian Army generals to leave in protest; immediately after, the National Liberal group around Vintilă Brătianu began attacking Stere's party for harbouring <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> <b>for</b> causing a split between Army and political establishment. General Henry Cihoschi, the Minister of Defense, was publicly criticized in parliament for not siding with his subordinates, and had to resign on April 4; Maniu appeared to support Stere's ousting.|$|E

However, there is something that intrigues him and so he catches the train that Sir Gervase wanted him to. On arrival, it is clear that no-one was expecting <b>him,</b> <b>and,</b> <b>for</b> the first time in memory, Sir Gervase himself, who is always punctual, is missing. Poirot and guests go to his study and find him there dead, having apparently shot himself. Poirot is not convinced, however, and soon starts to prove that Sir Gervase was murdered because of various improbable factors surrounding the death, including the position at which the bullet is believed to have struck a mirror and the many different moods that Chevenix-Gore exhibited during the day.|$|E

25|$|This {{attempted}} secession lasted {{five years}} amid great {{political and military}} instability due to opposition from many sectors of society, {{as well as the}} party of Sancho's widow Maria de Molina, supported by the Castilian nobility, and the high Galician clergy. Faced with this resistance, King Dom Denis of Portugal proposed to Queen Maria de Molina that John should held for <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>for</b> his heirs the Kingdom of Galicia, where he counted with the strong support of Fernando Ruiz de Castro and other noblemen, thus granting him the title of King. In 1301, after losing the support of the King of Portugal, John was forced to abandon his claim to sovereignty in exchange for a number of minor titles, thus confirming the unity of the Crown of Castile.|$|E

25|$|As {{early as}} 1871, George Freeman {{had started a}} {{business}} as an auctioneer and this restricted his appearances that year. Although he was not quite so lethal {{as he had been}} in the previous four seasons, it was still a surprise when Freeman did not play in the early matches of the 1872 season, reappearing only against Gloucestershire for his own benefit match. W. G. Grace scored 150 against <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> <b>for</b> the next five years Freeman, with a growing business claiming all his time, played only very occasionally in minor matches for the Malton club. In 1878, however, playing as an amateur, Freeman appeared in first-class cricket for the first time in six years against Middlesex at Lord’s, but lack of practice and the improvement in pitches from the heavy roller and motor mower meant he could not take more than three wickets at a cost of ninety-one runs. He played once against each of the first two Australian touring teams, but took only two wickets in total. However, George Freeman still bowled with success for “Gentlemen of Yorkshire” teams as late as 1883.|$|E

25|$|In 570 the Arian {{king of the}} Visigoths, Leovigild, {{made his}} first attack on the Suebi. Between 572 and 574, Leovigild invaded {{the valley of the}} Douro, pushing the Suebi west and northwards. In 575 the Suebic king, Miro, made a peace treaty with Leovigild in what seemed to be the {{beginning}} of a new period of stability. Yet, in 583 Miro supported the rebellion of the Catholic Gothic prince Hermenegild, engaging in military action against king Leovigild, although Miro was defeated in Seville when trying to break on through the blockade on the Catholic prince. As a result, he was forced to recognize Leovigild as friend and protector, for <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>for</b> his successors, dying back home just some months later. His son, king Eboric, confirmed the friendship with Leovigild, but he was deposed just a year later by his brother-in-law Audeca, giving Leovigild an excuse to attack the kingdom. In 585 AD, first Audeca and later Malaric, were defeated and the Suebic kingdom was incorporated into the Visigothic one as its sixth province. The Suebi were respected in their properties and freedom, and continued to dwell in Gallaecia, finally merging with the rest of the local population during the early Middle Ages.|$|E
25|$|The {{truth about}} Dumbledore's death is {{revealed}} through Snape's last memories in the Pensieve. Harry learns that Dumbledore {{made a terrible}} error by placing a cursed ring on his right hand, sometime between the fifth and sixth book, forgetting the curses that must be on the ring. The ring held the Resurrection Stone, which Dumbledore hoped to use {{to allow him to}} apologise to his sister and parents. Dumbledore called Snape to help him; however, when Snape arrived and assessed the curse, {{all he could do was}} contain it. Snape told Dumbledore that he had little more than a year to live. After hearing this news, Dumbledore revealed to Snape that he knew about Voldemort's plan to have Draco kill him. He asked Snape to use the Killing Curse on him when the time came because he did not want Draco to have to kill him, saying that the boy's soul was still intact; Draco's soul would have been damaged in killing Dumbledore out of malice, whereas Snape was fully aware that he would be merely sparing Dumbledore pain and humiliation. He also intended for Snape to be the one to kill <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>for</b> the Elder Wand to be buried with him, in order to prevent the wand from being passed on again.|$|E
25|$|It was Neil's {{last season}} {{and it was a}} shame that his amazing career should end in an uncharacteristic {{outburst}} of bad temper against Ted Dexter. I never did {{get to the bottom of}} the row but perhaps it was just because he and Ted were total opposites as people. All I know is that his press comments on Ted lost him a lot of friends. These attacks upset the MCC players more than anything else that happened on that tour, and for Neil to retire from the game on this sour note was disappointing for those who had played with an against <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> <b>for</b> the public who had enjoyed his performances. For all this, you couldn't help admiring some of Neil's knocks, including his sixth Test century against England. He was nearly always exciting to watch because he was the sort of batsman who was supremely capable of winning or saving a match. He was also good to bowl to because he gave you a chance; he played shots and he took risks. And his fielding was quite brilliant; in this series, it was easily the best on either side. He stopped some wonderful shots in the covers and took some terrific catches. It was just sad to see such a talented man consumed by such bitterness.|$|E

500|$|While at Charterhouse Vaughan Williams {{found that}} {{religion}} meant {{less and less}} to <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> <b>for</b> a while he was an atheist. This softened into [...] "a cheerful agnosticism", and he continued to attend church regularly to avoid upsetting the family. His views on religion did not affect his love of the Authorised Version of the Bible, the beauty of which, {{in the words of}} Ursula Vaughan Williams in her 1964 biography of the composer, remained [...] "one of his essential companions through life." [...] In this, as in many other things in his life, he was, according to his biographer Michael Kennedy, [...] "that extremely English product the natural nonconformist with a conservative regard for the best tradition".|$|E
500|$|Hańska {{became a}} {{controversial}} figure among the biographers and researchers of Balzac.

Czerny notes {{that one of}} the [...] "greatest experts on Balzac", Spoelberch de Lovenjoul, referred to her as [...] "one of the best women of the epoch", and that while there are those who deride her influence on Balzac, and question her feelings and motivations, few deny she had a crucial impact on <b>him,</b> <b>and,</b> <b>for</b> most, the [...] "Great Balzac" [...] emerged only after meeting her in early 1830s. Czerny concludes by saying: [...] "However one could analyze her and their relationship, the impact of her love on Balzac was persistent, all-enveloping and decisive".|$|E
