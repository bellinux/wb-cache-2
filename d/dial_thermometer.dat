25|$|A direct {{indicating}} <b>dial</b> <b>thermometer</b> (such as a patio thermometer or a meat thermometer) uses a {{bimetallic strip}} wrapped into a coil. One {{end of the}} coil is fixed to the housing of the device and the other drives an indicating needle. A bimetallic strip is also used in a recording thermometer. Breguet's thermometer consists of a tri-metallic helix.|$|E
50|$|Qwt or Qt Widgets for Technical Applications {{is a set}} {{of custom}} Qt widgets, GUI Components and utility classes which are {{primarily}} useful for programs with a technical background. Beside a 2D plot widget it provides scales, sliders, <b>dials,</b> compasses, <b>thermometers,</b> wheels and knobs to control or display values, arrays, or ranges of type double.|$|R
40|$|The Boreal Ecosystem-Atmosphere Study (BOREAS) Hydrology (HYD) - 3 team {{collected}} several {{data sets}} {{related to the}} hydrology of forested areas. This data set contains measurements of snow depth, snow density in three cm intervals, an integrated snow pack density and snow water equivalent (SWE), and snow pack physical properties from snow pit evaluation taken in 1994 and 1996. The {{data were collected from}} several sites in both the southern study area (SSA) and the northern study area (NSA). A variety of standard tools were used to measure the snow pack properties, including a meter stick (snow depth), a 100 cc snow density cutter, a <b>dial</b> stem <b>thermometer,</b> and the Canadian snow sampler as used by HYD- 4 to obtain a snow pack-integrated measure of SWE. This study was undertaken to predict spatial distributions of snow properties important to the hydrology, remote sensing signatures, and the transmissivity of gases through the snow. The data are available in tabular ASCII files. The snow measurement data are available from the Earth Observing System Data and Information System (EOSDIS) Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) Distributed Active Archive Center (DAAC). The data files are available on a CD-ROM (see document number 20010000884) ...|$|R
40|$|TAE (Trans{{portable}} Applications Environment) Plus is an integrated, portable {{environment for}} developing and running interactive window, text, and graphical object-based application systems. The program allows both programmers and non-programmers to easily construct their own custom application interface {{and to move}} that interface and application to different machine environments. TAE Plus makes both the application and the machine environment transparent, with noticeable improvements in the learning curve. The main components of TAE Plus are as follows: (1) the WorkBench, a What You See Is What You Get (WYSIWYG) tool for the design and layout of a user interface; (2) the Window Programming Tools Package (WPT), a set of callable subroutines that control an application's user interface; and (3) TAE Command Language (TCL), an easy-to-learn command language that provides {{an easy way to}} develop an executable application prototype with a run-time interpreted language. The WorkBench tool allows the application developer to interactively construct the layout of an application's display screen by manipulating a set of interaction objects including input items such as buttons, icons, and scrolling text lists. Data-driven graphical objects such as <b>dials,</b> <b>thermometers,</b> and strip charts are also included. TAE Plus updates the strip chart as the data values change. The WorkBench user specifies the windows and interaction objects that will make up the user interface, then specifies the sequence of the user interface dialogue. The description of the designed user interface is then saved into resource files. For those who desire to develop the designed user interface into an operational application, the WorkBench tool also generates source code (C, Ada, and TCL) which fully controls the application's user interface through function calls to the WPTs. The WPTs are the runtime services used by application programs to display and control the user interfaces. Since the WPTs access the workbench-generated resource files during each execution, details such as color, font, location, and object type remain independent from the application code, allowing changes to the user interface without recompiling and relinking. The Silicon Graphics version of TAE Plus now has a font caching scheme and a color caching scheme to make color allocation more efficient. In addition to WPTs, TAE Plus can control interaction of objects from the interpreted TAE Command Language. TCL provides an extremely powerful means for the more experienced developer to quickly prototype an application's use of TAE Plus interaction objects and add programming logic without the overhead of compiling or linking. TAE Plus requires MIT's X Window System, Version 11 Release 4, and the Open Software Foundation's Motif Toolkit 1. 1 or 1. 1. 1. The Workbench and WPTs are written in C++ and the remaining code is written in C. TAE Plus is available by license for an unlimited time period. The licensed program product includes the TAE Plus source code and one set of supporting documentation. Additional documentation may be purchased separately at the price indicated below. The amount of disk space required to load the TAE Plus tar format tape is between 35 Mb and 67 Mb depending on the machine version. The recommended minimum memory is 12 Mb. Each TAE Plus platform delivery tape includes pre-built libraries and executable binary code for that particular machine, as well as source code, so users do not have to do an installation. Users wishing to recompile the source will need both a C compiler and either GNU's C++ Version 1. 39 or later, or a C++ compiler based on AT&T 2. 0 cfront. TAE Plus comes with InterViews and idraw, two software packages developed by Stanford University and integrated in TAE Plus. TAE Plus was developed in 1989 and version 5. 1 was released in 1991. TAE Plus is currently available on media suitable for eight different machine platforms: 1) DEC VAX computers running VMS 5. 3 or higher (TK 50 cartridge in VAX BACKUP format), 2) DEC VAXstations running ULTRIX 4. 1 or later (TK 50 cartridge in UNIX tar format), 3) DEC RISC workstations running ULTRIX 4. 1 or later (TK 50 cartridge in UNIX tar format), 4) HP 9000 Series 300 / 400 computers running HP-UX 8. 0 (. 25 inch HP-preformatted tape cartridge in UNIX tar format), 5) HP 9000 Series 700 computers running HP-UX 8. 05 (HP 4 mm DDS DAT tape cartridge in UNIX tar format), 6) Sun 3 series computers running SunOS 4. 1. 1 (. 25 inch tape cartridge in UNIX tar format), 7) Sun 4 (SPARC) series computers running SunOS 4. 1. 1 (. 25 inch tape cartridge in UNIX tar format), and 8) SGI Indigo computers running IRIX 4. 0. 1 and IRIX/Motif 1. 0. 1 (. 25 inch IRIS tape cartridge in UNIX tar format).
