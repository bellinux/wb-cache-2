5000|$|Contributions to SIPPs {{are treated}} identically to {{contributions}} to {{other types of}} personal pension. Contributions are limited to £3,600 (£2,880 before 20% tax refund) or 100% of earned income (if higher). The maximum was £255,000 for the 2010/11 tax year but the 'Annual Allowance' for all pension contributions was decreased to £50,000 for tax years 2012/13 and 2013/14, and was decreased further to £40,000 starting with the 2014/15 tax year. The SIPP provider claims a tax refund at the basic rate (20% in tax year 2016-17) {{on behalf of the}} customer (i.e. you pay £2,880 and your <b>fund</b> <b>contribution</b> for the year will become £3,600). The 20% is usually added to the 'pot' some 6-11 weeks after your payment is made. Higher rate and additional rate taxpayers must claim any additional tax refund through their tax return if they have one, or by otherwise contacting HMRC (being a higher rate taxpayer, being self employed or having paid too much tax, are all triggers for being requested to complete a tax return). Employer contributions are usually allowable against corporation or income tax.|$|E
40|$|Macroeconomic {{indicators}} {{have been}} identified as having significant affect on a nation’s economy including the quantity of money available for real estate development; and arguably, pension funds {{have been identified}} as real estate finance option. Consequently, what are relationships between macroeconomic indicators and pension <b>fund</b> <b>contributions?</b> In resolving this question, secondary data were obtained from the websites of Central Bank of Nigeria and National Pension Commission covering 2006 to 2010. The Pearson’s product moment correlation analsis revealed the following variables pairing with pension <b>fund</b> <b>contributions</b> as having P-values < 0. 05 : AVNM and PFC (P-value = 0. 0209; r 2 = 0. 93); CPS and PFC (0. 0100; 0. 96); BsM and PFC (0. 0066; 0. 97); CiC and PFC (0. 0059; 0. 97); BRs and PFC (0. 0182; 0. 94); CoB and PFC (0. 0097; 0. 96); DdD and PFC (0. 0230; 0. 93); QuM and PFC (0. 0054; 0. 97); AVBM and PFC (0. 0095; 0. 96). The study found that money supply in the economy (narrow and broad money), credit to private sector, base (or reserved) money, currency in circulation, bank reserves, currency outside bank, demand deposit, quasi money, all have high and positively correlated relationships amongst them.

50|$|Even {{before the}} 1950s {{concerns}} about falling standards were being voiced as pre-war expectations were changing and being challenged. Throughout the decade and beyond, the headmaster continued to measure academic success {{largely by the}} places his pupils secured at Oxford and Cambridge, while the academic success {{of the majority of}} pupils, despite Gibson's concerns in the 1930s, could be regarded as average. The rise in disciplinary incidents led to Punishment Schools taking place in two rooms when more than 40 boys were kept behind, each with two masters in attendance. A Swedish visitor to the school in 1950 regarded the Prefect System as similar to those in Sweden, though less democratic, but was surprised to witness corporal punishment being administered by Collegiate prefects. The prefectorial practice of 'slippering', whacking miscreants on the backside with a plimsoll shoe, would continue for two more decades. In 1959 the School Regulations were printed out and distributed for the first time. Initially this code of conduct included school uniform requirements, information about games, homework, school meals and a request for a School <b>Fund</b> <b>contribution</b> of 2/- (two shillings) per term. As more information about behavioural expectations were added, copying out the School Rules would outstrip lines as the preferred punishment for minor misdeeds.|$|E
40|$|Hong Kong has {{experienced}} the historic transfer from a British colony {{to a special}} administrative region of China in 1997 and faced the challenges of Asian economic crisis in 1997 - 1998, the first incidence of 'bird flu' and the {{severe acute respiratory syndrome}} epidemic in 2003. All these have aggravated the economic downturn. The government, in the wake of these challenges, has devised remedial measures in social welfare, yet painstakingly maintaining its low profile, as it is restrained constitutionally by both its mini-constitution and its adherence to liberal market economy. These characterize a 'developmental state' or 'productivist state'. The government had selectively devoted more resources in pro-market social policies but less in social security for a marginalized group. However, the government has to strive for a proper balance among individual, employer and state responsibilities in <b>fund</b> <b>contribution.</b> This balance is also couched upon the dynamic interaction between economic and social developments. © 2011 Taylor & Francis. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{develops}} an XVA (costs) {{analysis of}} centrally cleared trading, {{parallel to the}} one that has been developed in the last years for bilateral transactions. We introduce a dynamic framework that incorporates the sequence of cash-flows involved in the waterfall of resources of a clearing house. The total cost of the clearance framework for a clearing member, called CCVA for central clearing valuation adjustment, is decomposed into a CVA corresponding to the cost of its losses on the default fund in case of defaults of other member, an MVA corresponding to the cost of funding its margins and a KVA corresponding to the cost of the regulatory capital and also of the capital at risk that the member implicitly provides to the CCP through its default <b>fund</b> <b>contribution.</b> In the end the structure of the XVA equations for bilateral and cleared portfolios is similar, but the input data to these equations are not the same, reflecting different financial network structures. The resulting XVA numbers differ, but, interestingly enough, they become comparable after scaling by a suitable netting ratio...|$|E

40|$|Recent {{economic}} {{events have}} created severe budget problems for state governments, and one area seemingly {{affected by this}} fiscal crisis is state funding for higher education.

This paper examines trends in state higher education appropriations, with a specific focus on the relationship between these two funding sources. We find that on average, total appropriations have actually increased over the past decade, and moreover, earmarked revenue has constituted an increasing share of higher education funding, while general <b>fund</b> <b>contributions</b> have been declining. Our regression analysis suggests that the magnitude of the fungibility between the two sources is substantial, but somewhat surprisingly, does not differ across recessions and expansions.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} asset {{allocation}} decisions of life insurance companies in emerging markets. Mature market insurers allocate {{only a small}} fraction of their assets to emerging markets because of regulatory constraints, rating pressures, and currency risk. However, global insurers invest directly in emerging markets by setting up subsidiaries rather than through portfolio investment, and this trend is increasing. Local insurers largely remain captive investors of local instruments and provide stability to the domestic securities market. The regulatory regime and the liquidity and depth of local markets play an important role in asset allocation decisions of insurers. Insurance companies are increasingly adopting asset liability management and risk control measures. However, insufficiently developed local markets and regulatory interventions on the liabilities side often limit optimal asset allocation.

40|$|As {{national}} government budget {{will be more}} depended upon tax levy, local development finance would virtually be determined by public contribution. The problem of balancing financial allocation between central and local government, therefore, {{is the problem of}} shifting peopleâ€™s <b>fund</b> <b>contribution</b> from central government to the local government. Likewise, by delegating policies to local government for collecting the public fund, people participation in local development finance will be enhanced. It might contrasts to common analysis that there is no significant relationship between local autonomy policy and central-local finance sharing or much analysis which concentrate more on Second Stage Local Governments (Pemda Tingkat II) struggle to increase their local revenue. There are some potential alternatives to improve people participation in local development; First, enhance Local Planning Board (Bappeda Tingkat II) capability to formulate development plans. Overall reformation is needed to development planning mechanisms in each stages of government administration. Second, shift or modify the central-local development finance systems so that there will be more leeway for local government to finance development based on their priorities. Third, give more power to local legislative council (DPRD) to control local executives (Gubernur and Bupati) so that local executives will be responsible much more to the local people rather than to the central government. Conclusively, all efforts to enhance people participation is very closely related to local autonomy improvement and parallel to this is national democracy improvement...|$|E
