25|$|There is {{evidence}} of historic mining activity on the eastern slopes, particularly below Seat How. Four mines operated in this area:- Ladstock, Rachel Wood, Thornthwaite and Beckstones. Most were abandoned in the 1870s but Thornthwaite and Rachel Wood operated until December 1920. The main yields were lead and zinc ores, in particular galena, blende, cerussite and <b>gossan.</b>|$|E
25|$|Kambalda style komatiitic nickel {{mineralisation}} {{was initially}} discovered by <b>gossan</b> searching in ~1965, which discovered the Long, Victor, Otter-Juan and other shoots within the Kambalda Dome. The Redross, Widgie Townsite, Mariners, Wannaway, Dordie North and Miitel nickel gossans were identified generally at {{or around the}} time of drilling of the Widgiemoltha area beginning in 1985, and continuing till today.|$|E
25|$|<b>Gossans</b> {{of nickel}} mineralisation, {{especially}} massive sulfides, are dominated in the arid Yilgarn Craton by boxworks of goethite, hematite, maghemite and ocher clays. Non-sulfide nickel minerals are typically soluble, and preserved rarely at surface as carbonates, although often can be preserved as nickel arsenates (nickeline) within <b>gossans.</b> Within subtropical and Arctic regions, {{it is unlikely}} <b>gossans</b> would be preserved or, if they are, would not contain carbonate minerals.|$|R
50|$|In the 19th and 20th centuries <b>gossans</b> were {{important}} guides to buried ore deposits used by prospectors {{in their quest}} for metal ores.

50|$|Kambaldaite is {{associated}} with goethite, malachite, annabergite, gaspeite and magnesite in the nickel sulfide <b>gossans</b> of Kambalda and Widgiemooltha. It is not known from other nickel sulfide <b>gossans</b> within the Yilgarn Craton, potentially due to many of these existing within areas of laterite cover, deeper regolith development or less favorable rainfall conditions.|$|R
25|$|At {{least five}} copper veins were mined named the Sump, Pave York, Low Gill and <b>Gossan</b> Veins. By 1906 the mine {{was run by}} the Greenburn and Tilberthwaite Syndicate who were {{replaced}} in 1912 by the Langdale Silver, Lead and Copper Company. The reservoir when built in the 19th century was around 1.6 ha in area but a storm {{in the winter of}} 1979-80 caused the dam to burst reducing its height from around 7.5 m to the current 6 m. The effect of the damburst is visible in sediment cores from the downstream Little Langdale Tarn.|$|E

50|$|Iron caps or <b>gossans</b> of {{siliceous}} {{iron oxide}} typically form {{as the result}} of intensive oxidation of sulfide ore deposits. These <b>gossans</b> were used by prospectors as guides to buried ore. In addition the oxidation of those sulfide deposits which contained gold, often resulted in the concentration of gold in the iron oxide and quartz of the <b>gossans.</b> Goldbearing limonite <b>gossans</b> were productively mined in the Shasta County, California mining district. Similar deposits were mined near Rio Tinto in Spain and Mount Morgan in Australia. In the Dahlonega gold belt in Lumpkin County, Georgia gold was mined from limonite-rich lateritic or saprolite soil. The gold of the primary veins was concentrated into the limonites of the deeply weathered rocks. In another example the deeply weathered iron formations of Brazil served to concentrate gold with the limonite of the resulting soils.|$|R

Electrochemical processes and thermodynamic relationships linking acidity to oxidation-reduction reactions between primary sulfide minerals and their oxidative weathering products present in the regolith of Mars are discussed.

40|$|Jarosites and plumbojarosites in <b>gossans</b> {{related to}} Pb-Zn {{mineralization}} in the Canoas District are described. They are always associated with goethite and in minor extent with hematite. Some crystals show zoning with {{a core of}} jarosite and a rim of plumjarosite. Others are rather homogeneous with intermediate composition. In the general formula AB 3 (SO 4) 2 (OH) 6, A sites are occupied by K and Pb and B sites by Fe, Al and Zn. A and B sites are often incompletely filled. A sites generally show excess of charge. B sites show deficiency. Jarosites and plumbojarosites are secondary minerals formed by sulfur, iron and lead derived from the weathering of sulphides, and potassium from the gangue mineral orthoclase. The jarosite-goethite association in <b>gossans</b> percolated by meteoric waters is thermodynamically unstable. It persists due to the sluggishness of {{the transformation of the}} jarosite into goethite. Thus, the Canoas jarosites are transitory Pb bearing phases. In the mature <b>gossans</b> Pb is associated only with the oxyhydroxides. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
50|$|Scorodite is {{a common}} {{hydrated}} iron arsenate mineral, with the chemical formula FeAsO4·2H2O. It is found in hydrothermal deposits and as a secondary mineral in <b>gossans</b> worldwide. Scorodite weathers to limonite.|$|R
25|$|Minerals such as gaspeite, hellyerite, otwayite, widgiemoolthalite {{and related}} hydrous nickel carbonates are {{diagnostic}} of nickel <b>gossans,</b> but are exceedingly rare.

50|$|<b>Gossan</b> (eiserner hut or eisenhut) is {{intensely}} oxidized, weathered or decomposed rock, {{usually the}} upper and exposed part of an ore deposit or mineral vein. In the classic <b>gossan</b> or iron cap all that remains is iron oxides and quartz often {{in the form of}} boxworks, quartz lined cavities retaining the shape of the dissolved ore minerals. In other cases quartz and iron oxides, limonite, goethite, and jarosite, exist as pseudomorphs replacing the pyrite and primary ore minerals. Frequently <b>gossan</b> appears as a red stain against the background rock and soil due to the abundance of oxidized iron and the <b>gossan</b> may be a topographic positive area due to the abundance of erosion resistant quartz and iron oxides. Although most gossans are red, orange, or yellow, black gossans from manganese oxides such as pyrolusite, manganite, and especially psilomelane form at the oxidized portion of Mn-rich mineral deposits.|$|E

50|$|Kambaldaite from Kambalda and Widgiemooltha is {{associated}} with komatiite-associated nickel sulfide <b>gossans</b> and is probably formed by substitution of nickel into carbonates such as magnesite which are formed by oxidation of the lithology, and oxidation of primary and supergene nickel sulfide minerals.|$|R
40|$|One of the {{challenges}} in the detecting of ore bodies in tropical environments is the discrimination between iron-rich surfaces, originated from the supergenic alteration of the sulphides (<b>gossans),</b> and generic lateritic crusts, also rich in iron, however, unrelated to metallic ores.
