40|$|As wide-area {{persistent}} imaging systems become cost effective, increasingly {{large areas}} of the earth can be imaged at relatively high frame rates. Efficient exploitation of the large geo-spatial-temporal datasets produced by these systems poses significant technical challenges for image and video analysis and for data mining. Significant progress in image stabilization, moving object detection and tracking, are allowing automated systems to generate hundreds to thousands of vehicle tracks from raw data, with little human intervention. However, tracking performance at this scale is unreliable, and average track length is much smaller than the average vehicle route. These are limiting factors for applications that depend heavily on track identity, i. e. tracking vehicles from their points of origin to their final destination. In this paper, we propose and evaluate a framework for wide-area motion <b>imagery</b> (WAMI) <b>exploitation</b> that minimizes the dependence on track identity. In its current form, this framework takes noisy, incomplete moving object detection tracks as input, and produces a small set of activities (e. g. multi-vehicle meetings) as output. The framework can be used to focus and direct human users and additional computation, and suggests a path towards high-level content extraction by learning from the human-in-the-loop...|$|R

40|$|Whenever a new sensor or system comes online, {{engineers}} and analysts responsible for processing the measured data turn first to methods that are {{tried and true}} on existing systems. This is a natural, if not wholly logical approach, and is exactly {{what has happened in}} the advent of hyperspectral <b>imagery</b> (HSI) <b>exploitation.</b> However, a closer look at the assumptions made by the approaches published in the literature has not been undertaken. This thesis analyzes three key aspects of HSI exploitation: statistical data modeling, covariance estimation from training data, and dimension reduction. These items are part of standard processing schemes, and it is worthwhile to understand and quantify the impact that various assumptions for these items have on target detectability and detection statistics. First, the accuracy and applicability of the standard Gaussian (i. e., Normal) model is evaluated, and it is shown that the elliptically contoured t-distribution (EC-t) sometimes offers a better statistical model for HSI data. A finite mixture approach for EC-t is developed in which all parameters are estimated simultaneously without a priori information. Then the effects of making a poor covariance estimate are shown by including target samples in the training data. Multiple test cases with ground targets are explored. They show that the magnitude of the deleterious effect of covariance contamination on detection statistics depends on algorithm type and target signal characteristics. Next, the two most widely used dimension reduction approaches are tested. It is demonstrated that, in many cases, significant dimension reduction can be achieved with only a minor loss in detection performance. In addition, a concise development of key HSI detection algorithms is presented, and the state-of-the-art in adaptive detectors is benchmarked for land mine targets. Methods for detection and identification of airborne gases using hyperspectral imagery are discussed, and this application is highlighted as an excellent opportunity for future work. Ph. D.

40|$|Background Remote sensing-based {{inventories}} {{are essential}} in estimating forest cover in tropical and subtropical countries, where ground inventories cannot be performed periodically {{at a large}} scale owing to high costs and forest inaccessibility (e. g. REDD projects) and are mandatory for constructing historical records {{that can be used}} as forest cover baselines. Given the conditions of such inventories, the survey area is partitioned into a grid of imagery segments of pre-fixed size where the proportion of forest cover can be measured within segments using a combination of unsupervised (automated or semi-automated) classification of satellite imagery and manual (i. e. visual on-screen) enhancements. Because visual on-screen operations are time expensive procedures, manual classification can be performed only for a sample of imagery segments selected at a first stage, while forest cover within each selected segment is estimated at a second stage from a sample of pixels selected within the segment. Because forest cover data arising from unsupervised satellite imagery classification may be freely available (e. g. Landsat imagery) over the entire survey area (wall-to-wall data) and are likely to be good proxies of manually classified cover data (sample data), they can be adopted as suitable auxiliary information. Methods The question is how to choose the sample areas where manual classification is carried out. We have investigated the efficiency of one-per-stratum stratified sampling for selecting segments and pixels, where to carry out manual classification and to determine the efficiency of the difference estimator for exploiting auxiliary information at the estimation level. The performance of this strategy is compared with simple random sampling without replacement. Results Our results were obtained theoretically from three artificial populations constructed from the Landsat classification (forest/non forest) available at pixel level for a study area located in central Italy, assuming three levels of error rates of the unsupervised classification of satellite <b>imagery.</b> The <b>exploitation</b> of map data as auxiliary information in the difference estimator proves to be highly effective with respect to the Horvitz-Thompson estimator, in which no auxiliary information is exploited. The use of one-per-stratum stratified sampling provides relevant improvement with respect to the use of simple random sampling without replacement. Conclusions The use of one-per-stratum stratified sampling with many imagery segments selected at the first stage and few pixels within at the second stage - jointly with a difference estimator - proves to be a suitable strategy to estimate forest cover by remote sensing-based inventories. ...|$|R

The 1st Reconnaissance Squadron (Beale AFB, CA) currently trains all RQ-4A pilots and sensor operators.The 13th Intelligence Squadron has a proud history {{dating back to the}} Second World War. The unit was originally constituted on 1 February 1945, as the 13th Photographic Technical Unit at Maastricht, the Netherlands. In April 1945, the unit reported to France. In May 1945 following the allied advance, the 13th reported to Germany where it was assigned to the 363rd Tactical Reconnaissance Group. On 20 November 1945, at the close of World War II, the 13th was inactivated.The unit was reactivated as the 13th Reconnaissance Technical Squadron on 10 April 1963 at Ton Son Nhut Airfield, Republic of Vietnam. The 13th conducted tactical reconnaissance photo-processing and exploitation focused on Vietnam. On 15 June 1967, the unit moved to Clark Air Base, Philippines until it was again inactivated on 15 June 1971.In 1992, the 548th Air Intelligence Group (AIG) Detachment 1 was activated at Beale AFB, CA to prepare a site for Contingency Airborne Reconnaissance System (CARS), Deployable Ground Station Two (DGS-2). On 29 September 1994, the 548th AIG Det. 1 was re-designated the 13th Intelligence Squadron. The unit was charged with conducting near-real-time <b>imagery</b> <b>exploitation</b> and all-source analysis of U-2 derived intelligence. Using state-of-the-art ground and satellite relays, DGS-2 crews pioneered the practice of “reach-back” collection, using sensors on board a U-2 aircraft operating half-way around the world as if they were virtually on board the aircraft.In August 1995, the 13th IS, as part of DGS-2, supported operation DELIBERATE FORCE, a brief NATO air campaign in the former Yugoslav Republic of Bosnia- Herzegovina. In November 1995, DGS-2 began participating in Operation JOINT GUARDIAN to support multi-national peacekeeping forces in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Because of its outstanding performance, completing over 450 successful missions, the 13th Intelligence Squadron was awarded the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency’s National Intelligence Meritorious Unit Citation for 1996 and 1997.In January 1998, the 13th IS conducted the first Joint Chiefs of Staff operational tasking utilizing the Extended Tether Program (ETP) architecture. ETP provide DGS-2 with a worldwide, quickly deployable two-way satellite link to the U-2 aircraft. This operation, known as BITTER DISTANT, was a counter-drug operation in the USSOUTHCOM area of operations. In October 1998, DGS-2 began 24/7 surveillance and reconnaissance operations to monitor the deteriorating situation in Kosovo. On 24 March 1999, NATO-led Operation ALLIED FORCE was launched with the aim of expelling Serbian forces from the province of Kosovo. DGS-2 participated in operation ALLIED FORCE for its duration, supporting 190 U-2 sorties over 78 days. In addition, DGS-2 conducted processing, exploitation, and dissemination for the PREDATOR unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) during the first combat employment of a UAV to laser designate targets for precision-guided munitions. DGS-2 is credited with the destruction of 39 SAM systems and 28 aircraft during this operation.During its 53-year history, the 13th Intelligence Squadron has been recognized for many milestone accomplishments. Together with the 48th Intelligence Squadron, DGS-2 leads the cutting edge of the United States military’s Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance Operations.|$|E

40|$|Cultural {{features}} {{of interest for}} map making are often defined by qualitative non-local spatial relationships. Coastal shoreline, for example, is the boundary where land, including islands, shares edge with open water. Previously, we reported on our Neural Fusion system for multisensor image fusion and mining for local features. In this paper, we introduce a rule-based post-mining stage that infers higher-level feature descriptions from local mining results. Our methods for fusion and mining are based on concepts derived from neural models of visual processing. They capture local spectral and spatial information for semi-supervised pattern learning & recognition. With the added capability of non-local geospatial reasoning, we demonstrate feature extractions that are not possible using local pattern recognition alone, like river features through cloud occlusions.
