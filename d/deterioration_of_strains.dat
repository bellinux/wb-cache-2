Rajkumar was released by Veerappan on November 15, 2000 after spending 108 days in his custody. The kidnapping resulted in the further <b>deterioration</b> <b>of</b> already <b>strained</b> relations between the Indian states of Tamil Nadu and Karnataka and created a tense situation in the two states.|$|R
25|$|By September 2007, US Airways {{continued}} to downgrade Pittsburgh International Airport's status from 500 flights a day (with 12,000 employees) in 2001 to just 68 flights a day (with only 1,800 employees). CEO Parker stated his frustration at {{the economics of}} Pittsburgh and referred {{to the possibility of}} service further decreasing. This represented a further <b>deterioration</b> <b>of</b> a <b>strained</b> relationship with Allegheny County, with which the airline shared significant historical ties. US Airways Group Inc. said October 3, 2007 it would cut mainline flights at Pittsburgh International Airport to 22 a day from 31 and reduce regional flights to 46 a day from 77, beginning January 6, 2008, essentially reducing the airport to a destination spoke in its network. Pittsburgh was no longer a focus city for the airline as of its most recent annual report and January 2008 flight schedule reductions.|$|R

40|$|We {{engage in}} a {{critical}} assessment of the neo-malthusian claim that climatic changes {{can be an important}} source of international tensions, in the extreme even militarized interstate disputes. The most likely scenario is conflict over water allocation in international catchments shared by poorer, less democratic, and politically less stable countries, governed by weak international water management institutions, and exposed to severe climatic changes. The Syr Darya corresponds quite well to all these characteristics. If the neo-malthusian specter of conflict over water is empirically relevant, we should see signs of this in the Syr Darya. The riparian countries of the Aral Sea basin have experienced international disputes over water allocation ever since the USSR collapsed and, with it, existing water management institutions and funding. The worst such dispute concerns the Syr Darya, one of the two largest rivers in Central Asia. Based on hydrological data and other information we find that the only existing international water management institution in the Syr Darya has failed. Based on a coupled climate, land-ice and rainfall-runoff model for the Syr Darya, we then examine whether, {{in the absence of an}} effective international water allo-cation mechanism, climate change is likely to make existing international tensions over water allocation worse. We find that climate change-induced shifts in river runoff, to which the Uzbek part of the Syr Darya catchment is particularly vulnerable, and which could contribute to a <b>deterioration</b> <b>of</b> already <b>strained</b> Kyrgyzâ€“Uzbek relations, are likely to set in only in the medium to long term. This leaves some time for the riparian countries to set up an effective international framework for water allocation and prevention of climate-induced geohazards. By impli-cation, our findings suggest that a climate change-induced militarized interstate dispute over water resources in Central Asia is unlikely...|$|R

40|$|Investigation <b>of</b> the <b>deterioration</b> <b>of</b> {{paintings}} requires {{not only}} the testing of archival samples but also the development and testing of model paintings which accurately represent naturally aged paintings.

Assessments included uniaxial and biaxial tensile tests and the measurement <b>of</b> <b>strain</b> within stretched samples using electronic speckle pattern interferometry. The 19 th-century linings tested have a mean strength of 15 that of new linen. Artificially aged linen (using 10 sulphuric acid) could be matched for archival strength and stiffness but further work is needed to achieve equivalent brittleness. Biaxial tests demonstrated that canvas on a stretcher would fail at loads lower than those expected from a simple consideration of the uniaxial strength, indicating the presence <b>of</b> <b>strain</b> concentrations approaching a factor of 10.

40|$|Abstract. In most studies, <b>deterioration</b> <b>of</b> {{concrete}} due to carbonation or chloride penetration is investigated separately. However, the <b>deterioration</b> <b>of</b> concrete {{is normally}} {{caused by the}} combination. The {{purpose of this study}} is to investigate the interaction between carbonation and chloride penetration and their effects on concrete. This was examined experimentally under various boundary conditions. For concrete under the double condition, the risk <b>of</b> <b>deterioration</b> due to carbonation was not severe. However, it was found that the carbonation of concrete could significantly accelerate chloride penetration. As a result, chloride penetration in combination with carbonation can cause harmful <b>deterioration</b> <b>of</b> concrete...|$|R

40|$|In acute {{coronary}} syndrome (ACS) {{patients with}} <b>deterioration</b> <b>of</b> coronary flow during percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), a scattered necrotic core pattern (SNC) is observed by intravascular ultrasound virtual histology (VH-IVUS). The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the impact <b>of</b> SNC on <b>deterioration</b> <b>of</b> coronary flow during PCI in ACS. A total of 38 ACS patients were imaged using VH-IVUS before PCI. In addition to conventional definitions of thin-cap fibroatheroma by VHIVUS (ID-TCFA), the SNC was defined as necrotic core foci with a maximum diameter of 50 % plaque burden except in the ID-TCFA frame. Patients were divided into <b>deterioration</b> <b>of</b> coronary flow group (n = 15) and normal-reflow group (n = 23). The incidence of residual thrombus and plaque rupture, the external elastic membrane, plaque and fibrous volumes, the incidence of IDTCFA and the average number of SNC per frame was significantly greater in <b>deterioration</b> <b>of</b> coronary flow group than in normal-reflow group (all parameters P < 0. 05). Multivariate analysis revealed that the average number of SNC per frame was independently associated with <b>deterioration</b> <b>of</b> coronary flow in ACS patients (odds ratio 1. 18, P < 0. 05). In conclusion, an increased number of SNC is associated with <b>deterioration</b> <b>of</b> coronary flow during PCI in ACS patients. Â© Springer 2011...|$|R
