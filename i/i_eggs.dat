40|$|ABSTRACT. <b>i</b> <b>Eggs</b> of aedine tr,osquitoes vary in size, outline, color, and {{chorionic}} detail {{according to}} genus, subgenus, group and evm species in most instances. Whole eggs show sufFcient specific details to permit rapid separation to species when examined in intense reflected light. Surface detaik of the chorion show patterns that are readily recogniz&le when examined as cleared material in suitable trctnsmitted light. 7 axonomists will find additional support for phylogenetic {{concepts of the}} Culicidae. Sanitarians and ecologists {{will be able to}} apply the information[to extension of procedures for surveying populations of floodwater Tosquitoes. Interest in Nearctic aedine mosquitoes is increasing l&cause of their annoyance to humans and because of their ability to serve as vectors and reservoirs of agents causing disease. Unfortunately, little is known about these mosquitoes because most of them are d&cult to colonize in the laboratory. Incomplete knowledge concerning the egg stage has hampered investigation. Satisfactory methods for finding eggs in natural sites have become known only recently. Means for recognizing eggs have been unknown until recently.

40|$|Considered a generalist species {{among the}} coccinellids, the multicolored Asian lady beetle Harmonia axyridis (Pallas) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) feeds upon small {{arthropods}} and non-prey plant products, a practice which might enhance {{its ability to}} colonize various ecosystems but carries the potential to expose it to prey quality variation and insecticide use. Thus, we examined the effect of four different diets on the development, reproduction, and response to the insecticide lambda-cyhalothrin in this species. Three groups of larvae received laboratory-reared diets: (<b>i)</b> <b>eggs</b> of Anagasta kuehniella (Zeller) (Ak); (ii) eggs of Sitotroga cerealella (Olivier) (Sc); and (iii) eggs of A. kuehniella + S. cerealella at the proportion 1 : 1; and one group received wild-caught cotton aphids, Aphis gossypii Glover (Ag). Notwithstanding the generalist feeding behavior of H. axyridis, development and reproduction esults were superior with diets of Ag or Ak compared with the diet combining 1 : 1 Ak + Sc or the diet of Sc eggs only. Furthermore, the Sc diet {{did not result in}} satisfactory development and reproduction. Despite this significant variation in biological responses, insecticide susceptibility studies using adults that had been reared on these diets showed no statistically significant differences in susceptibility to the lambda-cyhalothrin. 201...|$|E

40|$|Letrozole is a {{synthetic}} aromatase inhibitor and interferes in the committed {{step in the}} synthesis of endogenous estrogens from androgens. To evaluate potential effects on the early life stages of Japanese medaka, larvae and fertilized eggs were exposed to letrozole for 96 h and 14 days, respectively. No larvae died and no adverse effects were found on embryonic development at concentrations up to 3125 mu g/L. Reproductive effects were assessed by exposing adults to 1, 5, 25, 125 and. 625 mu g/L letrozole for 21 days. A dose-dependent decrease in fecundity (> 25 mu g/L) and fertility (> 5 mu g/ L) accompanied by histological changes suggested the inhibition of oocyte growth and possibly maturation. At 625 mu g/L, the fish ceased spawning {{during the last week}} of exposure. Letrozole (> 5 mu g/L) reduced plasma vitellogenin levels in females in a dose-dependent manner. Transgenerational effects were evaluated by removing freshly-laid F <b>I</b> <b>eggs</b> from letrozole-contaminated water and raising them to 15 days post-hatching in control water.

40|$|Glyphosate-based {{herbicide}} formulations are broadly used in agriculture, silviculture, horticulture {{as well as}} {{in private}} gardens all over the world, thus posing the risk of potential contamination of nearby aquatic bodies inhabited by amphibians. Concurrently, climate change can be expected to alter the temperature of amphibian breeding sites. However, while either glyphosate-based herbicides or temperature have been shown to separately affect the development of amphibians, very little is known on possible interactive effects. We studied the impact of herbicide concentrations and temperature on growth and development of eggs and tadpoles of the Common toad (Bufo bufo L.). We hypothesized that (<b>i)</b> <b>eggs</b> would be better protected against herbicides than tadpoles because of their jelly coating, (ii) that higher temperatures would reduce potential herbicide effects because of an accelerated growth and a lower sensitivity of larger specimens. We conducted one experiment starting with eggs (Gosner stage, GS 9) and another experiment starting with tadpoles (GS 21 - 24) using a full factorial design with 5 concentrations of the herbicide formulation Roundup® LB Plus (0 mg acid equivalent L- 1, 0. 5 mg a. e. L- 1, 1. 0 mg a. e. L- 1 or 1. 5 mg a. e. L- 1 and a pulse treatment with 3 - 4 times addition of 0. 5 a. e. mg L- 1 {{over the course of several}} weeks) and two temperature levels (15 °C and 20 °C). Contrary to our expectation, our results showed that toad eggs are more sensitive to herbicides than tadpoles leading to an averaged 31 % increase in total length, tail length and body length compared to the herbicide-free control. Tadpole morphology, development or mortality was not influenced by herbicides. Higher temperature accelerated growth of both eggs and tadpoles. This is among the first study showing interactive effects between herbicides and temperature especially for egg development resulting in more pronounced herbicide effects at lower temperatures than at higher temperatures...|$|E

40|$|Egg storage {{longer than}} 7 d is {{associated}} with a delay in hatch time and a decline in hatchability and chick quality. Prestorage incubation is suggested as a method to reduce the negative effects of prolonged storage times by altering the developmental stage of the embryo, but earlier research has shown that prestorage incubation can both be detrimental and beneficial for hatchability. The reason for these ambiguous results is not clear and the effect of prestorage incubation on chick quality is not studied extensively. The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate changes in developmental stage of embryos during prestorage incubation and the effect of prestorage incubation on hatchability and chick quality. Two experiments were conducted. In experiment <b>I,</b> <b>eggs</b> were stored for 3, 5, 8, or 12 d. In experiment II, eggs were stored for 5 or 11 d. Half of the eggs was stored immediately at 16 to 18 °C and the other half was exposed to prestorage incubation for 6 h in experiment I and for 4. 5 h in experiment II. According to the classification table of Eyal-Giladi and Kochav (EG), embryonic development was advanced by prestorage incubation from developmental stage EG 11. 67 to developmental stage EG 13. 26 in experiment I (P = 0. 02) and from developmental stage EG 9. 22 to developmental stage EG 12. 63 in experiment II (P < 0. 0001). In experiment I, prestorage incubation reduced hatchability of set eggs from 59. 3 to 51. 5 % when storage time was 12 d but did not reduce hatchability when storage time was 3, 5, or 8 d (interaction P = 0. 02). Prestorage incubation increased chick length (P = 0. 004). In experiment II, prestorage incubation increased hatchability of fertile eggs from 80. 6 to 85. 9 % when storage time was 11 d but did not increase hatchability when storage time was 5 d (interaction P = 0. 0009). Prestorage incubation increased percentage of second grade chicks (P = 0. 0007).

The {{effect of}} holding eggs before {{incubation}} on the hatchability {{of the eggs}} was examined by using eggs laid by hybrids between New Hampshire males and White Leghorn females. A total 6, 274 hatching eggs were incubated after held {{at room temperature for}} 1 to 8 days. Experiments were carried out in the following eight period : <b>I,</b> <b>eggs</b> laid during a period of April 19 to 26; II, May 10 to 17; III, May 31 to June 7; IV, June 21 to 28; V, July 12 to 19; VI, August 2 to 9; VII, August 23 to 30; and VIII, September 13 to 20. The results obtained were summarized as fallows. 1) The average percentages of eggs laid and hatching eggs were 67. 33 % (range: 60. 91 - 74. 00 %) and 82. 35 % (range: 79. 09 - 87. 01 %), respectively. 2) In experimental periods I to VIII, the fertility rate of hatching eggs was 92. 63, 90. 26, 87. 38, 86. 90, 85. 81, 86. 71, 83. 75, and 75. 99 - 0 x 1. fb 11 p+ 0 nd the hatchability of fertile eggs was 92. 16, 91. 65, 89. 30, 88. 90, 82. 85, 83. 31, 80. 24, and 84. 65 %, respectively.

From these results, it is suggested that the low hatchability may have been brought about by the continuation of such high temperature as approximately 27 ℃.
