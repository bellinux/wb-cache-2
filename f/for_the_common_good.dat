5|$|In the {{economic}} field, the document addressed {{the lack of}} a bourgeoisie that could turn the political changes into economic development, and proposed to overcome this lack with strong state interventionism. Mariano Moreno proposed that the state invest 200 or 300 million in factories, manufacturing, arts, agriculture, navigation, and other critical areas. There would be no risk of bankruptcy because the state would manage the businesses. With the money generated, the state would then seek seeds and tools, and ultimately allow the continent to be economically autarchic. The initial money that the state would need to become such an active economic force would come from the mines in Potosi, where the slavers had nearly 500 or 600 million. Moreno proposed simply to confiscate the money and nationalize the mines. He reasoned that five or six thousand people would be harmed by such action, but eighty or a hundred thousand would benefit. The state would not manage those areas indefinitely; Moreno proposed that this should be done only until there was a strong economic activity in each area, and then the state would just observe, making sure that they followed the laws enacted <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>common</b> <b>good</b> of society.|$|E

25|$|Although {{there was}} a narrow {{majority}} in the Cabinet for drastic reductions in spending, the minority included senior ministers such as Arthur Henderson who {{made it clear they}} would resign rather than acquiesce in the cuts. With this unworkable split, on 24 August 1931 MacDonald submitted his resignation and then agreed, on the urging of King George V to form a National Government with the Conservatives and Liberals. With Henderson taking the lead, MacDonald, Snowden, and Thomas were quickly expelled from the Labour Party. They responded by forming a new National Labour group, which provided a nominal party base for the expelled MPs but received little support in the country or the unions. Great anger in the labour movement greeted MacDonald's move. Riots took place in protest in Glasgow and Manchester.

500|$|Bucer's {{priority}} in Strasbourg was to instill moral {{discipline in the}} church. To this end, special wardens (Kirchenpfleger), chosen from among the laity, were assigned to each congregation to supervise both doctrine and practice. [...] His concerns were motivated by {{the effects of a}} rapidly rising refugee population, attracted by Strasbourg's tolerant asylum policies. [...] Influxes of refugees, particularly after 1528, had brought a series of revolutionary preachers into Strasbourg. These men were inspired by a variety of apocalyptic and mystical doctrines, and in some cases by hostility towards the social order and the notion of an official church. Significant numbers of refugees were Anabaptists and spiritualists, such as the followers of Melchior Hoffman, Caspar Schwenckfeld, and Clemens Ziegler. [...] Bucer personally took responsibility for attacking these and other popular preachers to minimize their influence and secure their expulsion and that of their followers. [...] On 30 November 1532, the pastors and wardens of the church petitioned the council to enforce ethical standards, officially sanction the reformed faith, and refute the [...] "sectarian" [...] doctrines. The ruling authorities, who had allowed sectarian congregations to thrive among the refugees and lower orders, would only expel the obvious troublemakers. Bucer insisted that the council urgently take control of all Christian worship in the city <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>common</b> <b>good.</b>|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the competition between}} two spatially differentiated multi-product retailers who encounter entry from a dominant discount retailer. Our primary objective is to determine how entry affects the pricing and relative profits of the incumbent stores and {{the role played by}} the location of the entrant. The new entrant has partial overlap in product assortment with the incumbents and is assumed to have lower procurement costs <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>common</b> <b>goods.</b> Consumers are heterogeneous in their location, economic status (shopping costs and valuations), as well as purchase basket or the types of products demanded. Results show that in the post entry equilibrium, <b>the</b> prices <b>for</b> <b>the</b> products not offered by the discounter are higher than the pre entry prices. More interestingly, contrary to the conventional wisdom we find that the store that is closer to the new entrant is better off compared to the incumbent located further away. <b>The</b> intuition <b>for</b> these results is that the discounter with its low price draws away the poor consumers – the price sensitive segment – out of <b>the</b> market <b>for</b> <b>the</b> items it carries. This in turn softens price competition between <b>the</b> incumbents <b>for</b> these items. Furthermore, the new entrant’s unique product offering attracts more consumers to visit the location it occupies, which introduces positive demand externalities to the neighboring retailer, leading to an increase in sales <b>for</b> <b>the</b> non-competing products. We provide empirical evidence for our results and discuss implications for retailers facing competition from large discount stores. entry; retail competition; agglomeration...|$|R
