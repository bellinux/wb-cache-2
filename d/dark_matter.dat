5|$|Indirect {{evidence}} for <b>dark</b> <b>matter</b> comes from its gravitational influence on other matter, as no <b>dark</b> <b>matter</b> particles {{have been observed}} in laboratories. Many particle physics candidates for <b>dark</b> <b>matter</b> have been proposed, and several projects to detect them directly are underway.|$|E
5|$|<b>Dark</b> <b>matter</b> is {{the matter}} in the {{universe}} that cannot be seen. Because of the gravitational effect it exerts on stars and galaxies, scientists know that approximately 80% of the matter in the universe is <b>dark</b> <b>matter.</b> The spatial distribution of <b>dark</b> <b>matter</b> in the universe is largely unknown; SIM Lite would have helped scientists answer to this question.|$|E
5|$|Kinematic {{studies of}} {{matter in the}} Milky Way and other galaxies have {{demonstrated}} {{that there is more}} mass than can be accounted for by visible matter. A <b>dark</b> <b>matter</b> halo appears to dominate the mass, although the nature of this <b>dark</b> <b>matter</b> remains undetermined.|$|E

5|$|A {{study of}} 27 Milky Way neighbors {{found that in}} all dwarf galaxies, the central mass is {{approximately}} 10 million solar masses, {{regardless of whether the}} galaxy has thousands or millions of stars. This has led to the suggestion that galaxies are largely formed by <b>dark</b> <b>matter,</b> and that the minimum size may indicate a form of warm <b>dark</b> <b>matter</b> incapable of gravitational coalescence on a smaller scale.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, {{there are}} {{outstanding}} {{problems associated with}} the currently favored cold <b>dark</b> <b>matter</b> model which include the dwarf galaxy problem and the cuspy halo problem. Alternative theories have been proposed that do not require a large amount of undetected matter, but instead modify the laws of gravity established by Newton and Einstein; yet no alternative theory has been as successful as the cold <b>dark</b> <b>matter</b> proposal in explaining all extant observations.|$|E
5|$|The strongest {{evidence}} for <b>dark</b> <b>matter</b> comes from galactic motion. Galaxies rotate {{much faster than}} the amount of visible matter suggests they should; the gravity from the ordinary matter {{is not enough to}} hold the galaxy together. Scientists theorize that the galaxy is held together by huge quantities of <b>dark</b> <b>matter.</b> Similarly, clusters of galaxies do not appear to have enough visible matter to gravitationally balance the high speed motions of their component galaxies.|$|E

5|$|<b>Dark</b> <b>matter</b> {{and dark}} energy are the current leading topics in astronomy, as their {{discovery}} and controversy originated {{during the study}} of the galaxies.|$|E
5|$|During the 1970s and the 1980s, various {{observations}} {{showed that}} there is not sufficient visible matter in the universe to account for the apparent strength of gravitational forces within and between galaxies. This led to the idea that up to 90% of the matter in the universe is <b>dark</b> <b>matter</b> that does not emit light or interact with normal baryonic matter. In addition, the assumption that the universe is mostly normal matter led to predictions that were strongly inconsistent with observations. In particular, the universe today is far more lumpy and contains far less deuterium than can be accounted for without <b>dark</b> <b>matter.</b> While <b>dark</b> <b>matter</b> has always been controversial, it is inferred by various observations: the anisotropies in the CMB, galaxy cluster velocity dispersions, large-scale structure distributions, gravitational lensing studies, and X-ray measurements of galaxy clusters.|$|E
5|$|Estimates put {{the average}} energy {{density of the}} Universe at the {{equivalent}} of 5.9 protons per cubic meter, including dark energy, <b>dark</b> <b>matter,</b> and baryonic matter (ordinary matter composed of atoms). The atoms account for only 4.6% of the total energy density, or a density of one proton per four cubic meters. The density of the Universe, however, is clearly not uniform; it ranges from relatively high density in galaxies—including very high density in structures within galaxies, such as planets, stars, and black holes—to conditions in vast voids that have much lower density, {{at least in terms}} of visible matter. Unlike the matter and <b>dark</b> <b>matter,</b> the dark energy seems not to be concentrated in galaxies: although dark energy may account for a majority of the mass-energy in the Universe, dark energy's influence is 5 orders of magnitude smaller than the influence of gravity from matter and <b>dark</b> <b>matter</b> within the Milky Way.|$|E

5|$|Rubin's {{calculations}} {{showed that}} galaxies must contain {{at least five}} to ten times as much <b>dark</b> <b>matter</b> as ordinary matter. Rubin's results were confirmed over subsequent decades, {{and became the first}} persuasive results supporting the theory of <b>dark</b> <b>matter,</b> initially proposed by Fritz Zwicky in the 1930s. This data was confirmed by radio astronomers, the discovery of the cosmic microwave background, and images of gravitational lensing. Her research also prompted a theory of non-Newtonian gravity on galactic scales, but this theory has not been widely accepted by astrophysicists.|$|E

5|$|Fundamental to the {{structure}} of the Universe is the existence of <b>dark</b> <b>matter</b> and dark energy.

5|$|On {{the largest}} scale, the Universe is {{continually}} expanding, {{resulting in an}} average increase in the separation between individual galaxies (see Hubble's law). Associations of galaxies can overcome this expansion on a local scale through their mutual gravitational attraction. These associations formed early in the Universe, as clumps of <b>dark</b> <b>matter</b> pulled their respective galaxies together. Nearby groups later merged to form larger-scale clusters. This on-going merger process (as well as an influx of infalling gas) heats the inter-galactic gas within a cluster to very high temperatures, reaching 30–100 megakelvins. About 70–80% of the mass in a cluster {{is in the form}} of <b>dark</b> <b>matter,</b> with 10–30% consisting of this heated gas and the remaining few percent of the matter in the form of galaxies.|$|E
5|$|Plasma may be {{the most}} {{abundant}} form of ordinary matter in the universe, although this hypothesis is currently tentative based on the existence and unknown properties of <b>dark</b> <b>matter.</b> Plasma is mostly associated with stars, extending to the rarefied intracluster medium and possibly the intergalactic regions.|$|E
5|$|Precise modern {{models of}} the Big Bang appeal to various exotic {{physical}} phenomena {{that have not been}} observed in terrestrial laboratory experiments or incorporated into the Standard Model of particle physics. Of these features, <b>dark</b> <b>matter</b> is currently subjected to the most active laboratory investigations. Remaining issues include the cuspy halo problem and the dwarf galaxy problem of cold <b>dark</b> <b>matter.</b> Dark energy is also an area of intense interest for scientists, {{but it is not clear}} whether direct detection of dark energy will be possible. Inflation and baryogenesis remain more speculative features of current Big Bang models. Viable, quantitative explanations for such phenomena are still being sought. These are currently unsolved problems in physics.|$|E

5|$|Spiral galaxies {{resemble}} spiraling pinwheels.

5|$|The Universe is {{composed}} almost completely of dark energy, <b>dark</b> <b>matter,</b> and ordinary matter. Other contents are electromagnetic radiation (estimated {{to be from}} 0.005% to close to 0.01%) and antimatter. The total amount of electromagnetic radiation generated within the universe has decreased by 1/2 in the past 2 billion years.|$|E
5|$|The {{proportions}} {{of all types}} of matter and energy have changed over the history of the Universe. Today, ordinary matter, which includes atoms, stars, galaxies, and life, accounts for only 4.9% of the contents of the Universe. The present overall density of this type of matter is very low, roughly 4.5 × 10−31 grams per cubic centimetre, corresponding to a density of the order of only one proton for every four cubic meters of volume. The nature of both dark energy and <b>dark</b> <b>matter</b> is unknown. <b>Dark</b> <b>matter,</b> a mysterious form of matter that has not yet been identified, accounts for 26.8% of the contents. Dark energy, which is the energy of empty space and is causing the expansion of the Universe to accelerate, accounts for the remaining 68.3% of the contents.|$|E
