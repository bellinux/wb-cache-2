The gauge was to be , it is not clear who chose this, or why. A contract for the construction of the formation was let to Hugh McIntosh of London in June 1820, for 9s 3d per yard; {{it was to be a}} single line with a number of passing sidings (referred to as [...] "turnouts")—two per mile. Some sidings — at least at Roborough and Yelverton — were to be constructed of granite blocks dressed to as to provide a <b>flange</b> <b>guide,</b> similar to the construction of the main line of the Haytor Granite Tramway.|$|E

With no immediate intervention to rehabilitate the patient, definitive mandibular guidance prostheses with a metal <b>guiding</b> <b>flange</b> and acrylic teeth on the resected side can be used successfully to stabilize the occlusion and correct the deviation. The present case report describes the prosthodontic rehabilitation of a patient with a segmental mandibulectomy using a mandibular prosthesis with a metal <b>guide</b> <b>flange</b> and a maxillary stabilizing metal framework...|$|R
50|$|Missiles use hangers {{to mount}} to a rack which, in cross section, {{resemble}} either a T-bar called an internal T-shaped hanger or resemble a horseshoe called an external U-shaped shoe. Ambiguously, hangers are also {{often referred to}} as lugs or hooks.The majority of launchers can also be referred to as rail launchers because of the use of external rail <b>flanges,</b> a <b>guide</b> for the missile suspension hangers during firing.|$|R
50|$|Trains and trams {{can turn}} corners without wheel-slip because the outer {{horizontal}} {{part of the}} wheels has a slightly tapered rim. The <b>guide</b> <b>flange</b> (ridge) is on the inside to prevent the vehicle from slipping sideways off the rails. The horizontal (cone-shaped) rim makes contact with the slightly convex top of a steel rail in different (horizontal) places so that the outer wheel has a larger effective diameter than the inner wheel.|$|R
6000|$|Railways existed {{long before}} the Iron Horse was born. They sprang into being two centuries ago {{in the form of}} tramways, which at first were nothing more or less than planks or rails of timber laid down between the Newcastle-on-Tyne collieries and the river, for the purpose of forming a better [...] "way" [...] over which to run the coal-trucks. From simple timber-rails men soon {{advanced}} to planks having a strip of iron nailed on their surface to prevent too rapid tear and wear, but it was not till the year 1767 that cast-iron rails were introduced. In order to prevent the trucks from slipping off the line the rails were cast with an upright <b>flange</b> or <b>guide</b> at one side, and were laid on wooden or stone sleepers.|$|R
40|$|Mandibular {{resection}} following {{surgical treatment}} for neoplastic lesions {{of the oral}} cavity leads to numerous complications including altered mandibular movements, disfigurement, difficult in swallowing, impaired speech and articulation, and deviation of the mandible towards the resected site. Various prosthetic methods are employed to reduce or minimize mandibular deviation and improve and restore the lost functions and esthetic, like maxillomandibular fixation, implant supported prosthesis, removable mandibular <b>guide</b> <b>flange</b> prosthesis, and palatal based guidance restoration.

40|$|Treating diverse maxillofacial {{patients}} poses {{a challenge}} to the maxillofacial prosthodontist. Rehabilitation of hemimandibulectomy patients must aim at restoring mastication and other functions such as intelligible speech, swallowing, and esthetics. Prosthetic methods such as palatal ramp and mandibular <b>guiding</b> <b>flange</b> reposition the deviated mandible. Such prosthesis {{can also be used to}} restore speech in case of patients with debilitating speech following surgical resection. This clinical report gives detail of a hemimandibulectomy patient provided with an interim removable dental speech prosthesis with composite resin flange for mandibular guidance therapy...|$|R
40|$|Treatment of {{benign and}} {{malignant}} tumors may involve surgical resection of the mandible, {{which may be}} segmental or hemisectioned. The prosthetic rehabilitation of resected mandible becomes difficult when preprosthetic planning is not considered. Preprosthetic plastic surgery and/or implant assisted overdenture may enhance the prosthetic rehabilitation of edentulous patients who have undergone resection of the mandible. Due to medical conditions, unwillingness for additional surgery or economical restraints, the treatment is limited to guidance flange prosthesis. The guidance flange prosthesis helps in directing the deviating mandible to improve form and function. This case report describes a procedure for fabricating customized <b>guiding</b> <b>flange</b> prosthesis to rehabilitate edentulous segmental mandibulectomy...|$|R
40|$|Segmental {{resection}} of the mandible generally {{results in}} deviation of the mandible to the defective side. This loss of {{continuity of the}} mandible destroys {{the balance of the}} lower face and leads to decreased mandibular function by deviation of the residual segment toward the surgical site. Prosthetic methods advocated to reduce or eliminate mandibular deviation include intermaxillary fixation, removable mandibular <b>guide</b> <b>flange,</b> palatal ramp, implant-supported prosthesis and palatal guidance restorations which may be useful in reducing mandibular deviation and improving masticatory performance and efficiency. These methods and restorations would be combined with a well organized mandibular exercise regimen. This clinical report describes the rehabilitation following segmental mandibulectomy using palatal ramp prosthesis...|$|R
40|$|Surgical {{resection}} of the mandible due to {{presence of}} benign or malignant tumor {{is the most}} common cause of the mandibular deviation. Depending upon the location and extent of the tumor in the mandible, various surgical treatment modalities like marginal, segmental, hemi, subtotal, or total mandibulectomy can be performed. The clinicians must wait for extensive period of time for completion of healing and acceptance of the osseous graft before considering the definitive prosthesis. During this initial healing period prosthodontic intervention is required for preventing the mandibular deviation. This case report describes early prosthodontic management of a patient who has undergone a reconstructed hemi-mandibulectomy with modified mandibular <b>guide</b> <b>flange</b> prosthesis. The prosthesis helps patient moving the mandible normally without deviation during functions like speech and mastication...|$|R
40|$|Loss of mandibular {{continuity}} {{results in}} deviation of remaining mandibular segment toward the resected side {{primarily because of}} the loss of tissue involved in the surgical resection. The success in rehabilitating a patient with hemimandibulectomy depends upon {{the nature and extent of}} the surgical defect, treatment plan, type of prosthesis, and patient co-operation. The earlier the mandibular guidance therapy is initiated in the course of treatment; the more successful is the patient′s definitive occlusal relationship. Prosthodontic treatment coupled with an exercise program helps in reducing mandibular deviation and improving masticatory efficiency.

50|$|A {{railroad}} car's {{wheels are}} guided along the tracks by coning of the wheels. Only {{in extreme cases}} does it rely on the flanges located on the insides of the wheels. When the wheels reach the switch, the wheels are guided along the route determined by {{which of the two}} points is connected to the track facing the switch. In the illustration, if the left point is connected, the left wheel will be guided along the rail of that point, and the train will diverge to the right. If the right point is connected, the right wheel's <b>flange</b> will be <b>guided</b> along the rail of that point, and the train will continue along the straight track. Only one of the points may be connected to the facing track at any time; the two points are mechanically locked together to ensure that this is always the case.|$|R
2500|$|A non-magnetic, non-electric, hand-powered tape {{recorder}} was patented {{by two of}} the Volta associates in 1886 (...) [...] The tape was a 3/16inch (4.8mm) wide strip of paper coated by dipping it in a solution of beeswax and paraffin and then scraping one side clean before the coating had set. The machine, of sturdy wood and metal construction, was hand-powered by means of a knob fastened to a flywheel. The tape passed from one eight inch (20.3cm) diameter reel and around a pulley with <b>guide</b> <b>flanges,</b> where it came into contact with either the recording or playback stylus. It was then wound onto a second reel. The sharp recording stylus, actuated by a sound-vibrated mica diaphragm, engraved a groove into the wax coating. In playback mode, a dull, loosely mounted stylus attached to a rubber diaphragm rode in the recorded groove. The reproduced sound was heard through rubber listening tubes like those of a stethoscope.|$|R
5000|$|The {{earliest}} known {{audio tape}} recorder was a non-magnetic, non-electric version invented by Alexander Graham Bell's Volta Laboratory and patented in 1886 (...) [...] It employed a 3/16 in strip of wax-covered paper that was coated by dipping it {{in a solution}} of beeswax and paraffin and then had one side scraped clean, with the other side allowed to harden. The machine was of sturdy wood and metal construction, and hand-powered {{by means of a}} knob fastened to the flywheel. The wax strip passed from one eight-inch reel around the periphery of a pulley (with <b>guide</b> <b>flanges)</b> mounted above the V-pulleys on the main vertical shaft, where it came in contact with either its recording or playback stylus. The tape was then taken up on the other reel. The sharp recording stylus, actuated by a vibrating mica diaphragm, cut the wax from the strip. In playback mode, a dull, loosely mounted stylus, attached to a rubber diaphragm, carried the reproduced sounds through an ear tube to its listener.|$|R
25|$|Proper {{tracking}} {{of the blade}} is crucial to accurate cutting and considerably reduces blade breakage. The first step to ensuring good tracking is to check that the two bandwheels or flywheels are co-planar. This {{can be done by}} placing a straightedge across the front of the wheels and adjusting until each wheel touches. Rotate the wheels with the blade in position and properly tensioned and check that the tracking is correct. Now install the blade guide rollers and leave a gap of about 1 mm between the back of the blade and the <b>guide</b> <b>flange.</b> The teeth of blades that have become narrow through repeated sharpening will foul the front edge of the guide rollers due to their kerf set and force the blade out of alignment. This can be remedied by cutting of a small step on the rollers' front edges to accommodate the protruding teeth. Ideally the rollers should be crowned, (see belt_and_pulley_systems) a configuration that assists in the proper {{tracking of}} bands and belts, at the same time allowing clearance for the set of the teeth.|$|R
40|$|A {{berthing}} mechanism {{especially for}} use in berthing and compliant air-tight securing between manned space vehicle and modules is disclosed. The interface is provided {{by a pair of}} annular rings, one of which is typically, mechanically attached to the vehicle and the other to the module to which it is to be docked and secured. One of the two rings is attached to a base by resilient bellows. The facing surface of one annular ring is joined to a base by a cable laced through alternating pulleys attached circumferentially so that the interface surface of that ring may be tilted to accommodate angular misalignment as the annular rings are brought into docking (berthing) contact. Interleaving <b>guide</b> <b>flanges</b> with chambered sides provide at least some rotational mialignmnet correction. A plurality of electromechanical actuator/attenuator units provide means for extending one annular ring toward the other {{in the final stages of}} docking, for absorbing the initial docking shock and for drawing the annular rings into tight interface contact. Locking hooks provide for securing the interfaces...|$|R

40|$|The patella groove {{of total}} knee {{replacements}} {{has evolved from}} a groove with a neutral orientation to a groove with a lateral (also referred to as valgus) orientation. In this study the authors questioned whether femoral components with a lateral groove orientation more closely approximate the configuration in the natural knee. The groove orientations of an implanted CKS femoral component, available in different sizes and with different groove orientations, were determined and compared with formerly published measurements of the natural trochlear orientation. It {{was found that the}} prosthetic groove orientations differed considerably from human anatomy, up to a maximum deviation of 6. 4 degrees. The orientations of the prosthetic grooves were all equal with{{in the area of the}} natural trochlea. The area of the natural trochlea guides the patella between about 30 degrees and 120 degrees of knee flexion. The orientations of the prosthetic grooves were different in the area of the supracondylar pouch/proximal anterior <b>flange.</b> This area <b>guides</b> the patella between about 0 degrees and 30 degrees of knee flexion.

40|$|The {{rapid growth}} of {{computing}} and information technology has enabled pervasive access to the World Wide Web. Over 280 EB of digital data has been generated {{from around the world}} and flowing in the digital universe; as a result, the need for data storage has grown rapidly. A variety of information storage solutions such as hard disk drive (HDD) products that are common information storages for personal computing are available in the market. Modern magnetic tape data storage in terms of its capacity and reliability has been employed as an ideal solution for enterprise-level storage of archival data with applications that include financial records, satellite images, and consumer databases. In magnetic tape technology, the thin, flexible media is transported between the supply and take up packs at a prescribed speed and tension, and over guides and the read/write head. As the tape is transported, in-plane vibration of axially moving tape, known as lateral tape motion (LTM), arises from excitation sources such as the run out of tape pack and impacts between the tape and the <b>flanges</b> on <b>guides</b> or packs. LTM has been identified as a major factor that degrades recording accuracy. Limiting the LTM is the one of the keys that enables the multi-terabytes data storage, and flanged roller guides are commonly implemented in modern tape drives. However, for higher recording density, thinner media is desirable. Reducing the thickness of media can significantly decrease its stiffness and increase the likelihood of damage to media edges by adjacent mechanical components on the guiding path. To avoid this, alternative tape guiding and actuation are required, and many advanced guiding mechanisms without the use of flanged guides have been developed to reduce lateral tape motion in industry and academia. The transverse force (tension) applied to the travelling tape is another key element of LTM dynamics and is controlled using the dynamics of tape pack driving sources in the modern tape drive products in using an open loop control logic. However, the developing advanced guiding and actuation technologies influence the tension irregularly and the current tension control algorithm is not able to handle the irregular changes of tension. An active tension control is required to feasibly advance LTM actuations. This thesis is motivated by the need for future engineering advances in guiding and actuation technologies for magnetic tape. Advanced guiding and actuation technologies have been developed to enable the active tension (transverse force) actuation of axially moving tape. An advanced tension actuation technology of axially moving media with dynamic tape path alternation using a novel rotary guider is considered in this thesis, and its effectiveness and technical feasibility is analysed in the context of actuating travelling tape tension. The specific issues addressed in this thesis are listed below. Development of linear magnetic tape transport system with an advanced active tension actuation. • A homemade linear magnetic tape transport system is developed. • The footsteps of development including technical design details of hardware and software are described. • A tape transport system that enables an actuation of travelling tape tension with dynamic tape path alternation using a novel rotary guider was purposely developed. • The tension is regulated actuating the amount of surface friction force between the tape and the rotary guider by altering the tape path dynamically rotating the rotary guider based on the feedback from strain gauge based tension sensor. Experimental studies of travelling tape tension shift phenomena with fixed tape path. • Parameter studies are carried to investigate the transitions of travelling tape tension during the tape transport process with the fixed angle of rotary guider (fixed tape path) in the travelling speed of tape and the angle of rotary guider. • Through experimental studies, it is found that the tension gradually increases as the tape is transported and the state of change in tension is heavily relay on the dynamics of tape pack driving source. • The angle of rotary guider shifts the level of tension. Generally, higher rotation angle of the rotary guider and the travelling speed of tape apply greater tension to the tape. Transverse force regulation with dynamic tape path alternation. • The effectiveness of tension regulation with dynamic tape path alternation using the rotary guider is investigated through experimental studies. • A closed loop control algorism of rotary guider controller is developed in order to control the operations of the rotary guider and implemented to the tape transport system. • The developed controller has a significant influence to the transition of tension. • The travelling tape tension is successfully regulated as targeted with the designed controller. It can be concluded that the rotary guider with a closed loop control algorism has an ability to actuate the travelling tape tension without relying on the dynamics of tape pack driving sources to control the tension...|$|R
