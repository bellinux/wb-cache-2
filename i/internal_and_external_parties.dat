40|$|The {{most common}} {{challenges}} and obstacles encountered by construction organizations {{during the process}} of implementing and using environmental management systems are related to the inherent peculiarities of the construction sector. Several studies have shown that one of the issues involving the greatest level of uncertainty is the identification and assessment of environmental impacts. In order to improve the identification of the significance of environmental impacts of construction projects and sites, which will lead to greater efficiency and robustness in environmental management systems, this paper extends the systematic approach for identifying and assessing potential adverse environmental impacts at the pre-construction stage presented in Gangolells et al. (2009) by introducing the assessment of the concerns of interested parties. By considering concerns amongst <b>internal</b> <b>and</b> <b>external</b> interested <b>parties,</b> one can assess the significance of environmental impacts taking into account not only the severity of the impacts but also local perceptions and international challenges, thereby ensuring that the determination of the impacts’ significance is appropriate to the particular socioeconomic and biophysical environments surrounding construction sites. In order to quantitatively measure concerns among <b>internal</b> <b>and</b> <b>external</b> interested <b>parties</b> for each of the 37 environmental impacts related to a construction project, we developed corresponding indicators and assessment scales {{with the help of a}} panel of experts. A series of χ 2 tests conducted over 76 new-start construction projects clearly revealed that the severity of environmental impacts is not correlated with the concerns of interested parties. The development of a formal quantitative method and the subsequent definition of a threshold make it possible to obtain advance knowledge of the significance – and, therefore, the acceptability – of each potential environmental impact for a particular construction project. A total score for each construction project alternative is also obtained, so the improved methodology provides a consistent basis for comparing construction companies and construction sites. Finally, two case studies are presented in order to demonstrate the benefits of the improved methodology. Peer ReviewedPostprint (author's final draft...|$|R

A fair agent cares to some extent {{for the well-being of}} other people and thus he also cares for the principal. Therefore, if the agent performs solitary work, the principal is always better off to hire a fair agent. However, we show that when a third party with conflicting interests is introduced, it may be advantageous for the principal to hire a selfish agent. The reason is that the selfish agent will be a tough bargainer not only when negotiating his employment contract with the principal but also when dealing with the third party, e. g., when selling the principal’s product to a buyer.

This vision aims for dynamic ad hoc collaborations between different business partners and entities. In order to achieve the (semi-) automatic composition of Web services to business processes and workflows, it is necessary to identify the appropriate services. Unfortunately, a syntactic description of a Web service’s capabilities is sufficient only if all potential parties (i. e., service providers, service brokers, and service requesters) use the exact same vocabulary. However, this is quite unlikely even in a corporate environment. Therefore, it is necessary to enrich Web service descriptions with semantic annotations and use them in the discovery process. Even though the retrieval of Web services based on semantic information has already been investigated in several approaches, differences in Web service standards and the repositories used for the evaluation of these approaches has led to both a lack of in-depth evaluations and comparability of the proposals.

In order to allay the apprehension that may accompany such change, curriculum development and implementation should be an inclusive process, with both staff and students being well informed of the planned reform. In 2001, the Nelson R. Mandela School of Medicine implemented Year 1 of a problem-based learning curriculum. During the design phase, students and staff were invited {{to take part in}} the development and were kept abreast of developments through meetings and newsletters. Method A survey of Years 1 – 5 students of the last intake into the traditional curriculum was undertaken a few months prior to the implementation of the new programme. Results Students were generally well informed about the impending change, having heard about it from fellow students and staff. The more senior the students, the less the perceived impact of the reform. Although most of what students had heard was correct, some, however, had misconceptions that were generally extreme views (e. g. all self-directed learning; no Anatomy) about the new programme. Others expressed valid concerns (e. g. underpreparedness of students from disadvantaged schools; overcrowding in hospitals). Conclusions Advice offered to institutions considering curriculum reform include using various methods to inform <b>internal</b> <b>and</b> <b>external</b> affected <b>parties,</b> ensuring that the student representative body and staff is well informed, reiterating the need for the change, confirming that the new programme meets recognised standards and that the students most affected are reassured about their future studies. </p...|$|R

The foundation {{of the work is}} the threat reduction strategies that are derived from formalizing and identifying the interaction between <b>internal</b> users <b>and</b> <b>external</b> <b>parties.</b> Internet access model is developed to facilitate this task. Mechanism of active firewall are divided into two main process i. e. initialisation and runtime process. The former process deals with the mechanism to start up and bring the active firewall into a point of its operation. Three approaches are introduced, namely open condition, close condition and lattice-based method. The open condition and close condition set the firewall into its extreme condition i. e. to open all available communication line or to close all connection respectively, while the lattice-based method affords to bring firewall into its optimum level to protect the intranet by establishing Internet connection based on the predetermined security level. In the runtime process, three methods are introduced as well i. e. adaptively updating security policy using fuzzy reasoning, detecting suspicious process using distributed agent-based module, and zero-based approach to have minimal network services at runtime. Besides analysing each method using its own parameters such as processing time, accuracy and speed for organizing canals, global evaluations were also held to investigate the protection can be delivered to the intranet. In this evaluation, security analysis and comparative study is held, in which each initialisation and runtime process are combined and analysed using three parameters that are created based on RFC 2979 i. e. probability of available network services, probability of exposed line, and denial of services.

It finds that the conceptualization of <b>parties</b> under <b>internal</b> <b>and</b> <b>external</b> pressures in competitive party systems can be a useful framework to understand the constraints faced by parties in new democracies contemplating legal and constitutional reforms as a way to deepen democracy. The dual party framework focuses on the significance of the institutional (identity and party unity) and rational concerns of parties (electoral success) during democratization, at the same time that it integrates the role of the military in mediating the interplay between the <b>internal</b> <b>and</b> <b>external</b> challenges for <b>parties.</b> On the basis of the insights derived from the political party literature and democratization studies, the thesis identifies the formation of political identity as the major internal challenge for parties as they attempt to institutionalize themselves in the context of revitalized electoral competition. A politically autonomous military constitutes the principle <b>external</b> challenge for <b>parties</b> particularly in the presence of "anti-system" actors. The study then traces the formation and development of political identities by the three major Turkish parties that held power between 1983 and 1995. In particular, it analyzes how these pressures unfolded for party leaders as they confronted a controversial dilemma of reconciling democratization with the maintenance of stability due to the ethnic separatist threat, and to a lesser extent, religious fundamentalism. The study demonstrates that while the Turkish party leaders used democratization agendas as an image building' strategy in the formation of their parties' political identities, their capacity to formulate and implement clear, coherent and consistent democratization reform strategies was hampered by the problems they faced in meeting...|$|R
