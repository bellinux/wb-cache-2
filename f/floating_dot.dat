Using a tool to reach farther than normal recalibrates {{previously}} unreachable space as peripersonal, evidenced by Intraparietal Sulcus (IPS) activity related to hand perception and lateral biases during line bisection. The current study looked at {{the role of a}} visual connection between the hand and body in the ability to manipulate objects within the extended area of reach. In an immersive virtual environment, participants bisected lines using a connected hand (via arm), a disconnected hand, or a <b>floating</b> <b>dot.</b> A rightward shift in bisection was seen only for the dot condition for far lines, indicating that it was the only "tool" incapable of extending peripersonal space...|$|E
40|$|With {{the advent}} of widely-accepted eBusiness activities, many banks have <b>floated</b> <b>dot.</b> com {{entities}} to create a presence on the Internet {{and take advantage of}} its power and reach. Like many other businesses, banks expected an increase in market capitalisation {{as a result of their}} <b>dot.</b> com <b>floats,</b> perceived broadly as a measure of growing profitability. Despite the negative publicity that the recent spate of dot. com crashes has generated, banks seem to continue floating online spin-offs. Our exploratory study investigates this phenomenon, studying the drivers for change in the evolution of the banking sector, and the move towards electronic banking. We focussed on two economies – Australia and India – to aggregate the major factors in this evolution from the perspective of two disparate economies. The paper describes our qualitative, document-based investigation of the Australian and Indian banking sectors, and subsequent quantitative analysis of the impact of <b>dot.</b> com <b>floats</b> on market capitalisation within this market sector. We then describe the effect of applying both Transaction Cost Economics to our findings, which indicates that the cost of transacting business has been reduced overall by the creation of dot. com entities; and “catch-up, fall-behind, forge ahead” theory to gain an economic perspective. The paper provides both practical assistance for banks in making decisions regarding e-portfolios, as well as for policy makers in the economies reviewed; and has the potential to contribute to academic research into eBanking more generally. <br /...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} presents electroluminescent (EL) and {{nonvolatile memory}} devices fabricated using pseudomorphic ZnCdSe-based cladded quantum dots (QDs). These dots were grown using our own in-school built novel reactor. The EL device was fabricated on a substrate of ITO (indium tin oxide) coated glass with the quantum dots sandwiched between anode and cathode contacts {{with a small}} barrier layer {{on top of the}} QDs. The importance of these cladded dots is to increase the quantum yield of device. This device is unique as they utilize quantum dots that are pseudomorphic (nearly lattice-matched core and the shell of the dot). In the case of <b>floating</b> quantum <b>dot</b> gate nonvolatile memory, cladded ZnCdSe quantum dots are deposited on single crystalline gate insulator (ZnMgS/ZnMgSe), which is grown using metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD). The control gate dielectric layer of the nonvolatile memory is Si 3 N 4 or SiO 2 and is grown using plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD). The cladded dots are grown using an improved methodology of photo-assisted microwave plasma metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (PMP-MOCVD) enhanced reactor. The cladding composition of the core and shell of the dots was engineered by the help of ultraviolet light which changed the incorporation of zinc (and hence composition of ZnCdSe). This makes ZnxCd 1 –xSe-ZnyCd 1 –y Se QDs to have a low composition of zinc in the core than the cladding (...|$|R

The non-DX model is fitted with a standard Ibanez <b>floating</b> bridge and <b>dot</b> inlays.It also has the coil configuration similar to the RG series that is the H-S-H coil configuration,but the pickups are different.The RG series guitars use pickups like Di'Marzio ,Air Norton, Blue Velvet, Tone Zone or EMG 81,85,60,707 or 808.While the gio series use Ibanez Infinity R(H) for neck humbucker,Ibanez Infinity RS(S) for middle single coil and Ibanez Infinity R(H) for bridge humbucker ...|$|R

40|$|Quantum dot channel (QDC) and Quantum dot gate (QDG) {{field effect}} {{transistors}} (FETs) have been fabricated on crystalline Si and poly Si thin films using cladded Si and Ge quantum dots. In particular, this thesis presents modeling and fabrication of quantum dot channel field effect transistors (QDC-FETs) using cladded Ge quantum dots on poly-Si thin films grown on silicon-on-insulator (SOI) substrates. HfAlO 2 high-k dielectric layers {{are used for}} the gate dielectric. QDC-FETs exhibit multi-state I-V characteristics which enable 2 -bit processing, and reduce FET count and power dissipation, {{and are expected to}} make {{a significant impact on the}} digital circuit design. Germanium quantum dot QDC-FETs provide higher electron mobility than conventional polysilicon FETs, which is comparable to crystalline silicon. Quantum dot channel FETs are also configured as <b>floating</b> gate quantum <b>dot</b> nonvolatile memories (QDC-QDNVMs). In NVMs, we use floating gate comprising of GeOx-Ge quantum dots. QD nonvolatile memories (QD-NVMs) are fabricated on crystalline silicon substrates. HfAlO 2 high-k insulator layers are used for both tunnel gate oxide as well as control gate dielectric. QDC-NVMs not only provide significantly higher drain current ID, but also higher threshold voltage shifts (DVTH), and exhibit potential for fabricating multi-bit nonvolatile memories...|$|R
