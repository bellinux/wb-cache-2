40|$|We {{propose a}} new type of {{morphological}} instability in the diffusion-limited growth of faceted crystals from the vapor phase that can explain the formation of thin ice plates at temperatures near - 15 C. The instability appears when the attachment kinetics for facet growth depends strongly on the morphology of the facet surface. In particular, we propose that the condensation coefficient for growth of <b>ice</b> <b>prism</b> facets increases dramatically when the width of the facet approaches atomic dimensions. This model reconciles several conflicting measurements of ice crystal growth, and makes additional predictions for future growth experiments. Other faceted crystalline materials may exhibit similar morphological instabilities that promote the diffusion-limited growth of thin plate-like or needle-like crystal structures...|$|E
40|$|We present {{observations}} {{of the formation of}} plate-like snow crystals that provide evidence for an edge-enhancing crystal growth instability. This instability arises when the condensation coefficient describing the growth of an <b>ice</b> <b>prism</b> facet increases as the width of the facet becomes narrower. Coupled with the effects of particle diffusion, this phenomenon causes thin plate-like crystals to develop from thicker prisms, sharpening the edges of the plates to micron or sub-micron dimensions as they grow. This sharpening effect is largely responsible for the formation of thin plate-like ice crystals from water vapor near - 15 C, which is a dominant feature in the snow crystal morphology diagram. Other faceted crystalline materials may exhibit similar morphological growth instabilities that promote the diffusion-limited growth of plate-like or needle-like structures...|$|E
50|$|As light {{passes through}} the 60° apex angle of the {{hexagonal}} <b>ice</b> <b>prisms</b> it is deflected twice resulting in deviation angles ranging from 22° to 50°. The angle of minimum deviation is almost 22° (or more specifically 21.84° on average; 21.54° for red light and 22.37° for blue light). This wavelength-dependent variation in refraction causes the inner {{edge of the circle}} to be reddish while the outer edge is bluish.|$|R
40|$|Scattering by {{infinite}} hexagonal <b>ice</b> <b>prisms</b> {{is calculated}} using Maxwell's equations in the discrete dipole approximation for size parameters up to x= 400. Birefringence {{is included in}} the calculations. Applicability of the geometric optics approximation is investigated. Excellent agreement between wave optics and geometric optics is observed for large size parameter in the outer part of the 22 degree halo feature. For smaller ice crystals halo broadening is predicted, and there is appreciable "spillover" of the halo into shadow scattering angles < 22 degrees. Ways to retrieve ice crystal sizes are suggested based on the full width at half-maximum of the halo, the power at < 22 deg, and the halo polarization...|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} produce {{artificial}} halos such as the tangent arcs or the circumscribed halo one should rotate a single columnar hexagonal crystal about 2 axes. Similarly, the Lowitz arcs can be created by rotating a single plate crystal about two axes. This {{can be done by}} engineered halo machines. The first such machine was constructed in 2003; several more followed. Putting such machines inside spherical projection screens, and by the principle of the so-called sky transform, the analogy is nearly perfect. A realization using micro-versions of the aforementioned machines produces authentic distortion-free projections of such complex artificial halos. Finally, superposition of several images and projections produced by such halo machines may be combined to create a single image. The resulting superposition image is then a representation of complex natural halo displays containing many different orientation sets of <b>ice</b> <b>prisms.</b>|$|R
40|$|Experimental {{results show}} that fish {{antifreeze}} glycopeptides (AFGPs) 8 and 7 (with 4 and 5 repeats respectively of the Ala-Ala-Thr backbone sequence) bond onto <b>ice</b> <b>prism</b> planes aligned along a-axes, and inhibit crystal growth on prism planes and on surfaces close to that orientation. The 9. 31 -A repeat spacing of the AFGP in the polyproline II helix configuration, deduced from NMR studies, matches twice the repeat spacing of ice in the deduced alignment direction, 9. 038 A, within 3 %. A specific binding model is proposed for the AFGP and for the alpha-helical antifreeze peptide of winter flounder. For AFGP 7 - 8, two hydroxyl groups of each disaccharide (one disaccharide is attached to each threonine) reside within the ice surface, {{so that they are}} shared between the ice crystal and the disaccharide. This provides 24 hydrogen bonds between AFGP 8 and the ice and 30 for AFGP 7, explaining why the chemical adsorption is virtually irreversible and the crystal growth can be stopped virtually completely. The same scheme of sharing polar groups with the ice works well with the alpha-helical antifreeze of winter flounder, for which an amide as well as several hydroxyls are shared. The sharing of polar groups with the ice crystal, rather than hydrogen-bonding to the ice surface, may be a general requirement for adsoprtion-inhibition of freezing...|$|E
40|$|We {{examine the}} {{physical}} mechanisms governing {{the formation of}} snow crystals, treating this problem {{as a case study}} of the dynamics of crystal growth from the vapour phase. Particular attention is given to the basic theoretical underpinnings of the subject, especially the interplay of particle diffusion, heat diffusion and surface attachment kinetics during crystal growth, as well as growth instabilities that have important effects on snow crystal development. The first part of this review focuses on understanding the dramatic variations seen in snow crystal morphology as a function of temperature, a mystery that has remained largely unsolved since its discovery 75 years ago. To this end we examine the growth of simple hexagonal <b>ice</b> <b>prisms</b> in considerable detail, comparing crystal growth theory with laboratory measurements of growth rates under a broad range of conditions. This {{turns out to be a}} surprisingly rich problem, which ultimately originates from the unusual molecular structure of the ice surface and its sensitive dependence on temperature. With new clues from precision measurements of attachment kinetics, we are now just beginning to understand these structural changes at the ice surface and how they affect the crystal growth process. We also touch upon the mostl...|$|R
40|$|The weather {{conditions}} from September to January {{in the vicinity}} of the Mizuho Plateau, the area between the coast and 72 °S, are discussed on the basis of the weather observations made during the traverses of JARE- 10 (the 10 th Japanese Antarctic Research Expedition) in 1969 - 70 and the previous traverses. The mean wind speed of about 8 - 10 m/s is obtained from the observations. It is found that the observed orientations of sastrugis and pitted patterns show seasonal variations. The wind direction is constant in inland, but diurnal variations of the wind direction were observed. When the wind direction changes counterclockwise to the north from the prevailing wind direction, it can be expected that weather is getting worse. The flow lines of the prevailing winds {{in the vicinity of}} the Mizuho Plateau are drawn from the orientations of sastrugis and other features. The pressure variation in inland about 350 km distant from Syowa Station was similar to that at Syowa Station. Sea-salt particles were detected at 71 °S and 43 °E during a light snow or <b>ice</b> <b>prisms</b> falling when the wind was weak with its direction changing counterclockwise from the prevailing wind direction...|$|R

40|$|Spaceborne millimeter-wave radiometric {{measurements}} {{offer the}} potential to observe snowfall at high latitudes. A spaceborne W-band cloud radar on CloudSat {{has been able to}} observe snow. There is thus a need for a relatively simple representation of millimeter-wave scattering parameters of snow that can be incorporated into algorithms to retrieve snowfall from remotely sensed millimeter-wave brightness tem-perature measurements and for computing the millimeter-wave backscatter phase function of randomly oriented aggregates of <b>ice</b> <b>prisms</b> or columns. The extinction coefficients, asymmetry factors, and backscatter phase functions describing scattering by randomly oriented aggregates of elongated cylinders were computed from the discrete dipole approxima-tion. These parameters were also computed by means of a T-matrix model applied to single blunt cylinders by employing a phase delay that only depended on the frequency and the ratio of the volume to the projected area of the cylindrical aggregates. These scattering parameters were fitted by empirical analytical functions that only depended on that phase delay. This permitted consideration of numerous aggregate shapes with far less computational effort than that required by the discrete dipole approximation. The results of this analysis were applied to measurements of millimeter-wave extinction, radar reflectiv-ity, and snow size distributions obtained during the SNOW-TWO field experiment conducted by the U. S. Army in 1984. Although the simultaneity of the various measurements was not well documented, the theoretical results fell within the range of measurement uncertainty. Model results of the extinction coef-ficient and asymmetry factor needed to compute 183 -GHz brightness temperatures measured by the NOAA Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit-B (AMSU-B) radiometers are presented in the appendix. 1...|$|R

40|$|Antifreeze {{proteins}} (AFPs) protect certain cold-adapted organisms from freezing {{to death}} by selectively adsorbing to internal ice crystals and inhibiting ice propagation. The molecular details of AFP adsorption-inhibition is uncertain but is proposed to involve the Gibbs-Thomson effect. Here we show by using unbiased molecular dynamics simulations a protein structure-function mechanism for the spruce budworm Choristoneura fumiferana AFP, including stereo-specific binding and consequential melting and freezing inhibition. The protein binds indirectly to the <b>prism</b> <b>ice</b> face through a linear array of ordered water molecules that are structurally distinct from the ice. Mutation of the ice binding surface disrupts water-ordering and abolishes activity.

40|$|Sub-zero {{temperatures}} pose a {{major threat}} to the survival of cold-climate perennials. Some of these freeze-tolerant plants produce ice-binding proteins (IBPs) that offer frost protection by restricting ice crystal growth and preventing expansion-induced lysis of the plasma membranes. Despite the extensive in vitro characterization of such proteins, the importance of IBPs in the freezing stress response has not been investigated. Using the freeze-tolerant grass and model crop, Brachypodium distachyon, we characterized putative IBPs (BdIRIs) and generated the first 'IBP-knockdowns'. Seven IBP sequences were identified and expressed in Escherichia coli, with all of the recombinant proteins demonstrating moderate to high levels of ice-recrystallization inhibition (IRI) activity, low levels of thermal hysteresis (TH) activity (0. 03 - 0. 09 °C at 1 mg/mL) and apparent adsorption to <b>ice</b> primary <b>prism</b> planes. Following plant cold acclimation, IBPs purified from wild-type B. distachyon cell lysates similarly showed high levels of IRI activity, hexagonal ice-shaping, and low levels of TH activity (0. 15 °C at 0. 5 mg/mL total protein). The transfer of a microRNA construct to wild-type plants resulted in the attenuation of IBP activity. The resulting knockdown mutant plants had reduced ability to restrict ice-crystal growth and a 63 % reduction in TH activity. Additionally, all transgenic lines were significantly more vulnerable to electrolyte leakage after freezing to - 10 °C, showing a 13 - 22 % increase in released ions compared to wild-type. IBP-knockdown lines also demonstrated a significant decrease in viability following freezing to - 8 °C, with some lines showing only two-thirds the survival seen in control lines. These results underscore the vital role IBPs play {{in the development of a}} freeze-tolerant phenotype and suggests that expression of these proteins in frost-susceptible plants could be valuable for the production of more winter-hardy crops...|$|R
