5|$|Tanasescu {{explores the}} idea of rights for nature, an idea which, though unorthodox, has seen success in implementation. He first {{introduces}} the concept, {{with a focus on}} the differences between moral and legal rights, before examining the particular case of Ecuador's entrenchment of rights for nature in its 2008 constitution, which is compared with other real-world cases. He finally addresses what can be learnt from these theoretical and practical considerations. He concludes that much work on the topic is left to be done, but the key lesson to be learnt <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>significance</b> <b>of</b> innovation; environmental politics, he claims, should remain both inventive and optimistic.

25|$|Traditionally, Restoration plays {{have been}} studied by genre rather than chronology, more or less {{as if they were}} all contemporary, but {{scholars}} today insist on the rapid evolvement of drama in the period and on the importance of social and political factors affecting it. (Unless otherwise indicated, the account below is based on Hume's influential Development of English Drama in the Late Seventeenth Century, 1976.) The influence of theatre company competition and playhouse economics is also acknowledged, as <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>significance</b> <b>of</b> the appearance of the first professional actresses (see Howe).|$|E
500|$|The film {{features}} dolphins as {{a recurring}} motif. Michael forms {{an obsession with}} dolphins and paints them all over his house, the street plan of Hillside is shown to form {{the shape of a}} dolphin {{at the end of the}} film. Nathan Baran of Hybrid Magazine was frustrated by the lack of explanation of the motif, saying: [...] "Never are dolphins discussed by anyone else to have any meaning whatsoever. [...] What <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>significance</b> <b>of</b> the dolphin as an image? [...] it is a completely arbitrary image awkwardly stuffed with forced meaning". Posin saw Hillside's formation of a dolphin shape as [...] "beauty and order to the chaos", illustrating Michael's belief in deep beauty where everybody else finds chaos.|$|E

2500|$|The {{purpose of}} {{ecological}} resilience that is proposed is ultimately about averting our extinction as Walker cites Holling in his paper: [...] " [...] "resilience {{is concerned with}} [...] the probabilities of extinction” (1973, p.20)". Becoming more apparent in academic writing <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>significance</b> <b>of</b> the environment and resilience in sustainable development.

6000|$|As to my opinion, then, {{namely that}} we cannot say what <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>significance</b> <b>of</b> an archaic pattern in Scotland, or elsewhere, though we may know the meaning {{assigned}} {{to it in}} Central Australia, there {{can no longer be}} any mistake. I take the blame of having misled Dr. Munro by an unguarded expression {{in a letter to the}} Society of Scottish Antiquaries, {67} saying that, if the disputed objects were genuine, they implied the survival, on Clyde, [...] "of a singularly archaic set of ritual and magical ideas," [...] namely those peculiar to the Arunta and Kaitish tribes of Central Australia. But that was a slip of the pen, merely.|$|E
60|$|The {{years of}} Turgot exactly bridge the {{interval}} between the ministry of the infamous Dubois and the ministry of the inglorious Calonne; between the despair and confusion of {{the close of the}} regency, and the despair and confusion of the last ten years of the monarchy. In 1727 we stand on the threshold of that far-resounding fiery workshop, where a hundred hands wrought the cunning implements and Cyclopean engines that were to serve in storming the hated citadels of superstition and injustice. In 1781 we emerge from these subterranean realms into the open air, to find ourselves surrounded by all the sounds and portents of imminent ruin. This, then, <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>significance</b> <b>of</b> the date of Turgot's birth.|$|E

5|$|The records {{also show}} {{that part of the}} parish of Navenby was {{enclosed}} in 1772.
