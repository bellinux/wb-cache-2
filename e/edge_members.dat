40|$|Based on {{a series}} of alternating, displacement-controlled load tests on ten one-third scale models, to study the {{behaviour}} of the interface of a hybrid shear wall system, it was proved that the concept of hybrid construction in earthquake prone regions is feasible. The hybrid shear-wall system consists of typical reinforced concrete shear walls with composite <b>edge</b> <b>members</b> or flanges. Ten different anchorage bar arrangements were developed and tested to evaluate the column-shearwall interface behaviour under cyclic shear forces acting along the interface between column and wall panel. Finite element models of the test specimens were developed that were capable of capturing the integrated concrete and reinforcing steel behaviour in the wall panels. Special models were  developed to capture the interface behaviour between the edge columns and the shear wall. A comparison between the experimental results and the numerical results shows excellent agreement, and clearly supports the validity of the model developed for predicting the non-linear response of the hybrid wall system under various load conditions...|$|E
40|$|Earthquake {{design of}} {{buildings}} involves {{the creation of}} a structural system capable of re-sisting the seismic forces in a ductile manner. Postearthquake observations have shown that the failure of many reinforced concrete buildings has been due to the inability of the lower-story columns to resist the earthquake imposed loads. Failure of these members are often related to an inappropriate layout of the reinforcement in the upper and lower regions of these columns (insufficient column-tie sizing and spacing, leading to tie failure as well as buckling of the longitudinal reinforcement). Considering these observations, a new hybrid structural system for both moment resistant frame and shearwall buildings, which was pro-posed by Bouwkamp 1990, has since been studied at the Darmstadt University of Technol-ogy. The system involves the use of prefabricated composite columns consisting of steel tubular thin-walled sections filled with concrete and typical reinforced concrete beam-slab floors. In case of shear walls, the composite columns are used as <b>edge</b> <b>members</b> of the con-crete shear walls. In principle, the steel tubular column section replaces effectively the lon-gitudinal column reinforcement and provides the confinement for the (core) concrete. Realizing that the connection between the composite columns and concrete beam-slab floo...|$|E
40|$|The {{installation}} of a composite skin panel on the cargo ramp of a CH- 530 marine helicopter is discussed.

The joint tests were used to determine bearing allowables and the required K/E skin gage. The K/E skin panels riveted to aluminum <b>edge</b> <b>members</b> were tested in a shear fixture to confirm the allowable shear and bearing strengths. Impact tests were conducted on aluminum skin panels to determine energy level and damage relationship.

The wings were set at a dihedral angle, each main spar being rigidly fixed to the main frame at the required angle. The rear spar was attached to the frame by means of a single horizontal bolt fixed parallel to the longitudinal axis of the fuselage, which allowed the wings a degree of freedom to flex vertically when wing-warping was applied.|$|R
