5|$|George was {{ridiculed}} by his British subjects; {{some of his}} contemporaries, such as Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, {{thought him}} unintelligent {{on the grounds that}} he was wooden in public. Though he was unpopular in Great Britain due to his supposed <b>inability</b> to speak English, such an <b>inability</b> may not have existed later in his reign as documents from that time show that he understood, spoke and wrote English. He certainly spoke fluent German and French, good Latin, and some Italian and Dutch. His treatment of his wife, Sophia Dorothea, became something of a scandal.|$|E

5000|$|The play’s {{language}} {{is derived from}} the conversation of several cultures, that all have their own subtle differences. Characters such as PKK and AAB use terms from both English and Kurdish like when PKK talks about his friends being tortured in a “patoz known as a threshing machine.” AAB acts as an interpreter for PKK and helps PKK understand that [...] "patoz" [...] in English means threshing machine, this language barrier makes the characters more realistic as actual people. Other characters have natural nuances such as the colonel's hesitance in his speech when he talks about uncomfortable subjects. “The… er… the… er… the penny dropped; these weren’t families at all… they were slaves.” Soans uses the colonel's language to illustrate the uncomfortable subject of war and its effects. Language is used to create realistic characters through their <b>inabilities</b> to speak perfect English and the <b>inabilities</b> to finish a sentence.|$|R

The global population is ageing {{and will continue to}} have communication <b>inabilities</b> unless barriers of communication with the elderly are more highly promoted.

30|$|Linearly {{separable}} subcode (LSSC) [25] was {{put forward}} {{to tackle the}} aforementioned <b>inabilities</b> of DBR and BRGC effectively in fully preserving the separation of feature points in the index domain when the eventual distance evaluation is performed in the Hamming domain. This code particularly utilizes redundancy to augment the separability in the Hamming space for enabling one-to-one correspondence between every non-reference codeword and the Hamming distance incurred with respect to every possible reference codeword.|$|R

Barr has stated that he will not run for public office in the future.|$|E
5|$|Cumberland's dismal winning {{percentage}} and the <b>inability</b> to field {{a team led}} to their disbanding {{at the end of}} the season.

5000|$|The {{elements}} of tragedy occur in Aston's climactic monologue about his shock treatments in [...] "that place" [...] {{and at the}} end of the play, though the ending is still somewhat ambiguous: at the very end, it appears that the brothers are turning Davies, an old homeless man, out of what may be his last chance for shelter, mainly because of his (and their) <b>inabilities</b> to adjust socially to one another, or their respective [...] "anti-social" [...] qualities.|$|R

40|$|Patients with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) {{suffer from}} <b>inabilities</b> such as {{weakness}} and muscle fatigue {{due to the}} demyelination. The <b>inabilities</b> may result in some disorders in walking. The present study is a clinical trial research conducted on 84 participants in two groups of experimental and control who were randomly selected. The results showed that people with MS apply more force on the ground during the three examined component of stance phase of gait cycle in comparison with those without the disease. Also, the maximum difference {{was found between the}} two groups at the mid-stance component that was the only stage in the stance phase in which, the difference between the groups was statistically significant. It can be concluded that the largest amount of pressure and force applied on the limbs of people with MS lies in the mid-stance component of stance phase. According to the results of the study, the lowest amount of force absorption occurs in that stage. The obtained results can be employed in order to design shoes of type suitable for people with MS that are capable to absorb extra vertical reaction force and thus, prevent skeletal-muscle damages...|$|R
