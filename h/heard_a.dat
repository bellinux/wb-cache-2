5|$|The {{court was}} formed when the District of Missouri {{was divided into}} East and West in 1857, and its {{boundaries}} have changed little since that division. In its history it has <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> number of important cases that {{made it to the}} United States Supreme Court, covering issues related to freedom of speech, abortion, property rights, and campaign finance. There are currently nine active judges, five judges in senior status, and seven magistrate judges attached to the court.|$|E
5|$|While {{a student}} he {{composed}} his first published works—his eight Préludes for piano (the earlier Le banquet céleste was published subsequently). These exhibit Messiaen's {{use of his}} modes of limited transposition and palindromic rhythms (Messiaen called these non-retrogradable rhythms). His public début came in 1931 with his orchestral suite Les offrandes oubliées. That year he first <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> gamelan group, sparking {{his interest in the}} use of tuned percussion.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{residents}} on farming properties {{to the west}} of York <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> large aircraft flying low over the area. The aircraft seemed to be in trouble because the noise from the engines was changing significantly. At times the engines seemed to be operating normally but on at least one occasion all engine noise ceased for a brief time and then returned as a very loud, high-pitched noise. One resident reported that when all engine noise ceased he could hear a rushing sound until the scream from the engines returned. Several residents reported seeing a bright flash of white light in the distance, followed by a loud crashing and scraping noise. Those closest to the crash could then see the yellow glow of a major fire.|$|E

5|$|After {{learning}} to speak English, the children– Ralph says just the surviving girl– {{explained that they}} came from a land where the sun never shone and the light was like twilight. William says the children called their home St Martin's Land; Ralph adds that everything there was green. According to William, the children were unable to account for their arrival in Woolpit; they had been herding their father's cattle when they <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> loud noise (according to William, the bells of Bury St Edmunds) and suddenly found themselves by the wolf pit where they were found. Ralph says that they had become lost when they followed the cattle into a cave and, after being guided {{by the sound of}} bells, eventually emerged into our land.|$|E

During an interview with People in 2008, Aguilera stated {{that she was going to}} start recording new material for her forthcoming album at her home in Beverly Hills. On the album, entitled Bionic, Aguilera was inspired by electronic and electronica music, which she <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> lot during her pregnancy.|$|E
5|$|After the massacre, General Henry Atkinson was {{informed}} that Dodge was to take over General Alexander Posey's brigade at Fort Hamilton. While Dodge {{was on his way}} to visit the brigade, he <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> rifle shot from a group of Native Americans. Dodge quickly returned to his command post and gathered as many men as he could to pursue the enemy. With Dodge in quick pursuit, a group of approximately 25 Native warriors criss-crossed the Pecatonica River until, finding flight hopeless, they prepared to make a stand at the Battle of Pecatonica.|$|E

5|$|Already as a teenager, Sorabji {{took great}} {{interest}} in recent developments in art music—in the work of Schoenberg, Scriabin, Mahler and Debussy, among others—at {{a time when they}} received scant attention in the United Kingdom. This interest, along with his ethnicity, cemented his reputation as an outsider. He and his music had their detractors, but some musicians received his work positively: Frederick Delius, who <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> 1930 radio broadcast of Sorabji playing his own piece Le jardin parfumé: Poem for Piano Solo, sent a letter of admiration to Sorabji; the French–Swiss pianist Alfred Cortot expressed interest in performing Sorabji's piano concertos; and Alban Berg reportedly took an interest in Sorabji's music.|$|E
5|$|Altgens {{tried to}} find a good camera angle on the bridge, but uniformed police said it was private {{property}} and turned him away, and he moved to a location within the plaza. He began photographing the motorcade on Main Street as the vehicles approached Houston Street, and got a close-up of the presidential limousine as it turned right onto Houston. He then picked up his equipment bag and ran on the grass toward the south curb along Elm Street, stopping across from the Plaza's north colonnade. Altgens <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> loud noise {{at about the same time}} as his first photograph from that spot (simultaneous to Zapruder film frame 255), but he did not recall having any reaction since he thought the noise came from a firecracker.|$|E
5|$|Although not {{licensed}} to practise {{medicine in the}} United States, he began testing the boxes on human beings diagnosed with cancer and schizophrenia. In one case the test had to be stopped prematurely because the subject <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> rumour that Reich was insane; there were stories, which were false, {{that he had been}} hospitalized in the Utica State Mental Hospital. In another case the father of an eight-year-old girl with cancer approached him for help, then complained to the American Medical Association that he was practising without a licence. He asked his supporters to stick with him through the criticism, believing that he had developed a grand unified theory of physical and mental health.|$|E

5|$|Beauchamp rode to Frankfort on business, {{reaching}} it on November 6. Unable to find lodging at {{the local}} inns, he rented {{a room in the}} private residence of Joel Scott, warden of the state penitentiary. Sometime after midnight, Scott <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> commotion from Beauchamp's room. When he investigated, he found the door latch open and the room unoccupied. Beauchamp, clad in a disguise, buried a set of his clothes near the Kentucky River, then proceeded to Sharp's house. Sharp was not at home, but Beauchamp soon found him at a local hotel. He returned to Sharp's house, concealed himself nearby, and waited for Sharp's return. He observed Sharp re-enter the house about midnight.|$|E
5|$|By October 1760, George II {{was blind}} in one eye, and hard of hearing. On {{the morning of}} 25 October, he rose as usual at 6:00am, drank {{a cup of hot}} chocolate, and went to his close stool, alone. After a few minutes, his valet <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> loud crash. He entered the room to find the king on the floor. The king was lifted into his bed, and Princess Amelia was sent for, but before she reached him, he was dead. At the age of nearly 77, he had lived longer than any of his English or British predecessors. A {{post-mortem}} revealed that the right ventricle of the king's heart had ruptured as the result of an incipient aortic aneurysm.|$|E
5|$|During the strike-shortened 1994 season, Hoffman {{took over}} closer duties from an injured and {{ineffective}} Gene Harris in mid-April. Hoffman recorded 20 saves and a 2.57 ERA while averaging 10.9 strikeouts per 9 innings pitched (K/9). The weekend after the strike began, Hoffman, playing Nerf football at Del Mar Beach near San Diego, dived for a pass and landed awkwardly {{on his right}} shoulder. He later played volleyball and landed on the shoulder again while going for a dig. He <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> strange sound.|$|E

One of 10 from Phillips to be accepted into the academy from his class, he entered the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, in 1943 and graduated in 1946. By {{the time he was}} commissioned, however, World War II had ended. Hudner attended the Naval Academy with a number of other notable classmates, including James B. Stockdale, Jimmy Carter, and Stansfield Turner. He played football at the academy, eventually becoming a starting running back for the junior varsity team.|$|E
5|$|If the High Court {{refuses to}} hear an appeal, the case cannot proceed further; similarly, with one exception, once the High Court has <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> case, no {{decision}} may be reviewed by the Court of Appeal. The one exception is laid out in Section 1(7), and provides that leave to appeal is only valid if either the High Court or Court of Appeal certifies it as such, and the High Court confirms that the case concerns a point of law which merits consideration. In National Westminster Bank Plc v Arthur Young McClelland Moores & Co (No.1), the Court of Appeal confirmed that, once the High Court {{has decided not to}} allow an appeal, the registrar of the Court of Appeal cannot intervene and otherwise validate such a request.|$|E

During his studies he took a study tour to Austria-Hungary and found a new method of producing yeast, which fascinated him. Later, when he <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> baker in Delft complain about the varying quality and poor availability of yeast in the Netherlands, he recalled the method which he learnt during his tour, and decided to produce industrial baker's yeast of consistently high quality.|$|E
