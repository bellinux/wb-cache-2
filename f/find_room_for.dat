25|$|Firstly, it {{appeared}} increasingly problematic to <b>find</b> <b>room</b> <b>for</b> {{a nuclear weapons}} program in the defense economy; secondly, the situation was proving that future wars would be likely waged with conventional weapons (especially, after studying the NATO's flexible response doctrine); thirdly, it was decided (yet unclear how) that Sweden was covered by the US nuclear umbrella. Just before the Government's position became known, the Defense Ministry announced that Sweden's security would be undermined if the country joined the non-proliferation agreement, because the treaty addressed small countries that hadn't acquired any nuclear weapons yet, while the US and the Soviet Union's nuclear possessions remained untouched. Thus, Sweden was under risk to yield its Freedom of action to nothing in return, while the nuclear threat against the country would remain.|$|E
25|$|Aesthetically and aerodynamically the T51 was {{a natural}} {{development}} of the T43 and T45 cars that had given Cooper their first two wins. The Coopers continued their practice of building spaceframe chassis that ignored orthodox design thinking in having several curved links and the rear-engine layout meant weight savings and aerodynamic advantages over the front-engined cars, which typically had separate gearbox and differential cases, and had to <b>find</b> <b>room</b> <b>for</b> propshafts to the rear wheels. Also {{the location of the}} fuel tanks {{on either side of the}} cockpit rather than at the rear meant the car handled more consistently with different fuel loads, a vital factor during races which lasted up to three hours. One notable throwback, however, was the car's leaf spring rear suspension, although it used a more modern coil spring and wishbone setup at the front.|$|E
500|$|This {{ground floor}} museum {{exhibits}} carriages and other conveyances {{used by the}} Grand Ducal court mainly in the late 18th and 19th century. The extent of the exhibition prompted one visitor in the 19th century to wonder, [...] "In the name {{of all that is}} extraordinary, how can they <b>find</b> <b>room</b> <b>for</b> all these carriages and horses". Some of the carriages are highly decorative, being adorned not only by gilt but by painted landscapes on their panels. [...] Those used on the grandest occasions, such as the [...] "Carrozza d'Oro" [...] (golden carriage), are surmounted by gilt crowns which would have indicated the rank and station of the carriage's occupants. [...] Other carriages on view are those used by the King of the Two Sicilies, and Archbishops and other Florentine dignitaries.|$|E

The most significant push for defeasibility has been felt in the community that has attempted to model legal reasoning with computer programs. The AI and Law community, an international group of interdisciplinarians, visited the concept of defeasibility two decades ago.

Crenshaw is also a noted guitarist who uses offbeat chord progressions (almost verging towards jazz) and concise solos. A quote from Trouser Press summed up Marshall Crenshaw’s early career: “Although he was seen as a latter-day Buddy Holly at the outset, he soon proved too talented and original to be anyone but himself.” AllMusic Guide described Crenshaw’s style: “He writes songs that are melodic, hooky and emotionally true, and he sings and plays them with an honesty and force that still <b>finds</b> <b>room</b> <b>for</b> humor without venom.” ...|$|R
