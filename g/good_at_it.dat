25|$|Hurd-Wood {{attended}} Rodborough Technology College in Milford, Surrey from 2001 to 2006 for her GCSEs with Art, English Literature, Psychology and Philosophy as subjects. She had tutored lessons {{during the}} filming of Peter Pan in Australia during 2002 to 2003 as her work lasted for a span of 8 to 9 months. She later attended sixth-form Godalming College from 2006 to 2008 to study for her GCE Advanced Levels with Art, Psychology and Philosophy as subjects. Hurd-Wood had considered becoming a marine biologist because of her love for dolphins. She gave up on the idea when she discovered that it would require studying science because {{she thought she was}} not very <b>good</b> <b>at</b> <b>it.</b> She became interested in working with children who have special needs or disabilities. Hurd-Wood studied linguistics from 2008 at University College London, having completed her first year in 2009, but left the course incomplete before travelling to Australia for the filming of Tomorrow, When the War Began, when she decided to focus entirely on her career in acting.|$|E
25|$|The second book, Under the Yoke, shows Europe under Draka rule. The Draka ruthlessly crush all {{resistance}} in Europe. European institutions are remorselessly removed, obliterated, and forbidden, although religions, albeit heavily modified by the Draka overlords, are tolerated as means of further controlling the enserfed population. Schools, universities and all seats of learning are similarly eradicated. Any serfs caught {{in possession of}} radios or literature are summarily executed. Languages are encouraged to die out, {{except for a few}} remaining mutually unintelligible local dialects, and are replaced amongst serfs by the slurred Drakan version of English. Finland is almost completely depopulated and, in 1952, when a rebellion takes over the city of Barcelona, the Draka respond with a thermonuclear bomb. Under the Yoke contains a deliberately horrific description of the impalement of several French Maquis guerrilla soldiers, disgusting even the Draka who ordered it, who nevertheless considers it a necessary means of impressing upon the slaves that resistance is futile. Thus, they will obey more willingly, making it possible for the Draka to be less harsh, giving rise to even further willingness to obey. The Draka have been slavemasters for two hundred years, and have applied modern science to the problem of breaking human wills; they are extremely <b>good</b> <b>at</b> <b>it.</b> Indeed, this feeds further into their ideology of the Draka as a master race, with individuals capable of enforcing their will over many serfs with no other tool than raw willpower.|$|E

Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine described [...] "S" [...] as an ode to sadomasochism that compares to Janet Jackson's The Velvet Rope. Conner felt that [...] "S", {{as well as}} other Loud tracks [...] "What's My Name?"

He chose the lyrics [...] "I may be bad/ but I'm perfectly <b>good</b> <b>at</b> <b>it...</b> Chains and whips excite me" [...] as an example of her vaunt. USA Todays Steve Jones opined that [...] "Louds pulsating opener, 'S,' makes it clear from the jump where [...] headed as she acknowledges that 'chains and whips excite '", while Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly called [...] "S" [...] an [...] "explicitly carnal opener" [...] with [...] "late-night-Cinemax naughtiness".|$|E

500|$|During the track, Rihanna's vocal range spans one octave, {{from the}} low note of B3 to the high note of B4. Proposing illicit acts, she uses a [...] "sexually {{aggressive}} tone" [...] in her vocal performance. The lyrics are about sex, sadomasochism, bondage and BDSM fetishes, including the sexual fantasies and turn-ons of its protagonist. The song opens with the hook, [...] "Na, na, na, c'mon". During the chorus the lyrics include, [...] "'Cause I may be bad, but I'm perfectly <b>good</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> / Sex in the air, I don't care, I love the smell of it." [...] In the song, Rihanna describes herself as [...] "bad" [...] and openly praises her own sexual prowess; lyrics include, [...] "Sticks and stones may break my bones / But chains and whips excite me." [...] Rihanna told Spin magazine that the lyrics are metaphoric. She said that she thought the song was mainly about having confidence in one's identity, and about being impervious to rumors and criticism. According to Jake Conway of Q Magazine at Yale, the lyrics are guilty of [...] "divesting sex of emotion" [...] and re-envisaging violence as fetish; {{he went on to}} say that Rihanna pays homage to the sexual acts in an empowered dance and club mood. Chris Ryan described the song as being about [...] "dirty, naughty, illicit bedroom activities".|$|E
500|$|Originally a {{construction}} worker, Welling {{was discovered in}} 1998 {{at a party in}} Nantucket by a catalog camera scout who suggested he try modeling. Welling modelled for Louisa Modeling Agency until 2000, when he relocated to Los Angeles. There he modelled for Tommy Hilfiger, Abercrombie & Fitch, and Calvin Klein while pursuing an acting career. In 2000, Welling appeared in Angela Via's music video [...] "Picture Perfect" [...] where he played Vía's love interest. Welling has stated that he did not like modelling and that he was not <b>good</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> because it was all on the outside or from an external point of view. He pursued acting because he wanted to express a range of emotions, but Welling still models occasionally and appeared in the May 2008 issue of Vogue, the so-called Superhero Issue. In his first major acting role, Welling played karate teacher Rob [...] "Karate Rob" [...] Meltzer, a younger love interest of Amy Gray (Amy Brenneman) in the second season of the CBS legal drama Judging Amy, which aired in 2001. Welling was originally signed for three episodes; after receiving enthusiastic fan reviews, the producers kept him for three more. Welling also had a small role in the UPN science fiction sitcom Special Unit 2, and he appeared in the pilot episode of the FOX sitcom Undeclared.|$|E
500|$|Erica Hahn was {{initially}} {{conceived as a}} minor character, and occasional guest-star rival of Preston Burke (Isaiah Washington). The character first appeared in three episodes of the show's second season, followed by another two episodes of the show's third season. Discussing whether she thought Hahn might become a main character after her season three appearance, Smith has stated that at the time: [...] "I didn't really {{think it was going}} to work out", joking that [...] "After every time I would hope that they would call and also hope not too– kind of like when I used to be single." [...] However, following Washington's departure from the show, Hahn was brought back as a main character in the show's fourth season, replacing Burke as Seattle Grace's Head of Cardiothoracic Surgery. Smith has said that she was not expecting her character to be introduced to the show full-time, as she [...] "didn't want to be disappointed if it didn't happen." [...] She has stated that a deciding factor in her return was the opportunity it presented to explore the character in greater depth, explaining: [...] "When I work on something that has a beginning, middle and end, I can create an arc. With Dr. Hahn, I need to figure out who she is". Researching the role, Smith watched a heart surgery performed, and liaised with the surgical nurses employed by Grey's Anatomy producers to maintain realism in the show's operating room. She dubbed this research stressful, stating that [...] "I got very neurotic about the fact that I didn’t go to medical school. I’m not actually a doctor", explaining; [...] "I {{have no idea what it}} really is to be a surgeon and yet I have to act like I am really <b>good</b> <b>at</b> <b>it.</b> I have to look like I’ve been doing it a long time".|$|E

500|$|In {{a review}} by USA Today, [...] "Hello Good Morning" [...] was picked out {{as one of}} the best three songs on the Last Train to Paris. Nick Levine of Digital Spy gave the song three out of five stars in his review for the song, stating that {{although}} Dirty Money promised a new sound the song sounded like [...] "Timba–pop, albeit one with a better-than-average hook." [...] He continued, [...] "in Diddy's final-minute rap, [...] a reminder of how he jump-started his journey towards a reported $300m fortune and a butler called Fonzworth Bentley." [...] Matt from Above said it was the Danja-produced beat and the T.I. feature that make the song good. Fraser McAlpine of BBC Music said [...] "Diddy seems to have abandoned conventional rapping in favour of some Kanye–style automooing. He's quite <b>good</b> <b>at</b> <b>it,</b> too. Adds a certain nasal edge to proceedings. There's a middle bit, and it's like nothing else in the song... It sounds more like someone doing the [...] "I've lost my keys" [...] song, just before they leave the house in the morning. The odd thing is that it was left in there. I mean if minimal is your bag, surely that'd be the first bit to cut?" [...] He awarded in four out of five stars. Becky Bain of Idolator was also positive about the song, saying, [...] "Lyrically and stylistically, it’s a pretty standard club track—over various synth beats, the song covers the usual topics: hot girls dancing, crowds waiting to have fun, and spending time in a five star suite with some five star freaks getting high all week... But honestly, we’re just overjoyed this song isn’t just a thinly-veiled four-minute commercial for any one of Diddy’s various products." ...|$|E
