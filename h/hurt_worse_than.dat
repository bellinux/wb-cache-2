6000|$|It {{was late}} in the {{afternoon}} before they reached Manchester Square, and they were both happy to find that they were not troubled by Mr. Lopez at the first moment. Everett was at home and in bed, and had not indeed as yet recovered from the effect of the man's knuckles at his windpipe; but he was well enough to assure his father and sister that they need not have disturbed themselves or hurried their return from Herefordshire on his account.

60|$|Jeff {{followed}} him dazedly into the house. The {{same sense of}} remote abstraction, of vague dreaminess, was overcoming him. He resented it, and fought against it, but in vain; he was only half conscious that his host had bathed his head and given him some slight restorative, had said something to him soothingly, and had left him. Jeff {{wondered if he had}} fainted, or was about to faint,--he had a nervous dread of that womanish weakness,--or if he were really <b>hurt</b> <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> he believed. He tried to master himself and grasp the situation by minutely examining the room. It was luxuriously furnished; Jeff had but once before sat in such an arm-chair as the one that half embraced him, and as a boy he had dim recollections of a life like this, of which his father was part. To poor Jeff, with his throbbing head, his smarting hands, and his lapsing moments of half forgetfulness, this seemed to be a return of his old premonition. There was a vague perfume in the room, like that which he remembered {{when he was in the}} woods with Miss Mayfield. He believed he was growing faint again, and was about to rise, when the door opened behind him.|$|E
