50|$|European mammal fauna {{consists}} of 270 species, 78 of them endemic to Europe (15% {{of them are}} threatened with extinction and 27% {{have been identified as}} declining). There are no endemic mammal orders in the region.There live about 25 species insectivores in Europe (European hedgehog, southern white-breasted hedgehog, common shrew, Eurasian pygmy shrew, European mole, blind mole, Eurasian water shrew). Of the 35 European bats, the most widespread are the greater horseshoe bat, lesser horseshoe bat, Mediterranean horseshoe bat, greater mouse-eared bat, lesser mouse-eared bat, Bechstein's bat, Natterer's bat, whiskered bat, Daubenton's bat, brown long-eared bat, grey long-eared bat, barbastelle, serotine bat, parti-coloured bat, common pipistrelle, Nathusius' pipistrelle, lesser noctule and common noctule.The rodents include several voles (common vole, field vole, European pine vole etc.), harvest mice, hazel dormouse, garden dormouse, edible dormouse, red squirrel, striped field mouse, wood mouse, yellow-necked mouse, black rat, brown rat, house mouse, water vole, Cricetus. The European beaver was hunted almost to extinction, but is now being re-introduced throughout Europe. The three European lagomorphs are the European rabbit, mountain hare and European hare.Widespread and locally common ungulates are boar, moose, roe deer, red deer, reindeer, wisent, chamois and argali.Today the larger carnivores (wolves and bears) are endangered. The brown bear lives primarily in the Balkan peninsula, Scandinavia and Russia; a small number also persist in other countries across Europe (Austria, Pyrenees etc.). In addition, wolverine is found in the Scandinavian Mountains and polar bears may be found on Svalbard. The Eurasian wolf, the second largest predator in Europe after the bear, can be found primarily in Eastern Europe and in the Balkans, with various packs in pockets of Western Europe (Scandinavia, Spain, etc.). The Italian wolf is a distinct sub-species of wolf found in the Italian Peninsula, especially amongst the Apennines. Other important European carnivores are Eurasian lynx, Iberian lynx (a distinct, yet critically endangered species), <b>European</b> <b>wild</b> <b>cat,</b> foxes (especially the red fox), European jackal, stoat, Eurasian otter, European mink, Eurasian badger and different species of martens. The only primate species (besides humans) is the re-introduced Barbary macaque; moreover, in prehistory this primate was more widely distributed in southern Europe.|$|E
50|$|The Turian-Chay State Reserve was {{established}} for the protection and restoration of arid-arch light forest and other natural resources; and for the localization of centers of erosion at the foothills. The reserve is situated on the spurs of the Buz-Dag Ridge, in the southern foothills of the Major Caucasus, on the right bank of the River Turian-Chay in the Agdash area of the Republic. Its territory lies at a height of 400-650 m above sea level and extends for 35 km {{from east to west}} and for 5 km from north to south. The reserve is situated in an area of semi-desert and arid light forests, which mainly consist of pistachio, juniper, oak, having an important soil protecting, water protecting and climatic significance. In the relief of the reserve lowland mountains dominate with the peaks: Pirsei-Dag (609 m), Nulbon-Dag (437 m), Archan-Dag (476 m), Olmes-Dag (544 m) and others. As a rule they have steep, in some places denudated eroded slopes, and are separated by deep narrow valleys. The northern slopes are more gentle and covered with forests; the southern slopes are steep and strongly eroded. The general process of wind erosion has developed on the territory of the reserve. On the territory of the reserve 60 species of trees and bushes grow. The main types of sparsely growing trees are: Pistacia, fudian juniper (Juniper polucarpus), prickly juniper (Juniperus oxicedrus), Quercus Iberica, ash-tree, Celtis caucasicus and pomedranate. Moreover, Quercus Iberica, Populus, willow, alder, Elaeagnus and other trees also grow in this area. Two dendraflora species of the reserve - Juniperus and pomegranate are included in the Red Book. There are 24 species of mammals and 112 species of birds, 20 species of reptiles and 3 species of amphibians in the reserve. Among the birds there are partridge (Alectoris kakelik), Columbi formes, Cercheneis tinnunculus, griffon (Gyps fulvus), black vulture (Aegypius monachus) and others. Among mammals there are wild boar, brown bear, badger, stone marten, lynx, jackal, <b>European</b> <b>wild</b> <b>cat,</b> hare and others. Among reptiles there are: Coluber jugularis and Vipera lebetina. Along the former river- beds and channels the Caspian turtle can be found, and on the slopes of the mountain the Mediterranean turtle can be observed, which, as well as the Coluber caucasicus, is included in the Red Book. The main protected objects are the model natural complexes of the Boz-Dag Ridge with the developed pistachio-arch light forests, area of semi-desert, arid and tugay vegetation. The state of arid light forest on the Boz-Dag are of great concern primary primarily because in spite of the productivity of the majority of tree species, including juniper, the regeneration of these forests in general is very slow. The establishment of the Turian-Chay reserve brought -an improvement in the situation with the regeneration of these forests. During the 40 years of the reserve’s existence the pistachio-juniper light forest has extended its area and the general quality of trees has increased. The replacement of juniper by pistachio has almost stopped. Shrubbery and herbage lave also developed well, considerably reducing the process of soil erosion.|$|E

These species forage to differing degrees in aquatic and terrestrial food webs. Fatty acid analysis revealed significant differences in polyunsaturated fatty acid composition between species.

40|$|There {{are several}} felidae amongst the {{numerous}} endangered species. Means of aiding survival are the reintroduction {{to the wild}} of animals bred {{under the auspices of}} man and their relocation from densely populated to thinly populated areas. It is unlikely that the dangers of such reintroduction or relocation projects have been examined sufficiently in respect to the risks of virus infections confronting individuals kept in zoos or similar situations. This report presents three examples to illustrate that accidental virus infections may be expected to occur when relocating and reintroducing <b>wild</b> <b>cats.</b> The first example is the reintroduction of captive snow leopards. Zoo bred snow leopards may be infected with FIV, a virus infection that is highly unlikely to occur in the original himalayan highlands of Tibet and China. A second example is of several cases of FIP that occurred in <b>European</b> <b>wild</b> <b>cats</b> bred in groups in captivity. The third example mentioned is the relocation of lions from East Africa where all the commonly known feline viruses are wide-spread to the Etosha National Park. In the latter, virus infections such as FIV, FCV and FPV do not occur. The indiscriminate relocation and reintroduction of the <b>wild</b> <b>cats</b> mentioned here harbours a potential of undesirable consequences...|$|R

40|$|Feral {{cats are}} the free-roaming {{offspring}} {{of the domestic}} cat, Felis catus. They generally fall into two categories: 1) domestic animals adapted to living on their own in rural and urban areas; or 2) homeless, lost, or abandoned pets that live on their own (Roberto 1995). The cat is a medium-sized carnivore of the family Felidae which usually weighs between 3. 3 and 4. 5 kg and measures between 73 to 79 cm in length (Nowak 1991). The ancestral <b>wild</b> species, the <b>European</b> and African <b>wild</b> <b>cat,</b> Felis silvestris, was domesticated around 7, 000 years ago, most likely around the Middle East and eastern North Africa.

40|$|Patterns of {{mitochondrial}} {{restriction fragment}} length polymorphism (RFLP) variation {{were used to}} resolve more recent relationships among the species of the Felidae ocelot lineage, domestic cat lineage, and pantherine lineage. Twenty-five of 28 restriction enzymes revealed site variation in at least 1 of 21 cat species. The ocelot lineage was resolved into three separate sistertaxa groups: Geoffroy 2 ̆ 7 s cat (Oncifelis geoffroyi) and kodkod (O. guigna), ocelot (Leopardus pardalis) and margay (L. wiedii), and pampas cat (Lynchailurus colocolo) and most of the tigrina samples (Leopardus tigrina). Within the domestic cat lineage, domestic cat (Felis catus), <b>European</b> <b>wild</b> <b>cat</b> (F. silvestris), and African wild cat (F. libyca) formed a monophyletic trichotomy, which was joined with sand cat (F. margarita) to a common ancestor. Jungle cat (F. chaus) and black-footed cat (F. nigripes) mtDNAs diverged earlier than those of the other domestic cat lineage species and are less closely related. Within the pantherine lineage, phylogenetic analysis identified two distinct groups, uniting lion (P. leo) with leopard (P. pardus) and tiger (P. tigris) with snow leopard (P. uncia) ...|$|E
40|$|Based on {{morphological}} {{and genetic}} characteristics, we describe {{a new species}} of Hepatozoon in the <b>European</b> <b>wild</b> <b>cat</b> (Felis silvestris silvestris), herein named Hepatozoon silvestris sp. nov. The study also provides the first data on the occurrence of H. felis in this wild felid. Hepatozoon meronts were observed in multiple cross-sections of different organs of four (44 %) cats. Additionally, extracellular forms, resembling mature gamonts of Hepatozoon, {{were found in the}} spleen and myocardium of two cats. Furthermore, tissues of six animals (67 %) were positive by PCR. Hepatozoon felis was identified infecting one cat (11 %), whereas the 18 S rRNA sequences of the remaining five cats (56 %) were identical, but distinct from the sequences of H. felis. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that those sequences form a highly supported clade distant from other Hepatozoon spp. Future studies should include domestic cats from the areas where the wild cats positive for H. silvestris sp. nov. were found, in order to investigate their potential role to serve as intermediate hosts of this newly described species. Identification of its definitive host(s) and experimental transmission studies are required for elucidating the full life cycle of this parasite and the possible alternative routes of its transmission...|$|E
40|$|The {{classification}} {{of the family}} Felidae (cats) is problematical due to the conservative nature of their morphology. Some workers classify the family into as many as 20 genera (Ewer, 1973) while others divide it into three genera (Walker et al., 1964). Such studies have largely been based on morphological and behavioural characters. Recently, molecular studies, namely, protein albumin immunological distances (Collier and O'Brien, 1985) and protein electrophoresis (Randi and Ragni, 1991) {{have been used to}} try and resolve the problems underlying this family. To complement the previous studies, in the present study we use mitochondrial (mt) DNA to construct a· phylogeny of eight members of the southern African Felidae namely, African wild cat, Felis lybica; domestic cat, Felis catus; caracal, Caracal caracal; <b>European</b> <b>wild</b> <b>cat,</b> Felis sylvestris; leopard, Panthera pardus; lion, Panthera leo; and cheetah, Acynonyx jubatus. Mitochondrial DNA (mt DNA) was utilized instead of nuclear DNA since it accumulates point mutations at a rate which is 5 to 10 times as fast as the nuclear DNA and is therefore particularly useful for studying more closely related organisms between sub-species, species and genera. Its apparent potential {{to be used as a}} tool for constructing genealogical trees and time scales makes it a method of choice in evolutionary studies. We used the restriction mapping approach to generate data for phylogenetic analysis. Restriction mapping was utilized since it gives good resolution at the species and genus level and evolutionary estimates derived from this method are considered more accurate than those obtained by methods such as the restriction fragment size comparison. We have also attempted to develop the methodology for sequencing part of the cytochrome b region of mt DNA following polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification. Both cladistic and distance approaches were used for phylogenetic construction. This study will be both of academic value and may have relevance to practical conservation management since these molecular approaches help to identify or confirm specific status especially with respect to the relationship between the domestic cat and the African and the European wild cats. Furthermore, such approaches can be used at the intraspecific level to address problems in biogeography and population genetics. Our results are in concordance with the previously determined morphological studies and albumin immunological distance studies. The restriction maps for the African wild cat and the domestic cat are identical, emphasizing their close relationship and the African origin of the domestic cat. The <b>European</b> <b>wild</b> <b>cat</b> showed a slight variation with the African wild cat or the domestic cat with four different restriction sites and a sequence divergence of 0. 9. This suggests that the common ancestral mt DNA of these cats existed about 450 000 years ago. The lion and the leopard are monophyletic in both cladistic and distance approaches. The precise placement of caracal has yet to be resolved but it is deeply rooted in the phylogenetic analysis which would be more consistent with a separate generic status of the latter species rather than its inclusion within either Felis or Panthera. The distance analyses are consistent with the placement of the cheetah as the most distantly related species amongst the eight Felid species examined...|$|E
