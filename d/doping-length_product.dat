30|$|The latter {{result can}} be {{explained}} as follows: The propagating Gunn domains are generated in the sample if the <b>doping-length</b> <b>product</b> n 0 L is larger than some threshold value, n 0 L > (n 0 L) 0 [1, 9]. For GaAs, the parameter (n 0 L) 0 [*]≈[*] 1012 cm− 2 [1, 9]. For GaN, this parameter is considerably larger because the NDM in GaN is about {{an order of magnitude}} smaller, as was shown earlier. For the zinc-blende GaN with the parameters considered in this paper, we obtained (n 0 L) 0 [*]≈[*] 3.7 [*]×[*] 1012 cm− 2, which is somewhat larger but close to the value of 2.5 [*]×[*] 1012 cm− 2 obtained in [15]. In our sample, the <b>doping-length</b> <b>product</b> is n 0 L[*]=[*] 2 [*]×[*] 1013 cm− 2. Therefore, the criterion for the Gunn domain instability is well satisfied. (Note that if the opposite criterion is satisfied, i.e. n 0 L < (n 0 L) 0, then the accumulation layer instability may develop [1, 9]. In this case, the layer with the excess of electrons (negative space charge) and no depletion layer (positive space charge, as is the case for Gunn domains) can be generated at the cathode and propagate to the anode.) The above criterion is, however, the necessary but not the sufficient condition for the domain instability since it was obtained on the assumption of the existence of a stable propagating domain. The domain still needs to be generated at the cathode. This in turn requires some built-in perturbation (e.g. the doping notch) in the sample or some other physical processes which can stimulate the domain nucleation. Since our sample is ideally homogeneous, the required conditions for the domain nucleation are not satisfied in the DD model. The short available time, approximately 1 ps for our bias pulse, is also the reason for preventing the instability development. However, this is not the main reason for the absence of any sign of the instability. We have analysed the spatial-temporal distributions of the carrier densities and the electric fields in the sample obtained from the DD model and found no sign of any deviation from the homogeneous state, even when the pulse duration has been considerably increased. We want to stress that the above observation is not necessarily what may take place in a real device. We merely {{want to point out that}} in the samples under consideration (about 2 - to 3 -μm-long GaN samples doped at 1017 cm− 3), the transient response in the DD model with the TE mobility does not show any sign of instability in spite of the fact that the necessary criterion for Gunn domains is satisfied. This point will be further discussed when we will analyse the DC-driven GaN devices.|$|E
