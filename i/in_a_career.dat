5|$|Chamberlain saw his {{elevation}} to the premiership as {{the final}} glory <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>career</b> as a domestic reformer, not realising {{that he would be}} remembered for foreign policy decisions. One reason he sought the settlement of European issues was the hope it would allow him to concentrate on domestic affairs.|$|E

40|$|The {{separate}} and combined effects of participation <b>in</b> <b>a</b> health <b>careers</b> program and of parental support for <b>a</b> health <b>career</b> on young people's interest <b>in</b> <b>a</b> health <b>career</b> were examined. Twenty-seven eighth graders participating <b>in</b> <b>a</b> health <b>careers</b> orientation program were matched by sex, race, and parental education with 27 eighth grade nonparticipants, and personal interviews were then conducted {{with students in}} both groups. Both program participation and parental support {{were found to be}} significantly related to two measures of the students' interest <b>in</b> <b>a</b> health <b>career.</b> One measure was of the students' interest in general health-related careers. When program participation and parental support were each studied with the other factor controlled, it was found that parental support had a greater effect when program participation was absent. An analysis of various participation-support combinations revealed that when neither participation nor parental support was present, the students' interest <b>in</b> <b>a</b> health <b>career</b> was considerably less than if one or both were present...|$|R

5|$|At {{the end of}} the play's run in Los Angeles, Woods renewed {{his offer}} to produce the play on Broadway. Although he was a renowned {{producer}} of many famous plays <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>career</b> of more than three decades, Woods had lost much of his fortune in the early 1930s and had not produced a hit in several years. Being refused by a neophyte author shocked him and increased his interest. Woods still wanted the right to make script changes, but he made adjustments to the contract to give Rand more influence. She reluctantly agreed to his terms.|$|E

5|$|For L.A. Noire, the {{development}} team recreated 1940s Los Angeles by using aerial photographs taken by daredevil Robert Spence. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>career</b> spanning over 50 years, Spence took over 110,000 aerial photographs of Los Angeles. The team used the photographs to create traffic patterns and public transport routes, {{as well as}} the location and condition of buildings. While striving to recreate an accurate model of 1947 Los Angeles, the team also took some artistic license, such as including the appearance of the film set for D. W. Griffith's Intolerance; the set had actually been dismantled in 1919.|$|E

Bure was often compared with Cam Neely, a player who also waited six years for induction; he recorded similar goals-per-game numbers <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>career</b> that was also shortened to 700-plus games. It had been often rumoured that Pat Quinn, Bure's former head coach and general manager in Vancouver, who became co-chairman of the Hockey Hall of Fame's selection committee, opposed Bure's induction. However, {{in a conference call}} following his selection, Quinn was among the most prominent figures he thanked. Quinn criticized the Canucks organization for not yet retiring Bure's jersey.|$|E
