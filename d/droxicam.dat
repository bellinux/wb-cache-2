50|$|<b>Droxicam</b> is a non-steroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drug of the oxicam class. A prodrug of piroxicam, it is {{used for}} the relief of pain and inflammation in musculoskeletal disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis.|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} {{the formation of}} severe gastric erosions produced in fasted rats by intragastric administration of <b>droxicam</b> and its active species piroxicam, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs of the oxicam group. The time course of gastric damage and the possible role of mucus secretion, changes of gastric vascular permeability, and neutrophil activation {{in the development of}} droxicam- and piroxicam-induced astric lesions, were also investigated. Both drugs dose-dependently (1 - 25 - 20 mg kg -) caused acute gastric haemorrhagic erosions in the rat. These lesions were significantly greater with piroxicam treatment 6 h after dosing. Only the lower doses of <b>droxicam</b> and piroxicam (1. 25 mg kg-') induced a significant increase of mucus gel production at different times (3 and 6 h). However, there was no increase in the concentration of its components. Oral pretreatment of the animals with either agent did not induce any changes on the values of mucosal vascular permeability. In contrast, myeloperoxidase activity as an index of neutrophil infiltration was significantly increased. A marked relationship was found between the lesion index and myeloperoxidase activity. These results suggest that neutrophil infiltration could {{play an important role in}} the pathogenesis of gastric mucosal injury induced by these oxicam agent...|$|E
40|$|The {{following}} eight oxicam {{structures were}} studied using theoretical methods, (DFT), and the Gaussian 09 {{program in the}} gaseous and aqueous phases: 4 -meloxicam, <b>droxicam,</b> isoxicam, lornoxicam, meloxicam, normeloxicam, piroxicam, and tenoxicam. More specifically, the thermodynamic parameters, polarizability, and dipole moments of each molecule were studied. Molecules with higher amounts of unsaturated bonds and phenyl groups in their structures show increased electron delocalization, thereby increasing the diffusion of the electron clouds. 4 -meloxicam, isoxicam, meloxicam, piroxicam,and normeloxicam presented Âµ values that equaled 2. 8965, 3. 2664, 2. 1138, 2. 6692, and 3. 9705 Debye, respectively, {{and all of them}} share a formation of hydrogen bridges and lower values due to the dispersion of their charges as demonstrated by an increase in polarizability values. Furthermore, we observed that with an increasing solvent dielectric constant, the dipole moment of the molecules under study, both of which do not form hydrogen bonds, also increases. These increments are mainly seen in protic solvents...|$|E
