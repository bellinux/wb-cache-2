25|$|According to McKay’s autobiographies A Long Way From Home and My Green Hills of Jamaica, {{he claimed}} the black {{intellectual}} {{was drawn to}} the Communist party because it offered independence. McKay believed that the Communists in the US <b>had</b> <b>other</b> <b>things</b> on their agenda, and the African-Americans were not part of that at all. He also thought that they were using the Negro race to fight their battles. Because of his thoughts on communism in America, he sought out help from Russia. He addressed the Communists in Russia with his speech “Report on the Negro Question” and argued that America was not fully accepting of the Negro Communists.|$|E
25|$|William VI did not {{immediately}} react to this setback; he <b>had</b> <b>other</b> <b>things</b> on his mind, being {{at war with the}} Duke of Guelders as he was, and receiving messages of the raids his Hoek enemy William, Lord of Arkel was making on his territories all the time. So in June 1411 he made a truce with the Frisians, which was renewed in the following month. When he began organising a campaign for the middle of August, the Frisians became somewhat more accommodating, and a three-year truce could be negotiated, and the campaign was called off. Under the terms of this truce Hollandic merchants got access to coastal towns and villages in Oostergo and Westergo from Dokkum in the northeast all the way around to Lemmer in the southeast; the Vetkoper refugees were allowed to return home; and William VI was awarded a large sum of money.|$|E
500|$|Cosimo III {{considered}} compelling Gian Gastone {{to become}} a cardinal. In order to rally Gian Gastone to its cause, Spain, concerned that another Medicean cardinal—Gian Gastone's uncle, Francesco Maria de' Medici, Duke of Rovere and Montefeltro, already enjoyed that dignity—would tip the scales in favour of France at a Papal conclave, offered to create him [...] "General of the Spanish Seas". Peter II of Portugal, however, <b>had</b> <b>other</b> <b>things</b> in mind for him: he wanted Gian Gastone to marry his only daughter, Isabel Luísa, Princess of Beira. To marry her, Gian Gastone would have to convince his father to allot him an allowance of [...] "adequate stature". However, the Grand Duke refused and neither the cardinalate nor the Portuguese marriage ever materialised.|$|E

2500|$|Starting in {{the summer}} of 1940 anti-Semitic laws started to come into force in both the {{occupied}} and unoccupied zones. On 3 October 1940 Vichy introduced the statut des Juifs, requiring all Jews in France to register with the authorities and banned Jews from professions such as the law, the universities, medicine and the public service. Jewish businesses were [...] "Aryanized" [...] by being placed in the hands of [...] "Aryan" [...] trustees who engaged in the most blatant corruption while Jews were banned from cinemas, music halls, fairs, museums, libraries, public parks, cafes, theatres, concerts, restaurants, swimming pools and markets. Jews could not move unless informing the police first, own radios or bicycles, were denied phone service, could only use phone booths marked Accès interdit aux Juifs and were only allowed to ride the last carriage on the Paris Metro. The French people at the time distinguished between the Israélites (a polite term in French) who were [...] "properly" [...] assimilated French Jews and the Juifs (a derogatory term in French) who were the [...] "foreign" [...] and [...] "unassimilated" [...] Jews who were widely seen as criminals from abroad living in slums in the inner cities of France. All through the 1930s, the number of illegal Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe was vastly exaggerated, and popular opinion believed that the majority of Jews living in France were illegal immigrants who were causing all sorts of social problems. In a context where the number of Jews in France, and even more so the number of illegal Jewish immigrants were much exaggerated, Ousby noted about the introduction of the first anti-Semitic laws in 1940: [...] "There was no sigh of public opposition to what was happening, or even widespread unease at the direction in which events were heading [...] [...] [...] Many people, perhaps even most people, were indifferent. In the autumn of 1940 they <b>had</b> <b>other</b> <b>things</b> to think about; later they could find little room for fellow-feeling or concern for the public good in their own struggle to survive. What happened to the Jews were a secondary matter; it was beyond their immediate affairs, it belonged to that realm of the 'political' which they could not longer control or even bring themselves to follow with much interest".|$|E

60|$|<b>Having</b> <b>other</b> <b>things</b> {{to attend}} to, or rather <b>having</b> <b>other</b> <b>things</b> to arouse his curiosity, Peter Rabbit did not visit the Old Orchard for several days.

There was an indignation meeting in progress {{in and around the}} tree in which Chebec and his modest little wife had their home. How the tongues did clatter! Peter knew that something had happened, but though he listened with all his might he couldn't make head or tail of it.|$|R
