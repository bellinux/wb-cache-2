40|$|Whether facial <b>identity</b> <b>and</b> facial {{expression}} was processed independently {{has long been}} a controversy. Studies at levels of experimental, neuropsychological, functional imaging and cell-recording all failed to consistently support either independent or interdependent processing. Present study proposed that familiarity and discriminability of facial <b>identity</b> <b>and</b> expression was important variable in mediating the relation between facial <b>identity</b> <b>and</b> {{facial expression}} recognition. Effects of familiarity on recognition of facial <b>identity</b> <b>and</b> expression had been examined (e. g. Ganel & Goshen-Gottstein, 2004) but the role of the discriminability in recognition of facial <b>identity</b> <b>and</b> expression has not yet been carefully examined. To examine the role of discriminability of facial <b>identity</b> <b>and</b> expression, 8 experiments were conducted with Garner’s speeded classification task in recognition of <b>identity</b> <b>and</b> expression of unfamiliar faces. The discriminability of facial <b>identity</b> <b>and</b> expression was manipulated, and the measurements of Garner interference and facilitation indicated that: 1. The discriminability of facial <b>identity</b> <b>and</b> expression mediate the relation between facial <b>identity</b> <b>and</b> expression recognition. Four possible discriminability combinations between <b>identity</b> <b>and</b> expression predicted 4 interference patterns between them. Low discriminability accounted for the interference either in facial identity judgment or in facial expression judgment task. 2. The measurements of eye movements indicated that either in facial identity or in facial expression recognition low discriminability led to a narrowly-distributed eye fixation pattern while high discriminability led to a widely-distributed eye fixation pattern. 3. By combining the morphing technique with the Garner paradigm, study 2 successfully demonstrated the linar relation between discriminability and Garner facilitation effects, confirmed the discriminability effects in the measurements of Garner facilitation effects [...] 4. By providing the varying information of facial expression, study 2 revealed that varying information improved the discriminability of facial expression, and then enhanced the recognition of facial expression. All the results indicated that the discriminability of facial <b>identity</b> <b>and</b> expression could mediate the independent or interdependent processing between them, and the discriminability effects on recognition of <b>identity</b> <b>and</b> expression of unfamiliar faces was identified. The results from interference effects and facilitation effects both indicated that the dimensional relation between facial <b>identity</b> <b>and</b> expression was separable but not asymmetric claimed by previous studies（Schweinberger et al, 1998, 1999 ）. Absolutedly independent or interdependent processing between facial <b>identity</b> <b>and</b> expression recognition were both impossible, discriminability of <b>identity</b> <b>and</b> expression mediated the relation between them. The discriminability effects revealed in present study could explain the conflicts between existing findings well. 面孔身份识别与面部表情识别是彼此独立的还是相互影响的？研究者各持己见，神经心理学、认知神经科学和行为学三方面的研究均未得到肯定一致的结论。已有研究表明，熟悉度对身份识别加工与表情识别加工之间的关系具有重要影响。本研究认为，区分度也是影响二者之间关系的重要因素。本研究以不熟悉面孔图片为刺激材料，操纵身份的区分度与表情的区分度，采用Garner快速分类任务，分别测查Garner效应中的干扰效应与促进效应，系统地研究了身份识别加工与表情识别加工之间的关系。主要研究发现可以概括为以下 4 个方面： 1. 在 4 种可能的身份区分度与表情区分度的组合条件下，分别测查身份与表情之间的相互干扰效应，结果表明：区分度调节身份与表情之间的干扰效应，低区分度导致身份识别或表情识别的非独立加工。 2. 测量并比较高区分度与低区分度条件下的眼动注视模式，结果表明：无论是身份识别还是表情识别，低区分度都会导致相对集中的眼动注视模式，而高区分度则导致相对分散的眼动注视模式。 3. 结合使用morphing变形技术与Garner范式，测查身份与表情之间的促进效应，结果表明，区分度调节身份与表情之间的促进效应，低区分度导致身份识别或表情识别的非独立加工。 4. 以系列变形的分类边界为指标，通过序列无间隔呈现morphing变形图片提供表情的变化性信息，结果表明，表情的变化性信息会提高表情的区分度，从而促进表情的独立识别。这克服了以往研究只采用静态表情信息的不足。 上述发现表明，不熟悉面孔的身份与表情之间是一种可分离的维度关系，而不是已有研究所认为的不对称维度关系。身份识别加工与表情识别加工之间并非绝对的独立或者绝对的非独立关系，身份和（或）表情的区分度均可以调节二者之间的关系。本研究所揭示的身份识别与表情识别中的区分度效应，可较好地解释已有相关研究结果之间的不一致...|$|R

40|$|Traditional {{models of}} face {{perception}} emphasize distinct routes for processing face <b>identity</b> <b>and</b> expression. These {{models have been}} highly influential in guiding neural and behavioural research on the mechanisms of face perception. However, it is becoming clear that specialised brain areas for coding <b>identity</b> <b>and</b> expression may respond to both attributes <b>and</b> that <b>identity</b> <b>and</b> expression perception can interact. Here we use perceptual aftereffects to demonstrate the existence of dimensions in perceptual face space that code both <b>identity</b> <b>and</b> expression, further challenging the traditional view. Specifically, we find a significant positive association between face <b>identity</b> aftereffects <b>and</b> expression aftereffects, which dissociates from other face (gaze) and non-face (tilt) aftereffects. Importantly, individual variation in the adaptive calibration of these common dimensions significantly predicts ability to recognize both <b>identity</b> <b>and</b> expression. These results highlight the role of common dimensions {{in our ability to}} recognize <b>identity</b> <b>and</b> expression, and show why the high-level visual processing of these attributes is not entirely distinct...|$|R

5|$|Michael Moorcock {{was one of}} {{the first}} scifi authors to depict {{positive}} portrayals of homosexual, lesbian and bisexual relationships and sex in his novels.

5|$|Avi Arad, the CEO of Marvel Studios, first {{announced}} plans to develop the film in April 2005, after Marvel Enterprises declared independence by allying with Merrill Lynch to produce a slate of films that would be distributed by Paramount Pictures. Marvel discussed their plans in a brief presentation to Wall Street analysts; the studio's intention was to release individual films for the main characters—to establish their <b>identities</b> <b>and</b> familiarize audiences with them—before merging the characters together in a crossover film. Screenwriter Zak Penn, who wrote The Incredible Hulk (2008), was hired by Marvel Studios to write the film in June 2007. In {{the wake of the}} 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike, Marvel negotiated with the Writers Guild of America to ensure that it could create films based on its comic book counterparts, including Captain America, Ant-Man and The Avengers. After the successful release of Iron Man (2008) in May, the company set a July 2011 release date for The Avengers. In September 2008, Marvel Studios reached an agreement with Paramount—an extension of a previous partnership—which gave the company distribution rights for five future Marvel films.|$|E
5|$|England in the Middle Ages {{concerns}} {{the history of}} England during the medieval period, {{from the end of}} the 5th century through to the start of the Early Modern period in 1485. When England emerged from the collapse of the Roman Empire, the economy was in tatters and many of the towns abandoned. After several centuries of Germanic immigration, new <b>identities</b> <b>and</b> cultures began to emerge, developing into predatory kingdoms that competed for power. A rich artistic culture flourished under the Anglo-Saxons, producing epic poems such as Beowulf and sophisticated metalwork. The Anglo-Saxons converted to Christianity in the 7th century and a network of monasteries and convents was built across England. In the 8th and 9th centuries England faced fierce Viking attacks, and the fighting lasted for many decades, eventually establishing Wessex as the most powerful kingdom and promoting the growth of an English identity. Despite repeated crises of succession and a Danish seizure of power at the start of the 11th century, by the 1060s England was a powerful, centralised state with a strong military and successful economy.|$|E
5|$|Some {{table salt}} sold for {{consumption}} contain additives which address {{a variety of}} health concerns, especially in the developing world. The <b>identities</b> <b>and</b> amounts of additives vary widely from country to country. Iodine is an important micronutrient for humans, and a deficiency of the element can cause lowered production of thyroxine (hypothyroidism) and enlargement of the thyroid gland (endemic goitre) in adults or cretinism in children. Iodized salt {{has been used to}} correct these conditions since 1924 and consists of table salt mixed with a minute amount of potassium iodide, sodium iodide or sodium iodate. A small amount of dextrose may also be added to stabilize the iodine. Iodine deficiency affects about two billion people around the world and is the leading preventable cause of mental retardation. Iodized table salt has significantly reduced disorders of iodine deficiency in countries where it is used.|$|E

5|$|The {{development}} of factitious disorders in online venues is made easier by {{the availability of}} medical literature on the Internet, the anonymous and malleable nature of online <b>identities,</b> <b>and</b> the existence of communication forums established {{for the sole purpose}} of giving support to members facing significant health or psychological problems. Several high-profile cases have demonstrated behavior patterns which are common among those who pose as gravely ill or as victims of violence, or whose deaths are announced to online forums. The virtual communities that were created to give support, as well as general non-medical communities, often express genuine sympathy and grief for the purported victims. When fabrications are suspected or confirmed, the ensuing discussion can create schisms in online communities, destroying some and altering the trusting nature of individual members in others.|$|E
5|$|The {{individual}} {{regions of}} the North have had their own <b>identities</b> <b>and</b> cultures for centuries, but with industrialisation, mass media {{and the opening of}} the North–South divide, a common Northern identity began to develop. This identity was initially a reactionary response to Southern prejudices – the North of the nineteenth century was largely depicted as a dirty, wild and uncultured place, even in sympathetic depictions such as Elizabeth Gaskell's 1855 novel North and South – but became an affirmation of what Northerners saw as their own personal strengths. Traits stereotypically associated with Northern England are straight-talking, grit and warmheartedness, as compared to the supposedly effete Southerners. Northern England – especially Lancashire, but also Yorkshire and the North East – has a tradition of matriarchal families, where the woman of the house runs the home and controls the family's finances. This too has its roots in industrialisation, when mills offered well-paid work for women: during depressions when demand for coal and steel were low, women were often the main breadwinners. Northern women are still stereotyped as strong-willed and independent, or affectionately as battle-axes.|$|E
