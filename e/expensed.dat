25|$|The rapid {{expansion}} of the strip club industry observed in the 2000s occurred primarily in the Western world. Far from its heyday in the 1980s and 1990s, Japan's sex industry {{has been in a}} protracted slump {{in the first decade of}} the 21st century, as the overall economy experienced a recession. Its hostess and strip bars (those which had not closed outright) felt the impact of dwindling corporate spending accounts, leading to increased competition (and reduced boundaries) for remaining patrons. Profitability of strip clubs, as with other service-oriented businesses, is largely driven by location and customer spending habits. Clubs closely proximate to Wall Street in New York, New York are notorious for hosting meetings with financial industry power brokers, among other business heavyweights, which are frequently <b>expensed</b> on company bankrolls. Since clubs located in urban areas or business centers have caused concerns over traffic and social issues, some club owners with common interests in close proximity have shared representation without consolidating their businesses. After numerous incidents during the 1990s with local and state government, Downtown Entertainment Inc. was formed in 2000 to represent the interests of business owners on The Block in Baltimore, Maryland.|$|E
500|$|In September 2013, it was {{reported}} that many senior members of the organizing committee, including then-CEO Ian Troop, <b>expensed</b> Ontario taxpayers for things such as a cup of tea. This led to outrage among provincial politicians including Ontario Premier Kathleen Wynne, [...] "I'm just going to say it's ridiculous. It is the kind of entitlement that is unacceptable". In response to the backlash the organization released an updated expenses and travel policy in November 2013. In December 2013, the CEO Ian Troop was ousted by the organization's board of directors, just three months after the expense scandal came into light. He was replaced by Saad Rafi. In 2014, more expenses by the organization came under scrutiny including boxes of South American wine.|$|E

50|$|An ongoing {{question}} for the accounting of any company is whether certain expenses should be capitalized or <b>expensed.</b> Costs which are <b>expensed</b> in a particular month simply appear on the financial statement as a cost incurred that month. Costs that are capitalized, however, are amortized or depreciated over multiple years. Capitalized expenditures {{show up on the}} balance sheet. Most ordinary business expenses are clearly either expensable or capitalizable, but some expenses could be treated either way, according to the preference of the company. Capitalized interest if applicable is also spread out {{over the life of the}} asset.|$|E

5000|$|To {{increase}} an <b>expense</b> account, {{it must be}} debited. To decrease an <b>expense</b> account, it must be credited. The normal <b>expense</b> {{account balance}} is a debit. In order to understand why <b>expenses</b> are debited, it is relevant to note the accounting equation, Assets = Liabilities + Equity. [...] <b>Expenses</b> show up under the equity portion of the equation because equity is common stock plus retained earnings and retained earnings are revenues minus <b>expenses</b> minus dividends. <b>Expenses</b> are considered temporary accounts in this equation, {{because at the end}} of the period, <b>expense</b> accounts are closed. Because <b>expense</b> accounts decrease the credit balance of owner’s equity, <b>expenses</b> must be debited.|$|R

Where the children have extraordinary <b>expenses,</b> the parents contribute to those <b>expenses</b> in proportion to their incomes. For example, if one parent earns $30,000 per year and the other earns $20,000, the first parent {{would have to pay}} 60% of an extraordinary <b>expense</b> and the other would have to pay 40%.|$|R

50|$|Employee {{stock options}} {{have to be}} <b>expensed</b> under US GAAP in the US. Each company must begin expensing stock options no later than the first {{reporting}} period of a fiscal year beginning after June 15, 2005. As most companies have fiscal years that are calendars, for most companies this means beginning with {{the first quarter of}} 2006. As a result, companies that have not voluntarily started expensing options will only see an income statement effect in fiscal year 2006. Companies will be allowed, but not required, to restate prior-period results after the effective date. This will be quite a change versus before, since options {{did not have to be}} <b>expensed</b> in case the exercise price was at or above the stock price (intrinsic value based method APB 25). Only a disclosure in the footnotes was required. Intentions from the international accounting body IASB indicate that similar treatment will follow internationally.|$|E
