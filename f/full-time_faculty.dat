40|$|We {{examine the}} {{variation}} in employment levels of part-time <b>faculty,</b> <b>full-time</b> teaching <b>faculty,</b> and <b>full-time</b> professorial <b>faculty</b> across 4 -year {{colleges and universities in}} the United States. Employment structures and practices in higher education institutions are determined by a variety of economic and institutional factors. For example, a 1 % increase in the average salaries paid to professorial faculty increases the employment level of part-time faculty by 0. 845 %. A 1 % increase in the average salaries paid to <b>full-time</b> teaching <b>faculty</b> reduces the employment level of <b>full-time</b> teaching <b>faculty</b> by 0. 757 %. Institutions located in large cities or suburban areas hire 31. 3 % more part-time faculty but 12. 5 % fewer <b>full-time</b> teaching <b>faculty.</b> Private institutions hire more part-time faculty than their public counterparts. A 10 % increase in FTE student enrollment is associated with a 5. 4 % {{increase in the number of}} part-time faculty, a 10. 1 % increase in the number of <b>full-time</b> teaching <b>faculty,</b> and a 9. 1 % increase in professorial faculty. In addition, we find divergent patterns of temporal variability among these three types of faculty. While employment levels of full-time instructors and professorial faculty are rather consistent over time, there is a wide range of fluctuation in the employment of part-time faculty. Finally, the employment of part-time faculty is significantly affected by that of <b>full-time</b> teaching <b>faculty.</b> There is no substitution effect on the employment of professorial faculty.

Semi-structured interviews were utilized as the primary source of data collection to capture the perceptions and experiences of <b>full-time,</b> non-tenure-track <b>faculty</b> employed at a large private doctoral university. A demographic survey, field notes, and document analysis were also used to triangulate the data.

The results of this study provide <b>full-time,</b> non-tenure-track <b>faculty</b> with navigation tools to better inform their career path and advancement options. Learning about the experiences of <b>full-time,</b> non-tenure-track <b>faculty</b> with career longevity and career advancement can be advantageous to college and university administrators to develop better policies and practices for those faculty...|$|R
