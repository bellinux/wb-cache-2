5|$|The {{legislation}} {{contained a}} ban on using <b>federal</b> <b>funds</b> <b>to</b> enforce the phase-out of incandescent light bulbs that had been mandated in the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, but requires recipients of more than $1 million in Department of Energy grants {{to comply with the}} energy efficiency standards.|$|E
5|$|This {{compliance}} requirements {{is one of}} {{the most}} important sections, because it covers cost accounting policies, expenses and expenditures, and actual use of <b>federal</b> <b>funds</b> <b>to</b> administer a federal assistance program. In other words, it provides the basis and principles recipients must adhere to when spending federal funds.|$|E
5|$|Earmarking is a {{requirement}} that specifies a limit amount or percentage of the program’s assistance that must (minimum) or may (maximum) be used for specified activities. Examples of this include limits imposed {{on the federal government}} on the amount of <b>federal</b> <b>funds</b> <b>to</b> cover administrative expenses, or a percentage requirement for total program funds provided to subrecipients. Earmarking may also be specified in relation to the types of participants covered (e.g. a limit on how many participants a recipient can provide assistance to).|$|E

She would hold that title {{for twelve years}} (1979–81, 1983–92). Clinton appointed his wife to be {{the chair of the}} Rural Health Advisory Committee the same year, where she secured <b>federal</b> <b>funds</b> <b>to</b> expand medical facilities in Arkansas's poorest areas without affecting doctors' fees.|$|E
5|$|Level {{of effort}} defines {{particular}} goals or objectives the recipient must achieve {{with the assistance}} received, and includes recipient requirements for a specified level of service, specified level of expenditures for designated activities, and <b>federal</b> <b>funds</b> <b>to</b> supplement and not supplant non-federal services. Some examples are programs that establish that a recipient must provide medical services to 1,000 patients daily and programs that require that a recipients spend over 50% of its annual budget on capital projects, among other.|$|E
5|$|Three {{days after}} Hurricane Iwa passed the state, Governor George Ariyoshi {{declared}} {{the islands of}} Kauai and Niihau as disaster areas and began filing papers for a federal disaster declaration. On November 28, {{five days after the}} hurricane struck, President Ronald Reagan declared the islands of Kauai, Niihau, and Oahu as a disaster area. The declaration allocated <b>federal</b> <b>funds</b> <b>to</b> aid the affected citizens. The state Department of Education decided to close all schools on Kauai indefinitely.|$|E

5|$|Bush {{declared}} a state of emergency in Louisiana on August 27, and in Mississippi and Alabama the following day; he authorized the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to manage the disaster, but his announcement failed to spur these agencies to action. The eye of the hurricane made landfall on August 29, and New Orleans began to flood due to levee breaches; later that day, Bush declared that a major disaster existed in Louisiana, officially authorizing FEMA to start using <b>federal</b> <b>funds</b> <b>to</b> assist in the recovery effort.|$|E
5|$|On July 10, {{just hours}} after Hurricane Dennis made {{landfall}} in the Florida Panhandle, President George W.

Also, 45counties in the state were eligible for <b>federal</b> <b>funds</b> <b>to</b> pay 75percent of the approved costs for debris removal and emergency protective services related to the hurricane, including requested emergency work undertaken by the federal government. On July 11, Escambia County joined Baldwin and Mobile counties to be eligible to receive individual assistance funds.|$|E
5|$|American Airlines {{announced}} in 1985 {{that it would}} establish a hub at Nashville, investing $115 million {{to develop a new}} 15-gate concourse and applying for $50 million in <b>federal</b> <b>funds</b> <b>to</b> build a new 10,000-foot runway. The hub was intended to compete with Delta Air Lines, Eastern Airlines and Piedmont Airlines for north-south traffic in the eastern United States. American and its regional affiliate American Eagle officially opened their hub in Nashville in April 1986. Besides providing nonstop flights to many cities in the U.S. and Canada, American also operated a transatlantic flight to from Nashville to London (flying into Gatwick Airport). The American hub was touted as a selling point in bringing companies such as Nissan and Saturn Corporation to the Nashville area.|$|E

5|$|Jennings {{continued}} to promote internal infrastructure improvements throughout his term in Congress. He introduced legislation {{to build more}} forts in the northwest, to grant federal funding for improvement projects in Indiana and Ohio, and led the debate in support of using <b>federal</b> <b>funds</b> <b>to</b> build the nations longest canal, Wabash and Erie Canal, through Indiana. He introduced a legislative amendment that made a provision to locate and survey the National Road to the west, toward the Mississippi River, so {{the people living in}} Indiana and Illinois would have some assurance that the road's large federal appropriation would benefit them directly. Jennings helped secure appropriation of funds to survey the Wabash River and make it more accessible to year-round steamboat travel.|$|E
5|$|Title to real {{property}} acquired by recipients with federal awards vests with the recipient. It {{must be used}} for the originally authorized purpose as long as needed for that purpose. Real property may be used in other federally sponsored projects or programs that have purposes similar to the one the property was bought for, as long as the federal government authorizes it. However it may not dispose of or encumber the title to {{real property}} without prior federal government consent. When it is no longer needed for the federally supported programs or projects, the recipient must request disposition instructions from the federal government. As with equipment, if the property is sold, a proportionate share is provided to the federal government, amount of the current fair market value, based on the percent of <b>federal</b> <b>funds</b> <b>to</b> own recipient's fund used to acquire the item.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{his release}} from active duty, Madgwick {{spent the rest of}} 1946 as Executive Officer for the Commonwealth Inter-Departmental Committee on Education in Canberra. In this role, he helped plan and {{establish}} the Australian National University, acting as secretary on the new university's interim council. At the same time he served as Secretary to the first Commonwealth Committee which allocated <b>federal</b> <b>funds</b> <b>to</b> universities for research. Madgwick later explained that these experiences at the federal government level influenced his belief that adult education programs should be decentralised to the state level. He added that the experience with Australian National University helped him in later establishing the University of New England as an independent school.|$|E

5|$|A {{few days}} after being sworn in, Cooper co-sponsored his first piece of legislation, a bill to provide federal aid for education. The bill passed the Senate, but not the House. Cooper was made {{chairman}} of the Senate Subcommittee on Public Roads, and helped draft a bill authorizing $900million in <b>federal</b> <b>funds</b> <b>to</b> states for highway construction. In 1948, he sponsored a bill to provide price support for burley tobacco at 90 percent of parity. He insisted on {{an amendment to the}} War Claims Act of 1948 that benefits to veterans injured as prisoners of war of the Germans and Japanese during World War II be paid immediately using enemy assets. He also co-sponsored legislation allowing {{hundreds of thousands of people}} displaced by the Nazis to enter the United States legally. He opposed bans on industrywide collective bargaining for organized labor and on the establishment of closed shops. He voted against putting union welfare funds under government control, but helped to pass an amendment forbidding compulsory union membership for workers.|$|E
5|$|When Tillman {{entered the}} Senate in 1895, he {{was opposed to}} {{expansion}} of the United States Navy, fearing the expenditure would cause the issuance of bonds by the president, which he felt would only enrich the wealthy. Tillman sat on the Senate Committee on Naval Affairs, and soon {{came to understand that}} South Carolina could benefit from naval appropriations steered towards her. A flow of <b>federal</b> <b>funds</b> <b>to</b> his home state resulted, beginning in 1900, followed by the establishment, in 1909, of the Charleston Naval Shipyard. Once Democrats took control of the Senate {{for the first time in}} Tillman's tenure, in 1913, he became chairman of the committee and allied with others from the southeast (such as Navy Secretary Josephus Daniels, a North Carolinian) to see that the bulk of naval appropriations would be spent there. He also served as chairman of the Committee on Revolutionary Claims (57th through 59th Congresses) and on the Committee on Five Civilized Tribes of Indians (61st and 62nd Congresses). Strokes in 1908 and 1910 decreased his influence and ability in the Senate; his seniority entitled him to become Senate Appropriations Committee chairman in 1913, but his health did not permit it.|$|E
5|$|Within {{months of}} {{arriving}} in Washington, D.C., Fletcher {{was selected as}} the leadership liaison for the 17-member freshman class of Republican legislators. He was appointed to the Committee on Education and Workforce, and John Boehner, chair of the committee's employer/employee relations subcommittee, chose Fletcher as his vice-chair. The committee's purpose is to oversee the rules for employer-paid health plans, among other issues, and although it is rare for a freshman legislator to attain a committee leadership post, Boehner cited Fletcher's experience in the medical field and work on reforming the Kentucky health care system as reasons for the appointment. Fletcher also served {{as a member of the}} House Committees on the Budget and Agriculture. In June 1999, he sponsored an amendment to a youth violence bill that allowed school districts to use <b>federal</b> <b>funds</b> <b>to</b> develop curricula which included elements designed to promote and enhance students' moral character; the amendment passed 422—1. Later, Fletcher was assigned to the Committee on Energy and Commerce and was selected as chairman of the Policy Subcommittee on Health.|$|E

5|$|Pierce campaigned vigorously {{throughout}} {{his home state}} for Van Buren's re-election in the 1840 presidential election. The incumbent carried New Hampshire but lost the national vote to William Henry Harrison, the military hero, whose Whigs took a majority of seats in the Twenty-seventh Congress. Harrison died after a month in office, and Vice President John Tyler succeeded him. Pierce and the Democrats were quick to challenge the new administration, questioning the removal of federal officeholders, and opposing Whig plans for a national bank. In December 1841 Pierce decided to resign from Congress, something he had been planning for some time. New Hampshire Democrats felt that no-one should hold one of the state's Senate seats for longer than one six-year term. Thus, he had little likelihood of re-election. Also, he was frustrated at {{being a member of}} the legislative minority and wished to devote his time to his family and law practice. His last acts in the Senate before resigning in February 1842 were to oppose a bill distributing <b>federal</b> <b>funds</b> <b>to</b> the states – believing that the money should go to the military instead – and to challenge the Whigs to reveal the results of their investigation of the New York Customs House, where the Whigs had probed for Democratic corruption for nearly a year but had issued no findings.|$|E
25|$|In 1995, the National Highway System Designation Act {{prohibited}} use of <b>federal</b> <b>funds</b> <b>to</b> finance new metric signage.|$|E
25|$|This act was {{the first}} that allowed for funds {{to be used for}} {{advanced}} planning of future roads. It also allowed <b>federal</b> <b>funds</b> <b>to</b> be used for roads in urban areas, instead of just rural routes, and created disincentives to prevent states from diverting highway funds to other projects. A second Hayden-Cartwright Act authorized use of <b>federal</b> <b>funds</b> <b>to</b> build roads on Indian reservations and national parks and forests. In addition to road construction, Hayden also had an interest in promoting highway safety, joining with first-term Missouri Senator Harry S. Truman in 1939 to propose legislation cutting federal funds by a third for states that failed to enact licensing requirements along with other portions of the Uniform Vehicle Code.|$|E
