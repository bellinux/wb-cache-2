We discuss the boundary conditions {{in order for the}} system to function. Emphasis is placed on the requirements of color purity, beam current, and spot size. A dedicated electron gun has been designed and tested. Results indicate that the spot-size requirements for the feasibility of the concept can be met. The depth of focus, in terms of the allowed mismatch of the dynamic <b>focusing</b> <b>voltage,</b> is small. Inter-beam space-charge repulsion turns out to be unproblematic.

40|$|An {{inertial}} confinement fusion implosion {{driven by the}} OMEGA laser takes place over a span of approximately one nanosecond. To study the physics of the implosion on OMEGA, a streak camera with subnanosecond time resolution, good spatial resolution, and high dynamic range is necessary. The Rochester Optical Streak System (ROSS) is able to make measurements with 1 % accuracy using its Optical Calibration Module (OCM). Software scripts have been written to optimize the alignment and focus of the camera using the OCM. Because the P 510 streak tube has a slot accelerator and a single electrostatic lens, it will have optimal temporal and spatial foci at different <b>focus</b> <b>voltages.</b> A common mode voltage (CMV) added to the deflection plate voltage allows the plates {{to act as an}} additional electrostatic lens, while still retaining deflection capabilities. This technique focuses a P 510 tube simultaneously in both the temporal and spatial dimensions.

40|$|Frequency {{drift of}} the order of several parts in 1013 per year is often {{observed}} in commercial cesium beam frequency standards, and on some occasions signi-ficant changes in the white noise frequency modulation level is also observed. Recently at the National Bureau of Standards some standards with these types of problems have been analyzed and their velocity distributions measured. A comparison of the changes in drift and noise performance with measurements of the velocity distribution leads to some interesting interpretations: Changes in <b>focusing</b> <b>voltage</b> at or {{in the vicinity of the}} detector may cause the finite surface area of the detector to act like a velocity selector; i. e., the detection efficiency of cesium atoms mapped across the surface of the detector changes with time as a result of changing electric fields which focus the cesium ion-beam. Changes in the microwave power cause changes in the most probable cesium atom velocity, which transduce via the Ramsey cavity phase shift into frequency changes. The magnitude of the cavity phase shifts in a cavity was inferred by reversing the current through the C-field inducing mixing of the mF states. I...|$|E
40|$|Electrically tunable {{liquid crystal}} microlenses have {{attracted}} strong research attention {{due to their}} advantages of tunable <b>focusing,</b> <b>voltage</b> actuation, low power consumption, simple fabrication, compact structure, and good stability. They {{are expected to be}} essential optical devices with widespread applications. However, the slow response time of nematic liquid crystal (LC) microlenses has been a significant technical barrier to practical applications and commercialization. LC/polymer composites, consisting of LC and monomer, are an important extension of pure LC systems, which offer more flexibility and much richer functionality than LC alone. Due to the anchoring effect of a polymer network, microlenses, based on LC/polymer composites, have relatively fast response time in comparison with pure nematic LC microlenses. In addition, polymer-stabilized blue phase liquid crystal (PS-BPLC) based on Kerr effect is emerging as a promising candidate for new photonics application. The major attractions of PS-BPLC are submillisecond response time and no need for surface alignment layer. In this paper, we review two types of fast-response microlenses based on LC/polymer composites: polymer dispersed/stabilized nematic LC and polymer-stabilized blue phase LC. Their basic operating principles are introduced and recent progress is reviewed by examples from recent literature. Finally, the major challenges and future perspectives are discussed...|$|E
40|$|We present first {{ideas of}} {{a scheme to}} develop BESSY II into a {{variable}} electron pulse length storage ring. The final goal is, to fill BESSY II with short bunches of 1. 5 ps length rms and long bunches of 15 ps length simultaneously in the presently applied user optics. All insertion devices are operated as usual, i. e. the helical undulators and 7 T field insertions. Long bunches of 1. 5 mA current per bunch, twice {{the value of the}} present user optics, are filled in each second bucket. The other buckets can be filled with short bunches of up to 0. 8 mA. The lower current value is required to avoid increase in the bunch length and bunch energy spread, predicted by scaling laws. The total current is e. g. limited by the HOM damping capabilities of the sccavities and the machine impedances. This scheme is achievable with recent developments in sc rf cavity technology driven by requirements of high current cw applications like for the energy recovering linacs ERLs. These developments seem to make it feasible to install high gradientHOMdamped multi cell cavities in electron storage rings.

The CT analysis of the beam shapes shows that the hairpin filament welder produces an elliptical beam shape in the sharp focus condition that defocuses to a diamond shape. The ribbon filament welder produced less of an elliptical beam shape in the sharp focus condition, but when defocused, acquires an elliptical shape. CT analysis of the effects of defocus on the peak power density shows that the hairpin filament drops in peak power density much more quickly than the ribbon filament for a given amount of defocus.

40|$|The {{influence}} of several operation conditions on separation of {{recombinant human erythropoietin}} glycoforms by capillary 	 isoelectric focusing (cIEF) is explored. From this study it is deduced {{that in order to}} separate several glycoforms of 	 erythropoietin, urea has to be added to sample, which should not be completely depleted of the excipients used in its 	 formulation. On-line desalting does not provide separation enhancement for samples with high content of salt. Better 	 resolution is obtained using a mixture of a broad and a narrow pH-range carrier ampholytes than with either one used 	 separately. Under the experimental conditions, <b>focusing</b> <b>voltages</b> of 25 kV improve separation compared to lower and higher 	 electric fields. Focusing times shorter than the time necessary for electric current to reach a minimum provide similar 	 separations than longer focusing times at which a minimum value of the current has already been achieved. The optimized 	 method allows the separation and quantitation in 12 min of at least seven bands containing glycoforms of recombinant 	 erythropoietin with apparent isoelectric points in the range 3. 78 – 4. 69. Compared to flat-bed isoelectric focusing, cIEF 	 provides better separation of bands of glycoforms in a shorter time, and allows quantitative determination. Capillary zone 	 electrophoresis (CZE) gives rise to resolution of erythropoietin glycoforms similar to that obtained by cIEF.
