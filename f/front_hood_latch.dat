5000|$|A {{number of}} safety {{improvements}} {{were made in}} order to comply with new American safety regulations: these included trigger-operated outside door handles, a secondary <b>front</b> <b>hood</b> <b>latch,</b> collapsing steering column, soft vent window latches, rotary glove compartment latch and instrument panel knobs labeled with pictographs. US models received a padded instrument panel that was optional in other markets. To meet North American head restraint requirements, VW developed the industry's first high-back bucket seat. The Standard model 111-112, called the 1200 [...] "A" [...] still used the 1200 engine {{but for the first}} time for Europe it came with a 12 volt system.|$|E
50|$|On {{passenger}} cars, a hood may be {{held down}} by a concealed latch. It is designed to protect a car from thefts, damage and sudden hood opening on the road. The hood release system is common on the most of vehicles and usually consists of interior <b>hood</b> <b>latch</b> handle, <b>hood</b> release cable and <b>hood</b> <b>latch</b> assembly. The <b>hood</b> <b>latch</b> handle is usually located below the steering wheel, beside the driver's seat or set into the door frame. When a driver pulls a <b>hood</b> <b>latch</b> handle the <b>hood</b> panel pops up and allows access to the engine compartment. On race cars or cars with aftermarket hoods (that do not use the factory <b>latch</b> system) the <b>hood</b> may be held down by hood pins. A hood may sometimes contain a hood ornament, hood scoop, power bulge, and/or wiper jets. Hoods are typically made out of steel, but aluminum is rapidly gaining popularity with auto companies. Aftermarket manufacturers may construct hoods out of fiberglass, carbon fiber, or dry carbon.|$|R

Up to this point, the engine {{incorporated}} a 'dogbone' upper front engine mount secured to the cowling of the vehicle's <b>hood</b> <b>latch,</b> aiding in controlling the vibration. Further improvements in later years included new pistons, rods, crankshaft, and an in-pan oiling system.

40|$|Reconfiguration of the CMR Building and TA- 55 Plutonium Facility for mission {{requirements}} {{will require}} the disposal or recycle of 200 [...] 300 gloveboxes or open <b>front</b> <b>hoods.</b> These gloveboxes and open <b>front</b> <b>hoods</b> must be decontaminated to meet discharge limits for Low Level Waste. Gloveboxes and open <b>front</b> <b>hoods</b> at CMR have been painted. One of the deliverables on this project is to identify the best method for stripping the paint from large numbers of gloveboxes. Four methods being considered are the following: conventional paint stripping, dry ice pellets, strippable coatings, and high pressure water technology. The advantages of each technology will be discussed. Last, cost comparisons between the technologies will be presented...|$|R

50|$|In 1957 the B-Series got a {{redesigned}} {{front end}} {{and a new}} dash area. The <b>front</b> <b>hood</b> was now flush with the fenders creating a more boxy look. The 1958 models saw a new grille and quad headlamps along with new circular gages.|$|R
50|$|Several {{details of}} the car bore {{similarities}} with the station wagon designs of Bertone and Pininfarina in that period. The first examples of the SV-1600 had single-colour paint, while the <b>front</b> <b>hood</b> had a spoiler, which was something new for station cars.|$|R
40|$|This {{report is}} {{an outcome of}} the work carried out in doing and {{completing}} my final year project, Design and analysis <b>front</b> <b>hood</b> fairing for cars. The paper presents {{a model of the}} <b>front</b> <b>hood</b> fairing for cars that can reduce the drag coefficient of the car, model that been used is proton Iswara. The overall duty is modeling and analyzes to get the best model that can reduce the coefficient of drag of the proton Iswara because of the high drag force at front windscreen. It happen when the airflow at the windscreen is disturbed by car wiper during high speed. It is often that the wiper system generates unwanted noise and vibration during the high speed. The report starts off with an introduction in aerodynamics vehicle and design. Then proceed to investigation about the problem at the front windscreen to get information. After gathering all the relevant information, the project undergoes design process. In this steps, from the knowledge gathered before is use to make a design refers to case data that suitable for the project. Several sketches have been made and only a few have been selected based on the suitability of the <b>front</b> <b>hood</b> and dimension of the windscreen. Based on the sketches, all the sketches will be draw into CAD software and simulate in the CFD software. At the end, the fairing that can reduce more coefficient of drag will be selected. The result shown by adding fairing at the <b>front</b> <b>hood</b> will decrease the pressure and wind noise also can be reduced. Then, the airflow will smooth and the performance of the car greater than before...|$|R

2500|$|After Wilkinson's departure, {{the designs}} of the vehicle {{dramatically}} changed {{over the next few}} years, the most visual of which was the <b>front</b> <b>hood,</b> which became more conventional in design. de Causse made many changes to the look of the car, [...] "ever increasing their appeal"; however, he died around 1928, leaving Franklin without a designer.|$|R
5000|$|In 1928 Renault {{introduced}} an upgraded specification to its [...] "Stella" [...] line. The Vivastella's and Grand Renaults had upgraded interior fittings {{and a small}} star fitted above the <b>front</b> <b>hood</b> logo.

50|$|In Herbie Rides Again, Herbie {{features}} revised racing stripes, {{with the}} original blue switched to a dark navy. In addition, the stripes were applied over the valances and louvers, and the <b>front</b> <b>hood</b> was recycled for 1982's television series Herbie the Matchmaker. Herbie also received a hood-mounted Carello fog light, and his running boards were now the more conventional black.|$|R
50|$|The {{locomotive}} was {{altered by}} 'chopping' the <b>front</b> <b>hood</b> containing the dynamic brake components and altering the cab for better forward visibility.

He noted other physical evidence that was found in the firepit on Avery’s property, and that Avery’s DNA was found on the <b>hood</b> <b>latch</b> of the victim’s car. A ballistics report indicated that the bullet found in the garage was fired by Avery’s rifle.
