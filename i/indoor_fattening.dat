This article compares {{the environmental impact of}} the main organic pig systems in Denmark. Normally, sows are kept in huts on grassland and finishing pigs are raised in stables with access to an outdoor run. One alternative practice is also rearing the fattening pigs on grassland all year round. The third method investigated was a one-unit pen system mainly consisting of a deep litter area under a climate tent and with restricted access to a grazing area. Using life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology, the emissions of greenhouse gases of the free range system were estimated to be 3. 3 kg CO 2 -equivalents kg− 1 live weight pig, which was significantly higher than the <b>indoor</b> <b>fattening</b> system and the tent system, yielding 2. 9 and 2. 8 kg CO 2 -eq. kg− 1 pig, respectively. This was 7 - 22 % higher compared with Danish conventional pig production but, due to the integration of grass-clover in the organic crop rotations these had an estimated net soil carbon sequestration. When carbon sequestration was included in the LCA then the organic systems had lower greenhouse gas emissions compared with conventional pig production. Eutrophication in nitrate equivalents per kg pig was 21 - 65 % higher in the organic pig systems and acidification was 35 - 45 % higher per kg organic pig compared with the conventional system. We conclude that, even though the free range system theoretically has agro-ecological advantages over the <b>indoor</b> <b>fattening</b> system and the tent system due to a larger grass-clover area, this potential is difficult to implement in practice due to problems with leaching on sandy soil. Only if forage can contribute to a larger proportion of the pigfeed uptake may the free range system be economically and environmentally competitive. Improvement of nitrogen cycling and efficiency is the most important factor for reducing the overall environmental load from organic pig meat. Presently, a system with pig fattening in stables and concrete-covered outdoor runs seems to be the best solution from an environmental point of view...|$|E
40|$|Background: Helminths {{are common}} in European organic pig {{production}} systems {{and the use of}} deep-litter has long been considered a serious risk factor contributing to this problem. However, until now hardly any data has existed to either support or reject this hypothesis, thus complicating formulation of farmer guidelines. Methods: On an organic Danish pig farm, 3 different areas (latrine, resting area and the area in-between) of 2 <b>indoor</b> <b>fattening</b> pens with deep-litter (min. 2 months old) were examined for Ascaris suum and Trichuris suis eggs. The deep-litter was sampled vertically 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60 cm from the surface, by pooling 4 sub-samples per level. In addition, eggs were isolated from the top, middle, and bottom of deep-litter (3 - 4 months old) of the same areas but in 3 other pens. Percentage embryonation was determined before and after incubation in H 2 SO 4 at 25 OC for 7 weeks. For comparison, control eggs isolated from fresh faeces were also incubated. Results: Though less common in the resting areas, eggs of A. suum (0 - 481 eggs/g dry litter) and T. suis (0 - 58 eggs/g dry litter) were detected in all pen areas and vertically throughout the deep-litter, but the large majority of eggs was unembryonated and some were damaged. Hardly any eggs were partially or fully embryonated. Once isolated and given optimal conditions, eggs of both species from all 3 areas were able to develop to a larvated stage, but the ability to do so declined with the depth within the deep-litter. Compared to control eggs from faeces, A. suum eggs from deep-litter were less successful in embryonation while T. suis eggs from deep-litter had the same percentage embryonation as fresh eggs. Conclusion: For the first time data has shown that deep-litter may not be a risk factor for A. suum and T. suis transmission within the pens as previously suspected. However, it does appear that a high number of eggs may survive and potentially embryonate if they are transferred to a more beneficial environment. The consequence being that manure should not be spread indiscriminately onto pastures, which may later be used for pigs. A solution may be to inactivate the eggs first. ...|$|E
40|$|Aim of {{the study}} was to evaluate, if the mixed breed German Landrace x Turopolje (L x T) was {{suitable}} for conventional fattening and the production of high quality palatable meat. Hence, we chose to study the carcass characteristics of three different breeds: true bred Turopolje (T x T) (n= 15), an autochthonous Croatian breed, German Landrace x Pietrain (L x P) (n= 19), a typical German pig hybrid and German Landrace x Turopolje (L x T) (n= 23) as mixed breed. All three breeds were kept in a conventional fattening indoor system. The data consisted of the chemical and physical values of the carcass and the difference between breeds during breeding and fattening. All pigs were fattened with a conventional ad libidum feeding system. The feed consisted of an optimal mixture for the fattening of L x P. The daily feed intake and the weight from birth until the end of the fattening was recorded every 14 days. The quality of the carcass was evaluated at the age of 20 and 25 weeks. The measurement of the carcass was based on the “Richtlinie für die Stationsprüfung auf Mastleistung, Schlachtkörperwert und Fleischbeschaffenheit beim Schwein” published by the national German control office. L x T showed the lowest feed intake per kg carcass compared to the other breeds. The quality of meat was characterized by pH, conductance, intramuscular fat and water holding capacity. L x T showed a trend for a lower conductance in week 25. The value of pH and water holding capacity was not significant between the breeds. Surprisingly, the intramuscular fat of L x T was by trend higher compared to L x P and significantly lower than T x T (p < 0. 05). L x T had by trend a higher carcass weight and a larger carcass length compared to L x P, which was significantly higher than T x T (p < 0. 05). In conclusion, the new breed L x T seems to be suitable for an <b>indoor</b> <b>fattening</b> system and produces a high quality palatable meat. The energy and protein intake should be slightly reduced, which would reduce the cost of meat production...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{evaluate}} serology {{as a tool}} to monitor Trichinella-free pig herds. <b>Indoor,</b> industrial-raised <b>fattening</b> pigs in the Netherlands are practically Trichinella-free, and were used as a negative reference cohort. A positive cohort was not available but we used sera from an endemic region in Argentina to model a plausible distribution of serological responses (as OD levels) in positive sera, employing the difference between the endemic sera and the negative Dutch sera. We describe a method for correcting for variation among ELISA plates using on-plate reference sera, and demonstrate how to apply these corrections to a collection of test sera from pig farms. The positive and negative reference distributions can be used to estimate fractions true and false positives, necessary for defining appropriate cutoffs to be used for classifying positive and negative animals. Based on this analysis, the serological test was shown to lack the predictive power required for its large scale deployment. The properties of the serological test were also compared to the conventional digestion assay, which is highly specific but considerably less sensitive...|$|R

The aim of the present paper is to evaluate the impact of snail meat by a cradle-to-farm gate life cycle assessment centred on the carbon footprint (CF).
