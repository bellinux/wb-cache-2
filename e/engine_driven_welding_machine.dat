40|$|This report {{describes}} the {{improvements in the}} joint properties of friction welded joint of 780 MPa class high tensile steel. Welded joint made by a continuous <b>drive</b> friction <b>welding</b> <b>machine,</b> the conventional method, had not obtained 100 % joint efficiency despite applying forge pressure. This {{was due to the}} softening of the welded interface zone for heat input during braking times. Therefore, we developed a continuous <b>drive</b> friction <b>welding</b> <b>machine</b> with an electromagnetic clutch to prevent heat input during braking time. We proposed the process as “The Low Heat Input Friction Welding Method (the LHI method). ” In this case, the joint had the same tensile strength as the base metal at friction time when the friction torque reached the initial peak torque. That is, the welded joint obtained 100 % joint efficiency by using only the friction stage up to the initial peak torque without the forge (upsetting) stage, despite the existence of a slightly softened region adjacent to the welded interface. Furthermore, the softened region was hardly generated when this joint was made by applying forge pressure at the initial peak torque. In conclusion, a welded joint of high tensile steel made by only the friction stage of the LHI method had excellent joint properties. The LHI method has a lot of advantages for joining such materials as super fine grain steel with which conventional fusion welding processes have difficulty...|$|R

Specimens of pure copper to carbon steel and aluminum to pure copper were welded at constant friction pressure; the friction time and the total upset were measured. All the specimens were subjected to tensile tests. The study revealed that, the optimum friction pressure for steel specimens was 25 bar. It also revealed that an excellent joint efficiency was obtained by welding of similar specimens of carbon steels, a satisfactory joint efficiency was obtained by welding of high speed steel to carbon steel, a poor joint efficiency was obtained by welding of similar specimens of high speed steels, a good joint efficiency was obtained by welding of copper to carbon steel, a very weak joint was obtained by welding of copper to aluminu...|$|R
40|$|This article {{describes}} the effect of friction welding conditions and aging treatment on the mechanical properties of type 7075 -T 6 aluminium alloy (A 7075) friction welded joints. A 7075 was joined by using a continuous <b>drive</b> friction <b>welding</b> <b>machine</b> with an electromagnetic clutch {{in order to prevent}} braking deformation during as rotation speed decreases. That is, it was welded by using the 'Low Heat Input Friction Welding Method' (LHI method) developed by the authors, in which heat input is lower than in the conventional method. The maximum joint efficiency at a friction pressure of 30 MPa was approximately 25 %, and that at 90 MPa was approximately 64 %. These joints were made without forge pressure. The low joint efficiency was due to the existence of non-joined regions at the welded interfaces. However, the welded joint had approximately 82 % joint efficiency when the friction time was 0 · 5 s at a friction pressure of 90 MPa with a forge pressure of 180 MPa. The welded joint softened at the welded interface and its adjacent region. It had approximately 90 % joint efficiency after aging for 730 days at room temperature (natural aging). It also had approximately 95 % joint efficiency after aging for 48 h at 393 K (120 °C), and had no softened region at the welded interface. The heat input of the welded joint with the LHI method could be decreased to approximately 50 % of that with the conventional method. The LHI method has several advantages for A 7075 friction welding; less heat input than with the conventional method, and light post-weld processing (machining, etc.) because the flash can be minimised...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Many {{researches}} for {{friction welding}} of aluminum with either carbon steel or stainless steel {{have been carried}} out. From those results, it is concluded that the greatest problem is the formation of brittle intermetallic compounds at weld interface. However, it is not clearly demonstrated the effect of friction welding parameters on the formation of intermetallic compounds. This research purposes are to evaluate the formation of intermetallic compounds and to investigate the effect of friction welding parameters {{on the strength of}} welded joint. For these purposes, A 6061 aluminum alloy and S 45 C carbon steel were used with a continuous <b>drive</b> vertical friction <b>welding</b> <b>machine.</b> Tensile test results revealed that the maximum tensile strength was achieved at extremely short friction time and high upset. The joint strength reached 92 % of the tensile strength of A 6061 base metal. Tensile strength of friction welding was increasing with increasing upset pressure when friction time 1 sec. However, tensile properties were deteriorated with increasing friction time. It was observed that the amount of formed intermetallic compound was increasing with increasing friction time at weld interface. Partly formed intermetallic compound on weld interface were identified when friction time 1 sec. However, intermetallic compound layer were severely developed with longer friction time at weld interface. It was concluded that intermetallic compound layer deteriorated the tensile properties of weld joints...|$|R

The experiments produced the following summarized results. (1) Medium carbon steel joint did not obtain the same tensile strength as that of the base metal, and the fracture occurred at the welded interface when it was made at friction time up to the initial torque by friction pressure of 30 MPa. However, the joint obtained the same tensile strength as that of the base metal，and the fracture occurred at the base metal when it was made at friction time up to the initial torque by 90 MPa. (2) Medium carbon steel joint by 30 MPa fractured at the welded interface due to the unjoined region, which was produced at the peripheral region of the welded interface during friction process. The unjoined region had not produced with increasing friction pressure. (3) High carbon steel joint did not obtain the same tensile strength as that of the base metal, and the fracture occurred at the welded interface when it was made at friction time up to the initial torque by 30 and 90 MPa. (4) High carbon steel joint fractured at the welded interface due to the quench crack, which was produced during cooling stage after welding. The quench crack reduced with increasing friction pressure. However, the joint by high friction pressure (300 MPa) did not obtain the same tensile strength as that of the base metal, and it fractured at the base metal, because the center portion at the welded interface hardly joined after the initial torque...|$|R
