40|$|Homeless {{people and}} protesters in Montreal {{have at least}} one thing in common: both groups (and they are by no means {{mutually}} exclusive) are routinely controlled for their occupation of public spaces through tickets issued by the municipal police for alleged violations of municipal by-laws (such as loitering, drinking alcohol in public, or unlawful assembly). My doctoral research project brings a municipal and ethnographic dimension to the analysis of local governance of public spaces in Montreal. I argue that two specific groups of marginalized people –namely homeless people and protesters– are disproportionately ticketed by the municipal police because they are seen as disorderly people making atypical uses of public spaces. The ticketing practices, anchored in broken windows theory and order maintenance policing, serve to remove homeless people and protesters from public spaces. Under the appearance of inoffensive space management, serious exclusion occurs and multiple rights are violated. In the end, I show that banal and seemingly unthreatening legal processes, such as those involved in the <b>issuing</b> <b>of</b> <b>tickets</b> in Montreal, can have a profound impact on people’s lives but also on the way we construct public space and experience life in the city...|$|R

It is possible that the depression of the times may render a performance in Manchester unwise. In that case I would immediately abandon the idea. But what I want to know, by return of post is, is it safe or unsafe? If the former, here is the bill as it stood in London, with the addition, on the back, of a paragraph I would insert in Manchester, of which immediate use can be made.

Any type of user or flow can be given priority, depending the user needs and the context. User agents contact ticket servers using an agent communication language, then a ticket server intelligent agent determines how valuable <b>of</b> a <b>ticket</b> to <b>issue.</b> Use <b>of</b> <b>ticket</b> servers and agent communication enables quick adaptation to dynamic context changes and provides user feedback so that high priority communication activities can be conducted effectively.

40|$|Although {{there are}} several studies {{on the effects of}} {{personality}} and attitudes on risky driving among young drivers, related research in older drivers is scarce. The present study assessed a model of personality-attitudes-risky driving in a large sample of active older drivers. A cross-sectional design was used, and structured and anonymous questionnaires were completed by 485 older Italian drivers (Mean age= 68. 1, SD= 6. 2, 61. 2 % males). The measures included personality traits, attitudes toward traffic safety, risky driving (errors, lapses, and traffic violations), and self-reported crash involvement and number <b>of</b> <b>issued</b> traffic <b>tickets</b> in the last 12 months. Structural equation modeling showed that personality traits predicted both directly and indirectly traffic violations, errors, and lapses. More positive attitudes toward traffic safety negatively predicted risky driving. In turn, risky driving was positively related to self-reported crash involvement and higher number <b>of</b> <b>issued</b> traffic <b>tickets.</b> Our findings suggest that theoretical models developed to account for risky driving of younger drivers may also apply in the older drivers, and accordingly be used to inform safe driving interventions for this age group.

Previously, railway companies had used handwritten tickets, as was the practice for stagecoaches, but it was laborious for a ticket clerk to write out a ticket for each passenger and long queues were common at busy stations. A faster means <b>of</b> <b>issuing</b> pre-printed <b>tickets</b> was needed.
