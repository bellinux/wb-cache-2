40|$|Seven {{electric}} utilities in the United States offer a <b>green</b> <b>pricing</b> program, an optional {{product or service}} that customers choose {{if they wish to}} increase their use of renewable energy resources. Some two dozen additional utilities are considering or are planning to offer this option. The multiple approaches used and being considered recognize that <b>green</b> <b>pricing</b> is still in an experimental stage of development. The seven operating programs offer a green tariff for extra renewables, fixed monthly fees, and the opportunity to contribute to a tax-deductible fund. The results, in terms of participation levels, are mixed. This experience suggests some guidelines for successful programs. When it was first described in the electric utility literature, <b>green</b> <b>pricing</b> was intended to help commercialize renewable technologies and improve environmental quality by gradually displacing older and dirtier power plants (Moskovitz 1992, 1993). Market research into customer willingness to pay extra for cleaner renewable energy also supported a customer satisfaction rationale. Since then there has been a sea change in the electric utility industry. Competition is now integral to strategic planning. The ability of <b>green</b> <b>pricing</b> to maintain or attrac...|$|E

40|$|In practice, it is {{difficult}} to determine the optimal amount to spend on marketing and administering a <b>green</b> <b>pricing</b> program. Budgets for marketing and administration of <b>green</b> <b>pricing</b> programs are a function of several factors: the region of the country; the size of the utility service area; the customer base and media markets encompassed within that service area; the point or stage in the lifespan of the program; and certainly, not least, the utility's commitment to and goals for the program. All of these factors vary significantly among programs. This report presents data on programs that have funded both marketing and program administration. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) gathers the data annually from utility <b>green</b> <b>pricing</b> program managers. Programs reporting data to NREL spent a median of 18. 8 % of program revenues on marketing their programs in 2008 and 16. 6 % in 2007.

40|$|Human {{misuse of}} {{environmental}} assets especially energy is causing environmental degradation, which hampers {{social and economic}} welfare for present {{as well as for}} future generations. A worldwide shift to sustainable energy sources is one of the required actions to solve the problem. Electricity from sustainable energy sources is called green electricity and has arose {{as one of the most}} motivating tools for developing the sustainable energy market. This has resulted in the restructuring of Germany's energy industry with a dramatic change in energy use in electricity. The change has been aided by the German renewable energies act (EEG), which is been criticized for its resulting high <b>green</b> electricity <b>prices</b> which consumers have to pay. <b>Green</b> electricity <b>prices</b> seem to call for more consumers' attention than threats posed by conventional energy because only a small fraction of energy is sold as green electricity neccesitating the rethinking of the energy market. Due to the need for future research on more factors influencing consumers buying behavior in the green electricity market, this thesis seeks to investigate the following research questions: Is <b>green</b> electricity <b>price</b> the major influencing factor for its market unattractivess? Does the concern about price really calls for more attention than environmental concerns? It specifically aims to describe German consumers' perceptions of factors influencing their green electricity buying behavior. The research methodology involves the use of secondary and primary data. The secondary data gives a background knowledge of Germany and its energy historical development, Germany's sustainable energy strategies and strategies for market development (electricity feed-in-tariffs, the renewable energy act and problems), green electricity marketing, consumers' purchasing behavior and factors influencing this behavior. The primary data is gotten through a questionnare survey and analysed using both excel and the statistical package for social sciences. Evidence is taken from Germany because of its ambitious goals of 20 - 30 % green electricity by 2020 and 80 - 100 % by 2050. The result of the study shows that, although price is the most influencing factor in choosing an electricity supplier and also calls for more attention than environmental concerns, it's not the major hindering factor for the green electricity market unattractivess. Most German electricity consumers (42 %) have no idea about <b>green</b> electricity <b>prices.</b> In comparison to competitors, 27 % of them assume the prices are higher while 31 % say the prices are thesame and even lower. All green electricity consumers confirm the prices are moderate and even cheaper. Even when prices are the same, most respondents gave other reasons like conviniences before environmental friendliness as the first motive for their electricity choice. Despite Germany's ambitous goals, consumers selfinterest and ignorance about <b>green</b> electricity <b>prices</b> remain a problem for the market...|$|R

40|$|This report {{documents}} green power marketing {{activities and}} {{trends in the}} United States. Aggregate green power sales data for all voluntary purchase markets across the United States are presented for 2009. The data presented in this report are based primarily on figures provided to NREL by utilities and independent renewable energy marketers. Because data cannot be obtained from all market participants, the estimates presented here likely represent an underestimate of the market size. Key trends identified in this year’s report include:• In 2009, total retail sales of renewable energy in voluntary markets exceeded 30 million MWh, an increase of 17 % from 2008. The increase was dominated by renewable energy certificate (REC) sales, primarily to nonresidential consumers, which increased by about 20 % from 2008 (see Figure ES- 1). REC markets now represent 62 % of total voluntary green power market sales. • Utility <b>green</b> <b>pricing</b> programs in regulated electricity markets continued to grow on a sales basis but at a slower rate than in previous years, with sales volume increasing by about 7 % in 2009. A {{relatively small number of}} utility programs continued to dominate sales and customer numbers. Utility premiums for <b>green</b> <b>pricing</b> continued to fall {{due in part to the}} increased cost competitiveness of renewable with conventional generation. • Wind energy provided 73. 7 % of total green power sales volume, followed by biomass energy sources including landfill gas (10. 0 %), hydropower (9. 9 %), geothermal (0. 2 %), and solar (0. 1 %), with the remainder unknown (5. 9 %). • Overall, the total number of customers purchasing green power increased by 44 % in 2009, which is a higher rate than in previous years and with gains coming primarily from a competitive offering in Texas introduced in 2009. Utility <b>green</b> <b>pricing</b> program participants remained essentially flat in aggregate from 2007 to 2009, with some programs continuing to report customer losses in 2009. • In 2009, nearly 340, 000 metric tons of avoided CO 2 e from renewable energy facilities were marketed as offsets, an increase of approximately 39 % from 2008. This is the equivalent of about 485, 000 MWh of renewable energy generation...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to examine the <b>green</b> electricity <b>pricing</b> behavior in the Finnish retail electricity market. The first part of the study gives an overview of the current state of the Finnish electricity market with an introduction to renewable electricity trade. Then, the motivational factors behind consumers’ environmental behavior and willingness-to-pay for green electricity are discussed, after which the study continues to present the main determinants of the electricity price in the Finnish market. Finally, the underlying pricing strategies are discussed from the viewpoint of potential price discrimination in the green market. The {{objective of}} the second part is to examine empirically the actual <b>green</b> <b>price</b> development in the Finnish retail market and compare the results to the theoretical discussions presented. By combining the anti-competitive characteristics of the Finnish retail electricity market to the theory of consumer willingness-to-pay (WTP) for eco-products and electricity pricing, the theoretical discussion shows how green retailers might have incentives to use perceived value pricing strategy and thereby pursue to use a higher premium on their green contracts. The higher WTP of eco-consumers might be a tempting niche-segment for a retailer; despite the fact that the higher price might prevent other customers from buying the product. Research data consists of the Finnish retail price data for household customers from the period 2006 - 2010. The findings were conducted by studying two electricity contract types: open-ended offer prices and one year fixed term contracts. Data was obtained from the Energy Market Authority. The main findings of the quantitative research demonstrate there have been clear similarities in the <b>pricing</b> patterns between <b>green</b> and brown electricity contracts, but the difference between them has varied. In average, green electricity has still been slightly more expensive than conventional electricity. Although green premiums have been relatively low, which suggests retailers have not been able to exploit their pricing power significantly. However, there were substantial price dispersion between retailers, which might be a sign of either opportunistic pricing, or alternatively, a sign of exploitation of inactive customers and higher WTP. Nevertheless, the low market share of green electricity contracts suggests there are still factors in the Finnish market that hinder environmental buying behaviour – other than price...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} green exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and propose a market-wide proxy for green returns and a green volatility factor. Design/methodology/approach – Identifying a unique sample of green funds, this paper investigates the time-series behavior of returns for these investment vehicles and their associated conditional volatility dynamics via GARCH methodology. In this study, green ETFs are defined as index funds replicating market indices that invest in stocks exhibiting positive environmental, social, and governance characteristics. Findings – Cumulative market-wide green returns are found to be positive from inception year 2005 through 2008. Estimating a t-GARCH (1, 1) specification, the author finds strong evidence in favor of volatility persistence for the 15 green ETFs identified in this study. Additionally, the results suggest that a 1 percent volatility-based value-at-risk forecast ranges from $ 24, 150 through $ 26, 000 on a daily basis. Finally, the empirical evidence provides support for weak-form market efficiency when examining the green universe of stocks. Research limitations/implications – Green ETFs are relatively recent financial instruments and exhibit important implications for volatility timing strategies and the cross-section of green stock returns. Practical implications – Knowledge of <b>green</b> <b>price</b> behavior is important in constructing optimal hedging and risk management strategies. Social implications – Green ETFs provide a natural channel for sustainable investing. Originality/value – Green ETFs exhibit the advantage of including many companies that have undertaken positive measures towards the global environment in their respective business models.
