5|$|Few {{months after}} his birth, al-Jamri family {{traveled}} to Najaf, Iraq where his father continued his religious studies. At the time, al-Jamri's family was composed of his parents and his 2-year-old brother Mohammed Jameel. He studied for <b>five</b> <b>years</b> <b>at</b> the Talibiya primary school which was also attended by some Bahrainis such as Sami, the elder son of Isa Qassim. Having no TV at home, al-Jamri and his siblings {{spent most of their}} time listening to stories told by their mother or playing with kites outside. At the age of 9, he began practicing Islamic prayers and fasting in Ramadan.|$|E

5|$|In November 1815, Louis XVIII's {{government}} had to sign another Treaty of Paris that formally ended Napoleon's Hundred Days. The previous treaty had been quite favourable to France, but this one took a hard line. France's borders were retracted to their extent at 1790. France {{had to pay for}} an army to occupy her, for at least <b>five</b> <b>years,</b> <b>at</b> a cost of 150million francs per year. France also had to pay a war indemnity of 700million francs to the allies.|$|E
5|$|On {{the eve of}} the 1946 {{championship}} game, Bell {{was notified}} that Merle Hapes and Frank Filchock of the New York Giants had been implicated in a bribing scandal. Filchock was sanctioned by Bell to play in the game but Hapes was suspended. At the next NFL owners' meeting, Bell was worried the repercussions from this event would lead to his firing. However, he was pleasantly surprised to learn that his contract would be elevated to <b>five</b> <b>years</b> <b>at</b> $30,000 per year. Reinvigorated with renewed support, he persuaded the owners to allow him to put sudden-death overtime into the playoffs.|$|E

5|$|To {{serve as}} governor, a person {{must be at}} least 30 years old, and must have been a citizen of West Virginia for at least <b>five</b> <b>years</b> <b>at</b> the time of inauguration. The Constitution of West Virginia, {{ratified}} in 1872, calls for a four-year term for the governor, commencing on the Monday after the second Wednesday in the January following an election. The original constitution of 1863 had only a two-year term for governor.|$|E
5|$|After <b>five</b> <b>years</b> <b>at</b> West Point, Devers was {{selected}} to attend the Command and General Staff School at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. He began his studies there on 3 September 1924, and finished as a Distinguished Graduate on 28 June 1925. He was ranked 42nd {{in the class of}} 258, which was topped by Dwight Eisenhower. He was then posted once again to Fort Sill, this time as the director the Field Artillery School's Gunnery Department until 31 August 1929. Among the officers he worked with was Captain Edward H. Brooks. During his tour, Devers was credited with making a number of innovative artillery tactical and technical improvements, including advanced fire-support techniques that would later be successfully used during World War II. He remained a staunch advocate of mechanization throughout the inter-war period. The idea of phasing out horses met strong resistance from conservative gunners.|$|E
5|$|After {{more than}} <b>five</b> <b>years</b> <b>at</b> Wells, Wheelwright {{received}} {{an invitation from}} the church and town of Hampton, then {{under the jurisdiction of}} Massachusetts, to join the Reverend Timothy Dalton as a pastor of the church there. Without apparent hesitation he went there in the spring of 1647 and entered into a written agreement with a committee of the church and town. He was installed as the minister on 12 April 1647 by some accounts, or 24 June 1647 by another. The job afforded the 55-year-old Wheelwright with a larger salary than the parish at Wells did, an important consideration given the large size of his family. No longer in a frontier setting, he was now within reach of professional brethren and laymen of culture and social refinement, more aligned with his educational background.|$|E

5|$|During Jerry Claiborne's tenure, from 1972 to 1981, {{the team}} {{captured}} three consecutive ACC championships and made seven bowl game appearances, {{the most of}} any Maryland coach to date. In Bobby Ross's <b>five</b> <b>years</b> <b>at</b> Maryland, from 1982 to 1986, he led the team to three consecutive ACC championships and four bowl appearances. In 1984, quarterback Frank Reich led the team to victory from a 31–0 halftime deficit against Miami in what was then the greatest comeback in NCAA football history. This period was marked by bitter competition for ACC primacy with 1981 national champions Clemson, and between 1974 and 1988, each team won six conference championships.|$|E
5|$|Edwards {{started his}} {{football}} career at Wigan Athletic, progressing through the club's youth system before signing a professional contract {{at the age}} of 18. In September 2004, Edwards joined Morecambe on a month's loan, playing one game before returning to his parent club. He was loaned out again during the 2005–06 season, this time to Accrington Stanley in October 2005. He subsequently signed for the club permanently in January 2006, helping the club win the Conference National. He spent <b>five</b> <b>years</b> <b>at</b> Accrington, playing over 250 games for the club in all competitions. In June 2011, Edwards signed for Stevenage on a free transfer. In March 2012, Edwards joined Rochdale on loan {{until the end of the}} 2011–12 season. Edwards was released by Stevenage in May 2012, and subsequently signed for Rochdale on a permanent basis in August 2012. After a season of regular first-team football at Rochdale, Edwards signed for Burton Albion in June 2013.|$|E
5|$|Harry Bradshaw, {{appointed}} {{in the summer}} of 1899, was faced with several difficulties, not least falling attendances and limited funds to attract the best players. In his <b>five</b> <b>years</b> <b>at</b> Arsenal, he managed to steer the club away from bankruptcy by signing local talent such as Jimmy Ashcroft and Jimmy Jackson, and directed his team's promotion to the First Division in 1903–04. Phil Kelso replaced Bradshaw in the close season and succeeded in keeping the club afloat in the top division. He also steered Arsenal to the semi-final stage of the FA Cup in the 1905–06 and 1906–07 seasons. Kelso departed in February 1908, amid uncertainty over the club's finances, and was replaced by George Morrell, a fellow Scotsman. Morrell's time as manager coincided with Sir Henry Norris' takeover of Arsenal and the club's subsequent relocation to Highbury. Arsenal were relegated to the Second Division in 1913, though the move to North London brought about much larger attendances.|$|E

5|$|In May 1719, Balchen {{was given}} {{command of the}} 70-gun HMS Monmouth under Sir John Norris, and served in the Baltic and North Seas until 1722. In 1722, Balchen took over the {{guardship}} HMS Ipswich at Spithead and, in 1726, returned to the Monmouth for further service in the Baltic under Norris and Sir Charles Wager. In 1727 Balchen {{was part of a}} mission to resupply besieged Gibraltar, although, by the time the fleet arrived, the siege had been broken. In 1728, Balchen received promotion to Rear-Admiral. In 1731, after a period in command of the 60-gun HMS Dreadnought, Balchen took over the 80-gun HMS Princess Amelia and commanded her in support of a Spanish landing at Livorno. Balchen returned in December and, in 1734, was promoted to Vice-Admiral, spending the next <b>five</b> <b>years</b> <b>at</b> his estates in England.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} shot in the rocky terrain of Ramanagara, in the {{southern}} state of Karnataka, over a span of two and a half years. After the Central Board of Film Certification mandated the removal of several violent scenes, Sholay was released with a length of 198minutes. In 1990, the original director's cut of 204minutes became available on home media. When first released, Sholay received negative critical reviews and a tepid commercial response, but favourable word-of-mouth publicity helped it to become a box office success. It broke records for continuous showings in many theatres across India, and ran for more than <b>five</b> <b>years</b> <b>at</b> Mumbai's Minerva theatre. By some accounts, Sholay was the highest-grossing Indian film of all time, adjusted for inflation.|$|E
5|$|The gradual {{switch from}} amateur to {{professional}} continued in 1968, when {{for the first}} time the chorus was supplemented by a smaller, professional group of singers; the mix of amateur and professional choristers continued over the next <b>five</b> <b>years.</b> <b>At</b> the end of the 1960s the main WNO company, now a year-round operation, consisted of 8 salaried principal singers, 57 guest soloists and a chorus of 90 amateurs and 32 professionals. As well as the Bournemouth players, the company engaged the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic, City of Birmingham Symphony and Ulster orchestras for different venues. In the last season of the decade 32 performances were given in Cardiff and 61 elsewhere in the UK. In addition to the main company, WNO maintained two smaller groups: one, with orchestra, toured Welsh towns, the other, consisting of 12 singers with piano, toured 79, mostly small, towns in Wales and England. WNO instituted its own training scheme for young singers during the decade.|$|E

5|$|This {{came to a}} head at {{a meeting}} {{sponsored}} by the International Astronomical Union (IAU) in Oxford in 1981. The methodologies and research questions of the participants were considered so different that the conference proceedings were published as two volumes. Nevertheless, the conference was considered a success in bringing researchers together and Oxford conferences have continued every four or <b>five</b> <b>years</b> <b>at</b> locations around the world. The subsequent conferences have resulted in a move to more interdisciplinary approaches with researchers aiming to combine the contextuality of archaeological research, which broadly describes the state of archaeoastronomy today, rather than merely establishing the existence of ancient astronomies, archaeoastronomers seek to explain why people would have an interest in the night sky.|$|E
5|$|Hasluck {{had been}} Governor-General since 1969, and his term was shortly due to expire. Whitlam {{wanted him to}} remain a further two years, but Hasluck declined, citing his wife's refusal to remain at Yarralumla longer than the {{originally}} agreed five years. Whitlam offered the post to businessman Ken Myer, who turned it down. Whitlam then turned to Sir John Kerr, the Chief Justice of New South Wales. Kerr was reluctant {{to give up the}} Chief Justiceship, in which he intended to remain another ten years, for the Governor-General's post, which traditionally lasted <b>five</b> <b>years.</b> <b>At</b> Kerr's request, Whitlam informally agreed that if both men were still in office in five years, Kerr would be reappointed. Whitlam also secured legislation to address Kerr's financial concerns about the position, including authorising a pension for the Governor-General or his widow. The Leader of the Opposition, Billy Snedden, was enthusiastic about the appointment and also agreed to reappoint Kerr in five years, were he Prime Minister at the time. Kerr then agreed to take the post, was duly appointed by Queen ElizabethII, and was sworn in on 11 July 1974.|$|E
5|$|Although {{subject to}} all {{national}} laws and government, the Antakarana are also {{united in their}} recognition of the authority of a king (Ampanjaka) who is the living descendent {{of a line of}} Antankarana royalty going back nearly four centuries. The authority of this king is reaffirmed every <b>five</b> <b>years</b> <b>at</b> the village of Ambatoharaña in a ritual mast-raising ceremony called the tsangantsainy. Although some accounts date the ritual back to the origins of Antankarana kingship, the specific features of the ceremony as practiced today are rooted in historical events of the 19th century. The ceremony includes a pilgrimage to Nosy Mitsio to commemorate the flight of Antankarana refugees to the island in the 1830s to escape the advancing armies of the Kingdom of Imerina and to visit the tombs of ancestors who died there; until recently, it has sometimes also included raising both French and Antankarana banners to honor the 1841 treaty signed with the French. The king is selected by a council of elder {{members of the royal family}} in the ruling line. He is responsible for reciting joro (ancestral invocations) at ceremonies where the ancestors' blessings are requested. Another important social role is that of the Ndriambavibe. The Antankarana community selects a single noble woman to hold this position, which has similar authority and importance to that of the king. She is not his wife; rather, she has a separate leadership role to fulfill. The Antankarana are recognized among Malagasy as one of the few remaining ethnic groups in Madagascar that continues to reassert the ancestral authority of their king through continued practice of traditional kingship rituals.|$|E
