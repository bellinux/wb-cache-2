40|$|Extract] On February 4, 1999, the Forestry Board of Papua New Guinea {{passed a}} {{resolution}} making the Kamula Doso <b>Forest</b> <b>Management</b> <b>Area</b> {{an extension of the}} adjacent Wawoi Guavi logging operation. At issue were some 780, 000 hectares in one of largest undisturbed rainforests {{in this part of the}} world. The decision effectively gave the operators of Wawoi Guavi a gift of timber worth around US$ 800 million. In making the decision the Forestry Board preempted any procedural requirements that Kamula Doso should be put to competitive tender, and left landowners with ambiguous claims to ownership of their timber. As a result of Papua New Guinea’s style of decision-making concerning the allocation of timber resources, the timber that was previously clearly owned by the landowners is now also subject to an array of claims by the state, loggers, non-governmental organizations, and international agencies. In this process, the original owners’ control of the resource is redefined and often diminished, as is their ability to ensure accountability and transparency in the decisions concerning the resource...|$|E

Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) has proven an effective tool to the quantification of the structural parameters and biomass loss on tropical forests.

The results demonstrated that: i. the use of crown projection area as independent variable was sufficient to produce a robust model to estimate the biomass of individual trees; ii. the number of trees extracted alone did not explained the biomass loss in the plots and iii. there was a strong relationship between the total biomass loss estimated by the subtraction of the biomass before and after logging and the biomass of the extracted trees. We suggest that this relationship should be used as a quality indicator of the applied forest management techniques. 201...|$|E
40|$|Among {{a variety}} of digital {{classification}} methods based on remote sensing images, the Maximum Likelihood (ML) is widely used in environmental studies, mainly for land cover and vegetation analysis. This study aimed {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of supervised classification by ML technique in a <b>forest</b> <b>management</b> <b>area</b> of dense ombrophilous forest, using one RapidEye image. With this purpose, it was conducted the census of species over 30 cm in diameter at breast height and calculated the Cover Value Index (CVI), and selected the 20 species with the highest CVI as a parameter for classification in a Geographic Information System. 13 of the 20 species selected in the study area were not identified by the classification method, and among the seven identified species, two were underestimated and the others were overestimated. Both the maximum likelihood technique and the spatial resolution of the image used were not suitable for supervised classification of native vegetation, with Kappa index of 0. 05 and global accuracy of 5. 53 %.
