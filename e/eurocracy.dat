50|$|During {{the period}} of reflection, which was called for by the European Council after the {{rejection}} of the Constitution for Europe by the French and the Dutch electorate, the game <b>Eurocracy</b> has been utilised in the YOU4UROPE Reflection Tour. The finals of the YOU4UROPE tour were held on June 7, 2006 in the European Parliament in Brussels. The participants presented their 'Fruits of Reflection' to the Vice-President on the European Commission Margot Wallström and to the Vice-President of the European Parliament Alejo Vidal-Quadras.|$|E
40|$|The European Union’s center-piece of {{economic}} policy making is the Lisbon process, which tries to make Europe the most competitive economic region {{in the world economy}} by 2010. EU Commission President Jose Manuel Durao Barroso recently presented a Centre for European Reform (CER) study that maintained that Denmark, Sweden and Austria are the best performing Lisbon process countries for 2005 and that Romania, Poland and Malta are the lowest ranked countries in the European Union in the same year. Due to lacking data, practically no serious conclusions can be drawn about Turkey. In the study, presented by the Commission President, some real finger pointing is made, with the “good” performers being called “heroes” and the “bad performers” being called “villains”. In the study, Poland was made the European chief “villain” (henceforth called, in keeping with this tendency towards abbreviations in the <b>eurocracy,</b> the ECV, for 2005). Our rigorous re-analysis of the data leads us {{to the conclusion that the}} ECV, i. e. the country characterized by past bad cumulated performance, and having no real prospect of things getting better is not Poland but Portugal. It emerges once again that the Lisbon process is in a dire state of affairs...|$|E

Univerzita Karlova, Fakulta sociálních věd, Institut mezinárodních studií. Katedra západoevropských studií. Vedoucí diplomové práce Doc. JUDr. PhDr. Ivo Šlosarčík, LL. M., Ph. D. Abstract The thesis seeks to map and explain the change of mind of President François Hollande {{with regard to the}} overall {{austerity}} in the eurozone. In early 2012, the President-to-be Hollande campaigned on a wave of desire for change and his campaign promises and election program promised a radically new approach towards economic and fiscal policies in the eurozone once he became president. The most explicit manifestation of this change should have been the renegotiation of the fiscal compact, formally the Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance in the Economic and Monetary Union. However, once in office, the new socialist president made very little to change the overall course of austerity at home and in the euro area. To explain this unexpected outcome, the thesis employs the sociological-political concept of the field of <b>Eurocracy,</b> derived from the sociology of Pierre Bourdieu and developed in the French academia by Didier Georgakakis and Jay Rowell. In such context, President [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Europe is {{not only}} the land of origin, but also the {{principal}} keeper of social rights, since it is associated with the concept of Europeanism. The obvious social restrictions in Hungary as well as in other countries of Europe in recent years make it absolutely reasonable to examine to what social-economic context the discernible withdrawal of welfare services provided by the state is attributable. The similar manifestations are supported by no means by the same system of social conditions. As to its basis and dating back to its historical origin, the current social policy of the EU is framed {{in the spirit of the}} conceptual system of the social state. The Fundamental Rights Charter (just as the “European Constitution Treaty”, as part of which it may become mandatory) does not reflect either the labour society or Europe of the peoples, but the conceptions of the capital, of political classes and <b>eurocracy.</b> Nevertheless: considering the power relations of global capitalism, we need to appreciate as an apparent actuality that in the midst of these relations the charter insists not only on the requirement of European unity, but also on a modernised version of the social conceptual system. The purpose of this treatise has been to highlight that social objectives cannot be treated as isolated from their economic and social context. We should not risk balance by the maintenance and preservation of a social-organisational framework via overspending, which altogether contradicts the possibility of development and the sustainability of equilibrated development...|$|E
