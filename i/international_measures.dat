500|$|Because Myotis alcathoe remains poorly known, it is {{assessed}} as [...] "Data Deficient" [...] on the IUCN Red List. However, {{it may be}} endangered {{because of}} its narrow ecological preferences. Reservoir construction may threaten the species' habitat in some places; two Greek sites {{where it has been}} recorded have already been destroyed. Forest loss is another possible threat, and the species may be restricted to undisturbed habitats. Because of its patchy distribution and likely small population, it probably does not easily colonize new habitats. The species is protected by national and <b>international</b> <b>measures,</b> but the IUCN Red List recommends further research on various aspects of the species as well as efforts to increase public awareness of the animal. In addition, old forests need to be conserved and the species' cave roosts need to be protected.|$|E
500|$|Indicators {{not already}} ranked on a 1 to 5 scale were {{converted}} {{by using the}} following formula: x=(x-Min(x))/(Max(x)-Min(x)) where Max(x) and Min(x) are the highest and lowest values for that indicator of the countries ranked in the index. The 0 to 1 scores that resulted were then converted to the 1 to 5 scale. Individual indicators were then weighted according to the expert panel's judgment of their importance. The scores were then tabulated into two weighted sub-indices: internal peace, weighted at 60% of a country's final score, and external peace, weighted at 40% of a country's final score. ‘Negative Peace’ which {{is defined as the}} absence of violence, or fear of violence is used as the definition of peace to create the Global Peace Index. An additional aim of the GPI database is to facilitate deeper study of the concept of positive peace, or those attitudes, institutions, and structures that drive peacefulness in society. The GPI also examines relationships between peace and reliable <b>international</b> <b>measures,</b> including democracy and transparency, education and material well-being. As such, it seeks to understand the relative importance of a range of potential determinants, or [...] "drivers", which may influence the nurturing of peaceful societies, both internally and externally.|$|E

2500|$|There {{seems to}} be little {{consensus}} about whether EKC is formed with regard to CO2 emissions, as CO2 is a global pollutant {{that has yet to}} prove its validity within Kuznet's Curve. Many EKC research papers that touch upon CO2 emissions have been published thus far, with various controversial results regarding the existence of the EKC. Therefore, the EKC for CO2 remains a matter of further research, and various <b>international</b> <b>measures</b> have been undertaken to address global warming, and so researchers are interested in whether or not some structural changes with regard to CO2 emissions have arisen on account of such measures. In addition, since CO2 is a global pollutant, its EKC is different depending on countries, and many factors such as whether it is developing or developed with income factors affect the graph.|$|E
