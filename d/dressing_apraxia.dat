50|$|Destruction to the {{inferior}} parietal lobule {{of the dominant}} hemisphere results in Gerstmann's syndrome: right-to-left confusion, finger agnosia, dysgraphia and dyslexia, dyscalculia, contralateral hemianopia, or lower quadrantanopia. Destruction to {{the inferior}} parietal lobule of the non-dominant hemisphere results in topographic memory loss, anosognosia, construction apraxia, <b>dressing</b> <b>apraxia,</b> contralateral sensory neglect, contralateral hemianopia, or lower quadrantanopia.|$|E
40|$|Longitudinal {{study of}} 4 {{cases of the}} {{interval}} form of carbon monoxide (CO) intoxication is presented along {{with the results of}} computerized tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The lucid interval, which describes the interval between the acute phase of intoxication and the emergence of the delayed neurological sequelae, varied from 17 to 32 days. In all four cases the most characteristic symptoms were mental deterioration, urinary and fecal incontinence, gait disturbance and mutism. In two of the cases other neuropsychological symptoms, such as spacial agnosia, finger agnosia, and <b>dressing</b> <b>apraxia</b> were experienced in two of the cases. CT scans in 3 of the 4 cases showed low density area in the white matter of the frontal lobe as the neuropathological substrate involved. The one case whose CT scan showed no abnormal signs in the white matter was investigated with MRI and an area of abnormality was identified in the periventricular region of the frontal lobe...|$|E
40|$|Background: Corticobasal {{syndrome}} (CBS) is {{a complex}} neurodegenerative disorder associated with parkinsonism and alien limb syndrome. <b>Dressing</b> and ideomotor <b>apraxia</b> were reportedly responsive to amantadine. Case Report: A 79 -year-old female was referred for evaluation of right hemiparesis. Neurological examination showed dementia, normal ocular movements, mild facial hypomimia, and bradykinesia with right hemiparesis. Nine years later, she developed alien limb syndrome and was diagnosed with CBS. After failure to respond to several medications, alien limb syndrome markedly improved with amantadine. Discussion: To {{the best of our}} knowledge, this is the first report of a consistent response of severe, forced dystonic alien limb syndrome to amantadine in a patient with CBS...|$|R
40|$|Scientific Background: Primary {{degenerative}} dementia {{can show}} different {{features in the}} early stages and can start with asymmetric or symmetric focal degeneration. Posterior cortical atrophy is a rare progressive dementia syndrome which can be evaluated, using neuropsychological tests and neuroimaging techniques, along with clinical features. Definitive diagnosis is made histopathologically. Objective: To discuss the clinical features of a case with posterior cortical atrophy, characterized by progressive visuospatial disorder, and the differential diagnosis, under the light of related literature. Results: Neurocognitive assessment revealed a serious visuospatial and constructional disturbance as well as facial recognition defects, <b>dressing</b> <b>apraxia</b> and agraphia, and a mild memory and verbal fluency impairment. Cranial MRI demonstrated bilateral parieto-occipital atrophy, and the SPECT investigation showed decreased perfusion in the right temporoparieto occipital region compared to the left hemisphere. Routine and other laboratory investigations were normal. Conclusion: The patient was started on memantine with a daily dose of 20 mg, twice a day. After four months, he became temporarily able to drive and park his tractor, but, the symptoms progressed later. (Archives of Neuropsychiatry 2009; 46 : 192 - 6...|$|E
