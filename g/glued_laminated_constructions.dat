Recently, light frame and <b>glued</b> <b>laminated</b> timber <b>constructions</b> were introduced to Korean housing industry from northern America. But Korean standards for strength properties of structural member were not established yet. Therefore, standards that related to size, quality, grading, and establishment of allowable properties for structural member {{would be necessary to}} improve Korean wood construction industries. As a first part of this effort, Korean Standards on “Softwood structural lumber”, and “Structural <b>glued</b> <b>laminated</b> timber” were established in the year of 1997. And additionally, Korean Standards on “Visual grading for softwood structural lumber ” and “Establishment of allowable properties for softwood structural lumber " were developed in 1999. In this report, major contents of these Korean Standards are summarized. But, these standards were established by limited information on experimental data of lumber strength properties. To improve these standards, more experimental data for lumber strength properties and relationship between characteristics and strength properties including measuring method o...|$|R

30|$|The use of <b>glued</b> <b>laminated</b> timber {{products}} in Japanese post and beam housing has grown {{dramatically in the}} last decade. This leads to a growing market for wood lamina which is a prior product for manufacturing <b>glued</b> <b>laminated</b> posts and beams in Japan. The Japanese Agricultural Standards (JAS) for <b>glued</b> <b>laminated</b> timber and structural <b>glued</b> <b>laminated</b> timber are dictated by the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF) Notification 1152 [1] and MAFF Notification 235 [2] respectively. This notification provides visual and machine grading requirements for various wood species of lamina. Manufacturers of the <b>glued</b> <b>laminated</b> timber {{have the option of}} visually or machine graded lamina on which the strength grades of <b>glued</b> <b>laminated</b> timber are based. The choice of the grading methods will often depend on the yields that can be achieved in visual grades as compared to the machine grades [3]. If the actual structural properties of the lamina in a particular species are higher than those visually graded, then there are technical and material benefits to be achieved by machine grading the laminae.|$|R

30|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the strength properties of <b>glued</b> <b>laminated</b> timber composed of edge-glued laminae and to investigate the influence of edge gluing on the strength properties. <b>Glued</b> <b>laminated</b> timber composed of multiple-grade laminae (symmetrical composition, strength grade E 95 -F 270, 10 laminations) was produced from karamatsu (Larix kaempferi) edge-glued laminae according to the Japanese Agricultural Standard. The bending, tensile, and compressive strengths of the <b>glued</b> <b>laminated</b> timber were measured. The average bending, tensile, and compressive strengths were 33.4, 24.5, and 35.9 MPa, respectively, and these values are almost equal to those of <b>glued</b> <b>laminated</b> timber composed of karamatsu single-piece laminae. It was determined that finger-joints and knots in the edge-glued laminae played a significant role in the failure of specimens. However, the use of glued edge-joints did not appear to affect the failure of specimens.|$|R

40|$|This diploma thesis {{deals with}} long span load bearing roof systems made of wooden elements. The first part {{explains}} the general characteristics of wood. It also describes the mechanical properties and presents {{their relation to}} wood type and the direction of loading by means of informational values. This part continues with the presentation of most commonly used fasteners {{as well as all}} required elements for proving the load-bearing capacity and specific features of <b>glued</b> <b>laminated</b> timber (glulam). The second part concentrates on <b>glued</b> <b>laminated</b> timber and describes its production and advantages and weaknesses in comparison to solid wood. It concentrates on particularities that are not connected to the use of solid wood. It analyizes the behaviour of these elements, the types of failure and the characteristics that lead to failure. Modelling of <b>glued</b> <b>laminated</b> elements is analyzed and the models for manual and computer analysis are shown that are continuously perfected. The next theme of this chapter are glues, the choice of which, besides the choice of wood, is of vital importance in the production of <b>glued</b> <b>laminated</b> trusses. The specificities of roof bows are shown, where the influence of the choice of statics system and longitudinal connections on the global stability of the construction is determined. The third part presents wooden trusses and different forms of roof constructions in relation to the greatest possible span, allowed by each construction. The analysis of most commonly used elements for connecting wooden parts of a truss is made. The development of models of trusses and their optimisation leads to the conclusion that deformations in the truss often result from movements at joints. The diploma thesisr presents other possibilities of using composite construction timber that is not <b>glued</b> <b>laminated</b> timber (glulam), with the intention of increasing the span of wooden load-bearing structures of roofs. Some examples of wooden load-bearing structures of roofs are presented and the diploma thesis notes that greatest spans are achieved both by trusses and by <b>glued</b> <b>laminated</b> timber, a combination of both or by other composite structures. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{main purpose}} of {{creating}} this object {{was to create a}} place where people having bad living situation will meet people who live regular lives. This is the reason why two floors were projected. The first floor is designed for social activities whereas the second floor is a housing part with apartments. The advantage of irregular but compact shape of the building is perfect connection between its functional parts. The object does not have any basement and it is placed in a little slopy bulit-up surroundings on the crossing of Tyršova and U Distance streets in Letohrad town. On the first floor there is a main entrance, a coffee, massages, a recreation hall, an art working-room, a gym, changing rooms, administration and the technological background of the object. The second floor does not cover a whole area of the first floor. Apartments, laundry room and drying room are situated here. One of the apartments here is projected as barrier-free as well as whole first floor. Both floors are connected by central staircase with shape of „U“ and an elevator. Roofing of the object is realized by single layered flat roof with classic layer order. The gym is roofed by a flat roof held by <b>glued</b> <b>laminated</b> girders. The <b>construction</b> was projected with regard to synergy of all used materials and systems.

40|$|AbstractThe {{strength}} of the bamboo increases from innner surface layer (endodermis) to outer surface layer (exodermis). The {{strength of}} bamboo can be utilized optimally by making <b>glue</b> <b>laminated</b> bamboo beams. The curved bamboo lamina {{as part of the}} <b>glue</b> <b>laminated</b> beam may be made by peeling off slightly the outer surface layer that contains high strength of fibers. The lamina thickness is made by disposing inner layer of the bamboo. The bamboo used in this work belongs to the species of Bambusa Dendrocalamus asper (local name: bambu Petung). This research aims to improve the shear and flexural {{strength of the}} <b>glue</b> <b>laminated</b> bamboo beams by modifying the shape of the cross section of the lamina (curved) rather than ordinary rectangular shape of the lamina. The dimensions of the cross-section of the lamina were of 7 / 20 mm and 9 / 20 mm. The laminas were preserved by immersing them in a hot water having chemical solution namely “Natrium Tetrabonat or CCB 4 ” with a concentration of 10 %. Having dry air the laminas were glued using adhesive type PVAC and were staked under 2. 5 MPa. The cross section dimensions of the beam specimen in shear and bending were of 70 / 100 - 900 mm and of 70 / 100 - 285 mm, and of 750 mm and 2700 mm long respectively. The simply supported <b>glue</b> <b>laminated</b> beams were tested upon two point loads at a distance of 1 / 3 the length of the span. The results showed that the <b>glue</b> <b>laminated</b> bamboo beams having curved type of laminas are stronger, more rigid, and more ductile compared to rectangular lamina type. Likewise, the <b>glue</b> <b>laminated</b> bamboo beams having 7 mm thick of lamina are stronger, stiffer, and ductile compared to the <b>glue</b> <b>laminated</b> beam with laminas of 9 mm thick. The average flexural strength of BBR 7 (rectangular, 7 mm thick of lamina), BBR 9 (rectangular, 9 mm thick of lamina), BBC 7 (curved, 7 mm thick of lamina) and BBC 9 (curved, 9 mm thick of lamina) are respectively (68. 80, 9. 28, 63. 28, 2. 00) N/mm 2. The flexural rigidity of related beams are respectively (68. 36, 71. 05, 75. 06, 65. 17) N/mm, and the ductility are respectively (2. 35, 2. 16, 1. 87, 2. 63).
