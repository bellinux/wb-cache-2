5|$|The Giants {{defeated}} the Redskins 24–14 in week 14 {{to move into}} sole possession of {{first place in the}} NFC East. The Redskins held Joe Morris, who had rushed for 181yards in the Giants week eight victory, to 62yards on 22 carries. However, Lawrence Taylor recorded three sacks and harassed Redskins' quarterback Jay Schroeder all game, as the Giants recorded four sacks and the Redskins only recorded one. Phil Simms threw touchdown passes to Mark Bavaro, Bobby Johnson, and Phil McConkey in the victory. Schroeder threw six interceptions in the game, matching Sammy Baugh's franchise record, and the Redskins had 7 turnovers overall. After the game, Parcells gave the Redskins credit for their performance and told the reporters that he <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> the two would meet again sometime in the playoffs.|$|E
500|$|The {{music for}} Halo 3 {{contained}} refinements and revisions to previous themes {{heard in the}} series, as O'Donnell {{stressed the importance of}} using previous motifs in the final installment of the trilogy; the composer wanted to [...] "blow out" [...] the epic sounds from the first game. O'Donnell also introduced a distinctive piano theme which had never been heard before, and first made its appearance in the Halo 3 announcement teaser. In an interview, O'Donnell stated that he has always approached music from the keyboard, and that at the Electronic Entertainment Expo—where the trailer would first be shown—he <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that,</b> [...] "no [...] would start with a piano." [...] O'Donnell planned on composing the music [...] "at the last minute", saying {{he had no intention of}} producing a large amount of music that would never be used. [...] "It drives everyone crazy but it worked for me in the past and it works for the game in the best way. Writing music before the end just doesn't work for me," [...] he said.|$|E
500|$|Julian Jarrold became {{attached}} {{to direct the}} film in early 2005. It was his second feature film, after Kinky Boots, which was released later that year. According to Bernstein, he [...] "liked [...] style as it was modern and visceral, and I just <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> he was the right choice. This piece needed to be handed with delicacy but also {{with a certain amount}} of brio and Julian was able to bring those two things to the production." [...] The director began work on the project in early 2006, rereading the novels Pride and Prejudice, Sense and Sensibility, and Persuasion and also reviewing Austen biographies such as Spence's book. Jarrold depended most heavily on the script, calling it [...] "a rich, witty and clever screenplay from someone who obviously knew his subject very well. It is a love story but much more besides. Kevin's screenplay has so many layers and interesting ideas. Apart from the love story I was very attracted by the themes of imagination and experience." [...] The director intended to [...] "bring Austen up to date by roughening her up a bit" [...] and adding [...] "more life and energy and fun," [...] opining that past Austen adaptations had been [...] "a little bit picture-postcard and safe and sweet and nice." ...|$|E

2500|$|Sabine Freudenberger, {{the first}} police officer {{to speak to}} Kampusch after her ordeal, {{said that she was}} {{astonished}} by her [...] "intelligence, her vocabulary". After two years, Přiklopil had brought her books, newspapers and a radio, which she kept tuned mainly to Ö1, an ORF station that is known for promoting education and classical music. She also states that she constantly <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> she lacked something: [...] "a deficit. So I wanted to make that better and I tried to educate myself, to teach myself skills. I have learned to knit for example." ...|$|E
2500|$|Palestinian militants {{expressed}} concern that the [...] "internationals" [...] staying in tents between the Israeli watchtowers and the residential neighborhoods would get caught in crossfire, while other residents were concerned that the activists might be spies. To overcome this suspicion Corrie learned a few words of Arabic and participated in a mock trial denouncing the [...] "crimes of the Bush Administration". While the ISM members were eventually provided with food and housing, a letter was circulated in Rafah that cast suspicion on them."Who are they? Why are they here? Who asked them to come here?" [...] On the morning of Corrie's death they planned to counteract the letter's effects. According to one of them, [...] "We all <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> our role was too passive. We talked about how to engage the Israeli military." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "This parcel, if you will. I <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> I'd {{rather not}} have it knock about in a mail-bag," [...] and the Doctor told him why.|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly," [...] he answered. [...] "That is, personally, I <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> he should. But {{that has}} nothing to do with the legal aspects of the case." ...|$|R
3000|$|... “The {{students}} made progress. They asked {{questions on the}} topics {{that they did not}} understand. I <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> they want to understand more about this subject [Optics].” [...]...|$|R
60|$|John <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> the {{interview}} was being taken at too rapid a pace. He felt confused.|$|E
60|$|Her very tone of {{submission}} troubled him. And he <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that,</b> {{if he had}} demanded, {{she would}} have acquiesced in anything.|$|E
60|$|Immediately he {{fell upon}} {{the problem with}} the most intense application, and Curtis <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> his little season of plain {{speaking}} had refreshed him.|$|E
6000|$|She rose emphatically. [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> you {{are both}} mistaken. Let me see her. Come, Victor, {{why do you}} shrink? It is but her garment lying there." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I shall go with you,' she answered, 'for, except you, I {{have no one}} in the world, and I <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> if we set out {{together}} we shall be lucky.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> I shall," [...] said Mr. Stiles, {{crossing}} glances {{with his}} friend. [...] "The {{only thing is}} my people; {{they want me to}} join them at Lord Tufton’s place." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Why did {{you leave}} her?' asked the Snow-man. He <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> such a being must be a lady. 'How could you leave such a place?' ...|$|E
60|$|I <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> this wasn't in the contract, {{but there}} wasn't {{anything}} to be done. It seemed brutal to leave the poor chap alone with the woman, so I went along.|$|E
60|$|Al {{fought for}} {{steadiness}} {{in the middle}} of the floor. The silence bothered him. He <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> he was about to begin swaying back and forth. He moistened his lips with his tongue.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll wait," [...] thought Mr. Quack, [...] "until that thing, {{whatever}} it is, {{comes out of}} those Black Shadows into the moonlight. Somehow I <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> we are in no danger." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nicholas, you {{say that}} you are doubtful. I <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> before long the King will {{announce}} his intention of marrying Sara Van Decht. Will you remain even then his faithful servant?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Spooky chuckled. [...] "I've got {{an empty}} stomach myself, Peter," [...] said he, [...] "but it isn't making me unhappy. I <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> somewhere there is a fat Mouse waiting for me." ...|$|R
60|$|Wrayson <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> {{the heat}} was {{becoming}} intolerable. He dared not look at Louise. His eyes were fixed upon the still expressionless face of the woman whose story was slowly unfolding its tragic course.|$|E
6000|$|... 'My Amy!--my own!--my Verena!'--and he {{held fast}} {{one of her}} hands, as they sat {{together}} on the sofa--'I <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> so it might be through the very worst, yet I can hardly believe it now.' ...|$|E
6000|$|And now I {{come to my}} travels. As {{the spring}} drew on I had <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> we could not live thus forever, with no market for our pelts. And one day my father said to me abruptly:-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> it {{is still}} in the {{dangerous}} stage," [...] he said. [...] "But I will go." [...] He said this in a tone of desperation which amused them all very much.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> {{something}} {{is going to happen to}} some of them, and they will never come back to me, or come back changed. Well, I can only say, God be with my boys!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I've {{tried to}} do the work as well as I could, sir," [...] I replied. [...] "But I don't like the grocery business, or any other business. I <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> I'm not made for it." ...|$|R
60|$|She {{would go}} round {{to the studio}} and see Kirk. After all, it was his affair as much as anybody else's, and she <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> {{it would be easier}} to break the news to him than to Ruth and Mrs. Porter.|$|E
60|$|Josie {{hesitated a}} moment what to do, yet {{instinct}} urged her to follow. She <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> {{she was on the}} verge of an important discovery, that events were about to happen which had been wholly unforeseen even by old Cragg himself.|$|E
6000|$|Anne {{could not}} get back her self-control. Her nerves were [...] "all strung up," [...] as she would have said. She <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> she {{was right on the}} brink of a [...] "scene," [...] but she could not help herself.|$|E
5000|$|On {{the flip}} side, Walter Kerr said, [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> if Platinum {{could just get}} rid of its book, its songs, its {{microphones}} and its almost arrogantly messy setting, it would be light miles ahead." ...|$|R
6000|$|As the day wore on I said to him, [...] "It {{seems like}} Sunday to me. I <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> mother and Zulime are away at church {{and that they}} may, at any moment, come in together." ...|$|R
5000|$|July 11 [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> the {{administration}} is getting concerned about the bulk phone records collection, {{and that they are}} thinking about whether to move administratively to stop it. I think we are making a comeback".|$|R
