5|$|Deep dives {{should be}} made only after a gradual {{training}} to test the individual diver's sensitivity to increasing depths, with careful supervision and logging of reactions. Diving organizations such as Global Underwater Explorers (GUE) <b>emphasize</b> <b>that</b> such sessions are {{for the purpose of}} gaining experience in recognizing the onset symptoms of narcosis for an individual , which are somewhat more repeatable than for the average group of divers. Scientific evidence does not show that a diver can train to overcome any measure of narcosis at a given depth or become tolerant of it.|$|E

5|$|Several {{natural causes}} (diseases) have been suggested, {{including}} malaria and typhoid fever. A 1998 {{article in the}} New England Journal of Medicine attributed his death to typhoid fever complicated by bowel perforation and ascending paralysis. Another recent analysis suggested pyogenic (infectious) spondylitis or meningitis. Other illnesses fit the symptoms, including acute pancreatitis and West Nile virus. Natural-cause theories also tend to <b>emphasize</b> <b>that</b> Alexander's health {{may have been in}} general decline after years of heavy drinking and severe wounds. The anguish that Alexander felt after Hephaestion's death may also have contributed to his declining health.|$|E

The leagues were not only led by socialists and anarchists; some were run by local gentry and mafiosi. The Mafia bosses Vito Cascioferro and Nunzio Giaimo led the Fasci in Bisacquino in alliance with Verro.

5|$|After her audience's {{demand to}} {{continue}} performing similar songs, Gočeva decided {{to record a}} second album in the same musical direction. Makedonsko Devojče 2 is a successor to the album released in 2008 and it contains songs composed in the vein of Macedonian folklore. The plans to record the album were revealed by Gočeva during an interview in May 2012 with the magazine Naš Svet, confirming that she had already begun with the song selection process for the track listing of the second edition of the project Makedonsko Devojče. In {{the initial stages of}} the album's development, Makedonsko Devojče 2 served only as a working title and later became its official title in order to <b>emphasize</b> <b>that</b> the musical style is {{the same as that of}} Makedonsko Devojče (2008).|$|E
5|$|The {{corresponding}} {{concept for}} undirected graphs is a forest, an undirected graph without cycles. Choosing an orientation for a forest produces {{a special kind}} of directed acyclic graph called a polytree. However there are many other kinds of directed acyclic graph that are not formed by orienting the edges of an undirected acyclic graph. Moreover, every undirected graph has an acyclic orientation, an assignment of a direction for its edges that makes it into a directed acyclic graph. To <b>emphasize</b> <b>that</b> DAGs are {{not the same thing as}} directed versions of undirected acyclic graphs, some authors call them acyclic directed graphs or acyclic digraphs.|$|E

5|$|The {{death of}} Botaneiates {{and the four}} more years of war that {{followed}} indicate that the Byzantine success was not complete. Some modern historians doubt that the Bulgarian defeat was as complete as described by Skylitzes and Kekaumenos. Other historians <b>emphasize</b> <b>that</b> the death of Emperor Samuel two months later was much more fateful for Bulgaria. His heirs Gabriel Radomir and Ivan Vladislav were unable to effectively resist the attacks of Basil II, and Bulgaria was completely defeated in 1018. In that year Emperor Ivan Vladislav was killed in a battle at Dyrrhachium, and Bulgaria became a province of the Byzantine Empire until the successful uprising led by the Asen brothers in 1185.|$|E
5|$|Loring Danforth, a {{professor}} of anthropology at Bates College, asserts that ethnic Macedonian nationalists, who are concerned with demonstrating the continuity between ancient and modern Macedonians, deny they are Slavs and claim to be the direct descendants of Alexander the Great and the ancient Macedonians. Danforth stresses, however, that the more moderate Macedonian position, publicly endorsed by Kiro Gligorov, the first president of the Republic of Macedonia, is modern Macedonians have no relation to Alexander the Great, but are a Slavic people whose ancestors arrived in Macedonia in the sixth century AD. Proponents of both the extreme and the moderate Macedonian positions stress that the ancient Macedonians were a distinct non-Greek people. In addition to affirming the existence of the Macedonian nation, Macedonians are concerned with affirming the existence of a unique Macedonian language as well. They thus <b>emphasize</b> <b>that</b> the Macedonian language has a history dating to the Old Church Slavonic used by Saints Cyril and Methodius in the ninth century.|$|E
