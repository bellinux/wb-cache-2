5|$|With the {{declaration}} of war against Sweden on 2 September 1675, Denmark saw a chance to regain its recently lost eastern provinces. The southern Baltic became an important strategic theatre for both <b>Denmark</b> <b>and</b> Sweden.

As war broke out between <b>Denmark</b> <b>and</b> Sweden a strong naval presence also became essential for Sweden to secure its interests at home and overseas.|$|E
