Is the <b>grazing</b> <b>exclusion</b> management strategy effective for the vegetation restoration of degraded alpine grasslands? Three alpine grassland types were selected in Tibet to investigate the effect of <b>grazing</b> <b>exclusion</b> on plant community structure and biomass. Our results showed that species biodiversity indicators, including the Pielou evenness index, the Shannon–Wiener diversity index, and the Simpson dominance index, did not significantly change under <b>grazing</b> <b>exclusion</b> conditions. In contrast, the total vegetation cover, the mean vegetation height of the community, and the aboveground biomass were significantly higher in the <b>grazing</b> <b>exclusion</b> grasslands than in the free grazed grasslands. These results indicated that <b>grazing</b> <b>exclusion</b> is an effective measure for maintaining community stability and improving aboveground vegetation growth in alpine grasslands. However, the statistical analysis showed that the growing season precipitation (GSP) plays a more important role than <b>grazing</b> <b>exclusion</b> in which influence on vegetation in alpine grasslands. In addition, because the results of the present study come from short term (6 – 8 years) <b>grazing</b> <b>exclusion,</b> it is still uncertain whether these improvements will be continuable if <b>grazing</b> <b>exclusion</b> is continuously implemented.

Despite a lot of field experiments, there is still controversy {{on the effects of}} <b>grazing</b> <b>exclusion</b> on rangeland restoration, highlighting the need for synthetic analysis. We conducted a meta analysis of 447 entries from 78 papers to analyze the spatiotemporal effects of <b>grazing</b> <b>exclusion</b> on plant diversity, productivity and soil carbon sequestration in the major RGLG-implemented provinces of China. Our results showed that, compared with the grazed sites, <b>grazing</b> <b>exclusion</b> significantly increased carbon stored in aboveground biomass, litter mass, belowground biomass and soils by 84. 7 %, 111. 6 %, 25. 5 % and 14. 4 %, respectively. Plant coverage, soil available nitrogen, soil available phosphorus and soil microbial biomass carbon increased by 52. 0 %, 21. 7 % 22. 8 % and 26. 3 %, respectively. However, <b>grazing</b> <b>exclusion</b> had little effects on recovering plant diversity in China's grasslands. Of the factors examined, climatic factors strongly modified the effects of <b>grazing</b> <b>exclusion</b> on ecosystem carbon stocks, for example, precipitation significantly amplified the positive effects. <b>Grazing</b> <b>exclusion</b> played a positive role in soil carbon sequestration in most grassland types except in temperate desert-steppe. But annual soil carbon sequestration rates decayed rapidly over time in both alpine meadow and temperate steppe. Short-term (< 5 years) <b>grazing</b> <b>exclusion</b> remarkably increased species richness, but not significantly in the long run. The threshold from neutral to negative effects of <b>grazing</b> <b>exclusion</b> on species evenness occurs after approximately ten years. Our findings provide evidence that <b>grazing</b> <b>exclusion</b> is an effective way to restore vegetation and sequestrate carbon in degraded grasslands, but not beneficial to plant diversity maintenance. The benefits of <b>grazing</b> <b>exclusion</b> are more effective in humid area than arid area. We suggest that <b>grazing</b> <b>exclusion</b> should be ceased after about six to ten years.

Material and methods - The species composition of the aboveground vegetation and the soil seed bank were examined on sites after a 25 -year <b>grazing</b> <b>exclusion</b> in a typical steppe on the Loess Plateau, NW China. Key results - Results showed that long-term <b>grazing</b> <b>exclusion</b> significantly improved vegetation cover, biomass and aboveground species evenness. Long-term <b>grazing</b> <b>exclusion</b> significantly increased species richness and seed density in the soil seed bank, but significantly decreased belowground species evenness. The seeds were mainly present in the litter and the topsoil (0 - 5 cm), accounting for about 76 % of the total seed number. Exclusion of grazing significantly decreased seed depletion in soil seed bank from April to July as compared to grazed sites. The Sorensen similarity index between aboveground and belowground species composition was low in the typical steppe, and long-term <b>grazing</b> <b>exclusion</b> did not significantly improve this similarity. Conclusion - Our results suggest that long-term <b>grazing</b> <b>exclusion</b> can significantly improve both aboveground and belowground species diversity in the steppe vegetation of the Loess Plateau, but has little or no effect on the similarity in composition between the two compartments...|$|E

A Catena 59 (2005) 267 – 278 www. elsevier. com/locate/catenanorthern China. Excluding grazing livestock is considered as an alternative to restore vegetation in degraded sandy grassland in this region. However, few data are available concerning the impacts of continuous <b>grazing</b> and livestock <b>exclusion</b> on soil properties. In this paper, characteristics of vegetation and soil properties under continuous <b>grazing</b> and <b>exclusion</b> of livestock for 5 and 10 years were examined in representative degraded sandy grassland. Continuous grazing resulted in a considerable decrease in ground cover, which accelerates soil erosion by wind, leading to a further coarseness in surface soil, loss of soil organic C and N, and a decrease in soil biological properties. The grassland under continuous grazing is in the stage of very strong degradation. Excluding livestock grazing enhances vegetation recovery, litter accumulation, and development of annual and perennial grasses. Soil organic C and total N concentrations, soil biological properties including some enzyme activities and basal soil respiration improved following 10 -year exclusion of livestock, suggesting that degradation of the grassland is being reversed. The results suggest that excluding grazing livestock on the desertified sandy grassland in the erosion-prone Horqin region has a great potential to restore soil fertility, sequester soil organic carbon and improve biological activity.

Similarly, soil C and N storage increased by 15. 3 % (12. 9 Mg C ha(- 1)) and 10. 2 % (0. 8 Mg N ha(- 1)) after 10 -yr mowing, respectively, and 19. 2 % (16. 2 Mg C ha(- 1)) and 7. 1 % (0. 6 Mg N ha(- 1)) after 26 -yr mowing, respectively. In contrast, soil C and N storage declined by 10. 6 % (9. 0 Mg C ha(- 1)) and 11. 4 % (0. 9 Mg N ha(- 1)) after 49 -yr reclamation, respectively. Moreover, increases in C and N storage mainly occurred in {{sand and silt}} fractions in the 0 - 10 cm soil layer with <b>grazing</b> <b>exclusion</b> and mowing. Our findings provided evidence that Inner Mongolian grasslands {{have the capacity to}} sequester C and N in soil with improved management practices, which were in the order: <b>grazing</b> <b>exclusion</b> > mowing > winter grazing > reclamation...|$|E
40|$|Disturbance by {{domestic}} grazing {{is recognized as}} the most widespread stressor of biological soil crust (BSC) communities. To assess {{the recovery of the}} BSC after <b>grazing</b> <b>exclusion,</b> we estimated the composition, cover, and spatial distribution of biological soil crusts, and their influence on soil nitrogen in a protected area after 40 years of <b>grazing</b> <b>exclusion</b> (Reserve MaB of Ñacuñán), and in its surrounding grazed matrix in the central Monte Desert. We considered two spatial scales: at the landscape scale we estimated vegetation and BSC cover in paired grazed and ungrazed sites of Larrea shrublands; at the microsite scale we assessed the influence of the dominant vascular plant, Larrea cuneifolia, on crust cover, and the influence of crust cover on soil nitrogen concentration. Grazing has a negative impact on soil crusts, which only develop under the protection of vascular plants in grazing areas. <b>Grazing</b> <b>exclusion</b> favors crust recovery, allowing black, lichen dominated crusts to develop in exposed areas between shrub canopies. The cover of the moss-dominated crusts was not significantly different at any of the two spatial scales analyzed. Soil nitrogen was higher in areas under L. cuneifolia and without BSC cover, suggesting that litterfall inputs currently exceed those from soil crust N 2 fixation, perhaps because crust function has not yet recovered...|$|E
40|$|We {{evaluated}} {{the impact of}} 7 years of <b>grazing</b> <b>exclusion</b> on vegetation and belowground properties related to soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling in grazed, upland grassland in northern England. For this, we compared a landscape-level, moorland restoration project (<b>grazing</b> <b>exclusion)</b> with adjacent continuously grazed acidic grasslands to test whether changes in vegetation composition after restoration impacted on soil properties including soil C storage. <b>Grazing</b> <b>exclusion</b> significantly increased the proportion of dwarf-shrubs {{at the expense of}} graminoids. Despite high seasonal variability, this change in vegetation was associated with increased plant litter mass, soil moisture content and the ratio of dissolved organic to inorganic N, and reductions in rates of ammonium mineralisation, soil microbial activity, and microbial biomass N. Our observations suggest that grazing-exclusion as a restoration tool for upland habitats results in a slowing down of rates of C and N cycling. However, as yet, this has had no detectable impact on total C and N stocks in surface soil. Whereas increases in soil C and N stocks might be expected in the longer term, our results suggest that a certain level of grazing is compatible with the provision of ecosystem services such as soil C storage under traditional upland farming practices...|$|E
30|$|Dendrochronological {{methods were}} applied to {{reconstruct}} the historic occurrence of fires at a Cross Timbers forest-grassland transition site within the Wichita Mountains of southwestern Oklahoma, USA. Sixty fire events occurred within the period 1712 to 2006 (294 years). The mean fire interval (MFI) was 4.4 years for a pre-Euro-American settlement period (pre- 1901) and increased to a MFI of 5.2 years after 1901. During the period between 1855 and 1880, which corresponds with the prolonged severe drought called the Civil War drought, the mean fire interval was 1.7 years. Although twentieth century fire frequency has not been significantly decreased, the severity of fires appears to be lessened due to alterations to the fire environment through <b>grazing</b> and fire <b>exclusion.</b> Eastern red-cedar (Juniperus virginiana L.) expansion now poses significant challenges to forest and range management, particularly its control through prescribed fire. In the future, fire managers throughout the Cross Timbers region are likely to face similar challenges and look toward quantitative and science-based information about the historic fire regime for guidance.|$|R
40|$|Piñon–juniper {{is a major}} {{vegetation}} type in western North America. Effective management of these ecosystems has been hindered by inadequate understanding of 1) the variability in ecosystem structure and ecological processes that exists among the diverse combinations of piñons, junipers, and associated shrubs, herbs, and soil organisms; 2) the prehistoric and historic disturbance regimes; and 3) the mechanisms driving changes in vegetation structure and composition during the past 150 yr. This article summarizes what we know (and don 2 ̆ 7 t know) about three fundamentally different kinds of piñon–juniper vegetation. Persistent woodlands are found where local soils, climate, and disturbance regimes are favorable for piñon, juniper, or a mix of both; fires have always been infrequent in these woodlands. Piñon–juniper savannas are found where local soils and climate are suitable for both trees and grasses; it is logical that low-severity fires may have maintained low tree densities before disruption of fire regimes following Euro-American settlement, but information is insufficient to support any confident statements about historical disturbance regimes in these savannas. Wooded shrublands are found where local soils and climate support a shrub community, but trees can increase during moist climatic conditions and periods without disturbance and decrease during droughts and following disturbance. Dramatic increases in tree density have occurred in portions of all three types of piñon–juniper vegetation, although equally dramatic mortality events have also occurred in some areas. The potential mechanisms driving increases in tree density—such as recovery from past disturbance, natural range expansion, livestock <b>grazing,</b> fire <b>exclusion,</b> climatic variability, and CO 2 fertilization—generally have not received enough empirical or experimental investigation to predict which is most important in any given location. The intent of this synthesis is 1) to provide {{a source of information}} for managers and policy makers; and 2) to stimulate researchers to address the most important unanswered questions...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to evaluate the effects of different types of disturbance on the ability of the natural grassland to avoid the invasion of Eragrostis plana Nees (South African lovegrass). The experiment was carried out in Dom Pedrito, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, in an area free of South African lovegrass, from Feb. 2004 to Apr. 2007. The treatments were: 1) grassland management regimes: exclusion; low grazing intensity (rotational grazing), ± 10 cm; and high grazing intensity (continuous grazing), ± 5 cm; 2) initial levels of soil disturbance: high grassland, ± 10 cm; low grassland, ± 5 cm height; and low grassland with scarified soil; 3) fertilization regimes: without fertilization; phosphorus; and nitrogen. The experimental design was a split-split-plot type in complete blocks, with three replicates. Three winter cultivated species - Trefoil repens L., Lotus corniculatus L., Lolium multiflorum Lam. and South African lovegrass - were sown in 54 split-splitplots (split-plots: low grassland, and low grassland with scarified soil). The other 27 split-split-plots (split-plots: high grassland) were sown only with South African lovegrass. The grassland height, plant number of South African lovegrass, grassland dry mass and photosynthetic active radiation intercepted (FARint) at the soil level were recorded. The fertilization regimes did not influence the South African lovegrass plant number. The initial levels of soil disturbance and grassland management regimes influenced the invasion of South African lovegrass. The invasion was favored by the lower grassland height and lower forage mass, higher intensity of the soil disturbance, and higher FARint due to the continuous grazing. On the contrary, higher grassland height, higher forage mass, lower soil disturbance and lower FARint, associated with rotational <b>grazing</b> or <b>exclusion,</b> showed higher potential to control the invasion of South African lovegrass in the natural grassland...|$|R
40|$|Tibetan alpine grasslands {{are viewed}} to be {{sensitive}} to climate change and grazing disturbance. But it is not well understood how and to what extent <b>grazing</b> <b>exclusion</b> affects species assembly on the Northern Tibetan Plateau. We conducted a multisite transect along a precipitation gradient to detect species compositional changes at 25 grazed versus nongrazed paired pastures in summers of 2009 and 2010 in the Changtang Natural Reserve. Species richness and relative frequency were estimated for plant functional groups (PFGs: grasses, sedges, forbs, and legumes). Species richness at community level responds positively to precipitation and differs among vegetation types: meadow (22. 63 +/- 1. 73) > steppe (11. 23 +/- 1. 00) > desert-steppe (6. 75 +/- 0. 63). Variations in species richness and relative frequency of PFGs are partly dependent on vegetation type. Three to four years of <b>grazing</b> <b>exclusion</b> has not significantly changed species richness or relative frequency at PFG level. <b>Grazing</b> <b>exclusion</b> has slightly changed PFGs' correlations in species richness but significantly altered their correlations in relative frequency within and across vegetations. Stepwise linear regressions indicate that PFGs respond to climate gradients in discrete ways. This study implies that specific adaptation mechanisms of different taxonomic groups to climatic change and grazing disturbance should be seriously considered in further studies...|$|E
40|$|To better {{understand}} the ecological and economic benefits of short-term <b>grazing</b> <b>exclusion</b> on the aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) of alpine pastures, we conducted annual multi-site transect surveys in the summers from 2009 to 2011 and calculated the aboveground biomass discrepancy (ABD) between grazed and ungrazed pastures at plant community and economic group levels for three zonal alpine grassland types-meadow, steppe, and desert-steppe-across the northern Tibetan Plateau. Our results indicated that aboveground biomass (AGB) significantly differed among grassland types and declined northwesterly from 64. 07 to 11. 44 g m(- 2) with decreasing precipitation and increasing temperature. The mean ABD exhibited considerable community dependency, with meadow (12. 47 g m(- 2)) > steppe (6. 91 g m(- 2)) > desert steppe (2. 54 g m(- 2)), and it declined from 25. 42 to 1. 29 g m(- 2) with decreasing precipitation and increasing temperature. 'Good forage', i. e. grasses and sedges, benefited most from <b>grazing</b> <b>exclusion,</b> followed by edible forbs. With longer <b>grazing</b> <b>exclusion</b> durations (GEDs), the aboveground biomass of poisonous locoweeds initially decreased and then increased compared with the adjacent grazed sites. In the nested analysis of co-variances with a general linear model, growing season precipitation (GSP; from May to September) accounted for 52. 67 % of the observed variation in AGB, followed by AGT (9. 77 %) and pasture management systems (PMSs; grazing or grazing-excluded, 5. 31 %). The variation in ABD was explained primarily by AGT (16. 52 %), GED (20. 25 %), and the interaction of AGT x GED (19. 58 %). Our results confirm that precipitation is the primary factor controlling the ANPP of alpine grasslands on the Northern Tibetan Plateau and that the ecological benefits arising from <b>grazing</b> <b>exclusion</b> are also partly dependent on grassland type and exclusion duration. Therefore, spatial and temporal variations in growing season precipitation and plant functional traits or economic group composition should be jointly considered when developing policies concerning the management and spatial layouts of grazing exclosures in this region...|$|E

40|$|Forbs {{dominate}} southern Africa's rangeland plant diversity, {{but have}} been ignored in favour of grasses that are important for livestock production. To facilitate better conservation management I examined the interaction between patterns of diversity, forb recruitment and disturbance effects across the mesic to semi-arid rangelands east of the escarpment in southern Africa. Results were compared to a well studied North American tallgrass prairie, Konza. Sampled between 1 m 2 and 1000 m 2 across 25 sites, species and family richness increased with mean annual precipitation up to â 2000 m a. s. l., above which cooler temperatures accounted for a decline. Forb functional types ranged from persistent (long-lived, resprouters) in the fire-prone mesic rangelands to more recruiting (short-lived, reseeders) taxa in the drought-prone semi-arid areas. Mesic rangelands should therefore tolerate frequent, low intensity defoliation, and semiarid floras be better suited to infrequent intense disturbances. Seedling recruitment matched richness patterns, primarily increasing with precipitation. Recruitment was highest in the fire treatment at the three mesic sites, but proportionately higher in the animal digging and drought treatments at the three semi-arid sites. Seedling composition differed from the adult sward, suggesting that some species may not recolonise transformed lands. Despite predictions of the Milchunas et al. (1988) and Olff and Ritchie (1998) <b>grazing</b> models, <b>exclusion</b> of large mammalian grazers from 40 m x 40 m plots {{did not appear to}} impact forb diversity. Instead, grazing effects sampled in 100 x 1 m' quadrats per treatment, across ten sites, were overridden by the mesic to semi-arid gradient along which the sites were orientated. Species richness declined under heavy communal cattle grazing along fence-line contrasts at two mesic sites, with soft-leaved monocot (orbs being replaced by short-lived divot weeds not found inside the adjacent lightly grazed nature reserves. Marked differences in the diversity and disturbance responses of tallgrass prairie and southern African rangelands suggest that management strategies cannot be extrapolated from similar ecosystems around the world...|$|R
40|$|Evaluation {{of plant}} {{richness}} and diversity {{is important in}} rangeland ecosystems because biological control, conservation of genetic resources and the control of natural ecosystems are possible by identifying diversity. One of the factors affecting the richness and diversity is animals' utilization of the vegetation. Therefore, this research was done to study the plant richness and diversity response to different treatments of animals. To this end, four sites with none, half, equal and twice as much grazing capacity were selected. Treatments were identified due to vegetation cover changes, distance from water, distance from the village and grazing times. Using located transects, samples were (systematic randomization) taken from vegetation (transects four and plots 40 and in the area a total of 160 plots were harvested). The {{results showed that the}} highest species richness and diversity belonged to sites' grazing capacity equal and grazing capacity half. But this was the least in the without-grazing site. Thus, animals' exploiting the rangelands properly (grazing capacity equal and grazing capacity half) can increase the richness and diversity. Lack of rangeland long-term grazing leads to poor plants. So, both severe <b>grazing</b> and long-term <b>exclusion</b> should be avoided. The full protection of rangeland does not necessarily lead to the maximum diversity...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D. (Environmental Science)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2007. Concerns {{were raised}} {{over the past}} decades, on the {{degradation}} condition of arid and semi-arid rangelands in South Africa, mainly in areas under communal land management. Baseline information on soil quality is essential to monitor changes in land conditions and assess impacts of land uses and management over time. The objectives of this study, initiated {{within the framework of}} the Desert Margins Program, were to characterize and establish baseline indicators of soil quality health, and to investigate the potential effects of <b>grazing</b> and <b>exclusion</b> management (hypothesized as grazing effect) on selected soil properties in the western Bophirima District in South Africa. Soils were characterized for physical, chemical, enzymatic activity and microbial biomass properties, and grazing effects were evaluated on selected properties. The aboveground herbaceous species composition and biomass production were also determined. Sandy, poor fertile soils (low organic carbon and phosphorus) characterized all sites. Various levels of enzymatic and microbial biomass were recorded at the sites. Grazing had no significant effects on most of soil chemical properties, but did affect selected enzymatic activities, site-specifically. No significant differences of grazing effects were observed on soil microbial biomass. The inconsistent responses of soil properties across the sites prompt to caution regarding the generalization and/or extrapolation of grazing effects to other areas, without consideration of the prevailing environmental and management characteristics to each site. Notwithstanding the alarming plea about degradation at these communal sites, indicators of soil quality did not significantly differ between communal and surrounding commercial and/or game managed areas, despite their apparent vegetation degradation. The results showed that rangeland under the communal management were characterized by increaser species of low grazing value, but this situation did not necessarily interpret severe soil degradation as tacitly described. Soil degradation depends on land use, management and environmental conditions, and references are needed to assess degradation. Important interrelationships between the aboveground vegetation and soil belowground activity were observed. This emphasized the need to integrate both soil and vegetation into rangeland monitoring, as these interrelationships and associated ecological processes sustain rangeland health. Further research is needed to re-examine the "inferred degradation of rangelands in communal areas, taking into consideration their history, and using appropriate baselines and references sites. Only then, can degradation trends and hotspots be identified and thereof, appropriate management decisions (through participatory research) taken locally to combat degradation and sustain long-term rangeland resources uses.
