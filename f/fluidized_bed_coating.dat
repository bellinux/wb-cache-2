40|$|AbstractThe {{modelling}} {{of particle}} growth in <b>fluidized</b> <b>bed</b> <b>coating</b> processes is often done with population balance equations, which require a mathematical {{formulation of the}} process kinetics. In many cases the resulting equations need to be solved numerically. Therefore a discretization is needed, which may have influence on the solution. In this study, a stochastic way of modelling particle growth for coating processes, namely the Monte-Carlo method, is presented. This method {{does not require a}} formulation of the process kinetics and also no discretization of the property domain is needed. The <b>fluidized</b> <b>bed</b> <b>coating</b> process is described by a sequence of three micro-processes: droplet deposition, droplet drying and solidification. The results of the Monte-Carlo method and a population balance model are compared with each other to check theoretical validity of the derived model. Additionally, the results of the Monte-Carlo method are compared with experimental data gained from coating experiments in a lab-scale fluidized bed...|$|E

40|$|Microencapsulation {{is defined}} as a process in which small {{particles}} or droplets are surrounded by a coating in order to obtain small capsules with many valuable properties. One of the most commonly used and most promising techniques to realise microencapsulation in the food industry is <b>fluidized</b> <b>bed</b> <b>coating.</b> The effectiveness of the <b>fluidized</b> <b>bed</b> <b>coating</b> process can be verified by the quantification of the coating quality. Verification of coating quality is an important issue for companies that produce encapsulated food ingredients since deviations from the intended value of coating thickness may cause problems related to release of core material. The main goal of this PhD {{study was to examine the}} quality of coatings obtained from four selected water-soluble cellulose derivatives: methylcellulose, low and high viscous type of carboxymethylcellulose and hydroxypropylcellulose. The quality of the coatings was examined for two aspects: coating morphology and coating strength. To this end, the Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy (CLSM) was used to determine the coating morphology and the repeated impact tests (RIT) were applied to evaluate the attrition strength of cellulose derivative coatings on various core materials.

40|$|The {{process of}} {{altering}} {{and changing the}} properties of the energetic materials by coating has been studied extensively by several scientific groups. According to the desired application different coating techniques have been developed and applied to achieve satisfactory results. Among the already developed and used techniques are: ALD (atomic layer deposition), CVD (chemical vapor deposition), FEM (fluid energy mill), crystallization, aerosol-spray pyrolysis, Ziegler-Natta reaction and others. In TNO Defence, Security and Safety in The Netherlands, a facility for coating of energetic materials has been constructed. We propose a new plasma coating technique for energetic materials where a new type of Dielectric Barrier Discharge (DBD) is used with sufficiently improved production rates. Our facility aims to treat powders in the low micron range and at ambient temperature. The range of materials that can be treated is not restricted by their temperature sensitivity. Our facility is based on circulating solid-gas <b>fluidized</b> <b>bed.</b> The <b>coating</b> capacity is approximately 40 g of energetic powder material per minute. This is possible because of the re-circulation nature of the <b>fluidized</b> <b>bed.</b> The precursors are introduced in the system in gas phase.

40|$|<b>Fluidized</b> <b>bed</b> <b>coating</b> (FBC) is {{a process}} where {{preheated}} material is dipped into a flowing liquid bed of powder. Although FBC has existed {{for more than half}} a century, however there is little knowledge about the fluidized bed design that gives excellent fluidization quality as well as reducing powder entrainment. The objectives of this thesis are to investigate the effect of two different types of distributor with different pressure drop on powder coating, hydrodynamics of <b>fluidized</b> <b>bed</b> <b>coating</b> process, and effect of flow rate on powder coating quality such as thickness, uniformity, reduced entrainment and current leakage. The understanding and research finding is the key to the design of an industrial scale fluidized bed powder coater. A pilot fluidized bed coater was designed and built to run the experimental work for the study on pressure drops and also coating experiments using epoxy powder on copper bars. Pure copper bars with a purity of 99. 99 % were used for coating. The quality of the coated samples such as the coating thickness and current leakage were evaluated. Continuous and repetitive dipping method was experimented to study on the coating thickness at different processing time. At a continuous dipping of 14 seconds, and with air flow rates of 3 LPM, 8 LPM and 12 LPM, the coating thickness achieved were 1079. 2 Î¼m, 1275. 8 Î¼m and 659. 2 Î¼m respectively. Using repetitive method, overall coating thickness is lower than continuous coating at the same dipping time. The current leakage shows that low air flow rate for continuous dipping method has the lowest current leakage at the similar coating thickness at 720 Î¼m compared to repetitive dipping method. Its leakage is 0. 53 mA compared to normal air flow rate at 0. 68 mA and high air flow rate at 0. 75 mA. Different dipping methods were studied to understand the difference between continuous dipping and repetitive dipping on the coating uniformity on the bar. It was found that continuous dipping gave a more uneven coating on the samples which can be observed through the large standard deviation error bar. Further study on the effect of different air distributor pressure drops was also carried out. Theoretically the pressure drop of distributor ratio against the bed height should be in the range of 0. 1 to 0. 3 to ensure a good bed rise with few bubbles. It was found that distributor B with a higher bed height of 0. 3 m gave a ratio within this range as compared to distributor A where only 0. 2 m and 0. 15 m bed height that gave the similar ratio...|$|E

The process consists of a fluidized bed operated at elevated pressure in which API particles are precipitated from a Supercritical Anti-Solvent process (SAS). MCC particles were used as an excipient in the fluidized bed and collect the SAS-generated API particles. Naringin was selected as the model API to coat onto MCC. A number of operational parameters of the process were investigated: fluidization velocity, coating pressure, temperature, concentration of drug solution, drug solution flow rate, drug mass, organic solvent, MCC mass and size and CO 2 -to-organic solution ratio. SEM and SPM analyses showed that the MCC particle surfaces were covered with near-spherical nanoparticles with a diameter of approximately 100 â 200 nm, substantially smaller than the as-received API material. XRD showed that naringin changed from crystalline to amorphous during processing. The coated particles resulting from the SAS fluidized bed process have a higher loading of API, gave faster release rates and higher release ratios in comparison with those produced using a conventional <b>fluidized</b> <b>bed</b> <b>coating</b> process.

As the drag force is the dominant interaction between the gas flow and the particle motion in this type of fluidized bed, the effect of drag models on the particle motion is investigated. More specifically, the particle velocity and residence time distributions of particles in different regions calculated from five different drag models are presented. It is found that the Gidaspow and Tang drag models predict both particle cycle and residence times well.

In this context, the effect of varying both the electrostatic and fluidized bed setting on the amount of the powder layer coating the work-piece surface was studied. In particular, exposure time, applied corona voltage, and airflow rate were found to influence the performance of the coating process significantly. Experimental results produced coating thickness trends consistent with theoretic expectations. In particular, effects on the coating process of both electric and aerodynamic forces, which in turn affect the powder particles drawn up to the work-piece surface could largely be predicted by examining experimental data.

Aim: Development of porous pellets followed by evaluation of potential drug loading techniques. Method: Porous microcrystalline pellets were manufactured and evaluated as drug delivery system. Pellets consisting of Avicel PH 101 and NaCl (70 %,w/w) were prepared by extrusion/spheronization. The NaCl fraction was extracted {{with water and}} after drying porous pellets were obtained (33. 2 % porosity). Immersion of the porous pellets in a 15 % and 30 % (w/v) metoprolol tartrate solution, ibuprofen impregnation via supercritical fluids and paracetamol layering via <b>fluidized</b> <b>bed</b> <b>coating</b> were evaluated as drug loading techniques. Results: Raman spectroscopy revealed that immersion of the pellets in a drug solution and supercritical fluid impregnation allowed the drug to penetrate into the porous structure of the pellets.

40|$|Abstract: Particle coating is {{becoming}} increasingly important in fertilizer, pharmaceutical and food industries. The demand for coating granular fertilizers with minerals is increasing. Urea is coated with PhosphoGypsum, neem oil, polymeric suspensions and micronutrients like sulfer, zinc etc. Coating of PhosphoGypsum on urea fertilizer is a important application of coating process. Coating of urea particles is done to increase nitrogen use efficiency of urea. Nitrogen losses due to leaching, surface volatilization, and denitrification can be minimized by controlling the dissolution rate. Coating also helps to impart strength, increase in bulk density and lowering of caking tendency, thus improving the handling properties. The objective of present paper is to present the improvement in properties of urea obtained by <b>fluidized</b> <b>bed</b> <b>coating</b> of urea with Phosphogypsum using wet and dry methods. Emulsion of PhosphoGypsum, Neem (Azadirachta indica L.) oil, LAB (Linear Alkyl Benzene) and water was prepared in concentrations of 5 %, 10 % and 15 %. Coating experiments were carried out with both PhosphoGypsum, Neem Oil, LAB and water (wet coating) and PhosphoGypsum, Neem Oil and LAB (dry coating). PhosphoGypsum coated samples were analyzed for crushing strength, dissolution rate, dustiness factor and phosphogypsum content. Characterization of coated and uncoated urea prills is done to optimize and control the process of coating and also the performance of urea coating process can be checked which is useful for checking feasibility o...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The aim of {{the present}} {{investigation}} is to formulate and evaluate Tizanidine hydrochloride sustained release pellets. Tizanidine hydrochloride is an immadazole Î± 2 -adrenergic agonist used {{in the management of}} increase in muscle tone associated with spasticity. It has short biological half-life of 2 - 2. 5 hrs and is rapidly eliminated from the body. Sustained release dosage form of Tizanidine hydrochloride was developed for reduction in total amount of dose administration, to improve patient compliance, and increase efficiency in the treatment. The pellets were prepared by pan coating and <b>fluidized</b> <b>bed</b> <b>coating</b> technique (Wurster type) using hydroxy propyl methyl cellulose E 5 (HPMC E 5), Ethyl cellulose N- 50, Eudragit L- 100 as polymers and Isopropyl alcohol, Methylene dichloride as solvents. The pellets are filled in capsules and evaluated for weight variation, content uniformity, moisture content, lock length, disintegration and in-vitro dissolution tests and the results were found to be within the limits. A comparative study of dissolution profile of different batches with marketed product was performed. The optimized batch showed good similarity with the marketed product (Zanaflex Capsules). The dissolution data was fitted with various kinetic models, and the optimized formulation followed zero order kinetics by non-Fickian case-II diffusion process. Stability studies were conducted for 3 months according to ICH guidelines and found to have good results. INTRODUCTION: Ora...|$|E
40|$|Microencapsulation is {{a process}} of entrapment, {{packaging}} or immobilizing an active (core) material, which can be in the state of solid, liquid or gas, within a more stable, protective secondary (wall) material that can be released at controlled rates under specific conditions. There are several microencapsulation techniques such as: spray drying, spray cooling/chilling, freeze drying, extrusion, <b>fluidized</b> <b>bed</b> <b>coating,</b> coacervation, liposome entrapment, coextrusion, interfacial polymerization, radical polymerization, molecular inclusion in cyclodextrins, etc. Spray drying has been commonly applied due to their simplicity process, wide availability of equipment facilities, significant merits in terms of reductions in product volume, easy of handling, etc. In the spray drying process the wall materials (shells) and their properties are parameters to be considered to achieve proper encapsulation of the active ingredients (core materials). Some commonly used wall materials and their properties related to spray drying encapsulation, including proteins, carbohydrates, and other materials, or mixtures of some of them. Proper encapsulation of the active ingredient (core) is essential to achieve this active material protecting the outer. The aim of this work is encapsulated an essential oil, sage oil, using two differet wall materials in order to determine which is the best wall material. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) has been used in order to know the microcapsules morphology. Core, Shell, Gum Arabic, Alginate, Sage oil, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM...|$|E

In this type of gasifier feedstock of particle size less than 5 Â mm is suspended in the oxygen rich gas. The rising gas reacts with the feedstock and maintained the fluidized state of the coal particles. A uniform temperature distribution is obtained {{in this type of}} gasifiers. <b>Fluidized</b> <b>bed</b> gasifiers avoid clinker formation and defluidization of the bed because they are operated in the temperature range of 800 â 1050 Â Â°C which is well below the ash fusion temperature. Ash discharge conditions may differ in <b>fluidized</b> <b>bed</b> gasifiers, either dry or agglomerated ash. Dry ash <b>fluidized</b> <b>bed</b> gasifier has traditionally operated on low rank of coal; whereas agglomerated ash <b>fluidized</b> <b>bed</b> gasifiers are suitable for any rank of coal.|$|R
