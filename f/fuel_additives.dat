25|$|Waltrip {{took his}} Bill Davis {{points to his}} own then-new Toyota Camry team for the 2007 season with sponsor NAPA Auto Parts in the Nextel Cup Series. It was a dismal first year for the No. 55 Toyota Camry in NASCAR top series competition, as Waltrip's team faced stiff {{penalties}} for using illegal <b>fuel</b> <b>additives</b> during qualifying for the Daytona 500. The team rebounded to qualify 15th via the Gatorade Duels, but finished 30th, leaving Daytona with negative driver and owner points (the team's finish in the Daytona 500 earned them 73 points, but the 100 point penalty they received from NASCAR left them last in the standings at −27 points). Waltrip proceeded to fail to qualify for 11 consecutive races before qualifying for his second race at Dover International Speedway on June 2. Making just his third {{start of the season}} at Michigan International Speedway on June 18, Waltrip posted the team's first top-10 finish and Toyota's third by finishing 10th and leading a lap. In order {{to take advantage of the}} champions provisional, Terry Labonte drove the No. 55 in 2007 at Infineon, Indianapolis, and Watkins Glen. Waltrip gave Toyota its second pole in Cup competition at Talladega on October 7 and grabbed another top-10 finish at Lowe's the following week, bringing his team barely inside the top 43 in points by the end of the season.|$|E

2500|$|Isopropyl {{alcohol is}} a major {{ingredient}} in [...] "gas dryer" [...] <b>fuel</b> <b>additives.</b> In significant quantities water {{is a problem in}} fuel tanks as it separates from the gasoline and can freeze in the supply lines at cold temperatures. Alcohol does not remove water from gasoline; rather, the alcohol solubilizes water in gasoline. Once soluble, water does not pose the same risk as insoluble water, as it will no longer accumulate in the supply lines and freeze, but will be consumed along with the fuel itself. Isopropyl alcohol is often sold in aerosol cans as a windshield or door lock de-icer. Isopropyl alcohol is also used to remove brake fluid traces from hydraulic braking systems, so that the brake fluid (usually DOT 3, DOT 4, or mineral oil) does not contaminate the brake pads, which would result in poor braking.|$|E

While salpn forms stable chelate complexes with many metals including copper, iron, chromium, and nickel, it is the coordination with copper that makes it a popular choice as a <b>fuel</b> <b>additive.</b> Copper has the highest catalytic activity in fuel, and salpn forms a highly stable square-planar complex with the metal. This complex is especially stable because salpn is a tetra-dentate ligand with a -2 charge (after deprotonation of the two phenolic groups).|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{experimental results}} {{carried out to}} evaluate the brake power, specific fuel consumption (SFC) and exhaust gas emissions when running on an unmodified diesel engine with <b>fuel</b> <b>additive</b> blended biodiesel. The multi-functional <b>fuel</b> <b>additive</b> was added (in mass basis) with B 20 (20 biodiesel and 80 ordinary diesel fuel) in a special manner to increase engine brake power. For comparisons three fuels were tested in this investigation which are (1) B 20 X where X is the percentage of <b>fuel</b> <b>additive,</b> (2) B 20 and (3) BO (0 biodiesel and 100 ordinary diesel fuel). The stationary engine test bed used consists of a multi-cylinder diesel engine, eddy current dynamometer with computer control data acquisition system and exhaust emissions analyzer. The exhaust emissions such as CO, HC, and NOx were measured using exhaust gas analyzer. It is found that B 20 X produces higher performance (brake power) with reduction in exhaust emissions and fuel consumption as compared to B 20 and BO fuels. Fuel "B 20 X" could be a 'breakthrough' and the real solution as an alternative fuel for existing unmodified diesel engine. Detail results including B 20 X fuel's physicochemical properties are presented with discussions...|$|R
