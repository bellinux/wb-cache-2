40|$|This paper {{describes}} a thorough thermal study on {{a fleet of}} DC traction motors which were found to suffer from overheating after 3 years of full operation. Overheating of these traction motors is attributed {{partly because of the}} higher than expected number of starts and stops between train terminals. Another probable cause of overheating is the design of the traction motor and/or its control strategy. According to the motor manufacturer, a current shunt is permanently connected across the motor field winding. Hence, some of the armature current is bypassed into the current shunt. The motor then runs above its rated speed in the field weakening mode. In this study, a finite difference model has been developed to simulate the temperature profile at different parts inside the traction motor. In order to validate the simulation result, an empty vehicle loaded with drums of water was also used to simulate the full pay-load of a light rail vehicle experimentally. The authors report that the simulation results agree reasonably well with experimental data, and {{it is likely that the}} armature of the traction motor will run cooler if its <b>field</b> <b>shunt</b> is disconnected at low speed...|$|R
50|$|On {{the first}} step of the arm, full line voltage is applied across the <b>shunt</b> <b>field.</b> Since the field {{rheostat}} is normally set to minimum resistance, the speed of the motor will not be excessive; additionally, the motor will develop a large starting torque.|$|R
50|$|There {{will be a}} small {{armature}} {{voltage drop}} on load, which will {{be reflected in the}} voltage applied to the <b>shunt</b> <b>field.</b> The output voltage in a dc shunt-wound generator drops slightly as load current increases because of the voltage drop across the armature resistance.|$|R
50|$|The {{sets were}} {{designed}} to operate with the high platforms, sharp curves, and narrow clearances of the Chicago Loop and the Chicago 'L', to run at speeds of 80 mph or more on the North Shore's main line, and to use city streets to the downtown Milwaukee Terminal. The sets' styling resembled that of the Pioneer Zephyr and influenced the styling of other electric trainsets, notably the Odakyū 3000 series SE Romance Cars. The articulated truck/bogie design allowed very smooth running {{with none of the}} horizontal movement characteristic of non-articulated equipment. Although they were streamlined, the sets were not permitted to run faster than conventional North Shore equipment. From the front passenger seat adjacent to the motorman's half cab, if the door was propped open, a passenger could see the speedometer pegged at 90 mph on the long stretch between Dempster Street and North Chicago Junction. When the sets were received in 1941, during one test run the traction motors were allowed full <b>field</b> <b>shunt</b> to determine absolute maximum speed. It reached just over 110 mph, but at that speed the train reached highway crossings before the crossing gates fully closed, a dangerous situation. Thereafter, the sets were limited to 90 mph.|$|R

40|$|The M-H {{loops of}} MgB 2 {{materials}} in bulk sintered form, {{as well as}} for PIT wire and tape MgB 2 /Fe monofilamentary composites, have been measured at various temperatures. The influence of Fe on the M-H loops of the tape and wire are discussed. The normal Fe response is subtracted with the use of M-H loops taken above Tc and the remaining magnetization suppression of the MgB 2 is described in terms of <b>field</b> <b>shunting</b> in the Fe 2 ̆ 2 shield 2 ̆ 2. The level of Fe shielding, both of regions outside of the sample from the MgB 2, as well as the MgB 2 from the outside is discussed, the latter is quantified in terms of a M. Using finite element analysis, M is calculated locally for the tape in both FO and EO field orientations (with the field perpendicular to and along the wide side of the tape, respectively) {{as well as for}} the wire sample. It is seen that this ^B effect can be phenomenologically modelled as a pseudo-Meissner effect. Direct measurements of hysteretic loss vs applied field sweep amplitude, Hm, give a pseudo-Meissner field, HPS 1, of 2 kOe for the round wire sample in reasonable agreement with calculation. The hysteretic loss above HpSl (and below the penetration field) was found to fit well to an expression proportional to (H-HPS 1) 3. By comparing calculations with and without HpSl it was seen that the Fe sheath significantly reduced the hysteretic loss in externally applied fields for these MgB 2 /Fe composites...|$|R

50|$|The {{speed of}} a DC motor can be {{increased}} by field weakening. Reducing the field strength is done by inserting resistance in series with a <b>shunt</b> <b>field,</b> or inserting resistances around a series-connected field winding, to reduce current in the field winding.

40|$|Graduation date: 1971 This thesis {{develops}} a simulation {{model for a}} cumulative connected compound direct-current generator to varify the operation of this machine under conditions of slowly and rapidly changing loads. The application of this simulation method will contribute to more exact modeling of power system components. The accuracy gained is {{in the area of}} magnitude and time of response of the d-c generator and other systems with which it is a component for simulation. The simulation uses a table look-up method for the representation of the series field and the armature winding. The first inductance is called subtransient and it represented the effective inductance over a specified length of time called the time of influence. " The second inductance is used after the time of influence has elapsed, and is called the transient inductance. The <b>shunt</b> <b>field</b> representation is in terms of a subtransient inductance, transient inductance and a time of influence of the subtransient inductance.

Parallel mode reconnected the motors in parallel across the supply, and allowed operation up to normal full speed.

40|$|In this work, {{we propose}} and test a {{strategy}} for tunable, broadband wave attenuation in electromechanical waveguides with shunted piezoelectric inclusions. Our strategy is built upon the vast pre-existing literature on vibration attenuation and bandgap generation in structures featuring periodic arrays of piezo patches, but distinguishes itself for several key features. First, we demystify the idea that periodicity is a requirement for wave attenuation and bandgap formation. We further embrace the idea of "organized disorder" by tuning the circuits as to resonate at distinct neighboring frequencies. In doing so, we create a tunable "rainbow trap" [Tsakmakidis et al. Nature 450, 397 - 401 (2007) ] capable of attenuating waves with broadband characteristics, by "distilling" (sequentially) seven frequencies from a traveling wavepacket.
