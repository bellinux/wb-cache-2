5|$|A temulent bee is {{more likely}} to stick out its tongue, or proboscis. Inebriated bees spend more time flying. If a bee is {{sufficiently}} intoxicated, it will just lie on its back and wiggle its legs. Inebriated bees typically <b>have</b> <b>many</b> <b>more</b> flying accidents as well. Some bees that consume ethanol become too inebriated to find their way back to the hive, and will die as a result. Bozic et al. (2006) found that alcohol consumption by honeybees disrupts foraging and social behaviors, and has some similar effects to poisoning with insecticides. Some bees become more aggressive after consuming alcohol.|$|E
5|$|Nemertea use organs called protonephridia to excrete soluble waste products, {{especially}} nitrogenous by-products {{of cellular}} metabolism. In nemertean protonephridia, flame cells which filter out the wastes {{are embedded in}} the front part of the two lateral fluid vessels. The flame cells remove the wastes into two collecting ducts, one on either side, and each duct has one or more nephridiopores through which the wastes exit. Semiterrestrial and freshwater nemerteans <b>have</b> <b>many</b> <b>more</b> flame cells than marines, sometimes thousands. The {{reason may be that}} osmoregulation is more difficult in non-marine environments.|$|E
5|$|Until {{the recent}} past, little {{attention}} {{was paid to}} the interests of Third World countries. This is because most international relations scholars have come from the industrialized, First World nations. As more countries have continued to become more developed, the interests of the world have slowly started to shift. However, First World nations still <b>have</b> <b>many</b> <b>more</b> universities, professors, journals, and conferences, which has made it very difficult for Third World countries to gain legitimacy and respect with their new ideas and methods of looking at the world.|$|E

5|$|The Japanese Army and Navy {{had their}} own {{independent}} atomic-bomb programs and therefore the Japanese understood enough to know how very difficult building it would be. Therefore, many Japanese {{and in particular the}} military members of the government refused to believe the United States had built an atomic bomb, and the Japanese military ordered their own independent tests to determine the cause of Hiroshima's destruction. Admiral Soemu Toyoda, the Chief of the Naval General Staff, argued that even if the United States had made one, they could not <b>have</b> <b>many</b> <b>more.</b> American strategists, having anticipated a reaction like Toyoda's, planned to drop a second bomb shortly after the first, to convince the Japanese that the U.S. had a large supply.|$|E
5|$|Those {{countries}} have millions of native speakers of dialect continua ranging from an English-based creole {{to a more}} standard version of English. They <b>have</b> <b>many</b> <b>more</b> speakers of English who acquire English {{in the process of}} growing up through day by day use and listening to broadcasting, especially if they attend schools where English is the medium of instruction. Varieties of English learned by speakers who are not native speakers born to English-speaking parents may be influenced, especially in their grammar, by the other languages spoken by those learners. Most of those varieties of English include words little used by native speakers of English in the inner-circle countries, and they may have grammatical and phonological differences from inner-circle varieties as well. The standard English of the inner-circle countries is often taken as a norm for use of English in the outer-circle countries.|$|E

25|$|The Fang group lives {{close to}} the province's {{southern}} borders. The Fang proper are inland {{on the border with}} Equatorial Guinea and near Djoum. The Ntumu inhabit the area around Ambam, also on the southern border. The Mvang (or Mvae) occupy the regions directly east and west of the Ntumu.

25|$|A {{long-term}} {{experiment in}} a county in Shanxi Province, in which the family planning law was suspended, suggested that families would not <b>have</b> <b>many</b> <b>more</b> children even if the law were abolished. A 2003 review of the policy-making process behind {{the adoption of the}} one-child policy shows that less intrusive options, including those that emphasized delay and spacing of births, were known but not fully considered by China's political leaders.|$|E

25|$|Also in 1972 Peter Mazur, a {{biologist}} at ORNL, froze with liquid nitrogen, thawed and implanted mouse embryos in a surrogate mother. The mouse pups were born healthy. The technique is popular in the livestock industry as it allows the embryos of valuable cattle to be transported easily and a prize cow can have multiple eggs extracted and thus through in vitro fertilisation <b>have</b> <b>many</b> <b>more</b> offspring than would naturally be possible.|$|E
25|$|When clonally aged P. tetraurelia are stimulated {{to undergo}} meiosis in {{association}} with either autogamy or conjugation, the progeny are rejuvenated, {{and are able to}} <b>have</b> <b>many</b> <b>more</b> mitotic binary fission divisions. During either of these processes the micronuclei of the cell(s) undergo meiosis, the old macronucleus disintegrates and a new macronucleus is formed by replication of the micronuclear DNA that had recently undergone meiosis. There is apparently little, if any, DNA damage in the new macronucleus, suggesting that rejuvenation is associated with the repair of these damages in the micronucleus during meiosis.|$|E
25|$|As of Update 19 in late 2016, Premium {{housing is}} now available, based {{in a new}} housing area in the Cape of Belfalas in Gondor.

25|$|A few of {{the rivers}} in Punjab have {{dangerous}} species of crocodiles. The extraction of silk from silkworms is another industry that flourishes in the state. Production of bee honey is done {{in some parts of}} Punjab. The southern plains are desert land; hence, camels can be seen. Buffaloes graze around the banks of rivers. The northeastern part is home to animals like horses. Wildlife sanctuaries <b>have</b> <b>many</b> <b>more</b> species of wild animals like the otter, wild boar, wildcat, fruit bat, hog deer, flying fox, squirrel and mongoose. Naturally formed forests {{can be seen in the}} Shivalik ranges in the districts of Ropar, Gurdaspur and Hoshiarpur. Patiala is home to the Bir forest while the wetlands area in Punjab is home to the famous Mand forest.|$|E
25|$|The Otomi paper makers {{generally}} {{sell their}} production {{to a limited}} number of wholesalers, because of limited Spanish skills and contact with the outside. This means about ten wholesalers controlling the distribution of about half of all Otomi production. These wholesalers, as well as artisans such as the Nahua who use the paper as the basis of their own work, <b>have</b> <b>many</b> <b>more</b> contacts and as a result, retail sales of the product are wide ranging and varied both within Mexico and abroad. Amate paper products are still sold on the streets and markets in Mexico, much as commercialization of the produce began in the 20th century, often in venues that cater to tourists. However, through wholesalers, the paper also ends up in handicraft stores, open bazaars, specialty shops and the Internet. Much of it is used to create paintings, and the finest of these have been exhibited in both national and international museums and galleries. The paper is sold retail in the town to tourists as well as in shops in cities such as Oaxaca, Tijuana, Mexico City, Guadalajara, Monterrey and Puebla. It is also exported to the United States, especially to Miami.|$|E
25|$|Both men {{and women}} have the option of {{investing}} resources either to provision children or to have additional offspring based on life history theory. Males and females monitor costs and benefits of each alternative to maximize reproductive fitness; however, trade-off differences do exist between sexes. Females are likely to benefit most from parental effort because they are certain which offspring are theirs and have relatively few reproductive opportunities, each of which is relatively costly and risky. In contrast, males do not have an absolute certainty of paternity, but may <b>have</b> <b>many</b> <b>more</b> mating opportunities bearing relatively low costs and risks. Though not every hunter-gatherer population pinpoints females to gathering and males to hunting (most notably the Aeta and Ju'/hoansi), the norm of most current populations divide the roles of labor in this manner. Natural selection is more likely to favor male reproductive strategies that stress mating effort and female strategies that emphasize parental investment. As a result, women do the low-risk task of gathering vegetation and underground storage organs that are rich in energy to provide for themselves and offspring. Since women provide a reliable source of caloric intake, men are able to afford a higher risk of failure by hunting animals.|$|E
