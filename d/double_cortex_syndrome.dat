To assess the effect of loading mode on bone remodeling, a well-established remodeling algorithm was used to examine the effect of axial force or bending moment on bone structure.

40|$|SummaryBackgroundMicrotubule ends have {{distinct}} biochemical {{and structural}} features {{from those of the}} lattice. Several proteins that control microtubule behavior can distinguish the end of a microtubule from the lattice. The end-binding protein EB 1, for example, recognizes the nucleotide state of microtubule ends, which are enriched in GTP-tubulin. EB 1 shares its binding site with Doublecortin (DCX), a protein expressed in developing neurons. We showed recently that DCX binds with highest affinity to microtubule ends. ResultsHere we show that DCX recognizes microtubule ends by a novel mechanism based on lattice curvature. Using single-molecule microscopy, we show that DCX “comets” do not elongate at faster microtubule growth rates and DCX does not recognize two out of three GTP analogs. We demonstrate that DCX binds with higher affinity to curved microtubule lattices than to straight ones. We find that curvature recognition is a property of single DCX molecules. Straightening of protofilaments (pfs) at microtubule ends with paclitaxel significantly attenuates end-recognition by DCX, but not EB 1. Mutations in DCX found in patients with <b>double</b> <b>cortex</b> <b>syndrome</b> disrupted curvature recognition. ConclusionsWe propose a model in which DCX recognizes microtubule ends through specific interactions with their structure. We conclude that microtubule ends have two distinct features that proteins can recognize independently, namely a structural feature related to curvature and nucleotide state...|$|E
40|$|Subcortical band heterotopia (SBH) or <b>double</b> <b>cortex</b> <b>syndrome</b> is a {{neuronal}} migration disorder, {{which occurs}} very rarely in males: to date, at least 110 females but only 11 in males have been reported. The syndrome is {{usually associated with}} mutations in the doublecortin (DCX) (Xq 22. 3 -q 23) gene, and much less frequently in the LIS 1 (17 p 13. 3) gene. To determine whether the phenotypic spectrum, the genetic basis and genotype-phenotype correlations of SBH in males {{are similar to those}} in females, we compared the clinical, imaging and molecular features in 30 personally evaluated males and 60 previously reported females with SBH. Based on the MRI findings, we defined the following band subtypes: partial, involving one or two cerebral lobes; intermediate, involving two lobes and a portion of a third; diffuse, with substantial involvement of three or more lobes; and pachygyria-SBH, in which posterior SBH merges with anterior pachygyria. Karyo typing and mutation analysis of DCX and/or LIS 1 were performed in 23 and 24 patients, respectively. The range of clinical phenotypes in males with SBH greatly overlapped that in females. MRI studies revealed that some anatomical subtypes of SBH, such as partial and intermediate posterior, pachygyria-SBH and diffuse bands with posterior predominance, were more frequently or exclusively present in males. Conversely, classical diffuse SBH and diffuse bands with anterior predominance were more frequent in females. Males had either mild or the most severe band subtypes, and these correlated with the over-representation of normal/borderline intelligence and severe mental retardation, respectively. Conversely, females who had predominantly diffuse bands exhibited mostly mild or moderate mental retardation. Seven patients (29 %) had missense mutations in DCX; in four, these were germline mutations, whereas in three there was evidence for somatic mosaicism. A germline missense mutation of LIS 1 and a partial trisomy of chromosome 9 p were identified in one patient (4 %) each. One male each had a possible pathogenic intronic base change in both DCX and LIS 1 genes. Our study shows that SBH in males is a clinically heterogeneous syndrome, mostly occurring sporadically. The clinical spectrum {{is similar to that of}} females with SBH. However, the greater cognitive and neuroradiological heterogeneity and the small number of mutations identified to date in the coding sequences of the DCX and LIS 1 genes in males differ from the findings in females.

In most of these studies the implants integration also depends on the animal daily activity and musculoskeletal loads, which affect the implants mechanical environment. However, the tissue adaption to the physiological loads is often filtered through control groups or not inspected. This work aims to investigate experimentally and numerically the effects of the daily activity on the integration of implants inserted in the rat tibia, and to establish a physiological loading condition to analyse the peri-implant bone stresses during gait. Two titanium implants, single and <b>double</b> <b>cortex</b> crossing, are inserted in the rat tibia.

40|$|Subcortical band heterotopia (SBH) or <b>double</b> <b>cortex</b> is {{associated}} with significant impairments in neocortical function including men-tal retardation and epilepsy. Mutant alleles of DCX in humans typi-cally cause SBH in females and lissencephaly in males, whereas Dcx null mutations in mice neither disrupt neocortical neuronal migration nor cause SBH formation. In utero RNA interference (RNAi) of Dcx in rats, in contrast, creates an animal model of SBH. Possible explanations for the discrepancies in results following loss of Dcx function include species differences and/or differences between RNAi knockdown and genetic deletion. We have carried {{out a series of}} in utero RNAi experiments to investigate possible species differences between rat and mouse to determine the mole-cular specificity of RNAi against Dcx and to identify the cellular constituents of SBH in the rat model. In utero RNAi in the rat consistently leads to both the formation of SBH and laminar dis-placement of transfected cells in normotopic cortex, whereas the same treatment in mouse fails to induce SBH but does create laminar displacement. Induction of SBH and impaired radial mig-ration following RNAi against Dcx is rescued by overexpression of Dcx. Thus, both disruptions induced by RNAi are specific to in-terference of Dcx. SBHs contain transfected pyramidal cells as well as nontransfected cell types, including neocortical interneurons and glia.

40|$|The {{extracellular}} matrix molecule reelin {{is a crucial}} molecule in CNS development, in particular in the cerebellum and cerebral cortex. In the cerebral cortex, reelin is provided by {{a small number of}} neurons located in the marginal zone (MZ). These neurons belong to the earliest neurons generated, but {{little is known about the}} molecular mechanisms of their specification. Here we describe that reelin-positive cells are strongly increased in the developing cortex of the Pax 6 mutant mice Small eye. Shortly after the onset of reelin expression, the number of reelin- and calretinin-positive cells is <b>doubled</b> in the <b>cortex</b> of Pax 6 mutants and this increase is further enhanced during development. In contrast, calbindin-positive cells in the MZ do not co-express reelin and are not altered in the Pax 6 mutant cortex. The split of the preplate cells was also defective in the Pax 6 mutant cortex, suggesting that the amount of reelin is crucial for positioning of the cortical plate between the MZ and subplate. We further show that Pax 6 mutant cortical cells isolated in vitro do not develop an increase in reelin-positive cells, while cells isolated from the entire telencephalon do. Consistent with non-cell-autonomous mechanisms contributing to the increase in reelin-positive cells in the Pax 6 -deficient cortex, tangential migration of diverse cell types from the ventral telencephalon into the cortex is enhanced in the Pax 6 mutant mice. Taken together, these experiments further elucidate how patterning of the forebrain by the transcription factor Pax 6 regulates the specification of distinct neuronal subtypes in the cortical MZ...|$|R
40|$|Phosphorylation of the histone H 2 AX (γH 2 AX form) is {{an early}} {{response}} to DNA damage and a marker of aging and disease in several cells and tissues outside the nervous system. Little is known about in vivo phosphorylation of H 2 AX in neurons, although {{it was suggested that}} γH 2 AX {{is an early}} marker of neuronal endangerment thus opening the possibility to target it as a neuroprotective strategy. After experimental labeling of DNA-synthesizing cells with 5 -bromo- 2 -deoxyuridine (BrdU), we studied the brain occurrence of γH 2 AX in developing, postnatal, adult and senescent (2 years) mice by light and electron microscopic immunocytochemistry and Western blotting. Focal and/or diffuse γH 2 AX immunostaining appears in interkinetic nuclei, mitotic chromosomes, and apoptotic nuclei. Immunoreactivity is mainly associated with neurogenetic areas, i. e., the subventricular zone (SVZ) of telencephalon, the cerebellar cortex, and, albeit to a much lesser extent, the subgranular zone of the hippocampal dentate gyrus. In addition, γH 2 AX is highly expressed in the adult and senescent cerebral cortex, particularly the piriform <b>cortex.</b> <b>Double</b> labeling experiments demonstrate that γH 2 AX in neurogenetic brain areas is temporally and functionally related to proliferation and apoptosis of neuronal precursors, i. e., the type C transit amplifying cells (SVZ) and the granule cell precursors (cerebellum). Conversely, γH 2 AX-immunoreactive cortical neurons incorporating the S phase-label BrdU do not express the proliferation marker phosphorylated histone H 3, indicating that these postmitotic cells undergo a significant DNA damage response. Our study paves the way for a better comprehension of the role of H 2 AX phosphorylation in the normal brain, and offers additional data to design novel strategies for the protection of neuronal precursors and mature neurons in central nervous system (CNS) degenerative diseases...|$|R
40|$|Epidemiological {{evidence}} suggests that adolescents and adults perinatally exposed to alcohol, even at low doses, show high prevalence of cognitive impairment and social behavior deficits, which may be in part related to alcohol-induced changes of the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) ergic neurotransmission. The endogenous neurosteroid 3 alpha-hydroxy, 5 alpha-pregnan- 20 -one (3 alpha, 5 alpha-tetrahydroprogesterone/ 3 alpha, 5 alpha-THP), a potent positive allosteric modulator of GABA(A) receptor function, is implicated in the physiological tuning of GABA-mediated fast inhibition and in various alcohol's actions in the brain. This study was undertaken to determine whether perinatal exposure to low millimolar blood alcohol concentrations alters cognitive skills (social discrimination and inhibitory avoidance tests), emotional reactivity (elevated plus maze test), and neurosteroid content in brain cortex and hippocampus of adult male offspring. Dams had access to a 3 % alcohol solution or to an equicaloric sucrose solution from gestational day 15 to postnatal day 9. Eighty-day old alcohol-exposed male offspring exhibited impaired social recognition memory, but unchanged inhibitory avoidance performance and normal behavior on the elevated-plus maze. The concentrations of 3 alpha, 5 alpha-THP and its precursor progesterone were more than <b>doubled</b> in brain <b>cortex</b> and hippocampus of alcohol-exposed rats, whereas in plasma only progesterone was increased. Thus, exposure to low millimolar blood alcohol concentrations has a long-lasting impact on the developing brain as it causes an impairment of social recognition {{as well as an}} increase of brain neurosteroid content in mature animals. The latter may be consequent to altered expression/activity of brain steroidogenic enzymes, as reflected by the enduring increase of the GABA(A) receptor-active neurosteroid 3 alpha, 5 alpha-THP in brain cortex and hippocampus, but not in plasma. It is speculated that, by inducing a greater amplification of GABA(A) receptor function, the elevation of 3 alpha, 5 alpha-THP brain content contributes to the cognitive impairment exhibited by adult alcohol-exposed offspring...|$|R
