40|$|Purpose. In modern {{construction}} the placing {{of concrete}} is often performed using distribution equipment of concrete pumps. Increase of productivity {{and quality of}} this construction work requires improvement of both concrete pumps and their tooling. The concrete pumps tooling consists of standardized concrete conveying pipes and connector bends radius of up to 2 m. A promising direction of tooling improvement is the reduce of resistance to movement of the concrete in the concrete conveying pipe by increasing the radius of the bend. The {{aim of this study}} is to determine the feasibility of developing and implementing connector bends with radius greater than 2 m. Methodology. The criterion of efficiency in using bends with radius of more than 2 m in connector concrete pipes is reduction of resistance to movement of the concrete, enhancing the productivity of concrete pumps. Studies of resistance to movement of concrete in the concrete conveying pipe are performed on the mathematical simulations. Findings. On the proposed models are calculated the resistance to movement of concrete in the concrete conveying pipe of the autoconcrete pump with a three-section <b>distribution</b> <b>boom.</b> Reduction of the resistance to concrete movement was obtained for the four major sections of the provisions of the <b>distribution</b> <b>boom</b> in the autoconcrete pump. Originality. Two mathematical simulations were developed to calculate the resistivity to concrete movement in the bends of concrete conveying pipe depending on the radius of the bend. Practical value. The proposed by the author simulations allow us to calculate resistivity to the concrete movement in the concrete conveying pipe and general resistance to the concrete movement in the concrete pipe of the autoconcrete pump with three sections of the <b>distribution</b> <b>boom.</b> The study found a decrease of 10. 3 − 75. 5 % of the resistance to concrete movement in the concrete conveying pipe with connector bends of an increased radius.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work {{was to develop a}} method with which to measure the spray {{distribution}} from a single-nozzle while it is under the influence of other nozzles on a sprayer <b>boom.</b> The nozzle <b>distribution</b> pattern for one nozzle on a seven-nozzle boom was evaluated, using 0. 05 M KCl (potassium chloride) solution as marker. Conductivity measurements were made to detect the amount of marked liquid in the <b>distribution</b> along the <b>boom.</b> The spray <b>distribution</b> from the <b>boom</b> was measured on a patternator, with 50 mm channel spacing, and the liquid was collected in 60 graduated cylinders (250 ml). A computer program and an electronic apparatus made it possible to measure the flow rate in each cylinder automatically. To measure the <b>distribution</b> under the <b>boom,</b> the conductivity of the liquid in each cylinder was measured, by taking 100 ml of the liquid to a conductivity cell. Since conductivity is dependent on the temperature of the solution, the temperature of the liquid was measured. Once the actual temperature of the solution was known, it was possible to calculate the corresponding conductivity value at 10 °C. As the conductivity of the marker solution was known, it was possible to determine the proportion of marker solution in each cylinder with the ratio conductivity(solution) / conductivity(marker). Multiplying this value by the flow rate for each cylinder makes it possible to calculate the flow rate in every cylinder, which ought to give the distribution pattern for the measured nozzle. The method was checked by adding the individual nozzle distributions, measured with the conductivity method theoretically in a spreadsheet program, to a theoretical <b>distribution</b> below a <b>boom.</b> The theoretical <b>boom</b> <b>distribution</b> was compared with the distribution measured under the boom. Measurements were made with flat fan nozzles of various sizes, for different twist angles and pressures. If the method worked, a modelled distribution ought to agree with a measured one, irrespective of these settings. The results from the conductivity method were compared with the corresponding single- nozzle distribution patterns measured free from the influence of other nozzles. The results showed that the conductivity method worked well irrespective of the parameter settings. Thus the <b>boom</b> <b>distributions</b> modelled on patterns measured with the conductivity method were very similar to the actual distributions measured under the boom. The investigation also showed that this model which simulates a <b>boom</b> <b>distribution</b> based on single-nozzle distribution patterns, measured without the influence of other nozzles were also very similar to the one measured except in the case of small nozzles (Teejet 11001 SS XR). The conductivity method makes it possible to study the interaction phenomenon on a single distribution pattern. The conductivity method worked well and could be used instead of the conventional method (without influence of other nozzles), when single-nozzle distribution patterns were measured. The distributions measured with the conductivity method are more realistic than the one measured with the conventional method, as the conductivity method includes the interaction information. It could also be used as a tool when investigating the interaction phenomenon, and ascertaining what effect different parameters have on the phenomenon. Use of single-nozzle distribution patterns measured with the conductivity method makes it possible to model a <b>boom</b> <b>distribution</b> as realistically as possible, which could be useful when setting up a boom model with which to calculate the spray distribution on the ground while the vehicle is driving...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} multiobjective {{portfolio}} selection problem with most probable random distribution derived from current market data and other random <b>distributions</b> of <b>boom</b> and recession under the risk-controlled parameters determined by an investor. The current market {{data and information}} include not only historical data but also interpretations of economists’ oral and linguistic information, and hence, the boom and recession are often caused by these nonnumeric data. Therefore, investors need to consider several situations from most probable condition to boom and recession and to avoid the risk less than the target return in each situation. Furthermore, it is generally difficult to set random distributions of these cases exactly. Therefore, a robust-based approach for portfolio selection problems using the only mean values and variances of securities is proposed as a multiobjective programming problem. In addition, an exact algorithm is developed to obtain an explicit optimal portfolio using a principle of compromise...|$|R

40|$|There are {{a number}} of reasons for {{incorrect}} spray <b>distributions</b> but horizontal <b>boom</b> vibrations, effected by soil unevenness, are a major cause of irregular spray patterns. A modal model of a flexible sprayer boom was developed, based on experimental measurements and modal analysis techniques to investigate horizontal boom vibrations and the related spray pattern. Field input forces were simulated with a tractor and mounted sprayer driven over a standardized bumpy road. The modal model and the input force were combined in a forced response technique to simulate the boom movement by which the spray deposit distribution was computed. A comparison of the spray patterns with different tire pressures and driving speeds gave an optimal range of use for the tested sprayer, tractor and tires. This method allows rapid testing of new sprayer designs. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Sonic boom {{bow shock}} {{amplitude}} and rise time statistics {{from a recent}} sonic boom propagation experiment are presented. Distributions of bow shock overpressure and rise time measured under different atmospheric turbulence conditions for the same test aircraft are quite different. The peak overpressure distributions are skewed positively, indicating a tendency for positive deviations from the mean to be larger than negative deviations. Standard deviations of overpressure distributions measured under moderate turbulence were 40 percent larger than those measured under low turbulence. As turbulence increased, {{the difference between the}} median and the mean increased, indicating increased positive overpressure deviations. The effect of turbulence was more readily seen in the rise time distributions. Under moderate turbulence conditions, the rise time distribution means were larger by a factor of 4 and the standard deviations were larger by a factor of 3 from the low turbulence values. These distribution changes resulted in a transition from a peaked appearance of the rise time distribution for the morning to a flattened appearance for the afternoon rise time <b>distributions.</b> The sonic <b>boom</b> propagation experiment consisted of flying three types of aircraft supersonically over a ground-based microphone array with concurrent measurements of turbulence and other meteorological data.

The effect {{is included in the}} Eulerian-Lagrangian solver so that it capable of simulating heavy particles in environmental air flows. Flow distributions of heavy particles such as liquid aerosol, sand or granular fertilizer are greatly affected by gravitational effect as compared to relatively buoyant particles such as smoke and light dust. Transient particle distribution in a ventilated room is simulated in this work. 10, 000 particles that represent homogenous 2 mm Hemlock wood dust were randomly distributed in 3. 3 x 2. 8 x 5. 9 m 3 ventilated room that consist of two ceiling air intake and four bottom wall ventilation outlets. Homogeneous Hemlock wood solid sphere particles with diameter of 2 mm is simulated while the air intake is equivalent to 0. 0944 m 3 /s.

Simulation with particle gravitational effect shows otherwise where 92 % of the particles settled at the bottom half of the room when measures at the same transient duration.

40|$|Pesticide {{application}} {{is an integral}} part of crop production and ground-based agricultural boom sprayers are used extensively to apply pesticides to the crop canopy or soil surface across millions of acres in the United States. Efficient {{application is}} necessary to minimize costs and limit adverse environmental impacts. Errors in flow rate and system pressure measurements may cause as-applied maps to incorrectly indicate application rates and could negatively affect downstream data processing or analysis. The goals of this study were to provide quantified measurements on the effects of nozzle setup errors on spray pattern uniformity and evaluate how laboratory patternator data would compare to measurements on a full spray boom. More specific objectives were to: 1) determine the effects from factors such as nozzle lateral angle, nozzle spacing, nozzle replacement and nozzle pitch angle on spray pattern distribution, 2) evaluate a simulation approach to predict the effects of single nozzle boom setup errors on full boom system pattern uniformity, and 3) assess full boom operational measurements (e. g., flow, pressure, and spray pattern) to assess sensitivity for predicting <b>boom</b> <b>distribution</b> errors. Laboratory and field-based tests were devised to quantify the impact of nozzle setup and operational errors on spray pattern uniformity, boom pressure, and nozzle flow rates. Results indicated that small variations in boom setup or nozzle operation (i. e., pressure or flow) can cause significant errors in spray nozzle distribution which may not be completely detectable by measuring spray pattern alone. Simulations using laboratory data from setup or operational errors reflected similar changes in spray pattern CV as full boom data with similar setup errors. These findings were significant in that it may be possible to model full <b>boom</b> spray <b>distributions</b> based on smaller laboratory-collected datasets. Finally, full boom system-based pressure and flow measurements were compared with similar values at the boom subsection level. Results indicated that localized issues with nozzles or boom subsections may not be readily detected with system-based measurements. Those relying on system-based readings (e. g., pressure or flow) should expect errors exceeding 10 % compared to localized measurements across the spray boom. Advisor: Joe D. Luc...|$|R
40|$|Fifteen years ago, like today, {{there were}} {{concerns}} that house prices might collapse. One {{big difference between}} then and now, however, {{is the basis for}} those concerns. Today, people are worried that a house price bubble (if one exists) might burst, while 15 years ago, people were worried about demographic effects, specifically, the inevitable aging of the baby boomers. Figure 1 Age distribution of U. S. households The earlier concern was sparked by a paper by Mankiw and Weil (1989), in which the authors famously predicted that between 1987 and 2007, real house prices could fall by 3 % per year. In fact, real house prices grew by an average of 3 1 / 2 % per year from 1987 to 2004. Of course, the Mankiw-Weil prediction may yet come to pass; or it may have already occurred and simply been masked by the surge in demand over the last seven years that is due to other factors. But the relationship between demographics and house prices remains interesting both because housing constitutes such a large component of the typical household’s wealth, and because much remains to be understood about the consequences of the baby boomers liquidating their housing and financial assets. In this Economic Letter,I revisit the economics of the housing market and demographics. A simple model of the housing market Prices and quantities in housing markets are determined by the interaction of the construction sector (the supply side) with households (the demand side). Key variables governing the supply of new housing include prices, the costs of construction materials and land, the cost of financing, and the amount of undepreciated housing stock. Similarly, key variables governing the quantity of housing include prices, the level of mortgage rates, expectations of permanent income or wealth, rates of return on other investments, and demographic factors that influence the decision to buy a house. One demographic factor that is particularly significant is the age <b>distribution.</b> A baby <b>boom,</b> or a temporary increase in the birth rate, shifts the age distribution (Figure 1). This is important because, as Figure 2 shows, homeownership rates vary considerably by age, increasing from an average of les...|$|R

40|$|During {{the summer}} of 1982 the Division of Hydrotechnics at the Swedish University of Agricu 1 tural Sciences bought an {{irrigation}} boom from F:a Deier 1 ing, West Germany. The boom, which is a prototype, is 45 m wide and equipped with 17 def 1 ector nozzles. Each nozzle is fitted with a pressure regulator so that the fall in pressure along the boom does not inf 1 uence the flow from the nozzles. The pressure requirement is low; 0. 4 - 0. 5 MPa (40 - 50 m water column) is sufficient as inlet pressure to an irrigator if a boom is used instead of a spray-gun. The water <b>distribution</b> of the <b>boom</b> was determined during a number of days in August, 1982. The distribution of water was uniform, but not as uniform as given by a good spray-gun under ideal conditions (no wind, correct spacing, correct working pressure). On the other hand, neither the spreading pattern of the boom nor the spacing {{are influenced by the}} wind. During the measurements the wind was so strong {{that it would have been}} impossible to irrigate with a spray-gun. In practice the boom spreads water more evenly than a spray-gun. The boom gives a very high mean intensity (ca 100 mm/h) but a German investigation reports that the water is delivered in the form of relatively small drops (d< 1. 6 mm). This implies that the supply will be gentle in comparison with the recurring downpours of the spray-gun. Thus, boom irrigation should be well suited for sensitive crops and soils with weak structure. When the nozzles on the boom were tested on a number of different soils the results were better than expected; surface water formation was negligible or non-existent and only in one case was puddling considerable. The proportion of very small drops is much lower in water from the nozzles on the boom than in water from a spray-gun. Consequently, as the boom spreads the water close to the soil the risk of aerosol formation will be much less than with a spray-gun. This is important when partially cleaned sewage water is used for irrigation. Measurements were also made of the water distribution pattern for individual nozzles and it was calculated that the optimal nozzle spacing was 3. 0 m, which is in good agreement with the 2. 8 m reported for the boom. The nozzles give double overlapping and droplet trajectories with large angles of impact. Because of this, the spreading pattern of the boom is relatively insensitive to variations in the distance to soil surface/crop. As regards labour considerations, the boom is much more complicated than the spray-gun. On account of its working width usually being smaller, the boom requires more frequent moves. With the design of the prototype, each move will, in addition, take longer to accomplish and includes a couple of heavy tasks, provided that it cannot be moved in extended form. By making a number of simple modifications both time and labour can be saved when moving the boom, but it is probably impossible to completely achieve the same flexibility as of the spray-gun. From the energy viewpoint, the boom is clearly superior to the spray-gun. mainly on account of lower working pressure but often also due to more uniform spreading and thus lower water requirement. The saving in energy may sometimes be sufficient to pay for both the boom and extra labour required by the boom. In most cases, however, other advantages of using the boom for irrigation should be considered in assessing whether there is justification in selecting the boom in favour of the spray-gun...|$|R
