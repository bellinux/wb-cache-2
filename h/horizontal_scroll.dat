50|$|<b>Horizontal</b> <b>scrolling</b> {{requires}} the same Display List implementation {{as the worst}} case example described for Vertical Coarse <b>Scrolling.</b> So, where <b>Horizontal</b> <b>scrolling</b> is implemented, vertical scrolling is also supported just by changing the value incrementing or decrementing the LMS addresses. The other benefit of this arrangement {{is that it is}} easy to manage screen memory around ANTIC's 4K screen memory boundary limit.|$|R

50|$|Chunlian is a couplet, {{typically}} seven characters, on {{two sides}} of the door frame, whose content is related to spring. Lexical and tonal rules are always adhered, though not strictly, as Chunlian is transformed from metrical poems. Sometimes, concurrently, a <b>horizontal</b> <b>scroll</b> with four to five characters is hanged on the crosspiece of the door. Its content is mostly about the beauty of nature, patriotism of China and their earnestness of a splendid future. Except from being hung on door frames, Chunlian is a necessary item that is unfurled in the end of a dragon dance, an exultant performance in celebration.|$|E
5000|$|The Roll is in {{the form}} of a {{continuous}} <b>horizontal</b> <b>scroll</b> or rotulus, common in Chinese art, but all but unique in surviving examples of medieval Christian art. [...] It is made of several joined pieces of sheep vellum, is 31 cm high and about 10 metres long, and may be incomplete, as it starts with Chapter II and ends with Chapter X. [...] The Roll covers the early part of the Old Testament Book of Joshua using a reduced version of the Septuagint text; it includes Joshua's main military successes, ending with conquered kings paying him homage. At roughly this time, the Byzantine empire was enjoying military success in its campaigns in the Holy Land. It was originally painted in grisaille, by several artists, with partial coloring added later in a separate stage. The lettering is in majuscule and minuscule forms.|$|E
5000|$|Deborah Jowitt, {{writing in}} the Village Voice, {{describes}} the action and background of City of Paper. [...] "In a perfectly synchronized duet for Mei and Kanako Yokota, the women [...]. move along a sheet of heavy paper that has been unrolled with a startling snap from the wings". The movements repeat, with a [...] "purity" [...] of effect. [...] "The two spool out the movement {{as if it were}} an exercise in calligraphy—their coiling hands and arms and softly sinuous torsos fluent but precise. Whether the source behind the choreography is writing or some other exacting task, the dancers are serene." [...] While, writes Jowitt, there is no [...] "harsh critique" [...] of Chairman Mao Zedong, the piece ends in a startling way. [...] "Mei holds up a blank <b>horizontal</b> <b>scroll.</b> Bit by bit, black words appear on it: On a blank sheet of paper the freshest and most beautiful pictures can be painted. The words are Chairman Mao’s." [...] The meaning, Jowitt notes, could be at once ironic and hopeful.|$|E

The address bar has been replaced with a breadcrumb navigation bar. Icons of certain file types in Windows Explorer are [...] "live" [...] and can be scaled in size up to 256 × 256 pixels. The preview pane allows users to see thumbnails of various files and view the contents of documents. The details pane shows information such as file size and type, and allows viewing and editing of embedded tags in supported file formats. The Start menu has changed as well; incorporating an instant search box, and the All Programs list uses a <b>horizontal</b> <b>scroll</b> bar instead of the cascading flyout menu seen in Windows XP.

The content design follows a top-down approach according to the importance and a left-right disposition, per levels, according to the intended detail of the news content.

There may be navigation buttons on the screen representing the navigation keys on the keyboard. The user can click these buttons to scroll the screen. There may be very different methods of scrolling such as by using the "thumb", as popularly used with a PDF document.
