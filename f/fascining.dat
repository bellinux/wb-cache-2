40|$|Species {{prescriptions}} {{are developed}} for revegetating abandoned acidic coal overburden seepage {{sites in the}} Collie region of Western Australia. The research involved selecting appropriate plant species and determining successful methods of enhancing revegetation. Candidate species were screened for tolerance to acidic overburden materials, local climate conditions and metal toxicity. Methods tested included improving spoil conditions and trialing an alternative method for seeding. Twelve species of native plants were tested for tolerance in two acid overburden materials in pot and field trials. Eucalyptus robusta is the most tolerant, Eucalyptus camaldulensis and Eucalyptus cladocalyx are highly tolerant, Eucalyptus rudis and Melaleuca hamulosa demonstrate potential, provided adequate soil moisture is available. An important growth restriction factor in acid soils {{is the presence of}} free aluminium ions. A glasshouse trial performed on seven species for tolerance to aluminium toxicity revealed E. robusta as most tolerant and E. camaldulensis and Kunzea ericifolia a highly tolerant. E. rudis and M. hamulosa are moderately tolerant, but E. cladocalyx and Eucalyptus diversicolor are very sensitive to aluminium. Various methods were trialed to increase growth of seedlings transplanted on to acidic overburden sites. Both commercial cow manure and slow-release fertiliser tablets increase growth, whereas commercial potting mix and lime do not. Inoculation of plants with the ectomycorrhiza fungus Pisolithus tinctorius increases the amount of infection in roots but does not enhance plant growth. Supplementary fertilisation is necessary to maintain growth (nitrogen) and restore chlorophyll production (phosphorus) in fast growing eucalypt seedlings planted into typical acidic spoils. Poor levels of nutrient availability in such acidic sites appear to be the primary factor in ++retarding growth. In the absence of supplementation, foliage reddening is observed in several species. An alternative method of seeding dumps is <b>fascining.</b> Prepared dump surfaces may be covered with capsule-laden branchwood of myrtaceous species. Material of the locally available Kunzea ericifolia is effective in producing many seedlings. Subsequent seedling growth is enhanced with fertiliser and lime addition...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{studies showed}} that the actin {{cross-linking}} protein, <b>fascin,</b> undergoes rapid cycling between filopodial filaments. Here, we used an experimental and computational approach to dissect features of <b>fascin</b> exchange and incorporation in filopodia. Using expression of phosphomimetic <b>fascin</b> mutants, we determined that <b>fascin</b> in the phosphorylated state is primarily freely diffusing, whereas actin bundling in filopodia is accomplished by <b>fascin</b> dephosphorylated at serine 39. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching analysis revealed that <b>fascin</b> rapidly dissociates from filopodial filaments with a kinetic off-rate of 0. 12 s− 1 and that it undergoes diffusion at moderate rates with a coefficient of 6 μm 2 s− 1. This kinetic off-rate was recapitulated in vitro, indicating that dynamic behavior is intrinsic to the <b>fascin</b> cross-linker. A computational reaction–diffusion model showed that reversible cross-linking {{is required for the}} delivery of <b>fascin</b> to growing filopodial tips at sufficient rates. Analysis of <b>fascin</b> bundling indicated that filopodia are semiordered bundles with one bound <b>fascin</b> per 25 – 60 actin monomers...|$|R

40|$|AbstractWe have {{isolated}} a novel retina-specific gene, retinal <b>fascin,</b> encoding a {{new member}} of actin-bundling protein gene family, from a bovine retina cDNA library. The cDNA encodes a 492 amino acid protein which shows 36 – 57 % amino acid identity with three vertebrate <b>fascins,</b> echinoid <b>fascin</b> and Drosophila singed gene. Northern blot analysis revealed that retinal <b>fascin</b> mRNA was exclusively expressed {{in the eye and}} not seen in other tissues examined. In situ hybridization analysis indicated that retinal <b>fascin</b> mRNA signals were found only in the inner segment of the photoreceptor layer and outer nuclear layer, indicating that retinal <b>fascin</b> was specifically expressed in photoreceptor cells. As <b>fascins</b> are actin-bundling proteins important for constructing several intracellular structures, retinal <b>fascin</b> might play a pivotal role in photoreceptor cell-specific events, such as disk morphogenesis...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT <b>Fascin,</b> {{a highly}} conserved actin-bundling protein, localizes and {{functions}} at new cellular sites in both Drosophila and multiple mammalian cell types. During Drosophila follicle development, {{in addition to}} being cytoplasmic, <b>Fascin</b> is in the nuclei of the germline-derived nurse cells during stages 10 B– 12 (S 10 B– 12) and at the nuclear periphery during stage 13 (S 13). This localization is specific to <b>Fascin,</b> as other actin-binding proteins, Villin and Profilin, do not exhibit the same subcellular distribution. In addition, localization of <b>fascin</b> 1 to the nucleus and nuclear periphery is observed in multiple mammalian cell types. Thus the regula-tion and function of <b>Fascin</b> at these new cellular locations is likely to be highly conserved. In Drosophila, loss of prostaglandin signaling causes a global reduction in nuclear <b>Fascin</b> and a failure to relocalize to the nuclear periphery. Alterations in nuclear <b>Fascin</b> levels result in defects in nucleolar morphology in both Drosophila follicles and cultured mammalian cells, suggesting that nuclear <b>Fascin</b> {{plays an important role in}} nucleolar architecture. Given the numerous roles of <b>Fascin</b> in development and disease, including cancer, our novel finding that <b>Fascin</b> has functions within the nucleus sheds new light on the potential roles of <b>Fascin</b> in these contexts...|$|R
40|$|Oral {{squamous}} cell carcinoma (OSCC) prognosis is related to clinical stage and histological grade. However, this stratification needs to be refined. We conducted a comparative proteome study in microdissected samples from normal oral mucosa and OSCC to identify biomarkers for malignancy. <b>Fascin</b> and plectin were identified as differently expressed and both are implicated in several malignancies, but the clinical impacts of aberrant <b>fascin</b> and plectin expression in OSCCs remains largely unknown. Immunohistochemistry and real-time quantitative PCR were carried out in ex vivo OSCC samples and cell lines. A loss-of-function strategy using shRNA targeting <b>fascin</b> was employed to investigate in vitro and in vivo the <b>fascin</b> role on oral tumorigenesis. Transfections of microRNA mimics were performed {{to determine whether the}} <b>fascin</b> overexpression is regulated by miR- 138 and miR- 145. We found that <b>fascin</b> and plectin are frequently upregulated in OSCC samples and cell lines, but only <b>fascin</b> overexpression is an independent unfavorable prognostic indicator of disease-specific survival. In combination with advanced T stage, high <b>fascin</b> level is also an independent factor of disease-free survival. Knockdown of <b>fascin</b> in OSCC cells promoted cell adhesion and inhibited migration, invasion and EMT, and forced expression of miR- 138 in OSCC cells significantly decreased the expression of <b>fascin.</b> In addition, <b>fascin</b> downregulation leads to reduced filopodia formation and decrease on paxillin expression. The subcutaneous xenograft model showed that tumors formed in the presence of low levels of <b>fascin</b> were significantly smaller compared to those formed with high <b>fascin</b> levels. Collectively, our findings suggest that <b>fascin</b> expression correlates with disease progression and may serve as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target for patients with OSCC...|$|R
40|$|The {{parallel}} actin filament bundling protein <b>Fascin</b> is {{a critical}} protein in both disease and development. Overexpression of <b>Fascin</b> is linked to increased aggressiveness {{in a number of}} cancer types, including breast and colon carcinomas. Importantly, <b>Fascin</b> is not normally expressed in adult epithelial cells from which many of these cancers arise. Therefore, <b>Fascin</b> is increasingly cited as both a potential biomarker and therapeutic target in many types of cancer. <b>Fascin</b> is most commonly associated with the formation of filopodia and invadapodia (parallel actin filament bundle structures) to drive migration and invasion. However, <b>Fascin</b> activity and regulation remain poorly understood. In order for <b>Fascin</b> to be an effective target for cancer therapeutics, {{a better understanding of the}} mechanisms regulating <b>Fascin</b> activities in the cell is necessary. Prostaglandins (PGs) are short-lived lipid signaling molecules that mediate a wide range of biological activities. PGs act through G protein-coupled receptors to initiate signaling cascades that affect downstream targets, including actin cytoskeletal remodeling. Importantly, the key enzymes in the synthesis of PGs, cyclooxygenase (COX) 1 and 2, are the targets of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs like aspirin. Interestingly, like <b>Fascin,</b> PGs have been independently implicated in cancer development and metastasis and aspirin may reduce the risk of aggressive cancer. However, the exact mechanisms by which PGs mediate cancer development are unknown. The work presented in this thesis focused on novel PG-dependent regulation and activity of <b>Fascin.</b> The research presented here utilized Drosophila oogenesis as a model system to analyze PG-dependent <b>Fascin</b> activity. Drosophila oogenesis is an ideal model in which to study the activity and regulation of actin binding proteins like <b>Fascin.</b> Oogenesis consists of 14 morphologically defined stages, which are observable many times over within a single isolated pair of ovaries. A developing follicle consists of 16 germline cells – 15 nurse, or support cells, and a single oocyte. The nurse cells are of particular interest because they are the sites of dynamic actin remodeling during mid-late oogenesis. During stage 10 B, an array of radially-aligned actin filament bundles form at the nurse cell membranes and extend inwards towards the nucleus. A network of cortical actin is also strengthened during this stage. These actin structures are essential for the completion of oogenesis, and ultimately female fertility. Importantly, PGs and <b>Fascin</b> are required for this actin remodeling; genetic loss of <b>Fascin</b> or the Drosophila COX-like enzyme Pxt (Peroxinectin-like) leads to disruption of cytoplasmic actin remodeling, and ultimately, female sterility. Using this model system, work presented here describes the discovery of <b>Fascin</b> as a downstream target of PGs to promote actin bundle formation, described in Chapter 2. Additionally, <b>Fascin</b> is required for strengthening of the cortical actin network downstream of PGs. This observation is one of the first to describe a role for <b>Fascin</b> in a branched actin network. Additionally, <b>Fascin</b> is regulated by a specific PG – PGF 2 α – during S 10 B to promote follicle development. Finally, Chapter 2 shows that PGs target specific actin binding proteins to promote cytoskeletal remodeling; Villin, another actin bundling protein, does not interact with PGs. Chapter 3 describes the novel observation that <b>Fascin</b> localizes to the nucleus and the nuclear periphery in Drosophila nurse cells. This finding is significant, as it is the first to describe <b>Fascin</b> in a context other than cytoplasmic. <b>Fascin</b> localization in and around the nucleus is specific and dynamic, and changes throughout late stage oogenesis, suggesting regulated functions at these sites. <b>Fascin</b> localization is regulated by PGs, and loss of Pxt leads to reduced nuclear <b>Fascin</b> localization and failure to localize to the nuclear periphery. Additionally, <b>Fascin</b> has novel potential functions in the nucleus and at the nuclear periphery. Loss of <b>Fascin</b> leads to disruption of nucleolar morphology in the nurse cell nuclei. Additionally, loss of PGs, which cause reduced nuclear <b>Fascin</b> levels, also causes abnormal nucleolar morphology. These data suggest that PGs regulate <b>Fascin</b> to control nucleolar organization. At the nuclear periphery, <b>Fascin</b> localization requires components of the protein complex that links the nucleoplasm to the cytoplasm, termed the LINC complex. Loss of an essential LINC complex protein, Koi, leads to a loss of nuclear periphery <b>Fascin</b> localization. These data suggest that <b>Fascin</b> may be a novel component of the LINC complex. Finally, Chapter 4 describes regulation of <b>Fascin</b> by phosphorylation at conserved serine residues. PGs affect <b>Fascin</b> phosphorylation, and loss of PGs leads to more heavily phosphorylated <b>Fascin.</b> Additionally, phosphorylation of <b>Fascin</b> alters localization to the nucleus and to the nuclear periphery. These data suggest that one mechanism by which PGs regulate <b>Fascin</b> is to control its phosphorylation status to affect subcellular distribution. In summary, the work presented in this thesis has demonstrated novel regulation and function of the actin bundling protein <b>Fascin</b> using Drosophila oogenesis as a model. Importantly, these functions and regulation of <b>Fascin</b> are likely conserved in mammals, and may have implications in human health and disease. Continued study of the activity and regulation of actin binding proteins like <b>Fascin</b> in Drosophila will likely have great effect on our understanding of many human diseases...|$|R

40|$|<b>Fascin</b> is an actin-binding and {{bundling}} {{protein that}} is highly upregulated in most epithelial cancers. <b>Fascin</b> promotes cell migration and adhesion dynamics in vitro and tumour cell metastasis in vivo.

40|$|Background & AimsPancreatic ductal {{adenocarcinoma}} (PDAC) {{is often}} lethal {{because it is}} highly invasive and metastasizes rapidly. The actin-bundling protein <b>fascin</b> {{has been identified as}} a biomarker of invasive and advanced PDAC and regulates cell migration and invasion in vitro. We investigated <b>fascin</b> expression and its role in PDAC progression in mice. MethodsWe used KRasG 12 D p 53 R 172 H Pdx 1 -Cre (KPC) mice to investigate the effects of <b>fascin</b> deficiency on development of pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIn), PDAC, and metastasis. We measured levels of <b>fascin</b> in PDAC cell lines and 122 human resected PDAC samples, along with normal ductal and acinar tissues; we associated levels with patient outcomes. ResultsPancreatic ducts and acini from control mice and early-stage PanINs from KPC mice were negative for <b>fascin,</b> but approximately 6 % of PanIN 3 and 100 % of PDAC expressed <b>fascin.</b> Fascin-deficient KRasG 12 D p 53 R 172 H Pdx 1 -Cre mice had longer survival times, delayed onset of PDAC, and a lower PDAC tumor burdens than KPC mice; loss of <b>fascin</b> did not affect invasion of PDAC into bowel or peritoneum in mice. Levels of slug and <b>fascin</b> correlated in PDAC cells; slug was found to regulate transcription of <b>Fascin</b> along with the epithelial−mesenchymal transition. In PDAC cell lines and cells from mice, <b>fascin</b> concentrated in filopodia and was required for their assembly and turnover. <b>Fascin</b> promoted intercalation of filopodia into mesothelial cell layers and cell invasion. Nearly all human PDAC samples expressed <b>fascin,</b> and higher <b>fascin</b> histoscores correlated with poor outcomes, vascular invasion, and time to recurrence. ConclusionsThe actin-bundling protein <b>fascin</b> is regulated by slug and involved in late-stage PanIN and PDAC formation in mice. <b>Fascin</b> appears to promote formation of filopodia and invasive activities of PDAC cells.

40|$|<b>Fascins,</b> {{a family}} of actin-bundling proteins, are {{expressed}} in a spatially and temporally restricted manner during development and often in cancer. <b>Fascin</b> 1 has a clear role in cell migration in vitro, but its role in vivo in mammals is not well understood. Here, we investigate the role of <b>fascin</b> 1 in the melanocyte lineage and in melanoma cells. <b>Fascin</b> 1 knockout causes hypopigmentation in adult mice owing to migration and cell cycle progression defects in melanoblasts, the melanocyte precursor cell.

To identify proteins that organize the cytoskeleton of stereocilia, we scrutinized the hair-cell transcriptome of zebrafish.

Immunolabeling of zebrafish hair cells {{and the use of}} transgenic zebrafish that expressed <b>fascin</b> 2 b fused to green fluorescent protein demonstrated that <b>fascin</b> 2 b localized to stereocilia specifically. When filamentous actin and recombinant fusion protein containing <b>fascin</b> 2 b were combined in vitro to determine their dissociation constant, a K(d) ≈ 0. 37 µM was observed. Electron microscopy showed that <b>fascin</b> 2 b-actin filament complexes formed parallel actin bundles in vitro. We demonstrated that expression of <b>fascin</b> 2 b or espin, another actin-bundling protein, in COS- 7 cells induced the formation of long filopodia. Coexpression showed synergism between these proteins through the formation of extra-long protrusions. Using phosphomutant <b>fascin</b> 2 b proteins, which mimicked either a phosphorylated or a nonphosphorylated state, in COS- 7 cells and in transgenic hair cells, we showed that both formation of long filopodia and localization of <b>fascin</b> 2 b to stereocilia were dependent on serine 38. Overexpression of wild-type <b>fascin</b> 2 b in hair cells was correlated with increased stereociliary length relative to controls.

40|$|Cell {{adhesion}} {{to individual}} macromolecules of the extracellular matrix has dramatic {{effects on the}} subcellular localization of the actin-bundling protein <b>fascin</b> and {{on the ability of}} cells to form stable <b>fascin</b> microspikes. The actin-binding activity of <b>fascin</b> is down-regulated by phosphorylation, and we used two differentiated cell types, C 2 C 12 skeletal myoblasts and LLC-PK 1 kidney epithelial cells, to examine the hypothesis that cell adhesion to the matrix components fibronectin, laminin- 1, and thrombospondin- 1 differentially regulates <b>fascin</b> phosphorylation. In both cell types, treatment with the PKC activator 12 -tetradecanoyl phorbol 13 -acetate (TPA) or adhesion to fibronectin led to a diffuse distribution of <b>fascin</b> after 1 h. C 2 C 12 cells contain the PKC family members α, γ, and λ, and PKCα localization was altered upon cell adhesion to fibronectin. Two-dimensional isoelectric focusing/SDS-polyacrylamide gels were used to determine that <b>fascin</b> became phosphorylated in cells adherent to fibronectin and was inhibited by the PKC inhibitors calphostin C and chelerythrine chloride. Phosphorylation of <b>fascin</b> was not detected in cells adherent to thrombospondin- 1 or to laminin- 1. LLC-PK 1 cells expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) -fascin also displayed similar regulation of <b>fascin</b> phosphorylation. LLC-PK 1 cells expressing GFP-fascin S 39 A, a nonphosphorylatable mutant, did not undergo spreading and focal contact organization on fibronectin, whereas cells expressing a GFP-fascin S 39 D mutant with constitutive negative charge spread more extensively than wild-type cells. In contrast, C 2 C 12 cells coexpressing S 39 A <b>fascin</b> with endogenous <b>fascin</b> remained competent to form microspikes on thrombospondin- 1, and cells that expressed <b>fascin</b> S 39 D attached to thrombospondin- 1 but did not form microspikes. Blockade of PKCα activity by TPA-induced down-regulation led to actin association of wild-type <b>fascin</b> in fibronectin-adherent C 2 C 12 and LLC-PK 1 cells but did not alter the distribution of S 39 A or S 39 D <b>fascins.</b> The association of <b>fascin</b> with actin in fibronectin-adherent cells was also evident in the presence of an inhibitory antibody to integrin α 5 subunit.

Our in vitro results were consistent with correlative studies of <b>fascin</b> expression with the clinico-pathological parameters of the OSCC patients. <b>Fascin</b> expression in OSCC showed statistically significant correlation with increased tumor stage (P = 0. 041), increased lymph node metastasis (P = 0. 001), less differentiation (P = 0. 005), increased recurrence (P = 0. 038) and shorter survival (P = 0. 004) of the patients. Conclusion In conclusion, our results indicate that <b>fascin</b> promotes tumor progression and activates AKT and MAPK pathways in OSCC-derived cells. Further, our correlative studies of <b>fascin</b> expression in OSCC with clinico-pathological parameters of the patients indicate that <b>fascin</b> may prove to be useful in prognostication and treatment of OSCC. </p...|$|R
40|$|Background: <b>Fascin</b> is {{associated}} with increased cell motility in colorectal tumours but is absent from the normal colonic epithelium. We examined the expression of <b>fascin</b> in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and its location at regions undergoing restitution and regeneration.

Methods: Immunohistochemistry was performed on colonic tissue from IBD patients to determine changes in <b>fascin</b> expression and distribution. A human colorectal epithelial cell line was treated with 5 -aminosalicylate (a common treatment for IBD), or sodium butyrate to determine the effect on <b>fascin</b> expression and cell motility. Results: <b>Fascin</b> overexpression was observed in both ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s colitis and expression correlated with disease severity.

40|$|<b>Fascin</b> is an actin-bundling {{protein that}} {{is found in}} {{membrane}} ruffles, microspikes, and stress fibers. The expression of <b>fascin</b> is greatly increased in many transformed cells, {{as well as in}} specialized normal cells including neuronal cells and antigen-presenting dendritic cells. A morphological characteristic common to these cells expressing high levels of <b>fascin</b> is the development of many membrane protrusions in which <b>fascin</b> is predominantly present. To examine whether <b>fascin</b> contributes to the alterations in microfilament organization at the cell periphery, we have expressed <b>fascin</b> in LLC-PK 1 epithelial cells to levels as high as those found in transformed cells and in specialized normal cells. Expression of <b>fascin</b> results in large changes in morphology, the actin cytoskeleton, and cell motility: fascin-transfected cells form an increased number of longer and thicker microvilli on apical surfaces, extend lamellipodia-like structures at basolateral surfaces, and show disorganization of cell–cell contacts. Cell migration activity is increased by 8 – 17 times when assayed by modified Boyden chamber. Microinjection of a <b>fascin</b> protein into LLC-PK 1 cells causes similar morphological alterations including the induction of lamellipodia at basolateral surfaces and formation of an increased number of microvilli on apical surfaces. Furthermore, microinjection of <b>fascin</b> into REF- 52 cells, normal fibroblasts, induces the formation of many lamellipodia at all regions of cell periphery. These results together suggest that <b>fascin</b> is directly responsible for membrane protrusions through reorganization of the microfilament cytoskeleton at the cell periphery...|$|R
40|$|The actin-bundling protein, <b>fascin,</b> is {{a member}} of the cytoskeletal protein family that has {{restricted}} expression in specialized normal cells. However, many studies have reported the induction of this protein in various transformed cells including breast cancer cells. While the role of <b>fascin</b> in the regulation of breast cancer cell migration has been previously shown, the underlying molecular mechanism remained poorly defined. We have used variety of immunological and functional assays to study whether <b>fascin</b> regulates breast cancer metastasis-associated molecules. In this report we found a direct relationship between <b>fascin</b> expression in breast cancer patients and; metastasis and shorter disease-free survival. Most importantly, in vitro interference with <b>fascin</b> expression by loss or gain of function demonstrates a central role for this protein in regulating the cell morphology, migration and invasion potential. Our results show that <b>fascin</b> regulation of invasion is mediated via modulating several metastasis-associated genes. We show for the first time that <b>fascin</b> downregulates the expression and nuclear translocation of a key metastasis suppressor protein known as breast cancer metastasis suppressor- 1 (BRMS 1). In addition, <b>fascin</b> up-regulates NF-kappa B activity, which is essential for metastasis.

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Fascin</b> is an actin {{bundling}} protein with {{roles in}} the formation of cell protrusions and motility of mesenchymal and neuronal cells. <b>Fascin</b> is normally low or absent from epithelia, but is upregulated in several epithelial neoplasms where it may contribute to an invasive phenotype. Here, we report on the prevalence and potential clinical significance of <b>fascin</b> expression in relation to the progression of colorectal adenocarcinoma and to tumor cell proliferation as measured by Ki 67 index. Methods Conventional tissue sections of 107 colorectal adenomas and 35 adenocarcinomas were analyzed by immunohistochemistry for <b>fascin</b> and Ki 67 expression. <b>Fascin</b> expression and Ki 67 proliferation index were also investigated by use of a tissue microarray containing cores from a further 158 colorectal adenocarcinomas and 15 adenomas linked to a CCF, IRB-approved database with a mean of 38 months of clinical follow-up. Survival analysis was carried out by the Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression methods. Results <b>Fascin</b> was not expressed by the normal colonic epithelium. In conventional sections, 16 % of adenomas and 26 % of adenocarcinomas showed <b>fascin</b> expression in greater than 10 % of the tumor cells. In the clinically-annotated tumors, <b>fascin</b> immunoreactivity was more common in tumors located in the proximal colon (p = 0. 009), but was not associated with age, gender, or TNM stage. Patients with stage III/IV adenocarcinomas (n = 62) with strong <b>fascin</b> immunoreactivity had a worse prognosis than patients with low or absent <b>fascin,</b> (3 -year overall survival of 11 % versus 43 % for fascin-negative patients; p = 0. 023). In adenomas, <b>fascin</b> and Ki 67 tended to be inversely correlated at the cellular level; this trend was less apparent in adenocarcinomas. Conclusion <b>Fascin</b> is upregulated in a proportion of adenomas, where its expression is often focal. Strong and diffuse expression was seen in a subset of advanced colorectal adenocarcinomas that correlated with shorter survival in stage III and IV patients. <b>Fascin</b> may have prognostic value as an early biomarker for more aggressive colorectal adenocarcinomas. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. <b>Fascin</b> 1 (FSCN 1) {{involved}} in cell motility and filo-podia assembly plays {{important roles in}} biological processes such as cancer invasion and metastasis of multiple epithelial tumors. High-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC) is aggressive and metastatic by acquiring an invasive phenotype and this step requires remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton. Thus, the present study aimed to investigate the expression of <b>fascin</b> 1 in HGSOC tissues {{as well as its}} clinical significance such as prognostic predictors and its utility of therapeutic target. <b>Fascin</b> 1 and β-catenin were evaluated using immuno-histochemistry on a tissue microarray of 79 HGSOC. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) approach was used to knock down <b>fascin</b> 1 expression in ovarian cancer cell lines to determine whether <b>fascin</b> 1 contributes to tumor cell proliferation, migration and invasion. <b>Fascin</b> 1 expression levels were determined by western blot analysis after siRNA transfec-tion using two human ovarian cancer cell lines (SKOV 3 and OVCAR 3). <b>Fascin</b> 1 overexpression was significantly corre-lated with lymph node involvement, distance metastasis and high International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage (III/IV) (P< 0. 05). A Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the <b>fascin</b> 1 expression group was significantly associated with poor overall survival (P= 0. 010). We showed that inactivation of <b>fascin</b> 1 by siRNA transfection led to a drop in cell viability, and significantly decreased tumor cell proliferation, migration and invasiveness compared to untransfected cells. We found that <b>fascin</b> 1 expression is a potential poor marker of prognosis for patients with HGSOC and knockdown of <b>fascin</b> 1 suppresses ovarian cancer cell proliferation and migration, this could be applied for thera-peutic targets in ovarian cancer treatment...|$|R
40|$|<b>Fascin</b> is an actin {{cross-linking}} protein, which regulates actin {{dynamics and}} filopodia or spike formation, {{as well as}} the epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and has been implicated in cell motility. Although, <b>fascin</b> is pivotal in mediating the aggressive behaviour of various types of cancer, its prognostic significance according to tumour stage has yet to be evaluated. Therefore, the present study investigated <b>fascin</b> expression in 194 patients diagnosed with invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast between 2000 and 2005. <b>Fascin</b> protein expression levels were evaluated by immunostaining on a tissue microarray, and the association between <b>fascin</b> expression and various clinicopathological parameters was analysed. <b>Fascin</b> expression was significantly correlated with various clinicopathological parameters, including high histological grade, tumour necrosis, resistance to adjuvant therapy, high expression of p 53 and Ki- 67 and specific therapeutic markers (oestrogen and progesterone receptor negativity; all P< 0. 05). Furthermore, univariate and multivariate analyses identified a significant association between <b>fascin</b> expression, and poor disease-free and overall survival, in late-stage breast cancer (all P< 0. 05).

40|$|Summary The actin {{bundling}} protein <b>fascin</b> 1 is not {{expressed in}} adult epithelial tissues, but during development it is transiently expressed {{in many different}} cell types, and later in adults it is expressed in a subset of immune cells, nervous tissues, endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells and pericytes.

We speculated that as angiogenesis involves migration and invasion of tissues by endothelial cells, <b>fascin</b> 1 might have a role in both normal and tumour angiogenesis. Here, we provide evidence that loss of <b>fascin</b> 1 causes relatively minor reductions to angiogenesis during embryonic, postnatal and cancerous development by examining E 12. 5 hindbrains, postnatal retinas and B 16 F 0 tumour cell allografts in <b>fascin</b> 1 -null mice. We also find that in <b>fascin</b> 1 null tissues, endothelial cells display reduced filopodia formation during sprouting.

40|$|Background: <b>Fascin</b> is a {{globular}} actin cross-linking protein, which {{plays a major}} role in forming parallel actin bundles in cell protrusions and is found to be associated with tumor cell invasion and metastasis in various type of cancers including oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Previously, we have demonstrated that <b>fascin</b> regulates actin polymerization and thereby promotes cell motility in K 8 -depleted OSCC cells. In the present study we have investigated the role of <b>fascin</b> in tumor progression of OSCC.

In this study, we retrospectively examined the expression of <b>fascin</b> in ESCC samples by immunohistochemistry and revealed that overexpression of <b>fascin</b> was related to poor patient survival. RNAi-mediated knockdown of <b>fascin</b> in ESCC cells significantly inhibited cell proliferation and invasiveness, whereas forced expression of <b>fascin</b> in immortalized esophageal epithelial cells accelerated cell proliferation and invasiveness. To explore the underlying mechanism, cDNA microarray was performed to identify the differential gene expression profiles between a fascin-depleted cell line by RNAi and the corresponding control ESCC cells. Results showed that 296 genes were differentially expressed on <b>fascin</b> depletion. In this study, we focused on two down-regulated genes: CYR 61 and CTGF. We found that restored expression of either CYR 61 or CTGF led to a recovery of the suppression of cellular proliferation and invasiveness induced by down-regulation of <b>fascin</b> expression; the protein level of CYR 61 and CTGF were up-regulated in ESCCs and their expression pattern correlated with <b>fascin</b> overexpression. Finally, analysis of signal transduction revealed that <b>fascin</b> affected the expressions of CYR 61 and CTGF through transforming growth factor (TGF) -β pathway. Taken together, we propose that <b>fascin</b> regulates the proliferation and invasiveness of ESCC cells by modulating the expression of CTGF and CYR 61 via TGF-β pathway...|$|R

40|$|<b>Fascin</b> is {{the main}} actin {{filament}} bundling protein in filopodia. Because of the important role filopodia play in cell migration, <b>fascin</b> is emerging as a major target for cancer drug discovery. However, {{an understanding of the}} mechanism of bundle formation by <b>fascin</b> is critically lacking. <b>Fascin</b> consists of four β-trefoil domains. Here, we show that <b>fascin</b> contains two major actin-binding sites, coinciding with regions of high sequence conservation in β-trefoil domains 1 and 3. The site in β-trefoil- 1 is located near the binding site of the <b>fascin</b> inhibitor macroketone and comprises residue Ser- 39, whose phosphorylation by protein kinase C down-regulates actin bundling and formation of filopodia. The site in β-trefoil- 3 is related by pseudo- 2 -fold symmetry to that in β-trefoil- 1. The two sites are ∼ 5 nm apart, resulting in a distance between actin filaments in the bundle of ∼ 8. 1 nm. Residue mutations in both sites disrupt bundle formation in vitro as assessed by co-sedimentation with actin and electron microscopy and severely impair formation of filopodia in cells as determined by rescue experiments in fascin-depleted cells. Mutations of other areas of the <b>fascin</b> surface also affect actin bundling and formation of filopodia albeit to a lesser extent, suggesting that, in addition to the two major actin-binding sites, <b>fascin</b> makes secondary contacts with other filaments in the bundle. In a high resolution crystal structure of <b>fascin,</b> molecules of glycerol and polyethylene glycol are bound in pockets located within the two major actin-binding sites. These molecules could guide the rational design of new anticancer <b>fascin</b> inhibitors. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the significance of <b>fascin</b> expression in colorectal carcinoma. METHODS: This is a retrospective study of 167 consecutive, well-documented cases of primary colorectal adenocarcinoma for which archival material of surgical specimens from primary tumor resections were available. We chose a representative tissue sample block and examined <b>fascin</b> expression by immunohistochemistry using a primary antibody against "fascin". We calculated the "immunohistochemical score (IHS) " of <b>fascin</b> for each case, which was calculated from the multiplication of scores for the percentage of stained cells and the staining intensity. RESULTS: <b>Fascin</b> immunoreactivity was observed in 59 (35. 3 %) of all cases with strong reactivity in 24 (14. 4 %), moderate reactivity in 25 (14. 9 %) and weak reactivity in 10 (6. 0 %) cases. Strong/moderate immunoreactivities were mostly observed in invasive fronts of the tumors or in both invasive and other areas. <b>Fascin</b> immunoreactivity scores were significantly higher in tumors with lymph node metastasis (p: 0. 002) and advanced stage presentation (p: 0. 007). There was no relation between <b>fascin</b> expression and age, gender, depth of invasion, distant metastasis or histological grade (p> 0. 05). There was a higher and statistically significant correlation between <b>fascin</b> immunoreactivity in the invasive borders of tumors and lymph node metastasis (r: 0. 747, p: 0. 005). In stage III/IV tumors, two-year survival was 92. 2 % in tumors without <b>fascin</b> immunoreactivity, and only 60. 0 % in tumors with a <b>fascin</b> IHS> 10 (p: 0. 003). CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that <b>fascin</b> is heterogeneously expressed in approximately one third of colorectal carcinomas with a significant association with lymph node metastasis, tumor stage and location.
