Although practically {{all of the}} Maryland troops re-enlisted, the losses from the battles around New York, combined with the expired enlistments, made necessary a reorganization of the army. In doing so, General Washington organized all of the Maryland troops into seven regiments of {{the line in the}} Maryland Brigade, which collectively became known as the [...] "Maryland Line." [...] Smallwood’s regiment was too depleted in numbers to form a regiment to itself but it gave many men and officers, including one of the subsequent wartime commanders, to the Fifth Regiment of the Line, and on 10 December 1776, Colonel William Richardson assumed command of the new regiment.|$|E
40|$|The Indian {{horticulture}} distribution {{sector is}} comprised of companies that sell products in the wholesale market and are geographically established outside rural warehouses and markets, although many of these companies are located very near them. The horticulture market lacks packages that are palletizable and modular, appropriate for different products, clean, cheap, and if returnable, with a guarantee of return and disinfection, with guaranteed availability, and when empty; do not enter the commercialization area. The capacity of managing returns has been considered as an important competitiveness factor of companies. This {{is especially important for}} the food industry given the high perishability of its products and the complexity of its distribution channel. These factors combined make critical the relation between the members of the distribution channel. Traditionally, the products flow in a distribution channel happens from the industry towards the final consumer. However, some factors such as defective products, or damaged, <b>date</b> <b>expired,</b> recyclable, order errors cause a flow in the opposite sense, what generates the need for a logistics operation called reverse.

40|$|Introduction: To {{observe how}} vacuum {{assisted}} venous drainage (VAVD) {{may influence the}} flow in a cardiopulmonary bypass circuit with different size of venous lines and cannulas. &# 13; Methods: The experimental circuit was assembled to represent the cardiopulmonary bypass circuit routinely used during cardiac surgery. Wall suction was applied directly, modulated and measured into the venous reservoir. The blood flow was measured with a flow-meter positioned on the venous line. The circuit prime volume was replaced with group O <b>date</b> <b>expired</b> re-suspended red cells and Plasmalyte 148 to a hematocrit of 28 % to 30 %. &# 13; Results: In an open circuit with gravity siphon venous drain, angled cannulae drain more than straight ones regardless the amount of suction applied to the venous line (16 Fr straight cannula (S) drains 90 ml/min less than a 16 Fr angled (A) with a siphon gravity). The same flow can be obtained with lower cannula size and higher suction (i. e. 12 A with and - 30 mmHg). Tables have been created to list how the flow varies according {{to the size of}} the cannulas, the size of the venous tubes, and the amount of suction applied to the system. &# 13; Conclusions: Vacuum assisted venous drainage allows the use of smaller cannulae and venous lines to maintain a good venous return, which is very useful during minimally invasive approaches. The present study should be considered as a preliminary attempt to create a scientific-based starting point for a uniform the use of VAVD. &# 13; Keywords: cardio-pulmonary bypass; experimental study; vacuum assisted drainage...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper was}} to detect the food label reading habit of consumer according to consumer age. To achieve this goal author of this paper has adopted five variables with independent and dependent status. Four variables were independent like reading complete food label, reading manufacturing <b>date,</b> reading <b>expire</b> <b>date</b> and reading ingredients. One variable was dependent like influence on purchase behavior. The data was collected through questionnaire and 350 questions were distributed among customers. Author has received 251 valid questions. The data was divided into two groups. The two groups were designed with respect to age range. In (Group I) the respondent’s age ranges was 20 - 25 and mean age was 23. Whereas in (Group II) the age was 26 - 30 and average age was 27. Correlation and regression test were conducted and results has unfolded {{the fact that there is}} a difference in both groups for food label reading habits. In Group I three variables significantly influence on purchase behavior of consumer while purchasing food items like reading manufacturing <b>date,</b> reading <b>expire</b> <b>date</b> and reading ingredients. In Group II only two variables like reading ingredients and reading manufacturing date has significant effect on purchase behavior of consumer while purchasing food products. Two variables were common in both groups like reading manufacturing date and reading ingredients. This result has also depicted that consumer normally, irrespective of age group; focus on manufacturing date, which give the freshness of food product, and ingredients to know the nutrients used in processing the food. ...|$|R

Ascorbic acid content in food can be affected by processing and storage conditions. Commercial cashew apple juice samples, ready-to-drink and concentrated, were analyzed. The ascorbic acid content, total titratable acidity, total soluble solids, and pH of the juices were determined during storage at 4 °C after the containers were opened. The ascorbic acid content presented a great variability among the samples analyzed ranging from 37. 3 to 46. 3 mg. 100 mL- 1 in ready-to-drink juices and from 75. 7 to 152 mg. 100 mL- 1 in concentrated juices. The storage of commercial cashew apple juices for 48 hours at 4 °C resulted in ascorbic acid losses of up to 8. 8 % for concentrated and 6. 4 % for ready-to-drink juices.
