Albizu Campos, {{who had served}} as a Lieutenant in the United States Army during World War <b>I,</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> the cadets had to adopt a system of strict military training if they were to become a powerful Puerto Rican Army. He believed that a well-trained and disciplined army would eventually be able to fight against the United States imperialism which ruled the island. Albizu Campos often referred to the cadets as the Ejército Libertador de Puerto Rico (The Liberation Army of Puerto Rico).|$|E
25|$|However, the Easterners, {{who were}} {{by far the}} {{majority}} in court, were not pleased that Yi I was apparently neutral in the conflict, when they believed that Sim Euigyeom had clearly wronged. However, Yi <b>I</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> both Kim and Sim had done {{both good and bad}} things. Sim had prevented a fifth purge of the Sarim (by chasing Yi Lyang and his followers from court in 1563), while Kim had helped form a Sarim government by introducing many new scholars into the government. However, Sim had interfered in politics despite his status as a relative of the queen, while Kim had been close to Yun Wonhyeong despite his being a Seonbi. Yi I therefore believed that both sides were equal in their deeds and misdeeds.|$|E

I explain why it is less absurd to believe or assert (om 1) or (com 1) than to believe or assert (om) or (com) and show that despite appearances, subsequent iterations of (om 1) or (com 1) do not decrease the absurdity of believing or asserting them...|$|R

60|$|Let me be {{considered}} therefore {{to have made}} quite clear <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> with a quite special intensity in the independent consideration of Scotland and Ireland as apart from England. <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that,</b> in the proper sense of the words, Scotland is an independent nation, even if Edward VII. is the King of Scotland. <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that,</b> in the proper sense of words, Ireland is an independent nation, even if Edward VII. is King of Ireland. But {{the fact is that}} I have an even bolder and wilder belief than either of these. <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> England is an independent nation. <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> England also has its independent colour and history, and meaning. <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> England could produce costumes quite as queer as the kilt; <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> England has heroes fully as untranslateable as Brian Boru, and consequently <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> Edward VII. is, among his innumerable other functions, really King of England. If my Scotch friends insist, let us call it one of his quite obscure, unpopular, and minor titles; one of his relaxations. A little while ago he was Duke of Cornwall; but for a family accident he might still have been King of Hanover. Nor do I think that we should blame the simple Cornishmen if they spoke of him in a rhetorical moment by his Cornish title, nor the well-meaning Hanoverians if they classed him with Hanoverian Princes.|$|R

[...] Zhirinovsky said that both countries were [...] "under occupation." [...] and that [...] "to survive, we could set aside places on U.S. and Russian territories to deport this small but troublesome tribe." [...] Buchanan strongly rejected this endorsement, saying he would provide safe haven to persecuted minorities if Zhirinovsky were ever elected Russia's president, eliciting a harsh response by Zhirinovsky: [...] "You soiled your pants {{as soon as you}} got my congratulations. Who are you afraid of: Zionists?" [...] Zhirinovsky repeatedly denied his father's Jewishness until he published Ivan Close Your Soul in July 2001, describing how his father, Volf Isaakovich Eidelshtein, changed his surname from Eidelshtein to Zhirinovsky. He rhetorically asked, [...] "Why should I reject Russian blood, Russian culture, Russian land, and {{fall in love with the}} Jewish people only because of that single drop of blood that my father left in my mother's body?" [...] Another frequently cited quote from Zhirinovsky is [...] "My mother was Russian and my father was a lawyer". Zhirinovsky later disowned the statement, after researching his father's life in Israel (where, after leaving Zhrinovsky's mother, he had immigrated in 1949 with a new wife, and worked as an agronomist in Tel Aviv). Discussing the statement, Zhirinovsky says: [...] "Journalists mocked me: for saying I was the son of a lawyer. And I am really the son of an agronomist."

40|$|Abstract: In this journal, Hamid Vahid argues against three {{families}} of explanation of Mooreparadoxicality. The {{first is the}} Wittgensteinian approach; I assert that p just in case <b>I</b> assert <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> p. So making a Moore-paradoxical assertion involves contradictory assertions. The second is the epistemic approach, one committed to: if I am justified in <b>believing</b> <b>that</b> p then <b>I</b> am justified in <b>believing</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> p. So {{it is impossible to}} have a justified omissive Mooreparadoxical belief. The third is the conscious belief approach, being committed to: if <b>I</b> consciously <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> p then <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> p. So if I have a conscious omissive Moore-paradoxical belief, then I have contradictory second-order beliefs. In their place, Vahid argues for the defectiveinterpretation approach, broadly that charity requires us to discount the utterer of a Mooreparadoxical sentence as a speaker. I agree that the Wittgensteinian approach is unsatisfactory. But so is the defective-interpretation approach. However, there is a satisfactory version of each of the epistemic and conscious-belief approaches...|$|R
