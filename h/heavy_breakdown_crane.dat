50|$|In 1990 the Douglas-Peel {{trackbed}} {{was designated}} as the Rail Trail and much work undertaken to improve the station underfoot. It was {{at this time that}} the <b>breakdown</b> <b>crane</b> belonging to the railway was placed on permanent display at the station, and a section of track installed for it to sit on; the crane had been built by the Birmingham-based company of Richard C. Gibbins and delivedred new to the railway in 1893, being stored at various locations prior to its removal to Union Mills in 1991 where it still remains today.|$|R
50|$|Post-WWII, weight {{limitations}} on the aging viaduct and its limited maintenance led to a ban on double heading across both Belah and Deepdale Viaducts. As two light locomotives were still needed to haul trains up the inclines of the Tebay line, one worked as a banker at the rear. This also caused problems if the <b>breakdown</b> <b>crane</b> from Darlington was needed. This 45 ton crane itself had a weight of 156 tons. Hauling it across the viaducts required it to be spaced from the locomotive by at least three empty wagons, to distribute the load.|$|R

50|$|Taking her uncle's legacy, Crane visits her {{maternal}} aunt in Copenhagen, {{where she}} is treated as a highly desirable racial exotic. Missing black people, she returns to New York City. Close to a mental <b>breakdown,</b> <b>Crane</b> happens onto a store-front revival and has a charismatic religious experience. After marrying the preacher who converted her, she moves {{with him to the}} rural Deep South. There she is disillusioned by the people's adherence to religion. In each of her moves, Crane fails to find fulfillment. She is looking for more than how to integrate her mixed ancestry. She expresses complex feelings about what she and her friends consider genetic differences between races.|$|R

50|$|A {{railroad}} crane (North America: crane car or wrecker; UK: <b>breakdown</b> <b>crane)</b> {{is a type}} of crane used on {{a railroad}} for one of three primary purposes: freight handling in goods yards, permanent way (PW) maintenance, and accident recovery work. Although the design differs according to the type of work, the basic configuration is similar in all cases: a rotating crane body is mounted on a sturdy chassis fitted with flanged wheels. The body supports the jib (UK; North America: boom) and provides all the lifting and operating mechanisms; on larger cranes, an operator's cabin is usually provided. The chassis is fitted with buffing (UK) and/or coupling gear to allow the crane to be moved by a locomotive, although many are also self-propelled to allow limited movement about a work site.|$|R

40|$|Like {{many areas}} of engineering, changes in {{technology}} and working conditions have had a signifcant impact on breakdown and recovery equipment and techniques. Although <b>breakdown</b> <b>cranes</b> have hardly changed in concept for 100 years and innovations like hydraulic jacking equipment, when j r s t established, was heavy and cumbersome, developments in materials and technology spurred on by the Health and Safety at Work Act and pressures to reduce costs in the 1970 s {{have resulted in the}} introduction of a much wider range of equipment, which is lighter and easier to manage. This has reached a point where, for instance, only 15 per cent of incidents are now dealt with by cranes. This paper traces these changes over the last I 5 years and shows how the current range of equipment available to recovery teams has developed. ...|$|R
5000|$|According to Loudwire, [...] "'Wastelands' {{starts with}} a hip-hop verse and the song {{has a lot of}} groove with heavy drum and bass. The chorus is catchy yet sludgy and has some grit to it. Watch out for the <b>heavy</b> <b>breakdown</b> {{in the middle of the}} song. Linkin Park takes you on a sonic roller-coaster ride as they play around with the tempo and ambiance of the song". The song {{continues}} its outro into the next track and the second single, [...] "Until It's Gone", from The Hunting Party.|$|R
