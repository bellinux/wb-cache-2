40|$|Why <b>don</b> <b>t</b> <b>you</b> use MEMS? {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{questions}} posed to navigation systems engineers designing inertial navigation solutions in the modern era. The question stems from a general understanding that great strides have been made in terrestrial MEMS accelerometers and attitude rate sensors in terms of accuracy, mass, and power. Yet, when compared on a unit-to-unit basis, MEMS devices do not provide comparable performance (accuracy) to navigation grade sensors. This paper will propose a paradigm shift where the comparison in performance is between multiple MEMS devices and a single navigation grade sensor. The concept is that systematically, a sufficient number of MEMS sensors may mathematically provide comparable performance to a single navigation grade device and be competitive in terms power and mass allocations when viewed on a systems level. The implication is that both inertial navigation system design and fault detection, identification, and recovery could benefit from a system of MEMS devices in the same way that swarm sensing has benefited Earth observation and astronomy. A survey of the state of the art in inertial sensor accuracy scaled by mass and power will be provided to show the specific error in MEMS and navigation graded devices, a mathematical comparison of multi-unit to single-unit sensor errors will be developed, and preliminary applications to Constellation vehicles will be explored...|$|R
40|$|So {{space is}} supremely hostile, {{but we know}} this. But when we ask what {{is the cost of}} human space missions, we need to {{consider}} as many contingencies as possible. This is important because we want to do more than send people on one-way trips, {{we want to be able}} to bring astronauts back. So if exploration is what really matters and not just pride of nation, then perhaps we should genetically engineer a version of ourselves that can survive the hostile environments of space. We've got cloning. We're inside the genome. Let s just do it. Well in fact, we ve done that already. Yes, we have emissaries of ourselves that survive the hazards of space; they re called robots. <b>You</b> <b>don</b> <b>t</b> have to feed them or bring them back, and they <b>don</b> <b>t</b> complain if <b>you</b> lose them in space. So my concern is if costs turn out to be what they have historically been and the time to execute programs lasts as long as it historically has, then I am not convinced that economic cycles and political cycles will allow such programs to survive if they do not satisfy one of these three criteria. The record of history tells us this, unless somehow you want to believe that we are different today than 6, 000 years of our predecessors...|$|R

40|$|It {{seems that}} the old adage 'It s not what you know, it s who you know' has been firmly turned inside out and upside down. Nowadays, while some people are still one or more tantalising steps removed from having the basic {{information}} they need on agriculture and rural development, {{there is a growing}} feeling that many others have, at first sight, perhaps too much. The emphasis is coming to lie on being able to select what is important from what is less important, and to manage it efficiently. Here, the complex skill of priority setting can help in raising the quality of agricultural information services, from defining user needs to delivery. Over the last three years, CTA has been steadily refining a methodology for the determination of priority themes for agricultural information, and it recently completed a series of six pilot studies at national level. The studies were undertaken in Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Kenya, Mali, Senegal and Zambia. They centred around workshops involving representatives of National Agricultural Systems as well as related non-governmental organisations and rural organisations. As a result, the next phase of this programme will enable other ACP countries to be able to conduct similar exercises, although the issue of their funding remains an item. All in all, a tool is being developed in a participatory and interactive way which will bring about the demise of the other old adage 'You <b>don</b> <b>t</b> know what <b>you</b> want until you know <b>you</b> haven <b>t</b> got it.
