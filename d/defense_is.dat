5|$|Chemical <b>defense</b> <b>is</b> {{important}} in some species, usually being advertised by bright aposematic colours. Some Tenebrionidae use their posture for releasing noxious chemicals to warn off predators. Chemical defences may serve purposes {{other than just}} protection from vertebrates, such as protection {{from a wide range}} of microbes. Some species sequester chemicals from the plants they feed on, incorporating them into their own defenses.|$|E
5|$|DIR, Rapid Intervention Squad of the Romanian Ministry of <b>Defense</b> <b>is</b> {{an elite}} special {{operations}} unit currently {{belonging to the}} Romanian Military Police. It is a special unit inside the military, formed of highly skilled individuals, a very large percentage of its members being champions in martial arts, kickboxing, athletic disciplines and so on. DIR was, until December 2003, top secret.|$|E
5|$|Despite its drawbacks, {{there are}} several {{advantages}} to using the fair catch kick. Because the <b>defense</b> <b>is</b> required to be ten yards beyond the spot of the kick, the kicker can take a running start before kicking {{as opposed to the}} typical two steps taken on regular field goal attempts. Similarly, the kicker does {{not have to worry about}} a low snap because the ball is not snapped. The <b>defense</b> <b>is</b> not able to block the kick, allowing the kicker to give the ball a lower trajectory than usual. The fair catch kick would also be of a shorter distance than a normal field goal attempt from the same spot, because the fair catch kick is taken from the spot of the catch, while a typical field goal is taken seven yards back from the line of scrimmage.|$|E

5|$|Greene is {{recognized}} as one of the most dominant players to ever play in the NFL. He is widely considered one of the greatest defensive linemen in league history. His durability allowed him to play in 181 of a possible 190 games, including a streak of 91 straight to begin his career. The Steel Curtain <b>defense</b> <b>is</b> consistently ranked among the top defensive groups of all time. As of the death of L. C. Greenwood in September 2013, Greene is the last surviving member of the Steel Curtain.|$|E
5|$|It is {{acceptable}} to defend from a violent attack anywhere on the street especially {{when a person is}} attacked with a knife or another deadly weapon. Shooting an unarmed attacker also occurs and becomes sometimes a subject of controversy. In general, each case is investigated in great detail before being eventually dismissed as a legitimate self-defense. The <b>defense</b> <b>is</b> judged according to the subjective and objective perception of the defender {{during the time of the}} imminent or ongoing attack, and not according to the view of persons who are judging it ex post.|$|E
5|$|Mulder {{meets with}} Deep Throat, who {{explains}} that the COS is an artificial intelligence developed by Wilczek, and that the Department of <b>Defense</b> <b>is</b> trying to acquire it. Mulder also meets with Wilczek, who has falsely confessed to Lamana's murder. Mulder convinces Wilczek to develop a computer virus that can destroy the COS. Scully doesn't accept Mulder's belief that the COS is sentient, but later discovers the machine hacking into her computer. She joins Mulder at the Eurisko Building to help him destroy the machine.|$|E
5|$|Plant <b>defenses</b> can <b>be</b> {{classified}} generally as constitutive or induced. Constitutive <b>defenses</b> <b>are</b> {{always present}} in the plant, while induced <b>defenses</b> <b>are</b> produced or mobilized to the site where a plant is injured. There is wide variation in the composition and concentration of constitutive defenses and these range from mechanical defenses to digestibility reducers and toxins. Many external mechanical defenses and large quantitative <b>defenses</b> <b>are</b> constitutive, as they require large amounts of resources to produce and are difficult to mobilize. A variety of molecular and biochemical approaches are {{used to determine the}} mechanism of constitutive and induced plant defenses responses against herbivory.|$|R

Buffalo's run <b>defense</b> <b>was</b> 83rd in the country, allowing 141.1yards per game; their pass <b>defense</b> <b>was</b> ranked 97th, allowing almost 250yards per game. The Bulls allowed other teams to score an average of 27points against them per game, which ranked 73rd in the country.|$|R
5|$|Plant use of {{endophytic}} {{fungi in}} <b>defense</b> <b>is</b> {{a very common}} phenomenon. Most plants have endophytes, microbial organisms that live within them. While some cause disease, others protect plants from herbivores and pathogenic microbes. Endophytes can help the plant by producing toxins harmful to other organisms that would attack the plant, such as alkaloid producing fungi which are common in grasses such as tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea).|$|E
5|$|Although {{there is}} no stand-your-ground law, the fact that {{necessary}} defense (unlike utmost necessity) {{is not subject to}} subsidiarity means that there is also no duty to retreat. The mere fact that a defender uses a weapon against unarmed attacker {{does not mean that the}} <b>defense</b> <b>is</b> disproportionate (and thus not legitimate) to the manner of the attack and the proportionality of defense does not depend on the relative effectiveness of the defender's weapon compared to the intensity of the attack, but on the manner in which the weapon is used (aiming at leg, i.e. intended non-deadly defense, may be proportionate where aiming at chest may be manifestly disproportionate, notwithstanding if the slug hits a leg artery and the attacker bleeds to death).|$|E
5|$|Alvin Plantinga's {{free will}} <b>defense</b> <b>is</b> a logical {{argument}} developed by American analytic philosopher Alvin Plantinga, the John A. O'Brien Professor of Philosophy Emeritus at the University of Notre Dame, {{and published in}} its final version in his 1977 book God, Freedom, and Evil. Plantinga's argument is a defense against the logical problem of evil as formulated by philosopher J. L. Mackie beginning in 1955. Mackie's formulation of the logical problem of evil argued that three attributes of God, omniscience, omnipotence, and omnibenevolence, in orthodox Christian theism are logically incompatible with the existence of evil. In 1982, Mackie conceded that Plantinga's defense successfully refuted his argument in The Miracle of Theism, {{though he did not}} claim that the problem of evil had been put to rest.|$|E

40|$|Predation {{is a major}} {{selective}} force structuring biological {{communities and}} causing the evolution of defenses in many prey organisms. While permanent defenses evolve under constant predation pressure, inducible <b>defenses</b> <b>are</b> adaptations to heterogeneity in predation risk [1] and likely evolved under divergent selection regimes. Costs for the production or maintenance of <b>defenses</b> <b>are</b> saved during times when these <b>defenses</b> <b>are</b> not required. A fascinating aspect {{of the study of}} inducible <b>defenses</b> <b>is</b> that organisms with the same genotype can display drama ti cally different phenotypes in response to par ticular environmental factors that are required for activat ing genes that control the formation of these defenses. The interplay of genes and environment is far from being fully understood, above all since the gene...|$|R

5|$|Chemical <b>defense</b> <b>is</b> another {{important}} defense found among species of Coleoptera and Lepidoptera, usually being advertised by bright colors, {{such as the}} monarch butterfly. They obtain their toxicity by sequestering the chemicals from the plants they eat into their own tissues. Some Lepidoptera manufacture their own toxins. Predators that eat poisonous butterflies and moths may become sick and vomit violently, learning not to eat those types of species; this is actually the basis of Müllerian mimicry. A predator who has previously eaten a poisonous lepidopteran may avoid other species with similar markings in the future, thus saving many other species as well. Some ground beetles of the Carabidae family can spray chemicals from their abdomen with great accuracy, to repel predators.|$|E
5|$|Safeties are {{the least}} common method of scoring in American {{football}} but are not rare occurrences– since 1932, a safety has occurred once every 14.31 games in the National Football League (NFL), or {{about once a week}} under current scheduling rules. On October 21, 1973, Fred Dryer, playing for the Los Angeles Rams against the Green Bay Packers, became the only player in NFL History to score two safeties in a single game. A much rarer occurrence is the one-point safety, which can be scored by the offense on an extra point or two-point conversion attempt; those have occurred at least twice in NCAA Division I football since 1996, most recently at the 2013 Fiesta Bowl. No conversion safeties have occurred since at least 1940 in the NFL. A conversion safety by the <b>defense</b> <b>is</b> also possible, though highly unlikely; although this has never occurred, it is the only possible way a team could finish with a single point in an American football game.|$|E
5|$|The {{first factor}} {{determining}} optimal <b>defense</b> <b>is</b> risk: {{how likely is}} it that a plant or certain plant parts will be attacked? This is also related to the plant apparency hypothesis, which states that a plant will invest heavily in broadly effective defenses when the plant is easily found by herbivores. Examples of apparent plants that produce generalized protections include long-living trees, shrubs, and perennial grasses. Unapparent plants, such as short-lived plants of early successional stages, on the other hand, preferentially invest in small amounts of qualitative toxins that are effective against {{all but the most}} specialized herbivores.|$|E
50|$|The Doomsday <b>Defense</b> <b>was</b> the <b>defense</b> of the Dallas Cowboys American {{football}} team during the dynasty {{years of the}} late 1960s - 1970s.

40|$|Affirmative <b>defenses</b> <b>are</b> an {{important}} part of ITC proceedings. Unlike counterclaims, which are immediately removed to a federal court, affirmative defenses enable the respondents to win their case before the ITC. Importantly, defendants’ failure to assert affirmative defenses results in a judgment in favor of the plaintiff. Relying on the analysis of more than five hundred ITC investigations, this article explains what affirmative <b>defenses</b> <b>are</b> available in ITC proceedings, what <b>defenses</b> <b>are</b> more successful and are easier to prove, and what strategies parties can use to improve their chances of winning...|$|R
5|$|Characters {{have several}} {{different}} stats and gauges: their health (HP), a magic meter stocked by Technical Points (TP), and Learning Points (LP) for learning skills. a character's respective agility or luck, {{and how a}} character reacts to attacks. Attack types are physical and magical, while <b>defense</b> <b>is</b> limited to physical attacks. Characters gain experience levels through accumulating experience points (EXP). EXP and Gald is earned through battles, along with recovering a degree of TP and occasionally items dropped by defeated enemies. Skills, attributes that change different stats, can be assigned to each character. The number of skills that can be assigned is calculated {{by the number of}} skill points each character has available. Battling with equipment associated with a particular skill enables that character to learn it when they have filled their LP meter. Cooking, creating meals with ingredients found in battle or around explored environments, can also be used by individual characters to restore their HP and TP and grant temporary enhancements. Recipes are learned from a character called the Wonder Chef.|$|E
5|$|The {{thrust of}} Stern's <b>defense</b> <b>is</b> that Della Guardia and Molto have framed Rusty {{in order to}} cover up the bribery case. During the {{cross-examination}} of the coroner, it is revealed that Carolyn underwent a tubal ligation, thus having no reason to use the spermicidal contraceptive which was found on her. Stern asserts that the only explanation for this discrepancy is that the fluid sample was not actually taken from Carolyn's body. Based on the disappearance of the beer glass, the lack of motive {{and the fact that the}} fluid sample was rendered meaningless, Judge Lyttle dismisses the charges. Rusty confronts Stern for bringing up the bribery file in the case. Stern swears him to secrecy, revealing that Lyttle had a brief sexual encounter with Carolyn. Stern also confesses that he and Raymond knew that Lyttle was taking bribes, and although Lyttle had offered his resignation, Raymond felt that he was a brilliant judge and deserved another chance. Lipranzer meets with Rusty and reveals the missing beer glass, explaining that he never returned it to evidence when the investigation was turned over to Della Guardia and Molto. Rusty throws it into a river.|$|E
5|$|Each forelimb of {{the horse}} runs from the scapula or {{shoulder}} blade to the navicular bone. In between are the humerus (arm), radius (forearm), elbow joint, ulna (elbow), carpus (knee) bones and joint, large metacarpal (cannon), small metacarpal (splint), sesamoid, fetlock joint, first phalanx (long pastern), pastern joint, second phalanx (short pastern), coffin joint, outwardly evidenced by the coronary band, and the third phalanx (coffin or pedal) bones. Each hind limb {{of the horse}} runs from the pelvis to the navicular bone. After the pelvis come the femur (thigh), patella, stifle joint, tibia, fibula, tarsal (hock) bone and joint, large metatarsal (cannon) and small metatarsal (splint) bones. Below these, the arrangement of sesamoid and phalanx bones and joints {{is the same as}} in the forelimbs. When the horse is moving, the distal interphalangeal joint (coffin joint) has the highest amount of stresses applied to it of any joint in the body, and it can be significantly affected by trimming and shoeing techniques. Although having a small range of movement, the proximal interphalangeal joint (pastern joint) is also influential to the movement of the horse, and can change the way that various shoeing techniques affect tendons and ligaments in the legs. Due to the horse's development as a cursorial animal (one whose main form of <b>defense</b> <b>is</b> running), its bones evolved to facilitate speed in a forward direction over hard ground, without the need for grasping, lifting or swinging. The ulna shrank in size and its top portion became the point of the elbow, while the bottom fused with the radius above the radiocarpal (knee) joint, which corresponds to the wrist in humans. A similar change occurred in the fibula bone of the hind limbs. These changes were first seen in the genus Merychippus, approximately 17 million years ago.|$|E
