5|$|Lysaker Station was {{the closest}} railway station to Oslo Airport, Fornebu. From 27 May 1990, Scandinavian Airlines System and the Norwegian State Railways started a {{cooperation}} to better the connection between rail and airline services. The project included the station being branded as Lysaker/Fornebu and dedicated shuttle buses running from the station to the airport terminal. NSB changed their scheduled so all <b>InterCity</b> <b>Express</b> and long distance trains on the Drammen Line started stopping at Lysaker.|$|E
5|$|First Great Western {{declined}} a {{contractual option}} {{to continue the}} Greater Western passenger franchise (of which services at Nailsea and Backwell are a part) beyond 2013, citing a desire for a longer-term contract due to the impending upgrade to the Great Western Main Line. The franchise was put out to tender, but the process was halted and later scrapped due to {{the fallout from the}} collapse of the InterCity West Coast franchise competition. A two-year franchise extension until September 2015 was agreed in October 2013, and subsequently extended until March 2019. The coming years will see the introduction of new <b>Intercity</b> <b>Express</b> Trains, capacity enhancements and smart ticketing.|$|E

5|$|The {{station was}} {{originally}} named Raastad, and opened {{as part of}} the Vestfold Line on 7December 1881. It was located in the former municipality of Sandar, that was also served by Jåstad Station. Raastad was equipped with a wooden station building designed by Balthazar Lange, and cargo expedition. There was initially only one track, but on 1July 1910, a passing loop was installed at the station, allowing trains to pass. The station was renamed Råstad in April 1921. In 1969–70 the passing loop was extended, but already on 15September 1971 it was disabled, and subsequently removed, with the automation of the signaling. The station became unmanned on 1October 1971 and was closed on 28May 1978. The following day, the new <b>InterCity</b> <b>Express</b> services started on the Vestfold Line.|$|E
5|$|The Class 93 was {{put into}} service {{as part of the}} Agenda {{regional}} train concept. Along with the Class 70 <b>InterCity</b> <b>Express</b> trains in Eastern Norway, the Class 93 would serve the regional services of NSB. Trains were initially put into service in 2000 on the Nordland Line, followed by the Rauma and Røros Line. The trains had several operational problems, some related to humidity, creating situations where the both engines would stop. This caused NSB in 2002 to demand an interior and technical reconfiguration by Bombardier. One year after delivery, six of eleven trains were out of order. To solve the problem, NSB had to rent back used Di3 locomotives from Ofotbanen. NSB had chosen to sell the old locomotives for less than market price, but Ofotbanen demanded that NSB pay the entire purchase price for the short-term rental back. The brand name Agenda failed, since customers were dissatisfied with the new stock, and NSB chose to discontinue the branding, just calling all former Agenda and Signatur trains regional trains.|$|E

25|$|After four decades, {{most of the}} HST fleet {{is still}} in front-line revenue service under privatisation, and while the InterCity 125 brand name is rarely {{mentioned}} officially by the private train operating companies (TOCs), the InterCity 125 still forms the backbone of intercity services on several British main lines. Most sets are to be replaced on InterCity services by 2018 under the <b>Intercity</b> <b>Express</b> Programme. At first, that programme called for some HSTs to continue in use on London to Devon/Cornwall services {{where there are no}} plans to electrify the lines. However, in March 2015 it was announced that the remainder of the Great Western fleet would be replaced with bi-mode <b>Intercity</b> <b>Express</b> sets, equipped with the required powerplants and fuel tanks to tackle the distances and inclines of Westcountry services.|$|E
25|$|Under the <b>Intercity</b> <b>Express</b> Programme (IEP), 21 {{electric}} Class 800 trains {{were ordered}} as replacements for the ageing InterCity 125 diesels.
