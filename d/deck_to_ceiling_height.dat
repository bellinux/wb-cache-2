40|$|Effect of {{obstructions}} on an unconfined ceiling jet {{induced by}} a fire plume {{has been investigated}} using small-scale experimental simulations. Parallel beams placed on a ceiling with the <b>ceiling</b> <b>height</b> varied between 0. 76 to 1. 28 m resulted {{in a range of}} beam depth <b>to</b> <b>ceiling</b> <b>height</b> ratio of 0. 048 to 0. 19. The non-dimensional fire size ranged from 0. 003 to 0. 027, corresponding to a fire size range of 450 kW to 1160 kW for a 3. 5 m ceiling. The results show that the ceiling jet velocity and temperature beyond the obstruction, when normalized by the smooth ceiling jet correlation, can be characterized as a simple function of the ratio of obstruction depth <b>to</b> the <b>ceiling</b> <b>height.</b> The data shows a nearly 80 % reduction in the velocity and temperature of the ceiling jet flowing over an obstruction, when compared with the smooth unconfined case, for a beam depth equal to approximately 15 % of the fire <b>to</b> <b>ceiling</b> <b>height.</b> It is also shown that a nearly corridor flow condition is attained when the obstruction approaches about 20 % of the fire <b>to</b> <b>ceiling</b> <b>height.</b> These drastic changes in the ceiling jet temperature and velocity can result in delayed fire detection when a heat detector is present outside the primary bay.

50|$|The {{headquarters}} for Mitsulift in Lebanon {{was completed in}} 2012 by Raëd Abillama Architects. The design of the building {{had a number of}} unique features, inlacing the exterior, which was designed to reduce the impact of direct sunlight, reducing heat intake. The windows were created at a floor <b>to</b> <b>ceiling</b> <b>height</b> and placed in the shade facing either east or west to maximise natural sunlight, without increasing the heat.|$|R
50|$|Designed by {{architect}} Carlos A. Santos-Viola {{and based}} on the last design conceptualized by Brother Manalo himself, the chapel was the first to be built with a steep gable and an arcaded side facade. It is the second-largest chapel ever built during its time. Its interiors feature the widest nave built during its time and also one of the highest in terms of floor <b>to</b> <b>ceiling</b> <b>height.</b> The overall design was inspired by the Gothic cathedrals of Europe, particularly San Sebastian Church in Manila.|$|R
50|$|Cenote Papak'al is on {{the grounds}} of the hacienda and {{accessed}} near some of the ruins of the hacienda. From the entrance to the cave, there is an underground chamber about 50 meters long and 40 meters wide, with a floor <b>to</b> <b>ceiling</b> <b>height</b> of approximately 20 meters which descends into a pool of clear water.

50|$|The {{first step}} is to decide on an {{appropriate}} air change rate for good air quality. As this air flow rate will be supplied through the dynamically insulated ceiling and a mechanical ventilation and heat recovery system (MVHR), energy loss is not a major concern so 1 air change per hour (ach) will be assumed. If the floor <b>to</b> <b>ceiling</b> <b>height</b> is 2.4 m this implies an air flow rate of 240 m3/h, part of which is supplied through the dynamically insulated ceiling and partly through the MVHR.|$|R

In rooms entirely devoted to the storage of books, such as libraries, they may be permanently fixed to the walls and/or floor.|$|R
50|$|Susanka has {{proposed}} {{an approach to}} housing that values quality over quantity. She outlines a design language for homeowners, builders and architects {{that is based on}} architectural elements such as framed openings (windows, doors or doorways that are framed or nested in certain ways), spatial layering, visual weight, diagonal views, and variations <b>to</b> <b>ceiling</b> <b>height,</b> all of which are intended to let the interior of a house feel comfortable and more spacious. They are tools used to create a subjective feeling of separation and shelteredness, yet interconnection with other parts of the house.|$|R
50|$|The Low Rise section (floors 1 to 12) {{contains}} a 20700 sq ft-floorplate and the Mid Rise section (floors 14 to 22) {{contains a}} 18000 sq ft-floorplate. The highest region, the High Rise (floors 23 to 33), contains a 16000 sq ft-floorplate. The building {{does not have}} a floor numbered thirteen. The floor <b>to</b> <b>ceiling</b> <b>height</b> of the building is 9 ft. To support the office tower, 555 Mission has a steel frame structure. The metal decks and concrete will support the office floors. Enclosing the steel structure is a glass curtain wall that has protruding glass and metal accent fins.|$|R
50|$|There are {{no known}} {{original}} {{drawings of the}} interior, so HRI had a task on their hands. They had to go in, and document {{every aspect of the}} building, including measurements of floor <b>to</b> <b>ceiling</b> <b>heights</b> and mechanical equipment to name just a few. Original plaster ceilings found hidden behind suspended ceilings were discovered. Finally interior demolition began, gutting the interior down to the floor plates, stairwells, and elevator shafts. This included removal of escalators in the lobby, tearing out and replacing all electrical and plumbing. The window frames in the guest rooms were made of cypress and were restored with broken glass replaced.|$|R
40|$|An {{analytical}} {{study using}} an integral model for turbulent flame radial lengths under a ceiling is presented. Dimensionless equations give results {{in terms of}} Q* [...] dimensionless firepower, and D/H [...] the ratio of fire diameter <b>to</b> <b>ceiling</b> <b>height.</b> The model used an empirical relationship for the mixing ratio of air entrained to stoichiometric air needed for the ceiling jet flame. This value varies from 9. 6 for short radial flames to 1 for long flames that tend to become laminar. Predictions from the model are in good agreement with the experimental data from previous work found in the literature. They span a range that contains data where the fire plume flame just touches the <b>ceiling</b> <b>to</b> the case where long ceiling flames become laminar. An alternative empirical fit of the theoretical results finds that the radial flame length is independent of <b>ceiling</b> <b>height</b> once the flame hits the ceiling...|$|R

It comprises two iron frames positioned as far apart as desired to provide a suitable length, with wooden laths, typically four or six, passed through holes in them. The frames are suspended from the ceiling by a system of rope and pulleys. The result is a hoistable rack with several parallel bars on which clothes can be draped {{out of the way}}, or hung, extending further down, with clothes hangers.

40|$|Displacement {{ventilation}} uses air supplied at a temperature, typically around 19 °C for offices, {{which is}} only slightly cooler than the design temperature of the occupied zone. This is a much higher temperature than used for conventional mixed flow ventilation systems and creates opportunities for using fresh-air based “free cooling ” for {{a large proportion of}} the year. Conventional displacement ventilation design practice suggests that the cooling capacity of displacement ventilation in commercial offices with normal floor <b>to</b> <b>ceiling</b> <b>heights</b> (up <b>to</b> 3 m) is limited to around 25 W/m 2. For this reason it is fairly common in the UK <b>to</b> specify chilled <b>ceilings</b> in conjunction with displacement ventilation to meet typical office heat loads. However, recent BRE research has shown that displacement ventilation on its own using appropriate diffusers can deal with heat loads of around 50 - 55 W/m 2 in typical office environments without causing thermal discomfort outside the outflow zone. This opens up the possibility of using fresh-air free cooling for large parts of the year. Displacement compared with mixed flow ventilation Displacement ventilation is essentially a buoyancy driven "displacement " process...|$|R
