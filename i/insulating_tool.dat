40|$|This paper {{presents}} a first study on {{electrical discharge machining}} (EDM) of high aspect ratio (HAR) micro holes (AR > 20) by using <b>tool</b> electrodes <b>insulated</b> on the sidewall. The idea is to stabilize the electrical discharge process for deep drilling by suppressing sparks on the side {{through the application of}} an insulating coating about the tool. Experiments are conducted on a Sarix machine, the performance of standard uncoated electrodes and customized coated tools are compared each other and reviewed against the evaluation criteria of achievable geometrical quality, relative tool wear (θ) and machining time. The first results obtained show significant reductions in tool wear and machining time when using <b>insulated</b> <b>tools.</b> Besides, the actual drilled depth also increases, for a given z axis, because of the reduced tool wear. As an example, a micro hole, 0. 18 mm of diameter and 10 mm deep (AR ~ 55), is obtained with a 0. 13 mm tubular coated electrode, about 40 mm long, within an half hour. status: publishe...|$|R

50|$|In {{addition}} to the workplace hazards generally faced by industrial workers, electricians are also particularly exposed to injury by electricity. An electrician may experience electric shock due to direct contact with energized circuit conductors or due to stray voltage caused by faults in a system. An electric arc exposes eyes and skin to hazardous amounts of heat and light. Faulty switchgear may cause an arc flash incident with a resultant blast. Electricians are trained to work safely and take many measures to minimize the danger of injury. Lockout and tagout procedures are used {{to make sure that}} circuits are proven to be de-energized before work is done. Limits of approach to energized equipment protect against arc flash exposure; specially designed flash-resistant clothing provides additional protection; grounding (earthing) clamps and chains are used on line conductors to provide a visible assurance that a conductor is de-energized. Personal protective equipment provides electrical insulation as well as protection from mechanical impact; gloves have insulating rubber liners, and work boots and hard hats are specially rated to provide protection from shock. If a system cannot be de-energized, <b>insulated</b> <b>tools</b> are used; even high-voltage transmission lines can be repaired while energized, when necessary.|$|R
40|$|The Experiment Control System II (ECS-II) is {{designed}} to make available to the microgravity research community the same tools and mode of automated experimentation that their ground-based counterparts have enjoyed {{for the last two}} decades. The design goal was accomplished by combining commercial automation tools familiar to the experimenter community with system control components that interface with the on-orbit platform in a distributed architecture. The architecture <b>insulates</b> the <b>tools</b> necessary for managing a payload. By using commercial software and hardware components whenever possible, development costs were greatly reduced when compared to traditional space development projects. Using commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) components also improved the usability documentation, and reducing the need for training of the system by providing familiar user interfaces, providing a wealth of readily available documentation, and reducing the need for training on system-specific details. The modularity of the distributed architecture makes it very amenable for modification to different on-orbit experiments requiring robotics-based automation...|$|R
40|$|There is an {{increasing}} demand for nanostructured polymeric surfaces for many scientific and commercial applications including the fields of cell and tissue engineering, where {{the study of the}} ways that cells interact with their environment holds great potential for the future of regenerative medicine. Current replication based fabrication techniques, such as hot embossing, which are used to produce nanostructured surfaces for this type of research are not fast enough {{to keep up with the}} growing demand for them. Injection moulding offers a high throughput alternative to these processes and can upscale the production of nanopatterned samples by several orders of magnitude. However, the nickel moulds traditionally used to injection mould micro- and nanostructures are limited to producing recessed features due to the rate at which the injected polymer cools upon contact with it. In order to replicate raised features (e. g. pillars) the polymer needs enough time to fill the nanoscale cavities of the mould before freezing. A solution to this limitation of nickel tooling is devised and implemented, using a thermally <b>insulating</b> <b>tooling</b> material that facilitates the formation of nanopillars by injection moulding. This tooling material can be patterned by a range of fabrication techniques including photolithography and nanoimprint lithography. The tooling can be used to replicate nanopatterns over underlying micron and millimetre scale topographies. This flexible solution enables the large volume production of samples containing raised poly(carbonate) nanopillars without significantly compromising cycle time. Following this, the technique is adapted in an attempt to replicate high aspect ratio nanostructures. In this section a range of non-adhesive surface coatings are tested for their abilities to enhance the replication process through the systematic analysis of their durability and the replication fidelity that they enable. Nanopillars with aspect ratios of greater than 10 : 1 are successfully produced and are used to fabricate surfaces for cell engineering research. This success is also demonstrative of the technique’s potential to mass produce nanostructures for other applications such as non-reflective and dry adhesive surfaces. Finally, a study is undertaken to replicate microstructures with an elastomeric polymer. The tooling solution is used to assess the minimum feature size that can be replicated with this polymer and how processing parameters and non-adhesive coatings can improve this. This thesis documents the development of a range of enabling techniques which add to the existing toolbox of nanofabrication technologies. They address a growing demand for nanostructured polymeric surfaces in cell and tissue engineering research, whilst remaining open and adaptable to any application that requires the high throughput production of nanopatterned polymeric samples...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} {{experimental and}} numerical results of butt {{friction stir welding}} of high density polyethylene. The FSW designed <b>tool</b> <b>insulates</b> the welded samples and preserves the heat gained from friction thus avoiding the appearance of blisters and splits after welding. The experimental tests, conducted according to combinations of process factors such as rotation speed, welding speed, pin diameter and hold time at beginning welding, were carried out according the Taguchi orthogonal table L 27 in randomized way. Temperatures in the joint during the welding operation and flow stresses from the tensile tests of welded samples were measured and variances were analyzed. Identified models were used to simulate, by finite elements, the tensile tests performed on specimens having a weld cordon in their active area. The results show coherence between the numerical predictions and experimental observations in different cases of weld cordon mechanical behaviour...|$|R

A review of a videotape filmed of the operation indicated that the employee's discomfort was probably related to the low work surface height, the abduction of the right shoulder, and the pronated grip used to hold the grinding tool. In order to improve the employee's posture, the following changes were suggested: 1. Raise the workbench to a height of 36 inches and enable the employee to tilt the work surface forward if desired. 2. Install a foot rail to reduce the static load on the legs 3. Instruct the employee to use a neutral power grip when holding the grinder to reduce the strain on the wrist and elbow tendons. 4. Eliminate the need to hold the right arm in an abducted position. 5. <b>Insulate</b> the grinding <b>tool</b> with <b>insulating</b> material to reduce vibration exposure. 6.
