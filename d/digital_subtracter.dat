5000|$|The {{outermost}} loop, {{the main}} loop, regulates load position. In this example, position feedback {{of the actual}} load position is presented by a Rotary encoder that produces a binary output code. The actual position is compared to the desired position by a <b>digital</b> <b>subtracter</b> that drives a DAC (Digital-to-analog converter) that drives the position control amplifier (KP). Position control allows the servo to compensate for sag and for slight position ripple caused by gears (not shown) between the motor and the telescope ...|$|E
