5|$|A limerick is a {{poem that}} {{consists}} of five lines and is often humorous. Rhythm <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>important</b> <b>in</b> limericks for the first, second and fifth lines must have seven to ten syllables. However, {{the third and fourth}} lines only need five to seven. All of the lines must rhyme and have the same rhythm.|$|E
5|$|Olfactory {{communication}} <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>important</b> <b>in</b> this species. It has {{roles in}} alerting {{others of the}} identity, physical state and position of the individual. It is also important in reproduction. Like other slow lorises, the Sunda slow loris has glands on its elbows that exude oils. The gland is licked to spread scent and {{is thought to have}} evolved for communication, but it is toxic to humans. If the person is allergic to the animal they can go into shock and could even die. It also has glands on its anus and can signal conspecifics by perineal rubbing which deposits urine. When it locates the scent of another slow loris it may rub its face on the substrate where the scent was found.|$|E
5|$|Silver <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>important</b> <b>in</b> {{electronics}} for conductors and electrodes {{on account}} of its high electrical conductivity even when tarnished. Bulk silver and silver foils were used to make vacuum tubes, {{and continue to be}} used today in the manufacture of semiconductor devices, circuits, and their components. For example, silver is used in high quality connectors for RF, VHF, and higher frequencies, particularly in tuned circuits such as cavity filters where conductors cannot be scaled by more than 6%. Printed circuits and RFID antennas are made with silver paints, Powdered silver and its alloys are used in paste preparations for conductor layers and electrodes, ceramic capacitors, and other ceramic components.|$|E

5|$|The three group 12 {{elements}} that occur naturally are zinc, cadmium and mercury. They are all {{widely used in}} electric and electronic applications, {{as well as in}} various alloys. The first two members of the group share similar properties as they are solid metals under standard conditions. Mercury is the only metal that is a liquid at room temperature. While zinc <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>important</b> <b>in</b> the biochemistry of living organisms, cadmium and mercury are both highly toxic. As copernicium does not occur in nature, it has to be synthesized in the laboratory.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there is}} some debate within Islam over {{whether it is a}} {{religious}} requirement, circumcision (called khitan) is practiced nearly universally by Muslim males. Islam bases its practice of circumcision on the Genesis 17 narrative, the same Biblical chapter referred to by Jews. The procedure is not explicitly mentioned in the Quran, however, it is a tradition established by Islam's prophet Muhammad directly (following Abraham), and so its practice is considered a sunnah (prophet's tradition) and <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>important</b> <b>in</b> Islam. For Muslims, circumcision is also a matter of cleanliness, purification and control over one's baser self (nafs). There is no agreement across the many Islamic communities about the age at which circumcision should be performed. It may be done from soon after birth up to about age 15; most often it is performed at around six to seven years of age. The timing can correspond with the boy's completion of his recitation of the whole Quran, with a coming-of-age event such as taking on the responsibility of daily prayer or betrothal. Circumcision may be celebrated with an associated family or community event. Circumcision is recommended for, but is not required of, converts to Islam.|$|E
