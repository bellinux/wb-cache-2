When digital circuits switch state, large current pulses flow from the active devices (transistors or integrated circuits) through the <b>ground</b> <b>circuit.</b> If the power supply and ground traces have significant impedance, the voltage drop across them may create noise voltage pulses that disturb {{other parts of the}} circuit (ground bounce). The large conducting area of the ground plane has much lower impedance than a circuit trace, so the current pulses cause less disturbance.|$|E

40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} a driven <b>ground</b> electrical <b>circuit.</b> A driven <b>ground</b> is a current-measuring ground termination to an electrical circuit {{with the current}} measured as a vector with amplification. The driven ground module may include an electric potential source V. sub. S driving an electric current through an impedance (load Z) to a driven ground. Voltage from the source V. sub. S excites the minus terminal of an operational amplifier inside the driven ground which, in turn, may react by generating an equal and opposite voltage to drive the net potential to approximately zero (effectively ground). A driven ground {{may also be a}} means of passing information via the current passing through one <b>grounded</b> <b>circuit</b> to another electronic circuit as input. It may <b>ground</b> one <b>circuit,</b> amplify the information carried in its current and pass this information on as input to the next circuit...|$|R
5000|$|An active virtual <b>ground</b> <b>circuit</b> is {{sometimes}} called a rail splitter. Such a circuit uses an op-amp or some other circuit element that has gain. Since an operational amplifier has very high open-loop gain, the potential difference between its inputs tend to zero when a feedback network is implemented. This means that the output supplies the inverting input (via the feedback network) with enough voltage to reduce the potential difference between the inputs to microvolts. More precisely, it can be shown that the output voltage of the amplifier in the figure is approximately equal to [...] Thus, {{as far as the}} amplifier is working in its linear region (output not saturated, frequencies inside the range of the opamp), the voltage at the output terminal remains constant with respect to the real ground, and independent from the loads to which it may be connected. This property characterize a [...] "virtual ground".|$|E
50|$|The {{simplest}} non-ideal {{current source}} {{consists of a}} voltage source in series with a resistor. The amount of current available from such a source is given by {{the ratio of the}} voltage across the voltage source to the resistance of the resistor (Ohm's law; I = V/R). This value of current will only be delivered to a load with zero voltage drop across its terminals (a short circuit, an uncharged capacitor, a charged inductor, a virtual <b>ground</b> <b>circuit,</b> etc.) The current delivered to a load with nonzero voltage (drop) across its terminals (a linear or nonlinear resistor with a finite resistance, a charged capacitor, an uncharged inductor, a voltage source, etc.) will always be different. It is given by the ratio of the voltage drop across the resistor (the difference between the exciting voltage and the voltage across the load) to its resistance. For a nearly ideal current source, the value of the resistor should be very large but this implies that, for a specified current, the voltage source must be very large (in the limit as the resistance and the voltage go to infinity, the current source will become ideal and the current will not depend at all on the voltage across the load). Thus, efficiency is low (due to power loss in the resistor) and it is usually impractical to construct a 'good' current source this way. Nonetheless, it is often the case that such a circuit will provide adequate performance when the specified current and load resistance are small. For example, a 5 V voltage source in series with a 4.7 kilohm resistor will provide an approximately constant current of 1 mA Â± 5% to a load resistance in the range of 50 to 450 ohm.|$|E

The phenomenon of line to ground cable charging current (Ilg) during drive switching is a main component of zero sequence current and is discussed with basic equations describing its magnitude. Results of a high frequency characterization study of all components in the zero sequence path was required to obtain estimates of surge impedance for these equations.

The location error by using this ratio depends on the fault resistance and the value of the capacitance to ground of the stator winding. However, the error added by ignoring the value of the fault resistance is the most relevant term.

40|$|Electrical {{grounding}} {{is probably}} the most over-looke~ ignored, and misunderstood part of electrical energy source circuits. A faulty <b>ground</b> <b>circuit</b> am have lethal potential to the worker, can damage electrical equipment" or components, and can lead to higher consequences. For example, if the green-wire ground return circuit (in a three-wire power circuit) is fhulty or is open (someone cut the prong, etc.) a person can receive an electrical shock by touching the conductive enclosure, and the result can be lethal. If high explosives are involved m the process, sneak electrical energy paths may cause electrical threats that lead to ignition, which results to higher damage consequences. Proper electrical grounding is essential to mitigate the electrical hazard and improve work place safety. A designer must ask the question, "What grounding is proper?" continuously through a process design and in its application. This question must be readdressed with any process change, including tiom layout, equipment, or procedure changes. Electrical grounding varies ilom local work area grounding to the multi-point grounding found in large industrial areas. These grounding methods become more complex when the designer adds bonding to the grounding schemes to mitigate electrostatic discharge (ESD) and surfkce potentials resulting from lightning currents flowing through the facility structure. Figure 1 shows a typical facility power distribution circuit and the current flow paths resulting ffom a lightning discharge to a facility. This paper discusses electrical grounding methods and their characteristics and identifies potential sneak paths into a process for hazardous electrical energy...|$|E
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this Master's Thesis has been to analyze the systems for thermal energy supply at the ZEB Living Lab, at NTNU, Trondheim. The 102 m^ 2 single-family house is {{designed}} and built {{in accordance with the}} Norwegian passive house standard, as a Zero Emission Building. Efficient utilization of on-site renewable heat sources, such as ground and solar heat, are thus essential means to reach this ambitious goal. The thermal energy supply system comprises a 3. 2 kW ground-source heat pump unit, 4. 2 m^ 2 of south faÃ§ade-mounted solar panels, a 400 l integrated water tank, including two 3. 0 kW back-up heaters, and an hydronic heat distribution system. A combination of theoretical and experimental approaches have been applied in the analyze. Thermal energy and power demands from SIMIEN simulations, resulted in a heat pump power coverage factor of 54 %, at 0 / 35 Â°C. Energy coverage factors were 70 % and 85 %, with and without DHW heat supply. Corresponding SPF values were 2. 56 and 3. 52. Polysun simulations of the solar thermal system gave an annual solar fraction of 0. 37, and a value of 0. 6 for DHW heating during the summertime. Results and observations from measurements have revealed a potential for improvement of system operating strategies, performance, design and dimensioning. The heat pump system is designed for alternate operation between space and DHW heating, but is currently incapable of the latter. Direct-acting electricity is thus an important heat producer in the system. The solar thermal system is designed for combined space and DHW heating, but is operated too intermittently to provide significant heat input. Low-temperature solar heating is furthermore prioritized by the integrated water tank, which restricts the potential for high-temperature DHW heating during the summer. Field measurements have shown a significant electric power consumption for operation of pumps. The electric power input to the <b>ground</b> <b>circuit</b> pump, for instance, corresponded to 15 % of the power input to the heat pump compressor. This contributed to a 13. 5 % reduction in the heat pump system COP. Replacement of the brine solution is one of the suggested measures to redeem this deficiency. In order to obtain the energy savings necessary to reach the ZEB goal, it is essential that the electric energy input to pumps and electric heaters is minimized. Meanwhile, the operating time for the heat pump unit and solar thermal system has to be extended. It is also essential that the measuring equipment is fully functional, so that the system energy performance can be documented...|$|E
