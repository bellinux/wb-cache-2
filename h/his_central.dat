5|$|In late 1928, Auden left Britain {{for nine}} months, going to Berlin, partly to rebel against English repressiveness. In Berlin, he first {{experienced}} {{the political and}} economic unrest that became one of <b>his</b> <b>central</b> subjects.|$|E
5|$|According to Lee, she {{received}} a frantic call on June 21, 2009, from an aide on Jackson's staff. The aide reported that Jackson was feeling ill. Lee reported overhearing Jackson complain that {{one side of his}} body was hot, the other side cold. She believed that somebody had given him something that affected <b>his</b> <b>central</b> nervous system. She advised the aide {{to take him to the}} hospital.|$|E
5|$|Acting {{also plays}} a key role in Szabó’s films, as he values {{psychological}} complexity in <b>his</b> <b>central</b> characters. In his first several features, he tended to use the same lead actors over and over—first András Bálint, then Klaus Maria Brandauer. Consistent with this focus on acting, he frequently employs long close-up shots to emphasize the play of emotions on the faces of his characters.|$|E

5|$|In A Theory of Content and Other Essays (1990), Fodor {{takes up}} another of <b>his</b> <b>central</b> notions: the {{question}} of the reality of mental representations. Fodor needs to justify representational realism to justify the idea that the contents of mental states are expressed in symbolic structures such as those of the LOT.|$|E
5|$|In December 1933, Marquis {{began his}} last book, Keep the Last Bullet for Yourself: The True Story of Custer's Last Stand. Marquis {{considered}} this {{his most important}} work– the subject was <b>his</b> <b>central</b> interest and he regarded much of his previous work as mere preparation for it. The book was completed in March 1934. However, his publisher, the Midwest Company, {{went out of business}} shortly afterwards.|$|E
5|$|In the 1970s, Wheeler became {{increasingly}} forgetful {{and came to}} rely largely on his assistant, Molly Myres, to organise his affairs. Amid increasing ill health, in September 1973 he moved full-time into Myres's house in Leatherhead, Surrey, although he continued to use <b>his</b> <b>central</b> London flat during day-trips to the city. There, he authored a final book, My Archaeological Mission to India and Pakistan, {{although much of the}} text was culled from his previous publications; it was published by Thames and Hudson in 1976. After suffering a stroke, Wheeler died at Myers' home on 22 July 1976. In memoriam, the British Academy, Royal Academy, and Royal Society flew their flags at half-mast. Wheeler's funeral was held with full military honours at a local crematorium, while a larger memorial service was held in St James's Church, Piccadilly in November.|$|E

5|$|Realizing {{the danger}} of his position, Mack decided {{to go on the}} offensive. On 8 October he {{commanded}} the army to concentrate around Günzburg and hoped to strike at Napoleon's lines of communication. Mack instructed Kienmayer to draw Napoleon further east towards Munich and Augsburg. Napoleon did not seriously consider the possibility that Mack would cross the Danube and move away from <b>his</b> <b>central</b> base, but he did realize that seizing the bridges at Günzburg would yield a large strategic advantage. To accomplish this objective, Napoleon sent Ney's Corps to Günzburg, completely unaware that the bulk of the Austrian army was heading to the same destination. On 8 October, however, the campaign witnessed its first serious battle at Wertingen between Auffenburg's troops and those of Murat and Lannes.|$|E
5|$|Robert Ferrers, Earl of Derby, was {{singled out}} in {{particular}} for <b>his</b> <b>central</b> {{involvement in the}} rebellion, and for him the multiple was seven rather than five. The same {{was the case for}} Henry de Hastings, who was the commander of Kenilworth Castle. Those who had not taken part in the fighting themselves, but had incited others to rise up against the king, were fined at two years' value, while those who had been compelled to fight, or played only a minor part, had to pay one year's value of their land. The proceedings from the fines were awarded to royal supporters, some of whom had already been awarded parts of the rebels' land, and now had to give it back.|$|E
5|$|The {{new party}} {{was a direct}} {{challenge}} to Kenyatta'a rule, and soon after its creation the Kenyan Parliament amended the constitution {{to ensure that the}} defectors—who had originally been elected on the KANU ticket—could not automatically retain their seats and would have to stand for re-election. This resulted in the election of June 1966. The Luo increasingly rallied around the KPU, which experienced localized violence that hindered its ability to campaign, although Kenyatta's government officially disavowed this violence. Of the 29 defectors, only 9 were re-elected on the KPU ticket; Odinga was among them, having retained <b>his</b> <b>Central</b> Nyanza seat with a high majority. Odinga was replaced as Vice President by Joseph Murumbi, who in turn would be replaced by Moi.|$|E

5|$|Vice Admiral Scheer became Commander {{in chief}} of the High Seas Fleet on 18 January 1916 when Pohl became too ill to {{continue}} in that post. Upon promotion to the position, Scheer wrote Guiding Principles for Sea Warfare in the North Sea, which outlined his strategic plans. <b>His</b> <b>central</b> idea was that the Grand Fleet should be pressured by higher U-boat activity and zeppelin raids as well as increased fleet sorties. The Grand Fleet would be forced to abandon the distant blockade and would have to attack the German fleet; the Kaiser approved the memorandum on 23 February 1916. Now that he had approval from the Kaiser, Scheer could use the fleet more aggressively.|$|E
5|$|In {{a series}} of {{published}} and unpublished studies in the 1930s, Whorf argued that Mayan writing was to some extent phonetic. While his work on deciphering the Maya script gained some support from Alfred Tozzer at Harvard, the main authority on Ancient Maya culture, J.E.S. Thompson, strongly rejected Whorf's ideas, saying that Mayan writing lacked a phonetic component and is therefore impossible to decipher based on a linguistic analysis. Whorf {{argued that it was}} exactly the reluctance to apply linguistic analysis of Maya languages that had held the decipherment back. Whorf sought for cues to phonetic values within the elements of the specific signs, and never realized that the system was logo-syllabic. Although Whorf's approach to understanding the Maya script is now known to have been misguided, <b>his</b> <b>central</b> claim that the script was phonetic and should be deciphered as such was vindicated by Yuri Knorozov's syllabic decipherment of Mayan writing in the 1950s.|$|E
