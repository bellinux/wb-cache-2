25|$|The {{elephant}} is {{the only}} mammal known to have no pleural space. Rather, the parietal and visceral pleura are both composed of dense connective tissue and joined to each other via loose connective tissue.

25|$|He {{is a man}} magnificently at home in nature, a virtuoso of pre-Christian innocence, {{almost a}} Portuguese teacher of Zen. Reis is a stoic Horatian, a pagan believer in fate, a player with {{classical}} myths less original than Caeiro, but more representative of modern symbolism. De Campos <b>emerges</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> Whitmanesque futurist, a dreamer in drunkenness, the Dionysian singer of what is oceanic and windswept in Lisbon. None of this triad resembles the metaphysical solitude, {{the sense of being}} an occultist medium which characterise Pessoa's 'own' intimate verse.|$|E
25|$|Similarly, {{interactions}} between extraversion, neuroticism, and conscientiousness have demonstrated significant impacts on subjective-well being. In one study, researchers used three scale to assess subjective well-being. They found that extraversion only {{served as a}} predictor for one assessment, in conjunction with neuroticism, while the other two assessment outcomes were better predicted by conscientiousness and neuroticism. In addition {{to the importance of}} including other factors in happiness assessments, this study also demonstrates the manner in which an operational definition of well-being changes whether extraversion <b>emerges</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> salient predictive factor.|$|E

About Hidde Halbertsma, the father, much less is known. It is thought that he might have been a mariner before his marriage. He is described as a gentle soul, who was, however, apt to take offence, and could be quite sharp-tongued in such cases.|$|E
25|$|The Vanessa indica is not {{reported}} as a pest on any crop but on ramie it causes considerable damage by feeding on young tender leaves which affect {{the growth of}} the plant. The larvae of this insect feed on tender young leaves as shown in the picture. The adults lay the eggs on tender leaves in which larvae emerge and feeds on young tender leaves preferably at neck region of the leaves, due to this leaves look like the hanging like position and latter get dry. The caterpillar feeds on young leaves and later fold the leaves {{in such a way that}} both the margins are attached by a silky web and pupation takes place inside the folded leaf.

25|$|Cotton mills get {{the cotton}} shipped {{to them in}} large, 500 pound bales. When the cotton {{comes out of a}} bale, it is all packed {{together}} and still contains vegetable matter. The bale is broken open using a machine with large spikes. It is called an Opener. In order to fluff up the cotton and remove the vegetable matter, the cotton is sent through a picker, or similar machines. The cotton is fed into a machine known as a picker, and gets beaten with a beater bar in order to loosen it up. It is fed through various rollers, which serve to remove the vegetable matter. The cotton, aided by fans, then collects on a screen and gets fed through more rollers till it <b>emerges</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> continuous soft fleecy sheet, known as a lap.|$|E

25|$|Ruerdtsje Binnerts was a {{scion of}} a {{prominent}} family in Grou. Her people were Mennonites, and although {{her husband had been}} raised a Calvinist, he converted after marrying her. From Justus' letters Ruerdtsje <b>emerges</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> smart businesswoman, a loving mother, and a deeply religious person. About Hidde Halbertsma, the father, much less is known. It is thought that he might have been a mariner before his marriage. He is described as a gentle soul, who was, however, apt to take offence, and could be quite sharp-tongued in such cases. In 1784, he published a long Dutch-language poem under the title Schrikkelijke IJsgang en Overstroominge in Gelderland ("Terrible Ice-drift and Flooding in Gelderland"). From this intriguing work it is clear that his sons' literary talents were a family trait.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} to Galligan, {{many of the}} supporting actors and actresses were better known. Veteran actor Glynn Turman portrayed the high school science teacher whose study of a newborn Mogwai leads to his death after it forms a cocoon and <b>emerges</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> vicious gremlin. Dick Miller, who was a regular in Dante's films, was another experienced actor on the set, playing a World War II veteran who first refers to the creatures as gremlins. Rand was played by Hoyt Axton, who was always the filmmakers' preferred choice for the role {{even though it was}} widely contested by other actors. Axton's experience included acting as the father in The Black Stallion (1979), and he was also a country music singer-songwriter. After an introductory scene to Gremlins was cut, Axton's voice earned him the added role of the narrator to establish some context. Mr. Wing was played by Keye Luke, a renowned film actor, whose film career spanned half a century. Although in reality he was around 80 at the time of filming, and his character was very elderly, Luke's youthful appearance had to be covered by make-up.|$|E
25|$|In {{the issues}} of Green Lantern and Green Lantern Corps serving as preludes to the Blackest Night event, the Star Sapphires {{continue}} to make preparations for the predicted conflict. After undergoing treatment within a violet conversion crystal, Fatality <b>emerges</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> newly transformed Star Sapphire. Her first thoughts upon being released are to seek out John Stewart (a Green Lantern she'd been trying to kill for causing the destruction of her home planet). Upon finding him, however, she saves him from Agent Orange's attacking Orange Lantern constructs, demonstrating that {{they are unable to}} absorb constructs made from violet light. She admits that revenge is no longer her goal, and that she has other plans. In the following issue, she reveals that she's attracted to Stewart, may have always been, and the Star Sapphire has given her the ability to finally absolve herself of her survivor's guilt. After Fatality's successful conversion, Miri and Queen Aga'po observe that Kryb appears to be crying inside of her crystal (seemingly distraught over being separated from the children she kept imprisoned on her back). Queen Aga'po remarks that it is a sign the treatment is working.|$|E

25|$|As a writer, Halbertsma {{strongly}} sensed {{what the}} public needed, {{but at the same}} time he was a somewhat distant and cerebral author, which tended to have an averse effect on his poetry, especially compared to the poems of his brother Eeltsje, who was a much more emotional writer. Nevertheless, at least some of Halbertsma's poems, for instance Sibbel fan De Ryp ("Sibbel from De Ryp") and Nacht ("Night") have made a lasting impression. That said, Halbertsma's short stories were much more acute thanks to his limber use of language, his lively style of writing, and the fact that he refused to mince his words, leading to a rough, scoffing, and sometimes darkly grim atmosphere. His subject-matter Halbertsma collected from various sources, including German and French oral literature, which he matchlessly revised and placed in Friesland. He was a non-conformist, whose sharp judgments of the works of others made him far from universally loved. Before everything else, Halbertsma as a writer was an essayist and a satirist, who liked to include topical political and social questions in his literary works. From the anecdotes of people who knew or met him, he <b>emerges</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> sharp-witted and extremely diligent man of capacious erudition who was a droll story-teller.|$|E
500|$|The spores remain dormant {{inside the}} {{sporocarp}} through unfavorable conditions, but when conditions are suitable and wet, the sporocarp will germinate. [...] It splits into halves, allowing the tissue coiled inside to become hydrated. [...] As this internal tissue swells with water, it pushes the {{halves of the}} hard outer covering apart, and <b>emerges</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> long gelatinous worm-like sorophore. [...] The sorophore is a sorus-bearing structure unique to the Marsileaceae; it may extend to more than ten times {{the length of the}} sporocarp inside which it was coiled. [...] This extension carries the numerous spore-producing sori attached along each side of the sorophore out into the water.|$|E

With the exception of Double Dhamaal, none of these films performed well. In a review for Rascals, the critic Gaurav Malani wrote: [...] "Kangana Ranaut is ill at ease in comedy. She struggles to hold her own and <b>emerges</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> bimbo in her act." [...] Ranaut later said that she did some of these films due to a dearth of film offers. The following year, Ranaut portrayed a supporting role opposite Ajay Devgn in Priyadarshan's action thriller Tezz, another box office flop.|$|E
