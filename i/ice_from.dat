50|$|Deicing fluids {{containing}} thickeners (Types II, III, and IV) {{are also}} known as anti-icing fluids, because they are used primarily to prevent <b>icing</b> <b>from</b> re-occurring after an initial deicing with a Type I fluid.|$|R
40|$|The {{desorption}} {{of molecular}} <b>ices</b> <b>from</b> grain surfaces {{is important in}} a number of astrophysical environments including dense molecular clouds, cometary nuclei and the surfaces and atmospheres of some planets. With this in mind, we have performed a detailed investigation of the desorption of pure water, pure methanol and pure ammonia <b>ices</b> <b>from</b> a model dust-grain surface. We have used these results to determine the desorption energy, order of desorption and the pre-exponential factor for the desorption of these molecular <b>ices</b> <b>from</b> our model surface. We find good agreement between our desorption energies and those determined previously; however, our values for the desorption orders, and hence also the pre-exponential factors, are different to those reported previously. The kinetic parameters derived from our data have been used to model desorption on time-scales relevant to astrophysical processes and to calculate molecular residence times, given in terms of population half-life as a function of temperature. These results show the importance of laboratory data for the understanding of astronomical situations whereby icy mantles are warmed by nearby stars and by other dynamical events...|$|R
5|$|The {{first time}} a {{prisoner}} tried {{to escape from the}} Bain was in 1993, when a 38-year-old prisoner was able to escape while {{he was supposed to be}} cleaning <b>ice</b> <b>from</b> the parking lot in front of the ship. The guard who was responsible for the inmate was suspended without pay due to the incident.|$|E
5|$|The ice trade {{began in}} 1806 {{as the result}} of the efforts of Frederic Tudor, a New England entrepreneur, to export ice on a {{commercial}} basis. In New England, ice was an expensive product, consumed only by the wealthy who could afford their own ice houses. Nonetheless, icehouses were relatively common amongst the wealthier members of society by 1800, filled with ice cut, or harvested, from the frozen surface of ponds and streams on their local estates during the winter months. Around the neighbouring New York City area, the hot summers and rapidly growing economy had begun to increase local demand for ice towards the end of the 18th century, creating a small-scale market amongst farmers who sold <b>ice</b> <b>from</b> their ponds and streams to local city institutions and families. Some ships occasionally transported <b>ice</b> <b>from</b> New York and Philadelphia for sale to the southern U.S. states, in particular Charleston in South Carolina, laying it down as ballast on the trip.|$|E
5|$|The {{surface of}} Metis is heavily cratered, dark, {{and appears to}} be reddish in color. There is a {{substantial}} asymmetry between leading and trailing hemispheres: the leading hemisphere is 1.3 times brighter than the trailing one. The asymmetry is probably caused by the higher velocity and frequency of impacts on the leading hemisphere, which excavate a bright material (presumably <b>ice)</b> <b>from</b> its interior.|$|E

40|$|The {{importance}} of ices {{on the evolution}} of interstellar space is widely recognized. Some studies, both experimental and theoretical, have been carried out on the condensation of <b>ices</b> <b>from</b> the interstellar gas. However, phase relation of multi-component ices have not be investigated. We have been performing condensation experiment of <b>ices</b> <b>from</b> the gas of interstellar composition analog at temperatures between 10 and 150 K. The structure and chemical composition of the ices are analyzed as a function of condensation temperature by mass spectrometry and X-ray diffraction, respectively. Amorphous-crystal transition of the ices except for H 2 O ices are also investigated. The result of the experiment will be presented...|$|R
5|$|A Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution {{study in}} January 2009 found that emperor {{penguins}} could be {{pushed to the}} brink of extinction by the year 2100 due to global climate change. The study constructed a mathematical model to predict how the loss of sea <b>ice</b> <b>from</b> climate warming would affect a big colony of emperor penguins at Terre Adélie, Antarctica. The study forecasted an 87% decline in the colony's population, from three thousand breeding pairs in 2009 to four hundred breeding pairs in 2100.|$|E
5|$|Aircraft {{themselves}} {{now have}} more sophisticated deicing systems {{that can be}} used on the ground and in the air. Many modern civil fixed wing transport aircraft, for example the Boeing 737, use anti-ice systems on the leading edge of wings, engine inlets and air data probes using warm air. This is bled from engines and is ducted into a cavity beneath the surface to be anti-iced. The warm air heats the surface up to a few degrees above freezing, preventing <b>ice</b> <b>from</b> forming. The system may operate autonomously, switching on and off as the aircraft enters and leaves icing conditions.|$|E
5|$|Barges {{were also}} used to {{transport}} ice, particularly along the Hudson River, doubling on occasion as storage units as well. These barges could carry between 400 and 800 tons (400,000 to 800,000kg) of ice and, like ice carrying ships, windmills were typically installed to power the barge's bilge pumps. Barges were believed to help preserve <b>ice</b> <b>from</b> melting, as the ice was stored beneath the deck and insulated by the river. Charlie Morse introduced larger, seagoing ice barges in the 1890s in order to supply New York; these were pulled by schooners and could each carry up to 3,000 tons (three million kg) of ice.|$|E
40|$|The rich {{chemistry}} often {{detected in}} star forming regions is now recognized to be {{a consequence of}} solid-state astrochemistry and the thermal desorption of its products. In recent experimental studies, desorption {{of a range of}} <b>ices</b> <b>from</b> a gold surface was investigated using temperature programmed desorption (TPD). These data were then used in astrochemical models. In this paper we investigate the sensitivity of these models to the inclusion of TPD data obtained from different surfaces (simulating different dust grains) and different thicknesses of the icy mantles. Detailed laboratory TPD studies of the desorption of <b>ices</b> <b>from</b> a highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) surface have been performed. Desorption temperatures and kinetic parameters have been determined directly from the TPD data and have been used to determine the expected desorption temperature for the <b>ices</b> <b>from</b> grain surfaces. The results of these experiments have been incorporated into astrochemical models of high mass star forming regions and have then been compared with the results of previous experiments. From this comparison, we are able to determine whether the nature and composition of the grain surface is important in dictating the chemistry that occurs in star forming regions...|$|R
50|$|Royal icing {{is a hard}} white <b>icing,</b> made <b>from</b> softly beaten egg whites, {{icing sugar}} (powdered sugar), and {{sometimes}} lemon or lime juice. It is used to decorate Christmas cakes, wedding cakes, gingerbread houses and many other cakes and cookies. It is used either as a smooth covering or in sharp peaks. Glycerine is often added to prevent the <b>icing</b> <b>from</b> setting too hard. When placing icing on cakes, Marzipan is usually used under the royal icing {{in order to prevent}} discoloration of the icing.|$|R

5|$|Callisto {{has a very}} tenuous {{atmosphere}} {{composed of}} carbon dioxide. It was detected by the Galileo Near Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (NIMS) from its absorption feature near the wavelength 4.2micrometers. The surface pressure {{is estimated to be}} 7.5 bar (0.75 µPa) and particle density 4cm3. Because such a thin atmosphere would be lost in only about 4days (see atmospheric escape), it must be constantly replenished, possibly by slow sublimation of carbon dioxide <b>ice</b> <b>from</b> Callisto's icy crust, which would be compatible with the sublimation–degradation hypothesis for the formation of the surface knobs.|$|E
5|$|De-icers spray heated {{de-icing}} fluid, often {{propylene glycol}} or ethylene glycol, onto icy surfaces {{such as the}} bodies of aircraft and road surfaces. These prevent <b>ice</b> <b>from</b> forming {{on the body of}} the aircraft while on the ground. Ice makes the surface of the wings rougher, reducing the amount of lift they provide while increasing drag. The ice also increases the weight of the aircraft and can affect its balance.|$|E
5|$|In {{order for}} natural ice {{to reach its}} customers, {{it had to be}} {{harvested}} from ponds and rivers, then transported and stored at various sites before finally being used in domestic or commercial applications. Throughout these processes, traders faced the problem of keeping the <b>ice</b> <b>from</b> melting; melted ice represented waste and lost profits. In the 1820s and 1830s only 10 percent of ice harvested was eventually sold to the end user due to wastage en route. By the end of the 19th century, however, the wastage in the ice trade was reduced to between 20 and 50 percent, depending on the efficiency of the company.|$|E

5|$|Kulwicki {{died in an}} {{airplane}} crash on Thursday April 1, 1993. He was returning from an appearance at the Knoxville Hooters in a Hooters corporate plane on a short flight across Tennessee before the Sunday spring race at Bristol. The plane slowed and crashed just before final approach at Tri-Cities Regional Airport near Blountville. The National Transportation Safety Board attributed the crash to the pilot's failure to use the airplane's anti-ice system to clear <b>ice</b> <b>from</b> the engine inlet system.|$|E
5|$|Melting of {{floating}} ice shelves (ice that originated on the land) {{does not in}} itself contribute much to sea-level rise (since the ice displaces only its own mass of water). However it is the outflow of the <b>ice</b> <b>from</b> the land to form the ice shelf which causes a rise in global sea level. This effect is offset by snow falling back onto the continent. Recent decades have witnessed several dramatic collapses of large ice shelves around the coast of Antarctica, especially along the Antarctic Peninsula. Concerns have been raised that disruption of ice shelves may result in increased glacial outflow from the continental ice mass.|$|E
5|$|On the {{continent}} itself, the {{large volume of}} ice present stores around 70% of the world's fresh water. This ice sheet is constantly gaining <b>ice</b> <b>from</b> snowfall and losing ice through outflow to the sea. Overall, the net change is slightly positive at approximately 82 gigatonnes (Gt) per year (with significant regional variation), reducing global sea-level rise by 0.23 mm per year. However, NASA's Climate Change website indicates an overall trend of greater than 100 gigatonnes of ice loss per year since 2002.|$|E

5|$|Reading Peak {{formed a}} second center from which ice moved north into Hat Creek and Summit Creek. Ice moving southward united {{with some of}} the above glaciers and emptied into Warner Valley. On the central plateau, the ridge {{connecting}} Hat Mountain with Crater Butte served as a divide between ice flowing northward to Badger Flat and Hat Creek and that moving southward to Corral Meadows, Kings Creek and Warner Valley. <b>Ice</b> <b>from</b> Mt. Harkness and Sifford Mountain also wound up in Warner Valley.|$|E
5|$|Spots {{were found}} to {{correspond}} to three Galilean moons: Io, Europa and Ganymede. They develop because the co-rotation of the plasma is slowed {{in the vicinity of}} moons. The brightest spot belongs to Io, which is the main source of the plasma in the magnetosphere (see above). The Ionian auroral spot is thought to be related to Alfvén currents flowing from the Jovian to Ionian ionosphere. Europa's and Ganymede's spots are much dimmer, because these moons are weak plasma sources, because of sublimation of the water <b>ice</b> <b>from</b> their surfaces.|$|E
