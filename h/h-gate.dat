25|$|Semiconductor sub-micrometer and {{nanometer}} {{electronic circuits}} {{are the primary}} concern for operating within the normal tolerance in harsh radiation environments like outer space. One of the design approaches for making a radiation-hardened-by-design (RHBD) device is Enclosed-Layout-Transistor (ELT). Normally, {{the gate of the}} MOSFET surrounds the drain, which is placed {{in the center of the}} ELT. The source of the MOSFET surrounds the gate. Another RHBD MOSFET is called <b>H-Gate.</b> Both of these transistors have very low leakage current with respect to radiation. However, they are large in size and take more space on silicon than a standard MOSFET. In older STI (shallow trench isolation) designs, radiation strikes near the silicon oxide region cause the channel inversion at the corners of the standard MOSFET due to accumulation of radiation induced trapped charges. If the charges are large enough, the accumulated charges affect STI surface edges along the channel near the channel interface (gate) of the standard MOSFET. Thus the device channel inversion occurs along the channel edges and the device creates off-state leakage path, causing device to turn on. So the reliability of circuits degrades severely. The ELT offers many advantages. These advantages include improvement of reliability by reducing unwanted surface inversion at the gate edges that occurs in the standard MOSFET. Since the gate edges are enclosed in ELT, there is no gate oxide edge (STI at gate interface), and thus the transistor off-state leakage is reduced very much. Low-power microelectronic circuits including computers, communication devices and monitoring systems in space shuttle and satellites are very different from what we use on earth. They are radiation (high-speed atomic particles like proton and neutron, solar flare magnetic energy dissipation in Earth's space, energetic cosmic rays like X-ray, gamma ray etc.) tolerant circuits. These special electronics are designed by applying very different techniques using RHBD MOSFETs to ensure the safe space journey and also space-walk of astronauts.|$|E
50|$|Produced between 1919 and 1925, the ABC 400 had a 398 cc {{horizontally}} opposed twin-cylinder overhead-valve four-stroke engine, four-speed gearbox with an <b>H-gate</b> and {{was fitted}} with an advanced (for the time) carburettor from Claudel-Hobsob {{to give a}} top speed of 70 mph.|$|E
50|$|The series {{originally}} {{grew out}} of a group of chassis built by Hayashi in Japan for the Jim Russell Racing Drivers School in California, USA. These cars were completed by Russell mechanics in the paddock of the 1984 Long Beach Grand Prix, where the cars made their US debut. The cars have a basic welded steel tube frame chassis, with in-board front shocks operated by upper rocker arms. A 180 hp carbureted Mazda rotary engine drives through a 5 speed H-pattern (<b>H-gate)</b> Hewland Mk 9 transaxle. Rear suspension is by two trailing links, an upper link and a lower a-arm. In the interest of creating close racing and limiting cost, the rules state that no modification is allowed until the rules expressly permit it—at one time even replacing the mirrors on the car was prohibited. The engines cannot be modified, and they are sealed to make it easy to detect cheating. The cars all use the same tires, springs, dampers, and adjustable anti-roll bars.|$|E
5000|$|The {{transmission}} {{is derived from}} Ferrari's Formula One program, and offers the same 150 ms shift times as in the standard Ferrari F430 with no option of a manual <b>H-gate</b> gearshift. Fifth and sixth gears have been tweaked, {{as well as the}} final drive ratio, specifically for the Challenge car. Weight saving efforts have affected all areas of the car, the most noticeable of which being the cockpit. Inside, the F430 Challenge has no carpets or sound deadening, no stereo, and the standard leather seats have been replaced with ultra light FIA approved carbon racing seats. A lifeline snap off boss allows the alcantara steering wheel to be removed from the car to aid entry and exit to the cockpit. The race wheel replacing the standard cars airbag equipped road car wheel. It also has buttons for pit radio, and for interfacing with the digital instrument display. A full roll cage and 6 point racing harnesses are also present in the cockpit along with super light carbon door panels and Lexan front, side and rear windows replacing all road car glass. The characteristics of the car have been retained from the standard gearbox's [...] "Race" [...] mode. Traction control is permanently disengaged, along with the stability system. The car does retain ABS and ASR though. The racing modifications are present in most all of the components, with the E-Differential being replaced by a mechanical one, and the suspension settings modified for racing.|$|E

40|$|This letter {{investigates the}} body current of thin {{silicon-on-insulator}} MOSFETs with body contacts using <b>H-gate</b> and T-gate structures. Due to tunneling between the inversion layer and body contacts, the extra body current was measured and {{confirmed by the}} floating-source measurement techniques The drain current at saturation is increased due to the extra body current, which may result in smaller output resistance. A measurement example is also demonstrated...|$|E
40|$|We grew wafer-scale, uniform nanolayers of gallium {{telluride}} (GaTe) on {{gallium arsenide}} (GaAs) substrates using molecular beam epitaxy. These films initially formed in a {{hexagonal close-packed structure}} (<b>h-GaTe),</b> but monoclinic (m-GaTe) crystalline elements began to form as the film thicknesses increased to more than approximately 90 nm. We confirmed the coexistence of these two crystalline forms using x-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy, and we attribute the thickness-dependent structural change to internal stress induced by lattice mismatch with the substrate and to natural lattice relaxation at the growth conditions...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} some {{implications for}} analogue design of using body ties {{as a solution}} to the problem of floating body effects in partially-depleted (PD) SOI technologies. Measurements on <b>H-gate</b> body-tied structures in a 0. 7 -um SOI process indicate body-tie series resistances increasing into the M region. Both circuit simulation and measurement results reveal a delayed but sharper kink effect as this resistance increases. The consequences of this effect are shown in the context of a simple amplifier configuration, resulting in severe bias-dependent degradation in the small signal gain characteriestics as the body-tie resistance enters the M region. It is deduced that imperfectly body tied devices may be worse for analogue design than using non body-tie at all...|$|E
40|$|SOI device {{technology}} offers the circuit designer higher performance and greater flexibility. This work proposes {{the use of}} a targeted substrate bias and innovative device and circuit topologies to achieve higher performance and lower power while providing a strategy to compensate for wide temperature and process variations. This project introduces and evaluates a modified <b>H-gate</b> device topology (integrated drain-body transistor, or IDBT) vs. alternative structures using simulation supported by electrical results obtained from test circuits. The IDBT can be used to locally and dynamically reduce MOSFET VTH, increase switching speed, and improve circuit energy-delay product by up to 30 %. For all structures investigated, the dynamic body bias provided by IDBTs provides improved logic cell performance vs. conventional source-tied cell designs. This work also examines use of body bias to compensate for temperature or process variations. The temperature range seen by space electronics exceeds standard commercial specs and even military specs. Integrated circuits placed on a satellite or lander vehicle may be expected to operate from below- 200 ºC to over 200 ºC. In this environment, the stabilization of key circuit parameters across temperature, whether power consumption or performance metrics, can b...|$|E
40|$|The {{interactions}} of 9 -aminoacridine with ionic channels were studied in internally perfused squid axons. The kinetics of block of Na channels with 9 -aminoacridine {{varies depending on}} the voltage-clamp pulses {{and the state of}} gating machinery of Na channels. In an axon with intact h gate, the block exhibits frequency- and voltage-dependent characteristics. However, in the pronase-perfused axon, the frequency- dependent block disappears, whereas the voltage-dependent block remains unchanged. A time-dependent decrease in Na currents indicative of direct block of Na channel by drug molecule follows a single exponential function with a time constant of 2. 0 +/- 0. 18 and 1. 0 +/- 0. 19 ms (at 10 degrees C and 80 m V) for 30 and 100 microM 9 - aminoacridine, respectively. A steady-state block can be achieved during a single 8 -ms depolarizing pulse when the h gate has been removed. The block in the <b>h-gate</b> intact axon can be achieved only with multiple conditioning pulses. The voltage-dependent block suggests that 9 -aminoacridine binds to a site located halfway across the membrane with a dissociation constant of 62 microM at 0 m V. 9 -Aminoacridine also blocks K channels, and the block is time- and voltage-dependent...|$|E
40|$|The {{well-known}} {{edge effect}} due to conduction in the parasitic edge transistor at low gate voltages takes place when the threshold voltage is lowered at the device edges. A {{bump in the}} subthreshold characteristic then appears, which is detrimental to circuit performance. Several solutions have been proposed for SOI nMOSFETs, including (a) additional heavy dose boron implant at the edges followed by diffusion, and (b) specially designed SOI transistors such as edgeless devices or <b>H-gate</b> MOSFETs. However, these solutions are not applicable to gate-all-around (GAA) transistors due to their particular structure and fabrication process. In GAA devices, the entire active area is surrounded by the gate oxide and the gate electrode, which renders the use of edgeless structures impossible. Moreover, an oxidation step is performed in order to round the transistor edges, and gate oxide is grown all around the Si island. These steps reduce transistor width and preclude {{the formation of a}} heavy boron doped diffusion zone at the edges. This paper presents a process solution which can be applied to GAA transistors in order to suppress the edge leakage problem. Simulated and experimental curves are presented, together with edge effect characterization by both I-V and charge pumping measurements. The charge pumping method requires the use of a body contacted device. Such a device has been realized for the GAA structure. The body contact is achieved through contacting the transistor body through the gate material. This can be realized along either one or both sides of the device...|$|E
40|$|In {{most of the}} {{electronics}} and communication devices such as mobile, video phone and handheld video games low power and high density SRAM (Static Random Access Memory) is a favor. On the other hand, integration of many functions such as digital, memory, RF and analog circuits is necessary in near future. Scaling {{is one of the}} solutions to increase density of memories and functionality of integrated circuits. However, the increase of leakage current, process complexity and process variation of parameters limit scaling. This limitations force us to think about new dimension in integrated circuits. Three dimensional integrated circuits can solve some of the problems. They can give us low power, high density memories and high functionality circuits in same area of planar ICs. Different technologies can be merged in different layers of 3 DIC to finally make a high performance system. In this thesis we realize SRAM cells in 3 DIC to increase the capacity and performance of them. In chapter 2 we will introduce different memories and particular case SRAM. The principle of operation and design metrics are discussed in this chapter. Then in chapter 3 we talk about 3 DIC and its advantages and disadvantages. Heat generation is main issue in 3 DIC. New 3 DIC fabrication technology called µ-Czochralski Process is introduced. Next in chapter 4 we design SRAM cells using analytic approach and we confirm the design by circuit simulation tools. Different SRAM cells and sense amplifier and output buffers are designed in this chapter. To fabricate design circuits we need layout for SRAM cells. In chapter 5 we extensively look to the design rules for SRAM circuits in one layer and two layers of silicon. Using double gate and <b>H-Gate</b> transistors to increase the performance of SRAM cells are discussed in this chapter. Then in chapter 6 we show fabrication process flow of one layer and two layers single grain silicon devices. Finally fabricated circuits are characterized electrically and results are reported in chapter 7. ECTM, DIMESElectrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Scienc...|$|E
