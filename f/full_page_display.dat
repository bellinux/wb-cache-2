50|$|The first Radius {{product was}} the Radius <b>Full</b> <b>Page</b> <b>Display,</b> the first large screen {{available}} for any personal computer. First {{available for the}} Macintosh Plus, it pioneered the concept of putting multiple screens in a single coordinate space, allowing users to drag windows between multiple screens.

50|$|The DISER Lilith is {{a custom}} built {{workstation}} computer {{based on the}} AMD 2901 bit-slice processor, created by a group led by Niklaus Wirth at ETH Zürich. The project started in 1977 and by 1984 several hundred workstations were in use. It had a high resolution <b>full</b> <b>page</b> <b>display,</b> a mouse, a laser printer interface, and a network interface. Its software was written completely in Modula-2 and included a relational database program called Lidas.|$|E

Changing display orientation did not require rebooting the computer - it was all automatic and seamless and selected by a mercury switch inside the monitor shell. The screen resolution was 720×560 pixels. Positioned vertically, the monitor displayed 72 rows by 91 columns of text; the horizontal resolution was 56 rows by 120 columns.|$|E

Whether the measure is overall profit or a comparison of a <b>full</b> <b>page</b> of <b>display</b> advertising to an 8 -page tabloid preprint, display advertising is more profitable. Differences in the profit margin between display ads and preprints are not nearly as great as the differences in other measures of profit. ...|$|R

Mechanical actuators with a cam-and-follower assembly were found to be suitable for this project; and a non-scientific calculator was designed to implement these actuators.

40|$|From {{early days}} (cf Licklider & Clark, 1962) {{the need for}} larger {{displays}} has been emphasised; but just when it seemed, in the late 1980 s, that <b>full</b> <b>page</b> and larger <b>displays</b> would come with lower prices, the focus in the industry turned to portability and we moved backward to smaller screens. While there was some improvement, larger screens (eg 21 inch CRT displays) are still not available at an acceptable price; {{as long ago as}} 1977 Kay & Goldberg (1977) in their Dynabook concept specified a display the size of a <b>full</b> paper <b>page,</b> but I know of no portable laptop, let alone notebook, which has an A 4 page size screen. ” (Brian Shackel, 2000) Today the situation has changed, and we are happy to recognize the improvements made by industry in order to satisfy the needs of customers and users. In the past, these developments included attempts to achieve "manmachine symbiosis " (Licklider, 1960), the "augmentation of human intellect " (Engelbart, 1963), the "Dynabook" (Kay and Goldberg, 1977), and “ubiquitous computing ” (Weiser, 1991). This line of development resulted in a number of important building blocks for HCI. Some of these building blocks include the mouse, bitmapped displays, personal computers, windows, the desktop metaphor and point-and-click applications. Research on operating systems, meanwhile, has developed techniques for interfacing a variety of input/output devices, for tuning system response time to human interaction times, for multiprocessing and for supporting windowin...|$|R

500|$|The verso of the folio {{containing}} the Arrest of Christ contains a <b>full</b> <b>page</b> of decorated text which begins [...] "". Facing the miniature of the Temptation is another <b>full</b> <b>page</b> of decorated text (folio 203r [...] "Iesus autem plenus"). In {{addition to this}} <b>page,</b> five other <b>full</b> <b>pages</b> also receive elaborate treatment. In Matthew, {{there is one other}} full-page treatment ( [...] , [...] "Tunc crucifixerant Xpi cum eo duos latrones"). In the Gospel of Mark, there are also two pages of decorated text ( [...] , [...] "Erat autem hora tercia", and folio 187v, [...] " [...] quidem [...] postquam"). The Gospel of Luke contains two pages of fully decorated text (folio 188v, [...] "Fuit in diebus Herodis [...] ", and , [...] "Una autem sabbati valde"). Although these texts do not have miniatures associated with them, it is probable that miniatures were planned to accompany each of these texts and have either been lost or were never completed. There is no surviving <b>full</b> <b>page</b> of text in the Gospel of John other than the Incipit. However, in the other three Gospels, all the <b>full</b> <b>pages</b> of decorated text, except for folio 188c, which begins the Nativity narration, occur within the Passion narrative. However, since the missing folios of John contain the Passion narrative, it is likely that John contained <b>full</b> <b>pages</b> of decorated text that have been lost.|$|R
