Travelling wave wall used for Micro Air Vehicle flow control is studied {{to find out}} its drag reduction effect. Aerodynamic characteristics of the airfoil with and without a streamwise travelling wave on its surface are calculated. The interrelationship is also analyzed among lift, drag and ratio of motion phase speed to the external flow velocity. The flexible airfoil that can generate streamwise travelling waves is realized via electromagnetic coil actuation. Thirty-six coils are placed streamwisely under <b>heat</b> <b>shrink</b> <b>film</b> and magnets producing magnetic field are placed under coils. Every single coil is controlled by current to move vertically in harmonic motion with 30 degrees phase difference between adjacent ones. So <b>heat</b> <b>shrink</b> <b>film</b> is actuated, and streamwise travelling wave is generated. Meanwhile, a prototype is designed and tested in wind tunnel. The experimental aerodynamic data proves that streamwise traveling wave airfoil can increase lift and reduce air drag...|$|E

50|$|Shrink wrap is a {{material}} {{made up of}} polymer plastic film. When heat is applied it shrinks tightly over whatever it is covering.

5000|$|Flying models borrow {{construction}} techniques from full-sized aircraft {{although the}} use of metal is limited. These might consist of forming a frame using thin planks of a light wood such as balsa to duplicate the formers, longerons, spars, and ribs of a vintage full-size aircraft, or, on larger (usually powered) models where weight {{is less of a}} factor, sheets of wood, expanded polystyrene, and wood veneers may be employed. Regardless of the underlying structure, it is then skinned and subsequently doped to provide a smooth sealed surface. For light models, tissue paper is used. After it is applied, the paper is sprayed with a mist of water, which causes the paper to shrink when it dries. For larger models (usually powered and radio controlled) heat-curing or <b>heat</b> <b>shrink</b> covering plastic <b>films</b> or heat-shrinkable synthetic fabrics are applied to the model then heated using a hand held hair dryer, laundry iron or heat gun to tighten the material and adhere to the frame. Microfilm covering is used for the very lightest models and is made by bringing a wire loop up through water to pick up a thin plastic film on the surface made from a few drops of lacquer spread out over several square feet.For a more mass market approach, [...] "foamies," [...] or aircraft injection-molded from lightweight foam (sometimes reinforced) have made indoor flight more accessible to hobbyists.

50|$|Another Out of {{autoclave}} {{method for}} achieving external compression on prepreg based composite parts {{is through the}} use of <b>heat</b> <b>shrink</b> tape. This method, however, does not achieve the high quality of RTM or autoclave processes because without the autoclave or a closed mold, the part must be cured in a non-pressurized oven. These compression tapes are typically made from polyester (PET) <b>film.</b> <b>Heat</b> <b>shrink</b> tape is applied to a composite part prior to the heating, or curing cycle. When heated, the tape will shrink in the linear (machine direction). <b>Heat</b> <b>shrink</b> tape works best on parts that are cylindrical or semi-circular in cross section, as this allows the tape to exert even compaction forces on the part surface. Examples would be composite tubes for aerospace, wind energy, consumer sporting goods, etc. <b>Heat</b> <b>shrink</b> tape allows these parts to be processed without the need to cure with the heat and pressure of an autoclave.|$|R

The test media {{is sold in}} a tubing glass bottle which may break if dropped or weakened in shipment to the laboratory. Because mycobacteria is a very infectious airborne agent, there is concern in the marketplace that the potential for breakage of glass bottles places the laboratory technician and environment at risk.

40|$|We {{present a}} rapid, simple, and {{scalable}} approach to achieve superhydrophobic (SH) substrates directly in commodity <b>shrink</b> wrap <b>film</b> utilizing Argon (Ar) plasma.

Contact angle (CA) and contact angle hysteresis (CAH) measurements, respectively, defined as values greater than 150 ° and less than 10 °, verified the SH nature of the substrates. Furthermore, we demonstrate the ability to reliably pattern hydrophilic regions onto the SH substrates, allowing precise capture and detection of proteins in urine.

40|$|<b>Heat</b> <b>shrink</b> tubing {{is used to}} {{insulate}} wire conductors, protect wires, and to create cable entry seals in wire harnessing industries. Performing this sensitive process manually is time consuming, the results are strongly dependent on the operator’s expertise, and the process presents safety concerns. Alternatively, automating the process minimizes the operators’ direct interaction, decreases the production cost over the long term, and improves quantitative and qualitative production indicators dramatically. This thesis introduces the automation of a <b>heat</b> <b>shrink</b> tubing prototype machine that benefits the wire harnessing industry. The prototype consists of an instrumented heat chamber on a linear positioning system, and is fitted with two heat guns. The chamber design allows for the directing of hot air from the heat guns onto the wire harness uniformly through radially-distributed channels. The linear positioning system is designed to move the heat chamber along the wire harness as the proper shrinkage temperature level is reached. Heat exposure time as {{a major factor in}} the <b>heat</b> <b>shrink</b> tubing process can be governed by controlling the linear speed of the heat chamber. A control unit manages the actuator position continuously by measuring the chamber’s speed and temperature. A model-based design approach is followed to design and test the controller, and MATLAB/Simulink is used as the simulation environment. A programmable logic controller is selected as the controller implementation platform. The control unit performance is examined and its responses follow the simulation results with adequate accuracy...|$|R
