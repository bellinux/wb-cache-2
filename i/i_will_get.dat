[...] On 2 February: [...] "Recording voices on Captain [...] Pepper. All six of us doing the chorus in the middle, worked until about midnight." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1957, he {{was sent}} to the Imperial Defence College, London to attend a higher command course for one year. On his return, he was {{appointed}} the General Officer Commanding (GOC), 26th Infantry Division. While he commanded the division, General K. S. Thimayya was the Chief of the Army Staff (COAS), and Krishna Menon, the defence minister. During Menon's visit to Manekshaw's division, he asked him what he thought of his chief. Manekshaw replied that it was not appropriate for him to think of his chief in that way, and told Menon not to ask anybody again. This annoyed Menon and he told Manekshaw that if he wanted to, he could sack Thimayya, to which Manekshaw replied, [...] "You can get rid of him. But then <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>get</b> another." [...] This heated conversation with Menon later proved to be a thorn in his career.|$|E
500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1993, Jackson was accused {{of child sexual abuse}} by a 13-year-old boy, Jordan Chandler, and his father, Evan Chandler, a dentist. The Chandler family demanded payment from Jackson, which he refused. Jordan Chandler {{eventually}} told the police that Jackson had sexually abused him. Jordan's mother was, however, adamant that there had been no wrongdoing on Jackson's part. Evan was recorded discussing his intention to pursue charges, saying, [...] "If I go through with this, I win big-time. There's no way I lose. <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>get</b> everything I want and they will be destroyed forever..... Michael's career will be over." [...] Jackson used the recording to argue that he was the victim of a jealous father whose only goal was to extort money. In January 1994, after an investigation, deputy Los Angeles County district attorney Michael J. Montagna stated that Chandler would not be charged with extortion, due to lack of cooperation from Jackson's party and its willingness to negotiate with Chandler for several weeks, among other reasons.|$|E

500|$|The {{race was}} {{originally}} sponsored by Donald Trump and {{known as the}} [...] "Tour de Trump" [...] in 1989 and 1990. The idea for the race was conceived by CBS Sports reporter John Tesh, who had covered the 1987 Tour de France and on his return suggested holding a race in the United States to the basketball commentator and entrepreneur Billy Packer. Packer originally planned to call the race the Tour de Jersey. He approached representatives of casinos in Atlantic City for sponsorship, and Trump offered to be the race's primary sponsor and Packer's business partner in the venture. It was Packer who suggested the Tour de Trump name. Speaking {{at the time of}} the start of the first Tour de Trump in May 1989, Trump himself stated that [...] "When [...] was initially stated, I practically fell out of my seat. I said, 'Are you kidding? <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>get</b> killed in the media if I use that name. You absolutely have to be kidding'". However, Trump reportedly changed his mind within 20 seconds, and was convinced by the commercial value of the name.|$|E
500|$|Santos {{was under}} {{contract}} with Warrior's Boxing Promotions for one year, his contract ended when he abandoned the promotion. On April 26, 2005, Don King Productions {{announced that the}} company had acquired the exclusive rights to promote Santos' fights. At the moment of the announcement Don King stated that: [...] "Daniel is another proud Puerto Rican world champion and I'm excited to have him with me, Junior middleweight is a solid division and there are many fights we can make for this great champion. Viva Puerto Rico!." [...] Santos said that this event held significance in his life because:"I want to fight all the best fighters and by being with the best promoter, I know <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>get</b> those fights and make good money. I look forward to a long and happy relationship with Don King." [...] When interviewed about Santos' signing, Félix Trinidad Sr. said that he was impressed by Santos' performance against Antonio Margarito and said that a fight between him and Félix Trinidad seemed plausible at the moment. On December 3, 2005 Santos was scheduled to defend the light middleweight championship against Sergiy Dzindziruk. In the eight round of the competition Dzinziruk [...] scored a knockdown. The three judges gave the fight a score of 115–112 in favor of Dzinziruk [...] thus making him the new WBO champion.|$|E

2500|$|Following this, the Congressional Union {{sent two}} {{organizers}} {{to each of}} the nine states where women had the right to vote. [...] Burns went to San Francisco, California with suffragist Rose Winslow. Organizing women in these states was not an easy task, and raising adequate funds was found to be particularly troublesome; Burns is quoted as saying “If the women here, however, would only give me the money they are willing to spend on luncheons and dinners <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>get</b> along admirably.” Burns spread the message about suffrage in theaters, on the streets, by going door-to-door, and by circulating cartoons and pamphlets. By election time in 1914 the Democratic Party had become an extremely vocal critic of the Congressional Union, and ultimately the Congressional Union claimed responsibility for five Democratic losses.|$|E
2500|$|In a 2005 interview, Heap said of Frou Frou [...] "(it) {{was really}} {{like a kind of}} little holiday from my own work. Guy and I, we have always worked together, and then over the years, it became clear that we wanted to do a whole album together. It was very organic and {{spontaneous}} — just one of those wonderful things that happens. But there was never a mention of a second record from either of us, and not uncomfortably. We're just both kind of free spirits. I love to work with a lot of different people, but I was also just gagging to see what I could do on my own. But I'm sure in the future, Guy and <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>get</b> back together to do another record, or to record a few songs together." ...|$|E

In December 2004, the Washington Post summarized Goeglein's job as [...] "to make sure conservatives are happy, in the loop and getting their best ideas before the president and turned into laws." [...] Writing in the New York Times, reporter David D. Kirkpatrick described him as [...] "Mr. Rove's legman on the right". Edwin Feulner, president of The Heritage Foundation, said in June 2004 that he and Goeglein saw each other {{two or three times}} a week, and [...] "If I have a message I want to get to Rove or the administration, I will scribble out a note to Tim, and within 24 hours <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>get</b> a response back.

2500|$|Reshika Udugampola was the {{youngest}} person to represent Sri Lanka at the London Olympic Games {{at the age of}} 18. She was making her first appearance in the quadrennial event. Udugampola attained qualification into the Games through one of FINA's universality places because her fastest time of one minute and 4.23 seconds was 7.69 seconds slower than the [...] "B" [...] (FINA/Olympic Invitation Times) qualifying standard for the women's 100 metre freestyle. Udugampola spent time at Nunawading Aquatic Club in Melbourne to help prepare her for the Games. Prior to leaving for the Games, she said to the press about her excitement over taking part in London and called it [...] "a one in a lifetime chance and we may never get it again": [...] "London is going to be something different. I’ve been training in Australia and I’m aiming for a national record, I don’t know if <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>get</b> it but I’m going to focus on that.” Udugampola participated in event's second heat on 1 August, finishing sixth out of seven athletes, with a time of one minute and 4.93 seconds. She finished in front of Magdalena Moshi of Tanzania (one minute and 5.80 seconds) but behind Madagascar's Aina Fils Rabetsara (one minute and 2.39 seconds) in a heat led by Jade Ashleigh Howard of Zambia (59.35 seconds). Overall she finished 44th out of 48 swimmers, and was unable to advance into the semi-finals because she finished 10.51 seconds behind the slowest athlete who made the later stages.|$|E
2500|$|In March 2015, Nogueira {{revealed}} {{in an interview}} with Combate that he had undergone stem cell therapy on his elbows, hips and knees. Nogueira said,"They have a clinic in Kansas where they work with stem cells. What they do is they remove some cells from fat out of your back and then inject them in your joints. I did it on my elbows, my hips and knees. It stimulates cartilage growth. It's pretty cutting edge technique. I'm responding really well so far. It's been helping a lot with my pain. I'm still doing physiotherapy, which is responsible for curing my hips, but I'm now doing this to make it even stronger. I had a break between my last fight and The Ultimate Fighter shootings, so I decided to go for it."Nogueira also confessed a desire to fight Frank Mir for a third time saying,"In two weeks I'll be cleared to train freely again. First, <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>get</b> my body strong enough so I can train and be 100% ready to fight. I intend to fight at UFC 190 in August. I wanted to come back at the TUF finale card, but I'm afraid there won't be enough time. I'll definitely be ready in August. The UFC told me they would put me in a card in August. They didn't say which one, but I'm sure it'll be the one in Rio. I still don't have an opponent. They said there were three different guys I could be fighting, but I can't comment on that. I don't have any preferences really. I just want to come back and fight, but I would like to face Frank Mir again {{before the end of the}} year." ...|$|E
