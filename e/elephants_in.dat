5|$|Keeping <b>elephants</b> <b>in</b> zoos has {{met with}} some controversy. Proponents of zoos argue that they offer {{researchers}} {{easy access to the}} animals and provide money and expertise for preserving their natural habitats, as well as safekeeping for the species. Critics claim that the animals in zoos are under physical and mental stress. Elephants have been recorded displaying stereotypical behaviours in the form of swaying back and forth, trunk swaying, or route tracing. This has been observed in 54% of individuals in UK zoos. <b>Elephants</b> <b>in</b> European zoos appear to have shorter lifespans than their wild counterparts at only 17 years, although other studies suggest that zoo elephants live as long those in the wild.|$|E
5|$|Like many mammals, {{elephants}} can {{contract and}} transmit diseases to humans, {{one of which}} is tuberculosis. , tuberculosis appears to be widespread among captive <b>elephants</b> <b>in</b> the US, and because the disease can spread through the air to infect both humans and other animals, it is a public health concern affecting circuses and zoos. In 2012, two <b>elephants</b> <b>in</b> Tete d'Or zoo, Lyon were diagnosed with the disease. Due to the threat of transmitting tuberculosis to other animals or visitors to the zoo, their euthanasia was initially ordered by city authorities but a court later overturned this decision. At an elephant sanctuary in Tennessee, a 54-year-old African elephant was considered to be the source of tuberculosis infections among eight workers.|$|E
5|$|The {{practice}} of working elephants {{has also been}} attempted in Africa. The taming of African <b>elephants</b> <b>in</b> the Belgian Congo began by decree of Leopold II of Belgium during the 19th century and continues to the present with the Api Elephant Domestication Centre.|$|E

5|$|The velites {{were used}} against the Carthaginian <b>elephants</b> <b>in</b> the Battle of Zama.

5|$|The mandir also {{consists}} of 234 ornately carved pillars, nine domes, and 20,000 murtis of sadhus, devotees, and acharyas. The mandir also features the Gajendra Pith at its base, a plinth paying {{tribute to the}} elephant for its importance in Hindu culture and India's history. It contains 148 life sized <b>elephants</b> <b>in</b> total weighing a total of 3000tons.|$|E
5|$|The use of <b>elephants</b> <b>in</b> circuses {{has also}} been controversial; the Humane Society of the United States has accused circuses of mistreating and {{distressing}} their animals. In testimony to a US federal court in 2009, Barnum & Bailey Circus CEO Kenneth Feld acknowledged that circus elephants are struck behind their ears, under their chins and on their legs with metal-tipped prods, called bull hooks or ankus. Feld stated that these practices are necessary to protect circus workers and acknowledged that an elephant trainer was reprimanded for using an electric shock device, known as a hot shot or electric prod, on an elephant. Despite this, he denied {{that any of these}} practices harm elephants. Some trainers have tried to train elephants without the use of physical punishment. Ralph Helfer is known to have relied on gentleness and reward when training his animals, including elephants and lions. Ringling Bros. and Barnum and Bailey circus retired its touring <b>elephants</b> <b>in</b> May 2016.|$|E

5|$|EEHV1A (originally just {{known as}} EEHV1) {{was the first}} species/type identified, which causes an acute hemorrhagic disease with a very high {{mortality}} rate in Asian elephants. This form of the virus was originally believed to occur naturally in African elephants (occasionally producing skin nodules), and to be transmitted to Asian elephants within captivity, but more extensive studies have since largely disproved this concept because several other species/types of EEHV (e.g. EEHV2, EEHV3 and EEHV6) instead {{have been identified in}} African elephants. A second lethal subtype, EEHV1B, was identified in Asian <b>elephants</b> <b>in</b> 2001. EEHV3, EEHV4 and EEHV5 have also each been {{responsible for the deaths of}} at least one Asian elephant calf.|$|E
5|$|Elephant endotheliotropic {{herpesvirus}}es (EEHV) or Elephantid herpesvirus 1' {{is a type}} of herpesvirus, {{which can}} cause a highly fatal hemorrhagic disease when transmitted to young Asian <b>elephants.</b> <b>In</b> African elephants, related forms of these viruses, which have been identified in wild populations, are generally benign, occasionally surfacing to cause small growths or lesions. However, some types of EEHV can cause a highly fatal disease in Asian elephants, which kills up to 80% of severely affected individuals. The disease can be treated with the rapid application of antiviral drugs, but this has only been effective in around a third of cases.|$|E
5|$|Elephants {{have been}} an {{integral}} part of the culture of the state. Kerala is home to the largest domesticated population of <b>elephants</b> <b>in</b> India—about 700 Indian elephants, owned by temples as well as individuals. These elephants are mainly employed for the processions and displays associated with festivals celebrated all around the state. More than 10,000 festivals are celebrated in the state annually and some animal lovers have sometimes raised concerns regarding the overwork of domesticated elephants during them. In Malayalam literature, elephants are referred to as the 'sons of the sahya. The elephant is the state animal of Kerala and is featured on the emblem of the Government of Kerala.|$|E

5|$|Nuyts died on 11 December 1655 and {{was buried}} in a churchyard in Hulst. The {{tombstone}} remained until 1983, when it was destroyed during renovations of the church. After his funeral {{it was discovered that}} he had collected more taxes from his estates than he had handed over to the authorities; his son Pieter eventually repaid his father's debts. It was the younger Pieter who also arranged the posthumous publication of his father's treatise Lof des <b>Elephants,</b> <b>in</b> 1670 — a single known copy of which still exists, in the Koninklijke Bibliotheek in The Hague.|$|E
5|$|The use of <b>elephants</b> <b>in</b> such fashion {{went beyond}} the common royal power to {{dispense}} life and death. Elephants have long been used as symbols of royal authority (and still are in some places, such as Thailand, where white elephants are held in reverence). Their use as instruments of state power sent {{the message that the}} ruler was able to preside over very powerful creatures who were under total command. The ruler was thus seen as maintaining a moral and spiritual domination over wild beasts, adding to their authority and mystique among subjects.|$|E
5|$|According to the Samyutta Nikaya, Koṇḍañña {{retired to}} {{the banks of the}} Mandakini Lake in the Chaddanta forest, said to be the abode of the paccekabuddhas. It was said that the 8000 <b>elephants</b> <b>in</b> the forest took turns to {{catering}} for his needs. Koṇḍañña only left once, to farewell Gautama Buddha. Koṇḍañña kissed the Buddha's feet and stroked them with his hands. He advised his disciples not to mourn him before returning to the forest to pass away the following morning. He was cremated on a large sandalwood pyre which was constructed {{with the help of the}} elephants, and the ceremony was presided over by Anuruddha, one of the ten chief disciples and five hundred other monks. The ashes were later taken to Veluvana, where they were enshrined in a silver stupa.|$|E

5|$|Alexander the Great trained {{his foot}} {{soldiers}} to injure {{the animals and}} cause them to panic during wars with both the Persians and Indians. Ptolemy, {{who was one of}} Alexander's generals, used corps of Asian elephants during his reign as the ruler of Egypt (which began in 323 BC). His son and successor Ptolemy II (who began his rule in 285 BC) obtained his supply of elephants further south in Nubia. From then on, war elephants were employed in the Mediterranean and North Africa throughout the classical period. The Greek king Pyrrhus used <b>elephants</b> <b>in</b> his attempted invasion of Rome in 280 BC. While they frightened the Roman horses, they were not decisive and Pyrrhus ultimately lost the battle. The Carthaginian general Hannibal took elephants across the Alps during his war with the Romans and reached the Po Valley in 217 BC with all of them alive, but they later succumbed to disease.|$|E
5|$|Pyrrhus' {{motivation}} for agreeing to assist Cleonymus is more complex. By installing Cleonymus on the throne, the Epiriote would secure Sparta as an ally. Additionally, by invading the Peloponnese, Pyrrhus {{would be able}} to subdue any cities which had remained loyal to Antigonus. In doing so, he could prevent Antigonus using the peninsula as a base from which to launch a counter-attack on Macedon. The size of the force assembled by Pyrrhus is indicative of his intention to extend his hegemony into the Peloponnese. The Epiriote king mustered an army consisting of 25,000 infantry and 2,000 cavalry as well as 24 war <b>elephants.</b> <b>In</b> 272 BC, Pyrrhus marched his army through Central Greece to the city of Pleuron from where they were ferried across the Gulf of Corinth to the Peloponnese. This suggests that the invasion was supported by the Aetolian League, a powerful confederate in Central Greece which was allied with Pyrrhus and hostile to Antigonus.|$|E
5|$|The Roman {{army had}} not yet seen <b>elephants</b> <b>in</b> battle, and their {{inexperience}} turned the tide in Pyrrhus' favour at the Battle of Heraclea in 280 BC, and again at the Battle of Ausculum in 279 BC. Despite these victories, Pyrrhus found his position in Italy untenable. Rome steadfastly refused to negotiate with Pyrrhus {{as long as his}} army remained in Italy. Furthermore, Rome entered into a treaty of support with Carthage, and Pyrrhus found that despite his expectations, none of the other Italic peoples would defect to the Greek and Samnite cause. Facing unacceptably heavy losses with each encounter with the Roman army, and failing to find further allies in Italy, Pyrrhus withdrew from the peninsula and campaigned in Sicily against Carthage, abandoning his allies to deal with the Romans.|$|E

5|$|African {{elephants}} receive {{at least}} some legal protection in every country where they are found, but 70% of their range exists outside protected areas. Successful conservation efforts in certain areas have led to high population densities. As of 2008, local numbers were controlled by contraception or translocation. Large-scale cullings ceased in 1988, when Zimbabwe abandoned the practice. In 1989, the African elephant was listed under Appendix I by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), making trade illegal. Appendix II status (which allows restricted trade) was given to <b>elephants</b> <b>in</b> Botswana, Namibia, and Zimbabwe in 1997 and South Africa in 2000. In some countries, sport hunting of the animals is legal; Botswana, Cameroon, Gabon, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Tanzania, Zambia, and Zimbabwe have CITES export quotas for elephant trophies. In June 2016, the First Lady of Kenya, Margaret Kenyatta, helped launch the East Africa Grass-Root Elephant Education Campaign Walk, organised by elephant conservationist Jim Nyamu. The event was conducted {{to raise awareness of}} the value of elephants and rhinos, to help mitigate human-elephant conflicts, and to promote anti-poaching activities.|$|E
5|$|Elephants {{typically}} coexist peacefully {{with other}} herbivores, which will usually {{stay out of}} their way. Some aggressive interactions between elephants and rhinoceros have been recorded. At Aberdare National Park, Kenya, a rhino attacked an elephant calf and was killed by the other <b>elephants</b> <b>in</b> the group. At Hluhluwe–Umfolozi Game Reserve, South Africa, introduced young orphan elephants went on a killing spree that {{claimed the lives of}} 36 rhinos during the 1990s, but ended with the introduction of older males. The size of adult elephants makes them nearly invulnerable to predators, though there are rare reports of adult elephants falling prey to tigers. Calves may be preyed on by lions, spotted hyenas, and wild dogs in Africa and tigers in Asia. The lions of Savuti, Botswana, have adapted to hunting juvenile elephants during the dry season, and a pride of 30 lions has been recorded killing juvenile individuals between the ages of four and eleven years. Elephants appear to distinguish between the growls of larger predators like tigers and smaller ones like leopards (which have not been recorded killing calves); the latter they react less fearfully and more aggressively to. Elephants tend to have high numbers of parasites, particularly nematodes, compared to other herbivores. This is due to lower predation pressures that would otherwise kill off many of the individuals with significant parasite loads.|$|E
5|$|Elephants were {{historically}} {{kept for}} {{display in the}} menageries of Ancient Egypt, China, Greece, and Rome. The Romans in particular pitted them against humans and other animals in gladiator events. In the modern era, elephants have traditionally been {{a major part of}} zoos and circuses around the world. In circuses, they are trained to perform tricks. The most famous circus elephant was probably Jumbo (1861 – 15 September 1885), who was a major attraction in the Barnum & Bailey Circus. These animals do not reproduce well in captivity, due to the difficulty of handling musth bulls and limited understanding of female oestrous cycles. Asian elephants were always more common than their African counterparts in modern zoos and circuses. After CITES listed the Asian elephant under Appendix I in 1975, the number of African <b>elephants</b> <b>in</b> zoos increased in the 1980s, although the import of Asians continued. Subsequently, the US received many of its captive African elephants from Zimbabwe, which had an overabundance of the animals. As of 2000, around 1,200 Asian and 700 African elephants were kept in zoos and circuses. The largest captive population is in North America, which has an estimated 370 Asian and 350 African elephants. About 380 Asians and 190 Africans are known to exist in Europe, and Japan has around 70 Asians and 67 Africans.|$|E
