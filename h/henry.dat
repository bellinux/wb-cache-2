5|$|By 1182 Young <b>Henry</b> reiterated his {{previous}} demands: {{he wanted to}} be granted lands, for example the Duchy of Normandy, which would allow him to support himself and his household with dignity. <b>Henry</b> refused, but agreed to increase his son's allowance, but this was not enough to placate Young <b>Henry.</b> With trouble clearly brewing, <b>Henry</b> attempted to defuse the situation by insisting that Richard and Geoffrey give homage to Young <b>Henry</b> for their lands. Richard did not believe that Young <b>Henry</b> had any claim over Aquitaine and refused to give homage; when <b>Henry</b> forced Richard to give homage, Young <b>Henry</b> angrily refused to accept it. Young <b>Henry</b> formed an alliance with some of the disgruntled barons of the Aquitaine who were unhappy with Richard's rule, and Geoffrey sided with him, raising a mercenary army in Brittany to threaten Poitou. Open war broke out in 1183 and <b>Henry</b> and Richard led a joint campaign into Aquitaine: before they could conclude it, however, Young <b>Henry</b> caught a fever and died, bringing a sudden end to the rebellion.|$|E
5|$|Clare and <b>Henry</b> marry, but Clare {{has trouble}} {{bringing}} a pregnancy to term {{because of the}} genetic anomaly <b>Henry</b> may presumably be passing on to the fetus. After six miscarriages, <b>Henry</b> wishes to save Clare further pain and has a vasectomy. However a version of <b>Henry</b> from the past visits Clare one night and they make love; she subsequently gives birth to a daughter, Alba. Alba is diagnosed with Chrono-Impairment as well but, unlike <b>Henry,</b> she has some control over her destinations when she time travels. Before she is born, <b>Henry</b> travels to the future and meets his ten-year-old daughter on a school field trip and learns that he dies when she is five years old.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the early}} success with Scotland, <b>Henry</b> hesitated to invade France, {{annoying}} Charles. <b>Henry</b> finally went to France in June 1544 with a two-pronged attack. One force under Norfolk ineffectively besieged Montreuil. The other, under Suffolk, laid siege to Boulogne. <b>Henry</b> later took personal command, and Boulogne fell on 18 September 1544. However, <b>Henry</b> had refused Charles' request to march against Paris. Charles' own campaign fizzled, {{and he made}} peace with France that same day. <b>Henry</b> was left alone against France, unable to make peace. Francis attempted to invade England {{in the summer of}} 1545, but reached only the Isle of Wight before being repulsed. Out of money, France and England signed the Treaty of Camp on 7 June 1546. <b>Henry</b> secured Boulogne for eight years. The city was then to be returned to France for 2 million crowns (£750,000). <b>Henry</b> needed the money; the 1544 campaign had cost £650,000, and England was once again bankrupt.|$|E

5|$|During this period, neither William nor Robert {{seems to}} have trusted <b>Henry.</b> Waiting until the {{rebellion}} against William Rufus was safely over, <b>Henry</b> returned to England in July 1088. He met with the King {{but was unable to}} persuade him to grant him their mother's estates, and travelled back to Normandy in the autumn. While he had been away, however, Odo, the Bishop of Bayeux, who regarded <b>Henry</b> as a potential competitor, had convinced Robert that <b>Henry</b> was conspiring against the duke with William Rufus. On landing, Odo seized <b>Henry</b> and imprisoned him in Neuilly-la-Forêt, and Robert took back the county of the Cotentin. <b>Henry</b> was held there over the winter, but in the spring of 1089 the senior elements of the Normandy nobility prevailed upon Robert to release him.|$|E

Joel and <b>Henry</b> initially think each other are hostile, until they see Sam and Ellie, respectively. Like Joel, <b>Henry</b> is an experienced survivor, and the two decide to team up, since both pairs are looking for the Fireflies. They work together to overpower the bandits guarding the exit to the Quarantine Zone, and escape to an abandoned radio tower in the Suburbs. There, Joel and <b>Henry</b> bond over their mutual love of motorbikes, but Sam becomes morose and introverted, particularly after a conversation with Ellie over death and the Infected. The next day, it emerges that Sam was bitten while escaping the Suburbs, and he attacks Ellie, forcing <b>Henry</b> to kill him. Overcome with grief and guilt at his brother's death, <b>Henry</b> commits suicide with his gun.|$|E

5|$|<b>Henry</b> I (c. 1068– 1 December 1135), {{also known}} as <b>Henry</b> Beauclerc, was King of England from 1100 to his death. <b>Henry</b> was the fourth son of William the Conqueror and was educated in Latin and the liberal arts. On William's death in 1087, Henry's elder {{brothers}} Robert Curthose and William Rufus inherited Normandy and England, respectively, but <b>Henry</b> was left landless. <b>Henry</b> purchased the County of Cotentin in western Normandy from Robert, but William and Robert deposed him in 1091. <b>Henry</b> gradually rebuilt his power base in the Cotentin and allied himself with William against Robert. <b>Henry</b> was present when William died in a hunting accident in 1100, and he seized the English throne, promising at his coronation to correct many of William's less popular policies. <b>Henry</b> married Matilda of Scotland but continued to have {{a large number of}} mistresses by whom he had many illegitimate children.|$|E

Shortly afterwards, the Pope decreed sentences of excommunication against <b>Henry</b> and Cranmer. As {{a result of}} this marriage and these excommunications, the first break between the Church of England and Rome took place and the Church of England was brought under the King's control. Anne was crowned Queen of England on 1 June 1533. On 7 September, she gave birth to the future Queen Elizabeth I. <b>Henry</b> was disappointed to have a daughter rather than a son but hoped a son would follow and professed to love Elizabeth. Anne subsequently had three miscarriages, and by March 1536, <b>Henry</b> was courting Jane Seymour.

50|$|The {{area was}} known as Island Park long before the 33 mi-long town was incorporated. The area known as Island Park is mostly a large crater or caldera named the <b>Henry's</b> Fork Caldera that {{was created by the}} same hotspot that created the earlier Island Park Caldera and the later Yellowstone Caldera. In {{addition}} to the <b>Henry's</b> Fork Caldera, about a third of what is known as Island Park, is north of this caldera and extends across <b>Henry's</b> Lake Flat, across <b>Henry's</b> Lake, and to the Idaho/Montana border. <b>Henry's</b> Lake Flat is a flat bottomed valley between high mountain ranges with <b>Henrys</b> Lake at the northwest end of the flats. Mount Jefferson, south of <b>Henrys</b> Lake, is at 10203 ft and Targhee Peak, north of <b>Henrys</b> Lake is at 10240 ft. The most famous of Island Park's peaks, however, is the 9886 ft Sawtell Peak, south of <b>Henrys</b> Lake near Mount Jefferson. The peak is known for its beauty and is named for a perceived resemblance to a Native American chief's profile while napping. The peak has also been called Chief Rains in the Face. Sawtell Peak is topped by a FAA radar dome and is a visible from nearly anywhere in Island Park.|$|R
