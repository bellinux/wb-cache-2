5|$|The use {{of horses}} in World War I marked a {{transitional}} {{period in the}} evolution of armed conflict. Cavalry units were initially considered essential offensive elements of a military force, but {{over the course of the}} war, the vulnerability of horses to modern machine gun and artillery fire reduced their utility on the battlefield. This paralleled the development of tanks, which would ultimately replace cavalry <b>in</b> <b>shock</b> tactics. While the perceived value of the horse in war changed dramatically, horses still played a significant role throughout the war.|$|E

He shows this by citing various current events, such as the re-election of George W. Bush to the American presidency, the sudden death of Christopher Reeve and that the Boston Red Sox have won the 2004 World Series. Once Ben tells him about the Red Sox, Jack starts laughing and says that proves he is lying.

40|$|Striking {{differences}} {{have been noted}} between dogs in hemorrhagic and <b>in</b> tourniquet <b>shock</b> (1). <b>In</b> both types, there is a reduction in blood vol-ume, but the hematocrit and blood viscosity, which remain substantially unchanged <b>in</b> hemorrhagic <b>shock,</b> increase <b>in</b> tourniquet <b>shock.</b> At a blood pressure level of 80 to 100 mm. Hg, the dog <b>in</b> hemorrhagic <b>shock</b> is only mildly depressed and is still responsive to ordinary stimuli; whereas, <b>in</b> tourniquet <b>shock</b> he is already severely depressed, unresponsive to strong stimulation, much more sensitive to further slight blood loss, and {{is in a state}} of rapid deterioration. When the pressure falls below 70 to 80 mm. Hg <b>in</b> tourniquet <b>shock,</b> the collapse is precipitous; whereas, the unanesthe-tized dog <b>in</b> hemorrhagic <b>shock</b> can tolerate a blood pressure of 50 mm. Hg for many hours. These {{differences have}} been explained on the basis of a toxin from devitalized tissue (2, 3) or bac-teria (4) in the tourniqueted extremity. The suc-cessful treatment of tourniquet <b>shock</b> <b>in</b> the un-anesthetized dog by plasma infusion alone (1) con-stitutes evidence against the "toxin " hypothesis. Since the increase in blood viscosity <b>in</b> tourni-quet <b>shock</b> is one of the outspoken differences be-tween tourniquet and hemorrhagic shock, the ef-fect of increased blood viscosity on blood flow in the intact and shocked animal was investigated to see how far it might explain the sharp disparity between these two types of shock...|$|R

Clark expresses fear that Lana is {{drifting}} away because of his secret, so he decides to reveal his powers to her. Clark then uses the coal to make a diamond ring and proposes marriage. Afterward, Clark reveals {{what he did to}} his parents, Jonathan and Martha Kent (John Schneider and Annette O'Toole), who tell him that he is old enough to make decisions on his own without the advice of his father. After some initial doubt, Lana returns to the Kent farm to accept Clark's proposal.|$|E
5|$|Eva also visited Switzerland {{during her}} European tour, a visit {{that has been}} viewed as {{the worst part of}} the trip. According to the book Evita: A Biography by John Barnes, while she {{traveled}} down a street with many people crowding her car, someone threw two stones and smashed the windshield. She threw her hands up <b>in</b> <b>shock,</b> but was not injured. Later, while sitting with the Foreign Minister, protesters threw tomatoes at her. The tomatoes hit the Foreign Minister and splattered on Eva's dress. After these two events, Eva had had enough, and after two months returned to Argentina.|$|E
5|$|If the {{systolic}} {{blood pressure}} falls below 90 mmHg {{within days of the}} injury, blood supply to the spinal cord may be reduced, resulting in further damage. Thus it is important to maintain the blood pressure using a central venous catheter, intravenous fluids, and vasopressors, and to treat cases of shock. Mean arterial blood pressure is measured and kept at 85 to 90 mmHg for seven days after injury. The treatment for shock from blood loss (hypovolemic shock) is different from that for neurogenic shock, and could harm people with the latter type, so it is necessary to determine why someone is <b>in</b> <b>shock.</b> However it is also possible for both causes to exist at the same time. Another important aspect of care is prevention of hypoxia (insufficient oxygen in the bloodstream), which could deprive the spinal cord of much-needed oxygen. People with cervical injuries may experience a dangerously slowed heart rate; treatment to speed it up include atropine and electrical cardiac pacing.|$|E
30|$|Introduction Regional {{perfusion}} parameters, like lactate, pyruvate and glycerol, may predict outcome <b>in</b> septic <b>shock</b> patients.

40|$|By {{using the}} flux ratio [Fe II] λ 8617 /[O I] λ 6300, we {{demonstrate}} {{that most of}} the interstellar dust grains survive <b>in</b> <b>shocks</b> associated with supernova remnants and Herbig-Haro objects. The [Fe II]/[O I] flux ratio is sensitive to the gas-phase Fe/O abundance ratio, but is insensitive to the ionization state, temperature, and density of the gas. We calculate the [Fe II]/[O I] flux ratio <b>in</b> <b>shocks,</b> and compare the results with the observational data. When only 20 % of iron is in the gas phase, the models reproduce most successfully the observations. This finding is in conflict with the current consensus that shocks destroy almost all the grains and ∼ 100 % of metals are in the gas phase. We comment on previous works on grain destruction, and discuss why grains are not destroyed <b>in</b> <b>shocks.</b> Subject headings: dust, extinction — ISM: abundances — shock waves — supernova remnants 1...|$|R
5|$|In September York {{arrived from}} Ireland, {{and at the}} {{parliament}} of October that year, the duke {{walked up to the}} throne and put his hand on it. The act, signifying usurpation, left the assembly <b>in</b> <b>shock.</b> It is unclear whether Warwick had prior knowledge of York's plans, though it is assumed that this had been agreed upon between the two in Ireland the previous March. It soon became clear, however, that this regime change was unacceptable to the lords in parliament, and a compromise was agreed. The Act of Accord of 31October 1460 stated that while Henry VI was allowed to stay on the throne for the remainder of his life, his son Edward, Prince of Wales, was to be disinherited. Instead, York would succeed the king, and act as protector.|$|E
5|$|Klose's goal {{initiated}} {{a flurry of}} German scoring as Brazil {{lost control of the}} game. In the 24th minute, Kroos scored with a left-footed strike {{from the edge of the}} area after Lahm's cross was deflected. Then, in the 26th minute, just a few seconds after Brazil kicked off, Kroos caught Fernandinho in possession in his own half and played a one-two with Khedira before scoring again. Kroos' goals came just 70 seconds apart. Khedira himself scored in the 29th minute after exchanging passes with Mesut Özil. All five of Germany's first half goals came within the first half-hour, with four of them coming in one six-minute period. Brazil had no shots on target in the first half. Many Brazil supporters in the crowd were visibly <b>in</b> <b>shock</b> or reduced to tears. The resulting fights in the Mineirão stands forced the Military Police to send a special forces squad into the stadium.|$|E

5|$|The Red Army's winter counter-offensive {{drove the}} Wehrmacht from Moscow, {{but the city}} was still {{considered}} to be threatened, with the front line relatively close. Because of this, the Moscow theater remained a priority for Stalin, who at first appeared to be <b>in</b> <b>shock</b> due to the initial German success. In particular, the initial Soviet advance was unable to reduce the Rzhev salient, held by several divisions of Army Group Center. Immediately after the Moscow counter-offensive, a series of Soviet attacks (the Battles of Rzhev) were attempted against the salient, each time with heavy losses on both sides. By early 1943, the Wehrmacht had to disengage from the salient as the whole front was moving west. Nevertheless, the Moscow front was not finally secured until October 1943, when Army Group Center was decisively repulsed from the Smolensk landbridge and from the left shore of the upper Dnieper {{at the end of}} the Second Battle of Smolensk.|$|E
