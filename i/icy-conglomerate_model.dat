40|$|The {{problems}} of calculating cometary orbits are discussed, with {{particular attention to}} that of predicting the returns of periodic comets. It is shown that the only inherent difficulty arises from the action of nongravitational forces. Recent progress toward an understanding of these forces is described in detail, both {{from the point of}} view of fitting the observations and of interpreting the forces in terms of the Whipple <b>icy-conglomerate</b> <b>model...</b>|$|E
40|$|The <b>icy-conglomerate</b> <b>model</b> {{of comet}} nuclei has {{dominated}} all others since its introduction. It provided {{a basis for}} understanding the non-gravitational motions of comets which had perplexed dynamicists up to that time, and provided a focus for understanding cometary composition and origin. The image of comets as dirty snowballs was quickly adopted. Comet nuclei including their trail mass loss rates and refractory to volatile mass ratios are described...|$|E
40|$|A {{new model}} for the nucleus of comets is presented, hypothesizing {{formation}} at large heliocentric distances from many independent solid bodies. It is shown that such a configuration would collapse to a single assemblage {{if it is to}} survive into the inner solar system. Prior to collapse, the bodies would be subject to coating by interstellar gas and particles, which would form the material lost into the coma at subsequent inner solar system perihelia. Quantitative estimates place an upper limit to the body sizes of 2. 3 m and a lower limit of the number as 3 x 10 to the 10 th power with sizes of a few tenths of a micron and numbers of about 10 to the 33 rd power most probable. The major structural and evolutionary features of such comet nuclei are consistent with the Whipple <b>icy-conglomerate</b> <b>model...</b>|$|E
40|$|International audienceComets are {{composed}} of dust and frozen gases. The ices are mixed with the refractory material either as an icy conglomerate 1, or as an aggregate of pre-solar grains (grains that existed prior {{to the formation of}} the Solar System), mantled by an ice layer 2, 3. The presence of water-ice grains in periodic comets is now well established 4, 5, 6. Modelling of infrared spectra obtained about ten kilometres from the nucleus of comet Hartley 2 suggests that larger dust particles are being physically decoupled from fine-grained water-ice particles that may be aggregates 7, which supports the <b>icy-conglomerate</b> <b>model.</b> It is known that comets build up crusts of dust that are subsequently shed as they approach perihelion 8, 9, 10. Micrometre-sized interplanetary dust particles collected in the Earth’s stratosphere and certain micrometeorites are assumed to be of cometary origin 11, 12, 13. Here we report that grains collected from the Jupiter-family comet 67 P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko come from a dusty crust that quenches the material outflow activity at the comet surface 14. The larger grains (exceeding 50 micrometres across) are fluffy (with porosity over 50 per cent), and many shattered when collected on the target plate, suggesting that they are agglomerates of entities in the size range of interplanetary dust particles. Their surfaces are generally rich in sodium, which explains the high sodium abundance in cometary meteoroids 15. The particles collected to date therefore probably represent parent material of interplanetary dust particles. This argues against comet dust being composed of a silicate core mantled by organic refractory material and then by a mixture of water-dominated ices 2, 3. At its previous recurrence (orbital period 6. 5 years), the comet’s dust production doubled when it was between 2. 7 and 2. 5 astronomical units from the Sun 14, indicating that this was when the nucleus shed its mantle. Once the mantle is shed, unprocessed material starts to supply the developing coma, radically changing its dust component, which then also contains icy grains, as detected during encounters with other comets closer to the Sun 4, 5...|$|E
