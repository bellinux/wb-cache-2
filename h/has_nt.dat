40|$|Abstract — We {{consider}} beamforming in {{a cognitive}} network with multiple primary users and secondary users {{sharing the same}} spectrum. In particular, we assume that each secondary transmitter <b>has</b> <b>Nt</b> antennas and transmits data to its singleantenna receiver using beamforming. The beamformer is designed to maximize the cognitive user’s signal-to-interference ratio (SIR), defined as {{the ratio of the}} received signal power at the desired cognitive receiver to the total interference created at all the primary receivers. Using mathematical tools from random matrix theory, we derive both lower and upper bounds on the average interference at the primary receivers and the average SIR of the cognitive user. We further analyze and prove the convergence of these two performance measures asymptotically as the number of antennas Nt or primary users Np increases. Specifically, the average interference per primary receiver converges to the expected value of the path loss in the network whereas the average SIR of the secondary user decays as 1 /c when c = Np/Nt →∞. In the special case of Nt = Np, the average total interference approaches 0 and the average SIR approaches ∞. I...|$|E

40|$|Objective: Smith–Magenis {{syndrome}} (SMS) is {{a multiple}} congenital anomalies/mental retardation disorder {{characterized by an}} interstitial deletion involving chromosome 17 p 11. 2 containing the retinoic acid-induced 1 (RAI 1) gene or due to mutation of RAI 1. Few cases {{have been reported in}} the medical literature regarding prenatal diagnosis of SMS. We report on the prenatal diagnosis of SMS in two fetuses with increased nuchal translucency (NT), mild lateral ventriculomegaly, and congenital heart defects by whole-genome and high-resolution chromosome microarray analysis (CMA). Case Report: The CMA result of Fetus 1, which <b>had</b> increased <b>NT,</b> mild lateral ventriculomegaly, tricuspid regurgitation, and right aortic arch with left ductus arteriosus, revealed a de novo 4. 79 -Mb deletion at 17 p 12 p 11. 2.

Conclusion: The findings further confirm that increased NT is associated with genetic syndromes, and brain imaging is necessary for SMS fetuses. Both deletions encompass the SMS “critical region”, which includes many genes including RAI 1. However, the precise gene(s) responsible for the heart defects in SMS remain unclear; further efforts should be undertaken to understand the molecular basis of this syndrome...|$|R

We evaluated a non-invasive method to screen for Down syndrome at a maternal age of 35 years or more. We measured nuchal translucency thickness (NT) using a fixed cut-off of 3. 0 mm or more with a crown-rump length (CRL) of 50 - 70 mm and nasal bone (NB) examination at 11 - 13 + 6 weeks of gestation. Materials and MethodsThis prospective study was conducted from January 2001 to January 2003. NT was measured at 11 - 13 + 6 weeks of gestation. In addition, the NB was examined from January 2002 to January 2003. Cases with an NT of at least 3. 0 mm were submitted to TORCH examination (toxoplasma, rubella, cytomegalovirus, and herpes simplex virus I and II). Genetic amniocentesis was performed at 16 weeks of gestation. Both antenatal and postnatal management and observations were carried out. ResultsNT was measured in 175 cases between January 2001 and January 2002. Combined NT measurement and NB examination was performed in 97 cases between January 2002 and January 2003. Maternal ages ranged from 35 to 43 years, with first to fifth gravidity. Of the 175 <b>NT</b> cases, seven <b>had</b> <b>NT</b> of at least 3. 0 mm. The detection rate (DR) for Down syndrome was 71. 4 % (5 / 7) and the false-positive rate (FPR) was 1. 2 % (2 / 170). Of the 97 NT plus NB absence cases, four <b>had</b> an <b>NT</b> of at least 3. 0 mm and three had no NB.
