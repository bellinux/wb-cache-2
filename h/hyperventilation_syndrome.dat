40|$|Acupuncture {{has been}} an {{integral}} part of Traditional Chinese Medicine for thousands of years. It has been used for the treatment of many painful and nonpainful conditions. Its use within Western medicine has increased since the 1970 s and acupuncture is now practiced by a variety of healthcare practitioners across Europe. There is an accepted body of evidence to support the use of acupuncture for back or neck pain. Anecdotal evidence from both clinicians and patients suggests there may be some beneficial effect of acupuncture in the treatment of respiratory symptoms, such as bronchospasm, breathlessness and <b>hyperventilation</b> <b>syndromes.</b> Some respiratory clinicians are introducing acupuncture as a treatment modality for the management of respiratory symptoms, despite the lack of available objective evidence to support this practice. This article reviews the available evidence for the use of acupuncture in respiratory disorders and provides discussion of the methodological issues that are evident within this literature. It also highlights reasons for the lack of objective evidence to support acupuncture for respiratory conditions and the difficulties faced by acupuncture researchers when designing randomized, placebo-controlled trials.

The evaluation was repeated 4 weeks later, after half of the patients and healthy subjects had engaged in a therapy method called 'Grounding', a physical exercise inspired by African dance. The patients reported significantly higher levels of hyperventilation as compared to the healthy subjects. All patients' average score on NQ was 26. 57 +/- 10. 98, while that of the healthy subjects was 15. 14 +/- 7. 89 (t = - 3. 48, df = 42, p < 0. 001). The NQ scores correlated strongly with two measures of exhaustion (Karolinska Exhaustion Scale KES r = 0. 772, p < 0. 01; Shirom Melamed Burnout Measure SMBM r = 0. 565, p < 0. 01), mental status [Hospital Anxiety and Depression Score (HADS) depression r = 0. 414, p < 0. 01; HADS anxiety r = 0. 627, p < 0. 01], sleep disturbances (r = - 0. 514, p < 0. 01), pain (r = -. 370, p < 0. 05) and poor well-being (Medical Outcomes Survey Short Form 36 questionnaire-SR Health r = - 0. 529, p < 0. 05). In the logistic regression analysis, the variance in the scores from NQ were explained to a high degree (R- 2 = 0. 752) by scores in KES and HADS. The brief Grounding training contributed to a near significant reduction in hyperventilation (F = 2. 521, p < 0. 124) and to significant reductions in exhaustion scores and scores of depression and anxiety.

50|$|This {{disease is}} an {{inflammation}} of the alveoli in the lungs. Initial symptoms are breathlessness especially after sudden exertion or when exposed to temperature change and can be very similar to asthma, <b>hyperventilation</b> <b>syndrome</b> or pulmonary embolism. One of the defining characteristics of bird fanciers lung is that many medical tests will show a normal range of results {{and it will be}} identified by X-ray or CT scans showing physical changes to the lung structure (a ground glass appearance). If someone with BFL has been exposed to avian proteins they will see symptoms within 4-6 hours. Symptoms include chills, fever, breathlessness, non-productive cough and chest discomfort. In the chronic form there is usually anorexia, weight loss, extreme tiredness and progressive interstitial fibrosis which is the most disabling feature of the disease as this causes scarring on the lungs which reduces the lungs ability to move air in and out, and as a result sufferers have repeated chest infections and ultimately struggle to breathe. This condition is occasionally fatal.|$|E
50|$|It {{is only as}} {{a result}} of {{accurately}} maintaining the composition of the 3 liters of alveolar air that with each breath some carbon dioxide is discharged into the atmosphere and some oxygen is taken up from the outside air. If more carbon dioxide than usual has been lost by a short period of hyperventilation, respiration will be slowed down or halted until the alveolar partial pressure of carbon dioxide has returned to 5.3 kPa (40 mmHg). It is therefore strictly speaking untrue that the primary function of the respiratory system is to rid the body of carbon dioxide “waste”. The carbon dioxide that is breathed out with each breath could probably be more correctly be seen as a byproduct of the body’s extracellular fluid carbon dioxide and pH homeostats If these homeostats are compromised, then a respiratory acidosis, or a respiratory alkalosis will occur. In the long run these can be compensated by renal adjustments to the H+ and HCO3− concentrations in the plasma; but since this takes time, the <b>hyperventilation</b> <b>syndrome</b> can, for instance, occur when agitation or anxiety cause a person to breathe fast and deeply thus causing a distressing respiratory alkalosis through the blowing off of too much CO2 from the blood into the outside air.|$|E
50|$|Paresthesias of the hands, feet, {{legs and}} arms are common, {{transient}} symptoms. The briefest, electric shock type of paresthesia {{can be caused by}} tweaking the ulnar nerve near the elbow. Similar brief shocks can be experienced when any other nerve is tweaked (a tweaked neck nerve may cause a brief shock-like paresthesia toward the scalp). In the older age group, spinal column irregularities may tweak the spinal cord briefly when the head or back is turned, flexed, or extended into brief uncommon positions (Lhermitte's sign). The most common, everyday cause is temporary restriction of nerve impulses to an area of nerves, commonly caused by leaning or resting on parts of the body such as the legs (often followed by a pins and needles tingling sensation). Other causes include conditions such as <b>hyperventilation</b> <b>syndrome</b> and panic attacks. A cold sore outside the mouth (not a canker sore inside the mouth) can be preceded by tingling because a cold sore is caused by herpes simplex virus. The Varicella zoster virus (Shingles) also notably may cause recurring pain and tingling in skin or tissue along the distribution path of that nerve (most commonly in skin, along a dermatome pattern, but sometimes feeling like headache, chest or abdominal pain, or pelvic pain).|$|E
40|$|Background Febrile {{convulsion}} {{and chronic}} <b>hyperventilation</b> <b>syndrome</b> (spasmophilia) are suspected {{to share the}} same root of pathophysiology, a genetic trait abnormality related to ion channel that could cause neuronal hyperexcitability. Objective To determine the prevalence ratio of parents with chronic <b>hyperventilation</b> <b>syndrome</b> between two groups of children with and without febrile convulsion. Methods A cross-sectional design study was used, with a tertiary hospital setting (Kariadi Hospital). Participants were selected consecutively based on eligibility criteria. Febrile convulsion was diagnosed based on a modified Livingstone criteria. Chronic <b>hyperventilation</b> <b>syndrome</b> in parents was determined using the clinical diagnostic test of spasmophilia (88. 4 % sensitivity and 6 1. 6 % specificity). Statistical calculations were conducted with two by two table analysis and within the 95 % confidence interval. Results Sixty-two children (mean age 18 months) who met the eligibility criteria were included. The parents' mean ages were 33 years (father) and 29 years (mother). The prevalence ratio of father, mother and both parents with chronic hyperventilation between the febrile convulsion group and the non-febrile convulsion group were 2. 56 (95 % CI 0. 53 to 12. 31), 6. 19 (95 % CI 1. 70 to 22. 6) and 18. 7 (95 % CI 3. 07 to 113. 9), respectively.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{identify}} the style of parental bonding and the personality characteristics that might increase the risk of hyperventilation and adjustment disorder. Methods A total of 917 males were recruited, 156 with adjustment disorder and <b>hyperventilation</b> <b>syndrome</b> (AD[*]+[*]HY), 273 with adjustment disorder without <b>hyperventilation</b> <b>syndrome</b> (AD–HY), and 488 healthy controls. All participants completed the Parental Bonding Instrument, Eysenck Personality Questionnaire, and Chinese Health Questionnaire. Results Analysis using structural equation models identified a pathway relationship in which parental bonding affected personality characteristics, personality characteristics affected mental health condition, and mental health condition affected the development of hyperventilation or adjustment disorder. Males with AD–HY perceived less paternal care, and those with AD[*]+[*]HY perceived more maternal protection than those with adjustment disorder and those in the control group. Participants with AD–HY were more neurotic and less extroverted than those with AD[*]+[*]HY. Both groups showed poorer mental health than the controls. Conclusions Although some patients with <b>hyperventilation</b> <b>syndrome</b> demonstrated symptoms of adjustment disorder, there were different predisposing factors between the two groups in terms of parental bonding and personality characteristics.

40|$|Summary-Research is {{reviewed}} {{which suggests}} that <b>hyperventilation</b> <b>syndrome</b> is an underdiagnosed disorder for the presentation of many patients experiencing apparent anxiety states. In a test of this hypothesis, 21 normal individuals (9 female) underwent a 2 min period of intentional hyperventilation following a 10 min baseline phase. Hyperventilation was accompanied by increased subjective anxiety and tachycardia, and indications of peripheral vasoconstriction. Following hyperventilation, Ss experienced increased levels of state anxiety and perceived autonomic arousal, as indexed by self-report instruments. These results {{support the hypothesis that}} undiagnosed hyperventilatory phenomena may be etiologically implicated in states of pathologic anxiety. INTRODIJCIION In recent years, it has become increasingly evident that patients apparently suffering from anxiety states are actually experiencing symptoms econdary to hyperventilation (Lum, 1975; Campemolle, Hoogduin and Joelle, 1979). The reported incidence of <b>hyperventilation</b> <b>syndrome</b> has been estimated to range from 6 to 10 % of patients seen by medical specialists (Lum, 1977) and the syndrome is characterized by a broad spectrum of physiological and psychological effects similar to those experienced by patients with Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Panic Disorder or Agoraphobia (American Psychiatric Association, 1980).
