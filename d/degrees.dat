5|$|The {{equatorial}} ring {{goes around}} {{the belly of the}} armillary sphere 91 and 5/19 (<b>degrees)</b> away from the pole. The circle of the ecliptic also goes round the belly of the instrument at an angle of 24 (<b>degrees)</b> with the equator. Thus at the summer solstice the ecliptic is 67 (<b>degrees)</b> and a fraction away from the pole, while at the winter solstice it is 115 (<b>degrees)</b> and a fraction away. Hence (the points) where the ecliptic and the equator intersect should give the north polar distances of the spring and autumn equinoxes. But now (it has been recorded that) the spring equinox is 90 and 1/4 (<b>degrees)</b> away from the pole, and the autumn equinox is 92 and 1/4 (<b>degrees)</b> away. The former figure is adopted only because it agrees with the (results obtained by the) method of measuring solstitial sun shadows as embodied in the Xia (dynasty) calendar.|$|E

5|$|In its {{simplest}} {{form the}} star compass describes 32 points at which key stars rise {{on the eastern}} horizon and set on the western horizon. North latitude is fairly easy to determine because the North Pole has a zenith star easily seen with the naked eye, called Polaris (Wuliwulifasmughet). Polaris' height above the horizon indicates the viewer's southward displacement from Polaris' nadir, he North Pole. When one travels further north, Polaris appears higher in the sky. Only at the true north pole is Polaris directly overhead at nearly 90 <b>degrees</b> altitude. When one travels south toward the equator, Polaris appears to descend toward the northern horizon. At 45 <b>degrees</b> north latitude, Polaris is 45 <b>degrees</b> above the northern horizon. Near the equator, Polaris' altitude approaches zero <b>degrees,</b> but for the viewer just further south, Polaris will have disappeared below the northern horizon.|$|E
