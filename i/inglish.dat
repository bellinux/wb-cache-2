5000|$|Bonham, one of {{the oldest}} cities in Texas, dates back to 1837 when Bailey <b>Inglish</b> built a two-story {{blockhouse}} named Fort <b>Inglish.</b> It was located about 2 mi from the current downtown. <b>Inglish</b> and other acquaintances settled there in the summer of 1837, and the settlement was named [...] "Bois D'Arc". In 1843, the Congress of the Republic of Texas assigned the name [...] "Bloomington" [...] to the city, but finally renamed it [...] "Bonham", in honor of James Butler Bonham, a hero and defender of the Alamo. On February 2, 1848, Bonham was incorporated as a city. A 1936 statue of Bonham by Texas sculptor Allie Tennant graces the courthouse grounds.|$|E
5000|$|In a mixed review, Michael O'Donnell of XXL {{gave the}} album an [...] "L", saying [...] "The 'Cool Kids' {{had a very}} {{distinct}} sound {{and it would have}} been easy for <b>Inglish</b> to retread his past. While he clearly still draws from what got him here, it's good seeing him reaching for a new sound, not wanting to be boxed into a particular style. The album, while slightly unfocused, does have its moments, and <b>Inglish</b> in particular, has revealed himself to be an artist to keep an eye on going forward." [...] Pitchfork reviewer Renato Pagnani gave the album a 6.0 out of ten, saying [...] "Because of this inherent charm, Convertibles ends up a low-stakes affair without being a low-quality one. And when you think about it, that's a pretty fair description of <b>Inglish</b> as an artist." [...] In a less enthusiastic review, Matthew Davies of This Is Fake DIY gave the album two stars out five, saying [...] "All things considered Chuck <b>Inglish</b> hasn't offered enough that's new or high quality enough to truly make a mark." ...|$|E

50|$|Judge William E. Jones {{determined}} {{that there were}} two questions to answer. First, did <b>Inglish</b> qualify for land under Republic law or constitution. Second, if not, did he qualify under Mexican law.|$|E
5000|$|Jones first {{noted that}} <b>Inglish</b> died {{prior to the}} Texas Declaration of Independence. Since Texas was not an {{independent}} nation {{at the time of}} his death, he could not obtain title to land or a grant of land on that basis. [...] By the same token, the laws of the Mexican state of Coahuila y Texas prohibited any new colonization and concurrent grant of land after May 2, 1835. [...] Jones noted that <b>Inglish</b> entered after the Mexican law cut off new property grants and died before Texas could grant land. He further noted that this was not for the courts to remedy, but was up to the legislative branch.|$|E
5000|$|The second single was [...] "Oil Money", {{featuring}} Chuck <b>Inglish,</b> Chip tha Ripper, Bun B & Dan Auerbach, and {{was released}} on July 20, 2010. A music video was released for the single on September 8, 2010.|$|E
