5|$|In 2008, Ivakhnenko {{included}} the Akidnognathidae (as the Euchambersiidae) as the sister {{group of the}} family Whaitsiidae in the superfamily Whaitsioidea. However, other researchers <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>include</b> <b>the</b> Akidnognathidae in the Whaitsioidea. Phylogenies by Huttenlocker et al. found that the Akidnognathidae was instead closest to the Chthonosauridae, with the two forming the sister group to the group containing the Whaitsioidea and the Baurioidea. The topology recovered by the 2016 analysis of Huttenlocker et al. is shown below.|$|E
