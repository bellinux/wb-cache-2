5|$|Yuri Andropov {{appointed}} Ryzhkov {{head of the}} <b>Economic</b> <b>Department</b> of the Central Committee {{where he}} was responsible for overseeing major planning and financial organs, excluding industry. As head of the department he reported directly to Mikhail Gorbachev and as head of the Central Committee's <b>Economic</b> <b>Department</b> he met with Andropov once a week. Ryzhkov became convinced that had Andropov lived at least another five years, the Soviet Union would have seen a reform package similar to that implemented in the People's Republic of China. During Konstantin Chernenko's short rule, both Ryzhkov and Gorbachev elaborated several reform measures, sometimes in the face of opposition from Chernenko.|$|E
5|$|With {{strong support}} from Ryzhkov, Gorbachev {{abolished}} the Central Committee <b>economic</b> <b>department,</b> thereby strengthening the authority of central government over economic matters. From then on, the government could not be blamed for economic policies initiated by the Party leadership. The establishment of the post of President of the Soviet Union by Gorbachev in 1990 weakened {{the power of the}} government apparatus; a move Ryzhkov and his second cabinet opposed.|$|E

In this paper, an {{advanced}} economic method is {{proposed in the}} measurement about water resources efficient (WRE), {{which is based on}} the social cycle of water resources in different <b>economic</b> <b>departments</b> and different areas. The advances of this research are as following: firstly, WRE from the economic perspective emphasizes thesocial traits of water resources which are the bases of the value of water resources; secondly, research on WRE from the economic perspective gives the special link between water resources and economy; thirdly, because the usages of water resources in different <b>economic</b> <b>departments</b> and areas are various, the measurements of China’s WRE are run by different <b>economic</b> <b>departments</b> and various areas, and then the advance analysis are proposed. According to the research, the WRE and agricultural & industrial WRE of each province of China are calculated, and the WRE and industrial WRE decrease while agricultural WRE increase during 2001 ~ 2010...|$|R

We also document novelties in ranking-construction such as sensitivity analysis, parallel rankings, instant updates and journal weights based on impact-adjusted impact factors. citation analysis, ranking <b>economic</b> <b>departments,</b> journal ranking...|$|R

25|$|The WJC has evinced a great {{interest}} in Poland, both before the war, when the country was home to some 3.25 million Jews (10 percent of that country's total population, forming the largest Jewish community in Europe); and in the post-war period, when the Jewish community was reconstituted. In second half of the 1930s, {{in the face of a}} marked rise in antisemitism, the WJC attempted to intervene on behalf of Polish Jewry. In December 1936, for example, Nahum Goldmann visited Poland and conferred with the Minister of Foreign Affairs Jozef Beck, but this demarche did little to abate the situation. In order to counter the drastic affects of the ban on kosher slaughter (Shechita), the WJC <b>Economic</b> <b>Department</b> prepared a study on the legislation and proposed various relief measures that could be instituted. The WJC also intervened to ensure that Polish Jews deported from Germany at the end of October 1938 and stranded in Zbaszyn would be allowed to resettle elsewhere in Poland.|$|E

[...] While only 6% of economic historians who worked in the history department of their universities agreed with the statement, 27% of those that work in the economics department agreed. Almost an identical percent of the two groups (21% and 22%) agreed with the statement [...] "with provisos" [...] (a conditional stipulation), while 74% of those who worked in the history department, and 51% in the <b>economic</b> <b>department,</b> disagreed with the statement outright.|$|E
2500|$|The Faculty of Law became Faculty of Law and Economics when an <b>economic</b> <b>department</b> was {{introduced}} in 1905. In 1912, Otto Jaekel, a professor of paleontology in Greifswald, founded the German Paleontological Society. The Department of Modern Languages was established in 1853.

In searching for additional sources of revenue and funding, government agencies saw monetary value in religious and historical monuments {{that had not yet}} been destroyed or otherwise repurposed for government use. On 24 February 1930, the <b>economic</b> <b>department</b> of the OGPU {{sent a letter to the}} Chairman of the Central Executive Committee asking to remove the golden domes of the Christ the Saviour Cathedral.

2500|$|Andropov {{was elected}} the party's General Secretary on 12 November 1982 by a {{decision}} of the Central Committee. The Central Committee meeting was held less than 24 hours after the announcement of Brezhnev's death. A.R. Judson Mitchell claims that the Central Committee meeting which elected Andropov as General Secretary, {{was little more than}} a rubber stamp meeting. Andropov was in a good position to take over the control of the party apparatus; three big system hierarchs, Brezhnev, Kosygin and Suslov had all died. A fourth, Kirilenko, was forced into retirement. At the Central Committee meeting of 22 November 1982, Kirilenko lost his membership in the Politburo (after a decision within the Politburo itself), and Nikolai Ryzhkov, the Deputy Chairman of the State Planning Committee, was elected to the Secretariat. Ryzhkov became the Head of the <b>Economic</b> <b>Department</b> of the Central Committee, and became the leading Central Committee member on matters regarding economic planning. Shortly afterwards, Ryzhkov, after replacing Vladimir Dolgikh, began to oversee the civilian economy. At [...] the 14–15 June 1983 Central Committee meeting, Vitaly Vorotnikov was elected as a candidate member of the Politburo, Grigory Romanov was elected to the Secretariat and five members of the Central Committee were given full membership. The election of Romanov in the Secretariat, weakened Chernenko's control considerably. Later, Yegor Ligachev was appointed as Head of the Party Organisational Work Department of the Central Committee. Certain Brezhnev appointees were kept, such as Viktor Chebrikov and Nikolai Savinkin. With these appointments, Andropov effectively wielded the powers of the nomenklatura. Even so, by the time he had succeeded in dominating the Central Committee, Andropov fell ill. He was unable to attend the annual parade celebrating the victory of the October Revolution. Chernenko, the official second-ranking secretary, competed for power with Mikhail Gorbachev. The meetings of the Central Committee and the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union were postponed to the last possible moment because of Andropov's health. Changes continued however, and the Andropov appointees continued Andropov's course of introducing new blood into the Central Committee and Party apparatus. Vorotnikov and Mikhail Solomentsev were given full membership in the Politburo, Chebrikov was elected a candidate member of the Politburo and Ligachev became a member of the Secretariat. Chernenko's position began to look precarious; Gorbachev was getting stronger by the day. Four days after Andropov's death, on 9 February 1984, Chernenko was elected as the party's General Secretary.|$|E
