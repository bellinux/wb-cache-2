5|$|As a freelancer, Langan {{developed}} {{three more}} episodes of <b>I</b> <b>Saw</b> <b>You</b> for Granada. Her only other project was producing David Nicholls' romantic comedy series Rescue Me with Tiger Aspect Productions for BBC One. As well as producing it, {{she made her}} credited directorial debut on the final episode. The six-part series, starring Sally Phillips, was broadcast in 2002. It was not a ratings success, and the BBC did not commission a second series.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, Ripley {{was cast}} in her {{breakthrough}} role of Jenny Gifford in the ITV series Cold Feet. Initially a supporting role in the pilot episode, Ripley's character was expanded when a series was commissioned in 1998. She stayed with the show for three full series before leaving to take more varied roles and {{to spend more time}} with her family. She returned for a guest appearance in the fifth series. After leaving Cold Feet, Ripley played a succession of leading roles in comedies and dramas including Green-Eyed Monster (2001), <b>I</b> <b>Saw</b> <b>You</b> (2002), The Stretford Wives (2002), and Dead Gorgeous (2002). Each role won her critical acclaim. In 2006, she filmed a leading role in the ITV drama Bon Voyage, before taking time away from acting after the birth of her second child. Ripley returned to television in 2009, starring as human resources manager Christine Frances in the ITV comedy drama Monday Monday, and Nicola Perrin alongside Martin Clunes in BBC One's Reggie Perrin.|$|E
500|$|In 2000, Ripley {{appeared}} in the British dogme film The Announcement, as well as playing lead female character Grace Bingley—opposite Paul Rhys—in the Granada television pilot <b>I</b> <b>Saw</b> <b>You,</b> which used {{many of the same}} production staff as Cold Feet. David Belcher of The Herald called Ripley [...] "perfectly scatty, tousled and self-sufficient" [...] in the role, and Joe Joseph of The Times complimented her comic timing. Ripley returned to <b>I</b> <b>Saw</b> <b>You</b> for a three-episode miniseries in 2002. She considers <b>I</b> <b>Saw</b> <b>You,</b> in which she acted alongside her husband Daniel Lapaine, the television show she is most proud to have worked on.|$|E

[...] What will there be between us old codgers, aside of course from happy memories of skiing tours in the long distant past ... Will you come to me mainly to take receipt of the promised gift I have held for you in our cellar—that long cured Westphalian ham, and those patiently waiting bottles of your favorite nectar: Johannisberger 1937? [...] Could these things of the senses end up being all that there is between us? [...] I am so happy that the moment approaches, but my heart is heavy..." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1999, Langan {{was made}} an {{executive}} producer in the department. She oversaw several productions, including Passion Killers (1999, starring Ben Miller), Safe as Houses (2000, starring Ricky Tomlinson), {{and the pilot}} episode of David Nicholls' <b>I</b> <b>Saw</b> <b>You</b> (2000, starring Paul Rhys and Fay Ripley). In 2000, Langan was offered a position at the BBC's drama department, which had been rearranged that year. The trade magazine Broadcast reported the BBC had made a [...] "substantial offer" [...] to her. Granada's director of programmes Grant Mansfield countered the BBC's bid by offering Langan the position of deputy controller of drama, operating under Andy Harries, who had recently been appointed controller of the same department. Langan accepted neither offer, and instead became a freelance producer after her contract with Granada expired.|$|E

500|$|On October 1, 2007 {{while walking}} in Boston Common, Simon Glik {{observed}} an arrest by Boston police officers John Cunniffe, Peter Savalis, and Jerome Hall-Brewster. Glik began recording the arrest after {{he heard a}} bystander say [...] "ou are hurting him, stop". Because Glik was concerned that the officers were using excessive force, he filmed the encounter with his cell phone. Although Glik was 10 feet away and was not interfering with the arrest, {{one of the officers}} turned to him after placing handcuffs on the suspect and said [...] "I think you have taken enough pictures". Glik replied that he was recording the incident; he said, [...] "I am recording this. <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>you</b> punch him". When the officer determined that this included audio, he placed Glik under arrest for violating the Massachusetts wiretapping law.|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, [...] "Beautiful Liar" [...] {{speaks about}} {{two women who}} chose not to end a {{friendship}} because {{of a man who}} has cheated both of them. Its theme is one of female independence. Beyoncé told MTV News that [...] "Beautiful Liar" [...] is about female empowerment, in keeping with the theme of the album: [...] "It's about a guy who's kind of playing both of us, and instead of us arguing over the guy we say, 'Forget him. Let's stick together. He's a beautiful liar." [...] The chorus features the lines, [...] "Let's not kill the karma, let's not start a fight" [...] with the female protagonists bonding in their mutual betrayal. Beyoncé and Shakira sing with staccato, intense vocal approach throughout the song. Beyoncé sings the lines [...] "I didn't know about you then, till <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>you</b> with him again" [...] earnestly while Shakira later adds [...] "I walked in on your love scene, slow dancing". In the end, the female protagonists conclude, [...] "we can live without him", referring to their cheating lover.|$|E
500|$|Williams and Barlow {{performed}} [...] "Shame" [...] for {{the first}} time on 12 September 2010 at the Help for Heroes concert held in London. On 2 October the duo sang the song at the series eight of the Strictly Come Dancing. A Metro newspaper critic reviewed the performance and wrote, [...] "the pair, wearing matching black suits, spent much of the early stages of their performance sitting on stools and gazing into each other’s eyes as they sung the duet." [...] On 7 October, Williams and Barlow were chatting at the BBC Radio 1 where they gave a performance of the song. The singers were guests at the Paul O'Grady Live chat show and also performed the single on 8 October. Three days after, on 11 October, they gave a rendition of the track on the morning television programme, Daybreak. On 18 November the pair performed the song on the German reality TV programme, [...] Barlow included [...] "Shame" [...] on the set list of his 2014 tour, Since <b>I</b> <b>Saw</b> <b>You</b> Last, where he performed a solo acoustic version of the song.|$|E

500|$|By 2001, Arulpragasam {{designed}} the cover for Elastica's last single [...] "The Bitch Don't Work", {{and went on}} the road with the band to video document their tour. The tour's supporting act, electroclash artist Peaches, introduced Arulpragasam to the Roland MC-505 and encouraged her to make music, a medium in which Arulpragasam lacked confidence. While holidaying together in Bequia in the Caribbean, Arulpragasam began experimenting with Frischmann's MC-505. She adopted her stage name, [...] "M.I.A.", standing for [...] "Missing In Acton" [...] during this time. In her 2012 book Arulpragasam writes, [...] "M.I.A. came to be because of my missing cousin. I wanted to make a film about where he was since he was M.I.A. (Missing in Action) in Sri Lanka. We were the same age, went to the same schools growing up. I was also living in Acton at the time. So I was living in Acton looking for my cousin missing in action." [...] Of her time in Bequia, she told [...] "I started going out to this chicken shed with a sound system. You buy rum through a hatch and dance in the street. They convinced me to come to church where people sing so amazingly. But I couldn’t clap along to hallelujah. I was out of rhythm. Someone said, ‘What happened to Jesus? <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>you</b> dancing last night and you were totally fine.’ They stopped the service and taught me to clap in time. It was embarrassing". Returning to West London, where she shared an apartment with Frischmann, she began working with a simple set-up (a second-hand 4-track tape machine, the MC-505, and a radio microphone), composing and recording a six-song demo tape that included [...] "Lady Killa", [...] "M.I.A.", and [...] "Galang".|$|E

2500|$|The very {{structure}} of American entertainment bears minstrelsy's imprint. The endless barrage of gags and puns {{appears in the}} work of the Marx Brothers and David and Jerry Zucker. The varied {{structure of}} songs, gags, [...] "hokum" [...] and dramatic pieces continued into vaudeville, variety shows, and to modern sketch comedy shows such as Hee Haw or, more distantly, Saturday Night Live and In Living Color. Jokes once delivered by endmen are still told today: [...] "Why did the chicken cross the road?" [...] "Why does a fireman wear red suspenders?" [...] Other jokes form part of the repertoire of modern comedians: [...] "Who was that lady <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>you</b> with last night? That was no lady—that was my wife!"
