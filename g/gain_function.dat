Existing schemes derive <b>gain</b> <b>functions</b> analyt-ically based on distributional assumptions {{with respect to the}} speech (and noise) DFT coefficients and on mathemat-ically tractable distortion measures. In this paper we pro-pose a methodology to estimate the MMSE <b>gain</b> <b>functions</b> directly from speech signals, without assuming that speech DFT coefficients follow a certain parametrized probability density function. Furthermore, the proposed scheme allows for estimation of MMSE <b>gain</b> <b>functions</b> for pdf/distortion measure combinations for which no analytical solutions are known. Simulation experiments where noisy speech is en-hanced using the estimated <b>gain</b> <b>functions</b> show promising results. Specifically, the estimated <b>gain</b> <b>functions</b> perform better than standard schemes, as measured by a range of ob-jective speech quality criteria. 1...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—A hybrid {{computational}} method between sum of squares (SOS) and quantifier elimination (QE) is discussed for {{a problem of}} nonlinear gain analysis. A computational procedure is proposed {{to be applied to}} nonlinear polynomial systems. The procedure takes two major parts: the first part is searching a structure in the <b>gain</b> <b>functions</b> while the second part reveals all the <b>gain</b> <b>functions</b> in the structure. These tasks are assigned to the SOS and QE approaches, respectively. In order to find an accurate system performance, the <b>gain</b> <b>functions</b> are optimized in the procedure. The proposed analysis procedure is illustrated for a few systems. I...|$|R

When some decision-making units (DMUs) face higher input prices than other DMUs, the Farrell decomposition of cost efficiency can potentially indicate that a firm with lower overall costs of production is less efficient than a firm that uses fewer physical inputs, but has higher costs. We extend our <b>gain</b> <b>functions</b> accounting for cases where DMUs face different input prices.

40|$|In dynamic surface control (DSC) methods, {{the control}} <b>gain</b> <b>functions</b> of systems are always {{assumed to be}} bounded, which is a {{restrictive}} assumption. This work proposes a novel DSC approach for an extended class of strict-feedback nonlinear systems whose control <b>gain</b> <b>functions</b> are continuous and possibly unbounded. Appropriate compact sets are constructed {{in such a way}} that the trajectories of the closed-loop system do not leave these sets, therefore, in these sets, maximums and minimums values of the continuous control <b>gain</b> <b>functions</b> are well defined even if the control <b>gain</b> <b>functions</b> are possibly unbounded. By using Lyapunov theory and invariant set theory, semi-globally uniformly ultimately boundedness is analytically proved: all the signals of closed-loop system will always stay in these compact sets, while the tracking error is shown to converge to a residual set that can be made as small as desired by adjusting design parameters appropriately. Finally, the effectiveness of the designed method is demonstrated via two examples. Accepted Author ManuscriptHybrid, Adaptive and Nonlinea...|$|R

40|$|Recently, a modular {{organisation}} {{has been}} proposed to simplify control of {{the large number of}} muscles involved in human walking. Although previous research indicates that a single set of modular activation patterns can account for muscle activity at different speeds, these studies only provide indirect evidence for the idea that speed regulation in human walking is under modular control. Here, a more direct approach was taken to assess the synergistic structure that underlies speed regulation, by isolating speed effects through the construction of <b>gain</b> <b>functions</b> that represent the linear relation between speed and amplitude for each point in the time-normalized gait cycle. The activity of 13 muscles in 13 participants was measured at 4 speeds (0. 69, 1. 00, 1. 31, and 1. 61 ms(- 1)) during treadmill walking. <b>Gain</b> <b>functions</b> were constructed for each of the muscles, and <b>gain</b> <b>functions</b> and the activity patterns at 1. 00 ms(- 1) were both subjected to dimensionality reduction, to obtain modular <b>gain</b> <b>functions</b> and modular basis functions, respectively. The results showed that 4 components captured most {{of the variance in the}} <b>gain</b> <b>functions</b> (74. 0 % +/- 1. 3 %), suggesting that the neuromuscular regulation of speed is under modular control. Correlations between modular <b>gain</b> <b>functions</b> and modular basis functions (range 0. 58 - 0. 89) and the associated synergistic muscle weightings (range 0. 6 - 0. 95) were generally high, suggesting substantial overlap in the synergistic control of the basic phasing of muscle activity and its modulation through speed. Finally, the combined set of modular functions and associated weightings were well capable of predicting muscle activity patterns obtained at a speed (1. 31 ms(- 1)) that was not involved in the initial dimensionality reduction, confirming the robustness of the presently used approach. Taken together, these findings provide direct evidence of synergistic structure in speed regulation, and may inspire further work on flexibility in the modular control of gait...|$|R

This concept of stability denotes {{that the state}} of the interconnection remains bounded for sufficiently small input and initial conditions, but it does not tend to zero for zero input.

Deviations relative to the standard CRF, i. e., <b>gain</b> <b>functions,</b> describe the strength of signal enhancement, which were assessed for both changes due to attentional task and conscious perception. It was found that attention displayed a response-gain function, whereas consciousness displayed a contrast-gain function. Through model comparisons, which only included contrast-gain modulations, both contrast-gain and response-gain effects can be explained with a two-level normalization model, in which consciousness affects only the first level and attention affects only the second level. These results demonstrate that attention and consciousness can effectively show different <b>gain</b> <b>functions</b> because they operate through different signal enhancement mechanisms...|$|R
