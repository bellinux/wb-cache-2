5|$|<b>I</b> <b>never</b> {{warmed up}} ten, fifteen minutes {{before a game}} like most {{pitchers}} do. I'd loosen up, three, four minutes. Five at the outside. And <b>I</b> <b>never</b> went to the bullpen. Oh, I'd relieve all right, plenty of times, but I went right from the bench to the box, and I'd take a few warm-up pitches and be ready. Then I had good control. I aimed to make the batter hit the ball, and I threw as few pitches as possible. That's why I was able to work every other day.|$|E
5|$|I did not {{interfere}} {{in any way}} with the dispositions made by the police authorities on the spot. <b>I</b> <b>never</b> overruled those authorities nor overrode them.

5|$|I {{liked them}} both {{because they were}} ironic and provocative {{at the same time}} but also unlike me.

Fanning claimed: In fact I so never moved that instead I brought the four people who were working with me for Radio One and their desks into 2FM! <b>I</b> <b>never</b> went over to Radio One, I did all my programmes from 2FM, <b>I</b> <b>never</b> moved.
