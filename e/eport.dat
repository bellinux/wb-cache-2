40|$|Background a nd A ims: D ilation of stenosing EosinophilicEsophagitis (EoE) is {{considered}} a high-risk procedure asperforation rates o f up to 9 % of patients h ave been reported. Goal: To systematically e valuate the dilation-associatedperforation risk in stenosing EoE. Methods: A systematic {{review of the literature}} was performedusing pubmed and Embase. Keywords used were "eosinophilicesophagitis", "dilation", "perforation", and "complications". Results: F rom 2002 to 2007 7 case s eries including 85 patients r <b>eported</b> perforations i n 5 patients (perforation r ate 6 %). The highest perforation rate was reported in a series of 36 patients d ocumenting 3 perforations (9 %). In 2 010 and 2011 three large studies r <b>eporting</b> o n a total o f 404 patientsdocumented a perforation in 3 patients (0. 74 %). The perforationrate reported in small case series before 2010 was significantlyhigher compared to the r ates since 2 010 (P < 0. 001). Theoverall p erforation frequency is 8 / 489 patients (1. 6 %). Amedian of 3 endoscopic sessions with dilations were performedper patient, thereby leading to a perforation rate of 0. 53 % perendoscopy.

Conclusions: D ilation of stenosing EoE h as a m uch lowerperforation risk as r <b>eported</b> in e arlier c ase series.

5000|$|Soils form an {{essential}} basis for humanity, but have received too {{little attention to}} date. In differing respects, human activities {{in many parts of}} the world lead to various levels of soil degradation, from declining fertility to irreversible destruction. Many local processes cumulate to form a global environmental trend that must be counteracted by political action as a matter of urgency. The fact that the slow destruction of soils is a process barely perceptible to human senses has meant in turn that this topic is dealt with in the environmental debate as a somewhat marginal issue. Therefore, the threat to soils must be accorded much greater significance on the environmental agenda - improved legal frameworks must be created, both nationally and internationally, for soils as an environmental asset. This <b>eport</b> is divided into two sections. The first section (standard section) presents and comments on new developments in various fields of Global Change. The second section of the report (focus section) deals with the global threat to soils. The WBGU emphasises that, in view of the seriousness of the soil problems outlined in this report, a new efficient institutional framework should now be established. For this reason the German Federal Government should decide in principle whether a differentiated [...] "Soil Declaration" [...] suffices or whether a global [...] "Soil Convention" [...] has to be striven for. This report provides the relevant arguments for both instruments. Global soil protection must obtain a similar attention on the international agenda as has been achieved for climate policy.|$|E
40|$|Abstract As {{the total}} amount of {{international}} trade around the world keeps increasing, the pressure of cross-border operations in terminals, such as sea ports, becomes more and more obvious. In order to meet these needs and improve the efficiency of import and export clearance, trade facilitation {{is one of the most}} prevalent and effective solutions recommended by many scholars and researchers recently. Port Community Systems, Single Windows and other similar electronic trade systems are crucial approaches to achieve the targets of trade facilitation. China, as one of the largest import and export countries in the world, has paid special attention on the efficiency of its cross-border operations for decades. Hence, the China <b>ePort,</b> Port Community System in China, plays a key role in the trade facilitation of China. The Ningbo <b>ePort,</b> one branch of the China <b>ePort,</b> has its own characteristics, since Ningbo Port is the third largest container port and the Ningbo Customs deals with large amount of import and export clearance operations every year. This dissertation based on the existing theoretical bases and successful cases around the world, takes the Ningbo <b>ePort</b> as an example to explore the current operations of port community systems in the context of China. Moreover, the author also collects the feedbacks, which include the costs, benefits, constraints and suggestions of adopting the <b>ePort,</b> from trade companies by one-to-one interviews. Lastly, compare and contrast are used in discussing the results and materials collected...|$|E
