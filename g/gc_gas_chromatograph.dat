Modern analytical technique referred to as hyphenated techniques, originate from the traditional use of molecule or element specific detection in electrophoresis or chromatography. Currently the most common techniques for trace element speciation include a combination of separation technique coupled with a detection technique that is more sensitive. Earlier such hyphenated techniques were the coupling of separation of a special sample preparation off-line and later adding a detection technique. Presently, the hyphenated technique is developed from the coupling of a separation technique (Chromatography) and an on-line spectroscopic detection technology. Hyphenated techniques combine chromatographic and spectral methods to exploit the advantages of both. Chromatography produces pure or nearly pure fractions of chemical components in a mixture. Spectroscopy produces selective information for identification using standards or library spectra. These hyphenated techniques offer shorter analysis time, higher degree of automation, higher sample throughput, better reproducibility, reduction of contamination because it is a closed system, Enhanced combined selectivity and therefore higher degree of information. The remarkable improvements in hyphenated analytical methods {{over the last two decades}} have significantly broadened their applications in the analysis of biomaterials, especially natural products. In this article, recent advances in the applications of various hyphenated techniques, e. g., GC-MS, LC-MS, LC-FTIR, LC-NMR, CE-MS, etc. in the context of pre-isolation analyses of crude extracts or fraction from various natural sources, isolation and on-line detection of natural products, chemotaxonomic studies, chemical fingerprinting, quality control of herbal products, dereplication of natural products, and metabolomic studies are discussed with appropriate examples...|$|E
40|$|A recent {{emphasis}} in gasification technology {{development has been}} directed toward reduced-scale gasifier systems for distributed generation at remote sites. The domestic distributed power generation market {{over the next decade}} is expected to be 5 - 6 gigawatts per year. The global increase is expected at 20 gigawatts over the next decade. The economics of gasification for distributed power generation are significantly improved when fuel transport is minimized. Until recently, gasification technology has been synonymous with coal conversion. Presently, however, interest centers on providing clean-burning fuel to remote sites that are not necessarily near coal supplies but have sufficient alternative carbonaceous material to feed a small gasifier. Gasifiers up to 50 MW are of current interest, with emphasis on those of 5 -MW generating capacity. Internal combustion engines offer a more robust system for utilizing the fuel gas, while fuel cells and microturbines offer higher electric conversion efficiencies. The initial focus of this multiyear effort was on internal combustion engines and microturbines as more realistic near-term options for distributed generation. In this project, we studied emerging gasification technologies that can provide gas from regionally available feedstock as fuel to power generators under 30 MW in a distributed generation setting. Larger-scale gasification, primarily coal-fed, has been used commercially for more than 50 years to produce clean synthesis gas for the refining, chemical, and power industries. Commercial-scale gasification activities are under way at 113 sites in 22 countries in North and South America, Europe, Asia, Africa, and Australia, according to the Gasification Technologies Council. Gasification studies were carried out on alfalfa, black liquor (a high-sodium waste from the pulp industry), cow manure, and willow on the laboratory scale and on alfalfa, black liquor, and willow on the bench scale. Initial parametric tests evaluated through reactivity and product composition were carried out on thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) equipment. These tests were evaluated and then followed by bench-scale studies at 1123 K using an integrated bench-scale fluidized-bed gasifier (IBG) which can be operated in the semicontinuous batch mode. Products from tests were solid (ash), liquid (tar), and gas. Tar was separated on an open chromatographic column. Analysis of the gas product was carried out using on-line Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). For selected tests, gas was collected periodically and analyzed using a refinery gas analyzer <b>GC</b> (<b>gas</b> <b>chromatograph).</b> The solid product was not extensively analyzed. This report is a part of a search into emerging gasification technologies that can provide power under 30 MW in a distributed generation setting. Larger-scale gasification has been used commercially for more than 50 years to produce clean synthesis gas for the refining, chemical, and power industries, and it is probable that scaled-down applications for use in remote areas will become viable. The appendix to this report contains a list, description, and sources of currently available gasification technologies that could be or are being commercially applied for distributed generation. This list was gathered from current sources and provides information about the supplier, the relative size range, and the status of the technology...|$|E
40|$|The prior project {{consisted}} of two main project lines. First, characterization of novel nanomaterials for hydrodesulfurization (HDS) applications. Second, studying more traditional model systems for HDS such as vapor-deposited silica-supported Mo and MoSx clusters. In the first subproject, we studied WS 2 and MoS 2 fullerene-like nanoparticles as well as WS 2 nanotubes. Thiophene (C 4 H 4 S) {{was used as the}} probe molecule. Interestingly, metallic and sulfur-like adsorption sites could be identified on the silica-supported fullerene-particles system. Similar structures are seen for the traditional system (vapor-deposited clusters). Thus, this may be a kinetics fingerprint feature of modern HDS model systems. In addition, kinetics data allowed characterization of the different adsorption sites for thiophene on and inside WS 2 nanotube bundles. The latter is a unique feature of nanotubes that has not been reported before for any inorganic nanotube system; however, examples are known for carbon nanotubes, including prior work of the PI. Although HDS has been studied for decades, utilizing nanotubes as nanosized HDS reactors has never been tried before, as far as we know. This is of interest from a fundamental perspective. Unfortunately, the HDS activity of the nanocatalysts at ultra-high vacuum (UHV) conditions was close to the detection limit of our techniques. Therefore, we propose to run experiments at ambient pressure on related nanopowder samples as part of the renewal application utilizing a now-available <b>GC</b> (<b>gas</b> <b>chromatograph)</b> setup. In addition, Ni and Co doped nanocatalyts are proposed for study. These dopants will boost the catalytic activity. In the second subproject of the prior grant, we studied HDS-related chemistry on more traditional supported cluster catalysts. Mo clusters supported by physical vapor deposition (PVD) on silica have been characterized. Two reaction pathways are evident when adsorbing thiophene on Mo and MoSx clusters: molecular adsorption and dissociation. PVD Mo clusters turned out to be very reactive toward thiophene bond activation. Sulfur and carbon residuals form, which poison the catalyst and sulfide the Mo clusters. Sulfided silica-supported MoSx samples are not reactive toward thiophene bond activation. In addition to S and C deposits, H 2, H 2 S, and small organic molecules were detected in the gas phase. Catalyst reactivation procedures, including O 2 and atomic hydrogen treatments, have been tested. Cluster size effects have been seen: thiophene adsorbs molecularly with larger binding energies on smaller clusters. However, larger clusters have smaller activation energy for C 4 H 4 S bond activation than smaller clusters. The latter is consistent with early catalysis studies. Kinetics and dynamics parameters have been determined quantitatively. We spent a significant amount of time on upgrades of our equipment. A 2 nd-hand refurbished X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS) has been integrated into the existing molecular beam scattering system and is already operational (supported by the DoE supplemental grant available in October 2009). We also added a time of flight (TOF) system to the beam scattering apparatus and improved on the accessible impact energy range (new nozzle heater and gas mixing manifold) for the beam scattering experiments. In addition, a GC-based powder atmospheric flow reactor for studies on powder samples is now operational. Furthermore, a 2 nd UHV kinetics system has been upgraded as well. In summary, mostly single crystal systems have so far been considered in basic science studies about HDS. Industrial catalysts, however, can be better approximated with the supported cluster systems that we studied in this project. Furthermore, an entirely new class of HDS systems, namely fullerene-like particles and inorganic nanotubes, has been included. Studying new materials and systems has the potential to impact science and technology. The systems investigated are closely related to energy and environmental-related surface science/catalysis.

40|$|Ziel der Arbeit war es, die möglichen Transportwege und -formen (über den Transpirationsstrom gelöst im Transpirationswasser oder gasförmig durch Aerenchyme) von N 2 O durch Pflanzen zu untersuchen und zu bewerten. Methodisch wurde das Ziel wie folgt realisiert: Entwicklung eines Versuchsaufbaus, der es zuließ, die mögliche N 2 O-Abgabe durch Pflanzen zu quantifizieren; unterschiedliche Transportwege für die N 2 O-Abgabe durch Pflanzen zu differenzieren; und Realisierung eines Versuchsaufbaus, mit dem es möglich war, unterschiedliche Einflussfaktoren für die N 2 O-Abgabe zu untersuchen. 	Zu Beginn wurden Versuche mit geschlossenen (ohne Luftaustausch mit der Umgebung) und kontrolliert offenen Systemen (mit Luftaustausch mit der Umgebung als Zwangsbelüftung durch Pumpen) vergleichend durchgeführt. Im geschlossenen System wurden Proben über Molekularsiebe und Vakutainer gewonnen. In diesen Proben wurde mit einem ECD (Elektroneneinfangdetektor) die Lachgaskonzentration gaschromatographisch (HP 5890) bestimmt. Zur Erfassung der Lachgasflüsse im kontrolliert offenen System wurde zusätzlich zu den oben angeführten Methoden noch eine Onlinemessung mit einem photoakustischen Messgerät (Multigas Monitor von Innova AirTech) durchgeführt. Die Messgenauigkeit des Onlinemessgerätes wurde mit einem Gaschromatographen evaluiert (HP 5890). Zur Bestimmung der N 2 O Konzentrationen war die Onlinemessung am geeignetsten, da es nur bei einer hohen zeitlichen Auflösung möglich war, Unterschiede zwischen Behandlung und Kontrolle sicher zu erfassen. Zur Durchführung der relevanten Versuche wurde ein kontrolliert offenes System verwendet, da im geschlossenen System binnen kürzester Zeit der CO 2 -Vorrat aufgebraucht war. Zusätzlich war die Luft in den geschlossenen Systemen nach wenigen Minuten wassergesättigt. Dies führte zu Wachstumshemmungen bei den Pflanzen sowie zu Störungen bei der N 2 O-Messung. Das kontrolliert offene System bestand aus einem jeweils wasser- und gasdichten Wurzel- und Sprosskompartiment. In das Wurzelkompartiment wurden definierte Lachgasmengen eingespritzt. Die im Sprosskompartiment gemessenen N 2 O-Konzentrationen wurden Kontrollen (ohne N 2 O-Anreicherung in der Nährlösung) und der zur Belüftung eingesetzten Luft gegenübergestellt. Für eine sichere Bestimmung der Lachgasabgabe durch Pflanzen war es unerlässlich, den Wurzelraum gasdicht vom Sprosskompartiment abzutrennen. Mit einer Mischung aus einer Abdruckmasse aus der Dentaltechnik (Optosil, Fa. Haereus) und einer weiteren Dichtungsmasse (Prestik AE hellgrau, Bostik GmbH) konnte dies erreicht werden. Um mögliche Einflussfaktoren auf die N 2 O-Abgabe mit größtmöglicher Sicherheit zu erfassen, wurde ein Nährlösungssystem etabliert. Bei der Pflanzenkultur in Nährlösung konnten folgende Parameter genau kontrolliert werden: Nährstoffkonzentrationen, pH-Wert, Konzentration unterschiedlicher in Wasser löslicher Gase (z. B. N 2 O, CO 2), das Verhältnis Luftvolumen im Wurzelraum zu Volumen des Nährmediums im Wurzelraum. Als Versuchspflanzen dienten: Sonnenblume (Helianthus annuus cv. Frankasol), Gerste (Hordeum vulgare cv. Scarlet), Reis (Oryza sativa cv. 94 D- 22), Mais (Zea mays cv. Helix). Die Versuche mit Sonnenblume (keine Aerenchyme, N 2 O nur in Wasser gelöst angeboten) ergaben einen deutlichen Zusammenhang zwischen der N 2 O-Angebotskonzentration in der Nährlösung, der Transpirationsrate und der N 2 O-Emission in Form eines ausgeprägten Tag - Nachtrhythmuses. Bei gasförmigem N 2 O-Angebot im Wurzelraum lagen die Emissionsraten höher als bei einem ausschließlich in Wasser gelösten Angebot. Daraus könnte gefolgert werden, dass gasförmiges N 2 O besser pflanzenverfügbar ist als in Wasser gelöstes. Annähernd ähnliche Ergebnisse wurden auch innerhalb der Versuche mit Gerste erzielt, wobei die höchsten Lachgasemissionen bei rein wässrigem Lachgasangebot gemessen wurden. Die Überprüfung der möglichen Abgabe von N 2 O gasförmig über Aerenchyme, wurde mit Reis durchgeführt. Auch bei Reis wurde ein ausgeprägter Tag - Nachtrhythmus bei der N 2 O-Emission gefunden. Dies führte zu dem Schluss, dass Aerenchyme nur einen geringen Beitrag zur N 2 O-Emission aus dem Wurzelraum leisten. Da die N 2 O-Abgabe bei den drei oben aufgeführten Pflanzenarten nachts deutlich geringer war als tags, konnte geschlossen werden, dass das N 2 O über den Transpirationsstrom aus dem Wurzelraum in das Sprosskompartiment transportiert wurde. Die Untersuchungen mit Mais ergaben sowohl in den mit N 2 O angereicherten Varianten als auch in den Kontrollvarianten unabhängig vom Angebot (in wässriger Lösung oder gasförmig) überraschenderweise eine Netto-N 2 O-Aufnahme. Dies führte zu der Annahme, dass das N 2 O als Stickstoffquelle metabolisiert werden kann. Zusammenfassend zeigen die Ergebnisse, dass der wesentliche Transportweg für N 2 O offensichtlich der Transpirationsstrom und nicht das ?Ausgasen? (über Aerenchyme) ist. The aim of {{this work}} was to explore and to rank the {{different}} ways and forms of transition of N 2 O through plants (dissolved in water and transported with the transpiration or gaseous through aerenchyma). To achieve this goal an experimental set-up had to be realized that allowed the determination of possible N 2 O emissions by plants, the determination of different ways of transition of N 2 O through the plant and the determination of different influencing factors (e. g. N 2 O concentration) on the N 2 O emissions. In the beginning experiments with closed chambers and with ?controlled opened chambers? were conducted in comparison to each other. In the experiments with closed chambers samples were drawn by means of molecular sieves and vacutainers. N 2 O concentrations of the samples were measured with a <b>GC</b> (<b>gas</b> <b>chromatograph</b> type HP 5890) equipped with an ECD (electron capture detector). Besides the two methods mentioned above {{in order to determine}} the N 2 O concentrations within the experiments with the ?controlled opened chambers? a third method was used for N 2 O measurement by means of a photo acoustic online measuring machine. The accuracy of the photo acoustic measurement was evaluated with the GC. For the questions of interest the photo acoustic measurement showed to be the best to determine differences of N 2 O emissions between different experimental treatments. The experiments that were taken in consideration were conducted in a ?controlled opened system? because in closed chambers CO 2 concentration decreased rapidly. Additionally, the air in the closed chambers became saturated in water vapour within a few minutes. These two factors lead to inhibited growth of the plants and to undesired influences on the N 2 O measurements. The ?controlled opened system? consisted of a root and a shoot compartment. Both compartments were separated airtight from each other and from the surroundings. The root compartments were enriched with a definite amount of N 2 O. The N 2 O concentrations measured in the shoot compartments of the systems with N 2 O enrichment in the root compartment were compared with measurements of systems without N 2 O enrichment and measurements of ambient air. The necessity to divide the root compartment from the shoot compartment airtight was realised with a material on the basis of silicone that is usually used to make prints of teeth (Optosil, from Haereus) and a sealing mass (Prestik AE hellgrau, from Bostik GmbH). To determine the different factors potentially influencing the N 2 O emission through plants a hydroponical culture system was established that allowed controlling the following factors: concentration of nutrients, pH-factor, concentration of different water soluble gases (e. g. N 2 O, CO 2) and the ratio between water and gas filled space in the root compartment. As experimental plants sunflower (Helianthus annuus cv. Frankasol), barley (Hordeum vulgare cv. Scarlet), rice (Oryza sativa cv. 94 D- 22) and corn (Zea mays cv. Helix) were used. For the experiment with sunflower (no aerenchyma, N 2 O dissolved in water available only) a relationship between N 2 O concentration in the root compartment, the emitted amount of N 2 O by the shoots and the intensity of transpiration in a diurnal pattern was found. In systems with gaseous availability of N 2 O in the root compartment the observed emissions were higher than in systems with availability of N 2 O dissolved only in water. From this it could be concluded, that gaseous N 2 O is better available for plants than N 2 O dissolved in water. Similar results were obtained from experiments with barley. The only difference was that the highest N 2 O emissions were observed in systems with availability of N 2 O dissolved in water only. The possible N 2 O emission through aerenchyma was checked with rice plants. In these experiments a pronounced diurnal pattern of the N 2 O emissions was also found. This lead to the conclusion that aerenchyma only have a small influence on the N 2 O emissions out of the root compartment through rice plants. Because the N 2 O emission in the three experiments described above followed the diurnal pattern of the transpiration, it was concluded that N 2 O was transported with the transpiration water flow from the root (compartment) to the shoot (compartment). The experiments with corn showed for all treatments (control and availability of N 2 O in gaseous form or dissolved in water) a net N 2 O depletion in the shoot compartment for night (darkness) and day (light) respectively, thus leading to the conclusion that N 2 O can be metabolised and used as a nitrogen source. All in all the experiments showed that the main way of transition of N 2 O through plants is water dissolved with the transpiration water flow and not gaseous (through aerenchyma) ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract]: A <b>gas</b> <b>chromatograph</b> is {{the most}} common method to {{continuously}} determine the hydrocarbon dew point of export natural gas. It is used to ascertain the composition of the natural gas mixture which is applied to a thermodynamic equation of state. Due to the inherent design of the process type <b>gas</b> <b>chromatograph</b> there are limitations to the computation of the gas mixture in the C 6 to C 8 carbon groups. It was found that process type C 9 + <b>gas</b> <b>chromatographs</b> determine a higher hydrocarbon dew point than actual, because it summates all the chromatogram hydrocarbon peaks within the respective carbon group into the normalised alkane of that carbon group. The reason for this, is that the process type <b>gas</b> <b>chromatograph</b> does not have a method to identify these species between the normalised alkane components in the C 6 to C 8 carbon groups. Therefore the aim of this project was to research the 'equations of state' used to calculate natural gas hydrocarbon dew point from constituent analysis by Gas Chromatography and to develop a methodology to improve Gas Chromatography hydrocarbon dew point determination. One important characteristic of the <b>gas</b> <b>chromatograph,</b> is that the measurement of carbon fractions greater than pentane, n - C 5, is based on the relationship of component elution time and hydrocarbon boiling point. The International Standard Organistation standard 23874 (ISO 23874, 2007) uses this relationship to calculate the boiling points of unidentified hydrocarbon components by linear interpolation between the normalised alkanes. The limitation of the ISO 23874 standard is that it is only applicable for laboratory analysis type <b>gas</b> <b>chromatographs.</b> In order to exploit the boiling point and hydrocarbon component elution time relationship to identify unknown components using a process <b>gas</b> <b>chromatograph,</b> the author developed his own method and a modified method of the ISO 23874 standard. Trials on export natural gas, using the equation of state software program, GasVLE, a manual chilled mirror instrument and a Daniel 500 C 9 + <b>gas</b> <b>chromatograph</b> proved that the Grygorcewicz method is a valid characterisation method for further research and use in improving the hydrocarbon dew point determination of export natural gas when applied to a process <b>gas</b> <b>chromatograph</b> on a custody transfer station or pipeline...|$|R

40|$|Changes in {{the water}} status of a plant have an {{explicit}} response on grape composition {{and as a result}} on wine quality. In this study we evaluated the effect of water deficit on the aroma profile of Merlot, Pignolo, Tocai friulano and Ribolla gialla wines. In 2011 and 2012, field experiments were conducted at the experimental farm of the University of Udine (north-eastern Italy). From berry set to harvest, control plants were weekly irrigated and water deficit plants were not irrigated. At harvest grapes were collected and wine were produced using standardized micro-vinification procedures, respectively for white and red grapes. The analyses of the VOCs profile were performed on a Trace <b>GC</b> Ultra <b>gas</b> <b>chromatograph</b> coupled with a TSQ Quantum Tandem mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific). Extraction of the free and bound aromatic compounds were completed according to Vrhovsek et al. [1]. Principal component analysis (PCA) showed that wines produced from different varieties had a distinct aroma profile. In all the varieties, water deficit promoted the accumulation of terpenes. Specifically, water deficit increased the concentration of linalool and its oxide (A, B and C), cis and trans- 8 -OH-linalool, nerol, geraniol, and 7 -OH-geraniol. In 2012, when the water deficit was particularly severe, the effect of water deficit on wine composition was greater. In 2012, 2 -aminoacetophenone (2 -AAP) was detected in Ribolla gialla wines obtained from water deficit wines. The level of 2 -AAP in those wines was over the sensory threshold (1 µg/L). This compound is well known to be responsible of an off-flavour related to untypical aging (UTA). Wines with such a high concentration of 2 -AAP are described by sensory panelist with aroma notes of acacia blossom, furniture polish, naphthalene or hybrid grapes. Hence, in Ribolla gialla, severe water deficit may determin a lower wine quality and, eventually, prevent wine commercialization. This study revealed that water deficit can differentially affect wine quality accordingly to the grape variety considered and that, in the context of climatic change, irrigation systems suitable to prevent the most deleterious effect should be considered even in Alpine regions were water availability was historically not considered a major issue...|$|R
