40|$|We {{have used}} {{continuous}} ambulatory <b>electro-cardiographs</b> in the perioperative period to monitor 108 patients with known cardiovascular disease undergoing non-cardiac surgery. There {{was a high}} incidence of ischaemic ST segment changes and ventricular arrhythmias. For the group as a whole, anaesthesia and surgery were followed by increased ventricular ectopic ac-tivity, but did not worsen myocardial ischaemia. However, the mean duration of ischaemic ST segment changes was increased significantly in those patients with treated hypertension. Of the risk factors considered, preoperative ischaemia and peroperative systolic arterial pressure were significant correlates with postoperative myo-cardial ischaemia...|$|E
40|$|Aims To use the ten year {{follow-up}} of the Caerphilly and Speedwell studies {{to assess the}} contributions of fibrinogen and viscosity {{to the prediction of}} risk of ischaemic heart disease. Methods and Results Caerphilly and Speedwell are pro-spective studies based on representative samples of middle-aged males. Ischaemic heart disease morbidity and mortality were defined using hospital notes, repeat <b>electro-cardiographs</b> and death certificates. There were 603 incident events among the 4860 men. Age-adjusted relative odds of ischaemic heart disease increased to 3 3 and 3 - 4 in the 20 % of men with the highest levels of fibrinogen and viscosity, respectively. After standardizing for the major cardiovascu-lar risk factors, these relative odds were 2 - 2 (95 % confidence interval I- 6 to 31) for fibrinogen and 2 - 3 (95 % confidence interval 1 - 7 to 3 - 2) for viscosity. When fibrinogen and viscosity were entered jointly, both remained significant (/>< 0 - 01) predictors. Incidence of ischaemic heart disease increased with increasing fibrinogen at every level of vis-cosity, and vice versa. Interactions with lipids were also examined. There was no support for the suggestion that risk is independent of cholesterol level when fibrinogen is low. Conclusions Fibrinogen and viscosity are powerful, long term and independent predictors of the risk of ischaemic heart disease...|$|E
40|$|Prolonged P-R {{interval}} in a {{male with}} 47,XYY karyotype SUMMARY A 47,XYY male with an extremely prolonged P-R interval (0. 42 sec) on the <b>electro-cardiograph</b> is described. There {{was also a}} secondary R wave in lead V 1. He had no past {{history of heart disease}} and no cardiac abnor-mality on physical examination. In 1968, Price reported a prolonged P-R interval in electrocardiograms of 47,XYY males. Later, he and his co-workers confirmed this finding in a larger sample (Price and Wilson, 1971; Price et al., 1974). However, several authors failed to support thi...|$|R

Siaw presented to the Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital an <b>electro-cardiograph,</b> a piece of equipment the hospital was deficient of. Siaw also donated towards the construction of a hospital in Akwaseho in 1975 and begun the building of a road from Akwaseho to Obomeng, a project that ceased when the 1979 AFRC regime seized his assets.

40|$|Abstract—A novel {{wearable}} electrocardiograph (ECG) QRS detection algorithm for wearable ECG {{devices in}} body area networks {{is presented in}} this paper, which utilizes the multistage multiscale mathematical morphology filtering to suppress the impulsive noise and uses the multiframe differential modulus accumulation to remove the baseline drift and enhance the signal. The proposed algorithm, verified with data from the MIT/BIH Arrhythmia Database and wearable ECG devices, achieves an average QRS detection rate of 99. 61 %, a sensitivity of 99. 81 %, and a positive prediction of 99. 80 %. It compares favorably to the published methods. Index Terms—Body area networks (BANs), mathematical morphology, multiscale filtering, QRS detection, wearable <b>electro-cardiograph</b> (ECG) device.

40|$|The correct {{choice and}} {{customization}} of an orthosis {{are crucial to}} obtain the best comfort and efficiency. This study explored the feasibility of a multivariate quantitative assessment of the functional efficiency of lower limb orthosis through a novel wearable system. Gait basographic parameters and energetic indexes were analysed during a Six-Minute Walking Test (6 -MWT) through a cost-effective, non-invasive polygraph device, with a multichannel wireless transmission, that carried out <b>electro-cardiograph</b> (ECG); impedance-cardiograph (ICG); and lower-limb accelerations detection. Four subjects affected by Post-Polio Syndrome (PPS) were recruited. The wearable device and the semi-automatic post-processing software provided a novel set of objective data to assess the overall efficiency of the patient-orthosis system. Despite {{the small number of}} examined subjects, the results obtained with this new approach encourage the application of the method thus enlarging the dataset to validate this promising protocol and measuring system in supporting clinical decisions and out of a laboratory environment...|$|R

From high resolution imaging systems to drug delivery systems and implantable electronics, analog and digital ICs are playing an expanding role in the medical field. These instruments increasingly require high performance, small size and low power—areas where Linear Technology excels. to a PC or transmitted electronically back to the hospital. Portable solutions demand very accurate low power front-end ICs. The following pages provide a sample of Linear Technology’s ICs that are well-suited for various medical monitoring applications such as electro-encephalograph (EEG) and <b>electro-cardiograph</b> (ECG) machines, pulse oximetry measurements, infusion/insulin pumps, dialysis machines, vital signs monitors and medical imaging.

40|$|Abstract: The {{aging of}} the Japanese {{population}} and the trend toward the nuclear family are factors resulting {{in an increase in}} single elderly people. Consequently, in-home accidents suffered by the elderly are also increasing. The purpose of the present research is to develop monitoring systems that prevent accidents by using physiological indices. Using such a system, we can objectively judge whether their movements are normal or unusual. In this experiment, in order to objectively determine whether a subject is possibly in an accident state, we set up two indices. The first was to determine what position the subject was in, and the other was to determine whether this posture was made voluntarily or involuntarily. In the former case, changes in crural muscle form generated by movement were measured using a strain gauge band. Three types of movement were measured in this experiment: 1) Standing-up and sitting-down; 2) stamping; and 3) going up and down a step. In order to classify movement as voluntary or involuntary, we assumed that a falling motion signifies a tumbling accident. We measured <b>electro-cardiograph</b> (ECG), blood pressure, and their respective fluctuations. These physiological indices are influenced by the sympathetic nervous system. To find the difference in volitional existence, the subject was moved under two conditions; 1) active movement, and 2) passive movement...|$|R
40|$|There {{has been}} {{considerable}} {{difference of opinion}} during the de-velopment of electrocardiography as {{to the relationship between}} the electrical phenomena of the heart beat, as recorded by the <b>electro-cardiograph,</b> and the attendant muscular activity. It has come to be generally held that the waves of the electrocardiogram indicate the spread of relative electrical negativity throughout the heart from the region of the sino-auricular node to the various parts of the heart's musculature. The electrical energy propagated in this manner has been the expression of the so-called "excitation wave. " Much physiological research has been undertaken in an attempt to demonstrate the time relationship between this "excitation wave" and the muscular contraction of the heart. In general most of such work has been by the method of simultaneous registration of electro-cardiographic and myocardiographic records in such a manner that they can be compared, and the sequence of events studied and meas-ured. Similar comparisons have been made between electrocardio-grams and intracardiac pressure curves. Myocardiographs have been devised by Cushny, Roy, Gesell, Wiggers and others, and have been used in connection with the string galvanometer, for which we are indebted to Professor W. Einthoven. By the extensive researches of Garten and Weber, Wiggers, Lewis, Feil and Stroud, Wiggers and Dean, and others, it became generally recognized that the "excitation wave " precedes the muscular contrac-tion of the heart by a definite and constant interval.
