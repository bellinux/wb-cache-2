5|$|The {{definition}} of real numbers as Cauchy sequences {{was first published}} separately by Eduard Heine and <b>Georg</b> <b>Cantor,</b> also in 1872. The above approach to decimal expansions, including the proof that 0.999... = 1, closely follows Griffiths & Hilton's 1970 work A comprehensive textbook of classical mathematics: A contemporary interpretation. The book is written specifically to offer {{a second look at}} familiar concepts in a contemporary light.|$|E

5|$|Cantor {{retired in}} 1913, {{living in poverty}} and {{suffering}} from malnourishment during World War I. The public celebration of his 70th birthday was canceled because of the war. In June 1917, he entered a sanatorium {{for the last time}} and continually wrote to his wife asking to be allowed to go home. <b>Georg</b> <b>Cantor</b> had a fatal heart attack on January 6, 1918, in the sanatorium where he had spent {{the last year of his}} life.|$|E
5|$|In 1968, the Hungarian {{theoretical}} biologist Aristid Lindenmayer (1925–1989) {{developed the}} L-system, a formal grammar {{which can be}} used to model plant growth patterns in the style of fractals. L-systems have an alphabet of symbols that can be combined using production rules to build larger strings of symbols, and a mechanism for translating the generated strings into geometric structures. In 1975, after centuries of slow development of the mathematics of patterns by Gottfried Leibniz, <b>Georg</b> <b>Cantor,</b> Helge von Koch, Wacław Sierpiński and others, Benoît Mandelbrot wrote a famous paper, How Long Is the Coast of Britain? Statistical Self-Similarity and Fractional Dimension, crystallising mathematical thought into the concept of the fractal.|$|E

50|$|The {{relationship}} between the infinity of God and mathematical infinity has often been discussed. <b>Georg</b> <b>Cantor's</b> work on infinity in mathematics was accused of undermining God's infinity, but Cantor argued that God's infinity is the Absolute Infinite, which transcends other forms of infinity.|$|R

25|$|The book {{presents}} {{a view of}} the foundations of mathematics and has become a classic reference. It reported on developments by Giuseppe Peano, Mario Pieri, Richard Dedekind, <b>Georg</b> <b>Cantor,</b> and others.|$|E
25|$|Ordinals were {{introduced}} by <b>Georg</b> <b>Cantor</b> in 1883 to accommodate infinite sequences and to classify derived sets, {{which he had}} previously introduced in 1872 while studying the uniqueness of trigonometric series.|$|E
25|$|In 1860 he {{suggested}} a cardinal arithmetic for infinite numbers, years before any work by <b>Georg</b> <b>Cantor</b> (who completed his dissertation in 1867) and {{without access to}} Bernard Bolzano's 1851 (posthumous) Paradoxien des Unendlichen.|$|E
50|$|Although Schultz was {{unsuccessful}} in this entry, the essay preceded certain features of <b>Georg</b> <b>Cantors</b> Theory of Transfinite numbers. The work, although similar to work {{undertaken by the}} mathematicians Wenceslaus Johann Gustav Karsten, Georg Simon Klügel, and Johann Heinrich Lambert, would eventually result {{in the development of}} non-Euclidean geometry.|$|R
50|$|The Georg-Cantor-Gymnasium is a German {{gymnasium}} in Halle (Saale) with {{a special}} focus on mathematics and the sciences (specialist school). The all-day school was founded in 1989. It is attended by just over 500 students and has a staff of about 60 teachers. <b>Georg</b> <b>Cantor's</b> grandson, William 'Willy' Greenwood attended the specialist school.|$|R
50|$|In The Continuum Weyl {{developed}} {{the logic of}} predicative analysis using {{the lower levels of}} Bertrand Russell's ramified theory of types. He was able to develop most of classical calculus, while using neither the axiom of choice nor proof by contradiction, and avoiding <b>Georg</b> <b>Cantor's</b> infinite sets. Weyl appealed in this period to the radical constructivism of the German romantic, subjective idealist Fichte.|$|R
25|$|In {{mathematical}} logic, {{the theory}} of infinite sets was first developed by <b>Georg</b> <b>Cantor.</b> Although this work has become a thoroughly standard fixture of classical set theory, it has been criticized in several areas by mathematicians and philosophers.|$|E
25|$|In set theory, Cantor's {{diagonal}} argument, {{also called}} the diagonalisation argument, the diagonal slash argument or the diagonal method, was published in 1891 by <b>Georg</b> <b>Cantor</b> as a mathematical proof that there are infinite sets which cannot be put into one-to-one correspondence with the infinite set of natural numbers.|$|E
25|$|<b>Georg</b> <b>Cantor</b> formalized {{many ideas}} related to {{infinity}} and infinite sets during the late19th and early 20thcenturies. In the theory he developed, there are infinite sets {{of different sizes}} (called cardinalities). For example, the set of integers is countably infinite, while the infinite set of real numbers is uncountable.|$|E
25|$|In {{discrete}} mathematics, countable sets (including finite sets) are {{the main}} focus. The beginning of set theory as a branch of mathematics is usually marked by <b>Georg</b> <b>Cantor's</b> work distinguishing between different kinds of infinite set, motivated by the study of trigonometric series, and further development {{of the theory of}} infinite sets is outside the scope of discrete mathematics. Indeed, contemporary work in descriptive set theory makes extensive use of traditional continuous mathematics.|$|R
5000|$|If finitists are {{contrasted with}} transfinitists (proponents of e.g. <b>Georg</b> <b>Cantor's</b> {{hierarchy}} of infinities), then also Aristotle may {{be characterized as}} a strict finitist. Aristotle especially promoted the potential infinity as a middle option between strict finitism and actual infinity (the latter being an actualization of something never-ending in nature, {{in contrast with the}} Cantorist actual infinity consisting of the transfinite cardinal and ordinal numbers, which {{have nothing to do with}} the things in nature): ...|$|R
2500|$|The {{second group}} of logicians, the set-theorists, emerged with <b>Georg</b> <b>Cantor's</b> [...] "set theory" [...] (1870–1890) but were driven forward {{partly as a result}} of Russell's {{discovery}} of a paradox that could be derived from Frege's conception of [...] "function", but also as a reaction against Russell's proposed solution. Zermelo's set-theoretic response was his 1908 Investigations in the foundations of set theory I – the first axiomatic set theory; here too the notion of [...] "propositional function" [...] plays a role.|$|R
25|$|This was proven by <b>Georg</b> <b>Cantor</b> in his 1874 uncountability proof, {{part of his}} {{groundbreaking}} {{study of}} different infinities, and later more simply in his diagonal argument. Cantor defined cardinality in terms of bijective functions: two sets have the same cardinality {{if and only if}} there exists a bijective function between them.|$|E
25|$|The modern {{study of}} set theory was {{initiated}} by <b>Georg</b> <b>Cantor</b> and Richard Dedekind in the 1870s. After {{the discovery of}} paradoxes in naive set theory, such as the Russell's paradox, numerous axiom systems were proposed {{in the early twentieth}} century, of which the Zermelo–Fraenkel axioms, with or without the axiom of choice, are the best-known.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Georg</b> <b>Cantor's</b> {{first set}} theory article was {{published}} in 1874 and contains the first theorems of transfinite set theory, which studies infinite sets and their properties.

This theorem is proved using Cantor's first uncountability proof, which differs from the more familiar proof using his diagonal argument. The title of the article, [...] "On a Property of the Collection of All Real Algebraic Numbers" [...] (""), refers to its first theorem: the set of real algebraic numbers is countable.|$|R
