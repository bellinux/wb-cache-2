It offers various training programs but the most respected is its flagship degree course i.e. the three-year degree program. The intake is through merit list of Joint Entrance Exams conducted by Indian Institute of Technology (IIT JEE) conducted every year across India and widely considered {{as one of the}} toughest competitive exams to clear in world. Graduates from T.S. Chanakya receive a B.Sc. (Nautical Sciences) degree from the Indian Maritime University, and are eligible to seek employment on Indian or Foreign going ships. Currently it is also called as Mumbai campus of Indian Maritime University, Chennai. T.S. Chanakya (1993 - till Date) is a progeny of T.S. Rajendra (1972–1993) and T.S. Dufferin (1927–1972). The earlier two were actual ships floating at Ferry Wharf, Mumbai while T.S. Chanakya is a shore based academy in Navi Mumbai. The entire Indian Shipping and Logistics Fraternity and Indo-origin seafaring community across world is majorly thronged by ex-cadets of this community also called as DRACEA (Dufferin Rajendra And Chanakya Ex-Cadets Association).The members of DRACEA are at very high posts in maritime sector. Recently, T.S. Chanakya is also hitting limelight in non-shipping industries because of the ex-cadets who leave merchant navy career after significant experience at sea and go on to clear next level of competitive exams like CAT, GMAT, IAS and go for further studies or change in their <b>job</b> <b>profile.</b> Institutions like Harvard, Emory, CASS, LBS, Lancaster, Yale, Texas A, IIM's, ISB, XLRI, IIFT, FMS, Great Lakes, S.P.Jain, MDI etc. welcome these ex-naval officers in their admits willingly since they bring along a wide and diverse experience and add stupendous value to their future occupations and even entrepreneurship by their fresh and mature perspectives.|$|E

But, these include {{a large amount of}} quantitative and qualitative but mainly textual data, so an appropriate approach should be chosen in order to obtain a detailed knowledge of competencies in certain areas and professional profiles. The aim {{of this paper is to}} provide empirical evidence of the competencies required to HR professionals both generally and in terms of different <b>job</b> <b>profiles</b> in this area. The identification of competencies is accomplished by the application of statistical methods to automatically processed texts, which dispenses with previous categorization of competences in order to preserve the texts in their native format. The research is based on a textual corpus on "Soft Competencies", which has been built from hundreds of job offers for HR professionals, posted by either recruitment consultants or direct employers within the labor Spanish market. After a process of standardization and lemmatization of the textual corpus, the key terms on HR soft competencies has been drawn and thus the overall most requested competencies. Likewise, combining the textual information about competencies with qualitative data concerning <b>job</b> <b>profiles,</b> modal texts may be determined and different competency profiles can be outlined. Finally, the visualization of the associations between soft competencies and HR <b>job</b> <b>profiles</b> has been carried out by means of a Correspondence Analysis of an aggregated lexical table...|$|R

40|$|International audienceICT {{competency}} frameworks {{establish the}} definition of competences required and deployed by ICT professionals. <b>Job</b> <b>profiles</b> articulate competen-cies together with an organization needs, objectives and constraints. The evolution of the software industry impacts personality trends in the profession. This work-in-progress studies the relationship between competencies, profiles and personality types. 1 Introduction Competency frameworks, such as the e-Competences Framework [1] provides a reference of competences as required and applied at the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) workplace. The application of the European e-Competence Framework is centered upon workplace competence articulation, profiling, assessment and measurement [2]. A person's inclination towards a specific way of acquiring information or making decisions influences their preference for certain tasks and jobs [3]. Because certain jobs require certain competences, we may think that personality types and traits of software engineers are related to engineers' competences and performance. Thus we define a first research question: How can we relate personality types with employees' competencies proficiency? Competences are sufficiently comprehensive to represent complexity and to fit variable organization structures. Customization is generally performed through {{the definition of}} various <b>job</b> <b>profiles</b> reflecting organization needs and objectives. The European ICT Professional Profiles [4] was created to define a number of representative ICT Profiles covering, at their level of granularity, the full ICT Business process. The European ICT Profiles build a consistent bridge between existing competence and profile approaches because profiles are worded in terms of capabilities needed to successfully perform a role and related to the required e-competences. Our interest is focused on four major roles involved {{in the development of}} software products: project manager, system architect, system analyst and developer. Through the study of a small set of software engineers graduated 10 years ago, we aim to empirically verify that the set of e-competences related to a role is suitable to their job occupation. In section 2, we overview the background and related work. In section 3, we present the selected <b>job</b> <b>profiles</b> and the sample set. In section 4, we discuss the questionnaire results, and then we conclude the paper...|$|R
