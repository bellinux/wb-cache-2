50|$|Meals on Wheels was {{originally}} {{created as a}} side project of The Home Welfare Association. A 1961 study recommended {{the establishment of a}} Meals on <b>Wheels</b> <b>delivery</b> service for people who were unable to prepare meals for themselves, such as the elderly and infirm. A three-year pilot project was started and they delivered the first meals on 30 June 1965. In 1981 the Home Welfare Association chapter was officially closed when the name was changed to Meals on Wheels of Winnipeg, Inc.|$|R

60|$|The {{successful}} navigation {{of lower}} Tower Street, at noonday, required {{presence of mind}} {{on the part of}} the pedestrian. There were currents and counter-currents, eddies and backwaters, and at the corner of Vine a veritable maelstrom through which two lines of electric cars pushed their way, east and weft, north and south, with incessant clanging of bells; followed by automobiles with resounding horns, trucks and <b>delivery</b> wagons with <b>wheels</b> reverberating on the granite. A giant Irish policeman, who seemed in continual danger of a violent death, and wholly indifferent to it, stood between the car tracks and halted the rush from time to time, driving the people like sheep from one side to the other. Through the doors of Ferguson's poured two conflicting streams of humanity, and wistful groups of young women, on the way from hasty lunches, blocked the pavements and stared at the finery behind the plate-glass windows.|$|R
5000|$|The {{delivery}} truck shows {{up and the}} <b>delivery</b> man <b>wheels</b> in a large crate containing a loudly-barking dog. As Jerry signs for the crate, Tom is almost too scared to look on as he takes a crowbar to the crate. Jerry whistles for the loud dog to come out....and it is a tiny bulldog even smaller than Jerry is in stature (possibly due to Jerry's surname, [...] "Mouse", making the dog very small, {{about the same size}} as him). Tom is amazed to see the dog's small stature, but Jerry orders the dog to take care of Tom. After it sits around panting and barking, Jerry lifts up the dog and compares the dog to himself (Jerry being bigger than the dog), which causes the dog to snuggle up to him and fall on its head due to the dog's short legs. He lifts up the dog, who then licks him, as Tom comes out to investigate. Jerry takes the dog back into the crate with him, and ends up hanging on the tail when the dog wants to go out and meet Tom. Tom tosses the dog up a few times, pointing and laughing, which causes the dog to buzz saw his right arm hair off. He is still smiling until the dog repeats on the left arm, leading him to frantically try and shake the dog off. With a mouthful of fur, the dog hits the ground, only to buzzsaw on Tom's tail, turning part of it into sausages. Horrified at the state of his tail, he runs into the house screaming in terror. The rest of this short sees Tom without fur covering either of his arms, although he regains that of his tail.|$|R
