6000|$|A {{grinning}} small boy, in a small, bright-painted and <b>half-decked</b> skiff, sailed {{close in}} {{to the wall and}} let go his sheet to spill the wind. [...] "Want to get aboard?" [...] he called.|$|E
60|$|Each of {{the vessels}} which now lay beached in Ericsfiord {{had a high}} {{forecastle}} and poop, with figure-heads on stem and stern-posts that towered higher still. The ships were only <b>half-decked,</b> with benches for numerous rowers, and each had a crew of sixty men.|$|E
60|$|The Heartsease was {{a good-sized}} <b>half-decked</b> boat of some twenty-six {{feet long and}} eight feet beam. She was very deep, and carried three tons of stone ballast in her bottom. She drew about six feet of water. She {{had a lot of}} freeboard, and carried two lug-sails and a small mizzen.|$|E
60|$|Sir Duncan Campbell, therefore, rather shunned the Highlands, {{and falling}} into the Low-country, made for the nearest seaport in the vicinity, where he had several <b>half-decked</b> galleys, or birlings, as they were called, at his command. In one of these they embarked, with Gustavus in company, who was so {{seasoned}} to adventure, that land and sea seemed as indifferent to him as to his master.|$|E
60|$|Early {{one fine}} morning, a <b>half-decked</b> boat rowed into the harbour of this isle, and ran {{alongside}} the little quay, where the few natives who chanced to be lounging there {{were filled with}} admiration {{at the sight of}} five stalwart men who leaped upon the rocks, an active lad who held the boat steady, and a handsome middle-aged woman, who was assisted to land with much care by the tallest of her five companions.|$|E
60|$|The two men, {{unable to}} see each other, kept silent till the lighter, {{slipping}} before the fitful breeze, passed out between almost invisible headlands into the still deeper darkness of the gulf. For a time the lantern on the jetty shone after them. The wind failed, then fanned up again, but so faintly that the big, <b>half-decked</b> boat slipped along with no more noise than {{if she had been}} suspended in the air.|$|E
6000|$|I {{looked at}} the craft, which was a <b>half-decked</b> boat, evidently fitted with a center-board, of the broad-beamed shallow type common on the American coast. She carried no bowsprit, her lofty mast was stepped almost in her bows, and the {{combination}} of heavy spars, short body, and wide, flat stern, presaged difficulties for an unskilled helmsman when running before any strength of breeze. [...] "I think you have some reason for your misgivings," [...] I said. [...] "If the wind freshens much I should almost recommend you to camp here all night." ...|$|E
60|$|For {{the better}} part of five months Mainwaring cruised about in the waters {{surrounding}} the Bahama Islands. In that time he ran to earth and dispersed a dozen nests of pirates. He destroyed no less than fifteen piratical crafts of all sizes, from a large <b>half-decked</b> whaleboat to a three-hundred-ton barkentine. The name of the Yankee became a terror to every sea wolf in the western tropics, and the waters of the Bahama Islands became swept almost clean of the bloody wretches who had so lately infested it.|$|E
60|$|It was, as he said, no use {{looking at}} it, and {{in five minutes}} half our catch {{of the day was}} overboard. The Jane was a <b>half-decked</b> boat, yawl-rigged; she wasn't built in our parts, but had been brought round from somewhere east by a gentleman as a fishing-craft. He had used her for two years, and had got tired of the sport, and my father had bought her of him. She wasn't the sort of boat {{generally}} used about here, but we all liked her, and swore by her.|$|E
60|$|Weston was {{somewhat}} relieved when they safely accomplished {{the first stage}} of the journey, and, turning the team over to a man by the waterside, paddled off to a big, <b>half-decked</b> boat beautifully built and fitted in Toronto. Stirling, who admitted that he knew nothing about such matters, sat down aft and lighted a cigar, while Weston proceeded to get the tall gall mainsail and big single headsail up. He was conscious that his companion was watching him closely, and when he let go the moorings and seated himself at the tiller the latter pointed up the lake.|$|E
60|$|They {{left the}} house, {{and a few}} minutes later crept along a {{slippery}} plank to a boat lying against a timber framework on which nets were dried. She was sharp at both ends, <b>half-decked,</b> and about twenty feet long; with a short, thick mast. Now that the tide had ebbed, the river mouth was about a dozen yards across, and a row of larger craft, sheering to and fro in the eddies, nearly filled the channel. Behind these, a cluster of white buildings and a low promontory loomed out of the dark. On the opposite side, a high gravel bank seemed to close the narrow entrance.|$|E
60|$|Had {{she been}} decked, or even <b>half-decked,</b> the voyage which now began {{would not have}} been so desperate an undertaking; but having been only covered in part with a frail tarpaulin, she was not at all fitted to face the terrible storms that {{sometimes}} sweep the southern seas. Each man, as he gazed at her, felt that his chance of ultimate escape was very small indeed. Still, the men had now been so long contemplating the voyage and preparing for it, and they had become so accustomed to risk their lives upon the sea, that they set out upon this voyage at last in cheerful spirits, and even jested about the anticipated dangers and trials which they knew full well awaited them.|$|E
60|$|Before starting, Jack {{had put on}} {{a canvas}} jumper, {{leggings}} and high boots, and was soon at work with his uncle, ankle-deep in the mud. The bawleys are boats almost peculiar to Leigh, although a few hail from Gravesend and the Medway. They are from thirty to forty-five feet long, and are divided into three classes of from six to fifteen tons burden. They are very broad in comparison to their length, some of them having a beam of fifteen feet, and they carry their width almost to the stern, which is square. This gives the boats a dumpy appearance, as they {{look as if they}} had been cut short. They are <b>half-decked,</b> with a roomy fo'castle and a well, where the fish are kept alive. They carry one mast.|$|E
60|$|The {{boat was}} a large one, <b>half-decked,</b> and fitted to stand a heavy sea and rough weather. It would have moved sluggishly through the water had not the four men who pulled the oars been possessed of more than average strength. As soon as they passed the barrier reef, the sails were hoisted, and Dick took the helm. The breeze was blowing fresh off the land, and the water rushed past the boat as she cut swiftly out to sea, leaving a track of white foam behind her. For {{a few minutes the}} mass of the island was dimly seen rising like a huge shade on the dark sky, but soon it melted away and nothing {{remained}} for the straining eyes to rest upon save the boat with its silent crew and the curling foam on the black sea.|$|E
60|$|That night, {{long after}} dark, the little, <b>half-decked</b> skiff sailed up the Oakland Estuary. The wind was fair but light, {{and the boat}} moved slowly, towing a long pile which the boy had picked up adrift and {{announced}} as worth three dollars anywhere for the wood that was in it. The tide flooded smoothly under the full moon, and Saxon recognized the points they passed--the Transit slip, Sandy Beach, the shipyards, the nail works, Market street wharf. The boy took the skiff in to a dilapidated boat-wharf {{at the foot of}} Castro street, where the scow schooners, laden with sand and gravel, lay hauled to the shore in a long row. He insisted upon an equal division of the fish, because Saxon had helped catch them, though he explained at length the ethics of flotsam to show her that the pile was wholly his.|$|E
60|$|It was the Northmen who, in huge open boats, {{pushed off}} without chart or compass (for neither existed at that time) into the tempestuous {{northern}} seas, and, {{in the year}} 863, discovered the island of Iceland; in 983, the coast of Greenland; and, a few years later, {{those parts of the}} American coast now called Long Island, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, Nova Scotia, and Newfoundland. It is true they did not go forth with the scientific and commercial views of Columbus; neither did they give to the civilised world the benefit of their knowledge of those lands. But although their purpose was simply selfish, we cannot withhold our admiration of the bold, daring spirit displayed by those early navigators, under circumstances of the greatest possible disadvantage-- with undecked or <b>half-decked</b> boats, meagre supplies, no scientific knowledge or appliances, and the stars their only guide over the trackless waste of waters.|$|E
60|$|Frank {{staggered}} aft a pace or two, {{and sitting}} down breathless and dripping gazed about him. The boat looked {{a good deal}} bigger than she had appeared from the steamer, and, {{as a matter of}} fact, she was a <b>half-decked</b> sloop of about twenty-four feet in length. Just then she was slanted well down on one side, with the water foaming along her depressed deck and showers of spray beating into her over her weather bow, while the jib above her bowsprit every now and then plunged into the short, white-topped seas. There seemed to be some water inside her, for it washed up above the floorings at every heave. In a few moments Frank had recovered his breath sufficiently to look around at his companions. One was a boy of about his own age who smiled at him. He had a bronzed skin and a kindly expression, and looked lean and wiry.|$|E
6000|$|Standing by the tiller, {{he pulls}} out his watch from under a thick jacket and bends his head over it in the light cast into the boat. Time's up. His {{pleasant}} voice commands in a quiet undertone [...] "Larguez." [...] A suddenly projected arm snatches the lantern off the quay--and, warped along by a line at first, then with the regular tug of four heavy sweeps in the bow, the big <b>half-decked</b> boat full of men glides out of the black breathless shadow of the Fort. The open water of the avant-port glitters under the moon as if sown over with millions of sequins, and the long white breakwater shines like a thick bar of solid silver. With a quick rattle of blocks and one single silky swish, the sail is filled by a little breeze keen enough to have come straight down from the frozen moon, and the boat, after the clatter of the hauled-in sweeps, seems to stand at rest, surrounded by a mysterious whispering so faint and unearthly {{that it may be}} the rustling of the brilliant, over-powering moonrays breaking like a rain-shower upon the hard, smooth, shadowless sea.|$|E
60|$|We passed {{some days}} of airless quiet and great heat; shell- gatherers were warned {{from the ocean}} beach, where sunstroke waited them from ten till four; the highest palm hung motionless, there was no voice audible but that of the sea on the far side. At last, about four of a certain afternoon, long cat's-paws flawed {{the face of the}} lagoon; and {{presently}} in the tree-tops there awoke the grateful bustle of the trades, and all the houses and alleys of the island were fanned out. To more than one enchanted ship, that had lain long becalmed in view of the green shore, the wind brought deliverance; and by daylight on the morrow a schooner and two cutters lay moored in the port of Rotoava. Not only in the outer sea, but in the lagoon itself, a certain traffic woke with the reviving breeze; and among the rest one Francois, a half-blood, set sail with the first light in his own <b>half-decked</b> cutter. He had held before a court appointment; being, I believe, the Residency sweeper-out. Trouble arising with the unpopular Vice-Resident, he had thrown his honours down, and fled to the far parts of the atoll to plant cabbages--or at least coco-palms. Thence he was now driven by such need as even a Cincinnatus must acknowledge, and fared for the capital city, the seat of his late functions, to exchange half a ton of copra for necessary flour. And here, for a while, the story leaves to tell of his voyaging.|$|E
6000|$|His {{grandfather}} (I think) was a dignitary of a kind, the Syndic of the Pilots. I made acquaintances {{among these}} people, but mainly among the pilots. The very first whole day I ever spent on salt water was by invitation, {{in a big}} <b>half-decked</b> pilot-boat, cruising under close reefs on the lookout, in misty, blowing weather, for the sails of ships and the smoke of steamers rising out there, beyond the slim and tall Planier lighthouse cutting {{the line of the}} wind-swept horizon with a white perpendicular stroke. They were hospitable souls, these sturdy Provencal seamen. Under the general designation of le petit ami de Baptistin I was made the guest of the corporation of pilots, and had the freedom of their boats night or day. And many a day and a night, too, did I spend cruising with these rough, kindly men, under whose auspices my intimacy with the sea began. Many a time [...] "the little friend of Baptistin" [...] had the hooded cloak of the Mediterranean sailor thrown over him by their honest hands while dodging at night under the lee of Chateau daft on the watch for the lights of ships. Their sea tanned faces, whiskered or shaved, lean or full, with the intent, wrinkled sea eyes of the pilot breed, and here and there a thin gold hoop at the lobe of a hairy ear, bent over my sea infancy. The first operation of seamanship I had an opportunity of observing was the boarding of ships at sea, at all times, in all states of the weather. They gave it to me to the full. And I have been invited to sit in more than one tall, dark house of the old town at their hospitable board, had the bouillabaisse ladled out into a thick plate by their high-voiced, broad-browed wives, talked to their daughters--thick-set girls, with pure profiles, glorious masses of black hair arranged with complicated art, dark eyes, and dazzlingly white teeth.|$|E
6000|$|He {{gave me a}} {{delightful}} waking, and his friendliness was unwearied; but I fear he did not enter upon {{the quest for a}} ship for me in a very solemn spirit. He had been at sea himself, but had left off at the age of twenty-five, finding he could earn his living on shore in a much more agreeable manner. He was related to an incredible number of Marseilles well-to-do families of a certain class. One of his uncles was a ship-broker of good standing, with a large connection amongst English ships; other relatives of his dealt in ships' stores, owned sail-lofts, sold chains and anchors, were master-stevedores, caulkers, shipwrights. His grandfather (I think) was a dignitary of a kind, the Syndic of the Pilots. I made acquaintances amongst these people, but mainly amongst the pilots.

50|$|The pier at Fahamore (situated on {{the western}} side of Scraggane Bay) is used {{extensively}} during the summer months by the local fishing fleet, which consists of around 20 <b>half-decked</b> and decked boats in the range 7-15 metres. Species fished include the European lobster (Homarus gammarus), spiny lobster or crayfish, spider crab, edible crab, and Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). In the winter there is a managed fishery in Tralee Bay for the European oyster (Ostrea edulis).|$|E
50|$|There {{were great}} dramas {{even before the}} racing began when Bob Miller (later famously known as Ben Lexcen) arrived with his radically {{designed}} Taipan, which was the biggest break in tradition since the skimmer. She was a three-man boat, hard chine, plywood construction, reverse sheer, <b>half-decked,</b> heavily flared topsides and narrow (4 ft 3in) beam on the chine. She also had a smaller rig (similar to a Flying Dutchman), a big genoa and bending spars and was referred to by Miller as a supercharged FD.|$|E
5000|$|It is a 17-foot, <b>half-decked,</b> {{centreboard}} boat rigged as a Bermuda sloop, {{designed for}} the Dublin Bay Sailing Club in 1932 by John B. Kearney. The class still actively races with fleets in Dun Laoghaire, Rush, Skerries and Foynes. [...] The class usually have 5 Championship level events every year, these include the Munster Championship, the Leinster Championship, the National Championship, Skerries Regatta and Rush Regatta. Regular club racing also runs from May to September but can start as early as April and continue up {{until the end of}} October depending on the club. The national class association is the Mermaid Sailing Association and the class website can be found at http://dublinbaymermaids.com/.The table below lists the pre-1940 boats with their original names are. The boats were not completed in numerical order as sail numbers were not allocated until some years after the first Mermaids were launched.: ...|$|E
5000|$|Though {{his father}} was a keen 6-10 metre racing yachtsman, Rayner {{preferred}} the idea of cruising. On 6 June 1937, sailing his small boat out of Loch Fyne, he records passing [...] "a ship which from the lines of her hull I think to have been the original Blue Dragon... if it were, it is poetic justice that I should meet her on my first cruise in my own designed ship in Scottish waters for it was her exploits as detailed in The Log of the Blue Dragon, by C.C.Lynam, read in [...] "the library of a midland county preparatory school" [...] that [...] "first started the sailing canker" [...] though [...] "vows then made to sail my own ship to Scotland had to wait twenty years for fruition." [...] Starting with an 18 open boat, and progressing via a 16 <b>half-decked</b> day sailer to a small converted fishing yawl, followed by a converted ex-fishing boat and then the 14 ton Tredwen barge yacht Pearl - burnt out on her moorings - Rayner was at last, in 1936, able try his hand at designing his own boat [...] "after studying the How To articles in the Y.M." [...] Robinetta, a 4½ ton auxiliary gaff cutter, was built for him at the Rock Ferry yard of the Enterprise Small Craft Company, Birkenhead, and launched on 10 May 1937.|$|E
