He fitted larger diameter chimneys and Lemaître multiple jet blastpipes, which effectively transformed their performance. Thereafter the class was <b>highly</b> <b>respected.</b>|$|E
5|$|Philitas was {{the first}} major Greek writer who was both a scholar and a poet. His {{reputation}} continued for centuries, based on both his pioneering study of words and his verse in elegiac meter.

His poetry, notably his elegiac poem Demeter, was <b>highly</b> <b>respected</b> by later ancient poets. However, almost all his work has since been lost.|$|E

Patrick Hastings and Hubert Wallington {{represented}} Gruban, while Booth was represented by Rigby Swift KC and Douglas Hogg. The trial attracted such public interest that {{on the final day}} the barristers found it physically difficult to get through the crowds surrounding the Law Courts. While both Rigby Smith and Douglas Hogg were <b>highly</b> <b>respected</b> barristers, Booth's cross-examination by Hastings was so skilfully done that the jury took only ten minutes to find that he had been fraudulent; they awarded Gruban £4,750 (about £ in 2015).|$|E

His last job was personnel manager at a local mine. He dedicated his final years to the writing of {{a book about his}} life, the manuscript for which was lost when his house burned down. Clark alleged that the BSAC orchestrated the fire to stop him from publishing unflattering information about the early days of Company rule. He died from heart disease in Broken Hill on 9 December 1927, aged about 67, and was buried in the Protestant section of the town cemetery.

Set in a comprehensive school and starring David Bamber as manic deputy head Eric Slatt and Nicola Walker as Suzy Travis, the show was based on Moffat's three years as an English teacher. The studio audience responded so positively to the first series when it was taped that the BBC commissioned a second series before the first had aired. However, it was met less enthusiastically by critics upon transmission in February 1997, who had taken exception to the BBC's publicity department comparing the show to the <b>highly</b> <b>respected</b> Fawlty Towers. In an interview in the early 2000s, Moffat refuses to even name the series, joking that he might get attacked in the street.|$|E

5|$|During {{the spring}} of 1717, Stede Bonnet {{decided to become a}} pirate, despite having no {{knowledge}} of shipboard life. He contracted a local shipyard to build him a sixty-ton sloop, which he equipped with ten guns and named the Revenge. This was unusual, as most pirates seized their ships by mutiny or boarding, or else converted a privateer vessel to a pirate ship. Bonnet enlisted a crew of more than seventy men. He relied on his quartermaster and officer for their knowledge of sailing, and as a result, he was not <b>highly</b> <b>respected</b> by his crew. In another break from tradition, Bonnet paid his crew wages, not shares of plunder as most pirates did. Royal Navy intelligence reported that he departed Carlisle Bay, Barbados under cover of darkness.|$|E
5|$|President Paul von Hindenburg {{appointed}} Hitler Chancellor on January 30, 1933. Over {{the next}} few months, during the so-called Gleichschaltung, Hitler dispensed {{with the need for}} the Reichstag of the Weimar Republic as a legislative body and eliminated all rival political parties in Germany, so that by the middle of 1933 the country had become a one-party state under his direction and control. Hitler did not exercise absolute power, however, despite his swift consolidation of political authority. As chancellor, Hitler did not command the army, which remained under the formal leadership of Hindenburg, a <b>highly</b> <b>respected</b> veteran field marshal. While many officers were impressed by Hitler's promises of an expanded army, a return to conscription, and a more aggressive foreign policy, the army continued to guard its traditions of independence {{during the early years of}} the Nazi regime.|$|E
5|$|This {{success in}} turn {{led to a}} vogue in America and the West for Japanese movies {{throughout}} the 1950s, replacing the enthusiasm for Italian neorealist cinema. For example, {{by the end of}} 1952 Rashamon was released in Japan, the United States, and most of Europe. Among the Japanese filmmakers whose work, as a result, began to win festival prizes and commercial release in the West were Kenji Mizoguchi (The Life of Oharu, Ugetsu, Sansho the Bailiff) and, somewhat later, Yasujirō Ozu (Tokyo Story, An Autumn Afternoon)—artists <b>highly</b> <b>respected</b> in Japan but, prior to this period, almost totally unknown in the West. Kurosawa's growing reputation among Western audiences in the 1950s would make Western audiences more sympathetic to the reception of later generations of Japanese filmmakers ranging from Kon Ichikawa, Masaki Kobayashi, Nagisa Oshima and Shohei Imamura to Juzo Itami, Takeshi Kitano and Takashi Miike.|$|E

5|$|Aldfrith {{appears to}} have had the support of leading ecclesiastics, most notably his {{half-sister}} Ælfflæd and the <b>highly</b> <b>respected</b> Bishop Cuthbert. He is known to have received confirmation at the hands of Aldhelm, later the Bishop of Sherborne in the south-western Anglo-Saxon Kingdom of Wessex. Aldhelm too had received an Irish education, but in Britain, at Malmesbury. Correspondence between the two survives, and Aldhelm sent Aldfrith his treatise on the numerology of the number seven, the Epistola ad Acircium. Aldfrith also owned a manuscript on cosmography, which (according to Bede) he purchased from Abbot Ceolfrith of Monkwearmouth-Jarrow in exchange for an estate valued at eight hides. Aldfrith was a close friend of Adomnán, Abbot of Iona from 679, and may have studied with him. In the 680s Aldfrith twice met with Adomnán, who came to seek the release of the Irish captives taken in Berht's expedition of 684. These were released and Adomnán presented Aldfrith with a copy of his treatise De Locis Sanctis ("On the Holy Places"), a description of the places of pilgrimage in the Holy Land, and at Alexandria and Constantinople. Bede reports that Aldfrith circulated Adomnán's work for others to read.|$|E
5|$|His {{family had}} no {{theatrical}} connections, but Olivier's father, a clergyman, decided {{that his son}} should become an actor. After attending a drama school in London, Olivier learned his craft in a succession of acting jobs during the late 1920s. In 1930 he had his first important West End success in Noël Coward's Private Lives, and he appeared in his first film. In 1935 he played in a celebrated production of Romeo and Juliet alongside Gielgud and Peggy Ashcroft, {{and by the end}} of the decade he was an established star. In the 1940s, together with Richardson and John Burrell, Olivier was the co-director of the Old Vic, building it into a <b>highly</b> <b>respected</b> company. There his most celebrated roles included Shakespeare's Richard III and Sophocles's Oedipus. In the 1950s Olivier was an independent actor-manager, but his stage career was in the doldrums until he joined the avant garde English Stage Company in 1957 to play the title role in The Entertainer, a part he later played on film. From 1963 to 1973 he was the founding director of Britain's National Theatre, running a resident company that fostered many future stars. His own parts there included the title role in Othello (1964) and Shylock in The Merchant of Venice (1970).|$|E
5|$|Kaʻauwai {{became an}} {{experienced}} fisherman, {{manager of the}} chief's canoes and an early physician. He worked as his headman or right-hand agent to Governor Hoapili and was effectively the Lieutenant Governor of Maui in all but name. In their first meeting in 1832, Reverend Richard Armstrong described how Hoapili trusted him with all his important business including accessing and collecting taxes, managing his property, and conducting tours of the island of Maui, and thus became a <b>highly</b> <b>respected</b> and well-loved official in the public view. In October 1851, the Privy Council of State, the advisory council for the king, recommended him {{as a candidate for}} the Governorship of Maui left vacant by the death of James Kānehoa Young, but the council eventually voted eight to three to recommended the appointment of Prince Lot Kapuāiwa (the future Kamehameha V) instead.

When Kancha requests the people to lend their lands to him under the pretext of expanding the salt industry of Mandwa, Dinanath dissuades the villagers from doing so. Knowing this, Kancha decides {{to get rid of the}} school teacher. He ambushes and murders a young girl inside the school, framing Chauhan for the murder.
