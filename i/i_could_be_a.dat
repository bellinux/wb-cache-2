He liked to live a private, hermit-like life, and once commented that [...] "For {{some of the time}} I feel <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> monk" [...] but that he [...] "couldn't cope with the celibacy." [...] A self-described [...] "solitary person", he found it somewhat annoying being a television celebrity and being recognised by members of the public.|$|E

By April, seven strippers had attended Sandals Church because of JC's Girls and strippers {{from across the}} United States had contacted the organization looking for local churches.

He recorded 30wins {{and the lowest}} GAA average of his career to that point, 3.41. The Bears finished the regular season as league leaders, and won the John D. Chick Trophy as the South Division Champions. Hextall lived up to his aggressive reputation in the Conference final, played against the St. Catharines Saints, fighting three different members of the opposition side during a single bench-clearing brawl. The Bears advanced to the Calder Cup final, having beaten the New Haven Nighthawks 4–1 and the St.Catharines Saints 4–3. In the final, they faced the Adirondack Red Wings, who won the championship by four games to two. Hextall played 13games in the playoffs, of which his team won five, and his GAA was3.23. He was named as the Dudley [...] "Red" [...] Garrett Memorial Award winner, as the AHL's outstanding rookie player. Looking back on {{his time in the}} AHL, Hextall reflected that despite his initial disappointment at not being selected to play for the Flyers straight away, [...] "the two years that I spent in the American League got me to the point where I was sure <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> No.1 goaltender at the NHL level." ...|$|E

2500|$|The three {{following}} songs, [...] "Halogen (<b>I</b> <b>Could</b> <b>Be</b> <b>a</b> Shadow)", [...] "Future Sick", and [...] "Suns Irrupt", follow {{three different}} types of forgetting a breakup. Reminiscent of music released in the New Romanticism period, [...] "Halogen (<b>I</b> <b>Could</b> <b>Be</b> <b>a</b> Shadow)" [...] was described by Méndez as [...] "a spectacularly enveloping piece," [...] with its somber instrumentation of [...] "steady, comforting percussion, delicate, inviting synths, and vintage girl group-evoking background vocals" [...] resulting in [...] "a gorgeous vessel for ecstatic release". Fitzmaurice described it as the [...] "near-double" [...] of [...] "Kim and Jessie" [...] by M83, Aizlewood compared the song to {{the works of the}} Thompson Twins, while Phares said the song sounded like music that would [...] "play over the credits of a sci-fi teen sex comedy". With its [...] "seasick synths" [...] as well as [...] "bits of arena rock guitar and girlish harmonies", the heavy, playfully sad [...] "Future Sick" [...] manages to convey [...] "the feeling of growing older in a world that's growing faster than you are". It depicts Palomo lamenting [...] "mid-volume under his own creation's drunken abstraction" [...] about wanting {{to go back into the}} past, because thinking of the future is making him ill. It is at this point where, according to The Observer, some of the wooziness that Era Extraña takes from Psychic Chasms [...] "veers into nausea". Mitchell described the instrumentation of [...] "Suns Irrupt" [...] as [...] "hypnotic and firework fizzling synths with a woozy synth background". Palomo repeatedly whisper-growls the line [...] "sSuns irrupt / I wake up I wake up", and Fitzmaurice compared its repetitiveness to [...] "Someone Great" [...] by LCD Soundsystem.|$|E
2500|$|At sixteen, then {{living on}} her own, Streisand's youth and {{ambition}} worked in her favor, but she lacked a mature woman's physical features which were needed for serious female roles. She therefore took various menial jobs {{to have some}} income. At one period, she lacked a permanent address, and found herself sleeping {{at the home of}} friends or anywhere else she could set up the army cot she carried around to save on rent expense. When desperate, she would return to her mother's flat in Brooklyn for a home-cooked meal. However, her mother would be horrified by her daughter's [...] "gypsy-like lifestyle," [...] wrote biographer Karen Swenson, and again begged her to give up trying to get into show business; but Streisand took her mother's pleadings as even more reason to keep trying: [...] "My desires were strengthened by wanting to prove to my mother that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> star." ...|$|E
2500|$|The [...] {{season was}} the first in which Button was the more {{experienced}} driver in his team. He was ambitious for the season, saying: [...] "This year <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> front-runner. We want to run alongside the top teams. I want to be consistently in the points and on the podium." [...] He took his first ever podium in the second race of the season—third-place at the Malaysian Grand Prix—saying afterwards, [...] "There are no words to describe the feeling of your first podium". He followed it up two weeks later with another third-place in Bahrain. In the next race at Imola, he took his first pole position and finished second behind Michael Schumacher. His results for the season were impressive: he took 10 podiums in 18 races, and failed to score points in only three. Button came third in the Drivers' Championship, behind the two utterly dominant Ferrari drivers, and helped BAR to take second in the Constructors' Championship.|$|E

2500|$|In an {{interview}} from October 1976 with Sounds magazine, Clapton {{said that he}} was not a political person and that his rambling remarks that night were not appropriate. However, in a 2004 interview with Uncut, Clapton referred to Powell as [...] "outrageously brave". He complained that the UK was [...] "... inviting people in as cheap labour and then putting them in ghettos". In 2004, Clapton told {{an interview}}er for Scotland on Sunday, [...] "There's no way <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> racist. It would make no sense". In his 2007 autobiography, Clapton called himself [...] "deliberately oblivious to it all" [...] and wrote, [...] "I had never really understood or been directly affected by racial conflict ... when I listened to music, I was disinterested in where the players came from or what colour their skin was. Interesting, then, that 10 years later, I would be labelled a racist." [...] In a December 2007 interview with Melvyn Bragg on The South Bank Show, Clapton reiterated his support for Enoch Powell and again denied that Powell's views were racist.|$|E
2500|$|He {{resigned}} from the advertising industry in 1964, moved into a modest apartment near the Queens-Midtown Tunnel ("It wasn’t Paris in the 1920s, but I was happy" [...] DeLillo has said of this time), and began work on his first novel. Reflecting on {{the early days of}} his writing career, he remarked: [...] "I lived in a very minimal kind of way. My telephone would be $4.20 every month. I was paying a rent of sixty dollars a month. And I was becoming a writer. So in one sense, I was ignoring the movements of the time." [...] His first novel, Americana, was written over the course of four years and finally published in 1971, to modest critical praise. Americana concerned [...] "a television network programmer who hits the road in search of the big picture". DeLillo revised the novel in 1989 for paperback re-printing. Reflecting on the novel later in his career, he admitted, [...] "I don't think my first novel would have been published today as I submitted it. I don't think an editor would have read 50 pages of it. It was very overdone and shaggy, but two young editors saw something that seemed worth pursuing and eventually we all did some work on the book and it was published." [...] Later still, DeLillo still felt a degree of surprise at Americana being published, noting [...] "I was working on my first novel, Americana, for two years before I ever realized that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> writer [...] I had absolutely no assurance that this book would be published because I knew that there were elements that I simply didn't know how to improve at that point. So I wrote for another two years and finished the novel. It wasn’t all that difficult to find a publisher, to my astonishment. I didn't have a representative. I didn’t know anything about publishing. But an editor at Houghton Mifflin read the manuscript and decided that this was worth pursuing." ...|$|E
