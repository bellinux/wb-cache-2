5000|$|Around 1862 Lindon {{sought a}} safer {{substitute}} to the pig's bladder {{and came up}} with the India rubber bladder as an alternative. India rubber was too tough to <b>inflate</b> <b>by</b> <b>mouth</b> and after seeing an ordinary medical Ear Syringe he produced a larger brass version to blow up his footballs, which he demonstrated, and won medals for, at an exhibition in London.|$|E
50|$|The {{ancestor}} of these suits was already invented in 1872 by Clark S Merriman to rescue steamship passengers. It {{was made from}} rubber sheeting and became famous by the swim records of Paul Boyton. It was essentially a pair of rubber pants and shirt cinched tight at the waist with a steel band and strap. Within the suit were five air pockets the wearer could <b>inflate</b> <b>by</b> <b>mouth</b> through hoses. Similar to modern-day drysuits, the suit also kept its wearer dry. This essentially allowed him to float on his back, using a double-sided paddle to propel himself, feet-forward. Additionally he could attach a small sail to save stamina while slowly drifting to shore (because neither emergency radio transmitters nor rescue helicopters were invented yet).|$|E

50|$|Balls {{in those}} days were not spherical, but more plum-shaped. This was because a pig's bladder was <b>inflated</b> <b>by</b> <b>mouth</b> through the snapped stem of a clay pipe then encased in panels of {{stitched}} leather. As such, the individual bladder dictated the shape of each ball.|$|R

50|$|Beach balls {{range from}} hand-sized to over 3 feet (1 m) across or bigger. They {{generally}} {{have a set}} of soft plastic panels, with two circular end panels, one with an oral inflation valve, intended to be <b>inflated</b> <b>by</b> <b>mouth</b> or pump. A common design is vertical solid colored stripes alternating with white stripes. Some are printed with advertisements or company slogans, or as globes.|$|R
5|$|Tragedy did strike Marblehead {{though in}} November 1942. As her {{whaleboat}} was being hoisted back aboard, a sailor from her landing party fell overboard {{and failed to}} ever resurface. The sailor had a newly issued style of life vest on that required being <b>inflated</b> <b>by</b> <b>mouth.</b> This incident brought Captain Chandler to order that Omahas boarding party's return to wearing the older style life jackets that had proven themselves effective {{even though they were}} more cumbersome and bulky.|$|R
50|$|The ABLJ was {{developed}} by Maurice Fenzy in 1961. Early versions were <b>inflated</b> <b>by</b> <b>mouth</b> underwater. Later versions had their own air inflation cylinder. Some had carbon dioxide inflation cartridges (a holdover, for surface use, of the Mae West flyer's lifejacket) to facilitate emergency ascent. This was abandoned when valves that allowed divers to breathe from the BC's inflation bag were introduced. The Fenzy ABLJ provided a proof of concept for buoyancy compensation, however the large-volume ring behind the diver's neck caused the jacket to ride up against the diver's throat, despite the crotch strap.|$|R

5000|$|The tsampouna (or tsambouna; τσαμπούνα) is a Greek folk {{instrument}} of the bagpipe family. It is a double-chantered bagpipe, with no drone, and is <b>inflated</b> <b>by</b> blowing <b>by</b> <b>mouth</b> into a goatskin bag. The instrument is widespread in the Greek islands. The word is a reborrowing of zampogna, the word for the Italian double chantered pipes. Tsampouna is etymologically related to the Greek sumfōnia (συμφωνία), meaning [...] "concord or unison of sound" [...] (from σῠν- sun-, [...] "with, together" [...] + φωνή phōnḗ, [...] "sound") and applied later to a type of bagpipe.|$|R
50|$|Unlike other bagpipes, the koza {{has three}} drones: {{one in the}} {{separate}} drone-pipe, and two in the chanter, which has three channels.This wind instrument consists of a single reed pipe, often made of a cane blade lapped onto copper tubing set into motion when wind is fed by arm pressure on a goat-skin bag. The pipe is held in a wooden socket tied into the bag, which is <b>inflated</b> <b>by</b> the <b>mouth</b> (through a blowpipe with a leather nonreturn valve). The finger holes of the pipe, or chanter, play melodies while the remaining pipes, or drones, sound single notes tuned against the chanter by means of extendable joints.|$|R
5|$|Baleen whales {{use their}} baleen plates to sieve plankton, among others, {{out of the}} water; {{there are two types}} of methods: lunge-feeding and gulp-feeding. Lunge-feeders expand the volume of their jaw to a volume bigger than the {{original}} volume of the whale itself <b>by</b> <b>inflating</b> their <b>mouth.</b> This causes grooves on their throat to expand, increasing the amount of water the mouth can store. They ram a baitball at high speeds in order to feed, but this is only energy-effective when used against a large baitball. Gulp-feeders swim with an open mouth, filling it with water and prey. Prey must occur in sufficient numbers to trigger the whale's interest, be within a certain size range so that the baleen plates can filter it, and be slow enough so that it cannot escape.|$|R

50|$|The Dacor Seachute BC4 had unique {{upper and}} lower bladders. The upper bladder was around the neck and could be <b>inflated</b> <b>by</b> the CO2 {{cartridge}} {{for use as a}} surface life jacket. The lower bladder was over the diver's stomach area, and was <b>inflated</b> <b>by</b> LP gas from the regulator, for buoyancy control underwater. This arrangement provided better buoyancy distribution for trim control while diving than most other front inflation systems.|$|R
40|$|A {{route in}} the Internet {{may take a}} longer AS path than the {{shortest}} AS path due to routing policies. In this paper, we systematically analyze AS paths and quantify {{the extent to which}} routing policies inflate AS paths. The results show that AS path inflation in the Internet is more prevalent than expected. We first present the extent of AS path inflation observed from the Route View routing tables. From an ISP, at least 55 % of AS paths are <b>inflated</b> <b>by</b> at least one AS hop and AS paths can be <b>inflated</b> <b>by</b> as long as 6 AS hops. We then employ two typical routing policies to show the extent of AS path inflation for all AS pairs, we find that at least 45 % of AS paths are <b>inflated</b> <b>by</b> at least one AS hop and AS paths can be <b>inflated</b> <b>by</b> as long as 9 AS hops. Quantifying AS path inflation in the Internet has important implications on the extent of routing policies and traffic engineering performed on the Internet, and BGP convergence speed...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: Cuff {{pressure}} in endotracheal tubes {{should be in}} the range of 26 – 30 cm H 2 O. In this study we aimed to examine whether anesthesiologist’s experience is important while inflating the endotracheal tube correctly after the intubation. Materials and methods: The patients who were included to the study were intubated after the induction of general anesthesia. The patients were divided into 4 groups according to the training year of the anesthesia research assistant resident inflating the endotracheal tube (ET) cuff. Group I (n= 64) the cuff pressure which were <b>inflated</b> <b>by</b> the first year residents; Group II (n= 92) the cuff pressure which were <b>inflated</b> <b>by</b> the 2 nd year residents; Group III (n= 144) the cuff pressure which were <b>inflated</b> <b>by</b> the 3 rd year residents; Group IV (n= 93) the cuff pressure which were <b>inflated</b> <b>by</b> the 4 th year residents were measured by manometer. Results: When we compared the cases in which the cuff pressure were between 26 - 30 cm H 2 O we found that the best results were in Group II and respectively in Group III and IV and the worst results were in Group I. The difference between Group II and Group I were statistically significant (p< 0. 05). Conclusion: We believe that manometer should be used ET for cuff pressure setting and monitoring.
