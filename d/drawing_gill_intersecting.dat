5000|$|Gill's style, {{subsequently}} much imitated, {{was noted}} for the enlargement of his subjects' heads, which sat upon undersized bodies. [...] His caricatures, {{in the form}} of large hand-colored, lithographic portraits, were considered very accurate and not very cruel. Thus, many of Gill's famous contemporaries wished to be <b>drawn</b> by him. <b>Gill</b> <b>drew</b> portrait caricatures of Sarah Bernhardt, Otto von Bismarck, Émile Zola, Victor Hugo, Nadar, Giuseppe Garibaldi, Adelina Patti, Charles Dickens, and Richard Wagner.|$|R
5000|$|Napoleon III {{disliked the}} {{portrait}} of him <b>drawn</b> by <b>Gill</b> in La Lune. In December 1867, the journal was censored. [...] "La Lune will have to undergo an eclipse," [...] an authority commented to Editor Francis Polo when the ban was instituted, unwittingly dubbing Polo's subsequent publication: L'Eclipse, which made its first appearance on 9 August 1868.|$|R

50|$|Thérésa (born Eugénie Emma Valladon but cited {{simply as}} Emma Valladon; 25 April 1837 — 14 May 1913) was a French singer. She often worked with Suzanne Lagier and had {{cartoons}} (caricatures) <b>drawn</b> by André <b>Gill</b> {{of her for}} the newspaper La Lune.|$|R
50|$|Gillingham {{entered the}} League Cup {{at the first}} round stage and {{defeated}} Bristol City, followed by a win over Bury in the second round. In the third round the <b>Gills</b> were <b>drawn</b> away to Bristol Rovers of the Third Division. After holding Rovers to a <b>draw,</b> the <b>Gills</b> emerged victorious in a replay at Priestfield Stadium {{to set up a}} fourth round match away to Leicester City of the First Division. Top-flight opposition proved too much for Gillingham, who were beaten 4-1 at Filbert Street.|$|R
50|$|Winde got {{his senior}} {{breakthrough}} with AaB during the 1995-96 Danish Superliga season. He was handed his Superliga debut in August 1995 by manager Sepp Piontek, replacing the injured Gill. When Gill suffered another injury in November 1995, Winde was praised for his displays for AaB. Even though Gill {{was ready for}} action in December 1995, Winde was preferred for the 1995-96 UEFA Champions League group stage game against Portuguese team FC Porto, which ended a 2-2 <b>draw.</b> As <b>Gill</b> left AaB in January 1996, Winde consolidated himself as AaB's first choice goalkeeper. He signed a two-year contract extension in May 1996.|$|R
50|$|Gibraltar Secondary School {{is part of}} the Gibraltar Area School District, and <b>draws</b> {{students}} from <b>Gills</b> Rock, Ellison Bay, Sister Bay, Ephraim, Fish Creek, Egg Harbor, and Baileys Harbor. Situated adjacent to Peninsula State Park, the school is in the Gibraltar Secondary School building, which also contains Gibraltar Middle School. The student-teacher ratio is 11:1.|$|R
5000|$|Sarge (short for [...] "Sargent," [...] as in [...] "Sargent Shriver") Steel has a {{mechanical}} left hand. As Dick Giordano {{stated in the}} editorial page of L.A.W. #4 he was created by Pat Masulli, and later written and <b>drawn</b> by Joe <b>Gill</b> and artist Dick Giordano. Other artists, including the team of Bill Montes and Ernie Bache, would later take over.|$|R
50|$|The amber {{pen shell}} burrows as it grows, but the wide {{posterior}} {{end of the}} shell always remains exposed so water from above the seafloor can be drawn through the inhalent chamber of the mantle cavity. Typical of bivalves, water is <b>drawn</b> over <b>gills</b> or ctenidium by the beating of cilia where oxygen from the water is absorbed. Suspended food and other water-borne nutrients also become trapped in mucus, which is then transported to the mouth, digested and expelled as feces. Unique gutter-like waste canals in the viscera of the inhalent chamber also help to keep gills and other organs clear from silt and other unwanted water-borne particules by expelling these as pseudofeces.|$|R
50|$|Beginning with Dell Comics' The Lone Ranger #38 (Aug. 1951) — {{the first}} issue of that title with {{original}} stories rather than reprints of the Fran Striker-Charles Flanders newspaper comic-strip — Gill and writer Paul S. Newman teamed for a nearly 11-year run chronicling the stories of that old-time radio and later television Western hero. <b>Gill</b> <b>drew</b> every issue through though #145 (July 1962), a 107-issue run that marks one of the longest of any artist on a comic-book series.|$|R
5000|$|Hazel's {{life changed}} {{dramatically}} in 1903, when Waldo died of pneumonia, leaving {{the family in}} difficult financial straits. Hazel started studying architectural drafting via a correspondence course offered by the International Correspondence School. Gill helped out by giving her lessons in perspective drawing at his office in off hours. In 1904, she was hired by Gill's firm, Hebbard and Gill, to do architectural drawings on cloth, and she was allowed to work at home. She also attended local lectures on the Arts and Crafts movement, and her own mature aesthetic would <b>draw</b> on both <b>Gill's</b> Prairie School—inspired modernism and the American Craftsman style.|$|R
5000|$|In September 1871, Gill caricatured the statesman Adolphe Thiers, {{who became}} his {{favorite}} target in L’Éclipse, which had resumed publication in June 1871. In 1872, {{his work for}} this paper became regular. In an 1873 attack against the government's censorship of his work, <b>Gill</b> <b>drew</b> [...] "L’Enterrement de la caricature" [...] ("The Funeral of Caricature") in which an artist follows a hearse that carries a dog holding a pen and a paintbrush. In 1875, he drew [...] "Le journaliste et l’avenir" [...] ("The Journalist and the Future"), in which a journalist is depicted bound and gagged.|$|R
5000|$|Some {{stories have}} {{mentioned}} that Namor has gills for breathing underwater, e.g., in Namor, the Sub-Mariner #5, Namor thinks [...] "this New York river water burns my gills and scalds my lungs". and {{artists such as}} Salvador Larroca have <b>drawn</b> him with <b>gill</b> slits {{on either side of}} his neck. In The Sub-Mariner #18-22 (1969-70), beings from outer space surgically closed Namor's gills for a time, leaving him with the ability to breathe air but unable to breathe underwater. Other sources have stated that his lungs contain oxygen diffusing membranes that allow him to breathe underwater.|$|R
50|$|P. oxyptera inhabits rivers with sandy to muddy bottom. This {{species is}} a parasite. It forages both {{during the day}} and at night, seeking the gill {{chambers}} of larger fishes, especially catfishes. It enters and leaves the gill chamber during the host's ventilating movements. There, it feeds on blood <b>drawn</b> from the <b>gill</b> filaments and may stay in the gill chamber for 1 - 3 min. When gorged with blood, the fish moves to the bottom and buries itself in the sand. A single large catfish tethered on the river bank may feed thousand of these parasitic catfish over a period of up to 6 hours. Large numbers of this fish may kill fishes tethered by fishermen.|$|R
50|$|Dactylogyrus vastator has one {{host and}} no {{intermediate}} hosts. New hosts are located and infected by free-living larvae (oncomiracidium). D. vastator {{lives in the}} gills of carp species, including goldfish. The adult lays eggs on the gill filaments which are then washed out of the gill cavity and into the water. A ciliated oncomiracidium emerges from the egg in 3-5 days, depending on water temperature. In warmer temperatures the embryo develops more rapidly. The larva emerges, leaving the embryonic membrane inside the egg. The larva is <b>drawn</b> into the <b>gill</b> cavity of a host fish, where it attaches by its hooks. The larva can also swim actively and attach to {{the skin of the}} host and migrate to the gills. The larva reaches sexual maturity about ten days later.|$|R
40|$|Freshwater mussels (Unionoida) are a {{very old}} group of bivalve {{molluscs}} found in rivers, lakes and other wetlands on all continents but Antarctica, which includes 854 species in two superfamilies (Unionoidea and Etherioidea) that are distinguished by larval forms. Larvae of Unionoids (Hyriidae, Margaritiferidae and Unionidae) are glochidia, distinct from the lasidia or haustoria of etherioids (Etheriidae, Iridinidae, Mycetopodidae). Unionoids are dioecious and reproduce sexually. Males release sperm into the water, which are then <b>drawn</b> into <b>gills</b> (ctenidia), of the females, where the eggs are fertilized within modified brood chambers (marsupia). The embryos then develop to become mature glochidia, and are brooded in the marsupia. They then attach to a suitable host, generally a fish, on the gills or body surface (often the fins or mouth) where they are encapsulated by epithelial tissue and, as obligate parasites, begin a metamorphosis and emerge as juvenile mussels. The host-glochidia relationship is an obligatory stage in {{the life cycle of}} mussels, and also provides a means of dispersal. Glochidial attachment is facilitated by specialized structures on the ventral margin of shells, known as larval teeth, which vary in morphology, but are generally hooked. In Australia, freshwater mussels are represented by 18 species (eight genera) of Hyriidae. Glochidia tooth morphology of Australian Hyriidae has been described for several species and implicated as a useful taxonomic tool to distinguish species. In this poster, we present the first images (Scanning Electron Microscopy) of Westralunio carteri Iredale, 1934 larval teeth, which appear to be unique and may have taxonomic value...|$|R
30|$|The {{location}} of different organisms on the host strongly {{depends on the}} settlement patterns of larvae (McGaw 2006) and on host-associate relationships (Dvoretsky and Dvoretsky 2010 a). Mobile organisms can select specific areas on hosts according to their preference. Colonization of the gills provides commensals with aeration and protection from predators; therefore, many copepods, including {{all but one of}} the species observed in this study, concentrate in the branchial chambers of their host. In contrast, the harpacticoid copepod D. vulgaris was not found in crab gills. This was probably due to differences in the biotic requirements of this species. T. furcata and H. uniremis usually inhabit a water layer far from the bottom and are frequently found in zooplankton samples (Johnson and Olson 1948; Jewett and Feder 1977; Dvoretsky and Dvoretsky 2010 b); thus, they may infest crabs as a result of being <b>drawn</b> into the <b>gills</b> during host respiration activity. D. vulgaris, in contrast, is a more benthic species (Kornev and Chertoprud 2008) and more often infests the host when P. camtschaticus moves along the sea floor.|$|R
5000|$|In May 1918, {{he offered}} his {{services}} as a war artist but, initially was turned down and continued {{to work as a}} camouflage instructor. After, the British War Memorials Committee did commission Gill to produce a large work for the proposed, but never built Hall of Remembrance, he was released from his duties at the Camouflage School and returned to France on 7 November 1918 to do sketches, and other work, for his BWMC commission. He stayed in France until 14 December 1918, visiting Mons only hours after it had been retaken by the Allies. At the front, Gill spent a week stationed in an artillery battery, where he suffered from frostbite. The visit to France resulted in the paintings Evening, After a Push and Heavy Artillery, the painting intended for the Hall of Remembrance and, later, Canadian Observation Post for the Canadian War Memorials scheme. For Heavy Artillery, <b>Gill</b> <b>drew</b> on his experience as a camouflage officer;- the two large howitzers in the painting both have a patchwork camouflage design and are covered in green netting to avoid detection by enemy aircraft.|$|R
2500|$|At {{the time}} of its closure in April 1981, Coldharbour Mill still had its textile {{machinery}} in position. The majority of these machines have been preserved (though not all are exhibited), and have been augmented with weaving machines rescued from the closure of the Tonedale site. The lowest part of the site, the level 1 combing shed, dealt with the initial cleaning and combing of the unwashed wool. The process involved a number of separate stages, each with a specialised machine. The eight opening gill machines (made by Taylor Wadsworth & Co)opened up the fleeces and prepared the wool for washing in a large back-washer with steam heated rollers. Following the washing, further gill boxes produced successively combed fibres, which were passed to a circular Noble combing machine. [...] This machine separated the fibres into long [...] "Tops" [...] and the short poor quality fibres. Although these machines are preserved on site, they are no longer in use today. British wool tops are purchased in, dyed into standard colours, and then up to ten strands of tops are fed into the <b>Intersecting</b> <b>Gill</b> Box (manufactured by Prince Smith and Stells in 1959). [...] The gill box starts the process of drawing out the fibres, and also enables new colours to be created by blending together the standard colours. The output of the gill box is termed a sliver. This particular machine has a mechanism to ensure the weight of the sliver is constant, which is important to ensure the final yarn thickness is constant.|$|R
40|$|In this study, we {{investigated}} if industrial high-density polyethylene (HDPE) particles, a model microplastic free of additives, ranging > 0 − 80 μm are ingested and taken {{up into the}} cells and tissue of the blue mussel Mytilus edulis L. The effects of exposure (up to 96 h) and plastic ingestion were observed at the cellular and subcellular level. Microplastic uptake into the gills and digestive gland was analyzed by a new method using polarized light microscopy. Mussel health status was investigated incorporating histological assessment and cytochemical biomarkers of toxic effects and early warning. In addition to being <b>drawn</b> into the <b>gills,</b> HDPE particles were taken up into the stomach and transported into the digestive gland where they accumulated in the lysosomal system after 3 h of exposure. Our results show notable histological changes upon uptake and a strong inflammatory response demonstrated by the formation of granulocytomas after 6 h and lysosomal membrane destabilization, which significantly increased with longer exposure times. We provide proof of principle that microplastics are taken up into cells and cause significant effects on the tissue and cellular level, which can be assessed with standard cytochemical biomarkers and polarized light microscopy for microplastic tracking in tissue...|$|R
5000|$|In Avatar, the Naʼvi are an {{indigenous}} species that live on Pandora. They are humanoid in appearance and are 9 to 10 ft tall, having pairs of eyes, ears, arms, {{legs and feet}} like humans, {{as well as a}} nose, a mouth, and expressions recognizable to humans. The Naʼvi differ from humans in having blue striped skin, pointed and mobile ears, large eyes, catlike noses and teeth, tails, and hands each with three fingers and a thumb (hybrid avatars, on the other hand, retain the five-fingered hands of their human DNA). While taller than humans, they have narrower proportions in body frame. Their bones are reinforced with naturally occurring carbon fiber. The Naʼvi also have a distinctive tendril feature protruding from the back of their heads, surrounded by hair (resembling a long plait or queue), feeding directly into the brain. This organ allows them to connect with other organisms around them, transferring electrochemical signals such as thoughts and memories to the trees, plants, and other creatures. In the original script, Cameron refers to these as [...] "Jubilees", although the word is not used in the film and may be changed by the time the novel is published. The Naʼvi were initially conceived to be more alien in appearance. Cameron recalled that when one of the main characters, Neytiri, was originally <b>drawn,</b> she had <b>gills</b> and other protuberances. In addition to feline features, the species was redesigned to seem more human so that audiences could better relate to it.|$|R

This particular machine has a mechanism to ensure the weight of the sliver is constant, which is important to ensure the final yarn thickness is constant. The next process is to draw the slivers out further, and to give the fibres a small twist to strengthen the resulting slubbing such that it can be wound onto a bobbin. At Coldharbour Mill, this is demonstrated on a Price Smith and Stells draw box of 1959. The bobbins from this machine are then placed in a further draw box by Prince Smith and Stells, this time an 1898 machine, and the thread from a pair of bobbins is drawn out to a seventh of its diameter, and given a light twist. If this output is to be used for Aran yarn production, it is termed a roving, and is sent on to the spinning frame. However, if the slubbing is for double knitting yarn, the slubbing must go through another reduction on a draw box.|$|R
