40|$|A <b>Priority</b> <b>Interrupt</b> Controller is a {{hardware}} designed chip which {{acts as an}} overall system manager to efficiently handle the multiple interrupts that tend to occur from the varied number of peripheral devices. Hence, it relieves the system‟s CPU from the task of polling in a multilevel priority system. This paper deals with implementation of a <b>Priority</b> <b>Interrupt</b> Controller using Verilog language. During the implementation, the Verilog code has been written for all the internal registers of the <b>Priority</b> <b>Interrupt</b> Controller {{so that it can}} accomplish its task of prioritizing the various interrupts and thereby increasing the efficiency of the processor. In this paper the entire functional block was sub divided into various modules like vector address module, command register module, mask register module and finally it was integrated into a single unit to accomplish specified tasks.

40|$|Abstract — Many modern radios used in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are packet based. That is, {{all data}} sent and {{received}} is in packet form. Where duty cycled communication is used {{a sequence of}} repeated small packets, which we call framelets, are broadcast for long enough to ensure an overlap with the receiver’s listen time. In event driven WSNs or where there are heterogeneous sensor nodes there arises a need to support various levels of performance for various packet types since some packets {{may be more important}} than others. We propose the use of a <b>priority</b> <b>interrupt</b> mechanism that operates on the Media Access Control (MAC) layer. A node with a high priority packet to send can interrupt and seize a busy channel from lower priority traffic using a <b>priority</b> <b>interrupt</b> packet sent in the gap between two framelets. This ensures that high priority packets are sent with minimal channel access time, even in a congested channel. I...|$|R
50|$|Most {{processors}} include store {{operations that}} are not atomic with respect to memory. These include multiple words stores and string operations. Should a high <b>priority</b> <b>interrupt</b> occur when {{a portion of the}} store is complete, the operation must be completed when the interrupt level is returned. The routine that processes the interrupt must not access the memory being changed. It is important to take this into account when writing interrupt routines.|$|R
50|$|Real time {{activities}} have an unlimited processor quantum and run without switching unless {{interrupted by a}} higher priority real time activity or High Exec activity. Real Time activities are given control of any available processor that is running something of lower <b>priority.</b> <b>Interrupts</b> are sent between processors when necessary to ensure immediate availability. Real time is used by customers to fly missiles, run simulators, and other functions that require immediate response.|$|R
40|$|FrameComm is a {{contention}} based, duty cycled, MAC protocol {{that ensures}} a message will be transmitted during the receiverpsilas listen phase {{by sending a}} packet, followed by a short gap, repeatedly for a precalculated number of times or until an acknowledgment is received. While introducing duty cycled communications can yield large power savings it does so {{at the cost of}} increased delay and decreased throughput. Many WSNs may incorporate several distinct message types of varying priority. A node with a high priority message to send may find the channel to be busy with a lesser priority message from another node and must therefore dasiaback-offpsila leading to further delays. In a multi-hop environment, these delays are compounded and may become unacceptably large. This paper proposes adding a high <b>priority</b> <b>interrupt</b> message to FrameComm that allows a node with important data to send to interrupt another nodepsilas lesser priority transmission giving immediate access to the channel.

5000|$|Even in a CPU which {{supports}} nested interrupts, a handler is often reached with all interrupts globally masked by a CPU hardware operation. In this architecture, an interrupt handler would normally save the smallest amount of context necessary, and then reset the global interrupt disable flag {{at the first}} opportunity, to permit higher <b>priority</b> <b>interrupts</b> to interrupt the current handler. It is also important for the interrupt handler to quell the current interrupt source by some method (often toggling a flag bit of some kind in a peripheral register) so that the current interrupt isn't immediately repeated on handler exit, resulting in an infinite loop.|$|R
50|$|FLIHs which service {{hardware}} typically mask their associated interrupt (or keep it masked as {{the case}} may be) until they complete their execution. An (unusual) FLIH which unmasks its associated interrupt before it completes is called a reentrant interrupt handler. Reentrant interrupt handlers might cause a stack overflow from multiple preemptions by the same interrupt vector, and so they are usually avoided. In a <b>priority</b> <b>interrupt</b> system, the FLIH also (briefly) masks other interrupts of equal or lesser priority.|$|R

50|$|The <b>priority</b> <b>{{interrupt}}</b> feature added thirty-two interrupt {{levels to}} the standard five. This used locations '800'x to '9FF'x for {{the old and new}} program status word locations. An eight bit interrupt description from the interrupting device was stored in bit positions 24 to 31 of the corresponding old PSW. Bits 16-23 of the new PSW were used as a mask which was XORed with the interrupt description to modify the address from the new PSW, effectively allowing indexing into a jump table for the interrupt according to data sent by the device. The interrupts were numbered from 0 (highest priority) to 31 (lowest); a higher <b>priority</b> <b>interrupt</b> could interrupt processing of a lower priority. A 32 bit Priority Mask Register, set by the Change Priority Mask instruction, could be used to selectively mask interrupts to keep them in pending status until the mask was reset. The instruction could enable levels tagged by 1 bits, disable levels tagged by 0 bits cancel levels tagged by 1 bits, or cancel and enable levels tagged by 1 bits depending on the value of the I2 field. The Load PSW Special instruction was used to exit an interrupt routine resume the next highest priority routine or non-interrupt code.|$|R
