5|$|Hilde {{appears as}} a slender woman with long, red hair. Her primary {{appearance}} encases her fully in form-fitting body armor, with red and black fabric underneath. A wolf's head, the character's family symbol, extends from the right pauldron and covers her helmet's visor, while the left pauldron is covered by red fabric, fastened {{to the center of}} her breastplate's collar underneath a large brooch. Beneath the armor, a red coat covers her torso, the tail of which extends past her waist. Her alternate character design consists of a long, blue dress, extending to her feet and neck, exposing <b>her</b> <b>shoulders</b> <b>and</b> angled towards her right leg. White gloves, shoes, and stockings cover her arms and legs, while a darker colored sash surrounds her waist and midsection, also angled to the right.|$|E
5|$|The {{panel is}} the {{smallest}} extant work by van der Weyden and follows the tradition of a Madonna Lactans, with significant differences. Christ {{is dressed in a}} red garment, as opposed to the swaddling he usually wears in 15th-century Virgin and Child portrayals. This is one of two exceptions where he is fully clothed; the other is Robert Campin's Madonna in Frankfurt, where he is shown in blue clothing. Mary's unbound blond hair falls across <b>her</b> <b>shoulders</b> <b>and</b> down across her arms. Showing the influence of Campin, it is brushed behind the ears. She wears a crown as Queen of Heaven and a ring on a finger as the Bride of Christ. Reinforcing this, the blue colour of her robe alludes to her devotion and fidelity to her son. The folds of her dress are reminiscent of the lengthy, crisp, curved intertwined gowns of Gothic sculpture.|$|E

25|$|She had visible tan {{lines from}} a halter top or bikini, {{suggesting}} {{that she may}} have come from a region with abundant October–November sunshine, as sun tanning beds were uncommon in the 1970s, and upstate New York is not generally warm or sunny enough for such tanning during that period. There were freckles on the backs of <b>her</b> <b>shoulders</b> <b>and</b> acne on her face and chest.|$|E
500|$|Tifa was {{designed}} to use the [...] "monk" [...] character class that appears in previous games in the series. She has long, black hair in a style resembling a dolphin's tail at the tip, and garments described as simple and monotone, consisting of a white tank top and black miniskirt. She also wears red boots and gloves, and sleeves extend up her arms from her wrists to her elbows, with suspenders connecting her skirt to <b>her</b> <b>shoulders,</b> <b>and</b> a large metal guard covering her left elbow. She stands about 5feet 6inches (167cm) tall, and has measurements of 36-24-35" [...] (92-60-88cm).|$|E
500|$|The seventh {{match was}} between Melina and Torrie Wilson (managed by Candice Michelle, {{who was also}} the guest referee), in a Bra and Panties match. The only way to win a [...] "Bra and Panties" [...] match is for a wrestler to strip her {{opponent}} down to her underwear. At {{the start of the}} match, Melina pulled off Wilson's shirt to reveal her bra, but Wilson retaliated and pulled off Melina's shirt. Wilson then lifted Melina to <b>her</b> <b>shoulders</b> <b>and</b> dropped her to the mat, while she attempted to pull off her pants, but Melina countered the attack by pulling Wilson's pants off to win the match. Afterward, Michelle stripped Melina and then removed her own clothes, as well.|$|E

500|$|The single cover artwork for [...] "Obsessed" [...] {{features}} Carey {{leaning against}} a dirty concrete wall. She is shown wearing black underwear and a matching sheer top, with a black bra visible through the shirt. Carey's hair is featured in a long and wet style, cascading over <b>her</b> <b>shoulders</b> <b>and</b> right breast. The word [...] "Obsessed" [...] is written in large white letters over Carey's body. An anonymous writer for MTV described it as [...] "wet and raunchy", while writing, [...] "As {{you can see here}} the star has chosen a sexy shot to launch material from her next album. Mariah is shown busting out of a revealing black top and wearing black underwear." ...|$|E
500|$|Mick Lasalle {{from the}} San Francisco Chronicle {{responded with a}} more mixed review, stating, [...] "xpect this film to satisfy its fans. Everybody else, {{get ready for a}} bizarre soap opera/pageant, {{consisting}} of a succession of static scenes with characters loping into the frame to announce exactly what they're thinking." [...] Digital Spy gave the film 2 stars out of 5, praising Kristen Stewart for [...] "carrying the film on <b>her</b> <b>shoulders</b> <b>and,</b> once again, bringing plenty of soul to a character who might otherwise come across as self-indulgent", but was critical of its lack of action, ultimately calling it [...] "a draining experience". Roger Ebert gave the film 1 star out of 4 and said that it [...] "takes the tepid achievement of Twilight, guts it, and leaves it for undead." [...] Richard Roeper graded New Moon with a C− and called it a [...] "plodding, achingly slow, 130-minute chapter in the saga".|$|E
500|$|Scribner's {{published}} the novel on 22October 1926. [...] Its first edition consisted of 5090 copies, selling at $2.00 per copy. Cleonike Damianakes illustrated the dust jacket with a Hellenistic {{design of a}} seated, robed woman, her head bent to her shoulder, eyes closed, one hand holding an apple, <b>her</b> <b>shoulders</b> <b>and</b> a thigh exposed. Editor Maxwell Perkins intended [...] "Cleon's respectably sexy" [...] design to attract [...] "the feminine readers who control the destinies of so many novels". Two months later the book was in a second printing with 7000 copies sold. Subsequent printings were ordered; by 1928, {{after the publication of}} Hemingway's short story collection Men Without Women, the novel was in its eighth printing. In 1927 the novel was published in the UK by Jonathan Cape, titled Fiesta, without the two epigraphs. Two decades later, in 1947, Scribner's released three of Hemingway's works as a boxed set, including The Sun Also Rises, A Farewell to Arms, and For Whom the Bell Tolls.|$|E

500|$|The {{video was}} heavily derided by critics. Jason Lipshutz of Billboard panned it as [...] "even more {{abhorrent}} than the song." [...] While acknowledging that the album's previous videos were [...] "excellent", {{he pointed out}} that the [...] "Hello Kitty" [...] video [...] "tries to do nothing. Its laziness is demonstrated in the first 21 seconds, during which Lavigne holds a plush stack of cupcakes, shakes her hips, stares at the cupcakes, bounces <b>her</b> <b>shoulders,</b> <b>and</b> then, when she sings the line 'Someone chuck a cupcake at me'... tosses the fake cupcakes at the camera, her lip movement not matching up to the backing track whatsoever." [...] Alexa Camp of Slant Magazine called it [...] "truly eyebrow-raising, taking cultural mis-appropriation to cringe-inducing levels." [...] The Independent suggested that [...] "'Hello Kitty' will make your eyes and ears bleed", while Jezebel wrote: [...] "It looks like what would happen if someone scraped off the diseased underbelly of American pop culture from 2004-2010 and sprinkled it generously over a festering pile of garbage." ...|$|E
500|$|The player {{controls}} Ōkami Amaterasu, {{the goddess}} of the sun, {{in the form of}} a white wolf. Amaterasu is referred to in the Japanese and European version of the game as a female, while in the North American version she was genderless although she is referred as the [...] "mother of all". While Amaterasu, when endowed with ink power, is seen by the player with red markings, cloud-like fur on <b>her</b> <b>shoulders,</b> <b>and</b> weapons on her back, most of the human characters in the game only see her as a plain white wolf; some believe Amaterasu to be the reincarnation of Shiranui (the white wolf that fought Orochi 100 years prior to the game's present), and do not recognize her spiritual nature. If the player depletes their power by overuse of the celestial brush, Amaterasu will temporarily revert to this mundane white form. Issun, an arrogant, inch-tall [...] "wandering artist" [...] seeking out the thirteen Celestial Brush techniques for himself, accompanies Amaterasu (whom he calls [...] "Ammy" [...] or [...] "furball"), and serves as a guide, dialogue [...] and as comic relief. He grows in character along with Ammy throughout the game, becoming her true friend, inspiration and eventually her savior.|$|E
500|$|Sil first {{tries to}} mate with a man she meets at a nightclub (Anthony Guidera), but after sensing that he is diabetic, she rejects him. Unsatisfied, he [...] tries to rape her, {{prompting}} her to kill him by puncturing his skull with her tongue. She then tries {{to mate with}} John Carey (Whip Hubley), a man she meets after a car accident. They swim in Carey's pool where Sil forces him to open his swimming trunks in order to mate, but he refuses. This act is interrupted by Preston and Laura. She kills Carey, morphing into her alien form, a bipedal mutant with tentacles on <b>her</b> <b>shoulders</b> <b>and</b> back, and flees naked into a forest without being seen by the team. She pretends to be a rape victim to kidnap a woman (Marliese K. Schneider) in order to assume her identity. Sitting in the car near Carey's home, she reads Fitch's lips, as she had done earlier, learning of their plan to stake out the Nightclub for her return. There, she is seen by Dan, prompting a car chase. She fakes her death by crashing the car, which she has previously filled with gasoline containers, into a high-voltage transformer, using the kidnapped woman as a stand-in for her own body.|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Come Back to Me" [...] was {{directed}} by Chris Applebaum. The video was first shown on Disney Channel on August 25, 2006, following the premiere of The Cheetah Girls 2. Hudgens walks onto the set of a music video, applies her makeup and changes her shoes. She then performs while dancing against a brightly lit backdrop. Next, she is shown performing and dancing in a black room with numerous chandeliers flickering on and off. She later appears on a red stage with circles flickering in various colors. Afterwards, more shots of the black room is shown, including one in which she is swinging on a chandelier. In the last scene, she sings and dances {{in front of a}} colorful background. Black-and-white shots of her and her friends are interspersed throughout the video, and Hudgens' friend, actress Alexa Nikolas, makes an appearance. The Arizona Republic writer Bill Goodykoontz wrote that Hudgens shows a somewhat mature side in the video: [...] "hen your only context for ever having seen Hudgens is starring as Gabriella, the sweet little brainiac in High School Musical, it's certainly different to see her flouncing around in spaghetti-strap tops, rolling <b>her</b> <b>shoulders</b> <b>and</b> whatnot." [...] A director's cut version of the video appears on the physical release of the single.|$|E
500|$|Several critics {{had mixed}} {{feelings}} about the film. Sukanya Verma of Rediff.com praised the subtle and refreshing humour, noting that [...] "Gowariker shows a flair for light scenes and creating atmospheric nuances" [...] but criticising the loopy screenplay. Verma called it [...] "ultimately a performance-oriented film", stating: [...] "A terrific ensemble cast {{from the world of}} television and theatre collaborate to its feel-good believability which lasts as long as their screen time." [...] She particularly praised Chopra's performance and wrote: [...] "Priyanka Chopra transforms into 12 new skins with astonishing distinction, voice and spirit. The actress reinvents herself into this unique individual every single time ranging from batty, bashful and boisterous. This is simply her show." [...] Sonia Chopra of Sify also gave a mixed review, noting that the film could have been hugely entertaining but was affected by [...] "a repetitive layout and agonising length". She believed that the film was watchable because of Priyanka Chopra's [...] "consistently stellar act"; she carried the film ably on <b>her</b> <b>shoulders</b> <b>and</b> gave [...] "a fun and uninhibited performance." [...] Namrata Joshi of Outlook gave the film 2 stars out of 4. She thought that Chopra played her characters [...] "competently, confidently but a bit unevenly" [...] and wrote: [...] "The one trump card for the film is the new queen bee Priyanka Chopra. The film is out-and-out a Priyanka show as she hogs screen time and audience attention with her 12 roles." ...|$|E
500|$|Discussing the character's death, Digital Spy's Kris Green praised Crace's acting. He {{compared}} Danielle's {{revelation that}} Ronnie {{was her mother}} to the EastEnders storyline several years previously, when Kat Slater (Jessie Wallace) revealed she was actually the mother of her supposed sister Zoe (Michelle Ryan). Green opined: [...] "Although it didn't quite capture the magic of [...] it definitely comes an extremely close second." [...] He concluded: [...] "I'd probably {{go as far as}} to say that it's one of the best episodes EastEnders has produced in a long time". The episode was selected as recommended viewing by The Guardian Sarah Dempster. Simon called it [...] "the EastEnders episode of the year", though was again critical of Danielle, writing: [...] "As a nation we've been driven mad by Danielle screwing up her forehead, shrugging <b>her</b> <b>shoulders</b> <b>and</b> walking around like a wide eyed simpleton. She isn't the first person in the world to track down their biological mother and while it's seldom easy, I can't imagine it's ever been quite so hard as Danielle has made it." [...] Writing for The Times, Tim Teeman was critical of the length of time it took for the storyline to conclude, calling it [...] "the most drawn-out 'reveal' in soapland". He deemed Ashdown's scripting of Danielle's exit to be [...] "mad crescendo after mad crescendo", and the storyline as a whole [...] "implausible", concluding that by the time Danielle died in Ronnie's arms: [...] "EastEnders had hit the misery mother lode." ...|$|E
