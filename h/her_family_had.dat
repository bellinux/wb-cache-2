By 1854, when Houston told Reverend Samson he felt compelled to make a public profession of faith, perhaps {{on the floor of}} the United States Senate, Margaret and <b>her</b> <b>family</b> <b>had</b> spent 14 years influencing her husband's faith. Ultimately, he decided to make the profession among those who knew him best in Texas.|$|E
5|$|At 1:24 pm, Murray emailed a work {{supervisor}} of the nursing school faculty {{that she would be}} out of town for a week due to a death in her family; no one in <b>her</b> <b>family</b> <b>had</b> died. She also said she would contact them when she returned. At 2:05 pm she called a number which provides recorded information about booking hotels in Stowe, Vermont. The call lasted approximately five minutes. At 2:18 pm, she telephoned her boyfriend and left a voice message promising him they would talk later. This call ended after one minute.|$|E
5|$|After her graduation, Simone {{spent the}} summer of 1950 at the Juilliard School, as a student of Carl Friedberg, {{preparing}} for an audition at the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia. Her application, however, was denied. As <b>her</b> <b>family</b> <b>had</b> relocated to Philadelphia in the expectation of her entry to Curtis, the blow to her aspirations was particularly heavy, and she suspected that her application had been denied because of racial prejudice. Discouraged, she took private piano lessons with Vladimir Sokoloff, a professor at Curtis, but never re-applied to the institution. She {{took a job as}} a photographer's assistant, but also found work as an accompanist at Arlene Smith's vocal studio and taught piano from her home in Philadelphia.|$|E

5|$|As life in Armenia grew {{relatively}} more stable under Soviet rule, Bagramyan sought {{to locate a}} woman he had met several years earlier, Tamara Hamayakovna. Tamara, who was at this time living in Nakhichevan with <b>her</b> <b>family,</b> <b>had</b> been married to an Armenian officer {{who had been killed}} during the Turkish-Armenian war, leaving her with their one-year-old son, Movses. Bagramyan visited her and the two decided to get married at the end of 1922. In addition to their son Movses, who {{went on to become a}} painter, they had a daughter, Margarit, who later became a doctor. Tamara remained at Bagramyan's side until her death in 1973.|$|E
5|$|As {{much of her}} {{property}} had been confiscated by the Soviet Union and the Greek republican government, most of her estate comprised jewelry reported in The Times to be worth £100,000 (equivalent to more than £ today). This was shared between her children {{and the children of}} Constantine I. Traumatized by the events of the Russian Revolution, Olga wished to sever all ties with the country in which <b>her</b> <b>family</b> <b>had</b> been massacred. Before dying, she made her grandson, King George II, swear to repatriate the ashes of her daughter Princess Alexandra, buried in the Peter and Paul Cathedral in Saint Petersburg. Her wish was fulfilled in 1940 after his restoration to the Greek throne.|$|E
5|$|It {{was around}} this time that she {{switched}} from attending the local Congregational church, {{where she had been}} baptised and in which she and <b>her</b> <b>family</b> <b>had</b> always been active members, to the Anglican church. The change was prompted in part by a decline in Congregational attendance that began in 1828 when its popular pastor, John Gleed, a fellow fossil collector, left for the United States to campaign against slavery. He was replaced by the less likeable Ebenezer Smith. The greater social respectability of the established church, in which some of Anning's gentleman geologist customers such as Buckland, Conybeare, and Sedgwick were ordained clergy, was also a factor. Anning, who was devoutly religious, actively supported her new church as she had her old.|$|E

5|$|Paranhos {{was born}} on 16 March 1819 in Salvador, Bahia, {{at a time when}} Brazil was a kingdom united with Portugal. His parents were Agostinho da Silva Paranhos and Josefa Emerenciana de Barreiros. Agostinho Paranhos, along with his two brothers, {{migrated}} to Brazil during {{the first decade of the}} 19th century. He became a wealthy merchant and married Josefa, the Brazilian-born daughter of one of Bahia's long-established families. <b>Her</b> <b>family</b> <b>had</b> roots in Porto, where Agostinho's own family had originated. Agostinho remained loyal to Portugal at the time of Brazil's Independence in 1822, which resulted in his ostracism and the collapse of his business.|$|E
5|$|Elda Emma Anderson {{was born}} in Green Lake, Wisconsin, on October 5, 1899, to Edwin A. Anderson (born in Wisconsin) and his wife, Lena (née Heller) (born in Germany). Anderson {{was one of three}} children. Although she was captivated by numbers at an early age, Anderson {{actually}} sought to become a kindergarten teacher. This would shift to an interest in science later, partially due to the influence of her older sister, who was an assistant chemistry instructor. As a whole, although <b>her</b> <b>family</b> <b>had</b> certain lofty expectations for their younger daughter, they all supported her in her academic endeavors. Anderson earned a Bachelor of Arts (AB) degree from Ripon College in 1922, then a master of arts (AM) in physics from the University of Wisconsin in 1924. From 1924 to 1927, she taught at Estherville Junior College in Iowa, where she was the dean of physics, chemistry and mathematics. In 1929, she became professor of physics at Milwaukee-Downer College, then head of the physics department in 1934.|$|E
5|$|<b>Her</b> <b>family</b> <b>had</b> been {{relatively}} obscure until 1852, when her father, Prince Christian of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg, was chosen {{with the consent}} of the great powers to succeed his distant cousin, Frederick VII, to the Danish throne. At the age of sixteen, she was chosen as the future wife of Albert Edward, Prince of Wales, the heir apparent of Queen Victoria. They married eighteen months later in 1863, the same year her father became king of Denmark as Christian IX and her brother was appointed to the vacant Greek throne as George I. She was Princess of Wales from 1863 to 1901, the longest anyone has ever held that title, and became generally popular; her style of dress and bearing were copied by fashion-conscious women. Largely excluded from wielding any political power, she unsuccessfully attempted to sway the opinion of British ministers and her husband's family to favour Greek and Danish interests. Her public duties were restricted to uncontroversial involvement in charitable work.|$|E

5|$|McGovern {{was born}} in the 600‑person farming {{community}} of Avon, South Dakota. His father, Rev. Joseph C. McGovern, born in 1868, was pastor of the local Wesleyan Methodist Church there. Joseph – the son of an alcoholic who had immigrated from Ireland – had grown up in several states, working in coal mines from the age of nine and parentless from the age of thirteen. He had been a professional baseball player in the minor leagues, but had given it up due to his teammates' heavy drinking, gambling and womanizing, and entered the seminary instead. George's mother was the former Frances McLean, born c. 1890 and initially raised in Ontario; <b>her</b> <b>family</b> <b>had</b> later moved to Calgary, Alberta, and then she came to South Dakota looking for work as a secretary. George was the second oldest of four children. Joseph McGovern's salary never reached $100 per month, and he often received compensation in the form of potatoes, cabbages, or other food items. Joseph and Frances McGovern were both firm Republicans, but were not politically active or doctrinaire.|$|E
5|$|When Empress Dowager Deng died, Emperor An (r.106–125 AD) was {{convinced}} by the accusations of the eunuchs Li Run (李閏) and Jiang Jing (江京) that Deng and <b>her</b> <b>family</b> <b>had</b> planned to depose him. An dismissed Deng's clan members from office, exiled them and forced many to commit suicide. After An's death, his wife, Empress Dowager Yan (d.126 AD) placed the child Marquess of Beixiang {{on the throne}} {{in an attempt to}} retain power within her family. However, palace eunuch Sun Cheng (d.132 AD) masterminded a successful overthrow of her regime to enthrone Emperor Shun of Han (r.125–144 AD). Yan was placed under house arrest, her relatives were either killed or exiled, and her eunuch allies were slaughtered. The regent Liang Ji (d.159 AD), brother of Empress Liang Na (d.150 AD), had the brother-in-law of Consort Deng Mengnü (later empress) (d.165 AD) killed after Deng Mengnü resisted Liang Ji's attempts to control her. Afterward, Emperor Huan employed eunuchs to depose Liang Ji, who was then forced to commit suicide.|$|E
5|$|Hensley {{had five}} {{children}} {{with his second}} wife, Irene. She was from a prosperous Lutheran family of German descent but believed that she was suffering a curse. She and <b>her</b> <b>family</b> <b>had</b> hoped that Hensley could free her from the curse, but ultimately {{felt that he was}} unable to. The marriage was contentious because of Hensley's frequent unemployment and poor treatment of Irene. He found intermittent work, including bricklaying, but Irene's family had to help support them; her mother provided the family with clothing. After seven years of marriage, Irene left Hensley and returned to her family, although she returned to Hensley and reconciled with him. One of their sons recalled that Irene was much more religious than Hensley, whom he claims only spoke about spiritual matters if there were church leaders present. Hensley was again separated from Irene around 1941. The cause of the estrangement is unknown, although one of their sons claimed that she threatened to have him arrested. She reconciled with him after he promised to find steady employment, and they returned to Pineville with their children. Hensley wanted to put their children in an orphanage so Irene could travel with him, but she refused. After a visit from her sister, Irene again left him; she and her children went to live with Hensley's children from his first marriage. A divorce was granted in 1943. Irene later died of complications following surgery for goiter. Hensley attended the wake and visited his children, but departed without them and did not return.|$|E

5|$|Jacqui meets {{homeless}} teenager Phoebe Jackson (Mandip Gill) {{and invites}} {{her to move}} into her flat. At Tony and Cindy Cunningham (Stephanie Waring)'s wedding, a bus crashes in to the venue. Rhys becomes trapped under the debris and apologises to Jacqui as he dies in her arms. Jacqui returns home to discover Rhys had planned to leave her and had left a note, detailing his plans to leave her and his affair with a mystery woman. Jacqui becomes suspicious that Cindy {{was having an affair}} with Rhys. Jacqui confronts Cindy who is with Bart's pregnant girlfriend Sinead O'Connor. She accuses Cindy only for Sinead to confess to having sex with Rhys. Jacqui confronts Sinead and realises Rhys is the father of her baby. She allows Sinead to keep the baby's paternity a secret when Bart proposes to her. On Christmas Day at the McQueens, which Tony and Cindy have both been invited to, Jacqui discovers items belonging to Rhys in the closet, including his mobile phone, which <b>her</b> <b>family</b> <b>had</b> been hiding from her. She recharges Rhys' phone and discovers that it was Cindy he {{was having an affair with}}. A disgusted Jacqui attacks Cindy with a Santa statue, Cindy recovers in hospital and is persuaded by Tony to keep quiet about attack and say she slipped on the ice. Jacqui drags Cindy from Hospital to Rhys' grave and warns her to stay away.|$|E
5|$|She {{learned to}} draw during her {{schooling}} at Papunya and Haasts Bluff, but her first {{experience as a}} painter came working on backgrounds for the pictures created by her father. From the Pintupi/Luritja language group, Daisy Jugadai {{was one of a}} range of artists who came to painting through the Ikuntji Women's Centre in the early 1990s. She is credited with {{a significant role in the}} centre's establishment. She began with screen printing and linocut printmaking, but quickly shifted to acrylic painting, producing many of her best works during the mid-1990s. Western Desert artists such as Daisy Jugadai will frequently paint particular 'dreamings' or Tjukurrpa for which they have personal responsibility or rights. A complex concept, Tjukurrpa refers to the spiritual knowledge of the landscape and custodianship of it; it also refers to laws, rules or stories that people must maintain and re-produce in their communities. Daisy Jugadai portrayed in her art both those for which she had personal responsibility, and those of her late husband and late father. These included honey ant, spinifex and emu dreamings; geographical locations that were the settings for these paintings included Muruntji waterhole and Talabarrdi, and other locations around Kungkayunti, where <b>her</b> <b>family</b> <b>had</b> lived for many years.|$|E
5|$|Wollstonecraft {{was born}} on 27 April 1759 in Spitalfields, London. She was {{the second of the}} seven {{children}} of Elizabeth Dixon and Edward John Wollstonecraft. Although <b>her</b> <b>family</b> <b>had</b> a comfortable income when she was a child, her father gradually squandered it on speculative projects. Consequently, the family became financially unstable and they were frequently forced to move during Wollstonecraft's youth. The family's financial situation eventually became so dire that Wollstonecraft's father compelled her to turn over money that she would have inherited at her maturity. Moreover, he was apparently a violent man who would beat his wife in drunken rages. As a teenager, Wollstonecraft used to lie outside the door of her mother's bedroom to protect her. Wollstonecraft played a similar maternal role for her sisters, Everina and Eliza, throughout her life. For example, in a defining moment in 1784, she convinced Eliza, who was suffering from what was probably postpartum depression, to leave her husband and infant; Wollstonecraft made all of the arrangements for Eliza to flee, demonstrating her willingness to challenge social norms. The human costs, however, were severe: her sister suffered social condemnation and, because she could not remarry, was doomed to a life of poverty and hard work.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} of the duke of Suffolk's murder, Beaumont had been an {{associate}} of the by now recalcitrant Richard, duke of York, having been one of the duke's feoffees in May 1436 and March 1441, and possibly even acting as the duke's councillor on occasion. He had also joined York on the king's council during York's first Protectorate (March 1453 – January 1454). But as York drew further from the court, so Beaumont appears to have moved towards it; although he appears to have not been present at the first battle of St Albans in 1455, he had already stood with the king against York at the latter's stand-off with king at Dartford in 1452, and then sat in judgment on some of his men. He eventually joined the anti-Neville faction at court; although his wife was a Neville, <b>her</b> <b>family</b> <b>had</b> by now aligned themselves with the duke of York. He was amongst the party of lords that reported to parliament that the king was sick and they 'coud not rouse him' in March 1454. He was also an arbitrator between York and the king's party, headed by the duke of Somerset after the king's recovery in 1454; although Griffiths says not a 'strictly impartial' one. Indeed, Griffiths suggests that his appointment to the council on 15 April 1454, after the king's recovery and York's dismissal, was part of a concerted attempt to 're-balance' the council after the protectorate. He was even reported (although wrongly) to have been recruiting an army to march against London in 1454. He {{was one of the few}} Lords Temporal to remain in Henry VI's council in the closing years of the decade, by which time he was the queen's chief steward. He was also part of the royal commission set up by parliament in July 1455 to examine royal household expenditure; the trust the Queen placed in him was demonstrated on 28 January 1457 when he was appointed to the council of the young Prince of Wales, which had responsibility for his estate management, expenditure, personnel, and administration.|$|E
