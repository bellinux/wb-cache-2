In the same year, over 190,000 people were directly employed by the forestry industry, contributing 1.3 percent of total employment and $8.8 billion in wages in 2009. The majority of forestry employees are found in Quebec, British Columbia and Ontario. As of 2011, Canada contributed 10 percent of the world's sawnwood, 10 percent of the pulp for paper, 9 percent of the <b>industrial</b> <b>roundwood,</b> 4 percent of the wood-based panels and 3 percent of the paper and paperboard. In 2010, Canada enjoyed a significant surplus in their balance of trade, mainly due to being the second-largest exporter of forestry products globally. Much of this is exported, with Canada exporting 20 percent of the world's sawnwood, 18 percent of the pulp for paper, 8 percent of the paper and paperboard, 5 percent of the <b>industrial</b> <b>roundwood</b> and 5 percent of the wood-based panels.|$|E

The supply of <b>industrial</b> <b>roundwood</b> is, {{like that of}} fuelwood, directly affected by the shift due to CO 2 fertilization. However, while the demand for fuelwood, an end product, depends ultimately only on GDP and fuelwood price, the demand for <b>industrial</b> <b>roundwood</b> is more involved. Since <b>industrial</b> <b>roundwood</b> is an input {{in the manufacture of}} sawnwood, wood-based panels, and wood pulp, its demand depends on the price of these end products, and on the price of <b>industrial</b> <b>roundwood,</b> the price of other inputs and the techniques of production.|$|E

40|$|In this study, {{the recent}} {{development}} and {{current state of}} Russian forest sector are reviewed in order to evaluate its significance in a global scale. The main {{emphasis is on the}} utilisation and management of Russian forest resources and on the recent development in roundwood and sawnwood exports, which currently comprise over 50 per cent of the total forest product export from Russia. Since the beginning of the 1990 s, Russian forest sector has undergone a deep structural change. The privatisation of forest industry, institutional changes, liberalisation of forest product s prices and intensified participation in international trade have strengthened Russia s role as an important wood procurement region as well as a noteworthy producer of low value-added forest products such as sawnwood. Due to economic and political reforms such as the devaluation of rouble in 1998, fellings and exports of roundwood and sawnwood have begun recovering after the drop in the early 1990 s. In 2002, fellings in Russia totalled 165 million cubic metres whereas roundwood and sawnwood exports reached 37. 7 million and 9 million cubic metres, respectively. In Europe, Russia has become an important actor in sawnwood markets. In German sawnwood market, for example, the market share of Russia is the largest of sawnwood importing countries. Roundwood trade with Finland and Sweden, the largest European importers of Russian roundwood, has increased during the transition period and comprises nowadays approximately one fifth of <b>industrial</b> use of <b>roundwood</b> in both the countries. Currently, Russia is negotiating for participating in World Trade Organisation, the new Forest Code is under construction and Russian Federation tries to attract investments in forest sector. Furthermore, the economic growth in Russia is rapid and it will evidently increase the domestic demand for forest products. Vast forest resources in Russia provide a solid base for increasing forest industry capacity in the area. On the other hand, many obstacles such as lack of infrastructure, heavy bureaucracy and undeveloped financial institutions, some to mention, still exist in Russia. In the future, it is nevertheless likely that Russian forest sector will progress towards a more significant role both in national and international business...|$|R

In order to optimize the production cycle, first should be analyze and account the based resource of the transformation procedure, which is the raw material base that leads the market made in each industry. The availability and supply of raw materials for initial conversion, largely defines the productive capacity of an industrial cycle, along with the monitoring technology defendant, as well the precision manufacturing methods and specialized equipment to determine quality and yield of the final product. In this context the production of pulp for paper {{is a part of}} industrial sector, also with extremely important analytical parameters in all the circuit of manufacturing. The following work is an analysis of consumption capacity and conversion, of raw material based on pulp and paper industry, this is the wood of Eucalyptus globulus, {{as one of the best}} chosen species for paper manufacture. The efficiency of the industrial cycle, necessarily begins with the constant supply and receiving of the primary product processing, timber, this is where is determined the daily production capacity and the turn in profitability of the final product, pulp. The analysis of the profitability of eucalyptus wood at an industrial level, was determined by quantification and inventory of the main percentage losses in the processing of roundwood in pulp, in peeling, chipping and Kraft processes in a factory of Portucel Soporcel in Setubal. For the same purpose, were analyzed each transformation process manufacturing employment, in order to delineate how and where does the losses procedural associated belong, as well as the mechanism of the receiving system and supply of wood in roundwood with bark Eucalyptus globulus, as the initial and primary flow of processing industries. The definition of the main objectives of producibility and profitability of the industrial cycle plants, to meet the needs and demands of the trading market, depend on the ability to supply the raw material for converting the initial factory. In this way, is necessary to maintain an influent receiving wood and precise quantification of the industrial entry. Quantification methods of reception and production of a product, which may be more stringent, in industrial scale are constantly monitored and evaluated in order to detect the limitations and inaccuracies that can be improved or even eliminated if interfere in the accuracy of measurement daily production capacity of manufacturing. So throughout the study in question, were determined the error margins associated in each method of quantification of reception, as well in the determination of losses and production of pulp from Eucalyptus globulus wood, prepared in different ways throughout the process analysis. The margin of error was determined calculating the average error of each measurement made, using records of system measurement and quantification defendant, using the m 3 standard as the volume unit of the process of industrial measurement adopted. Using the theory of propagation of errors in all weights and samples made in the inventory of the main and side timber flows, was associated a error of 2. 76 % for a cubic meter of wood in the quantification by the method of immersion in water, ± 20 kg the margin of error of reading made in weighing the side streams and ± 0. 001 kg in weighing samples. The main procedural losses of wood were identified on the flow of processed bark peeling, mechanic performed by a rotating drum. For greater accuracy, were analyzed the two-line debarking industrial, by selecting identical time bases of four hours on average, and collecting four samples with about 5 kg of bark along the processing, at the end, on average there were about 5 % losses in wood taken from the bark peeling in each line. Carried out on different days receptionist wood, on each line analyzed in duplicate, was noted that in days of heavy rainfall and especially in finer flows of roundwood, losses in mechanical processing chips were the most highlighted, revealing the section shelling the area, the greatest percentage loss of timber industry. With about 1 % on average in each line peel, chips of shattered dimensions too thin for processing pulp, represent the second procedural losses in mechanical processing of roundwood into chips to Kraft cooking. The resulting wood of procedural losses in the plant in question, are use as biomass, converted into green energy that is self consumption and sold by the industrial core analyzed. Once converted into chips for paper pulp production, wood is directed to cooking, screening and bleaching through the process of Kraft delignification. Lignin removed through the black liquor, is recycled for conversion of biomass and green energy, while the liquor is bleach to white liquor, in recovered for reuse in other pulping processes. In the Kraft process is defined a yield of 52 % of wood for Kraft pulp production, the main losses of processed wood are revealed in the content of knots and uncooked shives, riddled sequentially and removed from the production system, due the unfit features for industrial purpose. The knots and uncooked shives were determined by inventory and final weights, on the end of the industrial cycle production of pulp in similar conditions and temporal basis. Being carried out six tests and sampling weights, we can conclude that the knots and uncooked shives represent about 1, 5 % of the wood processed in Kraft pulp. In the end, it was concluded on average, about 6 % wood losses along the <b>industrial</b> processing of <b>roundwood</b> Eucalyptus globulus into chips for paper pulp production and 1, 5 % in pulping, mainly represented by the wood-drag carried by the bark, then the knots and uncooked shives content riddled and finally the chips due the size too thin called “sawdust”...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the global energy production potential of woody biomass from forestry for the year 2050 using a bottom-up analysis of key factors. Woody biomass from forestry was defined as all of the aboveground woody biomass of trees, including all products made from woody biomass. This includes the harvesting, processing and use of woody biomass. The projection was performed by comparing the future demand with the future supply of wood, based on existing databases, scenarios, and outlook studies. Specific attention was paid to the impact of the underlying factors that determine this potential and to the gaps and uncertainties in our current knowledge. Key variables included the demand for <b>industrial</b> <b>roundwood</b> and woodfuel, the plantation establishment rates, and the various theoretical, technical, economical, and ecological limitations related to the supply of wood from forests. Forests, as defined in this study, exclude forest plantations. Key uncertainties were the supply of wood from trees outside forests, the future rates of deforestation, the consumption of woodfuel, and the theoretical, technical, economical, or ecological wood production potentials of the forests. Based on a medium demand and medium plantation scenario, the global theoretical potential of the surplus wood supply (i. e., after the demand for woodfuel and <b>industrial</b> <b>roundwood</b> is met) in 2050 was calculated to be 6. 1 Gm 3 (71 EJ) and the technical potential to be 5. 5 Gm 3 (64 EJ). In practice, economical considerations further reduced the surplus wood supply from forests to 1. 3 Gm 3 year− 1 (15 EJ year− 1). When ecological criteria were also included, the demand for woodfuel and <b>industrial</b> <b>roundwood</b> exceeded the supply by 0. 7 Gm 3 year− 1 (8 EJ year− 1). The bioenergy potential from logging and processing residues and waste was estimated to be equivalent to 2. 4 Gm 3 year− 1 (28 EJ year− 1) wood, based on a medium demand scenario. These results indicate that forests can, in theory, become a major source of bioenergy, and that the use of this bioenergy can, in theory, be realized without endangering the supply of <b>industrial</b> <b>roundwood</b> and woodfuel and without further deforestation. Regional shortages in the supply of <b>industrial</b> <b>roundwood</b> and woodfuel can, however, occur in some regions, e. g., South Asia and the Middle East and North Africa.

The analysis compared predictions from 2007 to 2020, with and without a gradual reduction of illegally logged <b>industrial</b> <b>roundwood</b> from 2007 to 2011. A large part of the curtailment of timber supply due to the stoppage of illegal logging would be compensated by increased legal production incited by higher prices. As a result, without illegal logging the world annual production of <b>industrial</b> <b>roundwood</b> would decrease by no more than 1 %, even though it would decrease by up to 8 % in developing countries. World prices would rise by 1. 5 to 3. 5 % for <b>industrial</b> <b>roundwood</b> and by 0. 5 to 2 % for processed products, depending on the assumption on illegal logging rates. World consumer expenditures for wood products and producer revenues would rise by 1 to 2 % without illegal logging. World value added in forest industries would remain the same. However, the changes in consumer expenditures would be more than double the changes in producer revenues in countries dependent on illegally logged timber of domestic or foreign origin such as Indonesia and China. Symmetrically, changes in producer revenues would be almost twice the changes in consumer expenditures in countries with little illegal logging and efficient industries, such as Canada, Germany and the United States. Value added in forest industries would decrease most in countries with heavy illegal logging (12 % in Indonesia and up to 9 % in Brazil), and it would increase most in Germany, Canada (4 %), and the United States (2 %).

40|$|This {{study is}} a primary econometric {{analysis}} to explore the factors explaining the changes in <b>industrial</b> <b>roundwood</b> demand in Turkey. The study also includes demand forecasts based on the econometric models proposed herein. We constructed two separate econometric models: one for national demand for domestically-produced saw log, {{and the other for}} national demand for domestically-produced non-sawlog <b>industrial</b> <b>roundwood.</b> Models were originally designed in multiplicative form. The original models are then converted into the log-linear form so that the relevant coefficients of the regression equations would immediately reflect the elasticities. Estimation of the model parameters are based on a panel data set of fifteen years (1995 - 2009) by twenty seven regional forest directorates in the country. In accordance with the maxim of less than the half of the 15 years period of data set, the demand forecasts are made for seven years beyond 2009. In view of the results, the explanatory power of the proposed models can arguably be deemed satisfactory especially considering the lack of earlier studies of this scale and scope. This consequently increases the credibility of the demand projections. Notwithstanding signs of the estimated parameters of the models are for the most part congruent with those expected in light of the economic theory and practice, some intriguing results are obtained. Perhaps most notably, while the sign of the estimated price elasticity of sawlog demand occurred unexpectedly positive, the variation in sawlog demand is explained to a considerable extent by the variation in the price of imported sawlog, hence an expected cross elasticity. Also notable is that the price of imported "fuelwood" holds a positive relationship with the national demand for domestic non-sawlog imdustrial roundwood, which is an expected cross elasticity since virtually all of the imported "fuelwood" is used as raw material for industry (e. g. chip and fiberboard industry). Finally, both models suggest overall boost in demand: yet an upper bound of 4. 5 million m(3) for national demand for domestically-produced sawlog, and of 15 million m(3) for national demand for domestically-produced non-sawlog <b>industrial</b> <b>roundwood</b> can be expected by 2016...|$|E

Focusing on the effects of logging, this study introduces an index of wood production, the forest harvest index (FHI), which calculates the expected gross forest cover loss (GFCL) reflecting the demand for timber and wood products at the global scale. We examined the accuracy and precision of the index by investigating the relationship between the FHI and actual GFCL measured through remote sensing. The index incorporates wood- and climate-specific biomass expansion factors and country-specific growing stock densities to convert wood production volume to expected GFCL. We quantitatively examined the effect of data uncertainty in the growing stock density values obtain from FRA 2010 on the predicted relationship between the FHI and actual GFCL. We quantified the FHI for both <b>industrial</b> <b>roundwood</b> and wood fuel during a 5 -year period (FY 2000 –FY 2004) in each of the 139 nations considered.

Furthermore, to demonstrate the utility of our index as a metric of virtual GFCL of wood products, we disaggregated the FHI into export, import and domestic based on global wood trade data and compared the strength of the relationship with actual GFCL.

According {{to the most recent}} global forest resources assessment, planted forests occupy approximately 258 million ha, or 6 percent of the total world forest area (FAO, 2010). Their usefulness includes wood production and protection against erosion, avalanches, and desertification, with often a mix of purposes.

Furthermore, planted forests are, and will, remain an essential source of fuelwood and <b>industrial</b> <b>roundwood.</b> Recent studies suggest that they have the potential for production of up to two thirds of the global roundwood supply (Carle and Holmgren, 2008, Del Lungo et al., 2006).|$|E
30|$|The {{present study}} was {{concerned}} mainly with planted forests as sources of fuelwood and <b>industrial</b> <b>roundwood.</b> The objective was to develop and apply a method to assess quantitatively the contribution of planted forests to the world forest economy.

This is followed by the application of the Global Forest Products Model (GFPM) to forest economy data for 2009, with and without utilisation of planted forests. The GFPM predictions are then discussed in terms of the effect of planted forests on the world prices of specific wood products, and on the quantities consumed, produced, and traded by the main regions of the world. The impacts of planted forests on consumer and producer surplus and on harvesting from natural forests are also considered.|$|E
30|$|In {{the static}} phase, the spatial global {{economic}} equilibrium {{in a given}} year is obtained by solving a quadratic programming problem in which the objective function is the social surplus in the global forest sector {{in a given year}}, which competitive markets maximize (Samuelson 1952, Takayama and Judge 1971). This surplus is equal to the value of the products to consumers (area under all the demand curves), minus the cost of supplying the raw materials (area under their supply curves), minus the transformation cost from raw materials, such as <b>industrial</b> <b>roundwood</b> to sawnwood, and minus the transport cost between countries including trade taxes. The main constraints define the material balance for each country and product: The quantity imported plus the domestic supply and the manufactured quantity must equal the domestic demand plus the quantity used in manufacturing other products and exports. Upon solution of this quadratic problem the shadow prices of the material balance constraints give the market-clearing prices for each commodity and country.|$|E
30|$|For all {{scenarios}} {{and regions}} the growing stock was higher in 2065 with CO 2 fertilization than without it. Thus, the added growth due to CO 2 fertilization more than {{compensated for the}} cumulative effects of the increased fuelwood and <b>industrial</b> <b>roundwood</b> harvests observed above. The largest effects of the CO 2 fertilization {{on the level of}} forest stock in 2065 were under scenario A 1 B. This was in part due to the high level of atmospheric [CO 2] and also to the rise in forest area, and thus young growing forests, induced by the higher GDP per capita growth assumed in scenario A 1 B. For this scenario, the forest stock was 20  % higher in 2065 with CO 2 fertilization than without it. The largest relative impacts were in Africa and Asia. Under scenarios A 2 and B 2 the effect of CO 2 fertilization were similar, globally (9  % to 10  %) and by region, with the largest relative impact still in Africa.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{analyses}} the <b>industrial</b> <b>roundwood</b> production {{trends in}} the Italian Alps in the last 50 years, pointing out the decreasing economic performance of local timber producers {{and the loss of}} competitiveness with respect to foreign markets. In spite of decision-makers and public opinion’s general believes, timber production in the Italian mountainous areas is not a valuable alternative to the declining role of agriculture. In this context, an increasing economic role in maintaining an active management of forest resources is being played by Non Wood Forest Products and Services (NWFP&S) as niche products. Two development paths both referring to the NWFP&S markets development are presented and factors playing a key role in successful NWFP&S marketing are briefly discussed. Evidences are provided to show that income deriving from NWFPs and fuelwood selling is not only provided annually and in relative constant amount, but also that the level of profitability in this business sector is much higher than in timber production and marketing...|$|E
40|$|Sustainable {{development}} {{has become the}} umbrella objective for forest management in many countries of the world, and managers are increasingly faced with the challenges of balancing environmental and economic health in their forest management and resource utilization decisions. It {{can no longer be}} assumed that abundant raw materials are available simply for the taking. Changing times require that we change how the forest resource is managed and used. As we look to the fu ture, we must develop a bet ter understanding of the complex interactions of wood use and the resul tant social and ecological considerations. This paper addresses the value of wood in human societies, provides a brief review of the world’s forest cover, discusses worldwide links and expectations, makes the case for forest products technology, discusses global trends in forest products, discusses future supply and demand for <b>industrial</b> <b>roundwood</b> and wood products, and examines ways to meet future challenges...|$|E
40|$|This study aims {{to provide}} {{information}} to all stakeholders and present {{an analysis of the}} trends in the biomass utilization for bioenergy generation to the forestry sector. The analysis focuses on forest resources, production and consumption of wood products, actual situation and trends in the bioenergy sector and forest services. One of the major challenges faced by the Turkish forestry sector is to meet the increasing demand for wood raw material in the wood products industry taking into consideration the trends in the bioenergy sector to promote the renewable energy sources. Therefore, another objective of the study is to determine the available biomass and to reveal its estimated theoretical potential as energy wood. Two projections were performed by using a scenario-based analysis (pessimistic and optimistic projections for bioenergy) of woody biomass supply based on the existing databases, outlook studies, financial balance sheets and progress in renewable energy generation. Special attention was paid to the impact of the forest industry factors that determine the woody biomass potential and to the gaps and uncertainties in the current situation. Consequently, {{it was found that the}} bioenergy production based on woody biomass has not been developed yet, although there was 1, 494. 5 million m of growing stock in nearly 21. 7 million ha of forestland, in Turkey. However, the total amount of <b>industrial</b> <b>roundwood</b> production increased by approximately 2. 12 fold while the fiber chip board production increased by 29 times in the Turkish forestry sector in the last three decades. Surprisingly, the traditional fuelwood production decreased by 69 %. The findings reveal that fiber chip board industry is a competitor to the bioenergy sector and it seems to become an obstacle to the modern utilization of woody biomass for energy in near future. As the wood products favored by the forest industry sector, it can be assumed that logging residues will become a primary source of bioenergy without compromising the supply of the <b>industrial</b> <b>roundwood</b> and fuelwood. The estimated theoretical biomass potential that was only obtained from the logging residues and did not include secondary and tertiary wood residues and waste was estimated to be equivalent to 3. 5 – 5. 5 million tons according to the short-scale scenarios...|$|E
40|$|Turkey is an Annex-I country {{under the}} United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and {{therefore}} submits its Greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions and removals from anthropogenic sources to the UNFCCC secretariat {{on an annual}} basis, through a National GHG Inventory Report (NIR). GHG emissions and removals from Land Use, Land Use and Forestry (LULUCF) constitute {{one of the main}} sectors in this report. One of the major land use categories in this sector is Forestland, and harvests in this category must be considered as a direct GHG emission to the atmosphere, unless the fate of the Harvested Wood Products (HWP) is reported. In this study, we estimated the carbon sequestration in the HWP category of the Turkish NIR, according to the 2006 Guidelines for GHG inventory in the Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use (AFOLU) sector, from the International Panel of Experts on Climate Change (IPCC). This is the first time such an estimate of carbon stocks and carbon stock changes in the HWP pool has been carried out in Turkey. The calculation has been done in Tier 2. We used United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) Timber database disaggregated figures for HWP produced in Turkey from 1964 to 2013. We focused on the two main HWP categories, which are sawnwood and wood-based panels. Comparing UNECE data series with Orman Genel Müdürlügü (OGM, the Republic of Turkey, General Directorate of Forestry) data series for <b>industrial</b> <b>roundwood</b> over 1976 - 2013 (starting date for OGM data series), we noticed some anomalies (with UNECE data series as a basis: max: + 47 %, min = - 23 %, mean = + 16 %). Thus, the UNECE data on sawnwood and wood based panels were corrected based on OGM data. These anomalies could be due to: (i) use of volume over bark for UNECE and volume under bark for OGM (+ 15 % for volume over bark), and (ii) integration of <b>industrial</b> <b>roundwood</b> coming from the private sector for UNECE. In order to ensure coherence, we then corrected the 1976 - 2013 UNECE data series for sawnwood and wood-based panels production taking into account for each year the percentage of anomaly. However, from 1976 to 1982, the anomalies are much reduced (- 1 % in average), which allow using the UNECE data series from 1964 to 1975. We estimated the average share of each HWP over the last ten years: 48 % for sawnwood and 38 % for wood-based panels. The 14 % of other HWP are not considered in the analysis, either because they are short-lived products or marginal or difficult to estimate. A projection of HWP has been done until 2020 based on 2 alternative scenarios based on OGM strategy documents: intensive harvesting and extensive harvesting. For each scenario, intensive vs extensive, we disaggregated the 2013 - 2020 volume of <b>industrial</b> <b>roundwood</b> into the two HWPs, using the calculated percentages. The results of our analysis revealed that the HWP pool can add 3. 14 Gg CO 2 eq yr- 1 additional removal to LULUCF sector in the GHG inventory of Turkey for 2013 compared to 1990. The amount of contribution is estimated to rise up to 13. 70 Mt CO 2 eq yr- 1, and 10. 99 Mt CO 2 eq yr- 1 for intensive and extensive scenarios that are developed based on OGM strategic plans in 2020...|$|E
30|$|The {{theory of}} {{competitive}} global markets for wood and wood products {{suggests that the}} primary effect of utilising planted forests is production of more wood at any given price. Working on this assumption, application of the Global Forest Products Model to 2009 data indicated that the utilisation of planted forests reduces the world price of all wood products in rough proportion {{to the amount of}} product cost related to the wood content. As a result, world consumption (and production) of wood products is increased by the utilisation of planted forests. This global increase ranges between 14 % for <b>industrial</b> <b>roundwood</b> and 1 % for paper and paperboard. Consumption of end products (fuelwood, sawnwood, panels, paper and paperboard) was commensurately higher in all seven regions investigated. However, production of these commodities, {{as well as that of}} roundwood and pulp, could be negatively affected as it depends on the proportion of wood obtained from planted forests, the techniques involved in transforming wood into products, and the price of raw materials and end products.|$|E
