5|$|Planning of the ZX Spectrum+ {{started in}} June 1984, {{and it was}} {{released}} in October the same year. This 48KB Spectrum (development code-name TB) introduced a new QL-style case with an <b>injection-moulded</b> keyboard and a reset button that was basically a switch that shorted across the CPU reset capacitor. Electronically, it was identical to the previous 48KB model. It was possible {{to change the system}} boards between the original case and the Spectrum+ case. It retailed for £179.95. A DIY conversion-kit for older machines was available. Early on, the machine outsold the rubber-key model 2:1; however, some retailers reported a failure rate of up to 30%, compared with a more usual 5–6% for the older model.|$|E

40|$|The {{objectives}} of the project are {{the development of a}} cost-effective silicon nitride material and an economic production process for complexly shaped parts by the application of the <b>injection-moulding</b> process of ceramic powders. A material sinterable under normal-pressure on the basis of reaction-bonded silicon nitride (SRBSN) has been developed, using silicon - silicon nitride mixtures. For these mixtures a cost-effective and rapid nitridation process could be realized, leading to a combination in a one-step process. By application of the <b>injection-moulding</b> shaping process, this material could be processed to bucket tappet and crankshaft components. Already during the running time of the project, the developed material has become established as a production material. Moreover, the <b>injection-moulding</b> shaping rocess has been applied for the production of further technically applied silicon nitride components, requiring high precision and complex geometries. By application of <b>injection-moulding</b> as a 'near-netshape' process, ceramic components could be produced which meet the requirements concerning dimensional tolerances and final contour accuracy. An expensive finishing step is no longer required. (orig.)

25|$|A {{small number}} of toys and models were {{produced}}. During 1978, Corgi Toys produced a two inch long die-cast model of Liberator with a transparent rear globe. This was re-released the following year in silver with a model space shuttle, and in blue on its own. Also during 1979, Blue Box Toys produced three space vehicle toys that featured the series logo; however, these had never appeared in the television programme. Comet Miniatures produced a nine-inch long <b>injection-moulded</b> model kit of Liberator in 1989, which contained many parts. They also produced a white metallic two-inch Liberator model, and a three-inch Federation trooper figure. A Scorpio clip gun, and Liberator and Scorpio teleport bracelets, were also produced.|$|E

According to a Sinclair executive quoted in the Financial Times, [...] "one must always bear a packet of cigarettes in mind as the ideal size," [...] possibly a quip on Clive Sinclair's smoking habit. The Executive weighed [...] and measured [...] The case, designed by Richard Torrens, was made of black <b>injection-moulded</b> polycarbonate, required flexible glue to hold the two halves together.|$|E
500|$|Two-shot or {{multi-shot}} moulds {{are designed}} to [...] "overmould" [...] within a single moulding cycle and must be processed on specialised injection moulding machines with two or more injection units. This process is actually an injection moulding process performed twice and therefore has a much smaller margin of error. In the first step, the base colour material is moulded into a basic shape, which contains spaces for the second shot. Then the second material, a different colour, is <b>injection-moulded</b> into those spaces. Pushbuttons and keys, for instance, made by this process have markings that cannot wear off, and remain legible with heavy use.|$|E
50|$|The {{development}} of ideas continued {{and more than}} one hundred alternatives were considered. The blow-moulded widget was to be pierced with a laser and a blower was then necessary to blow away the plume created by the laser burning through the polypropylene. This was abandoned and instead it was decided to gas-exchange air for nitrogen on the filler, and produce the inserts with a hole in place using straightforward and cheaper <b>injection-moulding</b> techniques.|$|R

500|$|Kitmaster {{produced}} an unpowered polystyrene <b>injection-moulded</b> kit for 00 gauge from 1960. In late 1962, the brand {{was sold to}} Airfix, which resumed production in 1968. The moulds later passed to Dapol, which continues to produce the kit. Hornby manufactures ready-to-run rebuilt and un-rebuilt examples of the class and caters for all the major detail variations. Graham Farish produces ready-to-run models in N gauge, and Dapol has announced its intention to produce models in N gauge, slated for release in May 2012.

The vehicle would be engineered for simplicity using <b>injection-moulded</b> plastic components and a polypropylene body. It would also be much cheaper than a car, costing £500 (now £) at the most.|$|E
500|$|The {{bodywork}} {{was made}} from two <b>injection-moulded</b> polypropylene shells supplied by three manufacturers; J.J. Harvey of Manchester made the moulds, Linpac provided the shells, and ICI supplied the raw material. According to Rodney Dale, the upper shell mould was [...] "one of the largest – if not the largest – injection mouldings of its type in the UK: possibly even in the world". The manufacturing process reflected Sinclair's ambition for the C5 production line. A single mould set was capable of producing up to 4,000 parts every week. The {{two parts of the}} shell were joined together by wrapping a tape around the joint, aligning them on a jig, pressing them together and passing an electric current through the tape to heat and melt it. The same process was used to make the front and rear bumper assemblies of the Austin Maestro and only took about 70 seconds to complete. Although Sinclair had considered producing the C5 at the DeLorean plant at Dunmurry in Northern Ireland, which had one of Europe's most advanced automated plastic-body manufacturing facilities, this was not to be, as the DeLorean Motor Company failed in a controversial bankruptcy that resulted in the plant's closure.|$|E

Wolverine's claws required no cast of Hugh Jackman's hands, and were built so he could easily put them on and take them off for safety reasons. Production had insisted that they be attached at all times under a full prosthetic sleeve but designer Gordon Smith refused to do it. Production also insisted on real metal blades, which Smith also refused to do, making <b>injection-moulded</b> plaster blades instead. Hundreds of pairs were built for Jackman and his stunt doubles. Rebecca's wore 110 individual silicone prosthetic, Only the edges were glued, the rest were self-sticking. The prosthetics were built flat and wrapped her body.

40|$|In (designed) {{industrial}} experiments, {{the response}} observed often {{takes the form}} of a curve representing, for example, the evolution of a quality characteristic over a period of time. In such a context, the polynomial regression approach, usually used in response surface analysis to predict the response as a function of the experimental factors, should be adapted to the functional character of the response. This paper reviews several possible methods of analysing the results of a designed experiment when the response is a curve and compares them with a case study from the metal <b>injection-moulding</b> industry. Three different approaches are first presented to fit a model to the (functional) data: two-step nonlinear modelling; pointwise functional regression; and smoothed functional regression. All of the models derived are able to predict the functional response from any design factor setting chosen in the experimental domain. Two inferential problems are then discussed: the significance testing of experimental factor effects and the calculation of prediction intervals around predicted curves. Asymptotic results and bootstrap procedures are compared in this context. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R
