5|$|After {{a single}} and a stolen base from Andrus, Ríos {{doubled in the}} bottom half of the sixth to cut the score to 4–2. A small {{controversy}} arose in the top of the seventh inning. Longoria and Myers were on first and second base respectively with two outs when Young hit a line drive to center field. Replays showed that the ball bounced into Leonys Martín's (the Rangers' center fielder) glove after hitting the ground, making it a trap and therefore should have been a hit. However, the umpires ruled the play an out, ending the inning without a run scoring. Ultimately, the issue did not affect the outcome. The Rays added onto their lead <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ninth</b> inning when Sam Fuld stole third and a scored on a throwing error from Rangers reliever Tanner Scheppers, extending their lead to 5–2. Price closed the game <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ninth,</b> recording three straight outs and finishing off a complete game.|$|E
