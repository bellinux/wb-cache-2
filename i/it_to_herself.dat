5|$|Before Hope and Liam's {{official}} legal {{wedding in}} the United States, Steffy spends {{a night on}} the town with Liam. Hope finds out and leaves Liam. Steffy and Liam are reunited, and she soon finds she is pregnant in early 2013. However, she keeps <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>herself</b> when she sees Hope and Liam kissing. Liam finds out about the pregnancy and recommits himself to Steffy, but shortly after their wedding she who loses the baby in a motorbike accident. Steffy then learns that her accident has left her infertile. Devastated, Steffy decides to divorce Liam and relocate to Paris. She returns to Los Angeles several months later for a brief visit, informing Liam that her infertility issues have been corrected, hoping that it could mean a second chance for them. Despite this, Liam insists that he is obligated to Hope, and Steffy leaves town again. After another short visit to Los Angeles in February 2015, Steffy returns months later to help Ridge take over Forrester Creations by overthrowing Rick. She becomes president of the company and rekindles her romance with Liam, ending his relationship with her cousin, Ivy Forrester (Ashleigh Brewer). Steffy's cousin, Aly (Ashlyn Pearce), resents Steffy, attributed to the fact that Taylor had accidentally killed her mother, Darla (Schae Harrison), years ago in car accident. An unstable Aly attempts to kill Steffy on PCH, resulting in Steffy killing Aly with a tire iron in self-defense. However, Ivy recorded a video of the accident on her phone, not seeing the rock Steffy killed Aly with. Ivy gets involved with Wyatt Spencer (Darin Brooks) and Ivy blackmails Steffy with the video, calling the accident a murder. Ivy decides to delete the video after Steffy tries to convince Wyatt to delete it. Thomas tells Steffy that he made out with Ivy while Wyatt was on a business trip. Steffy confronts Ivy and convinces her to tell Wyatt but tells Wyatt before Ivy has a chance. Wyatt breaks up with her and Ivy is angry at Steffy and confronts her in front of a broken electrical panel, resulting in an altercation in which Ivy gets electrocuted. Ivy survives and files a restraining order against Steffy while Wyatt resumes his relationship with Ivy. Ivy realized she never got over Liam and convinces Liam to give them another chance if she drops the restraining order. Quinn overhears Ivy telling Liam she loves him and exposes this in front of Steffy and Liam while Wyatt is proposing to Ivy. Wyatt breaks up with Ivy and she packs her bags for Australia. On top of the staircase, Steffy confronts Ivy and she tumbles down. Liam is angry at Steffy and breaks up with her. Liam hits his head on the plane with Ivy, while Wyatt comforts Steffy. Liam disappears (he was really kidnapped by Quinn after having passed out due to concussion symptoms he acquired by hitting his head while on a plane and passing out in the parking lot of Forrester Creations and losing his memory as a result) and Wyatt tells her that Liam must have once again let her down. He shows her how to have fun by surfing on the beach and even buys her a motorcycle, which she hasn't driven since her miscarriage. The two fall in love and eventually get married on the beach. Steffy's marriage to Wyatt eventually breaks down due to their differing opinions about Quinn and they separate while Steffy contemplates divorcing Wyatt. She eventually rekindles her love and relationship with Liam, Liam proposes to Steffy and she accepts, and after Steffy's divorce from Wyatt was finalized, Steffy & Liam got married in Sydney; Australia.|$|E
500|$|When Darryl {{runs into}} Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer), {{he tells her}} about the company's success and how Jim is missing out by staying in Scranton. Pam begins to worry that she is making Jim do {{something}} {{that he does not}} want to do. She confronts her husband and admits that she thinks she might not be good enough for him. He asks the in-series documentary crew's help; the crew makes a DVD of the highlights that they have collected of Jim and Pam's relationship. The final scene that they use is from the second season Christmas episode [...] "Christmas Party" [...] in which Jim gives Pam a teapot as a gift, but takes back his accompanying note to her. After Pam watches the DVD, Jim presents her with the actual, unopened note. She reads <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>herself,</b> and, realizing that Jim does truly love her, the two happily embrace.|$|E
500|$|Betty, however {{difficult}} to believe as her character is established, shows an astonishing depth of dimension in her audition. Previously rehearsed with Rita in the apartment, where Rita feeds her lines woodenly, the scene is [...] "dreck" [...] and [...] "hollow; every line unworthy of a genuine actress's commitment", and Betty plays it in rehearsal as poorly as it is written. Nervous but plucky as ever at the audition, Betty enters the cramped room, but when pitted inches from her audition partner (Chad Everett), she turns it into a scene of powerful sexual tension that she fully controls and draws in {{every person in the}} room. The sexuality erodes immediately as the scene ends and she stands before them shyly waiting for their approval. One film analyst asserts that Betty's previously unknown ability steals the show, specifically, taking the dark mystery away from Rita and assigning <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>herself,</b> and by Lynch's use of this scene illustrates his use of deception in his characters. Betty's acting ability prompts Ruth Perlmutter to speculate if Betty is acting the role of Diane in either a dream or a parody of a film that ultimately turns against her.|$|E

6000|$|... "The {{service was}} to sing your praises, was it not?" [...] And she {{accompanied}} this question {{with a little}} smile, as if <b>to</b> make <b>it</b> easier <b>to</b> <b>herself.</b>|$|R
60|$|But {{she could}} not divine <b>it.</b> She {{admitted}} <b>to</b> <b>herself</b> {{that she had not}} the faintest idea.|$|R
500|$|When Mitzeee {{realised}} Mercedes was her stalker, Mercedes knocked Mitzeee {{out after}} Mitzeee tries to stab her. Mercedes realised {{that she will}} be blamed for stalking Mitzeee so she stabbed herself to convince people Mitzeee was mad. Metcalfe said the situation was born through [...] "pure desperation". She said that [...] "the thought of Mitzeee, Riley and Bobby as a family together was too much for her to take, and she just saw red. I don't think it's something that Mercedes thought about or planned - she wouldn't have even dreamed of doing <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>herself.</b> But at the time, she saw it as the only way out of the situation". Shenton explained that Mitzeee was worried due to the stalker so she decided to take some antidepressants and drink wine, which as she states [...] "isn't a great combination." [...] Shenton revealed that Mercedes arrived to see Mitzee who [...] "still has no idea who the stalker really is, but as they're talking, Mercedes says something that makes Mitzeee discover the truth - and she's totally shocked. Mitzeee is petrified and picks up a knife in the kitchen. The next thing you know, Mitzeee wakes up after being unconscious [...] The first thing she sees is Mercedes with a stab wound and there is blood everywhere. Mitzeee doesn't have a clue whether she could have stabbed Mercedes, or if someone else came into the flat and did it".|$|E
500|$|A love {{triangle}} between Natasha, Andrew and Summer is formed. Natasha's {{feelings for}} Andrew grow when they organise a party together, but she notices Andrew's concern for Summer when she collapses and warns Summer away from Andrew. Natasha later asks Andrew if he loves her, {{but he does}} not reply. In December 2010, Summer and Andrew give into their feelings for each other and have sex. Novakovic said Natasha would be [...] "devastated" [...] if she knew what had happened and that she would not let Andrew and Summer off lightly. Andrew tells Natasha {{that he is going to}} business meeting, but he meets Summer instead. While they are together in Summer's house, a fire breaks out. Natasha sees the smoke and calls her father and the emergency services before entering the house to rescue Summer, unaware Andrew is also there. Novakovic explained Natasha's ordeal: [...] "Natasha is pulled from the fire by her dad, Michael. Andrew and Summer are rescued separately, and Natasha has no idea of the reason why Andrew was in the house - he was cheating on her with Summer!" [...] After the rescue, Natasha has to come to terms with the fact she will be scarred from a burn she sustains on her neck. Novakovic said that it is a [...] "big deal" [...] for Natasha, as she aspires to be a model and this could ruin her chances. Novakovic also opines that Summer wants nothing more than to be with Andrew, but how can she take him when Natasha tried to save her? Novakovic believed Natasha was blas√© to their feelings adding [...] "Deep down, I think Natasha knows that there's something going on, but she doesn't want to admit <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>herself.</b> But sooner or later, I reckon she'll have to face the inevitable." ...|$|E

She helped to {{organize}} and promote the Women's Foreign Mission Society of the Methodist Church in her last years.

Each of us owes <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>herself,</b> in this favored age, {{to rise to the}} noblest possibilities of our nation." ...|$|E

60|$|If Giles Headley murmured at Aldonza's removal, it {{was only}} to Perronel, and that {{discreet}} woman kept <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>herself.</b>|$|E

6000|$|Even Harriet {{could not}} be cross to him, though she made Aurelia carry the eggs, and indulged in sundry petulant whisks of the fan which she carried by way of parasol.

[...] "Is <b>it</b> <b>to</b> secure <b>to</b> <b>herself</b> the whole {{enjoyment}} of your beau?" ...|$|R
6000|$|It was a {{promising}} quarrel, but their lips were too dry <b>to</b> keep <b>it</b> up {{for more than}} a snarl or two. Walter cast himself down, and bade old Tata fan him; why should Mabel have <b>it</b> all <b>to</b> <b>herself?</b> ...|$|R
50|$|Nevertheless, Holmes {{receives}} {{a bottle of}} prussic acid from Mrs. Ronder two days later. She was going <b>to</b> use <b>it</b> <b>to</b> kill <b>herself,</b> but upon considering what Holmes told her, she apparently thought better of it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not a word--that's the horror. She kept <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>herself!</b> The {{child of}} eight, THAT child!" [...] Unutterable still, for me, was the stupefaction of it.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Meyrick's quick eye and ear {{detected}} something unusual, but immediately explained <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>herself.</b> Fine ladies {{had often}} wounded Mirah by caprices of manner and intention.|$|E
60|$|Nobody {{could have}} conjectured from Mara's calm, gentle cheerfulness of demeanor, that any sorrow {{lay at the}} bottom of her heart; she would not have owned <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>herself.</b>|$|E
60|$|This was {{all very}} startling; but he {{referred}} <b>it</b> <b>to</b> Mrs. Ollnee <b>herself.</b> <b>To</b> imagine <b>it</b> a direct message from the dead was beyond him.|$|R
60|$|Still {{standing}} there, Alma {{told the}} whole story, giving full explanations, but no excuses. She told it clearly and simply, {{for she had}} often pictured this scene <b>to</b> <b>herself</b> and thought out what she must say. Her memory worked automatically, and her tongue obeyed <b>it</b> promptly. <b>To</b> <b>herself</b> she seemed like a machine, talking mechanically, while her soul stood {{on one side and}} listened.|$|R
60|$|The {{letter was}} colder than he meant <b>to</b> make <b>it,</b> {{but he felt}} that he must above all be honest, and he did not see how he could {{honestly}} make it less cold.

6000|$|... 'What needs she another {{till she}} gets a gudeman?' {{answered}} my Thetis, a little miffed perhaps--to use the women's phrase--that I turned the conversation upon my former partner, rather than addressed <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>herself.</b>|$|E
60|$|It {{seemed to}} Catherine {{that no one}} who had once seen him would ever forget him; but though she made this {{reflexion}} she kept <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>herself,</b> almost as you would keep something precious.|$|E
60|$|At {{the mention}} of Tony the shadow deepened {{for a moment in}} the girl‚Äôs face, for <b>it</b> seemed <b>to</b> her there was a meaning behind what the old man had said which chimed with the misgivings that had troubled her of late. Still, she was loyal, and would not admit <b>it</b> even <b>to</b> <b>herself.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... 'She is gone to her aunt's, {{to spend}} the evening,' said Mr. Swancourt, {{thrusting}} {{his head out of}} his study door, and letting the light of his candles stream upon Elfride's face--less revealing than, as <b>it</b> seemed <b>to</b> <b>herself,</b> creating the blush of uneasy perplexity that was burning upon her cheek.|$|R

60|$|DOLLY (repeating <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>herself</b> like a lesson). Crampton, Crampton, Crampton, Crampton, Crampton. (She {{sits down}} studiously at the writing- table.) I must get that name right, or Heaven knows what I shall call him.|$|E
6000|$|Isabel {{received}} this letter {{while she was}} at breakfast with Lord Ormersfield and Louis, and it was, of course, impossible to keep <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>herself.</b> 'Talking of no wages!' said the Earl. 'Send her off at once.' ...|$|E
