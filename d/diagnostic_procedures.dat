5|$|Some <b>diagnostic</b> <b>procedures,</b> such as lumbar {{puncture}} (see post-dural-puncture headache), venipuncture, paracentesis, and thoracentesis can be painful.|$|E
5|$|A {{diagnosis}} of psoriasis is usually {{based on the}} appearance of the skin. Skin characteristics typical for psoriasis are scaly, erythematous plaques, papules, or patches of skin that may be painful and itch. No special blood tests or <b>diagnostic</b> <b>procedures</b> are needed to make the diagnosis.|$|E
50|$|There are {{a number}} of methods or {{techniques}} {{that can be used in}} a <b>diagnostic</b> <b>procedure,</b> including performing a differential diagnosis or following medical algorithms. In reality, a <b>diagnostic</b> <b>procedure</b> may involve components of multiple methods.|$|R

5|$|Pain {{in cancer}} {{may arise from}} a tumor {{compressing}} or infiltrating nearby body parts; from treatments and diagnostic procedures; or from skin, nerve and other changes caused by a hormone imbalance or immune response. Most chronic (long-lasting) pain {{is caused by the}} illness and most acute (short-term) pain is caused by treatment or <b>diagnostic</b> <b>procedures.</b> However, radiotherapy, surgery and chemotherapy may produce painful conditions that persist long after treatment has ended.|$|E
25|$|Some <b>diagnostic</b> <b>procedures,</b> such as venipuncture, paracentesis, and thoracentesis can be painful.|$|E

30|$|Medical imaging {{procedures}} are {{tailored to the}} clinical problem of the patient and to patient characteristics. The main aims are to perform the right <b>diagnostic</b> <b>procedure</b> for an individual problem, to optimise {{the quality of the}} diagnostic examination and to reduce the side effects of the <b>diagnostic</b> <b>procedure.</b> All these aims fit in the concept of PM.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} a {{vibration}} analysis based <b>diagnostic</b> <b>procedure</b> {{for the detection}} and monitoring of incipient faults as cracks or bar breaks on squirrel cage motors is presented. A mathematical model from the Authors {{set up for the}} determination of axial vibrations due to these faults is utilized as reference incipient fault model in order to determine prefault indexes for the above mentioned procedure. The experimental investigations, performed on a test bench set up for this purpose, confirmed the effectiveness both of the mathematical model and of the <b>diagnostic</b> <b>procedure.</b> Finally, the architecture of the diagnostic system that implements the proposed <b>diagnostic</b> <b>procedure</b> and its functioning mode are described...|$|R
50|$|The {{fact that}} a patient has sought a diagnostician can itself be an {{indication}} to perform a <b>diagnostic</b> <b>procedure.</b> For example, in a doctor's visit, the physician may already start performing a <b>diagnostic</b> <b>procedure</b> by watching the gait of the patient from the waiting room to the doctor's office even before she or he has started to present any complaints.|$|R
25|$|Technetium-99m is a {{metastable}} {{nuclear isomer}} of technetium-99 (itself an isotope of technetium), symbolized as 99mTc, {{that is used}} in {{tens of millions of}} medical <b>diagnostic</b> <b>procedures</b> annually, making it the most commonly used medical radioisotope.|$|E

50|$|Even {{during an}} already ongoing <b>diagnostic</b> <b>procedure,</b> {{there can be}} an {{indication}} to perform another, separate, <b>diagnostic</b> <b>procedure</b> for another, potentially concomitant, disease or condition. This may occur {{as a result of}} an incidental finding of a sign unrelated to the parameter of interest, such as can occur in comprehensive tests such as radiological studies like magnetic resonance imaging or blood test panels that also include blood tests that are not relevant for the ongoing diagnosis.|$|R
25|$|An ectopic {{pregnancy}} {{should be considered}} as the cause of abdominal pain or vaginal bleeding in every woman who has a positive pregnancy test. The primary goal of <b>diagnostic</b> <b>procedures</b> in possible {{ectopic pregnancy}} is to triage according to risk rather than establishing pregnancy location.|$|E
25|$|Diagnosis {{is largely}} {{achieved}} by obtaining a complete medical history followed by physical exam and ultrasound. If need be, laboratory tests or hysteroscopy may be used. The following are {{a list of}} <b>diagnostic</b> <b>procedures</b> that medical professionals may use to identify {{the cause of the}} abnormal uterine bleeding.|$|E
25|$|The Parkinson's Disease Center is a {{full service}} {{diagnostic}} center for Parkinson's disease. The center offers comprehensive approaches for diagnostic, surgical and rehabilitative services for patients with Parkinson's disease and parkinsonism. Detailed <b>diagnostic</b> <b>procedures</b> can determine origins as an occupational disease, the presence of accompanying dementia, {{and the need for}} the surgical intervention.|$|E
25|$|In this case, an epidemiology-based {{differential}} <b>diagnostic</b> <b>procedure</b> is used, and {{its first}} step is to find candidate conditions that can explain the finding.|$|R
30|$|MRI as a {{first-line}} <b>diagnostic</b> <b>procedure.</b> Evaluation of {{the results}} is recommended {{to be done by}} an imaging expert in collaboration with an experienced gynaecologist.|$|R
50|$|Diagnosis {{is a major}} {{component}} of the procedure of a doctor's visit. From {{the point of view of}} statistics, the <b>diagnostic</b> <b>procedure</b> involves classification tests.|$|R
25|$|The second method {{improves}} on {{the first}} by having investigators examine student or patient records looking for probable cases, to catch cases {{that have not been}} identified yet. The third method, which is arguably the best, screens a large sample of an entire community to identify possible cases, and then evaluates each possible case in more detail with standard <b>diagnostic</b> <b>procedures.</b> This last method typically produces the most reliable, and the highest, prevalence estimates.|$|E
25|$|The Papanicolaou test (abbreviated as Pap test, known earlier as Pap smear, {{cervical}} smear, or smear test) is {{a method}} of cervical screening used to detect potentially pre-cancerous and cancerous processes in the cervix (opening of the uterus or womb). Abnormal findings are often followed up by more sensitive <b>diagnostic</b> <b>procedures,</b> and, if warranted, interventions that aim to prevent progression to cervical cancer. The test was invented by, and named for, the prominent Greek doctor Georgios Papanikolaou.|$|E
25|$|The {{subject of}} Brain death {{was covered in}} Taiwanese medical drama Wake Up 2, where a person can only {{formally}} start <b>diagnostic</b> <b>procedures</b> after the immediate family or spouse. A person is considered for the test when the patient has a Glasgow Coma Scale of between 2 or 3, but cannot breathe or maintain a heartbeat on his/her own. The patient won't formally be declared brain dead if he/she passes {{any one of the}} two tests administered by neurosurgeons, neurologists and/or organ donation specialists.|$|E
50|$|Several {{different}} polymerase {{chain reaction}} tests are available {{for the detection of}} Leishmania DNA. With this assay, a specific and sensitive <b>diagnostic</b> <b>procedure</b> is finally possible.|$|R
50|$|Diagnostic peritoneal lavage (DPL) or {{diagnostic}} peritoneal aspiration (DPA) is {{a surgical}} <b>diagnostic</b> <b>procedure</b> {{to determine if}} there is free floating fluid (most often blood) in the abdominal cavity.|$|R
40|$|AIM: To compare a first <b>diagnostic</b> <b>procedure</b> of transbronchial needle {{aspiration}} (TBNA) with {{selection of}} endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) or TBNA for mediastinal lymphadenopathy. METHODS: Sixty-eight consecutive patients with mediastinal lymphadenopathy on computed tomography (CT), who required cytopathological diagnosis, were recruited. The first 34 underwent a sequential approach in which TBNA was performed first, followed by EUS-FNA if TBNA was unrevealing. The next 34 underwent a selective approach where either TBNA or EUS-FNA {{was selected as}} the first procedure based on the CT findings. RESULTS: The diagnostic yield of TBNA as the first <b>diagnostic</b> <b>procedure</b> in the sequential approach was 62 %. In the selective approach, the diagnostic yield of the first procedure was 71 %. There {{was no significant difference in}} the overall diagnostic yield, but there were significantly fewer combined procedures with the selective approach. CONCLUSION: Selecting either EUS-FNA or TBNA as the first <b>diagnostic</b> <b>procedure</b> achieved a comparable diagnostic yield with significantly fewer procedures than performing TBNA first in all patients...|$|R
