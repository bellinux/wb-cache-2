40|$|In {{this work}} {{the design and}} set-up of a bi-pendulum testing rig able to perform low-velocity impact {{measurements}} on small and medium-size components is reported. Experimental tests were conducted both to check the theoretically calculated value of the equivalent impacting mass and to quantify the overall energy losses during the idle movement of the mass. In order to provide useful information on the material behaviour during a crash test, the impact testing machine has been instrumented with different sensors: a piezoelectric accelerometer placed on the impact mass to measure the horizontal acceleration, an optical sensor to measure the initial impact velocity, a piezo film load cell, developed by the Authors, placed on the sample <b>holder</b> <b>block,</b> to measure the impact force directly on the specimen. 1.

40|$|This study {{surveyed}} {{and attempted}} to reconcile the differences between prior studies on <b>block</b> <b>holders</b> (large shareholders) and their effect on firm value through earnings management. The study was motivated {{by the lack of}} consensus as to whether <b>block</b> <b>holders</b> have a positive or negative influence on firm value. <b>Block</b> <b>holders</b> will have a lot to lose (gain) when firms collapse (prosper) through earnings management. Shareholders also have a part to play in earnings management. Shareholders reward firms that are quality or have potential while they tend to discount non-quality firms. Investors tended to vote with their feet. The larger shareholders however were more sophisticated and had the ability to discount firms and vice versa depending on the information. This study finds that there is more room for further research on <b>block</b> <b>holders</b> and earning management to support or refute the conflicting findings...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the payout policies of UK firms {{listed on the}} London Stock Exchange during the 1990 s. It complements the existing literature by analyzing the trends in both dividends and total payouts (including share repurchases). In a dynamic panel data regression setting, we relate target payout ratios to control structure variables. Profitability drives payout decisions of the UK companies, but the presence of strong <b>block</b> <b>holders</b> or <b>block</b> <b>holder</b> coalitions considerably weakens the relationship between corporate earnings and payout dynamics. While {{the impact of the}} voting power of shareholders coalitions on payout ratios is found to be always negative, the magnitude of this effect differs across different categories of <b>block</b> <b>holders</b> (i. e. industrial firms, outside individuals, directors, financial institutions). The controlling shareholders appear to trade off the agency problems of free cash flow against the risk of underinvestment, and try to enforce payout policies that optimally balance these two costs. Finally, the paper improves upon some methodological flaws of the recent empirical studies of payout policy. ...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{sets out}} the {{empirical}} evidence on complex ownership and control using data for UK listed firms adapted from Faccio and Lang (2002) {{for the period}} 1996 - 1999. Using OLS estimation method, the thesis links corporate financial policies and performance with ownership and control. It reports a negative relationship between control concentration of the largest shareholder and dividend pay- out ratios in companies which separate ownership from control, and {{a positive relationship between}} ownership concentration of the largest shareholder and dividend payout ratios, in companies which do not. I show that higher control-rights grant larger shareholders incentives (lower cash-flow rights) and ability (higher control-rights) to extract private benefits, for companies which separate ownership from control. Supportive evidence emerges of a positive relationship between the largest shareholder's ownership concentration and debt ratio; when ownership concentration of the largest <b>block</b> <b>holder</b> increases, so does the possibility of collusion with management. It is further reported that, family companies employ more debt in their capital structures to prevent dilution of control and have significantly higher debt ratios and lower pay-out ratios than companies controlled by financial institutions. It may be argued that, the absence of strong external monitors makes it easy for family companies to pass control between generations. Finally, I test the relationship between voting rights of the largest shareholder and firm performance and report a negative relationship, suggesting reduction of corporate values. I demonstrate that firms whose control is shared among two family <b>block</b> <b>holders</b> accumulate more debt and perform worse than firms where the largest family <b>block</b> <b>holder</b> shares control with the second largest financial institution. This suggests that the incentives to collude with the largest shareholder or to monitor the largest shareholder are significantly affected by the type of <b>block</b> <b>holder.</b> It is also shown that firms with control coalition having more than two <b>block</b> <b>holders</b> perform better than those with only two <b>block</b> <b>holders,</b> especially those of the same type.

A flat, curved and slotted rail was jacked up a little above the bass drum shell and to this was attached the body of the cast tom holder itself. This was fitted with not one, but two ratchets and by judicious use of both you could actually have exceedingly limited horizontal height adjustment. A radial-toothed block was fixed to the tom which mated with a ratchet on the holder to maintain its playing angle, and very large capstan nuts locked tom to holder and holder to bass drum rail. These capstans had an annoying tendency to crush your fingers against the drum and were neither particularly stable nor hard wearing. But at the time, it was the best around. Hayman spurs were modelled on Ludwig type outrigger designs, but with large, cast circular <b>holder</b> <b>blocks</b> which matched the nut boxes and also located the tom legs.

This study takes samplefrom companies that published bonds in 2006. First, we investigate the relationship between corporate governance practices and credit risk. Credit risk (default risk) can be measured by bond ratings (Billings, 1999). Using ordered probit regressions, we find evidence that the quality of transparency and financial information disclosure that proxied by big- 4 auditors and audit committee havesignificant influence on bond ratings, but the relationship between <b>block</b> <b>holders</b> and institutional ownership is not significant on bond ratings. Second, we investigate the relationship between corporate governance practice and bond yields. Using multiple regressions, we find that corporate governance practices is not significant on bond yields.

This evidence is consistent to Bradley et. al, (2007), that bond ratings are the prominent determinant for bond yields.

40|$|This paper investigates managers' {{economic}} incentives for voluntary reporting on risk management and internal control using {{a sample of}} publicly traded firms in The Netherlands in the late 1990 s. In this particular setting, internal control reporting was voluntary and covered a wide business-based approach as defined in key internal control frameworks. We create an index to measure the extent of disclosure by identifying six reportable items related to internal control. Regarding managers' incentives to report, we hypothesize that voluntary disclosure increases with the extent of information and agency problems, as proxied by management and <b>block</b> <b>holder</b> ownership and financial leverage. Supporting our hypotheses, we find a negative relationship between the extent of internal control disclosure and management and <b>block</b> <b>holder</b> ownership, and positive relationship between the extent of disclosure and financial leverage. We interpret these findings as evidence for a conscious trade-off by managers, which {{is linked to the}} costs and benefits of making internal control disclosures. Additionally, we find some evidence that the extent of disclosure varies with firms' inherent risk exposure, as proxied by a number of firm operating characteristics. One implication of our findings is that regulators may wish to allow firms flexibility in their internal control reporting choice, as firms take a broad approach to internal control that goes beyond SOX-based regulations, and tailor their internal control reports to suit their specific environments. status: publishe...|$|R
