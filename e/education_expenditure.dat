25|$|Although {{significant}} {{progress has been}} made to increase human capital base through improved education system, still the quality of education experience is low and unequally distributed. Due to lack of good quality education at the basic and secondary levels, there has been a mushrooming market for private tutoring. Now to take private tuition has become more of an obligation than a remedial activity. According to the Egypt Human Development Report (2005), 58 percent of surveyed families stated that their children take private tutoring. The CAPMAS (2004) survey showed that households spend on average around 61 percent of total <b>education</b> <b>expenditure</b> on private tutoring. In addition, per household expenditure of the richest quintile on private tutoring is more than seven times that of the poorest. Among the issues is the lack of sufficient education in public schools and the need for private tuition. As of 2005, 61-70% of Egyptian students attend private tuition. Other common issues include: theft of public educational funds and leakage of exams.|$|E
2500|$|The {{author of}} an article, {{the history of}} {{education}} spending in Pakistan since 1972, argues that this policy target raises a fundamental question: What extraordinary {{things are going to}} happen that would enable Pakistan to achieve within six years what it has been unable to lay a hand on in the past six decades? The policy document is blank on this question and does not discuss the assumptions that form the basis of this target. Calculations of the author show that during the past 37 years, the highest public expenditure on education was 2.80 percent of GDP in 1987-88. Public expenditure on education as a percentage of GDP was actually reduced in 16 years and maintained in 5 years between 1972–73 and 2008-09. Thus, out of total 37 years since 1972, public expenditure on education as a percentage of GDP either decreased or remained stagnant for 21 years. The author argues if linear trend were maintained since 1972, Pakistan could have touched 4 percent of GDP well before 2015. However, it is unlikely to happen because the levels of spending have had remained significantly unpredictable and unsteady in the past. Given this disappointing trajectory, increasing public expenditure on education to 7 percent of GDP would be nothing less than a miracle but {{it is not going to}} be of godly nature. Instead, it is going to be the one of political nature because it has to be [...] "invented" [...] by those who are at the helm of affairs. The author suggests that little success can be made unless Pakistan adopts an [...] "unconventional" [...] approach to education. That is to say, education sector should be treated as a special sector by immunizing budgetary allocations for it from fiscal stresses and political and economic instabilities. Allocations for education should not be affected by squeezed fiscal space or surge in military expenditure or debts. At the same time, there is a need to debate others options about how Pakistan can [...] "invent" [...] the miracle of raising <b>education</b> <b>expenditure</b> to 7 percent of GDP by 2015.|$|E

The present study exposes that there exists long run relationship among real GDP per capita, per capita <b>education</b> <b>expenditures</b> and per capita health expenditures in Pakistan. There exists bidirectional relationship between per capita real GDP and per capita <b>education</b> <b>expenditures</b> in the short run, whereas per capita health expenditures and real GDP per capita do not granger cause each other in short run in Pakistan. Also, there exits bidirectional granger causality among real GDP per capita, per capita <b>education</b> <b>expenditures</b> and per capita health expenditures in long run in Pakistan.

40|$|Recent {{studies suggest}} that the {{allocation}} of <b>expenditures</b> in <b>education</b> matters for growth. Public education spending in many transition economies, however, is often inefficient and inequitable with education outlays misallocated across sectors. This highlights the need for an assessment of the nature of <b>education</b> <b>expenditures</b> in these countries. This paper attempts to fill the gap in the literature by estimating the determinants of <b>education</b> <b>expenditures</b> in the Russian Federation. Results from panel data analysis show that revenue and the student-population ratio {{have a positive impact on}} <b>education</b> <b>expenditures</b> while the effect of population density is negative. Three regional variables also show significant impact. The income and price elasticity of <b>education</b> <b>expenditures</b> are estimated to be 0. 56 and – 0. 47, respectively and is comparable to studies from other countries. The results presented here raise questions about how fiscal institutions and the structure of the political process in Russia may affect the degree of resource allocation in the educational sector during the transition process...|$|R

40|$|Governments {{around the}} world have taken a {{prominent}} role in financing education. While justifications for this involvement are varied, a common motivation is that <b>education</b> <b>expenditures</b> are a key to sustained economic growth. Economic theory provides a foundation for this belief. Many papers in the endogenous growth literature have formalized a link between public <b>education</b> <b>expenditures,</b> human capital accumulation and long-run growth. 1 While theory assigns public <b>education</b> <b>expenditures</b> a key role in growth, empirical support of the link is mixed. 2 As highlighted by William F. Blankenau and Nicole B. Simpson (2004), the disconnect between theory and data can be reconciled by taking {{a closer look at the}} theory. In nearly every model where growth is fueled by public <b>education</b> <b>expenditures,</b> a nonmonotonic relationship between expenditures and growth can arise. Public education spending increases growth while taxes may decrease growth, leaving the net effect ambiguous. Thus economic theory shows that to identify the growth effects of expenditures, one must account for any offsetting effects of the requisite taxation. However, most empirical investigations of these effects do not explicitly control for the method of finance. 3 In contrast, we make the relationship between expenditures, taxation and growth central to our analysis. We estimate a growth equation which arises from a fully specified theoretical model where public <b>education</b> <b>expenditures</b> matter for growth. A key innovation is that the regression accounts for the general equilibrium adjustment to the taxes levied in support of education. Using panel data from 23 developed countries over the period 1960 - 2000, we find a positive relationship between public <b>education</b> <b>expenditures</b> and long-run growth only when 1 controlling for the government budget constraint. 4 An interpretation of these results is that studies which fail to control for the method of finance underestimate the role of public <b>education</b> <b>expenditures.</b> A statistically insignificant coefficient in such analyses may indicate a positive growth effect of expenditures that is offset by the negative consequences of taxation...|$|R
