5|$|<b>Graphically,</b> the iso-profit line must be {{tangent to}} the {{production}} function.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, the game, {{along with}} its sequel, were remade for mobile phones in Japan. This version is <b>graphically</b> based on the Super Famicom remake of Dragon Quest III.|$|E
5|$|Artefacts in the {{collection}} include stone sculptures, ceramics and artefacts sculpted from bone, shell, obsidian and flint. The pieces in the museum <b>graphically</b> depict {{the two sides of}} the power exercised by Toniná, on the one hand with sculptures of the city's rulers and on the other with its depictions of bound prisoners of war.|$|E
5|$|Furthermore, Peterson, who {{had failed}} an {{instrument}} checkride nine {{months before the}} accident, had received his instrument training on airplanes equipped with a conventional artificial horizon as source of aircraft attitude information, while N3794N was equipped with an older-type Sperry F3 attitude gyroscope. Crucially, {{the two types of}} instruments display the same aircraft pitch attitude information in <b>graphically</b> opposite ways.|$|E
5|$|<b>Graphically,</b> F.E.A.R. uses normal mapping and {{parallax}} mapping to give textures a {{more realistic}} appearance; the latter is used to {{give the appearance of}} depth to flat bullet hole sprites on walls. Volumetric lighting and lightmapping are included {{with the addition of a}} per-pixel lighting model, allowing complex lighting effects to be developed. Vertex, pixel and high-level shaders, including a host of additional special effects, are also featured in Jupiter EX.|$|E
5|$|Louis Gossett, Jr. {{provides}} the {{voice for the}} Vortigaunts in Half-Life 2, and was partially chosen due to {{his role as the}} alien in the film Enemy Mine. In Episode Two, the Vortigaunts' voicing was done by Tony Todd. <b>Graphically,</b> the Vortigaunts in both Half-Life and Half-Life 2 were designed by concept artists Dhabih Eng and Chuck Jones.|$|E
5|$|The updated main {{interface}} has {{green and red}} indicators to show which features are active and which need attention. The firewall has several updated features in this version. A Block Traffic button present in the {{main interface}} blocks all incoming and outgoing Internet traffic. Another new feature, the Visual Tracker, <b>graphically</b> maps attacks back to their origin. The firewall blocked all port scans conducted by CNET, stealthing each port.|$|E
5|$|<b>Graphically</b> {{bounding}} {{the production}} set for fixed input quantities, the PPF curve shows the {{maximum possible production}} level of one commodity for any given production level of the other, given the existing state of technology. By doing so, it defines productive efficiency {{in the context of}} that production set: a point on the frontier indicates efficient use of the available inputs (such as points B, D and C in the graph), a point beneath the curve (such as A) indicates inefficiency, and a point beyond the curve (such as X) indicates impossibility.|$|E
5|$|Hitmaker {{had tried}} to develop an on-line version of Crazy Taxi, to be called Crazy Taxi Next {{exclusively}} for the Xbox, which, besides multiplayer game modes, would have included night and day cycles, each with {{a different set of}} passengers and destinations, while reusing and <b>graphically</b> updating the maps from Crazy Taxi and Crazy Taxi 2. Ultimately, both multiplayer and day/night cycles were dropped and work on Crazy Taxi Next was transferred to Crazy Taxi 3: High Roller, which included some of the nighttime driving concepts suggested by Next.|$|E
5|$|In his poetry, Chivers {{made use}} of legends and themes from Native American culture, {{particularly}} the Cherokee, though often with Christian overtones. He was also heavily influenced {{by the work of}} François-René de Chateaubriand and Emanuel Swedenborg. Many of Chivers's poems included themes of death and sorrow, often using images of shrouds, coffins, angels, and reunions with lost loves in the afterlife. Religious conventions at the time made discussion of death popular, as was reflected in poetry. Because of his background as a doctor, Chivers was able to <b>graphically</b> depict the last moments before someone's death.|$|E
5|$|McDowell's {{original}} {{script is}} far less comedic and much darker; the Maitlands' car crash is depicted <b>graphically,</b> with Barbara's arm being crushed and the couple screaming for help as they slowly drown in the river. A reference to this remained in all versions of the script, as Barbara remarks that her arm feels cold upon returning home as a ghost. Instead of possessing the Deetzes and forcing them to dance during dinner, the Maitlands cause a vine-patterned carpet to come to life and attack the Deetzes by tangling them to their chairs.|$|E
5|$|Since then, interpretations in {{successive}} eras {{have reflected}} the sensibilities of the time. Goya {{was seen as}} a proto-Romantic in the early 19th century, and the series' <b>graphically</b> rendered dismembered carcasses were a direct influence on Théodore Géricault, best known for the politically charged Raft of the Medusa (1818–19). Luis Buñuel identified with Goya's sense of the absurd, and referenced his works in such films as the 1930 L'Âge d'Or, on which he collaborated with Salvador Dalí, and his 1962 The Exterminating Angel.|$|E
5|$|Super Columbine Massacre RPG! is a {{role-playing}} video game. Players {{control the}} actions of teenagers Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold; the pair entered Colorado's Columbine High School on April 20, 1999 and killed 13 people before turning their guns on themselves in a library. Much of the game {{takes place in a}} third-person view, with players controlling Harris and Klebold from an overhead perspective. The graphics and characters are deliberately reminiscent of a 16-bit-era video game; while the content is violent, the violence is not <b>graphically</b> rendered.|$|E
5|$|Team Ninja {{continued}} {{to update the}} game after its release: two Hurricane Packs were made available as free downloadable content that added extra content, gameplay challenges, and game engine improvements. These were incorporated into a reworked version, released in 2005 and entitled Ninja Gaiden Black, that was regarded by the game's creator Tomonobu Itagaki and many players as the definitive version. In 2007, Ninja Gaiden was <b>graphically</b> enhanced on the PlayStation 3, with extra content, {{in the form of}} Ninja Gaiden Sigma. This version was later released on the PlayStation Vita as Ninja Gaiden Sigma Plus.|$|E
5|$|The Antonine Wall and its {{associated}} forts left a direct sculptural legacy in Scotland. There are 19 distance slabs along the wall that depict <b>graphically</b> the victories and marches of the legions involved in its construction. There are also surviving sculptures, including an altar to Diana and Apollo. There is a fountainhead from a bath-house {{in the shape of}} a man's head with a gaping mouth, and the head from a bust or statue, perhaps the goddess Fortuna, both found at Bearsden Roman Fort, East Dunbartonshire, both showing a local Celtic influence in their style.|$|E
5|$|Candi Sukuh {{temple of}} Ngancar, East Java, {{was built in}} the 10th century and is {{dedicated}} to Shiva and is evidence of Tantric ritual in Hinduism and the fertility cult practiced at the time and preoccupation with the lingga. The temple has numerous reliefs <b>graphically</b> depicting sexuality and fertility including several stone depictions of a copulating penis and vagina. It consists of a pyramid with reliefs and statues at the front. Among them is a male statue clutching his penis, with three tortoises with flattened shells. The temple once had a striking 1.82 metre (5'11.5ft) representation of lingga with four testicles; this is now housed in the National Museum of Indonesia. Phallic references were also made in Khmer architecture in Cambodia, and several Khmer temples depict the phallus in reliefs.|$|E
5|$|The Electronic Delay Storage Automatic Calculator (EDSAC) {{mainframe}} computer {{was built in}} the University of Cambridge's Mathematical Laboratory between 1946 and 6 May 1949, when it ran its first program, and remained in use until 11 July 1958. The EDSAC {{was one of the first}} stored-program computers, with memory that could be read from or written to, and filled an entire room; it included three 35×16 dot matrix cathode ray tubes (CRTs) to <b>graphically</b> display the state of the computer's memory. As a part of a thesis on human-computer interaction, Alexander S. Douglas, a doctoral candidate in mathematics at the university, used one of these screens to portray other information to the user; he chose to do so via displaying the current state of a game.|$|E
5|$|In July 1095, Urban {{turned to}} his {{homeland}} of France to recruit men for the expedition. His travels there culminated in the Council of Clermont in November, where, according to the various speeches attributed to him, he gave an impassioned sermon to a large audience of French nobles and clergy, <b>graphically</b> detailing the fantastical atrocities being committed against pilgrims and eastern Christians. There are five versions of the speech recorded by {{people who may have}} been at the council (Baldric of Dol, Guibert of Nogent, Robert the Monk, and Fulcher of Chartres) or who went on crusade (Fulcher and the anonymous author of the Gesta Francorum), as well as other versions found in later historians (such as William of Malmesbury and William of Tyre). All of these versions were written after Jerusalem had been captured. Thus {{it is difficult to know}} what was actually said and what was recreated in the aftermath of the successful crusade. The only contemporary records are a few letters written by Urban in 1095.|$|E
25|$|Quaternary phase {{diagrams}} {{in chemistry}} are represented <b>graphically</b> as tetrahedra.|$|E
25|$|However, {{quaternary}} phase diagrams {{in communication}} engineering are represented <b>graphically</b> on a two-dimensional plane.|$|E
25|$|A <b>graphically</b> similar, but not identical, mark is {{indicative}} of a palatalized sound in several languages.|$|E
25|$|Various games also adapt The Two Towers, {{including}} online role-playing {{games like}} The Two Towers Mud and <b>graphically</b> oriented console games.|$|E
25|$|Ground {{penetrating}} radar pulses {{electromagnetic waves}} into {{the pavement and}} measures and <b>graphically</b> displays the reflected signal. This can reveal voids and other defects.|$|E
25|$|Though {{presented}} in syllabic form, syllabics {{is not a}} true syllabary, but an alpha-syllabary (abugida), since syllables starting with the same consonant are written with <b>graphically</b> similar letters.|$|E
25|$|The elements, that {{comprise}} the cost can be <b>graphically</b> depicted (see image). Beside the here three listed principal divisions, it mentions the selling and administrative expenses, together compromising the total expenses.|$|E
25|$|This {{potential}} for confusion {{can be seen}} <b>graphically</b> in the table of initials, where the bold letters j, ch and sh cut across the highlighted division between alveolo-palatal and retroflex.|$|E
25|$|Simple phase {{diagrams}} or plots {{are commonly}} used to illustrate such geochemical reactions. Eh-pH (Pourbaix) diagrams, for example, are a special type of activity diagram which represent acid-base and redox chemistry <b>graphically.</b>|$|E
25|$|Data {{designer}}: The data designer {{can be used}} to <b>graphically</b> edit database schemas, including typed tables, {{primary and}} foreign keys and constraints. It {{can also be used to}} design queries from the graphical view.|$|E
25|$|Population {{data shows}} that normal QRS axis is from −30° to 105° with 0° being along lead I and {{positive}} being inferior and negative being superior (best understood <b>graphically</b> as the hexaxial reference system).|$|E
25|$|Cormac McCarthy's 1985 novel Blood Meridian, Or the Evening Redness in the West {{includes}} {{a scene in}} which one of the two Jacksons decapitates the other by a campfire, leading to a <b>graphically</b> described blood spurt.|$|E
25|$|Building {{technologies}} and smart meters can allow energy users, business and residential, to see <b>graphically</b> the impact their energy use can {{have in their}} workplace or homes. Advanced real-time energy metering is able to help people save energy by their actions.|$|E
25|$|Each {{of the two}} populations being {{compared}} should follow a normal distribution. This can be tested using a normality test, such as the Shapiro–Wilk or Kolmogorov–Smirnov test, {{or it can be}} assessed <b>graphically</b> using a normal quantile plot.|$|E
25|$|The quartet {{is still}} {{often used to}} {{illustrate}} the importance of looking at a set of data <b>graphically</b> before starting to analyze according to {{a particular type of}} relationship, and the inadequacy of basic statistic properties for describing realistic datasets.|$|E
25|$|On April 28, 2014, the film's {{principal}} photography began. Many natural {{scenes in}} the film were from Son Doong Cave, Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng National Park and Ninh Bình Province in Vietnam. The captured scenes were then <b>graphically</b> edited into the film.|$|E
25|$|The {{process can}} be <b>graphically</b> {{described}} by a rooted tree graph, as depicted on the right. The root of the tree is the formula we wish to prove; the leaves consist of atomic formulas only. The tree {{is known as a}} reduction tree.|$|E
25|$|<b>Graphically,</b> {{as long as}} {{the prices}} remain constant, {{changing}} income will create a parallel shift of the budget constraint. Increasing the income will shift the budget constraint right since more of both can be bought, and decreasing income will shift it left.|$|E
