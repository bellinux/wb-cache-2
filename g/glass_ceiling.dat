5|$|Méliès's film studio, {{which he}} had built in Montreuil, Seine-Saint-Denis in 1897, was a greenhouse-like {{building}} with glass walls and a <b>glass</b> <b>ceiling</b> to let in as much sunlight as possible, a concept used by most still photography studios from the 1860s onward; it was built with the same dimensions as Méliès's own Théâtre Robert-Houdin (13.5×6.6m). Throughout his film career, Méliès worked on a strict schedule of planning films in the morning, filming scenes during the brightest hours of the day, tending to the film laboratory and the Théâtre Robert-Houdin in the late afternoon, and attending performances at Parisian theaters in the evening.|$|E
5|$|These {{challenges}} {{are included in}} the goals of the Office of Research on Women's Health, in the United States, as is the goal of facilitating women's access to careers in biomedicine. The ORWH believes that {{one of the best ways}} to advance research in women's health is to increase the proportion of women involved in healthcare and health research, as well as assuming leadership in government, centres of higher learning, and in the private sector. This goal acknowledges the <b>glass</b> <b>ceiling</b> that women face in careers in science and in obtaining resources from grant funding to salaries and laboratory space. The National Science Foundation in the United States states that women only gain half of the doctorates awarded in science and engineering, fill only 21% of full-time professor positions in science and 5% of those in engineering, while earning only 82% of the remuneration their male colleagues make. These figures are even lower in Europe.|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to review many of the diverse metaphors and labels that are used to {{highlight}} insights into <b>glass</b> <b>ceilings</b> – the obstacles hindering women reaching the top levels of organizations. Design/methodology/approach – The development of metaphors and labels related to theories about the causes and consequences of <b>glass</b> <b>ceilings</b> are discussed. They are classified according to whether or not they infer women play a role in creating <b>glass</b> <b>ceilings.</b> Findings – It is concluded that most metaphor-linked explanations focus on discrimination and prejudice towards women seeking leadership positions. A small number of metaphors target characteristics of women as causes for the gender inequality in leadership and upper management. Practical implications – Even though there is a plethora of metaphors highlighting obstacles and prejudice against women leaders and several metaphors have been part of the popular lexicon for at least three decades, metaphors do not appear to have greatly helped to quicken the dismantling of <b>glass</b> <b>ceilings...</b>|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{explores the}} <b>glass</b> <b>ceilings</b> faced by women managers of Maldives. The {{study revealed that}} <b>glass</b> <b>ceilings</b> or ‘invisible barriers’ exist in Maldivian work environment that hinders women from achieving senior positions. Taking the narratological approach, this research interprets the experiences of seven female managers of Maldives, and being member of the tribe, my personal experiences are shared when the stories of these women were interpreted using thematic analysis. The findings of this research revealed that Maldivian women managers have been prone to various <b>glass</b> <b>ceilings</b> that have been directly related to their job and indirectly related to their job. Hence, the data exposed direct barriers such as perception of male employees towards the female employees, harassment and bullying at work and also various forms of discrimination which led to frustration of the managers. Indirect barriers appeared as the dual role of working women acting as an indirect barrier along {{with the need for}} family support and the lack of support facilities for working women act as indirect <b>glass</b> <b>ceilings</b> which they face outside their jobs...|$|R

25|$|The <b>glass</b> <b>ceiling</b> metaphor {{has often}} been used to {{describe}} invisible barriers ("glass") through which women can see elite positions but cannot reach them ("ceiling"). These barriers prevent large numbers of women and ethnic minorities from obtaining and securing the most powerful, prestigious and highest-grossing jobs in the workforce. Moreover, this effect prevents women from filling high-ranking positions and puts them at a disadvantage as potential candidates for advancement.|$|E
25|$|In addition, {{women are}} found to {{experience}} a sticky floor. While a <b>glass</b> <b>ceiling</b> implies that women are less like {{to reach the top}} of the job ladder, a sticky floor is defined as the pattern that women are, compared to men, less likely to start to climb the job ladder. A sticky floor is related to gender differences {{at the bottom of the}} wage distribution. It might be explained by both employer discrimination and gender differences in career aspirations.|$|E

Our analysis uses linked employer-employee data to measure mean- and quantile-wage differentials of immigrants and ethnic minorities, both within and across firms. We find that <b>glass</b> <b>ceilings</b> exist for some immigrant groups, {{and that they are}} driven in large measure by glass doors.

25|$|Perhaps D'Ascenzo Studios' most varied {{commission}} was for Rodeph Shalom Synagogue (1927) in Philadelphia. The Moorish Revival building {{was designed by}} architects (and brothers) Grant and Edward Simon, and nearly every surface in its sanctuary was covered with decoration. The studio designed its murals, twenty stained glass windows (including the <b>glass</b> <b>ceiling</b> of the dome), lighting fixtures, carpets, and even the bronze ark for the Torah. The studio also created the mosaics on the synagogue's façade, whose colors remain vibrant after nearly ninety years.|$|E
25|$|The <b>glass</b> <b>ceiling</b> is one {{prevalent}} {{concern about}} the quality of economic opportunity available to women involved in the formal labor market. This phenomenon is the de facto limitation of females' ability to achieve the top levels of leadership in an organization. While the concept is not restricted to the market, it is prevalent in profit-based institutions. With respect to female workers in majority Muslim countries, women are not evenly represented {{on the board of directors}} or among the senior management positions of most of the 100 most lucrative companies in the Arab World.|$|E
25|$|No women {{occupy the}} top {{leadership}} {{positions in the}} most profitable Iranian businesses either. Iran's three largest companies-National Iranian Oil Company (the second largest in the Muslim World), Iran Khodro, and National Petrochemical Company-also {{do not have any}} women in senior leadership positions. This is not surprising as the 2006 Iranian census showed that only 4% of women are in senior executive or management positions. Critics of Iran's radical shia theocratic government may attribute this evidence of limited female economic mobility as a critique of the government's ideology. However, in Turkey, which is a secular state governed by a moderate Islamic party, women comprised only 8% of managers in the labor force in 2007. Regardless of the official status of Islam or the ideology of the ruling party, there exists some evidence of a <b>glass</b> <b>ceiling</b> for women in the private sector.|$|E
40|$|Using {{harmonised}} {{data from}} the European Union Household Panel, we analyse gender pay gaps by sector across the wages distribution for eleven countries. We find that the mean gender pay gap in the raw data typically hides large variations in the gap across the wages distribution. We use quantile regression techniques to control {{for the effects of}} individual and job characteristics at different points of the distribution, and calculate the part of the gap attributable to differing returns between men and women. We find that, first, gender pay gaps are typically bigger {{at the top of the}} wage distribution, a finding that is consistent with the existence of <b>glass</b> <b>ceilings.</b> Second, for some countries gender pay gaps are also bigger at the bottom of the wage distribution, a finding that is consistent with sticky floors. Third, the gender pay gap is typically higher at the top than the bottom end of the wage distribution, suggesting that <b>glass</b> <b>ceilings</b> are more prevalent than sticky floors. Fourth, the gender pay gap differs significantly across the public and the private sector wages distribution for each of our EU countries. <b>glass</b> <b>ceilings,</b> sticky floors, quantile regression, public sector, gender pay gaps. ...|$|R

25|$|The {{technical}} requirements and exacting standards required of a facility like the Kauffman Center made {{it one of}} the most complex structures in the world to design and build. The building, which took nearly five years to complete, contains 40,000 square feet of glass, 25,000 cubic yards of concrete, and 27 steel cables. The main lobby, Brandmeyer Great Hall, is built of a <b>glass</b> <b>ceiling</b> and sloping glass walls that provide a panoramic view of Kansas City to the south. The twenty-seven steel cables on the south façade are anchored in embeds that weigh approximately one and a half tons, and the embeds are an extension of the foundation and bedrock beneath the building. When the steel cables were pulled taut during the construction process, the entire steel structure shifted two to six inches to the south. This tensioning provides stability to the structure and keeps the glass lobby securely in place. The Kauffman Center covers 13 acres (53,000 m2), including landscaped grounds over the 1,000-space, city-owned Arts District Garage. The cost of the project was approximately $413 million, which includes both a $40 million operating endowment and the city’s $47 million construction of the parking garage. The Kauffman Center was designed by lead architect Moshe Safdie, acoustician Yasuhisa Toyota, theater consultant Theatre Projects Consultants and Richard Pilbrow, and engineering firm Arup. Local firm BNIM was the associate architect. Lead contractor was J.E. Dunn Construction Group of Kansas City.|$|E

[...] This perspective argues that research and theory treats women and the feminist movement as insignificant and refuses to see traditional science as unbiased.

500|$|In 1986, Signithia Fordham co-authored with Nigerian {{sociologist}} John Ogbu a {{study that}} concluded that high-performing African-American students in a Washington, D.C., high school borrowed from hegemonic white culture {{as part of a}} strategy for achievement, while struggling to maintain a black identity. Ogbu made a related claim in his 2003 book, Black American Students in an Affluent Suburb: A Study of Academic Disengagement, concluding that black students' own cultural attitudes sometimes hindered academic achievement and that these attitudes are too often neglected. Ogbu had earlier written in his seminal work Minority Education and Caste (1978), that school disengagement among caste-like minorities occurs because white society limits the job-success of their parents and others in their communities by a <b>glass</b> <b>ceiling.</b> In his new book, he said that non-whites [...] "failed to observe the link between educational achievement and access to jobs." ...|$|E
