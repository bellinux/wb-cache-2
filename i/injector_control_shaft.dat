The first application {{was on the}} VQ37VHR V6 engine of Skyline Coupe (Infiniti G37). Nissan's system is more compact than BMW’s, involving fewer parts and less energy loss, and is therefore more adaptable to high-performance engines. [...] The VVEL does not use a conventional intake camshaft. Each valve is actuated by a cam which is pivoted on - but not fixed to - the camshaft. While conventional camshafts feature fixed rotating lobes, the cam in VVEL swings up and down; {{this is why it}} does not need a symmetric profile. Its movement is driven by the camshaft via a series of components. VVEL varies valve lift by the eccentric <b>control</b> <b>shaft</b> inside the rocker arm. By rotating the eccentric <b>control</b> <b>shaft,</b> the position of rocker arm is shifted, changing the swing angle of cam. The swing angle of cam determines the degree of valve lift.|$|R

40|$|In current {{concepts}} {{for fuel}} injection valves, {{the importance of}} piezoelectric elements as actuating devices is steadily increasing. These actuators allow valves to open and to close in less than 200 µs while providing bene&# 64257;ts in the metering accuracy. However, the resulting accelerations of the injector mechanics usually go together with high amplitudes of the occuring forces. Especially tensile stresses may damage the fragile ceramic and bouncing of contiguous constructive elements has {{a negative impact on}} the durability of the valve. Additionally, common <b>injector</b> <b>control</b> implementations do not consider the induced mechanical vibrations which adversely a&# 64256;ect the fueling shape. This thesis addresses problems which arise from shortened opening and closing phases and presents measures to reduce these. Chapter 2 compares di&# 64256;erent mathematical approaches to model the nonlinear behaviour of piezoelectric actuators. Special attention is paid to the usability of the models for both actuating and sensing capabilities of the electromechanical transformers. In chapter 3, the actuator equations are incorporated into several mathematical models of the whole injector with lumped and distributed parameters. The models with distributed parameters achieve an acceptable representation of the behaviour of real injectors and provide a detailed insight into the mechanical processes during the injection. Thereby these models can be used to evaluate control strategies. The developed mathematical models of the injectors form the basis for the design of a state space observer in chapter 4 which yields state information of the valve’s mechanics that otherwise would have to be provided by additional cost expensive sensors. Having access not only to the electrical signals but also to the mechanical state, a static optimization of the <b>injector</b> <b>control</b> parameters results in opening and closing processes with minimal strain on the injector and increased acceptability of the fueling shape. In the &# 64257;nal chapter, measurements validate the derived algorithms and prove the e&# 64256;ectivity of the presented control strategy...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} active instability control experiments from a {{high pressure}} (up to 170 psia), Jet A-fueled combustor. These experiments were performed to improve understanding of the factors limiting control performance. A set of experiments were performed where the desired level of instability amplitude suppression was systematically increased. The controller effectively drove the rms instability amplitude to the desired levels down to approximately 15 % of those without control. Attempts to further drive the oscillations to a lower level resulted in deterioration in performance, manifested by a “peak splitting ” phenomenon previously described by Hibshman et al 1. Experiments were also performed at different conditions where the linear and nonlinear characteristics of the self-excited oscillations were varied. They show that the combustor’s nominal dynamics (i. e., without control) has an important effect upon its response to over-gaining of the fuel <b>injector</b> <b>control</b> signal (resulting in peak splitting) ...|$|R

The motivation var-ies from less time, effort and money expenditure to higher system quality and reliability which is especially impor-tant in the domain of high energy physics and accelerator controls.

In total 11 tunable cavities (10 operational and a hot spare, grouped into 3 + 1 tuning groups and up to presently 6 voltage program groups) are distributed all around the circumference of the PS ring.

These control signals are presently generated by a dedicated hardware matrix. It translates voltage functions and relay timing pulses per cavity group into functions and timings per cavity. However, due to its central position in the RF beam control system, the dedicated hardware matrix can cause significant downtime in case of a major hardware failure.

As the lever translates linear motion by the operator into rotary motion of the lever, the level is normally topped with a rotating knob at the right end.

The spray characteristics, such as the spray penetration, the spray angle, and the injection quantity, were studied through the change of the injection pressure, the ambient pressure, and the energizing duration in a high-pressure chamber with a constant volume. The n-heptane with 99. 5 % purity was used as the test fuel. In a constant volume chamber, the injected spray was visualized by the spray visualization system, which consisted of the high-speed camera, the metal-halide lamp, the <b>injector</b> <b>control</b> device, and the image analysis system with the image processing program. It was revealed that the injection quantity was mainly affected by the difference between the injection pressure and the ambient pressure. For low injection pressure conditions, the injection quantity was decreased by the increase of the ambient pressure, while it nearly maintained regardless of the ambient pressure at high injection pressure. According to the increase of the ambient pressure in the constant volume chamber, the spray development became slow, consequently, the spray tip penetration decreased, and the spray area increased.

40|$|Aggressive engine downsizing, {{variable}} {{compression ratio}} {{and use of the}} Atkinson cycle are being combined to improve fuel economy by up to 40 percent relative to port fuel injected gasoline engines, while maintaining full engine power. Approach Engine downsizing is viewed by US and foreign automobile manufacturers {{as one of the best}} options for improving fuel economy. While this strategy has already demonstrated a degree of success, downsizing and fuel economy gains are currently limited. With new {{variable compression ratio}} technology however, the degree of engine downsizing and fuel economy improvement can be greatly increased. A small variable compression ratio (VCR) engine has the potential to return significantly higher vehicle fuel economy while also providing high power. Affordability and potential for near term commercialization are key attributes of the Envera VCR engine. VCR Technology To meet torque and power requirements, a smaller engine needs to do more work per stroke. This is typically accomplished by boosting the incoming charge with either a turbo or supercharger so that more energy is present in the cylinder per stroke to do the work. With current production engines the degree of engine boosting (which correlates to downsizing) is limited by detonation (combustion knock) at high boost levels. Additionally, the turbo or supercharger needs to be responsive and efficient while providing the needed boost. VCR technology eliminates the limitation of engine knock at high load levels by reducing compression ratio to {approx} 9 : 1 (or whatever level is appropriate) when high boost pressures are needed. By reducing the compression ratio during high load demand periods there is increased volume in the cylinder at top dead center (TDC) which allows more charge (or energy) to be present in the cylinder without increasing the peak pressure. Cylinder pressure is thus kept below the level at which the engine would begin to knock. When loads on the engine are low the compression ratio can be raised (to as much as 18 : 1) providing high engine efficiency. It is important to recognize that for a well designed VCR engine cylinder pressure does not need to be higher than found in current production turbocharged engines. As such, there is no need for a stronger crankcase, bearings and other load bearing parts within the VCR engine. The Envera VCR mechanism uses an eccentric carrier approach to adjust engine compression ratio. The crankshaft main bearings are mounted in this eccentric carrier or 'crankshaft cradle' and pivoting the eccentric carrier 30 degrees adjusts compression ratio from 9 : 1 to 18 : 1. The eccentric carrier is made up of a casting that provides rigid support for the main bearings, and removable upper bearing caps. Oil feed to the main bearings transits through the bearing cap fastener sockets. The eccentric carrier design was chosen for its low cost and rigid support of the main bearings. A <b>control</b> <b>shaft</b> and connecting links are used to pivot the eccentric carrier. The <b>control</b> <b>shaft</b> mechanism features compression ratio lock-up at minimum and maximum compression ratio settings. The <b>control</b> <b>shaft</b> method of pivoting the eccentric carrier was selected due to its lock-up capability. The <b>control</b> <b>shaft</b> can be rotated by a hydraulic actuator or an electric motor. The engine shown in Figures 3 and 4 has a hydraulic actuator that was developed under the current program. In-line 4 -cylinder engines are significantly less expensive than V engines because an entire cylinder head can be eliminated. The cost savings from eliminating cylinders and an entire cylinder head will notably offset the added cost of the VCR and supercharging. Replacing V 6 and V 8 engines with in-line VCR 4 -cylinder engines will provide high fuel economy at low cost. Numerous enabling technologies exist which have the potential to increase engine efficiency. The greatest efficiency gains are realized when the right combination of advanced and new technologies are packaged together to provide the greatest gains at the least cost. Aggressive engine downsizing with variable compression ratio and use of the extended Atkinson cycle can provide large fuel economy gains that are exceptionally cost effective. Analysis indicates that a 2. 2 L supercharged Envera VCR engine can match the torque of a larger V 8 engine at 2000 rpm. The VCR engine's high torque value at low engine speed is beneficial for maintaining the driving feel and responsiveness of the larger V 8 engine. The Envera VCR engine will attain high efficiency at {approx} 100 Nm primarily due to the combination of engine down-sizing and use of the Atkinson cycle. Qualitatively the fuel economy gain realized from down-sizing from a V 8 to an Atkinson-cycle I- 4 is about twice as large as the benefits from down-sizing from a V 8 to a Turbo V 6 when evaluated at 100 Nm 2000 rpm...|$|R
