5|$|Accession to EU {{required}} {{a new law}} compliant with the European Firearms Directive, which was passed in 2002.

5|$|After the discovery, {{the rare}} element had only minor applications; for <b>example,</b> <b>by</b> {{the turn of}} the century, rhodium-containing {{thermocouples}} were used to measure temperatures up to 1800°C. The first major application was electroplating for decorative uses and as corrosion-resistant coating. The introduction of the three-way catalytic converter by Volvo in 1976 increased the demand for rhodium. The previous catalytic converters used platinum or palladium, while the three-way catalytic converter used rhodium {{to reduce the amount of}} NOx in the exhaust.|$|E
5|$|Although most {{cells have}} other enzymes that can degrade RNA, {{either from the}} 3' or from the 5' end of the RNA, the exosome complex is {{essential}} for cell survival. When the expression of exosome proteins is artificially reduced or stopped, for <b>example</b> <b>by</b> RNA interference, growth stops and the cells eventually die. Both the core proteins of the exosome complex, {{as well as the}} two main associated proteins, are essential proteins. Bacteria do not have an exosome complex; however, similar functions are performed by a simpler complex that includes the protein PNPase, called the degradosome.|$|E

5|$|Another {{important}} factor in the evaluation of chess positions is the pawn structure (sometimes known as the pawn skeleton), or the configuration of pawns on the chessboard. Since pawns are the least mobile of the chess pieces, the pawn structure is relatively static and largely determines the strategic nature of the position. Weaknesses in the pawn structure, such as isolated, doubled, or backward pawns and , once created, are often permanent. Care must therefore be taken to avoid these weaknesses unless they are compensated by another valuable asset (for <b>example,</b> <b>by</b> the possibility of developing an attack).|$|E
5|$|Clearly, some tumors {{evade the}} immune system and go on to become cancers. Tumor cells often have a reduced number of MHC class I {{molecules}} on their surface, thus avoiding detection by killer T cells. Some tumor cells also release products that inhibit the immune response; for <b>example</b> <b>by</b> secreting the cytokine TGF-β, which suppresses the activity of macrophages and lymphocytes. In addition, immunological tolerance may develop against tumor antigens, so {{the immune system}} no longer attacks the tumor cells.|$|E
5|$|Concentrated {{solar power}} plants may use thermal storage to store solar energy, such as in {{high-temperature}} molten salts. These salts are an effective storage medium because they are low-cost, have a high specific heat capacity, and can deliver heat at temperatures compatible with conventional power systems. This method of energy storage is used, for <b>example,</b> <b>by</b> the Solar Two power station, allowing it to store 1.44TJ in its 68m³ storage tank, enough to provide full output for close to 39 hours, with an efficiency of about 99%.|$|E

CEC also allows for individual CEC-enabled devices to command and control each other without user intervention.|$|E
5|$|Draw by agreement: Draws {{are most}} {{commonly}} reached {{by mutual agreement}} between the players. The correct procedure is to verbally offer the draw, make a move, then start the opponent's clock. Traditionally, players {{have been allowed to}} agree to a draw at any point in the game, occasionally even without playing a move; in recent years efforts have been made to discourage short draws, for <b>example</b> <b>by</b> forbidding draw offers before move thirty.|$|E

The attempts of Otto to conciliate Greek sentiment through efforts to enlarge the frontiers of his kingdom, for <b>example,</b> <b>by</b> the suggested acquisition of Crete in 1841, failed in their objective, and only succeeded in embroiling him in conflict with the Great Powers.|$|E

5|$|In the {{historical}} {{writing of the}} time, the humble devotion of the Decembrist women was contrasted with the intrigues and hedonism of female aristocrats of the 18thcentury, like Catherine the Great, whose excesses were seen as the danger of too-sudden liberation for women. Although they did not explicitly espouse a feminist agenda, the Decembrist women were used as an <b>example</b> <b>by</b> later generations of Russian feminists, whose concern for gender equality was also tied to revolutionary political agendas.|$|E

The MSE can also be considered part of the comprehensive physical examination performed by physicians and nurses although it may be performed in a cursory and abbreviated way in non-mental-health settings.

5|$|Like all actinides, {{einsteinium}} {{is rather}} reactive. Its trivalent oxidation state is most stable in solids and aqueous solution where it induced pale pink color. The existence of divalent einsteinium is firmly established, especially in solid phase; such +2 {{state is not}} observed in many other actinides, including protactinium, uranium, neptunium, plutonium, curium and berkelium. Einsteinium(II) compounds can be obtained, for <b>example,</b> <b>by</b> reducing einsteinium(III) with samarium(II) chloride. The oxidation state +4 was postulated from vapor studies and is yet uncertain.|$|E
