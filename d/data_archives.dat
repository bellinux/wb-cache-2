5|$|Today, Christians make up 57% of the state's population, with Protestants {{making up}} 21% of them. Roman Catholics make up 34% and now predominate because of massive {{immigration}} from primarily Catholic countries and regions – chiefly Ireland, Italy, Poland, Portugal, Quebec, and Latin America. Both Protestant and Roman Catholic communities {{have been in}} decline since the late 20th century, due {{to the rise of}} irreligion in New England. It is the most irreligious region of the country, along with the Western United States. A significant Jewish population immigrated to the Boston and Springfield areas between 1880 and 1920. Jews currently make up 3% of the population. Mary Baker Eddy made the Boston Mother Church of Christian Science serve as the world headquarters of this new religious movement. Buddhists, Pagans, Hindus, Seventh-day Adventists, Muslims, and Mormons can also be found. Kripalu Center in Stockbridge, the Shaolin Meditation Temple in Springfield, and the Insight Meditation Center in Barre are examples of non-Abrahamic religious centers in Massachusetts. According to 2010 data from The Association of Religion <b>Data</b> <b>Archives,</b> (ARDA) the largest single denominations are the Catholic Church with 2,940,199 adherents; the United Church of Christ with 86,639 adherents; and the Episcopal Church with 81,999 adherents. 32% of the population identifies as having no religion.|$|E

The ReCollect plug-in allows any institution to install their own EPrints data repository with relative ease.

For both developments, extensive customisation was done to make the EPrints software more suitable for complex collections of research data. The metadata profile was expanded, based on standard metadata schemas DataCite, GEMINI and DDI. The workflow and user interface were optimised for their purpose and policy information and help guidance added.
