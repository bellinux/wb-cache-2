5|$|The King Island emu and the {{mainland}} emu show few morphological differences {{other than their}} significant difference in size. Mathews stated that the legs and bill were shorter than those of {{the mainland}} emu, yet the toes were nearly of equal length, and therefore proportionally longer. The tarsus of the King Island emu was also three times longer than the culmen, whereas it was four times longer in the mainland emu. Additional traits that supposedly distinguish this bird from the mainland emu have previously been suggested to be the distal foramen of the tarsometatarsus, and the contour of the cranium. However, the distal foramen is known to be variable in the mainland emu showing particular diversity between juvenile and adult forms and is therefore taxonomically insignificant. The same <b>is</b> <b>true</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> contour of the cranium, which is more dome-shaped in the King Island emu, a feature that is also seen in juvenile mainland emus.|$|E

25|$|There {{are three}} forms of {{analgesia}} {{suitable for the}} treatment of pain in babies: paracetamol (acetaminophen), the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and the opioids. Paracetamol is safe and effective if given in the correct dosage. The same <b>is</b> <b>true</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as ibuprofen (aspirin is seldom used). Of the opioids, morphine and fentanyl are most often used in a hospital setting, while codeine is effective for use at home.|$|E
25|$|Because they {{innervate}} many muscles, some {{clusters of}} α-MNs receive {{high concentrations of}} neurotrophic factors and survive this stage of neuronal pruning. This <b>is</b> <b>true</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> α-MNs innervating {{the upper and lower}} limbs: these α-MNs form large cell columns that contribute to the cervical and lumbar enlargements of the spinal cord. In addition to receiving neurotrophic factors from muscles, α-MNs also secrete a number of trophic factors to support the muscle fibers they innervate. Reduced levels of trophic factors contributes to the muscle atrophy that follows an α-MN lesion.|$|E

25|$|When Sandoz {{returns to}} Earth, {{his friends are}} dead, and his faith, once {{considered}} worthy of actual canonization by his superiors, is merely an extension of his bitter anger with the God who sent him to Rakhat. Due to relativistic space-time effects, decades had passed while he has been gone, during which popular outrage at the UN's initial and highly out-of-context report on the mission, and especially Sandoz's role in the tragedy, had left the Society of Jesus shattered and nearly extinct. As Sandoz painfully explains what really happened, his personal healing begins, but only time will prove whether the same <b>is</b> <b>true</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Society of Jesus.|$|E
25|$|Early {{scientific}} thought often {{portrayed the}} universe as deterministic – for example in the thought of Democritus or the Cārvākans – and some thinkers claimed that the simple process of gathering sufficient information {{would allow them to}} predict future events with perfect accuracy. Modern science, on the other hand, is a mixture of deterministic and stochastic theories. Quantum mechanics predicts events only in terms of probabilities, casting doubt on whether the universe is deterministic at all, although evolution of the universal state vector is completely deterministic. Current physical theories cannot resolve the question of whether determinism <b>is</b> <b>true</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world, being very far from a potential Theory of Everything, and open to many different interpretations.|$|E
25|$|This {{explanation}} of Ubay {{also makes it}} very clear that the Companions did not differ at all about what was part of the Quran and what {{was not part of the}} Quran when the revelation had ceased. It is also important to note that the hadith appeared in the mushaf of Ubay because it was for his own personal use, in other words, his private notebook, where he did not always distinguish between Quranic material and hadith, since it was not meant for general use and he himself knew well what to make of his own notes. The same <b>is</b> <b>true</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other copies of the Quran, which some of the Companions had for their own personal use.|$|E
50|$|An unusual {{aspect of}} Operation Crossbow {{is that all}} the German characters, and the {{disguised}} Allied characters in their roles, speak (subtitled) German instead <b>of</b> accented English. <b>The</b> same <b>was</b> <b>true</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1962 film The Longest Day.|$|R

25|$|Some of {{the other}} printed commentaries which are {{attributed}} to Rashi were composed by others, primarily his students. In some commentaries, the text indicates that Rashi died before completing the tractate, {{and that it was}} completed by a student. This <b>is</b> <b>true</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tractate Makkot, the concluding portions of which were composed by his son-in-law, Rabbi Judah ben Nathan, and of the tractate Bava Batra, finished (in a more detailed style) by his grandson, the Rashbam. There is a legend that the commentary on Nedarim, which is clearly not his, was actually composed by his daughters. Another legend states that Rashi died while writing a commentary on Talmud, and that the very last word he wrote was 'tahor,' which means pure in Hebrew - indicating that his soul was pure as it left his body.|$|E
25|$|Unusually among basal sauropodomorphs, Xingxiulong {{has four}} sacral vertebrae. This is a trait {{typically}} seen in more derived sauropodomorphs, like Melanorosaurus, Leonerasaurus, Barapasaurus, and Shunosaurus. The {{first of these}} sacral vertebrae, the dorsosacral, is not very well-fused to the next sacral vertebra; neither is it entirely fused to the corresponding sacral rib on the transverse processes. Collectively, the dorsosacral and first pair of sacral ribs extend forward to contact the ilium. The second and third sacral vertebrae, the two primordial sacrals, {{are about the same}} length, and are well-fused to each other. Like other basal sauropodomorphs, the transverse processes of the third sacral vertebra project backwards and outwards. The same <b>is</b> <b>true</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> transverse process and sacral ribs for the fourth sacral vertebra, which contact the ilium again at the back. All of the neural spines are plate-like, like the last few dorsal vertebrae.|$|E
25|$|The {{paradox of}} thrift (or paradox of saving) is a paradox of economics. The paradox states that an {{increase}} in autonomous saving leads to a decrease in aggregate demand and thus a decrease in gross output which will in turn lower total saving. The paradox is, narrowly speaking, that total saving may fall because of individuals' attempts to increase their saving, and, broadly speaking, that increase in saving may be harmful to an economy. Both the narrow and broad claims are paradoxical within the assumption underlying the fallacy of composition, namely that what <b>is</b> <b>true</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> parts must be true of the whole. The narrow claim transparently contradicts this assumption, and the broad one does so by implication, because while individual thrift is generally averred {{to be good for}} the economy, the paradox of thrift holds that collective thrift may be bad for the economy.|$|E
5000|$|Abstraction {{attempts}} to prove properties {{on a system}} by first simplifying it. The simplified system usually does not satisfy exactly the same properties as the original one so that a process of refinement may be necessary. Generally, one requires the abstraction to be sound (the properties proved on <b>the</b> abstraction <b>are</b> <b>true</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original system); however, most often, the abstraction is not complete (not all <b>true</b> properties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original system <b>are</b> <b>true</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> abstraction). An example of abstraction is, on a program, to ignore <b>the</b> values <b>of</b> non boolean variables and to only consider boolean variables and <b>the</b> control flow <b>of</b> <b>the</b> program; such an abstraction, though it may appear coarse, {{may in fact be}} sufficient to prove e.g. properties of mutual exclusion.|$|R
60|$|Mr Sampson murmured {{that this}} was <b>the</b> sort <b>of</b> thing you might expect from one who had ever in her own family been an example and never an outrage.

500|$|Balzac's {{trademark}} realism {{begins on}} the first page of the novel, wherein Crevel is described wearing a National Guard uniform, complete with the Légion d'honneur. Details from the 1830s also appear in the novel's geographic locations. The Hulot family home, for example, is found in the aristocratic area of Paris known as the Faubourg Saint-Germain. Bette's residence is on {{the opposite end of the}} social spectrum, in the impoverished residential area which surrounded the Louvre: [...] "Les ténèbres, le silence, l'air glacial, la profondeur caverneuse du sol concourent à faire de ces maisons des espèces de cryptes, des tombeaux vivants." [...] ("Darkness, silence, an icy chill, and the cavernous depth of the soil combine to make these houses a kind of crypt, tombs of the living.") Descriptions of her meager quarters are– as usual in Balzac's work– an acute reflection of her personality. The same <b>is</b> <b>true</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Marneffe home at the outset: it contains [...] "les trompeuses apparences de ce faux luxe" [...] ("the illusory appearance of sham luxury"), from the shabby chairs in the drawing-room to the dust-coated bedroom.|$|E
