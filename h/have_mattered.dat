25|$|If in {{fact there}} was no third road wheel, the chariot might have functioned as a compass if turns were always made so {{that one of the}} two wheels was {{stationary}} and only the other rotated, with the pointing doll connected to it by gears. The charioteer could have kept the stationary wheel from turning by controlling the horses appropriately. (A brake would have helped, but {{there is no mention of}} one in the description.) The radius of the curve around which the rotating wheel moved would have equalled the track-width of the chariot, and the gears turning the doll would have been chosen accordingly. This design would have worked as a compass for short journeys, but would have suffered from cumulative errors if used for long ones. Also, the chariot would have been slow and awkward to turn. This might not <b>have</b> <b>mattered</b> if turns were rarely executed.|$|E

He knew of the [...] "Indian Star" [...] as an actor, more so probably because his romance with Suraiya was grabbing the headlines, and they had a chat. The second time they met was in Rome when Dev Anand was on his way back from the Venice Film Festival, he visited him on the set of Roman Holiday. [...] "I was returning from the Venice film fest. I stopped my car and joined the crowd watching the shoot, hoping that his eyes would fall on me. As expected, he nodded and I walked up to him. He remembered me and we exchanged pleasantries." [...] The third meeting was at London on the set of Moby Dick. However, Suraiya asked for an exclusive meeting with her idol at her house. Though Anand says jealousy was natural for anyone in love, he didn't mind that he was not invited. [...] "I didn't quite feel anything. It wasn't as if they were going to fall in love or make love. Even if they would have, it wouldn't <b>have</b> <b>mattered.</b> I was mature enough. Moreover, he wasn't my rival. I too was a big star by then," [...] says Anand.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the final}} of the 2011 U.S. Open against Samantha Stosur, Williams shouted [...] "Come on!" [...] as the Australian {{attempted}} to return a forehand Williams believed to be a winner. The chair umpire Eva Asderaki awarded the point to Stosur based on the USTA's deliberate hindrance rule, which states, [...] "If a player commits any act which hinders his opponent in making a stroke, then, if this is deliberate, he shall lose the point or if involuntary, the point shall be replayed." [...] As the point was 30–40 on Williams's serve, the penalty gave the break of serve to Stosur. Williams became angry with the chair umpire and made several gestures and unflattering comments toward her during the next changeover, including telling Asderaki that if she ever saw the umpire coming toward her, she should [...] "look the other way". Williams initially gained momentum in the set following the penalty, breaking back in the next game, but eventually flagged and lost the match, 2–6, 3–6. At the end of the match, she declined to offer the customary handshake to Asderaki. Williams mentioned the incident in her post-match speech as the tournament runner-up, claiming, [...] "I hit a winner, but I guess it didn't count," [...] but added, [...] "It wouldn't <b>have</b> <b>mattered</b> in the end. Sam played really well." [...] A writer for ESPN suggested that Williams could avoid being found to have violated the terms of the [...] "probation" [...] on which she was placed following her 2009 outburst, as she did not appear to have used profanity in addressing Asderaki during the match. In the end, Williams was fined $2,000 and was not barred from competing in the 2012 US Open because [...] "...Williams's conduct, while verbally abusive, [...] not {{rise to the level of}} a major offence under the Grand Slam code of conduct." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{a review}} of the film for the New York Post, critic Lou Lumenick rated Knight and Day with one and a half out of four stars. Lumenick wrote, [...] "this is a big, dumb summer movie with no {{apparent}} ambition other than plugging a hole in a studio’s schedule because its faded star happened to be available for a few weeks." [...] American film critic and professor Emanuel Levy was critical of the film's writing, calling it a [...] "mindless flick"; he noted, [...] "The story moves at a breakneck speed, as if to conceal the incongruities in the storytelling." [...] Levy gave the film a grade of [...] "C", and commented, [...] "Preposterously plotted, the saga is dominated by long, energetic, uneven action sequences, but it lacks any logic and pays minimal attention to characterization. Repetitious in structure, and with humor that more often than not misses the mark, 'Knight and Day' is characterized by nihilistic violence and amoral tone, which wouldn't <b>have</b> <b>mattered</b> had the movie been witty or fun to watch." [...] Simon Abrams of Slant Magazine gave the film a rating of two stars out of four, and commented of the film's director and writer, [...] "Clearly O'Neill and Mangold are trying to give viewers what producers would undoubtedly like to sell as 'something for everybody,' but there's no consistency to the thing and no chemistry whatsoever between Cruise and Diaz, making the alternating tug-of-war between girly and manly elements of the film seem extraordinarily forced." [...] In a review published in The Victoria Advocate, Robert Philpot of McClatchy Newspapers called the movie [...] "disposable", and singled out the film's script as its [...] "biggest problem", commenting that it [...] "feels lazy right from its lame-pun title". The Miami Herald film critic Rene Rodriguez wrote that there was [...] "no chemistry between Cruise and Diaz", and commented regarding Cruise's acting, [...] "Tom Cruise spends much of 'Knight and Day' looking as if he's waiting for someone to pour casting mold over his head to make an action figure." ...|$|E
2500|$|The regime {{shift that}} {{occurred}} in the 2006 election, however, can be traced to changes in popularity between the party - blocs prior to the campaign really started and to the timing of two extreme natural disasters that combined had a dramatic impact on the Swedish political landscape. In a dissertation from the Department of Government at Uppsala University, entitled [...] "Natural Disasters and National Election", PhD Lina M. Eriksson found in her research that the Indian Ocean’s 2004 Boxing Day Tsunami and 2005 Storm Gudrun (Erwin), which struck only two weeks following the tsunami, impacted on the 2006 historic regime shift {{that occurred in}} the 2006 Swedish parliamentary election. The results from this research show that the 2002-2006 incumbent Social Democratic Party's (S) poor crisis response to Gudrun, which is the hitherto most costly natural disaster in Swedish history, alone has an estimated effect of a magnitude that likely was crucial to the 2006 historic regime shift. In the abstract to the thesis one can read [...] "The 2002-2006 incumbent Social Democratic Party (S) received its lowest voter support since 1914 as roughly 150,000, or 8%, of the 2002 S voters went to the main opposition, the conservative Moderate Party (M). This became the most decisive factor in ousting S from power after 12 years of rule. As a result, the M-led Alliance (A) with the People's Party (FP), the Center Party (C), and the Christian Democrats (KD) won the election. Natural Disasters and National Election makes the novel contribution of proposing two natural disasters, the Indian Ocean’s 2004 Boxing Day Tsunami and 2005 Storm Gudrun (Erwin), which struck only two weeks following the tsunami, as major events that impacted government popularity in the 2006 election and contributed to the redistribution of voter support, within and across party-blocs. The core findings from this thesis show that the S government’s poor crisis response to Gudrun, which is the hitherto most costly natural disaster in Swedish history, alone has an estimated effect of a magnitude that likely contributed to the 2006 historic regime shift, while the tsunami also seems to <b>have</b> <b>mattered.</b> The tsunami is particularly interesting, as S’s poor international crisis response to the event constitutes the first natural disaster situation to knowingly have affected an election {{on the other side of}} the planet. Moreover, to some degree voters recognized the active opposition by C as effective representation and rewarded the party for its strong stance on the poor handling of both events by S. In fact, the active voice of C concerning these disasters likely helped move the party from the periphery of party politics to becoming the third-largest party in Swedish politics. In sum, this research investigates accountability and effective party representation via retrospective voting, which is an essential mechanism for the legitimacy of democracy. Findings suggest that the average Swedish voter indeed may be voting retrospectively to hold publicly elected officials accountable, which suggest a healthy status of the retrospective voting mechanism and Swedish democracy." [...] Part of the dissertation has also been published in Electoral Studies, which is to be considered the leading scientific journal in election research. In the article [...] long-term effects are also found over the 2010 and 2014 election, which implies that the Storm triggered long-lasting changes in voter support from the left to the right side of the political spectrum.
