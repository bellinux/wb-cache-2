40|$|This article {{analyses}} the {{determinants of}} <b>housing</b> <b>savings</b> (the contractual saving scheme) in Croatia by applying Vector Autoregression (VAR) methodology on monthly data for the period 2000 – 2013. The {{results show that the}} selected macroeconomic indicators (wages, interest rate, stock exchange index-CROBEX, availability of loans and unemployment rate) do not influence the <b>housing</b> <b>savings</b> market dynamics. Moreover, the <b>housing</b> <b>savings</b> system proves to be resilient to economic downturn. On the other hand, the findings are that the system primarily depends on government incentives (GI) (premiums), as confirmed by the intervention analysis. Each of the three interventions in the structure of incentives (reductions in 2005 and 2013 and the decision to freeze the payment of premiums for 2014) resulted in a significant {{decline in the number of}} new <b>housing</b> <b>savings</b> <b>contracts.</b> Since the findings differ from empirical research on determinants of private savings, this article emphasises that <b>housing</b> <b>savings</b> are a specific financial product, very sensitive to institutional changes. Therefore, frequent regulatory modifications, especially regarding government incentives, can easily destabilise the whole system...|$|R
40|$|We use a field {{experiment}} {{to test whether}} saving and borrowing satisfy demand for lump-sum accumulation from regular deposits. Inspired by ROSCAs, we offer different credit and <b>savings</b> <b>contracts</b> to subjects. We find that individuals often accept both credit and <b>saving</b> <b>contract</b> across experimental waves. This behaviour can be rationalised by assuming that individuals seek lump-sum payments and struggle to hold savings. Structural estimation of this model accounts for the behaviour of 75 % of participants. Of these, two-thirds have high demand for lump-sum accumulation but savings difficulties. These results imply that the distinction between microlending and microsaving is largely illusor...|$|R
40|$|Existing {{building}} energy retrofit {{is one of}} {{the keys}} of building energy efficiency in China. According to experience in developed countries, implementation of energy management contract (EMC) is crucial to promote existing building energy retrofit, which means that the reduction of energy expenditure is used to pay the retrofit cost. The EMC program has a short payback period, high interior return rate and remarkable energy savings. This paper present the specialties and difficulties of existing building energy conservation in China and the development, service items and commercial patterns of EMC. We discuss the main methods and ways that EMC is applied to existing building energy retrofit at the original stage of building energy efficiency by analyzing the difference of EMC and other traditional energy efficiency patterns. Based on the analysis of three commercial patterns of EMC including guaranteed <b>savings</b> <b>contract,</b> shared <b>savings</b> <b>contract</b> and chauffage contract, we propose that the guaranteed <b>savings</b> <b>contract</b> is the main development direction of building energy efficiency service in China. At the same time, new financing methods and energy-saving measurement and verification standards should be established to ensure that EMC {{plays an important role in}} the process of existing building energy retrofit in China...|$|R

40|$|Many {{opportunities}} {{exist for}} large-scale energy conservation projects in <b>housing.</b> Energy <b>savings</b> performance <b>contracting</b> (ESPC) is now receiving greater attention, {{as a means}} to implement such projects. This paper proposes an improved method for prior (to construction) savings estimates for these projects. The proposed approach to prior estimates is verified against data from Fort Polk, LA. In the course of evaluating the ESPC at Fort Polk, the authors have collected energy use data which allowed them to develop calibrated engineering models which accurately predict pre-retrofit energy consumption. They believe that such calibrated models could be used to provide much more accurate estimates of energy savings in retrofit projects. The improved savings estimating approach described here is based on an engineering model calibrated to field-collected data from the pre-retrofit period. A dynamic model of pre-retrofit energy use was developed for all housing and non-housing loads on a complete electrical feeder at Fort Polk. The model included the heat transfer characteristics of the buildings, the pre-retrofit air source heat pump, a hot water consumption model and a profile for electrical use by lights and other appliances. Energy consumption for all 200 apartments was totaled, and by adjusting thermostat setpoints and outdoor air infiltration parameters, the models were matched to field-collected energy consumption data for the entire feeder. The energy conservation measures were then implemented in the calibrated model: the air source heat pumps were replaced by geothermal heat pumps with desuperheaters; hot water loads were reduced to account for the low-flow shower heads; and lighting loads were reduced to account for fixture delamping and replacement with compact fluorescent lights. The analysis of pre- and post-retrofit data indicates that the retrofits have saved 30. 3 % of pre-retrofit electrical energy consumption on the feeder modeled in this paper...|$|R

40|$|Highway {{agencies}} {{around the}} world strive to improve practices for infrastructure maintenance and rehabilitation, using project delivery policies that range from total 'in-house' responsibility to complete privatization, {{with a number of}} flexible contracting policies such as performance-based contracting, variants of design-build-maintain, and lane rentals among others between these two extremes. In this paper, we present a methodology that duly accounts for underlying spatial effects and estimates the expected cost <b>savings</b> of innovative <b>contracting</b> policies for highway maintenance and rehabilitation relative to in-house execution of these activities. Spatial econometric modeling is used to analyze highway contract data from 49 countries. We also investigate the marginal effects of key explanatory variables on <b>contract</b> cost <b>savings</b> using spatial multipliers. Our findings show that there are significant relationships between cost <b>savings</b> and <b>contract</b> characteristics, and that there is an apparent direct relationship between the average cost <b>savings</b> of <b>contracts</b> in a country and <b>contract</b> average cost <b>savings</b> and <b>contract</b> sizes in neighboring countries.

It introduces the basic principle of building savings schemes, briefly describes their history, explains the basic concepts of building savings and also focuses on the relevant legislation.

The practical part of the thesis contains a statistical analysis and prognosis for building savings in the Czech Republic on the basis of selected indicators of building savings in the period 2009 - 2014. These selected indicators are newly concluded <b>contracts</b> on building <b>savings,</b> the average target amount for newly concluded building <b>savings</b> <b>contracts,</b> building <b>savings</b> <b>contracts</b> in the <b>saving</b> phase, the saved amount, the number of loans, the volume of loans and the ratio of the volume of loans and the saved amount.

Prognosis reveals the expected development of the indicators in the next year. In its conclusion, the thesis evaluates the status and development of the building savings market in the Czech Republic, assesses its prospects and estimates its further development...|$|R
