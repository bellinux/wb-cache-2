40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine the effects of {{operational}} and strategic <b>information</b> <b>exchange</b> on supply chain performance and the moderating role of information quality in relation to both operational and strategic <b>information</b> <b>exchange.</b> The study was conducted using manufacturing companies located in the Northern region of Malaysia. Hierarchical multiple regressions were applied to test the hypotheses developed for the study. It was found that operational and strategic <b>information</b> <b>exchange</b> is significantly related to supply chain performance. The impact of strategic <b>information</b> <b>exchange</b> is greater as opposed to operational <b>information</b> <b>exchange.</b> <b>Information</b> quality does not moderate the relationship between both operational and strategic <b>information</b> <b>exchange</b> and supply chain performance. Nonetheless, this study provides evidence that both strategic <b>information</b> <b>exchange</b> and operational <b>information</b> <b>exchange</b> are required to enhance supply chain performance. As such supply chain partners should effectively <b>exchange</b> strategic <b>information</b> as the impact is greater on performance. <b>Information</b> <b>exchange,</b> <b>information</b> quality, operational information, strategic information, supply chain, performance...|$|R

25|$|As human {{societies}} emerged, {{the development of}} writing was driven by pragmatic exigencies such as <b>exchanging</b> <b>information,</b> maintaining financial accounts, codifying laws and recording history. Around the 4th millennium BCE, the complexity of trade and administration in Mesopotamia outgrew human memory, and writing became a more dependable method of recording and presenting transactions in a permanent form. In both ancient Egypt and Mesoamerica, writing may have evolved through calendric and a political necessity for recording historical and environmental events.|$|E

RN aviation fuel lines were purged with carbon dioxide when not in use. The USN used a similar system, which was further improved after the two navies began <b>exchanging</b> <b>information</b> in 1940. Pre-war USN and IJN carrier designs used a fuel stowage system which was not as secure as that used by the RN, but allowed for much greater stowage capacity.

The project has currently reanalyzed storms from the period 1886 to 1955, and has extended HURDAT back to 1851. In 2001, data for the years 18511885 {{were added to the}} official database from the Fernández-Partagás series of publications. Also, a paleotempestology conference was held at the University of South Carolina which proposed to increase the scope of HURDAT from a starting year of 1851 to a start of 1800. [...] The conference also discussed ways of <b>exchanging</b> <b>information</b> for the inclusion of older tropical cyclones, such as via compact disc or a Wikipedia-style website. While the reanalysis has mostly proceeded sequentially, notable exceptions have been made for the reanalysis of some significant tropical cyclones. In 2002, for the tenth anniversary of Hurricane Andrew, the reanalysis was completed for the hurricane, which upgraded the cyclone to a Category 5 hurricane. In 2014, a similar reanalysis was completed for Hurricane Camille.|$|E

[...] She asserts that a fundamental aspect of British soap is the idea of supporting members of community, based on the sharing of intimate knowledge, allowing [...] "practical and emotional needs to be met" [...] within the enclosed community. However, according to Geraghty, there is nevertheless [...] "an unease about the price paid for such support and an acknowledgement of the fine-line between neighbourliness and nosiness. The 'gossip' personifies this unease and though her task of passing on information and ferreting out problems is crucial to the community, she [...] is frequently the butt of mockery and criticism [...] The avidity with which Dot Cotton seeks out news is the subject of some embarrassment to her more restrained neighbours but the exchange of information she provides is essential if the community is to provide support to its members [...] the very process of <b>exchanging</b> <b>information</b> makes her an essential yet mistrusted figure." ...|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} the transfer and <b>exchange</b> <b>information</b> between a single qubit system excited by a rectangular pulse. The {{dynamics of the}} system is treated within and outside rotating wave approximation (RWA). The initial state of the qubit plays an important role for sending information with high fidelity. Within RWA, and as the fidelity of the transformed <b>information</b> increases the <b>exchange</b> <b>information</b> with the environment increases. For increasing values of atomic detuning, the fidelity decreases faster and the <b>exchange</b> <b>information</b> has an upper limit. Outside RWA,the fidelity of the transformed information increases as one increases the perturbation parameter. However the <b>exchange</b> <b>information</b> is very high compared with that within RWA. The orthogonality speed of the travelling qubit is investigated for different classes of initial atomic state settings and field parameters.

2500|$|In 2005, the Office of Fair Trading found fifty {{independent}} schools, including Eton, to have breached the Competition Act by [...] "regularly and systematically" [...] <b>exchanging</b> <b>information</b> about planned {{increases in}} school fees, which was collated and distributed among the schools by the bursar at Sevenoaks School. Following the {{investigation by the}} OFT, each school was required to pay around £70,000, totalling around £3.5 million, significantly less than the maximum possible fine. In addition, the schools together agreed to contribute another £3m to a new charitable educational fund. The incident raised concerns over whether the charitable status of independent schools such as Eton should be reconsidered, and perhaps revoked. However, Jean Scott, {{the head of the}} Independent Schools Council, said the schools were following a long-established procedure in sharing the information with each other because independent schools were previously exempt from anti-cartel rules applied to business and that they were unaware of the change to the law (on which they had not been consulted). She wrote to John Vickers, the OFT director-general, saying, [...] "They are not a group of businessmen meeting behind closed doors to fix the price of their products to the disadvantage of the consumer. They are schools that have quite openly continued to follow a long-established practice because they were unaware that the law had changed." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{idea of the}} Luxembourg Summit {{was further}} {{elaborated}} at the European Council in Maastricht on 9–10 December 1991, a meeting to draft the Maastricht Treaty. The European Council agreed to create [...] "a European police office (Europol) the initial function {{of which would be}} to organize exchange of information on narcotic drugs". The Council likewise instructed TREVI ministers to take measures in setting up the office. On 7 February 1992, Europol was enshrined with more substance in Article K.1, section 9, as the Maastricht Treaty was signed: Member States shall regard the following areas as matters of common interest: [...] police cooperation for the purposes of preventing and combatting terrorism, unlawful drug trafficking and other serious forms of international crime, including if necessary certain aspects of customs cooperation, in connection with the organization of a Union-wide system for <b>exchanging</b> <b>information</b> within a European Police Office (Europol).Europol was first de facto organised provisionally in 1993 as the Europol Drugs Unit (EDU) in Strasbourg at the same site as the Schengen Information System was hosted. The small initial group started operations there in January 1994 under the leadership of Jürgen Storbeck and with a mandate to assist national police forces in criminal investigations. The competition for the permanent site of Europol during the period was between The Hague, Rome and Strasbourg—the European Council decided on 29 October 1993 that Europol should be established in The Hague. A former Catholic boys school built in 1910 at Raamweg 47 was chosen as the precise location. The house was used in World War II by police and intelligence agencies and after the War manned by the Dutch State Intelligence Service until Europol relocated there later in 1994.|$|E
