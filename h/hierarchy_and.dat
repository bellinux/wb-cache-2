5|$|The low status of—and {{subsequent}} discrimination against—women in India can {{be attributed}} to many cultural norms. Societal forces of patriarchy, <b>hierarchy</b> <b>and</b> multigenerational families contribute to Indian gender roles. Men use greater privileges and superior rights to create an unequal society that leaves women with little to no power. This societal structure is exemplified with women’s low participation within India’s national parliament and the labour force.|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn many {{clustering}} systems (<b>hierarchies,</b> pyramids <b>and</b> {{more generally}} weak hierarchies) clusters are generated by two elements only. This paper {{is devoted to}} such clustering systems (called binary clustering systems). It provides some basic properties, links with (closed) weak <b>hierarchies</b> <b>and</b> some qualitative versions of bijection theorems that occur in Numerical Taxonomy. Moreover, a way to associate a binary clustering system to every clustering system is discussed. Finally, introducing the notion of weak ultrametrics, a bijection between indexed weak <b>hierarchies</b> <b>and</b> weak ultrametrics is obtained (the standard theorem involves closed weak <b>hierarchies</b> <b>and</b> quasi-ultrametrics) ...|$|R
40|$|Most {{object-oriented}} {{programs have}} imperfectly designed inheritance <b>hierarchies</b> <b>and</b> imperfectly factored methods, and these imperfections tend to increase with maintenance. Hence, even objectoriented programs {{are more expensive}} to maintain, harder to understand and larger than necessary. Automatic restructuring of inheritance <b>hierarchies</b> <b>and</b> refactoring of methods can improve the design of inheritance <b>hierarchies,</b> <b>and</b> the factoring of methods. This results in programs being smaller, having better code re-use and being more consistent. This paper describes Guru, a prototype tool for automatic inheritance <b>hierarchy</b> restructuring <b>and</b> method refactoring of Self programs. Results from realistic applications of the tool are presented. 1 Introduction Factoring shared methods into classes and shared code into methods allows systems to be compact and improves consistency, making them more easily understood and less expensive to maintain.

40|$|We {{introduce}} the base architecture of a software library which combines graphs, <b>hierarchies,</b> <b>and</b> views and describes {{the interactions between}} them. Each graph may have arbitrarily many <b>hierarchies</b> <b>and</b> each <b>hierarchy</b> may have arbitrarily many views. Both the <b>hierarchies</b> <b>and</b> the views can be added and removed dynamically from the corresponding graph <b>and</b> <b>hierarchy,</b> respectively. The software library shall serve as a platform for algorithms and data structures on hierarchically structured graphs. Such graphs become increasingly important and occur in special applications, e. g., call graphs in software engineering or biochemical pathways, with a particular need to manipulate and draw graphs...|$|R

5|$|A typical Robinsonade– a {{genre of}} fiction {{inspired}} by Daniel Defoe's Robinson Crusoe– {{and one of}} the most popular of its type, the book first went on sale in late 1857 and has never been out of print. Among the novel's major themes are the civilising effect of Christianity, 19th-century British imperialism in the South Pacific, and the importance of <b>hierarchy</b> <b>and</b> leadership. It was the inspiration for William Golding's dystopian novel Lord of the Flies (1954), which inverted the morality of The Coral Island; in Ballantyne's story the children encounter evil, but in Lord of the Flies evil is within them.|$|E
5|$|Although Liverpool {{regained the}} {{championship}} a year later, the club's dominance waned. In February 1991, Dalglish resigned as Liverpool manager after an FA Cup replay against Merseyside rivals Everton, citing stress {{as the principal}} cause. His successor, Graeme Souness, struggled to sustain the club's success with a conservative <b>hierarchy</b> <b>and</b> ageing squad, despite investing in youth players. Liverpool throughout the 1990s and 2000s declined as a league force and as of 2017, have not been crowned as top-flight champions.|$|E

5|$|By {{contrast}} with the tensions in England, in Normandy Henry had occasional disagreements with the Church but generally enjoyed very {{good relations with the}} Norman bishops. In Brittany, Henry had the support of the local church <b>hierarchy</b> <b>and</b> rarely intervened in clerical matters, except occasionally in order to cause difficulties for his rival Louis of France. Further south, however, the power of the dukes of Aquitaine over the local church was much less than in the north, and Henry's efforts to extend his influence over local appointments created tensions. During the disputed papal election of 1159, Henry, like Louis, supported Alexander III over his rival Victor IV.|$|E

5|$|Social <b>hierarchy</b> <b>and</b> tapu (sacred matters) in the Cook Islands was {{controlled}} by ariki (high chiefs), with typically between three and six per island. Each ariki was a ruler of an ivi or ngati (tribe). Lesser noble ranks in the social hierarchy were the mataiapo and rangatira (minor chiefs). The chief's control, which could neither be gained or lost, was established by his mana (power), which derived from his birth, achievements and status. However, an ariki with declining popularity could be perceived to be lacking in mana, which {{might lead to a}} loss of social control.|$|E

Montecito, with a 90nm process, allowed for a dual-core implementation and a major improvement in performance per watt.

5|$|The Moravian {{cultural}} influence {{played a}} significant role in the spread of Christianity onto the Polish lands and the subsequent adoption of that religion. In the opinion of Davies, the Christianisation of Poland through the Czech–Polish alliance represented a conscious choice on the part of Polish rulers to ally themselves with the Czech state rather than the German one. In a similar fashion, some of the later political struggles involved the Polish Church refusing to subordinate itself to the German <b>hierarchy</b> <b>and</b> instead being directly subordinate to the Vatican.|$|E

5|$|Throughout {{the period}} of {{absolute}} monarchy, from 1782 to 1932, the Grand Palace was both the country's administrative and religious centre. As the main residence of the monarch, the palace was also the seat of government, with thousands of inhabitants including guardsmen, servants, concubines, princesses, ministers and courtiers. The palace's high whitewashed castellated walls and extensive forts and guard posts mirrored those of the walls of Bangkok itself, and thus the Grand Palace was envisioned as a city within a city. For this reason a special set of Palace Laws were created to govern the inhabitants and to establish <b>hierarchy</b> <b>and</b> order.|$|E

5|$|Various {{evolutionary}} ideas {{had already}} been proposed to explain new findings in biology. There was growing support for such ideas among dissident anatomists and the general public, but {{during the first half}} of the 19th century the English scientific establishment was closely tied to the Church of England, while science was part of natural theology. Ideas about the transmutation of species were controversial as they conflicted with the beliefs that species were unchanging parts of a designed <b>hierarchy</b> <b>and</b> that humans were unique, unrelated to other animals. The political and theological implications were intensely debated, but transmutation was not accepted by the scientific mainstream.|$|E
5|$|Amonkhet has The Gatewatch set out {{to destroy}} the evil dragon planeswalker Nicol Bolas after {{learning}} of his dominion over the titular desert plane Amonkhet. In the desert, they find a city (Naktamun) teeming with food, water, and life, ruled by five gods, with Bolas seemingly absent altogether. The people of Naktamun train their entire lives to die in ritual combat, hoping to experience pure bliss in the afterlife when the God-Pharaoh (Bolas) returns to Amonkhet. In Hour of Devastation, Bolas returns as prophesied, only to raze Naktamun and reveal the true purpose of the training and combat: to create an army of physically-perfect and combat-adept mummies {{to serve as an}} unquestionably loyal army.

5|$|Another issue arose when Cardinal Norman Gilroy {{presented}} Heffron in September 1962 with a {{plan for}} State aid to Catholic Church schools, including assistance for teacher salaries and capital grants for buildings, an issue that was highly explosive in the sectarian politics of New South Wales at the time. Heffron, alive {{to the need for}} a limited form of state support to placate sectarian conflict that could destroy the government, permitted Treasurer Jack Renshaw to include state support for school laboratories and a means-tested allowance to school students in the 1963 budget. Heffron later dropped the school laboratory provision but his permitting of the means-tested allowance provoked condemnation from the Federal Party Executive in Adelaide on 30 September 1962, who were less interested in placating the traditional Catholic <b>hierarchy</b> <b>and</b> more informed by the bitterness of the earlier ALP/DLP split in the party in 1955. Heffron and Renshaw backed down on this last provision, leaving no state aid for Catholic schools, and affirming the dominance of the Federal party in such matters.|$|E
