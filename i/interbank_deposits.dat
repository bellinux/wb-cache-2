50|$|Thus, {{under the}} {{proposed}} arrangement, the banks would need only $3,7 billions of new cash or Government bonds {{to satisfy a}} 100% reserve requirement. We could, therefore, today introduce the 100% reserve system and stabilize our banking situation, without causing any very disturbing changes in bank earnings from interest on federal bonds. While, under the plan proposed, those new funds would be distributed among banks automatically, as needed, to raise reserves, in practice almost three-fourths of the required new money would be needed at this time by the large banks in New York City, which function as the “Bankers' banks” for the small country banks. For New York State alone “interbank deposits” exceeded “interbank balances” by $2,8 billions (December 31, 1938). A similar situation exists in the large banks {{in the rest of}} the country. The problem is thus largely one of putting <b>interbank</b> <b>deposits</b> on a 100% reserve basis. The Federal Reserve Board has repeatedly considered taking this step, and it has often been discussed, particularly early in 1939.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{tests for}} the {{existence}} of a lending channel in the transmission of monetary policy in Brazil using aggregate monthly data for the period 1995 : 12 through 2008 : 6. The test is carried out in a VECM setting that allows for multiple cointegrating relationships among the variable of interest. We find evidence of two cointegrating vectors, which we identify as loan demand and supply functions by testing for a number of exclusion and exogeneity restrictions on the cointegrating relationships. Loan supply is found to be negatively related to the <b>interbank</b> <b>deposit</b> certificate rate, suggesting the existence of a lending channel for monetary transmission. The VECM's short-term dynamics show that loan demand is equilibrium-correcting. But short-term disequilibria in the supply of loans are corrected through changes in the <b>interbank</b> <b>deposit</b> certificate rate, suggesting that monetary policy plays a role in restoring equilibrium in the credit market by affecting the borrowing rate faced by banks to raise non-deposit funds.

30|$|The control {{variables}} show some interesting results. SIZE presents negative and significant coefficients; consequently larger banks pay {{lower interest rates}} on deposits (in favor of the implicit “too-big-to-fail” policy). LOAN presents some positive and significant coefficients, that is, there is a demand effect determining interest rates on deposits, as proposed by Ben-David et al. (2013). EXPOSURE enters with positive signs and significance; therefore, a higher exposure to the <b>interbank</b> <b>deposit</b> market corresponds to a higher interest rate on deposits. CETES presents positive signs and significance, predictably, because of the natural relationship between IIRDE and CETES (see Fig.  1). The time dummies show some positive and significant coefficients, surprisingly, because IIRDE shows a negative trend {{during the period of}} analysis (see Fig.  2 in the appendix).

While {{there is evidence of}} a role played by credit risk, at least at lower frequencies, the absence of a close relationship between the risk of default and risk premia in the money market, as well as the reaction of the interbank markets to central bank liquidity provisions, point to the importance of liquidity factors for banks' day-to-day quoting behaviour. ...|$|E
30|$|The CAMEL {{variables}} {{are included in}} the model taking into account collinearity among them, and with Z SCORE. SIZE is controlling bank size.

The reference interest rate CETES controls a possible influence of the monetary authority on the market, and other systemic risks. BANK is a dummy variable for each type of bank (G 7, Commercial, Retail and Investment), where the G 7 is the reference group, thus the model controls for other bank characteristics and markets. T is a dummy variable for years controlling effects of unspecified macroeconomic and financial market conditions, which are assumed to be constant across banks.|$|R
40|$|Building Risk-Neutral Density (RND) from options data is one useful way for extracting market {{expectations}} about a financial variable.

Our in-sample goodness-of-fit evaluation shows that the Mixture of Log-Normals method provides better fitting to option’s data {{than the other two}} methods. The shape of log-normal distributions seems to fit well to the mean-reversal dynamics of Brazilian interest rates.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the responsiveness of external bank liabilities to deposit insurance policies for {{a sample of}} developed countries. External bank liabilities held by non-banks are found to increase after the introduction of explicit deposit insurance.

The equilibrium probability of bank failure is uniquely determined. We explore how the cross holding of deposits motivated by imperfectly correlated regional liquidity shocks {{can lead to}} contagious effects conditional on {{the failure of a}} financial institution. We show that contagion is possible in the unique equilibrium of the economy and characterize exactly when it may exist. At the same time, we identify a direction of flow for contagious effects, which provides a rationale for localized financial panics. Simulations identify the optimal level of <b>interbank</b> <b>deposit</b> holdings in the presence of contagion risk. Our results suggest that when the probability of bank failure is low, maximal levels of interbank holdings are optimal. When cross holding of deposits is complete, we demonstrate that the intensity of contagion is increasing in the size of regionally aggregate liquidity shocks. ...|$|R
40|$|In 1979, Italy {{entered into}} the Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) as a {{founding}} member of the European Monetary System. After that date, the country’s monetary policy was geared toward the maintenance of exchange rate stability against its ERM partners, despite a number of exchange parity realignments and with the exception of the period from September 1992 to November 1996. 1 The strength of the ERM commitment was not uniform over time, either in terms of amplitude of the fluctuation band 2 or in terms of frequency of realignment of bilateral parities. Despite this variability, however, changes in official rates—the discount rate and the rate on fixed term advances—were overwhelmingly linked throughout the ERM period to developments in foreign exchange markets. The broad exchange-rate stability objective was made operational as a target range for the overnight <b>interbank</b> <b>deposit</b> rate.

The aim of the analysis is to determine, in a quantitative way, how efficient this market is. Besides a comprehensive descriptive analysis, the approach used defines {{a measure of the}} friction arising for each single transaction, by which we understand an (small) initial loss accepted by a counterparty, and the corresponding gain made by the other counterparty. The evolution of total daily frictions is then put into perspective comparing it with the frictions arising if flows corresponded to the optimal solution of a “cash transportation problem”. The main conclusions of this exercise are that overall frictions, although small in absolute size, tend to increase strongly whenever the overnight rate becomes volatile. Some tentative explanations for this are given, relying on the introduced methodology.

Using data for 207 banks across 10 Central and Eastern European countries, this paper empirically analyzes the disciplining role of <b>interbank</b> <b>deposits.</b> We find that market discipline has been effective in Central and Eastern Europe since the implementation of explicit deposit insurance. However, several factors affect the strength of this discipline. State-owned banks are not disciplined probably because they benefit from implicit insurance. Institutional and legal factors, and resolution strategies adopted by countries during banking crises also impact bank risk and the effectiveness of market discipline.

40|$|Based on the {{decision}} of the Monetary Council of 6 September 2010, the MNB began publishing its HUF liquidity forecast. The central bank has been preparing forecasts on the liquidity of the banking system for internal use for a long time, but from now on it will share these with market participants on a weekly basis, before the MNB bond auction on Tuesday. With this publication, the central bank tries to ensure – by supporting the liquidity planning of credit institutions – that the volume of the base instrument, the two-week MNB bond is as close to the ideal quantity as possible, i. e. to reduce the reliance of participants on the availability of the overnight loans and deposits of the central bank. The latter may divert the market interest rates from the level close to the base rate of the central bank. Publication may also reduce the uncertainty of liquidity managers in the banking system and encourage them to use the interbank markets more actively. The MNB’s information advantage, which {{is the result of the}} existing institutional relations and the greater resources than those of the market actors, is another factor supporting the publication of the forecast. Although the central bank’s forecast cannot project the HUF liquidity of the banking system accurately, it still contains a considerable amount of additional information for credit institutions.
