The ell consists of four rooms as well as the kitchen and smokehouse. The smokehouse was built as part of the existing structure, and not free standing as is most often seen. The rear ell structure served as the first residence for the family while the primary residence was constructed. To the east of the house is the family burial ground. Behind the house is a <b>flower</b> <b>garden.</b> The slave cemetery lies beyond the <b>flower</b> <b>garden.</b> Documented but no longer existing buildings include multiple slave houses, a large stable due-west of the mansion, an ash house, and a garden house.|$|E

5|$|In Hindu mythology, Parvati, wife of Shiva, once {{closed the}} eyes of her husband playfully in a <b>flower</b> <b>garden</b> at their abode atop Mount Kailash. Although only a moment for the gods, all light {{was taken from the}} universe, and the earth, in turn, was {{submerged}} in darkness for years. Parvati performed penance along with other devotees of Shiva. Then her husband appeared as a column of fire at the top of Annamalai hills, returning light to the world. He then merged with Parvati to form Ardhanarishvara, the half-female, half-male form of Shiva. The Annamalai, or red mountain, lies behind the Annamalaiyar temple, and is associated with the temple of its namesake. The hill is sacred and considered a lingam, or iconic representation of Shiva, in itself.|$|E
5|$|After the Japanese {{occupied}} the Indies in early 1942, Oerip {{was held in}} a mixed prisoner of war camp in Cimahi. Upon his release {{three and a half}} months later, Oerip refused an offer to form a new, Japanese-backed police force and returned to KEM, where he and his wife rented paddy fields to grow rice while continuing to operate their <b>flower</b> <b>garden.</b> To protect their land, they surrounded their property and home with a high bamboo fence. Although no longer active in the military, Oerip occasionally received former KNIL members, including Abdul Haris Nasution and Sunarmo, who brought news of events outside the village. The couple continued their work, harassed and surveilled by the Japanese and pro-Japanese Indonesians, until the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in early August 1945 signified that Japan would soon withdraw. It was during this period that Oerip began having heart problems.|$|E

5|$|His most {{significant}} influence was {{the introduction of}} the idea of wild gardening, which first appeared in The Wild Garden and was further developed in The English <b>Flower</b> <b>Garden.</b> The idea of introducing large drifts of native hardy perennial plants into meadow, woodand, and waterside is taken for granted today, but was revolutionary in Robinson's time. In the first edition, he happily used any plant that could be naturalised, including half-hardy perennials and natives {{from other parts of the}} world—thus Robinson's wild garden was not limited to locally native species. Robinson's own garden at Gravetye was planted on a large scale, but his wild garden idea could be realised in small yards, where the 'garden' is designed to appear to merge into the surrounding woodland or meadow. Robinson's ideas continue to influence gardeners and landscape architects today—from home and cottage gardens to large estate and public gardens.|$|E

25|$|The {{earliest}} {{illustration of}} Lophospermum erubescens appeared in 1830 in The British <b>Flower</b> <b>Garden.</b> The plant {{was at first}} identified as the already known Lophospermum scandens and labelled as such. David Don later {{realized that it was}} a new species, and corrected the error in a subsequent note in The British <b>Flower</b> <b>Garden,</b> describing the illustrated plant as a new species, L.erubescens. Don did not explain the origin of the specific epithet, but erubescens means reddening or blushing in Latin. Don's correction was not always noticed, with the result that the name L.scandens became associated with the illustration of L.erubescens, creating confusion between the two species.|$|E

25|$|Although most burials {{initially}} occurred {{near the}} freedmen's cemetery {{in the northeast}} corner of the estate, Meigs ordered in mid-June 1864 that burials commence immediately on the grounds of Arlington House. The first officer burial had occurred next to the main <b>flower</b> <b>garden</b> on May 17, but with Meigs' order another 44 officers were buried along the southern and eastern sides of this area within a month. In December 1865, Robert E. Lee's brother, Sydney Smith Lee, visited Arlington House and observed that the house could be made livable again if the graves around the <b>flower</b> <b>garden</b> were removed. Meigs hated Lee for betraying the Union, and ordered that more burials occur near the house {{in order to make it}} politically impossible for disinterment to occur.|$|E
