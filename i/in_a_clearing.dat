5|$|Founded at {{the start}} of the Second Industrial Revolution, Harrisburg was plotted shortly after Saline County was {{established}} in 1847 from part of Gallatin County. The city was named for James Alexander Harris, who had built a farmhouse and planted a corn field <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>clearing</b> in the area of the current city square around 1820.|$|E
5|$|From {{his base}} in Tel Aviv, Holocaust {{survivor}} Emmanuel Lieber directs {{a group of}} Jewish Nazi hunters in search of Adolf Hitler. Lieber believes that the former Führer is still alive, and following rumours and hearsay, he tracks Hitler's movements through South America. After months of wading through swamps in the Amazon jungle, the search party finds the 90-year-old alive <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>clearing.</b> Lieber flies to San Cristóbal where he awaits the group's return with their captive. But getting the old man out of the jungle alive is more difficult than getting in, and their progress is further hampered by heavy thunderstorms.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} Sheffield, {{a city in}} South Yorkshire, England, {{can be traced back}} to the {{founding}} of a settlement <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>clearing</b> beside the River Sheaf in the second half of the 1st millennium AD. The area now known as Sheffield had seen human occupation since at least the last ice age, but significant growth in the settlements that are now incorporated into the city did not occur until the Industrial Revolution.|$|E

5|$|The name Sheffield is Old English in origin. It {{derives from}} the River Sheaf, whose name is a {{corruption}} of shed or sheth, meaning to divide or separate. Field is a generic suffix deriving from the Old English feld, meaning a forest clearing. It is likely then that {{the origin of the}} present-day city of Sheffield is an Anglo-Saxon settlement <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>clearing</b> beside the confluence of the rivers Sheaf and Don founded between the arrival of the Anglo-Saxons in this region (roughly the 6th century) and the early 9th century.|$|E
5|$|As with Seasons, the Triforce {{calls out}} to Link. Link is transported to a forest {{in the land of}} Labrynna, where he hears screaming. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>clearing,</b> Link finds a woman encircled by monsters. When the monsters see Link, they scatter in all directions. The woman is Princess Zelda's nurse, Impa, who asks Link to help her find a singer in the forest. Continuing through the forest, the two find Nayru, a young woman with blue hair singing on a tree stump, {{surrounded}} by forest creatures. A shadow emerges from Impa and reveals itself as Veran, Sorceress of Shadows. Veran soars into Nayru's body and possesses her. Nayru was the Oracle of Ages; her abduction causes a disruption in the time flow of Labrynna.|$|E
5|$|Bayside: The dark, bearded Peter Fisk {{walks along}} the wooded paths {{of the island}} until {{reaching}} a beach. He strips and sunbathes on a blanket. Suddenly, out in the water, the blond naked Donovan appears and runs up onto the beach to Fisk. Fisk performs oral sex on Donovan, who then leads Fisk into the woods. Fisk grabs the blanket and follows, catching up to Donovan <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>clearing.</b> They kiss and touch each other, then Donovan takes a studded leather strap from Fisk's wrist and attaches it around Fisk's genitalia. They continue the scene, with each performing oral sex on the other and Donovan penetrating Fisk. Following Donovan's climax he returns to servicing Fisk orally and, as Fisk is climaxing, momentary flashes of previous scenes are intercut. The scene ends with Fisk taking the strap from his genitals and attaching it around Donovan's wrist. Fisk runs into the ocean and vanishes, mirroring Donovan's entrance. Donovan dons Fisk's abandoned clothes and heads off down the beach.|$|E

5|$|The dwarfs {{return to}} their cottage and find Snow White {{seemingly}} dead, being kept in a deathlike slumber by the poison. Unwilling to bury her {{out of sight in}} the ground, they instead place her in a glass coffin trimmed with gold <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>clearing</b> in the forest. Together with the woodland creatures, they keep watch over her. A year later, a prince, who had previously met and fallen in love with Snow White, learns of her eternal sleep and visits her coffin. Saddened by her apparent death, he kisses her, which breaks the spell and awakens her. The dwarfs and animals all rejoice as the Prince takes Snow White to his castle.|$|E
5|$|Leonard Nimoy {{begins the}} episode hosting {{a show about}} alien {{encounter}}s. He talks about an encounter in a town called Springfield. At Moe's on a Friday night, a drunk Homer is forced to walk home, but takes a wrong path and {{ends up in the}} woods. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>clearing,</b> he sees a glowing, thin-boned alien. Homer panics and runs home screaming. The rest of the family do not believe Homer's story and his attempts to report the alien sighting to police are dismissed. Agents Fox Mulder and Dana Scully of the FBI hear of the sighting and go to investigate. After receiving no results from their psychological tests of him, Homer fails to provide any proof that he actually saw an alien. Homer is ridiculed by most of the neighborhood; even Marge refuses to believe in his claims, but Bart admits he believes Homer. The next Friday night, the pair camp out in the forest. The alien arrives and promises peace, but Homer scares it away when he accidentally steps on their camp fire and screams in pain. Fortunately, Bart captures the entire incident on tape.|$|E

25|$|On 5 January 1967, the ten men of Team Cobra boarded Air America Sikorsky H-34 helicopters. The {{defector}} accompanied them. They {{were dropped}} <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>clearing</b> two days walk from Ban Naden. In {{the early morning}} hours of 7 January, they crept down a creek bed toward the prison camp. Although triple canopy jungle hindered aerial observation, the ground team could see a pair of cave mouths at the base of a 500-meter cliff face. As the cave entrances were six meters across, about 20 prisoners could be seen penned behind each set of bamboo bars. Two bamboo huts stood before the cave mouths. There were also holding cells sunken in the ground.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Henry {{is taken}} by Greg and Tamara through the jungle. Henry points out their unfounded trust in Peter Pan, a {{statement}} which begins to worry {{them when they}} discover the walkie-talkie they use {{to communicate with the}} Home Office is filled with sand. The Lost Boys soon find them, and reveal themselves to be the Home Office Greg and Tamara worked for, much to their displeasure. The leader of the Lost Boys, Felix, reveals that the plan was never to destroy magic, and that Greg and Tamara aren't meant to return to their world. The Shadow arrives and rips Greg's shadow from his body when he refuses to hand over Henry, and Tamara is shot with an arrow. Henry flees in the confusion, and is taken aside by a fellow runaway. The runaway reveals that he was a former Lost Boy, and stole pixie dust from Pan, hoping to escape from Neverland. However, he cannot make himself fly with it. Gold arrives {{at the scene of the}} skirmish, and finds Tamara still alive. She tells him that Henry ran, and that she and Greg had no idea that they were working for Pan. She also apologizes about Neal, but Gold crushes her heart. He and Felix meet <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>clearing,</b> with Felix welcoming Gold but warning him that if he is in Neverland for Henry, that makes him Pan's enemy. Rumpelstiltskin remarks that nothing has changed, and scoffs at the idea of his survival, only wanting to take down as many Lost Boys as he can before he dies. Felix responds by leaving behind a doll of a child, which reduces Rumpelstiltskin to tears.|$|E

It was built <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>clearing</b> surrounded by old-growth forest {{with a view}} to the lake [...] to the east. In 1913 a -story wing was added to {{the north side of the}} house and the original structure was renovated. The house has twenty-eight rooms, four porches, and its original hardware and woodwork. Dormers and some windows were added in the renovation, and electrical wiring and modern plumbing have been added since. According to the NRHP nomination form, the Clemuel Ricketts Mansion [...] "is a stunning example of Georgian vernacular architecture".|$|E
