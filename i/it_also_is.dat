5|$|Burns and Rigby {{found several}} prototiles, {{including}} the Koch snowflake, {{that may be}} used to tile the plane only by using copies of the prototile in two or more different sizes. An earlier paper by Danzer, Grünbaum, and Shephard provides another example, a convex pentagon that tiles the plane only when combined in two sizes. Although the Pythagorean tiling uses two different sizes of squares, the square does not have the same property as these prototiles of only tiling by similarity, because <b>it</b> <b>also</b> <b>is</b> possible to tile the plane using only squares of a single size.|$|E

5|$|It is {{possible}} that Æthelberht was converted to Christianity before Augustine's arrival. Æthelberht's wife was a Christian and brought a Frankish bishop with her, to attend her at court, so Æthelberht would have had knowledge of Christianity before the mission reached Kent. <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>is</b> possible that Bede had the date of Æthelberht's death wrong; if, in fact, Æthelberht died in 618, this {{would be consistent with}} his baptism in 597, which is in accord with the tradition that Augustine converted the king within a year of his arrival.|$|E
