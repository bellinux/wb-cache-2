One of these relates to the complexity of the relations between the elements at the <b>graphemic</b> level (graphemes) to those at the phonemic level (phonemes), i.e., {{how difficult it is to}} convert <b>graphemic</b> strings (words) to phonemic strings. The second component is related to the diversity at the <b>graphemic</b> level, and to the complexity of determining the <b>graphemic</b> elements of a word (<b>graphemic</b> parsing), i.e., how to align a phonemic transcription to its spelling counterpart.|$|R
40|$|This study {{builds on}} the {{previous}} study undertaken by the author investigating the development of <b>graphemic</b> awareness among learners of Japanese with alphabetical backgrounds. <b>Graphemic</b> awareness refers to an awareness that garpheme can be a unit of analysis. The findings of the preceding study showed that, unlike native speakers of Japanese, 1) learners processed kanji by direct code, 2) they were not good at segmenting kanji into each grapheme, and 3) they did not use <b>graphemic</b> information for accessing lexical memory. The present study looks into learners' gaphemic awareness more carefully in order to investigate {{the relationship between the}} level of learners' <b>graphemic</b> awareness and their proficiency in reading Japanese. In this study, results of a reading comprehension test and a kanji production test were analysed. The results showed that subjects who had stronger <b>graphemic</b> awareness tended to get higher scores in reading comprehension test. The findings imply that there is a relationship between the development of <b>graphemic</b> awareness and reading proficiency...|$|R
40|$|Three {{years ago}} we commented in the present series (Vachek 1990. 11 - 20) on the {{functions}} and forms of the graphemes and in the written form of Present-Day English (further on, PDE). The two graph-emes appear quite isolated functionally in the <b>graphemic</b> system of PDE because the phonemes originally represented by them were either totally lost or so radically transformed that the resulting phonemic values are now very distant from those which they originally possessed. One can thus justly characterize them as peripheral elements of the <b>graphemic</b> system of PDE. Still, as we have demonstrated in the paper quoted above, the established peripheral status of and was not to result in their cancellation: the two graphemes were to uphold in the <b>graphemic</b> system of PDE rather important functional parts. The price they {{had to pay for}} their retention in the <b>graphemic</b> system was their functional revaluation; in other words, their establishment of new links with some other elements of the <b>graphemic</b> system of PDE (for furthe...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we report {{findings}} from a systematic investigation of spelling performance in three patients - PR, RH and AC - who despite their different medical diagnoses showed a very consistent pattern of dysgraphia, {{more typical of}} <b>graphemic</b> buffer disorder. Systematic investigation of the features characteristic of this disorder in Study 1 confirmed the presence of length effects in spelling, classic errors (i. e., letter substitution, omission, addition, transposition), a bow-shaped curve in the serial position of errors and consistency in substitution of consonants and vowels. However, {{in addition to this}} clear pattern of <b>graphemic</b> buffer impairment, evidence of regularity effects and phonologically plausible errors in spelling raised questions about the integrity of the lexical spelling route in each case. A second study was conducted, using a word and non-word immediate delay copy task, in an attempt to minimise the influence of orthographic representations on written output. Persistence of <b>graphemic</b> buffer errors would suggest an additional, independent source of damage. Two patients, PR and AC, took part and in both cases symptoms of <b>graphemic</b> buffer disorder persisted. Together, these findings suggest that damage to the <b>graphemic</b> buffer may be more common than currently suggested in the literature...|$|R

After a brief review of the scholarly literature {{on the use of the}} isocolon in medieval Slavic literature in general and medieval Croatian literature in particular, the article looks in detail at the visual appearance of the CrRSB on the manuscript pages. By examining selections of the CrRSB, the paper shows how the use of <b>graphemic</b> signs and markers, such as the page layout, the paragraph marker, the punctus and, most significantly, the “white space”, help indicate the rhythmical structure of the text. A thorough inspection of these passages indicates how <b>graphemic</b> features work in tandem with the rhetorical markers to indicate the textual isocola. The study concludes that the <b>graphemic</b> features of the CrRSB are completely consonant with the isocolic rhythmical patterns of the text and likely demonstrate that the manuscript’s scribes were not only aware of isocolic patterning, but used the graphical conventions of their day to indicate the proper way to read the text aloud...|$|R

In the present study, using a perceptual identification task, we found in Experiment 1 that this <b>graphemic</b> complexity effect can be observed while controlling for multiple print-to-sound associations, indexed by regularity or consistency. In Experiment 2, we obtained cumulative effects of <b>graphemic</b> complexity and regularity. These effects were replicated in Experiment 3 in a naming task.

50|$|It is an etic study, {{meaning that}} it has an outsider's {{perspective}} and is not concerned with any particular writing system. It is contrasted with the related emic field of <b>graphemics,</b> {{the study of the}} relation between different shapes in particular writing systems. Graphetics is analogous to phonetics; graphetics is to the study of writing as phonetics is to the study of spoken language. As such, it can be divided into two areas, visual graphetics and mechanical graphetics, which are analogous to auditory and articulatory phonetics, respectively.

5000|$|In <b>graphemics,</b> {{the term}} {{allograph}} denotes any glyphs {{that are considered}} variants of a letter or other grapheme, like a number or punctuation. An obvious example in English (and many other writing systems) is the distinction between uppercase and lowercase letters. Allographs can vary vastly, without affecting the underlying identity of the grapheme. Even if the word [...] "cat" [...] is rendered as [...] "cAt", it remains recognizable as the sequence of the three graphemes ‹c›, ‹a›, ‹t›. Thus, if a group of individual glyphs (shapes {{that may or may}} not represent the same letter) are allographs (they do represent the same letter), they all represent a single grapheme (a single instance of the smallest unit of writing).|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{describe}} {{a case of}} nonlinear spelling {{and its implications for}} theories of the <b>graphemic</b> buffer. C. T.

40|$|The role of phonological {{information}} in English word identification and the activation pattern of phonological and associative dimensions were investigated with a backward-masking paradigm. Mask type (<b>graphemic,</b> homophonic, associative, unrelated word control, and nonletter #-baseline) and target exposure duration were manipulated. <b>Graphemic</b> and homophonic but not associative masks influenced target recognition at 28 ms, and homophonic masks inhibited recognition relative to <b>graphemic</b> masks. At 42 ms, homophonic masks facilitated recognition, and associates inhibited, rather than enhanced, recognition relative to word controls. These {{results suggest that}} phonological computation occurs before associative computation and that phonological inhibition arises from lexical competition. The phonological and associative inhibitory effects are interpreted {{in terms of the}} center-surround perceptual principle.

40|$|This study {{analyzes}} acquired dysgraphia {{observed in}} a French-speaking woman. The results point to an impairment of the <b>graphemic</b> buffer, i. e., the processing stage where abstract orthographic representations are temporarily stored while planning the written production. However, the spelling errors were more frequent in the irregular than in the regular words. A qualitative analysis of the errors in the irregular misspelled words showed that, in general, these were not "regularization" errors, but rather the same characteristics as the phonologically implausible errors found in the regular words, such as letters substitutions, deletions, additions, and transpositions. Furthermore, in a list of regular and irregular words of same length and <b>graphemic</b> structure, the errors not only tended {{to concentrate on the}} irregularity itself but also tended to be more frequent elsewhere in the irregular words compared to the regular words. These finding are discussed in terms of a post-lexical sensitivity to irregular spelling. It is also shown that when focusing attention on the irregularity becomes necessary, this can cause a detriment to the surrounding <b>graphemic</b> constituents. Interaction between attentional resources and processing of orthographic representations at the <b>graphemic</b> buffer level is considered...|$|R
