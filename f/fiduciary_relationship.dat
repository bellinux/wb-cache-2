40|$|Economists {{who study}} {{the theory of the}} firm strive to draw a line between firms and markets. This line {{corresponds}} to the line lawyers draw between <b>fiduciary</b> and nonfiduciary <b>relationships.</b> The Critical Resource Theory (“CRT”) of <b>fiduciary</b> <b>relationships</b> is motivated by the property-rights theory of the firm. CRT holds that the distinguishing feature of <b>fiduciary</b> <b>relationships</b> is that “a fiduciary exercises discretion with respect to a critical resource belonging to the beneficiary, whereas most contracting parties exercise discretion only with respect to their own performance under the contract. ” In this chapter, I refine the description of “resources” under CRT using the property-rights theory of the firm and the resource-based view of the firm and extend the analysis of CRT to two important implications flowing from the basic structural insight: (1) while some features of <b>fiduciary</b> <b>relationships</b> are traceable to the logic of contract and some features are traceable to the logic of property, <b>fiduciary</b> <b>relationships</b> are unique hybrid institutions; and (2) the distinctive duty of loyalty that is imposed on <b>fiduciary</b> <b>relationships</b> is designed to protect the beneficiary’s property-like interest in critical resources...|$|R

At least two of the three parties must be different individuals or business entities; that is, one person can be trustor and trustee, and another can be the beneficiary or one can be trustor and beneficiary, and another be trustee or one person can be trustor and another can be trustee and beneficiary.|$|E

If the property was transferred through breach of trust, it will not be necessary to establish such a relationship, because it already exists.

50|$|Equity recognizes {{cases where}} a party places trust/confidence in another, these {{relationships}} {{are protected by}} equity and are called <b>fiduciary</b> <b>relationships.</b> The critical feature of <b>fiduciary</b> <b>relationships</b> is that the trustee undertakes to act for or {{on behalf of the}} beneficiary in the exercise of a power or discretion which will affect the interest of the trustee in a legal or practical sense. In the exercise of a fiduciary duty, a trustee must not take a benefit from their position as trustee unless the beneficiary or beneficiaries have given their informed consent.|$|R
2500|$|A {{fiduciary}} is {{a person}} who holds a legal or ethical relationship of trust with one or more other parties (person or group of persons). Typically, a fiduciary prudently takes care of money or other asset for another person. One party, for example a corporate trust company or the trust department of a bank, acts in a fiduciary capacity to the other one, who for example has entrusted funds to the fiduciary for safekeeping or investment. Likewise, asset managers—including managers of pension plans, endowments and other tax-exempt assets—are considered fiduciaries under applicable statutes and laws. [...] In a <b>fiduciary</b> <b>relationship,</b> one person, in a position of vulnerability, justifiably vests confidence, good faith, reliance, and trust in another whose aid, advice or protection is sought in some matter. [...] In such a relation good conscience requires the fiduciary to act at all times for the sole [...] and interest of the one who trusts.|$|E
2500|$|In {{cases of}} fraud, the same {{principle}} applies; the property is held by the fraudster on constructive trust for the original owner, unless the original owner {{was involved in the}} fraud, as in Lonrho plc v Fayed (No. 2). An exception to this principle is fraudulent misrepresentation, where the courts disagree over whether it immediately forms a constructive trust or requires action by the victim. In Collings v Lee, an estate agent transferred property to a non-existent purchaser (in reality an alias) and then claimed that as he was not the transferee, {{he did not have to}} pay the vendors; it was held that this fraudulent misrepresentation meant he held the property on constructive trust. However, in Lonrho, Millett J held that [...] "A contract obtained by fraudulent misrepresentation is voidable, not void, even in equity. The representee may elect to avoid it, but until he does so, the representor is not a constructive trustee of the property transferred pursuant to the contact, and no <b>fiduciary</b> <b>relationship</b> exists between him and the representee".|$|E
2500|$|After Derry v Peek it {{was thought}} that negligent {{misrepresentation}} was not actionable in tort. However, in Nocton v Lord Ashburton a claim was allowed where parties were in a <b>fiduciary</b> <b>relationship</b> and in Candler v Crane, Christmas and Co Denning LJ delivered a blistering dissent against the bar to recovery for negligent words. His dissent was approved in the leading case, Hedley Byrne & Co Ltd v Heller & Partners Ltd, where Heller & Partners Ltd (a bank) warranted to Hedley Byrne & Co Ltd (an advertising company) that its prospective client, Easipower Ltd, was creditworthy. When Easipower Ltd could not in fact pay for the advertising services, Hedley Byrne sued the bank for misrepresentation. This is a tort action, so the question did not actually involve a claim for misrepresentation inducing a contract. But the principle was the same. Could one sue for losses after being told negligent, rather than fraudulent, statements? The House of Lords answered [...] "yes" [...] if there was a special relationship between the parties showing that one had [...] "assumed responsibility" [...] to the other. In the instant case this would have worked, except that Heller & Partners had said in their warrant that they disclaimed any responsibility for their statement's accuracy. They had an exclusion clause (see below, and Misrepresentation Act 1967 s 3). So in absence of the exclusion clause, Heller & Partners would have been liable for negligent misstatement.|$|E

40|$|The Delaware Supreme Court {{recently}} {{referred to}} “contractually adopted fiduciary duties. ” Although some commentators, including Larry Ribstein, view fiduciary duties {{as a type}} of contract term, the notion of contractually adopted fiduciary duties is incoherent. The need to opt in to fiduciary duties would arise in only two circumstances: (1) <b>fiduciary</b> <b>relationships</b> that do not invoke fiduciary duties without contractual authorization, and (2) nonfiduciary relationships in which the parties wish to invoke fiduciary duties that would otherwise be absent. The first category of relationships does not exist, as courts impose fiduciary duties when the structure of a <b>relationship</b> indicates that <b>fiduciary</b> duties are justified, and the second category of cases is rare — and should be nonexistent — as independent contracting parties generally have no reason to opt in to the fiduciary regime because fiduciary duties simply do not make sense outside of <b>fiduciary</b> <b>relationships.</b> Nevertheless, the issue arises occasionally in judicial opinions, and this Essay offers a simple proposal to clarify the line between fiduciary duties and contractual duties. When a duty arises from the language of a contract, that duty is a contractual duty, but if a duty arises as a matter of common law because the structure of the relationship comports with the description of <b>fiduciary</b> <b>relationships,</b> that duty is a fiduciary duty...|$|R

Recently, several law-and-economics scholars, building on the economic literature on agency costs, have argued that nothing categorically distinguishes fiduciary from nonfiduciary legal <b>relationships.</b> So-called <b>fiduciary</b> <b>relationships,</b> they argue, are nothing more or less than contractual relationships. This Essay hypothesizes that courts possess a fairly well-developed schema of the fiduciary role, but have not developed a comparable schema for ordinary contracting parties. The fiduciary role-schema often makes courts more likely to over-interpret behavior of fiduciaries than in the case of conventional contracts. This attribution of qualities to fiduciaries strongly influences how judges analyze the causes of losses to beneficiaries. In some cases, the fiduciary schema alone produces this attribution effect. In others, additional cognitive biases that behavioral decision theorists have identified and analyzed reinforce the schema. In the final Part of this Essay, I will discuss how the fiduciary schema may work together with the well-known hindsight bias to expose fiduciaries to an unusually high risk of liability...|$|R
