40|$|In Radio Packet Network (RPN), {{unconstrained}} transmission {{may lead}} to collision {{of two or more}} packets. Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) protocol is a common used protocol to schedule collision-free transmission for such networks. TDMA transmission allows a number of users to access a single radio channel without interference by allocating unique time slots to each user. In TDMA network, time is divided into frames and a frame consists of time slots. For networks where each node is a neighbor for all the other nodes, each node should assign a different time slot in TDMA frame to transmit in it to have collision-free transmission. Typically, those time slots are ended by <b>guard</b> <b>times</b> for propagation delays. Those <b>guard</b> <b>times</b> are fixed for all time slots regardless the actual needed propagation delays.
