40|$|Production data, family labor use, and {{economic}} results are provided for two settled herders in the Northeastern region of Inner Mongolia in China. One was a medium size livestock oriented household residing in a high-quality grass and crop production zone {{on the border}} of the Republic of Mongolia, that had 20 cows, 100 <b>female</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>goats</b> and 400 <b>female</b> <b>breeding</b> sheep. The other producer household, which resided in a very low-quality grass and crop production zone {{on the border of}} Jilin province was small size and communal grazing land based, with 9 cows and 25 adult female goats. The net cash and in-kind income, if only direct costs (essentially out-of-pocket or cash costs) are taken into account, was 14. 5 Yuan per hour of family labor for the medium producer, and 3. 7 Yuan for the small producer. Addition of cost for family labor (using an opportunity cost method) resulted in net income falling slightly, to 12. 8 Yuan for the medium sized producer and 1. 2 Yuan per hour for the small household. 　本稿は，中国内モンゴル自治区北東地域にある 2 つの定住畜産農家により収集されたデータに基づき，その経営状況を比較分析したものである。 2 つの農家のうち 1 つは，高質な草地と農地を有する，モンゴル共和国と隣接する国境地域に居住してある中規模の畜産農家で，計 20 頭の雌牛， 100 頭の繁殖用母ヤギと 400 頭の繁殖用母ヒッジを所有している。もう 1 つは，低質な草地と農地を有する，吉林省と内モンゴル自治区と隣接する地域に居住してある小規模の畜産農家で，共同用の草地を利用して， 9 頭の雌牛と 25 頭成年母ヤギを飼養している。 2 つの畜産農家の純所得（現金収入と現物所得を含む）は，直接費用のみ（原則的に自己負担費あるいは現金支払経費）を計算すれば，中規模の畜産農家においては，家族労働力 1 人当たり時間当たりの所得は 14. 5 元で，小規模の畜産農家のそれはわずか 3. 7 元である。家族労働力の機会費用もコストに加算すれば，その 1 人当たり時間当たりの純所得は，中規模畜産農家では 12. 8 元で，小規模畜産農家では 1. 2 元で，やや減少する...|$|R

Weighted average rate of gain for all surviving kids was 87 g per day to 3 months and 67 g per day to 6 months of age.

In these conditions, all the growing efforts of the economical efficiency obtained as a result for the breeding and exploitation for the local population must be intensified. Besides the intensification of the rising preoccupations for the productive level based on the application of different genetic improvement programs, the elaboration of new technologies {{can be one of}} the future priorities. This affirmation is based on the fact that in almost all the traditional regions of <b>breeding</b> <b>goats</b> are used traditional technologies, which often prove to be uneconomical.

Intervals between parturitions in goats were 312 days overall but were significantly {{affected by the}} season of the previous birth: in sheep the interval was 280 days, this also being affected by season. There were 1. 08 kids born per litter in goats and 1. 06 lambs in sheep: litter size in sheep differed significantly between seasons and between years of parturition. Kids weighed 12. 8 kg at 150 days, there being differences due to season and parity: lambs weighed 14. 9 kg, this weight being affected by season, parity and litter size. Seasonal variations in weights of adult female goats and sheep were marked, being about 12 % below the overall annual average weight for each age class in June (end of dry season) and 12 % above the mean in November (post rains). Annual productivity was 22. 1 kg of live young per <b>breeding</b> <b>goat</b> per year, 874 g per kg of <b>breeding</b> <b>goat</b> per year and 2. 08 kg per kg metabolic weight of <b>breeding</b> <b>goat</b> per year.

In this study, a mixed herd was monitored to determine whether boer goats could induce return to cyclicity in sesonal <b>breeding</b> <b>goats.</b> All goats (n = 20) were pluriparous and kidded during January and February. During January a mixed group was formed (10 boer goats kept together with 10 domestic breed goats). At {{the same time a}} group of domestic breed goats (n = 12), kept in the same manner, 40 km away from the experimental group was used as controls. Blood samples were collected every 72 h to determine level of progesterone in both herds. Goats were monitored {{at the same time to}} observe for signs of oestrus. Progesterone concentrations in sera samples were determined using a RIA method. Data were analysed by ANOVA using Statistica software. We observed visual oestrus in all boer goats and in eight domestic breed goats from the mixed group during March and April.

40|$|Grooming is {{the most}} common form of affiliative {{behavior}} in primates that apart from hygienic and hedonistic benefits offers important social benefits for the performing individuals. This study examined grooming behavior in a cooperatively breeding primate species, characterized by single <b>female</b> <b>breeding</b> per group, polyandrous matings, dizygotic twinning, delayed offspring dispersal, and intensive helping behavior. In this system, <b>breeding</b> <b>females</b> profit from the presence of helpers but also helpers profit from staying in a group and assisting in infant care due to the accumulation of direct and indirect fitness benefits. We examined grooming relationships of <b>breeding</b> <b>females</b> with three classes of partners (breeding males, potentially breeding males, (sub) adult non-breeding offspring) during three reproductive phases (post-partum ovarian inactivity, ovarian activity, pregnancy) in two groups of wild moustached tamarins (Saguinus mystax). We investigated whether grooming can be used to regulate group size by either ‘‘pay-for-help’’ or ‘‘pay-to-stay’’ mechanisms. Grooming of <b>breeding</b> <b>females</b> with <b>breeding</b> males and nonbreeding offspring was more intense and more balanced than with potentially breeding males, and most grooming occurred during the breeding females’ pregnancies. Grooming was skewed toward more investment by the <b>breeding</b> <b>females</b> with <b>breeding</b> males during the phases of ovarian activity, and with potentially breeding males during pregnancies. Our results suggest that grooming might be a mechanism used by female moustached tamarins to induce mate association with the breeding male, and to induce certain individuals to stay in the group and help with infant care...|$|R
