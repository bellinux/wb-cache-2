In this study multi-photon microscopy, a fluorescence-based technique is used to 3 -D image in situ <b>the</b> <b>fouling</b> <b>of</b> microfiltration membranes by suspensions containing combinations of washed yeast, bovine serum albumin (BSA) and ovalbumin. Appropriate fluorescent labelling allows the three foulant species to be clearly identified.

When filtering washed yeast together with ovalbumin and/or a 50 : 50 mixture by mass of BSA and ovalbumin, the ovalbumin fouling dominates <b>the</b> system. Capture <b>of</b> aggregates by <b>the</b> cake did not reduce <b>fouling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> membrane by the protein and increased <b>the</b> resistance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cake. For mixtures of BSA and washed yeast, <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> a cake of yeast cells did reduce <b>fouling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> membrane by the protein, however, the extra resistance due to the cake resulted in a flux lower than that when filtering BSA alone...|$|R

We show that this strong correction has no physical meaning since the vertex ¯ ψA/ψ involves the contribution from a mixing {{as well as a}} pure gauge interaction due to the (anomalous) mixing among the photon and the vector composite field. By introducing the auxiliary field for the vector composite field, the situation turns to be rather clear.
