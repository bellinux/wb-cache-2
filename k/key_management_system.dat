40|$|This thesis {{covers the}} issue of {{securing}} ad hoc networks. Such networks exhibit a number of characteristics that make such a task challenging. One of the major challenges is that ad hoc networks typically lack a fixed infrastructure both in form of physical infrastructure such as routers, servers and stable communication links and {{in the form of}} an organizational or administrative infrastructure. Another difficulty lies in the highly dynamic nature of ad hoc networks since new nodes can join and leave the network at any time. The major problem in providing security services in such infrastructure less networks is how to manage the cryptographic keys that are needed. In order to design practical and efficient <b>key</b> <b>management</b> <b>systems</b> it is necessary to understand the characteristics of ad hoc networks and why traditional <b>key</b> <b>management</b> <b>systems</b> cannot be used. These issues are covered and the thesis also provides a summary of those <b>key</b> <b>management</b> solutions that have been proposed in the research literature so far...|$|R

50|$|A <b>key</b> <b>management</b> <b>system</b> (KMS), {{also known}} as a crytographic <b>key</b> <b>management</b> <b>system</b> (CKMS), is an {{integrated}} approach for generating, distributing and managing cryptographic keys for devices and applications. Compared to the term key management, a KMS is tailored to specific use-cases such as secure software update or machine-to-machine communication. In an holistic approach, it covers all aspects of security - from the secure generation of keys over the secure exchange of keys up to secure key handling and storage on the client. Thus, a KMS includes the backend functionality for key generation, distribution, and replacement as well as the client functionality for injecting keys, storing and managing keys on devices. With the Internet of Things, KMS becomes a crucial part for the security of connected devices.|$|E

40|$|Mobile ad hoc {{networks}} {{are a new}} paradigm of wireless communication for mobile hosts. Hosts are always represented as different nodes in the mobile ad hoc networks. There {{are a lot of}} differences between mobile ad hoc networks and traditional networks. We have studied the characteristics of ad hoc networks and pointed out the importance of its security. The main challenge in the design of mobile ad hoc networks is their vulnerability to security attacks. Like many distributed systems, security in ad hoc networks widely relies on the use of <b>key</b> <b>management</b> mechanisms. Specific <b>key</b> <b>management</b> <b>systems</b> have to be developed to suit the characteristics of mobile ad hoc networks because traditional <b>key</b> <b>management</b> <b>systems</b> are not appropriate for them. In this presentation, we propose an authentication services that combined with the concept of trust level. In our trust model, we assumed that each node has a trust value to its neighbouring nodes. This value is used on certificate renewal and it can be combined on a trust path. We also adopted the fully distributed certificate authority approach, which means the capabilities of the CA are distributed to all nodes in the ad hoc network. This work aims at providing a scalable, distribute...|$|R
