25|$|However, EMTs {{were neither}} trained nor {{authorised}} to provide definitive care for cardiac arrest. They {{could not provide}} defibrillation; intravenous medications; or advanced airway control, such as endotracheal intubation. EMTs saved few, if any, victims of sudden cardiac arrest, largely because cardiac arrest occurred mostly in people's homes. The time required for EMTs to arrive and transport the patient to the closest emergency department was too long for resuscitation to be successful. Not even letter-perfect CPR can save a life <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> too long for defibrillation and other advanced procedures to occur.|$|E
25|$|Since parve food is {{reclassified}} <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> on the flavour of meat or dairy produce, Ashkenazi Jews traditionally forbid eating parve {{contents of}} a pot {{that has been used}} within 24 hours to cook meat, if the parve contents would be eaten with dairy produce. Their tradition similarly forbids eating parve foods with meat if the cooking vessel was used to cook dairy produce within the previous 24 hours. According to Joseph Caro, the Sephardic tradition was more lenient about such things, but Moses Isserles argued that such leniency was unreliable.|$|E
25|$|Casual {{matchmaking}} allows players, alone, or in a {{party with}} invited friends, to be randomly matched against others. The game servers will attempt to match the gathered players in party via a dynamic queue with others based on general skill level, only broadening outside this search range <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> {{a long time to}} find matching players. Blizzard works to adjust this matchmaking approach to making sure players will find matches of people with roughly equivalent skill level. For example, in June 2016, Blizzard removed the option for players to avoid specific opponents; the option was meant for players to be able ignore trolls, but instead found that highly skilled players were being put on these avoidance lists and were having difficulty finding games or would be matched with new and less-skilled players.|$|E

25|$|This wave {{started at}} the {{beginning}} of the nineteenth century. It was characterized by the hope that al-Nahda (Arab Renaissance) and enlightenment would allow the region catch up with more developed nations. Although they differed in ideology and worldview, the common theme among the enlightenment intellectuals was their belief in gradual progress without sudden leaps even <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> decades. They did not support violence or revolution, but preferred peaceful methods such as education and science to bring about change. Most of them saw the Western world as a model to follow and imitate; some even called for full Europeanization. Another shared theme was their attempt to explain the backwardness of the Arab world and the progress of the Western world by one grand cause, each of them claiming to have found this cause. Despite the long time-frame and successive generations of this wave, the author concludes that it failed to achieve its goals.|$|E
25|$|In the United States and Canada, Trainwreck {{opened on}} July 17, 2015, {{the same day}} as the superhero film Ant-Man. Initial {{projections}} had the film opening to around $20 million, with The Hollywood Reporter noting that it could overperform <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> off among females or underperform given how R-rated comedies have struggled over the summer, with both Ted 2 and Magic Mike XXL failing to meet expectations. It made $1.8 million on Thursday night showings, which began at 8 p.m. from 2,363 theaters, and $10.7 million on its opening day. Through its opening weekend, it grossed $30.1 million from 3,158 theaters, exceeding expectations. This was Apatow's second-biggest debut as a director (just behind the $30.7 million debut of Knocked Up) and the sixth-biggest debut for a film that he was involved in as a writer, director or producer. The film played 69% female with 66% over 25 years old, which is typical for an R-rated comedy. According to a poll conducted by Rentrak in its opening weekend, 28% of respondents said they went to see the film because of Schumer.|$|E

500|$|Grant waged {{his bloody}} Overland Campaign in 1864. This is often {{characterized}} as a war of attrition, given high Union losses at battles such as the Battle of the Wilderness and Cold Harbor. Even though they {{had the advantage of}} fighting on the defensive, the Confederate forces had [...] "almost as high a percentage of casualties as the Union forces". The high casualty figures of the Union alarmed the North; Grant had lost a third of his army, and Lincoln asked what Grant's plans were, to which the general replied, [...] "I propose to fight it out on this line <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> all summer." ...|$|E

500|$|Meanwhile, Tom and April {{continue}} {{to make fun of}} Leslie, much to the displeasure of Mark. Mark, who tells the documentary crew he is impressed that Leslie has somehow maintained her optimism about government for six years, secretly asks Ron to give her the park project. Mark said doing so would return a favor Ron owes him for unspecified reasons. Leslie and Ann are extremely excited about the new exploratory subcommittee, and the department celebrates by getting drunk. Despite her skepticism about politics and government, a drunken Ann pledges {{to do whatever it takes}} to help get the pit filled in, [...] "even <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> two months". The episode ends with Ron explaining to the documentary crew how he makes his office as uninviting as possible.|$|E

However, on June 21, 2010, Lee announced on EvThreads.com that Evanescence had suspended recording to continue work on the album and [...] "get our heads into the right creative space". According to Lee, Wind-up Records was experiencing [...] "uncertain times" [...] which would further delay the album's release. Label president Ed Vetri supported Lee's decision: [...] "One thing we do at Wind-up is, we're patient. I it's not right, it's not coming out. <b>If</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> a year or four years, [...] {{going to take the}} time it needs to write the right record."

500|$|In Charlotte, Benjamin {{stayed in}} the home of a Jewish {{merchant}} as surrender negotiations dragged. [...] Here, Benjamin abandoned Davis's plan to fight on, telling him and the Cabinet that the cause was hopeless. [...] When negotiations failed, Benjamin was part of the shrunken remnant of associates that moved on with Davis. The party reached Abbeville, South Carolina on May 2, and Benjamin told Davis that he wanted to separate from the presidential party temporarily, and go to the Bahamas to be able to send instructions to foreign agents before rejoining Davis in Texas. According to historian William C. Davis, [...] "the pragmatic Secretary of State almost certainly never had any intention of returning to the South once gone". When he bade John Reagan goodbye, the postmaster general asked where Benjamin was going.

500|$|In game {{three of}} the 2011 Stanley Cup Finals, Rome sent Boston forward Nathan Horton to the ice with a late hit. Horton {{sustained}} a severe concussion and {{was taken off the}} ice on a stretcher. Rome was ejected from the game after being assessed a five-minute major penalty for interference and a game misconduct. After a disciplinary hearing the next morning, Rome was assessed a four-game suspension and missed the remainder of the 2011 playoffs. The NHL determined that Rome hit Horton over a second after Horton gave up the puck. The NHL considered a hit to be late <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> place more than half a second after a player loses possession. This proved to be a series-changing event, as the Canucks had already won games 1 and 2 at home before the hit took place. The Canucks went on to lose a momentum-swinging Game 3 and ended up losing the series four games to three. [...] The Canucks were outscored 23-8 in the 7-game series by the Boston Bruins.|$|E
500|$|The Luftwaffe {{launched}} a major attack against key Maltese airfields at dawn on 20 March. Leggo, {{who had not}} slept for over 24hours, returned to the airfield {{in the early hours}} having spent the night with a girlfriend. As the German planes approached he was ordered to prepare to fly. Plagis attempted to stop his friend from going, but Leggo insisted on flying, and took off at 08:05 as {{part of a group of}} four Spitfires and 12 Hurricanes aiming to intercept a squadron of Messerschmitt Bf 109s. He was soon seen to be flying poorly. A German pilot noticed this and attacked Leggo from close range, seriously damaging his aircraft and forcing him to bale out. Another Bf 109 then swooped and either fired at Leggo or collapsed his parachute with its slipstream, causing him to fall to his death. When Plagis learned what had happened, he was inconsolable, holding himself responsible. In his journal, he vowed to [...] "shoot down ten for Doug—I will too, <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> me a lifetime".|$|E
500|$|On November 18, the {{impatient}} Roosevelt directed {{that the}} second set of dies be used to strike coins, directly ordering the Mint to [...] "begin the new issue, even <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> you all day to strike one piece!" [...] Over 12,000 of these [...] "High Relief" [...] pieces were struck and were released into circulation in 1907 and 1908. [...] Barber wrote of the High Relief pieces to Landis, [...] "Mr. Hart has put the mill into operation and I send you two pieces showing the result; these are not selected as all the coins now made are the same as these two, which gives me alarm as they are so well made that I fear the President may demand the continuance of this particular coin." [...] Barber completed work on his version of the design, with a greatly lowered relief, and the new coin went into production on a large-scale basis. [...] A total of 361,667of the revised design were produced by the Mint in 1907; the [...] "Low Relief" [...] coins were released into circulation at the end of [...] [...] Barber's modifications were denounced both by the sculptor's family and by Hering. [...] Among other alterations, Barber changed the Roman numeral MCMVII for the date to the Arabic numeral [...] "1907". [...] In spite of the modifications, according to R.S. Yeoman in his A Guide Book of United States Coins, many consider the Saint-Gaudens double eagles the most beautiful of U.S. coins.|$|E
