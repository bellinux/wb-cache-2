Look back to {{the main}} type, Fig. II., page 55, and apply its {{profiles}} in due proportion to the feet of the pillars at E in Fig. IX. p. 72: If each step in Fig. II. were gathered accurately, the projection of the entire circular base would be less in proportion to its height than it is in Fig. II.; but the approximation to the result in <b>Fig.</b> <b>X.</b> is quite accurate enough for our purposes. (I pray the reader to observe that I have not made the smallest change, except this necessary expression of a reduction in diameter, in Fig. II. as it is applied in <b>Fig.</b> <b>X.,</b> only I have not drawn the joints of the stones because these would confuse the outlines of the bases; and I have not represented the rounding of the shafts, because it does not bear at present on the argument.) Now it would hardly be convenient, if we had to pass between the pillars, to have to squeeze ourselves through one of those angular gaps or brêches de Roland in <b>Fig.</b> <b>X.</b> Our first impulse would be to cut them open; but we cannot do this, or our piers are unsafe. We have but one other resource, to fill them up until we have a floor wide enough to let us pass easily: this we may perhaps obtain at the first ledge, we are nearly sure to get it at the second, and we may then obtain access to the raised interval, either by raising the earth over the lower courses of foundation, or by steps round the entire building.|$|E
6000|$|... § VII. But {{suppose the}} pillars are so vast that the lowest chink in <b>Fig.</b> <b>X.</b> {{would be quite}} wide enough to let us pass through it. Is there then any reason for filling it up? Yes. It will be remembered that in Chap. IV. § VIII. the chief reason for the wide {{foundation}} of the wall was stated to be [...] "that it might equalise its pressure over a large surface;" [...] but when the foundation is cut to pieces as in <b>Fig.</b> <b>X.,</b> the pressure is thrown on a succession of narrowed and detached spaces of that surface. If the ground is in some places more disposed to yield than in others, the piers in those places will sink more than the rest, and this distortion of the system will be probably of more importance in pillars than in a wall, because the adjustment of the weight above is more delicate; we thus actually want {{the weight of the}} stones between the pillars, in order that the whole foundation may be bonded into one, and sink together if it sink at all: and the more massy the pillars, the more we shall need to fill the intervals of their foundations. In the best form of Greek architecture, the intervals are filled up to the root of the shaft, and the columns have no independent base; they stand on the even floor of their foundation.|$|E

6000|$|... § XVII. We have {{hitherto}} {{conducted the}} argument {{entirely on the}} supposition of the pillars being numerous, and in a range. Suppose, however, that we require only a single pillar: as we have free space round it, {{there is no need}} to fill up the first ranges of its foundations; nor need we do so in order to equalise pressure, since the pressure to be met is its own alone. Under such circumstances, it is well to exhibit the lower tiers of the foundation as well as Yb and Xb. The noble bases of the two granite pillars of the Piazzetta at Venice are formed by the entire series of members given in <b>Fig.</b> <b>X.,</b> the lower courses expanding into steps, with a superb breadth of proportion to the shaft. The member Xb is of course circular, having its proper decorative mouldings, not here considered; Yb is octagonal, but filled up into a square by certain curious groups of figures representing the trades of Venice. The three courses below are octagonal, with their sides set across the angles of the innermost octagon, Yb. The shafts are 15 feet in circumference, and the lowest octagons of the base 56 (7 feet each side).|$|E
6000|$|... § LXXXVI. Let us then {{consider}} our definition as including the narrowest arch, or tracery bar, {{as well as}} the broadest roof, and it will be nearly a perfect one. For the fact is, that all good Gothic is nothing more than the developement, in various ways, and on every conceivable scale, of the group formed by the pointed arch for the bearing line below, and the gable for the protecting line above; and from the huge, gray, shaly slope of the cathedral roof, with its elastic pointed vaults beneath, to the slight crown-like points that enrich the smallest niche of its doorway, one law and one expression will be found in all. The modes of support and of decoration are infinitely various, but the real character of the building, in all good Gothic, depends upon the single lines of the gable over the pointed arch, Fig. IX., endlessly rearranged or repeated. The larger woodcut, <b>Fig.</b> <b>X.,</b> represents three characteristic conditions of the treatment of the group: a, from a tomb at Verona (1328); b, one of the lateral porches at Abbeville; c, one of the uppermost points of the great western façade of Rouen Cathedral; both these last being, I believe, early work of the fifteenth century. The forms of the pure early English and French Gothic are too well known to need any notice; my reason will appear presently for choosing, by way of example, these somewhat rare conditions.|$|E
6000|$|But in fig. 1, {{which is}} part of a fringe round one of the later windows in Rouen Cathedral, the {{foliation}} is first carried boldly round the arch, and then each cusp of it divided into other forms of foliation. The two larger canopies of niches below, figs. 5 and 6, are respectively those seen at the flanks of the two uppermost examples of gabled Gothic in <b>Fig.</b> <b>X.,</b> p. 213. Those examples were there chosen in order also to illustrate the distinction in the character of ornamentation which we are at present examining; and if the reader will look back to them, and compare their methods of treatment, he will at once be enabled to fix that distinction clearly in his mind. He will observe that in the uppermost the element of foliation is scrupulously confined to the bearing arches of the gable, and of the lateral niches, so that, on any given side of the monument, only three foliated arches are discernible. All the rest of the ornamentation is [...] "bossy sculpture," [...] set on the broad marble surface. On the point of the gable are set the shield and dog-crest of the Scalas, with its bronze wings, as of a dragon, thrown out from it on either side; below, an admirably sculptured oak-tree fills the centre of the field; beneath it is the death of Abel, Abel lying dead upon his face on one side, Cain opposite, looking up to heaven in terror: the border of the arch is formed of various leafage, alternating with the scala shield; and the cusps are each filled by one flower, and two broad flowing leaves. The whole is exquisitely relieved by color; the ground being of pale red Verona marble, and the statues and foliage of white Carrara marble, inlaid.|$|E

40|$|We {{find the}} {{interpretation}} of the genus Aristida by BEAUVOIS in his work Essai d’une nouvelle Agrostographie on pag. 33. Aristida lanata is the only species mentioned by him and the genus is figured on Pl. VIII. <b>fig.</b> <b>X.</b> This figure is a rather rough sketch and represents Aristida ciliata DESF [...] In the figures b and c there is a well-developed column and the central awn is plumose, the articulation between lemma and column is omitted or overlooked. Aristida lanata, as mentioned by BEAUVOIS, {{is quite different from the}} A. lanata, described by FORSKÅL, where all the awns are plumose and the glumes are quite different. BEAUVOIS tells us that among all the Aristidas he has found in herbaria, this one is the only species where the central awn differs in structure from the lateral ones, the central awn being a true awn (arista) and the lateral ones „setae” only. The genus with these characters he accepted as the genuine Aristida and hence described the genus with the 3 awns of equal structure as new under the name of Chaetaria. This interpretation of LINNÉ’S genus Aristida was however wrong. LINNNAEUS based the genus on the Aristida adscensionis, the only species mentioned in the description in the year 1753. Both genera Aristida and Chaetaria are quite identic. Among the 25 species enumerated by BEAUVOIS under Chaetaria, we find 4 species with a? and 2 species, A. capensis and A. vestita, do not belong to the genus Chaetaria (BEAUVOIS could not study them or he overlooked the articulation of the column). Aristida capensis has plumose awns and belongs to the section Stipagrostis and A. vestita belongs to the section Arthratherum. BEAUVOIS figures two species of his genus Chaetaria (Plate VII. fig. V. and VI.). The first figure is Aristida stricta MICHX., the second is Chaetaria capillaris, the name is a misprint for C. capillacea based on Aristida capillacea of LAMARK. TRINIUS accepted in the year 1824 the genus of BEAUVOIS as a section of the genus Aristida in his Dissertatio botanica De Graminibus Unifloris et Sesquifloris on p. 175 with the diagnosis: „Perianthium cum setis non articulatum”. This section is also accepted in this work, it contains about 200 species, North America and Mexico have about 47 species, Central and South America have about 58 species. The West Indian Islands are comparatively rich in species, about 15. In the Old World we find but one species in Europe, the continent of Africa has about 38 species, Madagascar and the adjacent islands have 7 representatives.

40|$|A central circle {{surrounded}} by large circular flankers {{is perceived to}} be smaller than an identical one {{surrounded by}} small flankers: such effect is known as the Ebbinghaus illusion (Fig. 1). This size-illusion has been theorized to be caused or influenced by cultural factors (Doherty et al., 2008) as it is reduced or absent in primitive cultures (de Fockert et al., 2007), 4 - 5 years-old children (Doherty et al., 2010) and adult baboons (Parron e Fagot, 2007). Several papers have reported that animals share some visual illusions with humans. Animal experience, among others, the horizontal-vertical illusion (monkey species: Dominguez, 1954), the Zoellner illusion (baboons: Benhar & Samuel, 1982), the corridor illusion (baboons: Barbet & Fagot, 2002), stereokinetic illusions (chicks: Clara et al., 2006) and the Ponzo illusion (pigeons: Fujita et al., 1991; horses: Timney & Keil, 1996; macaques: Bayne & Davis, 1993; chimpanzees: Fujita, 1997). In addition, experiments using Kanizsa-type figures have shown that nonhuman animals are able to perceive illusory contours as complete units (Nieder, 2002). Relevant data with regard to the presence of visual illusion in animal species have been obtained in studies employing young domestic chicks as an animal model (e. g. Regolin & Vallortigara, 1995; Zanforlin, 1981;). This animal model has, in fact, the advantage of allowing to test very young animals (domestic chicken are a precocial species), controlling for the role of previous visual experience and allowing comparisons with data obtained in human infants/chikdren. This is a particularly relevant aspect for studies on the Ebbinghaus illusion, since the role of experiential and cultural factors has been contested for this illusion, and the illusion seems to be absent in young children (see above). However, up to the present moment, the Ebbinghaus illusion has been studied only in adult subjects of a primate species (baboons, Parron e Fagot, 2007). The aim {{of the present study was}} thus to check whether the Ebbinghaus Illusion would be experienced by three-day old domestic chicks. Methods and Procedure Subjects were 3 - 4 day-old domestic chicks (Gallus gallus). According to an incidental learning paradigm, during the first 3 days of life, chicks were reared in presence of 4 small plastic screens (14 X 9. 5 cm), on two of which it was visible a small orange circle (0. 5 cm), whereas on the other two there was a larger orange circle (0. 9 cm). Moreover, both reinforced and non reinforced screens, presented above the orange target circles, an identical line composed of 4 big and 6 small black circles (1 cm and 0. 4 cm respectively) (See Fig 2.). For half of the chicks food was available only behind the screens presenting large orange circles, whereas for the other half food was available behind the screens presenting the small orange circle (the position of the screens in the rearing cage was constantly swapped during the day). See Fig. 3 for the rearing apparatus. This rearing phase was identical for both experiments. In the first experiment, after this incidental learning phase, chicks underwent a free-choice test between the two rearing stimuli placed at the two sides of a rectangular apparatus. Each chick’s behaviour was observed for 6 minutes, when it approached one of the two stimuli, a preference was scored (the percentage of time spent near the positive stimulus was recorded). The aim of this phase was to verify if chicks could learn to prefer a smaller or a bigger circle if it was associated with food, in order to allow the test of the Ebbinghaus illusion in further phase. Since, the first experiment was not successful in demonstrating a preference for the positive stimulus, we devised a second experiment, using a detour procedure. In this second experiment, in a first test-phase chicks were presented with two screens identical to those used at training (one with a smaller orange circle printed on it, and the other with a bigger circle). Only chicks that demonstrated to have a reliable preference for the reinforced stimulus (i. e. choose the correct screen on at least 4 trials out of 6), were then tested with Ebbinghaus stimuli in a further test phase (identical to the previous one except for the stimuli) (see <b>Fig.</b> <b>X).</b> Chicks’ preferences were computed as the first screen detoured by the subjects. Subjects showing a preference for the stimulus that had been associated with food were thereafter tested with the Ebbinghaus-stimuli (i. e., the central circle was surrounded by either large or small gray inducer circles.
