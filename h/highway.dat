5|$|After {{losing the}} {{connection}} to the Lincoln <b>Highway,</b> officials convinced planners of the Victory <b>Highway</b> to traverse the state. The <b>highway</b> entered Colorado from Kansas along what was previously called the Smoky Hill Trail. The <b>highway</b> crossed the mountains along a trail blazed by a railroad surveyor and captain in the American Civil War, cresting at Berthoud Pass. After a round of political infighting between Utah and Nevada, the Victory <b>Highway</b> would become the Lincoln Highway's main rival for San Francisco-bound traffic. When the U.S. <b>Highway</b> system was unveiled in 1926, the Victory <b>Highway</b> was numbered U.S. <b>Highway</b> 40.|$|E
5|$|An unpaved {{extension}} of the Bothell Road, traveling along the Sammamish River to Woodinville, Redmond, and Fall City, was designated as {{a branch of the}} Sunset <b>Highway</b> (State Road 2) in 1925. The <b>highway</b> was later paved and incorporated into a longer branch of the Sunset <b>Highway</b> (re-designated as Primary State <b>Highway</b> 2) in 1937, running from Downtown Seattle to Fall City. The branch <b>highway</b> was extended to North Bend after the opening of a Sunset <b>Highway</b> bypass in 1941, using the former mainline road.|$|E

5|$|In 1913, {{the state}} <b>highway</b> system was {{adjusted}} again, and several new roads {{were added to}} the system, including parts of what would become US410. The Olympic <b>Highway</b> traveled around the Olympic Peninsula and a section from Aberdeen to Olympia was later used as part of US410. The Pacific <b>Highway</b> would later have a brief concurrency with US410 from Olympia to Tacoma, and US410 would later connect to the National Park <b>Highway</b> in Tacoma and follow it to Buckley, where State Road5, now a secondary <b>highway</b> maintained by the counties, began. From the end of State Road5 in Naches, the Inland Empire <b>Highway</b> is concurrent with the future US410 to Dayton, where a branch of the <b>highway</b> travels to Clarkston. State Road5 became the McClellan Pass <b>Highway</b> in 1919 and was aligned further south to Chinook Pass. The McClellan Pass <b>Highway</b> was renamed the Naches Pass <b>Highway</b> in 1921 to reflect the realignment in 1919. Despite the name, the road did not cross Naches Pass, as no <b>highway</b> ever has.|$|E
5|$|In Perth, the <b>highway</b> {{begins in}} Midland near Great Eastern <b>Highway,</b> and further north intersects the Reid and Roe highways, which {{together}} form Perth's ring road.

Various road routes are allocated to sections of Great Northern <b>Highway,</b> including the Highway1 routes National Route1 and National Highway1, {{as well as}} National Highway95.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, a {{corridor}} {{study conducted by}} Main Roads into the long-term needs of the Perth to Darwin National <b>Highway</b> concluded the existing Great Northern <b>Highway,</b> with bypasses around rural towns and the Swan Valley, was the most suitable route for the National <b>Highway.</b> Planning the alignment for the southernmost section, from Reid <b>Highway</b> in Perth to Bindoon, was undertaken from 2003 to 2013. It resulted in the planned alignment commencing from Tonkin <b>Highway,</b> bypassing the Swan Valley and Bullsbrook before reconnecting with Great Northern <b>Highway</b> near Brand <b>Highway.</b> Great Northern <b>Highway</b> is then followed until the Brockman River, where the planned route deviates to the east to bypass Bindoon, reconnecting with the existing <b>Highway</b> near Bindoonâ€“Moora Road.|$|E
