50|$|An {{employment}} subsidy {{serves as}} an incentive to businesses to provide more job opportunities to reduce the level of unemployment in the country (income subsidies) or to encourage research and development. With an employment subsidy, the government provides assistance with wages. Another form of employment subsidy is the social security benefits. <b>Employment</b> <b>subsidies</b> allow a person receiving the benefit to enjoy some minimum standard of living.|$|E
50|$|In 1984 New Zealand's Labor {{government}} took the dramatic step of ending all farm subsidies, which then consisted of 30 separate production payments and export incentives. This was a truly striking policy action, because New Zealand's economy is roughly {{five times more}} dependent on farming than is the U.S. economy, measured by either output or <b>employment.</b> <b>Subsidies</b> in New Zealand {{accounted for more than}} 30 percent of the value of production before reform, somewhat higher than U.S. subsidies today. And New Zealand farming was marred by the same problems caused by U.S. subsidies, including overproduction, environmental degradation and inflated land prices.|$|E
40|$|Extract]In this {{dissertation}} we {{have studied}} the origins of deadweight loss in <b>employment</b> <b>subsidy</b> schemes. The disagreement between micro and macroeconometric studies of the added value of such schemes in guiding long-term unemployed back to the labour market has been {{the reason for this}} research. Microeconometric studies find positive treatment effects for participating long-term unemployed. That is, their re-employment probability improves as compared to similar non-participating long-term unemployed. Consequently, micro studies are positive about <b>employment</b> <b>subsidy</b> schemes. Macroeconometric studies – unlike micro studies – take the overall employment effect of <b>employment</b> <b>subsidy</b> schemes into account and find that <b>employment</b> <b>subsidy</b> schemes hardly lead to additional employment. As a consequence, such studies are more conservative with respect to the role <b>employment</b> <b>subsidy</b> schemes should play in reducing long-term unemployment. Deadweight loss – the share of long-term unemployed the firm would have hired {{in the absence of the}} subsidy – is one of the main and most harmful impediments to extending employment as a consequence of introducing the subsidy. In case of deadweight loss, the microeconomic effect (i. e. productivity gain) cannot be attributed to the subsidy, as the employee in question would also have found the job without that subsidy. The same holds for the macro effect (i. e. extending the effective labour supply). In case of deadweight loss, firms would have considered subsidized employees even without the subsidy, which implies they are already part of the effective labour supply. ...|$|R

40|$|Most {{models of}} tax {{competition}} assume full employment. Yet, actually one often observes that fiscal competition, {{particularly when it}} is aimed at attracting investment, is motivated by the concern of fighting unemployment and enhancing job creation. The present paper considers a multicountry model with capital mobility and unemployment. Fiscal policy has two opposing objectives: financing unemployment insurance and increasing employment. In each country there is a majority vote on this policy. The purpose of the paper is to analyse how opening borders to capital flows modifies the median voter’s choice of the <b>employment</b> <b>subsidy.</b> Assuming that capital and labour are complements, economic integration is shown to rise the <b>employment</b> <b>subsidy</b> with fixed wages. This agrees with intuition as a larger <b>employment</b> <b>subsidy</b> attracts more capital.

(2008); Egebark and Kaunitz (2010)) and Finland (e.g. Huttunen et al. (2010)) over the last two decades. Chile (e.g. Gruber, (1997)) and Turkey (e.g. Betcherman et al.

One of the time-varying covariates is an index of macro-economic performance that controls for the variation in the hazard rate due to business cycle fluctuations.
