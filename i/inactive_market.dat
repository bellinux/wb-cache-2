5000|$|In 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) {{implemented}} SFAS 157 {{in order}} to expand disclosures about fair value measurements in financial statements. Fair-value accounting or [...] "Mark-to-Market" [...] is defined by FAS 157 as [...] "a price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date". The definition {{is accompanied by a}} framework which categorize different types of assets and liabilities into 3 levels, and their measurement varied accordingly. The hierarchy of fair value is:(1) Assets or liabilities whose values could be observed on an active market of identical assets or liabilities.(2) Assets or liabilities whose value could be quoted from an <b>inactive</b> <b>market,</b> or based on internal-developed models, with input data from observable markets of similar items.(3) Financial assets and liabilities whose values couldn't be quoted from an observable market but instead based on prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement. This requires management estimation that may lead to manipulation.|$|E
40|$|Background: The main {{topic of}} the master thesis is Valuation of Securities on Inactive Markets. Securities quoted on <b>inactive</b> <b>market</b> have been {{investigated}} to present how their fair value can be efficiently measured. Securities quoted on <b>inactive</b> <b>market</b> can have limited or unreliable inputs and the valuation process can become time and money consuming. Financial professional face similar problems while valuing financial assets on inactive markets. Relevance of the topic: The master thesis might be {{of particular interest to}} investment and asset management companies which can get an opportunity to share their experiences and gain from the knowledge exchange. Method: One asset management company and three audit companies have been contacted for collecting information from different perspectives. asset management company has practical experience on conducting valuation of inactively traded securities and audit companies suggest how valuation should be done. Results have been collected through surveys and interviews to all selected companies. Then the qualitative approach has been applied on the collected results. Main findings: Even though most of the answers to the questionnaire were different, as the companies followed generally accepted international standards, their view on the valuation of inactively traded securities was relatively common. Companies admitted that the main problems in the valuation of securities quoted on <b>inactive</b> <b>market</b> are the limited access to market quotes, high spreads on the market, unreliable market information, limited access to financial data of the valued companies and considerable amount of inactively traded securities. Valuation based on multiples is most commonly used by the companies. Sometimes the combination of methods for example price of recent transaction, DCF and net assets can be applied and {{it is up to the}} investment manager to decide what methods to use. Summary of recommendations offered by the interviewed companies concerning valuation of inactively traded securities is presented at the end of the master thesis...|$|E

We test our hypotheses using a panel of Italian firms. Our findings show that a high level of family ownership has a negative effect on International Diversification, but that an <b>inactive</b> <b>market</b> for corporate control negates this. We found too that when the board of a family-owned firm has a higher proportion of independent directors, International Diversification is greater. We also found that similar to the family-ownership effect, a high level of state ownership results in less International Diversification.

The use of the fair value concept in developing countries {{has proved to be a}} significant challenge due to either a Jack of formal capital market systems or very thinly traded capital markets. This study investigates the obstacles to determining fair values of equity share investments, government bonds and corporate bonds, treasury bills and loan advances in Mozambique. The study was done through a combination of literature review and empirical research using a questionnaire. The trading statistics of the financial instruments on the Mozambique Stock Exchange and the prospectuses of bonds were used. The empirical research was carried out using a type of non-probability sampling technique called purposive sampling. A subcategory of purposive sampling called expert sampling was used to select the eventual sample which was composed of people with specialised knowledge on the capital market system in Mozambique. The results of the empirical research were analysed using pie charts to summarise the responses. The research concluded that the Mozambique Stock Exchange is an <b>inactive</b> <b>market</b> for financial instruments characterised by thin trading in both equity shares and bonds. The estimation of fair values evidenced by observable market transactions is therefore impossible. The absence of credit rating agencies in Mozambique presents a significant challenge in assigning credit risk and pricing financial instruments such as bonds. The research also noted that significant volatility of the main economic indicators such as treasury bills interest rates and inflation made it difficult to determine fair values of financial instruments using financial modelling techniques. Due to the above obstacles to determining fair values of certain financial instruments in Mozambique, the best alternatives are to value these financial instruments at either cost or amortised cost.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{research}} managers’ motives of accounting policy choice for long-term nonfinancial assets. International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) allow managers to choose between cost and revaluation model for measurement after recognition. The assumption is that manager’s decision is opportunistic so they use the revaluation model as a device to improve perceptive borrowing capacity of a company, and consequently, to reduce debt cost. Prior studies were mainly conducted in developed, marketoriented economies, unlike Croatia. The contribution {{of this paper is}} the research of motives and determinants of asset revaluation policy choice in bank-oriented economies with <b>inactive</b> <b>markets.</b> Furthermore, multivariate logistic regression was not used as a research method in this field of accounting in transition and emerging economies till now.

40|$|This paper {{explains}} the disparate paths of venture capital {{organizations in the}} United States and Germany over the post-World War II period—the early emergence and burgeoning of the sector in the U.

These factors differed radically between the US and Germany and produced divergent paths for venture capital institutions.

40|$|This work {{contributes}} {{to the study of}} comparative political economy by examining the impact of financial deregulation on corporate governance in the two main continental European economies, France and Germany. It investigates the process of transformation of the systems of corporate governance of these two countries toward a greater shareholder value orientation. It analyses the divergent responses of large companies in these two countries to the same set of changes in the international economy. Despite similarities in terms of ownership concentration, <b>inactive</b> securities <b>markets,</b> financial opacity, and closed market for hostile takeovers, large firms reacted differently to the new external environment - with dramatically diverging consequences for employees. In France, the majority of large companies have substantially changed their business strategy through a focus on a single business activity. German firms, in contrast, have responded to the new environment with greater financial transparency. The evolution of corporate governance in the two countries does not entail convergence - but different patterns of change with substantial differentiation in some areas, less in others. The argument presented deals with the dynamics of economic adjustment. Why do changes in the structure of corporate governance move in different directions in France and Germany? The power of management, especially relative to labor, given by existing industrial structures, accounts to a substantial extent for the different patterns by which shareholder value practices have been introduced in the two countries. (cont.) The institutional framework conditions both what managers are likely to want to do (some forms of reorganization will be more attractive where workplace organization and worker power takes the form it does in France and others more attractive where the workforce has continuing power as in Germany) and what they can do. The power of German workers induces management to compromise on measures on which both can agree (greater transparency, continuing cross-subsidies). The power of French management allows them to pursue strategies strongly in their interest. In short, all capitalist economies are adjusting to pressures for change in corporate governance but the dynamic of adjustment is deeply affected by the relative power of management and labor. by Michel Goyer.

40|$|Bibliography: leaves 77 - 81. The King Reports, {{as well as}} {{legislative}} developments culminating {{from these}} reports, are aimed at enhancing corporate governance standards in South Africa and aligning them with international best practice. Notwithstanding these measures, {{a number of significant}} failures in corporate governance rocked South African business during this period, severely denting the perception of the quality and standard of corporate governance. Given the importance of international investors' confidence, a continuous review of the South African corporate governance structure is imperative. This dissertation aims at performing a comparative and critical analysis of the corporate governance structures in South Africa. The objective is to seek alternative or improved corporate governance mechanisms that will enhance the current dispensation. For this purpose, various international corporate governance models are analysed and their monitoring mechanisms identified. The possibility of utilising some of these mechanisms to enhance corporate governance in South Africa is examined. The institutional environment in South Africa (I. e. the controlled shareholder environment, <b>inactive</b> and illiquid <b>markets)</b> prevents the market model mechanisms of the US and UK from playing a greater monitoring role. Further market model mechanisms aimed at promoting the independent monitoring of management have to a large extent been incorporated into the South African corporate governance framework. However, the ongoing failures of large listed and unlisted companies, including smaller banks in South Africa, that appear to indicate poor levels of, or ineffective, corporate governance, calls for the enforcement and acceptance of the monitoring guidelines set out in the King Reports. The German and Japanese bank governance model has a limited application in South Africa. The level of bank debt financing is generally lower than equity financing, thereby restricting banks' ability to become monitors through their debt control rights...|$|R
40|$|In {{fisheries}} managed using individual transferable quotas (ITQs) it {{is generally}} assumed that quota markets are well-functioning, allowing quota to flow on either a temporary or permanent basis to those able to make best use of it. However, despite {{an increasing number of}} fisheries being managed under ITQs, empirical assessments of the quota markets that have actually evolved in these fisheries remain scarce. The Queensland Coral Reef Fin-Fish Fishery (CRFFF) on the Great Barrier Reef has been managed under a system of ITQs since 2004. Data on individual quota holdings and trades for the period 2004 - 2012 were used to assess the CRFFF quota market and its evolution through time. Network analysis was applied to assess market structure and the nature of lease-trading relationships. An assessment of market participants' abilities to balance their quota accounts, i. e., gap analysis, provided insights into market functionality and how this may have changed in the period observed. Trends in ownership and trade were determined, and market participants were identified as belonging to one out of a set of seven generalized types. The emergence of groups such as investors and lease-dependent fishers is clear. In 2011 - 2012, 41 % of coral trout quota was owned by participants that did not fish it, and 64 % of total coral trout landings were made by fishers that owned only 10 % of the quota. Quota brokers emerged whose influence on the market varied with the bioeconomic conditions of the fishery. Throughout the study period some quota was found to remain <b>inactive,</b> implying potential <b>market</b> inefficiencies. Contribution to this inactivity appeared asymmetrical, with most residing in the hands of smaller quota holders. The importance of transaction costs in the operation of the quota market and the inequalities that may result are discussed in light of these findings...|$|R
40|$|According to Mint's"vent for surplus"theory, {{development}} of the economies of Indonesia, the Philippines, and Thailand from the nineteenth century on depended on the natural advantage of large tracts of unused"empty land"with low population density and abundant natural resources of the type typically found in Southeast Asia and Africa {{at the outset of}} Western colonization. When these economies were integrated into international trade, hitherto unused natural resources (primary commodities the indigenous people had not valued) became the source of economic development, commanding market value because of high import demand in Western economies. The major delta of Chao Phraya River was the resource base of vent-for-surplus development with rice in Thailand; tropical rain forests filled that role in Indonesia and the Philippines with respect to the production of tropical cash crops. This basic difference underlay differences in the distribution of farm size: the unimodal distribution of peasants or family farms in Thailand and the coexistence of peasants and large estate farms or plantations specializing in tropical export crops in Indonesia and the Philippines. Differences in agrarian development were also shaped by different policies toward the elite's preemption of unused land. Under Spanish colonialism, the elite preempted unused land in the Philippines wholesale, bifurcating land distribution between non-cultivating landlords and sharecroppers in lowland rice areas, and between plantation owners and wage laborers in upland areas. In Indonesia, the Dutch government granted long-term leases for uncultivated public land to foreign planters, but prevented alienation of cultivated land from native peasants, to avoid social instability. In Thailand, concessions were granted for private canal building, but the independent kingdom preserved the tradition of giving land to anyone who could open and cultivate it. Relatively homogenous land-owning peasants dominated Thailand's rural sector. As frontiers for new cultivation closed, the plantation system's initial advantage (large-scale {{development of}} land and infrastructure) began to be outweighed by its need to monitor hired labor. The peasant system, based on family labor needing no supervision, allowed Thailand's share of the world market in tropical cash crops to grow, as Indonesia and the Philippines lost their traditional comparative advantage. Moreover, land reform in the Philippines made land <b>markets</b> <b>inactive,</b> with resulting distortions in resource allocation and serious under-investment in agriculture.

40|$|In National Federation of Independent Businesses v. Sebelius, the Supreme Court exhaustively {{analyzed}} Congress’s constitutional {{power to}} enact the watershed Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA or “Obamacare”). The ACA imposes a “shared responsibility requirement,” popularly known as the “Individual Mandate” (IM), which forces Americans to buy medical insurance or pay a “penalty. ” The ACA’s text and legislative history, {{as well as the}} public defenses of it by President Obama and his supporters, consistently described the IM as a valid exercise of Congress’s power “[t]o regulate Commerce... among the several States. ” This reliance on the Commerce Clause was understandable, as it has been interpreted since 1937 as giving Congress virtually plenary authority. Indeed, the modern Court has upheld every federal statute (with two trivial exceptions) after applying an extremely deferential standard of review: Could Congress have had a rational basis for concluding that the activity regulated, taken in the aggregate nationwide, “substantially affects” interstate commerce? This judicially-approved legislation addressed not merely national economic matters, but also seemingly non-commercial subjects like civil rights, crime, the environment, and health and safety. In National Federation, Justices Ginsburg, Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan sought to continue this lenient approach by ruling that Congress could reasonably have determined that Americans’ decisions about health insurance (including the failure to obtain it), when added up nationally, substantially affect the interstate economy. However, Chief Justice Roberts and his four conservative Republican colleagues held that the IM had exceeded the bounds of the Commerce Clause, which restricted Congress to regulating interstate commercial “activity”–as contrasted with the IM’s novel attempt to compel Americans who were <b>inactive</b> in a <b>market</b> to buy something they did not want. The Chief Justice then unexpectedly joined the four liberal Democrats in holding that the IM could plausibly be construed as a “tax” on those who did not buy medical insurance and therefore could be sustained under Congress’s power to “Lay and Collect Taxes. ” The four dissenters barely concealed their anger at Chief Justice Roberts for switching sides (apparently at the eleventh hour due to intense political pressure) to save Obamacare on dubious Taxing Power grounds. Most Republican legal analysts had a similar reaction. They fretted that the Court had radically altered its Commerce Clause jurisprudence by refusing to defer to Congress’s policy judgments about an important national economic and social issue, which would invite similar challenges. It is impossible to say with any certitude whether such concerns are warranted. It may be that National Federation portends a shift to increasingly aggressive judicial imposition of serious Commerce Clause restraints. On balance, however, history and pragmatism suggest that this case will have a marginal jurisprudential impact. This conclusion rests primarily on the fact that, since the New Deal era, the Court has sustained all major Commerce Clause legislation, which forms the foundation of the modern administrative and social welfare state. Realistically, the Court would risk legal, political, social, and economic chaos by rolling back its precedent allowing such important federal laws. Thus, at most the conservative Justices can try to stem the tide of new Commerce Clause statutes. Yet recent experience suggests that even that modest goal will prove difficult to achieve, as the Rehnquist Court’s lone attempt to enforce an outer boundary on Congress’s power–that it could regulate only subjects that were “commercial” in nature–fizzled out within a decade. Likewise, National Federation’s new “activity” limit will probably have little lasting relevance, for three reasons. First, the ACA represented Congress’s only attempt in over two centuries to use the Commerce Clause to regulate “inactivity,” and there {{do not appear to be}} any similar federal statutes in existence or on the horizon. Second, even if Congress were to enact such a law, it would be invalidated only if five conservative Republican Justices happened to be on the Court. Third, the latter restriction on the Commerce Clause did not put a dent in Congress’s overall power, because Chief Justice Roberts peeled off to uphold the ACA through his creative interpretation of the Taxing Power. The Court will likely remain unwilling to strike down non-trivial federal statutes...|$|R
