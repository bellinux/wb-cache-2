40|$|Abstract: This paper {{deals with}} the {{achievement}} of a reduced order mathematical model using the singular perturbations method for an electrohydraulic system composed by a hydraulic cylinder which is controlled with an <b>electrohydraulic</b> <b>servovalve</b> with five ways. Due to the high value of the bulk-modulus of fluid, to the low value of the fluid occupied volume and also to the spool valve mass low, the equations describing the dynamical behavior of the spool valve can be considered singular perturbed equations. Based on this fact, the system order can be reduced. Computer simulations are included to demonstrate the behavior of reduced order system comparison to complete system...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} was {{aimed to develop}} and simulate the mathematical model for the control of an axial piston pump using a flapper-nozzle valve. It was assumed that all the state variables are defined as the perturbations in the physical quantities; therefore, linearized relations were used. These linearized relations were combined to form the state-variable representation of the model;The model was then simulated to investigate the control characteristics of the proposed system. The responses of a stand alone flapper-nozzle valve were evaluated first. Excellent agreement between the experimental data and theoretical data of output pressure rise of the valve was found;The open-loop system performance of the axial piston pump and flapper-nozzle valve combination was unstable. To enhance {{the stability of the}} system, an optimal control design was applied. It was found that the computed results of the nonaugmented optimal design lack robustness for improving the existing control system. Thus the augmented optimal control method was used to enhance the system performances;Time responses of the augmented optimal control system were evaluated. It was observed that the increase of input current had little effect on the system responses. Doubling the discharge flow rate also doubled the overshoot. Whereas increasing the discharge volume tended to slow down the system responses. Finally, the increase of the rotational speed of the pump shaft produced a higher overshoot and a slower response of the system;The performances of the control of an axial piston pump using a flapper-nozzle valve as a controller were compared to the performances of using a four-way hydraulic valve, a single-stage <b>electrohydraulic</b> <b>servovalve,</b> and a two-stage <b>electrohydraulic</b> <b>servovalve</b> as controllers. It was concluded that the system of a flapper-nozzle valve and an axial piston pump combination was superior to other combinations in terms of the balance between pressure-time response and maximum pressure overshoot...|$|E

A hydrostatic transmission with pump variable efficiency and engine radial with constant working absorptivity was chosen.

40|$|This paper gives a new {{approach}} for modeling the fluid-structure interaction of servovalve component-actuator. The analyzed valve is a precision flow control valve-jet pipe <b>electrohydraulic</b> <b>servovalve.</b> The positioning of an actuator depends upon the flow rate from control ports, in turn depends on the spool position. Theoretical investigation is made for No-load condition and Load condition for an actuator. These are used in finite element modeling of an actuator. The fluid-structure-interaction (FSI) is established between the piston and the fluid cavities at the piston end. The fluid cavities were modeled with special purpose hydrostatic fluid elements while the piston is modeled with brick elements. The finite element method is used to simulate the variation of cavity pressure, cavity volume, mass flow rate, and the actuator velocity. The finite element analysis is extended to study the system's linearized response to harmonic excitation using direct solution steady-state dynamics. It was observed from the analysis that the natural frequency of the actuator depends upon {{the position of the}} piston in the cylinder. This is a close match with theoretical and simulation results. The effect of bulk modulus is also presented in the paper...|$|E

For some of these applications the servovalve must meet stringent dynamic performance criteria while under the influence of external disturbances. The most common of these external disturbances is vibration. Vibration can not only have an affect on valve performance, but can also affect valve stability. This thesis deals with the development of a dynamic model of the amplifier lines and line orifice of a two stage servovalve.

The results of the model simulations for known stable and unstable configurations are discussed. Recommendations for usage are also presented...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the requirements of}} a control system for active turbine tip clearance control in a generic commercial turbofan engine through design and analysis. The control objective is to articulate the shroud in the high pressure turbine section {{in order to maintain}} a certain clearance set point given several possible engine transient events. The system must also exhibit reasonable robustness to modeling uncertainties and reasonable noise rejection properties. Two actuators were chosen to fulfill such a requirement, both of which possess different levels of technological readiness: <b>electrohydraulic</b> <b>servovalves</b> and piezoelectric stacks. Identification of design constraints, desired actuator parameters, and actuator limitations are addressed in depth; all of which are intimately tied with the hardware and controller design process. Analytical demonstrations of the performance and robustness characteristics of the two axisymmetric LQG clearance control systems are presented. Takeoff simulation results show that both actuators are capable of maintaining the clearance within acceptable bounds and demonstrate robustness to parameter uncertainty. The present model-based control strategy was employed to demonstrate the tradeoff between performance, control effort, and robustness and to implement optimal state estimation in a noisy engine environment with intent to eliminate ad hoc methods for designing reliable control systems...|$|R

40|$|The {{results of}} the Independent Orbiter Assessment (IOA) of the Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) and Critical Items List (CIL) are presented. The IOA {{approach}} features a top-down analysis of the hardware to determine failure modes, criticality, and potential critical items. To preserve independence, this analysis was accomplished without reliance upon the results contained within the NASA FMEA/CIL documentation. The independent analysis results for the Ascent Thrust Vector Control (ATVC) Actuator hardware are documented. The function of the Ascent Thrust Vector Control Actuators (ATVC) is to gimbal the main engines to provide for attitude and flight path control during ascent. During first stage flight, the SRB nozzles provide nearly all the steering. After SRB separation, the Orbiter is steered by gimbaling of its main engines. There are six electrohydraulic servoactuators, one pitch and one yaw {{for each of the}} three main engines. Each servoactuator is composed of four <b>electrohydraulic</b> <b>servovalve</b> assemblies, one second stage power spool valve assembly, one primary piston assembly and a switching valve. Each level of hardware was evaluated and analyzed for possible failure modes and effects. Criticality was assigned based upon the severity of the effect for each failure mode. Critical failures resulting in loss of ATVC were mainly due to loss of hydraulic fluid, fluid contamination and mechanical failures...|$|E

The Design Matrix (DM) illustrates the independence among the Functional Requirements (FRs) and the Design Parameters (DPs). The ultimate goal is the design of a fully independent suspension system in which the FRs stiffness, ride height, and damping can be varied as needed. To achieve the three FRs, three DPs are chosen - the volume of an air spring for stiffness, the volume of fluid in a fluid chamber for ride height, and orifice control for damping. This thesis investigates two DPs in depth, the air spring and fluid chamber. The nonlinearity of the air spring is studied and its effect on the system as a whole is simulated in Simulink. Two control systems are proposed in which stiffness and ride height are kept constant. The desired values for stiffness and ride height are predetermined by the user or by an optimization algorithm. The physical design for the control systems is also proposed in this thesis. The design for the air spring system uses an electropneumatic design, and the design for the fluid chamber system uses an <b>electrohydraulic</b> <b>servovalve</b> design. by Way Luu. Thesis (S. B.)
