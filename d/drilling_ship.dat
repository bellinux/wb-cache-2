5|$|Strengthening {{faster than}} anticipated, Gay {{attained}} typhoon status early on 3 November. Later that day, the storm developed an eye before passing over the Seacrest, an oil <b>drilling</b> <b>ship.</b> On 4 November, Gay's winds increased to 185km/h (115mph), {{equivalent to a}} Category3 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale, before making landfall in Chumphon Province, Thailand, at 0600UTC. The Japan Meteorological Agency assessed that the storm had ten-minute sustained winds of 140km/h (85mph) and a pressure of 960mbar (hPa; 28.35inHg). Crossing the Kra Isthmus, Gay weakened to minimal typhoon status as it entered the Bay of Bengal. According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), Gay was the first typhoon since 1891 to form in the Gulf of Thailand and enter the Bay of Bengal. Responding to a ridge to its north, Gay maintained a west-northwestward to northwestward track {{for the next four}} days. The storm gradually restrengthened as it moved through an area of low wind shear and warm waters; however, this was limited by restrictions to the cyclone's outflow. Early on November6, Gay passed near the Andaman Islands as a Category2-equivalent cyclone.|$|E

500|$|The most {{powerful}} storm {{to affect the}} Gulf of Thailand in more than 35years, Gay produced [...] swells that caught many ships in the region off-guard. At least 16 vessels were reported missing by 5 November, including the [...] Unocal Corporation oil <b>drilling</b> <b>ship</b> Seacrest. According to survivors, the vessel received no warning of the developing typhoon. Just when all crew members were about to abandon ship, the eye of Typhoon Gay passed over. Winds fluctuated violently and changed direction, preventing the ship from remaining stabilized despite being within safe operating limits. The vessel abruptly capsized with all 97 crew members on board during the overnight hours of 3 November, before any life boats could be deployed. Initial rescue attempts on 4 November were hampered by rough seas. Two days after the sinking, four rescue ships and two helicopters in the region were searching for survivors; four people were rescued from the wreckage on 6 November. Divers from the Thai Navy were sent to search the capsized vessel for anyone trapped inside. Of the crew, only 6 survived; 25 bodies were recovered, and the remaining 66 members were presumed dead. Losses from {{the sinking of the}} Seacrest totaled $40million. Another 20 cargo and fishing ships sank during the storm, resulting in 140 fatalities.|$|E
