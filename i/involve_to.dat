2500|$|Up to 600 pro-Tibet {{protesters were}} {{expected}} to attend the relay, along with between 2,000 and 10,000 Chinese supporters. Taking note of {{the high number of}} Chinese supporters, Ted Quinlan, head of the Canberra torch relay committee, said: [...] "We didn't expect this reaction from the Chinese community. It is obviously a well-coordinated plan to take the day by weight of numbers. But we have assurances that it will be done peacefully.". Also, Australia's ACT Chief Minister, Jon Stanhope confirmed that the Chinese embassy was closely <b>involve</b> <b>to</b> ensure that [...] "pro-China demonstrators vastly outnumbered Tibetan activists." [...] Australian freestyle swimmer and five-time Olympic gold medalist Ian Thorpe ended the Australian leg of the torch relay April 24, 2008, touching the flame to light a cauldron after a run that was only marginally marked by protests. People demonstrated both for China and for Tibet. At least five people were arrested during the torch relay. Police said [...] "the five were arrested for interfering with the event under special powers enacted in the wake of massive protests against Chinese policy toward Tibet." [...] At one point, groups of Chinese students surrounded and intimidated pro-Tibet protesters. One person had to be pulled aboard a police launch when a group of pro-Chinese students looked like they might force him into the lake.|$|E

60|$|In {{the mean}} time, the Protestant cause was making {{progress}} in Scotland too, {{by its own}} inherent energies, and against {{the influence of the}} government. Finally, the Scotch Protestants organized themselves, and commenced an open rebellion against the regent whom Mary had left in power while she was away. They sent to Elizabeth to come and aid them. Mary and her friends in France sent French troops to assist the government. Elizabeth hesitated very much whether to comply with the request of the rebels. It is very dangerous for a sovereign to countenance rebellion in any way. Then she shrunk, too, from the expense which she foresaw that such an attempt would <b>involve.</b> <b>To</b> fit out a fleet, and to levy and equip an army, and to continue the forces thus raised in action during a long and uncertain campaign, would cost a large sum of money, and Elizabeth was constitutionally economical and frugal. But then, on the other hand, as she deliberated upon the affair long and, anxiously, both alone and with her council, she thought that, if she should so far succeed as to get the government of Scotland into her power, she could compel Mary to renounce forever all claims to the English crown, by threatening her, if she would not do it, with the loss of her own.|$|E
6000|$|I {{believe that}} inquirers have ascertained, that, {{as a general}} rule, the {{practice}} of polygamy has not the effect of bringing about an abnormal growth of population. However this may be elsewhere, in Natal, owing in great measure to the healthy customs of the Zulu race,[*] {{the rate of increase}} is unprecedented. Many writers and other authorities consider polygamy as an institution, to be at once wicked and disgusting. As to its morality, it is a point upon which it is difficult to express any opinion, nor, indeed, does the question enter into the scope of what I have to say; but it must be remembered {{that in the case of}} the Zulu his whole law and existence is mixed up with the institution, and that it is necessary to him to repair the gaps made in his ranks by war. Violent anti-polygamists in this country always make a strong point of the cruelty it is supposed to <b>involve</b> <b>to</b> the women, and talk about the [...] "violation of their holiest feelings." [...] As a matter of fact, sad as it may appear, the Zulu women are much attached to the custom, nor would they, as a general rule, consent to marry a man who only purposed taking one wife. There are various reasons for this: for instance, the first wife is a person of importance, and takes precedence of all the others, a fact as much appreciated by the Zulu woman as by the London lady. Again, the more wives there are, the more wealth it brings into the family, since in the ordinary course of nature more wives mean more female children, who, when they come to a marriageable age, mean in their turn at least ten cows each (the Government price for a wife). The amount thus obtained is placed to the credit of the estate of the mother of the girl married, and for this reason all Zulu women are extremely anxious to have children, especially female children. Finally, the liking of Zulu women for the custom is bred in them. It has been going on for countless generations, and it is probable that it will go on for so long as the race endures. Nations do not change such habits unless the change is forced on them, with the alternative of extermination.|$|E

50|$|CD is {{not only}} a {{gastrointestinal}} disease, because it may <b>involve</b> <b>to</b> several organs and cause an extensive variety of non-gastrointestinal symptoms, and most importantly, it may often be completely asymptomatic. Added difficulties for diagnosis are the fact that serological markers (anti-tissue transglutaminase TG2) are not always present and many patients may have minor mucosal lesions, without atrophy of the intestinal villi. Diagnosis of CD should be based on a combination of patientâ€™s familial history, genetics (i.e. presence of HLA DQ2/DQ8) serology and intestinal histology.|$|E
