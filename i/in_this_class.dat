5|$|Aggressive mimicry {{is found}} in predators (or parasites) that share the same {{characteristics}} as a harmless species, allowing them to avoid detection by their prey (or host). The mimic may resemble the prey or host itself, or another organism that is either neutral or beneficial to the signal receiver. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>class</b> of mimicry, the model may be affected negatively, positively or not at all. Just as parasites can {{be treated as a}} form of predator, host-parasite mimicry is treated here as a subclass of aggressive mimicry.|$|E

25|$|The {{use of a}} sighted guide {{by people}} <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>class</b> is {{dependent}} on the specific requirements of the sport. Guides are used in para-alpine and para-Nordic skiing. Guides for B2 and B3 skiers often position themselves differently from for B1 skiers as the skiers <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>class</b> have some vision, which means the things a guide assists with will be different from what is required of a skier who has almost no sight. The guide may ski in front of the skier and use visual cues to inform the skier of what is ahead of them on the course. For cyclists <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>class,</b> a guide is used with the guide sitting at the front of a tandem bicycle.|$|E
25|$|Skiers <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>class</b> include 2006 New Zealand Winter Paralympian Anthony Field, Germany's Thomas Oelsner and Australia's Mitchell Gourley.|$|E
