50|$|When {{the bill}} of lading {{is used as a}} <b>document</b> <b>of</b> <b>title,</b> it is {{particularly}} related to the case of buyer. When the buyer is entitled to received goods from the carrier, bill of lading in this case performs as <b>document</b> <b>of</b> <b>title</b> for the goods. There are two types of bill of lading that can perform as <b>document</b> <b>of</b> <b>title.</b> They are straight bill of lading and order bill of lading. Straight bill of lading is a bill of lading issued to a named consignee that is not negotiable. In this case, {{the bill of}} lading should be directed only to one specific consignee indicated on the bill of lading. Order bill of lading is the opposite from a straight bill of lading and there is no specific or named consignee. Therefore, an order bill of lading can be negotiated to a third party.|$|R

5000|$|Bills of lading {{and other}} <b>documents</b> <b>of</b> <b>title,</b> which {{are governed by}} Article 7 of the Code. However, under {{admiralty}} law, a bill of lading may either be a negotiable or 'order' bill of lading or a nonnegotiable or 'straight' bill of lading.|$|E
50|$|The law {{relating}} to perfection of security interests by taking of possession {{can sometimes be}} confused with the law {{relating to}} the granting of security interests, which provides that the deposit of certain assets (usually <b>documents</b> <b>of</b> <b>title)</b> can amount to an equitable mortgage of the goods.|$|E
40|$|As far as {{the nature}} of a {{straight}} bill of lading is concerned, a straight bill of lading is a <b>document</b> <b>of</b> <b>title.</b> On the contrary, the SWB does not belong to a <b>document</b> <b>of</b> <b>title.</b> Therefore, releasing the goods with production of straight bills of lading does not make any exceptions. However, the regulations of the applicable law to the contracts of carriage, the stipulations of the bill of lading, and the enforcement of the right of control to cargo of the shipper shall be taking into account as well. </p...|$|R
50|$|An {{air waybill}} (AWB) or air {{consignment}} note is a receipt issued by an international airline for goods and an evidence of the contract of carriage, {{but it is not}} a <b>document</b> <b>of</b> <b>title</b> to the goods. Hence, the air waybill is non-negotiable.|$|R

5000|$|In June 1804, the slave's owner {{sought to}} reclaim him. Harrington demanded {{proof that the}} {{claimant}} did indeed own the slave. The owner produced bills of sale for both the slave and the slave's mother. Judge Harrington said that the <b>documents</b> <b>of</b> <b>title</b> did {{not go far enough}} back in time. [...] When the owner asked what proof of ownership the judge would accept, Judge Harrington replied, [...] "Nothing short of a bill of sale signed by God Almighty Himself." [...] Justices Royall Tyler and Jonathan Robinson concurred, and the slave was set free.|$|E
5000|$|A factor, Latin for [...] "doer, maker" [...] (from Latin facit, [...] "he/she/it does/makes"), is a mercantile {{fiduciary}} {{who receives}} and sells goods on commission (called factorage), transacting business {{in his own}} name and not disclosing his principal, and historically with his seat at a factory (trading post). A factor differs from a commission merchant in that a factor takes possession of goods (or <b>documents</b> <b>of</b> <b>title</b> representing goods) on consignment, whereas a commission merchant sells goods not in his possession {{on the basis of}} samples. Most modern factor business is in the textile field, but factors are also used to a great extent in the shoe, furniture, hardware, and other industries, and the trade areas in which factors operate have increased.|$|E
5000|$|... "A {{delivery}} order was not {{regarded as a}} document of title at common law {{with the result that}} the transfer of the {{delivery order}} did not effect transfer of constructive possession of the goods. Attornment {{on the part of the}} bailee was required (i.e., an acknowledgement that the bailee held the goods on behalf of the transferee). The Uniform <b>Documents</b> <b>of</b> <b>Title</b> Act permits the use of negotiable delivery orders (if the order directs delivery to a named person or order). However, it is still necessary to single out delivery orders for special treatment. Until the delivery order is accepted by the bailee, there is no basi for imposing obligations on the bailee.

50|$|However, most {{personal}} property items {{do not have}} a formal <b>document</b> <b>of</b> <b>title.</b> For such items, possession is the simplest indication <b>of</b> <b>title,</b> unless the circumstances give rise to suspicion about the possessor's ownership of the item. Proof of legal acquisition, such as a bill of sale or purchase receipt, is contributory. Transfer of possession to a good faith purchaser will normally convey title if no document is required.|$|R
5000|$|Adopting the {{standard}} section 1 definition of theft {{would require a}} dishonest appropriation of the conveyance with intent to permanently deprive the owner. There will therefore be little difficulty in prosecuting as theft situations where the stolen car is later sold (sometimes {{through a process of}} 'ringing' i.e. its identity is changed and forged <b>documents</b> <b>of</b> <b>title</b> produced) or broken for spare parts, because the evidence of an intent permanently to deprive is clear. But the twoccing situation usually describes joyriding where all that is intended is an unauthorised use {{for a short period of}} time. Alternatively, it covers situations where a vehicle is taken for the purposes of another offence, e.g. it is to be used to escape after a bank robbery and then abandoned.

50|$|In {{countries}} with a sophisticated private property system, <b>documents</b> <b>of</b> <b>title</b> {{are commonly used}} for real estate, motor vehicles, and some types of intangible property. When such documents are used, they are often part of a registration system whereby ownership of such property can be verified. In some cases, a title can {{also serve as a}} permanent legal record of condemnation of property, such {{as in the case of}} an automobile junk or salvage title. In the case of real estate, the legal instrument used to transfer title is the deed. A famous rule is that a thief cannot convey good title, so title searches are routine (or highly recommended) for purchases of many types of expensive property (especially real estate). In several counties and municipalities in the US a standard title search (generally accompanied by title insurance) is required under the law as a part of ownership transfer.|$|E
50|$|An {{important}} aspect of the warehouse credit providing business is limiting fraud on warehouse lending. Main risks of fraud include dishonest and collusive mortgage loan originators, title companies, real estate agents and customers themselves, false information in the loan application (especially appraisals), forged signatures on the loan documents, and false <b>documents</b> <b>of</b> <b>title.</b> The 'Wet funding' type of warehouse credit is riskier in terms of possible fraud because the credit provider will not be aware of any potential problems until after the funds are sent to the loan originator. Measures that the warehouse lender can take to limit fraud can be a strong screening process for mortgage brokers and mortgage banking companies, making sure the loan originator itself has a strong internal screening process, limiting the amount available for 'wet funding', and having separate account for funds coming from sale of loans to investors.|$|E
50|$|The Uniform Commercial Code §7-603 {{adopted in}} all 50 {{of the states}} of the United States {{provides}} that a bailee when more than one person claims title to or possession of the goods under <b>document</b> <b>of</b> <b>title</b> (warehouse receipt or bill of lading) may bring an interpleader as an original action or as a defense to a suit for nondelivery.|$|R
50|$|Lickbarrow v Mason ((1788), 2 T. R. 63 and (1794) 5 TR 683) {{refers to}} an English legal case {{in which it was}} {{determined}} that a shipped bill of lading is a <b>document</b> <b>of</b> <b>title</b> at common law i.e. a document which can be owned and therefore the ownership of it could be sold or otherwise transferred to someone else.|$|R
50|$|In a time-charterparty or voyage-charterparty, if the {{charterer}} is shipping his own cargo (rather {{than the}} cargo {{of a third}} party) he will receive a bill of lading from the master, acting as agent of the shipowner; but that B/L will serve solely as a receipt and <b>document</b> <b>of</b> <b>title,</b> and its terms will (subject to contrary intent) be secondary {{to the terms of}} the charterparty, which remains the dominant contract.|$|R
5000|$|A {{straight}} {{bill of lading}} by land or sea, or {{air waybill}} are not <b>documents</b> <b>of</b> <b>title</b> to the goods they represent. They do no more than require delivery of the goods to the named consignee and (subject to the shipper's ability to redirect the goods) to no other. This differs from an [...] "order" [...] or [...] "bearer" [...] bill of lading which are possessory title documents and negotiable, i.e. they can be endorsed and so transfer the right to take delivery to the last endorsee. This aspect of shipping law is regulated by the Hague Rules, and the laws of individual countries, e.g. the UK Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1992 and the U.S. Pomerene Act 1916. There is some international dispute as to whether the consignee on a straight bill must produce the bill in order to take delivery. The U.S. position is that the person taking delivery must prove his or her identity but, as in Hong Kong, {{there is no need to}} present the bill itself. In the UK there are conflicting obiter dicta in [...] "The Rafaela S" [...] 2003 2 Lloyd's Rep. 113 and [...] "The Happy Ranger" [...] 2002 2 AER (Comm) 23, so the matter must remain unclear even though there are serious problems, for example, arising from the everyday occurrence of cargo being discharged against letters of indemnity when original bills of lading are not yet available to be presented at the discharge port.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the medieval}} period {{substantial}} landowners {{made use of}} dedicated chambers known as [...] "muniments rooms" [...] for the secure storage of muniments of title. Before the advent of capitalism and the stock-market investment, the ownership of land and operational manors was the principal asset used by the English gentry for the long-term storage of wealth. It was essential to prove [...] "devolution of title" [...] to an estate, which necessitated the retention of every historical deed which had been used at some time over decades if not centuries to transfer legal ownership of that estate. For example, {{if it had been}} determined historically {{in a court of law}} that [...] "person X" [...] had good title to an estate at some past date, the present owner, in order to have equally good title, needed to prove that he had obtained, in a valid manner, the asset directly or indirectly from person X. For example, if a royal charter survived granting a manor to person X, that would constitute an ideal starting point from which to prove devolution of title. Thus several charters, indentures, entails, marriage settlements and last will and testaments of varying dates and contained within several sheets of parchment might form the complete devolution of title for just one estate. Many gentry families in England held particular estates for many centuries (the Berkeley family has held Berkeley Castle since the 12th century and holds it still in 2015), generating a large volume of <b>documents</b> <b>of</b> <b>title</b> as the estate passed down the generations of the family. Such often large and highly verbose documents were generally folded up to form small packets and were then sealed with wax, with an epitome or summary of the document written in ink on the finished packet.|$|E

The sea waybill has appeared as a substitute for the bill of lading and, despite its nature as a nonnegotiable document, it can be employed in a manner which allows it to provide collateral security to banks. Multimodal transport documents which may be issued in negotiable or non-negotiable form assume the same legal role as the bill oflading or sea waybill respectively. The inclusion of specific articles in the 1993 Revision of the UCP relating to non-negotiable sea waybills and multimodal transport documents affirms their acceptability to banks financing international sales contracts under documentary letters of credit.
