40|$|AbstractPlant genome {{possesses}} over 100 protein phosphatase (PPase) {{genes that}} are key regulators of signal transduction via phosphorylation/dephosphorylation event. Here we report a comprehensive functional analysis of protein serine/threonine, dual-specificity and tyrosine phosphatases using recombinant PPases produced by wheat cell-free protein synthesis system. Eighty-two recombinant PPases were successfully produced using Arabidopsis full-length cDNA as templates. In vitro PPase assay was performed using phosphorylated myelin basic protein as substrate. Among the AtPPases examined, 26 serine/threonine, three dual-specificity and one tyrosine PPases exhibited catalytic activity, including 20 serine/threonine and one dual-specificity PPases that showed in vitro {{activities for the}} first time. Our study demonstrates genome-wide biochemical analysis of AtPPases using wheat cell-free system, and provides new information and insights on enzyme activities.
