However, information supply to decision-makers varies extensively across <b>interest</b> <b>groups.</b> How can this be explained? Why do some <b>interest</b> <b>groups</b> provide more information than others? I argue that variation in information supply can largely be explained by organizational characteristics, more specifically the resources, the functional differentiation, the professionalization and the decentralization of <b>interest</b> <b>groups.</b> I test my theoretical expectations based on a large new dataset: Using multilevel modeling, I examine information supply to the European Commission across 56 policy issues and {{a wide range of}} <b>interest</b> <b>groups</b> by combining an analysis of consultation submissions with a survey conducted among <b>interest</b> <b>groups...</b>|$|R

Even when these forms of relationship are inevitable and they are playing a crucial role in public policy decision-making. The problem of the project’s – how and to what extent do Kaunas City LSDP Department and <b>interest</b> <b>groups</b> relationship or not relationship? The project’s object is – political parties, <b>interest</b> <b>groups</b> and relationship between them. The subject of this project’s is the relationship between Kaunas City LSDP Department and <b>interest</b> <b>groups.</b> The project’s aim – to examine the relationship between Kaunas City LSDP Department and <b>interest</b> <b>groups.</b> The objectives of the project: to analyse theoretical aspects of the relationship between political parties and interest groups; to prepare the research methodology of the relationship between Kaunas City LSDP Department and interest groups; to typologise <b>interest</b> <b>groups</b> active in Kaunas; to create of Kaunas City LSDP Department and <b>interest</b> <b>groups</b> relationship model. The methods used are: analysis of scientific literature, analysis of documents, descriptive statistics, and semi-structured interview. The first chapter discusses and systemises information about the concept of relationship between political parties and <b>interest</b> <b>groups,</b> functions, types, etc. The key differences and similarities are identified. Also, the features of relationship between political parties and <b>interest</b> <b>groups</b> are analyses, and reviewed relations of the Social Democratic Party with <b>interest</b> <b>groups.</b> The second chapter presents the empirical research methodology. The third chapter provides the results of the empirical study. This chapter presents LSDP and its Kaunas City Department. It identifies social democratic provisions in relation to <b>interest</b> <b>groups</b> and typologises <b>interest</b> <b>groups</b> active in Kaunas. It was also revealed how and to what extent Kaunas City LSDP Department and <b>interest</b> <b>groups</b> do (not) relationship. The study showed that social democrats cannot imagine the process of decision-making, democratic development and welfare creation without the involvement of various <b>interest</b> <b>groups.</b> It turned out that in Kaunas, out of all <b>interest</b> <b>groups,</b> 320 met the criteria (having a website, and (or) insured employees). It was also established that Kaunas City LSDP Department and <b>interest</b> <b>groups</b> active in Kaunas (LAEA, ZUR, KCPDS and so on.) are connected. With the help of meetings, events, memorandums of agreements and other ways of relationship, these relations are created and maintained...|$|R
5|$|As {{the number}} of works {{featuring}} LGBT characters increased, so did the visibility of LGBT fans.

However, such meetings did not necessarily indicate whole-hearted acceptance within the fan community, and gay and lesbian fans were not regarded as a unified <b>interest</b> <b>group.</b> Informal gatherings at conferences and the attempted creation of a newsletter for LGBT fans drew little notice.|$|E

In academic work as well, {{social partners}} seem {{most of the time}} to be treated distinctively from other <b>interest</b> <b>groups,</b> because of their particular features regarding State-society relations.

This paper's purpose is to identify what are the differences and similarities between social partners and <b>interest</b> <b>groups</b> in order to determine to what extent it is possible to study social partners through the lens of <b>interest</b> <b>groups</b> and if such approach might be relevant.

5|$|Belgium {{has seven}} nuclear {{reactors}} that provide about 52% of its electricity. Belgian {{spent nuclear fuel}} was initially sent for reprocessing in France. In 1993, reprocessing was suspended following {{a resolution of the}} Belgian parliament; spent fuel is since being stored on the sites of the nuclear power plants. The deep disposal of high-level radioactive waste (HLW) has been studied in Belgium for more than 30 years. Boom Clay is studied as a reference host formation for HLW disposal. The Hades underground research laboratory (URL) is located at −223 m in the Boom Formation at the Mol site. The Belgian URL is operated by the Euridice Economic <b>Interest</b> <b>Group,</b> a joint organisation between SCK•CEN, the Belgian Nuclear Research Centre which initiated the research on waste disposal in Belgium in the 1970s and 1980s and ONDRAF/NIRAS, the Belgian agency for radioactive waste management.

5|$|Studies on induced animal {{models of}} human diseases. Here, an animal is treated {{so that it}} {{develops}} pathology and symptoms that resemble a human disease. Examples include restricting {{blood flow to the}} brain to induce stroke, or giving neurotoxins that cause damage similar to that seen in Parkinson's disease. Such studies can be difficult to interpret, and it is argued that they are not always comparable to human diseases. For example, although such models are now widely used to study Parkinson's disease, the British anti-vivisection <b>interest</b> <b>group</b> BUAV argues that these models only superficially resemble the disease symptoms, without the same time course or cellular pathology. In contrast, scientists assessing the usefulness of animal models of Parkinson's disease, as well as the medical research charity The Parkinson's Appeal, state that these models were invaluable and that they led to improved surgical treatments such as pallidotomy, new drug treatments such as levodopa, and later deep brain stimulation.|$|E
5|$|The {{baguette}} sandwiches {{were introduced}} to Europe starting in the UK in 2003, with several new varieties designed to cater to the population mix of the country. While the baguette sandwiches were well received {{and continue to be}} sold, several red flags have been raised by the British government and private groups in regards the healthiness of these and other products sold by the fast food industry. In 2005, British Food Standards Agency (FSA) cited large levels of fats and salt in the company's beef-based Monterey Melt baguette and chided BK for backing out of an agreement to help make the company's products healthier. In 2007 the private public <b>interest</b> <b>group</b> Consensus Action on Salt and Health, abbreviated to CASH, cited Burger King and other fast food chains over the continued levels of sodium contained in these types of foods. The group specifically claimed that the Chicken BLT Baguette sandwich, when paired with fries and a Coca-Cola, was one of the three saltiest fast food products in the UK.|$|E

40|$|In 1971, {{there were}} at least 49 <b>Interest</b> <b>groups</b> in Minnesota with major Water and related land {{resources}} programs, 4 Leagues and Associations with minor water and related land resources programs, at least 80 organizations that tend to have a continuing interest in water and related land resources issues, and at least 150 National organizations concerned with water and related land resources programs which have or could have members in the State. The Minnesota Senate 1971 registration files for lobbyists listed 1 lO lobbyists in the field of water and related land resources; the House files listed 138 lobbyists. Personnel of State agencies were among these lobbyists. Of the 53 <b>Interest</b> <b>groups</b> (49 <b>Interests</b> <b>groups</b> and 4 Leagues and Associations mentioned above), 40 were conservation-preservation oriented, 8 had the word environmental in their name, and 5 were development and management oriented.

40|$|Bibliography: p. 191 - 205. This {{dissertation}} {{seeks to}} determine how the socio-economic and political changes, following the 1989 revolutions in Central Europe, have found reflection and led to the emergence of <b>interest</b> <b>groups</b> in the education debate. It looks at the reforms initiated by the new ruling. power-elite in Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia. This reform process, embodying the value system of the new governments, has led, the dissertation seeks to show, directly to new and vibrant <b>interest</b> <b>groups</b> on the educational landscape. This study identifies the seven prominent <b>interest</b> <b>groups</b> - seeking to satisfy their own interests - which engage the government in the education policy making arena. This policy making arena, which I refer to as the "arena of power", is analysed through focussing on the relationship of power between the seven <b>interest</b> <b>groups</b> and the state. The Halasz (1986 : 123) classification of <b>interest</b> <b>groups</b> in communist Hungary in 1986, forms the point of departure for my examination of post- 1989 <b>interest</b> <b>groups.</b> Each chapter highlights the circumstances that influenced the development of <b>interest</b> <b>groups</b> and the extent of their participation in reforms. The dissertation concludes with a reclassification of post- 1989 <b>interest</b> <b>groups</b> in Central Europe, in order to facilitate {{a better understanding of the}} dynamics of <b>interest</b> <b>groups</b> in the "arena of power"...|$|R
5|$|The {{program had}} some loose ends that {{manifested}} themselves later. Many refugees were not economically integrated and lived from government handouts. Critics {{noted that the}} refugees had become a special <b>interest</b> <b>group</b> that fostered resentment. The COMIGAL officials often decided not to split up refugees belonging to the same village, hoping to maintain social continuity. In some cases, Catholic priests refused to obey government directives to settle in certain areas. Many of the refugees also refused to relocate from the camps {{on the outskirts of}} the capital, wanting to live an urban lifestyle, and objecting to Diem's desire that they help developed inhospitable frontier territory where disease was more common and the economy less developed. On occasions, the reluctance to disperse away from Saigon resulted in protests outside Diem's residence. Many Catholic villages were effectively transplanted into southern territory. This was efficient in the short run but meant that they would never assimilate into southern society. They had little contact with the Buddhist majority and often held them in contempt, sometimes flying the Vatican flag instead of the national flag. Peter Hansen, an Australian Catholic priest and academic scholar of religion, has added that tensions between northern and southern Catholics were also present, due to issues of regionalism and local traditions. Hansen also said that northern Catholics took a more defensive attitude towards other religions than their southern co-religionists, and were more likely to see non-Catholics as a threat. He further noted that northern Catholics had a more theocratic outlook in that they were more willing to listen to the advice of priests on a wide range of issues, not only spiritual and ecclesiastical matters. These differences and the sense of segregation persist to the current day.|$|E
