[...] According to this argument, if it is not known for certain whether something (such as the fetus) has a right to life, then it is reckless, and morally wrong, to treat that thing as if it lacks a right to life (for example by killing it). [...] This would place abortion in the same moral category as manslaughter (<b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>turns</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> the fetus has a right to life) or certain forms of criminal negligence (<b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>turns</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> the fetus does not have a right to life).|$|E

2500|$|Entomologists from Ivan Regen onward {{have agreed}} that the {{principal}} purpose of a male cricket's [...] "song" [...] is to attract females for mating. Berthold Laufer and Frank Lutz recognized the fact but noted {{that it was not}} clear why males do it continuously throughout most of their adult lives, when actual mating doesn't take much time. More is known about the attractive mechanism of a cricket's song. Scientists exposed cricket females to synthesized [...] "cricket songs", carefully varying different acoustic parameters, and measured the degree of females' response to different sounds. They found that although each species has its own optimal mating call, the repetition rate of chirp [...] "syllables" [...] was the single most important parameter. A male's singing skills do not guarantee him instant success: other, silent, males may be waiting nearby to intercept the females he attracts. Other males may be attracted by the song and rush to the singer just as females do. When another cricket confronts a singing male, the two insects determine each other's sex by touching their antennae. <b>If</b> <b>it</b> <b>turns</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> both crickets are male, the contact leads to a fight. Crickets, and Orthoptera in general, are model organisms for the study of male-male aggression, although females can also be aggressive. According to Judge and Bonanno, the shape and size of male crickets' heads are a direct result of selection through male-male fights.|$|E

You know how it is in these little chats, Comrade Jackson. One leaps to conclusions. Some casual word I happened to drop may have given him the idea you mention.
