40|$|Thesis (M.

Secondary pathologies associated with obesity include sleep apnea, diabetes and heart disease. Researchers estimate the incidence of obesity to be 17 % {{of the population in}} the United States and rising. The etiology of obesity stems from the continued daily accumulation of excess calories over a period of time. The primary treatments for this condition are exercise and calorie restriction. Exercise is underutilized and not well understood by health care providers. Proper exercise prescription implementation is essential in the effective treatment of obesity...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Excess {{body fat}} {{is a major}} risk factor for disease {{primarily}} due to its endocrine activity. In recent years several criteria have been introduced to evaluate this factor. Nevertheless, treatment need is currently assessed only {{on the basis of}} an individual's Body Mass Index (BMI), calculated as body weight (in kg) divided by <b>height</b> <b>in</b> <b>m</b> 2. The aim of our study was to determine whether application of the BMI, compared to adiposity-based criteria, results in underestimation of the number of subjects needing lifestyle intervention. Methods We compared treatment need based on BMI classification with four adiposity-based criteria: percentage body fat (%BF), considered both alone and in relation to metabolic syndrome risk (MS), waist circumference (WC), as an index of abdominal fat, and Body Fat Mass Index (BFMI, calculated as fat mass in kg divided by <b>height</b> <b>in</b> <b>m</b> 2) in 63 volunteers (23 men and 40 women, aged 20 – 65 years). Results According to the classification based on BMI, 6. 3 % of subjects were underweight, 52. 4 % were normal weight, 30. 2 % were overweight, and 11. 1 % were obese. Agreement between the BMI categories and the other classification criteria categories varied; the most notable discrepancy emerged in the underweight and overweight categories. BMI compared to almost all of the other adiposity-based criteria, identified a lower percentage of subjects for whom treatment would be recommended. In particular, the proportion of subjects for whom clinicians would strongly recommend weight loss {{on the basis of their}} BMI (11. 1 %) was significantly lower than those identified according to WC (25. 4 %, p = 0. 004), %BF (28. 6 %, p = 0. 003), and MS (33. 9 %, p = 0. 002). Conclusion The use of the BMI alone, as opposed to an assessment based on body composition, to identify individuals needing lifestyle intervention may lead to unfortunate misclassifications. Population-specific data on the relationships between body composition, morbidity, and mortality are needed to improve the diagnosis and treatment of at-risk individuals. </p...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The biomass carbon (C) {{stock of}} forests {{is one of}} key {{parameters}} {{for the study of}} regional and global carbon cycles. Literature reviews shows that inventory-based forest C stocks documented for major countries in the middle and high northern latitudes fall within a narrow range of 36 – 56 Mg C ha− 1 with an overall area-weighted mean of 43. 6 Mg C ha− 1. These estimates are 0. 40 to 0. 71 times smaller than those (61 – 108 Mg C ha− 1) used in previous analysis of balancing the global carbon budget. A statistical analysis, using the global forest biomass database, implies that aboveground biomass per hectare is proportional to forest mean height [biomass in Mg/ha = 10. 63 (<b>height</b> <b>in</b> <b>m)</b> ] in closed-canopy forests in the study regions, indicating that forest height can be a proxy of regional biomass C stocks. The narrow range of C stocks is likely a result of similar forest height across the northern regions. The lower biomass C stock obtained in this study strongly suggests that the role of the northern forests in the global carbon cycle needs to be re-evaluated. Our findings also suggest that regional estimates of biomass could be readily made from the use of satellite methods such as lidar that can measure forest canopy height over large regions. 1...|$|E
40|$|Large {{grounded}} ice features {{can be found}} in all regions of the world where there is moving ice. This paper compiles over 230 reported ice pile-ups from several international locations including the Baltic Sea, Gulf of Bothnia, Caspian Sea, Lake Simcoe, Stonehaven Harbour (New Brunswick), west Newfoundland, Alaskan and Canadian Beaufort Sea, Norton Sound, Bering Sea, Somerset Island and offshore Sakhalin. The NRC Particle-in-Cell numerical model is used to augment the data. A plot of the rubble sail height {{as a function of the}} ice block thickness shows considerable scatter but a general increase in sail height with increasing ice thickness. The scatter in the data is real and is attributed to the fact that the conditions for producing the maximum sail height are not met in most situations. An upper bound of the data can be represented by Hs,max = 19 hB 0. 33 where Hs,max is the maximum pile-up <b>height</b> (<b>in</b> <b>m),</b> and hB is the block ice thickness (in m). This equation covers the data range up to 2 m in ice thickness. The data also clearly show that high pile-ups (on the order of 10 to 12 m high) can be generated from thin ice less than 0. 5 m thick. Further, sail heights up to 30 m are possible for thicker sea ice. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|E

40|$|Fewer data on {{tree biomass}} and {{allometric}} equations {{are available in}} African tropical moist forests than in the other tropical continents. When needing a biomass allometric equation, one thus faces the dilemma of using either a pantropical equation with the risk that it is biased for Africa, or a site-specific equation that is imprecise. Using a data set on aboveground biomass for 101 trees destructively measured at Zadié in northeastern Gabon, we fitted site-specific allometric equations and assessed the validity of ten existing equations. The best fitted model without height as a predictor was: B=exp[- 4. 0596 + 4. 0624 lnD- 0. 228 (lnD) 2 + 1. 4307 ln?], whereas the best fitted model with height was: B=exp[- 2. 5680 + 0. 9517 ln(D 2 H) + 1. 1891 ln?], where B is the aboveground biomass in kg, D the diameter at breast height in cm, H the <b>height</b> <b>in</b> <b>m,</b> and ? the wood density in g cm? 3. Separate allometric equations for the stem, stump, foliage and branches were also fitted. Chave et al. (2005) 's pantropical equations for moist forests, that are currently {{the most commonly used}} allometric equations in central Africa, were not valid at Zadié with an overestimation of biomass of about 40 %. The allometric equations of the same authors for wet forests were valid at Zadié, even though the climatic zone does not correspond. More data on tree biomass are needed in central Africa to explore the natural range of variability in tree biomass and identify the factors that influence variations among sites.

Many species are monomorphic in color, making sex determination {{difficult in the}} field. An example of the latter are mockingbirds, which are passerines of the genus Mimus, endemic to the Americas. In order to distinguish {{between male and female}} mockingbirds using external body measurements that are easy to take, the objective of this work was to quantify morphometric differences between sexes in adults of the following species: M. thenca (45 specimens), M. patagonicus (95), M. saturninus (88), M. triurus (152), and M. dorsalis (7). We measured the following variables: culmen length, bill height and width, tarsus length, middle toe length, wing chord and tail length. Measurements were generally larger in males than in females except for bill width in M. saturninus and M. triurus, culmen length in M. thenca and M. dorsalis, and bill <b>height</b> <b>in</b> <b>M.</b> dorsalis. There were significant differences between sexes in wing chord for M. patagonicus, M. saturninus and M. triurus; tail length for M. patagonicus and M. triurus; tarsus length for M. patagonicus; and in middle toe length for M. triurus. No significant differences in measurements were found between sexes for M. thenca. Significant discriminant functions were obtained for M. patagonicus, M. saturninus and M. triurus, with a percentage of correct classification less than 80 %. Only a few variables were useful for sex determination in the studied Mimus species, i. e. wing chord, tail length, middle toe length and tarsus length for three, two, one and one species, respectively...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Diabetes is a {{risk factor}} for POAG (primary open angle glaucoma), a second leading cause for legal blindness. Elevated intraocular pressure, a main risk factor for glaucoma, is a concern in diabetics. IOP (Intraocular pressure) has been {{associated}} with various systemic, familial, anthropometric and demographic factors by several studies. There has been no study relating these factors in diabetes in particular. This study was undertaken to find out the effect of BMI on intraocular pressure in subjects with diabetes. 101 subjects, 65 diabetics and 36 nondiabetics, aged 40 - 70 yrs attending diabetes check facility at KMC (Kasturba Medical College) hospital were included. Hypertensives, known diabetics undergoing treatment, glaucoma, or receiving IOP-lowering treatment, ocular diseases were excluded. Participants underwent standardized examinations including applanation tonometry and anthropometric indices. Intraocular pressure (IOP) was assessed in both eyes using Goldmann applanation tonometer and recorded as the average of three measurements. Subject’s height, weight in kilograms was measured. BMI was calculated as weight in kilogram / (<b>height</b> <b>in</b> <b>m)</b> 2. Statistical analysis was done by Student’s t-test. The mean IOP (19. 7 ± 1. 64 mmHg) in diabetics was higher than the nondiabetics (p< 0. 0001). The mean BMI (23. 13 ± 3. 05) in diabetics was higher than nondiabetics (p< 0. 003). A significant trend in increase in IOP to increase in BMI was observed when different grades of BMI were compared. A significant correlation was found between BMI and IOP (p< 0. 0001). The diabetics have higher IOP and higher BMI. The BMI is associated with increased IOP in subjects with diabetes. Key words: Diabetes, Body Mass Index, Intraocular Pressure, glaucom...|$|E
40|$|This paper's {{objective}} is to investigate the associations between obesity and Food-Related Lifestyles (FRL) in five European countries. A cross-sectional web-based survey {{was carried out in}} Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Greece and Poland, January 2008, with quota samples on gender (male, female), age categories (20 - 44 and 45 - 70 years), and locality of residence (urban, rural). A total of 2437 respondents (51 % women, 49 % men; mean age 41. 4 years, SD 13. 1) participated. Obtained data included socio-demographic information, measure of the food-related lifestyle scale and self-reported weights and heights. Body Mass Index (in kg/m 2) was calculated as weight (in kg) divided by the squared <b>height</b> (<b>in</b> <b>m</b> 2). Individuals were classified as obese if BMI ≥ 30. Logistic regressions were fitted for the aggregated sample and then by country with obese as dependent and socio-demographics and FRL were included as independents. The prevalence of obesity in the five countries is 22 %. Europeans giving more importance to 'self-fulfilment' (odds = 1. 18), 'planning of meals' (odds = 1. 15), and preferring 'snacks vs. meals' (odds = 1. 24) {{are more likely to be}} obese. Respondents were less likely to be obese if they attached lower levels of importance to the use of 'shopping lists' (odds = 0. 87). The overall picture is that a stronger interest in health, organic products and freshness, within the FLR domain of quality aspects, is associated with 'not being obese'. This study has identified specific FRL dimensions as potential predictors of obesity. The resulting consumers' profiling can be used for targeted interventions for weight management in Europe...|$|E
40|$|Background: Anthropometric {{measures}} {{could predict}} the new onset of diabetes mellitus (DM). Recently, a new anthropometric measure (a body shape index, ABSI) was developed, and ABSI could predict premature mortality, {{even better than}} WC and BMI. The main aims {{of the study were}} to assess the DM predictive power of ABSI based on the follow-up data over 15 years collected from a general Chinese population. Methods and Findings: The data were collected in 1992 and then again in 2007 from the same group of 711 individuals. Because 24 of them were diagnosed with DM in 1992, our analysis was eventually based on the usable data collected from the remaining 687 individuals (male: 58. 1 %). ABSI was defined as WC/(BMI 2 / 3 height 1 / 2), expressing WC and <b>height</b> <b>in</b> <b>m.</b> After adjusting for confounders, increasing the population ABSI by one standard deviation would result in an increased HR of 41 % (95 %CI: 12 %– 77 %), compared to 73 % (95 %CI: 37 %– 118 %) for BMI and 96 % (95 %CI: 53 %– 150 %) for WC. WC had the best discriminatory power for DM (AROC: 0. 701, 95 %CI: 0. 641 – 0. 760), followed by BMI (AROC: 0. 668, 95 %CI: 0. 601 – 0. 734) and ABSI (AROC: 0. 647, 95 %CI: 0. 581 – 0. 713). Conclusions: ABSI could predict the new onset of DM in the Chinese population independently. Since the confidence intervals for the HR coefficients and AROCs overlapped, the predictive ability of ABSI for DM was not better than WC and BMI. The three measures had similar predictive abilities for DM. Further studies about ethnic specificities of ABSI are needed and warranted...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Body Mass Index (BMI), {{which is}} defined as the ratio between weight (in kg) and <b>height</b> (<b>in</b> <b>m</b> 2), is often used in {{clinical}} practice as well as in large scale epidemiological studies to classify subjects as underweight, normal weight, overweight or obese. Although BMI does not directly measure the percentage of Body Fat (BF%), it is widely applied because it is strongly related with BF%, it is easy to measure and it is an important predictor of mortality. Among children, age and sex-specific reference values of BMI, known as percentiles, are used. However, {{it is not clear how}} strong the relationship between BMI and BF% is among children and whether the association is linear. We performed a cross-sectional study aiming at evaluating the strength and shape of the relationship between BMI and BF% among school-aged children aged 6 - 12 years. Findings The study was conducted on a sample of 361 football-playing male children aged 6 to 12 years in Rome, Italy. Age, weight, height and skinfold thickness were collected. BF% was estimated using 4 skinfold equations whereas BMI was converted into BMI-for-age z-score. The relationship between these variables was examined using linear regression analyses. Mean BMI was 18. 2 (± 2. 8), whereas BF% was influenced by the skinfold equation used, with mean values ranging from 15. 6 % to 23. 0 %. A curvilinear relationship between BMI-for-age zscore and BF % was found, with the regression line being convex. The association between BMI-for-age zscore and BF% was stronger among overweight/obese children than among normal/underweight children. This curvilinear pattern was evident in all 4 skinfold equations used. Conclusions The association between BMI-for-age zscore and BF% is not linear among male children aged 6 - 12 years and it is stronger among overweight and obese subjects than among normal and underweight subjects. In this age group, BMI is a valid index of adiposity only among overweight and obese subjects. </p...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To assess bladder and rectum doses in {{relation}} to body mass index of patients undergoing high dose rate brachytherapy {{for the treatment of}} carcinoma of the cervix. Methods: The cohort consists of fifty subjects with carcinoma of the uterine cervix presented with grade II and III. Patient’s height and weight was measured before the insertion of applicator in situ. Body mass index (BMI) of the patient was calculated in accordance to World Health Organization definition (weight in Kg/ <b>height</b> <b>in</b> <b>m</b> 2). Adequacy of position and orientation of the applicator was confirmed with the help of orthogonal X-ray images and the same were transferred to the treatment planning system (TPS) to generate treatment plan. Prescription doses were optimized to Point A and to reference lines placed at 0. 5 cm apart from the surface of ovoids. The following dose reference points were identified on orthogonal x-ray images for analysis using the rectal marker and Foleys bulb inflated with radio opaque dye Rectal points at the level of femoral heads (RL) and pubis symphysis (RLP), Anorectum Junction (AR Jn) point and Rectosigmoid (RS) point and Bladder point (BL). Pearson regression analysis was used to analyze data from TPS. Results: The mean BMI was 22. 7 kg/m 2 and average age was 49. 9 years. Analysis showed that RL point dose and BMI were inversely correlated with a coefficient - 0. 45 (p = 0. 001). The trend continued along the rectal tube in cranio-caudal direction, as RLP and AR Jn points showed inversion co-efficiency with increase in BMI,- 0. 48 (p < 0. 01) and - 0. 51 (p < 0. 01) respectively. Bladder point showed weak positive correlation to BMI, 0. 12 (p = 0. 38). Conclusion: Significant rectal dose reduction is observed with increase in BMI. Bladder dose did not show statistically significant correlation with BMI. Based on the findings, BMI constitutes a confounding factor in the treatment of carcinoma of cervix. </p...|$|E

A pooled cross-sectional analysis was conducted to evaluate the association between baseline body mass index (BMI, measured as weight in kg divided by the square of <b>height</b> <b>in</b> <b>m)</b> and self-reported diabetes status in over 900, 000 individuals recruited in 18 cohorts from Bangladesh, China, India, Japan, Korea, Singapore and Taiwan. Logistic regression models were fitted to calculate cohort-specific odds ratios (OR) of diabetes for categories of increasing BMI, after adjustment for potential confounding factors. OR were pooled across cohorts using a random-effects meta-analysis. The sex- and age-adjusted prevalence of diabetes was 4. 3 % in the overall population, ranging from 0. 5 % to 8. 2 % across participating cohorts. Using the category 22. 5 - 24. 9 kg/m²) as reference, the OR for diabetes spanned from 0. 58 (95 % confidence interval [CI] 0. 31, 0. 76) for BMI lower than 15. 0 kg/m² to 2. 23 (95 % CI 1. 86, 2. 67) for BMI higher than 34. 9 kg/m². The positive association between BMI and diabetes prevalence was present in all cohorts and in all subgroups of the study population, although the association was stronger in individuals below age 50 at baseline (p-value of interaction< 0. 001), in cohorts from India and Bangladesh (p< 0. 001), in individuals with low education (p-value 0. 02), and in smokers (p-value 0. 03); no differences were observed by gender, urban residence, or alcohol drinking.
