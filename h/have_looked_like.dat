Under Henry II perhaps a third of the country was royal forest.|$|E
5|$|The {{evolutionary}} {{origins of}} Styracosaurus were not understood {{for many years}} because fossil evidence for early ceratopsians was sparse. The discovery of Protoceratops, in 1922, shed light on early ceratopsid relationships, but several decades passed before additional finds filled in more of the blanks. Fresh discoveries in the late 1990s and 2000s, including Zuniceratops, the earliest known ceratopsian with brow horns, and Yinlong, the first known Jurassic ceratopsian, indicate what the ancestors of Styracosaurus may <b>have</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like.</b> These new discoveries have been important in illuminating the origins of horned dinosaurs in general, and suggest that the group originated during the Jurassic in Asia, {{with the appearance of}} true horned ceratopsians occurring {{by the beginning of the}} late Cretaceous in North America.|$|E

60|$|There was {{the misery}} of the {{stricken}} animal in her gaze. He <b>had</b> seen women <b>look</b> <b>like</b> that in Whitechapel. The woman to whom, indirectly, he owed his broken nose <b>had</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> that. As his hand had fallen on the collar {{of the man who}} was kicking her to death, he had seen her eyes. They were Ellen's eyes, as she stood there now--tortured, crushed, yet uncomplaining.|$|R
25|$|Stiltsville may not <b>have</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> much, {{but in the}} 1940s and 1950s, it was {{a popular}} place where lawyers, bankers, politicians, and other moneyed, well-connected Miamians came to drink, relax and kick back. Law {{enforcement}} periodically visited the area, looking for vice activities.|$|E
25|$|Cannonsburgh Village is a {{reproduction}} of what a working pioneer village would <b>have</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> from {{the period of the}} 1830s to the 1930s. Visitors can view the grist mill, school house, doctor's office, Leeman House, Caboose, Wedding Chapel, and other points of interest. It is also home to the World's Largest Cedar Bucket.|$|E
25|$|Some {{scholars}} {{regard the}} Gospel of Thomas {{as part of}} the tradition from which the canonical gospels eventually emerged; however, the Gospel of Thomas is heavily gnostic and likely not written by orthodox Christians.

25|$|The tomb {{is thought}} to have stood until the Byzantine era before falling into ruin. The ruins were rediscovered by British {{traveller}} Charles Fellows in the early 1840s.

25|$|Prior to Duria Antiquior Georges Cuvier had {{published}} drawings {{of what he}} believed certain prehistoric creatures would <b>have</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> in life. Conybeare had drawn a famous cartoon of Buckland sticking his head into a den of prehistoric hyaenas in honour of his well-known analysis of the excavation at Kirkdale Cave, but Duria Antiquior was the first depiction of a scene from deep time showing a variety of prehistoric creatures interacting {{with one another and}} their environment based on fossil evidence.|$|E
25|$|This facade {{can be seen}} as the {{foundation}} for many other buildings, including both French and English Gothic churches. While the form is typical of northern France, its various components were common to many Romanesque churches of the period across Europe. Similar facades are found in Portugal. In England, Southwell Cathedral has maintained this form, despite the insertion of a huge Gothic window between the towers. Lincoln and Durham must once <b>have</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> this. In Germany, Limburg Cathedral has a rich variety of openings and arcades in horizontal storeys of varying heights.|$|E

25|$|Nerthus {{is often}} {{identified}} with the van Njörðr who is attested in various 13th century Old Norse works and in numerous Scandinavian place names. The {{connection between the two}} is due to the linguistic relationship between Njörðr and the reconstructed Proto-Germanic *Nerþuz, Nerthus being the feminine, Latinized form of what Njörðr would <b>have</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> around the first century. This has led to theories about the relation of the two, including that Njörðr may have once been a hermaphroditic deity or that the name may indicate the otherwise forgotten sister-wife in a divine brother-sister pair like the Vanir deities Freyja and Freyr.|$|E
25|$|The National Trust runs a {{shop and}} a tearoom in the village. The Corfe Model Village, {{located on the}} village square, is a 1/20 scale model that shows what the castle and village would <b>have</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> in 1646 before the castle was slighted. Within the Church of St. Edward is an {{alabaster}} reredos inset with carvings in white marble, designed by the famous Victorian architect George Edmund Street R.A., which was presented by Lord Eldon in 1876. A cross in the square commemorates Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee of 1897. Next to the cross is a defunct village pump, bearing the village's coat of arms.|$|E
25|$|Information on Kliper's beyond LEO mission {{capabilities}} were expanded {{further by}} RSC Energia, {{with a picture}} released in December 2005 of what a possible Kliper interplanetary configuration might <b>have</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like.</b> The design was entirely theoretical but made for a view of where RSC Energia saw the Kliper operating, and how it might have done so. This configuration was unlike anything seen so far for a manned space vehicle, with the solar arrays needed for electrical power vastly bigger than the habitable volume at the centre. It was also unclear what the mode of propulsion was. The very large solar array suggested an ion propulsion system might have been contemplated for such a mission, though it might also simply be {{that there was another}} reason for such a large array, such as increased power for better telemetry transmission rates over large distances.|$|E

25|$|After {{the bones}} were prepared, photographed and studied, {{they were sent}} to New Jersey where work began on making the mount. This work {{consists}} of bending steel to support each bone safely and to display the entire skeleton articulated {{as it was in}} life. The real skull was not incorporated into the mount as subsequent study would be difficult with the head 13 feet off the ground. Parts of the skull had been crushed and broken, and thus appeared distorted. The museum made a cast of the skull, and altered this cast to remove the distortions, thus approximating what the original undistorted skull may <b>have</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like.</b> The cast skull was also lighter, allowing it to be displayed on the mount without the use of a steel upright under the head. The original skull is exhibited in a case that can be opened to allow researchers access for study. When the whole skeleton was assembled it was forty two feet (twelve meters) long from nose to tail and twelve feet (four meters) tall at the hips.|$|E
25|$|Margherita Guarducci relates a {{tradition}} that the original icon of Mary attributed to Luke, sent by Eudokia to Pulcheria from Palestine, was a large circular icon only of her head. When the icon arrived in Constantinople it was fitted in as the head into a very large rectangular icon of her holding the Christ child {{and it is this}} composite icon that became the one historically known as the Hodegetria. She further states another tradition that when the last Latin Emperor of Constantinople, Baldwin II, fled Constantinople in 1261 he took this original circular portion of the icon with him. This remained in the possession of the Angevin dynasty who had it likewise inserted into a much larger image of Mary and the Christ child, which is presently enshrined above the high altar of the Benedictine Abbey church of Montevergine. Unfortunately this icon has been over the subsequent centuries subjected to repeated repainting, so {{that it is difficult to}} determine what the original image of Mary’s face would <b>have</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like.</b> However, Guarducci also states that in 1950 an ancient image of Mary at the Church of Santa Francesca Romana was determined to be a very exact, but reverse mirror image of the original circular icon that was made in the 5th century and brought to Rome, where it has remained until the present.|$|E

500|$|Following the {{description}} of the related Tianyulong in 2009, which was preserved with hundreds of long, filamentous integuments (sometimes compared to bristles) from neck to tail, Heterodontosaurus has also been depicted with such structures, for example in publications by American palaeontologists Gregory S. Paul and Paul Sereno. Sereno has stated that a hetereodontosaur may <b>have</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> a [...] "nimble two-legged porcupine" [...] in life. The restoration published by Sereno also featured a hypothetical display structure located on the snout, above the nasal fossa (depression).|$|E
