40|$|The main {{technical}} {{result of}} this paper is to characterize the contracting isometries of a CAT(0) cube complex without any assumption on its local finiteness. Afterwards, we introduce the combinatorial boundary of a CAT(0) cube complex, and we show that contracting isometries are strongly related to isolated points at infinity, when the complex is locally finite. This boundary turns out to appear naturally in the context of Guba and Sapir's diagram groups, and we apply our main criterion to determine precisely when an element of a diagram group induces a contracting isometry on the associated Farley cube complex.

Combined with predecessor&# 39;s work, this paper presents a much more integrated analysis of the unique solution region of specific P 3 P problem. We rind that there are seven regions in space which can lead to the unique solution of P 3 P problem when three control points of P 3 P problem form an isosceles triangle. And when the camera is within these regions, we can get the solution of P 3 P problem uniquely. The results we obtain are very useful for disposing control points and the camera in the practical applications.

40|$|We propose {{and solve}} {{a simple but}} very general quantum model of an SU(2) spin {{interacting}} with a large external system with N states. The coupling is described by a random hamiltonian in a new general gaussian SU(2) xU(N) random matrix ensemble, that we introduce in this paper. We solve the model in the large N limit, for any value of the spin j and for any choice of the coupling matrix element distributions in the different possible angular momentum channels l (and provided that the internal dynamics of the spin is slow). Besides its mathematical interest as a non-trivial random matrix model, it allows to study and illustrate in a simple framework various phenomena: the decoherence dynamics, the conditions of emergence of the classical phase space for the spin, the properties quantum diffusion in phase space. The large time evolution for the spin is shown to be non-Markovian in general, the Markov property emerging <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>specific</b> <b>case</b> for the dynamics and the initial conditions.

40|$|It is {{surprisingly}} difficult {{to compute the}} inverse of {{the product of a}} number multiplied by its logarithm. The need to provide a means for calculating this inverse may arise in many instances, especially when dealing with experiments in information theory and calculations such as those required for Shannon entropy. This problem can certainly be solved using some heuristic method, and once very small scales are reached {{within the context of a}} large-scale problem this would be desirable. However, any such solution, while effective <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>specific</b> <b>case,</b> is generally plagued by drawbacks and lacks generality and simplicity. Examples might include limiting the domain and using a table, a search algorithm, or some heuristic or analytic approximation. Less appetizing methods might even involve solving polynomials of some high degree. An example of one such scheme, utilizing generating functions, will be discussed. More importantly, it is worth investigating a means for approximating this function which are general, perhaps scalable, and whose precision can be adjusted. We will investigate an analytic method, utilizing recursion, which has these characteristics. 2 Approximation with Logarithms The approach to be outlined below stems from an important observation about any valu...|$|R
