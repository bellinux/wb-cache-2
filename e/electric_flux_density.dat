40|$|Two {{families}} of parametrized mixed variational principles for linear electromagnetody-namics are constructed. The first family is applicable {{when the current}} density distribution is known a priori. Its six independent fields are magnetic intensity and <b>flux</b> <b>density,</b> magnetic potential, <b>electric</b> intensity and <b>flux</b> <b>density</b> and <b>electric</b> potential. Through appropriate spe-cialization of parameters the first principle reduces to more conventional principles proposed in the literature. The second family is appropriate when the current density distribution and a conjugate Lagrange multiplier field are adjoined, giving a total of eight independently varied fields. In this case it is shown that a conventional variational principle exists only in the time-independent (static) case. Several static functionais with reduced number of varied fields are presented. The application {{of one of these}} principles to construct finite elements with current prediction capabilities is illustrated with a numerical example. 1...|$|R

Then, based on the characteristics that the complex permittivity and permeability of three kinds of general dispersive medium models, i. e., Debye model, Lorentz model, Drude model, the permittivity and permeability can be formulated by rational polynomial fraction in jω; the conversion equation from frequency domain to time domain (i. e., jω replaced by ∂/∂t) and the shift operator method are then applied to obtain the constitutive relation at modified electrical points, and the time-domain recursive formulas for D and E, B and H available for FDTD computation are obtained. Several numerical examples are presented, indicating that this scheme possesses advantages such as fine generalization, EMS memory and time step saving, and good precision...|$|R

Current density produces magnetic field around it. From the curl equation, we observed that the time derivative of the E-field depends on the change of the H-field across space. Hence, {{the value of the}} E-field can be computed if we know its previous value and the space-derivative of the H-field, which in turn is time-stepped and if initial field value, initial conditions and boundary conditions are known [4]. The FDTD technique divides the computational space into a Cartesian coordinate’s grid of voxels and then allocates the components of the electric and magnetic fields as every E field is surrounded by H field and vice versa. This scheme is known as Yee lattice. If, the current changes over time, alternating magnetic field causes alternating electric field, which in turn causes another magnetic field, results in the creation of propagating electromagnetic wave of higher frequency.|$|E

All PhC structures {{are assumed to}} a square lattice of constant a made of GaAs rods of radius r= 0. 2 a, in an air background. The numerical simulation was performed using the nonlinear finite difference time domain (NFDTD) technique. In doing so, we have normalized the electric field and the <b>electric</b> <b>flux</b> <b>density</b> vectors, and used a multi probe procedure. These have resulted in very accurate dispersion relations that, in turn, have enabled us to make some novel observations. For instance, simulations show that {{with an increase in}} the input light intensity (in the nonlinear regime) the band edges for all three PhC structures experience some red shifts. The red shifts observed for CCWs are, of course, larger than the red shifts experienced by other two structures. Furthermore, the numerical results for CCWs also show that the larger the light input intensity, the smaller the corresponding maximum light group velocity becomes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first instance that such observations on the impact of the nonlinear Kerr effect on the band diagram of 2 D-PhC waveguides are reported...|$|E

It can handle Dirichlet, Neumann or mixed boundary problems {{in which the}} filling media can be homogeneous or inhomogeneous. The basic idea of the new method is solve the problem in three steps: (i) First solve the equation ∇· D=ρ. The inverse of the divergence operator in a restricted subspace is found to yield the <b>electric</b> <b>flux</b> <b>density</b> D by a fast direct solver in O(N) operations. The D so obtained is nonunique with indeterminate divergence-free component. Then the electric field is found by E= D/ϵ. But ∇× E= 0 for electrostatic field; hence, E is curl free and orthogonal to the divergence free space. (ii) An orthogonalization process is used to purify the electric field making it curl free and unique. (iii) Then the potential ϕ is obtained by solving ∇ϕ=- E or finding the inverse of the gradient operator in a restricted subspace by a similar fast direct solver in O(N) operations. Treatments for both Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions are addressed. Finally, the validation and efficiency are illustrated by several numerical examples. Through these simulations, {{it is observed that}} the computational complexity of our proposed method almost scales as O(N) where N is the triangle patch number of meshes.
