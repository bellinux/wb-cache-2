40|$|Background: Little {{is known}} about the {{duration}} of subsequent <b>depressive</b> <b>episodes</b> and periods of recovery, and much is based on potentially biased retrospective data. We therefore prospectively assessed whether duration of <b>depressive</b> <b>episodes</b> and recoveries is correlated within subjects and across episodes, and whether duration of subsequent <b>depressive</b> <b>episodes</b> and recoveries increases or decreases over time. Methods: From a sample of 267 depressed primary care patients enrolled in a RCT, we identified 279 <b>depressive</b> <b>episodes</b> and 455 recovery periods during a 3 -year follow-up. We correlated durations of <b>depressive</b> <b>episodes</b> and of recovery within subjects, and compared within subjects the duration of first <b>depressive</b> <b>episodes</b> after index depression with second and third episodes, and similarly with recovery periods. Results: No significant correlations were found between duration of <b>depressive</b> <b>episodes</b> or between recovery periods within subjects (Rs ranging from − 0. 17 to 0. 08; all Ps > 0. 05). Median duration of first and second <b>depressive</b> <b>episodes</b> was 11 (IQR 6 - 19) and 9 weeks (IQR 5 - 14). Median duration of first and second recovery periods was 16. 5 (IQR 7 - 31) and 17. 5 weeks (IQR 9 - 32). No significant increase or decrease was observed in duration of consecutive <b>depressive</b> <b>episodes,</b> nor in recovery periods across episodes (all Ps > 0. 05). Conclusions: In this prospective study, we found no correlation between duration of <b>depressive</b> <b>episodes</b> or between recovery periods within subjects. Moreover, we found no support for an increase or decrease in subsequent duration of <b>depressive</b> <b>episodes</b> or a decrease in recovery periods across episodes. These findings do not support the notion that experiencing multiple <b>depressive</b> <b>episodes</b> results in a growing vulnerability...|$|R

30|$|Since {{there are}} more {{practical}} and cultural barriers to alcohol use among Anabaptists, AUD in this group may reflect poorer social adjustment and other psychosocial vulnerabilities that contribute to increased <b>depressive</b> <b>episodes.</b> AUD may also lower the threshold for psychiatric hospitalization among Anabaptists. We also observed that AUD was associated with increased number of clean <b>depressive</b> <b>episodes</b> among the Anabaptists we studied. This suggests that those Anabaptists who do develop AUD are vulnerable to increased <b>depressive</b> <b>episodes,</b> that <b>depressive</b> <b>episodes</b> predispose to AUD, or that some third factor—such as social isolation or deviance—is involved. Further studies that use a longitudinal design {{would be needed to}} clarify this association.|$|R

40|$|Background: This study {{investigated}} the relationship between depressive symptom response during tryptophan depletion and future <b>depressive</b> <b>episodes.</b> Methods: Twelve subjects with prior major <b>depressive</b> <b>episodes</b> in remission and medication-free for $ 3 months (patients), and 12 matched healthy (control) subjects received two tryptophan depletion tests 1 week apart. During follow-up the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale was administered weekly for 1 month, monthly for 3 months, and once at 6 and 12 months. Results: With results from both tests, tryptophan depletion has a sensitivity of 78 %, specificity of 80 %, positive predictive value of 70 %, and negative predictive value of 86 % to identify future <b>depressive</b> <b>episodes.</b> Survival anal-ysis shows that mood response to tryptophan depletion reliably predicts major <b>depressive</b> <b>episodes</b> during the follow-up year (r 5. 2725, p 5. 014).

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Prospective {{studies have}} shown that the course of bipolar {{disorder}} (BD) is characterized by the persistence of symptoms, predominantly depression, along most of the time. However, to our knowledge, no studies in Latin America have investigated it. OBJECTIVES: To replicate international studies using a Brazilian sample to prospectively analyze treatment outcomes in the first year and to determine potential chronicity factors. METHODS: We followed up 102 patients with BD for 12 months and evaluated the number of months with affective episodes and the intensity of manic and depressive symptoms using the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) and the Hamilton Depression Scale (HAM-D 17). Sociodemographic and retrospective clinical data were examined to determine possible predictors of outcome. RESULTS: Almost 50 % of the patients had symptoms about half of the time, and there was a predominance of <b>depressive</b> <b>episodes.</b> Disease duration and number of <b>depressive</b> <b>episodes</b> were predictors of chronicity. Depressive polarity of the first episode and a higher number of <b>depressive</b> <b>episodes</b> predicted the occurrence of new <b>depressive</b> <b>episodes.</b> CONCLUSION: In general, BD outcome seems to be poor in the first year of monitoring, despite adequate treatment. There is a predominance of depressive symptoms, and previous <b>depressive</b> <b>episodes</b> are a predictor of new <b>depressive</b> <b>episodes</b> and worse outcome...|$|R

25|$|Individuals in {{a current}} major <b>depressive</b> <b>episode</b> , a {{disorder}} characterized by social impairment, show deficits in theory of mind decoding. Theory of mind decoding {{is the ability}} to use information available in the immediate environment (e.g., facial expression, tone of voice, body posture) to accurately label the mental states of others. The opposite pattern, enhanced theory of mind, is observed in individuals vulnerable to depression, including those individuals with past MDD, dysphoric individuals, and individuals with a maternal history of MDD.|$|E
25|$|The term Major {{depressive}} disorder {{was introduced}} {{by a group of}} US clinicians in the mid-1970s as part of proposals for diagnostic criteria based on patterns of symptoms (called the Research Diagnostic Criteria, building on earlier Feighner Criteria), and was incorporated into the DSM-III in 1980. To maintain consistency the ICD-10 used the same criteria, with only minor alterations, but using the DSM diagnostic threshold to mark a mild <b>depressive</b> <b>episode,</b> adding higher threshold categories for moderate and severe episodes.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe study {{based on}} the {{theoretical}} conceptualizations of prodromal symptoms, the course of <b>depressive</b> <b>episodes,</b> genetic and emotional vulnerability to depression, aimed to explore the relations between these variables.

40|$|Abstract Background Within {{the context}} of a biopsychosocial model of the {{treatment}} of <b>depressive</b> <b>episodes,</b> a multidisciplinary approach is needed. Clinical pathways have been developed and implemented in hospitals to support multidisciplinary teamwork. The aim {{of this study is to}} explore current practice for the treatment of <b>depressive</b> <b>episodes</b> in Flemish psychiatric hospitals. Current practice in different hospitals is studied to get an idea of the similarities (outlined as a pathway) and the differences in the treatment of <b>depressive</b> <b>episodes.</b> Methods A convenience sample of 11 Flemish psychiatric hospitals participated in this qualitative study. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with different types of health care professionals (n = 43). The websites of the hospitals were searched for information on their approach to treating <b>depressive</b> <b>episodes.</b> Results A flow chart was made including the identified stages of the pathway: pre-admission, admission (observation and treatment), discharge and follow-up care. The characteristics of each stage are described. Although the stages are identified in all hospitals, differences between hospitals on various levels of the pathway exist. Hospitals emphasized the individual approach of each patient. The results point to a biopsychosocial approach to treating <b>depressive</b> <b>episodes.</b> Conclusion This study outlined current practice as a pathway for Flemish inpatients with <b>depressive</b> <b>episodes.</b> Within {{the context of}} surveillance of quality and quantity of care, this study may encourage hospitals to consider developing clinical pathways. </p...|$|R

25|$|Symptoms of the {{depressive}} {{phase of}} bipolar disorder include persistent feelings of sadness, irritability or anger, loss {{of interest in}} previously enjoyed activities, excessive or inappropriate guilt, hopelessness, sleeping too much or not enough, changes in appetite and/or weight, fatigue, problems concentrating, self-loathing or feelings of worthlessness, and thoughts of death or suicide. In severe cases, the individual may develop symptoms of psychosis, a condition also known as severe bipolar disorder with psychotic features. These symptoms include delusions and hallucinations. A major <b>depressive</b> <b>episode</b> persists {{for at least two}} weeks, and may result in suicide if left untreated.|$|E

25|$|Recent {{studies have}} linked smoking to anxiety disorders, {{suggesting}} the correlation (and possibly mechanism) {{may be related}} to the broad class of anxiety disorders, and not limited to just depression. Current and ongoing research attempt to explore the addiction-anxiety relationship. Data from multiple studies suggest that anxiety disorders and depression play a role in cigarette smoking. A history of regular smoking was observed more frequently among individuals who had experienced a major depressive disorder at some time in their lives than among individuals who had never experienced major depression or among individuals with no psychiatric diagnosis. People with major depression are also much less likely to quit due to the increased risk of experiencing mild to severe states of depression, including a major <b>depressive</b> <b>episode.</b> Depressed smokers appear to experience more withdrawal symptoms on quitting, are less likely to be successful at quitting, and are more likely to relapse.|$|E
25|$|The causes are {{not clearly}} understood, but both {{environmental}} and genetic factors play a role. Many genes of small effect contribute to risk. Environmental factors include {{a history of}} childhood abuse, and long-term stress. The condition is divided into bipolar I disorder {{if there has been}} at least one manic episode, with or without depressive episodes, and bipolar II disorder if there has been at least one hypomanic episode (but no manic episodes) and one major <b>depressive</b> <b>episode.</b> In those with less severe symptoms of a prolonged duration, the condition cyclothymic disorder may be diagnosed. If due to drugs or medical problems, it is classified separately. Other conditions that may present in a similar manner include attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, personality disorders, schizophrenia, and substance use disorder {{as well as a number}} of medical conditions. Medical testing is not required for a diagnosis, though blood tests or medical imaging can be done to rule out other problems.|$|E
25|$|Double {{depression}} {{occurs when}} a person experiences a major <b>depressive</b> <b>episode</b> {{on top of the}} already-existing condition of dysthymia. It is difficult to treat, as sufferers accept these major depressive symptoms as a natural part of their personality or as a part of their life that is outside of their control. The fact that people with dysthymia may accept these worsening symptoms as inevitable can delay treatment. When and if such people seek out treatment, the treatment may not be very effective if only the symptoms of the major depression are addressed, but not the dysthymic symptoms. Patients with double depression tend to report significantly higher levels of hopelessness than is normal. This can be a useful symptom for mental health services providers to focus on when working with patients to treat the condition. Additionally, cognitive therapies can be effective for working with people with double depression in order to help change negative thinking patterns and give individuals a new way of seeing themselves and their environment.|$|E
50|$|Recurrent brief {{depression}} (RBD) {{defines a}} mental disorder characterized by intermittent <b>depressive</b> <b>episodes,</b> {{not related to}} menstrual cycles in women, occurring between approximately 6-12 times per year, over {{at least one year}} or more fulfilling the diagnostic criteria for major <b>depressive</b> <b>episodes</b> (DSM-IV and ICD-10) except for duration which in RBD is less than 14 days, typically 2-4 days. Despite the short duration of the <b>depressive</b> <b>episodes,</b> such episodes are severe and suicidal ideation and impaired function is rather common. The majority of patients with RBD also report symptoms of anxiety and increased irritability. Hypersomnia is also rather frequent. About 1/2 of patients fulfilling diagnostic criteria for RBD may have additional short episodes of brief hypomania which is a severity marker of RBD. RBD may be the only mental disorder present, but RBD may also occur as part of a history of recurrent major <b>depressive</b> <b>episodes</b> or bipolar disorders. RBD is also seen among some patients with personality disorders.|$|R
40|$|International audience: The {{cumulative}} duration of <b>depressive</b> <b>episodes,</b> and their repetition, has a detrimental effect on depression recurrence {{rates and the}} chances of antidepressant response, and even {{increases the risk of}} dementia, raising the possibility that <b>depressive</b> <b>episodes</b> could be neurotoxic. Psychomotor retardation could constitute a marker of this negative burden of past <b>depressive</b> <b>episodes,</b> with conflicting findings according to the use of clinical versus cognitive assessments. We assessed the role of the Retardation Depressive Scale (filled in by the clinician) and the time required to perform the neurocognitive d 2 attention test and the Trail Making Test (performed by patients) in a sample of 2048 depressed outpatients, before and after 6 to 8 weeks of treatment with agomelatine. From this sample, 1140 patients performed the TMT-A and -B, and 508 performed the d 2 test, at baseline and after treatment. At baseline, we found that with more past <b>depressive</b> <b>episodes</b> patients had more severe clinical level of psychomotor retardation, and that they needed more time to perform both d 2 and TMT. When the analyses were performed again after treatment, and especially when the analyses were restricted to patients with clinical remission, the cognitive tests were the only ones correlated with past <b>depressive</b> <b>episodes.</b> Psychomotor retardation tested at a cognitive level was therefore systematically revealing the burden of past <b>depressive</b> <b>episodes,</b> with an increased weight for patients with less remaining symptoms. If prospectively confirmed, interventions such as cognitive remediation therapy could benefit from a more specific focus on neurocognitive retardation...|$|R

25|$|The {{combined}} {{actions of}} 5-HT2A and 5HT2C receptor antagonism with serotonin reuptake inhibition only occur at moderate to {{high doses of}} trazodone. Doses of trazodone lower than those effective for antidepressant action are frequently used for the effective treatment of insomnia. Low doses exploit trazodone's potent actions as a 5-HT2A receptor antagonist, and its properties as an antagonist of H1 and α1-adrenergic receptors, but do not adequately exploit its SERT or 5-HT2C inhibition properties, which are weaker. Since insomnia {{is one of the}} most frequent residual symptoms of depression after treatment with an SSRI, a hypnotic is often necessary for patients with a major <b>depressive</b> <b>episode.</b> Not only can a hypnotic potentially relieve the insomnia itself, but treating insomnia in patients with major depression may also increase remission rates due to improvement of other symptoms such as loss of energy and depressed mood. Thus, the ability of low doses of trazodone to improve sleep in depressed patients may be an important mechanism whereby trazodone can augment the efficacy of other antidepressants.|$|E
