5000|$|The Ferme générale {{developed}} {{at a time}} when the monarchy suffered from chronic financial difficulties. The Affermage (leasing, outsourcing) of the collection of the traite (customs duties and taxes) had the advantage of guaranteeing the Treasury foreseeable and regular receipts, while reducing the perception of its role in tax-collection. The rights were initially contracted separately to various tax farmers, who were named traitants (who had the right to collect the traite) or partisans (who had a share (partie) in the collection of the traite). They were obliged to pay to the Royal Treasury the sum stipulated in their lease, and they received a share of the income and a share of any [...] "unexpected" [...] surplus. Each right was leased separately, which caused great administrative complexity: the taking of <b>goods</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>bond</b> could involve several tax farms. Prior to 1598, this system had developed so that the tax farms were allocated among five pays (parts of France).|$|E

60|$|This is, {{first and}} foremost, what I mean by the narrowness {{of the new}} ideas, the {{limiting}} effect of the future.
