500|$|At age 11, Bell {{became a}} vegetarian. In an {{interview}} with PETA, Bell stated, [...] "I have always been an animal lover. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>time</b> disassociating the animals I cuddled with—dogs and cats, for example—from the animals on my plate, and I never really cared for the taste of meat. I always loved my Brussels sprouts!" [...] By 2012 Bell became vegan with her husband after watching the documentary Forks Over Knives. During her time in Michigan, Bell fostered animals from Michigan Humane Society and she now supports the San Diego-based Helen Woodward Animal Center. Bell often attends fund raisers for the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and other non-profit organizations dedicated to protecting animals. She has a Welsh Corgi-Chow Chow mix named Lola, a Welsh Corgi-Chihuahua mix named Shakey, and a black Labrador Retriever named Sadie, who was 11 {{years old when she}} was rescued from Hurricane Katrina and adopted by Bell in 2005.|$|E
2500|$|Initially, Baldelli had {{to adjust}} to {{professional}} baseball. Says Baldelli, [...] "In Princeton, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>time</b> with {{all parts of the}} game…I didn't know how to play the game. Coming out of high school, I'd just come {{up to the plate and}} swing as hard as I could every time and try to smoke the ball. I didn't know about hitting mechanics, breaking pitches or reading pitchers." ...|$|E

"The {{subject has}} been changed, and we'll write Beatrice di Tenda [...] <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>time</b> persuading Romani, but persuade him I did, {{and with good}} reasons.

He is a man of good will, and I want him to show it also in wanting to prepare at least the first act for me swiftly." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I'm {{glad you}} say so," [...] cried Jock. [...] "That woman is worse for him {{than six months}} of east wind. <b>I</b> declare <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> matter to get myself to go to Church there the next day." ...|$|R

2500|$|However, {{within a}} month, Bellini {{had changed his}} mind and he was writing to Pasta stating that [...] "the subject has been changed, and we'll write Beatrice di Tenda. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>time</b> persuading Romani, but persuade him I did, and with good reasons.

2500|$|He {{says one}} of his earlier works [...] "was {{intensely}} personal about a love affair I had. It was terrible, I knew it. It was not until he started writing in a more [...] "structured narrative environment" [...] that he [...] "began to find my voice... <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>time</b> finishing scripts. My problem was finding certain character narrative concerns. Once I finished scripts, I almost instantly made a living. Not only made a living, but got them made. From the time I finished them to {{the time they were}} getting made, making progress on the trail, that all happened pretty quickly.|$|E
60|$|This day we had supper {{over before}} sunset. Romer showed no effects from his long, hard ride. First {{he wanted to}} cook, then he fooled around the fire, bothering Isbel. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>time</b> to manage him. He wanted to be {{eternally}} active. He teased and begged to go hunting--then he compromised on target practice. R.C. and I, however, were too tired, and we preferred to rest beside the camp-fire.|$|E

6000|$|... "This {{outburst}} rather astonished me, {{as you can}} think. 'Well,' said I, 'other people don't think {{quite so}} much of me as you seem to do, Mr. Pinner. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> enough fight to get this berth, and I am very glad to have it.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'On that {{occasion}}, Kit,' said Mr Brass, 'on {{that occasion}} that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> just alluded to, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> battle with Mr Quilp (for Mr Quilp is <b>a</b> very <b>hard</b> man) to obtain them the indulgence they had. It might <b>have</b> cost me <b>a</b> client. But suffering virtue inspired me, and I prevailed.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But I {{lost her}} when I {{was a little}} older than you are, and for years had to {{struggle}} on alone, for I was too proud to confess my weakness to anyone else. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>time,</b> Jo, and shed a good many bitter tears over my failures, for in spite of my efforts I never seemed to get on. Then your father came, and I was so happy that I found it easy to be good. But by-and-by, when I had four little daughters round me and we were poor, then the old trouble began again, for I am not patient by nature, and it tried me very much to see my children wanting anything." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I went to New York. It was {{the same}} game there, only that I had more money and could play it properly. It {{was the same}} in New Orleans, in Galveston. I came to California. This is my fifth voyage. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>time</b> getting these three interested, and spent all my little store of money before they signed the agreement. They were very mean. Advance any money to me! The very idea of it was preposterous. Though I bided my time, ran up a {{comfortable}} hotel bill, and, at the very last, ordered my own generous assortment of liquors and cigars and charged the bill to the schooner. Such a to-do! All three of them raged and all but tore their hair [...] . and mime. They said it could not be. I fell promptly sick. I told them they got on my nerves and made me sick. The more they raged, the sicker I got. Then they gave in. As promptly I grew better. And here we are, out of water and heading soon most likely for the Marquesas to fill our barrels. Then they will return and try for it again!" ...|$|E
6000|$|As romancer to the {{children}} <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>time,</b> even from the beginning. If they brought me a picture, in a magazine, and required me to build a story to it, they would cover {{the rest of the}} page with their pudgy hands to keep me from stealing an idea from it. The stories had to come hot from the bat, always. They had to be absolutely original and fresh. Sometimes {{the children}} furnished me simply a character or two, or a dozen, and required me to start out at once on that slim basis and deliver those characters up to a vigorous and entertaining life of crime. If they heard of a new trade, or an unfamiliar animal, or anything like that, I was pretty sure {{to have to deal with}} those things in the next romance. Once Clara required me to build a sudden tale out of a plumber and a [...] "bawgunstrictor," [...] and I had to do it. She didn't know what a boa-constrictor was, until he developed in the tale--then she was better satisfied with it than ever.|$|E

"I am a poor man; {{considering}} my large family, a {{very poor}} man. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> between eight and nine hundred a year, and when {{my father and mother}} are both gone <b>I</b> shall <b>have</b> nearly as much more; but <b>I</b> <b>have</b> nine children, and as I must keep up something of <b>a</b> position, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> time of it sometimes, I can tell you." ...|$|R
6000|$|ANNA--[Shrinks {{away from}} him, half-frightened.] What's that--Swedish? I don't know it. [Then as if seeking {{relief from the}} tension in a voluble chatter.] Gee, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>an</b> awful trip coming here. I'm all in. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to sit up in the dirty coach all night--couldn't get no sleep, hardly--and then <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> job finding this place. I never been in New York before, you know, and-- ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> {{time talking}} about Norm. It's like he's too close to me, but I don't think he's changed over the years. They moved him from being an {{accountant}} to painter and decorator, but that was basically for some storylines. He's still the same Norm. I think he's the toughest to write for because he's not really anything. He's just funny. George Wendt ...|$|R
6000|$|... "His {{name was}} Joel Dethridge. He had a {{beautiful}} voice. When we sang hymns, he sang off the same book with me. By trade he was a paper-hanger. We had much serious talk together. I walked with him on Sundays. He was a good ten years younger than I was; and, being only a journeyman, his worldly station was below mine. My mother found out the liking that had grown up between us. She told my father {{the next time he}} was at home. Also my married sisters and my brothers. They all joined together to stop things from going further between me and Joel Dethridge. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>time</b> of it. Mr. Bapchild expressed himself as feeling much grieved at the turn things were taking. He introduced me into a sermon--not by name, but I knew who it was meant for. Perhaps I might have given way if they had not done one thing. They made inquiries of my young man's enemies, and brought wicked stories of him to me behind his back. This, after we had sung off the same hymn-book, and walked together, and agreed one with the other on religious subjects, was too much to bear. I was of age to judge for myself. And I married Joel Dethridge." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'He {{was still}} with Egstrom & Blake, {{and we met}} in what they called [...] "our parlour" [...] opening out of the store. He had that moment come in from {{boarding}} a ship, and confronted me head down, ready for a tussle. [...] "What have you got to say for yourself?" [...] I began {{as soon as we}} had shaken hands. [...] "What I wrote you--nothing more," [...] he said stubbornly. [...] "Did the fellow blab--or what?" [...] I asked. He looked up at me with a troubled smile. [...] "Oh, no! He didn't. He made it a kind of confidential business between us. He was most damnably mysterious whenever I came over to the mill; he would wink at me in a respectful manner--as much as to say 'We know what we know.' Infernally fawning and familiar--and that sort of thing [...] ." [...] He threw himself into a chair and stared down his legs. [...] "One day we happened to be alone and the fellow had the cheek to say, 'Well, Mr. James'--I was called Mr. James there as if I had been the son--'here we are together once more. This is better than the old ship--ain't it?' [...] . Wasn't it appalling, eh? I looked at him, and he put on a knowing air. 'Don't you be uneasy, sir,' he says. 'I know a gentleman when I see one, and I know how a gentleman feels. I hope, though, you will be keeping me on this job. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>time</b> of it too, along of that rotten old Patna racket.' Jove! It was awful. I don't know what I should have said or done if I had not just then heard Mr. Denver calling me in the passage. It was tiffin-time, and we walked together across the yard and through the garden to the bungalow. He began to chaff me in his kindly way [...] . I believe he liked me [...] ." ...|$|E
5000|$|Referring to {{his career}} as an actor and his passion for music, Bridges says, [...] "I dug what an actor did, but {{it took me a}} while to feel it, to truly {{appreciate}} the craft and the preparation. Plus, I was still playing music a lot, and I guess <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>time</b> choosing: was I an actor or a musician, or could I be both?" ...|$|E
5000|$|In an {{interview}} with author Greg Rhodes, Rohr, who wasn't a baseball fan when the project began, stated: [...] "Sometimes <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> time understanding {{the people who come}} and stare at this place with tears in their eyes; a woman actually hugged the ticket booth and kissed it".

But in the sunny Spring when they bloom again, their love and gratitude will give you happy homes among their bright leaves.|$|R
5000|$|Jackson told Billboard magazine, [...] "Everybody {{kept telling}} me, 'You {{need to come}} out with a {{positive}} love song.' I've <b>had</b> <b>a</b> lot of sad ballads, but <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> time writing those love songs because there's a tendency to get real sappy with them so they're not real. That's the way most of them come off to me. I wanted to write one that was realistic, what I call a realistic approach to a positive love song." ...|$|R

5000|$|Some of {{the aspects}} of Glogauer's {{childhood}} as described in Behold the Man are based on Moorcock's own childhood, though he says [...] "I had such a happy childhood <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>time</b> finding material, especially for the novel version". Likewise, Glogauer's frequent headaches were also inspired by migraines that Moorcock suffered from, although these were later discovered {{to be caused by}} an adverse reaction to nicotine rather than any psychological causes as in Glogauer's case.|$|E

It was very windy and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>time</b> keeping my easel up. So I quit.

5000|$|Debnath {{felt that}} the character's offscreen exit in which Kelly [...] "seems {{something}} very unlike the character".
