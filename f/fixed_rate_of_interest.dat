It is felt that to buy simply in order to sell again brings out many unsocial human qualities; it makes a man seek to enhance profits and falsify values, and so the samurai are forbidden to buy to sell on their own account or for any employer save the State, unless some process of manufacture changes the nature of the commodity (a mere change in bulk or packing does not suffice), and they are forbidden salesmanship and all its arts.

Secondly, the multivariate granger causality tests reveal that there is only one-way causality between financial depth and economic growth; the flow running from financial depth to economic growth.

This enquiry therefore suggests that a departure from rigidly <b>fixed</b> deposit <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> will enhance financial depth and improve the country’s <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> economic growth.

500|$|During the 17th century, a more {{scientific}} basis for risk management was being developed.

Combining this idea with that of compound interest and annuity valuation, it became possible to set up an insurance scheme to provide life insurance or pensions for a group of people, and to calculate with some degree of accuracy each member's necessary contributions to a common fund, assuming a <b>fixed</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest.</b> The first person to correctly calculate these values was Edmond Halley [...] In his work, Halley demonstrated a method of using his life table to calculate the premium someone of a given age should pay to purchase a life-annuity [...]|$|E

Another important advance came in 1662 from a London draper named John Graunt, who showed that there were predictable patterns of longevity and death in a group, or cohort, of people of the same age, despite the uncertainty of the date of death of any one individual.

5000|$|Debtors {{who have}} debts with a <b>fixed</b> nominal <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> {{will see a}} {{reduction}} in the [...] "real" [...] interest rate as the inflation rate rises. The real interest on a loan is the nominal rate minus the inflation rate. The formula R = N-I approximates the correct answer as long as both the nominal interest rate and the inflation rate are small. The correct equation is r = n/i where r, n and i are expressed as ratios (e.g. 1.2 for +20%, 0.8 for −20%). As an example, when the inflation rate is 3%, a loan with a nominal <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> 5% would have a real <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> approximately 2% (in fact, it's 1.94%).

6000|$|This applies, for example, to the {{property}} that a man creates and acquires in business enterprises, which are presumably undertaken for gain, and {{as a means of}} living rather than for themselves.

The abuses, the necessary reforms of company law on earth, are no concern of ours here and now, suffice it that in a Modern Utopia such laws must be supposed to be as perfect as mortal laws can possibly be made. Caveat vendor will be a sound qualification of Caveat emptor in the beautifully codified Utopian law. Whether the Utopian company will be allowed to prefer this class of share to that or to issue debentures, whether indeed usury, that is to say lending money at <b>fixed</b> <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest,</b> will be permitted at all in Utopia, one may venture to doubt. But whatever the nature of the shares a man may hold, they will all be sold at his death, and whatever he has not clearly assigned for special educational purposes will--with possibly some fractional concession to near survivors--lapse to the State. The [...] "safe investment," [...] that permanent, undying claim upon the community, is {{just one of those things}} Utopia will discourage; which indeed the developing security of civilisation quite automatically discourages through the fall in the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest.</b> As we shall see at a later stage, the State will insure the children of every citizen, and those legitimately dependent upon him, against the inconvenience of his death; it will carry out all reasonable additional dispositions he may have made for them in the same event; and it will insure him against old age and infirmity; and the object of Utopian economics will be to give a man every inducement to spend his surplus money in intensifying the quality of his surroundings, either by economic adventures and experiments, which may yield either losses or large profits, or in increasing the beauty, the pleasure, the abundance and promise of life.|$|R

50|$|Three-month LIBOR is {{generally}} a floating rate of financing, which fluctuates {{depending on how}} risky a lending bank feels about a borrowing bank.

5000|$|In {{corporate}} finance, a debenture is {{a medium}} to long-term debt instrument used by large companies to borrow money, at a <b>fixed</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest.</b> The legal term [...] "debenture" [...] originally {{referred to a}} document that either creates a debt or acknowledges it, but in some countries the term is now used interchangeably with bond, loan stock or note. A debenture is thus like a certificate of loan or a loan bond evidencing {{the fact that the}} company is liable to pay a specified amount with interest and although the money raised by the debentures becomes a part of the company's capital structure, it does not become share capital. Senior debentures get paid before subordinate debentures, and there are varying rates of risk and payoff for these categories.|$|E
50|$|Derivatives {{trading of}} this kind may serve the {{financial}} interests of certain particular businesses. For example, a corporation borrows a large sum of money at a specific interest rate.

The corporation could buy a forward rate agreement (FRA), which is a contract to pay a <b>fixed</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> six months after purchases on a notional amount of money. If the interest rate after six months is above the contract rate, the seller will pay the difference to the corporation, or FRA buyer.
