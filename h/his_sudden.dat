5|$|Herbert Chapman (19 January 1878– 6 January 1934) was an English {{association}} {{football player}} and manager. Though {{he had an}} undistinguished playing career, {{he went on to}} become one of the most successful and influential managers in early 20th-century English football, before <b>his</b> <b>sudden</b> death in 1934.|$|E
5|$|McAleer's rift with Johnson, {{along with}} <b>his</b> <b>sudden</b> retirement, damaged his {{professional}} reputation, and he received little recognition for {{his contributions to}} baseball.

He was omitted from the original Rising Stars roster, but was added after <b>his</b> <b>sudden</b> rise to stardom. Some media outlets—including USA Today, Los Angeles Times, and CBSSports.com—stated that he deserved {{to play in the}} All-Star Game.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} years, he was {{assisted}} {{by the man}} who had become his trusted prime-minister, Johan Göransson Gyllenstierna (1635–1680). Some sources say the king was basically dependent on Gyllenstierna,. <b>His</b> <b>sudden</b> death in 1680 opened up the road to the monarch, and many men tried to get close to the king to take Gyllenstierna's place.|$|E
5|$|No {{operations}} {{are reported in}} Sicily {{for the first two}} years after the fall of Palermo. The Muslims were probably preoccupied with organizing their new province, while the Byzantines were too weak to react, and could not expect any reinforcements: the Empire faced mounting pressure in the East, where the Abbasid Caliph al-Ma'mun launched repeated invasions of the Byzantine borderlands and threatened to march on Constantinople itself until <b>his</b> <b>sudden</b> death in August 833.|$|E

5|$|Born in Payette, Idaho on June 29, 1936, Harmon Killebrew was {{youngest}} {{of four children}} to Harmon Clayton, Sr. and Katherine Pearl (May) Killebrew. His father, a painter and sheriff, {{was a member of}} an undefeated Millikin College football team who was later named an All-American under eventual Pro Football Hall of Fame coach Greasy Neale. According to family legend, Harmon Killebrew's grandfather was the strongest man in the Union Army, winning every available heavyweight wrestling championship. Clayton encouraged Harmon and his brothers to stay active in various sports before <b>his</b> <b>sudden</b> death in 1953 at age 59.|$|E
5|$|Ernest met {{and fell}} in love in mid-1813 with his first cousin, Duchess Frederica of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, wife of Prince Frederick William of Solms-Braunfels and widow of Prince Louis of Prussia. The two agreed to wed if Frederica became free to marry. Her {{marriage}} to Frederick William had not been a success; her husband, seeing the marriage was beyond hope, agreed to a divorce, but <b>his</b> <b>sudden</b> death in 1814 removed the necessity. Some considered the death too convenient, and suspected the princess of poisoning her husband. Queen Charlotte opposed the marriage: before the princess had married Frederick William, she had jilted Ernest's brother, the Duke of Cambridge, after the engagement was announced.|$|E
5|$|Gerard was {{a patron}} of learning, {{to the extent}} that he urged at least one of his clergy to study Hebrew, a {{language}} not commonly studied at that time. He himself was a student of astrology, which led to suggestions that he was a magician and a sorcerer. Partly because of such rumours, and his unpopular attempts to reform his cathedral clergy, Gerard was denied a burial inside York Minster after <b>his</b> <b>sudden</b> death in 1108. His successor as archbishop subsequently had Gerard's remains moved into the cathedral church from their initial resting place beside the cathedral porch.|$|E

5|$|Henry IV was the {{grandson}} of Edward III {{and the son of}} John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster; hence, his dynasty was known as the House of Lancaster. For most of his reign, Henry IV was forced to fight off plots and rebellions; his success was partly due to the military skill of his son, the future Henry V. Henry V's own reign, which began in 1413, was largely free from domestic strife, leaving the king free to pursue the Hundred Years' War in France. Although he was victorious, <b>his</b> <b>sudden</b> death in 1422 left his infant son Henry VI on the throne and gave the French an opportunity to overthrow English rule.|$|E
5|$|Joining {{the newly}} formed RAAF in August 1921, Mackinolty {{established}} himself as the service's senior logistician between the wars, first as Director of Transport and Equipment from 1929 to 1935, and thereafter as Director of Equipment. He was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1937. Soon after the outbreak of World WarII, he became Director of Supply and was promoted to group captain. In June 1942 he was raised to acting air commodore and appointed the Air Member for Supply and Equipment (AMSE). Promoted to air vice marshal in 1948, Mackinolty continued to serve as AMSE until <b>his</b> <b>sudden</b> death from cancer in February 1951, aged fifty-five.|$|E
5|$|Alvarado {{arrived at}} Buena Esperanza {{in the middle}} of its abandonment. <b>His</b> <b>sudden</b> {{appearance}} halted the exodus, and many colonists who had already left returned. Cerezeda sent messages from Naco, imploring Alvarado to take over as governor of the province. The town council joined in session and installed Alvarado as justicia mayor (chief judge), and as captain-general of Honduras-Higueras until the Crown appointed someone else, or confirmed him in his post. Alvarado's presence turned Spanish morale around overnight. The factions that had plagued the colonial government dissipated, and the colonists rallied around the new governor. Alvarado, known to the natives by his Nahuatl nickname Tonatiuh, had a fearsome reputation amongst the indigenous population, who had heard of his ruthless exploits elsewhere. Alvarado rapidly re-established firm Spanish control over the area around Buena Esperanza and founded a military encampment in Tencoa. He successfully established profitable gold and silver mines in Higueras.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} of <b>his</b> <b>sudden</b> death in 1940, Scott {{believed}} himself a failure, and Zelda's death in 1948 was little noted. However, interest in the Fitzgeralds surged {{in the years following}} their deaths. In 1950, screenwriter Budd Schulberg, who knew the couple from his Hollywood years, wrote The Disenchanted, with characters based recognizably on the Fitzgeralds who end up as forgotten former celebrities, he awash with alcohol and she befuddled by mental illness. It was followed in 1951 by Cornell University professor Arthur Mizener's The Far Side of Paradise, a biography of F. Scott Fitzgerald that rekindled interest in the couple among scholars. Mizener's biography was serialized in The Atlantic Monthly, and a story about the book appeared in Life magazine, then one of America's most widely read and discussed periodicals. Scott was viewed as a fascinating failure; Zelda's mental health was largely blamed for his lost potential.|$|E
5|$|In the 1940s, {{together}} with Olivier and John Burrell, Richardson was the {{co-director of the}} Old Vic company. There, his most celebrated roles included Peer Gynt and Falstaff. He and Olivier led the company to Europe and Broadway in 1945 and 1946, before their success provoked resentment among the governing board of the Old Vic, leading to their dismissal from the company in 1947. In the 1950s, in the West End and occasionally on tour, Richardson played in modern and classic works including The Heiress, Home at Seven, and Three Sisters. He continued on stage and in films until shortly before <b>his</b> <b>sudden</b> death {{at the age of}} eighty. He was celebrated in later years for his work with Peter Hall's National Theatre and his frequent stage partnership with Gielgud. He was not known for his portrayal of the great tragic roles in the classics, preferring character parts in old and new plays.|$|E
5|$|Press {{reports of}} the Amelia Island affair were wildly inaccurate, partly because of {{misinformation}} disseminated by MacGregor himself. <b>His</b> <b>sudden</b> departure, he claimed, was because he had sold the island to Aury for $50,000. Josefa gave birth to their first child in Nassau on 9 November 1817, a boy named Gregorio. The owner of the Venus was an ex-captain of the British Corps of Colonial Marines named George Woodbine. He drew MacGregor's attention to the British Legions being raised by the Latin American revolutionaries in London, and suggested that he could recruit and command such a force himself. MacGregor was excited {{by the idea of}} leading British troops again after years in command of colonials, tribesmen, and miscellaneous adventurers. He sailed for home with Josefa and Gregorio and landed in Dublin on 21 September 1818, and from there made his way back to London.|$|E

5|$|Sunderland, however, {{retained}} {{a degree of}} personal influence with George until <b>his</b> <b>sudden</b> death in 1722 allowed the rise of Sir Robert Walpole. Walpole became de facto Prime Minister, although the title was not formally applied to him (officially, he was First Lord of the Treasury and Chancellor of the Exchequer). His management of the South Sea crisis, by rescheduling the debts and arranging some compensation, helped the return to financial stability. Through Walpole's skilful management of Parliament, George managed to avoid direct implication in the Company's fraudulent actions. Claims that George had received free stock as a bribe are not supported by evidence; indeed receipts in the Royal Archives show that he paid for his subscriptions and that he lost money in the crash.|$|E
5|$|That {{night was}} quiet {{until just before}} dawn. The North Koreans then {{launched}} an attack against the 9th Infantry {{on the right of}} the marines, the heaviest blow striking G Company. It had begun to rain again and the attack came {{in the midst of a}} downpour. In bringing his platoon from an outpost position to the relief of the company, Sergeant First Class Loren R. Kaufman encountered an encircling North Korean force on the ridge line. He bayoneted the lead scout and engaged those following with grenades and rifle fire. <b>His</b> <b>sudden</b> attack confused and dispersed this group. Kaufman led his platoon on and succeeded in joining hard-pressed G Company. In the ensuing action Kaufman led assaults against close-up North Korean positions and, in hand-to-hand fighting, he bayoneted four more North Korean soldiers, destroyed a machine gun position, and killed the crew members of a North Korean mortar. American artillery fire concentrated in front of the 9th Infantry helped greatly in repelling the North Koreans in this night and day battle.|$|E
5|$|The 1995 Brazilian Grand Prix (formally the XXIV Grande Prêmio do Brasil) was a Formula One motor race held on 26 March 1995 at the Autódromo José Carlos Pace, São Paulo, Brazil. It was the firstround of the 1995 Formula One season. The 71-lap {{race was}} won by Michael Schumacher for the Benetton team after {{starting}} from second position. David Coulthard {{finished second in}} a Williams, with Gerhard Berger third in a Ferrari. Damon Hill, who started the race from pole position, spun out while leading on lap30 with an apparent gearbox problem, which was later {{found to be a}} suspension failure. Schumacher's win came despite Benetton encountering steering problems with his car during Friday practice, leading to him crashing heavily and necessitating steering component changes {{for the rest of the}} event. Despite Schumacher's victory, Hill proved to be faster during the race, and seemed to be on course for a comfortable victory before <b>his</b> <b>sudden</b> retirement.|$|E
