The strains' identification was based on classical taxonomy criteria, including cells and colony morphology, physiological requirements, carbohydrate utilization profiles and enzyme activities tests. The new isolates belong to genera Saccharomyces, Geotrichum, Candida, Metschnikowia, Clavispora, Wickerhamiella, Debaryomyces, Kloeckera and Rhodotorula. Aiming to find out strains with possible biotechnological application, the main fermentation products of our isolates were estimated. After aerobic cultivation in medium, containing 20 g/l glucose fourteen strains accumulated high amounts of ethanol; all formed some lactic acid and six strains - succinic acid. The starch-degrading activity was evaluated quantitatively by measuring the light absorption of the iodine-starch complex.

6000|$|The early {{singing of}} the oven-bird fledgling is important, {{owing to the}} fact that the group it belongs to {{comprises}} the least specialized forms in the family. They are strong-legged, square-tailed, terrestrial birds, generally able to perch, have probing beaks, and build the most perfect mud or stick nests, or burrow in the ground. In the numerous tree-creeping groups, which, seem as unrelated to the oven-bird as the woodpecker is to the hoopoe, we find a score of wonderfully different forms of beak; but many of them retain the probing character, and are actually used to probe in rotten wood on trees, and to explore the holes and deep crevices in the trunk. We have also seen that some of these tree-creepers revert to the ancestral habit (if I may so call it) of seeking their <b>food</b> by <b>probing</b> in the soil. In others, like Dendrornis, in which the beak has lost this character, and is used to dig in the wood or to strip off the bark, it has not been highly specialized, and, compared with the woodpecker's beak, is a very imperfect organ, considering the purpose for which it is used. Yet, on the principle that [...] "similar functional requirements frequently lead to the development of similar structures in animals which are otherwise very distinct"--as we see in the tubular tongue in honey-eaters and humming birds--we might have expected to find in the Dendrocolaptidae a better imitation of the woodpecker in so variable an organ as the beak, if not in the tongue.|$|R

Unfortunately, most of the imported food products do not have Halal Logo or with doubted Halal Logo. The demand for Halal food and other Islamic consumer goods is increasing. This study will be beneficial to provide new information of Halal products and easier for Muslim to choose the permissible products according to Syariah Law. The main objective {{of this study was to}} determine of suspected Non Halal processed food products by using porcine mitochondrial 12 S rDNA and porcine leptin gene. A total of 66 samples of suspected Non Halal food products were screened for porcine mitochondrial 12 S rDNA gene and porcine leptin gene primer pairs from the genomic DNA. The PCR products were separated on 2 % agarose gel and visualized under UV light. Thirty seven samples were positive with mitochondrial 12 S rDNA gene whilst 59 samples were positive with leptin gene. From these, 33 were positive with both primers. These results indicate that the samples of processed food products contained porcine derivatives. From the detection of the DNA products by using the two set of primers, leptin gene was concluded to be more specific than the mitochondrial 12 S rDNA gene. Some of the PCR products of processed food products of mitochondrial 12 S rDNA gene and leptin gene were sent to Genomic Bioscience & Technology Company for DNA sequencing.

500|$|The American white ibis is a tactile, nonvisual forager, {{which limits}} {{its ability to}} choose {{from a wide variety}} of prey. For the most part, the American white ibis forages for <b>food</b> by tactile <b>probing.</b> It wades slowly through shallow water and sticks its long, downcurved bill into the {{substrate}} of the water body with its bill held at around [...] agape at the tip, and sweeps its long bill back and forth across the bottom to pick out suitable food items. Birds may also probe when standing still. Groping with a wide open bill is a technique used by ibis in deeper water when alone, as is head swinging, in which the ibis swings its wide open bill widely in open water. Others copy this type of foraging if they see one ibis doing it. On land, the American white ibis locates prey by sight and pecks, and does not have to insert its bill into the substrate. The American white ibis seeks small prey when other birds are around, as it needs time to break up larger food items into smaller pieces to eat, and other predators such as herons and egrets often take the opportunity to rob the ibis of its catch. Along with the scarlet ibis, the species coexists with another five species of ibis in the Llanos in Venezuela. American white ibis males are aggressive to and take prey items from smaller ibises, but the smaller females are more often the victims of this behavior.|$|R

Knot usually search for <b>food</b> by randomly <b>probing</b> into the mud. Prey selection may be described by 5 rules: (1) Prey are not ingestible by knot if the circumference {{is more than}} 30 mm. (2) Prey are not accessible to knot when they lie buried deeper than 2 to 3 cm. (3) The probability of a prey organism being detected depends on its surface area, measured in the horizontal plane. (4) Prey are ignored when they are unprofitable, i. e. when the rate of intake while handling the prey is below the current overall average intake rate during feeding. (5) Knot prefer thin-shelled to thick-shelled prey species, possibly because a high inorganic content has an inhibitory effect on {{the rate at which}} energy can be extracted from the food. The first rule of ingestion is set by the gape width, and is therefore invariable. The fraction of the prey which is accessible varies according to the probing depth of the bird. The lower size threshold of prey taken is determined by the profitability rule and so varies according to the current feeding rate of knot. Unfortunately for knot, the majority of the preferred thin-shelled prey live out of reach of the bill, whereas the thick-shelled species live at the surface.

40|$|Individuals {{make choices}} and {{prioritize}} goals using complex processes that assign value to rewards and associated stimuli. During Pavlovian learning, previously neutral stimuli that predict rewards can acquire motivational properties, whereby they themselves become attractive and desirable incentive stimuli. But individuals differ in whether a cue acts solely {{as a predictor}} that evokes a conditional response, or also serves as an incentive stimulus, and this determines {{the degree to which}} a cue might bias choice or even promote maladaptive behavior. Here we use rats that differ in the incentive motivational properties they attribute to <b>food</b> cues to <b>probe</b> the role of the neurotransmitter dopamine in stimulus-reward learning. We show that intact dopamine transmission is not required for all forms of learning in which reward cues become effective predictors. Rather, dopamine acts selectively in a form of reward learning in which “incentive salience ” is assigned to reward cues. In individuals with a propensity for this form of learning, reward cues come to powerfully motivate and control behavior. This work provides insight into the neurobiology of a form of reward learning that confers increased susceptibility to disorders of impulse control. Dopamine is central for reward-related processes 1, 2, but the exact nature of its role remains controversial. Phasic neurotransmission in the mesolimbic dopamine system is initially triggered by the receipt of reward (unconditional stimulus; US), but shifts to a cue predictive of reward (conditional stimulus; CS) after associative learning 3, 4.

40|$|The mouse {{has emerged}} as a uniquely {{valuable}} species for studying the molecular and genetic basis of complex behaviors and modeling neuropsychiatric disease states. While valid and reliable preclinical assays for reward-related behaviors are critical to understanding addiction-related processes, and various behavioral procedures have been developed and characterized in rats and primates, there have been relatively few studies using operant-based addiction-relevant behavioral paradigms in the mouse. Here we describe the performance of the C 57 BL/ 6 J inbred mouse strain on three major reward-related paradigms, and replicate the same procedures in two other commonly used inbred strains (DBA/ 2 J, BALB/cJ). We examined Pavlovian-instrumental transfer (PIT) by measuring the ability of an auditory cue associated with food reward to promote an instrumental (lever press) response. In a separate experiment, we assessed the acquisition and extinction of a simple stimulus-reward instrumental behavior on a touch screen based task. Reinstatement of this behavior was then examined following either continuous exposure to cues (conditioned reinforcers, CRs) associated with reward, brief reward and CR exposure, or brief reward exposure followed by continuous CR exposure. The third paradigm examined sensitivity of an instrumental (lever press) response to devaluation of <b>food</b> reward (a <b>probe</b> for outcome insensitive, habitual behavior) by repeated pairing with malaise. Results showed that C 57 BL/ 6 J mice displayed robust PIT, as well as clear extinction and reinstatement, but were insensitive to reinforcer devaluation. DBA/ 2 J mice showed good PIT and (rewarded) reinstatement, but were slow to extinguish and did not show reinforcer devaluation or significant CR-reinstatement. BALB/cJ mice also displayed good PIT, extinction and reinstatement, and retained instrumental responding following devaluation, but, unlike the other strains, demonstrated reduced Pavlovian approach behavior (food magazine head entries).

40|$|We assess Canadian’s risk {{perceptions}} for {{genetically modified}} (GM) <b>food</b> and <b>probe</b> influences of socio-economic, demographic {{and other factors}} impinging on these perceptions. An internet-administered questionnaire with two stated choice split-sample experiments that approximate market choices of individual grocery shoppers is applied to elicit purchase behavior from 882 respondents across Canada. Data are collected to assess the influence on respondents’ choices for a specific food product (bread) of 1) product information which varies in content and by source and 2) information provided through labeling. These data also enable: a) analysis of trade-offs made by consumers between possible risks associated with GM ingredients and potential health or environment benefits in food and b) assessment of influences on respondents’ search for/access of product information. We rigorously document the extent and type of variation in Canadian consumers’ attitudes and risk perceptions for a selected GM food. This is pursued in analysis of experiment 1) data using a latent class model to analyze 445 consumers’ choices for bread products. We identify four distinct groups of Canadian consumers: 51 % (value seekers) valued additional health or environmental benefits and were indifferent to GM content; traditional consumers (14 %) preferred their normally-purchased food; fringe consumers (4 %) valued the health attribute and could defer consumption. Another 32 % (anti-GM) strongly opposed GM ingredients in food irrespective of introduced attributes. Thus there is a dichotomy in Canadian attitudes to GM content in food: a small majority of the sample (55 per cent) perceive little or no risk from GM food, but this is strongly opposed by 46 % of respondents. Differences in gender, {{number of children in}} the household, education, and age are associated with the likelihood of segment membership. We also report on the search for information on characteristics of the GM food by a sample of 445 respondents with opportunity for voluntary access to related information through hyperlinks in the survey. Slightly less than half actually sought such information. Gender, employment status, rural or urban residency and the number of children in the household all affected the probability that respondents would access information. A further research component examines product choices made in the context of two common GM labeling policies: mandatory and voluntary labeling. We find these two types of strategies to have distinctive impacts on consumers and on measures of social welfare. Knowledge of these may help policy makers to make more informed analyses of the alternative labeling policies. Specific findings also provide base-line measures of Canadians’ attitudes to risks of GM technology in the context of food and environmental risks, as well as documenting the importance of context influences and reference points on consumers’ preferences for GM food. We also develop methodological improvements for accurately estimating the value of information on a negative attribute.

40|$|In {{a context}} of the {{reduction}} of fat consumption, {{the objective of the}} food industry is to develop low-fat. food products while maintaining their sensory properties. However, these sensory properties depend on. both subject’s physiology and product characteristics but, to date, their respective importance is not well. known. In this context, in-mouth phenomena during fat spread consumption appear to be an essential. phase to investigate in order to identify some of the mechanisms driving fat perception. Among the different studies published on dairy product consumption, fat spreads were poorly considered. while they represent an important industrial market. Moreover spread products are interesting by their. particular structure and composition (water-in-oil emulsions, solid fat content and different sources of fat. (vegetal and animal)) supposing the involvement of specific in-mouth mechanisms. In this context, our. objective was to understand better the respective impact of inter- individual and inter-product variability. on the oral processing events during consumption of fat spreads. In the current study, 15 subjects highly contrasted regarding their oral physiological characteristics were. selected. According to the literature, the oral physiological parameters (oral volume, saliva flow and. viscosity, saliva composition) chosen were considered as important in in-mouth fat spread breakdown and. then perception. In parallel, 4 experimental fat spreads were designed with two levels (53 % and 20 %) and. 2 qualities (mix of animal and vegetable, and only vegetable) of fat. The matrices were aromatized with a. specific dairy flavouring ingredient to improve in-mouth aroma release. Curcumin, a <b>food</b> grade. fluorescent <b>probe,</b> was added to the matrices and was used to measure the thickness of the lipid on the. tongue after swallowing (1). The release of aroma during product consumption was measured by APCIMS.

Results show that product_'s effect is more important than subject’s effect. In particular, product physicochemical. parameters (solid content, granulometry, texture) and predict better food bolus properties and. tongue coating than oral physiological characteristics.

American white ibis males are aggressive to and take prey items from smaller ibises, but the smaller females are more often the victims of this behavior.Juveniles have lower foraging efficiency compared to adults and in most feeding flocks, the juveniles are usually outnumbered by the adults. They usually tend to stay close to one another and forage for food together at the peripheral region of the group. During the breeding season, adult male ibises have been recorded raiding other parent ibises who are feeding their young in the colony. The raiders force their bill down the throat of the victim—either the parent about to disgorge their food or recently fed young—and extract the ball of food. This behavior allows the otherwise starving adult males to obtain food without having to spend long periods of time away from the nest, and prevent its female mate copulating with another male ibis, which would reduce its own reproductive success. Females and juveniles almost never try to drive off the larger and more aggressive pirating males, but instead try to avoid or move away from them. This pirating behavior is less common between two male ibises as the males will actively fight off the pirate. The explanation of the species' sexual dimorphism of body size is unclear, because no differences between the sexes in feeding success rates or the foraging behavior have been observed and, as males are larger, they need more food than females.|$|R
