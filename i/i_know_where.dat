5|$|<b>I</b> <b>Know</b> <b>Where</b> I'm Going! is a 1945 British drama/romance film set {{mostly in}} the Outer Hebrides, {{depicting}} local lifestyles and speech.|$|E
5|$|To begin with, {{every one}} must buy this {{book for the}} {{following}} aesthetic reasons: First, because <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> there is the cutest cloth of gold dress for only $300 in a store on Forty-second Street, and, also, if enough people buy it {{where there is a}} platinum ring with a complete circlet, and, also, if loads of people buy it my husband needs a new winter overcoat, although the one he has done well enough for the last three years... It seems to me that on one page I recognized a portion of an old diary of mine which mysteriously disappeared shortly after my marriage, and, also, scraps of letters which, though considerably edited, sound to me vaguely familiar. In fact, Mr. Fitzgerald—I believe that is how he spells his name—seems to believe that plagiarism begins at home.|$|E
25|$|The Cherry {{children}} {{are joined by}} their new friends, the Pringle children, and their father Captain invents happenings or adventures for them. All stories are set in fictional St Mary Cray. Happenings: The great reception (the children lay on a reception committee greeting); Let it rain! (snakes and ladders game on the staircase); Mr. Pringle has a go (attempt by Pringle to create a happening); The Crocotosh (the children hide under a raincoat); Early birds (following a newspaper trail); The other house (the first Littles and Bigs story - the children leave a clue to a prize for the adults); The torn treasure chart (the Bigs and Littles each receive two quarters of the chart - each must fight for the other two quarters to find the treasure); The battle Of Bigs And Littles (Bigs and Littles creep up on each other to see the pieces of chart); Let them have it! (Roy gives the Littles' pieces of chart to the Bigs); <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>where!</b> (the race to the buried treasure).|$|E

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>where</b> he lived: <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>where</b> {{he was to}} {{be heard}} of, or communicated with; the {{distance}} was scarce a stone's-throw: had it been in the next room--unsummoned, I could make no use of my knowledge. To follow, to seek out, to remind, to recall--for these things I had no faculty.|$|R
6000|$|... (Doggedly.) <b>I</b> said <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>where</b> {{you were}} last night. Mr. Knox also <b>knows</b> <b>where</b> you were. But I'll wager your husband doesn't.|$|R
500|$|There {{are also}} many small rocks and skerries (small rock islands) in the seas around Gigha. Asked by a tourist {{if he knew}} where they all were, local {{resident}} Willie McSporran (see below) replied [...] "No, but <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> they aren't and that's good enough for me".|$|E
500|$|McMahon made an {{appearance}} {{as a guest}} speaker at the WrestleMania XXVII Press Conference. Several months later, she appeared in a backstage segment at SummerSlam to wish CM Punk luck in his match. Upon offering to shake his hand, Punk declined and insulted her: [...] "I would, but... <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> that hand's been." [...] The following night on Raw, McMahon appeared backstage with CM Punk and threatened him: [...] "...in the end, people always get what they deserve." ...|$|E
500|$|Prison Break {{features}} a serialized story structure, {{similar to that}} of its first season companion show 24. At the 2009 TV Critics Press Tour, Kevin Reilly told reporters that the series would end with the fourth season. Despite decreasing ratings, Reilly attributed the cancellation to creativity: [...] "The show has just played out. You get to a point creatively where you feel all the stories have been told, and you want to end strong and not gimp out in the end of the season." [...] Regarding the finale, Reilly stated, [...] "They have a really cool ending, actually. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> they end, and it's a hell of an idea." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I wasn't {{going to}} sleep," [...] he assured her. [...] "Circumstantial {{evidence}} is against me, <b>I</b> <b>know.</b> <b>Where's</b> Abby? reading French literature?" ...|$|R
2500|$|These forms {{cannot be}} omitted when the {{corresponding}} form in standard English cannot show contraction (and vice versa). For example, <b>I</b> don't <b>know</b> <b>where</b> he is cannot {{be reduced to}} *I don't <b>know</b> <b>where</b> he just as in standard English forms the corresponding reduction *I don't <b>know</b> <b>where</b> he's is likewise impossible. (<b>I</b> don't <b>know</b> <b>where</b> he at is possible, paralleling <b>I</b> don't <b>know</b> <b>where</b> he's at in standard English.) ...|$|R
60|$|ISABEL. I'm sure I wish <b>I</b> had <b>known</b> <b>where</b> he was! We {{lost him}} among the rhododendrons, and <b>I</b> don't <b>know</b> <b>where</b> he got to; oh, you naughty--naughty--(climbs on his knee).|$|R
500|$|In 1916, Coach Yost {{shared his}} {{recollections}} of the Buffalo game with Big Bill Edwards: [...] "Buffalo University came to Michigan with a much-heralded team. They were coached by a Dartmouth man {{and had not}} been scored upon. Buffalo papers referred to Michigan as the Woolly Westerners, and the Buffalo enthusiasts placed bets that Michigan would not score." [...] The score {{at the end of}} the first half was 65 to 0. About fifteen minutes after the second half had started, Yost discovered a Buffalo player, Simpson, [...] "on Michigan's side of the field, covered up in a blanket." [...] Yost was curious and asked, [...] "Simpson, what are you doing over here? You are on the wrong side." [...] To which, Simpson replied, [...] "Don't say anything. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> I am at. The coach has put me in three times already and I'm not going in there again. Enough is enough for any one. I've had mine." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{fragrance}} {{is described}} by Steal Their Style as a [...] "feminine and flowery fragrance". Along with Glow by JLo, the perfume achieved success in the fragrance market {{and became one of}} America's highest-selling bottles. Collectively with Glow by JLo, it brought in over $USD300 million within a year, making Lopez the nineteenth richest person under forty, according to business magazine Forbes. The Fragrance Foundation's FiFi Awards named it the [...] "Celebrity Fragrance of the Year" [...] in June 2003. Several writers compared the theme of Still Jennifer Lopez's promotional campaign to her hit-song [...] "Jenny from the Block" [...] (2002), in which she declared [...] "I'm Still, I'm Still Jenny from the Block / Used to have a little now I have a lot / No matter where I go, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> I came from." [...] Speaking about the fragrance's slogan, The New York Times wrote that it is [...] "a line that refers partly to her composure under the media glare but also serves as a pitch to potential consumers [...] It also evokes a song from her latest album, Jenny from the Block, in which she declares that despite fame, she is essentially her old self from South Bronx." ...|$|E
500|$|People {{are always}} {{using the word}} Illuminati but they're always {{referencing}} it in an incorrect way. People often accuse me of {{being a member of}} the Illuminati and I think in today's pop culture the Illuminati is perceived as a group of powerful, successful people who are working behind the scenes to control the universe. Not people with consciousness, not people who are enlightened. So people were accusing me of {{being a member of the}} Illuminati, and I kept going, wait—so first I had to figure out what that meant...I know who the real Illuminati are, and <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> that word comes from. The real Illuminati were a group of scientists, artists, philosophers, writers, who came about in what is referred to as the Age of Enlightenment, after the Dark Ages, when there was no writing and no art and no creativity and no spirituality, and life was really at a standstill. And right after that, everything flourished. So we had people like Shakespeare and Leonardo Da Vinci and Michaelangelo and Isaac Newton, and all these great minds and great thinkers, and they were called Illuminati...It had nothing to do with money and power. Of course they were powerful, because they influenced people. But their goal was to inspire and enlighten. So when people refer to me as a member of the Illuminati, I always want to say thank you. Thank you for putting me in that category.|$|E
60|$|I was snap-shotted {{twice before}} <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> was. Then Mr. Magg drew {{a sheet of}} paper towards him, and began to make notes.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I'll {{tell them}} <b>I</b> don't <b>know</b> <b>where</b> it is," [...] he replied; [...] "and I don't. I am sure <b>I</b> don't <b>know</b> <b>where</b> it is now: do you? Hush, here comes Joe." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But it's {{an awfully}} dreary place, too, and {{sometimes}} I feel that I'd {{like to run}} away--if <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>where</b> to go," [...] said Alora frankly.|$|R
500|$|While {{his group}} escapes from the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention, Jenner whispers to Rick about {{the virus that}} has caused the zombie apocalypse. Initially there was no {{indication}} as to what Jenner said to him; the dialogue was previously inserted into the episode's script but was later removed. [...] "I'm so pleased they didn't reveal it," [...] said Andrew Lincoln, [...] "because it was scripted, and extremely powerful, and I said to everyone, 'Burn this page: No one should know apart from Rick and Frank.' It's brilliant that they left it —it's perfect, it's so classy." [...] Kirkman was content with the idea of teasing Jenner's revelation in lieu of blatantly revealing anything about the origins of the virus. [...] "I {{thought it was a great}} addition. I'm very much opposed to showing what the actual cause [...] is and explaining how things work, but teasing a little bit is a great thing. If it adds an extra layer to the drama, then I'm all for it," [...] he stated. [...] "It also led up to the fantastic mystery of the whisper Jenner gives to Rick at the end of that scene. That's going to play into Season 2 quite a bit. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> that's going and it's really a cool bit." [...] It is not until the second season finale, [...] "Beside the Dying Fire", that Rick reveals Jenner's message to the group.|$|E

2500|$|While {{performing}} at London's Royal Albert Hall in 1944, Clark {{was discovered by}} film director Maurice Elvey, who cast her as precocious orphaned waif Irma in his weepy war drama Medal for the General. In quick succession, she performed in Strawberry Roan, <b>I</b> <b>Know</b> <b>Where</b> I'm Going!, London Town, [...] Here Come the Huggetts, Vote for Huggett and The Huggetts Abroad, the second, third and fourth of four Huggett Family films based on a British radio series. Although some of the films she made in the UK during the 1940s and 1950s were B-films, she worked with Anthony Newley in Vice Versa (directed by Peter Ustinov) and Alec Guinness in The Card {{as well as the}} aforementioned <b>I</b> <b>Know</b> <b>Where</b> I'm Going! which is a Powell and Pressburger feature film now generally regarded as a masterpiece (Clark's part was small).|$|E
6000|$|... "Under the eaves. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>where</b> {{they were}} kept," [...] said Gabriel, {{following}} him. [...] "Coggan, {{you can ride}} bare-backed? there's no time to look for saddles." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, ma'am, an' <b>I</b> <b>knows</b> <b>where</b> liars don't go to," [...] {{returned}} Billy, {{looking up}} with pious resignation, whereat the Miss Seawards and Ruth {{burst into a}} laugh.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{should think}} it most improbable," [...] Mangan confessed. [...] "As {{a matter of}} fact, he asked {{me the other day}} if <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>where</b> their {{premises}} were." ...|$|R
2500|$|The Swedish {{photographer}} Lennart Nilsson, {{who became}} world {{famous for his}} documentation of pregnancy from conception to birth, {{was asked by the}} magazine Life to photograph Birgit Nilsson's vocal cords as she sang high C. Birgit Nilsson turned the proposal down with the words [...] "Your photographer wants me to swallow the tiny camera so he can take pictures of the vocal cord [...] I don't want that, since <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> it has been before." [...] Eventually, though, she agreed on having the pictures taken.|$|E
2500|$|In August 2009, Davies {{stated that}} the fourth series was [...] "ready to go", {{and that he had}} the next series planned out, stating, [...] "I know exactly how to pick it up. I've got a shape in mind, and I've got stories. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> you'd find Gwen and Rhys, and their baby, and Jack, and I know how you'd go forward with a new form of Torchwood." [...] At the time, he stated he would prefer for the series four to be another mini-series, though he has no qualms about doing another thirteen-episode run. A November 2009 article posted on Eve Myles's website stated that {{shooting}} for the fourth series was to begin in January 2011; ...|$|E
2500|$|There {{was known}} to be {{pressure}} from within the party to force Klein out sooner than planned. [...] On March 23, 2006, Infrastructure and Transportation Minister Lyle Oberg was suspended from the party's legislative caucus for six months and dismissed from the Cabinet after he told constituents in Brooks that he would not urge delegates at the March 31 leadership review to support Klein. [...] Oberg had been considered a contender for the leadership prior to this decision, but described the premier's directive regarding the June 1 deadline as a [...] "bombshell" [...] and infuriated fellow Tories when he told constituents [...] "If I were the premier, I wouldn't want me sitting as a backbencher... <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> all the skeletons are." [...] Despite this, Oberg pressed on with his leadership campaign and was re-admitted to caucus on July 25, 2006.|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps, {{although}} {{he can be}} very oily {{when he wants to}} be. Oh, if only <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>where</b> my folks were!" [...] sighed the boy from the country.|$|R
6000|$|... "I was thoughtful. To {{some extent}} you're accountable. When one {{is forced to}} loaf one has time to ponder, and when you inquired if <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> went--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{hell of it}} is that <b>I</b> <b>know</b> not <b>where</b> to find a home, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> not <b>where</b> {{home may}} be after all these years. If ye send me forth, I shall become a {{wanderer}} of no account." ...|$|R
2500|$|Slug also dislikes some of {{the songs}} that he wrote before and does not perform them live, such as [...] "Vampires" [...] from 2002 album God Loves Ugly. Daley has stated, [...] "when I did get my phase of trying to figure myself out, {{there was a lot}} of tug-of-war inside of me between wanting to hate a {{particular}} woman and then feeling guilty about that. And there’s certain songs that I won’t perform anymore, because the game of tug-of-war is over and <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> I’m at". Furthermore, Slug has criticized Atmosphere's first album Overcast!, saying: [...] "It's obvious that I’m trying so fucking hard on Overcast and you can see through it and tell it's not a person it's more of an attempt at trying to fill the niche, it was like I was trying to prove to myself that I was a rapper." ...|$|E
2500|$|On October 11, the {{day after}} the hijackers had disembarked the ship, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak lied to the media when asked about them saying they had left within hours of coming ashore, [...] "They have {{actually}} left Egypt. I do not know exactly where they have gone. Perhaps they have left for Tunisia." [...] His foreign Minister Esmat Abdel Meguid reiterated the same message [...] "They left Egypt. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> they are, but I am not going to tell you." [...] Mubarak would also falsely insist that the hijackers had left Egypt before he had information about Captain De Rosa's correction, [...] "If the captain had told us that a passenger had been killed, we would have changed our position toward the whole operation. But when this [...] emerged, we already had sent the hijackers out of the country." [...] Mubarak also repeated the suggestion that no one had been killed [...] "There is no body and no proof he has been murdered. Maybe the man is hiding or did not board the ship at all." [...] At the time of Mubarak's statements to the news media, the U.S. Administration had already received intelligence information that the hijackers were still in Egypt.|$|E
