At the bridge, Lil' Kim appears in a bikini and a sheer black blouse, and dances in her <b>high</b> <b>heels.</b> The argument ends with Aguilera spraying the men with a water hose, which she holds between her legs and parodies the penis.|$|E
25|$|<b>High</b> <b>heels</b> are not {{a modern}} {{invention}} but there is confusion regarding when they were developed. Research shows that <b>high</b> <b>heels</b> {{can be traced back}} to ancient Egypt. In the middle of the second millennium BC, Egyptians began to frequently use sandals. Retention was obtained generally by the Egyptians by a T or V thong passing through the sole. Egyptian butchers also wore heeled shoes for practical purposes, in order to keep their feet clean of any blood while slaughtering animals. Also, a 12th-century (AD) sculpture from Ramappa Temple (India) shows a lady, highly clad in jewelry, wearing <b>high</b> <b>heels.</b>|$|E
25|$|High-heeled {{footwear}} (often abbreviated as <b>high</b> <b>heels</b> {{or simply}} heels) is footwear {{that raises the}} heel of the wearer's foot {{significantly higher than the}} toes. When both the heel and the toes are raised equal amounts, as in a platform shoe, it is technically not considered to be a high heel; however, there are also high-heeled platform shoes. <b>High</b> <b>heels</b> tend to give the aesthetic illusion of longer, more slender legs. <b>High</b> <b>heels</b> come {{in a wide variety of}} styles, and the heels are found in many different shapes, including stiletto, pump (court shoe), block, tapered, blade, and wedge.|$|E
40|$|The goal on this {{investigation}} {{was to develop a}} detachable <b>high</b> <b>heel</b> shoe construction that could enter the current <b>high</b> <b>heel</b> market. The impact of <b>high</b> <b>heel</b> shoes on women's fashion is enormous but there are associated issues of comfort and health with these shoes. This work aims to maintain the appealing aspects of a <b>high</b> <b>heel</b> shoe while adding a concealed mechanism to enable the heel to be easily removed to convert the shoe into a flat at the discretion of the user. The current solutions and products in the nearly 7 billion dollar a year women's shoe market are minimal. The prior arts of detachable heels fail to develop a simple comprehensive detachable <b>high</b> <b>heel</b> that can enter the market. A feasible and complete design that takes into account arch stiffness, heel removal, styling, and manufacturability is the goal of this work. This investigation deconstructed <b>high</b> <b>heel</b> shoes to learn and leverage the current <b>high</b> <b>heel</b> shoe infrastructure as a basis for adapting the shoe into a detachable <b>high</b> <b>heel</b> shoe construction. Three prototypes of the detachable <b>high</b> <b>heel</b> shoe were developed with a shoe assembly that consisted of a modified insole and a detachable heel that consisted of a dovetailed aluminum shank fastened to a <b>high</b> <b>heel.</b> (cont.) The prototypes were able to display the ability for the detachable <b>high</b> <b>heel</b> to maintain <b>high</b> <b>heel</b> stability, styling that is consistent with the industry, ease of use, a flat shoe and other critical functional requirements identified in the work. The construction was consistent with the current industry <b>high</b> <b>heel</b> infrastructure. The development of the detachable <b>high</b> <b>heel</b> construction displays the feasibility of such a product in a market where none exist. The detachable <b>high</b> <b>heel</b> construction needs further refinement and optimization to complete a design that is ready to enter this exciting market. by Alfredo Louis Morales. Thesis (S.

40|$|Title The {{effect of}} wearing <b>high</b> <b>heel</b> shoes on pelvis motion Aim of the thesis The main {{aim of this}} thesis is the {{verification}} {{of the influence of}} wearing <b>high</b> <b>heel</b> shoes on pelvis motion in the sagittal plane, while walking on <b>high</b> <b>heel</b> shoes and walking on heel less shoes. After then, we want to monitori the impact of walking in these shoes on the trajectory of pelvis motion. Methods Objectification method was 3 D record of human gait (= kinematic analysis), which was performed using the Qualisys Track Manager. In our thesis we used the method of comparison. The aim of the study is the comparison of parameters measured in different types of shoes (<b>high</b> <b>heeled</b> shoes, <b>high</b> <b>heeled</b> less shoes with barefoot gait) and the influence on pelvis motion in the sagittal plane. Measurements were carried out in the gym at the Faculty of Physical Education and Sport at ten probands. Results Pelvis tilt to retroversion was more significant when walking on heel less shoes compared with <b>high</b> <b>heel</b> shoes and barefooted walking, also an angle of the trunk and pelvis were most significantly diminished when walking on heel less shoes compared to barefooted walking and <b>high</b> <b>heel</b> shoes. Objectively, a larger deflection of pelvis trajectory while walking on <b>high</b> <b>heel</b> shoes was not confirmed compared to walking on heel less [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Wearing <b>high</b> <b>heeled</b> {{footwear}} during gait increases {{risks of}} trips and falls, and suffering from lower-limb injuries. <b>High</b> <b>heel</b> footwear increases knee extension moment and hence knee joint load. Consequently, prolonged wearing of <b>high</b> <b>heel</b> footwear may increase risks of knee osteoarthritis. Although, {{many studies have}} investigated the effect of heel height on knee joint moments, most studies do {{not account for the}} confounding effect of walking speed. Three-dimensional gait analysis and inverse dynamics were used to investigate the effect of heel height and walking speed on the peak knee joint moment during stance. This found heel height affects the peak knee extension moment more significantly than walking speed. More importantly, this study shows that wearers of <b>higher</b> <b>heel</b> heights are likely to be exposed to greater knee compression forces than when walking faster...|$|R
