Article 7, which sets down this regime, provides that such substances can only be moved in international trade when both exporter and importer are government authorities, or government agencies or institutions specially authorized for the purpose; in addition to this very rigid identification of supplier and recipient, in each case export and <b>import</b> <b>authorization</b> is also mandatory.|$|E
50|$|TAM {{went on to}} {{purchase}} three used Fokker F27 turboprops, which were subsequently refurbished by Fokker in the Netherlands. In order to obtain the <b>import</b> <b>authorization</b> for the aircraft, a deal was struck with the government in which TAM was forced to maintain 3 Bandeirantes for every F27, as well as removing 5 seats from each one, bringing the F27's capacity down to 40 passengers. A fourth F27, previously owned by Air New Zealand, {{was added to the}} TAM fleet in 1981. By 1983, TAM had acquired 10 F27s. By 1981, TAM had flown one million passengers, and two million by 1984.|$|E
40|$|The {{staff of}} the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC or Commission) has {{prepared}} an environmental assessment (EA) on the liquefied natural gas (LNG) facilities proposed by Southern LNG, Inc. (Southern LNG) in the above-referenced docket. The EA was prepared {{to satisfy the requirements}} of the National Environmental Policy Act. The staff concludes that approval of the proposed project, with appropriate mitigating measures, would not constitute a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment. The EA assesses the potential environmental effects of the proposed project which includes expansion of the existing Elba Island LNG import terminal in Chatham County, Georgia. Southern LNG proposes to: construct an LNG unloading slip cut into Elba Island with two ship unloading docks; construct a 1, 000, 000 -barrel double walled LNG storage tank; construct two boil-off gas compressors; construct two first-stage (booster) LNG pumps; construct a recondenser vessel; construct three second-stage LNG pumps; construct three submerged combustion vaporizers; and construct a motor control center. The proposed facilities would expand the storage and sendout capacity of Southern LNG's existing LNG import terminal in Chatham County, Georgia. The proposal would: 1) expand the storage capacity of the terminal; and 2) increase the sustainable daily sendout capability to 806 million standard cubic feet per day (MMscf/d) and its peaking capacity to 1, 2 15 MMscf/d. Southern LNG seeks <b>import</b> <b>authorization</b> in Docket No. CPO 2 - 379 - 000. The EA has been placed in the public files of the FERC. A limited number o...|$|E

The new system has the potential to increase the efficacy of the control system in Third Countries, to reduce the bureaucracy for international trade and competitive disadvantages for non-European certification bodies.

40|$|In 1988, the European Community (EC) and the People s Republic ofChina {{signed an}} Agreement on Trade in Textile Products, which setquantitative {{restrictions}} on Chinese imports into member countries. In 1996, the European Commission (Commission), which oversees and monitorsthe {{implementation of the}} agreement, found that the Chinese authoritieshad issued export licenses for textile products that exceeded the 1995 quantitative limits agreed upon between the EU and China. As a result,the products sent from China remained blocked on entry at Europeancustoms ports. The Chinese authorities admitted that an error hadoccurred, mostly due to {{a breakdown of the}} computer system. But othercomplicating factors, especially the falsi cation of export licenses,also hindered the Chinese administration s ability to monitor thegranting of export and <b>import</b> <b>authorizations.</b> Under the circumstances,the Chinese authorities requested the application of exible measuresby admitting the 1995 imports and reducing the 1996 quotas by an equalamount. ...|$|R

40|$|Genetically {{modified}} (GM) {{products are}} largely traded internationally in a commingled way. Despite {{the reluctance of}} their consumers, large western importers of maize, canola and soybeans, like Japan or the European Union have approved the imports {{of a number of}} key GM products. But with the acceleration in the release of new GM crop varieties in major commodity exporters (like the United States, Argentina, or Brazil), these and other importers are becoming concerned with delayed <b>import</b> <b>authorizations</b> and the increasing risk of temporary trade disruptions due to the adventitious presence of unapproved GM products conflicting with their zero percent tolerance for unapproved GM products. The consequence of such disruption is higher prices: importers either have to switch to less efficient GM suppliers or to non-GM suppliers to respond to their needs. To address this issue, members of the Codex Alimentarius have recently adopted a guideline (“the Codex Annex”) which proposes the use of a simplified risk assessment procedure for GM products approved at exporters but not yet at importers and potentially present in low levels in commodity shipments. However, this guideline does not specify what level of tolerance countries should apply and which products it should cover. In this paper, we model the economic effects of different implementatio...|$|R

40|$|Parallel imports are genuine {{products}} <b>imported</b> {{without the}} <b>authorization</b> of the trademark or copyright owner in a country. Authorized dealers have employed trademark and copyright law to exclude parallel imports using claims of infringement. Our assertion is that trademark and copyright laws are inappropriate for enforcing restrictions against parallel imports for two reasons. First, trademark exclusion of parallel imports indiscriminately eliminates intrabrand competition {{and should be}} scrutinized from an antitrust perspective. Second, trademark laws inefficiently constrain the feasible set of distribution systems. We propose a policy combining contract, tort, and antitrust law to regulate parallel imports. ...|$|R
