We measured {{the ratio of the}} spin diffusion coefficient to the mobility of spin-polarized carriers. From the wavelength dependence of the ratio, we found that the spin diffusion and drift of holes became as important as electrons in this undoped MQW, and the ratio for light holes was much smaller than that for heavy holes at room temperature.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} we develop {{and use a}} {{continuum}} random walk framework to solve problems that are usually studied using a discrete random walk on a discrete lattice. Problems studied include; {{the time it takes}} for a random walker to be absorbed at a trap on a fractal lattice, the calculation of the spectral dimension for several different classes of networks, the calculation of the density of states for a multi-layered Bethe lattice and the relationship between diffusion exponents and a resistivity exponent that occur in relevant power laws. The majority of the results are obtained by deriving an expression for a Laplace transformed Green’s function or first passage time, and then using Tauberian theorems to find the relevant asymptotic behaviour. The continuum framework is established by studying the diffusion equation on a 1 -d bar with non-homogeneous boundary conditions. The result is extended to model diffusion on networks through linear algebra. We derive the transformation linking the Green’s functions and first passage time results in the continuum and discrete settings. The continuum method is used in conjunction with renormalization techniques to calculate the time taken for a random walker to be absorbed at a trap on a fractal lattice and also to find the spectral dimension of new classes of networks. Although these networks can be embedded in the d- dimensional Euclidean plane, {{they do not have a}} spectral dimension equal to twice the ratio of the fractal dimension and the random walk dimension when the random walk on the network is transient. The networks therefore violate the Alexander-Orbach law. The fractal <b>Einstein</b> <b>relationship</b> (a relationship relating a diffusion exponent to a resistivity exponent) also does not hold on these networks. Through a suitable scaling argument, we derive a generalised fractal <b>Einstein</b> <b>relationship</b> which holds for our lattices and explains anomalous results concerning transport on diffusion limited aggregates and Eden trees...|$|E

40|$|Most {{force field}} models for Room {{temperature}} ionic liquids cannot properly elucidate statics and dynamics. It {{is in this}} context that we set to assess {{the most efficient way to}} model RTILs while maintaining the integrity of the liquids statics and dynamics. The development approach begins with the investigation of the effects that the linear scaling of partial atomic charges on nonpolarisable force fields from a reference potential has on the structure and dynamics of the room temperature ionic liquids (RTILs) 1 -butyl- 3 -methylimidazolium tetraflouroborate [C 4 MIM][BF 4] and 1 -butyl- 3 -methylimidazolium hexaflourophosphate [C 4 MIM][PF 6]. The results show that the three-dimensional structure of the liquid is changed ever so slighter by the linear scaling of atomic charges. While dynamic properties such as viscosity and self-diffusion coefficients were majorly affected by charge scaling. Self-diffusion coefficients that span a range of four orders of magnitude between the original model and the scaled model where the ionic charge was ± 0. 6 e. Viscosity estimates calculated using the Green-Kubo and the <b>Einstein</b> <b>relationships</b> revealed that the linear scaling of atomic charges results in increased mobility of the simulated liquid. Implicit inclusion of polarisation effects was investigated, Here a new charge scheme development using Quantum mechanics/Molecular mechanics (QM/MM) methods in CHARMM 35 interfaced with GAMESS-UK was propose. The atomic charges were derived from liquid phase calculations using an iterative procedure. This was carried out for individual ions and cation-anion pairs, for the analysis of charge transfer, within the liquid environment. The results obtained gave predictions of density, liquid structure and self-diffusion coefficients that were in excellent agreement with experimental data available. This method is preferable over the commonly used charge scaling methodology which is deem as an unphysical approach for the simulation of [C 4 MIM][BF 4] and [C 4 MIM][PF 6]. A polarisable force field based on the Drude oscillator model is presented. The model proves to be most effective for the simulation of RTILs.

30|$|In conclusion, {{the spin}} {{diffusion}} and drift at different wavelengths and different temperatures {{have been studied}} in undoped InGaAs/AlGaAs MQW. By using the AHE and ACPGE which are all derived from RSHE, we obtained the ratio between the spin diffusion coefficient and the mobility of spin-polarized carriers. From the wavelength dependence of the ratio, {{we found that the}} spin diffusion and drift of holes became as important as electrons in this undoped MQW, and the ratio for light holes was much smaller than that for heavy holes at room temperature. From the temperature dependence of the ratio corresponding to the 1 hh- 1 e transition, we believed the ratio is contributed by the combined effect of spin-polarized electrons and spin-polarized heavy holes. The correction factors for the common <b>Einstein</b> <b>relationship</b> for spin-polarized electrons and heavy holes are firstly obtained to be 93 and 286, respectively. It is worth noting that the AHE and ACPGE measurements used in this study are conducted under ambient conditions with a simple setup and operation, which provides a good method for the study of spin-related diffusion and drift.|$|E
40|$|The Einstein {{relation}} between spontaneous emission and absorption was originally derived {{for a system}} consists of a two-state subsystem representing matter and harmonic fields representing radiation. The derivation {{is based on the}} detailed balance between these two subsystems under thermal equilibrium. The relationship was later investigated in connection with the interactions between radiation field and solids or semiconductors. The simple derivation dose not hold for semiconductors in general. In certain limiting cases, simple relation was obtained. The validity of this relation is important not only because of its fundamental role connecting two of the most fundamental optical processes in semiconductors, but mostly also because of its wide use as a practical method to measure the optical gain of a semiconductor. The validity of this relation for semiconductors has been an issue of controversial for some time. In this paper we numerically examine the validity of this relationship for several different lineshapes including Lorentzian, Gaussian, Sech, and a convoluted double Lorentzians (CDL). We find out that at relatively low density above transparency level, all first three lineshapes violate the Einstein relation. The relation is approximately valid at high density. At very high density, the validity of the Einstein relation holds well for all three lineshapes. The reason behind this observation is explained. The CDL lineshape has been shown analytically to obey the <b>Einstein</b> <b>relationship</b> previously. We show that for a 2 D semiconductor with parabolic bands, the CDL lineshape can be integrated analytically. This analytic lineshape is compared with a simple Lorentzian lineshape...|$|E
40|$|A {{detailed}} analysis of the photophysical behaviour of uranyl ion in aqueous solutions at room temperature is given using literature data, together with results of new experimental and theoretical studies to see whether the decay mechanism of the lowest excited state involves physical deactivation by energy transfer or a chemical process through hydrogen atom abstraction. Comparison of the radiative lifetimes determined from quantum yield and lifetime data with that obtained from the <b>Einstein</b> <b>relationship</b> strongly suggests that the emitting state is identical to that observed in the lowest energy absorption band. From study of the experimental rate and that calculated theoretically, from deuterium isotope effects and the activation energy for decay support is given to a deactivation mechanism of hydrogen abstraction involving water clusters to give uranium(V) and hydroxyl radicals. Support for hydroxyl radical formation comes from electron spin resonance spectra observed {{in the presence of the}} spin traps 5, 5 -dimethyl- 1 -pyrroline N-oxide and tert-butyl-N-phenylnitrone and from literature results on photoinduced uranyl oxygen exchange and photoconductivity. It has previously been suggested that the uranyl emission above pH 1. 5 may involve an exciplex between excited uranyl ion and uranium(V). Evidence against this mechanism is given on the basis of quenching of uranyl luminescence by uranium(V), together with other kinetic reasoning. No overall photochemical reaction is observed on excitation of aqueous uranyl solutions, and it is suggested that this is mainly due to reoxidation of UO 2 + by hydroxyl radicals in a radical pair. An alternative process involving oxidation by molecular oxygen is analysed experimentally and theoretically, and is suggested to be too slow to be a major reoxidation pathway. [URL]...|$|E

The constancy of speed implies that all elementary free particles can be described {{in the same manner as}} photons, by means of a wave equation. The resulting wave mechanics (with a few small assumptions) is simply the traditional form of quantum mechanics.

Measurements take place over a entire range of temperature and over a entire range of doping concentration of holes in n-silicon and of electrons in p-silicon. The results are compared with the usually used data. The mobility model according to D. B. M. Klaassen, used in many device simulators, is used as reference. The mobility values are converted into diffusion coefficients {{with the help of}} the <b>einstein</b> <b>relationship.</b> Special attention is given to the experimental method. Special value is put to determine the diffusion coefficient in a maximally direct way. The focus of {{the present study}} is the practical development and application of the experiment. The mobility model according to Klaassen is confirmed for high temperatures for all measured doping concentrations. With doping concentrations below the Mott-transition deviations exist between measurement results and converted mobilities according to Klaassen. The deviations increase with decreasing of temperature on the one hand, and with increasing of doping concentration on the other hand and can be explained with excitons. Therefor a weighted average diffusion coefficient is formed wich lies between the diffusion coefficient according to Klaassen and the diffusion coefficient of the excitons. The weighting factor is the relative exciton concentration. The comparison between this weighted averaged diffusion coefficient with the measurement results supplies a very good agreement over the entire range of temperature. With doping concentrations above the Mott-transition no excitons can form. Here, the measurement results are compared with converted mobilities according to Klaassen. The comparison between these two diffusion coefficients also results in a very good agreement over the entire range of temperature...|$|E
