Since {{the changes were}} Alfvénic in nature, {{it is possible that}} wave propagation effects {{must be taken into account}} in determining an exact arrival time. The solar wind is generally super-Alfvénic near Earth, as backed up by a direct calculation of the Alfvén speed being 100 km/s, and OMNI’s <b>indicated</b> Alfvén <b>Mach</b> <b>number</b> of about 5, so we conclude that such effects should be small. Without looking at causality, Jackel et al. (2012) found that for a large set of solar wind pressure changes, effects are felt at geosynchronous orbit within minutes of magnetopause impact. In our single case we can only say that unusual changes in the solar wind were observed essentially simultaneosly with unusual changes on the ground. With more fortuitous placement of spacecraft in other cases, we may be able to reach a time measuring threshhold to definitely establish causality for other impulse events, of which we have already detected many in the few months that AUTUMNX has operated.|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} noted in some {{experiments}} that the local <b>Mach</b> <b>number</b> just ahead of a shock wave on an aerofoil in subsonic flow is limited, values of the limit {{of the order of}} 1. 4 are usually quoted. This note presents two lines of thought indicating how such a limit may arise. The first starts with the observation that the pressure after the shock will not be higher than the rain stream pressure. Fig. 1 shows the calculated relation between local <b>Mach</b> <b>number</b> ahead of the shock (M„ 1), shock inclination (S), mainstream <b>Mach</b> <b>number</b> (M 1) and pressure coefficient just aft of the shock. • (Cp) It is noted that, for given M 1, Cp and. 5,two shocks are possible in general, a strong one for which Ms, > 1. 48, and a weak one for which MS 1 < 1. 48, and it is argued that the latter is the more likely. The second approach is {{based on the fact that}} a relation between stream deflection (8) and <b>Mach</b> <b>number</b> for the flow in the limited supersonics regions on a number of aerofoils has been derived from some. experimental data. Further analysis of experimental data is required before this relation can be accepted as general. If it is accepted, however, then it <b>indicates</b> that the <b>Mach</b> <b>numbers</b> increase above unity for a given deflection is about one-third of that given by simple wave theory (Fig. 2). An analysis of the possible deflections on aerofoils of various thicknesses (Fig. 3) then indicates that deflections corresponding to local <b>Mach</b> <b>numbers</b> of the order of 1, 5 or higher are unlikely except at incidences of the order of 5 ° or more, and may then be more likely for thick wings than for thin wings. Flow breakaway will make the attainment of such high local <b>Mach</b> <b>numbers</b> less likely...|$|R

The performance of these thermometers is described by two parameters, the reoovery factor and the time constant, values of which were obtained.

40|$|We {{report on}} a Suzaku {{measurement}} of the shock feature associated with the western radio relic in the merging cluster A 3376. The temperature profile is characterized by an almost flat radial shape with kT ~ 4 keV within 0. 5 r 200 and a rise by about 1 keV inside the radio relic. Across the relic region (0. 6 - 0. 8 r 200), the temperature shows a remarkable drop from about 4. 7 keV to 1. 3 keV. This is a clear evidence that the radio relic really corresponds to a shock front possibly caused by a past major merger. The observed sharp changes of the temperature and electron density <b>indicate</b> the <b>Mach</b> <b>number</b> M~ 3. The radial entropy profile is flatter than the prediction (r^ 1. 1) of numerical simulations within 0. 5 r 200 }, and becomes steeper around the relic region. These observed features and time-scale estimation consistently imply that the ICM around the radio relic has experienced a merger shock {{and is in the}} middle of the process of dynamical and thermal relaxation.
