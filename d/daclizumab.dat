5|$|As of 2017, eleven disease-modifying {{medications}} {{have been}} approved by regulatory agencies for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). They are interferon beta-1a, interferon beta-1b, glatiramer acetate, mitoxantrone, natalizumab, fingolimod, teriflunomide, dimethyl fumarate, alemtuzumab, <b>daclizumab,</b> and ocrelizumab.|$|E
5|$|Monoclonal antibodies, {{which are}} drugs {{of the same}} family as natalizumab, have also raised high levels of {{interest}} and research. Alemtuzumab, <b>daclizumab</b> and CD20 monoclonal antibodies such as rituximab, ocrelizumab and ofatumumab have all shown some benefit and are under study as potential treatments for MS. Nevertheless, their use has also been accompanied {{by the appearance of}} potentially dangerous adverse effects, most importantly opportunistic infections. Related to these investigations is the recent development of a test against JC virus antibodies which might help to predict what patients are at a greater risk of developing progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy when taking natalizumab. While monoclonal antibodies are probably going to have some role in the treatment of the disease in the future, it is believed that it will be small due to the risks associated to them.|$|E
25|$|The Edmonton {{protocol}} uses {{a combination}} of immunosuppressive drugs, including <b>daclizumab</b> (Zenapax), sirolimus (Rapamune) and tacrolimus (Prograf). <b>Daclizumab</b> is given intravenously right after the transplant and then discontinued. Sirolimus and tacrolimus, the two main drugs that keep the immune system from destroying the transplanted islets, must be taken for life.|$|E
25|$|Monoclonal {{antibodies}} {{used for}} autoimmune diseases include infliximab and adalimumab, which {{are effective in}} rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease and ulcerative Colitis by their ability to bind to and inhibit TNF-α. Basiliximab and <b>daclizumab</b> inhibit IL-2 on activated T cells and thereby help preventing acute rejection of kidney transplants. Omalizumab inhibits human immunoglobulin E (IgE) and is useful in moderate-to-severe allergic asthma.|$|E
500|$|Medications {{approved}} by the FDA include currently eleven medications: interferons beta-1a and [...] beta-1b, four monoclonal antibodies: natalizumab, alemtuzumab, <b>daclizumab</b> and ocrelizumab, and five immunomodulators: glatiramer acetate, mitoxantrone, [...] fingolimod, teriflunomide, dimethyl fumarate.|$|E
500|$|Their cost {{effectiveness}} as of 2012 is unclear. [...] In May 2016 the FDA approved <b>daclizumab</b> {{for the treatment}} of relapsing multiple sclerosis in adults, with requirements for postmarketing studies and submission of a formal risk evaluation and mitigation strategy. [...] In March 2017 the FDA approved ocrelizumab, a humanized anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, as a treatment for RRMS, with requirements for several Phase IV clinical trials.|$|E
50|$|<b>Daclizumab</b> (trade name Zinbryta, by Biogen) is a {{therapeutic}} humanized monoclonal antibody {{used for the}} treatment of adults with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS). <b>Daclizumab</b> works by binding to CD25, the alpha subunit of the IL-2 receptor of T-cells.|$|E
50|$|The Edmonton {{protocol}} uses {{a combination}} of immunosuppressive drugs, including <b>daclizumab</b> (Zenapax), sirolimus (Rapamune) and tacrolimus (Prograf). <b>Daclizumab</b> is given intravenously right after the transplant and then discontinued. Sirolimus and tacrolimus, the two main drugs that keep the immune system from destroying the transplanted islets, must be taken for life.|$|E
50|$|The {{multiple}} sclerosis drug <b>daclizumab</b> binds to and blocks IL2RA.|$|E
50|$|<b>Daclizumab</b> blocks IL-2 receptors {{containing}} the alpha subunit (CD25), {{which include the}} high-affinity receptors. Medium-affinity receptors, on the other hand, consist of two beta subunits (CD122) and are not affected by <b>daclizumab.</b> While the exact mechanism is unknown, the net effect is a reduction of T-cell responses and expansion of CD56bright natural killer cells.|$|E
5000|$|PDL began {{clinical}} trials of <b>daclizumab</b> on its own, and in September 2004 after the drug had shown promise in a Phase II trial, PDL and Roche agreed {{to expand their}} relationship to include codevelopment of <b>daclizumab</b> for asthma and other respiratory conditions. [...] In August 2005, PDL and Biogen Idec agreed to collaborate to develop <b>daclizumab</b> in indications outside the fields of organ rejection and respiratory disease. [...] In November 2005 Roche and PDL agreed to try to develop a formulation of <b>daclizumab</b> that would be useful as a subcutaneous injection for longterm maintenance in organ transplant. [...] The next year Roche and PDL announced that the collaboration for all indications was ending, and in 2009 it {{announced that it was}} discontinuing Zenapax worldwide [...] "in view of available alternative treatments and the diminishing market demand" [...] and [...] "not due to any safety issue." ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Daclizumab</b> {{has been}} studied in a small {{clinical}} trial of people with birdshot chorioretinopathy.|$|E
50|$|The {{biological}} half-life is 21 days. Patients who developed antibodies against <b>daclizumab</b> eliminated it 19% faster.|$|E
50|$|After {{subcutaneous}} injection {{of a single}} dose, <b>daclizumab</b> has a bioavailability of about 90% and reaches highest blood plasma levels after 5 to 7 days. Given every four weeks, steady state concentrations are found after the fourth dose. It is expected that <b>daclizumab,</b> like other antibodies, is degraded by proteases to peptides and finally amino acids, {{and that it does}} not interact with cytochrome P450 liver enzymes.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Daclizumab</b> is used {{to treat}} adults with {{relapsing}} forms of multiple sclerosis. [...] It is administered subcutaneously.|$|E
50|$|As an antibody, <b>daclizumab</b> is {{expected}} to have a very low potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with other drugs.|$|E
5000|$|One of the {{development}} programs that PDL had transferred to Facet {{was the use of}} <b>daclizumab</b> in indications it had never licensed to Roche, including multiple sclerosis. Facet partnered that development program with Biogen Idec which attempted a hostile buy out of Facet for $350M in 2009; Facet rejected that offer and was purchased by Abbvie for $450 million in cash the next year. [...] The FDA approved <b>daclizumab</b> for multiple sclerosis in 2016 under the trade name Zinbryta.|$|E
50|$|Drugs that inhibit IL-2 receptors, such as {{basiliximab}} and <b>daclizumab</b> {{are used}} in conjunction with other drugs to prevent immune rejection of transplants.|$|E
50|$|Medications {{approved}} by the FDA include currently eleven medications: interferons beta-1a and beta-1b, four monoclonal antibodies: natalizumab, alemtuzumab, <b>daclizumab</b> and ocrelizumab, and five immunomodulators: glatiramer acetate, mitoxantrone, fingolimod, teriflunomide, dimethyl fumarate.|$|E
5000|$|... in 2008 PDL {{spun out}} its active {{development}} programs into {{a company called}} Facet Biotech and development of <b>daclizumab</b> for multiple sclerosis and the partnership with Biogen was included in that spinout. [...] In 2009 Biogen attempted a hostile buy out of Facet for $350M; Facet rejected that offer and was purchased by Abbvie for $450 million in cash the next year. [...] In May 2016 the FDA approved <b>daclizumab</b> {{for the treatment of}} relapsing multiple sclerosis in adults in 2016 under the trade name Zinbryta, with requirements for postmarketing studies and to submit a formal Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy.|$|E
50|$|Anti-IL-2Rα {{receptor}} antibodies such as basiliximab and <b>daclizumab</b> {{are increasingly}} being used in place of ATG as an induction therapy, as they do not cause cytokine release syndrome and (theoretically) improve the development of tolerance.|$|E
50|$|As of 2017, eleven disease-modifying {{medications}} {{have been}} approved by regulatory agencies for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). They are interferon beta-1a, interferon beta-1b, glatiramer acetate, mitoxantrone, natalizumab, fingolimod, teriflunomide, dimethyl fumarate, alemtuzumab, <b>daclizumab,</b> and ocrelizumab.|$|E
50|$|The {{approved}} {{drugs for}} RRMS are: Two interferons (interferon beta-1a and interferon beta-1b), glatiramer acetate, mitoxantrone, teriflunomide, dimethyl fumarate, one S1P modulator (fingolimod) and finally three monoclonal antibodies (natalizumab, alemtuzumab <b>Daclizumab</b> and since March 2017 Ocrelizumab).|$|E
5000|$|As of 2016, {{there are}} 10 active {{principles}} approved which are: Two interferons (interferon beta-1a and interferon beta-1b), glatiramer acetate, mitoxantrone, fingolimod, teriflunomide, dimethyl fumarate and finally three monoclonal antibodies (natalizumab, alemtuzumab and since May 2016 <b>daclizumab)</b> ...|$|E
50|$|A {{preliminary}} list {{of drugs}} {{to be evaluated}} includes rociletinib, AZD-9291, necitumumab, nivolumab, and pembrolizumab for small-cell lung cancer; fingolimod, dimethyl fumarate, teriflunomide, alemtuzumab, and <b>daclizumab</b> for multiple sclerosis; and ixekizumab and brodalumab for psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis.|$|E
50|$|Immunosuppressive {{drugs such}} as the {{therapeutic}} monoclonal antibody <b>daclizumab,</b> ciclosporin and methotrexate {{have proven to be}} effective treatment options for birdshot chorioretinopathy. Substantial reduction and even stabilization of both vitreous inflammation and retinal vasculitis have been evident via electroretinography, during <b>daclizumab</b> (IL-2 receptor blocker) therapy. This is also supported by the observation of elevated levels of IL-2 in the eyes of patients. Loss of visual acuity unrelated to the inflammation caused by the disorder, however, often remains unchanged despite usage of the drug. This is reflected by the lack of difference in visual acuity and the vision-related quality of life among various treatment categories in birdshot patients. Contraindications and adverse side-effects are always a factor, as well.|$|E
50|$|In {{clinical}} trials for MS, {{there were no}} treatment-related deaths or increased risk of cancer; side effects that occurred more frequently with <b>daclizumab</b> versus interferon included infections (65% versus 57%), skin rashes (37% versus 19%) and liver complications (approximately 18% versus 12%).|$|E
50|$|Muromonab-CD3 is {{approved}} for the therapy of acute, glucocorticoid-resistant rejection of allogeneic renal, heart and liver transplants. Unlike the monoclonal antibodies basiliximab and <b>daclizumab,</b> {{it is not}} approved for prophylaxis of transplant rejection, although a 1996 review has {{found it to be}} safe for that purpose.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Daclizumab</b> was {{approved}} {{and used to}} prevent acute rejection of kidney transplant, along with cyclosporine and corticosteroids. [...] For that indication, side effects with a frequency of at least 10% included sleeplessness, tremor, headache, arterial hypertension, dyspnoea, gastrointestinal side effects and oedema. In rare cases, the drug could cause severe anaphylaxis.|$|E
50|$|As myeloma cells, {{they are}} {{naturally}} antibody producing suspension cells. Gene amplication is typically performed using GS-transfected NS0 cells to select for producing cell lines. The GS-NS0 is a heterologous mammalian expression {{system that allows}} for the rapid expression of recombinant proteins. Several therapeutic antibody products are produced using the NS0 cell line including <b>daclizumab</b> and eculizumab.|$|E
50|$|That works {{particularly}} well on cancer tumors, because tumors naturally absorb more ICG than other tissue. When ICG is injected near tumors, tumors {{react to the}} laser 2.5 {{times as much as}} the surrounding tissue does. It's also possible to target specific cells by conjugating the ICG to antibodies such as <b>daclizumab</b> (Dac), trastuzumab (Tra), or panitumumab (Pan).|$|E
50|$|Monoclonal {{antibodies}} {{used for}} autoimmune diseases include infliximab and adalimumab, which {{are effective in}} rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease and ulcerative Colitis by their ability to bind to and inhibit TNF-α. Basiliximab and <b>daclizumab</b> inhibit IL-2 on activated T cells and thereby help preventing acute rejection of kidney transplants. Omalizumab inhibits human immunoglobulin E (IgE) and is useful in moderate-to-severe allergic asthma.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Daclizumab</b> High-Yield Process (DAC HYP): {{is being}} {{developed}} as a potential once-monthly subcutaneous injection {{in the treatment of}} relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). DAC HYP {{is being developed}} in collaboration with Abbvie, Inc. In June 2014, the companies announced positive top-line results from the Phase III DECIDE clinical trial, where DAC HYP demonstrated superiority over interferon beta-1a in annualized relapse rate.|$|E
5000|$|Their cost {{effectiveness}} as of 2012 is unclear. [...] In May 2016 the FDA approved <b>daclizumab</b> {{for the treatment}} of relapsing multiple sclerosis in adults, with requirements for postmarketing studies and submission of a formal risk evaluation and mitigation strategy. [...] In March 2017 the FDA approved ocrelizumab, a humanized anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, as a treatment for RRMS, with requirements for several Phase IV clinical trials.|$|E
50|$|In the US, <b>daclizumab</b> is {{contraindicated}} {{in people}} with liver impairment, including significantly elevated liver enzymes (ALT, AST) and autoimmune hepatitis. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) originally approved the drug without any contraindications apart from known hypersensitivity, but required Biogen to implement a hepatic risk management guide for physicians. In July 2017, the EMA has issued a provisional contraindication for patients with pre-existing liver disease or liver impairment.|$|E
5000|$|Protein Design Labs {{had been}} founded in 1986 {{and was a}} pioneer in humanizing {{monoclonal}} antibodies. Its humanization technology was used in several monoclonal antibody drugs under licensing and collaboration agreements; such products included rituximab (Rituxan), bevacizumab (Avastin), and palivizumab (Synagis). It held its initial public offering in 1992 and by 1994 it had 13 compounds in its pipeline, and had partnered its lead product, the humanized monoclonal antibody <b>daclizumab,</b> with Roche under a license that called for a 15% royalty. [...] <b>Daclizumab</b> became the first humanized monoclonal antibody approved for human use in 1997. [...] PDL made another public offering in 2000, {{at the peak of}} the biotech IPO window that ran from 1998 to 2001. [...] In 2003 it settled litigation with Genentech over royalty payments owed to PDL under their license agreement; annual royalties were anticipated at that time to be around $90M per year. [...] These are the kinds of intellectual property and license agreements that PDL manages on behalf of its shareholders since 2008; in 2007 those royalty payments were around $220 million.|$|E
