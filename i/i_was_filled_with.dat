2500|$|Hugh Bourne {{was brought}} up in a {{religious}} family and from the age of seven was increasingly troubled by existential and religious questions. He lived with a rather morbid fear of being condemned to Hell and spent, as he phrased it, [...] "twenty sorrowful years" [...] in pursuit of salvation. Naturally, the shy young Bourne read the Bible, but it was only when his mother brought him an anthology of Christian writings in 1799 that the Christian message of salvation really began to resonate. Bourne wrote, [...] "I believed in my heart, grace descended and Jesus Christ manifested himself unto me, my sins were taken away in an instant, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> all joy and peace in believing".|$|E
2500|$|Shore {{was born}} in Toronto, Canada, to Henry and Charlotte Shore. She was the {{youngest}} of seven children. She was drawn to both painting and nature at a young age, remarking [...] "I was on my way home from school and saw myself reflected in a puddle. It was the first time I had seen my image completely surrounded by nature, and I suddenly had an overwhelming sense of belonging to itâ€”of actually being part of every tree and flower. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> a desire to tell what I felt through painting." [...] Shore's mother supported Shore's artistic ambitions, but advised her to learn practical matters as well. After taking a domestic education class, at the age of 15, Shore began studying painting with the Canadian Impressionist Laura Muntz Lyall. Her works at this time are mostly genre scenes and thus conform to subject matter that would have been popular in Toronto's traditional art scene during the period.|$|E

6000|$|When {{the guide}} pointed {{out where the}} Wandering Jew had left his {{familiar}} mark upon a wall, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> astonishment. It read: ...|$|E

60|$|He {{leaned back}} against the logs, and chuckled so complacently at his own conceit that {{it was hard to believe}} this easy-tempered {{creature}} was draining half my neighbors' blood; but <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> a great loathing for him.|$|E
5000|$|Wenn ich in deine Augen seh (Heine no 4). (When I look in {{your eyes}} all my pain and woe fades: when I kiss your mouth I become whole: when I recline on your breast <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> heavenly joy: and when you say, 'I love you', I weep bitterly.) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I can't help {{going to}} see Sibyl play," [...] he cried, [...] "even if it is only for a single act. I get hungry for her presence; and when I think of the {{wonderful}} soul that is hidden away in that little ivory body, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> awe." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Soon <b>I</b> shall <b>be</b> well, {{and then}} these foolish humours {{will cease to}} haunt me. But just now I cannot bear you from my sight. When you <b>are</b> with me <b>I</b> <b>am</b> at peace. <b>I</b> know that all is well. But when you go <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> fears, lying {{helpless}} here." ...|$|R
60|$|When {{they told}} me the tale <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> sympathy. Now I wish that I had soft-soap and tried the {{experiment}} on some lonely little beast far away in the woods. It sounds so probable and so human.|$|E
60|$|I {{confess that}} <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> curiosity, but I {{was aware that}} Holmes liked to make his {{disclosures}} at his own time and in his own way, so I waited until it should suit him to take me into his confidence.|$|E
60|$|At {{this revelation}} <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> wonder and fear. There was no {{constitution}} could bear so violent a strain--his least of all, that was unhinged already; and I decided {{in my mind}} that we must bring this monstrous situation to an end.|$|E
6000|$|... "I've no {{objection}} to that," [...] replied Glynn, [...] "but don't excite yourself. But tell me, Ailie, how was it that you managed to keep afloat so long?

60|$|As a final {{instance}} of the force of limitations {{in the development of}} concentration, I must mention that beautiful creature, Helen Keller, whom I have known for these many years. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> the wonder of her knowledge, acquired because shut out from all distraction. If <b>I</b> could have <b>been</b> deaf, dumb, and blind I also might have arrived at something.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh yes, {{that is what}} {{prevented}} me {{from feeling}} sleepy. I think I should have no other mortal wants, if I could always have plenty of music. It seems to infuse strength into my limbs, and ideas into my brain. Life seems to go on without effort, when <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> music. At other times one is conscious of carrying a weight." ...|$|R
60|$|For my part, I had one {{of those}} dreamy periods of {{existence}} in which people doubt whether they are awake or asleep.

60|$|I felt {{proud to}} know that the liberties of Massachusetts and of our {{fatherland}} were in such safe keeping; and as I turned to my hoeing again <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> an inexpressible confidence, and pursued my labor cheerfully with a calm trust in the future.|$|E
60|$|Suddenly <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> {{the thought}} of her and a great longing for her. What would she do when she {{realised}} our immense disaster? What would she do? How would she take it? It filled me with astonishment to realise how little I could tell....|$|E
50|$|Like the Roman: The Life of Enoch Powell is a 1998 book by the English writer Simon Heffer. It is a {{biography}} of the politician Enoch Powell. The title is taken from Powell's 1968 Rivers of Blood speech when Powell quoted Virgil's Aeneid: As I look ahead, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> foreboding; like the Roman, I seem to see the River Tiber foaming with much blood.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is {{surprising}} how bloodthirsty one feels in a bayonet charge. We have to shout; we {{are encouraged to}} shout. The effect is to paralyse one's higher centres. One ceases to question--anything. One becomes a 'bayoneteer.' As I go bounding forward I imagine fat men, succulent men ahead, and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> the desire to do them in neatly. This sort of thing--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{had a great}} {{object to}} serve, Maximilien," [...] he concluded, [...] "and my only regret is {{that it should have}} run counter to your wishes. I owe you so much--everything in fact--that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> shame at the thought of how ill a return <b>I</b> <b>am</b> making you.

6000|$|I must {{add that}} when I heard these words <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> the most {{unbounded}} admiration for Bastin's fearless courage which enabled him thus to beard this super-tyrant in his den.

6000|$|But my {{thoughts}} maddened me. Over {{and over again}} I repeated every word of the terrible quarrel, and more than ever <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> horror for her cold cruelty. What right have these people to make us unhappy? Is there not enough misery in the world already? Oh, it is brutal! ...|$|E
6000|$|Thus I spoke, {{not knowing}} what else to say, for <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> a great joy, a calm and ineffable satisfaction, which broke thus feebly from my heart.

5000|$|He {{also made}} a {{statement}} to a Belgrade daily commenting on NATO's involvement in the Kosovo War in 1999. [...] "Genocide against Serbs took place in Kosovo, and it was instigated by the West. For this reason, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> sadness, bitterness and disappointment as <b>I</b> <b>was</b> part of the NATO machinery. I also witnessed how drug lords became respectable officials of the so-called state of Kosovo, and how mass murderers became heroes".|$|R

60|$|Being {{recommended}} to an honest planter, I {{lived with him}} till such time as I was informed of the manner of their planting and making sugar; and seeing how well they lived, and how suddenly they grew rich, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> a desire to settle among them, and resolved to get my money remitted to me, and to purchase a plantation.|$|E
60|$|Well, as {{a matter}} of fact, I did give her a sort of salutation.

60|$|Next I rose stiffly upright, ensanguined, {{with wild}} gasps of thankfulness, {{and sent a}} hoarse cry ringing across the woods, after which I {{sat down on the}} fur and stabbed the lifeless brute twice again, for <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> a childish fear that even now it might escape me.
