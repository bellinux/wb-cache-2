40|$|AbstractDrawing {{lessons from}} the constructions of {{domestic}} and foreign urban rail transit network operation coordination platform, the paper puts forward the structure of network command center information platform with the full life cycle management idea and the open architecture. Besides, it designs the main platform functions and explores key technologies such as the information fusion mechanism, real-time monitoring with GIS technology, <b>equipment</b> <b>alarm</b> monitoring and intelligent emergency decision. The network command center integrated information platform which has important functions in the operation coordination, resource sharing, and emergency decision is the main technical support system of urban rail transit network operation and management. It can grasp the real-time operation situation of each rail transit line, use for the daily operation supervision,and especially unify coordination control during emergencies to implement emergency linkage by organizing relevant departments and assembling the rescue resources. The running effect of the network command center information platform suggests that the system can effectively improve the urban rail major accident or emergency rapid response capability and scientific decision so as {{to ensure the safety}} of urban transportation...|$|E

Stealing is considered a forbidden act in any value system, {{so much that it}} became a main element when it comes to forbidden acts in any international value system, or in the values agreed upon by religious or philosophical trends. Stealing is forbidden in all religions. This book focuses on the topic of protecting persons and property from robbery. In the beginning, the author talks about security and crime, as he clarifies the types of criminal acts committed against different persons and properties, and the motives of those acts. He also displays the dangers arising from those crimes, and the security principals concerning this matter. The author then moves to talk about property protecting, and that of auto-sensing, as he displays the heavy equipment used in protection, lamination and strengthen elements, locks and doors, primary principals for sensing <b>equipment,</b> <b>alarm</b> control panel and its parts, and sensing devices.

40|$|LectureThis paper {{reports the}} {{experiences}} acquired through the modifications and improvements {{implemented in the}} manufacture, construction and assembly of the oil flow centrifugal pumps. A Brazilian oil pipeline pumping capacity expansion, on Rio Grande do Sul ? South Region of Brazil, was conceived aiming at refinery processing increase project from 20, 000 m?/day to 30, 000 m?/day, besides changing the product profile from processed product to national high viscosity national oils. Due to this reason, a new pump park and a new intermediate pump station have been erected. Thus, the oil received by a tanker and stored at the first pump park should be sending through a 97 km long and 560 mm diameter oil pipeline. In order to get such oil flow done, 03 new main pumps have been installed at the first pump park, one of them being a stand-by one, and other 03 pumps at second pump park, one of them being also a standby. During the startup of news pumps, high vibration levels were observed in the rotors and in the equipment structures. The values defined by the manufacturer for <b>equipment</b> <b>alarm</b> and shutdown were, respectively, 50. 0 ?m and 75. 0 ?m, measured on the pump rotors in the bearing region. However, the global vibration levels of the pumps reached 110. 0 ?m during the startup attended by the manufacturers. The equipment warranty period started after that, and a detailed activity planning was drawn up {{with the purpose of}} keeping the new pumps running at the lowest possible operational risk and avoiding a production reduction at Refinery. Simultaneously, various actions were taken in order to identify the vibration sources and reduce its intensity to the lowest possible values. After equipment modifications, median vibration values at 15. 0 ?m were obtained. The logistics adopted in this process and the activities carried out to eliminate the causes of the high pump vibrations prevented an approximately U$ 25 million loss for the Customer and ensured an expressive increase in the equipment operational continuity reliability...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the learnability and distinguishability of two sets of melodic medical <b>equipment</b> <b>alarms.</b> One set was developed for the IEC 60101 - 1 - 8 international standard and has little differentiation between sounds, whereas the other was developed by Patterson and Edworthy in 1986 and has marked differentiation between sounds. Participants were 31 nurses with less than one year of formal music training. They were randomly assigned to learn either the IEC or Patterson-Edworthy set of alarm sounds and then tested on their ability to identify the alarms while completing a distracting task. Participants completed two testing sessions with distractor tasks of varying difficulty. Results suggest that the Patterson-Edworthy alarms are easier for nurses to learn and identify, irrespective of the level of distraction experienced. It is concluded that the Patterson-Edworthy alarms may represent a suitable alternative to replace the IEC alarms in the impending revision of the standard, but that further testing is first required...|$|R

40|$|International audienceIntensive Care Units (ICUs) can be {{extremely}} noisy places, with staff conversation and <b>equipment</b> <b>alarms</b> are often cited as extremely disturbing. These noises are frequently implicated in causing sleep disruption and may have deleterious effects on patient recovery and staff wellbeing alike. This study aims to assess the acoustical environment in the General Intensive Care Unit at St. Georges Hospital in London, and produce a longitudinal noise map. The study exploits novel noise measurement instrumentation utilising MEMS microphones, which makes a distributed noise system economically viable. This presents the first ever opportunity to produce detailed noise maps based on measurement in a hospital ward environment. The noise map will identify the areas within the ICU that are systematically noisier than surrounding areas, and provide details about temporal variations which can be correlated to specific activities {{as well as any}} systematic link with time of the day or week. As a first step, characterising the performance of the instrumentation, especially the measurement microphone at its installed location, is essential for assuring the accuracy of gathered data.

40|$|The {{hospital}} sound {{environment is}} complex. Emergency Departments (EDs), in particular, {{have proven to}} be hectic work environments populated with diverse sound sources. Medical <b>equipment,</b> <b>alarms,</b> and communication events generate noise that can interfere with staff concentration and communication. In this study, sound measurements and analyses were conducted in six hospitals total: three civilian hospitals in Atlanta, Georgia and Dublin, Ohio, as well as three Washington, DC-area hospitals in the Military Health System (MHS). The equivalent, minimum, and maximum sound pressure levels were recorded over twenty-four hours in several locations in each ED, with shorter 15 - 30 minute measurements performed in other areas. Acoustic descriptors, such as spectral content, level distributions, and speech intelligibility were examined. The perception of these acoustic qualities by hospital staff was also evaluated through subjective surveys. It was found that noise levels in both work areas and patient rooms were excessive. Additionally, speech intelligibility measurements and survey results show that background noise presents a significant obstacle in effective communication between staff members and patients. Compared to previous studies, this study looks at a wider range of acoustic metrics and the corresponding perceptions of staff in order to form a more precise and accurate depiction of the ED sound environment.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{focuses on}} developing inspection schedules to detect non-self- announcing events {{which can only}} detected by inspections. Failures of protective sys- tems,such as electronic <b>equipments,</b> <b>alarms</b> and stand-by systems, incipient failures {{and the emergence of}} certain medical diseases are examples of such events. Inspec- tions are performed at pre-determined times to detect whether or not the event has occurred, and necessary actions are taken upon the detection. In this research, my interest is in developing effective inspection schedules to detect non-self-announcing events that balance system downtime and inspection effort. To evaluate the quality of an inspection schedule, I use the availability (for re- placeable) and the detection delay (for non-replaceable systems) as performance mea- sures. When the monetary cost of inspection and the cost of delay are difficult to determine, non-monetary performance measures become more meaningful. In this research, the focus is on maximizing availability or minimizing detection delay given a limited number of inspections or a limited inspection rate. I show that for replace- able and non-replaceable systems, it is possible to construct inspection schedules that perform better than periodic inspection with respect to our performance measures. The occurrence of the event I would like to detect may be influenced by certain individual characteristics. For instance, the risk of developing a certain type of dis- ease might be different for different subgroups within the population. In this case, because of the non-homogeneity in the population, benefits of performing screening tests may not be fully achieved for each sub-group by using an inspection strategy developed for the entire population. Thus, it may be of value for an individual to learn more information about his/her likehood to have the disease. To address this issue, I analyze the change in the expected delay if schedules are based on the whole population information or the individual information and provide numerical results...|$|R
