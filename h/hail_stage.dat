60|$|Like all {{daughters of}} a free country, Isabel knew nothing about politics, and {{she felt that she}} was getting into deep water; she {{answered}} buoyantly, but she was glad to make her weariness the occasion of <b>hailing</b> a <b>stage,</b> and changing the conversation. The farther down town they went the busier the street grew; and about the Astor House, where they alighted, there was already a bustle that nothing but a fire could have created at the same hour in Boston. A little farther on the steeple of Trinity rose high into the scorching sunlight, while below, in the shadow that was darker than it was cool, slumbered the old graves among their flowers.|$|R
5000|$|In September 1980 Maddalena {{portrayed the}} title role in a {{controversial}} production of Mozart's Don Giovanni at the Palace Theatre in Manchester, New Hampshire with the New Hampshire Symphony Orchestra for the Monadnock Music Festival (MMF). The production used a modernized staging which was conceived by director Peter Sellars, just 23 {{years old at the}} time. It was the first professional opera directed by Sellars. While Opera News dubbed the production as [...] "an act of artistic vandalism", The New York Times was more positive in its review, with critic Peter G. Davis <b>hailing</b> the <b>staging</b> as [...] "remarkably stimulating and provocative" [...] and stating that [...] "Maddalena was an appropriately loathsome Don, and he sang the part with a fine, firmly modulated baritone." ...|$|R

The production {{was met with}} praise with The Guardian saying it is [...] "exquisitely realized," [...] The <b>Stage</b> <b>hailing</b> it as [...] "creative brilliance," [...] and The Times describing it [...] "astonishing". She has also staged Benjamin Britten's The Turn of the Screw in Suffolk and London for Aldeburgh Music.|$|R
50|$|Maughan {{appeared}} {{in at least}} 7 plays in her first year back in Australia, most of them lead roles, and throughout the late sixties was <b>hailed</b> for her <b>stage</b> performances, such at the title role in The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie (1968), directed by MTC founder, John Sumner (theatre director) (1924-2013). In 1971, she won the Melbourne Theatre Award for Best Actress for her portrayal of pregnant spinster Anna Bowers in Donald Howarth's Three Months Gone. Coincidentally, Maughan was three months pregnant {{at the end of}} the play's run.|$|R
5000|$|The First Look of Mom was {{unveiled}} at the Zee Cine Awards 2017 by Salman Khan who <b>hailed</b> Sridevi on <b>stage</b> as [...] "a bigger star than the Khans". The actress made the First Look public on Twitter which went viral. Subsequently, the Teaser of Mom acquired 1.2 million views on YouTube {{on the first}} day itself. It also met with a positive response in Pakistan. The well-receival of the teaser led to distributors in South India asking for dubbed version of the film pre-emptively. The filmmakers announced that Mom would also be dubbed and released in Tamil, Telugu and Malayalam.|$|R
5000|$|Royal & Derngate is a theatre complex {{which is}} formed of the Royal Theatre, a 583-seat {{producing}} house, and the Derngate Theatre, a 1,200-set multi-purpose performance space. The Royal opened in 1884, followed 99 years {{later by the}} Derngate in 1983, which {{was built on the}} site of Northampton's former Derngate bus station. The two theatres merged as one organisation in 1999, closed in 2005 to undergo an 18-month £14.5m redevelopment, and re-opened as Royal & Derngate in 2006.

40|$|Hail has damaged {{soybeans}} in Iowa rather {{frequently in}} recent years. Although no {{figures are available}} on the extent of these losses to soybeans alone, the annual estimated losses from hail damage to all crops in Iowa from 1936 to 1946 may show their probable significance. These losses, shown in table 1, were compiled from township assessors 2 ̆ 7 reports. Crop losses due to hail damage apparently were considerably above average from 1942 to 1946. During this same period soybean acreage and 2 ̆ 7 production reached an all-time peak in Iowa (table 2). The expanded acreage and production of. soybeans together with the increased incidence of hail has resulted in a large increase in the hail insurance written on this crop. Little was known regarding the evaluation of hail losses to soybeans when these experiments were initiated. Neither farmers nor hail adjustors knew the recovery to expect after soybean crops were damaged by <b>hail</b> at different <b>stages</b> of plant development. To provide this information was the principal objective of the investigations reported in this bulletin...|$|R
40|$|In the mirror, I {{face the}} mirror woman: outcast, exile, immigrant. Standing {{at a point}} of truth, knowing {{that there is no}} truth, only illusions and more illusions, that all thought is implanted, that every society carries within itself a form of oppression, that living itself is tenuous, that in the end is only silence and {{something}} other. l Lau Siew Mei 2 ̆ 7 s portrayal of her character 2 ̆ 7 s confusion {{in front of the mirror}} provides a shadowy parallel to the kind of mirror <b>stage</b> <b>hailing</b> from psychoanalysis. But her sense of alienation, like that of other Chinese Australians, is compounded by a dilemma which is at the same time simpler and more urgent: a response to the 2 ̆ 7 mirror 2 ̆ 7 image held up to her by the mainstream culture (2 ̆ 7 outcast, exile, immigrant 2 ̆ 7), a sense of estrangement from both the ethnically marked face in the mirror and the culturally marked imagination which greets it.

5000|$|The Royal {{was built}} by theatre {{architect}} Charles J. Phipps and opened in 1884. Ninety-nine years later in 1983, the Derngate, designed by RHWL, was built {{to the rear of}} the Royal. Whilst the two theatres were physically linked, they only formally merged as one combined organisation in 1999, run by the Northampton Theatres Trust. In 2005, both theatres closed for an 18-month £14.5m redevelopment, which saw the merging of both venues into one construction, the building of a creativity centre, and the total refurbishment of the two venues. The complex reopened as Royal & Derngate in October 2006. From its reopening, Laurie Sansom was Artistic Director; under his tenure, The <b>Stage</b> <b>hailed</b> Royal & Derngate as The Regional Theatre of the Year (2010) in its inaugural Stage 100 Awards for [...] "its artistic quality and connections it has with local audiences." [...] James Dacre took over as Artistic Director in 2013. The theare was awarded the UK Theatre Management Award for Best Presentation of Touring Theatre for its Made in Northampton co-produced work in 2015 and the UK Theatre Award for Best Touring Production in 2016. It was shortlisted for the Regional Theatre of the Year Award again in 2016.|$|R
2500|$|In {{support of}} Anthems, Ellis and May {{embarked}} {{on her first}} headlining concert tour of Great Britain, titled [...] The tour commenced at the Royal Albert Hall on 1 May 2011 for two special charity performances (benefiting Leukaemia & Lymphoma Research), titled Anthems: The Concert, where Ellis {{was supported by the}} City of London Philharmonic, The West End Chorus, performer Adam Pascal and electronic string quartet Escala. Her performances at the Royal Albert Hall both sold out and later garnered her the 2012 Whatsonstage.com Theatregoers' Choice Award for Best Solo Performance and a nomination for the 2011 BroadwayWorld.com UK Award for Theatrical Event of the Year (she lost to 25th anniversary celebrations of The Phantom of the Opera). After attending Anthems: The Concert, critic Mark Shenton of The <b>Stage</b> <b>hailed</b> Ellis, a [...] "small but fierce and fiery performer," [...] as [...] "this generation's Elaine Paige, with a similarly soaring, scorching voice." [...] He also made reference to her cult following built from her Wicked days, labelling her [...] "our local green goddess of song." [...] Despite professing he prefers other contemporary musical theatre actresses, [...] "I can't deny the power and following she clearly has." [...] Anthems: The Tour continued at venues throughout Great Britain and finished at RAF Cranwell in July 2011 where the pair headlined a special titled Anthems in the Park. The tour was met with mostly positive reviews with critics praising the meshing of May's sound with Ellis' voice.|$|R
5000|$|The opera {{received}} a mixed reception from critics. Guy Dammann wrote in The Times Literary Supplement that the opera [...] "represents a remarkable achievement for Wigglesworth. Perhaps its most striking {{feature is the}} complete self-assurance of its restraint." [...] Rupert Christiansen, in the Daily Telegraph, found that the composer, using an idiom which was [...] "a sugar-coated mélange of Berg and Tippett" [...] had [...] "reduced the play’s ambiguities and resonances to something charmless, turgid and unmoving." [...] In The Observer, on the other hand, Fiona Maddocks called the score [...] "fluid and sensuous, building on the tradition of Britten and Tippett but with plenty of individuality." [...] George Hall, in The <b>Stage,</b> <b>hailed</b> it as [...] "the major event of ENO’s current season", rated Kinnear's production highly, found the score [...] "accomplished" [...] and praised the individual performances, whilst noting that overall [...] "the play has once again eluded the operatic medium." [...] Cara Chanteau in The Independent gave the production four stars out of five, found Sophie Bevan [...] "radiant" [...] as Hermione, but conceded that Wigglesworth's score was [...] "just a tad too respectful to blaze as incandescently as it might." [...] William Hartson in the Express claimed [...] "I cannot remember enjoying a new opera so much" [...] whilst extolling how the music [...] "emphasizes the action in an impressive and remarkable way, particularly considering they {{fact that this is}} the young British composer's first opera." ...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} examines {{student performance}} of kamishibai. Originally a Japanese street-performance art, kamishibai involves orally telling a narrative while manipulating illustrated cards inside a <b>stage.</b> <b>Hailed</b> as a precursor of manga cartoons and animé films, kamishibai has been receiving attention in Japan and internationally for its uses within educational settings. This dissertation poses the question: What opportunities for multimodal instruction and curriculum development does kamishibai offer in the 21 st century classroom and how might these advance {{our understanding of}} current theories of multimodality? Research was conducted over two four-month periods and involved creation, critique, and performance of kamishibai stories with 3 rd graders in two public school districts in Central New Jersey. In each site, participant observation was carried on for the first month and throughout the project. In {{the second and third}} months, the researcher led students through the creation of their stories, during which time she videotaped evolving performances and critiquing sessions. Finally, she videotaped performances for parents and peers and interviewed students and teachers to hear their reflections on the process. Drawing upon methods of microanalysis, the researcher chose case studies to analyze specific student performances and how they evolved over time. The significance of kamishibai lies in its particular synaesthetic ensemble of kineikonic modes, combined with oral language and framed as live performance, and this framing gives rise to certain affordances that challenge many commonly held assumptions about the reach of modes in American classroom ecologies, where the written mode is most valued. The kamishibai project loosened the ideological ligatures around modes in both liberating and destabilizing ways that upended existing classroom hierarchies, while exposing instances of blockages and fluidity of modal transfer, leading to the conclusion that transference of knowledge from one mode to another cannot be assumed. Further research needs to address the complexity of these synaesthetic processes if we are to achieve a 2 ̆ 2 resource 2 ̆ 2 model of multimodality where all available modes may be drawn upon equally as resources in student learning. ...|$|R
