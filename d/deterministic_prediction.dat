40|$|This article {{presents}} the computation {{of a set}} of control parameters for the <b>deterministic</b> <b>prediction</b> of laminar boundary-layer instabilities induced by an imposed unsteady shock interaction. The objective of the study is exploratory in nature by computing a supersonic flight environment for flow over a blunt body and the <b>deterministic</b> <b>prediction</b> of the spectral entropy rates for the boundary layer subjected to an unsteady pressure disturbance. The deterministic values for the spectral entropy rate within the instabilities are determined for each control parameter. Computational results imply that the instabilities are of a span-wise vortex form, that the maximum vertical velocity wave vector components are produced in the region nearest the wall and that extended transient coherent structures are produced in the boundary layer at a vertical location slightly below the mid-point of the boundary layer...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{techniques}} are developed {{for assessing the}} magnitude and importance of the prediction bias in deterministic predictions from an estimated nonlinear model. Since this bias results from the nonlinearity of the system, indirect measures are proposed which indicate the extent of nonlinearity {{with respect to the}} disturbances in the system. These measures are based on the proportion of the generalized variance of the endogenous variables explained by a linear relationship with the disturbances. Direct estimates of the <b>deterministic</b> <b>prediction</b> bias are obtained as the difference between the deterministic and the stochastic predictors. As a measure of the practical importance of the <b>deterministic</b> <b>prediction</b> bias, the estimates of the bias are compared with the variance of the endogenous variables in a quadratic form. Formal tests of the statistical significance of the estimated <b>deterministic</b> <b>prediction</b> bias are developed for specific and general values of the exogenous variables. The test statistics utilized here differ from the direct measures in that the quadratic forms are now based on the covariance matrix of the estimated biases rather than the covariance matrix of the endogenous variables. A particular specialization of these tests leads to correction of the common practice of regressing sample period forecast errors on observable variables for model diagnostics. Finally, the procedures developed are illustrated through application to a log-linear regression model...|$|E

40|$|Thermal cycling {{durability}} of Plastic {{ball grid array}} (PBGA) interconnects is known to decrease as I/O count increases. This is due, in part, to mechanistic effects; such as increasing thermal expansion mismatches between component and PWB, due to increasing package sizes. Failure prediction due to these mechanistic effects is a deterministic process {{and is based on}} the load level found in the critical joint (joint with the most severe loading). However, due to probabilistic effects, for example manufacturing variabilities, premature failure may result in one of several joints in the neighborhood of the critical one. Failure probability increases as the number of joints in this critical region increases. Thus, observed failure rates are due to a convolution of deterministic and probabilistic effects. In effect, for large BGAs, <b>deterministic</b> <b>predictions</b> may overestimate interconnect durability.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a study of the prediction of the entropy growth within an internal free shear layer of an ideal gas flow downstream of a sudden expansion of the flow area. The objective of the study is exploratory in nature by invoking concepts from information theory to connect the <b>deterministic</b> <b>prediction</b> of the spectral entropy growth within the shear layer to the experimentally inferred increase in entropy across the flow region. The <b>deterministic</b> <b>prediction</b> of the spectral entropy increase along the shear layer is brought into agreement with the experimentally inferred increase in entropy through the ad hoc inclusion of the activation spectral entropy. The values for this activation spectral entropy are directly related to the area ratios across the expansion region and have a specific numerical value for each area ratio...|$|E
40|$|The Wave Based Method (WBM) is a <b>deterministic</b> <b>prediction</b> method. Due to its {{enhanced}} computational efficiency {{as compared}} to other <b>deterministic</b> <b>prediction</b> techniques for steady-state dynamic analysis such as the Finite Element Method (FEM), the WBM is applicable for problem analysis in the low- and midfrequency range. It has been shown already that the WBM is superior to the FEM for the prediction of dynamic displacement fields. This paper discusses application of the WBM for the computation of structural intensity and power flow in Kirchhoff plates. Such calculations require higher- order derivatives of the displacement fields which even further narrows the low-frequency application range of conventional element based methods such as the FEM because of the low-order polynomial field approximations. The WBM adopts wave-like functions instead of low-order polynomials and, as such, is expected to yield faster and more accurate intensity predictions. ...|$|E
