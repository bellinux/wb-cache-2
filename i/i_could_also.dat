2500|$|Although Emerson did not own {{a record}} player, he enjoyed {{listening}} to music on the radio, particularly Floyd Cramer's 1961 slip note-style [...] "On the Rebound" [...] {{and the work of}} Dudley Moore. He used jazz sheet music from Dave Brubeck and George Shearing and learned about jazz piano from books. He also listened to boogie-woogie, and to country-style pianists including Joe [...] "Mr Piano" [...] Henderson, Russ Conway and Winifred Atwell. Emerson later described himself: [...] "I was a very serious child. I used to walk around with Beethoven sonatas under my arm. However, I was very good at avoiding being beaten up by the bullies. That was because <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>also</b> play Jerry Lee Lewis and Little Richard songs. So, they thought I was kind of cool and left me alone." ...|$|E
2500|$|Kant {{thinks that}} all of our actions, whether {{motivated}} by inclination or morality, must follow some law. For example, if a person wants to qualify for nationals in ultimate frisbee, he will have to follow a law that tells him to practice his backhand pass, among other things. Notice, however, that this law is only binding on the person who wants to qualify for nationals in ultimate frisbee. In this way, it is contingent upon the ends that he sets and the circumstances that he is in. We know from the third proposition, however, that the moral law must bind universally and necessarily, that is, regardless of ends and circumstances. [...] At this point, Kant asks, ‘what kind of law can that be, the representation of which must determine the will, even without regard for the effect expected from it...?’ (4:402) He concludes that the only remaining alternative is a law that reflects only the form of law itself, namely that of universality. [...] Thus, Kant arrives at his well-known categorical imperative, the moral law referenced in the above discussion of duty. Kant defines the categorical imperative as the following: “I ought never to act except {{in such a way that}} <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>also</b> will that my maxim should become a universal law.” (4:402) ...|$|E
60|$|Fortunately I {{could answer}} this {{question}} in the affirmative; having studied French under a Frenchman, I could speak the language intelligibly though not fluently. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>also</b> read it well, and write it decently.|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{turned to}} look, and there I saw Wabisca gazing on {{me with a}} look of blank amazement. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> see, <b>also,</b> that several of the other women, and some of my companions, shared in her surprise.|$|R
60|$|As {{he spoke}} {{the young lady}} stood silently gazing at me. There was a remnant of a smile upon her face, but <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>also</b> {{see that she was}} a little annoyed. I was about to make some sort of an {{independent}} answer to the gentleman's remarks, but he anticipated me.|$|E
60|$|My time is {{once more}} expired. I will write to Mr. Cleghorn soon. God bless him {{and all his}} concerns! And may all the powers that preside over conviviality and friendship, be present with all their kindest influence, when the bearer of this, Mr. Syme, and you meet! I wish <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>also</b> make one.|$|E
6000|$|She {{looked at}} me earnestly, and, {{although}} there was a certain solicitude in her gaze, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>also</b> see there signs of great relief. [...] "But isn't there some other way of getting that bear to the hotel?" [...] she said. [...] "It will be dreadful for you to have to walk there and lead him." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>could</b> here <b>also</b> {{bring in}} the {{testimony}} of the very devils themselves as Luke 4:41, 8:28 where he is by them acknowledged to be the Son of the living God: But it is needless so to do; for we have plainly proved it already.|$|R
60|$|Now {{all this}} {{pleasure}} {{we were to}} forego, and when we thought thereon, Jack and I felt very much depressed in our spirits. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> see, <b>also,</b> that Peterkin grieved and sympathised with us; for, when talking about this matter, he refrained from jesting and bantering us upon it.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Being thus {{bound up}} like an Egyptian mummy' (Carver unconsciously making my point), 'the seer was lifted into the chest-like enclosure. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> now <b>also</b> discern him as plain as I had ever done, and I took {{care not to}} turn my eyes away a moment'--in which effort he {{probably}} failed.|$|R
60|$|I {{felt some}} {{hesitation}} in suggesting rank {{as high as}} the colonelcy of a regiment, feeling somewhat doubtful whether I would be equal to the position. But I had seen nearly every colonel who had been mustered in from the State of Illinois, and some from Indiana, and felt that if they could command a regiment properly, and with credit, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>also.</b>|$|E
60|$|And {{there is}} one on your right, though more repainted--the little Virgin {{presenting}} herself at the Temple,--about which <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>also</b> say much. The stooping figure, kissing {{the hem of her}} robe without her knowing, is, as far as I remember, first in this fresco; the origin, itself, of the main design in all the others you know so well; (and with its steps, by the way, in better perspective already than most of them).|$|E
60|$|There {{was a few}} moments' silence, {{and then}} a hum of subdued voices as a man rose up; while I could {{scarcely}} believe my eyes when I saw it was Boone. In spite of the slight change in his appearance, {{he must have been}} aware that he was running a serious risk, for his former holding lay almost within a day's journey. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>also</b> see that some of the spectators started as they recognized him.|$|E
5000|$|Notice {{that the}} {{sentence}} <b>I</b> wash myself <b>could</b> <b>also</b> be translated in Italian as [...] "io lavo me stesso", that stresses the reflexiveness {{way more than}} English.|$|R
6000|$|I {{had tried}} to collect all the beauty <b>I</b> <b>could,</b> and <b>also</b> all the youth, so {{that for a moment}} I was at a loss.

2500|$|In a {{classification}} {{of the oral}} lesions in HIV disease, OHL is grouped as [...] "lesions strongly associated with HIV infection" [...] (group <b>I).</b> It <b>could</b> <b>also</b> be classed as an opportunistic, viral disease. Hairy leukoplakia occurs on the tongue and has a similar name to hairy tongue, but these are separate conditions with different causes.|$|R
6000|$|... "For several reasons; I don't mind {{mentioning}} a few. I {{want more}} {{say in the}} running of this Company, and I could get at useful facts my colleagues didn't know through its secretary. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>also</b> give him instructions without the authority of a board meeting, see? And I fancy I could put a spoke in Savine's wheel best by doing it quietly my own way. One live man can often get through more than a squabbling dozen, and the money is really nothing much to me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We both {{gained the}} {{opposite}} bank--I {{a few yards}} in advance. You may be sure I was not slow in bounding up the bank. I could hear the howl of rage with which the villains saw the failure of their plan. What is more, I could both hear and see the arrows that were sent after me, but, through God's blessing, none of them touched me, and I was soon in {{the shelter of the}} woods. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>also</b> hear my friend panting at my heels.|$|E
60|$|The {{perpetual}} {{suggestion of}} a smile under Dominic's piratical moustaches seemed to become more accentuated--quite real, grim, actually almost visible through the wet and uncurled hair. Judging by that symptom, {{he must have been}} in a towering rage. But <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>also</b> see that he was puzzled, and that discovery affected me disagreeably. Dominic puzzled! For a long time, leaning against the bulwark, I gazed over the stern at the gray column that seemed to stand swaying slightly in our wake always at the same distance.|$|E
50|$|He had a gay, lively, {{bubbling}} spirit: he {{was ready}} for every prank: he survives in my memory as a natural actor; and <b>I</b> think he <b>could</b> <b>also,</b> on occasion, produce a merry poem.|$|R
5000|$|The gesture is {{possibly}} ancient in origin. In the biblical book of Job, {{there is a}} reference to it: Job 16: 4 <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>could</b> talk as you do, were you in my place. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> declaim over you, or wag my head at you; 5 <b>I</b> <b>could</b> strengthen you with talk, or shake my head with silent lips.|$|R
40|$|On August 19, 2003 the Eighth Circuit U. S.

SD Farm Bureau v Hazeltine, 340 F 3 d 583 (8 CA 2003). Because much of Amendment E’s language is identical with Nebraska’s corporate farming constitutional amendment (Initiative 300), the decision implies that <b>I</b> 300 <b>could</b> <b>also</b> be unconstitutional...|$|R
60|$|When {{we reached}} Barton-on-the-Sea, Jane and I, {{on our way}} from Woodbury, Aunt Emma {{was waiting at the}} station to meet us. To my great disappointment, I could see at first sight she didn't care for Jane: and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>also</b> see at first sight Jane didn't care for her. This was a serious blow to me, for I leaned upon those two more than I leaned upon anyone; and I had far too few friends in the world of my own, to afford to do without any one of them.|$|E
60|$|I do {{not think}} it reached them more than two-thirds as strong as it went out ten minutes before. The lines which were now {{advancing}} to the attack, opened and swallowed them up, and my force returned, having only suffered a loss of about five hundred men -- not much, I thought, considering the fierceness of the struggle. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>also</b> see that the opposing bodies of cavalry on our left wing were drawing back, but how the fight went with them I do not quite know. It is as much as I can do to describe what took place immediately around me.|$|E
6000|$|... "I can add no more, {{while this}} {{important}} question still remains involved in doubt; neither can I suggest any means of solving that doubt.

5000|$|The {{original}} version of [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>Could</b> Change" [...] <b>also</b> produced by DJ Daryl was {{heard in the}} film, I'm Bout It (which came out shortly after this album), and was also released as a single and a music video to promote the film's soundtrack and this album.|$|R
60|$|He had not {{calculated}} upon Castelroux, {{nor that}} the King should already {{have heard of}} my detention.

6000|$|... "For my part," [...] {{continued}} Mister Woodchuck, [...] "I'm very soft-hearted, and wouldn't even step on an ant if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> help it. <b>Also</b> <b>I</b> am {{sure you}} have a kind disposition.

6000|$|... "Well, {{at least}} I {{knew that if}} Brunton could do it, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>also.</b> Besides, {{there was no real}} difficulty. I went with Musgrave to his study and whittled myself this peg, to which I tied this long string with a knot at each yard. Then I took two lengths of a fishing-rod, which came to just six feet, and I went back with my client to where the elm had been. The sun was just grazing the top of the oak. I {{fastened}} the rod on end, marked out the direction of the shadow, and measured it. It was nine feet in length.|$|E
60|$|I {{remember}} that one day being a little more serious than ordinary, and finding I had so good a stock beforehand as I had, for I had near #200 in money for my share, it came strongly into my mind, no doubt from some kind spirit, if such there be, that at first poverty excited me, and my distresses drove me to these dreadful shifts; so seeing those distresses were now relieved, and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>also</b> get something towards a maintenance by working, and had so good a bank to support me, why should I now not leave off, as they say, while I was well? that I could not expect to go always free; and if I was once surprised, and miscarried, I was undone.|$|E
6000|$|... "I hope I am!" [...] said Miss Fane, {{in rather}} a serious tone. [...] "I wish <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>also</b> he mistaken in my suspicions of the mode in which Albert spends his time. He is sadly changed. For {{the first month}} that we were here he seemed to prefer {{nothing in the world}} to our society, and now--I was nearly saying that we had not seen him for one single evening these three weeks. I cannot {{understand}} what you find at this house of such absorbing interest. Although I know you think I am much mistaken in my suspicions, still I feel very anxious. I spoke to Albert to-day; but he scarcely answered me; or said that which it was a pleasure for me to forget." ...|$|E
60|$|Drs. Grant and Coldstream {{attended}} much to marine Zoology, and I {{often accompanied}} the former to collect {{animals in the}} tidal pools, which I dissected as well as <b>I</b> <b>could.</b> <b>I</b> <b>also</b> became friends {{with some of the}} Newhaven fishermen, and sometimes accompanied them when they trawled for oysters, and thus got many specimens. But from not having had any regular practice in dissection, and from possessing only a wretched microscope, my attempts were very poor. Nevertheless I made one interesting little discovery, and read, about {{the beginning of the year}} 1826, a short paper on the subject before the Plinian Society. This was that the so-called ova of Flustra had the power of independent movement by means of cilia, and were in fact larvae. In another short paper I showed that the little globular bodies which had been supposed to be the young state of Fucus loreus were the egg-cases of the wormlike Pontobdella muricata.|$|R
6000|$|A {{stronger}} feeling than compassion {{moved the}} heart of Tisbina at these words. [...] "This indeed," [...] replied she, [...] "I feel to be noble; and truly <b>could</b> <b>I</b> <b>also</b> now die to save you. But life is flitting; and how may I prove my regard?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Summer is {{best time}} to visit this place. As water level goes down, pot holes are easily visible. In monsoon, you merely can view {{gigantism}} of pot holes.
