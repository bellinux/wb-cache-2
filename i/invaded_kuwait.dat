5|$|During CENTCOM {{military}} exercises in July 1990 termed Internal Look '90, Schwarzkopf wrote up {{a scenario that}} tested how the command would respond to a regional dictator invading a neighboring country and threatening oil fields there, a scenario which closely mirrored the rising tension between Iraq and Kuwait. One week {{after the end of}} these exercises, Iraq <b>invaded</b> <b>Kuwait</b> on August 2, 1990.|$|E
5|$|Hours after Ambassador Bishop's {{visit to}} Central Command, Iraq <b>invaded</b> <b>Kuwait.</b> In 1979, the US {{negotiated}} {{access to an}} airport and port in both Mogadishu and Berbera; because of limited access the US had to locations in the Persian Gulf area, maintaining this access was a main interest for the Mogadishu embassy to pursue as the US mobilized to intervene in Kuwait.|$|E
5|$|On 2 August 1990 Iraq, led by President Saddam Hussein, <b>invaded</b> <b>Kuwait.</b> In {{the middle}} of the month U.S. President George H. W.

50|$|There is {{significant}} debate over Iraqi intentions during the October 1994 crisis. Saddam Hussein's son-in-law Hussein Kamel stated after his defection to Jordan in 1995 that Saddam {{had intended to}} <b>invade</b> <b>Kuwait</b> a second time and this was forestalled by a rapid American response to reinforce the kingdom. Others have argued that Saddam never intended to actually <b>invade</b> <b>Kuwait</b> and the movements were intended as a provocation {{to draw attention to}} Iraq's plight under the international sanctions regime.|$|R
5|$|When Saddam Hussein's Iraq <b>invaded</b> <b>Kuwait</b> on 2 August 1990, British Secretary of State for Defence Tom King soon {{announced}} that the UK military contribution to the region was to be increased. A coalition of nations was formed, and a combined naval force entered the Persian Gulf and sailed north, neutralising the Iraqi Navy as it went, and then began conducting naval gunfire support and mine counter-measure missions {{in preparation for the}} main amphibious landing force.|$|E

Bush, in keeping with the Carter Doctrine, sent the first of several hundred {{thousand}} troops, along with a strong force of naval support to Saudi Arabia and the Persian Gulf area to support a multi-national force in a standoff with Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein. On 7 August, Wisconsin and her battle group were ordered to deploy in defense of Kuwait for Operation Desert Shield, and they arrived in the Persian Gulf on 23 August. On 15 January 1991, Operation Desert Storm commenced operations, and Wisconsin found herself serving alongside her younger sister Missouri, just as she had done in Korea forty years previously. Both Wisconsin and Missouri launched Tomahawk Missile attacks against Iraq; they were among the first ships to fire cruise missiles during the 1991 Gulf War. Wisconsin served as the Tomahawk Land Attack Missile (TLAM) strike commander for the Persian Gulf, directing the sequence of launches that marked the opening of Operation Desert Storm and firing a total of 24 of her own TLAMs during the first two days of the campaign. Wisconsin also assumed the responsibility of the local anti-surface warfare coordinator for the Northern Persian Gulf Surface Action Group.|$|E

25|$|The table {{shows the}} {{majority}} of conventional arms imported by Iraq during the 1970s, when the regime was building up the armies which were to attack Iran in 1980, were supplied by the Soviet Union and its satellites, principally Czechoslovakia. The only substantial Western arms supplier to Iraq was France, which {{continued to be a}} major supplier until 1990, when Iraq <b>invaded</b> <b>Kuwait</b> and all legal arms transfers to Iraq ended.|$|E
25|$|The United Nations {{sanctions}} {{placed upon}} Iraq when it <b>invaded</b> <b>Kuwait</b> were not lifted, blocking Iraqi oil exports. During the late 1990s, the UN considered relaxing the sanctions imposed {{because of the}} hardships suffered by ordinary Iraqis. Studies dispute {{the number of people}} who died in south and central Iraq during the years of the sanctions. On 9 December 1996, Saddam's government accepted the Oil-for-Food Programme that the UN had first offered in 1992.|$|E
25|$|Some {{analysts have}} speculated that one of Saddam Hussein's main motivations in <b>invading</b> <b>Kuwait</b> was to punish the ruling al-Sabah family in Kuwait for not {{stopping}} its policy of overproduction, {{as well as his}} reasoning behind the destruction of said wells.|$|R
5000|$|She {{also let}} Saddam Hussein {{know that the}} United States did not intend [...] "to start an {{economic}} war against Iraq". These statements may have caused Saddam to believe he had received a diplomatic green light from the United States to <b>invade</b> <b>Kuwait.</b>|$|R
50|$|General Beg accused Western {{countries}} of encouraging Iraq to <b>invade</b> <b>Kuwait,</b> though {{he continued to}} lead his armed forces against Iraq in support of Saudi Arabia.

25|$|Iraq {{had been}} {{listed as a}} State sponsor of {{terrorism}} by the U.S. since 1990, when Saddam Hussein <b>invaded</b> <b>Kuwait.</b> Iraq had also been on the list from 1979 to 1982; it was removed so that the U.S. could provide material support to Iraq in its war with Iran. Hussein's regime had {{proven to be a}} problem for the UN and Iraq's neighbors due to its use of chemical weapons against Iranians and Kurds in the 1980s.|$|E
25|$|When Iraq <b>invaded</b> <b>Kuwait</b> in 1990, Syria {{joined the}} US-led {{coalition}} against Iraq. This led to improved {{relations with the}} US and other Arab states. Syria participated in the multilateral Southwest Asia Peace Conference in Madrid in October 1991, and during the 1990s engaged in direct negotiations with Israel. These negotiations failed over the Golan Heights issue {{and there have been}} no further direct Syrian-Israeli talks since President Hafez al-Assad's meeting with then President Bill Clinton in Geneva in March 2000.|$|E
25|$|After Iraq <b>invaded</b> <b>Kuwait</b> in 1990 {{and much}} of the world responded by {{amassing}} military assets in the region, the United States Army faced the possibility of experiencing chemical or biological (CB) attack. The possibility of CB attack forced the army to respond with NBC defense crash courses in theater. Troops deployed to the Gulf with protective masks at the ready, protective clothing was made available to those troops whose vicinity to the enemy or mission required it. Large scale drills were conducted in the desert to better acclimatize troops to wearing the bulky protective clothing (called MOPP gear) in hot weather conditions.|$|E
50|$|In 1987, Jamal {{together}} with his fellows in the army were accused to be against the Ba’athist regime, and 1988 were sentenced in a military court to serve time in jail. In 1990, they were released when Saddam Hussein decided to <b>invade</b> <b>Kuwait,</b> as he badly needed Sunni tribes to support his family and regime.|$|R
50|$|In August 1996 when Saddam Hussein {{appeared}} to be planning to <b>invade</b> <b>Kuwait</b> again, 3/8 CAV deployed along with the 3rd Brigade Combat Team, 1st Cavalry Division to Kuwait for a combat mission. Upon arrival in theatre, Saddam Hussein withdrew his forces and the mission became a training mission. The battalion redeployed to Fort Hood in December.|$|R
50|$|Until 2004, Iraqi-Kuwaiti {{relations}} {{were characterized by}} the Iraqi government claiming historic rights to Kuwait. Ever since Kuwaiti independence in 1961, the Iraqi governments sought various opportunities to reclaim and annex Kuwait. A short-lived crisis evolved in 1961, as the Iraqi government threatened to <b>invade</b> <b>Kuwait</b> and the invasion was finally averted following plans by the Arab League to form an international Arab force against Iraqi designs on Kuwait.|$|R
25|$|Operation Desert Shield {{commenced}} in August 1990 when Iraq <b>invaded</b> <b>Kuwait.</b> The 8th SOS was {{deployed to}} Saudi Arabia {{as a deterrent}} against the Iraqi threat to its southern neighbor. In January 1991, when Iraq failed to comply with United Nations directives to withdraw from Kuwait, the proven skills of the 8th SOS were called on once again as Operation Desert Shield escalated into Operation Desert Storm. The 8th SOS {{played a pivotal role}} in the success of coalition forces as they liberated Kuwait by dropping 11 15,000-pound BLU-82 bombs and 23 million leaflets and conducting numerous aerial refuelings of special operations helicopters.|$|E
25|$|In August 1990, Iraq <b>invaded</b> <b>Kuwait,</b> {{triggering}} the Gulf War between Iraq {{and a large}} allied force, led by the United States. Iraq attacked Israel with 39 Scud missiles. Israel did not retaliate at {{request of}} the U.S., fearing that if Israel responded against Iraq, other Arab nations might desert the allied coalition. Israel provided gas masks for both the Palestinian population and Israeli citizens, while Netherlands and the United States deployed Patriot defense batteries in Israel as protection against the Scuds. In May 1991, during a 36-hour period, 15,000 Beta Israel (Ethiopian Jews) were secretly airlifted to Israel. The coalition's victory in the Gulf War opened new possibilities for regional peace, and in October 1991 the U.S. President, George H.W. Bush, and Soviet Union Premier, Mikhail Gorbachev, jointly convened a historic meeting in Madrid of Israeli, Lebanese, Jordanian, Syrian, and Palestinian leaders. Shamir opposed the idea but agreed in return for loan guarantees to help with absorption of immigrants from the former Soviet Union. His participation in the conference led {{to the collapse of}} his (right-wing) coalition.|$|E
500|$|Aware of the {{violence}} {{going on in the}} Somali countryside, Ambassador Bishop felt [...] "the odds were better than even that we would have to leave Mogadishu under less than favorable circumstances." [...] On August 1, Ambassador Bishop visited United States Central Command—the military command for the Middle East and Northeast Africa—where he worked with military experts to review the embassy's Emergencies and Evacuation (E) plan until he was [...] "satisfied...that [...] realized that it might have to conduct an evacuation from Mogadishu and was prepared to do that." [...] A few hours after his visit, Iraq <b>invaded</b> <b>Kuwait.</b> The US was mobilizing assets for a response when Ambassador Bishop arrived in Mogadishu on September 6. The primary interest of the Ambassador was to maintain the US military's permission and access to airfields and ports in Mogadishu and Berbera, which the US had negotiated in 1979. This was especially important given the mobilization for intervention in Kuwait, Somalia's strategic location near the Arabian Peninsula and the mouth of the Red Sea, and because Saudi Arabia would not allow US troops on their soil. The embassy was also home to a large number of USAID staff, although the spread of unrest into the countryside was making their work increasingly difficult.|$|E
50|$|In mid-1962, {{alarmed by}} Qasim's threats to <b>invade</b> <b>Kuwait</b> and his government's {{expropriation}} of 99.5% of the British- and American-owned Iraq Petroleum Company's (IPC) concessionary holdings, President John F. Kennedy ordered the CIA to make preparations {{for a military}} coup that would remove him from power. Archie Roosevelt, Jr. was tasked with leading the operation. Around the same time, the CIA penetrated a top-secret Iraqi-Soviet surface-to-air missile project, which yielded intelligence on the Soviet Union's ballistic missile program.|$|R
50|$|Iraq then <b>invades</b> <b>Kuwait</b> and the British and Americans need {{top level}} {{intelligence}} on the ground. Major Mike Martin of the Special Air Service is seconded to SIS {{to work with}} the Kuwaiti resistance. Not only does Major Martin speak fluent Arabic, but with his black hair and dark complexion, he can actually pass for an Arab. His brother, Terry, an expert in Arab military studies, works with the Medusa Committee, a joint Anglo-American panel on possible Iraqi weapons of mass destruction.|$|R
5000|$|After the August 1990 Iraq {{invasion}} of Kuwait, ABC started {{work on a}} special program about the invasion and sent Salinger to the Middle East, where he obtained a transcript in Arabic of a conversation between Saddam Hussein and the US Ambassador to Iraq, April Glaspie; the latter infamously told Saddam: [...] "We have no opinion on your Arab-Arab conflicts," [...] which was interpreted by some as giving Saddam {{the green light to}} <b>invade</b> <b>Kuwait,</b> which he did only days later.|$|R
2500|$|According to Russ Baker, {{writing in}} the Columbia Journalism Review, a [...] "vast network" [...] based in the U.S. and elsewhere, fed Iraq's warring {{capabilities}} right up until August 1990, when Saddam <b>invaded</b> <b>Kuwait.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Shortly {{before he}} <b>invaded</b> <b>Kuwait,</b> he shipped 100 new Mercedes 200 Series cars to top editors in Egypt and Jordan. Two {{days before the}} first attacks, Saddam {{reportedly}} offered Egypt's Hosni Mubarak 50 million dollars in cash, [...] "ostensibly for grain".|$|E
2500|$|In 1990, Iraq <b>invaded</b> <b>Kuwait.</b> The {{invasion}} of Kuwait by Iraqi forces {{led to the}} 1990–91 Gulf War. Egypt, Qatar, Syria and Saudi Arabia joined a multinational coalition that opposed Iraq. Displays of support for Iraq by Jordan and Palestine resulted in strained relations between many of the Arab states. After the war, a so-called [...] "Damascus Declaration" [...] formalized an alliance for future joint Arab defensive actions between Egypt, Syria, and the GCC member states.|$|E
50|$|Batma {{oil field}} was {{discovered}} by Mosul oil company, a branch of Iraq Petroleum Company 1953. The oilfield is 12 km long and 6 km wide. The production commenced in that year with 5.0000 barrels per day. The production has been stopped since 1990 due to the United Nations' financial and trade embargo ('sanctions') against Iraq after its <b>invading</b> <b>Kuwait,</b> resume of production has been postponed further after the Iraq war. Batma is considered a small field compared with other Iraqi fields, where its potential production not more than 5.000 barrel per day.|$|R
50|$|Aug: Iraq <b>invades</b> <b>Kuwait.</b> Crude {{and product}} prices soar upward; {{exchange}} markets react wildly to any middle east news events; cash markets dominate prices after trading hours; jet fuel prices rise to record spreads over other products due {{to increase in}} defense demand. In late August, OPEC president fails to revive floundering attempts to organize a formal OPEC meeting to discuss crisis/production strategies. Informal meetings held in Vienna result in record price falls. Conflicting reports of promises to increase OPEC output to compensate for embargo of Iraq and Kuwait oil further compound market uncertainties.|$|R
25|$|The United States {{also put}} {{financial}} {{pressure on the}} UK to end the invasion. Because the Bank of England had lost $45 million between 30 October and 2 November, and their oil supply had been damaged by {{the closing of the}} Suez Canal, the British sought immediate assistance from the IMF, but it was denied by the United States. Eisenhower in fact ordered his Secretary of the Treasury, George M. Humphrey, to prepare to sell part of the US Government's Sterling Bond holdings. The UK government considered <b>invading</b> <b>Kuwait</b> and Qatar if oil sanctions were put in place by the US.|$|R
