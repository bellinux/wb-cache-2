40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to study the {{influence}} of nitrogen compounds on the formation of volatile compounds during the alcoholic fermentation carried out with 4 nonaromatic <b>grape</b> varieties <b>collected</b> at 2 different maturation stages. To do this, Monastrell, Merlot, Syrah, and Petit Verdot <b>grapes</b> were <b>collected</b> 1 wk before harvest and at harvest. Then, the musts were inoculated with the same Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast strain and were fermented in the same winemaking conditions. Amino acids that showed the highest and the lowest concentration in the must were the same, regardless of the grape variety and maturation stage. Moreover, the consumption of amino acids during the fermentation increased with their concentration in the must. The formation of volatile compounds was not nitrogen composition dependent. However, the concentration of amino acids in the must from <b>grapes</b> <b>collected</b> 1 wk before harvest {{can be used as}} a parameter to estimate the concentration of esters in wines from <b>grapes</b> <b>collected</b> at harvest and therefore to have more information to know the grape oenological capacity. Application of principal components analysis (PCA) confirmed the possibility to estimate the concentration of esters in the wines with the concentration of nitrogen compounds in the must.

40|$|ABSTRACT. A {{mechanical}} harvester {{was developed to}} harvest sweet cherries for the fresh market. The harvester operator used joysticks to position and engage a rapid displacement actuator on main scaffolds to effect fruit removal.

A catching conveyor was designed to intercept falling fruit without damage and elevate the fruit to a <b>collecting</b> <b>conveyor.</b> Mechanically harvested cherries had only 2 – 6 % more damage than did commercially hand–harvested cherries and graded 85 – 92 % marketable...|$|R

All isolates were analyzed by mitochondrial DNA {{restriction fragment length polymorphism}} (mtDNA RFLP) and a pattern profile was verified for each isolate, resulting in a total of 297 different profiles, all revealed to belong to the species Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The strains corresponding to seventeen profiles showed a wider temporal and geographical distribution, being characterized by a generalized pattern of sporadic presence, absence and reappearance. One strain (ACP 10) showed a more regional distribution with a perennial behavior. In different fermentations ACP 10 was either dominant or not, showing that the final outcome of fermentation was dependent on the specific composition of the yeast community in the must. Few of the <b>grape</b> samples <b>collected</b> before harvest initiated a spontaneous fermentation, compared to the samples collected after harvest, in a time frame of about 2 weeks.

The experimental harvester demonstrated potential for harvesting stemless sweet cherries with fresh–market fruit quality comparable to commercial hand–picked cherries. The catching/collecting system was effective with low damage inflicted to the cherries. About 90 % of the cherries were remove from the tree and of those removed, 88 % were collected and containerized. These levels are expected to increase with proper tree training and appropriate sized catching surfaces.

It could also be produced by burning {{the remains of the}} crushed <b>grapes,</b> which were <b>collected</b> and dried in an oven. According to the historian Vitruvius, the deepness and richness of the black produced corresponded {{to the quality of the}} wine. The finest wines produced a black with a bluish tinge the color of indigo.|$|R
40|$|We herein {{evaluate}} intraspecific {{genetic diversity}} of fermentative vineyard-associated S. cerevisiae strains and evaluate relationships between grape varieties and geographical location on populational structures. From the musts obtained from 288 <b>grape</b> samples, <b>collected</b> from two wine regions (16 vineyards, nine grape varieties), 94 spontaneous fermentations were concluded and 2820 yeast isolates were obtained that belonged mainly (92 %) to the species S. cerevisiae. Isolates were classified in 321 strains {{by the use}} of ten microsatellite markers. A high strain diversity (8 – 43 strains per fermentation) was associated with high percentage (60 – 100 %) of fermenting samples per vineyard, whereas a lower percentage of spontaneous fermentations (0 – 40 %) corresponded to a rather low strain diversity (1 – 10 strains per fermentation) ...|$|R
40|$|Ochratoxin A (OTA) in wine {{is linked}} to {{contamination}} by several Aspergillus species. In 2003 – 2007, <b>grape</b> samples <b>collected</b> in Italy were surveyed {{for the presence of}} OTA and OTA-producing fungi. A. niger aggregate was the prevalent species. A. carbonarius, which is considered the main source of OTA in grapes, was mostly found in Southern Italy. The year and the environment had an important influence {{on the development of the}} black Aspergillus populations. Testing with ELISA showed OTA to be present in about 30 % of the samples. Samples from Southern Italy showed the highest occurrence (45 %) and also the highest OTA concentration, sometimes higher than 2 μg/L. The values decreased progressively the further North the samples were taken...|$|R
