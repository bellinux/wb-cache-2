40|$|Abstract. The {{software}} ANSYS {{was used}} to perform the calculation of combined simulation for the track beams under <b>eccentric</b> <b>load</b> in the third wharf in a shipping company and to check whether the beams {{meet the requirements of}} safe use. In order {{to take into account the}} horizontal constraints of concrete surface slabs of high-piled wharf on track beams, a finite element model of the structure consisted of a crossbeam and piles was first established to calculate the equivalent spring restraint stiffness. Then the nonlinear finite element analysis of track beams under <b>eccentric</b> <b>load</b> was performed. The results show that the cracking of concrete cover at the tension side and the bottom of track beams under <b>eccentric</b> <b>load</b> may occur, but the tensile steel bars at the bottom of beam do not yield.

50|$|Vibration {{training}} is purely eccentric and anaerobic in traction which {{can take the}} targeted muscles to complete fatigue over {{a short period of}} time (approximately 60 seconds). The reason for the short duration of the sets is that the muscle can respond in an eccentric fashion down to approximately 40 m/s (40 contractions per second), as opposed to concentric contractions that are much slower and less powerful. The reason the eccentric phase is sought after for physiotherapy or training purposes is heavy <b>eccentric</b> <b>loading</b> taking the muscle to complete fatigue does not induce the same amount of tissue damage or inflammation markers as concentric phases do, but exert the same amount of force and energy from the body.|$|E
50|$|Muscles {{undergoing}} heavy <b>eccentric</b> <b>loading</b> suffer greater damage when overloaded (such {{as during}} muscle building or strength training exercise) {{as compared to}} concentric loading. When eccentric contractions are used in weight training, they are normally called negatives. During a concentric contraction, muscle fibers slide across each other, pulling the Z-lines together. During an eccentric contraction, the filaments slide past each other the opposite way, though the actual movement of the myosin heads during an eccentric contraction is not known. Exercise featuring a heavy eccentric load can actually support a greater weight (muscles are approximately 40% stronger during eccentric contractions than during concentric contractions) and also results in greater muscular damage and delayed onset muscle soreness one to two days after training. Exercise that incorporates both eccentric and concentric muscular contractions (i.e., involving a strong contraction and a controlled lowering of the weight) can produce greater gains in strength than concentric contractions alone. While unaccustomed heavy eccentric contractions can easily lead to overtraining, moderate training may confer protection against injury.|$|E

50|$|Abdominal {{exercises}} {{can also}} be performed {{with the help of}} some machines and the captain's chair {{is one of the most}} popular machines used in gyms and health clubs. Other machines are the Ab Roller, the Ab Rocket Twister, the Chin-up bar in conjunction with Ab Straps and the Torso Track. The exercise ball is also a tool that helps strengthen the abs. It may be more effective than the crunches on the floor because the abs do more work as the legs are not involved in the exercise. With respect to the Ab-Slide, the study performed by Bird et al. showed greater muscle activation in the upper rectus abdominis, lower rectus abdominis, and external oblique when compared to the standard abdominal crunch. The Ab-Slide has proven to be an effective tool in strengthening the abdominal muscles from a concentric muscle action perspective. However, this research does not support replacing the traditional crunch exercise with the Ab-Slide gadget due to the lack of proven effectiveness in the <b>eccentric</b> <b>loading</b> of the abdominal muscles and the greater postural control. Potentially the most effective equipment for abdominal strengthening are those that offer the least stability. Examples include the CoreFitnessRoller, bodyweight suspension training such as TRX and stability balls with or without the Halo.|$|E
50|$|Internally, beams {{subjected}} to loads {{that do not}} induce torsion or axial loading experience compressive, tensile and shear stresses {{as a result of}} the loads applied to them. Typically, under gravity loads, the original length of the beam is slightly reduced to enclose a smaller radius arc at the top of the beam, resulting in compression, while the same original beam length at the bottom of the beam is slightly stretched to enclose a larger radius arc, and so is under tension. Modes of deformation where the top face of the beam is in compression, as under a vertical load, are known as sagging modes and where the top is in tension, for example over a support, is known as hogging. The same original length of the middle of the beam, generally halfway between the top and bottom, is the same as the radial arc of bending, and so it is under neither compression nor tension, and defines the neutral axis (dotted line in the beam figure). Above the supports, the beam is exposed to shear stress. There are some reinforced concrete beams in which the concrete is entirely in compression with tensile forces taken by steel tendons. These beams are known as prestressed concrete beams, and are fabricated to produce a compression more than the expected tension under loading conditions. High strength steel tendons are stretched while the beam is cast over them. Then, when the concrete has cured, the tendons are slowly released and the beam is immediately under eccentric axial loads. This <b>eccentric</b> <b>loading</b> creates an internal moment, and, in turn, increases the moment carrying capacity of the beam. They are commonly used on highway bridges.|$|E
50|$|The {{advantage}} of a spiral conveyor {{is that it can}} be used with a minimum amount of control software. The disadvantages are that a relatively large area (floor space) is required compared with other product lifts and vertical transport takes {{a great deal of time}} on account of the number of cycles which the transport belt completes. Certain products can also become misshapen since they are transported at an angle. One only has to think of plastic bottles which are wrapped in clingfilm which can become permanently misshapen if the clingfilm has still not completely cooled. A product is only supported at two angles on a spiral conveyor, because of the lifting angle and the radius within which the transport conveyor is placed. If a product has to be supported so that it is flat during transport, this will not be possible with a spiral conveyor. The drive motor of a spiral conveyor must always be controlled with a frequency regulator in order to prevent excessive slippage of the transport belt. It is also necessary to take account that products must not touch at intake. If products are touching each other at intake, the products can become jammed, which can result in the transport belt breaking down. It is, therefore, recommended that a good feed mechanism be provided for a spiral conveyor. In the case of most spiral conveyors, products must also be presented centrally, as the <b>eccentric</b> <b>loading</b> of spiral conveyors can cause excessive slippage. If a product becomes stuck for any reason, there is a good to a very good chance that the lamellae of the transport belt will disintegrate, which can cause a considerable loss in production along the whole of the production line, something which is associated with huge additional costs for replacements.|$|E

This paper investigates the effect of <b>eccentric</b> <b>loads</b> on steel scaffolding systems used in construction sites. The type of scaffold considered here is the door-shaped steel scaffold with an inner reinforced gable sub-frame. The single-side cross-brace scaffolding systems with various <b>eccentric</b> <b>loads</b> are mainly focused on two issues, namely, the unrestrained boundary and the removal of cross-braces at the access location. This study shows that regardless of the lowest layer of cross-brace in a scaffold being removed or not, the critical load of a scaffolding system under an <b>eccentric</b> <b>load</b> is the lowest, whereas that of scaffolding system under a concentric load is the maximum. If the bottom jack base of a scaffolding system in construction sites is strengthened to a fixed end, the critical load of this scaffolding system will be greatly increased. If a scaffolding system is erected more than 8 stories high, the critical load of the scaffolding system with the fixed end base can be increased to 2. 4 times that with the hinged base. However, whether the cross-braces at the lowest story of a scaffolding system are removed or not, the simulated scaffolding test indicates that the critical load of a used scaffolding system under the <b>eccentric</b> <b>load</b> is the lowest and its load reduction also appears significant.

40|$|The {{load-carrying}} capacity and deformability of concrete columns can be substantially enhanced by confining with post-tensioned steel straps. As interest in high-strength concrete (HSC) grows among structural engineers and researchers {{due to its}} superior performance, this confining technique is being extended to HSC columns {{with the hope that}} it can eliminate the undesired properties of HSC, especially its brittleness. However, experimental studies involving confined HSC columns subjected to <b>eccentric</b> <b>loads</b> are comparatively limited.
