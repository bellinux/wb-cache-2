The fact that the Ashes must be fought for is a further damper. <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> a series is drawn, then the Ashes should at least go into pawn so that no one holds them.|$|E
500|$|Shortly thereafter, Information Minister Ahmad Shabery Cheek {{insisted that}} ketuanan Melayu did not imply a {{master-slave}} relationship {{in any sense}} between the Malays and non-Malays. Instead, he suggested, it referred to {{the institution of the}} Malay monarchs, who had once been the [...] "masters", but gave up their primacy when the Federal Constitution was adopted at independence. Shabery cited Article 182 of the Constitution, which grants the royalty certain legal immunities, as an example of Malay supremacy. However, some prominent members of the royalty such as the Raja of Perlis and former Yang di-Pertuan Agong Tuanku Syed Sirajuddin Putra Syed Jamalullail have themselves been critical of ketuanan Melayu; in early 2009, the Raja stated that [...] "In Malaysia, every race is tuan ... <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> everyone understands that every individual of any race, should not be deprived of their rights, then the efforts of certain parties who think that the supremacy or rights should only be given to a particular race can be stopped." ...|$|E

"My motive in {{desiring}} {{to become}} acquainted with Mr Keswick," [...] said Lawrence, [...] "is one you could scarcely understand, and all I can say about it is, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> knew the gentleman who had formerly been the accepted lover of a lady, I should better know the lady." ...|$|R

2500|$|When {{the elderly}} Schopenhauer {{sat for a}} {{sculpture}} portrait by the Prussian sculptor Elisabet Ney in 1859, he was much impressed by the young woman's wit and independence, {{as well as by}} her skill as a visual artist. After his time with Ney, he told Richard Wagner's friend Malwida von Meysenbug, [...] "I have not yet spoken my last word about women. <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> a woman succeeds in withdrawing from the mass, or rather raising herself above the mass, she grows ceaselessly and more than a man." ...|$|E

Wyden added, [...] "While I continue to have concerns about ensuring that taxpayers are protected if this loan is to occur, <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> the President can unwisely provide $750 billion of taxpayer money for the investment banks who took horribly unacceptable risks and helped trigger an economic collapse, we certainly have a duty to attempt to preserve a cornerstone domestic industry and the jobs {{of hundreds of thousands of}} working people whose personal actions are in no way responsible for the current economic crisis." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2004, Knight reprised {{the role}} of Ruth in Pirates with the Lyric Opera of Chicago. [...] Chicago radio host Bruce Duffie, {{interviewing}} Knight after seeing that production noted, [...] "Gillian Knight {{is one of those}} great personalities who simply go about their business season after season, giving splendid renditions of various roles, and adding luster to their home companies while not going far afield very often and, thus, passing up the opportunity for real world-wide stardom". During that interview, Knight said, [...] "I'm getting a bit controversial here, but there is a snobbish attitude towards Gilbert and Sullivan in the opera world.... I believe in excellence. [...] Now <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> Gilbert and Sullivan is done well... then it is excellent, and it should be in a [...] house". [...] She advised audiences, [...] "Don't close your mind to anything because somebody has said, 'Oh, this is Gilbert and Sullivan,' or, 'This is modern music.'

2500|$|In June 1978, {{members of}} the Ananda Marga {{organisation}} were implicated by a police informant, Richard John Seary, but his evidence has been discredited. A member of Ananda Marga, Evan Pederick, claimed in 1989 that he had carried out the Hilton bombing on the orders of another member, Tim Anderson. Both men were given prison sentences, but Anderson was acquitted on appeal in 1991 [...] Pederick appealed but his appeal failed and he served eight years in prison. In directing Anderson's acquittal NSW Chief Justice Murray Gleeson said: [...] "The trial of the appellant miscarried principally because of an error which resulted in large part from {{the failure of the}} prosecuting authorities adequately to check aspects of the Jayewardene theory. This was compounded by what I regard as an inappropriate and unfair attempt by the Crown to persuade the jury to draw inferences of fact, and accept argumentative suggestions, that were not properly open on the evidence. I do not consider that in those circumstances the Crown should be given a further opportunity to patch up its case against the appellant. It has already made one attempt too many to do that, and <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that,</b> <b>if</b> that attempt had never been made, there is a strong likelihood that the appellant would have been acquitted.".|$|E

[...] Love {{also said that he}} wanted to continue developing an R sound with Rowland, following the US chart success of her single [...] "Motivation" [...] (2011), which he co-wrote and co-produced. [...] "I believe in R and <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> we make new age records and don't make dated records and keep it classic, I think we'll be fine."

On March 23, 2012, Rowland confirmed via Twitter that she was working with rapper T-Pain. Sean Garrett revealed in an interview with Rap-Up on May 9, 2012 that he also contributed to the album. He stated, [...] "Her swag is dope and I'm just so happy to see her get her shot. I'ma do what I can to make sure Kelly right."

This resulted in an increase of demographic diversity within institutions and more minorities being able to receive higher paying jobs.|$|R
