5|$|On 11 August 1918, Hipper was {{promoted}} to Admiral and given command of the entire High Seas Fleet. Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter replaced Hipper as {{the commander of the}} IScouting Group; <b>he</b> <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> flag on Hindenburg the following day.|$|E
5|$|Romanos Lekapenos {{had risen}} to power in 919, when {{he had managed to}} appoint himself regent over the young Constantine VII and marry his {{daughter}} Helena to him. Within a year, he successively rose from basileopator to Caesar, and was eventually crowned senior emperor on 17 December 920. To consolidate his hold on power, and with a view of supplanting the ruling Macedonian dynasty with his own family, <b>he</b> <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> eldest son Christopher to co-emperor in May 921, while Stephen and Constantine were proclaimed co-emperors on 25 December 924.|$|E
5|$|Undaunted by {{this lack}} of {{confidence}} from his peers, Johnson continued to campaign to retain his office. Although his campaign was more vigorous than that of Van Buren, his behavior {{on the campaign trail}} raised concern among voters. He made rambling, incoherent speeches. During one speech in Ohio, <b>he</b> <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> shirt in order to display to the crowd the wounds he received during the Battle of the Thames. Charges he leveled against Harrison in Cleveland were so poorly received that they touched off a riot in the city.|$|E

5|$|At {{the age of}} fifteen, Brock {{joined the}} 8th (The King's) Regiment of Foot on 8 March 1785 with the rank of ensign, and was likely given {{responsibility}} for the regimental colours. His elder brother John was already {{an officer in the}} same regiment. As was usual at the time, Brock's commission was purchased. On 16 January 1790 he bought the rank of lieutenant and later that year <b>he</b> <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> own company of men. As a result, he was promoted to captain (of an independent company of foot) on 27 January 1791 and transferred to the 49th (Hertfordshire) Regiment of Foot on 15 June 1791.|$|E
5|$|John ruled as Despot in Thessalonica for two years, {{until his}} death in 1244. Theodore himself retired to Vodena, from where he {{supervised}} the affairs of state. On John's death <b>he</b> <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> younger son Demetrios Komnenos Doukas (r. 1244–46) in his place, and sent an embassy to Nicaea to announce the succession, as befitted the terms of vassalage agreed in 1242. If John was a religious ascetic, Demetrios was a dissolute youngster who enjoyed partying with his favourites and seducing married women. Although Theodore remained in charge of governance, Demetrios quickly became so unpopular that many leading citizens began viewing direct Nicaean rule with favour.|$|E
5|$|He {{was born}} Nils Johan Nilsen to a Norwegian family in Seljeskog in Salangen on 3 June 1894, {{as the oldest}} of six children. As a child, Nelsen was an active skier and ski jumper, with more than fifteen ski jumps located in the area. In 1913, his family emigrated to Big Eddy near Revelstoke. Once in Canada, he anglicized his name. His brother, Ivind Nilsen was also a {{champion}} ski jumper, and became among other things Boy's World Champion in 1922. Ivind, who chose not to anglicize his last name, {{was known for his}} supreme style, while Nels was better known for his length. Nelsen married Emma Pickard, with whom he had ten children. Except for a brief period as a ski instructor, he worked as a brakeman and conductor for the Canadian Pacific Railway, whose flexibility made it easer to participate in tournaments. He moved to North Vancouver where <b>he</b> <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> family.|$|E

5|$|Hindenburg was {{the last}} battlecruiser {{completed}} for the Imperial German Navy, and as such had a very short career. She was commissioned 10 May 1917, and was fully operational by 20 October 1917, too late to see any major action in World War I. On 17 November Hindenburg and Moltke, along with the light cruisers of the IIScouting Group, were acting as distant support for German minesweepers off the German coast when they were attacked by British battlecruisers. The raid was brief; by the time Hindenburg and Moltke arrived on the scene, the British ships had broken off the attack and withdrawn. Six days later, Hindenburg replaced Seydlitz as flagship of the IScouting Group. On 23 April 1918, the ship took part in an abortive fleet advance into the North Sea that attempted to intercept an Allied convoy. Moltke sustained mechanical damage while en route, and as a result, Vice Admiral Hipper decided to cancel the operation. On 11 August, Hipper was promoted to Admiral and given command of the entire High Seas Fleet. Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter replaced Hipper as {{the commander of the}} IScouting Group; <b>he</b> <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> flag on Hindenburg the following day.|$|E
5|$|The {{tour was}} another triumph for the leg-spin attack of O'Reilly and Grimmett, but O'Reilly was {{slightly}} overshadowed by his teammate in the Tests. With 44 wickets, Grimmett {{set a new}} record {{for the number of}} wickets by an Australian in a Test series, and <b>he</b> <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> Test career total to 216 wickets, beating the then world record of 189 by Englishman Sydney Barnes. O'Reilly took 27 Test wickets at an average of just over 17 runs each: the other bowlers in the Australian team took 27 wickets between them. On the tour as a whole, O'Reilly came out ahead of Grimmett, with 95 wickets against Grimmett's 92, and an average of 13.56 against 14.80. O'Reilly also revealed hitherto undiscovered batting talents, making an undefeated 56 in the Fourth Test in Johannesburg, and putting on 69 for the last wicket with Ernie McCormick. It was the only time in his first-class cricket career that he passed 50. During the tour, O'Reilly developed his leg trap; the opening batsmen Jack Fingleton and Bill Brown were used in these positions.|$|E
5|$|Even {{after the}} {{imperial}} fleet reached the island, Andronikos III offered to let Martino keep his possessions {{in exchange for}} the installation of a Byzantine garrison and the payment of an annual tribute, but Martino refused. He sank his three galleys in the harbour, forbade the Greek population to bear arms and locked himself with 800 men in his citadel, where <b>he</b> <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> own banner instead of the emperor's. His will to resist was broken, however, when Benedetto surrendered his own fort to the Byzantines, and when he saw the locals welcoming them, he was soon forced to surrender. The emperor spared his life, even though the Chians demanded his execution, and took him prisoner to Constantinople. Martino's wife and relatives were allowed to go free with their movable wealth, while most of the Zaccaria adherents chose to stay on the island as imperial officials. Benedetto was offered the island's governorship, but he obstinately demanded to receive it as a personal possession {{in the same way as}} his brother had held it, a concession the emperor was unwilling to grant. Benedetto retired to the Genoese colony of Galata, from where a few years later he made an unsuccessful attempt to reclaim Chios; he died soon after. Andronikos III appointed Kalothetos as the new governor of Chios, and followed up his success by sailing to Phocaea, forcing it to acknowledge his suzerainty.|$|E

25|$|Donnchadh hence {{became a}} part of the Albany Stewart nexus when the Earl of Albany acted as regent during King James's {{imprisonment}} in England. Albany refused to ransom King James and tried to prevent his return. After the king's return, they challenged the crown's authority. These Stewart ties led to Donnchadh's downfall. In 1425, <b>he</b> <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> men of Lennox in a revolt against King James I in support of Muiredach and his son Walter and was executed.|$|E
25|$|He {{also served}} in World War II {{commanding}} the 3rd Battle Squadron from 1940 and the 18th Cruiser Squadron from 1942. It {{is said that}} he had something of a reputation of being a Jonah in any cruiser in which <b>he</b> <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> Admiral's flag, as these kept being sunk from under his feet. He was made Flag Officer, Malta in 1942 and retired due to ill health in 1943 although he was recalled in 1944 to lead Naval Convoys.|$|E

25|$|Malone led the NBA in {{free throws}} made a league-record seven times. He was a {{physical}} defender and rebounder, {{and one of}} the most durable players ever in the NBA. He maintained a high level of play even at age 40, becoming the oldest player to both log a triple-double and to be a starter on an NBA Finals-bound team. Malone's work ethic showed prominently in his formative years in the NBA, when <b>he</b> <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> free throw shooting percentage from below 50% to 75%.|$|E
25|$|In {{his first}} {{years in the}} league, he had a few, but {{effective}} and powerful moves underneath the basket which already made him an effective post player. During the off-season prior to the 2005–06 season, he trimmed his weight to increase his quickness and added more finesse moves underneath the basket {{so that he could}} score without having to utilize power all the time. But most importantly, he worked on his shooting range and developed a dependable 18ft. jumper. As a result, <b>he</b> <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> scoring by 4.7 points in that season.|$|E
25|$|As {{the city}} of Bucharest was spread over a large area and lacked any kind of fortifications, Mavrogenes decided to build some, {{including}} the digging of a moat from Cotroceni to Oborul Vechi, as well as reinforcing the walls of inns and monasteries (which were thus turned into crude fortresses). Unlike any other Phanariote ruler, <b>he</b> <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> own army, which reached 5–10,000 men and was equipped with several cannons, but it was unruly and poorly trained. In addition, Mavrogenes asked for the Ottoman army to help him seal the border with Habsburg Transylvania and reinforce the borders with Moldavia.|$|E

25|$|Palmer's {{first tour}} win came during {{his rookie season}} of 1955; he won Canadian Open and earned $2,400 for his efforts. <b>He</b> <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> game status {{for the next several}} seasons. Palmer's {{charisma}} was a major factor in establishing golf as a compelling television event in the 1950s and 1960s, which {{set the stage for the}} popularity it enjoys today. His first major championship win at the 1958 Masters Tournament—where he earned $11,250—established his position as one of the leading stars in golf, and by 1960 he had signed up as pioneering sports agent Mark McCormack's first client.|$|E
25|$|According to the Warren Commission and the House Select Committee on Assassinations, Kennedy {{was waving}} to the crowds {{on his right}} with his right arm upraised {{on the side of}} the limo when a shot entered his upper back, {{penetrated}} his neck and slightly damaged a spinal vertebra and the top of his right lung. The bullet exited his throat nearly centerline just beneath his larynx and nicked the left side of his suit tie knot. <b>He</b> <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> elbows and clenched his fists in front of his face and neck, then leaned forward and left.

25|$|After {{his initial}} fast start, Laxman {{settled into a}} more sedate rate of scoring, while Dravid {{continued}} to go slowly. After one particularly long period without scoring a run, Dravid's next single was loudly greeted with ironic applause and <b>he</b> <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> bat to humorously acknowledge the crowd. Dravid made 55 while Laxman scored his third century in as many Tests at the SCG, but was fortunate to survive a close LBW call. The Australians took late wickets, removing both Laxman (109) and Dravid in quick succession to leave Tendulkar and Ganguly at the crease. The new pair survived to stumps with the score on 3/215.|$|E
