40|$|Mercury {{transformation}} {{mechanisms and}} speciation profiles are reviewed for mercury formed in and released from flue gases of coal-fired boilers, non-ferrous metal smelters, cement plants, <b>iron</b> <b>and</b> <b>steel</b> plants, {{municipal solid waste}} incinerators, and biomass burning. Mercury in coal, ores and other raw materials is released to flue gases {{in the form of}} Hg 0 during combustion or smelting in boilers, kilns or furnaces. Decreasing temperature from over 800 °C to below 300 °C in flue gases leaving boilers, kilns or furnaces promotes homogeneous and heterogeneous oxidation of gaseous elemental mercury (Hg 0) to gaseous divalent mercury (Hg 2 +), with a portion of Hg 2 + adsorbed onto fly ash to form particulate-bound mercury (Hg p). Halogen is the primary oxidizer for Hg 0 in flue gases, and active components (e. g.,TiO 2, Fe 2 O 3, etc.) on fly ash promote heterogeneous oxidation and adsorption processes. In addition to mercury removal, mercury transformation also occurs when passing through air pollution control devices (APCDs), affecting the mercury speciation in flue gases. In coal-fired power plants, selective catalytic reduction (SCR) system promotes mercury oxidation by 34 – 85 %, electrostatic precipitator (ESP) and fabric filter (FF) remove over 99 % of Hg p, and wet flue gas desulfurization system (WFGD) captures 60 – 95 % of Hg 2 +. In non-ferrous metal smelters, most Hg 0 is converted to Hg 2 + and removed in acid plants (APs). For cement clinker production, mercury cycling and operational conditions promote heterogeneous mercury oxidation and adsorption. The mercury speciation profiles in flue gases emitted to the atmosphere are determined by transformation mechanisms and mercury removal efficiencies by various APCDs. For all the sectors reviewed in this study, Hg p accounts for less than 5 % in flue gases. In China, mercury emission has a higher fraction (66 – 82 % of total mercury) in flue gases from coal combustion, in contrast to a greater Hg 2 + fraction (29 – 90 %) from non-ferrous metal smelting, cement and iron/steel production. The higher Hg 2 + fractions shown here than previous estimates may imply stronger local environmental impacts than previously thought, caused by mercury emissions in East Asia. Future research should focus on determining mercury speciation in flue gases from <b>iron</b> <b>and</b> <b>steel</b> plants, <b>waste</b> incineration <b>and</b> biomass burning, and on elucidating the mechanisms of mercury oxidation and adsorption in flue gases...|$|R

This document is published by the European Commission pursuant to Article 13 (6) of the Directive. This BREF for Large Combustion Plants concerns the following activities specified in Annex I to Directive 2010 / 75 /EU: - 1. 1 : Combustion of fuels in installations with a total rated thermal input of 50 MW or more, only when this activity takes place in combustion plants with a total rated thermal input of 50 MW or more. - 1. 4 : Gasification of coal or other fuels in installations with a total rated thermal input of 20 MW or more, only when this activity is directly associated to a combustion plant. - 5. 2 : Disposal or recovery of waste in waste co-incineration plants for non-hazardous waste with a capacity exceeding 3 tonnes per hour or for hazardous waste with a capacity exceeding 10 tonnes per day, only when this activity takes place in combustion plants covered under 1. 1 above. In particular, this document covers upstream and downstream activities directly associated with the aforementioned activities including the emission prevention and control techniques applied. The fuels considered in this document are any solid, liquid and/or gaseous combustible material including: - solid fuels (e. g. coal, lignite, peat); - biomass (as defined in Article 3 (31) of Directive 2010 / 75 /EU); - liquid fuels (e. g. heavy fuel oil and gas oil); - gaseous fuels (e. g. natural gas, hydrogen-containing gas and syngas); - industry-specific fuels (e. g. by-products from the chemical <b>and</b> <b>iron</b> <b>and</b> <b>steel</b> industries); - <b>waste</b> except mixed municipal waste as defined in Article 3 (39) and except other waste listed in Article 42 (2) (a) (ii) and (iii) of Directive 2010 / 75 /EU. Important issues for the implementation of Directive 2010 / 75 /EU in the Large Combustion Plants sector are the emissions to air of nitrogen oxides, sulphur dioxide, hydrogen chloride and fluoride, organic compounds, dust, and metals including mercury; emissions to water resulting especially from the use of wet abatement techniques for the removal of sulphur dioxide from the flue gases; resource efficiency and especially energy efficiency. This BREF contains 12 Chapters. Chapters 1 and 2 provide general information on the Large Combustion Plants industrial sector and on the industrial processes used within this sector. Chapter 3 provides data and general information concerning the environmental performance of installations within the sector in terms of water consumption, the generation of waste and general techniques used within this sector. It also describes in more detail the general techniques to prevent or, where this is not practicable, to reduce the environmental impact of installations in this sector that were considered in determining the BAT. Chapters 4 to 9 provide the following information given below on specific combustion processes (gasification, combustion of solid fuel, combustion of liquid fuel, combustion of gaseous fuel, multi-fuel combustion and waste co-incineration). Chapter 10 presents the BAT conclusions as defined in Article 3 (12) of the Directive. Chapter 11 presents information on 'emerging techniques' as defined in Article 3 (14) of the Directive.
