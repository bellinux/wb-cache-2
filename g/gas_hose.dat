5|$|At the {{beginning}} of December 1910 Smoller, using the name Joe Levi, visited Exchange Buildings, a small cul-de-sac that backed onto the properties of Houndsditch. He rented No. 11 Exchange Buildings; a week later Svaars rented number 9 for a month, saying he needed it for storage. The gang were unable to rent number 10, which was directly behind their target, 119 Houndsditch, the jeweller's shop owned by Henry Samuel Harris. The safe in the jeweller's was reputed to contain between £20,000 and £30,000 worth of jewellery; Harris's son later stated the total was only around £7,000. Over {{the next two weeks}} the gang brought in various pieces of necessary equipment, including a 60-foot (18.25m) length of India rubber <b>gas</b> <b>hose,</b> a cylinder of compressed gas and a selection of tools, including diamond-tipped drills.|$|E

500|$|The typical GMAW {{welding gun}} {{has a number}} of key partsa control switch, a contact tip, a power cable, a gas nozzle, an {{electrode}} conduit and liner, and a <b>gas</b> <b>hose.</b> The control switch, or trigger, when pressed by the operator, initiates the wire feed, electric power, and the shielding gas flow, causing an electric arc to be struck. The contact tip, normally made of copper and sometimes chemically treated to reduce spatter, is connected to the welding power source through the power cable and transmits the electrical energy to the electrode while directing it to the weld area. [...] It must be firmly secured and properly sized, since it must allow the electrode to pass while maintaining electrical contact. On the way to the contact tip, the wire is protected and guided by the electrode conduit and liner, which help prevent buckling and maintain an uninterrupted wire feed.

50|$|The Hilo massacre, {{also known}} as Bloody Monday, was an {{incident}} that occurred on 1 August 1938, in Hilo, Hawaii, when over 70 police officers attempted to disband 200 unarmed protesters during a strike, injuring 50 of the demonstrators.

50|$|The pneumofathometer hose has {{a smaller}} bore than the main {{breathing}} <b>gas</b> <b>hose</b> of the umbilical, {{but it is}} connected to the same gas supply at the gas panel, and {{can be used as a}} secondary route for surface supplied breathing gas for the diver if the main hose malfunctions. The open end of the pneumo hose can be inserted under the neck seal of the helmet or the face seal of a full-face mask, unless the helmet is sealed to the suit to prevent contamination by a hazardous environment. This is colloquially known as pneumo-breathing, and is a useful adjunct to the bailout set, as the gas supply is less limited. Pneumo-breathing may be used during the exit from a dive aborted after main <b>gas</b> <b>hose</b> failure as it allows the emergency gas supply to be conserved in case of a further failure.|$|E

5000|$|For {{shallow water}} surface supply air diving, the diver's {{umbilical}} is typically a 3-part umbilical comprising a <b>gas</b> <b>hose,</b> [...] ("pneumo") hose, and diver communications cable, which usually {{also serves as}} a lifeline strength member. The pneumo hose is open at the diver's end and connected to a pressure gauge on the surface gas panel, where the supervisor can use it to measure the diver's depth in the water at any time. This is done by measuring pressure of the air in the pneumo hose after a thin stream of bubbles has been emitted from the open end. The umbilical serves as a lifeline and must be capable of lifting the diver safely.|$|E

40|$|Humans {{are able}} to pump gas into a car {{with little or no}} difficulty. This task is {{characterized}} by two sources of force: that from the nozzle contacting the car and that from the hose attached to the pump. The task succeeds due to the appreciable skill of a human and a forgiveness in the connection. The robotic mating of connectors burdened by forces from sources like the <b>gas</b> <b>hose</b> is beyond the current state of art. The research presented in this dissertation develops technology for robots to mate connectors that concurrently experience appreciable forces from encumbrances, like those from hoses, cables and oscillating masses, in addition to forces from contact. Effective force guided assembly under the influence of these bias forces, requires the differentiation of contact forces from bias forces, a task that is impossible using traditional sensing configurations. Emulating the contribution of bias during contact allows the estimation of bias forces and, subsequently, contact forces. By measuring and modeling bias prior to contact, when the only forces on the connector are from bias, a model of th...|$|E

40|$|Interruption of the {{breathing}} gas to a ventilated anaesthetized patient due to accidental disconnection or anaesthesia system malfunction may have serious consequences if not detected quickly. A {{series of tests}} which covers the range of foreseeable mechanical problems was developed and {{used to test the}} performance of three breathing gas interruption monitors, two commercially available and one developed at Vancouver General Hospital. The tests were designed to evaluate the performance of monitors as installed on anaesthesia systems under a variety of failure conditions, including endotracheal tube disconnection with and without occlusion of the opening, kinks in the inspiratory and fresh gas hoses, disconnection of the fresh <b>gas</b> <b>hose,</b> leaks in {{the breathing}} circuit, excessive high or low pressure in the scavenging circuit, continuing high breathing circuit pressure, and kinks in the circuit pressure sensing hose.

25|$|Diving helmet squeeze: Helmet squeeze {{will occur}} if the <b>gas</b> supply <b>hose</b> is severed above the diver and the {{non-return}} valve at the helmet gas inlet fails {{or is not}} fitted. Severity {{will depend on the}} hydrostatic pressure difference. A very rapid descent, usually by accident, may exceed {{the rate at which the}} breathing gas supply can equalise the pressure causing a temporary squeeze. The introduction of the non-return valve and high maximum gas supply flow rates have all but eliminated both these risks. In helmets fitted with a neck dam, the dam will admit water into the helmet if the internal pressure gets too low; this is less of a problem than helmet squeeze but the diver may drown if the gas supply is not reinstated quickly. This form of barotrauma is avoidable by controlled descent rate, which is standard practice for commercial divers, who will use shotlines, diving stages and wet bells to control descent and ascent rates.|$|R
