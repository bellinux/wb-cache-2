5|$|As {{with the}} k-type section, the image {{impedance}} of the m-type low-pass section is purely real below the cut-off frequency and purely imaginary above it. From the chart <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>that</b> in the passband the closest impedance match to a constant pure resistance termination occurs at approximately m = 0.6.|$|E
5|$|In Iberia, {{the western}} Mediterranean and {{northwest}} Africa, the common starling may {{be confused with}} the closely related spotless starling, the plumage of which, as its name implies, has a more uniform colour. At close range <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>that</b> the latter has longer throat feathers, a fact particularly noticeable when it sings.|$|E
50|$|<b>It</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> as a tetrahedron, with edges {{divided into}} 3 segments, {{along with a}} center point of each {{triangular}} face. In Conway polyhedron notation <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> as gT, a gyro tetrahedron.|$|R
25|$|In {{northern}} locations above latitude 34ºN it {{is visible}} year-round {{and in the}} (sub)tropics <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> at its clearest from September to early November. Even in low southern latitudes below 25ºS <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> low in the North.|$|R

5|$|John Doggett confronts Rohrer {{about the}} tip he gave but Rohrer {{claims he was}} just trying to help Doggett learn the truth. As Doggett and Skinner leave, <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>that</b> Rohrer has strange {{protrusions}} at the back of his neck.|$|E
5|$|The {{first known}} case of orbital {{resonance}} in exoplanets {{has been noted}} between Kepler-9b and Kepler-9c. The two planets, whose orbits correspond in a roughly 1:2 ratio, maintain the orbit of the other by gravitational tug. Kepler-9b's orbit grows, on average, four minutes longer every orbital period. Eventually, this trend will reverse and increase. Over time, <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>that</b> the planets' orbits oscillate slightly {{above and below the}} 1:2 ratio. Alycia Weinberger of the Carnegie Institution has stated that the Kepler-9 gas giants probably formed further away from the star than they are, and the appearance of the orbital resonance phenomenon may help explain the history of their inward migration.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} {{resonators}} in the expression {{corresponds to the}} number of passbands required. Lowpass and highpass filters can be viewed as special cases of the resonator expression with {{one or the other of}} the terms becoming zero as appropriate. Bandstop filters can be regarded as a combination of a lowpass and a highpass filter. Multiple bandstop filters can always be expressed in terms of a multiple bandpass filter. In this way <b>it,</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>that</b> this transformation represents the general case for any bandform, and all the other transformations are to be viewed as special cases of it.|$|E
50|$|Despite {{the mast}} being {{shortened}} <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> in daylight on clear days from most areas close to {{and within the}} Lincolnshire Wolds. On clear nights its bright red aircraft warning lights <b>can</b> <b>be</b> very widely <b>seen</b> across much of Lincolnshire from {{as far north as}} the River Humber and Barton-Upon-Humber; from the west of the county <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> from Lincoln, Gainsborough and Grantham; from the south of the county <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> from Spalding and Bourne; and from the east <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> from Skegness, Mablethorpe and most areas along the Lincolnshire coast. The lights <b>can</b> also <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> from many parts of Nottinghamshire, coastal areas of North West Norfolk and even a few parts of Derbyshire on very clear nights.|$|R
5000|$|<b>It</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> as an {{equilateral}} hexagonal tiling {{with each}} hexagon divided into 12 triangles {{from the center}} point.

5|$|Given these {{properties}} of DNA damage and mutation, <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>that</b> DNA damage {{is a special}} problem in non-dividing or slowly-dividing cells, where unrepaired damage will tend to accumulate over time. On the other hand, in rapidly-dividing cells, unrepaired DNA damage that does not kill the cell by blocking replication will tend to cause replication errors and thus mutation. The great majority of mutations that are not neutral in their effect are deleterious to a cell's survival. Thus, in a population of cells composing a tissue with replicating cells, mutant cells will tend to be lost. However, infrequent mutations that provide a survival advantage will tend to clonally expand {{at the expense of}} neighboring cells in the tissue. This advantage to the cell is disadvantageous to the whole organism, because such mutant cells can give rise to cancer. Thus, DNA damage in frequently dividing cells, because it gives rise to mutations, is a prominent cause of cancer. In contrast, DNA damage in infrequently-dividing cells is likely a prominent cause of aging.|$|E
