500|$|Foster {{talked about}} Hannibal in an {{interview}} with Total Film in late 2005. She said: [...] "The official reason I didn't do Hannibal is I was doing another movie, Flora Plum. So I get to say, in a nice dignified way, that I wasn't available when that movie was being shot... Clarice meant so much to Jonathan and I, she really did, and <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> kind of strange to say {{but there was no way}} that either of us could really trample on her." ...|$|E
2500|$|Discussing [...] "The Night of the Doctor", McGann said, [...] " [...] instinctive {{take on the}} Eighth Doctor {{was exactly}} how I'd {{imagined}} this character to be, even way back, back in the 90s. You know, this... like a bruised nobility. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> wanky now, but... he's decent, but he's compromised. He's not a warrior, really, at all. There's a pacifist side to him, but he's a realist as well." ...|$|E

5000|$|One {{thing that}} we've learnt from touring {{over the last}} two years is that there are other ways to be {{powerful}} whilst making music, rather than being completely full on, 100 miles per hour.

6000|$|... "They {{killed him}} with the sash," [...] said Brown carefully; and then, as Flambeau protested: [...] "Yes, yes, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> about the bullet. Perhaps I ought to say he died of having a sash. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> doesn't <b>sound</b> like having a disease." ...|$|R

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> plausible, and {{is readily}} adopted {{by those who}} have little sympathy with the sufferings of others, to wish to jumble the {{innocent}} and guilty into one mass by a general indemnity. This cruel indifference dignifies itself with the name of humanity.|$|E
6000|$|The Keneu purred {{above his}} pipe {{like a large}} and very happy cat--"Don't blame you in the least. It's uncommonly good of you, {{and all the rest}} of it, but every man--even you, Torp--must {{consider}} his work. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> brutal, but Dick's out of the race,--down,--gastados expended, finished, done for.

5000|$|Though she {{was often}} a {{maternal}} figure, Karen {{was never able to}} become a grandmother on the serial. Lee said on her personal website, [...] "Yes. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> might <b>sound</b> like a big ego...far from it. It was a business option to prolong a career." ...|$|R

5000|$|Torroja - A {{parody of}} Konoha Village. [...] "Torroja" [...] is an {{abbreviation}} for [...] "toda" [...] and [...] "roja," [...] so the village name means [...] "all red." [...] The translator says [...] "it doesn't makes any sense, <b>I</b> <b>know...</b> <b>it</b> just <b>sounds</b> funny." [...] In Spanish [...] "ja" [...] is pronounced like the [...] "ha" [...] in Konoha. In addition, {{there is an}} actual Spanish town called Torroja.|$|R
6000|$|... "You don't {{know her}} as I do. She {{is a curious}} mixture. She's double-natured. You called her the philanthropist just now. Well, she would be one, if--if she could bear to part with money. Yes, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> ridiculous. But it's so. She is mean about money, but she {{honestly}} hates to hear of anybody treating poor people badly. If my stepfather were really the owner of those tenements, and she should find it out, she would have nothing {{more to do with}} him. It's true. I know her." ...|$|E
6000|$|The story {{went along}} very {{smoothly}} till the girl {{came to the}} second night in camp beside the lake; there her voice faltered, and the reflective look in the mother's eyes deepened as she learned that her daughter had shared her tent with the young man. [...] "It {{was the only thing}} to do, mother," [...] Berrie bravely said. [...] "It was cold and wet outside, and you know he isn't very strong, and his teeth were chattering, he was so chilled. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> strange down here; but up there in the woods in the storm what I did seemed right and natural.

6000|$|... "I {{wanted to}} come {{and tell you that}} I was sorry," [...] she {{continued}} softly, [...] "and I wanted, too, to remind you that you are still young, and that the loss of a fortune is not the most terrible thing in the world. I heard yesterday that you were out upon Salthouse Neck, close to the quicksands. You know it is never safe there, with these winter tides. Life is not a thing to be trifled with. It may seem terrible to you just now to have lost your great fortune, to be once more a poor man. These things, after all, don't count for much against the gift of life. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> like humbug to hear me talk like this, but they were gossiping about you in the village. One man was saying that he shouldn't be at all surprised to hear that you had disappeared, and to find--to find--" [...] she added, with a little shiver, [...] "your body come up the creek with the next tide. You wouldn't do anything like that, would you?" ...|$|E
500|$|The {{season finale}} {{received}} generally positive reviews from television critics. Entertainment Weekly columnist Abby West wrote that it [...] "was hands {{down one of}} the most satisfying hours of television I have ever had the pleasure of watching," [...] explaining that it created [...] "entirely new dynamics" [...] for the fourth season, hit [...] "all major beats," [...] and had [...] "real story progression" [...] and heart. Give Me My Remote writer Kath Skerry declared that the episode was [...] "brilliantly written, acted, and well paced. It was filled with twists and turns that I didn’t see coming. And <b>I</b> <b>know</b> that <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> cliche, and <b>I</b> <b>know</b> saying <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> cliche, sounds cliche. Maybe I’m being cliche but I don’t care. I am what I am – a full fledged Office addict who got exactly what she wanted, and in fact needed from the finale." [...] James Poniewozik of Time magazine voiced similar sentiments, believing the finale to be a [...] "good if not great season-ender, and if the conclusion didn't have the holy-crap factor of The Kiss last year, Pam’s closeup reaction to Jim’s return during her interview was–like everything Jenna Fischer does on this show–winning and sweet." [...] Poniewozik disliked how the season left Karen, calling it [...] "an uncharacteristic way to end this love triangle, which was distinguished by the writers’ refusal to make anyone the bad guy." ...|$|R
50|$|Tom Selleck later reflected:Jack Ramsay is {{not exactly}} a {{character}} whose name is on the tip of everybody’s tongue, but Runaway was a really great popcorn movie... It was very futuristic, it had robots and all sorts of stuff, and it was a nice movie. It was a good movie that I’m very proud of. It didn’t do very well, which was a great disappointment to Michael, who became a friend. And Gene Simmons was in it! Gene hadn’t been in a feature film before, but he was great. We had some great talks and good times... <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> plot <b>sounds</b> hokey, but with Michael Crichton at the helm, it was pretty good stuff.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Look here,' he said, 'I'll throw {{myself on}} your mercy. I admit {{the cat is}} your cat, and that I {{have no right to}} it, and that I am just a common sneak-thief. But consider. I had just come back from the first {{rehearsal}} of my first play; and as I walked in at the door that cat walked in at the window. I'm as superstitious as a coon, and I felt that to give him up would be equivalent to killing the play before ever <b>it</b> was produced. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> will <b>sound</b> absurd to you.

5000|$|Discussing [...] "The Night of the Doctor", McGann said, [...] "Moffat's instinctive {{take on the}} Eighth Doctor {{was exactly}} how I'd {{imagined}} this character to be, even way back, back in the 90s.

50|$|<b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> pretentious and unprepossessing: Theatre Genesis... {{dedicated}} to the new playwright But they have actually found a new playwright, and he has written a pair of provocative and genuinely original plays... Shepard is feeling his way, working with an intuitive approach to language and dramatic structure and moving into an area between ritual and naturalism, where character transcends psychology, fantasy breaks down literalism, and the patterns of ordinariness have their own lives. His is a gestalt theater which evokes the existence behind behavior (1964).|$|E
50|$|It's had effects {{around the}} margins, of course, {{but they have}} mostly been minor. When I wrote it, I really thought the book would change the world. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> a little grand now, {{but at the time}} the sixties still existed for us. It looked as if real changes were possible, and I let myself believe that this would be one of them. All {{you have to do is}} walk around the corner to McDonald's to see how {{successful}} I have been.|$|E
6000|$|But {{for my part}} when I {{heard of}} the Cambridge vote, I felt as Lord Chatham did when he said in parliament, [...] "Sir, I rejoice that America has resisted." [...] For I have long harboured views of my own upon the higher {{education}} of women. In these days, however, it requires no little hardihood to utter a single word of criticism against it. It is like throwing half a brick through the glass roof of a conservatory. It is bound to make trouble. Let me hasten, therefore, to say that I believe most heartily in the higher education of women; in fact, the higher the better. The only question to my mind is: What is [...] "higher education" [...] {{and how do you}} get it? With which goes the secondary enquiry, What is a woman and is she just the same as a man? <b>I</b> <b>know</b> that <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> a terrible thing to say in these days, but I don't believe she is.|$|R
6000|$|... 'She {{wants the}} advertisement, of course. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> doesn't <b>sound</b> sensational--a lost monkey; but when it's a celebrity's lost monkey {{it makes a}} difference. Suppose King George had lost a monkey; wouldn't your London {{newspapers}} give it {{a good deal of}} space? Especially if it had thrown eggs at one of the ladies and bitten the Duke of Norfolk in the leg? That's what our visitor has been doing apparently. At least, he threw eggs at the scullery-maid and bit a millionaire. It's practically the same thing. At any rate, there it is. The newspaper men are here, and they seem to regard this farm as their centre of operations. I had the greatest difficulty in inducing them to go home to their well-earned dinners. They wanted to camp out on the place. As it is, there may still be some of them round, hiding in the grass with notebooks, and telling one another in whispers that they were the men who really solved the murder mystery. What shall we do?' ...|$|R
40|$|When {{she went}} home, she ate {{leftover}} spaghetti {{and watched a}} game show, in which celebrity contestants were given a series of challenges. One of them was called “One-Wording. ” Never mind {{the details of the}} game, which Ellie paid no attention to. It was the name that set something off in her, like a trigger. “Out of nowhere,” Ellie later said, “I thought of the word Vonwürdig. <b>I</b> don’t <b>know</b> why. <b>It</b> <b>sounded</b> German, or <b>it</b> looked German in my head. ” Ellie did what anyone would do. She googled “Vonwürdig. The first result was an automated translation. The word meant “door-worthy. ” It was nonsense. The next result was a message board...|$|R
5000|$|In my work, conceptually I’ve been {{interested}} in exploring the stereotypes of inscrutability or invisibility and being open to looking at what the potential in that stereotype might be. Asians {{are perceived to be}} inscrutable or invisible or voiceless or one of the masses, and I’ll flip it and decide to explore that stereotype and begin to see people who are extroverted and space-taking as actually lacking the ability or potential to be invisible. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> like I like the stealth ninja, but I won’t immediately accept certain qualities as a weakness." ...|$|E
5000|$|... It was like, `Do {{you want}} a job?’ It didn’t matter what the pitch was. I had to get {{something}} because I was doing nothing. It sounded all right to me. I initially read for the role that Colin (Hanks) got. Then they called me back for the role that I ended up getting. … <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> kind of funny. OK, they’re aliens and they’re walking among us and they’re in high school. My good friends are always picking on me about it."

5000|$|Cuoco {{received}} significant {{media attention}} surrounding controversial remarks made {{in an interview}} with Redbook magazine. When asked if she considered herself a feminist, Cuoco responded: [...] "Is it bad if I say no? I was never that feminist girl demanding equality, but maybe that's because I've never really faced inequality…I cook for Ryan five nights a week: it makes me feel like a housewife. I love that. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> old-fashioned, but I like the idea of women taking care of their men". In subsequent interviews, Cuoco has apologized for and retracted these statements, telling Cosmopolitan magazine, [...] "of course I'm a fucking feminist. Look at me. I bleed feminism." ...|$|E
5000|$|Later in 1986, Lea {{recalled}} of the song's airplay: [...] ""Do You Believe in Miracles" [...] {{was played}} {{to death on}} the beeb. I really believed in that record. I didn't like the <b>sound</b> of <b>it</b> on the radio though. I tried to combat that in my own way, but we'd reached the fourth mix of that single and by then I think everybody was past doing another mix. I was happy with the first mix because <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> would have <b>sounded</b> good on the radio." [...] Drummer Don Powell said: [...] "It didn't do too well chartwise, but it had every radio play in the book really. I could never turn the radio on without hearing it played. We did quite a few T.V. shows to promote it - but when we recorded them, when the record first came out - all the T.V. shows centred around Christmas, so we missed out on the initial thing. If we'd have had those T.V.'s when the record was actually released, that would have helped a lot more. The radio play was incredible though, even Alan James, our plugger couldn't understand it." ...|$|R

5000|$|In an {{interview}} on Nice Kicks with Ian Stonebook, Peterson described his own personal style he calls, Swavey: [...] "Swavey is a two-adjective word. A lot of people {{use it as an}} attribute, but the real definition of swavey is a genre of music. The genre of music is the genre of fusing more than one together. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> strange, but if you ask an artist what they do they're going to say that they rap, they sing, they do rock-a lot of people are multi-talented. They get looked at confused, but I don't think that they're confused. I feel that they're just talented, swavey artists. Labels want to put you in one lane, but I feel like {{there are so many people}} are more than that and they're swavey artists." ...|$|E
5000|$|In {{terms of}} the actual meaning behind the song, Ferguson told Blues & Soul: [...] "It's {{basically}} talking about how we get so concerned about stuff like money and cars that it overtakes our lives and we forget what's really important is FAMILY. I mean, I actually remember the day I wrote it with Eg White. Something had upset me, and I was like 'You know, people just forget what's important'... And then I literally just said 'It's not your money, it's not your car - it's LOVE!' - and straightaway we were both like 'Oh, we've got a SONG here!'!... And, while <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> cheesy, I genuinely do think those sentiments are TRUE! Plus, I was standing in line and wondering why it don't move" ...|$|E
