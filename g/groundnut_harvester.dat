40|$|The {{performance}} {{of an existing}} tractor mounted <b>groundnut</b> <b>harvester</b> was evaluated {{at different levels of}} machine speed (2 km/hr, 3 km/hr, 4 km/hr and 5 km/hr) and a constant penetration depth of 10 cm. Harvesting efficiency decreased with increasing speed while percentage damage increased with increasing speed. The highest harvesting efficiency (75. 3 %) was obtained for 2 km/hr operation speed and the lowest harvesting efficiency (63. 7 %) was obtained at 5 km/hr operation speed. The highest percentage damage (34. 2 %) was obtained at 5 km/hr machine speed and the least percentage damage (17. 1 %) was obtained at 2 km/hr speed. Analysis of variance showed that machine speed made significant effects (p≤ 0. 05) on the parameters evaluated and the separation of means using F-LSD showed significant difference at. ≤ 0. 0...|$|E
