50|$|The {{best way}} to control Helminthosporium {{diseases}} is through an integrated approach.

In addition, appropriate management practices that enhance the health of the plant populations, in general, are critical.

Economic feasibility of recommended practices has to be determined as part of the research. Options for controlling tan spot and spot blotch include disease-free seed, seed treatment with fungicides, proper crop rotation and fertilization, cultural practices in order to reduce inoculum sources, the use of chemicals and the research of disease resistance.

It has been seen that it is the most repetitive fungal genome sequenced with 90% transposable elements. Additionally, 6540 genes were annotated, from which 437 encoded candidate secretor proteins and 165 for non-secreted candidate secretor proteins. These were shown to be subject to positive selection, due to their implication in the gene-for-gene relationship to defeat plant disease resistance. The ability to infect tetraploid as well as domesticated <b>hexaploid</b> <b>wheat,</b> was seen {{to be the result of}} mildew genomes being mosaics of ancient haplogroups that existed before wheat domestication.

50|$|Wheat gluten {{proteins}} {{consist of}} two major fractions: the gliadins and the glutenins. Gliadins are monomeric proteins, which can be separated into four groups: alpha-, beta-, gamma- and omega-gliadins. Glutenins occur as multimeric aggregates of high-molecular-mass and low-molecular-mass subunits held together by disulfide bonds. In wheat, omega- and gamma-gliadins are encoded by genes at the Gli-1 loci located on the short arms of group-1 chromosomes, while alpha- and beta-gliadin-encoding genes are located on the short arms of group-6 chromosomes. LMW glutenins are encoded by genes at the Glu-3 loci that are {{closely linked to the}} Gli-1 loci. HMW glutenins are encoded by genes at the Glu-1 loci found on the long arms of group-1 chromosomes. Each Glu-1 locus consists of two tightly linked genes encoding one x-type and one y-type HMW glutenin, with polymorphism giving rise to a number of different alleles at each locus. The y-type genes at the Glu-A1 locus are not expressed in <b>hexaploid</b> <b>wheat.</b> Due to the very close linkage between the x- and y-type genes, HMW glutenins are classified into alleles according to the x- and y-type subunits expressed.|$|E

Despite its high protein content, durum is not a strong wheat in the sense of giving strength to dough through the formation of a gluten network.

40|$|It {{has been}} shown {{previously}} that under drought, synthetic <b>hexaploid</b> derived <b>wheat</b> (Triticum aestivum L.) lines outperformed recurrent parents {{in part due to}} increased root mass at depth and better water extraction capacity. A group of four elite synthetic derived (SYN-DER) lines and parents was grown under full irrigation and drought conditions to dissect some of the physiological features conferring tolerance to drought. Synthetic derived wheat lines showed on average a 26 % yield increase as compared to the parental <b>hexaploid</b> <b>wheats</b> under terminal drought. Different strategies for drought tolerance were observed, including earliness to flowering, greater root mass at depth, greater water extraction capacity, and increased water use efficiency (WUE) at anthesis. Some degree of independence was identified between these traits when comparing SYN-DER lines suggesting that these traits are regulated by different genes. The elite SYN-DER line Vorobey was an important source of improved root mass at depth under drought.

40|$|<b>Hexaploid</b> <b>wheat</b> (Triticum aestivum) accumulates benzoxazinones (Bxs) as {{defensive}} compounds. Previously, {{we found}} that five Bx biosynthetic genes, TaBx 1 -TaBx 5, are located {{on each of the}} three genomes (A, B, and D) of <b>hexaploid</b> <b>wheat.</b> In this study, we isolated three homoeologous cDNAs of each TaBx gene to estimate the contribution of individual homoeologous TaBx genes to the biosynthesis of Bxs in <b>hexaploid</b> <b>wheat.</b> We analyzed their transcript levels by homoeolog- or genome-specific quantitative RT-PCR and the catalytic properties of their translation products by kinetic analyses using recombinant TaBX enzymes. The three homoeologs were transcribed differentially, and the ratio of the individual homoeologous transcripts to total homoeologous transcripts also varied with the tissue, i. e., shoots or roots, {{as well as with the}} developmental stage. Moreover, the translation products of the three homoeologs had different catalytic properties. Some TaBx homoeologs were efficiently transcribed, but the translation products showed only weak enzymatic activities, which inferred their weak contribution to Bx biosynthesis. Considering the transcript levels and the catalytic properties collectively, we concluded that the homoeologs on the B genome generally contributed the most to the Bx biosynthesis in <b>hexaploid</b> <b>wheat,</b> especially in shoots. In tetraploid wheat and the three diploid progenitors of <b>hexaploid</b> <b>wheat,</b> the respective transcript levels of the TaBx homoeologs were similar in ratio to those observed in <b>hexaploid</b> <b>wheat.</b> This result indicates that the genomic bias in the transcription of the TaBx genes in <b>hexaploid</b> <b>wheat</b> originated in the diploid progenitors and has been retained through the polyploidization...|$|E
40|$|To study genome {{evolution}} in allopolyploid plants, we analyzed polyploid wheats and their diploid progenitors for {{the occurrence of}} 16 low-copy chromosome- or genome-specific sequences isolated from <b>hexaploid</b> <b>wheat.</b> Based on their occurrence in the diploid species, we classified the sequences into two groups: group I, found in {{only one of the}} three diploid progenitors of <b>hexaploid</b> <b>wheat,</b> and group II, found in all three diploid progenitors. The absence of group II sequences from one genome of tetraploid wheat and from two genomes of <b>hexaploid</b> <b>wheat</b> indicates their specific elimination from these genomes at the polyploid level.

40|$|ABSTRACT Though allohexaploid {{bread wheat}} (Triticum aestivum) is grown on more acreage {{than any other}} cereal crop, its {{evolutionary}} history and origin of its three genomes have not been cleared up in every detail. The wheats form a polyploid series with diploid, tetraploid and <b>hexaploid</b> forms. <b>Hexaploid</b> <b>wheats</b> (AABBDD) may have evolved by hybridization between the AABB tetraploid as cytoplasm donor and the D genome diploid Aegilops tauschii. The origin of B genome is still a matter of debate. In the present study sequences of chloroplast and nuclear rDNA regions were used for giving new data to contribute to our knowledge on evolution of wheat. Analysis of cloned nrITS sequences of T. aestivum showed that 1) more than one ITS sequence type {{can be derived from}} the same sample, 2) a rye chromosome element formerly introgressed into wheat genome can be detected and 3) a partial segment of ITS similar to that of einkorn wheats (AA genome) can be identified.
