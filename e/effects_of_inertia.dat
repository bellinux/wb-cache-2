The phugoid oscillation is really a slow interchange of kinetic energy (velocity) and potential energy (height) about some equilibrium energy level as the aircraft attempts to re-establish the equilibrium level-flight condition from which it had been disturbed. The motion is so slow that the <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>inertia</b> forces and damping forces are very low.

50|$|Prior to 1917 {{there were}} {{available}} {{several types of}} instruments for measuring and recording pressures internal combustion engine cylinders. Some of these were refinements of the conventional pressure indicator designed for low-speed steam engines while others were designed primarily for high-speed work {{with a view of}} minimizing the <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>inertia.</b> These instruments were found to be useful for various classes of work, depending on theirdesign and characteristics, although none of them had found more than very limited application in a comparatively few laboratories. Some of the inherent difficulties which have prevented the development of a wholly convenient and successful high-speed indicator are inertia, friction, and backlash in moving parts where mechanical means of recording are adopted; inertia and vibration of the system when a photographic method of magnification is applied to an instrument mounted on the engine; time lag of the gases in the connecting tube where a photographic apparatus is mounted independently of the engine and connects to it by a flexible tube; as well as the usual mechanical difficulties in the construction and operation of instruments of this class. It is noted that these difficulties are increased {{in the case of the}} aircraft engine, which usually must be mounted on a more or less flexible stand and in which at best the mechanical vibrations of the parts are excessive, due to their light weight and lack ofrigidity. An important mechanical consequence of this excessive flexibility of the engine structure seems to have been overlooked, since it has not been discussed in the literature or taken account of other than accidentally in design of any indicator. To illustrate this effect, assume an indicator whose moving parts are mounted on the head of an engine cyIinder. In order to reduce the effect of inertia, the range of motion of the piston or diaphragm is reduced as much as practicable and the motion magnified either mechanically or optically so as to give a readable scale. It should be noted that the motion actually recorded is always the relative motion between the movable part of the indicator and the (supposeclIy) fixed partmounted rigidly on the cylinder head. But if the cylinder head itself flexes under pressure or mechanical vibration, this motion of the fixed support relative to the movable piston is recorded and magnified as well as the motion of the piston relative to its support. Hence it may happen that thus limiting the range of motion of the piston or heavy diaphragm and greatly magnifying the record, increases the bad <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>inertia.</b> on a light flexible engine cylinder since the motions of the cylinder head itself, relative to the moving member, are subject to the same degree of magnification.|$|E
5000|$|Inductor : A heavy {{paddle wheel}} {{placed in the}} current. The mass of the wheel {{and the size of}} the blades {{restrict}} the water's ability to rapidly change its rate of flow (current) through the wheel due to the <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>inertia,</b> but, given time, a constant flowing stream will pass mostly unimpeded through the wheel, as it turns at the same speed as the water flow. The mass and surface area of the wheel and its blades are analogous to inductance, and friction between its axle and the axle bearings corresponds to the resistance that accompanies any non-superconducting inductor.An alternative inductor model is simply a long pipe, perhaps coiled into a spiral for convenience. This fluid-inertia device is used in real life as an essential component of a hydraulic ram. The inertia of the water flowing through the pipe produces the inductance effect; inductors [...] "filter out" [...] rapid changes in flow, while allowing slow variations in current to be passed through. The drag imposed by the walls of the pipe is somewhat analogous to parasitic resistance. In either model, the pressure difference (voltage) across the device must be present before the current will start moving, thus in inductors voltage [...] "leads" [...] current. As the current increases, approaching the limits imposed by its own internal friction and of the current that the rest of the circuit can provide, the pressure drop across the device becomes lower and lower.|$|E

This cause will now be ascribed to a background elasticity that is rooted in electrostatics.

Systems inertia represents the phenomenon of continuing work for some time after the breakdown {{of one of the}} former phases. In our considerations, inertia is treated as the time elapsed from the onset of breakdown till the system's inability to work. A special method had to be devised to investigate the <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>inertia</b> in order to evaluate the reliability of production systems and to attempt algorithmization to control the reliability of production system by means <b>of</b> <b>inertia</b> or reserving. The method of reliability analysis is presented only in an inform aspect. The possibilities of increasing reliability of production systems are listed. A comparison of the redundancy method and inertia method is presented. The results of this comparison and simulated investigations <b>of</b> influence <b>of</b> <b>inertia</b> on reliability <b>of</b> system are essential scope of the paper. Selected conclusions are as follows: when inertia approaches the last phase in the system, its influence on the shape of the distribution of the system's ability increases; an increase in inertia causes an increase in the availability of the system which approaches a certain border value; dependence of the average of a system's disability on inertia has a saddle-like character whereas dependence of the number of breakdowns (stoppages) in the system has the nature of an S-curve...|$|R
