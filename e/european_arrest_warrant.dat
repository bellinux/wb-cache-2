According to Lette, [...] "Julian and The Simpsons {{producers}} asked me to rewrite his scene and dialogue. I guess they just wanted me to add a little Aussie irony to the script. Julian does not suffer from an irony deficiency! I used to write a sitcom for Columbia Pictures, the long-running series The Facts of Life, so the producers knew I could fire off a quip or two." [...] In 2010, Swedish authorities issued a <b>European</b> <b>Arrest</b> <b>Warrant</b> to extradite Assange from Britain to Sweden for questioning in relation to sexual assault allegations made against him there.

Assange recorded his lines over the phone while under house arrest in England. Jean, who directed Assange's performance from Los Angeles, only acquired a phone number to call and received no information about the whereabouts of the activist. According to Jean in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, The Simpsons creator Matt Groening had found out through a rumor that Assange wanted to appear on the show. Casting director Bonnie Pietila was therefore given the task to contact Assange and make sure the guest appearance could happen. The episode features no reference to Assange's legal situation at the time of his recording. Jean commented that he is [...] "a controversial figure, and there's a good reason he's controversial. There was discussion internally whether or not to have him on the show, but ultimately we went ahead and did it."

Spanish prosecutors sought a <b>European</b> <b>Arrest</b> <b>Warrant</b> for Puigdemont and four other members who had remained in Belgium and refused to attend the hearing. The EAW demanding Puigdemont and his allies' arrest was officially issued to Belgium the next day, on 3 November, which Belgium said they would [...] "study" [...] before making any decisions.

Puigdemont declared from an undisclosed location in Belgium that he regarded the detentions as [...] "an act that breaks with the basic principles of democracy". In contrast, a separate case against other Catalan lawmakers was adjourned by the Supreme Court (...) after all six of them, including Catalan parliament speaker Carme Forcadell, showed up to the summons. Puigdemont and the four other cabinet members turned themselves in to Belgian authorities on 5 November, awaiting a decision by the federal prosecutor on whether to hand them over to Spain or decline the warrant.

40|$|Due to a {{very high}} number of Polish {{nationals}} residing in the United Kingdom (UK), {{almost half of the}} <b>European</b> <b>Arrest</b> <b>Warrants</b> (“EAW”) issued in Poland over recent years have been executed in the UK.

One of many possible repercussions of Brexit – replacement of the EAW with a “traditional” extradition procedure – may result in substantial slowing down of the extradition and making the procedure much more expensive.
