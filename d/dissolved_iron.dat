25|$|Banded iron {{formations}} (BIF) are {{sedimentary rocks}} of layered iron oxide and iron-poor chert. In {{the presence of}} oxygen, iron naturally rusts and becomes insoluble in water. The banded iron formations are commonly very old and their deposition is often related to the oxidation of the Earth's atmosphere during the Palaeoproterozoic era, when <b>dissolved</b> <b>iron</b> in the ocean {{came in contact with}} photosynthetically produced oxygen and precipitated out as iron oxide.|$|E
25|$|Banded iron {{formations}} {{have been}} taken as unavoidable evidence for global ice cover, since they require <b>dissolved</b> <b>iron</b> ions and anoxic waters to form; however, the limited extent of the Neoproterozoic banded iron deposits means {{that they may not}} have formed in frozen oceans, but instead in inland seas. Such seas can experience a wide range of chemistries; high rates of evaporation could concentrate iron ions, and a periodic lack of circulation could allow anoxic bottom water to form.|$|E

25|$|For such iron-rich {{rocks to}} be {{deposited}} {{there would have}} to be anoxia in the ocean, so that much <b>dissolved</b> <b>iron</b> (as ferrous oxide) could accumulate before it met an oxidant that would precipitate it as ferric oxide. For the ocean to become anoxic it must have limited gas exchange with the oxygenated atmosphere. Proponents of the hypothesis argue that the reappearance of BIF in the sedimentary record is a result of limited oxygen levels in an ocean sealed by sea-ice, while opponents suggest that the rarity of the BIF deposits may indicate that they formed in inland seas.|$|E
25|$|The natural arsenic {{pollution}} {{occurs because}} aquifer sediments contain organic matter that generates anaerobic {{conditions in the}} aquifer. These conditions result in the microbial dissolution of iron oxides in the sediment and, thus, {{the release of the}} arsenic, normally strongly bound to iron oxides, into the water. As a consequence, arsenic-rich groundwater is often iron-rich, although secondary processes often obscure the association of dissolved arsenic and <b>dissolved</b> <b>iron..</b> Arsenic is found in groundwater most commonly as the reduced species arsenite and the oxidized species arsenate, being the acute toxicity of arsenite somewhat greater than that of arsenate. Investigations by WHO indicated that 20% of 25,000 boreholes tested in Bangladesh had arsenic concentrations exceeding 50 μg/l.|$|E

50|$|Rust, {{a mixture}} of ferric {{hydroxide}} compounds, illustrates the low solubility of ferric ions in water. Various reagents cause rust to dissolve even at neutral pH. These ligands include EDTA, which forms a chelate complex with the ion, displacing the hydroxide and oxide ligands that comprise rust.

500|$|The Tor {{is formed}} from rocks {{dating from the}} early Jurassic Period, namely varied layers of Lias Group strata. The {{uppermost}} of these, forming the Tor itself, are a succession of rocks assigned to the Bridport Sand Formation. These rocks sit upon strata forming the broader hill on which the Tor stands; the various layers of the Beacon Limestone Formation and the Dyrham Formation. The Bridport Sands have acted as a caprock protecting the lower layers from erosion. The iron-rich waters of Chalice Well, a spring {{at the base of}} the Tor, flow out as an artesian well impregnating the sandstone around it with iron oxides that have reinforced it to produce the caprock.

2500|$|Enough oxygen had {{accumulated}} in seawater so that <b>dissolved</b> <b>iron</b> [...] which had earlier eroded {{from the surrounding}} land [...] was oxidized. Oxygenated water has low levels of <b>dissolved</b> <b>iron</b> because iron reacts with oxygen to form compounds that precipitate out; the compounds include hematite (Fe2O3), limonite (Fe2O3·2H2O) and siderite (FeCO3). These iron compounds precipitated from the sea water in varying proportions with chert, producing banded-iron formations. Banded-iron formations occur in several ranges around the margins of this basin, five of which contained sufficient concentrations of iron to be economically mined. These banded-iron formations {{have been one of}} the world’s greatest sources of iron ore since mining began in the area during the late 19th century. Major iron formations in different parts of the basin represent either nearly contemporaneous shelf sedimentation on either side of the main basin, or deposits formed simultaneously in isolated sub-basins of the main basin.|$|E

Excessive use of nitre will corrode the smelting pot, increasing both maintenance costs and the risk of catastrophic leaks (known as run-aways, or holes in the pot through which the molten charge is lost).

50|$|In {{order to}} make this armor - which {{originally}} was gun-metal grey, like the original - less frightening to the general public, Stark created a gold-colored version with {{a wide array of}} improvements over the original. The new armor used the three dimensional, collapsible micro-structure now common in Stark's suits, so that it could be folded up and stored in his briefcase while inactive. The chest-plate was streamlined so that it could be worn under normal clothing without being noticeable. The suit had a semi-rigid interior with 3D knitted metallic exterior of a lightweight iron alloy, providing the same protection as his old suit did. This was also the first suit to be equipped with a force field generator. Power was still provided by flat linear armature DC motors, rechargeable by solar power as well as electrical outlets, and motion sensing was still provided by negative feedback. The Mk II air pressure boot-jets provided limited flight; steering while flying was accomplished by bodily movement. Weaponry consisted of the chest-mounted Mk II Monobeam (usable as either a concussive force beam or a heat beam), a sledgehammer, hacksaws extending from the fingertips, hand drills, electromagnets allowing him to pull things to him and push them away, and an electrical field generator. Communications and sensor arrays consisted of a loudspeaker, short-wave two-way radio, radar, and a tape recorder. When one iteration of this particular armor was partially destroyed by the Melter, a super-villain who could <b>dissolve</b> <b>iron</b> and iron alloys with a special ray, Stark built an exact copy using aluminium instead of iron, which was unaffected by the Melter's ability to <b>dissolve</b> <b>iron.</b>|$|R

2500|$|Banded-iron {{formations}} are iron formations which formed about 2,000 {{million years}} ago and were first described in the Lake Superior region. Sediments associated with the last stage of the Great Lakes tectonic zone contain banded-iron formations.

2500|$|Scientists {{start the}} search for fossil {{evidence}} of plants with indirect evidence for their presence, the evidence of photosynthesis in the geological record. [...] The evidence for photosynthesis in the rock record is varied, but primary evidence comes from around 3000 Ma, in rock records and fossil evidence of cyanobacteria, photosynthesizing prokaryotic organisms. [...] Cyanobacteria use water as a reducing agent, producing atmospheric oxygen as a byproduct, and they thereby profoundly changed the early reducing atmosphere of the earth to one in which modern aerobic organisms eventually evolved. [...] This oxygen liberated by cyanobacteria then oxidized <b>dissolved</b> <b>iron</b> in the oceans, the iron precipitated {{out of the sea}} water, and fell to the ocean floor to form sedimentary layers of oxidized iron called Banded Iron Formations (BIFs). [...] These BIFs are part of the geological record of evidence for the evolutionary history of plants by identifying when photosynthesis originated. [...] This also provides deep time constraints upon when enough oxygen could have been available in the atmosphere to produce the ultraviolet blocking stratospheric ozone layer. [...] The oxygen concentration in the ancient atmosphere subsequently rose, acting as a poison for anaerobic organisms, and resulting in a highly oxidizing atmosphere, and opening up niches on land for occupation by aerobic organisms.|$|E
