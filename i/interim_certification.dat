The EAC implemented an <b>interim</b> <b>certification</b> program in July 2006 which provided {{a means to}} obtain federal certification for modifications required by state and local election officials administering the 2006 General Election.|$|E

Mr. Robert Thompson gave the Administration and Finance Committee report. Highlights: (1) Budget comparisons displayed revenues and expenses from fiscal year 2003 - 04 budget compared to previous year's budget; (2) up to date pledge projections, and campaign goals; and (3) The audit report prepared by Deloitte & Touche, approved by the Committee for presentation to the Board. The Board unanimously approved the auditors' report for Fiscal 2003. Dr. May reported that {{the results from the}} NCAA <b>Interim</b> <b>Certification</b> have been received, and the Certificate was reaffirmed...|$|E

The significant role in the educational system is {{the development and implementation of}} virtual labs. For the development of the contemporary science section as bioinformatics, it is necessary to extend the possibility of using computers for processing the information received with the use of modern devices. These research methods include atomic force microscopy. For Students of the specialty 06. 05. 01 "Bioengineering and Bioinformatics" in the SD "Basics of Nanobiotechnology" it has been developed a virtual laboratory work on "Processing of nanostructured images of biomolecules. " The basis for the development of laboratory work was the handbook modified for affordable performance. Laboratory workshop allows you to briefly find out the theory of atomic force microscopy, the organization and the principle of operation of the device. It allows Students to quickly learn the using the program at the AFM image processing Nova 1. 0. 26. 1443. In the laboratory work for the tasks solution the biological objects are selected from the images catalog, and to study and describe of these objects the software is used. Students work with images of biomolecules in the program: change them (increasing, selection of separate areas, evaluate the geometrical parameters, work with 3 D-image), writing a description and compare objects with each other. The results are summarized in a table and conclusion. The effectiveness and usefulness of the created laboratory work are proved by the results of Student’s survey and tested in the final and <b>interim</b> <b>certification.</b> This kind of work is suitable for distance learning, to provide a laboratory practicum in SD "Nanotechnology", "Modern methods of analysis" for other specialties as an educational and methodological materials...|$|E

5000|$|Barrett's primary {{accomplishment}} {{in office}} was to reform Manitoba's labour laws, reversing {{many of the}} decisions made by the right-wing government of Gary Filmon during the 1990s. Her reform legislation, introduced in July 2000, made union certification automatic if 65% of employees sign membership cards, allowed <b>interim</b> <b>certifications,</b> ensured that employees would not be fired for convictions involving minor offenses, and gave employees the exclusive right to approve or reject arbitration if a labour dispute dragged on more than sixty days. [...] Barrett argued that the changes were necessary to correct a decade of imbalance under the previous government. [...] The bill was met with intense opposition from the business community and, in response to criticism, Barrett changed the bill to give either party in a labour dispute the right to call for binding arbitration after sixty days. [...] Barrett also allowed parents to take more time off work {{after the birth of}} their children, and increased Manitoba's minimum wage by 25 cents for every year of her tenure in office.|$|R

Infrastructure and <b>interim</b> procedures and <b>certification</b> processes would be developed {{in conjunction with the}} respective Alaskan Region Divisions responsible for them. Equipage of evaluation aircraft would be voluntary with the Capstone program absorbing the cost of equipping and certifying. Capstone built an infrastructure consistent with the FFOEP, thereby enabling further procedure development and evaluation leading toward overall modernization.|$|R
40|$|Beginning {{teachers}} {{struggle with}} classroom management, which is especially problematic for urban {{schools and other}} low-achieving, high-poverty environments that employ {{a disproportionate number of}} beginning teachers. These teachers tend to enter classrooms unprepared to deal with student misbehavior and tend not to receive adequate support to improve over time. In order to develop beginning teachers as effective classroom managers prior to and within their full-time placement, more needs to be learned about how beginning teachers manage their urban classrooms. This descriptive, mixed method study of one <b>interim</b> <b>certification</b> program explores first year urban teachers’ classroom management experience. I investigate how teachers conceptualize classroom management, what actions they implement to manage the classroom, and who or what they report as helping them to develop in classroom management. Programmatic surveys of 87 first year teachers provide broad trends of teachers’ beliefs, actions, and influences, while interviews, field visits, video recordings, and journals detail five case participants’ experiences throughout the year. Case study analyses indicate that teachers differed in {{the degree to which they}} emphasized relational dimensions of classroom management. Relatedly, teachers who reported relational beliefs on their program surveys received higher evaluation ratings as compared to teachers who did not report relational beliefs. This study also indicates that teachers felt they improved most as classroom managers when school and program personnel provided them with specific and timely feedback about alternative methods to manage classrooms, and when they learned from their mistakes during clinical and classroom experience. These findings have implications for teacher preparation and professional development on how to support teachers in managing classrooms. Findings suggest designing teacher education to emphasize a relational approach to classroom management that underscores the importance of establishing a safe environment and using strategies to promote positive interactions in the classroom. These findings also suggest improving how we prepare classroom managers by increasing the frequency that teacher educators observe new teachers and by offering feedback that is more targeted and presents alternative methods of managing classrooms...|$|E
50|$|The {{professional}} qualifications of archivists {{became an issue}} in the 1950s, when the Society of American Archivists (SAA) and the American Historical Association made the case that the archivist of the United States should be a professional, not political, appointee. The 1970s saw much internal SAA discussion of education and professional development, but few colleges and universities were interested in program accreditation. By the mid-1980s, it became clear that individual certification was the viable option. In 1987, SAA established an <b>Interim</b> Board for <b>Certification</b> (IBC) to set standards for professional certification and the exam to be administered. It also evaluated practicing archivists' petitions for certification. In 1989, one hundred such petitions were approved and the Academy of Certified Archivists (ACA) was created.|$|R
