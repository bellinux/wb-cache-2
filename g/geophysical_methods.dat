25|$|Geologists use {{a number}} of field, laboratory, and {{numerical}} modeling methods to decipher Earth history and to understand the processes that occur on and inside the Earth. In typical geological investigations, geologists use primary information related to petrology (the study of rocks), stratigraphy (the study of sedimentary layers), and structural geology (the study of positions of rock units and their deformation). In many cases, geologists also study modern soils, rivers, landscapes, and glaciers; investigate past and current life and biogeochemical pathways, and use <b>geophysical</b> <b>methods</b> to investigate the subsurface.

40|$|Thermal anomaly before {{earthquake}} {{was widely}} studied with satellite data such as NOAA/AVHRR and MODIS.

Here we introduced NCEP Reanalysis data which was widely used in atmosphere research area, and found the thermal anomalies before earthquakes.

2500|$|According to the Alvarez hypothesis, {{the mass}} {{extinction}} {{of the dinosaurs}} at {{the transition from the}} Cretaceous to the Paleogene Period, the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary (K–T boundary), 65 million years ago was caused by an asteroid impact somewhere in the greater Caribbean Basin. The deeply buried Chicxulub crater is centered off the north coast of the peninsula near the town of Chicxulub. The now-famous [...] "Ring of Cenotes" [...] (visible in NASA imagery) outlines one of the shock-waves from this impact event in the rock of ~66 million years of age, which lies more than 1km below the modern ground surface near the centre, with the rock above the impact strata all being younger in age.

2500|$|A locally notable {{feature that}} crosses {{the zone of}} the OWL is the west-east Seattle Fault. [...] This is not a strike-slip fault, but a thrust fault, where a {{relatively}} shallow slab of rock from the south is being pushed against and over the northern part. (And over the OWL.) One model has the slab of rock being forced up by some structure about 8nbsp&km deep. [...] Another model has {{the base of the}} slab (again, about 8nbsp&km deep) catching on something, which causes the leading edge to roll. The nature of the underlying structure is not known; geophysical data does not indicate a major fault nor any kind of crustal boundary along the front of the Seattle Fault, nor along the OWL, but this could be due to the limited reach of <b>geophysical</b> <b>methods.</b> [...] Recent geological mapping at {{the eastern side of the}} Seattle Fault suggests a decollement (horizontal plane) about 18nbsp&km deep.|$|E

40|$|There {{have been}} {{improvement}} in the subsurface investigation using non-destructive <b>geophysical</b> <b>method.</b> These were supported by improvement in data inversion method for 2 -D resistivity imaging <b>method.</b> This <b>geophysical</b> <b>method</b> {{have been used for}} many environmental and engineering studies, such as slope monitoring, cavities detection, buried man-made structures and so on. This paper present the 2 -D data inversion in electrical resistivity method which was carried out in Penang, Malaysia. This non-destructive method is used to image the subsurface for soil’s lithology purpose. In addition, two inline boreholes were used to validate and verify the obtained results of electrical resistivity imaging. Based on the electrical resistivity imaging, the subsurface is made up of four type of materials. They are sandy silt, silty sand, sand and lastly weathered granite. Sandy silt and silty sand soils give resistivity values of 65 - 220 Ωm and 120 - 770 Ωm. Meanwhile for sand and weathered granite materials, their resistivity values are 220 - 1400 Ωm and 410 - 2600 Ω. m respectively. Beside than electrical resistivity imaging, this work also present the distribution of conductivity for the investigated subsurface via the 2 -D conductivity model. In conclusion, the used of the non-destructive <b>geophysical</b> <b>method</b> in this study is successful in image the investigated subsurface lithology and the investigation coverage area is enhanced instead of information from two discrete points of the geotechnical boreh oles. Therefore, the joint-interpretation of these two technical methods is capable and reliable to give information about the Earth’s subsurface lithology...|$|R

2500|$|The WRZ and SHZ are {{associated}} with the southern Washington Cascades conductor (SWCC), a formation of enhanced electrical conductivity lying roughly between Riffe Lake and Mounts St. Helens, Adams, and Rainier, with a lobe extending north (outlined in yellow, right). [...] This formation, up to 15km thick, is largely buried (from one to ten kilometers deep), and known mainly by magnetotellurics and other <b>geophysical</b> <b>methods.</b> [...] The southwestern boundary of the SWCC, where it is believed to be in near vertical contact with the Eocene basalts of the Crescent Formation, forms {{a good part of the}} 90km (56 mile) long SHZ. [...] On the eastern side, where the SWCC is believed to be in contact with pre-Tertiary terranes accreted to the North American craton, matters are different. [...] While there is a short zone (not shown) of fainter seismicity near Goat Rocks (an old Pliocene volcano) that may be associated with the contact, the substantially stronger seismicity of the WRZ is associated with the major Carbon RiverSkate Mountain anticline. [...] This anticline, or uplifted fold, and the narrower width of the northern part of the SWCC, reflects an episode of compression of this formation. [...] Of great interest here is that both the northern lobe of the SWCC and the Carbon River anticline are aligned towards Tiger Mountain (an uplifted block of the Puget Group of sedimentary and volcanic deposits typical of the Puget Lowland) and the adjacent Raging River anticline (see map). [...] The lowest exposed strata of Tiger Mountain, the mid-Eocene marine sediments of the Raging River formation, may be correlative with the SWCC.|$|E
