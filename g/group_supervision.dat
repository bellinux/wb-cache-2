40|$|Rationale: Clinical {{supervision}} {{has often}} been identified as good practice, and a means of enhancing patient care, {{although there is a}} limited evidence base. This research investigates whether clinical <b>supervision</b> <b>groups</b> in primary care are effective. Aim and objectives: The aim {{of this study is to}} identify whether clinical <b>supervision</b> <b>groups</b> in primary care settings are effective in comparison with the literature and evidence. The objectives are to investigate whether <b>group</b> clinical <b>supervision</b> corresponds with Proctor's (1986) model. Secondly to identify characteristics of the supervisor which supervisees and supervisors prioritised. The third objective is whether clinical <b>supervision</b> <b>groups</b> place differing demands on the supervisor than individual clinical supervision, and to make any recommendations which the research identified. Methodology: A mixed-methods, three-phased approach was used. In Phase-I postal questionnaires were used to gather background information on staff who participated in clinical <b>supervision</b> <b>groups.</b> The second phase involved non-participant observations of two clinical supervision sessions each of three different groups. While in Phase- 3 focus groups were carried out with two clinical <b>supervision</b> <b>groups.</b> Results: The participants in the research benefited most from clinical supervision which was predominantly restorative in accordance with Proctor's (1986) model. The supervisors lacked the skills necessary to manage clinical <b>supervision</b> <b>groups.</b> Both supervisees and supervisors regarded approachability and support as the most valued characteristics of the supervisor. While the supervisees valued the supervisors' knowledge more than the supervisors, who felt this was a characteristic which they lacked and did not prioritize. Conclusion: A model of clinical supervision is required focusing on the needs of more experienced practitioners. Clinical <b>supervision</b> of <b>groups</b> requires skills and training in clinical supervision and in managing groups. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
30|$|However, rural ECE in China {{has long}} {{suffered}} {{from the lack of}} effective supervision, which exacerbates the urban-rural gap. In other words, a strong supervision and evaluation system is essential to ensure the effective promotion of rural ECE development and Chinese ECE equity. Therefore, the Chinese government proposed to ‘establish kindergartens license and supervision system, strengthen the management of ECE’ and ‘educational departments should strengthen the supervision and management as well as scientific guidance of ECE’ in Chinese Mid- and Long-term Education Reform and Development Plan (2010 - 2020) and State Council: Opinion Concerning Current Development of Early Childhood Education. To implement the guidance of the Plan, the Ministry of Education distributed the Interim Measures on Supervision and Evaluation of Early Childhood Education in 2010, presenting {{a detailed description of the}} content, form, and standards of the supervision and evaluation. According to the Interim Measures, the supervision and evaluation of Early Childhood Education Three-Year Action Plan is carried out by the National Education <b>Supervision</b> <b>Group.</b> The <b>Supervision</b> <b>Group</b> assesses local government from six aspects, including responsibility implementation, funding, education resources expanding, kindergarten teachers’ training, ECE administration, and development level.

50|$|He {{published}} {{his first book}} in 1990 which was on his experience of doing strategic planning and this was followed in 1991 by {{the first of his}} books, The Chaos Frontier, which sought to explore the implications of the complexity sciences for management and organisations. Then in 1993, he published Strategic Management and Organisational Dynamics, a textbook which located complexity thinking about strategy and organisations in the wider strategy literature. The textbook is now in its 6th edition. The year 1996 saw the publication of his book Complexity and Organisational Creativity. In the meantime he had embarked on the training programme of the Institute of Group Analysis in London, qualifying as a group psychotherapist in 1998 and becoming a member of that Institute and of the Group Analytic Society. He ran clinical therapy groups at a local hospital until about 2004. Also in 1995 he set up a <b>group</b> <b>supervision</b> of PhD students and it was through this activity that he met Patricia Shaw and Doug Griffin as their PhD supervisor. They became friends and colleagues and together they developed the theory of complex responsive processes of relating as a way of understanding human organisations and their management. The collaboration between the three had a major impact on what Stacey was writing so that there is a radical shift in his way of thinking from a systemic approach prior to 2000 to a responsive processes approach in 2000 and thereafter. Together, in 1995, they set up the Complexity and Management Centre as a research centre at Hertfordshire University with Stacey as its director. Also in 2000, Stacey, Griffin and Shaw established the Doctor of Management programme at Hertfordshire Business School and Stacey took the role of its director until 2011 when he was succeeded by Professor Chris Mowles, although he continues his involvement as research supervisor. The programme is still running and has produced 58 graduates from many different countries.|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} a report of an {{interview}} study exploring personal views on participating in <b>group</b> clinical <b>supervision</b> among mental health nursing staff members who {{do not participate in}} supervision. There is a paucity of empirical research on resistance to supervision, which has traditionally been theorised as a supervisee’s maladaptive coping with anxiety in the supervision process. The aim {{of the study was to}} examine resistance to <b>group</b> clinical <b>supervision</b> by interviewing nurses who did not participate in supervision. In 2015, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 24 Danish mental health nursing staff members who had been observed not to participate in supervision in two periods of 3 months. Interviews were audio recorded and subjected to discourse analysis. We constructed two discursive positions taken by the informants: Forced non-participation where an informant was in favour of supervision, but presented practical reasons for not participating and Deliberate rejection, where an informant intentionally chose to not to participate in supervision. Furthermore, we described two typical themes drawn upon by informants in their positioning: Difficulties related to participating in supervision and Limited need for and benefits from supervision. The findings indicated that <b>group</b> clinical <b>supervision</b> extended a space for group discussion that generated or accentuated anxiety because of already existing conflicts and a fundamental lack of trust between group members. Many informants perceived <b>group</b> clinical <b>supervision</b> as an unacceptable intrusion, which could indicate a need for developing more acceptable types of post-registration clinical education and reflective practice for this group...|$|R
40|$|Reflecting {{on group}} theory within {{clinical}} supervision offers useful vantage points {{from which to}} engage nursing and the helping professions in the task of supervisory practice. This paper presents reflective experiences of <b>group</b> clinical <b>supervision</b> training and practice through a critique of Hawkins and Shohet’s process centred model.

Literature on the role Educational Psychologists hold in Children’s Centres is reviewed and a role utilising community, critical and organisational psychology principles is suggested. The present study uses a Realistic Evaluation (Pawson & Tilley, 1997) framework to explore the mechanisms, context and outcomes of <b>group</b> <b>supervision.</b> Key mechanisms within FSWs were: confidence, openness to ideas, experience of the job and supervision, prioritisation of <b>group</b> <b>supervision</b> and relationships with colleagues.

Educational Psychologists led fortnightly <b>group</b> <b>supervision</b> sessions {{in order to promote}} collaborative problem solving and to acknowledge the emotional impact of the role on staff. Method: The project was undertaken over a 12 -month period and a focus group was completed in order to evaluate the experience of <b>group</b> <b>supervision</b> from key workers' perspectives. Data was analysed using thematic analysis. Findings: Findings indicated that <b>group</b> <b>supervision</b> had a positive impact on team communication and coherence.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{describe}} nurses' experiences of factors enhancing professional development trough process-oriented group super- vision, one year after completed nursing education. The objective of process-oriented <b>group</b> <b>supervision</b> in nursing care is to support students’ development of their ability to manage complex care situations. The attitude of the supervisor and the students’ willingness to reflect on them- selves have been described as playing key roles in process-oriented <b>group</b> <b>supervision</b> during nursing education. The link to nursing science has also been described as significant by several researchers, but some supervisors are not using nursing science as a foundation in <b>group</b> <b>supervision</b> for nurses. The analysis was completed using a qualitative content analysis method based on interviews with 18 nurses resulting in the general theme “Process oriented pedagogy” which is presented in three categories: Supervisor’s character, Pedagogical strategy and Reflective communication. The findings suggest that the supervisor's personal qualities in combination with an inspiring structure are impor- tant to promote the participants’ reflective communication during the <b>group</b> <b>supervision</b> sessions.

40|$|This is a master’s thesis in counseling. The {{topic of}} this master thesis is <b>group</b> <b>supervision</b> {{for social and}} health workers. By using a {{research}} method called Q-methodology, I seek to answer the research problem: How do social and health workers experience <b>group</b> <b>supervision</b> to be a help in coping with psychosocial work? The study {{is concerned with the}} research participants’ subjective experience of <b>group</b> <b>supervision</b> and coping. The participants consisted of child protection workers, a drug abuse and mental health team, hospital health workers and students in a master of family therapy program. All the research participants had experience with <b>group</b> <b>supervision</b> through psychosocial work. The study resulted in four different views (called factors) on how <b>group</b> <b>supervision</b> is perceived to aid the workers in their jobs. Factor 1 is titled "Coping and mental health in direct, honest communication". These participants find that working with process combined with a challenging communication style constitutes a coping resource in supervision. The supervision is also perceived to be a social support that fosters good mental health for the workers. Factor 2 is called "Group supervision promoting effective cooperation". Facilitation of the work group and a focusing on process helps strengthening the cooperation among the workers. Factor 3 is named "Professional knowledge with an emphasis on the case". The mutual sharing of professional knowledge between colleagues and supervisor is found to be an important coping resource among these participants. Process is of less concern in this factor. Factor 4 is titled "The case and process are {{two sides of the same}} matter". In this factor the integration of case and process work helps increase coping ability. The supervisor functions as a facilitator. Prominent findings in this thesis are that an honest, direct communication style is preferred in <b>group</b> <b>supervision.</b> To speak ones opinion directly and freely facilitates the coping experience. Generally speaking, working with both case material and process in <b>group</b> <b>supervision</b> is necessary in order to cope well with psychosocial work. A last important finding is that <b>group</b> <b>supervision</b> fosters a closer and more effective working relationship between helper and client, which is an important prerequisite for successful coping...|$|E

The {{purpose of}} this study was to increase the current understanding of what occurs within a narrative supervision process and to explore how this approach to supervision can contribute to the development of educational practices that promote social justice efforts in the field of marriage and family therapy. In particular, this study sought to understand how and in what ways the social justice ideas that inform a narrative therapy approach were applied to a narrative <b>supervision</b> <b>group</b> process. Narrative therapy is informed by the poststructural theorist Michel Foucault and offers a unique perspective on the role that therapists can play in challenging oppressive influences in clients' lives and advocating for social change. This study utilized a critical discourse analysis in order to closely examine a series of narrative <b>supervision</b> <b>group</b> sessions. One narrative <b>supervision</b> <b>group</b> comprised of two supervisors and six supervisees served as participants in this study. Results suggested that the narrative <b>supervision</b> <b>group</b> utilized the following six supervision elements that support a social justice orientation: (a) community as pedagogy: learning through practicing together, (b) co-constructed knowledges: valuing the experiences and perspectives of clients and supervisees, (c) positioning knowledge as discourse: using the skills of deconstruction and transparency, (d) valuing expansive conversations, (e) the use of questions versus directives, and (f) the use of tentative language as a means to mitigate power. An additional in-depth analysis of three of the narrative supervision sessions further validated the narrative <b>supervision</b> <b>group's</b> social justice orientation. In particular, findings indicated that the group consistently contextualized the supervision conversation within a discursive frame, sought to expose taken for granted truths, and challenged normative standards.
