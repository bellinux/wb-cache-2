5|$|The Antiochene noblemen {{acknowledged}} Baldwin II as regent, swearing <b>fealty</b> {{to him and}} Constance. He made Joscelin I, Count of Edessa, her guardian to {{rule the}} principality until her marriage. BaldwinII died on August21, 1131, and JoscelinI died a week later.|$|E
5|$|When Philip of Ibelin died, the High Court {{appointed}} his brother, John of Ibelin, as bailli {{without consulting}} the emperor or Alice. Frederick departed for Cyprus, landing at Limassol on 21 July 1228. Upon arriving, he ordered John of Ibelin {{to account for}} the administration of the revenue of Cyprus during his and his brother's time, but John refused, stating that the revenue had been paid to Alice. Frederick dismissed Ibelin and forced Henry I of Cyprus to swear <b>fealty</b> to him. He also demanded an oath of <b>fealty</b> from the Cypriot noblemen, but they were only willing to submit to him as their king's overlord, declaring that they only owed <b>fealty</b> to Alice who served as regent to their king. Frederick made Aimery Barlais, Gavin of Chenichy, Aimaury of Beisan, Hugh of Jebail and William of Rivet baillis of Cyprus without Alice's consent before departing for Italy in May 1229. Peter I, Duke of Brittany declared that he wanted to marry Alice, but this was refused on 29 May by Pope Gregory because of consanguinity.|$|E
5|$|The Robertians were Frankish noblemen owing <b>fealty</b> to the Carolingians, and {{ancestors}} of the subsequent Capetian dynasty. Odo, Count of Paris, was chosen by the western Franks to be their king following the removal of emperor Charles the Fat. He was crowned at Compiègne in February 888 by Walter, Archbishop of Sens.|$|E
5|$|The first {{display of}} the new queen's {{authority}} was the formal act of homage of the Lower Austrian Estates to her on 22November 1740. It was an elaborate public event which served as a formal recognition and legitimation of her accession. The oath of <b>fealty</b> to Maria Theresa was taken {{on the same day}} in the Hofburg.|$|E
5|$|Winchelsey was a fearless {{opponent}} of Edward I. When he swore his oath of <b>fealty</b> to Edward, he offended the king {{by adding a}} declaration {{that he was only}} swearing <b>fealty</b> for the temporalities, not the spiritualities. All through his term as archbishop he refused to allow Edward to tax the clergy beyond certain levels, and withstood severe pressure to change his mind. In August 1295, he offered the king a tenth of all ecclesiastical revenues, less than Edward had hoped to collect from the clergy. Winchelsey did concede though that if the war with France, which was what the money was requested to fund, continued into the following year, then the clergy would be amenable to making further contributions.|$|E
5|$|After Matthias's death, he was {{the only}} bishop to support the bid of Matthias's illegitimate son, John Corvinus, for the throne. After the united armies of Corvinus's {{supporters}} were defeated, he swore <b>fealty</b> to Vladislaus II Jagiellon. The new king made him royal treasurer in 1494, but he was dismissed after being accused of embezzlement at the Diet of Hungary in 1496. Pécs Cathedral and the castle at Pécs were renovated during his tenure. His three retainers strangled him to seize his wealth.|$|E
5|$|Andrew {{wanted to}} secure his {{suzerainty}} over {{the rulers of}} Moldavia and Wallachia. He initially wanted to replace Michael the Brave, Voivode of Wallachia, with his brother, Stephen, but Michael swore <b>fealty</b> to him on 26 June. Andrew's envoys {{signed an agreement with}} Ieremia Movilă, Voivode of Moldavia, about the marriage of the voivode's daughter and Andrew's half-brother, János Iffjú, on 3 July. Andrew also started negotiations with the Ottoman Empire, demanding the confirmation of his hereditary rule and his suzerainty over Wallachia, and refusing the payment of the tribute for six years.|$|E
5|$|Ferdinand's army seized Visegrád, Vác, Pest, Tata and Székesfehérvár in October, {{but could}} not capture Buda. His {{military}} commander, Wilhelm von Roggendorf, again laid siege to Buda on 4May 1541. Suleiman left Istanbul {{at the head of}} a large army in June to take advantage of the new civil war in Hungary. On his command, Petru Rareș, Prince of Moldavia, captured Stephen Majláth and forced the Transylvanian Diet to swear <b>fealty</b> to John Sigismund in late July. Roggendorf lifted the siege of Buda before Suleiman reached the town on 26August.|$|E
5|$|In 1296, the {{agreement}} that had followed from the Great Cause between King Edward I and the King of the Scots, John Balliol, broke down. King Edward resolved to depose King John, invading the kingdom and beginning the Wars of Scottish Independence. Nicholas, as pastor of Calder-Comitis, swore <b>fealty</b> to King Edward at Berwick on 28 August 1296. His lands were restored thereafter, on 2 September, Edward having notionally confiscated all the lands of the Scottish clergy {{earlier in the year}} pending homage.|$|E
5|$|In early 1148, Foliot {{accompanied}} Theobald of Bec to the Council of Reims, {{even though}} the archbishop had been forbidden to attend by King Stephen; Foliot was presumably with Theobald when the archbishop used a small fishing boat in his escape from England to the continent. Robert de Bethune, the Bishop of Hereford, died at the Council of Reims, and Foliot was nominated by Pope Eugene III to fill the Diocese of Hereford, which was held by the Angevin cause. Theobald was behind the appointment, having urged it on the pope. It appears likely that before his consecration Foliot gave assurances {{that he would not}} swear <b>fealty</b> to Stephen. He was consecrated Bishop of Hereford on 5September 1148 at Saint-Omer by Archbishop Theobald. The other English bishops present at Reims—Hilary of Chichester and Josceline de Bohon—refused to help with the consecration, claiming it was contrary to custom for an English bishop to be consecrated outside England. Another of the bishops' concerns was that the pope had infringed Stephen's right to a say in the election. After his consecration Foliot swore <b>fealty</b> to Henry of Anjou, the son of the Empress and the new head of the Angevin party.|$|E
5|$|Isabella and her {{supporters}} Péter Petrovics and Ferenc Patócsy {{made a new}} attempt to prevent {{the execution of the}} Treaty of Nyírbátor in May 1551, but Martinuzzi defeated them. Under duress, Isabella abdicated in favor of Ferdinand on John Sigismund's behalf, in return for the two Silesian duchies and 140,000 florins on 19July. Two days later, she surrendered the Holy Crown to Ferdinand's representative, Giovanni Battista Castaldo. The Diet acknowledged their abdication and swore <b>fealty</b> to Ferdinand on 26July.|$|E
5|$|It was {{not until}} 1158, {{during the reign of}} Manuel I, that Antioch truly became a vassal of the empire, after Manuel forced Prince Raynald of Châtillon to swear <b>fealty</b> to him in {{punishment}} for Raynald's attack on Byzantine Cyprus. The Greek Patriarch was restored, and ruled simultaneously with the Latin Patriarch. Antioch, weakened by powerless regents after Raynald's capture by the Muslims in 1160, remained a Byzantine vassal state until 1182 when internal divisions following Manuel's death in 1180 hindered the Empire's ability to enforce its claim.|$|E
5|$|Owain Gwynedd's {{grandson}} Llywelyn Fawr (the Great, 1173–1240), wrested concessions {{through the}} Magna Carta in 1215 and receiving the <b>fealty</b> of other Welsh lords in 1216 {{at the council}} at Aberdyfi, became the first Prince of Wales. His grandson Llywelyn ap Gruffudd also secured {{the recognition of the}} title Prince of Wales from Henry III with the Treaty of Montgomery in 1267. Later however, a succession of disputes, including the imprisonment of Llywelyn's wife Eleanor, daughter of Simon de Montfort, culminated in the first invasion by King Edward I of England. As a result of military defeat, the Treaty of Aberconwy exacted Llywelyn's <b>fealty</b> to England in 1277. Peace was short lived and, with the 1282 Edwardian conquest, the rule of the Welsh princes permanently ended. With Llywelyn's death and his brother prince Dafydd's execution, the few remaining Welsh lords did homage for their lands to Edward I. Llywelyn's head was carried through London on a spear; his baby daughter Gwenllian was locked in the priory at Sempringham, where she remained until her death 54years later.|$|E
5|$|The Holy Roman Emperor, Frederick II, {{summoned the}} Christian rulers of Syria and the Holy Land to Cyprus. Bohemond joined him while Frederick was marching from Limassol to Nicosia in August 1228. Frederick demanded an oath of <b>fealty</b> for Antioch and Tripoli from Bohemond, but Bohemond feigned a nervous {{breakdown}} and returned to Nephin. Bohemond again met Frederick in Acre in 1229, but Bohemond's realms {{were not included in}} the peace treaty between Frederick and Al-Kamil, sultan of Egypt, on 18 February 1229.|$|E
5|$|The War of Chioggia erupted {{between the}} old-time rival Republics of Venice and Genoa in 1378, and it soon {{involved}} Venice's neighbours. King Louis took Genoa's side; and Ragusa—subordinate to Hungary, and Venice's competitor in the Adriatic—did so as well. The Venetians, having taken Kotor in August 1378, {{made an effort}} to have Tvrtko join the war on their side, which caused panic in Ragusa. Tvrtko, however, offered the Ragusans help in fighting Venice, which they initially refused. The death of George I of Zeta warranted Tvrtko's involvement in Serbian affairs, which reduced his ability to take an active part in the conflict. The Ragusans started calling for the destruction of Kotor, whose officials promised to renounce <b>fealty</b> to Venice and return to Louis. Kotor failed to fulfill this promise, but instead promised <b>fealty</b> to Tvrtko, who laid claim to the city as part of his Nemanjić ancestors' heritage. The political climate was ideal, since he was to take Kotor from his overlord's enemy. The Ragusans were furious, and an embargo ensued. Tvrtko defended Kotor from Ragusa, but was betrayed in June 1379, when the city overthrew its Venetian governor and submitted again directly to Louis.|$|E
5|$|Theobald was consecrated on 8 January 1139 by the legate, Alberic of Ostia. He went to Rome for his pallium {{and took}} part in the Second Lateran Council. As {{archbishop}} his behaviour was less political in comparison to that of his main rival, Henry of Blois. Henry was appointed a papal legate on 1 March 1139, which meant that Henry could now call church councils in England and had power equal to or exceeding that of Theobald. Theobald swore <b>fealty</b> to Stephen upon his election to Canterbury, recognising Stephen as the king of England.|$|E
5|$|Vlad's patron, Sigismund of Luxembourg, died on 9 December 1437. Sigismund's {{death and}} the {{uprising}} of the Transylvanian peasants weakened Hungary, forcing Vlad to seek reconciliation with the Ottoman Empire. He went to Edirne and swore <b>fealty</b> to Murad II. He also promised to pay a yearly tribute to the sultan and to support the Ottomans' military campaigns at the sultan's order. Before long, Murad II decided to invade Hungary and gathered his troops at Vidin.|$|E
5|$|Empress Matilda's {{invasion}} {{finally began}} {{at the end of}} the summer of 1139. Baldwin de Redvers crossed over from Normandy to Wareham in August in an initial attempt to capture a port to receive Matilda's invading army, but Stephen's forces forced him to retreat into the south-west. The following month, the Empress was invited by her stepmother, Queen Adeliza, to land at Arundel instead, and on 30 September Robert of Gloucester and Matilda arrived in England with a force of 140 knights. Matilda stayed at Arundel Castle, while Robert marched north-west to Wallingford and Bristol, hoping to raise support for the rebellion and to link up with Miles of Gloucester, who took the opportunity to renounce his <b>fealty</b> to the King and declare for Matilda.|$|E
5|$|In 1590, {{under the}} headship of Yoshishige's son Satake Yoshinobu, the Satake clan pledged <b>fealty</b> to Toyotomi Hideyoshi during the Siege of Odawara. After {{the fall of}} Odawara, Hideyoshi {{accepted}} them as vassals, and guaranteed their lordship of a 540,000 koku swath of territory in Hitachi Province. Having received recognition from Hideyoshi as the ruler of Hitachi Province, Yoshinobu's drive for unifying the province under his rule was strengthened. He brought {{nearly all of the}} province under his control, {{with the exception of the}} Tsuchiura and Shimodate areas, the control of which Hideyoshi had assured to the Yūki clan.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1370s, Carrouges IV married Jeanne de Tilly, a {{daughter}} of the Lord of Chambois whose dowry included lands and rents vital to Carrouges' ambition of expanding his family estates. Shortly after their wedding Jeanne {{gave birth to a}} son, whose godfather was a neighbour and close friend of de Carrouges, Squire Jacques Le Gris. In 1377, Pierre d'Alençon inherited his brother Robert's county of Perche and with it the castle of Bellême. In addition, he gained the <b>fealty</b> of his brother's vassals, including the Carrouges father and son as well as Jacques Le Gris. The younger Carrouges and Le Gris soon joined the court circle of the Count, centered around the town of Argentan.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 12th and early 13th centuries {{the border and}} {{political}} relationship between England and Scotland was disputed, with the kings of Scotland claiming parts {{of what is now}} northern England. John's father, Henry II, had forced William the Lion to swear <b>fealty</b> to him at the Treaty of Falaise in 1174. This had been rescinded by Richard I in exchange for financial compensation in 1189, but the relationship remained uneasy. John began his reign by reasserting his sovereignty over the disputed northern counties. He refused William's request for the earldom of Northumbria, but did not intervene in Scotland itself and focused on his continental problems. The two kings maintained a friendly relationship, meeting in 1206 and 1207, until it was rumoured in 1209 that William was intending to ally himself with Philip II of France. John invaded Scotland and forced William to sign the Treaty of Norham, which gave John control of William's daughters and required a payment of £10,000. This effectively crippled William's power north of the border, and by 1212 John had to intervene militarily to support the Scottish king against his internal rivals. John made no efforts to reinvigorate the Treaty of Falaise, though, and both William and Alexander in turn remained independent kings, supported by, but not owing <b>fealty</b> to, John.|$|E
5|$|Isabella and Martinuzzi left Buda on 5 September 1541, taking John Sigismund and the Holy Crown with them. She {{and her son}} {{settled in}} Lippa, which {{was the center of}} an old domain of the Zápolya family. The delegates of the {{counties}} of John Sigismund's realm met in Debrecen on 18October. They swore <b>fealty</b> to him and acknowledged the sultan's suzerainty. Martinuzzi signed a treaty with FerdinandI's representative, Caspar Serédy, in Gyalu (now Gilău in Romania) on 29December. According to the Treaty of Gyalu, Hungary was to be reunited under the rule of Ferdinand, but John Sigismund's right to the Zápolyas' domains in Upper Hungary was confirmed.|$|E
5|$|Nomad Turkmen bands invaded Cilicia, {{forcing the}} new ruler, Leo, to swear <b>fealty</b> to Bohemond {{shortly after his}} {{ascension}} in 1186 or 1187. The Turkmens also broke into the Principality of Antioch, pillaging the lowlands around Latakia and the monasteries in the nearby mountains. Bohemond was forced to make a truce with Al-Muzaffar Umar, Saladin's governor in Syria, who joined Saladin's invasion of the Kingdom of Jerusalem in May. Even so, Bohemond sent 50 knights {{under the command of}} his elder son, Raymond, to Jerusalem after a Christian army was almost annihilated in the Battle of Cresson. The Turkmens continued their plundering raid until the Antiochene army defeated them and seized their booty.|$|E
5|$|Raymond died {{in early}} 1197, but his widow {{gave birth to}} a posthumous son, Raymond-Roupen. The elderly Bohemond sent her and her infant son to Cilicia wanting either to secure Antioch for his son by Sybil, or to {{guarantee}} their security. Bohemond assisted Henry I, Duke of Brabant in capturing Beirut in October 1197. Before long, he decided to besiege Jabala and Latakia, but he had to return to Antioch to meet the papal legate, Conrad of Wittelsbach, Archbishop of Mainz. The archbishop had come to Antioch to secure Raymond-Roupen's right to succeed Bohemond. On Conrad's demand, Bohemond summoned the Antiochene noblemen, who swore <b>fealty</b> to his grandson.|$|E
5|$|Raymond died {{in early}} 1197. His widow, Alice, was Leo of Cilicia's niece and heir. Bohemond III sent Alice and her posthumous son, Raymond-Roupen, to Leo, {{implying}} {{that he wanted}} to disinherit his grandson. Leo of Cilicia persuaded the papal legate, Conrad of Wittelsbach, Archbishop of Mainz, to visit Antioch. On the archbishop's demand, Bohemond III declared Raymond-Roupen his heir and ordered the Antiochene noblemen to swear <b>fealty</b> to the boy. Raymond-Roupen was the only son of the first-born son of Bohemond III and thus heir by primogeniture, but Bohemond was Bohemond III's closest male relative and so heir by proximity of blood.|$|E
5|$|Sigismund made Vlad a {{first-class}} {{member of the}} Order of the Dragon (a chivalric order established by Sigismund) in Nuremberg on 8 February 1431. Other first-class members included Alfonso V of Aragon and Vytautas, Grand Duke of Lithuania. The dragon-shaped badge of the order gave rise to his Romanian sobriquet, Dracul ("the Dragon"), for which his sons became known as Dracula ("son of Dracul"). Vlad swore <b>fealty</b> to Sigismund who declared him the lawful prince of Wallachia. Vlad had to promise that he would protect the Roman Catholic Church. However, Sigismund did not assist him to seize Wallachia. In the summer, Vlad's half-brother, Alexander I Aldea, invaded Wallachia with Moldavian support and dethroned Dan II.|$|E
5|$|The Ottomans invaded Wallachia and Moldavia {{at the end}} of 1474. Matthias sent {{reinforcements}} {{under the}} command of Blaise Magyar to Stephen the Great. Their united forces routed the invaders in the Battle of Vaslui on 10 January 1475. Fearing a new Ottoman invasion, the Prince of Moldavia swore <b>fealty</b> to Matthias on 15 August. Sultan Mehmed II proposed peace but Matthias refused him. Instead, he stormed into Ottoman territory and captured Šabac, an important fort on the river Száva, on 15 February 1476. During the siege, Matthias barely escaped capture while he was watching the fortress from a boat.|$|E
5|$|There are {{indications}} that Robert may have been briefly betrothed to a daughter of King Cnut, but no marriage took place. It is unclear if William would have been supplanted in the ducal succession if Robert had had a legitimate son. Earlier dukes had been illegitimate, and William's association with his father on ducal charters appears to indicate that William was considered Robert's most likely heir. In 1034 Duke Robert decided to go on pilgrimage to Jerusalem. Although some of his supporters tried to dissuade him from undertaking the journey, Robert convened a council in January 1035 and had the assembled Norman magnates swear <b>fealty</b> to William as his heir before leaving for Jerusalem. He died in early July at Nicea, {{on his way back}} to Normandy.|$|E
5|$|After 1066, William did {{not attempt}} to {{integrate}} his separate domains into one unified realm with one set of laws. His seal from after 1066, of which six impressions still survive, was made for him after he conquered England and stressed his role as king, while separately mentioning his role as Duke. When in Normandy, William acknowledged that he owed <b>fealty</b> to the French king, but in England no such acknowledgement was made– further evidence that the various parts of William's lands were considered separate. The administrative machinery of Normandy, England, and Maine continued to exist separate from the other lands, with each one retaining its own forms. For example, England continued the use of writs, which were not known on the continent. Also, the charters and documents produced for the government in Normandy differed in formulas from those produced in England.|$|E
5|$|After Henry I's {{death in}} 1135, the {{succession}} was disputed as the king's only legitimate son, William, {{had died in}} 1120. The main contenders were the king's nephews, Stephen, Count of Boulogne and his elder brother Theobald II, Count of Champagne, and his surviving legitimate daughter, Matilda, usually known as the Empress Matilda because of her first marriage to the Holy Roman Emperor, Henry V. After Matilda was widowed in 1125, {{she returned to her}} father in England, who then secured her marriage to Geoffrey, Count of Anjou. All the magnates of England and Normandy were required to declare <b>fealty</b> to Matilda as Henry's heir, but after Henry I's death in 1135 Stephen rushed to England and had himself crowned, before Theobald or Matilda could react. The Norman barons accepted Stephen as Duke of Normandy, and Theobald contented himself with his possessions in France. But Matilda was less patient: she secured the support of the king of Scotland, David I, her maternal uncle, and the support of her half-brother Robert, Earl of Gloucester, an illegitimate son of HenryI, in 1138.|$|E
5|$|After Henry's {{death in}} 1135 the {{succession}} was disputed between the king's nephews—Stephen and his elder brother Theobald II, Count of Champagne—and Henry's surviving legitimate child Matilda, usually {{known as the}} Empress Matilda because of her first marriage to the Holy Roman Emperor, Henry V. King Henry's only legitimate son, William, had died in 1120. After Matilda was widowed in 1125 {{she returned to her}} father, who married her to Geoffrey, Count of Anjou. All the magnates of England and Normandy were required to declare <b>fealty</b> to Matilda as Henry's heir, but after Henry I's death in 1135 Stephen rushed to England and had himself crowned, before Theobald or Matilda could react. The Norman barons accepted Stephen as Duke of Normandy, and Theobald contented himself with his possessions in France. But Matilda was less sanguine and secured the support of the Scottish king, David, her maternal uncle, and in 1138 that of her half-brother, Robert, Earl of Gloucester, an illegitimate son of HenryI.|$|E
5|$|Arya, who {{has been}} living as a beggar {{in the streets of}} King's Landing since her escape from the Lannisters, learns a crowd is {{gathering}} at the Great Sept of Baelor, where her father will be judged before the gods, and in order to see over the crowd, climbs onto the statue of Baelor the Blessed. As he is dragged through the crowd, Ned notices Arya on the statue, and alerts the Night's Watch recruiter Yoren to her location. With Sansa, Cersei, Joffrey and the Small Council looking over him, Ned confesses to treason and swears <b>fealty</b> to Joffrey in front of the crowd. Satisfied, Sansa and Cersei ask Joffrey to spare Ned as Joffrey promised, but Joffrey breaks his promise and orders Ned to be executed. As Sansa watches in horror, Cersei, Varys and the Small Council attempt to intervene, and Arya tries to rescue Ned, only to be stopped by Yoren, who prevents her from seeing her father's execution. When he sees that Arya has been rescued, Ned accepts his fate and is beheaded by Ser Ilyn Payne.|$|E
5|$|Cersei convinces Sansa that to {{save her}} father's life, she must {{write a letter to}} her brother Robb imploring him to come to King's Landing and swear <b>fealty</b> to Joffrey. Later, Joffrey and Cersei hold court, where they reward Janos Slynt, the Captain of the City Watch, with a lordship, while Tywin Lannister is named the new Hand of the King. Joffrey also {{relieves}} Ser Barristan Selmy as Lord Commander of the Kingsguard and gives his post to Jaime Lannister. Selmy is offered a castle and land in recognition of his service, but a furious Selmy, regarding the offer as an insult, throws his sword at Joffrey's feet and storms out in disgust. Sansa takes the opportunity to publicly plead for her father's life, and Joffrey agrees to show mercy if Ned will confess to treason and accept him as the rightful king.|$|E
5|$|Damned to the Netherealm {{after her}} death, Mileena swears <b>fealty</b> to its ruler Shinnok. During {{the events of}} Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 (1995), Shao Kahn decides to resurrect Mileena so her skills as a vicious fighter would help him defeat Earth's chosen warriors, also magically {{granting}} her {{the ability to read}} Kitana's thoughts. Shinnok sees {{this as an opportunity to}} covertly monitor the events unfolding in Earthrealm and so he allows her to return to life. After Kahn is defeated, Mileena is summoned back to the Netherealm. In Mortal Kombat Gold (1999), she assists in Shinnok's invasion of Edenia, but allows her sister to escape from a dungeon. Following Shinnok's defeat, Mileena comes to Kitana's palace and demands the power over Edenia be shared with her. Kitana refuses and, when attacked, traps Mileena and locks her away in a dungeon.|$|E
5|$|During 1191 the {{citizens}} of the city of London managed to acquire from Coutances and Prince John the recognition that the city was self-governing, something they had been attempting to secure for a number of years. This however, was not the grant of a complete charter of liberties, which did not occur until 1199. In February 1193 Coutances summoned a council to Oxford, to address problems of administration and defence after the recently received news of Richard's captivity in Germany. The council also took oaths of <b>fealty</b> to Richard. Prince John, however, hearing that Richard was in captivity, immediately went to France and swore homage to King Philip for Richard's lands, and then returned to England and raised a rebellion. Coutances proceeded to besiege Windsor Castle, which was held by Prince John's men. When John heard that Richard was going to be freed, he left England and went to France.|$|E
5|$|Eutharic died in 522 {{at the age}} of 42, {{less than}} three years after his consulship. His death caused {{problems}} for Theoderic who never succeeded in his desire to establish a strong Gothic dynasty. Though Eutharic and Amalasuintha had a son, Athalaric born in 516, and a daughter, Matasuntha, the dynasty was never established convincingly. Theoderic named Athalaric as his heir in 526, and Athalaric's mother Amalasuintha acted as regent for her son following Theoderic's death that year. Athalaric died in October 534 {{at the age of}} 18. To maintain her power, Amalasuintha brought her cousin, and a nephew of Theoderic, named Theodahad to the throne. Though he was made to swear <b>fealty</b> to Amalasuintha, Theodahad felt insecure and in December 534 had her imprisoned on an island in Lake Bolsena where she was eventually murdered on 30 April 535.|$|E
