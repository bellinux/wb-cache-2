50|$|Hemichordata {{are divided}} into two classes: the Enteropneusta, {{commonly}} called acorn worms, and the Pterobranchia, which may include the graptolites. A third class, Planctosphaeroidea, is proposed based on a single species known only from larvae. The phylum contains about 120 living species. Hemichordata appears to be sister to the Echinodermata as Ambulacraria; Xenoturbellida may be basal to that grouping. Pterobranchia may be derived from within Enteropneusta, making Enteropneusta paraphyletic.

5000|$|Much of the {{argument}} for Precambrian sponges {{is grounded in the}} observation that pelagophyte algae produce organic matter with a low ratio of 24-isopropyl cholestane to 24-n-propyl cholestane, but that this ratio is high in ancient rocks. However, the observed change in the sterane ratio could also be explained if algae changed the relative abundances in which they produce steranes over the past 600 million years. In a similar line of argument, it is possible that another <b>extinct</b> <b>organism</b> from which the algae descended produced organic matter with a higher ratio of 24-isopropyl cholestane to 24-n-propyl cholestane. As argued above, recent evidence has suggested that the algae's synthesis pathway only arose during the Phanerozoic, which tempers this argument. More generally, these concerns address the issue of insufficient specificity in molecular fossils, which plagues many biomarker studies.|$|E

5000|$|A timetree is a {{phylogenetic tree}} scaled to time. It shows the {{evolutionary}} relationships {{of a group}} of organisms in a temporal framework. [...] Therefore, if living organisms are represented, the branch length between the base of the tree and all leafs (e.g., species) is identical because the same time has elapsed, although <b>extinct</b> <b>organisms</b> can be shown in a timetree. As with a phylogenetic tree, timetrees can be drawn in different shapes: rectangular, circular, or even spiral. The only figure in Darwin’s Origin of Species, one of the earliest printed evolutionary trees, is a hypothetical timetree. Because the fossil record has always been tightly linked to the geologic record, evolutionary trees of <b>extinct</b> <b>organisms</b> are typically illustrated as timetrees.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe first 3 D {{visualisation}} of a heteromorph cephalopod {{species from}} the Southern Alps (Dolomites, northern Italy) is presented. Computed tomography, palaeontological data and 3 D reconstructions {{were included in}} the production of a movie, which shows a life reconstruction of the <b>extinct</b> <b>organism.</b> This detailed reconstruction is according to the current knowledge of the shape and mode of life as well as habitat of this animal. The results are based on the most complete shell known thus far of the genus Dissimilites. Object-based combined analyses from computed tomography and various computed 3 D facility programmes help to understand morphological details as well as their ontogentical changes in fossil material. In this study, an additional goal was to show changes in locomotion during different ontogenetic phases of such fossil, marine shell-bearing animals (ammonoids). Hence, the presented models and tools can serve as starting points for discussions on morphology and locomotion of extinct cephalopods in general, and of the genus Dissimilites in particular. The heteromorph ammonoid genus Dissimilites is interpreted here as an active swimmer of the Tethyan Ocean. This study portrays non-destructive methods of 3 D visualisation applied on palaeontological material, starting with computed tomography resulting in animated, high-quality video clips. The here presented 3 D geometrical models and animation, which are based on palaeontological material, demonstrate the wide range of applications, analytical techniques and also outline possible limitations of 3 D models in earth sciences and palaeontology. The realistic 3 D models and motion pictures can easily be shared amongst palaeontologists. Data, images and short clips can be discussed online and, if necessary, adapted in morphological details and motion-style to better represent the cephalopod animal...|$|E
40|$|Studies on this extinct zebra have twice {{had major}} impacts on science. What does its future hold? ABSTRACT. Quaggas, {{partially}} striped zebras from South Africa, have had major impacts on science. In the nineteenth century, {{the results of}} mating between a quagga stallion and a horse mare influenced thinking about mechanisms of inheritance for more than seventy years. In the twentieth century, tissue from a quagga yielded the first DNA of an <b>extinct</b> <b>organism</b> to be cloned and sequenced. Selective breeding of plains zebras in South Africa has produced animals whose coat coloration resembles that of some quaggas. This raises the intriguing possibility that quaggas may once again {{be the focus of}} scientific investigations. Quaggas had a striking appearance: the face, neck and the anterior part of their bodies had white stripes like zebras, however, unlike other zebras their legs were not striped. The remainder of the quagga and the background color in the areas with white stripes was a brownish color – sometimes described as light brown, reddish-brown or yellowish-brown In 1758 Linnaeus created the genus Equus to include horses, donkeys, and zebras, and gave the binomial name E. zebra to the Cape mountain zebra. This was one of three zebras occurring in South Africa, the others being the plains zebra or Burchell’s zebra, E. burchelli and the quagga, E. quagga. The species name, quagga, was the common name for this zebra and is onomatopoeic: it was the sound of the zebra’s barking cry of kwa-ha (the letters “g ” are pronounced as “h”). Quaggas ranged through the grasslands and arid interior scrubland (also known as “Karoo”) of the contemporar...|$|E

25|$|The {{discovery}} of fossils of extinct species was explained by theories such as catastrophism. Catastrophism claimed that {{animals and plants}} were periodically annihilated {{as a result of}} natural catastrophes and then replaced by new species created ex nihilo (out of nothing). The <b>extinct</b> <b>organisms</b> could then be observed in the fossil record, and their replacements were considered to be immutable.|$|R
40|$|The {{literature}} on paleontology and functional morphology both include many {{studies on the}} feeding mechanics of <b>organisms.</b> In <b>extinct</b> <b>organisms,</b> physiological data must be inferred from bone structure, or muscles scars, {{even in the most}} exceptionally preserved specimens (Benton, 2010). However even reconstruction and analysis of muscle scars in fossils rely heavily on assumptions (Rieppel, 2002). Given the resilient nature of enamel, teeth are often the most commonly found remains of <b>extinct</b> <b>organisms,</b> and in some cases they are only known remains (Adnet et al., 2009; Pol, 2012). Enamel is highly calcified and so, unlike other softer portions of an organism’s anatomy, is readily preserved (Lucas et al., 2008). Fortunately, there is a close relationship between tooth form and function, which allows researchers to infer the ecology of the <b>extinct</b> <b>organisms.</b> Slender, pointed teeth, are ideal for puncturing, and bladed teeth are best suited for tearing and cutting prey, whereas more rounded and blunt teeth are thought to function better in crushing prey (Massare, 1987), a feeding strategy termed durophagy. Durophagous predators typically have robust jaw bones in addition to their distinctive and molariform teeth on the premaxilla, maxilla, dentary or the pharyngeal (Norton, 1988, Wilga and Motta, 2000). It is thought that this molariform tooth morphology, as well as tooth arrangement, may serve to increase tooth surface area, thus reducing the stress applied to teeth (Ramsay and Wilga, 2007) when crushing. Studies on the functional ability and structure of durophagous teeth have focused on a range of both <b>extinct</b> and extant <b>organisms,</b> including borophagines canids, early hominoids, and elasmobranchs (Lee et al., 2011; Lucas et al., 2008; Tseng ZJ and Wang X, 2010). For these groups, tooth form dictates diet and, by extension, habitat selection and population ecology. From there it is possible to study large-scale evolutionary patterns, co-evolutions, and trophic interactions (Lauten 2013) ...|$|R

50|$|A phylum {{is not a}} {{fundamental}} division of nature, such as the difference between electrons and protons.

50|$|A {{definition}} of a phylum based on body plan has been proposed by paleontologists Graham Budd and Sören Jensen (as Haeckel had done a century earlier).

40|$|Palaeobiologists have {{investigated}} the evolutionary responses of <b>extinct</b> <b>organisms</b> to climate change, and have also used <b>extinct</b> <b>organisms</b> to reconstruct palaeoclimates. There is evidence of a disconnection between climate change and evolution that suggests that organisms may not be accurate palaeoclimate indicators. Here, marmots (Marmota sp.) are used {{as a case study}} to examine whether similarity of climate preferences is correlated with evolutionary relatedness of species. This study tests for a relationship between phylogenetic distance and `climate distance' of species within a clade. There should be a significant congruence between maximum likelihood distance and standardized Euclidian distance between climates if daughter species tend to stay in environments similar to parent species. Marmots make a good test case because there are many extant species, their phylogenies are well established and individual survival is linked to climatic factors. A Mantel test indicates a significant correlation between climate and phylogenetic distance matrices, but this relationship explains {{only a small fraction of}} the variance (regression R 2 = 0. 114). These results suggest that (i) closely related species of marmots tend to stay in similar environments; (ii) marmots may be more susceptible than many mammals to global climate change; and (iii) because of the considerable noise in this system, the correlation cannot be used for detailed palaeoclimate reconstruction...|$|R
