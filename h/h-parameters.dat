40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the known methods for <b>h-parameter</b> {{measuring}} of the fiber and the new developed interferometry method. Analysis method of the anisotropic lightguide <b>h-parameter</b> dependence on its bending radius for the optical fiber is proposed. Micro bends of a fiber, being the defects of a sensitive element winding in a fiber-optic gyroscope (FOG), lead to the deterioration {{of a number of}} optical characteristics, in particular, the extinction coefficient and the cross-coupling coefficient. As a result, it worsens the FOG accuracy. The way of increasing the measurement accuracy and adaptation of the <b>h-parameter</b> measuring process to the existing technology of fiber-optic gyroscopes production is proposed. The mechanism of the polarization properties influence on the FOG accuracy is described through the analysis of secondary waves induced by the polarization transformation in the optical circuit.

40|$|Subject of Research. We have {{investigated}} the effect of anisotropic optical fibers winding with an elliptical sheath subjecting to stress on the <b>H-parameter</b> invariance degree. This type of optical fiber {{is used in the}} manufacture of fiber loop in fiber-optic gyroscopes. Method of Research. The method of research is based on the application of Michelson polarization scanning interferometer as a measuring device. Superluminescent diode with a central wavelength of 1575 nm and a half-width of the spectrum equal to 45 nm is used as a radiation source. The studies were carried out with anisotropic optical fiber with 50 m long elliptical sheath subjecting to stress. The fiber was wound with one layer turn to turn on the coil with a diameter of 18 cm, which is used in the design of fiber-optic gyroscope. The tension force of the optical fiber was controlled during winding on a special machine. Main Results. It was found that at the increase of tension force from 0. 05 N to 0. 8 H the value of <b>H-parameter</b> increases from 7 × 10 - 6 1 /m up to 178 × 10 - 6 1 /m, respectively; i. e. the coupling coefficient of orthogonal modes in the test fiber is being increased. Thus, it is necessary to consider the longitudinal tension force of fiber in the design and manufacture of the fiber-optic sensors of high accuracy class: the less the fiber winding power, the higher invariance degree of distributed <b>H-parameter.</b> The longitudinal tension force of anisotropic optical fiber with elliptical sheath subjecting to stress equal to 0. 2 N is recommended in the process of designing fiber-optic gyroscopes.

50|$|A {{dependent}} {{source is}} one in which the voltage or current of the source output is dependent on another voltage or current elsewhere in the circuit. There are thus four possible types: current dependent voltage source, voltage dependent voltage source, current dependent current source and voltage dependent current source. Non-ideal dependent sources can be modelled with the addition of an impedance {{in the same way as}} non-dependent sources. These elements are widely used to model the function of two-port networks; one generator is needed for each port and it is dependent on either voltage or current at the other port. The models are an example of black box modelling, that is, they are quite unrelated to what is physically inside the device but correctly model the device's function. There are a number of these two-port models, differing only in the type of generator required to represent them.
