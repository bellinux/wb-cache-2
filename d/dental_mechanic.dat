25|$|Following the {{outbreak}} of World War II, {{the small number of}} full-time dental personnel were augmented by Militia officers and civilian volunteers. Although early enlistment was low, as part of the mobilisation process, in October 1939 provision was made for the establishment of dental units consisting of one dental officer, two <b>dental</b> <b>mechanics</b> and one clerk orderly, who were to be placed within three field ambulances, one casualty clearing station, two general hospitals and one convalescent depot. Initially, dental equipment and supplies were insufficient for the tasks required, with a single division requiring an estimated 50,000 fillings, 40,000 extractions and 10,000 dentures, however, personnel managed to overcome this through the acquisition of stores from local areas.|$|R

40|$|Dissection is {{the best}} way to study the {{anatomical}} relations of the cerebral ventricles; a resin cast, however, illustrates more accurately their actual size, shape and intricate anatomy. A study of the resins available in Malta showed that methyl methacrylate, much used in <b>dental</b> <b>mechanics,</b> could be availed of to produce a detailed, beautifully coloured, rigid cast of the comparatively large cerebral cavities. The greatest advantage of methyl methacrylate is the ease with which it can be processed. Shrinkage after processing is negligible so resulting in a markedly true and well-marked impression of all the structures immediately related to the ventricles. A technique is described for the use of methyl methacrylate as a resin for the preparation of casts of the cerebral ventricles. Additionally, its advantages and disadvantages are discussed whereby it is hoped that in future this resin will be used more for this purpose. peer-reviewe...|$|R

In addition, they submitted that under the present system and because of the overall shortage of dentists, the cost and quality of dentures were not likely to improve. They indicated that in other countries, notably Canada, the denture problems had been solved by creating a new denture care system known as denturism. Under this, full and removable partial dentures are constructed, altered and repaired directly for the public by denturists specifically trained and educated to perform this service. This, they claimed had led to an improved quality and fit of denture, freed the dentists to concentrate on preventive treatment, and reduced the cost of dentures by 50 per cent...|$|R

40|$|In {{a search}} for clues to {{previously}} industrial carcinogens the occupational and smoking histories of young and middle aged men with different types of cancer were compared. The study population comprised men aged 18 - 54 and resident in the counties of Cleveland, Humberside, and Cheshire (including the Wirral). From hospital and cancer registration records 2942 members of the study population in whom cancers were diagnosed during the period 1975 - 80 were identified retrospectively. The occupational and smoking histories of these patients were sought by a postal questionnaire addressed either to the patients themselves or, if they had died, to their next of kin. The overall response rate to the questionnaire was 52. 1 %. Additionally, limited occupational information was obtained for 89 % of cases from their hospital notes. Analysis of these data suggests that no serious bias arose {{as a consequence of}} the incomplete response to the questionnaire. This paper concentrates on the results for cancers of the respiratory tract and mesothelioma. Mesothelioma was found to cluster in laggers, electricians, and shipyard workers, and nasal carcinoma in woodworkers. Carcinomas of the larynx and of the bronchus were examined by formal statistical techniques, each being compared with a control group made up of all other cancers combined. Several interesting occupational and industrial associations were shown, in particular, an excess of bronchial carcinoma in the leather industry (RR = 2. 6, CI 1. 2 - 6. 0), in building labourers (RR = 1. 7, CI 1. 0 - 2. 9) and other construction workers (RR = 1. 8, CI 1. 0 - 3. 0), in bakers and pastry cooks (RR = 3. 6, CI 1. 3 - 10. 4). and in cooks (RR = 2. 5, CI 1. 2 - 5. 1).

40|$|Y. Antoniyk. ‘INSURGENT DENTISTS’: TEETH MEDICAL TREATMENT IN OUN AND UIA UNDERGROUND. The article {{analyses}} dentistry {{development in}} the underground of the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists and the Ukrainian Insurgent Army. It is proved that personal hygiene maintenance had a significant role for them. In particular, the teeth care {{as one of its}} parts. It is established that the underground organizations strived by all means to provide themselves with toothbrushes and toothpowder. The above mentioned measures and also the youth of insurgents to some extend alleviated their dental problems. Nevertheless, in case the dental diseases or mouth cavity infections appeared the problem rose particularly acute. They attempted to cure the inflammation by herbal decoctions and to grow the toothache calm by dental drops. The underground got most part of medicine legally owing to their sympathisers. The other part they tried to produce by themselves at the insurgent workshops. Despite that, there was constant lack of medicine. It was even more difficult issue for insurgents to see a doctor. Considering the necessity of strict conspiracy they had to stomach excruciating pain {{for a long time and}} expect for golden opportunity of the medical cure. Therefore, starting from the summer of 1943 the military dentists began to function at ‘The Medical Service’ of the UIA underground. They constantly moved from one UIA cell to the other. Their task was to conduct a medical check-up of riflemen and also dental care of the underground cells in an accountable territory. The bad teeth were not filled but only extracted at those times. The insurgent dentists were assumed as very valuable specialists for the underground. There was a sorely deficiency of such specialists even with taking into consideration the fact that they were diligently calculated and mobilized. That was a reason why the dentists were recruited from Jewish doctors, who tried to save themselves from Nazis. The dental prosthesis was an exclusive possibility of the underground leaders of the OUN and UIA and their closest companions – assistants, typists, security guards etc. The most frequent material for making tooth crowns and dental prostheses they used Russian golden coins in value of 5 karbovanets. In most cases <b>dental</b> <b>mechanics</b> had any idea that they worked for the underground organization. The mentioned above clients introduced themselves by fictional names in order not to arise any suspects. Only in special cases the dentists, who worked confidentially in their specialty, were involved into the underground activity. At the same time, the underground dentists were used not only for dental cure but also for solving many other tasks. They took part into the maintaining of the connection lines, leading propaganda, medical courses, making some sabotage acts and terrorist attacks. Many of the underground dentists died in the clashes with the enemy or were captured and get considerable terms of imprisonments. Key words: the Ukrainian nationalistic underground, personal hygiene, insurgent dentists, prosthesis. Антонюк Я. Н. «Повстанческие дантисты»: лечение зубов в подполье ОУН и УПА. В статье проанализировано развитие стоматологии в подполье Организации Украинских Националистов и Украинской Повстанческой Армии.
