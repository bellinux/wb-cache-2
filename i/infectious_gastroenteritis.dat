50|$|Emesis is {{a defense}} {{mechanism}} {{controlled by the}} area postrema of the medulla oblongata. There are various sources of input to the vomiting center. Receptors {{on the floor of}} the fourth ventricle of the brain represent the chemoreceptor trigger zone. The chemoreceptor trigger zone contains dopamine D2 receptors, serotonin 5-HT3 receptors, opioid receptors, acetylcholine receptors, and receptors for substance P. Stimulation of different receptors are involved in different pathways leading to emesis. In the final common pathway, substance P, which activates the neurokinin-1 receptor, appears to be involved. Additionally, the vagal and enteric nervous system inputs transmit information regarding the state of the gastrointestinal system. Irritation of the GI mucosa by chemotherapy, radiation, distention, or acute <b>infectious</b> <b>gastroenteritis</b> activates the 5-HT3 receptors of these inputs. It is now widely known that cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents cause a detectable increase in blood levels of serotonin (5-HT) and its major metabolite, 5-Hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA). The presence of these chemicals in the blood activate 5-HT3 receptors in the chemoreceptor trigger zone, in turn releasing substance P, which activates NK1 receptors to cause an emetic response (vomiting).|$|E

Participants: The 45 and Up Study is a large-scale Australian prospective study of adults aged ≥ 45 years (mean 62. 7 years) at recruitment in 2006 - 2009. Selfreported demographic, health and dietary information at recruitment from 265 440 participants were linked to <b>infectious</b> <b>gastroenteritis</b> hospitalisation data. Outcome measures: We estimated the incidence of hospitalisation for <b>infectious</b> <b>gastroenteritis,</b> and calculated HRs using Cox regression, adjusting for sociodemographic, health and behavioural variables, with age as the underlying time variable. Results: There were 6077 incident <b>infectious</b> <b>gastroenteritis</b> admissions over 1 111 000 personyears. Incidence increased exponentially with increasing age; from 2. 4 per 1000 (95 % CI 2. 2 to 2. 5) in individuals aged 45 - 54 years to 9. 5 per 1000 (95 % CI 9. 2 to 9. 8) in those aged 65 + years.

This sharp rise occurred coincidentally with an outbreak of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7 (EHEC O 157) infection in Niimi City of the Takahashi-Ashin district. However, this phenomenon of coincidental outbreaks was not observed during the outbreak of EHEC O 157 infection in Oku Cho. By reviewing outpatients' charts in a sentinel hospital in Niimi City for the Infectious Disease Surveillance Program, it was noted that patients with acute gastrointestinal infection visiting the hospital during the increased incidence of <b>infectious</b> <b>gastroenteritis</b> may have been included as misclassified cases of EHEC O 157 infection. On the other hand, the exponential probability plotting of symptomatic patients with EHEC O 157 infection in Niimi City revealed a breaking point which suggested a dual exposure to contaminated food or an overlap with other acute gastrointestinal infections.

40|$|Background: Crohn’s disease (CD) and {{ulcerative}} colitis (UC) are two pathotypes of {{inflammatory bowel disease}} (IBD) with unique pathology, risk factors and significant morbidity. Aim: To estimate incidence and identify IBD risk factors in a US military population, a healthy subset of the US population, using information from the Millennium Cohort Study. Methods: Incident IBD was identified from medical encounters from 2001 to 2009 or by self-report. Our primary risk factor of interest, <b>infectious</b> <b>gastroenteritis,</b> was identified from medical encounters and self-reported post-deployment health assessments. Other potential risk factors were assessed using self-reported survey responses and military personnel files. Hazard ratios were estimated using Cox proportional hazards analysis. Results: We estimated 23. 2 and 21. 9 diagnoses per 100 000 person-years, respectively, for CD and UC. For CD, significant risk factors included [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR), 95 % confidence interval]: current smoking (aHR: 2. 7, 1. 4 – 5. 1), two life stressors (aHR: 2. 8, 1. 4 – 5. 6) and prior irritable bowel syndrome (aHR: 4. 7, 1. 5 – 15. 2). There was no significant association with prior <b>infectious</b> <b>gastroenteritis.</b> There was an apparent dose–response relationship between UC risk and {{an increasing number of}} life stressors.

40|$|Acute <b>infectious</b> non-bacterial <b>gastroenteritis</b> {{not only}} occurs as an {{epidemic}} disease in institutionalized and civilian populations (1 [...] 4) but also persists as an endemic disease responsible for sporadic cases or localized family outbreaks (4). The results of transmission studies in volunteers (2, 5) and variations {{in patterns of}} outbreaks in New York State (6) prompted the suggestion that such gastroenteritis {{may be caused by}} more than one agent (2). This hypothesis has recently been supported by a study of cases of non-bacterial gastroenteritis occurring in a population of Cleveland families (4), for clinical and epidemiologic data imply that at least two types of infectious gastroenteriti% afebrile and febrile, occur in the families. The purpose of the present investigation was to characterize further the types of gastroenteritis observed in the Family Study just mentioned and to compare them with the disease caused by the previously described Marcy strain, a filterable agent obtained from an institutional oubreak of gastroenteritis in New York State (2). The Marcy strain, when fed as bacteria-free supernate of watery stool specimens, has caused a syndrome characterized chiefly by watery diarrhea in approximately two-thirds of volunteers inoculated.

Following an attack of gastro-enteritis evoked by the Marcy strain (4), which is presumably a virus, an effective immunity de-velops in volunteers (1, 4 - 6), and in an earlier report the opinion was expressed that immunity probably does not persist for long (5). The present study shows that individuals who recov-ered from experimental Marcy gastroenteritis {{more than a year before}} were fully resistant to re-infection.

40|$|Caliciviridae {{are small}} {{icosahedral}} positive-sense RNA-containing viruses and include the human noroviruses, a {{leading cause of}} <b>infectious</b> acute <b>gastroenteritis</b> and feline calicivirus (FCV), which causes respiratory illness and stomatitis in cats. FCV attachment and entry is mediated by feline junctional adhesion molecule A (fJAM-A), which binds to the outer face of the capsomere, inducing a conformational change in the capsid that may be important for viral uncoating. Here we present the results of our structural investigation of the virus-receptor interaction and ensuing conformational changes. Cryo-electron microscopy and three-dimensional image reconstruction were used to solve the structure of the virus decorated with a soluble fragment of the receptor at subnanometer resolution. In initial reconstructions, the P domains of the capsid protein VP 1 and fJAM-A were poorly resolved. Sorting experiments led to improved reconstructions of the FCV–fJAM-A complex {{both before and after the}} induced conformational change, as well as in three transition states. These data showed that the P domain becomes flexible following fJAM-A binding, leading to a loss of icosahedral symmetry. Furthermore, two distinct conformational changes were seen; an anticlockwise rotation of up to 15 ° of the P domain was observed in the AB dimers, while tilting of the P domain away from the icosahedral 2 -fold axis was seen in the CC dimers. A list of putative contact residues was calculated by fitting high-resolution coordinates for fJAM-A and VP 1 to the reconstructed density maps, highlighting regions in both virus and receptor important for virus attachment and entry...|$|R
40|$|We {{implemented}} hospital {{information system}} (HIS) alerts to deter unnecessary test orders for ovum and parasite (O&P) exams and Clostridium difficile PCR. The HIS alerts decreased noncompliant O&P orders (orders after> 72 h of hospitalization) from 49. 8 % to 30. 9 %, an overall decrease of 19 %, and reduced noncompliant C. difficile PCR orders (orders< 7 days after a previous positive result) from 30. 6 % to 19. 2 %, an overall decrease of 31. 9 %. Immunocompromised patients frequently present with acute di-arrhea due to an unknown etiology. In this patient population, diarrhea {{may be related to}} chemotherapy, graft-versus-host dis-ease, antibiotics, other medications, (e. g., laxatives), or infectious disease agents; thus, clinically distinguishing between these causes can be difficult (1). Furthermore, these patients are at a higher risk for complications from <b>infectious</b> causes of <b>gastroenteritis</b> (2), highlighting the importance of correct and timely laboratory test-ing (1). On the other hand, unnecessary and duplicate testing can result in additional expenses, laboratory workloads, and burdens on patients and related hospital staff (3, 4). Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) {{is one of the most}} com...|$|R
40|$|M. Tech. Chemical EngineeringThe lack {{of clean}} and fresh water {{has become a}} {{worldwide}} problem because of water pollution caused by industrialization. Contamination of natural water sources by heavy metal is a worldwide public health problem, leading to waterborne outbreaks of <b>infectious</b> hepatitis, viral <b>gastroenteritis,</b> and cancer. Therefore it very important to remove these toxic metal ions from municipal and industrial effluents {{in order to protect}} plants, animals and human beings from their adverse effect before discharging into natural water bodies. Although, several separation methods such as filtration, reverse osmosis and membrane technology have been developed to remove these toxic heavy metal ions from wastewater, however these conventional treatments technologies were found to be expensive on a sustainable basis. Adsorption process was identified as the most effective, and extensively used essential process in wastewater treatment, and in order for adsorption process to feasibly remove pollutants from wastewater, there should be a need for a suitable adsorbent which will have a large porous surface area, and a controllable porous structure. Through the application of nanotechnology, nano adsorbents can be developed as effective adsorbents to treat wastewater. The main objective of this project was to apply magnetic metal doped iron oxides as an efficient adsorption media for the removing of Cr(VI), Cd(II) and V(V) ions from wastewater...|$|R
