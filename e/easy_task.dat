5|$|The 6th Airborne Division, {{now with}} the commandos of the 1st Special Service Brigade under command, had to defend the Orne bridgehead. This was not an <b>easy</b> <b>task</b> as it had to face {{elements}} of the 21st Panzer Division {{from the south and}} the 346th and 711th Infantry Divisions from the east.|$|E
5|$|Vizzini {{became a}} cancia â€“ an {{intermediary}} between the peasants who wanted their wheat milled into flour and the mills that were {{located near the}} coast. Mafiosi that did not tolerate any competition controlled the mills. In the case of Villalba the mills were some 80 kilometres away. To get the grain safely to the mills over roads infested by bandits was no <b>easy</b> <b>task.</b>|$|E
5|$|What {{was needed}} was a new bombsight, one that could be very quickly set up, had useful {{illumination}} of the crosshairs for night use and was stabilized so the bomb aimer could watch the approach as the bomber was manoeuvring. An early attempt was the Mk. XI, which mounted a cut-down CSBS {{on the front of}} a gyro unit taken from a Sperry Gyroscope artificial horizon, to provide stabilization in the horizontal plane, useful for aiding drift measurements and corrections. It was no <b>easy</b> <b>task</b> to manually calculate the range angle on the Course and Speed Calculator. Although introduced in 1941, only a small number were produced.|$|E
30|$|PC {{testing has}} the added benefit that {{comparing}} two stimuli {{can often be}} an <b>easier</b> <b>task</b> for subjects than providing absolute ratings for two stimuli presented in isolation from each other. An <b>easier</b> <b>task</b> can result in reduced variation in individual performance of that task, thus reducing undesired variation in subjective test results.|$|R

5|$|One such {{case is a}} genus of shellfish, Lampsilis, which {{feeds on}} the gills of fish in the larval stage of their development. Once they mature, they leave the fish as adult mollusc. Gaining entry into the host is not an <b>easy</b> <b>task</b> though, {{despite the fact that}} several hundred {{thousand}} larvae are released at once. This is especially the case in flowing water bodies such as streams, where they cannot lie on the substrate and wait to be taken up in the course of foraging. Female Lampsilis have evolved a special technique for delivering their offspring into a suitable host, however. Structures {{on the edge of the}} mantle are able to capture the interest of fish. Some resemble small fish themselves, with eye spots, a 'tail' and horizontal stripes, and may even move in a similar fashion, as if facing the current (rheotaxis). When overshadowed by a fish, the larvae are forcefully expelled, becoming ectoparasites on their unsuspecting host.|$|E
5|$|The Federal Government {{required}} that all cemeteries and burial grounds be moved. This included the Harvey tomb, {{and it was}} no <b>easy</b> <b>task.</b> In 1962 contractor Harald Mathis of Springdale took nine days to raze the 40-ton tomb and one to move it. The first attempt broke a flatbed truck. Another contractor from Huntsville with a stronger truck then had to be called in. A new road was laid to the new site of Harvey's tomb. The tomb was placed on the crest of a hill donated by Harvey's longtime friends and neighbors Mr. and Mrs. Kenneth Doescher. Today, the tomb sits on private property visible from the Monte Ne boat launch on Beaver Lake. Relocation of the aging tomb put pressure on it, causing it to crack.|$|E
5|$|From November 2009 until November 2010, the 173rd Airborne Brigade {{once again}} {{returned}} to Afghanistan, {{this time to}} the provinces of Logar and Wardak. With combat experience already earned in other similar mountain regions in 2007 and 2008, the Brigade distinguished itself in combat regularly against the Taliban and fought tenaciously against them, while still promoting and attempting to legitimize the Afghan government. The 1st and 2nd Battalions saw extensive action in eastern Logar and Wardak. The 1/91st Cavalry was given a mission to transform western Logar province into a secure environment; a mission that was not greeted as an <b>easy</b> <b>task.</b> Given the province and its three major districts saw a massive influx of both foreign and domestic fighters due to the relatively calm winter prior to the brigade's arrival, its company-sized and platoon-sized elements found themselves in combat against anti-Coalition forces almost daily {{from the start of}} March 2010 until its relief. The brigade returned to its home station in Europe in November 2010. Seven soldiers from the brigade lost their lives during the deployment.|$|E
40|$|Studies {{have found}} that people are overconfident in {{estimation}} involving difficult tasks but underconfident in <b>easy</b> <b>tasks.</b> Conversely, they are overconfident in placing themselves in <b>easy</b> <b>tasks</b> but underconfident in hard tasks. These findings {{can be explained by}} a regression hypothesis that implies random errors in estimation as well as by rational Bayesian updating (that implies no random error). We test these hypotheses in five experiments. We find overconfidence in estimation involving hard tasks but underconfidence in <b>easy</b> <b>tasks.</b> However, for placement (involving both <b>easy</b> and hard <b>tasks)</b> we find no overconfidence, regression effects due to low and high anchor points, and extreme underconfidence when people choose between multiple alternatives. On the other hand, when given precise information about absolute performance, people's re-assessments of relative performance are consistent with the Bayesian model. Since placement judgments are important in many competitive settings, our results emphasize the need for more research to identify their determinants.

25|$|If {{her good}} looks, strong clear voice, and lively wit were {{responsible}} for catching the eye of Killigrew, she still had to prove herself clever enough to succeed as an actress.

40|$|To {{determine}} whether hospitals increase efforts on <b>easy</b> <b>tasks</b> relative to difficult tasks to improve scores under pay-for-performance (P 4 P) incentives. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Hospital Compare data from Fiscal Years 2003 through 2005 and 2003 American Hospital Association Annual Survey data. We classified measures of process compliance {{targeted by the}} Premier Hospital Quality Incentive Demonstration as easy or difficult to improve based on whether they introduce additional per-patient costs. We compared process compliance on <b>easy</b> and difficult <b>tasks</b> at hospitals eligible for P 4 P bonus payments relative to hospitals engaged in public reporting using random effects regression models. P 4 P hospitals did not preferentially increase efforts for <b>easy</b> <b>tasks</b> in patients with heart failure or pneumonia, but they did exhibit modestly greater effort on <b>easy</b> <b>tasks</b> for heart attack admissions. There is no systematic evidence that effort was allocated toward easier processes of care and away from more difficult tasks. Despite perverse P 4 P incentives to change allocation of efforts across tasks to maximize performance scores at lowest cost, we find little evidence that hospitals respond to P 4 P incentives as hypothesized. Alternative incentive structures may motivate greater response by targeted hospitals...|$|R
