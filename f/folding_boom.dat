Based on the functional requirement analysis, the working height and boom type are determined. With mechanical calculation, the section part of <b>folding</b> <b>boom</b> is designed. According to the optimization design of luffing three hinged points of the lower boom, the mounting position of luffing cylinder next to the lower boom and the turntable size are obtained. Based on the presented design methods and process, the <b>folding</b> <b>boom</b> model is built with Pro/E software...|$|E
40|$|Three {{concepts}} {{were considered}} for the boom design: a one-piece boom with a trolley, a <b>folding</b> <b>boom,</b> and a telescoping boom. The telescoping boom was selected over the other two concepts because of its easy manual operation. The boom is designed to mount on the bed of a pick-up truck and elevate the radiometer system 8 meters above the ground and 4 meters away from the truck. The selection of the boom components is discussed with justification of the final choice. Results of performance tests and one season's operation of the completed boom are reported...|$|E

40|$|A {{feasibility}} {{study was conducted}} on large <b>folding</b> <b>booms</b> for spacecraft applications. The resulting design featured precise repeatability, permitted the passing of a large electrical cable directly through each knuckle, and used a constant-speed spring-driven motor to operate the knuckles {{by means of a}} cable. The entire assembly, including the spring motor, is completely nonmagnetic and is ideally suited for placing a magnetometer experiment a considerable distance from the spacecraft structure. It can also place many other instruments, such as antennas and solar-celled paddle systems, away from the structure. "Report date January 1964.

40|$|AbstractIt is very {{important}} for gas-structure interaction between compressible ideal gas and elastic structure of space <b>folded</b> membrane <b>booms</b> during the inflatable deployment. In order to study this gas-structure interaction problem, Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) finite element method was employed. Gas-structure interaction equation was built based on equilibrium integration relationship, and solved by operator split method. In addition, numerical analysis of V-shape <b>folded</b> membrane <b>booms</b> inflated by gas was given, the variation of inner pressure as well as deployment velocities of inflatable boom at different stage were simulated. Moreover, these results are consistent with the experiment of the same boom, which shows that both ALE method and operator split method are feasible and reliable methods to study gas-structure interaction problem...|$|R
40|$|Title and Author: Agriculture sprayer {{hydraulic}} boom upgrade by Chad Omlin (engineering Technologies, Safety, and Construction) Abstract: Today’s agriculture {{industry is}} all about being the most efficient with your time, land, employees, and machinery. One thing that has made farming more efficient has been the use of hydraulics. Having a sprayer unit with manual booms is not being efficient with your time and/or employees. To make the sprayer unit more efficient, hydraulic cylinders were added. Sketched solutions were analyzed using statics and mechanics of materials principles. Drawings were completed for the successful analysis solutions. Solid works software was used to ensure fits and articulation. The prototype was then built, {{and is now in}} the testing state. This device was designed to run seventy-five percent faster when <b>folding</b> the <b>booms</b> in or out versus manually <b>folding</b> the <b>booms.</b> Test results conclude that the device will run far more than seventy-five percent faster, but for safety reason has been slowed down to no more than seventy-five percent. Spraying road ways use to take 1. 5 hours now only takes 1 hour because of the hydraulic booms. This intern saves the farmer money by not having to pay the operator for more hours, and it reduces the hours put on the machine. This hydraulic boom upgrade will be very beneficial to any farmer looking to be more efficient with their sprayer, employees, and equipment. Keywords:,...|$|R

In such a configuration, the Super Puma is modified with additional corrosion protection, a <b>folding</b> tail rotor <b>boom,</b> a deck-landing guidance system, sonar equipment, and the nose-mounted Omera search radar. For the anti-surface role, it can be armed {{with a pair of}} Exocet anti-ship missiles.|$|R

40|$|In {{this work}} we {{investigated}} the stability {{behavior and the}} folding capability of an ultrathin tubular composite boom with C-cross section {{to be used in}} nanosatellites applications. A nonlinear buckling analysis was performed using the Riks method, adopting a perturbed finite element model to study the influence of the unavoidable geometrical variations of the boom thickness, arising from the composite manufacturing processes, on the stability behavior of the tubular structure. The effect of several levels of geometrical imperfection on the buckling behavior was analyzed. The minimum coil radius {{that can be used for}} a safe storage the boom was determined by quasi-static explicit analysis. The <b>boom</b> <b>folding</b> process was considered as formed by two sequential steps, the flattening and the coiling. The stress fields associated with both steps were investigated...|$|R

50|$|The {{spacecraft}} had {{a diameter}} of approximately 30 in (760 mm) and a length of 47 in (1,190 mm) The octagonal lower section of the spacecraft housed the electronic apparatus. The upper section, which contained the experiment package, was shaped like a truncated cone. A heat shield covering this upper section protected the experiment during re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere. A yo-yo de-spin assembly was located around the girth of the spacecraft. Four <b>booms,</b> <b>folded</b> {{against the side of}} the spacecraft, were located radially around the satellite. After the spacecraft separated from the launch vehicle, the yo-yo despin subsystem slowed spacecraft rotation. The four booms were then released to extend from the side of the spacecraft. The extension of the booms increased the moment of inertia of the spacecraft, permitting the acceleration level to remain below 10−3g.|$|R
