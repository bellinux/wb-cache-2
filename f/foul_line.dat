5|$|McNamara helped {{capture the}} school's first ever National Championship in 2003. McNamara started every game in his {{freshman}} year, helping lead the Orange to a 30-5 record, including a perfect 17-0 at home. He averaged 13 points, 4.6 assists and 2.2 steals a game while shooting 35 percent from 3-point range and 91 {{percent from the}} <b>foul</b> <b>line.</b>|$|E
5|$|Originally {{a soccer}} player, Rolle {{did not play}} {{basketball}} until he was 15, when local coach Darrel Sears saw him walking across a basketball court and saw Rolle's great height. Sears asked if {{he knew how to}} play; Rolle said no. Sears asked him to try shooting from the <b>foul</b> <b>line.</b> His first shot, according to Rolle, completely missed the backboard and fell into the bushes behind it. At the time Rolle was not interested in the game and only attended Sears' practices because free fried chicken was provided.|$|E
5|$|As a sophomore, Burke made 5 of 6 {{free throws}} in {{overtime}} {{to help his}} team defeat Dublin Scioto High School by a 54–53 margin in a 2009 OHSAA Division I regional final. In the state championship game, he made one of two free throws to give Northland a 58–56 lead with 27.6 seconds left in what became a 60–58 win over Princeton High School. He also made the pass {{to set up the}} final game-winning points, although they were scored from the <b>foul</b> <b>line</b> by Sullinger. During the championship season, Burke averaged 10.7 points and 9.1 assists, and made only 1.7 turnovers per game.|$|E

5|$|As an {{implement}} {{of war and}} hunting, javelin throwing began in prehistoric times. Along with the discus, the javelin was the second throwing event in the ancient Olympic pentathlon. Records from 708 BC show two javelin competition types co-existing: throwing at a target and throwing the javelin for distance. It was the latter type from which the modern event derives. In ancient competitions, athletes would wrap an ankyle (thin leather strip) around the javelin that acted as a sling to facilitate extra distance. The javelin throw gained much popularity in Scandinavia in the late 19th century and athletes from the region are still among the most dominant throwers in men's competitions. The modern event features a short run up on a track and then the thrower releases the javelin before the <b>foul</b> <b>line.</b>|$|E
5|$|A double {{is a safe}} hit {{in which}} the batter reaches second base without being called out. This {{scenario}} often occurs when a ball is hit into the gaps between the outfielders, or down the <b>foul</b> <b>line</b> {{on either side of}} the playing field. Tris Speaker is the all-time leader in doubles in MLB history, with 792, one of which was part of a cycle; Speaker accomplished the feat for the Boston Red Sox on June 9, 1912, against the St. Louis Browns. Two of the other top five players in MLB history in doubles have hit for the cycle: Stan Musial (725 doubles; third all-time) completed the cycle on July 24, 1949; and Craig Biggio (668; fifth all-time) accomplished the feat on April 8, 2002. The single-season MLB leader is Earl Webb, the left-handed outfielder who hit 67 in 1931.|$|E
5|$|In {{his sophomore}} season, Moore played 34games, {{starting}} five, and averaged 7.6points and 3.0rebounds per game. In the November17 game against Georgetown, with Temple maintaining a one point lead with 23seconds left, Moore missed {{the front end}} of a one-and-one foul shot. Afterwards, Greg Monroe of Georgetown hit a layup to give the Hoyas a 46–45 victory. The following game against Siena, Moore was at the <b>foul</b> <b>line</b> with a one-point lead and, with 22seconds left, hit both free throws to hand Temple a 73–69 victory. He increased his scoring average to 9.8points per game in conference play, receiving more minutes due to a head injury to teammate Juan Fernandez. On February20,2010, he scored a season-high 24points in an overtime victory over city rival Saint Joseph's, and made a critical fullcourt layup with 1.5seconds left to send the game into overtime. Moore helped Temple to a 29–5 record and a third consecutive Atlantic 10 conference tournament title and an automatic bid to the NCAA Tournament. He was named Atlantic 10 Sixth Man of the Year.|$|E

5|$|The Tar Heels {{defeated}} the Yale Bulldogs 9074 in the NCAA East Regional Quarterfinal {{in order to}} advance to the semifinal against Canisius College. North Carolina won the game by twelve points, which allowed them {{to move on to the}} NCAA East Regional Final against Syracuse. The final, along with the semifinal, were held at the Palestra in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The Syracuse Orange fell to the Tar Heels 6758 as the Tar Heels advanced to the Final Four in Kansas City, Missouri. The Tar Heels opponent for the national semifinal was Michigan State. The Tar Heels were tied with the Spartans as time was winding down in regulation. Michigan State's Jack Quiggle made a half court shot that would have given the Spartans the lead, but the shot left his hands after time expired, nullifying the basket. In the first overtime, Michigan State had a two-point lead with eleven seconds remaining, while also having a player at the <b>foul</b> <b>line.</b> The Spartan missed both shots and Tar Heel Brennan gathered the rebound, dribbled down the court, and made a shot as time expired to send the game to a second overtime. The Tar Heels pulled away in the third overtime to win the game 7470. The game saw the lead change thirtyone times before the Tar Heels were able to emerge victorious after three overtime periods.|$|E

25|$|On September 6 {{against the}} Oakland A's, Ichiro {{collected}} his 2,000th MLB {{hit on the}} second pitch of the game, a double along the first base <b>foul</b> <b>line.</b> He is the second-fastest player to reach the milestone, behind Al Simmons. On September 13 against the Texas Rangers, Ichiro collected his 200th hit of the season for the ninth consecutive year, setting an all-time major league record. Ichiro recorded 210 hits with Orix in 1994, thereby giving him a total of ten 200 hit seasons in his professional career.|$|E

25|$|You {{hear a lot}} {{of third}} baseman raving about the hard chances they get, but any time the shortstop is looking for a berth that is nice and quiet and restful in {{comparison}} to his own he casts longing glances at third. Look up the records and see what becomes of the shortstops who get too old to cover all the ground between second base and the <b>foul</b> <b>line.</b> A lot of them camp on third for a while. And why shouldn't they? A man can play third when he can't play short. That's a cinch.|$|E
25|$|The {{conventional}} bowling footwork styles {{use either}} a four- or five-step approach beginning 8 to 16 feet (2.4 to 4.8 meters) behind the <b>foul</b> <b>line.</b> In the typical four-step approach, {{the ball is}} {{pushed away from the}} body in step one; step two has the ball {{at the bottom of the}} backswing; in step three, the ball is at the top of the backswing; finally, the ball is swung forward and delivered in conjunction with the fourth and final slide-step. In a five-step approach, the bowler takes an initial timing step before pushing the ball away from the body.|$|E
25|$|In tournaments within {{countries}} like Taiwan where they use house conditions, spinning {{can be an}} advantage over rolling. However, when tournaments use the more conventional oil patterns, where the oil is laid from the <b>foul</b> <b>line</b> to about 40 feet, and is dry up to the pin rack, spinning loses its advantage since friction exists. Carry is also a more reliable and consistent technique of knocking pins down on the first ball, as spinning is less predictable in terms of pin deflection, and at times can result in odd leaves - including the 5-pin and wash-outs when missing the 1-pin.|$|E

25|$|In {{the top of}} the sixth, Allen hit a one-out {{double to}} the fence in center field. With two outs, Moore doubled to right, driving in Allen and {{narrowing}} Hilldale's lead to one run. In the bottom of the sixth, Hilldale had runners on first and third with one out, and Thomas hit a fly caught by Allen in short right near the <b>foul</b> <b>line.</b> Carr tried to score from third, and was gunned down on the relay from Allen to Hawkins to Duncan. Kansas City's only hit in the last three innings was a one-out double by Duncan in {{the top of the}} seventh, so they were unable to catch Hilldale.|$|E
25|$|There is {{an optimal}} bowling ball {{speed at which}} the player maximizes the chance to knock down all ten bowling pins. Optimal ball speed, which {{is defined as the}} time it takes for the ball to travel from one foot past the <b>foul</b> <b>line</b> to the head pin, is 2.3 seconds (this number can shift to 2.2 or 2.4 {{depending}} on the dryness or slickness of the lane). A ball that is rolled too fast will not give the pins enough time to “mix” with other pins, or in other words, to knock each other down in a domino effect motion. Conversely, a ball rolled too slowly will deflect too much and {{will not be able to}} knock down all the pins.|$|E
25|$|There are {{systematic}} ways {{of using}} the lane arrow marks and approach dots {{to make it easier}} to line up a shot, increasing consistency of hitting the pins at the correct location every time. For beginners, it also helps eliminate fear of the channels, and places the focus solely on the lane. Most bowlers are taught to utilize the arrows, as the arrows are nearer to the point where a hooking ball starts to hook back towards the pins. Other bowlers utilize the dots if they find themselves pulling their body up at the <b>foul</b> <b>line</b> (the shoulders should stay level throughout the entire approach,) as this is usually caused by them thinking that the arrows are too far out at the lane. Advanced players often use the lane boards themselves to line up shots that require them to aim between arrows.|$|E
50|$|Baseball {{is played}} in a {{quadrant}} of fair territory between <b>foul</b> <b>lines.</b> The official minimum distance from home plate to the nearest fence, stand or other obstruction is 250 ft, and the recommended distances are at least 325 ft along the <b>foul</b> <b>lines</b> and 400 ft in centre field. This produces a recommended fair territory field area just over 100000 sq ft. Most Major League Baseball parks have fair territory areas {{in the range of}} 110000 to 120000 sq ft.|$|R
50|$|In baseball, {{there are}} two ways for a batted ball to be out-of-bounds. If a ball is hit between the <b>foul</b> <b>lines</b> and exits the field of play, it is a home run, at the batter and {{teammates}} who are on base run to home plate and score a point for their team. If the ball is hit outside the <b>foul</b> <b>lines</b> (such as to the side or behind the batter), it is a foul ball, and is equivalent to a strike. The foul ball bounds do not apply to fielders, who are allowed to try to catch a foul ball, which would put the batter out. While the rules of baseball define the angle of the <b>foul</b> <b>lines,</b> there are no set rules as to how large a field should be, and it varies from baseball field to baseball field.|$|R
50|$|Foul poles, if present, help umpires {{judge whether}} a fly ball hit above the fence <b>line</b> is <b>foul</b> (out of play) or fair (a home run). The poles are a {{vertical}} {{extension of the}} <b>foul</b> <b>lines</b> {{at the edge of}} the field of play. The outer edge of the <b>foul</b> <b>lines</b> and <b>foul</b> poles define foul territory. Both the lines and the poles are in fair territory, in contrast to football and basketball, where the lines marking the playing boundaries are out of bounds.|$|R
25|$|For various formulaic purposes, {{physicists}} divide rotation {{into three}} components, assigning portions to x, y and z axis that are mutually perpendicular. For bowling, the x-axis {{can be assigned}} to a line that {{is parallel to the}} <b>foul</b> <b>line,</b> the y-axis to the line parallel to the boards, and the z-axis to the vertical. Forward-roll is rotation about the x-axis, side-roll is rotation about the y-axis and mid-roll (or spin) is rotation about the z-axis. The pure full-roller delivery is a combination of forward- and side-roll only. Semi-rollers include spin. Spinners may have very little side roll. In a very strict physics sense, a ball may be delivered with rotation, but usually not in a roll, because that would imply complete traction. The technique of the great majority of bowlers involves a delivery that starts the ball in a skid that evolves into a roll that hooks into the pins.|$|E
25|$|The Jazz, {{who were}} undefeated {{at home in}} the postseason coming into the series, had their most {{cohesive}} effort in a 109-83 Game 3 rout. Utah pestered Duncan into early foul trouble and got baskets from players other than Williams and Boozer, who had combined for 57.7% of their team's points through the first two games. But Jazz fans' euphoria over the team's only series victory gave way to frustration in Game 4 – with most of it aimed at Ginóbili and his flopping. 11 of his 16 fourth-quarter points came at the <b>foul</b> <b>line</b> in an ugly overall team performance in which the Spurs made more free throws (30) than field goals (28). Contributing to that discrepancy were four technical fouls called against Utah in the fourth. The subsequent ejections of Utah headcoach Jerry Sloan and Jazz guard Derek Fisher had a charged-up EnergySolutions Arena crowd raining debris onto the court in protest.|$|E
25|$|In baseball, a Chinese home run, also a Chinese homer, Harlem home run, or Pekinese poke, is a {{derogatory}} and archaic {{term for}} a hit that just barely clears the outfield fence at its closest distance to home plate, essentially the shortest home run possible in the ballpark in question, particularly if the park {{is known to have}} an atypically short fence to begin with. The term was most commonly used in reference to home runs hit along the right field <b>foul</b> <b>line</b> at the Polo Grounds, home of the New York Giants, where that distance was short even by contemporary standards. When the Giants moved to San Francisco in 1958, the Los Angeles Coliseum, temporary home of the newly relocated Los Angeles Dodgers, took over the reputation for four seasons until the team took up residence in its permanent home at Dodger Stadium in 1962. Following two seasons of use by the expansion New York Mets in the early 1960s, the Polo Grounds were demolished, and the term gradually dropped out of use.|$|E
