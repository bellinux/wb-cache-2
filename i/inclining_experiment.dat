To conduct ship model inclining {{experiments}} and floating state adjustment experiments, a static experiment system is developed, including {{research and development}} of hydrostatic flume, connecting frame, attitude instrument and data acquisition and analysis processing module. And the work principle of the system is discussed. Furthermore, ship model <b>inclining</b> <b>experiment,</b> floating state adjusting experiment, and roll, pitch, heave free decay experiment are conducted to analyse the performance of this system. Results of the experimental indicate that the system has a satisfactory testing precision. In the model inclining experiments, relative error of vertical coordinate of center of gravity of the ship model is 1. 5 %, relative error of the longitudinal coordinate is 0. 18 %; in the floating state adjusting experiment, standard error of transverse inclination is 0. 06 degree, standard error of longitudinal inclination is 0. 03 degree, standard error of heaving measurement is 0. 15 mm; the free decay experiment proofs that the experiment system can realize dynamic measurement of roll, pitch and heave. This experimental system with high precision has a good application prospect which can be used in ship model <b>inclining</b> <b>experiment,</b> floating state adjusting experiments, as well as model hydraulic performance test study...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe <b>inclining</b> <b>experiment</b> is {{typically}} performed for all new-build ships and after any major refit. The {{purpose of the}} <b>inclining</b> <b>experiment</b> is to establish the vertical distance of the centre-of-mass of the ship above its keel in the lightship condition. This value is then taken as the point of reference when loading the ship, for establishing the ‘in-service’ stability, throughout {{the life of the}} ship. Experimental uncertainty analysis is commonly utilised in hydrodynamic testing to establish the uncertainty in a result {{as a function of the}} input variables. This can in turn be utilised to establish an interval about the result that may be expected to encompass a large fraction of the distribution of values that could reasonably be attributed to the measurement. This paper provides a methodology for calculating a confidence interval for the location of the centre-of-mass of a ship from an inclining experiment; and ultimately, in any load condition. The uncertainty compared to an assumed metacentric height of 0. 15 m is provided for four classes of ship: buoy tender 0. 15 ± 0. 15 m (± 100 %); super yacht 0. 150 ± 0. 033 m (± 22. 0 %); supply ship 0. 150 ± 0. 047 m (± 31. 3 %), container ship 0. 150 ± 0. 029 m (± 19. 3 %), ropax 0. 150 ± 0. 077 m (± 100 %) ...|$|E

The paper that follows discusses the suitability of the yacht for its proposed use, describes the design development process undertaken, identifies the main regulatory issues and proposes essential modifications required for the yacht to be operated safely offshore. To assess the yacht’s general suitability for sail training purposes a preconversion evaluation was undertaken to establish initial stability characteristics, accommodation requirements, likely cost considerations, appropriate tankage capacities, estimated speed, range, confirmation of the installed power requirement and suitability of the existing sail plan. For calculation of the data presented in the paper various analytical methods were employed based {{on a combination of}} first principles engineering methodologies and those defined by the regulatory authorities. Having established the suitability of the vessel for the intended purpose detailed analysis was undertaken to assess compliance with the main regulatory requirements for intact stability, damage stability and structural safety of the yacht which also included analysis of the rig engineering. The findings of the study concluded that with the reconfiguration of the interior and addition of watertight bulkheads/doors the vessel would be suitable for use as an offshore sail training yacht. However, as the investigation was conducted with data and drawings supplied from the builder and without viewing the yacht it was recommended that a full pre-purchase survey and <b>inclining</b> <b>experiment</b> be conducted.

40|$|It is a {{well-known}} fact that the current method for calculating a ship's vertical centre of gravity following inclining experiments is limited when considering magnitude of applied heel angle and accuracy achieved for certain hull-forms due to the assumption of unchanged metacentre position when the vessel is heeled.

40|$|The {{project was}} {{undertaken}} {{as it was}} considered that, with an ever {{increasing number of people}} taking to the water in yachts, current survival equipment was not up to the task of offering maximum safety to the crews and vessels when compared to related technological advances in other industries. To assess if {{there is a need for}} a new product, the project investigates a number of key areas. Initially the history of accidents at sea, specifically looking into the 1979 Fastnet and 1998 Sydney-Hobart races, previous accounts from sailors who have lost vessels and been stranded at sea and accident statistics. It then investigates what is currently on offer in the way of survival equipment in the marine industry and considers these against safety equipment in comparable industries. After concluding that current systems, especially liferafts, have a large number of publicised shortcomings, a new design/ concept was conceived. The design utilises current liferaft technology and using a design employed in the aeronautical industry as its basis, incorporates an inflatable collar into the hull of the vessel. This design addresses all of the identified drawbacks and provides great improvements to vessel stability, crew safety and recovery. To test the design all the data was entered into stability calculations. The results from this proved better than expected. A 1 / 8 th scale model was created using a Whitbread 60 hull. This model was subjected to an <b>inclining</b> <b>experiment,</b> the results of which were compared to the theoretical results for the same model to test the accuracy of the calculations. The results from both methods were very close. This proved that the theoretical method can be used to accurately predict increases in stability. In both cases the experiment was deemed a complete success. The latter section of the report suggests ways in which the design can be incorporated into the hull to offer maximum results, whilst requiring as little effort from the crew as possible. It then investigates how to further develop the project and lists potential issues associated with a development program. These are overcome by the recommendation of introducing the design to a company who already has experience at producing marine safety systems. It also gives recommendations to the marine industry as to how best to improve the regulations for marine safety equipment so that a universal standard can be rapidly adopted...|$|E

This thesis focuses on experiments performed with stationary fires to carefully study instabilities observed in spreading fires that suggest {{they play a}} critical role in fire spread. Two types of flow conditions were used to perform experiments similar to wildfire spread conditions: sloped fuel surface and forced-flow (wind aided). Small- scale <b>inclined</b> <b>experiments</b> for performed at the University of Maryland with liquid- fuel soaked wicks and large-scale experiments at the USDA Forest Service Missoula Fire Sciences Laboratory with a gas-burner. These experiments were performed with over a range of heat-release-rates and burner sizes for angles from 0 to 60 degrees from the horizontal. Forced-flow experiments were performed in a large-scale wind tunnel at the Missoula Fire Laboratory and at the University of Maryland with a well characterized wind blower with gas-burners. These experiments were performed for a range of heat-release-rates and burner sizes in wind speeds from 0. 2 to 3. 0 ms&# 8722; 1 The flame geometry was determined using high-speed videography. Important two-dimensional flame geometry parameters such as centerline flame length and flame tilt angle were measured from these images. Flame intermittency and pulsation close to the surface was measured using high-speed videography and micro-thermocouples. A method was developed to track the extension of the flame close to the surface which would come in direct contact with unburnt fuels ahead of the fire. These methods showed that the pul- sation frequency is complicated suggesting large scale structures in the flow. Using these frequency the stationary experiments follow similar Strouhal-Froude scaling for flame pulsations in spreading fires. Stream-wise streaks in the flow were observed and measured using high-speed videography. Streak spacing has been observed to be associated with possible Gotler votice structures in the fire. The spacing for streaks at the base of the flame for these startionary experiments appear to be dependent on the boundary- layer conditions and could possibly scale with the centerline flame length similar to flame towers observed in spreading fires...|$|R

In Experiment 3, the ball rolled down the incline and was stopped at the end; participants were asked to draw with the hand in air the trajectory that would be described by the ball if it kept moving. We found that performance was most accurate when motion of the ball was visible until interception and haptic feedback of hand-ball contact was available (Experiment 1). However, even when participants punched an imaginary moving ball (Experiment 2) or drew in air the imaginary trajectory (Experiment 3), they were able to extrapolate to some extent global aspects of the target motion, including its path, speed and arrival time. We argue that the path and kinematics of a ball rolling down an incline can be extrapolated surprisingly well by the brain using both visual information and internal models of target motion...|$|R
40|$|History {{offers many}} {{examples}} of dictators who worsened their behaviour significantly over time (like Zimbabwe’s Robert Mugabe) as well as dictators who displayed remarkable improvements (like Jerry Rawlings of Ghana). We show that such mutations can result from rational behaviour when the dictator’s flow use of repression is complementary to his accumulated stock of wrongdoings. Interacting this complementarity with uncertainty over the dictator’s degree of impunity in relation to wrongdoing (such that the dictator becomes <b>inclined</b> to <b>experiment</b> along this dimension), produces {{an environment in which}} any individual rising to power can end up as either a moderate leader, or as a dreaded tyrant. Our model shows that dictators are more likely to derail with higher levels of divertible funds available, for example stemming from fungible aid inflows or from the exploitation of natural resources. It furthermore suggests that derailment is accidental and that such leaders suffer from ex-post regret. Consequently, increasing accountability can be in the interest of both the public and the dictator.
