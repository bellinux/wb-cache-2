Total of 15 microcosm tanks (each 3 replicates for control and 4 treatments; low and high concentrations of simetryn and <b>iprobenfos)</b> having plankton community which transported from natural lake, were prepared. Water temperature of the tanks was kept at approximately 15 °C during the experiment. The experiment was conducted during 12 days, and the chemicals were applied to the treatment tanks on day 2. Although zooplankton abundance decreased soon after the application of <b>iprobenfos</b> with high concentration, {{no significant differences in}} zooplankton abundances were observed among the treatments. For the changes of species composition, application of simetryn induced more diverged composition among the treatments. The results showed that both herbicide and fungicide have less apparent direct impact on zooplankton abundance within short period. However, changes in diversity and species composition induced by simetryn suggest the possibility that structure of zooplankton can be altered by the herbicide application...|$|E

To clarify the molecular basis {{of interaction between}} the fungus and various abiotic stresses including fungicides, we constructed a cDNA library from germinated conidia of Colletotrichum acutatum, a major anthracnose pathogen of pepper (Capsicum annum L.). Over 1, 000 cDNA clones were sequenced, of which single clone exhibited significant nucleotide sequence homology to ABC transporter genes. We isolated three fosmid clones containing the C. acutatum ABC 1 (CaABC 1) gene in full-length from genomic DNA library screening. The CaABC 1 gene consists of 4, 059 bp transcript, predicting a 1, 353 -aa protein. The gene contains the typical ABC signature and Walker A and B motifs. The 5 ′-flanking region contains a CAAT motif, a TATA box, and a Kozak region. Phylogenetic and structural analysis suggested that the CaABC 1 is a typical ABC transporter gene highly conserved in various fungal species, {{as well as in}} Chromista, Metazoans, and Viridiplantae. We also found that CaABC 1 was up-regulated during conidiation and a minimal medium condition. Moreover, CaABC 1 was induced in <b>iprobenfos,</b> kresoxim-methyl, thiophanate-methyl, and hygromycin B. These results demonstrate that CaABC 1 is necessary for conidiation, abiotic stress, and various fungicide resistances. These results will provide the basis for further study on the function of ABC transporter genes in C. acutatum...|$|E
