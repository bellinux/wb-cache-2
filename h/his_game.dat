5|$|After {{losing the}} title, Steinitz played in tournaments more {{frequently}} than he had previously. He won at New York 1894, and was fifth at Hastings 1895 (winning the first brilliancy prize for <b>his</b> <b>game</b> with Curt von Bardeleben). At Saint Petersburg 1895, a super-strong four player, multi-round-robin event, with Lasker, Chigorin and Pillsbury, he took second place. Later his results began to decline: 6th in Nuremberg 1896, 5th in Cologne 1898, 10th in London 1899.|$|E
5|$|Australian openside David Pocock, who {{was also}} shortlisted for the IRB award, admires the way he reads the game {{as well as his}} ability to read the referee. One of McCaw's {{strengths}} is his ability to re-invent himself. For example, he adapted quickly to changes in the breakdown laws (e.g., the 2008 the Experimental Law Variations (ELVS) and the 2010 New IRB Law Interpretations) and, over time, other areas of <b>his</b> <b>game.</b>|$|E
5|$|Barton {{has been}} {{described}} as having a good work ethic and the ability to carry the ball and retain possession for the team. He has been praised for having a good passing range. This aspect of <b>his</b> <b>game</b> has shown improvement since the 2005–06 season, when he began to favour simpler passes over more ambitious ones, and his relatively high pass completion rate can be attributed to this change. Barton's passes have often proved to be crucial; in the past he has led the way in his team's assists.|$|E

5|$|But {{the player}} {{primarily}} responsible for elevating the Modern Benoni {{to the status of}} a major opening was Mikhail Tal, who took up the opening in 1953 after seeing one of Nezhmetdinov's games. The tactical positions it led to were a perfect fit for Tal's combinatorial gifts and he crushed many opponents in brilliant style. Famous examples include <b>his</b> <b>game</b> against Bukhuti Gurgenidze at the 1957 USSR championship, excerpted below, and his win against Yuri Averbakh at the same tournament the following year.|$|E
5|$|Chappell's battles {{against the}} short-pitched bowling of Snow {{during the season}} {{compelled}} him to reappraise <b>his</b> <b>game.</b> Following a conversation with Sir Donald Bradman, he decided to reinstate the hook shot and spent the winter months practising the stroke by hitting baseballs thrown by his brother Greg. Although he still regularly lost his wicket after playing the shot, Chappell felt that the psychological benefit of showing aggression to opposing bowlers offset the times that he was dismissed for a low score.|$|E
5|$|Despite seeing <b>his</b> <b>game</b> time reduced further under Jardim, Ocampos was {{nominated}} for the European Golden Boy award in October 2014, though the award was eventually won by Liverpool's Raheem Sterling. Having started only seven matches {{by the end of}} January 2015, Ocampos requested a move away from the principality and was granted his wish with a transfer to Ligue 1 rivals Marseille.|$|E

5|$|During {{the fourth}} {{round of the}} 2011 German Chess Championships, Falko Bindrich was late to <b>his</b> <b>game</b> and tournament {{director}} Ralph Alt declared the game lost on Bindrich's arrival after a few minutes. Bindrich {{refused to accept the}} penalty and withdrew from the tournament shortly after, and went on to blog about the double standards of arbiters, claiming that he had seen several other players arrive late in the previous rounds, and no penalty was issued to them.|$|E
5|$|Edmund McMillen from Team Meat, the {{developer}} of the indie game Super Meat Boy, created various accounts on PETA's official forums {{to try to}} get <b>his</b> <b>game</b> parodied by PETA. PETA developed Super Tofu Boy and released it in December 2010. It stars Tofu Boy, an anthropomorphic cube of tofu whose goal is to rescue Bandage Girl, the girlfriend of the original game's protagonist Meat Boy, from Meat Boy. It plays as a standard platformer and is peppered with inter-level pro-vegetarian messages and facts about meat consumption and the livestock industry.|$|E
5|$|Ehrhoff {{is known}} as an {{offensive}} defenceman. He has strong skating ability, which allows him to quickly carry the puck up the ice, starting plays from his team's defensive zone, as well as join offensive plays deep in the opposing team's zone. He also possesses a hard shot, which earns him significant time on the power play. Upon joining the NHL with San Jose, he had to adjust <b>his</b> <b>game</b> to be more defensive. He gradually became counted upon more in defensive situations and has been used on the penalty kill, as well.|$|E

5|$|Essentially a stylist, Kippax was {{in every}} sense a great batsman, for he could suit <b>his</b> <b>game</b> {{to the needs of}} the occasion. A {{beautiful}} driver to the off, he cut at times in delightful fashion, the slower wickets of England affecting his abilities in that direction in only the slightest degree.|$|E
5|$|Having joined Marseille's academy {{at the age}} of seven, Stéphane Sparagna {{spent his}} {{formative}} years developing <b>his</b> <b>game</b> in the club's La Commanderie academy. His progression into the first team was halted in September 2013, however, when he was forced to undergo surgery following a meniscus injury to his right knee which ruled him out for several months. Upon recovery, and following the appointment of former Argentina coach Marcelo Bielsa as manager, Sparagna made his noncompetitive debut for Marseille alongside fellow academy graduate Jérémie Porsan-Clemente in a friendly clash with Benfica in July 2014.|$|E
5|$|He {{was never}} booked or sent off {{throughout}} his entire career, and teammate Jimmy Armfield noted that Matthews would never retaliate {{to the many}} extremely physical challenges opponents would often make to try and take {{him out of the}} game. Indeed, he ran the full gauntlet of emotions that all footballers run, but always retained a level head on the pitch, never losing his temper or allowing his emotions to affect <b>his</b> <b>game.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Mystery Studio's {{director}} and CTO is Gabriel Gambetta. He is a noted Linux proponent, developing <b>his</b> <b>games</b> exclusively under Fedora Linux and cross-compiling them for Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X, the two platforms that <b>his</b> <b>games</b> are actually on sale for. The studio shut down after {{he moved from}} Uruguay to Zürich and accepted a job at Google.|$|R
5|$|Jovanovski {{is known}} as a two-way defenceman. Able to {{contribute}} offensively, he is an adept puck-carrier and joins plays deep in the opposing team's zone. He plays defence physically, bodychecking opponents primarily with his shoulder. In both aspects of <b>his</b> <b>game,</b> he is considered to play {{with a high level of}} risk, taking the chance of being out of position in favour of a good scoring chance or a hit.|$|E
5|$|Murray {{is known}} for {{being one of the}} most {{intelligent}} tacticians on the court, often constructing points. Other strengths in <b>his</b> <b>game,</b> although not huge parts of <b>his</b> <b>game,</b> include a well-disguised drop shot and his net game. As he plays predominantly from the baseline, he usually approaches the net to volley when finishing points more quickly. Murray is most proficient on a fast surface, like grass, where he has won eight singles titles including the Wimbledon Championships and the 2012 Olympic Gold Medal, although hard courts are his preferred surface. He has worked hard since 2008 on improving his clay court game, ultimately winning his first clay titles during 2015 at Munich and Madrid, as well as reaching his first French Open final during 2016. While Murray's serve is a major weapon for him, with his first serve reaching speeds of 130mph or higher on some occasions and winning him many free points, it can become inconsistent when hit under pressure, especially with a more vulnerable and slower second serve. Since his 2011 season and Ivan Lendl's coaching, Murray has played a more offensive game and has also worked to improve his second serve, forehand, consistency and mental game which have all been crucial to his further success.|$|E
5|$|Originally called Capsule Monsters, the game's title {{went through}} several {{transitions}} due to trademark difficulties, becoming CapuMon and KapuMon before eventually settling upon Pocket Monsters. Tajiri {{always thought that}} Nintendo would reject <b>his</b> <b>game,</b> as the company did not really understand the concept at first. However, the games {{turned out to be}} a complete success, something Tajiri and Nintendo never expected, especially because of the declining popularity of the Game Boy. Upon hearing of the Pokémon concept, Miyamoto suggested creating multiple cartridges with different Pokémon in each, noting it would assist the trading aspect.|$|E

It is particularly unfortunate that Buckle also did not record <b>his</b> <b>games,</b> as detailed information {{would have made it}} possible to compare Bledow with leading English players such as Howard Staunton. Buckle was considered England's second strongest player after Staunton; in fact some of Staunton's enemies argued that Buckle was the better player.|$|R
5|$|Philippe Poisson (born 1984), {{better known}} as Phil Fish, is a French-Canadian former indie game {{designer}} {{best known for his}} work on the 2012 platform game Fez published by his company, Polytron Corporation. He {{was born and raised in}} Quebec, where his experiences with Nintendo games in his youth would later influence <b>his</b> <b>game</b> design. He studied game design at the Montreal National Animation and Design Centre, and worked at Ubisoft and Artificial Mind and Movement before starting Polytron in 2008.|$|E
5|$|Robinett, as a {{means to}} {{maintain}} his name on <b>his</b> <b>game,</b> included a hidden message in Adventure identifying himself as the creator, inspired by the supposedly hidden messages left on various songs recorded by The Beatles. In discussing the game in 2015, Robinett considered the message {{as a means}} of self-promotion, noting that he had been paid only around $22,000 a year from Atari without any royalties, while Atari would sell a million units of a game at $25 a piece. This secret is one of the earliest known Easter eggs in a video game.|$|E
5|$|Ron Gilbert, {{the creator}} of the Monkey Island series, has jokingly {{expressed}} a bitterness towards Pirates of the Caribbean, specifically the , for its similarities to <b>his</b> <b>game.</b> Gilbert has also stated that On Stranger Tides, a novel by Tim Powers which was adapted into the , was the principal source of inspiration for his video games.|$|E
