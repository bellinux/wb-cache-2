60|$|Rumour {{had long}} {{declared}} at Stoneborough that the member's little daughter was carefully secluded {{on account of}} some deformity, and Mrs. Pugh {{had been one of}} many ladies who had hoped to satisfy their curiosity on this head upon the present occasion.

By way of salve to his feelings, the sympathizing lady had suggested that the preference for London advice might be from the desire of secrecy, and improbable as he knew this to be, his vanity had forbidden him to argue against it. When no little Miss Rivers appeared, the notion of her affliction gained ground, and Leonard, whose <b>gray</b> <b>back</b> was undistinguishable from other gray backs, heard Mrs. Pugh citing his brother as an authority for the misfortune which Mr. and Mrs. Rivers so carefully concealed as to employ no surgeon from their own neighbourhood.|$|E
