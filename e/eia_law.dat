50|$|The Environmental Impact Assessment Law (<b>EIA</b> <b>Law)</b> {{requires}} that {{an environmental impact}} assessment be completed prior to project construction. However, if a developer completely ignores this requirement and builds a project without submitting an environmental impact statement, the only penalty is that the environmental protection bureau (EPB) may require the developer to do a make-up environmental assessment. If the developer does not complete this make-up assessment within the designated time, only then is the EPB authorized to fine the developer. Even so, the possible fine is capped at a maximum of about US$25,000, {{a fraction of the}} overall cost of most major projects. The lack of more stringent enforcement mechanisms has resulted in a significant percentage of projects not completing legally required environmental impact assessments prior to construction.|$|E
40|$|The Environmental Impact Assessment Law (<b>EIA</b> <b>Law)</b> of the People's Republic of China {{was adopted}} on 28 October 2002. It {{is the most}} {{progressive}} legislation addressing environmental issues in China to be developed over the past decade. The new <b>EIA</b> <b>Law</b> explicitly states that environmental impact assessment (EIA) is required for both new construction projects and plans. The types of plans covered by the new <b>EIA</b> <b>Law</b> include: (1) integrated plans for land use and regional development, development of drainage areas and marine areas; (2) specific plans for industry, agriculture, animal husbandry, forestry, energy, water management, transportation, urban construction, tourism {{and the development of}} natural resources. EIA for construction projects has been implemented in China for more than 20 years. Through this new <b>EIA</b> <b>Law,</b> the legal status of EIA for construction projects has been elevated from administrative legislation to State Law. EIA for plans is a type of strategic environmental assessment (SEA) where the concept of SEA is for the first time being advocated by the State at this level.

40|$|This paper {{draws on}} {{a survey of the}} 32 {{environmental}} impact assessment (EIA) reports approved in Malawi after six years of mandatory EIA. With the aim of assessing {{the extent to which the}} requirements of the EIA process have been complied with and determining which EIA components influenced the apparent compliance, it is shown that the quality of the reports is poor, with most of the EIA requirements being unsatisfactorily adhered to. The components that contributed to the poor quality are analysis of alternatives, consultation and public participation, scoping and environmental audit. Substance problems that affect the adequacy of the EIAs, practice problems dealing with the administration of the EIA process, and contextual problems and deficiencies in the <b>EIA</b> <b>law</b> are specifically identified as the flaws responsible for the poor quality. It is thus recommended, for EIA quality to improve, that the flaws be addressed, and particularly the factors which are inducing them. ...|$|E
40|$|Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) {{has evolved}} and {{become part of}} major project {{requirements}} in many countries. However, its contribution to sustainable development and reduction in poverty levels of people affected by projects has not been assessed in developing countries. The study examined environmental laws and institutions in selected African countries, compared <b>EIA</b> <b>laws,</b> procedures and practices. Their effects on sustainable development and reduction in poverty are discussed. What is found lacking is the full integration of environmental assessments into planning and decision-making processes of these countries. At present EIA is applied mainly at the project level in these countries. It concluded that Africa {{is on the right}} footing towards sound environmental protection and resource management, but increasing poverty and lack of direct investment in project communities, illiteracy and corruption remains the greatest threat to the success of EIA. It recommends that corporate social responsibility with a fixed percentage of profit be made part of EIAs. It enjoins that a critical mass of a project’s community be empowered to actively participate in the early phases of the EIA process to improve benefits to communities and society at large.

40|$|One {{of the key}} {{strategies}} for achieving sustainable development {{is the use of}} the process of evaluating the potential environmental impacts of development activities. The procedure of environmental impact assessment (EIA) implements the principle of integration which lies {{at the core of the}} concept of sustainable development by providing a process through which potential social, economic and environmental impacts of activities are scrutinised and planned for. Sustainable development may not be achieved without sustained and legally mandated efforts to ensure that development planning is participatory. The processes of public participation play a crucial role in ensuring the integration of the socio-economic impacts of a project into the environmental decision-making processes. Public participation is not the only process, nor does the process always ensure the achievement of sustainable development. Nevertheless, decisions that engage the public have the propensity to lead to sustainable development. The public participation provisions in South Africa’s EIA regulations promulgated under the National Environmental Management Act 107 of 1998 show a disjuncture between the idea of public participation and the notion of sustainable development. The provisions do not create a framework for informed participation and leave a wide discretion to environmental assessment practitioners (EAPs) regarding the form which participation should assume. In order for environmental <b>law,</b> specifically <b>EIA</b> <b>laws,</b> to be effective as tools to promote sustainable development the laws must, among other things, provide for effective public participation. The judiciary must also aid in the process by giving content to the legal provisions on public participation in the EIA process...|$|R

It first describes the evaluation process of EA (environmental impact assessment (EIA)) and SEA, then the current Chinese SEA application mechanism which was established by the Chinese <b>EIA</b> <b>Law</b> (2003) and subsequent laws and regulations. A comparative analysis is undertaken between the Chinese SEA system, the UK system and the Canadian SEA application systems. To clearly understand how SEA is applied in the road transport infrastructure development field, two SEA cases and one EIA case, and a questionnaire study, were carried out to obtain evidences of the actual situation of SEA application in this area. Conclusions were made to clearly describe those deficiencies existing in the current administration system, legal system and application framework and actual practices of SEA application in China.

40|$|The {{enactment}} {{and implementation}} of the 2003 <b>EIA</b> <b>Law</b> in China institutionalised the role of plan environmental impact assessment (PEIA). While the philosophy, methodology and mechanisms of PEIA have gradually permeated through the various levels of government with a positive effect on the process and outcome of urban planning, only a few cities in China have so far carried out PEIA as a Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) -type procedure. One such case is the southern city of Shenzhen. During the past three decades, Shenzhen has grown from a small town to a large and booming city as China has successfully and rapidly developed its economy by adopting the “reform and open door” policy. In response to the challenges arising from the generally divergent processes of rapid urbanisation, economic transformation and environment protection, Shenzhen has incrementally adopted the SEA concept in developing the city's Master Urban Plan. As such, this paper reviews the effectiveness of PEIA in three ways: •as a tool and process for achieving more sustainable and strategic planning; •to determine the level of integration of SEA within the planning system; and, •its effectiveness vis-à-vis implementation. The implementation of PEIA within Shenzhen's Master Urban Plan offers important insights into the emergence of innovative practices in undertaking PEIA as well as theoretical contributions to the field, especially in exploring the relationship between PEIA and SEA and highlighting the central role of local governing institutions in SEA development. ...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} public {{participation}} (PP) process of {{environmental impact assessments}} (EIA) of three large scale hydropower plant (HP) case studies in Nepal, {{with the aim of}} improving the PP process to accommodate the interests and needs of local citizens impacted by these HPs. The degree of utilization of PP into EIA is determined by the willingness of proponents (an individual conceptualization of the owner of the HP construction) to share decision-making with citizens. It is the theoretical standpoint of this thesis that improvements to the PP process can only be implemented within a given context wherein the proponent allows it. With reference to O’faircheallaigh (2010) such proponent allowance is set by their purposes for utilizing PP. Through a comparison between the PP process as it is written in the Nepali <b>EIA</b> <b>law,</b> the execution of it by proponents and the citizen experience with this execution, discrepancies are identified and analysed in accordance to why they are seen and what they imply in terms decision-making processes. Recommendations for improving the PP process as experienced by citizens is proposed by seeking solutions to overcome the identified discrepancies and secondly through new methods and timing of PP. Three authors have been put to use for this theoretical exercise: Sherry R Arnstein and her theory on the Ladder of Citizen Participation, The article from O’faircheallaigh (2010) on purposes for utilizing PP and UNEP (2004) on “good practice” in timing and methods of PP into EIA.

40|$|Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) {{has gained}} {{increasing}} prominence {{as a means}} of accommodating the goals of sustainability in development planning since the 1990 s. However, SEA faces considerable difficulties before it becomes a widely accepted and enduring practice. The concepts of SEA and sustainability are complex. SEA has necessarily to deal with a variety of planning and decision-making contexts, and in addition there is a problem of integrating SEA with planning. This combination of factors makes the future role of SEA in environmental planning highly challenging. Literature on sustainability, environmental assessment, and planning suggests that application of sustainability-led and context-dependent principles for SEA can assist in the realization of goals of sustainability. Meanwhile, the effective integration of SEA and planning processes can serve as a means by which sustainability objectives, urban planning practice and SEA application might be addressed. Central to this integration are institutional arrangements which define the extent to which SEA can promote sustainability. This research has been designed to explore the opportunities offered by SEA to provide the degree of strategic connectivity required to strengthen the position of sustainability concerns in the formulation of policies and planning. In particular, it defines the requisite principles and institutional conditions for using SEA as a tool for facilitating sustainability in the context of urban planning in Chinese cities. The research employs a primary case study design, and multiple data and analytical methods which have involved surveys, key informant interviews, secondary data and direct observation. SEA was introduced as part of the 2003 Chinese environmental impact assessment (<b>EIA)</b> <b>law</b> for use with government plans and programs at various levels. The incorporation of SEA into the master plan for city development in the city of Dalian was the first attempt at the use of SEA in any Chinese city and was designed to serve as a demonstration project for other cities to follow. However, the Dalian SEA case was not successful, highlighting the difficulty of facilitating sustainability goals and achieving integration with the planning process. The problems were complex but could be reduced to two major issues: lack of explicit guidelines or principles for the application of SEA, and fundamental institutional impediments. The research concluded that to increase the effectiveness of SEA application in China it is imperative to formulate a set of explicit and sustainability-based principles for SEA and reform the institutional arrangements for environmental assessment and planning, enabling the integration of SEA and planning processes...|$|E

It concludes that the Philippine EIS system, in spite of some shortcomings, performed satisfactorily though implementation and enforcement ha/ {{a lot of room for}} improvement. [...] The Philippines has one of the most comprehensive <b>EIA</b> <b>laws</b> and policies in Southeast Asia. The Philippine Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) System has undergone four phases of implementation as evidence that there is a continuous effort in improving its application. Originally conceived as a regulatory tool, the EIS system has slowly moved to being a management tool to aid decision makers in selecting the best alternative after examining the trade offs between social needs, environmental concerns and economic and financial viability of a project or activity. Recent reforms in the EIA implementing rules and regulations are expected to further enhance the administration and overall utility of EIA in the Philippines. [...] The Philippine EIS System is well advanced in comparison with Southeast Asia and some Western EIA systems. It has strong legal and regulatory frameworks and guidelines and procedures for its implementation are well set up. Through time, there have been amendments such as the social acceptability concept to enhance public participation, specific guidelines for scoping and the requirement of Environmental Guarantee and Monitoring Funds for compliance monitoring, which aimed at improving EIA implementation. However, compliance and enforcement are still insufficient due to the inherent problem of lack of financial and human resources and political support. [...] Donor agencies have been influential in the formulation and improvement in EIA implementation in the Philippines. The initial environmental policy in the Philippines that was formulated with the assistance from the US government became the foundation of the preceding environmental laws and policies. The Philippines has obtained a fair amount of EIA technical assistance from bilateral and multilateral donors to support institutional capacity building and to train EIA implementors, project proponents and non-government organisations and to build and upgrade environmental management facilities and equipment. Donors have little influence in the actual conduct of EIA in the Philippines. The Philippine EIS system has the same requirements and procedures from local and foreign-funded projects and all project proponents are required to comply.

40|$|Local-level Sustainability Assessment {{has been}} a new policy {{instrument}} that {{has been a}}dvocated by policy communities to enhance the promotion of sustainable development. Its origin {{can be traced back}} to the earlier idea of Environmental Impact Assessment which was the first generation of sustainability assessment tools. Nowadays, most of the countries have enacted the <b>EIA</b> into <b>law</b> and regulation and provided a comprehensive impact assessment system on different environmental aspects so as to minimize the impacts by the development. The Social Impact Assessment was also introduced in some countries so as to mitigate the impacts on the local community and culture. Later, Strategic Environmental Assessment was also suggested in policy making process so as to provide a territorial level planning assessment. Still, there is a missing part in developing sustainability assessment tools at the local level. The concept of sustainable development was firstly introduced in 1999 by the Government of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. The Council for Sustainable Development, which its members are appointed by the Chief Executive and the Sustainable Development Division of the Environment Bureau, are mainly responsible for this issue. However, the effectiveness of promoting sustainable development is being questioned. Though there is a relatively long development on local planning, there is a lack of tools for Sustainability Assessment in the local level. In a short term, it is a big challenge to develop a local-level sustainability assessment. In a long term, a local-level sustainability assessment can help evaluate the overall sustainability performance of the District. This study, aims to conceptualize and evaluate the current sustainability assessment system so as to consolidate a better Sustainability Assessment system for the local planning in Hong Kong. published_or_final_versionUrban Planning and DesignMasterMaster of Science in Urban Plannin...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 107 - 111). Recent {{studies indicate}} that the population of Cape Town generates approximately 2. 2 milliontons of waste annually. Numerous waste minimization strategies have been developed whichhave not been successful in reducing the amount {{that needs to be}} disposed of at a landfill site. This results to mounting pressure on existing waste disposal sites thus necessitating an urgentneed for a new regional landfill. According to CCA Draft Environmental Impact Report (2006),the former Cape Metropolitan Council (CMC) appointed technical consultants in 2000 to identifyand assess the potential sites for a landfill to service Cape Metropolitan Area (CMA), presentlyreferred to as the City of Cape Town (CCT). The construction of a landfill has significant impacts on the environments. It is for that reason Integrated Environmental Management (IEM) has to be followed to assess the impacts. The principle of IEM is broadly interpreted as applying to the planning, assessment, implementation and management of any project proposal or activity that has a potentially significant effect on the environment. Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) process, which lies {{in the heart of the}} IEM, is enforced to examine the environmental effects of development. These impacts are directly related to the physical location of the project. That makes site selection for proposed project a very important stage of the <b>EIA</b> process. <b>Laws</b> have been enacted to minimizeenvironmental impacts, including strict guidelines for siting landfills. Using landfill siting criteria and site selection methods, the technical consultants identified four potential sites, Atlantis being the only site falling within the City of Cape Town. The interviews, backed by secondary data sources such as websites and project reports, revealed that the techniques used to identify potential sites for the landfill, even when combined are costly and time consuming. Several scenarios were run using various ArcGIS extensions, including the ModelBuilder to identify sites that met the stated criteria. GIS analysis yielded agreeable results with the recommendations from the consultants who used techniques other than GIS to identify the regional landfill. The research findings demonstrate that GIS is an efficient and dependable stand-alone technique that can be implemented in landfill site studies thus expedite the decision making process...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the chapter}} is to revisit the ICJ {{judgment}} Pulp Mills on the River Uruguay case, decided in 2010, in order to appreciate {{the evolution of the}} <b>EIA</b> under international <b>law</b> and its relationship with other fundamental international law principles and rulesof international law. The scope is limited to transboundary EIAs. After briefly analysing the most significant international decisions regarding the duty to undertake an EIA, the question that will be answered is not to assess whether, but how and under which circumstances an EIA must be undertaken. It will be argued that an EIA is a flexible tool and that its content is impossible to define in general terms under customary international law, except for some basic requirements, including public consultation, which must be considered as a fundamental part of the process. As a consequence, EIAs must be shaped according to the geographical area and the type of project under analysis. The article will then explore the relationship between the duty to undertake an EIA, on the one hand, and some “traditional” principles of international environmental law, such as, for example, the “do not harm” principle. The second part will examine the relationship of EIAs with sustainable development, precaution, biodiversity, and human rights. It may be stated that transboundary EIAs have evolved from an element of the general obligation of due diligence in the prevention and control of transboundary harm, therefore with a focus on inter-State procedure, to an essential component of the relation human rights-environment. It will eventually be argued that the relation human rights-environment must also include a gender dimension...|$|R
40|$|When {{the local}} {{authorities}} establish a plan for land use planning, they have to judge if the influence on the environment could be of such a grade {{that they have to}} make a special Environmental Impact Assessment (<b>EIA),</b> following national <b>laws</b> and EU-directives. The laws for the process in Sweden is set by the Swedish Parliament, with advisory given by the central government authority, the National Board of Housing, Building and Planning, Boverket. For EU, the laws is set by the European Parliament and the Council. The laws and directions for this process have been changed for Sweden in recent years, and the aim {{of this study was to}} compare the contents of three different Environmental Impact Assess¬ments to see if there has been any change in appearances and content in later years, as well as to see if different municipalities and authors have effect on the EIAs. According to different studies some of the EIA done are without insufficient focus on main environmental issues in the EIA, or even that some information is missing. In some studies there are arguments that the EIA should be a document that should be possible to read alone. These aspects has also been studied in the material. The result is partly described in a matrix where different criteria is compared between the three EIAs to spot differences easily. There is also a part where the content and structure of the three EIAs is compared in text. The result of the study was that there are big differences in structure, while their content has more in common. In one of the three Environ¬mental Impact Assessments much facts are only put in other documents. The conclusion of the study is that there is a need for implementing a common way of presenting the content of an EIA. There is a risk that facts are overlooked that are not presented in the EIA document. There is also a risk that {{the local authorities}} has too big interest in implementing the plan and that they make the EIA with a biased look. As a case study an EIA was done. In the case study, the experience of the study is used to make this EIA as complete as possible, with regards to the criteria from the analysis matrix. Also, it was written in a report structure to test this model. The case study is added as Appendix 4...|$|R
