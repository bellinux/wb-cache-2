40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the perceptions of high school freshmen regarding the image of agriculture and the barriers to enrolling <b>in</b> an <b>agricultural</b> class.

Both groups of students indicated that no individual would have any influence on their reasons for enrolling or not enrolling <b>in</b> an <b>agricultural</b> education class; however, findings revealed that both groups of students indicated that they were enrolled <b>in</b> an <b>agricultural</b> education class or probably would enroll in a class because of reasons other than the intended purposes of the class...|$|R

5|$|Proposed {{methods for}} {{controlling}} gopher populations <b>in</b> <b>agricultural</b> areas include poisoning dandelions, clover, carrots, {{sweet potatoes and}} parsnips. Camas pocket gophers are larger than other gophers, so conventional gopher traps may fail to capture them.

30|$|The {{structural}} transformation {{over time}} created a different configuration in forms of wage growth, and {{the ratio of}} export to import in these sectors (see Tables  11, 12).

In addition, in 1973, the ratio of export to import was 17.2 <b>in</b> the <b>agricultural</b> sector and 0.24 in the manufacturing sector.
