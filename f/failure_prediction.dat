40|$|Many {{investigations}} {{of the strength of}} window glass have been based on a glass <b>failure</b> <b>prediction</b> model developed at Texas Tech University. The model accounts for the geometrically non-linear load-response of thin glass plates, the time-dependence of glass strength, and the statistical variability of strengths. The model has been widely applied to derive practical design rules for window glass subject to wind loading. However, the glass <b>failure</b> <b>prediction</b> model is fundamentally flawed because it implies that the probability of failure is effectively independent of the load at the time of failure and it implies that the ‘shape ’ of the strength distribution is unaffected by the stress history.

SCOPE O RIGINALLY INTRODUCED TO explain the hole size effect in laminated com-posites without resorting to inherent flaws and fracture mechanics concepts, the average stress failure criterion was found to result in remarkably good quantita-tive strength predictions for composites containing cutouts [1, 2].

Thus, the effects on <b>failure</b> <b>predictions</b> of substantial combined stresses and mixed-mode fracture have not been thoroughly investigated.

Firstly, contrary to expectations, models that show bad performance results with the original coefficients reveal an improvement after re-estimation of the coefficients, while models that perform well reveal a decrease in performance. On average, the <b>failure</b> <b>prediction</b> power of the models deteriorates after re-estimation of the coefficients.
