50|$|The main {{entrance}} into Short Cave {{is at the}} end of a shallow valley where a small hole drops into a stream passage. Upstream leads to a canal passage which becomes too tight, although an excavated squeeze on the right before the end leads to the Coal Hole entrance. Downstream, 100 m of mainly low passage leads to an oxbow with a larger passage arriving from Rift Entrance. A long awkward <b>inlet</b> <b>passage</b> called Masochist Passage can be followed to the north-east for some 300 m almost up to the Rumbling Hole stream sinks, and an old high level route named Ancient Highway loops back to the main route.|$|E

The main passage continues for about 300 m up to 15 m high and 5 m wide, under a boulder bridge wedged across the passage, to finish in a choke in a roof chamber. The water then follows a narrow meandering canyon to the first waterfall pitch of 5 m, and continues to a second pitch of 8 m {{at the base of}} which the water disappears into a choked sump pool.

50|$|Eden Sike Cave {{is a small}} cave in Mallerstang in the Eden {{valley in}} Cumbria, England 400 m north of Hell Gill. The {{entrance}} is 391 m north west of an obvious resurgence in a small shakehole. This drops into a passage where a wet crawl leads downstream towards the resurgence, and a roomier passage going upstream. The upstream passage soon deteriorates into more awkward going which eventually passes a small but awkward climb into an <b>inlet</b> <b>passage</b> up to the right. The main passage goes to a sump some 9 m long which has been passed to a further 15 m before becoming too tight. The right-hand passage passes a section of sharp, steeply angled rock (Bacon Slicer Rift) into a chamber where the way on is a tight, wet passage where the airspace becomes minimal.|$|E

50|$|A {{climb down}} in the small shakehole soon leads to a tight 15 m pitch. At the bottom the passage passes beneath the aven where Wade's Entrance joins, and after a further 80 m it goes round a series of bends to where the last pitch of OBJ Hole enters. There is a chamber after a further 30 m where a small stream enters from an <b>inlet</b> <b>passage.</b> Downstream a {{succession}} of climbs and a 14 m pitch reach the main pitch of 77 m. South-East Passage in Gaping Gill may be stepped into at the -38 m level, but the shaft continues in two stages as South-East Pot to a 29 m deep pool. This is a window into a large underwater passage, and dye tests {{have shown that the}} water from Gaping Gill Main Chamber and from Stream Passage Pot flow through this passage. Above the final shaft there is a tight passage, Horrocks-Stearn Crawl, which connects to Bar Pot above its main pitch.|$|E
50|$|By {{the mid-1960s}} {{a number of}} advancements {{had been made in}} cave diving, by which method speleologists had {{extended}} their explorations into caves beyond the sumps that would normally have halted progress. In December 1966 divers Dave Cobley and Mike Boon made preparations to dive Sump 1 in Skreen Hill passage. Before making the dive however, they investigated a small dry passage leading off on the left bank of the lake, finding the way on blocked by unstable boulders in the roof. The cavers removed one of the boulders to reveal a way on, which led via a dry route {{to the far side of}} Sump 1. The new 200 m section of river passage beyond was named Skreen Hill 2, and a further 1/2 mi <b>inlet</b> <b>passage</b> was named Legnabrocky Way. A notable feature of the Legnabrocky Way is the Giant's Hall, a large chamber 60 m long, 30 m high and 15 m wide (200×98×49 ft). Despite only carrying a small stream, the Legnabrocky Way is the largest section of passage in Marble Arch Cave.|$|E
50|$|The {{entrance}} {{lies within}} a shakehole {{where a small}} hole between blocks leads to a ledge {{at the top of}} a 26 m shaft. This lands in a chamber with a narrow rift passage leading off which degenerates into the Craven Crawl, 200 m of low, wet passage. At a junction with an inlet, the passage enlarges into Stagger Passage, 600 m of walking and stooping. At the start of a deep canal it passes a passage on the left which is the main way to the alternative entrance of Oddmire Pot. The canal passage continues to meet a major junction at Hammerdale Dub, where over a 1000 m of upstream passages also lead back towards Oddmire Pot. Downstream, 1500 m of boulder-strewn streamway finishes where the water disappears under a wall, but a small passage leads into Boireau Falls Chamber, at the base of which it is possible to regain the stream. This finishes at Nemesis, a 20 m shaft below which a route through a tight and complex boulder choke leads into Gasson's Series. This is initially a high streamway which degenerates into a low wet section, beyond which the passage continues for 100 m before arriving at Poseiden Sump, which has been dived for some 20 m to where it became small. Back at the low pool, an dry <b>inlet</b> <b>passage</b> of fine rift passage and chambers continues for over 1100 m before decreasing in size, and dropping into the large New Fearnought Streamway. Downstream leads to Dementor Sump, which has been dived for 20 m to a blockage. Upstream terminates in a boulder blockage after 230 m.|$|E
50|$|The current {{entrance}} is through {{an opening in}} a small shakehole. This drops into a well-decorated rift passage, {{which was part of}} the former show cave. A levelled floor reaches a boulder choke which once had a flight of steps leading over it; this is now covered by a boulder collapse. The show cave terminated at a 5 m waterfall. Above this, a long, mainly low, wet passage reaches a sump after several hundred metres. This is the first of three short sumps separated by short sections of passage. The fourth sump has been dived for 24 m to an underwater boulder choke. The cave has no <b>inlet</b> <b>passages</b> in its 1000 m length.|$|R

50|$|The Rankine {{cycle is}} {{sometimes}} referred to as a practical Carnot cycle because, when an efficient turbine is used, the TS diagram begins to resemble the Carnot cycle. The main difference is that heat addition (in the boiler) and rejection (in the condenser) are isobaric (constant pressure) processes in the Rankine cycle and isothermal (constant temperature) processes in the theoretical Carnot cycle. In this cycle a pump is used to pressurize the working fluid which is received from the condenser as a liquid not as a gas. Pumping the working fluid in liquid form during the cycle requires {{a small fraction of the}} energy to transport it compared to the energy needed to compress the working fluid in gaseous form in a compressor (as in the Carnot cycle). The cycle of a reciprocating steam engine differs from that of turbines because of condensation and re-evaporation occurring in the cylinder or in the steam <b>inlet</b> <b>passages.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Balderstone {{described}} the entrance shaft to Death's Head Hole {{in detail in}} 1881 in Ingleton - Bygone and Present, and plumbed it at 200 ft:Here is another chasm like the Fairies' Workshop, not so richly adorned, but still radiant in its embellishments, yet possessing a most remarkable configuration, indeed, that {{of the head and}} jaws of a human skeleton. The main shaft of the hole represents the mouth; a bridgelike bar of rock passes across the eastern verge, but is hollow below, so as to connect the chasm with a more shallow cavity beyond. The most peculiar feature, however, consists in a second bar-like bridge of limestone somewhat more slender than the first, spanning the secondary rift in exactly the opposite direction to that assumed by the former, so as to meet the greater bar in the middle of its course and form part of the same trellice bridgework. In this manner two cavities, like those of the orbits in a skull are produced; and the result is wonderfully curious and fine.The first descent was by the Yorkshire Ramblers' Club in 1889, when they reached the bottom of the Main Chamber, and noted the stream entering from the east. In 1892 the cave was referred to as [...] "Hell Hole" [...] by the local historian and writer Harry Speight, who mistakenly reported that [...] "the true bottom has never been reached". The <b>inlet</b> <b>passage</b> in Lost Johns' Cave was noted by the Yorkshire Ramblers on their original exploration in 1928, but the water was assumed to originate from Gavel Pot. The connection with Lost Johns' Cave was opened up, by a team from a variety of clubs, in 2011.|$|E
5000|$|Further {{progress}} required apparatus {{which could}} overcome the depth limitation of breathing pure oxygen. In 1955 using an aqualung and swimming with fins, Bob Davies {{reached the bottom}} of the 11th chamber at 15 m depth in clear water and discovered the 12th and 13th chambers. Unfortunately, he got separated from his guideline and the other two divers in the 11th chamber, ending up spending three hours trapped in the 13th chamber and had much trouble getting back to safety. Opinion hardened against the use of the short-duration aqualung in favour of longer-duration closed-circuit equipment. Likewise, the traditional approach of walking along the bottom was preferred over swimming. Employing semi-closed circuit nitrogen-oxygen rebreathers, between 1957 and 1960 John Buxton and Oliver Wells went on to reach the elbow of the sump upstream from the ninth chamber at a depth of 22 m. This was at a point known as [...] "The Slot", the way on being too deep for the gas mixture they were breathing.A six-year hiatus ensued while open circuit air diving became established, along with free-swimming and the use of neoprene wetsuits.

5000|$|Vaimalō, is {{a village}} in the western {{district}} of Vavaʻu in Tonga. Vaimalō was named {{by one of the}} most revered and beloved chiefs in Vava'u's history the great Finau Fisi. The village became the sole estate of his only child and son Naufahu Mapilitoa. In 1781 right off the coast of Longomapu, it was Finau Fisi in his double hulled war canoe the Talito'a who met the Spaniard explorer Don Francisco Antonio Mourelle the first European to discover Vava'u. With his supplies depleted and sailing the last three days without water it was by luck Don Francisco Antonio Mourelle and his crew found the <b>inlet</b> <b>passage</b> {{to the middle of the}} main island. In his journal Don Francisco Antonio Mourelle wrote of the great size of the 10 double hulled war canoes that encircled his ship as they anchored off the coast of Longomapu. The first thing the captain asked for when Finau Fisi met him was water, upon understanding his request Finau Fisi not only gave the explorer and his crew water but replenished their food supplies, took care and stayed with them the 2 weeks they spent in Vava'u. Don Francisco Antonio Mourelle being grateful for the initial water given to him by Finau Fisi kept thanking him in Spanish; [...] "Gracias aqua, gracias aqua" [...] (thank you water, thank you water), hence the Tongan translation and the name of the village [...] "Vai - Water", [...] "Malō - Thank you". Before the passage of the Vavaʻu Land Acts (V.L.A) of 1849 and 1914 that effectively placed Vaimalō under government control, the whole of Vaimalō belonged only to Naufahu Mapilitoa and his family. Vaimalō's current general population is made up mainly of Naufahu Mapilitoaʻs immediate descendants, relatives, and friends from Niue, Fiji, Samoa, and Solomon Islands.|$|E

40|$|Emergency power {{stations}} and refineries often use the Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) method {{of cleaning up}} NOx from the exhaust of their stationary diesel or natural gas engines. In an SCR system, a reducing agent is injected into the exhaust gas stream where it mixes with the exhaust before passing through a bed of catalyst. Anhydrous ammonia, aqueous ammonia or a urea solution is used as the reducing agent. Urea is most often used because there are few safety issues involved with its storing and handling. Current methods rely on using single fluid injectors to deliver the urea solution into the exhaust. While this method has yielded some success, it has presented a series of problems that include nozzles clogging and non-optimal performance due to an uneven spray distribution. Today, {{it is believed that}} two–fluid nozzles would be better suited due to larger <b>inlet</b> <b>passages</b> and their ability to provide better control of drop size and flow distribution within the exhaust system. Today, there are no standard methods in use for selecting and optimizing two–fluid spray nozzles for NOx applications. This paper will propose a new method that will include an analysis of the critical elements of atomizer design and testing. This method consists of nozzle design considerations to reduce clogging, optimization of spray and drop size in order to achieve optimal results" 2, 4 ". Furthermore, this method will also evaluate the effects of "normal " operating parameters such as fluid flow rate, atomization pressure, and exhaust gas velocity on drop size. ...|$|R
40|$|The study {{concentrates}} {{on the effects of}} structural parameters of an electronic fuel injector on its dynamic response (the opening delay and the closing delay). The injector was developed for a marine medium-speed diesel engine. The dynamic response {{from the start of the}} control signal to the end of the needle valve closing were investigated. Firstly, a complete and detailed model of the electronic fuel injector was built and integrated into an optimisation model, where a MOGA was applied. Secondly, the importance and effects of main structural parameters on dynamic response were examined, as were their interactions. Finally, a Pareto optimum was obtained through scattering charts and comparisons were made between the baseline design and the optimal design. Results show that the control piston diameter, fuel oil <b>inlet</b> <b>passage</b> diameter, fuel oil outlet passage diameter and their interactions are influential factors to the opening delay, while the fuel oil <b>inlet</b> <b>passage</b> diameter has the dominant effect on the closing delay. A small control piston diameter together with a small fuel oil <b>inlet</b> <b>passage</b> diameter contribute to a short opening delay, however, they lead to a significant increase in the closing delay. Moreover, a small closing delay prefers a large fuel oil <b>inlet</b> <b>passage</b> diameter.
