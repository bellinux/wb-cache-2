40|$|We <b>explore</b> <b>procedures</b> {{to detect}} {{entanglement}} of unknown mixed states, {{which can be}} experimentally viable. The heart of the method is a hierarchy of simple feasibility problems, which provides sufficient conditions to entanglement. Our numerical investigations indicate that the entanglement is detected with a cost which is much lower than full state tomography. The procedure is applicable to both free and bound entanglement, and involves only single copy measurements. Comment: 8 pages, 9 figures, 4 table...|$|R

50|$|Another area of {{interest}} for Lindsay includes identification procedures for use with children’s eyewitness memory. The purpose of the studies conducted by Joanna D. Pozzulo and R.C.L.
