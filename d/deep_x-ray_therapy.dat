40|$|Background. Advanced {{basal cell}} {{carcinoma}} (BCC) is often treated by surgery or <b>X-ray</b> <b>therapy.</b> The consequences of <b>X-ray</b> <b>therapy</b> on the patients’ health-related quality-of-life (HRQOL) have {{so far not been}} described. Objectives. To quantify quality of life in BCC patients before and after <b>X-ray</b> <b>therapy</b> compared with matched healthy controls. Materials. Twenty-five patients (mean age 69) with BCC completed the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) before and two weeks and three months after <b>X-ray</b> <b>therapy</b> and their results were compared with the DLQI scores for 25 matched controls. Results. Compared to the healthy controls the patients' DLQI score was significantly higher before and 2 weeks after <b>X-ray</b> <b>therapy</b> (P= 0. 005; P= 0. 000).

Specific innovations included the world's first gantry-mounted linear particle accelerator for cancer treatment, installed in 1963, and numerous clinical uses of the radioisotope tracer technique, developed using radio-isotopes from the nuclear reactors at Amersham and Harwell, which became available to researchers after World War II. When the new department opened, Farmer was appointed first Professor of Medical Physics at Newcastle University in 1966. While at the RVI, Farmer and his team turned the facility into a renowned centre for research into medical applications of radio-isotope technology, providing services in these areas to the entire region of Northern England, which had previously had none. At the time of Frank Farmer's retirement in 1978, the department had branches in Teesside and Cumbria, as well as the three hospitals in Newcastle, and employed 70 scientific and technical staff.|$|R

40|$|<b>Deep</b> <b>X-ray</b> {{surveys have}} {{resolved}} {{much of the}} X-ray background radiation below 2 keV into discrete sources, but the background above 8 keV remains largely unresolved. The obscured (type 2) Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) {{that are expected to}} dominate the hard X-ray background have not yet been detected in sufficient numbers to account for the observed background flux. However, <b>deep</b> <b>X-ray</b> surveys have revealed large numbers of faint quiescent and starburst galaxies at moderate redshifts. In hopes of recovering the missing AGN population, {{it has been suggested that}} the defining optical spectral features of low-luminosity Seyfert nuclei at large distances may be overwhelmed by their host galaxies, causing them to appear optically quiescent in deep surveys. We test this possibility by artificially redshifting a sample of 23 nearby, well-studied active galaxies to z = 0. 3, testing them for X-ray AGN signatures and comparing them to the objects detected in <b>deep</b> <b>X-ray</b> surveys. We find that these redshifted galaxies have properties consistent with the deep field ``normal'' and ``optically bright, X-ray faint'' (OBXF) galaxy populations, supporting the hypothesis that the numbers of AGNs in <b>deep</b> <b>X-ray</b> surveys are being underestimated, and suggesting that OBXFs should not be ruled out as candidate AGN hosts that could contribute to the hard X-ray background source population.

The optical/UV continuum flux has a clear maximum near 2500 Å. The UV spectrum is very peculiar because it shows broad humps in addition to known emission lines.
