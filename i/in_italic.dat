5|$|Many modern revival fonts {{based on}} French renaissance {{printing}} {{are influenced by}} the work of Robert Granjon (c. 1513-90), particularly <b>in</b> <b>italic.</b> An engraver with a long and wide-ranging career, Granjon’s work seems to have ranged much more widely than Garamond’s focus on roman and Greek type, cutting type <b>in</b> <b>italic,</b> civilité (a cursive blackletter), and for the Vatican type in exotic alphabets including Arabic, Armenian and Hebrew. His career also took in stops in the Netherlands, Switzerland, Germany and finally for the last twelve years of his life Rome, where he ended his career {{in the service of the}} Vatican.|$|E

5|$|Distinctive {{features}} of Ehrhardt include an 'A' with gently curving bar matching the centre-link of the 'B', a wide 'T' with spreadeagled serifs {{on either side}} and a 'b' with no foot on the left. <b>In</b> <b>italic</b> the 'J' has a crossbar, the 'w' has sharp reverse curves towards the top and left, and the 'v' has a flourish on the left. The face has high stroke contrast (difference between thick and thin strokes) {{by the standards of}} most old-style serif fonts. In order to allow compact line spacing, descenders were kept reasonably short.|$|E

25|$|Georges Dumézil on {{the other}} hand {{proposed}} the theory of the irreducibility and interdependence of the three aspects (sovereignty, war, fertility) in goddesses that he interprets as an original, irreducible structure as hypothesised in his hypothesis of the trifunctional ideology of the Indoeuropeans. While Dumézil's refusal of seeing a Greek influence <b>in</b> <b>Italic</b> Junos looks difficult to maintain {{in the light of the}} contributions of archaeology, his comparative analysis of the divine structure is supported by many scholars, as M. Renard and J. Poucet. His theory purports that while male gods incarnated one single function, there are female goddesses who make up a synthesis of the three functions, as a reflection of the ideal of woman's role in society. Even though such a deity has a peculiar affinity for one function, generally fertility, i. e. the third, she is nevertheless equally competent in each of the three.|$|E
25|$|The letterforms of Caslon's roman, or {{upright type}} include an 'A' with a concave hollow at top left and a 'G' without a downwards-pointing spur at bottom right. The {{sides of the}} 'M' are straight. The 'W' has three {{terminals}} {{at the top and}} the 'b' has a small tapered stroke ending at bottom left. Ascenders and descenders are relatively short and the level of stroke contrast is modest in body text sizes. However, Caslon created subtly different designs of letter at different sizes, with increasing levels of fine detail and sharp contrast in stroke weight at larger sizes. Caslon's larger-size roman fonts have two serifs on the 'C', while his smaller-size versions have one half-arrow serif only at top right. <b>In</b> <b>italic,</b> Caslon's h folds inwards and the A is sharply slanted. The Q, T v, w, and z all have flourishes or swashes in the original design, something not all revivals follow. The italic 'J' has a crossbar and a rotated version was used by Caslon in many sizes on his specimens to form the pound sign.|$|E

500|$|The {{category}} of humanist sans-serif typefaces, which Gill Sans helped to define, saw great attention during the 1980s and 1990s, especially {{as a reaction}} against the overwhelming popularity of Helvetica and Univers in the 1960s and 1970s.

500|$|Garamond cut {{type in the}} 'roman', or upright style, <b>in</b> <b>italic,</b> and Greek.

500|$|Many {{editions of}} the Elegy have {{contained}} illustrations, some of considerable merit, such as those among the Designs by Mr. Bentley, for Six Poems by Mr. T. Gray (1753). But the work of two leading artists is particularly noteworthy. [...] Between 1777-8 William Blake was commissioned by John Flaxman to produce an illustrated set of Gray’s poems as a birthday gift to his wife. These were in watercolour and included twelve for the Elegy, which appeared {{at the end of}} the volume. Another individual book was created in 1910 by the illuminator Sidney Farnsworth, hand written <b>in</b> <b>italic</b> script with a mediaeval decorative surround and more modern-looking inset illustrations.|$|E
