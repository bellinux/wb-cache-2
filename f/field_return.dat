"Though I {{have been}} tender, heretofore," [...] writes he, [...] "of giving any opinion, or lodging complaints, as {{the change in}} that {{department}} took place contrary to my judgment, and the consequences thereof were predicted, yet finding that the inactivity of the army, whether for want of provisions, clothes, or other essentials, is charged to my account, {{not only by the}} common vulgar, but by those in power, it is time to speak plain in exculpation of myself. With truth then, I can declare, that no man, in my opinion, ever had his measures more impeded than I have by every department of the army. Since the month of July we have had no assistance from the quartermaster-general; and to want of assistance from this department, the commissary-general charges great part of his deficiency.... As a proof of the little benefit received from a clothier-general, and as a further proof of the inability of an army, under the circumstances of this, to perform the common duties of soldiers (besides a number of men confined to hospitals for want of shoes, and others in farmers' houses on the same account), we have, by a <b>field</b> <b>return</b> this day made, no less than two thousand eight hundred and ninety-eight men now in camp unfit for duty, because they are barefoot, and otherwise naked. By the same return, it appears that our whole strength in Continental troops, including the eastern brigades, which have joined us since the surrender of General Burgoyne, exclusive of the Maryland troops sent to Wilmington, amounts to no more than eight thousand two hundred in camp fit for duty; notwithstanding which, and that since the 4th instant, our numbers fit for duty, from the hardships and exposures they have undergone, particularly on account of blankets, have decreased near two thousand men.|$|E

The results of collecting and analyzing <b>field</b> <b>return</b> records of avionics are documented in this article. Our analysis shows that the exponential distribution is still appropriate for describing the life of most avionics manufactured over the past 20 years. Results also show that failure rates decrease at the introduction of products. An increasing trend in failure rate can be noted, for systems made after 1994, suggesting the need for further investigation...|$|E

The aim of this new methodology is to minimize the deficiencies of the traditional reliability prediction methods calculating a corrective factor using the available <b>field</b> <b>return</b> data. In this way is possible to realize more realistic reliability assessment also in the case of new products or products without historic data.

40|$|Testing {{integrated}} circuits {{with millions of}} transistors puts strong requirements on test volume, test application time, test speed, and test resolution. To overcome these challenges, it is widely accepted to partition test resources between the automatic test equipment (ATE) and the circuit under test (CUT). These strategies may reach from simple test data compression/decompression schemes to implementing a complete built-in self-test. Very often these schemes come with reduced diagnostic resolution. In this paper, an overview is given on techniques for embedding test into a circuit while still keeping diagnostic capabilities. Built-in diagnosis techniques may be used after manufacturing, for chip characterization and <b>field</b> <b>return</b> analysis, and even for rapid prototyping. 1...|$|E
