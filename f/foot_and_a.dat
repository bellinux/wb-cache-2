5|$|The {{queen conch}} is herbivorous {{and lives in}} {{seagrass}} beds, although its exact habitat varies by development stage. The adult animal has a very large, solid and heavy shell, with knob-like spines on the shoulder, a flared thick, outer lip and a characteristic pink-coloured aperture (opening). The flared lip is absent in younger specimens. The external anatomy of the soft parts of L.gigas {{is similar to that}} of other snails in its family; it has a long snout, two eyestalks with well-developed eyes, additional sensory tentacles, a strong <b>foot</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> corneous, sickle-shaped operculum.|$|E
5|$|The {{western end}} of the chamber is closed off with a slab {{measuring}} about 4.42 metres (14 feet, 6 inches) wide, with a thickness of 30 centimetres (1 <b>foot)</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> depth of around 2.44 metres (8 feet). A collapsed, broken slab lies at the chamber's opening, eastern end. It {{is also possible that}} a largely rectangular slab {{at the bottom of the}} slope had once been part of the chamber's eastern end. Excavation has revealed that flint masonry was used to pack around the chamber and support its sarsens; 20th-century renovation has seen this largely replaced with cement, allowing the stones to continue standing upright.|$|E
5|$|The Simpson family spent Christmas in England, {{before a}} trip to Saint-Gervais-les-Bains, where Simpson injured himself skiing, {{suffering}} a broken <b>foot</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> sprained ankle. He recovered, riding six-day races. At the Antwerp six-day, he dropped out {{on the fourth day}} with a cold. His cold worsened and he missed most of March. He abandoned Milan–San Remo {{at the foot of the}} Poggio. On 11 April, he finished seventh in Paris–Roubaix after crashing in the lead group. The crash forced him to miss the Tour of Flanders as he struggled to walk on his injured foot. In Liège–Bastogne–Liège he attacked with 's Felice Gimondi, catching an early break. They worked together for , until Gimondi gave up. Simpson rode alone before slipping on oil mixed with water; he stayed with the front group, finishing tenth.|$|E

5|$|The {{causes of}} plantar {{fasciitis}} {{are not entirely}} clear. Risk factors include overuse such as from long periods of standing, an increase in exercise, and obesity. It is also associated with inward rolling of the <b>foot</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> lifestyle that involves little exercise. While heel spurs are frequently found it is unclear {{if they have a}} role in causing the condition. Plantar fasciitis is a disorder of the insertion site of the ligament on the bone characterized by micro tears, breakdown of collagen, and scarring. As inflammation plays a lesser role, many feel the condition should be renamed plantar fasciosis. The diagnosis is typically based on signs and symptoms with ultrasound sometimes used to help. Other conditions with similar symptoms include osteoarthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, heel pad syndrome, and reactive arthritis.|$|E

The regiment numbered a total of 933 officers and men, and was brigaded with four companies of the 1st <b>Foot</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> battalion of the 60th Foot.|$|E
25|$|There {{were other}} bow fibula {{variations}} of the 2nd and 3rd centuries AD. The Divided Bow type has an arched bow and a long foot. The arch {{was made up of}} two, or even three, separate, but parallel, arches. These arches are either wide and flat or narrow and tall. The Trident fibula has a rounded arch and long <b>foot</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> wide, flat head plate with three points. The entire fibula looks like a trident. Claims that this was the standard fibula of the Roman navy are unfounded.|$|E
25|$|Essex forded {{the river}} Blackwater at Affane, where {{he held a}} council of war in his tent, {{allowing}} Norris 1,100 <b>foot</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> company of horse to pursue the war in Munster. He marched unhindered eastward through Lord Power's country to Waterford City, where he was received with two Latin orations and a joyful concourse of people on June 21. The army was ferried across the river, from Munster to Leinster, an operation that took a frustrating length of time, and Essex left Waterford on June 22.|$|E

25|$|On 20 October 1897, {{an attempt}} by a British force to take the {{strongly}} held Dargai Heights was beaten back, leaving three battalions pinned down under heavy fire from above and unable to withdraw. They were reinforced by the 1st Gordons, who were ordered to advance through the open ground and storm the heights, led by their five pipers. Findlater was wounded before reaching the hillside, with a superficial wound to his left <b>foot</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> broken right ankle. Unable to walk, he pulled himself to a boulder, propped himself up, and continued to play to encourage the advance. The infantry following behind successfully reached the hillside, climbed the heights, and dispersed the defenders.|$|E
25|$|Rebuilt, and {{now with}} three decks, Surrey {{departed}} Sheerness on 29 September 1818 and England on 17 October, sailing via Rio to reach Port Jackson on 4 March 1819, 156 days out from Sheerness. The surgeon was Matthew Anderson. Surrey had embarked 160 male prisoners, of whom three died on the voyage. She landed seven in Port Jackson and then she sailed. On 18 March, 152 days after leaving England, she reached Van Diemen's Land. Here she disembarked her remaining 150 prisoners. She returned to Port Jackson from the Derwent about 21 April with general cargo, remaining for three months before setting sail for London on 23 July.She took with her detachments of the 48th and 84th Regiments of <b>Foot,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> cargo of hides, whale and seal oil, sealskins, wool, coconut oil and tan.|$|E
25|$|Telescopic {{fishing rods}} are {{designed}} to collapse down to a short length and open to a long rod. 20 or even 30ft rods can close to {{as little as a}} <b>foot</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> half. This makes the rods very easy to transport to remote areas or travel on buses, compact cars, or public buses and subways. Telescopic fishing rods are made from the same materials as conventional multi-piece rods. Graphite, carbon, and sometimes fibreglass, or composites of these materials, {{are designed to}} slip into each other so that they open and close. The eyes on the spinning rods are generally, but not always, a special design to aid in making the end of each section stronger. Various grade eyes available in conventional rods are also available in telescopic fishing rods. The eyeless Tenkara style rods are also of this type and are typically made from carbon and/or graphite.|$|E

25|$|In 1936 the War Memorial Drive {{was planted}} with 75 poplars, {{each with a}} cross at the <b>foot</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> plaque honouring {{individual}} Old Newingtonians who died during World War II. The trees were replaced by a new avenue of trees in 1966 and the plaques were replaced by a tablet on a plinth with the inscription: Lest We Forget – This plaque was dedicated on 24September 1966, to mark the planting of trees alongside the War Memorial Drive by the Old Newingtonians' Union to restore those originally planted by the Union on 29February 1936. By this act Old Newingtonians remember those Old Boys who gave {{their lives in the}} service of God, King and Country, and whose names are recorded on the War Memorial of the School. Fifty of the original plaques remain in the archives collection. In 1979 the War Memorial Drive was realigned and replanted and the 1966 plinth was moved to the Millner Gates end of the drive.|$|E
25|$|Following their {{exit from}} the FA Cup the {{previous}} weekend, a trip to Pride Park to play bottom-placed Derby County on 15 March looked {{to be the perfect}} opportunity for the Red Devils to bounce back and show their title credentials. However, the game did not prove as simple as one would have expected, as United had to work hard for their narrow 1–0 victory. As was the case with many of Manchester United's games in the 2007–08 season, luck was not on their side in the opening exchanges of the game. United goalkeeper Ben Foster, making his debut due to the unavailability of Van der Sar and Tomasz Kuszczak, then staked his claim to the number 1 jersey with a pair of fine saves from Derby striker Kenny Miller. Cristiano Ronaldo proved to be the thorn in Derby's side on a number of occasions, testing former Manchester United goalkeeper Roy Carroll with a curling effort hit with the outside of his <b>foot</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> 40-yard free kick. The breakthrough finally came in the 76th minute, Ronaldo scoring a deserved goal from a Wayne Rooney cross. With Arsenal only managing a draw against ten-man Middlesbrough in the day's late kick-off, United's win put them on top of the table on goal difference with a game in hand.|$|E
25|$|Treadmill {{training}} (more {{commonly known}} as body weight supported treadmill training) can be applied via manual (therapist) or robotic assistance. In manual treadmill training the therapists provide assistance to facilitate an upright posture and a normal stepping pattern. Therapist assistance may be provided at the patient’s pelvis, leg and <b>foot,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> third therapist controlling the treadmill settings. In robotic-assisted treadmill training, a device replaces the need for therapists to assist the patient in generating a normal stepping pattern. Currently, there are three different models available: Hocoma's Lokomat, the HealthSouth AutoAmbulator, and the Mechanized Gait Trainer II. The Lokomat is a driven gait orthosis that consists of a computer -controlled exoskeleton that secured to the patient’s legs while being supported over a treadmill. In addition to a belt driven treadmill and an overhead lift, the HealthSouth AutoAmbulator also includes a pair of articulated arms (that drives the hip and knee joints) and two upright structures that house the computer controls and body-weight unloading mechanism. Unlike the first two, the Mechanized Gait Trainer II does not work {{in conjunction with a}} treadmill; instead it is based on a crank and rocker gear system which provides limb motion similar to an elliptical trainer. Robotic-assisted treadmill training was developed with three goals in mind: 1. to decrease therapist physical demand and time, 2. to improve repeatability of step kinematics, and 3. to increase volume of locomotor training.|$|E
