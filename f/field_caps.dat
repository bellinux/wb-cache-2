25|$|Cassini Plasma Spectrometer (CAPS): The CAPS is {{a direct}} sensing {{instrument}} that measures the energy and electrical charge of particles that the instrument encounters (the number of electrons and protons in the particle). CAPS measured the molecules originating from Saturn's ionosphere and also determine the configuration of Saturn's magnetic <b>field.</b> <b>CAPS</b> also investigated plasma in these areas {{as well as the}} solar wind within Saturn's magnetosphere. CAPS was turned off June 2011 due to an electrical short circuit that occurred in the instrument. The instrument was powered on in March 2012; after 78 days a second short circuit forced the instrument to be again shut down.|$|E
25|$|Infantry uniforms were {{basically}} redesigned Zhongshan suits. Puttees were standard for soldiers and officers alike since the primary mode of movement for NRA troops was by foot. Troops were also issued sewn <b>field</b> <b>caps.</b> The helmets {{were the most}} distinguishing characteristic of these divisions. From the moment German M35 helmets (standard issue for the Wehrmacht {{until late in the}} European theatre) rolled off the production lines in 1935, and until 1936, the NRA imported 315,000 of these helmets, each with the Blue Sky with a White Sun emblem of the ROC on the sides. These helmets were worn by both elite German-trained divisions and regular Central Army divisions. Other helmets include the Adrian helmet, Brodie helmet and later M1 helmet. Other equipment included straw shoes for soldiers (cloth shoes for Central Army), leather shoes for officers and leather boots for high-ranking officers. Every soldier was issued ammunition, ammunition pouches or harness, a water flask, combat knives, food bag, and a gas mask.|$|E
500|$|According to {{survivor}} accounts, {{before dawn}} on August 15 the H Company mortar platoon {{became aware of}} enemy activity near Hill 303. The platoon leader telephoned G Company, 5th Cavalry, which informed him a platoon of 60 South Korean troops would come to reinforce the mortar platoon. Later {{in the morning the}} platoon saw two North Korean T-34s followed by 200 or more enemy soldiers on the road below them. A little later a group of Koreans appeared on the slope. A patrol going to meet the climbing Korean troops called out and received in reply a blast of gunfire from automatic weapons. The mortar platoon leader, Lt. Jack Hudspeth, believed they were friendly. Some of the Americans realized that the advancing troops were North Korean and were going to open up on them according to former Pvt. Fred Ryan and Pvt. Roy Manring, when they revisited the old mortar position in 1999. Hudspeth ordered them not to fire and threatened them with a court-martial if they did. The rest of the watching Americans were not convinced that the new arrivals were enemy soldiers until the red stars became visible on their <b>field</b> <b>caps.</b> By that time, they were extremely close to the American positions. The North Korean troops came right up to the foxholes without either side firing a shot. Hudspeth ordered his platoon to surrender without a fight as it was far outnumbered and outgunned. The North Koreans quickly took [...] the mortarmen captive. Estimates of the number captured range from 31 to 42.|$|E

50|$|Mountain troops wore {{distinctive}} stiff <b>field</b> <b>caps</b> with semi-rigid visors and ear flaps. They wore loose winter shirts, {{under which}} additional layers could be worn.

A similar design of the <b>field</b> <b>cap</b> was previously used in Germany as the distinguishing headgear of the German 's ski cap, the only differences being the bill was slightly extended and the top panel of the hat had a smaller circumference, giving it slightly sloped-in sides. The design and its successors that are still in use today are the German counterparts to the American patrol cap or utility cover.|$|R

50|$|During {{the twentieth}} century the czapka {{became one of the}} symbols of Polish {{national}} independence. After World War I, the new Polish Army adopted a four-pointed form as its standard issue national headdress {{in the form of a}} rogatywka. After 1952 this czapka style hat was replaced by a round peaked cap of Soviet style, apart from soft <b>field</b> <b>caps,</b> which retained rogatywka style. However in 1982 the rogatywka re-appeared as the headdress of the ceremonial honour guard protecting Belvedere Palace. Officers of the modern Polish Army wear the four sided cap in certain orders of dress, although berets are the normal headdress.|$|E
50|$|In the {{operational}} area {{the majority of}} the soldiers of the regiment wore one-piece tank uniforms and peaked <b>field</b> <b>caps</b> with neck flaps. On base, standard Rhodesian camouflage was worn with a black beret, fitted with the sable badge illustrated on this page. 'T' Troop wore the Corps of Signals badge. The fitter section wore the Army Service Corps badge. All badges were underpinned by the maroon and yellow regimental colours on an enameled plaque. The stable belt was red with the unfortunate inclusion of two yellow stripes, for which members were sometimes mocked. Thus, the olive-green webbing belt was worn in preference by many members.|$|E

50|$|AVRK {{officers}} {{received the}} early ARK service peaked cap in both light khaki and white-topped versions, which was copied after the French M1927 pattern (French: Casquette d’officier Mle 1927) to wear {{with either the}} light khaki or white service dress uniforms. The peaked caps were worn with the standard gilt metal FARK cap device bearing the Cambodian Royal Arms. Ground and flight personnel generally wore the standard ARK headgear of the period, which consisted of French M1946 and M1957 light khaki sidecaps (French: Bonnet de police de toile kaki clair Mle 1946 and Bonnet de police de toile kaki clair Mle 1957), M1946 tropical berets (French: Bérét de toile kaki clair Mle 1946), M1949 bush hats (French: Chapeau de brousse Mle 1949) and light khaki cotton baseball cap-style <b>field</b> <b>caps.</b>|$|E

Later, a khaki patrol cap resembling a simplified baseball cap version was adopted as the standard ANK fatigue headgear for all-ranks, though the South Vietnamese ARVN fatigue cap in OG cotton cloth, whose shape recalled the US Marines utility cap, was sometimes seen. [...] In addition, {{a wide range of}} OG or camouflage jungle hats and baseball caps also found their way into the ANK from the US, South Vietnam and Thailand though they never displaced entirely the earlier headgear.

5000|$|At {{the same}} time the M34 side-cap was {{introduced}} for enlisted wear, a foldable <b>field</b> <b>cap</b> for officers was authorized.

Insignia were jacquard-woven; although no chinstrap was authorized officers often added the Schirmmütze silver cords. This cap was officially replaced by the officers' Schiffchen M38, with a wear-out date of 1 April 1942, but this order was generally ignored and the popular [...] "Knautschmütze" [...] was worn throughout the war, coming {{to be known as the}} ältere Art (old style) <b>field</b> <b>cap.</b>|$|R
