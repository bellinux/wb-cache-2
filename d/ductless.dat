500|$|The {{adrenal glands}} are named for their {{location}} {{relative to the}} kidneys. The term [...] "adrenal" [...] comes from ad- (Latin, [...] "near") and renes (Latin, [...] "kidney"). Similarly, [...] "suprarenal", as termed by Jean Riolan the Younger in 1629, {{is derived from the}} Latin [...] (...) and [...] (...) [...] The suprarenal nature of the glands was not truly accepted until the 19th century, as anatomists clarified the <b>ductless</b> nature of the glands and their likely secretory role – prior to this, there was some debate as to whether the glands were indeed suprarenal or part of the kidney.|$|E
2500|$|The {{earliest}} {{notion of}} signal transduction {{can be traced}} back to 1855, when Claude Bernard proposed that <b>ductless</b> glands such as the spleen, the thyroid and adrenal glands, were responsible for the release of [...] "internal secretions" [...] with physiological effects. Bernard's [...] "secretions" [...] were later named [...] "hormones" [...] by Ernest Starling in 1905. Together with William Bayliss, Starling had discovered secretin in 1902. Although many other hormones, most notably insulin, were discovered in the following years, the mechanisms remained largely unknown.|$|E
40|$|Although {{the seeds}} of cycad plants {{have been used as}} a food in {{southern}} areas in Japan, people have known that it was toxic without adequate removal of the toxin. The toxin in Japanese Cycas revoluta Thunb. was isolated and the structure of the toxin was elucidated as Cycasin, methylazoxymethyl - β - D-glucoside, by Nishida, Kobayashi and Nagahama in 1955. Laqueur et al. (1963) found that the cycad seeds in Guam had carcinogenic actions in experimental animals through his studies about persumed relationship between ingestion of cycad seeds and neurogenic disorders in men and cattle. The results of many studies indicated that the toxicity and the carcinogenicity of Cycasin were revealed after the enzymatic hydrolysis of Cycasin to the aglycon (Methylazoxymethanol) and that this conversion was brought about in vivo by the action of β -glucosidase, most likely of intestinal bacterial origin. Studies about carcinogenic action of Cycasin and morphological studies on hepatic cancer were carried out in two age-groups of Sprague-Dawley strain rats induced given 10 mg/kg body weight of Cycasin in drinking water through experimental periods. Fourteen cases each of hepatic cancer were observed in both sexes (17 females and 16 males) in 21 -day-old group of animals between 167 and 487 experimental days in female rats, and between 203 and 438 in male rats. In 50 -day-old (20 rats each in both sexes), 18 each of hepatic cancer were observed between 251 and 556 in female rats, and between 280 and 556 in male rats. Macroscopic findings of hepatic tumors were graysh-white nodules with focal hemorrhagic lesions. Macroscopically, most of hapatoma were composed of well differentiated type of hepatocellular carcinoma with trabecular pattern of the tumor cells. And clear cell type of adenocarcinoma, intestinal metalasia type of cancer and pleomorphic cell carcinoma were also observed, but these types of cancer were rare cases. Some cases had sarcomatous pattern of tumor growth. Only one case had liver cirrhotic changes with well differentiated type of hepatoma. Electronmicroscopic findings of tumor cell, such as peroxsomes, tight junctions and bile <b>ductlesses</b> between the tumor cells, suggested that most of the tumor were hepatic cell origin. 小林昭（鹿児島大学農学部農芸化学科）寺師慎一（鹿児島大学南方海域研究センター...|$|R
2500|$|On March 10, 1894, Oliver and Schäfer {{presented}} their {{findings to the}} Physiological Society in London. A 47-pages account followed a year later, {{in the style of}} the time without statistics, but with precise description of many individual experiments and 25 recordings on kymograph smoked drums, showing, besides the blood pressure increase, reflex bradycardia and contraction of the spleen. ″It appears to be established as the result of these investigations that … the suprarenal capsules are to be regarded although <b>ductless,</b> as strictly secreting glands. The material which they form and which is found, at least in its fully active condition, only in the medulla of the gland, produces striking physiological effects upon the muscular tissue generally, and especially upon that of the heart and arteries. Its action … is produced mainly if not entirely by direct action.″ ...|$|E
6000|$|The most {{interesting}} part of Cannon's book consists {{in the investigation}} of the effects produced by secretion of adrenin. Adrenin is a substance secreted into the blood by the adrenal glands. These are among the <b>ductless</b> glands, the functions of which, both in physiology and in connection with the emotions, have only come to be known during recent years. Cannon found that pain, fear and rage occurred in circumstances which affected the supply of adrenin, and that an artificial injection of adrenin could, for example, produce all the symptoms of fear. He studied the effects of adrenin on various parts of the body; he found that it causes the pupils to dilate, hairs to stand erect, blood vessels to be constricted, and so on. These effects were still produced if the parts in question were removed from the body and kept alive artificially.* ...|$|E
60|$|There {{are certain}} {{instruments}} used by scientists so delicate {{that they have}} to be wrapped in cotton wool and kept in <b>ductless</b> places, and so sensitive that the slightest shock will derange them. And there are certain souls which cannot stand the jars of life--souls created to register thoughts and sentiments too fine for those of coarser construction. Such was the soul of the storekeeper of Coniston. Whether or not {{he was one of those}} immortalized in the famous Elegy, it is not for us to say. A celebrated poet who read the letters to the Guardian--at Miss Lucretia Penniman's request--has declared Mr. Wetherell to have been a genius. He wrote those letters, as we know, after he had piled his boxes and rolled his barrels into place; after he had added up the columns in his ledger and recorded, each week, the small but ever increasing deficit which he owed to Jethro Bass. Could he have been removed from the barrels and the ledgers, and the debts and the cares and the implications, what might we have had from his pen? That will never be known.|$|E
6000|$|... {{and that}} {{apparently}} nothing grew regularly and steadily, {{and so far}} as he could make out nothing could grow regularly and steadily: it was as if every living thing had just to accumulate force to grow, grew with vigour only for a time, and then had to wait for a space before it could go on growing again. And in the muffled and highly technical language of the really careful [...] "scientist," [...] Redwood suggested that the process of growth probably demanded the presence of a considerable quantity of some necessary substance in the blood that was only formed very slowly, and that when this substance was used up by growth, it was only very slowly replaced, and that meanwhile the organism had to mark time. He compared his unknown substance to oil in machinery. A growing animal was rather like an engine, he suggested, that can move a certain distance and must then be oiled before it can run again. ("But why shouldn't one oil the engine from without?" [...] said Mr. Bensington, when he read the paper.) And all this, said Redwood, with the delightful nervous inconsecutiveness of his class, might very probably be found to throw a light upon the mystery of certain of the <b>ductless</b> glands.

50|$|Today {{there are}} mini-split (<b>ductless)</b> air {{conditioner}} units available with SEER ratings up to 33. During the 2014 AHR Expo, Mitsubishi unveiled a new mini-split <b>ductless</b> AC unit with a SEER rating of 30.5. GREE also released a 30.5 SEER rating mini split {{this past year}} as well. Traditional AC systems with ducts have maximum SEER ratings slightly below these levels. Also, practically, central systems will have an achieved energy efficiency ratio 10-20% lower than the nameplate rating due to the duct-related losses, increasing the relative advantage for <b>ductless.</b>|$|E

50|$|There are {{two major}} {{configurations}} of extractor hoods: ducted (or vented) application, and <b>ductless</b> (or recirculating) application. In a ducted application, the output collar of the extractor hood's blower motor {{is attached to a}} duct system, which terminates outside the building. In a <b>ductless</b> application, a filter, often containing activated charcoal, removes odor and smoke particles from the air before releasing the cleaned air back into the kitchen.|$|E

50|$|A {{benefit of}} <b>ductless</b> fume hoods {{is that they}} are mobile, easy to install since they require no ductwork, and can be plugged into a 110 volt or 220 volt outlet.|$|E
50|$|Advantages of the <b>ductless</b> system include smaller {{size and}} {{flexibility}} for zoning or {{heating and cooling}} individual rooms. The inside wall space required is significantly reduced. Also, the compressor and heat exchanger can be located {{farther away from the}} inside space, rather than merely {{on the other side of}} the same unit as in a PTAC or window air conditioner. Flexible exterior hoses lead from the outside unit to the interior one(s); these are often enclosed with metal to look like common drainpipes from the roof. In addition, <b>ductless</b> systems offer higher efficiency, reaching above 30 SEER.|$|E

50|$|Variable {{refrigerant}} flow (VRF), {{also known as}} variable refrigerant volume (VRV), is an HVAC technology invented in 1982.

This refrigerant is conditioned by a single outdoor condensing unit, and is circulated within the building to multiple fan-coil units (FCUs).|$|E
5000|$|The primary {{disadvantage}} of <b>ductless</b> air conditioners is their cost. Such systems cost about US$1,500 to US$2,000 per ton (12,000 BTU per hour) of cooling capacity. This is about 30% more than central systems (not including ductwork) and may {{cost more than}} twice as much as window units of similar capacity." ...|$|E
5000|$|Central, [...] "all-air" [...] {{air-conditioning}} systems (or package systems) {{with a combined}} outdoor condenser/evaporator unit are often installed in modern residences, offices, and public buildings, but are difficult to retrofit (install in a building that was not designed to receive it) because of the bulky air ducts required.

50|$|Liquid-to-air {{heat pumps}} (also called water-to-air) output forced air, and are most {{commonly}} used to replace legacy forced air furnaces and central air conditioning systems. There are variations that allow for split systems, high-velocity systems, and <b>ductless</b> systems.

50|$|A ducted {{system allows}} for removal {{of all forms}} of {{airborne}} contamination, while a <b>ductless</b> one recirculates heat and moisture into the kitchen. In addition, a ducted application eliminates the need for regular replacement of the filters, and avoids the airflow restriction (and resultant loss of power) caused by them. However, ducted application can be impractical, due to lack of space or ability to install a duct system, make-up air requirements, or the additional cost of heating/cooling the make-up air. Some range hood designs allow for both types of applications.|$|E
