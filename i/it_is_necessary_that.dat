5|$|The {{greatest}} drawback of {{the classical}} Fourier transformation is a rather narrow class of functions (originals) for which it can be effectively computed. Namely, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>that</b> these functions decrease sufficiently rapidly to zero (in the neighborhood of infinity) {{in order to ensure}} the existence of the Fourier integral. For example, the Fourier transform of such simple functions as polynomials does not exist in the classical sense. The extension {{of the classical}} Fourier transformation to distributions considerably enlarged the class of functions that could be transformed and this removed many obstacles.|$|E

5|$|Reformed Christians believe baptism to {{be a sign}} of regeneration, or {{the making}} of one into a new creature, based on the {{connection}} found in the New Testament between regeneration and washing with water. Baptism also represents forgiveness or remission of sin by the sprinkling of the blood of Christ, similarly to the sprinkling of blood of sacrificial animals. Baptism is held by almost the entire Reformed tradition to effect regeneration, even in infants who are incapable of faith, by effecting faith which would come to fruition later. However, Reformed theologians do not teach that baptism is necessarily bound to the forgiveness of sins. Not everyone who participates in the outward rite of baptism can be said to has had their sins forgiven. Rather, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>that</b> the baptized person participate spiritually by faith in order to receive this benefit.|$|E

By exaggerating the forms, in order to render them more clearly visible, or by enriching them with details, we would destroy {{the proportion of the}} work. Finally, the model, like the design, should have a summarized character, such as one would give to a rapid sketch. Only <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>that</b> this character should be the product of volition and study, and that the artist, concentrating his knowledge, should find the form and the line in its greatest simplicity.|$|E

25|$|DNA {{methylation}} is {{the process}} in which a methyl group is added to either a cytosine or adenine. This process causes the activation or inactivation of gene expression, thereby resulting in gene regulation in eukaryotic cells. DNA methylation process is also known {{to be involved in}} certain types of cancer formation. In order for this chemical modification to occur, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>that</b> the target base flips out of the DNA double helix to allow the methyltransferases to catalyze the reaction.|$|E
25|$|If we {{continuously}} pump electrons, we will excite an appreciable {{number of}} them into level 3, such that N3 > 0. To have a medium suitable for laser operation, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>that</b> these excited atoms quickly decay to level 2. The energy released in this transition may be emitted as a photon (spontaneous emission), however in practice the 3→2 transition (labeled R in the diagram) is usually radiationless, with the energy being transferred to vibrational motion (heat) of the host material surrounding the atoms, without the generation of a photon.|$|E
25|$|When {{functional}} proteins {{have been}} isolated, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>that</b> their genes are too, therefore a genotype-phenotype link is required. This can be covalent, such as mRNA display where the mRNA gene {{is linked to}} the protein at the end of translation by puromycin. Alternatively the protein and its gene can be co-localised by compartmentalisation in living cells or emulsion droplets. The gene sequences isolated are then amplified by PCR or by transformed host bacteria. Either the single best sequence, or a pool of sequences can be used as the template for the next round of mutagenesis. The repeated cycles of Diversification-Selection-Amplification generate protein variants adapted to the applied selection pressures.|$|E
5000|$|Theologians {{from the}} Orthodox {{tradition}} have made prominent {{contributions to the}} development of Marian thought and devotion.John Damascene (c. 650─c. 750) {{was one of the greatest}} Orthodox theologians.

25|$|It is also {{possible}} to restrict the arities of function symbols and predicate symbols, in sufficiently expressive theories. One can in principle dispense entirely with functions of arity greater than 2 and predicates of arity greater than 1 in theories that include a pairing function. This {{is a function of}} arity 2 that takes pairs of elements of the domain and returns an ordered pair containing them. It is also sufficient to have two predicate symbols of arity 2 that define projection functions from an ordered pair to its components. In either case <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>that</b> the natural axioms for a pairing function and its projections are satisfied.|$|E
25|$|The role of {{re-entry}} or circus {{motion was}} demonstrated separately by Mines and Garrey. Mines created {{a ring of}} excitable tissue by cutting the atria out of the ray fish. Garrey cut out a similar ring from the turtle ventricle. They were both able to show that, if a ring of excitable tissue was stimulated at a single point, the subsequent waves of depolarisation would pass around the ring. The waves eventually meet and cancel each other out, but, if an area of transient block occurred with a refractory period that blocked one wavefront and subsequently allowed the other to proceed retrogradely over the other path, then a self-sustaining circus movement phenomenon would result. For this to happen, however, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>that</b> there be some form of non-uniformity. In practice, this may be an area of ischemic or infarcted myocardium, or underlying scar tissue.|$|E
25|$|There are two tool speeds to be {{considered}} in friction-stir welding; how fast the tool rotates and how quickly it traverses along the interface. These two parameters have considerable importance and must be chosen with care to ensure a successful and efficient welding cycle. The relationship between the rotation speed, the welding speed and the heat input during welding is complex but, in general, {{it can be said that}} increasing the rotation speed or decreasing the traverse speed will result in a hotter weld. In order to produce a successful weld <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>that</b> the material surrounding the tool is hot enough to enable the extensive plastic flow required and minimize the forces acting on the tool. If the material is too cold then voids or other flaws may be present in the stir zone and in extreme cases the tool may break.|$|E
