5|$|Meanwhile, an {{intrusive}} {{public works}} inspector (Carter Jahncke) tests {{the air quality}} at the squad room, but insists to an inquisitive Gee that everything is fine. The next day, however, Gee goes upstairs and finds a team wearing protective respirator suits removing hazardous asbestos from the wall. Gee angrily confronts Captain Barnfather (Clayton LeBouef) and Colonel Granger (Gerald F. Gough) for not informing the detectives about the work, and demands it be stopped until precautionary medical checks can be conducted. Barnfather and Granger <b>insist</b> <b>the</b> removal work is safe, but give in when Gee threatens {{to go to the}} media. Meanwhile, Lewis (Clark Johnson) brags repeatedly to Crosetti (Jon Polito) about his new Ford FE V8 engine and the car he plans to build. Crosetti feigns disinterest, but the next day presents Lewis with a rear-view mirror as a gift.|$|E
5|$|Overclaiming of aerial {{victories}} was not uncommon, {{and both}} sides claimed more aircraft shot down than was the case. For the 18 August action, British propaganda claimed 144 German aircraft destroyed, which was over twice the actual figure. In response, the Germans claimed they had only lost 36, a figure which has since been proven to be half the actual figure (69 to 71). The German propaganda elements claimed to have destroyed 147 British aircraft, which was over twice the actual figure. Again, the British admitted to losing only 23, when the actual figure was around 68. Other sources between them <b>insist</b> <b>the</b> RAF's losses were 27–34 fighters destroyed, and 29 aircraft destroyed on the ground, including only eight fighters.|$|E

25|$|The {{existence}} of activists calling themselves the Revolutionary Cells or Animal Rights Militia (ARM), another name used to inflict violence, reflects a struggle within the Animal Liberation Front {{and the animal}} rights movement in general, between those who believe violence and terror tactics are justified, and those who <b>insist</b> <b>the</b> movement should reject it in favor of non-violent resistance.|$|E
25|$|Some {{maritime}} rescue organisations, such as Britain's Royal National Lifeboat Institution, do not <b>insist</b> <b>the</b> {{crews of}} their lifeboats renounce {{their right to}} claim compensation for salvage., but should they choose to make a claim, they must pay {{for the use of}} the lifeboat and make good any damage suffered by her. Claims for salvage by lifeboat crews are rare.|$|E
25|$|On 18 July 2011, two men, Malik Madjnoun and Abdelhakim Chenoui, {{were convicted}} of killing Matoub, and sentenced to 12 years in jail. The one-day trial was {{suspended}} twice when Matoub's family interrupted to <b>insist</b> <b>the</b> suspects were innocent. As Madjnoun and Chenoui had been in prison awaiting trial since 1999, they were released in 2012, having served their time.|$|E

25|$|The play {{is still}} disputed by those involved, {{particularly}} by living personnel from the Raiders and their fans, who <b>insist</b> <b>the</b> Raiders should have won. Tatum {{said that the}} ball did not bounce off him, both immediately after the game as well as later; however, in his memoirs, Tatum equivocated, stating {{that he could not}} honestly say if the ball hit him. Raiders linebacker Phil Villapiano, who was covering Harris at the time, maintains that the ball hit Fuqua. Fuqua has been coy, supposedly saying he knows exactly what happened that day but will never tell.|$|E
25|$|To {{preserve}} the pretannin tea without requiring {{it all to}} be poured into cups, a second teapot may be used. The steeping pot is best unglazed earthenware; Yixing pots are {{the best known of}} these, famed for the high-quality clay from which they are made. The serving pot is generally porcelain, which retains the heat better. Larger teapots are a post-19th century invention, as tea before this time was very rare and very expensive. Experienced tea-drinkers often <b>insist</b> <b>the</b> tea should not be stirred around while it is steeping (sometimes called winding or mashing in the UK). This, they say, will do little to strengthen the tea, but is likely to bring the tannins out {{in the same way that}} brewing too long will do. For the same reason, one should not squeeze the last drops out of a teabag; if stronger tea is desired, more tea leaves should be used.|$|E

25|$|Casa Frissac {{is located}} {{just off the}} main square. It {{was built in the}} 19th century in French style as the {{residence}} of Jesús Pliego Frissac. According to local legend, bandit Chucho el Roto lived here at one time. In the 20th century, it belonged to Adolfo López Mateos then it became the site of the Lancaster School, which closed in the 1980s. In the 1950s, it was used as a set for the film Los Olvidados, by Luis Buñuel. Today, the house is still the protagonist for a number of local ghost stories; however, its official function is that of a cultural center called the Instituto Javier Barros Sierra. This center began operations in 2001 after 21,800,000 pesos worth of remodeling, which restored the structure to much of its 19th-century look. The center has hosted art exhibits by photographers, graffiti artists, and moremany with a political message. While the center’s authorities <b>insist</b> <b>the</b> center is non-political, members of Mexico’s PAN party raised objections to the content in the center’s first year.|$|E
25|$|The Spanish {{experience}} began a late {{surge in}} interest of close support aircraft in Luftwaffe. In {{the first years}} of the Nazi state these types remained a low-priority for air planners who shaped the embryonic Luftwaffe. This apparent regression from the practices and experiences of World War I stemmed from the belief among the General Staff (Oberkommando der Luftwaffe) that army support aviation in 1917–1918 was purely a reaction to trench warfare. The German Heer did not <b>insist</b> <b>the</b> Luftwaffe change it's approach at this time either. German air doctrine remained rooted in the fundamentals of Operativer Luftkrieg (Operational Air War) which stressed interdiction, Strategic bombing (when and if possible) but primarily the air supremacy mission. The Spanish experience encouraged the General Staff to embrace the dive-bomber concept, for which Richthofen was partly responsible, but the influence of the conflict on German operational preferences remain ambiguous. On the eve of World War II, German air planners regarded the dive-bomber as a strategic weapon to strike with precision at enemy industry. Even factored into the army support groups, only fifteen percent of Luftwaffe front-line strength contained specialist ground-attack aircraft in September 1939.|$|E
500|$|Critics have {{suggested}} that the movie indirectly references the work of writers Dante Alighieri (through the use of Divine Comedy imagery) and Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (through the presence of Faustian bargains). Confounding bureaucratic structures and irrational characters, like those in the novels of Franz Kafka, appear in the film, but the Coens <b>insist</b> <b>the</b> connection was not intended. [...] "I have not read him since college", admitted Joel in 1991, [...] "when I devoured works like The Metamorphosis. Others have mentioned The Castle and [...] "In the Penal Colony", but I've never read them." ...|$|E

500|$|This {{trend of}} mixing genres {{continued}} and intensified with Barton Fink (1991); the Coens <b>insist</b> <b>the</b> film [...] "does {{not belong to}} any genre". Ethan has described it as [...] "a buddy movie for the '90s". It contains elements of comedy, film noir, and horror, but other film categories are present. Actor Turturro {{referred to it as}} a coming of age story, while literature professor and film analyst R. Barton Palmer calls it a Künstlerroman, highlighting the importance of the main character's evolution as a writer. Critic Donald Lyons describes the movie as [...] "a retro-surrealist vision".|$|E
500|$|In [...] "Go Big or Go Home", {{after three}} months of closure, the Pawnee {{government}} reopens in a limited capacity, but Chris and Ben <b>insist</b> <b>the</b> parks and recreation department's budget can only sustain existing park maintenance. Leslie, however, wants to offer better programs and services for the Pawnee citizens. She asks Ann to go on a date with Chris, then try to convince him to increase the budget. Ann reluctantly agrees to the plan, but as the date progresses, she finds she actually enjoys herself and develops feelings for Chris. When Leslie accidentally gives away her secret plan, Chris is hurt and disparaged by Ann's ulterior motive. The next day, however, Ann apologizes and asks to continue dating Chris, who happily accepts.|$|E
500|$|Alcohol was {{not allowed}} in the Maharishi's ashram, but Mardas smuggled some in from Dehra Dun, and later {{reported}} to Lennon and Harrison that the Maharishi {{had sex with a}} young American student, and had made a sexual advance toward Mia Farrow. This was not supported in Farrow's autobiography What Falls Away (1997), in which she wrote that she may have misinterpreted the supposed sexual advance. Mardas continued to <b>insist</b> <b>the</b> Maharishi was not what he said he was; even making Harrison unsure. Lennon mused in 1970: [...] "Well, it must be true, because if George [...] is doubting him, there must be something in it". Lennon and Harrison confronted the Maharishi, but the startled Maharishi's answers did not satisfy them, and they decided to leave the camp. Mardas insisted that they (Lennon, Harrison and their respective wives) must leave the camp at once, or the Maharishi might send down some [...] "black magic" [...] on them. Mardas then went down to Dehra Dun to organise taxis for the next morning to take them all to Delhi.|$|E

2500|$|Another {{example of}} the change in the {{original}} egalitarian nature of the kibbutz is that the founders of the kibbutz did not use the traditional Hebrew word for husband, ba'al (בעל, BAH-al), because the word is otherwise used to mean [...] "master" [...] or [...] "owner" [...] and implies that the wife is submissive to her dominant spouse. The granddaughters of the founders use ba'al for husband to their grandmother's disgust. The granddaughters <b>insist</b> <b>the</b> grandparents are too caught up with terminology.
