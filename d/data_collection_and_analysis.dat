Since minimal sample preprocessing {{is required in}} comparison to second generation sequencing, smaller equipments could be designed. Oxford Nanopore Technology has recently commercialized the [...] This sequencing machine is {{roughly the size of}} a regular USB flash drive and can be used readily by connecting to a laptop. In addition, since the sequencing process is not parallelized across regions of the genome, data could be collected and analyzed in real time.

2500|$|A {{patient safety}} {{organization}} (PSO) is a group, institution or association that improves medical care by reducing medical errors. In the 1990s, reports {{in several countries}} revealed a staggering number of patient injuries and deaths each year due to avoidable adverse health care events. In the United States, the Institute of Medicine report (1999) called for a broad national effort to include the establishment of patient safety centers, expanded reporting of adverse events and development of safety programs in health care organizations. [...] The organizations that developed ranged from governmental to private, and some founded by industry, professional or consumer groups. Common functions of patient safety organizations are <b>data</b> <b>collection</b> <b>and</b> <b>analysis,</b> reporting, education, funding and advocacy.|$|E
2500|$|In the United States, two {{organizations}} contribute {{to one of}} the world's lowest aviation accident rates. Mandatory accident investigation is carried out by the National Transportation Safety Board, while the Aviation Safety Reporting System receives voluntary reports to identify deficiencies and provide data for planning improvements. The latter system is confidential and provides reports back to stakeholders without regulatory action. Similarities and contrasts have been noted between the [...] "cultures of safety" [...] in medicine and aviation. Pilots and medical personnel operate in complex environments, interact with technology, and are subject to fatigue, stress, danger, and loss of life and prestige as a consequence of error. Given the enviable record of aviation in accident prevention, a similar medical adverse event system would include both mandatory (for severe incidents) and voluntary non-punitive reporting, teamwork training, feedback on performance and an institutional commitment to <b>data</b> <b>collection</b> <b>and</b> <b>analysis.</b> The Patient Safety Reporting System (PSRS) is a program modeled upon the Aviation Safety Reporting System and developed by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to monitor patient safety through voluntary, confidential reports. [...] Required training in crew resource management (CRM), which focused on team dynamics both inside the cockpit and outside was introduced in the early 1980s after the tragic mishap of United Airlines 173. [...] CRM is considered an effective means of improving safety in aviation and is utilized by the DoD, NASA, and almost all commercial airlines. [...] Many of the tenets of this training have been incorporated into medicine under the guise of , which was introduced by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ). [...] The AHRQ calls this program [...] "an evidence-based teamwork system to improve communication and teamwork skills among health care professionals." ...|$|E
