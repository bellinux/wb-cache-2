5|$|Once it {{has been}} decided that the gift has failed, the courts {{consider}} whether the gift may be applied cy-près. The gift must show charitable intention; that the settlor intended not just a gift to a particular (failed) purpose or organisation, but a more general charitable intention. This is something decided on the facts of each <b>individual</b> <b>case,</b> but some general principles are in place; external evidence is admissible to override any prima facie interpretation that a gift is for non-charitable purposes, as in Re Satterthwaite's Will Trusts, and charitable intention {{can be found in}} cases where a non-existent charity is the recipient of the settlor's gift, as in Re Harwood.|$|E
5|$|Trusts {{where the}} {{doctrine}} is applicable {{are divided into}} two groups; those with subsequent failure, where the trust's purpose has failed after it came into operation, and initial failure, where the trust's purposes are immediately invalid. Subsequent failure cases simply require the redirection of the funds to the nearest possible purpose, {{since there is no}} question of allowing the settlor's next of kin to inherit the money. Initial failure cases, however, require not just a decision on whether the purpose has failed, but also on whether the funds should be subject to cy-près or returned to the estate in a resulting trust. This is decided based on the charitable intention of the settlor, something determined on the facts of each <b>individual</b> <b>case.</b>|$|E

25|$|All {{previously}} existing judicial {{bodies are}} suppressed and the pope {{has made the}} vicar the ordinary and sole judge {{in the first instance}} for all suits brought in the court of the Roman diocese. The vicar passes judgement only in those cases which he has expressly reserved for himself; in other cases his auditor acts as judge, forming with the vicar one and the same court. The auditor is regarded as the official of the curia of the Roman Diocese and tries the suits according to common law. The office and jurisdiction of the camerlengo of the Roman clergy have been suppressed and his faculties and jurisdiction have been transferred completely to the auditor, who is provided with a substitute. When according to common law a suit is to be decided not by a single judge but by a full bench, the auditor is then held to be the presiding judge, in case the vicar does not reserve the position of presiding officer to himself. The appointment of the associate judges belongs to the pope; for the <b>individual</b> <b>case</b> the vicar has the right to select the associate judges from those appointed by the pope. This ordinance is especially worth noticing. The other ordinances cannot here be discussed in detail.|$|E

25|$|Once it is {{established}} that the sufficient relationship of employer and employee exists, {{it is necessary that}} any tort be committed in the course of employment. As with distinguishing an employer and employee relationship, there is no one test which adequately establishes which acts employers are vicariously liable for. Such determinations rest upon precedent, and the facts of each <b>individual</b> <b>case.</b> A preferred test of the courts was formulated by John William Salmond, some 100 years ago, which states that an employer will be held liable for either a wrongful act they have authorised, or a wrongful and unauthorised mode of an act that was authorised. The rationale for this is policy based; if an employer could simply issue detailed and long prohibitions on what an employee was not to do, they could never be found vicariously liable for the wrongdoings of their employees. However, a distinction can be drawn between acts which are prohibited, and acts which take employees out of the course of their employment. An illustration of the test is provided by two contrasting cases, Limpus v London General Omnibus Company and Beard v London General Omnibus Company, both involving road collisions. In the former, a driver pulled in front of another rival omnibus, in order to obstruct it. Despite express prohibitions from the employer, they were found liable; this was merely an unauthorised mode of the employee carrying out his duties (driving), not an entirely new activity. By contrast, in the latter case, London General Omnibus Company were not liable where a conductor (employed to collect fares on board the bus) negligently chose to drive the vehicle instead; this was completely outside of his duties.|$|E
500|$|Even when a {{decision}} made by a body possesses some public element, judicial review of the decision may be ousted where a statute expressly excludes the court's power to review administrative decisions. However, the effectiveness of an ouster clause depends on the facts of each <b>individual</b> <b>case.</b> Examples of statutory ouster clauses in Singapore are section8B(2) of the Internal Security Act, and section47 of the Industrial Relations Act. The latter provision stipulates that any determination by the Industrial Arbitration Court is [...] "final and conclusive" [...] and [...] "shall {{not be subject to}} any Quashing Order, Prohibiting Order, Mandatory Order or injunction in any court on any account".|$|E
500|$|Neonatal {{circumcision}} {{is generally}} safe when done by an experienced practitioner. The most common acute complications are bleeding, infection and {{the removal of}} either {{too much or too little}} foreskin. [...] These complications occur in approximately 0.12% of procedures, and constitute the vast majority of all acute circumcision complications in the United States. [...] Minor complications are reported to occur in three percent of procedures. Severe complications are rare. A specific complication rate is difficult to determine due to scant data on complications and inconsistencies in their classification. Complication rates are greater when the procedure is performed by an inexperienced operator, in unsterile conditions, or when the child is at an older age. Significant acute complications happen rarely, occurring in about 1 in 500 newborn procedures in the United States. Severe to catastrophic complications, including death, are so rare that they are reported only as <b>individual</b> <b>case</b> reports. Other possible complications include buried penis, chordee, phimosis, skin bridges, urethral fistulas, and meatal stenosis. These complications may be avoided with proper technique, and are most often treatable without requiring a hospital visit.|$|E

50|$|Cautelary {{jurisprudence}} is law {{made in a}} precautionary way {{prior to}} or outside of the normal legislative enactment. It meant empirical, practical legal efforts aimed at solving <b>individual</b> <b>cases,</b> as distinguished from regular jurisprudence which sought to establish abstract rules under which <b>individual</b> <b>cases</b> would fall. Its first proponent was Quintus Mucius Scaevola Pontifex, who thus gave his name to the Roman designation {{for this kind of}} law, the cautio muciana.|$|R
500|$|It {{is thought}} that Skivick or Skivik, the local name for the section of {{structure}} visible on Wheeldale Moor, could derive from two morphemes from Old Norse. The first syllable could derive from [...] skeið, which could mean either a track or farm road through a field, or from a word used to describe a course or boundary. The second syllable could derive from vík, meaning a bay or a nook between hills. Scandinavian or Norse place-names are common in Yorkshire and Norse peoples settled in the Yorkshire area from 870 AD onwards following raiding over the previous seventy years. Sawyer states that early Norse colonists {{had a profound effect}} on place-names in the areas in which they settled. Sedgefield states that the skeið derivation specifically in place-names within northern England points to Scandinavian settlement of the area, but that due to the inheritance of language across generations, a place-name containing skeið may in any <b>individual</b> <b>case</b> have been applied any time between the ninth and fifteenth centuries. Historian Mary Atkin states that skeið place-names appear near Roman sites frequently enough to suggest an associative link.|$|E
500|$|This {{inclusion}} of the fantastic, however, is mostly a framework by which the author discusses human nature and society. One critic suggests that [...] "the story would be much the same without it". Balzac had used supernatural elements in the potboiler novels he published under noms de plume, but their presence in Peau de chagrin signaled {{a turning point in}} his approach to the use of symbolism. Whereas he had used fantastic objects and events in earlier works, they were mostly simple plot points or uncomplicated devices for suspense. With La Peau de chagrin, on the other hand, the talisman represents Valentin's soul; at the same time, his demise is symbolic of a greater social decline. Balzac's real foci in the 1831 novel are the power of human desire and the nature of society after the July Revolution. French writer and critic Félicien Marceau even suggests that the symbolism in the novel allows a purer analysis than the <b>individual</b> <b>case</b> studies of other Balzac novels; by removing the analysis to an abstract level, it becomes less complicated by variations of individual personality. As an everyman, Valentin displays the essential characteristics of human nature, not a particular person's approach to the dilemma offered by the skin.|$|E
500|$|The Laming {{report was}} criticised by Caroline Abrahams and Deborah Lightfoot of NCH as too narrow, {{focusing}} {{too much on}} the particular case of Victoria Climbié and not on general child protection. According to Harry Ferguson, a professor of social work at the University of the West of England, [...] "Laming's report focuses too heavily on the implementation of new structures and fails to understand the keen intuition that child protection work demands". He criticised the approach to child protection of focusing {{too much on the}} worst cases and trying too much to prevent them, rather than having an approach that also celebrates success; and said that focusing too much on any <b>individual</b> <b>case</b> and basing reforms on that was [...] "deeply problematic". Laming responded to criticism by the Association of Directors of Social Services that his recommendations would require much more funding by saying that these arguments lacked [...] "intellectual rigour", and he dismissed claims that his reforms would be too bureaucratic. The Guardian said that the report does not address the issues of frontline staff. Deryk Mead of NCH said, [...] "I do believe that inquiry reports have made a positive difference to the child protection system, and I have every confidence that Lord Laming's report will do so too".|$|E
