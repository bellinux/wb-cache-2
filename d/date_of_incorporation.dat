50|$|Early town {{organization}} in Vermont proceeded {{in a different}} manner {{from that of the}} other New England states. In these areas, towns were often “chartered” long before any settlers moved into a particular area. This was very common in the mid to late 18th century. Once there were enough residents in a town to formally organize a town government, no further action was necessary to incorporate. This practice can lead to inconsistencies in the <b>dates</b> <b>of</b> <b>incorporation</b> for towns in this region. Dates given in reference sources sometime reflect the date the town was chartered - which may have been long before it was even settled - not the date its town government actually became active. In other parts of New England, it was not unheard of for “future towns” to be laid out along these lines, but such areas would not be formally incorporated as towns until they were sufficiently settled to organize a town government.|$|R
