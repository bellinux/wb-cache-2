5|$|After Maine and Missouri entered service, {{they were}} {{assigned}} to the North Atlantic Fleet, while Ohio, built on the West Coast of the United States, was instead sent to serve as the flagship of the Asiatic Fleet based in the Philippines. In April 1904, a turret fire killed 36 men aboard Missouri, but the quick action of three men prevented the fire <b>from</b> <b>reaching</b> <b>the</b> magazines and destroying the ship, for which they were awarded the Medal of Honor. In 1907, Ohio returned from the western Pacific and joined her sisters in what was now the Atlantic Fleet. During this period, Maine served as the flagship of the Atlantic Fleet until she was relieved in April 1907.|$|E
5|$|After the {{violence}} of November 4, the Indianapolis Merchant's Association and other business leaders petitioned Governor Ralston to call out the Indiana National Guard.

Union leaders informed the Governor that calling out the guard would only cause them to escalate the riot and lead to more bloodshed.|$|E

5|$|Han-era astronomers {{adopted a}} geocentric {{model of the}} universe, theorizing that it was shaped like a sphere {{surrounding}} the earth in the center. They assumed that the Sun, Moon, and planets were spherical and not disc-shaped. They also thought that the illumination of the Moon and planets was caused by sunlight, that lunar eclipses occurred when the Earth obstructed sunlight falling onto the Moon, and that a solar eclipse occurred when the Moon obstructed sunlight <b>from</b> <b>reaching</b> <b>the</b> Earth. Although others disagreed with his model, Wang Chong accurately described the water cycle of the evaporation of water into clouds.|$|E

At the beginning of the conclave Alessandro Peretti di Montalto supported Antonio Sauli. A significant number of the electors loyal to Pietro Aldobrandini, the nephew of Clement VIII, were willing to support Sauli. Aldobrandini, however, opposed Sauli's election due to Sauli's previous opposition to electing Clement, and was able to prevent Sauli <b>from</b> <b>reaching</b> <b>the</b> two-thirds majority required for election.|$|E

5|$|In the 2003–04 season Sunderland {{finished}} third in Division One, and only a penalty shoot-out defeat {{at the hands of}} Crystal Palace prevented them <b>from</b> <b>reaching</b> <b>the</b> play-off final for a promotion place. In the 2004–05 season, Sunderland finished {{at the top of the}} table in Division One, now rechristened the Football League Championship, and thus returned to the Premier League. The 2005–06 season was poor for Sunderland, as they failed to win a home game before Christmas and were eventually relegated with a new record lowest points tally of 15, breaking their own previous record of 19. McCarthy was sacked in March and replaced by caretaker manager Kevin Ball. He took Sunderland to their first home win of the season, a 2–1 victory over Fulham.|$|E
5|$|Opposing Force {{opens with}} Shephard riding on a V-22 Osprey with his squad. His squad discuss their deployment, {{somewhat}} irritated {{that they have}} not been told what they are being deployed for. However, as they are nearing their Landing Zone at Black Mesa, airborne alien creatures attack the Osprey formation, causing Shephard's Osprey to crash land. Shephard regains consciousness in a Black Mesa medical bay, tended to by the science team, learning that the Marines are being steadily beaten by the alien forces from Xen and orders have come through to pull out. Consequently, Shephard departs to reach an extraction point and escape the facility. However, Shephard is prevented <b>from</b> <b>reaching</b> <b>the</b> extraction point by the enigmatic G-Man, forcing the evacuation craft to leave without him.|$|E

5|$|The Aurora {{arrived at}} Cape Denison on 13 January 1913.

Finding no sign and {{reaching}} the end of the navigable ice-free water, they returned to Cape Denison. The oncoming winter concerned Davis, and on 8 February—just hours before Mawson's return to the hut—the ship departed Commonwealth Bay, leaving six men behind as a relief party. Upon Mawson's return, the Aurora was recalled by wireless radio, but powerful katabatic winds sweeping down from the plateau prevented the ship's boat <b>from</b> <b>reaching</b> <b>the</b> shore to collect the men.|$|E
5|$|The British 2nd Parachute Brigade {{was part}} of the Operation Rugby {{airborne}} landings in August 1944. The operation was carried out by an ad hoc airborne formation called the 1st Airborne Task Force. Operation Rugby was itself part of the Operation Dragoon invasion of Southern France by the American 7th Army. The airborne task force landed in the River Argens valley with the objective of preventing German reinforcements <b>from</b> <b>reaching</b> <b>the</b> landing beaches.

5|$|The curve-shortening flow, {{and many}} of the results about the curve-shortening flow, can be {{generalized}} from the Euclidean plane to any two-dimensional Riemannian manifold. In order to avoid additional types of singularity, {{it is important for the}} manifold to be convex at infinity; this is defined to mean that every compact set has a compact convex hull, as defined using geodesic convexity. The curve-shortening flow cannot cause a curve to depart from its convex hull, so this condition prevents parts of the curve <b>from</b> <b>reaching</b> <b>the</b> boundary of the manifold.|$|E
5|$|The {{emission}} {{of dust and}} particles could have covered the entire surface of the Earth for several years, possibly a decade, creating a harsh environment for living things.

Over a longer period, sunlight would have been blocked <b>from</b> <b>reaching</b> <b>the</b> surface of the Earth by the dust particles in the atmosphere, cooling the surface dramatically. Photosynthesis by plants would also have been interrupted, affecting the entire food chain. A model of the event developed by Lomax et al. (2001) suggests that net primary productivity (NPP) rates may have increased to higher than pre-impact levels over the long term because of the high carbon dioxide concentrations.|$|E
