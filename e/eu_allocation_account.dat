40|$|Using {{a change}} in the rules of EU food aid policy in 1996, I {{investigate}} how donor countries react to <b>EU's</b> food aid <b>allocation.</b> On average if the EU stops allocating food aid to a small country, this reduces by 1. 4 the average number of other donors. Donors reactions are heterogeneous. Next, I develop a simple framework in which donors react to EU's action either indirectly because it changes the recipient's needs or directly because they are motivated by comparing their allocation with the one of EU. I derive a donor typology from this framework. Large donors and Nordic countries are motivated by direct comparison with the <b>EU</b> <b>allocation</b> while the WFP is driven by recipient-related motives...|$|R

The ex-post facto research design {{was used as a}} blueprint for collecting data. Data obtained from these local governments covering 1996 to 2010 was analyzed using the Ordinary Least Squares. The study revealed that revenue base has {{a significant impact on the}} creation of social assets. However, internally generated revenue which is a stable revenue source has been neglected due to over-dependence on statutory allocation from the federation account. Furthermore, the inability of state government to pay ten per cent (10 %) of its internally generated revenue to Councils as statutorily required, coupled with fallouts of the operation of the State Local Government Joint <b>Allocation</b> <b>Account</b> (JAAC) has further impaired the capacity of Councils to create social assets.

40|$|In January 2005 the EU-wide CO 2 {{emissions}} trading system (EU-ETS) has formally entered into operation. Within the new trading system, {{the right to}} emit a particular amount of CO 2 becomes a tradable commodity - called EU Allowances (EUAs) - and affected companies, traders and investors will face new strategic challenges. In this paper we investigate the nature of convenience yields for CO 2 emission allowance futures. We conduct an empirical study on price behavior, volatility term structure and correlations in different CO 2 EUA contracts. Our findings are that the market has changed from initial backwardation to contango with significant convenience yields in future contracts for the Kyoto commitment period starting in 2008. A high fraction of the yields {{can be explained by}} the price level and volatility of the spot prices.

40|$|Spanish {{emissions}} of carbon dioxide have grown by more than 40 % in 2004 with respect to 1990. This is not compatible with the <b>EU</b> <b>allocation</b> of Kyoto-mandated CO 2 reduction, even taking into account that Spanish emissions are allowed to rise by 15 % in 2010. The reasons for this situation stem from a combination of economic growth and an inefficient energy domain, coupled with a total absence of climate change policies. In this paper, we use a static general equilibrium model to assess the effects of a sudden and intense (ie, with a limited time to carry out significant abatement) CO 2 reduction by the Spanish economy. Our results show that the costs of immediate and medium-size reductions are not significant in the short run and could lead to the attaining of the EU agreed emissions level for Spain. However, delaying such action means that the degree of Spanish CO 2 emission reduction is much higher and that economic costs are far more important. Climate, energy, market...|$|R

We consider the case where each EU member individually meets a CO 2 emissions target, applying a country-wide cap and trade system to meet the target but without trade among countries. We use {{a version of the}} MIT Emissions Prediction and Policy Analysis (EPPA) model, here disaggregated to separately include 9 European Community countries and commercial and household transportation sectors. We compare our results with that of four energy-economic models that have provided detailed analyses of European climate change policy. In the absence of specific additional climate policy measures, the EPPA reference projections of carbon emissions increase by 14 % from 1990 levels. The EU-wide target under the Kyoto Protocol to the Framework Convention on Climate Change is a reduction in emissions to 8 % below 1990 levels. EPPA emissions projections are similar to other recent modeling results, but there are underlying differences in energy and carbon intensities among the projections. If EU countries were to individually meet the <b>EU</b> <b>allocation</b> of the Community-wide carbon cap specified in the Kyoto Protocol, we find using EPPA that carbon prices vary from $ 91 in the United Kingdom to $ 385 in Denmark; welfare costs range from 0. 6 % to 5 %...|$|R

Depreciation expense is a broad <b>allocation</b> <b>accounting</b> practice that treats different types of assets the same.

A simplified model using the earnings response coefficient will measure the relationship between earnings and returns for these different industries; this measurement is a way to quantify usefulness of accounting information. I hypothesize that investors of companies with high wasting assets will find depreciation more useful than those invested in companies with more real property. However, the results were not consistent with my hypothesis – depreciation did not matter more to investors of the industry with high wasting assets. The data set only included two distinct industries, which limited the sample size considerably, and might explain the results. Alternatively, the two groups of assets could be defined more broadly to include more industries for future research...|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{a study of the}} <b>EU</b> s <b>allocation</b> of {{earmarked}} food aid contributions among the WFP s development projects in different countries. The study is carried out on basis of five hypotheses deduced from a rational actor model and an organisational process model. The discussion of the hypotheses is based on results from regression analyses of the EU s food aid contributions provided to the WFP, in the period 1991 - 96. The study identifies and explains the factors that are fundamental for the allocation of these earmarked contributions among the various recipient countries. The study proves that the EU allocates significantly more food aid to the recipient countries classified as better off developing countries than to those classified as the most needy ones. The countries received amount of food aid, respectively, reflects the varying costs it takes to ensure proper execution of operations in connection with development projects owing to different circumstances in the host countries. Furthermore, the <b>EU</b> s <b>allocation</b> of food aid proves to be a result of a strictly regulated and standardised decision-making process which, consequently, implies that the countries amount of received food aid increases progressively with their respective number of received contributions. In addition, the study proves that the official objective for EU aid policy, to foster the observance of the observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms, and developing and consolidating democracy and the rule of law, stated under the Maastricht Treaty, 130 u, has no significant effect on the <b>EU</b> s <b>allocation</b> actions among the recipient countries. Neither are constraints formulated as imperatives to avoid a decrease in the European Development Fund found to have any significant effect on the allocation of food aid. These findings prove to proceed from two core elements of the contribution policy of which the noted factors are reflections. One such main element is the drive for efficiency in the relation to the allocation of food aid, while the other main element consists of an idealistic and moral justification of the allocation of such aid. These two main elements do not necessarily oppose each other. Rather, they characterise two basic types of purposes that are embodied into the comprehensive set of objectives and supply terms in connection with the EU s food aid, mainly stated in Council Regulations on food ai...|$|R
