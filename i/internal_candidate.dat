40|$|We {{draw upon}} an {{organizational}} learning and adaptation perspective {{to examine the}} antecedents and performance consequences of relay CEO successions relative to non-relay inside successions and outside successions. Data on 204 CEO successions in non-diversified U. S. manufacturing firms during the 1993 - 98 time period show that {{the likelihood of a}} relay succession is negatively associated with the number of <b>internal</b> <b>candidates</b> and positively associated with pre-succession firm performance. We also find that relay successions lead to better post-succession firm performance, particularly at lower levels of pre-succession firm performance and at higher levels of post-succession strategic and industry instability. 1 CEO succession is {{perhaps one of the most}} crucial events in the life of any firm because of the substantive and symbolic importance of the CEO position (Finkelstein & Hambrick, 1996; Kesner & Sebora, 1994). There are multiple options and related processes for selecting a successor CEO, including the selection and crowning of an heir apparent, a “horse race ” among <b>internal</b> <b>candidates,</b> and a comprehensive search of <b>internal</b> and external <b>candidates</b> (Finkelstein & Hambrick, 1996; Friedman & Olk, 1995).

40|$|Key Findings Firm-specific skills, {{or those}} skills {{acquired}} through {{working at a}} specific organization, are often necessary for succeeding at certain jobs; and internal employees possess higher levels of these skills than do people outside the firm. But, managers either fail to {{recognize the importance of}} firm-specific skills or discount their importance, as managers are just as likely to fill jobs requiring high levels of firm-specific skills with external hires as they are with <b>internal</b> <b>candidates.</b> Organizations frequently hire “star performers” into jobs where they are unable to demonstrate their superior performance. For some jobs, particularly those with many junior positions per senior position, managers have a strong mandate to fill those jobs internally rather than hire from outside. Some managers are aware that routinely selecting external rather than <b>internal</b> <b>candidates</b> for certain jobs can degrade employees’ morale, and tend to fill these positions internally rather than externally. Jobs in which specific employees are able to exhibit a wider range of performance quality tend to be filled more by internally promoted or transferred workers, rather than by external hires...|$|R
40|$|Excerpt] While the human-resources {{issues of}} concern to the {{hospitality}} industry are broad and complex, this paper focuses on the staffing decision that must be made when managers consider whether to hire an external candidate or make an internal transfer. This is a particularly tricky problem, because decision makers must compare one type of information on <b>internal</b> <b>candidates</b> (e. g., job-performance data) to other types of information collected on external candidates (e. g., interview results, test scores). Essentially, the person doing the selection and hiring must compare apples to oranges to make a decision. The paper argues that in such cases hiring decisions {{should be made to}} maximize the predicted performance of the new hire. The goal of the paper is to provide an estimate of the ability of past performance to predict future performance, so that such ratings can be compared meaningfully against external <b>candidates</b> or other <b>internal</b> <b>candidates.</b> Ultimately, the paper shows how different past-performance data can be compared against data on external candidates to help make hiring decisions...|$|R

50|$|Because of {{the close}} {{relationship}} between Fourth Baptist Church and Central Baptist Theological Seminary, {{and out of a}} desire to foster seminary training in the context of local church ministry, the original administrative structure of the school named the pastor of Fourth Baptist Church as the President of Central Baptist Theological Seminary. By the middle of the 1990s, the complexities in the duties of these two offices grew, particularly the responsibilities of a seminary president in the areas of student recruitment and fundraising increased. Thus, discussions began among the board, administration, and faculty regarding the separation of the two offices: pastor and president. In 1999 the board of trustees, in official action, created a committee for the revision of the seminary constitution with regard to the office of seminary President, among other items. The following year, the board of trustees unanimously approved the constitutional revision. In the fall of 2001, a presidential search committee was formed and in May 2003 Dr. Kevin T. Bauder became, by unanimous board action, the first full-time president of Central Baptist Theological Seminary. Samuel E. Horn succeeded Bauder on July 1, 2011, also by unanimous action of the board. Following three years in which he streamlined the seminary and significantly strengthened it for the future, Dr. Horn was hired by Bob Jones University to become Vice President of Ministerial Advancement as well as the Dean of the Seminary and School of Religion in October 2014. At the November 2014 board meeting, the presidential search committee proposed an <b>internal</b> <b>candidate</b> and a return to the pastor-president model in the person of Dr. Matt Morrell, pastor of Fourth Baptist Church. The board unanimously approved the appointment of Dr. Morrell pending the good pleasure of Fourth Baptist Church which also gave its overwhelming approval at a December 2014 congregational meeting. Dr. Morrell officially took office in January 2015, with Dr. Brent Belford, Vice President of Administration, being promoted to Provost to assist Dr. Morrell in the fulfillment of his duties. Dr. Brett Williams replaced Dr. Belford as Provost in 2016.|$|E

Consistent with this, I find that a firm's propensity to groom an <b>internal</b> <b>candidate</b> for the CEO position is related to firm size, degree of diversification, and industry structure.

40|$|This study {{addressed}} how hospital Registered Nurses {{experienced the}} unexpected departure of their Chief Nursing Officer (CNO) and the succession events that followed. The human resource interventions {{that were used}} and projected as meaningful to restore equilibrium were uncovered. ^ A naturalistic inquiry was conducted. The nurse participants were purposefully selected from management, coordinating, and clinical practice roles. Semi-structured tape recorded interviews, field notes, and artifacts {{were used in the}} analysis which revealed 38 themes clustered into six reporting categories. ^ The data confirmed that nurses at all levels experienced various emotions over the CNO 2 ̆ 7 s departure, with those hierarchically situated the closest to the CNO experiencing the most intense loss. The duration of emotional responses ranged from several days to two months. Some staff experienced apathy and diminished work output. Patient care was indirectly affected due to extra time spent in shift report and at the nurses 2 ̆ 7 station discussing rumors, and by management and staff resignations that were partially attributed to the CNO 2 ̆ 7 s departure. The CNO 2 ̆ 7 s departure symbolized a downward spiral for the organization, resulting in employee job insecurity. ^ The importance of the search for a successor was validated. The search marked an opportunity for staff to project future hopes for the nursing division and served to solidify for nurses the attributes they desired in a CNO. The search became tainted when the CEO projected support of an <b>internal</b> <b>candidate</b> before the legitimate search was conducted. In a change-driven environment, an <b>internal</b> <b>candidate</b> may have an edge over outside applicants in gaining the appointment. ^ Human resource interventions restore a destabilized nursing division, however few formal strategies were implemented beyond rumor control and initial staff communication. Recommended interventions were classified into four strategic areas: communication, transition, search process and candidate authentication, and CNO stabilization. ^ The replacement CNO faces a formidable task of taking charge by honoring staff emotions, establishing nursing division priorities, filling position vacancies, and promoting a future vision. ...|$|E
40|$|It {{is widely}} {{believed}} that corporate boards are overly reluctant to fire their CEOs. The conventional explanation for retaining a CEO regardless of his/her talent is that a CEO chooses the board members and {{has the power to}} fire them. However, very few studies have investigated how a new CEO is chosen. This paper explores an unexamined cause of board reluctance in removing a CEO : the incentive to minimize the leakage from the decision-makers future surplus. I argue that this same logic provides the theoretical explanation for how a new CEO is chosen for both voluntary and forced CEO replacements. I show that this incentive of the incumbent board and CEO often departs from the shareholders interest. In short, if the net surplus of the incumbent board and CEO is expected to be larger under an incumbent sub-standard CEO, or under an <b>internal</b> <b>candidate</b> rather than an external candidate, then they retain the incumbent sub-standard CEO or promote an internal CEO candidate, even though the expected corporate profit generated by appointing an external candidate is likely to have been greater.

40|$|This study explores when {{employees}} {{are more or}} less likely to voluntarily exit after having unsuccessfully applied for a new job within their organization. Although prior work suggests that employees react negatively to rejection, we propose that employees will react differently based on how their experience during the hiring process shapes their perceptions about their prospects for future internal mobility. Drawing on insights from the literatures on vacancy chains, social exchange, and expectancy violations, we argue that rejected internal candidates will use three sources of information from the hiring process in assessing their potential for future advancement: (1) whether the “winner” was an internal or external candidate, (2) how far they made it in the hiring process, and (3) how likely they were to be hired for the job. Using data on over 2, 000 internal losers at a single organization, we find that rejected internal candidates are less likely to leave when the job is filled with another <b>internal</b> <b>candidate,</b> when they make it further in the hiring process before rejection, and when their expectations of being hired for the job are likely to be lower. The results highlight the importance of understanding how rejection shapes careers and mobility in contemporary internal labor markets...|$|E
