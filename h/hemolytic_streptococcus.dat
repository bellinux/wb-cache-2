In pneumococci and <b>hemolytic</b> <b>streptococci</b> the major portion of the enzyme is bound to the cell structure. The enzyme from Clostridium welchii is associated with other carbohydrate-splitting enzymes in the culture medium and not with the bacterial cells. It is suggested that the disappearance of the mucoid capsule of group A <b>hemolytic</b> <b>streptococci</b> is due to enzymatic hydrolysis of the acid polysaccharide.

40|$|Objective: In this study, it {{is aimed}} {{to attain a}} general opinion about {{macrolide}} resistance and its prevalance in group A beta <b>hemolytic</b> <b>Streptococci</b> {{all over the country}} by studying isolates of group A beta hemolytic Streptoccocci causing tonsillopharyngitis from 8 centers in Turkey. In this study, the first results of macrolide resistance in a continuing study are reported. Material and Methods: From the first centers, isolates of group A beta <b>hemolytic</b> <b>Streptococci</b> from patients 5 - 15 years of age, throat cultures were carried via transport medium (blood agar-bacitracin) to Hacettepe University Medical Faculty Hospital and with disc diffusion technique erythromycin, clarithromycin, azithromycine and clindamycin resistance was studied. Results: From Hacettepe University Hospital 75 isolates, from Ankara University Hospital 18 isolates, from Ankara Hematology andOncology Hospital 31 isolates, from Selçuk University Hospital 51 isolates, from Süleyman Demirel University Hospital 69 isolates, from Mustafa Kemal University Hospital 14 isolates, from Bakırköy Sadi Konuk Research Hospital 9 isolates and from Ankara Akay Hospital 20 isolates were obtained which yielded 287 group A beta <b>hemolytic</b> <b>Streptococci.</b> Intermediate erythromycin resistance of the strains was 2 %, intermediate clindamycin resistance of the strains was 1. 1 %, intermediate azithromycin resistance of the strains was 1. 8 % and intermediate clarihtromycin resistance of the strains was 1. 8 %. Erythromycin resistance of group A beta <b>hemolytic</b> <b>Streptococci</b> was 1. 3 %, azithromycin resistance of group a beta <b>hemolytic</b> <b>Streptococci</b> was 2. 8 %, clarithromycin resistance of group A beta <b>hemolytic</b> <b>Streptococci</b> was 1. 3 %. Conclusion: In this study the anxiety that macrolide resistance of group A beta <b>hemolytic</b> <b>Streptococci</b> in our country is high should not be a serious problem. However macrolide resistance should be followed up intermittently with national and regional studies.

However, its exceptionally low toxicity, broad materials compatibility, and low odor combined with its antimicrobial properties indicates that it approaches the ideal for air disinfection purposes in occupied spaces. Much of the scientific work with triethylene glycol {{was done in the}} 1940s and 1950s, however that work has ably demonstrated the antimicrobial activity against airborne, solution suspension, and surface bound microbes. The ability of triethylene glycol to inactivate Streptococcus pneumoniae (original citation: pneumococcus Type I), Streptococcus pyogenes (original citation: Beta <b>hemolytic</b> <b>streptococcus</b> group A) and Influenza A virus in the air was first reported in 1943. Since the first report the following microorganisms {{have been reported in the}} literature to be inactivated in the air: Penicillium notatum spores, Chlamydophila psittaci (original citation: meningopneumonitis virus strain Cal 10 and psittacosis virus strain 6BC), Group C streptococcus, type 1 pneumococcus, Staphylococcus albus, Escherichia coli, and Serratia marcescens Bizio (ATCC 274). Solutions of triethylene glycol are known to be antimicrobial toward suspensions of Penicillium notatum spores, Streptococcus pyogenes (original citation: Beta <b>hemolytic</b> <b>streptococcus</b> Group A [...] ), Streptococcus pneumoniae (original citation: pneumococcus Type I), Streptococcus viridans, and Mycobacterium bovis (original citation: tubercle bacilli Ravenel bovine-type). Further, the inactivation of H1N1 influenza A virus on surfaces has been demonstrated. The latter investigation suggests that triethylene glycol may prove to be a potent weapon against future influenza epidemics and pandemics.|$|E
50|$|Organisms {{responsible}} for vulvitis in children include pinworms (Enterobius vermicularis), Candida yeast, and group A <b>hemolytic</b> <b>Streptococcus.</b> Though pinworms mainly affect the perianal area, {{they can cause}} itching and irritation to the vulva as well. Pinworms are treated with albendazole. Vulvar Candida infections are uncommon in children, and generally occur in infants after antibiotic therapy, and in children with diabetes or immunodeficiency. Candida infections cause a red raised vulvar rash with satellite lesions and clear borders, and are diagnosed by microscopically examining a sample treated with potassium hydroxide for hyphae. They are treated with topical butoconazole, clotrimazole, or miconazole. Streptococcus infections are characterized by a dark red discoloration of the vulva and introitus, and cause pain, itching, bleeding, and dysuria. They are treated with antibiotics.|$|E
40|$|Certain {{factors of}} climate are {{favorable}} to streptococcus respiratory diseases. In those tropical environments where <b>hemolytic</b> <b>streptococcus</b> {{is unusual in}} the throat flora, scarlet fever is unknown and rheumatic fever rare. In New York City, however, following epidemic waves of pharyngitis with <b>hemolytic</b> <b>streptococcus</b> the incidence of rheumatic fever rises precipitously. The correlation between the geographical distribution of <b>hemolytic</b> <b>streptococcus</b> and rheumatic fever is a definite one. Furthermore, in New York City during the seasons {{of the year in}} which <b>hemolytic</b> <b>streptococcus</b> is seldom recovered from the pharynx, acute attacks of rheumatism are unusual. Corresponding to the seasonal rise in <b>hemolytic</b> <b>streptococcus</b> infections, the curve of incidence of acute rheumatism shows a similar form. Among the children of wealthy patients, enjoying great protection, <b>hemolytic</b> <b>streptococcus</b> has been recovered infrequently from the throat, and rheumatism has not been encountered during this study. Among the poor under observation in New York City, however, the organism is found frequently in the pharyngeal flora, and rheumatic fever is common. The findings suggest that poverty and unhygienic living conditions favor both the activity of <b>hemolytic</b> <b>streptococcus</b> in the throat and the incidence of rheumatic fever. Moreover, localized outbreaks of rheumatism have been observed frequently following epidemics of "sore throat". Bacteriological studies of these upper respiratory infections demonstrate a close relationship between the advent of <b>hemolytic</b> <b>streptococcus</b> in the throat flora and the outbreak of rheumatic fever in susceptible individuals. In addition to these studies of streptococcus infections and their relationship to the development of rheumatic fever, observations of the rheumatic patient add further emphasis to this association. First, among a group of rheumatic children in an isolated environment, reactivation of the rheumatic process has been recognized only following the advent of <b>hemolytic</b> <b>streptococcus</b> in the throat flora. Also, an investigation of families in which several members have rheumatic heart disease has led to the same conclusion. Recrudescences of the disease have been observed under a variety of conditions among these individuals. However, the one constant factor in the outbreaks of recrudescences in rheumatic homes is their association with family epidemics of <b>hemolytic</b> <b>streptococcus</b> infection. Moreover, by studying rheumatic patients before, during and after transplantation to a tropical environment, it has been possible to demonstrate a close relationship between activity of the disease process and infection with <b>hemolytic</b> <b>streptococcus.</b> While the rheumatic patients remained in the tropics this organism was not recovered from the pharyngeal flora, and the disease process seemed quiescent. On return to New York City, those individuals who have escaped respiratory infection have remained symptom-free. However, of those who have contracted <b>hemolytic</b> <b>streptococcus</b> pharyngitis, each has developed a rheumatic attack within 3 weeks after infection. Finally, extensive bacteriological studies made in ambulatory rheumatic subjects over a period of 4 years have demonstrated that the individuals who escape respiratory disease remain free of rheumatic manifestations. On the other hand, the majority of rheumatic patients who contract <b>hemolytic</b> <b>streptococcus</b> pharyngitis experience shortly afterward a definite recrudescence of their disease. In conclusion, there is a close relationship between respiratory infection with <b>hemolytic</b> <b>streptococcus</b> and activity of the rheumatic process in susceptible individuals...|$|E

40|$|In {{the first}} two papers {{findings}} were presented which point to a close relationship between the incidence of rheumatic fever {{and the distribution of}} Streptococcus hemolyticus. The fact was emphasized that in the rheumatic subject a recrudescence of the disease process is usually preceded by pharyngeal infection with hemolytic streptococci. These organisms conspicuous in the throat flora during the period of infection preliminary to an attack of acute rheumatism fell into six antigenic groups and produced toxins which in 70 per cent were neutralized by a monovalent streptococcus antiserum. In the present study, four series of observations have been presented, demonstrating the development of immune bodies to <b>hemolytic</b> <b>streptococcus</b> during the course of rheumatic fever. The agglutination and complement fixation reactions of sera from patients with acute rheumatism suggest recent infection with streptococcus. Precipitin tests indicate {{that at the time of}} appearance of the rheumatic attack, individuals develop, in their blood, precipitins to the protein fractions of <b>hemolytic</b> <b>streptococcus.</b> That these precipitins may not be entirely specific is recognized from their cross-reactions with antigens of chemically related organisms. The studies made in association with E. W. Todd of England have demonstrated that at the onset of an attack of acute rheumatism, there occurs in each instance a rise in the antistreptolysin titer of the patient's serum. This titer is much higher than that observed in normal subjects or in patients with bacterial infection other than <b>hemolytic</b> <b>streptococcus.</b> This presence of antistreptolysin with an N. D. of 0. 005 cc. is considered strong evidence of recent infection by <b>hemolytic</b> <b>streptococcus.</b> In conclusion, the relationship between the incidence of <b>hemolytic</b> <b>streptococcus</b> and the geographical distribution of rheumatic fever, the relationship between the recrudescence in the rheumatic subject and infection of the throat with <b>hemolytic</b> <b>streptococcus,</b> the development of immune bodies for <b>hemolytic</b> <b>streptococcus</b> at the onset of the rheumatic attack and the apparently specific relationship of antistreptolysin formation to infection with hemolytic streptococcus,—together this combined evidence indicates that the infectious agent initiating the rheumatic process is Streptococcus hemolyticus...|$|E

40|$|Background: A {{resurgence}} of group A ß <b>hemolytic</b> <b>Streptococcus</b> infections such as fasciitis, cellulitis and Strptococcal Toxic Syndrome {{has been observed}} recently. Aim: To study the clinical features of patients with group A ß <b>hemolytic</b> <b>Streptococcus</b> infections in a regional hospital. Patients and methods: Retrospective review of medical records of patients notified as having a group A ß <b>hemolytic</b> <b>Streptococcus</b> tissue infection, between 1994 and 1999. Results: twenty four patients were notified in the period as having a group A ß <b>hemolytic</b> <b>Streptococcus</b> infection and 18 (13 male, mean age 39 tears old) had tissue involvement. Eleven patients had a fasciitis (61 %), six had a cellulitis (33 %) and 14 patients (77 %), a Streptococcal Toxic Shock Syndrome. Eight patients died during hospital stay. The infection portal of entry was identify in 13 patients (the skin in 10 and intramuscular injections in three). Deceased patients had a longer lapse of disease before admission than patients discharged alive (5 (range 3 h- 7 days) and 2. 1 (range 6 h- 5 days) respectively). In seven patients a quick serological test, designed for pharyngeal infections was performed and it was positive in five.

40|$|<b>Hemolytic</b> <b>streptococci</b> {{may cause}} several {{different}} clinical types of infection or, {{on the other}} hand, may be merely saprophytic and harmless to the human host.

Current experience indicates that in a city of some 160, 000 individuals, such as New Haven, only a few of Griffith's serological types are important as a cause of disease during a given year or perhaps over a period of several years. It is for this reason that we have recently completed the typing of strains of <b>hemolytic</b> <b>streptococci</b> which were recovered from more than a hundred children from August 1, 1939, to August 1, 1940.

Although the streptococcal fibrinolysin should, in all probability, be classified as an enzyme or catalyst, its activity differs, in certain respects, from proteolytic ferments. The special characters will be demonstrated by comparative experiments in which fibrin and other substrates are subjected to fibrinolysin and other enzymes. That the fibrinolytic principle of <b>hemolytic</b> <b>streptococci</b> induces a physical change in fibrin is self-evident by the transformation of solid matter to solution.

Sheldon (1) observed a series of severe recrudescences among the rheumatic children at Cheyne Hospital in the winter of 1930 - 31. Collis studied the throat flora of Sheldon's patients and reported (2) that out of thirty-two children with <b>hemolytic</b> <b>streptococcus</b> infections of the pharynx, twenty-four had rheumatic recrudescences. Bradley (3, 4) observed two severe outbreaks of acute rheumatism in English boarding schools, following epidemics of respiratory infections, both in 1929 and in 1931. The strains of <b>hemolytic</b> <b>streptococcus</b> associated with these three outbreaks were studied by Griffith (5). Agglutinin absorption tests showed that within each epidemic, the organisms from a number of patients were serologically identical but that the three epidemic strains were distinct. CoUis's outbreak followed infections with the Carter strain (Griffith type 13). Bradley's two outbreaks followed epidemics with th...|$|E

40|$|In {{previous}} {{papers from}} this laboratory (1) {{it has been}} shown that vitreous humor and umbilical cord contain a mucopolysaccharide which apparently consists of acetyl-glucosamine and glucuronic acid in equimolar concentrations. This mucopolysaccharide has been designated by the term hyaluronic acid. Mucopolysaccharides which appear to be chemically identical with hyaluronic acid have also been isolated from the mucoid phase of group A <b>hemolytic</b> <b>streptococci</b> (2), from synovial fluid (3), and from fowl sarcoma (4). It has further been shown (5) that the autolytic system of pneumococcus contains a factor which hydrolyzes hyaluronic acid. In the present paper an improved method for the preparation of the hydrolytic enzyme from pneumococci is described. The same enzyme may be prepared from group A <b>hemolytic</b> <b>streptococci,</b> from Clostridium welchii, and from beef spleen. Data are also presented to show that the hydrolyzing enzyme is not identical with the bacteriolytic system of the pneumococcus. Finally, brief reference is made to experiments suggesting a possible relation between the carbohydrate-splitting enzyme and the growth phase and virulence of group A <b>hemolytic</b> <b>streptococci.</b> EXPEI ~ ~NTAL Preparation of the Enzyme from Pneumococd. [...] The strain of pneumococcus employed in all experiments was a non-encapsulated, non-type-specific variant of a Type II pneumococcus. (According to older terminology the strain was in the rough phase; according to the terminology proposed by Dawson (6) the strain was in the smooth phase. ...|$|R
