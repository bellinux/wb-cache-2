40|$|We {{describe}} the dissociation of a diatomic Feshbach molecule {{due to a}} time-varying external magnetic field in a realistic trap and <b>guide</b> <b>setting.</b> An analytic expression for the asymptotic state of the two ultracold atoms is derived, which {{can serve as a}} basis for the analysis of dissociation protocols to generate motionally entangled states. For instance, the gradual dissociation by sequences of magnetic field pulses may delocalize the atoms into macroscopically distinct wave packets, whose motional entanglement can be addressed interferometrically. The established relation between the applied magnetic field pulse and the generated dissociation state reveals that square-shaped magnetic field pulses minimize the momentum spread of the atoms. This is required to control the detrimental influence of dispersion in a recently proposed experiment to perform a Bell test in the motion of the two atoms [C. Gneiting and K. Hornberger, Phys. Rev.

Design. Qualitative study comprising of in-depth interviews, using a semistructured interview <b>guide.</b> <b>Setting.</b> Participants were recruited from the local community, three community health centres, and a community-based diabetes education centre servicing a low-income population in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Participants. Twenty-one English-speaking adults with a diagnosis of diabetes and having experienced food insecurity {{in the past year}} (based on three screening questions). Method. Using six phases of analysis, we used qualitative, deductive thematic analysis to transcribe, code, and analyze participant interviews. Main Findings. Three themes emerged from our analysis of participants’ experiences of living with food insecurity and diabetes: (1) barriers to accessing and preparing food, (2) social isolation, and (3) enhancing agency and resilience.

DESIGN: Sixteen focus groups conducted with a key word <b>guide.</b> <b>SETTING</b> AND PARTICIPANTS: Two private and 2 public secondary schools in Cotonou, Benin. One hundred fifty-three students aged 13 to 19 years, 54 % girls. ANALYSIS: The focus groups were audiotaped, transcribed, and analyzed. Three a priori categories from the Social Cognitive Theory {{were used for the}} coding: socioenvironmental, personal, and behavioral factors. Additionally, the data were checked to determine whether new categories should be created. RESULTS: Major determinants in the school were availability and accessibility of fruits and vegetables, nutrition education, and the competition of unhealthful foods. Food safety emerged as a strong barrier to the adolescents' fruit and vegetable consumption outside home and particularly at school. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Except for food safety, the determinants of fruit and vegetable intake in Beninese adolescents were similar to those in high-income countries. The food safety of fruits and vegetables outside home is a key issue to be studied in detail and integrated in any intervention in Benin and potentially other low- and middle-income countries...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Self-management is {{considered}} important in chronic illness, and contemporary health policy recommends participation in {{support groups for}} individuals with chronic conditions. Although withdrawal from or non-participation in support groups is an important problem, there is limited knowledge about individuals' own motivation for participation in or withdrawal from self-management support groups. OBJECTIVES: To investigate how individuals with type 2 diabetes perceive participation in group-based self-management support. DESIGN: This is a qualitative focus group study using a semi-structured interview <b>guide.</b> <b>SETTING</b> AND PARTICIPANTS: Sixteen participants diagnosed with type 2 diabetes {{were included in the}} study. Individuals with and without group affiliations were mixed in three focus groups to trigger discussions. In the analysis, reoccurring themes of engagement and discussions between participants were focused within a theoretical frame of institutional logic. The focus groups are seen as social spaces where participants construct identity. RESULTS: Both participation and non-participation in group-based self-management support are associated with dealing with the stigma of having type 2 diabetes. Negotiations contribute to constructing an illness dignity {{as a response to the}} logic of moral responsibility for the disease. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION:Contemporary policy contributes to societal understandings of individuals with type 2 diabetes as morally inadequate. Our study shows that group-based self-management support may counteract blame and contribute in negotiations of identity for individuals with type 2 diabetes. This mechanism makes participation in groups beneficial for some but stigma inducing for others...|$|E

This guide, drawing on grantmaker experiences, looks at how funding {{in connection with}} a summit can advance grantees' programmatic goals and help them get the most from a summit experience. Highlights Why fund {{in connection with a}} summit Working with grantees to advance their goals Supporting their efforts to engage the media effectively Understanding the debates about summits What's in the <b>Guide?</b> <b>Setting</b> the Stage: What are international summits? What can they accomplish? And what issues can be expected to arise along the way? This chapter lists a few of the opportunities and challenges that grantmakers may encounter. Why Fund in Connection with a Summit? International summits are complex and sometimes controversial events, but with immense potential value. Here, grantmakers describe some of the ways that funding in connection with a summit can advance program goals. How Some Grantmakers Prepare: Well before they make the first grant, grantmakers can prepare themselves by learning about the process, developing program goals and networking with potential partners. This section includes some preliminary actions grantmakers can take {{to get the most out}} of a summit opportunity. Working with Grantees: What kinds of activities could a grantmaker fund? From help with coalition-building, to providing funding for summit news bulletins, grantmakers offer ideas about how to support grantees and other actors before and during a summit. Engaging the Media: The quality and extent of media coverage can have a big impact on a summit's success. How can a funder help grantees prepare to work well with the media? In this section, grantmakers offer some experience and guidance on how to engage the world's eyes and ears. Beyond the Summit: Work doesn't end when a summit closes its doors. Here are examples of ways in which funders have contributed to important summit follow-up activities. The Debate about Summits: Grantmaking in connection with summits can offer short-term benefits to participants and longer-term impacts on policy. There are costs as well as benefits associated with mobilizing governments and non-governmental organizations at a worldwide gathering. So, before stepping into this arena, it's wise to understand the debate about summits. Here are issues commonly raised and how some grantmakers respond...|$|E
40|$|Introduction A toolbox {{designed}} specifically for computing spatial correlations of gigantic datasets, with support for regular sized datasets as well. The toolbox {{takes advantage of the}} memory mapping functionality in MATLAB to operate on a chunk of the data at a time. The overal strategy is ineffective for parrallelization as it involves tremendous overhead, but it is ideal for "sequentialization", when the algorithm {{needs to be able to}} run on a simple everyday machine, and it is okay for it to take a bit longer than the optimal calculation. I refer to it as the Patched Correlation Method since it uses patches of data at a time, although you are free to not call it that. Correlation and Convolution GG = CorrMaster('full','auto',cutoff,H 1) and GG = CorrMaster('full','cross',cutoff,H 1,H 2) will compute the plain old circular ('full' option) auto or cross correlation using FFTs. It will return the correlation results trimmed by a cutoff, with the final output being size 2 *cutoff- 1 in all dimensions, and the 0 index shifted to the center. GG = CorrMaster('patched','auto',cutoff,DataFile,winmulti) and GG = CorrMaster('patched','cross',cutoff,DataFile,winmulti,DataFile 2) will compute the patched auto or cross correlation. The "datafile" is the path to a matfile that contains the data you need to process, already zero padded by exactly cutoff on BOTH sides (you can use padarray for this or the memory mapped version below) and the name of the variable has to be H 1. An example H 1 for 100 x 100 image is with a cutoff of 20 is a variable H 1 inside a data. m file that is 140 x 140 with 20 pixels zero padded on each side. There is a heuristic in place to calculate an optimal patch size for minimum memory requirement to divide up the data, and winmulti is the multiplier for that size. So a winmulti of 2 will use twice the optimal size. This is useful if you can afford the extra memory, since the higher the winmulti, the faster the computation time (as long as you don't go out of bounds into a pagefile). There are two files to pad and element-wise multiply 2 D or 3 D data for use with this code called ewpmfile and padmfile, which should be straight forward to use since they share the same input terminology, with the exception of being able to handle any variable inside a matfile chosen by you, not only H 1. Use for 2 -Point Statistics The following article describes in detail the theory necessary to properly utilize this toolbox to calculate 2 -pt statistics: [URL] Below will be a less detailed <b>guide.</b> <b>Setting</b> Up a Problem The user is responsible with finding a suitable statistical question they want answered, with a clearly defined event and a clearly defined population. Depending on the question, the quantity they need to calculate and its pre-processing stages can change significantly. Only some of many considerations are exampled below: If your problem requires non-periodic boundaries you need to pad your image on all dimensions with 0 values in the size of the longest vector of interest. Let us assume you have a microstructure volume represented in a 100 x 100 x 100 voxel grid, and you are interested in spatial statistics of vectors of size that fit inside a 20 x 20 x 20 voxel grid; then you would pad 20 voxels of 0 values on all 3 dimensions of your data, resulting in a 120 x 120 x 120 voxel microstructure. If your problem requires masking you need to create a second image with the exact size of your actual input, with values representing mask values. This feature can be used when there is an uncertainty associated with each pixel, or when the image represents non-rectangular data to strike out pixels that don't belong in the data etc [...] If you need to perform element-wise multiplication or padding of very large image files, use the memory mapped versions mentioned above. Converting the Problem to a Computation Here is an example procedure that calculates a non-periodic memory mapped auto correlation without a mask: I want to find the probability of finding every possible vector that is shorter than cutoff in this data, while discarding any vector that crosses the data boundaries. padmfile('yourdir. m',myvar,cutoff,'mydata. m') <- Pad the image by cutoff. mydata will be saved with a variable named H 1 for convenience. GG = CorrMaster('patched','auto',cutoff,'mydata', 2. 23) <- Calculate auto-correlation. padmfile('normalizer. m',myvar,cutoff,'mynorm. m') <- Since there is no mask, the normalization is a matrix of ones everywhere, then padded by cutoff. BB = CorrMaster('patched','auto',cutoff,'mynorm', 2. 23) <- Calculate normalization. AutoCorrelation=GG. /BB <- Because I asked the question this way, this is the corresponding 2 -pt statistics. TwoPoint TwoPoint is a wrapper for a handful of common two point statistic calculation schemes. It calculates the two point statistics using the straightforward convolution method without patching. Use it if you have small datasets or an abundance of memory. GG = TwoPoint('auto',cutoff,periodicity,H 1) will calculate the autocorrelation of H 1. GG = TwoPoint('auto',cutoff,periodicity,H 1,M 1) will calculate the autocorrelation of H 1 with a mask M 1. GG = TwoPoint('cross',cutoff,periodicity,H 1,H 2) will calculate the crosscorrelation of H 1 with H 2. GG = TwoPoint('cross',cutoff,periodicity,H 1,H 2,M 1) will calculate the crosscorrelation of H 1 with H 2, with a uniform mask M 1. GG = TwoPoint('cross',cutoff,periodicity,H 1,H 2,M 1,M 2) will calculate the crosscorrelation of H 1 with mask M 1 and H 2 with mask M 2...|$|E
