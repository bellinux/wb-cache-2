5|$|Yet another {{trait that}} sets most lemurs apart from anthropoid {{primates}} is their long lifespan {{together with their}} high infant mortality. Many lemurs, including the ring-tailed lemur, have adapted to a highly seasonal environment, which has affected their birthrate, maturation, and twinning rate (r-selection). This helps them to recover rapidly from a population crash. In captivity, lemurs can live {{twice as long as}} they do in the wild, benefiting from consistent nutrition that meets their dietary requirements, medical advancements, and improved understanding of their <b>housing</b> <b>requirements.</b> In 1960, it was thought that lemurs could live between 23 and 25 years. We now know that the larger species can live for more than 30 years without showing signs of aging (senescence) and still be capable of reproduction.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} 421-a program detailed a {{tax exempt}} period {{of three years}} or the construction period, whichever is shorter. During this period, the builder paid zero property taxes. Afterwards, a ten-year abatement period began, in which builders were exempt from the increase in taxes for two years, followed by a 20% decrease in the tax exemption every two years (80% exempt in year three, 60% exempt in year five, etc.) This would last until after the tenth year, in which the builder would begin paying the full property taxes mandated for {{the total value of}} the property. All builders of multi-family housing outside of the GEA had a right to this deduction.

40|$|Taking the {{building}} sector’s {{huge impact on}} the environment into consideration, the European Union aims at ‘nearly zero-energy’ buildings by 2021, imposing strict requirements for the (non-renewable) operational energy consumption. The life cycle energy consumption of these nearly zero-energy buildings is an aspect of growing interest, encompassing both the life cycle embodied energy and end-of-life energy in building products, and the operational energy use throughout {{the building}} service life. Moreover, in Belgium zero-energy houses have to meet the passive <b>house</b> <b>requirements</b> in order to enjoy tax benefits. This contribution examines the life cycle energy consumption for various scenarios of zero-energy houses by means of Life Cycle Energy Analysis, thus examining whether passive <b>house</b> <b>requirements</b> are useful from the perspective of life cycle energy consumption. For the various zero-energy house scenarios, an analysis is provided of the contribution of the different components, such as building construction materials and building services, to the total life cycle energy consumption. Results reveal that a zero-energy house roughly consumes 2 to 4 times less non-renewable life cycle energy than a typical Belgian passive house, and 3 to 5 times less than a house following current standard building practice. Secondly, the results demonstrate that there is no clear distinction in favor of either passive or standard zero-energy house scenarios. In essence, the lower embodied energy in building services in the passive house scenarios counterbalances the higher building construction embodied energy and vice versa for the standard house. As a conclusion, passive <b>house</b> <b>requirements</b> are not considered an essential criterion for zero-energy houses from a life cycle energy point of view. The research however reveals that the choice of building construction materials and of building services types are the determining factors influencing life cycle energy consumption. Large energy savings up to 30 kWh/year/m² can be obtained through a proficient choice of building materials and building services for zero-energy houses. Regarding the embodied energy in building constructions, a timber frame house and massive brick house can be equally energy efficient. Looking at the embodied energy in building services, the embodied energy in wood pellets and in photovoltaic panels reveal to be of major importance...|$|R
