25|$|Some {{forms of}} neglect {{may also be}} very mild—for example, in a {{condition}} called extinction where competition from the ipsilesional stimulus impedes perception of the contralesional stimulus. These patients, when asked to fixate on the examiner's nose, can detect fingers being wiggled on the affected side. If the examiner were to wiggle his or <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>on</b> both the affected and unaffected sides of the patient, the patient will report seeing movement only on the ipsilesional side.|$|E
25|$|The drone strings produce steady sounds at fixed pitches. The melody string(s) (French chanterelle(s), Hungarian dallamhúr(ok)) are {{stopped with}} tangents {{attached}} to keys {{that change the}} vibration length of the string, much as a guitarist uses his or <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>on</b> the fretboard of a guitar. In the earliest hurdy-gurdies these keys were arranged to provide a Pythagorean temperament, but in later instruments the tunings have varied widely, with equal temperament most common because it allows easier blending with other instruments. However, because the tangents can be adjusted to tune individual notes, {{it is possible to}} tune hurdy-gurdies to almost any temperament as needed. Most contemporary hurdy-gurdies have 24 keys that cover a range of two chromatic octaves.|$|E
60|$|MRS MARCH goes to {{the window}} and drums <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>on</b> the pane.|$|E
60|$|Emily laid <b>her</b> <b>finger</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> lips, but {{the word}} Irene had caught James' ear.|$|R
60|$|Brigida laid <b>her</b> <b>finger</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> lips, {{and called}} impatiently {{to the person}} outside to come in.|$|R
60|$|As {{he did so}} his eye happily caught that of {{the fair}} Princess. She was {{watching}} him with a strange look, admiring, warning, imploring; and when she saw that he noticed her, she laid <b>her</b> <b>finger</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> lip in token of silence, crossed herself devoutly, and then laid <b>her</b> <b>finger</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> lips again, as if beseeching him to be patient and silent {{in the name of}} Him who answered not again.|$|R
60|$|She put out her arm {{and laid}} the tips of <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>on</b> Will's coat-sleeve.|$|E
60|$|With a {{pressure}} of <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>on</b> his and a beckoning of her eyes, she drew his ear {{down to her}} lips.|$|E
60|$|For {{a moment}} or two, she {{remained}} smiling, and lightly tapping <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>on</b> the table. Suddenly she started, and her face blanched.|$|E
6000|$|But Romola {{no sooner}} saw the {{movement}} than {{she looked at}} him with significant gravity, and placed <b>her</b> <b>finger</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> lips-- ...|$|R
60|$|Susy had put <b>her</b> <b>finger</b> <b>on</b> {{the crease}} between his brows which this {{supposition}} had made, {{and tried to}} rub it out.|$|R
60|$|And {{she kept}} <b>her</b> <b>finger</b> <b>on</b> the softly planted paw of the cat, {{and her voice}} had the same whimsical, humorous note of bullying.|$|R
6000|$|Miss Harcourt drew {{off three}} or four inches and drummed with the tips of <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>on</b> the table. [...] "I don’t care what you like," [...] she said humming.|$|E
60|$|I {{repeated}} the question. The lips moved. She placed {{the tips of}} <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>on</b> them. Again I {{repeated the}} question. “Yes,” Maud announced. We {{looked at each other}} expectantly.|$|E
60|$|His fingers strayed along <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>on</b> the {{keyboard}} as {{he bent to}} her, first kissing her hair, then slowly turning her face up to his and kissing her willing lips.|$|E
6000|$|CLARE sits tracing {{a pattern}} with <b>her</b> <b>finger</b> <b>on</b> the cloth, <b>her</b> [...] eyes lowered. Once she raises them, and follows ARNAUD's dark [...] rapid figure.|$|R
60|$|A blush settled {{again on}} her face; and half in effort, half in spontaneity, she put <b>her</b> <b>finger</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> cheek. He almost devotionally kissed the spot.|$|R
60|$|With a mother's {{instinct}} Mrs Clare had put <b>her</b> <b>finger</b> <b>on</b> {{the kind}} of trouble that would cause such a disquiet as seemed to agitate her son.|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Reynolds wiped <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>on</b> {{her apron}} {{and shook hands}} with him cordially. [...] "I s'pose you're hungry as a wolf. Wal, I'll hurry up dinner. Mebbe you'd like a biscuit?" ...|$|E
60|$|Hetty {{sat with}} <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>on</b> the keyboard, the soft {{light of the}} lamps in the sconces shining upon her--very pretty, very dainty, an unusual {{softness}} in the eyes. She turned towards Clavering.|$|E
60|$|But Rachel made no {{response}} to this invitation either. She stopped with <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>on</b> {{the handle of the}} door, as if she remembered that some sort of pronouncement was due from her.|$|E
6000|$|I {{ran to the}} door. The widow laid <b>her</b> <b>finger</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> lips. [...] "Not a word, mind, to Minna!" [...] she whispered. [...] "We {{understand}} each other--don't we?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'God {{will protect}} His own,' {{answered}} she calmly, laying <b>her</b> <b>finger</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> lips; and then breaking from his grasp in {{the strength of}} her heroism, vanished into the night.|$|R
6000|$|... 'O, {{if that is}} {{what you}} mean,' she said mischievously, 'you should have noticed the exact spot. It was there.' She put <b>her</b> <b>finger</b> <b>on</b> a {{particular}} portion of its edge.|$|R
6000|$|He did not answer, so {{she turned}} slowly round on the stool, opened the piano, and laid <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>on</b> the keys. At {{the sound of}} the chord he started up, saying: [...] "Then I'm going." ...|$|E
60|$|Mysie's bashfulness was conquered by her fear. She placed <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>on</b> her lips, in token {{that he must}} {{observe the}} most strict silence, and then pointed {{to the door to}} {{intimate}} that it was watched.|$|E
60|$|She looked round for his jacket. He annoyed her a little, {{by being}} {{completely}} oblivious of her. She got his handkerchief and wiped <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>on</b> it. Then {{of her own}} kerchief she made a pad for the wound.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's you," [...] whispered Jack, {{throwing}} the white carnation at Jill, and she threw back the red one, with <b>her</b> <b>finger</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> lips, for the tale {{was very interesting}} now.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Hush!' she said, with <b>her</b> <b>finger</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> lips. 'His {{eyes are}} closing. He'll be {{conscious}} when he next opens them. Shall I {{give you a}} leading word to say to him?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He doesn't {{look quite}} right; {{as though he}} had been set down on the wrong planet, you know," [...] said Mrs. Cooke, <b>her</b> <b>finger</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> temple. [...] "What is he like?" ...|$|R
60|$|She averted her face. A languid silence, {{as if all}} the {{electricity}} of the situation had been discharged in this flash of passion, lasted for some time. Razumov had not flinched. Suddenly she laid the tips of <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>on</b> his sleeve.|$|E
60|$|Mercy {{raised one}} {{helpless}} hand, and laid <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>on</b> the wrist. While {{she was still}} vainly trying to feel for the beating of the pulse, Surgeon Surville (alarmed for the ladies) hurried in to inquire if any harm had been done.|$|E
6000|$|... "Try, {{you are so}} weak, you'll soon drop off;" [...] and, {{laying the}} cool tips of <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>on</b> his eyelids, she kept them shut till he yielded with a long sigh of mingled weariness and pleasure, and was asleep before he knew it.|$|E
6000|$|... "No. Don't be silly." [...] She {{critically}} explored his face. [...] "How {{funny to}} have a mole in your eyebrow!" [...] She put <b>her</b> <b>finger</b> <b>on</b> it. [...] "I never saw it before." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Only wine, {{to signify}} {{the spirit of}} life, and flowers to symbolise its fragrance," [...] and she laid <b>her</b> <b>finger</b> <b>on</b> a cup-like depression, still {{apparent}} in the marble, into which the wine was poured.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the story}} of the Sleeping Beauty, a spell is placed on the princess that when she reaches her 16th birthday, she will [...] "prick <b>her</b> <b>finger</b> <b>on</b> the spindle of a {{spinning}} wheel and die" ...|$|R
