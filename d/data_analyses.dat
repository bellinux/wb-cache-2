25|$|The {{history of}} {{physical}} oceanographic {{approaches to the}} Somali current has begun from the mid 1960s with serious interests. From the mid-1960s until the late 1970s several magnificent theoretical studies had been proposed and gave physical answers of the current behaviors and formations. After the late 1970s, the physics of the Somali current enhanced by ocean <b>data</b> <b>analyses</b> with outstanding field measurements of the current properties. The research footprints during the early 1960s to the late 1970s are presented as below.|$|E
25|$|Stack {{analyzed}} {{the results from}} 42 studies and found that those measuring {{the effect of a}} celebrity suicide story were 14.3 times more likely to find a copycat effect than studies that did not. Studies based on a real as opposed to fictional story were 4.03 times more likely to uncover a copycat effect and research based on televised stories was 82% less likely to report a copycat effect than research based on newspapers. Other scholars have been less certain about whether copycat suicides truly happen or are selectively hyped. For instance, fears of a suicide wave following the death of Kurt Cobain never materialized in an actual increase in suicides. Furthermore, there is evidence for an indirect Werther effect, i.e. the perception that suicidal media content influences others which, in turn, can concurrently or additionally influence one person's own future thoughts and behaviors. Similarly the researcher Gerard Sullivan has critiqued research on copycat suicides, suggesting that <b>data</b> <b>analyses</b> have been selective and misleading, and that the evidence for copycat suicides are much less consistent than suggested by some researchers.|$|E

2500|$|Elongation factor-1α (EF-1α) <b>data</b> <b>analyses</b> support Mycetozoa as a {{monophyletic}} group, though rRNA trees {{place it}} as a polyphyletic group. [...] Further, these data {{support the idea}} that the dictyostelid and myxogastrid are more closely related to each other than they are the protostelids. [...] EF-1α analysis also placed the Mycetozoa as the immediate outgroup for the animal-fungal clade. Latest phylogenetic data place dictyostelids firmly within supergroup Amoebozoa, along with myxomycetes.

2500|$|Richard Lindzen, the Alfred P.

[...] Lindzen also suggested that four other scientists [...] "apparently" [...] lost their funding or positions after questioning the scientific underpinnings of global warming. Lindzen himself has been the recipient of money from energy interests such as OPEC and the Western Fuels Association, including [...] "$2,500 a day for his consulting services", as well as funding from US federal sources including the National Science Foundation, the Department of Energy, and NASA.|$|E

2500|$|Nursing {{professionals}} work in {{a stressful}} environment. According to a report conducted at Lehigh Valley Hospital and Health Network (LVHHN), nurses {{are at high risk}} for chronic burnout and stress. The nurse's roles are regarded as stress-filled based upon physical labor, human suffering, work hours, staffing, and interpersonal relationships. Work stress and burnout are significant concerns on both an individualistic and an organizational level. On an individualistic level, stress symptoms can contribute to health problems such as high blood pressure and diabetes. On an organizational level, work stress may lead to absenteeism and turnover, which impedes on the quality of care. According to a 2016 National Healthcare Retention & RN Staffing Report published by NSI Nursing Solutions, the national average turnover rate among nurses is 17.2%, a 0.8% increase from 2014. During the study, 27 nurses voluntarily participated in an 8-week-stress-reduction program called Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR). <b>Data</b> <b>analyses</b> revealed that the MBSR program had significant benefits that could be categorized into two. “The early weeks of the training program conveyed that benefits were related to increased relaxation, slowing down, feeling a sense of peace, and learning to be in the present moment." [...] Results in the late weeks of the training program were linked to self-acceptance, self-awareness and self-care.|$|E
