500|$|In Things Fall Apart, Okonkwo's furious manhood overpowers {{everything}} [...] "feminine" [...] in his life, {{including his}} own conscience. For example, when he feels bad after being forced to kill his adopted son, he asks himself: [...] "When <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>become</b> a shivering old woman?" [...] It is also argued that one’s chi, or personal god, is the ‘mother within’. This understanding further demonstrates how Okonkwo’s hypermasculinity corrupts his conscience, as his contempt for his own mother and other women prevents him from being in harmony with his chi. He views all things feminine as distasteful, {{in part because they}} remind him of his father's laziness and cowardice. His father was considered an agbala—a word that refers to a man without title, but is also synonymous with ‘woman’. Thus, Okonkwo not only regrets his father’s lack of success, but attributes it to a lack of masculinity. Okonkwo’s feminization of all things lacking success or power is a common theme throughout the novel. His obsession with maleness is fuelled by an intense fear of femaleness, which he expresses through physical and verbal abuse of his wives, his violence towards his community, his constant worry that his son Nwoye is not manly enough, and his wish that his daughter Ezinma had been born a boy. The women in the novel, meanwhile, are obedient, quiet, and absent from positions of authority– despite the fact that Igbo women were traditionally involved in village leadership. Nevertheless, the need for feminine balance is highlighted by Ani, the earth goddess, and the extended discussion of [...] "Nneka" [...] ("Mother is supreme") in chapter fourteen. Ekwefi’s perseverance and love for Ezinma, despite her many miscarriages, is seen as a tribute to Igbo womanhood, which is typically defined by motherhood. Okonkwo's defeat is seen by some as a vindication of the need for a balancing feminine ethos. Some have also argued that all of Okonkwo’s failures are tied to his contempt and fear of women and his inability to form quality personal relationships with the women in his life—his wives, his children, and his own mother. Achebe has expressed frustration at frequently being misunderstood on this point, saying that [...] "I want to sort of scream that Things Fall Apart {{is on the side of}} women... And that Okonkwo is paying the penalty for his treatment of women; that all his problems, all the things he did wrong, can be seen as offenses against the feminine." [...] Indeed, it is argued that Okonkwo’s violent and vehement anti-women position is the exception, not the norm, within his community of Umuofia and the wider Igbo society. Still, post-colonial African writing is intensely male-centred, a phenomenon that is not alleviated by the frequent trope of the African woman as the [...] "embodiment of the male writer’s vision for the new Africa". It is argued that even when women and their lives are more centrally depicted in literature, the male writer continues to be the visionary while the woman is the [...] "sign" [...] of changes to come.|$|E

His cut-up poem, Minutes to Go, was broadcast by the BBC and later published in a pamphlet. I was in Paris in the summer of 1960; this was after the publication there of Naked Lunch. I became {{interested in}} the possibilities of this technique, and I began experimenting myself. Of course, when you think of it, The Waste Land was the first great cut-up collage, and Tristan Tzara had done a bit along the same lines. Dos Passos used the same idea in 'The Camera Eye' sequences in USA. I felt I had been working toward the same goal; thus it was a major revelation to me when I actually saw it being done.|$|E

You have to admit that it was quite difficult to get 10 thousand voices of the miners in his native region. We were met with the metal rods and bicycle chains. And in one of the most aristocratic districts of Paris, on Île Saint-Louis, where old marquises, counts and countesses, dukes and duchesses live, one respective lady suddenly asked me after my report: “Is it true, Monsieur Moskovitch, that unnatural relationships occur between the men in the colonial troops where you served during the war?” I answered her honestly, because you shouldn’t lie to your potential voters, so I told her: “Madame, even a black soldier will look to you like a beauty after six months in the desert!"
