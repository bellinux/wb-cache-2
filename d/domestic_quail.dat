40|$|To {{assess the}} genetic {{diversity}} of domestic Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica) populations, and their genetic relationships, we examined mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) D-loop sequences and microsatellite markers for 19 Japanese quail populations. The populations included nine laboratory lines established in Japan (LWC, Quv, RWN, WE, AWE, AMRP, rb-TKP, NIES-L, and W), six meat-type quail lines reimported from Western countries (JD, JW, Estonia, NIES-Br, NIES-Fr, and NIES-Hn), one commercial population in Japan, and three wild quail populations collected from three Asian areas. The phylogenetic tree of mtDNA D-loop sequences revealed two distinct haplotype groups, Dloop-Group 1 and Dloop-Group 2. Dloop-Group 1 included a dominant haplotype representing {{most of the}} quail populations, including wild quail. Dloop-Group 2 was composed of minor haplotypes found in several laboratory lines, two meat-type lines, and a few individuals in commercial and wild quail populations. Taking the breeding histories of domestic populations into consideration, {{these results suggest that}} <b>domestic</b> <b>quail</b> populations may have derived from two sources, i. e., domestic populations established before and after World War II in Japan. A discriminant analysis of principal components and a Bayesian clustering analysis with microsatellite markers indicated that the domestic populations are clustered into four genetic groups. The two major groups were Microsat-Group 1, which contained WE, and four WE-derived laboratory lines (LWC, Quv, RWN, and AWE), and Microsat-Group 2 consisting of NIES-L, JD, JW, Estonia, NIES-Br, NIES-Fr, NIES-Hn, W, and commercial and wild populations. The remaining two lines (AMRP and rb-TKP) were each clustered into a separate clade. This hierarchical genetic difference between <b>domestic</b> <b>quail</b> populations is attributed to the genetic background derived from two different genetic sources-the pre-war and post-war populations-which is well supported by their breeding histories...|$|E
40|$|In {{the autumn}} the vas deferens of the Italian variety of <b>domestic</b> <b>quail</b> {{appeared}} as a single, thin, and straight duct along its total extension. Thus, transversal histologic sections of this duct showed a circular tubular shape. The pseudoestratified columnar epithelium that lined the vas deferens presented longitudinal folds which invaded the lumen frequently empty of spermatozoa. Although in the winter, spring and summer the usual morphological appearance of the quail's vas deferens {{was seen as a}} highly coiling duct. So, each transversal histologic section of the vas deferens, in all the segments, showed parallel cut sections of the duct being irregular in shape and variable in number and interconnected by the adventitial loose connective tissue. In these observations, the tubular lumen was totally performed by spermatozoa and seminal fluid. Consequently, with previous base on the testis kinetics of the Italian quail variety, it was concluded that the spermatozoa production, followed by emission, storage and ejaculation of spermatozoa through the vas deferens did not stop during the winter, spring and summer, but ceased in the autumn the quiescent phase of the circannual reproductive cycle in this bird...|$|E

Quail eggs are precious aliments and also have important drug value. It is a natural source of vitamins and mineral substances. However, in the speciality literature there is little information regarding the quality indexes (morphological, physical and chemical) of quail eggs. After measuring the egg shape index, the eggs volume, the specific egg weight and after also analysing the longitudinal and transversal diameter ratio we reached a series of conclusion: the average weight was of 10. 44 ± 0. 13 grams, the eggs volume was of 9. 675 – 10. 472 cm 3 and a specific weight of 0. 996 ± 0. 01 g/cm 3.

The decline of this subspecies has spurred an annual release {{of large numbers of}} <b>domestic</b> Japanese <b>quail.</b> Prezygotic and postzygotic isolating mechanisms have not been established between these two subspecies, enhancing the risk of hybridization. In addition, anecdotal reports suggest that hybridization is commonly practiced in game farms of <b>domestic</b> <b>quails.</b> In this article, we present the results of behavioural characterization of the quails produced by two European game farms: one French and one Italian. First, we looked for evidences of hybridization in both game farms. Using actographic methods, we measured migratory tendency. Birds, hatched in summer, were submitted in autumn to an artificial increase of daylength (LD 14 : 10) for 60 days. In quails, the length of the cloacal vent which is a good indicator of sexual development, was monitored every 10 days. We noted the appearance of cloacal foam in males and egg-laying activity in females.

40|$|The {{common quail}} (Coturnix coturnix) {{is a popular}} game species for which {{restocking}} with farm-reared individuals is a common practice. In some areas, the number of released quails greatly surpasses the number of wild breeding common quail. However, common quail are difficult to raise in captivity and this casts suspicion about a possible hybrid origin of the farmed individuals from crosses with <b>domestic</b> Japanese <b>quail</b> (C. japonica). In this study we used a panel of autosomal microsatellite markers to characterize the genetic origin of quails reared for hunting purposes in game farms in Spain and of quails from an experimental game farm which was founded with hybrids that have been systematically backcrossed with wild common quails. The genotypes of these quail were compared to those of wild common <b>quail</b> and <b>domestic</b> strains of Japanese quail. Our results show that more than 85 % of the game farm birds were not common <b>quail</b> but had <b>domestic</b> Japanese <b>quail</b> ancestry. In the experimental farm {{a larger proportion of}} individuals could not be clearly separated from pure common quails.

40|$|International audienceSince the 1970 s, {{the decline}} of the occidental populations of European Quail Coturnix c. coturnix, a partial migrant Galliform species, has driven the release of {{domestic}} Japanese Quail Coturnix c. japonica into the wild as game birds. Recent experiments suggest that reproductive isolating mechanisms have not developed to prevent hybridization between European and Japanese Quail. To assess the potential impact of hybridization between the subspecies in the wild, this study aims to compare the migratory characteristics of captive European Quail, domestic Japanese Quail, F 1 hybrids and a backcross. In a laboratory experiment, birds hatched in summer and reared under a natural photoperiod were transferred during winter to an artificial photoperiod (light–dark) of 14 : 10 h. Behavioural (migratory restlessness, crowing activity in males) and physiological (sexual development, fat accumulation, body mass) measures were recorded. Domestic Japanese Quail showed no migratory tendency in response to the increased day length. F 1 hybrids showed rapid sexual development and few of them exhibited the typical profile of a migrant bird. Backcrosses showed great variation in their response, comparable with those of the European Quail. Therefore, hybridization could lead to an increased proportion of quail showing sedentary rather than migratory behaviour. Furthermore, hybrids that do show migratory behaviour have the potential to facilitate Japanese gene flow into areas where the release of <b>domestic</b> <b>Quail</b> as game birds is not yet practised...|$|E
40|$|The RT of <b>domestic</b> <b>quail</b> from Italian variety showed mainly an albuginic pattern being {{represented}} by tortuous channels lined predominately {{by a simple}} cubic epithelium. RT channels extended along the testicular albuginea and penetrates into the epididymal region (ER) through its myoconnective matrix. Passageways were continuous to proximal efferent ducts of the ER. Epithelium lining ultrastructure of RT passageways showed some differences between the spring and the inactive phase at middle fall, concerning the quail testicular reproductive cycle. The features observed in RT epitheliocytes in fall were the low cytoplasmic electrodensity, paucity of supranuclear vesicles, which were abundant and variable in form and shape in spring, and some degenerative aspects of cell organelles mainly in ER lamellae. Moreover, presence of apical cytoplasmic extrusions were verified in the fall. No marked features were seen in the RT ultrastructure during the winter and summer comparatively to the active phase of spring. A RT de codorna é predominantemente do tipo intra-albugínica e constituída por canais epiteliais tortuosos estendendo-se pela túnica albugínea do testículo e a seguir penetram na estrutura microscópica da região epididimária (RE), pelo seu tecido matricial. Os canais da RT são contínuos com os ductos eferentes proximais da RE. A ultraestrutura do epitélio de revestimento da RT mostra diferenças marcantes na primavera - a fase proliferativa do ciclo reprodutivo, e em meados do outono - a fase quiescente do ciclo reprodutivo nesta ave. As características ultraestruturais marcantes dos epiteliócitos da RT, nestas duas fases, foram a baixa eletrodensidade citoplasmática e ocorrência de poucas vesículas e lisossomos no outono, que aparecem com maior freqüência na RT primaveril.

40|$|Neste estudo diferenças expressivas foram observadas na estrutura dos ductos eferentes distais (DED) de codorna doméstica Coturnix coturnix, da variedade italiana, mantida em cativeiro {{experimental}} durante dois anos, durante as quatro estações do ano. A variabilidade morfológica dos DED foi mais marcante na primavera e no outono, eqüivalendo às fases ativa e quiescente do ciclo reprodutivo anual (ciclo testicular) nesta ave. Nessas fases do ciclo, diferenças significativas foram observadas na ultraestrutura das células principais (P) e ciliadas (C) do epitélio de revestimento tubular e nos calibres tubulares. Estes tiveram valores médios maiores na primavera, com valores similares no verão e no inverno, e valores médios menores observados no outono. Na primavera, no citoplasma apical de células P, notou-se maior complexidade organelar, inferindo-se a ocorrência de processos endocitóticos ativos. A quiescência outonal caracterizou-se por redução do calibre tubular dos DED, luz tubular vazia de espermatozóides, degenerações de organelas citoplasmáticas e "debridamentos" citoplasmáticos apicais em células P e C. No inverno e verão, correspondentes às fases recrudescente e regressiva, respectivamente, do ciclo testicular nesta espécie, os dados obtidos foram, de modo geral, similares aos observados na primavera. Some expressive {{differences were}} noted on the distal efferent ducts (DED) morphology in <b>domestic</b> <b>quail</b> of the Italian variety along the year. The birds were maintained on experimental captive breeding along two consecutive years, before the morphologic studies. Morphologic {{differences on the}} DED had been more evident in spring and autumn respectively, the active and quiescent phases of the annual testis cycle. Variability more expressive was noted among the principal (P) and ciliated (C) epithelial cells and in tubular diameters of DED, during the two focused seasons. Spring features of DED were marked by relative enlargement of the passageways, with similar results in summer and winter, and characteristic organelle development on the apical cytoplasm of P cells, allowing to conclude presence of active process of endocytosis. Autumn quiescence was marked by an enfolding pattern of all the tubular passageways, lacking of spermatozoa and small amount of heterogeneous material inside their luminal compartments, followed by presence of ultrastructural degenerative features in apical cytoplasm of P cells and C cells in DED passageways. Tubular features verified in DED during winter and summer were minor and similar to those described in spring.

40|$|Background: The common quail, Coturnix coturnix, is a {{migratory bird}} hunted {{extensively}} across Europe. To satisfy this hunting interest, thousands of farm-reared birds are restocked every year. However, restocked individuals are not common quail but hybrids with <b>domestic</b> Japanese <b>quail,</b> C. japonica. Interbreeding between restocked and native {{birds in the}} wild allows the entry of alien alleles to the native populations, {{which could lead to}} the loss of adaptive phenotypes and behaviours, such as migratory drive. Sedentary individuals may face wintering conditions to which they are not adapted, suffering higher mortality. Some individuals have been observed to remain in northern latitudes during winter. Question: Does game restocking contribute to the sedentarization of the common quail population? Method: We sampled 42 quail during the autumn migration and 50 quail during winter in Spain. We genetically analysed them using a set of autosomal microsatellites and also sequenced a fragment of the mitochondrial DNA control region. We evaluated the proportion of admixed quail found and compared it with that previously found in a breeding population. Results: None of the migratory quail were admixed individuals, although two of them showed introgression of Japanese mitochondrial DNA. Among wintering quail, only three individuals had a genetic composition compatible with a farm origin, while the rest were common quail. Thus, the proportion of admixed quail during winter was not higher than during the breeding season. Conclusion: Restocking individuals with <b>domestic</b> Japanese <b>quail</b> ancestry is not directly associated with the presence of quail during winter in northern latitudes. The almost complete absence of individuals of farm origin among the migratory and wintering quail populations indicates {{that the vast majority of}} the restocked individuals probably die soon after release. However, the genetic composition of the breeding population has already shown that some survive until the next breeding season and introgress their genes into the wild population...|$|R

After opening the abdominal cavity and eviscerating the gastrointestinal tract, the ovaries and oviducts were dissected and weighed. Using a packymeter, the different parts of the oviducts were measured: infundibulum, magnum, isthmus, uterus and vagina. The number of folds present in the magnum and the isthmus were evaluated. Histologic sections of the magnum, isthmus and uterus were used to measure the thickness of their epithelial and glandular layers.

40|$|Species-specific {{behaviours}} gradually emerge, via incomplete patterns, to {{the final}} complete adult form. A classical example is birdsong, a learned behaviour ideally suited for studying the neural and molecular substrates of vocal learning.

The testicular capsule, other than the tunica serosa and tunica vasculosa, comprised, in the main, smooth muscle-like or myoid cells running mainly in one direction, and disposed in one main mass. Peritubular tissue was similarly composed of smooth muscle-like cells disposed in several layers. Actin and desmin intermediate filaments were immunolocalized in the inner cellular layers of the capsule in the <b>quail,</b> <b>domestic</b> fowl and duck, but uniformly in the turkey.

Actin, desmin and vimentin were generally co-expressed in the rete testis, efferent ducts and epididymal duct unit of the <b>quail,</b> <b>domestic</b> fowl and turkey, with vimentin being more strongly immunoreactive than actin and desmin in the epididymal duct unit, but more weakly immunoexpressed in the efferent ducts. Cytokeratin was present and co-expressed with actin, desmin and vimentin in the rete testis, efferent ducts and epididymal duct unit of the domestic fowl and turkey, but not in the quail and duck. The periductal smooth muscle cell layer and interductal tissue co-expressed actin, desmin and vimentin variably in all birds. Luminal spermatozoa of both the turkey and duck were immunonegative for all protein systems, whereas those of the <b>quail</b> and <b>domestic</b> fowl co-expressed actin, desmin and vimentin moderately or strongly. The tissues of the reproductive tract of male birds thus contain cytoskeletal protein systems that are variably but mostly co-expressed and whose contractile ability appears necessary and sufficient for transportation through the various excurent ducts of the voluminous testicular fluid and its high sperm content, characteristic features of male avian reproduction.

40|$|Tris(1, 3 -dichloro- 2 -propyl) {{phosphate}} (TDICPP) and Dechlorane Plus (DP) are (re) emerging {{flame retardants}} widely {{detected in the}} environment and biota. These compounds have shown a potential to bioaccumulate in organisms, and DP has shown to biomagnify through the food chain. Maternal transfer of both the contaminants in birds has been demonstrated through reported levels in eggs. Information about their potential toxicity in wildlife, especially in avian species, is very limited. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate possible effects and interaction effects of both flame retardants on development and growth in avian species, using the <b>domestic</b> Japanese <b>quail</b> (Coturnix japonica) as a model organism. Eggs of Japanese quail were injected with low, medium and high doses (10, 100 and 1000 ng/g egg, respectively) of either TDICPP, DP, or a 1 : 1 mixture of both. Biometrical measurements of body weight, head length, and tarsus length were taken regularly from newly hatched chicks for a total of 14 days. Neither the compounds nor the mixture had an effect on hatching success, size of the newly hatched chicks, overall growth rate, or body condition (at 12 days old). These results suggest that in ovo exposure to TDCIPP and DP resulted in no observable effects on development or growth in two weeks old Japanese quails. Because TDICPP and DP are ubiquitous in the environment and biota, and are frequently and increasingly used in industry, potential toxicological effects of these flame retardants need to be further investigated...|$|R
40|$|Ornithobacterium rhinotracheale (ORT) is a {{respiratory}} pathogen {{which has}} been isolated throughout the world from numerous bird species. The present {{study was designed to}} isolate and characterize the ORT from <b>domestic</b> turkeys, <b>quails</b> and pigeons. For this purpose, 250 samples from each bird species (turkey, quail and pigeon) with or without respiratory signs were tested by taking of tracheal swabs. In addition, respiratory tissue samples (tracheal and lung), from 250 slaughtered turkeys, 50 slaughtered quails and 100 dead pigeons were also subjected to culture for ORT as tracheal swabs. Respiratory tissues were also tested for bacterial DNA by using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In general, 30 isolates including 4 isolates from turkeys, 3 isolates from quails and 23 isolates from pigeons were identified as ORT by bacteriologicalmethod and then confirmed by PCR. Bacterial DNA was detected in 20 %, 50 % and 35 % of respiratory tissues in turkeys, quails and pigeons respectively. Five ORT isolates from pigeon and all four isolates from turkey showed smaller colony size, while other isolates had larger colonies when cultured in blood agar. Fifty percent of the isolates with larger colony but none of the isolates with small colony size could agglutinate red blood cells (RBCs). All of the isolates were sensitive to danofloxacin and chloramphenicolwhile more than 90 % of pigeon isolates were resistant to ampicillin. All of turkey and quail and 30 % of pigeon isolates were resistant to tetracycline. Our ORT isolates showed high identity (98 %- 100 %) insequence of 16 S rRNA gene to related data in GeneBank...|$|R

Ninety five adult birds, comprising of 42 males and 53 female Japanese quails were sampled using a simple random sampling technique. Standard procedures were carried out in all haematology and serum biochemistry determinations. The overall mean for the erythrocytic and serum biochemistry parameters were as follows: packed cell volume (PCV) 43. 11 %, {{red blood cell count}} (RBC) 4. 31 × 106 /µl, haemoglobin concentration (Hbc) 16. 21 g/dl, mean corpuscular volume (MCV) 100. 69 fl, mean corpuscular haemoglobin (MCH) 39. 17 pg, mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration (MCHC) 39. 35 g/dl, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 59. 99 IU/L, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 20. 85 IU/L, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) 107. 54 IU/L, total proteins (TP) 5. 19 g/dl, albumin (ALB) 3. 25 g/dl, globulin (GLB) 1. 94 g/dl, albumin: globulin 1. 73, total cholesterol (TCHOL) 146. 69 mg/dl, total bilirubin (TBIL) 2. 37 mg/dl, uric acid (UA) 16. 02 mg/dl and creatinine (CREAT) 0. 44 mg/dl. The PCV of the males were significantly higher than that of the females, while the MCH and MCHC of the females were significantly higher than those of the males. The serum total proteins, albumin, globulin, uric acid, creatinine, and total cholesterol values of the female quails were higher than those of the male quails. The present data might be useful to avian specialists and veterinary clinicians, but more research works should be carried out on quails to increase the information data base, especially in the tropics...|$|R
40|$|Restocking with {{non-native}} {{species for}} hunting purposes {{is a widespread}} practice in some Galliformes species that may result in the introgression of maladaptive alleles into native populations. Quails farmed for restocking are produced by interbreeding <b>domestic</b> Japanese <b>quails</b> (Coturnix japonica) with European quails (Coturnix coturnix). Massive releases of these animals could represent a threat to native European quails. In this study we radio-track 16 female native European quails and 51 female farm-reared quails over four breeding seasons in a single locality. Our results show that farmed female quails attracted more wild common quail males than European quail females, probably because they produce more rally calls. Here {{for the first time}} we show empirical evidence that European quails and restocked farmed quails interbreed in the wild. Further, hybrid farmed females and European females had similar probabilities of mating, nesting success, clutch size, fertility, hatching probability and chicks’ survival probability. However, female farmed quail had higher mortality than European quail females, and their nests had a higher rate of predation. These last observations could explain why the two lineages do not appear completely admixed after more than 20 years of massive restocking practices. However, our results clearly show a lack of reproductive barriers in the wild and that introgression may not be completely prevented. An immediate ban of the release of non-native quails is necessary to preserve their genetic integrity. Thus, banning restocking with Japanese quail or hybrids is necessary to prevent the progressive introduction of maladaptive alleles into the European quail populations. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|WOS: 000225168300004 International audienceThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} whether mothers' fear of human could influence the way young <b>domestic</b> Japanese <b>quail</b> respond to human. The first step was to obtain a set of adoptive mothers habituated-to-human (H mothers) and a set of adoptive mothers non-habituated-to-human (NH mothers). A set of 6 -month-old adult females was handling daily for 15 successive days whereas another set of 6 -month-old adult females received no visual or physical contact with human during the same period. We then obtained two sets of adoptive mothers non-divergent in tonic immobility (TI) duration but divergent by the amount of "fear" behaviour expressed towards human (human observer test, cage-plus-experimenter test). Then, we compared a set of young raised by H mothers to a set of young raised by NH mothers. Observations and tests were carried out both during the brooding period (between 5 and 12 days of age) and after separation from mothers (between 13 and 90 days of age). Our results revealed that young raised by H mothers were less fearful towards a static human (cage-plus-experimenter test, hand-on-home-cage-door-test) as well as towards a moving human (human observer test and capture test) than young raised by NH mothers. Nevertheless, as was found between the two sets of adoptive mothers, no clear differences were found between the two sets of young concerning general emotional reactivity (tonic immobility test, open field test and hole-in-the-wall test). These results reveal that young bird's emotional reactivity to human could be modulated by the mother and that this maternal influence remains detectable well after the end of maternal contact.

40|$|WOS: 000256725700013 International audienceThe {{inability}} of animals {{to cope with}} their social environment in husbandry systems could be {{a major source of}} problems for both animal welfare management and economy. In this context, previous studies selected lines of <b>domestic</b> Japanese <b>quail</b> diverging for their level of social reinstatement, hypothesizing that quail with high levels of social motivation would adapt better to crowded social situations than quail with low levels of social motivation. However, these selections were based only on social motivation evaluated in young birds. As behavioural traits can vary with age, this study analysed the persistence of selected social traits into adulthood. With this in mind, we used several behavioural tests to estimate social motivation of adult females from selected lines for high social reinstatement (HSR, n = 24) and for low social reinstatement (LSR, n = 24). The tests were: open-field tests, emergence tests, separation tests, runway tests and confrontation tests. As birds' behaviour in these tests can be influenced by the emotive characteristics of the subjects, we measured the emotional reactivity of quail not only during these tests but also in specific emotive tests: tonic immobility tests. Our results showed that the social motivation characteristics of birds persist in adulthood. Adult HSR females still presented a higher social motivation than adult LRS females: their response to social isolation was stronger and their motivation to reach conspecifics and to stay close to them was higher. However, the behavioural expression of social motivation appeared to be modified during development. Whereas vocal behaviour reflected the social motivation of chicks, in isolated contexts, this characteristic was not observed in adult quail...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Chromosome {{architecture}} and assorted nuclear compartments play {{an essential role}} in RNA transcription and processing. Growing vertebrate oocytes represent an advantageous model to study the principles of nuclear structure and function. In this article, the data on three-dimensional (3 D) organisation of intact and non-deformed oocyte nuclei (germinal vesicles) in four species of birds (<b>domestic</b> chicken, Japanese <b>quail,</b> rock pigeon and chaffinch) obtained by confocal laser scan-ning microscopy are presented. The nucleus of the grow-ing avian oocyte has an unusual structure of RNA processing machinery. Germinal vesicles from any of the avian species studied, {{with the exception of the}} rock pigeon, are characterized by absence of extrachromo-somal RNA-enriched nuclear bodies including Cajal bodies, histone locus bodies and interchromatin granule clusters. The absence of Cajal bodies and histone locus bodies in chicken oocytes correlated with the inacti-vation of nucleolus organizer and clustered histone genes. Splicing factors such as SR-protein SC 35 accumulated in chromosome-associated domains that were classified as complex loops (terminal giant and lumpy loops). Formation of such depot in avian oocyte nuclei is supposed to be nucleated by tran-scripts of non-coding tandem repeats. The results obtained strongly support a model of RNA-mediated nuclear domains formation...|$|R
40|$|Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) -containing neurones {{have been}} implicated in the {{transmission}} of visceral sensory information to the cortex and in the control of arterial blood pressure in mammals. However, {{little is known about}} its function in other vertebrates. As a first step toward investigating the function of CGRP in birds, its distribution was studied in the <b>domestic</b> chick and <b>quail</b> brain by means of immunocytochemistry, by using antibodies against rat CGRP. The distribution of CGRP immunoreactivity in the chick and quail central nervous system was found to be similar. CGRP-immunoreactive (CGRPi) perikarya were not present in the telencephalon. In the diencephalon, CGRPi perikarya were present mainly in the shell of the thalamic nucleus ovoidalis, the nucleus semilunaris paraovoidalis, the nucleus dorsolateralis posterior thalami, and in the hypothalamic nucleus of the ansa lenticularis. In the brainstem, CGRPi perikarya were present in the nucleus mesencephalicus nervi trigemini, the nucleus tegmenti ventralis, the locus coeruleus, the nucleus linearis caudalis and in the parabrachial region. In addition CGRPi perikarya were found in the motor nuclei of the III, IV, V, VI, VII, IX, X, and XII cranial nerves. The telencephalon contained CGRPi fibres within the paleostriatal complex (mainly in the ventral paleostriatum), parts of the neostriatum and ventral hyperstriatum, parts of the archistriatum, and the septum. In the diencephalon, the densest plexus of CGRPi fibres was observed in the dorsal reticular thalamus. A less dense CGRPi innervation was present in some dorsal thalamic nuclei and in the medial and periventricular hypothalamus. The pretectum and midbrain tegmentum also contained CGRPi fibres, whereas the optic tectum was virtually devoid of immunolabelling. Scattered CGRPi fibres were observed in the central grey and neighbouring pontine areas. Some of the sensory fibres of the trigeminal, vagal, glossopharyngeal, and spinal nerves were also CGRPi. The results of comparative studies indicate that the presence of CGRP in some thalamo-telencephalic projections is a primitive feature of the forebrain of amniotes. Therefore, the brain areas giving rise to and receiving such a projection in different vertebrates, are likely to be homologous...|$|R
50|$|Northern {{goshawks}} {{can show}} {{somewhat of a}} trend for females to be taken more so than males while hunting adult gamebirds, due to the larger size and more developed defenses of males (such as leg spurs present for defense and innerspecies conflicts in male of most pheasant species). Some authors have claimed this of male ring-necked pheasant (Phasianus cochilus), but these trends are not reported everywhere, as in southern Sweden equal numbers of adult male and female ring-necked pheasants, both sexes averaging 1135 g, were taken. While male goshawks can take black and hazel grouse of any age and thence deliver them to nests, they can only take capercaillie of up to adult hen size, averaging some 1800 g, the cock capercaillie at {{more than twice as}} heavy as the hen is too large for a male goshawk to overtake. However, adult female goshawks have been reported attacking and killing cock capercaillie, mainly during winter. These average about 4000 g in body mass and occasionally may weigh even more when dispatched. Similarly impressive feats of attacks on other particularly large gamebirds have been reported elsewhere in the range, including the 2770 g Altai snowcock (Tetraogallus altaicus) in Mongolia and, in at least one case, successful predation on an estimated 3900 g adult-sized young wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo) hen in North America (by an immature female goshawk weighing approximately 1050 g), although taking adults of much larger-bodied prey like this is considered generally rare, the young chicks and poults of such prey species are likely much more often taken. At {{the other end of the}} size scale, the smallest gamebird known to be hunted by northern goshawk was the 96 g common <b>quail.</b> <b>Domestic</b> fowl, particularly chickens (Gallus gallus domesticus) are taken occasionally, especially where wild prey populations are depleted. While other raptors are at times blamed for large numbers of attacks on fowl, goshawks are reportedly rather more likely to attack chickens during the day than other raptors and are probably the most habitual avian predator of domestic fowl, at least in the temperate-zone. Particularly large numbers of chickens have been reported in Wigry National Park, Poland (4th most regular prey species and contributing 15.3% of prey weight), Belarus and the Ukraine, being the third most regularly reported prey in the latter two.|$|R
