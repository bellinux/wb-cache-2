5|$|Geri {{came in and}} sang: 'Too much of something/Da-da-da-da-da...Right. OK. You got that?' We {{started working}} on <b>it</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> wanted to do some sort of doo-wop vocal thing. So we {{constructed}} this backing track and then more of the girls started to come in—this was quite a good day—and gradually they started to add on their little bits.|$|E
5|$|When we came {{to record}} it in the studio we {{struggled}} because there was something just not quite right about it and I wasn't happy about where we'd left it and where we were happy to leave <b>it</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> couldn't put our finger on what it was {{and so it was}} a really nice day one day, me and Chris were just trying, I was actually just trying to record bass at the time and me and Chris were just sitting down trying to brainstorm it and work out what was wrong and so I started trying to just do a few different bass lines and stuff. Between the two of us we came up with just this kind of groove, which stays on the same note as opposed to change, it's quite technical but it kind of added a bit of bounce to the song and it made it roll along in a much more fluid way. It was a bit mechanical before and it's just interesting how something small like that can really change the whole vibe of a song. It was just nice because from there on it was one of our favourite tracks and it almost didn't get on the record but it's now one of our favourite tracks.|$|E
25|$|Of course, we have {{returned}} to realism, to a deeper, more refined and more psychological realism. Let us get a little stronger in <b>it</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> shall once more continue on our quest. That {{is why we have}} invited Gordon Craig. After wandering about in search of new ways, we shall again return to realism for more strength. I do not doubt that every abstraction on the stage, such as impressionism, for instance, could be attained by way of a more refined and deeper realism. All other ways are false and dead.|$|E

500|$|FA General Secretary Alex Horne hinted {{afterwards}} {{that the}} Community Shield could be played overseas, though not any time before 2018 {{because of the}} existing contract with Wembley Stadium. He described it as an interesting idea and told reporters: [...] "The NBA are doing <b>it</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> know that Spanish football and Italian football are looking at doing that with their own Supercup-type games." ...|$|E
500|$|During a September 2009 {{earnings}} call, Take-Two Interactive CEO Strauss Zelnick {{was asked}} about Grand Theft Auto V, the purported next game in the series. He replied, [...] "We're not going to announce it, we're not going to announce when {{we are going to}} announce <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> are not going to announce a strategy about announcing it or about when we are going to announce it either, or about the announcement strategy surrounding the announcement of the strategy".|$|E

500|$|Film author Patrick Webster {{considers}} Kubrick's {{methods of}} writing and developing scenes to fit with the classical auteur theory of directing, allowing collaboration and improvisation with the actors during filming. Malcolm McDowell recalled Kubrick's collaborative emphasis during their discussions and his willingness {{to allow him to}} improvise a scene, stating that [...] "there was a script and we followed it, but when it didn't work he knew <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> had to keep rehearsing endlessly until we were bored with it".|$|E
500|$|Inspiration for [...] "The Bill" [...] {{came when}} Shearsmith and Pemberton, {{the creators of}} Inside No. 9, saw a group arguing over a bill at a restaurant. Pemberton said that, unexpectedly, [...] "they were arguing about wanting to pay <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> just came out and thought, 'Could that be one episode?' ... And then it's about {{sustaining}} that one idea". For him, [...] "when you're in the writing phase, you can see anything in day-to-day life that could spark your imagination"; after seeing this dispute, the writers immediately returned to their office to begin writing.|$|E

We see <b>it</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> condemn it." [...] While in Moscow on July 7, he responded Vice President Biden's comment on a possible Israeli military strike on Iran by saying: [...] "We have said directly to the Israelis {{that it is important}} to try and resolve this in an international setting in a way that does not create major conflict in the Middle East." ...|$|E

The mantras, the images of Krishna have in this culture no foul association.... hen {{somebody}} comes in from the Orient with a new religion which hasn't got any of these [...] associations in our minds, all the words are new, all the rites are new, and yet, somehow it has feeling in <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> can get with that, you see, and we can dig that! Ginsberg agreed {{to take part in}} the Mantra-Rock Dance concert and to introduce the swami to the Haight-Ashbury hippie community.|$|E
500|$|Joe Rohde, the Imagineer {{in charge}} of {{building}} the attraction and Animal Kingdom, {{was asked about the}} yeti at the 2013 D23 Expo. Rohde responded [...] "You have to understand, it's a giant complicated machine sitting on top of, like, a 46-foot tall tower {{in the middle of a}} finished building. So, it's really hard to fix, but we are working on <b>it.</b> <b>And</b> <b>we</b> continue to work on it. We have tried several 'things', none of them quite get to the key, turning of the 40-foot tower inside of a finished building, but we are working on it... I will fix the Yeti someday, I swear." ...|$|E
500|$|Earthsuit {{began in}} 1995 as a {{collaboration}} between Adam LaClave and Paul Meany, who began composing music together after being introduced at a church in New Orleans. In an interview with Family Christian Stores, Meany explained that a sermon was {{the inspiration for the}} band's name: [...] "...This man was preaching about how humans are really spirit beings encased in fleshly bodies. The term [...] "earth suit" [...] came up. At the time we liked <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> took it." [...] The two regularly performed at Café Joel, a small coffeehouse their church had started where Meany was music director. These performances helped cultivate their unique sound and introduced them to future band member David Rumsey.|$|E

500|$|We {{had just}} done with [...] "Since U Been Gone," [...] which {{everyone}} was happy with. We sent a rough version of [...] "Behind These Hazel Eyes," [...] without any lyrics, to Kelly and Clive Davis. It {{was in part}} an olive branch to Kelly, because there was miscommunication on [...] "Since U Been Gone," [...] where Kelly had written some lyrics and Max and I didn't know about <b>it</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> had finished the song. So we wanted to write [...] "Behind" [...] with her from the beginning, but we were in different places. She had just won [...] "American Idol" [...] and was on tour, so she'd e-mail me lyrics, and I'd e-mail her my thoughts.|$|E
500|$|The Experience began {{recording}} [...] "Purple Haze" [...] on January 11, 1967, at De Lane Lea Studios in London. According to drummer Mitch Mitchell, he and bassist Noel Redding {{learned the}} song in the studio: [...] "Hendrix came in and kind of hummed us the riff and showed Noel the chords and the changes. I listened to <b>it</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> went, 'OK, let's do it.' We got it on the third take as I recall." [...] The basic track was recorded in four hours, according to Chandler. [...] Multitrack recording technology allowed engineers to record and complete additional parts on the final master. [...] After the basic track was finished, Chandler explained that he and Hendrix developed the song: ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with the Science Journal G. Wayne Clough, the 12th secretary of the Smithsonian Institution assuaged [...] the animosities between critics and proponents of the exhibition: [...] “So I don't think there's anything negative here. I think the Smithsonian tried to do it right. When we heard the concerns, we asked the community to come together and talk about <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> listened, and some people in that audience had their minds changed, as a matter of fact, but not everybody. So, I think it's time {{in a situation like this}} to pause, and for the profession itself to say, [...] "Okay, there's a problem, what are you going to do about it? And, you remember, the United States never signed the UNESCO treaty.” ...|$|E

500|$|Dudley {{negotiated}} a separate {{peace with the}} Abenakis at Portsmouth, New Hampshire in 1713. [...] He hoped to separate the western Kennebec tribe from French influence and consequently adopted a fairly hard line, threatening to withhold trade that was vital to their survival and reiterating claims of British sovereignty over the Abenaki. [...] The Treaty of Portsmouth resulted from those negotiations and repeats the claims of sovereignty. Dudley claimed that the French had ceded Abenaki lands as part of Acadia, and one sachem responded: [...] "The French never said anything to us about <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> wonder how they would give it away without asking us". [...] Nevertheless, Dudley and succeeding governors treated the Abenaki as British subjects, and friction persisted over British colonial expansion into Maine which flared into Dummer's War in the 1720s.|$|E
500|$|In June 2008, EMI {{released}} a greatest hits album, [...] It was made without Radiohead's input and only contains songs released under their recording contract with EMI. Yorke {{was critical of}} the release, saying: [...] "There's {{nothing we can do}} about it. The work is really public property now anyway, in my head at least. It's a wasted opportunity in that if we'd been behind <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> wanted to do it, then it might have been good." [...] In August 2008, EMI reissued [...] "special editions" [...] of Radiohead's back catalogue as part of its [...] "From the Capitol Vaults" [...] series. From mid-2008 to early 2009, Radiohead toured North America, Europe, Japan and South America to promote In Rainbows, and headlined the Reading and Leeds Festivals in August 2009.|$|E
500|$|Dylan's {{performances}} in China in April 2011 generated controversy. Some criticised {{him for not}} making any explicit comment on the political situation in China, and for, allegedly, allowing the Chinese authorities to censor his set list. Others defended Dylan's performances, arguing that such criticism represented a misunderstanding of Dylan's art, and that no evidence for the censorship of Dylan's set list existed. In response to these allegations, Dylan posted a statement on his website: [...] "As far as censorship goes, the Chinese government had asked for {{the names of the}} songs that I would be playing. There's no logical answer to that, so we sent them the set lists from the previous 3 months. If there were any songs, verses or lines censored, nobody ever told me about <b>it</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> played all the songs that we intended to play." ...|$|E
