5|$|During {{the late}} 11th century, the Norman lord, Robert Fitzhamon entered Morgannwg {{in an attempt}} to <b>gain</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> area, {{building}} many earth and timber castles in the lowlands. In the early 12th century the Norman expansion continued with castles being founded around Neath, Kenfig and Coity, while within the same period Bishop Urban established the Diocese of Llandaff under which Glynrhondda belonged to the large parish of Llantrisant.|$|E

5|$|Hays {{made the}} {{construction}} of the mainline his priority, failing to develop feeder lines. CNoR and CPR joined forces to <b>gain</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> prairie traffic. The competition among the three railroads led to Canada's ending up with three transcontinental railways instead of one. This was to result in the GTP's being starved of traffic; even though it was arguably the best of the three, it ultimately failed to attract enough freight to make it profitable.|$|E
5|$|On the {{opposite}} bank of the Mississippi, a second simultaneous attack on the nearby former British colonial outpost of Cahokia, occupied by Patriot Virginians, was also repulsed. The retreating Indians destroyed the crops and took captive civilians outside the protected area. The British failed to defend {{their side of the}} river and, thus, effectively ended any attempts to <b>gain</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Mississippi River during the war.|$|E

5|$|The Battle of Svolder (Svold or Swold) was a naval battle {{fought in}} September 999 or 1000 {{in the western}} Baltic Sea between King Olaf Tryggvason of Norway and an {{alliance}} of his enemies. The backdrop of the battle was the unification of Norway into a single state, long-standing Danish efforts to <b>gain</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> country, {{and the spread of}} Christianity in Scandinavia.|$|E
5|$|The final {{steps in}} the shift to empire may have been {{triggered}} by Athens' defeat in Egypt, which challenged the city's dominance in the Aegean {{and led to the}} revolt of several allies, such as Miletus and Erythrae. Either because of a genuine fear for its safety after the defeat in Egypt and the revolts of the allies, or as a pretext to <b>gain</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> League's finances, Athens transferred the treasury of the alliance from Delos to Athens in 454–453BC.|$|E

5|$|After a few days, {{the main}} {{thrust of the}} {{offensive}} was halted south of Rimini by strong resistance and severe weather, and the British and Indian flanking forces began to push westwards, taking the frontline towards San Marino. On 17 September the 4th Indian Infantry Division attacked forces of the 278. Infanterie-Division holding two hills just across the Sammarinese border; after heavy fighting to <b>gain</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hills, the situation stabilised on the 19th, and Allied forces began to push into the city of San Marino itself. The city was captured by the afternoon of 20 September, and the 4th Indian Division left the country on the 21st, leaving it {{under the control of the}} local defence forces.|$|E
5|$|An enemy scout {{discovered}} Nulli Secunda quietly {{attempting to}} regain control with their Territorial Control Units (TCU). At around 14:00 UTC, with an hour remaining before Nulli Secunda could regain control, the CFC and Russian coalition sent a capital fleet to the station. RAZOR Alliance took the station, and the Russians destroyed the N3/PL Territorial Control Unit and set up its own TCU {{in order to establish}} control. Capturing the B-R5RB system would enable the CFC and Russian coalition to trap Pandemic Legion assets, including hundreds of capital and sub-capital ships, thus preventing those ships from joining the war. CFC and Russian coalition forces scrambled to <b>gain</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> system, with thousands of players logging on and preparing their fleets.|$|E
5|$|Barkley, {{recently}} {{chosen as}} Senate Majority Leader {{by a single}} vote, was {{a strong supporter of}} President Roosevelt and the New Deal. Chandler identified with the more conservative southern Democrats who, wary of Roosevelt and his New Deal, sought to <b>gain</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> party ahead of the 1940 presidential election. Because Roosevelt was very popular in Kentucky, Chandler was put in the awkward position of expressing personal support of the president while opposing his hand-picked leader in the Senate and his New Deal legislation. In April, polls showed Barkley ahead of Chandler by a 2-to-1 margin, and the May 3 primary victory of New Deal Florida Senator Claude Pepper finally persuaded Chandler to abandon his attacks of the program.|$|E

5|$|British General John Burgoyne moved {{south from}} the {{province}} of Quebec in June 1777 to <b>gain</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> upper Hudson River valley. His campaign had become bogged down in difficulties following a victory at Fort Ticonderoga. Elements of the army had reached the upper Hudson {{as early as the}} end of July, but logistical and supply difficulties delayed the main army at Fort Edward. One attempt to alleviate these difficulties failed when nearly 1,000 men were killed or captured at the August 16 Battle of Bennington. Furthermore, news reached Burgoyne on August 28 that St. Leger's expedition down the Mohawk River valley had turned back after the failed Siege of Fort Stanwix.|$|E
5|$|Sea Mither, or Mither of the Sea, is {{a mythical}} being of Orcadian {{folklore}} {{that lives in}} the sea during summer, when she confines the demonic nuckelavee to the ocean depths. Each spring she battles with her arch-enemy Teran, another spirit of Orcadian legend capable of causing severe winter storms, to <b>gain</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> seas and the weather. Eventually Sea Mither overcomes Teran and sends him to {{the depths of the}} ocean, but the effort of keeping him confined there along with her other benevolent labours during the summer exhaust her, until in the autumn Teran takes advantage of her weakness to wrest control from her once again.|$|E
5|$|The fleet {{arrived at}} Abaco Island on March 1, 1776. The force {{captured}} two sloops owned by Loyalists, {{one of whom}} was Captain Gideon Lowe of Green Turtle Cay, and pressed their owners to serve as pilots. George Dorsett, a local ship's captain, got away from Abaco and alerted Browne to the presence of the rebel fleet. The landing force was transferred to the two captured sloops and Providence the next day, and plans were formulated for the assault. While the main fleet held back, the three ships carrying the landing force were to enter the port at daybreak on March 3, and <b>gain</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> town before the alarm could be raised.|$|E

5|$|The {{permissive}} attitude toward business {{did not always}} extend toward large corporations. A lack of venture capital in the state became a significant problem with the early industry. Civic and business leaders, and even ordinary citizens, worried that the influx of capital from outside the state {{would lead to a}} loss of political power, revenue, and business opportunities. This sentiment led to a series of antitrust lawsuits by the state Attorney General starting in 1906. The lawsuits easily succeeded and limited the ability of outside investors, most notably Standard Oil, to <b>gain</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> state oil companies.|$|E
5|$|To help {{combat the}} {{negative}} press, Aberhart resolved to <b>gain</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Albertan, the one paper of note {{to show him}} any support. He formed a company that acquired an option to purchase it, and used his radio program to promote the purchase of shares by Social Credit supporters. The other newspapers criticized him for using what was nominally a gospel program to promote stock sales. The plan came to naught, as most Social Credit supporters were too poor to buy newspaper stock, and the only interested buyers were beneficiaries of government patronage, chiefly liquor interests. Even so, the Albertan became the official organ of Social Credit, an editorial decision that doubled its circulation.|$|E
5|$|While the {{infantry}} battle was being fought {{on the west}} side of Beersheba, Edward Chaytor (commanding the Anzac Mounted Division) ordered the 2nd Light Horse Brigade to attack Tel el Sakaty at 08:00 and <b>gain</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Jerusalem road. At the same time, he ordered the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade (with the 1st Light Horse Brigade in support) to attack the Ottoman garrison holding fortifications on Tel el Saba. These hard-fought attacks continued into the afternoon, when two regiments of the 3rd Light Horse Brigade (Australian Mounted Division) were ordered to reinforce the Anzac Mounted Division's attack on Tel el Saba.|$|E
