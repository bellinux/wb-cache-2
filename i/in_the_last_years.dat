40|$|Few {{studies have}} focused on the care setting {{transitions}} that occur <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>year</b> of life. People living in rural areas may have more difficult care setting transitions and also more moves <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>year</b> of life as health changes occur. A mixed-methods study was conducted to gain an understanding of the number and implications or impact of care setting transitions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>year</b> of life for rural Canadians. Rural Albertans had significantly more healthcare setting transitions than urbanites <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>year</b> of life (M= 4. 2 vs 3. 3). Online family respondents reported 8 moves on average occurred <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>year</b> of life. These moves were most often identified (65 %) on a likert-type scale as “very difficult,” with the free text information revealing these trips were often emotionally painful for themselves and physically painful for the decedent. Eleven informants were then interviewed until data saturation, with constant-comparative data analysis conducted. Moving from place to place for needed care <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>year</b> of life was identified as common and concerning for rural people and their families, with three data themes developing: (a) needed care <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>year</b> of life is scattered across many places, (b) traveling is very difficult for terminally-ill persons and their caregivers, and (c) local rural services are minimal. These findings indicate planning is needed to avoid unnecessary end-of-life care setting transitions and to make needed moves for essential services <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>year</b> of life less costly, stressful, and socially disruptive for rural people and their families. </p...|$|R

5|$|Details of the railroad's {{rolling stock}} are obscure. In 1891, it owned five {{passenger}} and three freight cars.

5|$|The {{demobilisation}} of the Australian military after World War II involved discharging almost 600,000 men {{and women}} from the military, supporting their transition to civilian life and reducing the three armed services to peacetime strengths. Planning for the demobilisation process began in 1942 and thousands of service{{men and women}} were discharged <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>years</b> of the war in response to shortages of labour in the domestic war economy. The general demobilisation of the military began in October 1945 and was completed in February 1947.

5|$|According to the {{contemporaneous}} Philippe de Commines, Matthias's subjects feared their King <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>years</b> of {{his life}} because he rarely showed mercy towards those he suspected of treachery. He had Archbishop Peter Váradi imprisoned in 1484 and ordered the execution of his Chancellor of Bohemia Jaroslav Boskovic in 1485. He also imprisoned Nicholas Bánfi, {{a member of a}} magnate family, in 1487, although he had earlier avoided punishing the old aristocracy. Bánfi's imprisonment seems to have been connected to his marriage to a daughter of John the Mad, Duke of Glogau because Matthias tried to seize this duchy for John Corvinus. John the Mad entered into an alliance with the Duke of Münsterberg Henry of Poděbrady, and declared a war on Matthias on 9 May. Six month later, the Black Army invaded and occupied his duchy.|$|E
5|$|After three years, on 15 November 1761, Schmitt {{received}} a commission a Fähnrich (ensign) in Infanterie-Regiment Nr. 15 Pallavicini.

The lack of accurate maps had hampered {{the conduct of}} the Seven Years' War and, in 1764, Schmitt was assigned to a project to improve the map-making capacity of the military. The idea of the scientific soldier, or a soldier educated in the specifics of military operations, led to an investment in the training and education of officers. The development of map making, and Carlos Pallavicini was at the forefront of this movement. On 1 February 1769, after proving himself capable in this assignment, he was promoted to Oberleutnant (Lieutenant) and transferred to the reorganized General-Quartermaster staff.|$|E
