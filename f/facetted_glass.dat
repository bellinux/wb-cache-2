5000|$|The Hall of Science was {{designed}} in 1962 by Wallace Harrison for the 1964 New York World's Fair in Flushing Meadows, New York. Harrison modeled the 80 ft building after the Kaiser Wilhelm Tower in Berlin, Germany - a 100 ft <b>faceted</b> <b>glass</b> tower composed of deep blue <b>faceted</b> <b>glass.</b> Harrison's cornerless serpentine shaped Hall of Science {{is made up}} of 5,400 coffers, each 2 ft wide and 3 ft tall. The Willet Studio, under Henry Lee Willet's guidance, was commissioned to construct the 5,400 panels that form the walls in less than one years time. Each panel is composed of thick chunks of blue <b>faceted</b> <b>glass</b> held together by cement. Twenty to 30 different shades of blue glass, imported from France and the Blenko Glass Company of Milton, West Virginia, were used in the project. The blue light, which engulfs the interior, symbolizes the heavens and carries out the theme, [...] "Rendezvous in Space." ...|$|R

5000|$|... "Fire-polished" [...] faceted beads are a less {{expensive}} alternative to hand-cut <b>faceted</b> <b>glass</b> or crystal. They derive their name from {{the second half of}} a two-part process: first, the glass batch is poured into round bead molds, then they are faceted with a grinding wheel. The faceted beads are then poured onto a tray and briefly reheated just long enough to melt the surface, [...] "polishing" [...] out any minor surface irregularities from the grinding wheel.|$|R
50|$|In the United States Duval first {{worked in}} Florida, before {{accepting}} {{a position at}} Daprato Studio in New York. In 1955 he was drafted and served {{two years in the}} US army in Germany. Upon his return he continued to freelance at Daprato until 1957 when he opened his own studio in Manhattan. Assisted by his studio foreman, Helmut Schardt, in 1958 Duval began working in <b>faceted</b> <b>glass.</b> During this period he attended the Art Students League of New York.|$|R
50|$|Most new {{government}} buildings attempt to express solidity and seriousness; an {{exception is the}} Port Authority (Havenhuis) in Antwerp, Belgium by Zaha Hadid (2016), where a ship-like structure of glass and steel on a white concrete perch seems to have landed atop the old port building constructed in 1922. The <b>faceted</b> <b>glass</b> structure also resembles a diamond, a symbol of Antwerp's role as the major market of diamonds in Europe. It {{was one of the}} last works of Hadid, who died in 2016.|$|R

50|$|The Peranakan {{retained}} most {{of their}} ethnic and religious origins (such as ancestor worship), but assimilated the language {{and culture of the}} Malays.The Nyonya's clothing, Baju Panjang (Long Dress) was adapted from the native Malay's Baju Kurung. It is worn with a batik sarong (batik wrap-around skirt) and 3 kerosang (brooches). Peranakan beaded slippers called Kasot Manek were hand-made with much skill and patience: strung, beaded and sewn onto canvas with tiny <b>faceted</b> <b>glass</b> cut beads (known as Manek Potong) from Bohemia (present-day Czech Republic).|$|R
50|$|The main facade (north) along Bloor Street pinches inward {{to where}} the entrance, {{in the form of}} a glass shard, emerges, {{creating}} a more generous forecourt. This glass protrusion is one end of a multi-level 'cut' through the building which contains the main vertical circulation, providing a clear view through the building to the three-story <b>faceted</b> <b>glass</b> wall, designed by Lutz Haufschild, on the south facade. The entire stone volume appears to float above a ribbon of glass display windows on street level; the limestone glows in late afternoon sunlight.|$|R
50|$|Within the Cathedral, {{there are}} twelve pillars covered in walnut symbolizing the twelve Apostles. Consecration candles for each pillar were added in 2009 by Bishop John R. Gaydos. Sound and surface noise {{inherent}} in terrazzo flooring required unusual attention to achieve good acoustics {{in the large}} open, room. Padded walls, covered in mesh, with strips of walnut help to absorb the noise. Other acoustical features include the padded red oak pews, {{as well as the}} decorative <b>faceted</b> <b>glass</b> windows. Another feature of the design of the Cathedral is that there are no supporting pillars in the open expanse.|$|R
5000|$|During 1764-1767 {{he built}} an egg-shaped clock, {{containing}} a complex automatic mechanism. In 1769 Kulibin gave this clock to Catherine II, who assigned Kulibin {{to be in}} charge of the mechanical workshop in the Academy of Sciences of Saint Petersburg (established in 1724). There, Kulibin built a “planetary” pocket-clock, which showed not only the current time, but also the month, day of the week, the season and the current moon phase. Kulibin also designed projects for tower clocks, miniature [...] "clock-in-a-ring" [...] types and others. He also worked on new ways to <b>facet</b> <b>glass</b> for use in microscopes, telescopes and other optical instruments.|$|R
5000|$|Under {{the name}} The Original Canton Delicate Ginger Liqueur the liqueur was {{produced}} until 1997 in Doumen, a district {{of the city}} of Zhuhai in the Pearl River Delta of China's southern Guangdong province, near Macau. It was sold in limited quantity in the United States before high-end Asian fusion cuisine became popular. In its original formulation, the liqueur's ingredients were advertised to include six varieties of ginger, ginseng, [...] "gentle herbs," [...] "finest spirits," [...] brandy, and honey. Its strength was 20 percent alcohol (40 proof), and it was sold in decorative <b>faceted</b> <b>glass</b> bottles of various sizes.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Faceted</b> {{drinking}} <b>glasses,</b> however, {{have been}} known in Russia from much older time. Their depictions are often found on the pictures from the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when they became widespread.|$|R
50|$|Like the One World Trade Center, {{the tower}} {{features}} a <b>faceted</b> <b>glass</b> facade that gently tapers from a square base but transitions to a triangular rooftop. The offices, apartments and a hotel each {{have their own}} entrance lobby. The facade is made of high-performance glazed glass with exterior shading devices which allows the structure to regulate internal temperatures. The tower also features low-flow plumbing fixtures allowing reduced water usage by more than 20 percent compared to the average consumption rate of a typical office building. In addition, a graywater collection system is used to flush wastewater while collected stormwater is stored and reused, reducing water consumption by more than 50 percent.|$|R
5000|$|In 1950, Bernard O. Gruneke, then art {{director}} of Conrad Schmitt Studios, {{was one of}} the first American artists to experiment with the dalle de verre technique of producing stained glass (also known as [...] "slab glass" [...] or [...] "faceted glass"). Gruenke was inspired while traveling in France during the 1940s, and is credited with what may be the first dalle de verre window created in the United States. Experiments with epoxy and support structure at Conrad Schmitt Studios led to the first large-scale installations of <b>faceted</b> <b>glass</b> in the country, including a chapel at Notre Dame University's Moreau Seminary in South Bend, Indiana in 1959.|$|R
25|$|Of all her works, Hadid {{designed}} {{only one}} government building, offices for the port authority, or Havenhuis, in Antwerp, Belgium, completed in 2016. Most new government buildings attempt to express solidity and seriousness but Port Authority, a ship-like structure {{of glass and}} steel on a white concrete perch, seems to have landed atop the old port building constructed in 1922. The <b>faceted</b> <b>glass</b> structure also resembles a diamond, a symbol of Antwerp's role as the major market of diamonds in Europe. It {{was one of the}} last works of Hadid, who died in 2016, the year it opened. The square in front of the building was renamed to Zaha Hadidplein (Zaha Hadidsquare) to honor her death.|$|R
5000|$|Anne Lee {{and their}} son, Henry Lee, {{took over the}} studio after William's death in 1921. Under Henry's guidance, the company {{expanded}} from a regional business to a studio of national and international renown, with completed projects in all fifty states and fourteen foreign countries. Under Henry Lee's guidance, the studio experimented with new techniques, and in the 1950s, {{was one of the}} first American studios to design and fabricate <b>faceted</b> <b>glass</b> windows. Willet Studios also developed the famous sculptured gold window technique and experimented with various methods of laminating stained glass, a technique known as Farbigem. [...] In 1971, the Franklin Institute awarded Henry Lee Willet the Frank P. Brown Medal.|$|R
50|$|Table-glass or granyonyi stakan (гранёный стакан, {{literally}} <b>faceted</b> <b>glass)</b> (granchak гранчак, {{derived from}} грань, meaning facet) {{is a type}} of drinkware made from especially hard and thick glass and having a faceted form. It is a very widespread form of drinking glass in Russia and the former Soviet Union. Granyonyi stakan has certain advantages over the other drinkware, since due to its form and hardness it is more difficult to break. It is arguably handier in usage on moving trains or rolling ships, where it is less prone to decline and fall, or slip from hands, and less likely to be broken when hitting the floor, compared to non-faceted types of drinking glasses.|$|R
5000|$|St. John's Lutheran Church {{bought the}} mansion in 1959 for $60,000 and {{converted}} {{it into a}} church. The sanctuary was added in 1969 according to designs by architects Barker and Cunningham using Stone Mountain granite. The octagonal shape, used in earlier periods of history to signify the [...] "eighth day of creation" [...] (baptism into the death and resurrection of Jesus), was contemporary in 1969. It seats 300 in five rows around a central altar reflecting [...] "St. John's understanding of the Church as the family of God gathered around the table of God." [...] The four-sided cross above the altar is made of <b>faceted</b> <b>glass</b> and a W. Zimmer & Sons pipe organ was added in 1983.|$|R
50|$|Designed by Wallace K. Harrison, the new {{sanctuary}} {{was dedicated}} in March 1958. Its shape has been likened {{to that of}} a fish- a symbol used in early Christianity. The fish shape is apparent both in the profile and in the floor plan of the structure. Enhancing the unique shape of the church are the enormous stained glass windows in the sanctuary, which contain more than 20,000 pieces of <b>faceted</b> <b>glass.</b> These windows depict the story of the Crucifixion (on the right side), and the Resurrection (on the left). A 32 ft cross faced with wood from the Canterbury Cathedral in England, dominates the Chancel. The church originally had an electronic organ, now replaced with a large Visser-Rowland pipe organ.|$|R
5000|$|Duval {{was one of}} {{the first}} stained glass {{designers}} to use Dalle de verre, a thick, <b>faceted</b> <b>glass</b> created with a hammer and anvil rather than cut. He is credited for [...] "developing, refining, and putting his personal touch on both aesthetic approach and improved technique". Inspired by the lyrical abstraction of Nicolas de Stael's paintings, he was also one of the first to introduce an abstract aesthetic into ecclesiastic settings. His use of both transparent and translucent glass allowed nature or the surrounding environment to be included in his designs. His choice of faceted- or cut-glass was determined by the building design and, throughout his career, Duval worked equally within the two media. He described his techniques in Working With Stained Glass, first published in 1972.|$|R
2500|$|Rother {{decided she}} wanted to begin {{producing}} art again so she went for a visit to Europe where she saw the struggle to restore or rebuild war-damaged churches and cathedrals. She also designed stained glass for American churches and had installations in the mid-1960s, mainly in Michigan, such as the Beverly Hills United Methodist Church in Beverly Hills, and the St. Lazarus Serbian Orthodox Cathedral in northeast Detroit with all thick [...] "chunk" [...] <b>faceted</b> <b>glass,</b> that was fabricated in France. In 1962, the St. James United Church of Christ in Dearborn, was dedicated featuring windows and the reredos designed by Rother. The glass was selected and fabricated into small pieces by a family group of craftsmen in Buche, a suburb of Paris, before being shipped from France for final assembly during the construction.|$|R

2500|$|Industrial Light & Magic's (ILM) Joe Johnston sketched and Colin Cantwell built {{models that}} {{eventually}} became the final X-wing fighter in Star Wars. The X-wings {{were designed to}} appear more [...] "traditional" [...] than the Empire's TIE fighters. ILM built miniatures in various scales, with wing markings indicating which prop represented which pilot. When ILM fell behind on generating X-wing footage, Star Wars producer George Lucas and his editors temporarily used World War II dogfight footage for initial editing cuts. Each X-wing model was built around a hollow core made from surgical tubing, which allowed lighting, cooling, and electrical connectors for the wing motors to be installed and maintained. The cockpit windows were made from <b>faceted</b> <b>glass</b> so that accurate reflections could be filmed. Although the movie's initial script and novelization describe the X-wings as belonging to [...] "Blue squadron", limitations in bluescreen photography led to the markings on the filming models, {{as well as the}} fictional squadron affiliation being changed to red.|$|R
