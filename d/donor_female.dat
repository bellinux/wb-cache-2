The first experiment examined average resynchronization rates for animals in each condition. The second experiment examined resynchronization rates for a smaller group of animals, each treated as its own control. Female phase-shifters resynchronized temperature and activity rhythms significantly faster when housed with an entrained (<b>donor)</b> <b>female</b> than those females housed with another phase-shifting female or housed alone. Females housed with entrained males resynchronized their temperature rhythms significantly slower than females housed with entrained females. No differences in resynchronization rate for phase-shifting males existed between test conditions. However, activity rhythms of male controls (housed alone) reentrained significantly faster than those of female controls. These experiments demonstrate a sex difference in (i) reentrainment rate by photic cues alone; (ii) donors' effect on female phase-shifters' resynchronization; and (iii) phase-shifters' resynchronization response to donor cues.

40|$|The {{hypothesis}} that elimination of facultative and strict anaerobic microorganisms from the gastro-intestinal tract by antimicrobial {{drugs in the}} period of time around allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) prevents acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), was examined in a cohort of 112 children grafted between 1989 and 2002 for hematological malignancies. All patients received T-cell replete marrow from human leukocyte antigens (HLA) matched sibling donors under identical transplantation conditions. To eliminate microorganisms from the gastro-intestinal tract, total gastro-intestinal decontamination (GID) was applied by high doses of non-absorbable antimicrobial drugs while the graft recipient was maintained in strict protective isolation. About half of the children (51 %) proved to be successfully decontaminated, and about half (49 %) unsuccessfully. One recipient got acute GVHD in the first group and 8 in the second group (p = 0. 013). The degree of success of total GID was decisive for the occurrence of acute GVHD, irrespective of the presence of other risk factors such as higher age of recipient and/or <b>donor,</b> <b>female</b> donor for male recipient and carriership or reactivation of herpesviruses.

Both groups were randomly analyzed at 4 or 18 weeks. Bone remodeling areas (inner and outer cortical samples) were labeled and laser capture microdissected. Analysis of sex-mismatch genes by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction provided the relative Expression Ratio (rER) of <b>donor</b> (<b>female)</b> to recipient (male) cells.

40|$|A {{stochastic}} simulation {{was used}} in the first study to evaluate the effects of international scenario, type of sire, number of selected sires, selection criterion, herd size and planning horizon. Response variables were profit, lower 95 % confidence limit for profit, and utility. Responses for selection of sires on profit index at year 10 or 20 were similar and superior to responses from selecting on the basis of milk-fat-protein indexes. Less favorable economic conditions within an international scenario, use of a 10 -year planning horizon, or selection in scenarios with lower absolute responses favor the optimum of using inexpensive randomly chosen young sires. Under a scenario of average economic conditions, use of selected proven and young sires was generally superior to use of randomly chosen young sires for profit and lower 95 % confidence limit for profit at 20 -year planning horizon in all combinations, but was inferior for utility at year 10. Effect of herd size was generally small. ^ A second study investigated optimum conditions for maximizing genetic response in nucleus herds of dairy cattle using multiple ovulation and embryo transfer (MOET), in vitro embryo production (IVEP) and sperm sexing technologies. Deterministic modeling was used to compare 15 -year selection responses in nucleus herds with different combinations of herd size, number of sires used by year, female to male ratio and number of progeny per <b>donor</b> <b>female.</b> Adult nucleus herds of 655 to 2300 first lactation cows had rates of genetic gain adjusted for inbreeding depression comparable to those of an efficient progeny testing program.

In Experiment 1, C and B pups were tested {{in a series of}} tests simultaneously opposing either murine milk and a blank (water), or two milks collected in early and late lactation (lactation days 2 and 15, respectively) from females belonging to their own or the other strain. Results showed that C and B pups were attracted to the odor of the different milks regardless of the lactation age and the strain of the <b>donor</b> <b>female.</b> Nevertheless, C and B pups preferred the odor conveyed by early- than late-lactation milk of either strain. Moreover, early-lactation milk from C females was more attractive than early-lactation milk from B females for pups of either strain. In Experiment 2, differential nipple grasping response of C and B pups was measured when they were exposed to nipples of females in early or late lactation. The proportion of C pups that grasped a nipple was greater when they were exposed to a nipple in early lactation regardless of the strain of the donor females, whereas the proportion of B pups that grasped a nipple was greater when they were exposed to a nipple in early lactation, but only from own strain.

ResultsOf the 21, 928 patients undergoing HT, 14, 592 (66. 6 %) were performed with a normal donor to recipient weight ratio, 7212 (32. 9 %) were performed with WRL, and 124 (0. 6 %) were performed with WRVL. In male donor to male recipient, male <b>donor</b> to <b>female</b> recipient, and <b>female</b> <b>donor</b> to <b>female</b> recipient HT, the use of WRL did not influence median survival (P = . 3621) and {{was not associated with}} increased mortality (P = . 7273).

40|$|AbstractAllogeneic hematopoietic {{stem cell}} {{transplantation}} (HSCT) remains the only known curative therapy for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML); however, it is rarely utilized given the excellent long-term results with tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) treatment. The {{purpose of this study}} is to examine HSCT outcomes for patients with CML who failed TKI therapy or presented in advanced phase and to identify predictors of survival, relapse, and nonrelapse mortality (NRM). Fifty-one patients with CML underwent HSCT for advanced disease at diagnosis (n = 15), TKI resistance as defined by the European LeukemiaNet guidelines (n = 30), TKI intolerance (n = 2), or physician preference (n = 4). At a median follow-up of 71. 9 months, the 8 -year overall survival (OS), event-free survival (EFS), relapse, and NRM were 68 %, 46 %, 41 %, and 23 %, respectively. In univariate analysis, predictors of OS included first chronic phase (CP 1) disease status at HSCT (P =. 0005), European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation score 1 to 4 (P =. 04), and complete molecular response (CMR) to HSCT (P <. 0001). <b>Donor</b> (<b>female)</b> to patient (male) gender combination (P =. 02) and CMR to HSCT (P <. 0001) predicted lower relapse. In multivariate analysis, CMR to HSCT remained an independent predictor of OS (odds ratio [OR], 43), EFS (OR, 56) and relapse (OR, 29). This report indicates that the outlook is excellent for those patients who remain in CP 1 at the time of HSCT and achieve a CMR after HSCT. However, only approximately 50 % of those in advanced phase at HSCT are long-term survivors.

40|$|Samples from 93 of 115 {{consecutive}} cadaveric renal transplants {{were selected}} to define polymorphisms in both IFN-γ and IL- 10. A 12 CA repeat IFN-γ polymorphic allele was found in 73 patients (70 in patients analysed further). This polymorphism was associated with high IFN-γ production in vitro. According to the presence or not of the 12 CA repeat allele patients were separated in high and low producer genotype groups. The incidence of acute rejection was 54. 3 % in this high IFN-γ genotype group, contrasting with 44. 4 % in the low IFN-γ. Requirement for ATG therapy was greater in the high IFN-γ group (odds ratio [OR]= 2. 5). Among HLA-DR-mismatched patients, IFN-γ high producer genotype was more strongly associated with rejection (OR= 1. 6). In the cyclosporine monotherapy subgroup, 11 out of 14 patients with IFN-γ high genotype (78 %) had acute rejection (OR= 2. 88, p= 0. 09). Graft survival was similar between the two IFN-γ groups. When the analysis was controlled {{for the presence of}} delayed graft function, 40. 5 % of the high IFN-γ genotype patients had serum creatinine levels above 200 micromoles/L contrasting with only 14. 3 % of the low IFN-γ genotype recipients at 5 years after transplantation (p= 0. 05). In a regression model of creatinine at 1 year the significant variables were the presence of DGF, donor age greater than 50, greater than two rejection episodes, DR mismatch, <b>donor</b> <b>female</b> to male recipient sex, IL- 10 high genotype, and IFN-γ high genotype.

40|$|Background: Preservation {{of cardiac}} grafts for {{transplantation}} is not standardized and most centers use a single administration of crystalloid solution {{at the time}} of harvesting. We investigated possible benefits of an additional dose of cardioplegia dispensed immediately before implantation. Methods: Consecutive adult cardiac transplantations (2005 - 2012) were reviewed. Hearts were harvested following a standard protocol (Celsior 2 L, 4 - 8 oC). In 2008, 100 mL crystalloid cardioplegic solution was added and administered immediately before implantation. Univariate and logistic regression analyses were used to investigate risk factors for post-operative graft failure and mid-term outcome. Results: A total of 81 patients, 44 standard (Cardio -) versus 37 with additional cardioplegia (Cardio +) were analyzed. Recipients and donors were comparable in both groups. Cardio + patients demonstrated a reduced need for defibrillation (24 % vs. 48 %, p= 0. 03), post-operative ratio of CK-MB/CK (10. 1 ± 3. 9 % vs. 13. 3 ± 4. 2 %, p= 0. 001), intubation time (2. 0 ± 1. 6 vs. 7. 2 ± 11. 5 days, p= 0. 05) and ICU stay (3. 9 ± 2. 1 vs. 8. 5 ± 7. 8 days, p= 0. 001). Actuarial survival was reduced when graft ischemic time was > 180 minutes in Cardio – but not in Cardio + patients (p= 0. 033). Organ ischemic time > 180 minutes (OR: 5. 48, CI: 1. 08 - 27. 75), <b>donor</b> <b>female</b> gender (OR: 5. 84, CI: 1. 13 - 33. 01) and recipient/donor age > 60 (OR: 6. 33, CI: 0. 86 - 46. 75), but not the additional cardioplegia nor the observation period appeared independent predictors of post-operative acute graft failure.

During a mean follow-up of 8. 1 months (maximum, 18 months), 54 % of the patients had one or more rejection episodes. The mean cumulative number of rejection episodes per patient was 0. 8 at 3 months, 1. 10 at 6 months, and 1. 3 at 12 months after transplantation. By univariate analysis, <b>female</b> <b>donor</b> hearts (irrespective of recipient sex) (p < 0. 01) {{and the use of}} induction therapy (p < 0. 01) were associated with greater cumulative rejection frequency.

The study was based on body- and organlevel models from a single <b>donor</b> (<b>female,</b> 81 - years- old) and motion data recorded from a body-matched volunteer (female, 25 years-old). Models were the donor’s lower-limb musculoskeletal model validated against published measurements of the hip reaction force and the finite-element model of the donor’s right femur validated against measurements of cortical strains. Motion data including skin marker trajectories and ground reaction forces were recorded from the volunteer during walking, which is the most frequent daily activity. The muscle and hip forces were calculated using the musculoskeletal model and applied to the finite-element model to calculate the cortical tensile and compressive strains in two extreme sections of the femoral diaphysis. The anterior, medial, posterior and lateral femoral aspects were assumed at 0 °, 90 °, 180 °, and 270 ° respectively. In the sub-trochanteric section the peak tensile strain during stance was 1300 - 2287 με constantly located laterally (270 °- 300 °) and the peak compressive strain was 1433 - 2730 με constantly located medially (90 °). In the distal diaphysis the peak tensile strain varied from 1714 με to 4171 με located antero-laterally at 300 °- 330 ° and the peak compressive strain varied from 1813 με to 4674 με located posteromedially (90 °- 150 °). We conclude that high cyclic tensile strains determine the typical AFFs onset location whereas more research is necessary to understand how different activities and the individual anatomy affect the femur’s physiological tensile loads...|$|E
40|$|Gebiet: Chirurgie Abstract: Background: Preservation {{of cardiac}} grafts for {{transplantation}} is not standardized and most centers use a single administration of crystalloid solution {{at the time}} of harvesting. We investigated possible benefits of an additional dose of cardioplegia dispensed immediately before implantation. – – Methods: Consecutive adult cardiac transplantations (2005 ? 2012) were reviewed. Hearts were harvested following a standard protocol (Celsior 2 L, 4 ? 8 °C). In 2008, 100 ml crys-talloid cardioplegic solution was added and administered immediately before implanta-tion. Univariate and logistic regression analyses were used to investigate risk factors for post-operative graft failure and mid-term outcome. – – Results: A total of 81 patients, 44 standard (?Cardio???) vs. 37 with additional cardiople-gia (?CardioC?) were analyzed. Recipients and donors were comparable in both groups. CardioC patients demonstrated a reduced need for defibrillation (24 vs. 48 %, p D 0. 03), post-operative ratio of CK-MB/CK (10. 1 _ 3. 9 vs. 13. 3 _ 4. 2 %, p D 0. 001), intubation time (2. 0 _ 1. 6 vs. 7. 2 _ 11. 5 days, p D 0. 05), and ICU stay (3. 9 _ 2. 1 vs. 8. 5 _ 7. 8 days, p D 0. 001). Actuarial survival was reduced when graft ischemic time was > 180 min in Cardio?? but not in CardioC patients (p D 0. 033). Organ ischemic time > 180 min (OR: 5. 48, CI: 1. 08 ? 27. 75), <b>donor</b> <b>female</b> gender (OR: 5. 84, CI: 1. 13 ? 33. 01), and recipient/donor age > 60 (OR: 6. 33, CI: 0. 86 ? 46. 75), but not the additional cardioplegia or the observation period appeared independent predictors of post-operative acute graft failure. – – Conclusion: An additional dose of cardioplegia administered immediately before implan-tation may be a simple way to improve early and late outcome of cardiac transplantation, especially in situations of prolonged graft ischemia. A large, ideally multicentric, randomized study is desirable to verify this preliminary observation...|$|E
40|$|Background: Transfusion related acute lung injury (TRALI) {{is known}} as {{transfusion}} hazard with high morbidity and mortality rate. Mainly HLA class II {{have been associated with}} TRALI. Preventive measures are in the exclusion of <b>donor</b> <b>female</b> as they carry any these antibodies. Aim: We study a group of female blood donor with prior history of two or more pregnancies (G 2), one (G 1) pregnancy and without any pregnancy (G 0) for detection of HLA antibodies. Methods: We collected a total of 108 samples between September and December of 2010 (G 2 - 56; G 1 - 19 and G 0 - 33 samples). For detection of HLA antibodies we used the LABScreen Mixed Assay which is multiplex technique that detects anti HLA Class I and II 1 gG antibodies. Microparticles (beads) are coated with HLA antigens. Those beads have a combination of two dyes, and for each set of beads the dyes proportions are different so that the bead sets can be distinguished. Positivity was defined when the ratio is equal or higher than 4. Results: In the totality of the 108 study samples we found positivity for HLA class I antibodies in 22 % (G 2 - 32 %, G 1 - 26 %, G 0 - 3 %) and for HLA class II antibodies in 17 % of samples (G 2 - 27 %, G 1 - 5 %, and G 0 - 6 %). Positivity for both HLA class I and II antibodies was found only in G 2 samples (18 %) and G 1 samples (5 %). Our study also shows a 12 % of positivity only for HLA class I antibodies (G 2 - 14 %, G 1 - 21 %, G 0 - 3 %) and a 6 % of positivity only for HLA class II antibodies (G 2 - 9 %, G 1 - 0 %, G 0 - 6 %). Conclusions: Our study reveals higher prevalence of HLA class I and II antibodies in G 2 population. Women with both positive HLA Class I and II antibodies have been excluded for blood donation in order to prevent TRALI in recipients. This study will continue with a higher number of samples. Idea was to test all this women to HLA class antibodies prior to each blood donation...|$|E
40|$|Autoimmune {{thyroid disease}} (AITD) may occur in {{patients}} after {{hematopoietic stem cell}} transplantation (HSCT). In all, 10 cases of AITD (seven allogeneic and three autologous HSCT) were diagnosed among 721 HSCT recipients, including two patients with sequential hyper- and hypothyroidism. The 5 -year actuarial rates for AITD after allogeneic and autologous HSCT were 2. 9 and 4 %, respectively. Significant risk factors included HSCT for chronic myeloid leukemia, the HLA B 46 and DR 9 loci and the A 2 B 46 DR 9 haplotype, while <b>female</b> <b>donors</b> showed trend to significance. On multivariate analysis, only <b>female</b> <b>donors</b> and HLA DR 9 remained significant. For autologous HSCT, the associations with HLA B 46 and DR 9 were also significant. Only three donors had {{a family history of}} AITD. A review of other reported cases confirmed the predominance of <b>female</b> <b>donors,</b> although the other associations including graft-versus-host disease, familial AITD and other autoimmune phenomena might be related to reporting bias. Since the actuarial incidence of AITD from <b>female</b> <b>donors</b> with predisposing HLA alleles may be over 30 %, susceptible recipients should be carefully monitored. Owing to the small number of reported cases and different HLA associations with AITD in different populations, our observations await confirmatory data from other registries. © 2005 Nature Publishing Group.

40|$|AbstractThe {{mismatched}} minor histocompatibility antigens {{present on}} Y chromosome (H-Y) in male recipients receiving {{stem cells from}} <b>female</b> <b>donors</b> {{may contribute to the}} graft-versus-leukemia effect and results in a reduced relapse rate, especially in patients with high-risk disease. We retrospectively compared the outcomes of male patients with acute myeloid leukemia who received an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) from <b>female</b> <b>donors</b> (F-M) (174 patients) versus other gender combinations (667 patients). Median age was 50  years (range, 18 to 74  years). For the whole group, the 1 -year cumulative incidence of relapse was significantly lower in F-M group (34. 1 % versus 41. 3 %, P =. 044), whereas nonrelapse mortality (NRM) was higher (23. 2 % versus 15. 7 %, P =. 004). For patients younger than 50  years beyond first complete remission, the F-M group was associated with lower relapse rate (42. 5 % versus 55. 2 %, P =. 045) whereas NRM was not significantly different (35. 8 % versus 25. 5 %, P =. 141). Although survival was not significantly improved, transplantation from a <b>female</b> <b>donor</b> for male recipient was associated with a lower relapse rate. When relapse is the most common concern for treatment failure, especially for younger patients, a <b>female</b> <b>donor</b> for a male recipient might be beneficial to decrease relapse rate after transplantation. Future studies are needed to explore how the H-Y mismatch may improve survival after transplantation...|$|R
40|$|Two to {{six years}} after they had donated a kidney the 24 -hour {{creatinine}} clearances of five women and four men had recovered to 85 % and 87 % respectively of prenephrectomy performance. The male donors had a lower 24 -hour creatinine clearance than age-matched controls, but during dextrose and inulin infusion they had similar values for inulin clearance, creatinine clearance, and glucose reabsorption. By contrast, the <b>female</b> <b>donors</b> had significantly reduced clearances both over 24 hours and during infusion, as well as impaired ability to reabsorb glucose. This suggests that potential <b>female</b> <b>donors</b> should be more vigorously investigated before nephrectomy...|$|R
