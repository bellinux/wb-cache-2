40|$|AbstractExperimental {{evidence}} is presented demonstrating {{the existence of}} a potent O 2. − 2 source in heart mitochondria. The novel O. − 2 generator is more active than any other known mitochondrial O. − 2 generator and also exhibits a higher affinity for molecular oxygen. In contrast to mitochondrial O. − 2 sources reported previously [(1974) FEBS Lett. 42, 68 – 72; (1978) Eur. <b>J.</b> <b>Biochem.</b> 82, 563 – 567], the O. − 2 generator described in this paper is not involved in energy-linked respiration. Superoxide radicals from this source require NADH to initiate their generation, and the radicals formed are released entirely into the extramitochondrial space. NADH-related O. − 2 generation was also observed with the solubilized erogenous NADH oxidoreductase of heart mitochondria, an enzyme recently described [(1987) Eur. <b>J.</b> <b>Biochem.,</b> submitted]. This finding together with the lack of an NADH-dependent O. − 2 source in liver mithochondria suggests that the novel O. − 2 generator and the erogenous NADH oxidoreductase of heart mitochondria are identical...|$|R

G., Lin, Y., Tang, J. & Pires, E. (1996) Eur. <b>J.</b> <b>Biochem.</b> 235, 76220137681. We found that the glycosylation sites are occupied for the barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) aspartic proteinase (Asn 333) and the cardoon (Cynara cardunculus L.) aspartic proteinase, cardosin A (Asn 70 and Asn 363). The oligosaccharides from each site were released from peptide pools by enzymatic hydrolysis with peptide-N-glycanase A or by hydrazinolysis and their structures were determined by exoglycosidase sequencing combined with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry. It was observed that 6 % of the oligosaccharides from the first glycosylation site of cardosin A are of the oligomannose type. Modified type glycans with proximal Fuc and without Xyl account for about 82 %, 14 % and 3 % of the total oligosaccharides from the first and the second glycosylation sites of cardosin A and from H. vulgare aspartic proteinase, respectively. Oligosaccharides with Xyl but without proximal Fuc were only detected in the latter proteinase (4 %).

To assay the functionality of the water splitting complex, we compared the single flash P 680 (+) reduction kinetics in these supercomplexes with those of PS II-rich granal stack membranes (BBYs). We found that the P 680 (+) reduction kinetics in PS II-LHC II supercomplexes were indistinguishable from those in BBYs. We also examined a number of PS II core particles lacking the Lhcb components. All of these had different P 680 (+) reduction kinetics, which we attributed to partial loss of OEC function before and during the measurements...|$|R

An alternative proposal in which the deviations arise from recycling of an enzyme-MgADP complex [Pettersson (1986) Eur. <b>J.</b> <b>Biochem.</b> 154, 167 - 170] also accounts satisfactorily for some of the data, but the required enzyme-MgADP complex could not be detected in isotope-exchange measurements.
