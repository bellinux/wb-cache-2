5000|$|Root {{access is}} {{sometimes}} compared to jailbreaking devices running the Apple iOS operating system. However, these are different concepts: Jailbreaking is the bypass of {{several types of}} Apple prohibitions for the end user, including modifying the operating system (enforced by a [...] "locked bootloader"), installing non-officially approved applications via sideloading, and granting the user elevated administration-level privileges (rooting). Only a minority of Android devices lock their bootloaders, and many vendors such as HTC, Sony, Asus and Google explicitly provide the ability to <b>unlock</b> <b>devices,</b> and even replace the operating system entirely. Similarly, the ability to sideload applications is typically permissible on Android devices without root permissions. Thus, it is primarily the third aspect of iOS jailbreaking (giving users administrative privileges) that most directly correlates to Android rooting.|$|R
50|$|Another {{example of}} eye {{tracking}} is security. Users can set a gaze-operated password, {{where they would}} have to look at certain parts of the screen in order to <b>unlock</b> the <b>device.</b> Some would argue that this is a more efficient and secure way to lock their devices.|$|R

50|$|A 2006 study {{sponsored}} by the Portugal regulator, ANACOM, on handset subsidies and SIM locking concluded {{that there are no}} special regulatory concerns on offering subsidized SIM-locked equipment in exchange for signing a contract tying a customer to a particular network.

In the paper, the author stated that the average unlocking fee charged by Portuguese carriers is 90-100 euros.A recently approved law requires network operators to <b>unlock</b> a <b>device</b> free of charge if the respective contract has already expired (But they refuse to do so charging at least 10 euros). It also establishes limits to the fees that operators may charge to <b>unlock</b> a <b>device</b> while it is still under contract.|$|R
