5|$|Elsewhere, {{such as in}} the UK, hares are {{not always}} seen as pests, and there are species action plans aiming to {{significantly}} increase their numbers. Some coursers say that coursing assists conservation because it leads to sporting landowners creating a habitat suitable for hares. Opponents of coursing say that the converse is true, namely that coursing takes place where hares live rather than hares living where coursing takes place. It <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> that coursing kills slower hares, and it is said by some coursers that this leaves faster hares to breed and multiply.|$|E
5|$|However, Swelim's {{theory is}} not widely accepted. Grimal, Helck, Wilkinson and Stadelmann {{point out that}} during the 3rd dynasty it became a fashion that royal stone bowls with {{polished}} surfaces showed only Horus names, without any guiding inscriptions. This <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> for the stone bowls of king Khaba. This decor style was practiced still under Sneferu, {{the founder of the}} 4th dynasty. Thus, Khaba is thought to have reigned close {{to the end of the}} Third Dynasty.|$|E
5|$|In mathematics, {{constructions of}} {{mathematical}} objects are needed, which <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> for stochastic processes, {{to prove that}} they exist mathematically. There are two main approaches for constructing a stochastic process. One approach involves considering a measurable space of functions, defining a suitable measurable mapping from a probability space to this measurable space of functions, and then deriving the corresponding finite-dimensional distributions.|$|E
25|$|This <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> for Belgian {{subjects}} until 28 April 2008, since Belgium denounced Chapter 1 of {{this treaty}} on such date. In a similar way, this <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> for Luxembourgian subjects until 10 July 2009.|$|R

50|$|Country Style was an Australian {{television}} variety series which {{aired on}} ABC during 1958. ABC series typically had shorter seasons than shows on commercial television, which <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> with Country Style.|$|R
5|$|Travel is {{a common}} theme in American {{autobiography}} as a whole; McPherson writes that it {{is something of a}} national myth to Americans as a people. This <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> for African-American autobiography, which {{has its roots in the}} slave narrative. The Heart of a Woman has three primary settings—the San Francisco Bay Area, New York, and Egypt—and two secondary ones—London and Accra.|$|E
5|$|Commercial diving {{operations}} may {{expose the}} diver to more and sometimes greater hazards than recreational diving, but the associated occupational {{health and safety}} legislation is less tolerant of risk than recreational, particularly technical divers, may be prepared to accept. Commercial diving operations are also constrained by the physical realities of the operating environment, and expensive engineering solutions are often necessary to control risk. A formal hazard identification and risk assessment is a standard and required part of the planning for a commercial diving operation, and this <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> for offshore diving operations. The occupation is inherently hazardous, and great effort and expense are routinely incurred to keep the risk within an acceptable range. The standard methods of reducing risk are followed where possible.|$|E
5|$|Female {{individuals}} of Laevistrombus canarium are generally larger (both shell and soft parts) than male individuals, which <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> in other strombid gastropods {{such as the}} spider conch (Harpago chiragra) and queen conch (Lobatus gigas). The external anatomy of the soft parts of this species {{is similar to that}} of the other members of the family: the animal has a long extensible snout and thin eyestalks (also known as ommatophores), with well-developed lens eyes at the tips. Each eyestalk has a small sensory tentacle branching off near the end. The large foot of the animal is narrow and strong, able to perform the leaping form of locomotion that is also found in other species of Strombidae (such as the queen conch).|$|E
50|$|Early Australian {{television}} series often aired {{in just a}} single city, which <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> with <b>The</b> Happy Go Lucky Show. It is unlikely (though not impossible) {{that any of the}} episodes were kinescoped.|$|R

5|$|In {{the upper}} Vistula basin, where the Przeworsk culture {{settlements}} were still relatively dense {{in the first}} half of the 5th century, they are markedly absent during the second half of it. This <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> in Silesia - the depopulation pattern began there earlier and the latest finds are dated around 400 AD. All of it agrees well with the information given by Procopius of Caesarea, according to whom the Heruli returning to Scandinavia from the Carpathian Basin in 512, heading towards the Varni tribe area in Germany, crossed a large region devoid of human settlements - presumably Silesia and Lusatia. Likewise there are no settlements found in Masovia and Podlasie beyond the early part of the 5th century. On the other hand, in central Poland and Greater Poland isolated remnants from the Roman era cultures continue to be located through the end of 5th and even into the earlier parts of the 6th century. Still further north, in Pomerania, such findings are actually quite numerous, including many cult coin deposit sites (Roman and then Byzantine golden solidi). That's where the Germanic groups lasted the longest (and kept up trade and other contacts with their brethren elsewhere).|$|E
5|$|Spiders have {{developed}} several different respiratory anatomies, based on book lungs, a tracheal system, or both. Mygalomorph and Mesothelae spiders have {{two pairs of}} book lungs filled with haemolymph, where openings on the ventral surface of the abdomen allow air to enter and diffuse oxygen. This <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> for some basal araneomorph spiders, like the family Hypochilidae, but the remaining {{members of this group}} have just the anterior pair of book lungs intact while the posterior pair of breathing organs are partly or fully modified into tracheae, through which oxygen is diffused into the haemolymph or directly to the tissue and organs. The trachea system has most likely evolved in small ancestors to help resist desiccation. The trachea were originally connected to the surroundings through a pair of openings called spiracles, but in the majority of spiders this pair of spiracles has fused into a single one in the middle, and moved backwards close to the spinnerets. Spiders that have tracheae generally have higher metabolic rates and better water conservation. Spiders are ectotherms, so environmental temperatures affect their activity.|$|E

50|$|Early Australian {{series in}} many cases were {{broadcast}} only on a single station (such as TV Disc Jockey on TCN-9 and The Happy Go Lucky Show on GTV-9) which <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> with <b>The</b> Judy Jack Show.|$|R
50|$|Australian Aborigines before European {{settlement}} did {{not wear}} clothes in day-to-day life; but <b>were</b> <b>also</b> ritually exposed as a functional part testing endurance, e.g., to undergo scarification, as <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> and Sepik River tribes in Papua New Guinea.|$|R
30|$|In Alänge et al. (1998), {{organizational}} innovation {{was found}} hard {{to separate from}} inter-firm diffusion as it was constantly re-invented/re-created during the diffusion process. This <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> in <b>the</b> intra-firm diffusion process, with respect to implementing and sustaining the organizational innovation.|$|R
25|$|In {{the year}} 2007-2008, Universitas Indonesia {{underwent}} substantial reform. Revenue was significantly increased from 800 billion to 1.6 trillion rupiah.

25|$|Outside of {{the desktop}} arena, however, the ARM {{architecture}} (RISC) is in widespread use in smartphones, tablets and {{many forms of}} embedded device.

50|$|From 1982 to 1983, WOR-TV in New York ran a late {{afternoon}} movie program called The 4:30 Movie, but it bore {{no relation to}} WABC's movie umbrella. This <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> for sister station KHJ's The 3:30 Movie in the Los Angeles market.|$|R
50|$|About {{three years}} later, the IBM System/360 Model 91 (1966) {{introduced}} Tomasulo's algorithm, which made full out-of-order execution possible. In 1990, IBM introduced the first out-of-order microprocessor, the POWER1, although out-of-order execution {{was limited to}} floating-point instructions (as <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> on <b>the</b> Model 91).|$|R
30|$|In the {{extended}} plant tests, the validity criteria {{with respect to}} seedling emergence and seedling survival rates were not always met, mostly with pig manure application. However, this <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> in <b>the</b> standard plant tests and might have been related to the test soil moisture not being ideal for all test plant species.|$|R
25|$|Soju is a {{clear spirit}} which was {{originally}} made from grain, especially rice, and is now also made from sweet potatoes or barley. Soju made from grain is considered superior (as <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> with grain vs. potato vodka). Soju is around 22% ABV, and is a favorite beverage of hard-up college students, hard-drinking businessmen, and blue-collar workers.|$|E
25|$|A Spanish study {{suggests}} that forest fragmentation adversely affects the numbers of short-toed treecreepers present, as <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> with the common treecreeper. Species that depend on relatively scarce resources, such as tree trunks, only occupy the larger forests, whereas those such as tits and common firecrests that exploit abundant, ubiquitous resources are distributed uniformly through woodlands of all sizes.|$|E
25|$|The ring of kingship {{that appears}} in Sassanian {{investiture}} reliefs is often identified as representing khwarrah. This <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> for the ring held by the bearded figure in the Achaemenid winged sun-disk symbol that is traditionally considered to represent a fravashi (MP: fravahr). The Achaemenid winged sun-disk has in its entirety also been occasionally been interpreted as a representation of khvarenah.|$|E
30|$|That {{recurrent}} relations can {{be written}} {{in the form of}} difference equations and vice-versa was realized during the eighteenth century by other researchers. Laplace could be the first who noted the connection (see [6]). This is why many researchers have been using both notions interchangeably since that time. This will <b>be</b> <b>also</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> in our paper.|$|R
2500|$|Inflection of {{adjectives}} is more complicated.

25|$|The whole {{structure}} {{is protected by}} railings, the last version of which dates from 1851. The latter prevented access to water, relegating the fountain to a decorative and symbolic role. It <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>the</b> <b>case,</b> around the same time, of the other fountains in Brussels. This correlates with efforts by the City of Brussels, starting in 1855, {{to allow for the}} distribution of drinking water in homes.|$|E
25|$|Examples {{of roads}} that have (very) steep climbs and descents are: (inland) Simblegårdsvej in Klemensker, which begins by the village inn Klemens Kro, and Slamrebjergvej just outside Nexø {{extending}} northward {{from the main}} road from Rønne. Along the coast there are several steep roads, which <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> {{in some parts of}} Denmark as a whole, for instance in and around Vejle.|$|E
25|$|In a study {{involving}} 21 HIV co-infected patients (DICO), pre-treatment baseline plasma {{levels of}} IP-10 predicted {{the reduction of}} HCV RNA during {{the first days of}} interferon/ribavirin therapy (“first phase decline”) for HCV genotypes 1-3, as <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> in HCV mono-infected patients. Pre-treatment IP-10 levels below 150 pg/mL are predictive of a favorable response, and may thus be useful in encouraging these otherwise difficult-to-treat patients to initiate therapy.|$|E
