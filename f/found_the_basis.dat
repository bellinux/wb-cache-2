500|$|The Foreign Review of 1830 broadly admired Cuvier's work, but {{disagreed}} with his classification. It commented that [...] "From the comprehensive {{nature of the}} Règne Animal, embracing equally the structure and history of all the existing and extinct races of animals, this work {{may be viewed as}} an epitome of M. Cuvier's zoological labours; and it presents the best outline, which exists in any language, of the present state of zoology and comparative anatomy." [...] The review continued less favourably, however, that [...] "We cannot help thinking that the science of comparative anatomy is now so far advanced, as to afford the means of distributing the animal kingdom on some more uniform and philosophical principles,—as on the modifications of those systems or functions which are most general in the animal economy". The review argued that the vertebrate division relied on the presence of a vertebral column, [...] "a part of the organization of comparatively little importance in the economy"; it <b>found</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> of the mollusca on [...] "the general softness of the body" [...] no better; the choice of the presence of articulations no better either, in the third division; while in the fourth it points out that while the echinoderms may fit well into the chosen scheme, it did not apply [...] "to the entozoa, zoophyta, and infusoria, which constitute by much the greatest portion of this division." [...] But the review notes that [...] "the general distribution of the animal kingdom established by M.

As an ingenious man, he had necessarily to encounter every discouragement that the ruling powers for a length of time had been able by any means to put in the way of this class of culprits; but that was only reasonable self-defence in the powers, since How to do it must obviously be regarded as the natural and mortal enemy of How not to do it. In this was to be <b>found</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> of the wise system, by tooth and nail upheld by the Circumlocution Office, of warning every ingenious British subject to be ingenious at his peril: of harassing him, obstructing him, inviting robbers (by making his remedy uncertain, and expensive) to plunder him, and at the best of confiscating his property after a short term of enjoyment, as though invention were on a par with felony. The system had uniformly found great favour with the Barnacles, and that was only reasonable, too; for one who worthily invents must be in earnest, and the Barnacles abhorred and dreaded nothing half so much. That again was very reasonable; since in a country suffering under the affliction of a great amount of earnestness, there might, in an exceeding short space of time, be not a single Barnacle left sticking to a post.|$|E

60|$|He {{found his}} kingdom in great confusion, the feudal chieftains having taken {{advantage}} of the troubles and irregularities of a long interregnum, to strengthen themselves in their possessions, and place themselves above the power of the laws. James sought to <b>found</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> of his power in the affections of his people. He attached the lower orders to him by the reformation of abuses, the temperate and equable administration of justice, the encouragement of the arts of peace, and the promotion of every thing that could diffuse comfort, competency, and innocent enjoyment through the humblest ranks of society. He mingled occasionally among the common people in disguise; visited their firesides; entered into their cares, their pursuits, and their amusements; informed himself of the mechanical arts, and how they could best be patronized and improved; and was thus an all-pervading spirit, watching with a benevolent eye over the meanest of his subjects. Having in this generous manner made himself strong in the hearts of the common people, he turned himself to curb the power of the factious nobility; to strip them of those dangerous immunities which they had usurped; to punish such as had been guilty of flagrant offences; and to bring the whole into proper obedience to the Crown. For some time they bore this with outward submission, but with secret impatience and brooding resentment. A conspiracy was at length formed against his life, at the head of which was his own uncle, Robert Stewart, Earl of Athol, who, being too old himself for the perpetration of the deed of blood, instigated his grandson, Sir Robert Stewart, together with Sir Robert Graham, and others of less note, to commit the deed. They broke into his bedchamber at the Dominican convent near Perth, where he was residing, and barbarously murdered him by oft-repeated wounds. His faithful queen, rushing to throw her tender body between him and the sword, was twice wounded in the ineffectual attempt to shield him from the assassin; and it was not until she had been forcibly torn from his person, that the murder was accomplished.|$|E

50|$|From the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, people of the Second Aliyah worked to change the status and situation of the Jewish community in the Land of Israel. The decisive compensation for their efforts came with the outbreak of World War I in 1914, and the events that followed in its wake: in 1917 the Russian Revolution took place and the Bolsheviks seized the government; the Ottoman and the Austro-Hungarian Empires dissolved into individual nations; and even the victorious Colonial powers, headed by Britain and France, began in effect a process of convergence. After the signing of the peace agreements, {{and as a result of}} them, a new world order prevailed; and in the Land of Israel, the British Mandate government slowly took root, beginning with the Balfour Declaration and the entry of the army into the Land of Israel, effecting a gradual occupation in 1918, {{the beginning}} of the military government, and later the civil government in 1920, and ending in the publication of the first “White Book” in 1922.

5000|$|The {{distinctive}} features of Beneke's system are the firmness {{with which he}} maintained that in empirical psychology is to be <b>found</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> of all philosophy, and his rigid treatment of mental phenomena by the genetic method. According to Beneke, the perfected mind is a development from simple elements, and the first problem of philosophy is the determination of these elements and of the processes by which the development takes place. In his Neue Psychologie (essays iii., viii. and ix.), he defined his position with regard to his predecessors and contemporaries. This and the introduction to his Lehrbuch signaled the two great stages in tile progress of psychology the negation of innate ideas by John Locke, and of faculties, in the ordinary acceptation of the term, by Herbart. The next step was his own; he insisted that psychology must be treated {{as one of the}} natural sciences. As is the case with them, its content is given by experience alone, and differs from theirs only in being the object of the internal as opposed to the external sense. But by this Beneke in no wise meant a psychology founded on physiology. These two sciences, in his opinion, had quite distinct provinces and gave no mutual assistance. Just as little help is to be expected from the science of the body as from mathematics and metaphysics, both of which had been pressed by Herbart into the service of psychology. The true method of study is that applied with so much success in the physical sciences: critical examination of the given experience, and reference of it to ultimate causes, which may not be perceived, but are nevertheless hypotheses necessary to account for the facts.

40|$|Vaughan Williams was an {{extraordinary}} ordinary man and a very great composer who has reached during his lifetime the hearts {{of a very large}} section of his countrymen. Music was the mainspring of his being and he put all that he knew into his music. The essential importance of this composer consists in symphonic and song work. He is an author of nine symphonies, ballet, film music and five operas but the very best success reached he with his choral works. He <b>found</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> and inspiration in the music of his own land and has devoted a good deal of energy to the collecting and arranging of folksongs. The influence of that association on his work is obvious but it is egually evident that he is far from being merely an imitator of folksong. The accents of traditional melody appeal to him but his mode of expression is his own - it is wholly personal and it makes use of passing dissonance in a way which no study of folk melodies could possibly have suggested. He was a friend and admirer of romantics but showed distaste for several favourite romantic emotions. His style is half traditional half modern and that is why his music is understandable.
