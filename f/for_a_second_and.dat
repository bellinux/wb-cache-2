5|$|Numerous {{parasite}}s {{are known}} for this species, and both juveniles and adults often carry heavy parasite loads. Known internal parasites include the monogenean Squalonchocotyle spinacis, the tapeworms Aporhynchus norvegicus, Lacistorhynchus tenuis, and Phyllobothrium squali, and the nematodes Anisakis simplex and Hysterothylacium aduncum. Some of these parasites use the velvet belly's prey as intermediate hosts and are acquired via ingestion, while others use the shark itself as an intermediate host. The barnacle Anelasma squalicola, an external parasite, attaches to the shark's dorsal spine socket and penetrates deeply into the muscle, in the process often providing an attachment site <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> (<b>and</b> rarely a third) barnacle. Infestation by this barnacle reduces its host's fecundity by impairing {{the development of the}} reproductive organs.|$|E
5|$|Sajak {{hosted the}} daytime series until January 9, 1989, {{when he left}} to host a late-night talk show for CBS.

Benirschke's term as host came to an end due to NBC's cancellation of the daytime Wheel after fourteen years, with its final episode airing on June 30, 1989. When the newly formatted daytime series returned on CBS on July 17, 1989, Bob Goen became its host. The daytime program continued {{for a year and a}} half on CBS, then returned to NBC on January 14, 1991 and continued until September 20, 1991 when it was cancelled <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>and</b> final time.|$|E

5|$|Tropical Cyclone Hyacinthe was the wettest {{tropical}} cyclone on record worldwide. The eighth named storm of the season, Hyacinthe formed on January15, 1980, {{to the northeast}} of Mauritius in the southern Indian Ocean. Initially it moved to the west-southwest, and while slowly intensifying it passed north of the French overseas department of Réunion. On January19, Météo-France estimated that the storm had intensified to a {{tropical cyclone}}. Hyacinthe looped {{to the south of}} eastern Madagascar and weakened, although it restrengthened after turning to the east. The storm executed another loop to the southwest of Réunion, passing near the island <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>and</b> later third time.

25|$|Ostensibly due to {{injuries}} received during military service, Lugosi developed severe, chronic sciatica. Though {{at first}} he was treated with pain remedies such as asparagus juice, doctors increased the medication to opiates. The growth of his dependence on pain-killers, particularly morphine and, after 1947 when it became available in America, methadone, was directly proportional to the dwindling of screen offers. He was finally cast {{in the role of}} Frankenstein's monster for Universal's Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man (1943), but Lugosi had no dialogue. Lugosi's voice had been dubbed over that of Lon Chaney, Jr., from line readings at the end of The Ghost of Frankenstein (1942). Lugosi played Dracula <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>and</b> last time on film in Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein (1948).|$|E
25|$|After a {{brief period}} as Ambassador of Estonia to Finland, on 6 October 1992 he became the 2nd President of the Republic of Estonia. Meri was the {{candidate}} of the Pro Patria Union. Although, on the first ballot, Arnold Rüütel, a former leading communist and Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Council of the Estonian SSR, had led with 42 per cent of the total vote, the final choice for the nomination was made by Parliament, the Riigikogu, which was dominated by the Pro Patria Alliance. During the campaign, some of his opponents tried to bring up questions about Meri's alleged former links with the KGB. However, these allegations did not harm Meri's reputation and public image. Lennart Meri {{was sworn in as}} the President on 6 October 1992. On 20 September 1996, he was re-elected <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>and</b> final term.|$|E

25|$|On September 9, 1994, Shamrock {{returned}} to the octagon at UFC 3 in an event that was marketed by the UFC as the ultimate rematch between two-time champion Royce Gracie and #1 contender Shamrock. Shamrock's first fight, now allowed to wear his shoes, was against top ranked judo practitioner Christophe Leininger. Leininger engaged for a takedown, but Shamrock blocked and got on top, unloading hard punches and headbutts until the tap out. Shamrock crossed faced Leininger so hard into the mat that Leininger admitted to being knocked out <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>second,</b> <b>and</b> he later was revealed to have suffered a mild concussion. Shamrock's next fight was in the semifinals against kickboxer Felix Mitchell. Shamrock took Mitchell down and forced him to tap out due to a rear naked choke. With this win, Shamrock advanced to the finals of UFC 3. However, Shamrock refused {{to compete in the}} finals after he learned Gracie had dropped out of the tournament after his win over Kimo Leopoldo, combined with a knee injury he suffered during his match with Leininger.|$|E
25|$|Following the February 2000 encounter, Galileos {{mission at}} Jupiter was {{extended}} <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>and</b> final {{time with the}} Galileo Millennium Mission. The focus of this extended mission was joint observation of the Jovian system by both Galileo and Cassini, which performed a distant flyby of Jupiter en route to Saturn on December 30, 2000. Discoveries during the joint observations of Io revealed a new plume at Tvashtar and provided insights into Io's aurorae. Distant imaging by Galileo during the Cassini flyby revealed a new red ring plume deposit, {{similar to the one}} surrounding Pele, around Tvashtar, one of the first of this type seen in Io's polar regions, though Galileo would later observe a similar deposit around Dazhbog Patera in August 2001. Galileo performed three additional flybys of Io, on August 6 and October 16, 2001 and January 17, 2002, during the Galileo Millennium Mission. Both encounters in 2001 allowed Galileo to observe Io's polar regions up-close, though imaging from the August 2001 flyby was lost due to a camera malfunction. The data from the magnetometer confirmed that Io lacked an intrinsic magnetic field, though later analysis of this data in 2009 did reveal evidence for an induced magnetic field generated by the interaction between Jupiter's magnetosphere and a silicate magma ocean in Io's asthenosphere. During the August 2001 flyby, Galileo flew through the outer portions of the newly formed Thor volcanic plume, allowing for the first direct measurement of composition of Io's volcanic material. During the October 2001 encounter, Galileo imaged the new Thor eruption site, a major new lava flow at Gish Bar Patera, and the lava lake at Pele. Due to a safing event prior to the encounter, nearly all of the observations planned for the January 2002 flyby were lost.|$|E
