The new species was {{about the size of}} the extant Black-browed Albatross (Thalassarche melanophris) and establishes that albatrosses had already reached a large size 30 mya. The wing bones of T. septentrionalis are distinguished by several plesiomorphic features from those of species in crown group <b>Diomedeidae,</b> which may indicate differences in aerodynamic performance between the fossil species and extant albatrosses. We detail that a previously described early Miocene species, “Plotornis” arvernensis, should be expunged from the fossil record of albatrosses. However, the new fossils provide further evidence that the extant, mainly Southern Hemispheric, distribution of albatrosses is relictual compared with the past distribution of the total group (stem group + crown group).

40|$|The {{currently}} accepted albatross taxonomy, {{based on}} characters of external morphology, plumage patterns, tail shape, bill size and coloration, {{organization of the}} plates of the bill, and, more recently, molecular data such as cytochrome-b gene sequences, resulted in {{a division of the}} family <b>Diomedeidae</b> into four genera: Diomedea, comprising the great albatrosses; Phoebastria, the North Pacific albatrosses; Thalassarche, the mollymawks; and Phoebetria, the sooty mollymawks. However, there are only a few, old studies on albatross osteology, which focused mostly on supra-generic relationships. Research on the group's taxonomy and anatomy is important in order to establish a secure basis for the identification of each species, including the differences between males, females and specimens of different ages, and also to verify anatomic characters which might be found useful for phylogenetic analysis based on morphological markers. In the present study, 63 skulls of Diomedea and Thalassarche albatrosses were analyzed and compared, thus establishing topographic correspondences and determining primary homologies, these resulting in: (a) the finding of no pattern of anatomical variation related to sex and age for both T. melanophris and for T. chlororhynchos; (b) the assessment of eight cranial landmarks separating the genera Diomedea and Thalassarche; (c) the recognition of 13 cranial landmarks differing among T. melanophris, T. chlororhynchos and T. cauta; (d) the re-identification of several specimens based on skull characters.

40|$|New {{specimens}} of the procellariiform taxon Diomedeoididae are reported {{from the early}} Oligocene (Rupelian) deposits of Wiesloch-Frauenweiler in southern Germany. Two skeletons belong to Diomedeoides brodkorbi, whereas isolated legs of larger individuals are tentatively assigned to D. lipsiensis, a species which {{has not yet been}} reported from the locality. The fossils allow the recognition of some previously unknown osteological features of the Diomedeoididae, including the presence of a vestige of the hallux. Diomedeoidids are characterized by extremely wide phalanges of the third and fourth toes, which also occur in some species of the extant procellariiform Oceanitinae (southern storm-petrels). The poorly developed processus supracondylaris dorsalis of the humerus supports a position of these Oligocene tubenoses outside a clade including the <b>Diomedeidae</b> (albatrosses), Procellariidae (shearwaters and allies), and Pelecanoididae (diving-petrels). It is hypothesized that like modern Oceanitinae, which have an equally short supracondylar process, diomedeoidids probably employed flap-gliding and used their immersed feet to remain stationary. doi: 10. 1002 /mmng. 200900003 </a...|$|E

40|$|Moult entails costs {{related to}} the {{acquisition}} of energy and nutrients necessary for feather synthesis, {{as well as the}} impact of reduced flight performance induced by gaps in the wing plumage. Variation in moult strategies within and between populations may convey valuable information on energetic trade-offs and other responses to differing environmental constraints. We studied the moult strategies of two populations of a pelagic seabird, the black-browed albatross Thalassarche melanophris, nesting in contrasting environments. According to conventional wisdom, it is exceptional for albatrosses (<b>Diomedeidae)</b> to moult while breeding. Here we show that black-browed albatrosses breeding on the Falklands regularly moult primaries, tail and body feathers during chick-rearing, and the majority of those at South Georgia show some body feather moult in late chick-rearing. The greater moult-breeding overlap at the Falklands allows the birds to annually renew more primary feathers than their counterparts at South Georgia. The results of the present paper, pooled with other evidence, suggest that black-browed albatrosses from South Georgia face a more challenging environment during reproduction. They also serve to warn against the uncritical acceptance of conventional ideas about moult patterns when using feathers to study the ecology of seabirds and other migrants for which there is scant information at particular stages of the annual cycle...|$|E
40|$|Albatrosses (<b>Diomedeidae)</b> do {{not occur}} in the North Atlantic Ocean today except as vagrants, {{although}} five species {{were present in the}} early Pliocene. No fossil breeding sites of albatrosses were known previously. The timing of extinction of albatrosses in the North Atlantic was likewise unknown. Deposits that formed near present-day sea level along the southeastern shore of Bermuda contain remains of a former breeding colony and include intact eggshells and bones of embryos, juveniles, and adults of Short-tailed Albatross (Phoebastria albatrus), a critically endangered species now confined to a few islets in the northwestern Pacific Ocean. These deposits are correlated with the middle Pleistocene Lower Town Hill Formation, which at other sites have a radiometric age of ≈ 405, 000 years ago. This equates with the marine isotope stage 11 interglacial, which culminated in a rise in sea-level to >+ 20 m. Bones of a juvenile Short-tailed Albatross were also found in beach deposits at + 21. 3 m from this same interglacial.

40|$|Anterior eye {{structure}} and retinal visual fields were determined in grey–headed and black–browed albatrosses, Diomedea melanophris and D. chrysostoma (Procellariiformes, <b>Diomedeidae),</b> using keratometry and an ophthalmoscopic reflex technique. Results {{for the two}} species were very similar and indicate that the eyes are of an amphibious optical design suggesting that albatross vision is well suited to the visual pursuit of active prey both on and below the ocean surface. The corneas are relatively flat (radius ca. 14. 5 mm) and hence of low absolute refractive power (ca. 23 dioptres). In air the binocular fields are relatively long (vertical extent ca. 70 °) and narrow (maximum width in {{the plane of the}} optic axes 26 – 32 °), a topography found in a range of bird species that employ visual guidance of bill position when foraging. The cyclopean fields measure approximately 270 ° in the horizontal plane, but there is a 60 ° blind sector above the head owing to the positioning of the eyes below the protruding supraorbital ridges.

40|$|We {{describe}} well-preserved {{remains of}} the Pelagornithidae (bony-toothed birds) from the middle Eocene of Belgium, including a sternum, pectoral girdle bones and humeri of a single individual. The specimens are tentatively assigned to Macrodontopteryx oweni Harrison and Walker, 1976, which has so far only been known from the holotype skull and a referred proximal ulna. Another species, about two times larger, is represented by an incomplete humerus and tentatively identified as Dasornis emuinus (Bowerbank, 1854). The fossils provide critical new data on the osteology of the pectoral girdle of bony-toothed birds. For the first time, the sternum {{of one of the}} smaller species is preserved, and this bone exhibits a more plesiomorphic morphology than the recently described sternum of the giant Miocene taxon Pelagornis. The coracoid resembles that of the <b>Diomedeidae</b> (albatrosses) in overall morphology, but because bony-toothed birds lack apomorphies of the Procellariiformes, the similarities are almost certainly owing to convergence. Bony-toothed birds were often compared with the ‘Pelecaniformes’ by previous authors, who especially made comparisons with the Sulidae (gannets and boobies). However, the coracoid distinctly differs from that of extant ‘pelecaniform’ birds, and the plesiomorphic presence of a foramen nervi supracoracoidei as well as the absence of a well-delimited articulation facet for the furcula supports a position outside the Suloidea, the clade to which the Sulidae belong...|$|E
40|$|International audienceSeabirds are {{amongst the}} most globally-threatened of all groups of birds, and {{conservation}} issues specific to albatrosses (<b>Diomedeidae)</b> and large petrels (Procellaria spp. and giant petrels Macronectes spp.) led to drafting of the multi-lateral Agreement on the Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels (ACAP). Here we review the taxonomy, breeding and foraging distributions, population status and trends, threats and {{priorities for the}} 29 species covered by ACAP. Nineteen (66 %) are listed as threatened by IUCN, and 11 (38 %) are declining. Most have extensive at-sea distributions, and the greatest threat is incidental mortality (bycatch) in industrial pelagic or demersal longline, trawl or artisanal fisheries, often in both national and international waters. Mitigation measures are available that reduce bycatch in most types of fisheries, but some management bodies are yet to make these mandatory, levels of implementation and monitoring of compliance are often inadequate, and there are insufficient observer programmes collecting robust data on bycatch rates. Intentional take, pollution (including plastic ingestion), and threats at colonies affect fewer species than bycatch; however, the impacts of disease (mainly avian cholera) and of predation by introduced species, including feral cats (Felis catus), rats (Rattus spp.) and house mice (Mus musculus), are severe for some breeding populations. Although major {{progress has been made}} in recent years in reducing bycatch rates and in controlling or eradicating pests at breeding sites, unless conservation efforts are intensified, the future prospects of many species of albatrosses and large petrels will remain bleak...|$|E
