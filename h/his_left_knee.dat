5|$|After {{missing the}} Tournament of Americas Olympic Qualifiers over the summer, Miami's eight {{pre-season}} games and first seven regular season games {{to recover from}} off-season left knee and left shoulder surgeries, Wade made his first appearance of the 2007–08 season on November 14, 2007. Battling pain in <b>his</b> <b>left</b> <b>knee</b> throughout the season, Wade was elected to his fourth consecutive All-Star Game appearance. However, with the Heat holding the worst record in the NBA and Wade still experiencing problems in <b>his</b> <b>left</b> <b>knee,</b> Heat coach Pat Riley announced Wade would miss the final 21 {{games of the season}} to undergo OssaTron treatment on <b>his</b> <b>left</b> <b>knee.</b> Wade averaged 24.6 points, 6.9 assists, 4.2 rebounds, and 1.7 steals per game for the season.|$|E
5|$|Similar to the {{previous}} season, Portland was overcome with injuries {{from the start of}} the 2010–11 season. Jeff Pendergraph and rookie guard Elliot Williams both suffered knee injuries that sidelined them for the season; Portland later waived Pendergraph. In November, they announced that Oden would have microfracture surgery on <b>his</b> <b>left</b> <b>knee,</b> ending his 2010–2011 season. This injury marked Oden's third NBA season cut short due to a knee injury. Three-time All-Star Brandon Roy underwent double-arthroscopic surgery on January 17, 2011, to repair both knees after dealing with constant struggles, leaving his future up in the air. Just days after, Marcus Camby also underwent arthroscopic knee surgery to repair <b>his</b> <b>left</b> <b>knee.</b>|$|E
5|$|On February 9, 2017, Parker {{was ruled}} {{out for the}} rest of the 2016–17 season after an MRI {{revealed}} a torn anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in <b>his</b> <b>left</b> <b>knee.</b> The recovery and rehabilitation period is estimated at 12 months. It was his second ACL tear in the same knee, the first having occurred in December 2014.|$|E
50|$|In Week 3 of the 2013 season, Kerrigan tore <b>his</b> <b>left</b> <b>knee's</b> lateral meniscus. Despite the injury, {{he started}} every game and tied his career-high in quarterback sacks and forced fumbles.|$|R

Flamengo's doctors estimated {{that he will be}} out of action for six months.|$|R
50|$|The next season, he {{experienced}} swelling in <b>his</b> repaired <b>left</b> <b>knee,</b> which set {{him back in}} training camp and was waived on August 30, 2013, before being re-signed to the practice squad. On September 16, 2013, he was waived {{to make room for}} Jamar Newsome.|$|R

5|$|In 1967–68, {{his second}} season, {{injuries}} limited Orr to just 46 {{games in which}} he scored 11 goals and had 20 assists. Prior to the season, Orr had injured his right knee during a charity game in Winnipeg during the summer requiring five weeks in a cast. In December, a Frank Mahovlich check caused a fracture of Orr's collar bone and a shoulder separation. Orr returned in January in time {{to play in the}} NHL All-Star Game, his first of eight appearances overall. Orr had to sit out five games afterwards due to soreness in <b>his</b> <b>left</b> <b>knee.</b> In February, he had to leave a game against Detroit after <b>his</b> <b>left</b> <b>knee</b> went stiff. He would receive the first of his many operations on the knee, repairing ligament and removing cartilage. Orr did return to finish the season, but required an operation during the off-season to remove a bone chip. Despite the injuries, Orr won the first of a record eight consecutive Norris trophies and was named to the NHL's First All-Star team and finished fourth in the voting for the Hart Trophy.|$|E

50|$|Burciaga tore <b>his</b> <b>left</b> <b>knee's</b> ACL in preseason, {{and missed}} the entire 2002 season rehabbing the injury. He came on strong in 2003, earning the left back {{starting}} position in preseason, and looked poised to finally come into his own; he tore his right knee's ACL in the fourth game of the season, and so finished the year with only those four starts. After two painful years, Burciaga returned to the Wizards' lineup in 2004, and was injury-free for the entire year. Given the opportunity he seized the left back position, and kept it all year long. He finished the season with 21 starts out of 24 games played, and added one goal and one assist.|$|R

Early in the season, Wade became the second player in NBA history to tally at least 40 points, 10 assists and five blocked shots in a game since Alvan Adams did so in the 1976–77 season. With a healthy Wade leading the league in scoring and the Heat making a push for a playoff position, Wade was elected to his fifth consecutive All-Star game appearance.|$|E
5|$|In 1966, Orr joined Boston, a {{team that}} had not won a Stanley Cup since 1941 and had not {{qualified}} for the playoffs since 1959. With Orr, the Bruins won the Stanley Cup twice, in 1970 and 1972, and lost in the 1974 Final. In both victories, Orr scored the clinching goal and was named the playoff MVP. In the final achievement of his career, he was the MVP of the 1976 Canada Cup international hockey tournament. In 1976, Orr left Boston {{as a free agent}} to join the Black Hawks, but repeated injuries had effectively destroyed <b>his</b> <b>left</b> <b>knee,</b> and he retired in 1978 at age 30.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the start}} of the 2011–12 season, Öhlund began {{experiencing}} inflammation in his right knee. The Lightning placed him on injured reserve on October 4, 2011; a week later, he underwent arthroscopic surgery on both knees.

5|$|After the 1992 season, Tolliver was a {{restricted}} free agent. Wilson {{signed a contract}} with the Saints, and to replace him the Falcons signed Bobby Hebert. Tolliver signed a one-year contract in August, after holding out for a time. Tolliver started the 1993 season as the third-string quarterback behind Hebert and Miller. However, Miller re-injured <b>his</b> <b>left</b> <b>knee</b> in late September, making Tolliver the main backup to Hebert. Tolliver made his first start against the Los Angeles Rams, but was injured in his second start against the Saints; the Falcons signed Chris Hakel {{as a result of the}} injury. Tolliver finished the season in occasional relief for Hebert, who remained bothered by injuries. Over the course of the year, Tolliver played in seven games and threw for just under 500 yards, and became a free agent after the season ended.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of 2001–02 season, Baggio scored eight goals {{in the first nine}} matches, leading him {{to the top of the}} Serie A goalscoring table. In his eighth league {{appearance}} of the season, against Piacenza, Baggio scored a goal but later suffered an injury. A week later, against Venezia, he scored from a penalty, but he endured a more serious injury following a hard challenge which caused him to tear the ACL of <b>his</b> <b>left</b> <b>knee,</b> keeping him out of action for four months. He suffered a second serious injury that season, tearing the meniscus in <b>his</b> <b>left</b> <b>knee,</b> after returning to the team, and coming off the bench, in the Coppa Italia semi-final against Parma on 31 January 2002. He was operated on 4 February 2002 and he returned for three matches before the end of the season, making a recovery in 76 days. On 21 April 2002, in the first game after his comeback, Baggio came on as a substitute to score two goals against Fiorentina, helping Brescia win the match. He scored again against Bologna, saving Brescia from relegation on the final matchday, and bringing his seasonal tally to 11 goals in 12 Serie A matches. Despite Baggio's performances, Italy national team head coach Giovanni Trapattoni did not deem him fully fit, prompting Trapattoni to leave Baggio out of the final squad for the 2002 World Cup. Trapattoni also expressed concern about bringing Baggio to the World Cup due to the presence of Francesco Totti and Alessandro Del Piero in his role, believing that this could create a rivalry between the players. After missing out on the tournament, Baggio reversed his initial decision to retire after the World Cup, expressing his intention to surpass the 200 Serie A goal mark.|$|E
5|$|Bure {{suffered}} another {{knee injury}} in the 2002–03 pre-season; combined with a case of strep throat, he missed the first three games of the regular season.

After undergoing surgery 10 days later, it was revealed that there was no damage to the ACL as previously feared, but instead a tear to the meniscus in <b>his</b> <b>left</b> <b>knee,</b> which was repaired. Bure returned that season to appear in 39 games, managing 19 goals and 30 points.|$|E
