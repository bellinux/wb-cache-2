I never saw a girl like her before. <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> there were girls like her.|$|E

5000|$|OK! magazine's Valerie Nome {{addressed}} the issue with Rosie in a May 24, 2011 article. Asking her whether little kids have ever questioned her voice, Rosie replied with a laugh that [...] "Little kids {{have never had a}} problem understanding me, I have to say. I think it’s funny. <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that’s</b> what people were going to get upset about. ‘Speech impediment, lisp, what is she talking about?’ As far as I know, there’s nothing wrong with my tongue - however I think it’s hilarious that people are talking about it.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>knew</b> before <b>that</b> Mr. Stubbs had any relations!" [...] said Toby, {{looking around}} with joy {{imprinted}} on every feature. [...] "Do {{you know where}} {{the rest of the family}} is, Ben?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "It's just so. You {{care more}} for your old missionary work, now, {{than you do}} for me. I'm sure <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> I'd married a home-missionary." ...|$|E
6000|$|MRS. GWYN. Only ninety {{pounds a}} year, besides your pension! D' {{you mean to}} say that's all you've got, Uncle Tom? <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> before. What a shame! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't say he's so bad as that," [...] {{said the}} host, {{committing}} March to her. [...] "He came to New York because he couldn't help it--like {{the rest of}} us. <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>know</b> whether <b>that's</b> a compliment to New York or not." ...|$|R
60|$|But for my quick tongue <b>I</b> should <b>never</b> have <b>known</b> <b>that</b> he {{realized}} fully all my folly.|$|R

6000|$|... "Why, {{where did}} you learn that?" [...] said Jasper, [...] "I thought I knowed a-most {{everything}} about the Company; but I must confess <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> about Prince Rupert before." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'No! You {{surprise}} me!' cried Tigg. 'That's {{the cream}} of the thing sir. <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> man fail to redeem a promise, in my life. You're not in want of change, are you?' ...|$|E

5000|$|In 2013, Gilliam commented, [...] "I {{was told}} after Kubrick died—by {{someone who had}} been dealing with him—that he had been {{interested}} in trying to do another Strangelove with me directing. <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>knew</b> about <b>that</b> until after he died but I would have loved to." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The idiot!" [...] {{said her}} Ladyship, {{thinking}} of Mr. Tollmidge, [...] "I {{never even heard}} of him, in my husband's lifetime; <b>I</b> <b>never</b> even <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> he was really related to Lord Lydiard, till I found his letters. What is to be done next?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'Dear me,' said Mellish. 'Now <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> before, Blaize. Remarkable. But this {{ought to}} be seen to. In the meantime, I had better ask the Headmaster to give out that the Museum is closed until further notice, I think.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What! the {{well-known}} sick-nurse? You {{could not possibly}} have a better recommendation, child.

60|$|EDSTASTON. I {{know nothing}} about her Majesty's {{eminence}} in policy or philosophy: I don't pretend to understand such things. I speak as a practical man. And <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> foreigners had any policy: I always thought that policy was Mr. Pitt's business.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I never tasted {{anything}} so good as those rock-codlings we took from Padda's mouth and half roasted over the fire.

6000|$|LARRY. [In a smothered voice] Dead, Keith. <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>knew</b> till {{afterwards}} <b>that</b> she {{was hanging}} on to him--to h-help me. [Again he wrings his hands.] ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{had an idea}} I'd like Bond Street all {{the better}} when I got back. <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> I should be eaten alive by every kind of disgusting animal by night and day. I say, Doctor, {{do you ever think}} of a rump steak? ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'The {{curse of}} our house,' {{said the old}} man, looking kindly down upon her, 'has been the love of self; has ever been the love of self. How often have I said so, when <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> I had wrought it upon others.' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "No, {{though the}} poor thing came back in a bad way. <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>knew</b> before <b>that</b> a pug's tail was so long when it is quite uncurled.

5000|$|Dobbyn {{has noted}} the {{adoption}} of [...] "Loyal" [...] into the wider New Zealand psyche: [...] It's now got {{a life of its}} own. <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>knew</b> what <b>that</b> meant - New Zealand musician Neil Finnis always on about songs becoming everybody else's - and <b>I</b> <b>never</b> really felt that until that song. Dave Dobbyn ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] he said, [...] "you will <b>never</b> <b>know</b> <b>that.</b> Perhaps <b>I</b> myself shall <b>never</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> really again. Get me {{a whiskey}} and soda, Maud. I want a drink." ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{examination}} of presents at last ended, {{and the two}} families parted for the night. When they were alone, Mrs. Garland said to Anne, 'What a close girl you are! I am sure <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> Bob Loveday and you had walked together: {{you must have been}} mere children.' ...|$|E
6000|$|It's {{easy enough}} to command one's face. I learnt {{to do that in}} Africa when often my life {{depended}} on my seeming to have no fear. But in my heart ... <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> I could feel so bitter. And yet, after all, it's only your good opinion that I care for.|$|E
6000|$|He {{refused to}} take it. [...] "The wrong you have done me {{is not to be}} set right in that way," [...] he said.
