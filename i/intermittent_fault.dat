40|$|Future {{multicore}} processors will be {{more susceptible}} {{to a variety of}} hardware failures. In particular, <b>intermittent</b> <b>faults,</b> caused in part by manufacturing, thermal, and voltage variations, can cause bursts of frequent faults that last from several cycles to several seconds or more. Due to practical limitations of circuit techniques, costeffective reliability will likely require the ability to temporarily suspend execution on a core during periods of <b>intermittent</b> <b>faults.</b> We investigate three of the most obvious techniques for adapting to the dynamically changing resource availability caused by <b>intermittent</b> <b>faults,</b> and demonstrate their different system-level implications. We show that system software reconfiguration has very high overhead, that temporarily pausing execution on a faulty core can lead to cascading livelock, and that using spare cores has high faultfree cost. To remedy these and other drawbacks of the three baseline techniques, we propose using a thin hardware/firmware layer to manage an overcommitted system — one where the OS is configured to use more virtual processors than the number of currently available physical cores.

40|$|Abstract—As CMOS {{technology}} scales {{into the}} nanometer era, future shipped microprocessors {{will be increasingly}} vulnerable to intermittent faults. Quantitatively characterizing the vulnerability of microprocessor structures to intermittent faults at an early design stage is significantly helpful in balancing system reliability and performance. Prior researches have proposed several met-rics to analyze the vulnerability of microprocessor structures to soft errors and hard faults, however, the vulnerability of these structures to intermittent faults is rarely considered yet. In this work, we propose a metric intermittent vulnerability factor (IVF) to characterize the vulnerability of microprocessor structures to intermittent faults. A structure’s IVF is the probability an <b>intermittent</b> <b>fault</b> in that structure causes an external visible error (failure). We compute IVFs for reorder buffer and register file considering three <b>intermittent</b> <b>fault</b> models: intermittent stuck-at- 1 and stuck-at- 0 fault model, intermittent open and short fault model, and intermittent timing fault model. Experimental results show that, among {{the three types of}} intermittent faults, intermittent stuck-at- 1 faults have the most serious impact on pro-gram execution. Besides, IVF varies significantly across individual structures and programs, which implies partial protection to the most vulnerable structures and program phases for minimizing performance and/or energy overheads.

40|$|Abstract: Intermittent faults are {{completely}} missed out by traditional monitoring and detection techniques due to non-stationary nature of signals. These are the incipient events of a precursor of permanent faults to come. Intermittent faults in electrical interconnection are short duration transients {{which could be}} detected by some specific techniques but these do not provide enough information to understand {{the root cause of}} it. Due to random and non-predictable nature, the intermittent faults are the most frustrating, elusive, and expensive faults to detect in interconnection system. The novel approach of the author injects a fixed frequency sinusoidal signal into electronics interconnection system that modulates <b>intermittent</b> <b>fault</b> if persist. Intermittent faults and other channel effects are computed from received signal by demodulation and spectrum analysis. This paper describes technology for <b>intermittent</b> <b>fault</b> detection, and classification of <b>intermittent</b> <b>fault,</b> and channel characterization. The paper also reports the functionally tests of computational system of the proposed methods. This algorithm has been tested using experimental setup. It generate an intermittent signal by external vibration stress on connector and intermittency is detected by acquiring and processing propagating signal. The results demonstrate to detect and classify intermittent interconnection and noise variations due to intermittency. Monitoring the channel in-situ with low amplitude, and narrow band signal over electronics interconnection between a transmitter and a receiver provides the most effective tool for continuously watching the wire system for the random, unpredictable intermittent faults, the precursor of failure. - See more at: [URL]...|$|E
