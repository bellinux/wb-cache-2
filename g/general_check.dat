50|$|A {{portmanteau}} test {{is a type}} {{of statistical}} hypothesis test in which the null hypothesis is well specified, but the alternative hypothesis is more loosely specified. Tests constructed in this context can have the property of being at least moderately powerful against a wide range of departures from the null hypothesis. Thus, in applied statistics, a portmanteau test provides a reasonable way of proceeding as a <b>general</b> <b>check</b> of a model's match to a dataset where there are many different ways in which the model may depart from the underlying data generating process. Use of such tests avoids having to be very specific about the particular type of departure being tested.|$|E

40|$|Patients with {{obsessive-compulsive}} disorder (OCD) not only respond to obsessions with perseverative checking, but also engage in more <b>general</b> <b>checking,</b> irrespective of their obsessive concerns. This study investigated whether <b>general</b> <b>checking</b> is specific to OCD and exacerbated when only mild uncertainty is induced. Thirty-one patients with OCD, 26 anxiety- and 31 healthy controls performed a visual search task with eye-tracking and indicated in 50 search displays whether a target was "present" or "absent". Target-present trials were unambiguous, whereas target-absent trials induced mild uncertainty, because participants {{had to rely}} on not overlooking the target. Checking behavior was measured by assessing search time and the number of fixations, measured with an eye-tracker. Results showed that in both target-present and target-absent trials patients with OCD searched longer and made more fixations than healthy and anxiety controls. However, the difference in checking behavior between patients with OCD and the control groups was larger in target-absent trials (where mild uncertainty was induced). Anxiety and healthy controls did not differ in checking behavior. Thus, mild uncertainty appears to specifically promote checking in patients with OCD, which has implications for treatment...|$|R

40|$|The {{concept of}} the autoregressive (AR) sieve {{bootstrap}} is investigated for the case of spatial processes in Z 2. This procedure fits AR models of increasing order to the given data and, via resampling of the residuals, generates bootstrap replicates of the sample. The paper explores the range of validity of this resampling procedure and provides a <b>general</b> <b>check</b> criterion which allows {{to decide whether the}} AR sieve bootstrap asymptotically works for a specific statistic of interest or not. The criterion may be applied to a large class of stationary spatial processes. As another major contribution of this paper, a weighted Baxter-inequality for spatial processes is provided. This result yields a rate of convergence for the finite predictor coefficients, i. e. the coefficients of finite-order AR model fits, towards the autoregressive coefficients which are inherent to the underlying process under mild conditions. The developed check criterion is applied to some particularly interesting statistics like sample autocorrelations and standardized sample variograms. A simulation study shows that the procedure performs very well compared to normal approximations as well as block bootstrap methods in finite samples...|$|E

To ensure its function, {{it is very important to}} know how Indonesian primary care providers are meeting minimal standards of performance based on key health indicators.

The program plan will include an extensive literature review and comprehensive review of PCAT tool’s content, possible utility and ease of use so it will be more readily accepted and widely used by Indonesian primary care physicians.

These data offer a huge potential, in terms of enabling researches to study energy demand in buildings and related causalities. However, revisions of the national schemes and calculation methods necessitate a standardization of {{the results from the}} various schemes. The primary focus of this research is on checking the consistency of converting labels with a given classification from an old scheme directly into that of a newer scheme. Furthermore, a <b>general</b> <b>check</b> is carried out, to review the consistency within each scheme, since the collected data are handled by several stakeholders which use different calculation tools. In the study, several instances were found, where a simple conversion of a building's energy label classification did not agree with the classification calculated anew, according to the present scheme. The number of inconsistent records was found to vary from scheme to scheme; most of the inconsistent classifications were found in the early schemes however. Fortunately, most information is stored at a disaggregated level, which means that classifications can easily be recalculated. In addition to the inconsistent EPC classifications, a number of corrupt records were observed, in which the energy frame did not seem to agree with the calculated energy demand for heating and electricity...|$|E
