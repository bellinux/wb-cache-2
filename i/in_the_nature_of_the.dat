5|$|Napoleon's set {{of civil}} laws, the Code Civil—now often {{known as the}} Napoleonic Code—was {{prepared}} by committees of legal experts {{under the supervision of}} Jean Jacques Régis de Cambacérès, the Second Consul. Napoleon participated actively in the sessions of the Council of State that revised the drafts. The development of the code was a fundamental change <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> civil law legal system with its stress on clearly written and accessible law. Other codes ("Les cinq codes") were commissioned by Napoleon to codify criminal and commerce law; a Code of Criminal Instruction was published, which enacted rules of due process.|$|E
5|$|There {{are four}} {{different}} general schemes in which diffusion may take place. Tracer diffusion and chemical diffusion {{differ in the}} level of adsorbate coverage at the surface, while intrinsic diffusion and mass transfer diffusion differ <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> diffusion environment. Tracer diffusion and intrinsic diffusion both refer to systems where adparticles experience a relatively homogeneous environment, whereas in chemical and mass transfer diffusion adparticles are more strongly affected by their surroundings.|$|E
5|$|There is {{no reason}} why the writ of error should be {{confined}} to civil cases. A man's life, his liberty, and his good name, are as dear to him as his property; and inferior courts are as liable to err in one case as in the other. There is nothing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cases which should make a difference; nor is it a novel doctrine that a writ of error should lie in a criminal case. They have been frequent in that country from which we have drawn almost all our forms of judicial proceedings.|$|E

40|$|The BSG, {{established}} as <b>the</b> BGRG <b>in</b> 1960, is considering {{how best to}} represent geomorphology and geomorphologists <b>in</b> <b>the</b> light <b>of</b> recent changes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> communication. These changes provide the BSG and other academic societies with challenges and opportunities. Seven drivers of change are outlined: the changing position of geomorphology <b>in</b> higher education, <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> academic interaction, <b>the</b> means of communication available, a transformation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> geomorphological research, changes <b>in</b> funding support, <b>the</b> government role <b>in</b> resource allocation, and developments in quantifying international research impact.

25|$|Armstrong rejects dispositionalism, {{the idea}} that dispositional {{properties}} (or powers as they are sometimes referred to) are ontologically significant and {{have an important role}} in explaining laws of nature. Armstrong believes that the challenge that dispositionalism presents for his account of laws of nature is not in the case of manifested dispositions (say, a glass dropping on the ground and breaking) but unmanifested dispositions (the fact that counter factually if one were to drop the glass on the ground, it would break). Armstrong simply states that the disposition is simply <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> instantiated properties of the thing which is supposed to have the disposition.|$|E
25|$|As {{with most}} cycling races, weather {{conditions}} {{have a significant}} influence <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> day's race. In bad weather conditions, the race is often a grueling contest and the peloton is thinned out in the early parts of the race. In modern times, the edition of 1985 was hit by exceptionally stormy weather and only saw 24 finishers. When weather conditions are good, the teams of race favourites can control the race more easily and more riders are {{able to keep up}} with the pace. As the weather in April is highly unpredictable in Flanders, the race has repeatedly been affected by rough weather conditions.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 14th and 15th centuries the Carmelites, like {{a number of}} other {{religious}} orders, declined and reform became imperative. In 1432 the Carmelites obtained from Pope Eugenius IV the bull Romani pontificis, which mitigated the Rule of St Albert and the 1247 modification, on the ground that the original demanded too much of the friars. The main clauses modified concerned fasting and remaining within individual cells: the bull allowed them to eat meat three days a week and to perambulate in the cloisters of their convents. This reform brought the Carmelites closer into line with other mendicant orders, but it was also the source of much subsequent tension, as others refused to accept this change <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Order, seeing it as a loss of Carmel's original vision and spirit.|$|E

25|$|Taxicab {{geometry}} {{can be used}} {{to assess}} the differences in discrete frequency distributions. For example, in RNA splicing positional distributions of hexamers, which plot the probability of each hexamer appearing at each given nucleotide near a splice site, can be compared with L1-distance. Each position distribution can be represented as a vector where each entry represents the likelihood of the hexamer starting at a certain nucleotide. A large L1-distance between the two vectors indicates a significant difference <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> distributions while a small distance denotes similarly shaped distributions. This is equivalent to measuring the area between the two distribution curves because the area of each segment is the absolute difference between the two curves' likelihoods at that point. When summed together for all segments, it provides the same measure as L1-distance.|$|E
25|$|Another factor {{important}} to consider {{in the understanding of}} the fishery's collapse is the uncertainty inherent in the assessment of the cod as a resource. Management of a resource is an extremely complex task, with a multitude of interests, perspectives, and sources of information to take into account; when knowledge regarding the resource is limited, or clouded by imprecision, the task of managing it becomes even more difficult. The management of fisheries are associated with an especially high degree of uncertainty due to problems inherent <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> resource. Newfoundland's cod fisheries were no exception: an imperfect understanding of the ocean ecosystem; technical and environmental challenges associated with observation techniques, which led to incomplete data on the resource (the cod); and the naturally high levels of variability in the population due to dynamic environmental factors (such as ocean temperature) combined to make the discernment of the effects of exploitation an arduous task. Unfortunately, this led to predictions about the condition and future of the cod stock that were mired in uncertainty, making it more difficult for the government to choose the appropriate course of action.|$|E

500|$|Endgames {{with one}} or more pawns {{increase}} the complexity because the symmetry argument is reduced. Since pawns can move forward but not sideways, rotation and vertical reflection of the board produces a fundamental change <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> position. The best calculation of symmetry is achieved by limiting one pawn to 24 squares in the rectangle a2-a7-d7-d2. [...] All other pieces and pawns may be located in any of the 64 squares with respect to the pawn. [...] Thus, an endgame with pawns has a complexity of 24/10 = 2.4 times a pawnless endgame with the same number of pieces.|$|E
500|$|The overall {{stature of}} the fruit bodies of P.pelliculosa is {{generally}} {{similar to those of}} Mycena, Galerina, or Hypholoma. Smith noted a superficial resemblance to Psathyrella fagicola, based on similarities <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cap cuticle, the coloring, and the stem base covered in silky fibers. Psilocybe pelliculosa may be distinguished from Psathyra fagicola by the presence of a partial veil, firm gills, and smaller fruit bodies. P.pelliculosa is frequently mistaken for the widespread P.semilanceata, but the latter can be distinguished by its larger spores and a conical, papillate cap. Another similar species is Psilocybe silvatica, and a microscope is needed to reliably distinguish between the two species. P.silvatica, found from New York to Michigan and north to Canada, has longer spores. [...] P.pelliculosa has a general resemblance to Hypholoma dispersum, a species found in northern North America and Europe.|$|E
500|$|The {{species was}} {{originally}} collected for science purposes by the American botanist Charles Wright during the North Pacific Exploring and Surveying Expedition of 1853–56. The single collection was found growing on fallen oak leaves at Mare Island Naval Shipyard, in Solano County, California in January 1856. The specimen {{was sent by}} American mycologist Moses Ashley Curtis to his British colleague Miles Joseph Berkeley, who published {{a brief description of}} the species in 1860, calling it Agaricus californiensis, in what was then the subgenus Mycena. Berkeley and Curtis noted that it differed from A.aurantio-marginatus (known today as Mycena aurantiomarginata) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gills, and they called it [...] "a more graceful species." [...] In his 1887 Sylloge Fungorum, Pier Andrea Saccardo raised the subgenus Mycena to generic status, so the species became known as Mycena californiensis.|$|E
