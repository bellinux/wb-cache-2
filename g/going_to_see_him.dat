500|$|I {{remember}} once <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> {{when he was}} ill at Putney. I {{had ridden}} in taxi cab number 1729 and remarked that the number seemed to me rather a dull one, and that I hoped {{it was not an}} unfavorable omen. [...] "No", he replied, [...] "it is a very interesting number; it is the smallest number expressible as the sum of two cubes in two different ways." ...|$|E
500|$|Tharin Gartrell {{was sentenced}} to 15 days in prison and six months in a halfway house for a charge of {{possessing}} methamphetamine on January 29, 2009. During his sentencing, District Judge Robert E. Blackburn said, [...] "Frankly, Mr. Gartrell, it's time you grew up." [...] Phil Ewing, Gartrell's best friend, said at the hearing that the entire case was a misunderstanding and said, [...] "Now people are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> as a racist, {{and that is not}} him." [...] Gartrell was released from federal custody on June 12, 2009.|$|E
500|$|While {{playing for}} the Chicago Cubs, Barrett was {{involved}} in two incidents with Houston Astros pitcher Roy Oswalt during the 2004 season. On August 22, 2004, Oswalt struck Barrett. Barrett, believing the pitch was a reaction to a three-run home run that Aramis Ramírez had previously hit, confronted Oswalt, and prompted both teams to take the field. Oswalt was ejected from the game, as the Astros went on to lose 11-6. Five days later, during another Cubs-Astros game, Barrett mouthed off to Oswalt and attempted to confront him. The game's umpires restrained the two before a fight could break out, but not before both benches cleared out. Oswalt remained in the game, and defeated the Cubs 15-7. In a post-game press conference, Barrett condemned Oswalt's actions, and stated, [...] "We're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> again." ...|$|E

6000|$|The ranger had {{a clearer}} vision {{of his own}} as well as Helen's {{situation}} as he replied: [...] "Well, I'm <b>going</b> over <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>him.</b> When {{it comes to a}} show-down he's on my side, for he needs the witnesses I've brought him." ...|$|R
500|$|Boon {{said that}} there was a focus on {{including}} characters from the first three Mortal Kombat games and that [...] "if you have a favorite character from those games, you're probably <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> or her in the game." [...] The game's developers stated that the characters had been designed with the intent to make each character unique – each having his or her own individual stance, victory pose and Fatality with no shared animations. Lead designer John Edwards said that characters are differentiated by features such as power and speed. Producer Shaun Himmerick said that the internal and external character design required [...] "two months or ten weeks". Boon said that an exclusive character was planned for the Xbox 360 version, but [...] "unfortunately, the circumstances didn't allow us to make a 360 exclusive." [...] Ed Boon mentioned that Marcus Fenix of the Gears of War franchise was considered for the Xbox 360 version as the console guest fighter. He also said they were in talks to include Sweet Tooth from Sony's Twisted Metal franchise.|$|E
2500|$|Due to past experiences, {{in later}} years Marriott became wary of success and fame as well as {{involvement}} with big record companies, and turned down lucrative concert and recording deals with names such as EMI. Because of this attitude, the band grew resentful, believing that he was holding them back, and Packet of Three was disbanded. For the next year Marriott took time off. By now he was 39 years old. He had health problems, was overweight, and had a scruffy appearance. There was little left of the striking 1960s mod icon. Film-maker Paolo Sedazzari recalled, [...] "I remember <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> in the 1980s, and he was brilliant. Great voice, great guitarist but what I couldn't get over were the dungarees and the mullet haircut. That was really disappointing." [...] According to his wife, Marriott still smoked cannabis and took cocaine, but {{nothing compared to what}} he had once consumed. In his later years Marriott liked reading; his favourite authors included Stephen King, Philip K. Dick and anything on Noël Coward, whom Marriott had always admired.|$|E
2500|$|Gene Simmons {{has made}} it clear that Criss was fired; Paul Stanley too has {{discussed}} Criss' departure in several interviews, including the commentary on [...] Ace Frehley in his 2011 book, No Regrets, also stated that Criss was fired during a band meeting in which Frehley was outvoted by Simmons and Stanley. A spoken word CD released in 1999 titled 13 Classic Kiss Stories, features Bill Aucoin (Kiss' first manager) where he also discusses Criss being [...] "let go". Criss, however, has maintained that he quit the band. The video for [...] "Shandi" [...] was shot in one day, and Peter was out of the band at that time; Stanley said of the shoot, [...] "We shot a video for the song 'Shandi' after the decision to let Peter go had been confirmed. He came to the video shoot knowing it was the last time he would appear with KISS. At the end of the day, he took his makeup case with him and left. It wasn't tearful, but it was a big moment. Peter was leaving. We had fired him, and this was the last time we were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> in the band".|$|E
6000|$|After {{about ten}} minutes, during which Mr. Sandbrook did not reappear, Captain Charteris muttered {{something}} about <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> about <b>him,</b> and stayed away a good while. When he came down, {{he came and}} sat down by Honora, and said, 'He is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> bed, quite done for.' ...|$|R
50|$|Kessler {{lived in}} the {{apartment}} for ten years, but he remained relatively unknown to the building’s occupants. It was the tenement janitor, Ignace, who knew Kessler best. He had been up to the apartment on occasion to play two-handed pinochle with Kessler, but grew tired of losing and stopped <b>going</b> up <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>him.</b> Ignace uses his free time to complain to his wife {{about the condition of}} Kessler’s apartment and spreads rumors about Kessler to the other tenants.|$|R
6000|$|MISS REED: [...] "No, Nettie; I behaved rudely to HIM. Yes! Besides, if he behaved rudely, {{he was no}} gentleman. It's {{a contradiction}} in terms, don't you see? But I'll tell you what I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do if he comes. I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> show a proper spirit for once in my life. I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> refuse <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>him.</b> You've got <b>to</b> <b>see</b> him." ...|$|R

2500|$|Lewis {{said after}} the fight [...] "Bruno did his {{homework}} and kept me from throwing my right hand early... but he must have forgotten I have a terrific left hook. I said <b>to</b> myself, 'I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> let <b>him</b> <b>see</b> my hook'". Bruno's manager, Mickey Duff, said [...] "Frank (Bruno) has no chin... once he gets hit clean on the button, he goes".|$|R
6000|$|... "No, no; listen," [...] {{she rushed}} over Graham's attempt to interrupt. [...] "I {{want to tell}} you more. There is a secret {{staircase}} that goes up from the library to Dick's work room. Only he and I use it, and his secretaries. When you arrive at the head of it, you are right in his room, surrounded by shelves of books. I have just come from there. I was <b>going</b> in <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> when I heard voices. Of course it was ranch business, I thought, and they would soon be gone. So I waited. It was ranch business, but it was so interesting, so, what Hancock would call, illuminating, that I remained and eavesdropped. It was illuminating of Dick, I mean.|$|R
50|$|Lisa {{seemed to}} {{recognize}} {{that her husband was}} an incompetent failure as a farmer but was determined to accept that this was a phase that he was <b>going</b> through and <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> through it <b>to</b> its conclusion. While Oliver was always regarded by the Hootervillians as somewhat strange, Lisa fit right in with them and was befriended by almost all of them in short order. In fact, she developed a motherly relationship with Eb Dawson, the hired hand. Although she would gladly have returned to New York in a minute had he requested it, it was she, and not he, who seemed to have found genuine happiness.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, I don't think so. Stephen is a {{rich man}} now, you know. That wouldn't make any {{difference}} with me--but Father is very--practical. Stephen is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> tomorrow." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{said that}} you were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>him,</b> and somehow, I don't know why, I have been rather {{worrying}} over it. Was the interview satisfactory, did you learn what you wanted?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very well," [...] {{the doctor}} said quietly, [...] "just as you like, Ned. I shall be seeing you every day, and will give him news of you. I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> now." ...|$|E
60|$|I was {{gradually}} coming {{to have a}} mysterious and shuddery reverence for this girl; nowadays whenever she pulled out from the station and got her train fairly started {{on one of those}} horizonless transcontinental sentences of hers, it was borne in upon me that I was standing in the awful presence of the Mother of the German Language. I was so impressed with this, that sometimes when she began to empty one of these sentences on me I unconsciously took the very attitude of reverence, and stood uncovered; and if words had been water, I had been drowned, sure. She had exactly the German way; whatever was in her mind to be delivered, whether a mere remark, or a sermon, or a cyclopedia, or the history of a war, she would get it into a single sentence or die. Whenever the literary German dives into a sentence, that is the last you are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> of <b>him</b> till he emerges {{on the other side of}} his Atlantic with his verb in his mouth.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will take}} it away with me and obtain Hartington's signature," [...] Mr. Brander said, after they had left the room, [...] "I am <b>going</b> over <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> now. I will send it in to you before the next board meeting, {{and by the way}} it would be as well when you get it stamped to pass it in with several others. I know how these things are done, and in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred the {{directors}} don't even glance at the names on the transfers. Of course they are nothing to them, they have other things to think about, but there might possibly be some remark at your transferring some of your shares just at the present moment. By the way," [...] he said, carelessly, [...] "I don't think if I were you I would make any further advances to Mildrake. Of course, he has a big business, and no doubt he is all right, but I have learned privately that they are not doing as well as they seem to be, and I know the bank is pretty deep there already." ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{night before}} she had slept better than she had done {{for the past ten}} nights. Both youth and weariness will assert {{themselves}} in the end against the tyranny of nerve-racking stress. She had slept but she woke up with her eyes full of tears. There were no traces of them when she met him in the shabby little parlour downstairs. She had swallowed them up. She was not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> let <b>him</b> <b>see.</b> She felt bound in honour to accept the situation for ever and ever unless--Ah, unless ... She dissembled all her sentiments but it was not duplicity on her part. All she wanted was to get at the truth; <b>to</b> <b>see</b> what would come of it.|$|R
6000|$|I had {{the kindest}} of {{notes from the}} kindest of men this morning, and am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> on Wednesday. Of course I mean the Duke of Devonshire. Can I take {{anything}} to Chatsworth for you? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I shall nurse Mr. Bennett," [...] I {{said with}} dignity. [...] "It is my duty and I never shirk my duty. I am noted for that. He is a man, {{and he has}} smallpox, and he keeps a vile dog; but I am not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> die for lack of care for all that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I have," [...] she answered. [...] "I {{advised that}} gentleman {{to pay his}} money, and I'm not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> cheated out of it. Of course, Mr Candy doesn't mean to cheat him, but he has gone into that {{business}} {{about the origin of}} the tame blackberry, and there's no knowing when he'll get back to this thing, which is not in his line, anyway." ...|$|E

"But my life isn't {{for you to}} give to others, {{and your}} life is mine, and I think I have some right to say what shall be done with it, and I don't choose to have it used up on old Hilbrook." [...] It passed through Ewbert's languid thought, which it stirred to a vague amusement, that {{the son of an}} older church than the Rixonite might have found in this {{thoroughly}} terrestrial attitude of his wife a potent argument for sacerdotal celibacy; but he did not attempt to formulate it, and he listened submissively while she went on: [...] "One thing: I am certainly not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> let you <b>see</b> <b>him</b> again till you've seen the doctor, and I hope he won't come about. If he does, I shall see him." ...|$|R
2500|$|J. Cole {{announced}} a release date of January 28, 2013, (his birthday) {{along with the}} album name on November 9, 2012. In early January the album was included on multiple [...] "Most Anticipated Albums of 2013" [...] such as MTV and XXL ranked Born Sinner the sixth most anticipated album of 2013. After describing the January release date as ambitious, he would announce on New Years Day 2013 that the album would be coming out at a later date. On February 22, 2013, J. Cole said that the album should arrive around June 2013. He later would confirm a release month for June, and then on April 8, 2013, J. Cole announced via Twitter that the album would be released on June 25, 2013. Interesting enough, that date {{would have been the}} seventeenth year anniversary of the release of Jay-Z's debut album Reasonable Doubt. However, he announced on May 20, 2013, via his Twitter account that he would move the release up one week to June 18, 2013. He later revealed that he moved up the release date to coincide with the release of Kanye West's album Yeezus, saying [...] "Instantly the lightbulb … it got real. I was like, 'Yo…' The idea hit me instantly: 'You got to go to that date. I'm not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> sit … I worked too hard to come a week later after Kanye West drops an amazing album. It'd be like, 'Oh and J. Cole dropped too, a week later.' Nah. I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> go <b>see</b> <b>him</b> on that date. He's the greatest. So it's like, I'm a competitor by nature so it was instant, it wasn't even a thought." ...|$|R
5000|$|Veach {{left the}} {{hospital}} {{and went to the}} county jail to interview Jean Delaney. He asked her if she had a message to take back to Carroll. [...] "Tell him that I said not to die and that they are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> let me <b>see</b> <b>him</b> in the hospital. Tell him that I love him. He was always good and kind to me, and the things they say about him aren't true. We just stopped in Waterloo to get my glasses fitted." [...] Veach told her he would deliver the message. When he arrived back at the hospital, he learned that Carroll had died just before he got there, about six p.m. He returned to the jail and told Delaney that her message had been delivered, [...] "thinking it might soften the blow somewhat." [...] Two days after Carroll's death Delaney was sentenced to a year and a day for violating her parole, and later miscarried their child. Carroll was given a Catholic funeral at the Church of the Assumption in St. Paul and was buried in Oakland Cemetery, St. Paul, Lot 279, Block 71. Carroll's grave marker has long been missing.|$|R
60|$|Stanfield {{was very}} ill for some months, then {{suddenly}} picked up, and is really rosy and jovial again. <b>Going</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> {{when he was}} very despondent, I told him the story of Fechter's piece (then in rehearsal) with appropriate action; fighting a duel with the washing-stand, defying the bedstead, and saving {{the life of the}} sofa-cushion. This so kindled his old theatrical ardour, that I think he turned the corner on the spot.|$|E
60|$|It {{seemed that}} he {{remained}} on board, keeping {{house in the}} cabin for himself and Viner; who, <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> according to promise, was induced to remain a guest. These two cronies now had fine times; tapping the captain's quarter-casks, playing cards on the transom, and giving balls of an evening to the ladies ashore. In short, they cut up so many queer capers that the missionaries complained {{of them to the}} consul; and Jermin received a sharp reprimand.|$|E
6000|$|... "No." [...] She {{had been}} {{intending}} to say: [...] "I called him my darling love." [...] But, as a contrite woman always keeps back a little, {{that portion of}} the scene remained untold. She went on: [...] "I am never <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> any more. He spoke of some things of the past: and it overcame me. He spoke of--the children. But, as I have said, I am glad--almost glad I mean--that they are dead, Richard. It blots out all that life of mine!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Only {{through your}} {{contributions}} to the Saturday Press," [...] said the young fellow, and with these golden words, the precious first personal recognition of my authorship I had ever received from a stranger, and the rich reward of all my literary endeavor, he introduced himself and his friend. I {{do not know what}} be came of this friend, or where or how he eliminated himself; but we two others were inseparable from that moment. He was a young lawyer from New York, and when I came back from Italy, four or five years later, I used <b>to</b> <b>see</b> his sign in Wall Street, with a never-fulfilled intention of <b>going</b> in <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>him.</b> In whatever world he happens now to be, I should like to send him my greetings, and confess to him that my art has never since brought me so sweet a recompense, and nothing a thousandth part so much like Fame, as that outcry of his over the hotel register in Montreal. We were comrades for four or five rich days, and shared our pleasures and expenses in viewing the monuments of those ancient Canadian capitals, which I think we valued at all their picturesque worth. We made jokes to mask our emotions; we giggled and made giggle, in the right way; we fell in and out of love with all the pretty faces and dresses we saw; and we talked evermore about literature and literary people. He had more acquaintance with the one, and more passion for the other, but he could tell me of Pfaff's lager-beer cellar on Broadway, where the Saturday Press fellows and the other Bohemians met; and this, for the time, was enough: I resolved to visit it as soon as I reached New York, in spite of the tobacco and beer (which I was given to understand were de rigueur), though they both, so far as I had known them, were apt to make me sick.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> him," [...] {{announced}} the boy, {{after a few}} moments of thoughtful silence. [...] "I am not different from Willie Grimsby, or any other of the fellows who have been <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>him.</b> It did not harm them and it will not harm me. I could go without telling you; but I would not do that. So I tell you now, beforehand, that I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Ajax." ...|$|R
60|$|It {{might be}} argued that, {{as the man}} {{was said to be}} locked in a house, and as James was not taken out of Gowrie House <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>him,</b> James must have known that, when he went upstairs with the Master, he was not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the prisoner. The error here is that, in the {{language}} of the period, a house often means a room, or chamber. It is so used by James elsewhere in this very narrative, and endless examples occur in the letters and books of the period.|$|R
