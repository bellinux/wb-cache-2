5|$|There are {{alternative}} uses of {{food power}} as well. An <b>importer</b> can refuse to continue import unless political concessions are made. This {{would have the}} same effects that an exporter refusing to export would have. An example of this would be American reduction of the Cuban sugar quota. In simple terms, the demand concentration (one <b>importer</b> being the dominant buyer) and supply dispersion (several exporters competing to sell the same product) an <b>importer</b> can try to use this exchange politically to their favor; this is especially effective if the exporter has little else so export (low action independence).|$|E

40|$|In this study, we {{employ a}} difference-in-difference, gravity-equation {{approach}} to quantifying the trade impact of hightechnology export controls that {{are motivated by}} national security. We estimate the effect of controls on high-tech export performance of the United States, of its traditional rival (peer) exporters, and of emerging exporters. Using an 11 -year panel of seven high-tech sectors from 1994 through 2004, {{we find that the}} United States under-exports to “high-threat” <b>importers.</b> We find, more surprisingly, that the United States over-exports to “medium-threat ” <b>importers</b> and to a large “trusted ” group of <b>importers,</b> both relative to a norm (default group) of <b>importers.</b> We find that traditional peer exporters under-export to the trusted group of <b>importers,</b> and along with emerging exporters, under-export to most medium-threat <b>importers.</b> These findings, robust in a comparable dataset ending in 2011, suggest high substitutability between export suppliers and export markets for high-tech products. The same peer exporters over-export to high-threat <b>importers,</b> suggesting their less stringent enforcement of multilateral export controls and also undermining to a certain extent, the security objective of the very strictest of these controls. Overall, <b>importers</b> deemed security threats import only half of their high-tech potential from the 10 exporters on which we focus. Our study underlines the importance of current American efforts to reform the export control regime to make it more target-effective...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to research the strategic reaction of national brand <b>importers</b> towards private label brands. There have been several significant studies made on the strategic reactions of national brand manufacturers towards private labels, but not on national brand importers' reactions. By definition, national brand <b>importers</b> operate in a more narrow range of functions compared to national brand manufacturers. <b>Importers</b> pose a significant force in the Finnish grocery retail market, therfore posing an interesting subject for research. This study attempts to apply applying existing theory on national brands' strategic reations to a new context of national brand <b>importers,</b> instead of national brand manufacturers. This study is qualitative in nature, the strategy for content gathering being case study and the method theme interviews. For this study, managers of importing companies were interviewed, representing significant national brands from different categories and facing competition from private labels. With this the following questions were addressed: Do the strategic reactions of national brand manufacturers towards private labels identified by previous research apply to the context of <b>importers</b> of national brands? Are national brand <b>importers</b> more limited in their strategic reactions than national brand manufacturers? Do <b>importers</b> identify strategic reactions unidentified by previous studies? Findings of this study conclude that national brand <b>importers</b> do not recognize the need to compete directly with private labels. As a long-term strategy they are more compelled to competing and having strategic reactions towards other major national brands. Therefore it can be argued, that as a strategic reaction, the option to wait and see is the most popular for national brand <b>importers.</b> However, <b>importers</b> did recognize all strategies identified by theory and felt that the strategy of constant innovation and product improvements is the best way to kepp ahead of private labes. Additionally, <b>importers</b> seemed to be more limited in their strategic reaction as compared to national brands. On the other hand, they were able to influence the manufacturer in using strategies not available to them. Finally, <b>importers</b> recognize the strategy of constantly updating their product portfolio as the main strategy for competing, if needed, with private labels...|$|R
