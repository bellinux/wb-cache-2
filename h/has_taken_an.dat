5|$|Body {{piercing}} in some religions is {{held to be}} {{destructive to}} the body. Some passages of the Bible, including Leviticus 19:28, have been interpreted as prohibiting body modification because the body is held to be the property of God. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints <b>has</b> <b>taken</b> <b>an</b> official position against most piercings unless for medical reasons, although they accept piercings for women {{as long as there}} is only one set of piercings in the lower lobe of the ears and no other place on the body. Wearing of very large nose rings on Shabbat is forbidden by the Talmud.|$|E
5|$|The idea of Masonic brotherhood {{probably}} descends from a 16th-century {{legal definition}} of a brother as one who <b>has</b> <b>taken</b> <b>an</b> oath of mutual support to another. Accordingly, Masons swear at each degree to keep the contents of that degree secret, and to support and protect their brethren unless they have broken the law. In most Lodges the oath or obligation is taken on a Volume of Sacred Law, whichever book of divine revelation is appropriate to the religious beliefs of the individual brother (usually the Bible in the Anglo-American tradition). In Progressive continental Freemasonry, books other than scripture are permissible, a cause of rupture between Grand Lodges.|$|E

5|$|The Federation {{starship}} Enterprise, {{under the}} command of Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart), brings aboard the elderly Admiral Mark Jameson and his wife Anne (Marsha Hunt) on request of Karnas (Michael Pataki), the Governor of Mordan IV. Karnas warns that a dissident terrorist group has taken a Federation Ambassador and his staff hostage, and demand to speak to a negotiator. Jameson had negotiated a previous settlement on Mordan IV. As the ship travels to Mordan IV, they find that Jameson is becoming stronger and more able to move about on his own, and is no longer showing signs of the terminal Iverson's Disease he was known to have before he was beamed aboard. The crew discovers that Jameson has been taking an array of drugs to reverse the aging process over the last two years, and only recently <b>has</b> <b>taken</b> <b>an</b> overdose of the drugs to prepare himself for the negotiations. Jameson begins to appear younger and full of energy, but has frequent pains {{as a result of the}} overdose. By the time they are nearing Mordan, Jameson now appears as a young adult.|$|E

Later, Andy is upset that he listened to Chloe in her final moments, and Liz, {{who has made a}} complaint about George's conduct, tells him that she took a call from an ex-soldier, in tears because his mother committed suicide following the death of her cat. Andy realises that the man's mother is the caller from the previous night. George advises that Andy will not face any repercussions, and asks Andy to help Michael, new to the centre, with his first call. Chloe calls in and speaks to Michael, again claiming that she <b>has</b> <b>taken</b> <b>an</b> overdose. Andy snatches the phone and shouts at Chloe, hanging up on her.|$|E

25|$|Another {{prominent}} {{aspect of}} the Mami Wata deities is their connection to healing. If someone comes down with an incurable, languorous illness, Mami Wata often takes the blame. The illness is evidence that Mami Wata <b>has</b> <b>taken</b> <b>an</b> interest in the afflicted person and that only she can cure him or her. Similarly, several other ailments {{may be attributed to}} the water spirit. In Nigeria, for example, she takes the blame for everything from headaches to sterility.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to fostering conversation, KMG Ethiopia <b>has</b> <b>taken</b> <b>an</b> {{active role in}} pressing police to prosecute crimes such as bridal abduction. The practice has been illegal in Ethiopia since 2005, but in 2010 The Independent wrote that legal authorities outside the capital were loose in their application of law, with {{the first person to}} challenge her bridal abduction—a 13-year-old who could not prove she had been a virgin {{at the time of her}} kidnapping—being accused by her own defense attorney of inciting the rape. KMG has fostered support among women and men for victims, including persuading some to proactively intervene to prevent the act. According to The Independent, as of 2010 the rate of bridal abductions in the region had diminished by 90%.|$|E

It claimed that the common people of India remain unheard and unseen except when it suits the politicians. It wants to reverse the way that the accountability of government operates and <b>has</b> <b>taken</b> <b>an</b> interpretation of the Gandhian concept of swaraj as a tenet. It believes that through swaraj the government will be directly accountable to the people instead of higher officials. The swaraj model lays stress on self-governance, community building and decentralisation.|$|E

He serves as the President of the Board of C40 Cities. In January 2014, Bloomberg began a five-year commitment totaling $53 million through Bloomberg Philanthropies to the Vibrant Oceans Initiative.

25|$|In a state torn {{by civil}} war, the contesting powers {{often do not}} have the ability to commit or the trust to believe in the other side’s {{commitment}} {{to put an end to}} war. When considering a peace agreement, the involved parties are aware of the high incentives to withdraw once one of them <b>has</b> <b>taken</b> <b>an</b> action that weakens their military, political or economical power. Commitment problems may deter a lasting peace agreement as the powers in question are aware that neither of them is able to commit to their end of the bargain in the future. States are often unable to escape conflict traps (recurring civil war conflicts) due to the lack of strong political and legal institutions that motivate bargaining, settle disputes, and enforce peace settlements.|$|E

500|$|The Supreme Court <b>has</b> <b>taken</b> <b>an</b> {{especially}} narrow view of involuntary servitude {{claims made}} by people not descended from black (African) slaves. In Robertson v. Baldwin (1897), a group of merchant seamen challenged federal statutes which criminalized a seaman's failure to complete their contractual term of service. The Court ruled that seamen's contracts had been considered unique from time immemorial, and that [...] "the amendment {{was not intended to}} introduce any novel doctrine with respect to certain descriptions of service which have always been treated as exceptional." [...] In this case, as in numerous [...] "badges and incidents" [...] cases, Justice Harlan authored a dissent favoring broader Thirteenth Amendment protections.|$|E

[...] Alan Cowell, writing in the New York Times, wrote in 1997 that the German response to Scientology– motivated by officials' fear that Scientology [...] "was a totalitarian movement growing, like the Nazi party, from inconsequential beginnings"– was itself redolent of [...] "the Nazi era's authoritarianism".|$|E
