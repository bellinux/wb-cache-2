The war <b>greatly</b> <b>increased</b> the size and importance of the Australian manufacturing sector and stimulated the development of more technologically advanced industries. As part of this trend many workers acquired relatively high skill levels and female labour force participation rates <b>greatly</b> <b>increased.</b> Many women were forced out of traditionally male-dominated industries after the war, however.|$|E

5|$|A lack of {{fluorine}} in {{the diet}} {{is the cause of}} a <b>greatly</b> <b>increased</b> incidence of dental caries. Fluoride salts can be added to table salt with the goal of reducing tooth decay, especially in countries that have not benefited from fluoridated toothpastes and fluoridated water. The practice is more common in some European countries where water fluoridation is not carried out. In France, 35% of the table salt sold contains added sodium fluoride.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} {{the west coast}} of Africa on August 9. It moved westward across the Atlantic Ocean, and reached the Lesser Antilles on August 15. While passing through the islands, convection <b>greatly</b> <b>increased,</b> causing wind gusts of up to , though it remained disorganized. On August 22, convection organized while the system was over the western Bahamas, and it developed into Tropical Depression Eleven later that day. Conditions were only marginally favorable due to lack of outflow to its west, but the depression strengthened to reach tropical storm status on August 23.|$|E

50|$|The {{best way}} to avoid this problem is to {{incorporate}} some type of organic matter into the root zone mix during construction. The most common, as noted above, is peat moss. Mixing peat moss into the root zone mixture <b>greatly</b> <b>increases</b> nutrient holding capacity.

When the bridge opened, it was the second longest suspension bridge in the world. Aarhus can be reached by train in 1 hour and 33 minutes while, thanks to the Great Belt Bridge, trains to Copenhagen can take as little as an hour and a quarter.|$|E
5|$|Alexander's legacy {{extended}} beyond his military conquests. His campaigns <b>greatly</b> <b>increased</b> contacts and trade between East and West, and vast areas {{to the east}} were significantly exposed to Greek civilization and influence.

The Carolina was a sleeping car and the Virginia was set up to serve members of the Board of Directors, with a kitchen, dining room, and observation area.|$|E

5|$|Augustus' public revenue reforms had a {{great impact}} on the {{subsequent}} success of the Empire. Augustus brought a far greater portion of the Empire's expanded land base under consistent, direct taxation from Rome, instead of exacting varying, intermittent, and somewhat arbitrary tributes from each local province as Augustus' predecessors had done. This reform <b>greatly</b> <b>increased</b> Rome's net revenue from its territorial acquisitions, stabilized its flow, and regularized the financial relationship between Rome and the provinces, rather than provoking fresh resentments with each new arbitrary exaction of tribute.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{received}} a fire-control director sometime between mid-1915 and May 1916; this centralised fire control under the director officer, who now fired the guns. The turret crewmen merely {{had to follow}} pointers transmitted from the director to align their guns on the target. This <b>greatly</b> <b>increased</b> accuracy, as {{it was easier to}} spot the fall of shells and eliminated the problem of the ship's roll dispersing the shells when each turret fired independently. Australia was also fitted with an additional inch of armour around the midships turrets following the Battle of Jutland.|$|E

Alternative methods of access such as Target Scanning (also known as eye pointing) calibrate the movement of a user's eyes to direct an SGD to produce the desired speech phase. Scanning, in which alternatives are presented to the user sequentially, became available on communication devices. Speech output possibilities included both digitized and synthesized speech.|$|E
