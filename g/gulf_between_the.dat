5|$|The pay of a praefectus of an {{auxiliary}} regiment {{in the early}} 2nd century has been estimated at over 50 times that of a miles (common soldier). (This compares to a full colonel in the British Army, who is currently paid about five times a private's salary). The reason for the huge gap between the top and {{the bottom of the}} pyramid is that Roman society was far more hierarchical than a modern one. A praefectus was not just a senior officer. He was also a Roman citizen (which most of his men were not) and, {{as a member of the}} equestrian order, an aristocrat. The social <b>gulf</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> praefectus and a peregrinus soldier was thus immense, and the pay differential reflected that fact.|$|E
5|$|There {{has been}} an {{increasing}} <b>gulf</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> Premier League and the Football League. Since its split with the Football League, many established clubs in the Premier League have managed {{to distance themselves from}} their counterparts in lower leagues. Owing {{in large part to the}} disparity in revenue from television rights between the leagues, many newly promoted teams have found it difficult to avoid relegation in their first season in the Premier League. In every season except 2001–02 and 2011–12, at least one Premier League newcomer has been relegated back to the Football League. In 1997–98 all three promoted clubs were relegated at the end of the season.|$|E
5|$|More recently, Maurice Friedman {{writes about}} the book {{in the context of}} the various {{attempts}} to find a universal essence - or perennial philosophy - within religion. He finds that Time and Eternity is a more systematic attempt at this than those proposed by Aldous Huxley or Ananda Coomaraswamy, but no more successful. For Friedman, the philosophy that Stace lays out in the book is derived from metaphysical speculation (that, like the ideas of Huxley and Coomaraswamy, is influenced by Vedanta), rather than mystical experience. Central to Friedman’s critique is the notion that there is a vast <b>gulf</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> mystical experience which Stace defines as beyond thought, and his philosophical system built on this. He also mentions that mystics do not always agree on what experiences, symbols and philosophies are the closest to the divine.|$|E

5|$|The Emperor Diocletian (r. 284–305) {{split the}} empire into {{separately}} administered {{eastern and western}} halves in 286; the empire was not considered divided by its inhabitants or rulers, as legal and administrative promulgations in one division were considered valid in the other. In 330, {{after a period of}} civil war, Constantine the Great (r. 306–337) refounded the city of Byzantium as the newly renamed eastern capital, Constantinople. Diocletian's reforms strengthened the governmental bureaucracy, reformed taxation, and strengthened the army, which bought the empire time but did not resolve the problems it was facing: excessive taxation, a declining birthrate, and pressures on its frontiers, among others. Civil war between rival emperors became common {{in the middle of the}} 4th century, diverting soldiers from the empire's frontier forces and allowing invaders to encroach. For much of the 4th century, Roman society stabilised in a new form that differed from the earlier classical period, with a widening <b>gulf</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> rich and poor, and a decline in the vitality of the smaller towns. Another change was the Christianisation, or conversion of the empire to Christianity, a gradual process that lasted from the 2nd to the 5th centuries.|$|E

25|$|The {{widening}} <b>gulf</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> top {{two divisions}} of English football can largely be put {{down to the}} increased wealth of the Premier League clubs, and the wealth gained by these clubs – combined with parachute payments following relegation – has also {{made it easier for}} many of them to quickly win promotion back to the top flight.|$|E

25|$|A major {{criticism}} of the Premier League in the mid-2000s was the emergence of <b>gulf</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> Premier League and the First Division. Criticism of the gap between clubs has continued, nevertheless, due to some clubs' increasing ability {{to spend more than}} the other Premier League clubs. For some clubs, including Shamkir, Karvan, Absheron, MKT-Araz who have failed to win immediate promotion back to the top flight, financial problems, including in some cases administration or even liquidation have followed.|$|E
25|$|The {{opposition}} to {{the government in the}} Sixth Seimas was twofold: Homeland Union-Lithuanian Conservatives led the radical opposition, relentlessly criticizing the government, while the Social Democrats and the Centre Union formed the moderate opposition. During the term there were several cases of departures or expulsions from both the ruling political group of the Democratic Labour Party and the opposition political groups. However, due to the vast <b>gulf</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> ruling and opposition parties, there were few defections across ideological borders.|$|E

25|$|In {{the social}} sciences, a {{perceived}} clinical bias exists in agoraphobia research. Branches {{of the social}} sciences, especially geography, have increasingly become interested {{in what may be}} thought of as a spatial phenomenon. One such approach links the development of agoraphobia with modernity. Factors considered contributing to agoraphobia within modernity are the ubiquity of cars and urbanization. These have helped develop the expansion of public space, on one hand, and the contraction of private space on the other, thus creating in the minds of agoraphobic-prone people a tense, unbridgeable <b>gulf</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> two.|$|E

In 1955, the western wing became West Pakistan and East Bengal became the new province of East Pakistan. The two wings {{were separated by}} some 1,600km (1,000 miles) of Indian territory and, despite their common religion of Islam, the ethnic and linguistic <b>gulf</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> two, compounded by an apathetic government based in the west, eventually resulted in the independence of Bangladesh. While Pakistani cricket was strong in the west, there was no first-class cricket in East Bengal until the 1954–55 season.|$|E
25|$|Louis XVI and {{his family}} fled Paris on 21 June 1791, but were {{captured}} in Varennes and brought back to Paris on 25 June. Hostility grew within Paris between the liberal aristocrats and merchants, who wanted a constitutional monarchy, and the more radical sans-culottes from the working-class and poor neighbourhoods, who wanted a republic and {{the abolition of the}} Ancien Régime, including the privileged classes: the aristocracy and the Church. Aristocrats continued to leave Paris for safety in the countryside or abroad.

25|$|As the 20th century entered {{its final}} third, {{it was already}} {{apparent}} to chess historians and enthusiasts that the USSR had raised standards to a level to which other nations could only aspire.

Since its earliest participation, the USSR had completely dominated team chess {{events such as the}} Chess Olympiad and European Team Championship. So pronounced was the <b>gulf</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> Soviet national side and their closest competitors, a sterner challenge was required to gauge the full extent of their supremacy.
