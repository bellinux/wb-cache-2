40|$|Abstract: Cams are {{fundamentally}} important machine elements, which provide a simplemeans of generating virtually any follower motion. This paper presents a simple yet comprehensive method {{for the design}} and machining of a cylindrical cam with a meshing <b>indexing</b> <b>disc.</b> In the proposed methodology, homogenous coordinate transformation and conjugate surface the-ory are employed to develop a kinematic model for the cam profile design. The pressure angle and the principal curvature of the designed cam are analysed using the analytical expression derived for the profile. The requiredNC data equations are obtained by solving the CNC link vari-ables by equating the machine tool ability function with the tool location matrix. The proposed methodology is verified bymachining the designed cylindrical cam using a 4 -axis CNCmachine. The inspection results obtained from a 4 -axis CMM show that the profile measurements of the machining cam are in excellent agreement {{with those of the}} designed profile. The results confirm that themethodology presented in this study enables the camdesign andmanufacturing tasks to be successfully integrated. As a result, the production process is flexible, automatic, cost efficient, and controllable...|$|E

Previous studies assessing the efficacy of stem cell injections into degenerated IVDs have reported positive findings. However, studies have been limited to small animals, targeting solely the NP, with short term follow-up. Mesenchymal precursor cells (MSC) {{were obtained from the}} iliac crest of 8 -week-old sheep. IVD degeneration was induced by postero-lateral annulotomy at three lumbar levels in eight 2 -year-old sheep. Six months later, each degenerated IVD was randomized to one of three treatments: Injection of MSC into (i) previously incised AF (AFI), (ii) NP (NPI), or (iii) no injection (negative control, NC). The adjacent IVD received injection of phosphate buffered saline into NP (positive control, PC). Radiographs and magnetic resonance imaging scans were obtained at baseline, 6, 9, and 12 months. Discs were harvested at 12 months for biochemical and histological analyses. IVD degeneration was consistently observed postannulotomy, and characterized by reduced <b>disc</b> height <b>index</b> (DHI), <b>disc</b> height (DH), glycosaminoglycan (GAG) content, and increased grade of disc degeneration. Six months after stem cell injection, DHI and DH had recovered in AFI and NPI groups when compared with NC group (P <  0. 01). Mean Pfirrmann grade improved from 3. 25 to 2. 67 (AFI group) and from 2. 96 to 2. 43 (NPI group). Mean histopathological grade improved for both AFI (P <  0. 002) and NPI (P <  0. 02) groups. Both AFI and NPI groups demonstrated spontaneous repair of the postero-lateral annular lesion.

Methods: A total of 82 patients with glaucoma in our hospital from June 2013 to November 2014 were selected as observation group, completing the clinical data of patients. In addition, 82 healthy persons with health examination at the same period were selected as control group. Then the optic disc parameters, serum MMP and TIMP related indexes were compared in two groups, and the detection levels of observation group with different Mills stages of glaucoma were compared too.

Monitoring the progression of defects in the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness is essential.

40|$|The first {{purpose of}} this paper is to generalize the {{well-known}} Maslov indices of maps of open Riemann surfaces with boundary lying on Lagrangian submanifolds to maps with boundary lying on coisotropic submanifolds in symplectic manifolds. For this purpose, we first define the notion of Maslov loops of coisotropic Grassmanians and their indices. Then we introduce the notions of transverse Maslov bundle of coisotropic submanifolds, and gradable coisotropic submanifolds. We then define graded coisotropic submanifolds and the coisotropic Maslov index of the maps with boundary lying on such graded coisotropic submanifolds, which reduces to the standard Maslov <b>index</b> of <b>disc</b> maps for the case of Lagrangian submanifolds. The second purpose is to study the geometry of coisotropic submanifolds in Kähler manifolds. We introduce the notion of the leafwise mean curvature form and transverse canonical bundle of coisotropic submanifolds and study various geometric properties thereof. Finally we combine all these to define the notion of special coisotropic submanifolds for the case of Calabi-Yau manifolds, and prove various consequences on their properties of the coisotropic Maslov indices.

40|$|Abstract—Compact disc (CD) {{players have}} been on the market for more than two decades, and the {{involved}} technologies, including control are very mature. Some problems, however, still remain with respect to playing CDs having to surface defects like scratches and fingerprints. Two servo control loops are used to keep the optical pick-up unit (OPU) focused and radially locked to the information track of the CD. The problem is to design servo controllers which are well suited for both handling surface defects and disturbances like mechanical shocks. The handling of surface defects requires a low-controller bandwidth which is in conflict with the require-ment for the handling of disturbances. This control problem can be solved by the use of a fault tolerant control strategy, where the fault detection is very important. The OPU feeds the controllers with detector signals. Based on these, focus and radial distances can be estimated and a pair of residuals can be computed. This paper introduces a model-based method to estimate focus and radial dis-tances as well as residuals, which have the potential to improve the control of a CD player in case of a surface defect. The methods are applied to experimental data of a scratch. The results of this exper-imental work show the potential of the method. <b>Index</b> Terms—Compact <b>disc</b> (CD) players, fault detection, Kalman estimators, servo systems, surface defects.

40|$|Mesenchymal {{stem cells}} (MSCs) have the {{potential}} to treat early intervertebral disc (IVD) degeneration. However, during intradiscal injection, the vast majority of cells leaked out even in the presence of hydrogel carrier. Recent evidence suggests that annulus puncture is associated with cell leakage and contributes to osteophyte formation, an undesirable side effect. This suggests the significance of developing appropriate carriers for intradiscal delivery of MSCs. We previously developed a collagen microencapsulation platform, which entraps MSCs in a solid microsphere consisting of collagen nanofiber meshwork. These solid yet porous microspheres support MSC attachment, survival, proliferation, migration, differentiation, and matrix remodeling. Here we hypothesize that intradiscal injection of MSCs in collagen microspheres will outperform that of MSCs in saline in terms of better functional outcomes and reduced side effects. Specifically, we induced disc degeneration in rabbits and then intradiscally injected autologous MSCs, either packaged within collagen microspheres or directly suspended in saline, into different disc levels. Functional outcomes including hydration <b>index</b> and <b>disc</b> height were monitored regularly until 6 months. Upon sacrifice, the involved discs were harvested for histological, biochemical, and biomechanical evaluations. MSCs in collagen microspheres showed advantage over MSCs in saline in better maintaining the dynamic mechanical behavior but similar performance in hydration and disc height maintenance and matrix composition. More importantly, upon examination of gross appearance, radiograph, and histology of IVD, delivering MSCs in collagen microspheres significantly reduced the risk of osteophyte formation as compared to that in saline. This work demonstrates the significance of using cell carriers during intradiscal injection of MSCs in treating disc degeneration. published_or_final_versio...|$|R
40|$|The baryonic mass-to-light ratio used {{to perform}} the photometry-to-mass {{conversion}} has a tremendous influence on the measurement of the baryonic content and distribution, {{as well as on}} the determination of the dark halo parameters. Since numerous clues hint at an inside-out formation process for galaxies, a radius-dependant mass-to-light ratio is needed to physically represent the radially varying stellar population. In this article, we use chemo-spectrophotometric galactic evolution (CSPE) models to determine the mass-to-light ratio for a wide range of masses and sizes in the scenario of an inside-out formation process by gas accretion. We apply our method on a SINGS subsample of ten spiral and dwarf galaxies for stellar bands covering from the UV to the MIR. The CSPE models prove to be a good tool to weight the different photometric bands in order to obtain consistent stellar discs' masses regardless of the spectral band used. On the other hand, we show that colour index vs. the mass-to-light ratio relation is an imperfect tool to assign masses to young stellar populations because of the degeneracy affecting mass-to-light ratio in all bands at low colour <b>index.</b> Resulting <b>discs</b> from our analysis are compatible with the maximum disc hypothesis provided that adequate bulge/disc decomposition is performed and correction for the presence of a bar is not neglected since it disturbs the internal disc kinematics.

Although degenerative radiological changes in discs adjacent to a fusion have been well-recognized, histopathological changes in adjacent discs have not been studied and are poorly understood. An economical small animal model for lumbar fusion would be a useful research tool. Study objectives were to: (1) develop a model of non-instrumented spine fusion in the sand rat, a rodent with spontaneous, age-related disc degeneration; (2) use radiological–histological analyses to study fusion and disc degeneration in cranial and caudal discs adjacent to the fusion. Studies were approved by our Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. A small segment of outer annulus tissue was surgically removed from lumbar discs, radiographs obtained and the animal allowed to recover and age. At surgical harvest, radiographs of 28 spine fusion specimens were scored and statistically analysed for adjacent disc space narrowing, wedging, endplate sclerosis and irregular disc margins.

Pilot studies presented here indicate that this model provides a novel addition to basic science approaches studying the clinically important topic of spinal fusion and adjacent segment changes.

The investigation is based on the analytical formulas lately published by the author. The effects of those parameters on the variation of the radial displacement, the radial and hoop stresses are all graphically illustrated for an annulus pressurized at its both surfaces. It is observed that, especially, the variation of the hoop stress in radial coordinate is closely sensible to variation of those parameters. For the chosen problems it was observed that one of two materials whose Young’s modulus is higher than the other is better to locate at the inner surface of the disc having divergent profile to get reasonable maximum hoop stresses. However much smaller radial displacements may be obtained by using positive inhomogeneity <b>indexes</b> for all <b>discs</b> whose surfaces host a material whose Young’s modulus is smaller than the other.

Clutch is a {{mechanical}} device located between a vehicle engine and its transmission and provides mechanical coupling between the engine and transmission input shaft. Clutch system comprise of flywheel, clutch disc plate and friction material, pressure plate, clutch cover, diaphragm spring and the linkage necessary to operate the clutch. The clutch engages the transmission gradually by allowing {{a certain amount of}} slippage between the flywheel and the transmission input shaft. However, the slipping mechanism of the clutch generates heat energy due to friction between the clutch disc and the flywheel. At high sliding velocity, excessive frictional heat is generated which lead to high temperature rise at the clutch disc surface, and this causes thermo-mechanical problems such as thermal deformations and thermo-elastic instability which can lead to thermal cracking, wear and other mode of failure of the clutch disc component. In this project, the modeling of clutch is done in detailed using modeling software. After that the FEM analysis is done for sintered iron friction material.

40|$|When {{considering}} the X-ray spectrum {{resulting from the}} reflection off the surface of accretion discs of AGN, {{it is necessary to}} account for the variation in reflected flux over the disc, i. e. the emissivity profile. This will depend on factors including the location and geometry of the X-ray source and the disc characteristics. We directly obtain the emissivity profile of the disc from the observed spectrum by {{considering the}} reflection component as the sum of contributions from successive radii in the disc and fitting to find the relative weightings of these components in a relativistically-broadened emission line. This method has successfully recovered known emissivity profiles from synthetic spectra and is applied to XMM-Newton spectra of the Narrow Line Seyfert 1 galaxy 1 H 0707 - 495. The data imply a twice-broken power law form of the emissivity law with a steep profile in the inner regions of the <b>disc</b> (<b>index</b> 7. 8) and then a flat region between 5. 6 rg and 34. 8 rg before tending to a constant index of 3. 3 over the outer regions of the disc.

Study Sample: Commonly used bisyllabic and trisyllabic Cantonese words were digitally recorded by native male and female talkers and then evaluated by twenty normal-hearing Cantonese listeners. Design: The recorded bisyllabic words were psychometrically evaluated and arranged into four WR lists and eight half-lists that are relatively homogeneous in audibility. Using logistic regression, SRT materials were developed by selecting 28 trisyllabic words with relatively steep psychometric functions and digitally adjusting their intensity to match the listeners' mean pure-tone average. Result: The mean psychometric slopes for the WR materials were 7. 5 %/dB for the male talker and 7. 6 %/dB for the female talker, with no statistically significant differences between the lists or half-lists.

We also calculate the slope of a powerlaw from UV to X-ray variable emission, α_ OX,Var; the average for this sample is α_ OX,Var = - 1. 06 ± 0. 04. The anticorrelation of α_ OX with the UV luminosity, L_ UV, previously found in the average emission is also present in the variable part: α_ OX,Var = (- 0. 177 ± 0. 083) log (L_ν,Var (2500 Å)) + (3. 88 ± 2. 33). Correlated variability between the emission in X-rays and UV is detected significantly for 9 of the 21 sources. All these cases are consistent with the UV lagging the X-rays, as would be seen if the correlated UV variations were produced by the reprocessing of X-ray emission.

The three crucible experimental set-up, designed by SINTEF Materials and Chemistry, will be adopted to secure identical conditions for all three melts to be investigated. From each of the melts a series of reproducible castings will be made for tensile test measurements, as well as bend tests. The results from these tests will be statistically analysed. For the assessment of melt quality, in terms of inclusion count and bi-films <b>index,</b> the Porous <b>Disc</b> Filtration Apparatus (PoDFA) and the Reduced Pressure Test (RPT) will be adopted. For the analysis of fracture behaviour Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDX) will be use. The dissolved hydrogen level will be measured by adopting an ALSPEC H probe. If time is given, the data generated in the present work will be compared with results previously obtained by SINTEF Materials and Chemistry for experiments conducted under similar conditions. It is believed that the results from the present study will provide a sound basis for understanding the fundamentals of the key issues involve in the production of high quality aluminium castings. </p...|$|R

40|$|Session: Free Papers - Spine Degenerative I: Abstract no. : 40323 INTRODUCTION: Controversy exists whether disc {{displacement}} {{is associated}} with disc degeneration, and in vivo proteoglycan concentration of disc displacement is speculative. Signal intensity on T 2 -weighted (T 2 W) MRI provides a qualitative snap-shot of disc integrity, but is not reliable and lacks quantification. T 1 -rho MRI of the discs is shown to quantitatively represent proteoglycan concentration. This imaging study addressed the “proteoglycan profile” of lumbar disc displacement and level-specific cut-off values associated with its development in human. METHODS: 76 volunteers (mean age: 50. 6 years; 51. 3 % males) underwent T 2 W and T 1 -rho MRI of the lumbar spine. The degree of disc displacement was assessed at each level based on sagittal T 2 W MRI. T 1 -rho values were obtained of each disc. Inter-observer reliability was conducted of all MRI assessments. RESULTS: 380 lumbar discs were assessed. High reliability of imaging measurements was noted. Overall, 50 % of the discs had disc displacement, most prevalent at L 4 -S 1. The median T 1 -rho values for overall lumbar non-displaced discs was 77. 6 ms compared to 64. 5 ms for displaced discs (p< 0. 001). Significant median level-specific and optimal threshold T 1 -rho values for non-displaced discs vs. displaced discs were identified. DISCUSSION: This is the first study in humans to quantitatively assess the “proteoglycan profile” of lumbar disc displacement. A decrease in proteoglycan concentration on T 1 -rho MRI was noted {{in the presence of}} disc displacement at all disc levels. Level-specific values have been identified that may have predictive utility at the <b>index</b> or adjacent <b>disc</b> levels as well as aid in the classification, etiology and therapeutics of disc displacement...|$|R
