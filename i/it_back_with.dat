5|$|The Adventure Company and Chorion, {{the owners}} of the rights to Christie's works, chose Agatha Christie's novel Murder on the Orient Express, widely {{considered}} the author's magnum opus, {{as the basis for the}} next game in the Agatha Christie series. AWE Productions had little influence in the choice, other than being asked for an opinion. Sheldon created a concept document for the new game and sent it to Chorion, who sent <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>with</b> some suggestions. Sheldon agreed to some of these, but refused others. Chorion was generally more comfortable with the development team for their second outing. They did not have to scrutinize every aspect of the game as with And Then There Were None, and generally had fewer complaints with Murder on the Orient Express, as opposed to its predecessor.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} day, April 22, 1920, the House reported {{its passage}} of the Maine bill to the Senate. The bill was referred to the Senate Committee on Banking and Currency; on April 28, Connecticut's George P. McLean reported <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>with</b> a recommendation that it pass. On May 3, McLean asked that the three coin bills (Maine, Alabama and Pilgrim) be considered by the Senate immediately, fearing that though {{they were on the}} Senate's agenda for that day, they might not be reached, and believing urgent action was required. Utah Senator Reed Smoot objected: Smoot's attempt to bring up an anti-dumping trade bill out of turn had just been objected to by Charles S. Thomas of Colorado. Smoot, however, stated if the coin bills had not been reached by about 2:00 pm, there would probably not be any objection. When McLean tried again to advance the coin bills, Kansas' Charles Curtis asked if there was any urgency. McLean replied that as the three coin bills were to mark ongoing anniversaries, there was a need to have them authorized and get the production process started. All three bills passed the Senate without opposition and the Maine bill was enacted with the signature of President Woodrow Wilson on May 10, 1920.|$|E

25|$|On October 12, 1856, Guatemalan Colonel José Víctor Zavala {{performed}} {{an act of}} courage: he crossed {{the square of the}} city to the house where Walker soldiers took shelter; under heavy fire, he made it to the enemy's flag and carried <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>with</b> him shouting to his men that the Filibuster bullets did not kill.|$|E
25|$|At 2:00 PM on 17 May, Kollowrat's attacks began. At that time, {{intelligence}} was received that Bernadotte's Saxons {{had arrived in}} Linz, having marched from Passau. Kollowrat immediately suspended the assault and determined to retreat. In fact, Bernadotte reached Linz at 7:00 AM that morning with his leading infantry and cavalry brigades. He crossed into the bridgehead {{in the afternoon and}} attacked the Austrian column on the east side, pushing <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>with</b> loss. Having disposed of Vukassovich, he turned on Sommariva on the west side and defeated his force as well.|$|E

25|$|The lost {{opportunity}} was devastating. Indianapolis went three-and-out {{on their}} ensuing possession and Mason returned their punt 19 {{yards to the}} Colts 42-yard line, setting up Del Greco's fourth field goal to make the score 19–9. The Colts then turned the ball over on downs with their next drive, but managed to get <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>with</b> 3:11 left when defensive end Mark Thomas recovered a fumble from George on the Indianapolis 39. The Colts then drove 61 yards in nine plays to score on a 15-yard touchdown run by Manning, but by then there was only 1:50 {{left in the game}} and Titans receiver Yancey Thigpen sealed the victory by recovering Vanderjagt's onside kick.|$|E
25|$|As the Union {{troops were}} withdrawing, Wood stopped his brigade {{commanded}} by Col. Charles G. Harker and sent <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>with</b> orders to counterattack the Confederates. They {{appeared on the}} scene at the flank of the Confederates who had captured the artillery pieces, causing them to retreat. The brigades of McNair, Perry, and Robinson became intermingled as they ran for shelter in the woods east of the field. Hood ordered Kershaw's Brigade to attack Harker and then raced toward Robertson's Brigade of Texans, Hood's old brigade. As he reached his former unit, a bullet struck him in his right thigh, knocking him from his horse. He was taken to a hospital near Alexander's Bridge, where his leg was amputated a few inches from the hip.|$|E
25|$|On {{the last}} {{play of the}} third quarter, Bledsoe's 39-yard {{completion}} to Glenn led to a 46-yard field goal from Vinatieri, cutting their deficit to 7-6. After a punt from each team, the Steelers {{had a chance to}} put the game away with a drive to the Patriots 1-yard line. On fourth down, coach Bill Cowher tried to ice the game with a conversion attempt, but Stewart was stuffed for no gain with 3:24 left in regulation. This gave New England one last chance to drive for a winning field goal and they managed to reach their own 42, but rookie linebacker Mike Vrabel stripped the ball from Bledsoe, and fellow linebacker Jason Gildon recovered it. The Patriots managed to get <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>with</b> 34 seconds left, but linebacker Levon Kirkland intercepted Bledsoe's Hail Mary pass on the game's final play.|$|E

25|$|In Dogma, Metatron {{is portrayed}} by Alan Rickman, stating that he {{acts as the}} Voice of God in {{situations}} where people hear God speak to them, as humanity is psychologically and physically incapable of hearing God's actual voice without their heads exploding.

During a later conversation with Bethany, the Metatron notes that Jesus had trouble adapting to the news that he was God's son and asked Metatron to take <b>it</b> <b>back,</b> <b>with</b> Metatron admitting to Bethany that he regretted placing so much responsibility on a child.|$|E
25|$|For {{many years}} {{it was thought that}} only Smith had seen the manuscript. However, in 2003, Guy Stroumsa {{reported}} that he and a group of other scholars had seen it in 1976. During a visit to Mar Saba, Stroumsa, along with the late Hebrew University professors David Flusser and Shlomo Pines, Greek Orthodox Archimandrite Meliton, and a Mar Saba monk, relocated the document where Smith had left it. Stroumsa, Meliton, and company determined that the manuscript might be safer in Jerusalem than in Mar Saba. They took <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>with</b> them, and Meliton subsequently brought it to the Patriarchate library. The group looked into having the ink tested but the only entity in the area with such technology was the Jerusalem police. Meliton did not want to leave the manuscript with the police, so no test was taken. Stroumsa published his account upon learning that he was the last living Western academic to have seen the letter.|$|E
25|$|Takenaga's troops {{managed to}} shake off pursuit by the Australians, but decided that they would surrender. They took a leaflet {{containing}} a notice of surrender {{that one of the}} soldiers had been carrying, added some conditions underneath in English, tied it to a pole for the Australians to find, and left the area. Scouts from Miles' platoon then found the leaflet and brought <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>with</b> them. On 2 May, the Australian platoon spotted Takenaga's unit near Womgrer village, and asked a native to help them make contact. Two truce bearers from the Japanese side came to the Australians to negotiate, and on the following day Takenaga's unit surrendered at Womgrer and were disarmed. At the time of surrender, Takenaga's unit consisted of 42 men: 5 officers (including Takenaga), 4 warrant officers, and 33 non-commissioned officers and soldiers. They were equipped with 5 light machine guns, 17 rifles, 5 pistols, and 750 rounds of ammunition. The prisoners, escorted by Miles' platoon, marched for three days in an orderly fashion to Maprik Airport, and were then transported to Aitape.|$|E

500|$|H. R. 8742 was {{transmitted}} to the Senate, where it was referred to the Committee on Banking and Currency. That committee's chairman, Oklahoma's Robert L. Owen, reported <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>with</b> {{an amendment to the}} full Senate, where the bill was considered on May 21, 1918. The House-passed bill had said the laws relating to the minor coinage of the United States (the cent and nickel) would apply to the coin; this was changed to state that the laws relating to the subsidiary silver coinage (which the half dollar was) would apply. The bill was passed as amended without objection. Later in the day, Illinois Senator James Hamilton Lewis made a statement which was inserted in the Congressional Record at this point, applauding the passage of the honor to his home state, and noting that [...] "more than a hundred thousand of her sons" [...] were then being deployed to the battlefields of World War I.|$|E
500|$|Oral history relates that Andriamasinavalona then {{gathered}} {{the people at}} Andohalo to announce his decision.

[...] The king sent him a lamba to wear, and the elder sent <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>with</b> the four corners torn off. The king again returned the lamba, {{and this time the}} elder trampled it in the mud. Nonetheless, Andriamampandry dressed in the lamba, declaring [...] "What's been torn can be mended, and what's been dirtied can be cleaned," [...] then attended the king's kabary. There, the king declared that he would divide his kingdom into four parts, each one a fief to be inhabited by his four favorite sons, who would participate in royal decision-making without being made kings themselves. The two northern principalities had their capitals at Ambohimanga and Ambohidrabiby, while the capital of the western principality was located at Ambohidratrimo. The southern principality was ruled from Antananarivo by Andriantomponimerina.|$|E

2500|$|Like {{other groups}} on the Northwest Coast, the Haida defended {{themselves}} with fortifications, including palisades, trapdoors and platforms. They took to water in large ocean-going canoes, big enough to accommodate as many as 60 paddlers, each created from a single Western red cedar tree. The aggressive tribe were particularly feared in sea battles, although they did respect rules of engagement in their conflicts. The Haida developed effective weapons for boat-based battle, including a special system of stone rings weighing [...] which could destroy an enemy's dugout canoe and be reused after the attacker pulled <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>with</b> the attached cedar bark rope. The Haida took captives from defeated enemies. Between 1780 and 1830, the Haida turned their aggression towards European and American traders. Among the half-dozen ships the tribe captured were the Eleanor and the Susan Sturgis. The tribe made use of the weapons they so acquired, using cannons and canoe-mounted swivel guns.|$|E
2500|$|For Halloween Haunt in 2016, Knott's Berry Farm {{introduced}} FearVR: 5150, {{a virtual}} reality attraction that {{was met with}} controversy from the mental health community regarding the negative portrayal of mental illness. The ten-minute-long attraction immersed guests inside of a chaotic mental hospital haunted by a supernatural central character named Katie and zombie-like patients. The initial controversy came from the attraction's name, with 5150 referring to the California law that allows a law enforcement officer or clinician to involuntarily commit a person suspected of having a mental illness and determined [...] "a danger to themselves or others". The backlash was focused on Cedar Fair's use of painful experiences suffered by those dealing with mental illness and to have it [...] "transmogrified into spooky entertainment". In response, Cedar Fair removed [...] "5150" [...] from the name, and after continued opposition, permanently closed the attraction on September 28, 2016, only six days after its debut. A petition was signed by more than 2,000 people hoping Cedar Fair would bring <b>it</b> <b>back,</b> <b>with</b> the petition's organizer stating that Cedar Fair shouldn't be [...] "forced to shut down an attraction based on the words {{of people who had}} not even experienced the attraction".|$|E
