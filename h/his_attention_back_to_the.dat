500|$|In his {{introduction}} to the trial, Potts writes; [...] "Thus have we for a time left the Graund Witches of the Forrest of Pendle, to the good consideration of a very sufficient jury." [...] Bromley had by then heard the cases against the three Pendle witches who had confessed to their guilt, but {{he had yet to}} deal with the others, who maintained their innocence. He knew that the only testimony against them would come from a nine-year-old girl, and that King James had cautioned judges to examine carefully the evidence presented against accused witches, warning against credulity. In his conclusion to the account of the trial, Potts says that it was interposed in the expected sequence [...] "by special order and commandment", presumably of the trial judges. After having convicted and sentenced to death three witches, Bromley may have been keen to avoid any suspicion of credulity by presenting his [...] "masterful exposure" [...] of the evidence presented by Grace Sowerbutts, before turning <b>his</b> <b>attention</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> remainder of the Pendle witches.|$|E
2500|$|After {{the peace}} treaty with Hasan, Muawiyah turned <b>his</b> <b>attention</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Romans. In 674, Umayyad naval and army forces {{under the command of}} Muawiyah's son, Yazid ibn Muawiyah, laid siege to the Byzantine capital of Constantinople, but were {{defeated}} when the Byzantines introduced Greek fire to the naval battlefield. This siege [...] in the Chinese dynastic histories of the Old Book of Tang and New Book of Tang. They record that the large capital city of Fu lin (拂菻; i.e. the Byzantine Empire) was besieged by the Da shi (大食, i.e. Umayyad Arabs) and their commander [...] "Mo-yi" [...] (Chinese: 摩拽, Pinyin: Móyè), who Friedrich Hirth has identified as Muawiyah I. The Chinese histories then explain that the Arabs forced the Byzantines to pay tribute afterwards as part of a peace settlement.|$|E
2500|$|Most Brethren {{have always}} taught Dispensationalism as their {{theological}} system. Many of them believe that Brethren pioneer John Nelson Darby {{was the first}} in modern times to [...] "rediscover" [...] what they believe was the [...] "forgotten" [...] teaching of primitive Christianity. At any rate, Darby influenced a number of influential non-Brethren Evangelical leaders, such as D.L. Moody and, indirectly, C.I. Scofield, who popularized the theory through his Scofield Reference Bible. Essentially, Dispensationalism as taught by the Brethren sees a clear distinction between [...] "law" [...] and [...] "grace", Israel and the Church, and holds that the Church, consisting of all true Christians, will be raptured when Jesus returns. This will be followed, according to this theory, by a seven-year Great Tribulation, during which God will turn <b>his</b> <b>attention</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Jewish people, who will recognize Jesus as the Messiah. This period will be followed by a thousand-year Millennium, which will see Jesus return as King of Israel.|$|E

[...] "One day," [...] he resumed, [...] "we will start off early and come down into Kandersteg and up these zigzags and here and here, and so past this Daubensee to a tiny inn--it won't be busy yet, though; we may get it all to ourselves--on the brim of the steepest zigzag you can imagine, {{thousands}} of feet of zigzag; and you will sit and eat lunch with me and look out across the Rhone Valley and over blue distances beyond blue distances to the Matterhorn and Monte Rosa and a long regiment of sunny, snowy mountains. And when we see them we shall at once {{want to go to}} them--that's the way with beautiful things--and down we shall go, like flies down a wall, to Leukerbad, and so to Leuk Station, here, and then by train up the Rhone Valley and this little side valley to Stalden; and there, in the cool of the afternoon, we shall start off up a gorge, torrents and cliffs below us and above us, to sleep in a half-way inn, and go on next day to Saas Fee, Saas of the Magic, Saas of the Pagan People. And there, about Saas, are ice and snows again, and sometimes we will loiter among the rocks and trees about Saas or peep into Samuel Butler's chapels, and sometimes we will climb up {{out of the way of}} the other people on to the glaciers and snow. And, for one expedition at least, we will go up this desolate valley here to Mattmark, and so on to Monte Moro. There indeed you see Monte Rosa. Almost the best of all." ...|$|E

50|$|Farnese was to {{have turned}} <b>his</b> <b>attention</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{northern}} Netherlands, where the Dutch rebels had regrouped, but on 1-2 August 1589, Henry III of France was assassinated, and Farnese was ordered into France, {{in support of the}} Catholic opposition to Protestant Henry IV of France. This enabled the Dutch rebels to turn the tide in favour of the Dutch Revolt, which had been in ever deeper trouble since 1576. In September 1590 he moved to relieve Paris from the lengthy siege it had been placed under by Huguenots and Royalists loyal to Henry IV.|$|E
50|$|Relieved {{from the}} great battles with the Ottomans in the Mediterranean, Philip II of Spain turned <b>his</b> <b>attention</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{uprising}} in the Low Countries and in 1579 sent Alessandro Farnese, Duke of Parma to head his army in Flanders to regain control over Flanders, Brabant and the United Provinces. When the siege of Antwerp began (1585) most of the County of Flanders and the Duchy of Brabant, including Brussels, had been recaptured in the preceding year. The army of Flanders had been reinforced in the previous years, both in quantity and quality, and in 1585 it had 61,000 men under arms.|$|E

Later that evening, Kennedy made a brief speech on the assassination of King to a crowd gathered for a political rally at 17th and Broadway - an African American neighborhood near {{the north side of}} Indianapolis. He attempted to console the crowd with calls for peace and compassion. After attending King's funeral in Atlanta, Georgia, Kennedy turned <b>his</b> <b>attention</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> primary campaign. He drew huge crowds at camapign stops across the country. Kennedy's Indiana campaign resumed on April 10.|$|E
50|$|After {{this show}} of {{strength}} against the Romans, Pharnaces II drew back to suppress revolt {{in his new}} conquests. However, the extremely rapid approach of Caesar in person forced Pharnaces to turn <b>his</b> <b>attention</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Romans. At first, recognizing the threat, he made offers of submission, with the sole object of gaining time until Caesar's attention fell elsewhere; but Caesar's speed brought war quickly, and battle took place near Zela, where Pharnaces was routed {{and was able to}} escape with just a small detachment of cavalry. Caesar himself, in a letter to a friend in Rome, said of the short war: “Veni, vidi, vici” (“I came, I saw, I conquered”).|$|E

50|$|With the U.S. finally {{arranging}} convoys, ship {{losses to}} the U-boats quickly dropped, Dönitz realized his U-boats were better used elsewhere.

Convoy SC 94 marked the return of the U-boats to the convoys from Canada to Britain. The command centre for the submarines operating in the West, including the Atlantic also changed, moving to a newly constructed command bunker at the Château de Pignerolle just east of Angers on the Loire river. The headquarters was commanded by Hans-Rudolf Rösing.|$|E

Caesar's victory was so swift and complete that, {{in a letter to}} a friend in Rome, he famously said of the short war, [...] "Veni, vidi, vici" [...] ("I came, I saw, I conquered"): indeed, for his Pontic triumph, that may well have been the label displayed above the spoils.|$|E

50|$|With {{the issue}} with the Ottomans now settled, Peter turned <b>his</b> <b>attention</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north, and to the {{dismantling}} of the Swedish Empire on the Baltic. He seized Viborg, Riga, and Reval in 1710. With Charles XII now deposed, the coalition against Sweden was formed again. Peter divided his army between assisting his allies in the south Baltic, and his own attacks in the east. What is now Estonia and Livonia, weakly defended, fell quickly. Peter then moved north and invaded Finland in 1713. Meanwhile, Charles, traveling incognito, returned to Sweden in 1714. The Swedes, with their empire broken and nothing left to lose, continued to fight. At sea, the prebuilt Russian fleet, which had proved useless when victory was still uncertain, was proving its worth at consolidating Russian victories; victories at Gangut in 1714, Ösel in 1719, and Grengam in 1720 gave Peter control of the sea.|$|E
