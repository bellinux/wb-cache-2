40|$|IGF-I {{promotes}} growth during {{postnatal development}} via both endocrine and autocrine actions. <b>In</b> <b>pcd</b> mice (pcd/ pcd), we previously found that IGF-I mRNA expression was decreased in cerebellar Purkinje cells as they underwent apoptosis. To investigate the endocrine function of IGF-I, we examined hepatic IGF-I mRNA by Northern hybridization, circulating IGF-I peptide by radioimmunoassay, and circulating IGFBP by Western ligand blot <b>in</b> <b>pcd</b> mice. At postnatal days (D) 17 and 24, hepatic IGF-I mRNA and circulating IGF-I and IGF-II concentrations were normal <b>in</b> <b>pcd</b> mice. From D 45, both hepatic IGF-I mRNA and circulating IGF-I concentrations decreased. The decrease in circulating IGF-I concentrations {{was accompanied by}} a simultaneous increase in circulating IGF-II concentrations in both the D 45 and adult pcd mice. An early decrease in the circulating IGFBP- 3 levels and an increase in the IGFBP- 2 levels were observed at D 17 and were followed by decreases in both IGFBPs at D 45 and in the adult. Therefore, after the cerebellar neurodegeneration, there was an overall decrease in IGF-I gene expression <b>in</b> <b>pcd</b> mice.

40|$|Purkinje {{cells are}} {{a class of}} {{specialized}} neurons in the cerebellum, and {{are among the most}} metabolically active of all neurons, as they receive immense synaptic stimulation, and provide the only efferent output from the cerebellum. Degeneration of Purkinje cells is a common feature of inherited ataxias in humans and mice. To understand Purkinje neuron degeneration, investigators have turned to naturally occurring Purkinje cell degeneration phenotypes in mice to identify key regulatory proteins and cellular pathways. The Purkinje cell degeneration (pcd) mouse is a recessive mutant characterized by complete and dramatic post-natal, cell autonomous Purkinje neuron degeneration and death. As the basis of Purkinje cell death <b>in</b> <b>pcd</b> is unresolved, and contradictory data has emerged for the role of autophagy in Purkinje cell degeneration, we studied the mechanism of Purkinje cell death <b>in</b> <b>pcd</b> mice. BAX null status did not suppress Purkinje neuron death <b>in</b> <b>pcd</b> mice, indicating that classic apoptosis is not responsible for Purkinje cell loss. Interestingly, LC 3 Western blot analysis and GFP-LC 3 immunostaining of degenerating pcd cerebellum revealed activation of the autophagy pathway. Ultrastructural studies confirmed increased autophagy pathway activity in Purkinje cells, and yielded evidence for mitophagy, in agreement with LC 3 immunoblotting of cerebellar fractions. As p 62 levels were decreased <b>in</b> <b>pcd</b> cerebellum, our findings suggest that pcd Purkinje cell neurons can execute effective autophagy. However, our results support a role for dysregulated autophagy activation <b>in</b> <b>pcd,</b> and suggest that increased or aberrant mitophagy contributes to the Purkinje cell degeneration <b>in</b> <b>pcd</b> mice...|$|R

Background: Physiologic factors in dogs that might contribute to enhanced platelet yield <b>in</b> platelet concentrates (<b>PCs)</b> are largely unknown. Objective: To determine whether individual differences in weight, age, preprocessing blood chemistry, and CBC variables predict the final platelet concentrations <b>in</b> <b>PCs.</b> Our hypotheses were (1) increased lipemic indices would be positively associated with increased platelet concentrations <b>in</b> <b>PCs</b> and (2) increased preprocessing platelet concentrations would be associated with higher platelet concentrations <b>in</b> the <b>PCs.</b> Animals: All blood donation records of dogs from February 2, 2009 through April 1, 2015 at the University of California—Davis Veterinary Blood Bank were examined with 104 cases included in this study. Methods: In this retrospective study, data were collected from medical records of canine blood donors. Records were reviewed for internal consistency and accuracy and subjects were included in the study if donor screening and donation occurred on the same day and a viable PC was obtained. Univariate and multivariable regressions were used to test the impact that each variable had on the final platelet concentration <b>in</b> <b>PCs.</b> Results: Final platelet concentration <b>in</b> <b>PCs</b> was positively associated with the predonation CBC platelet values (P <. 001), lipemic index (P =. 01), and phosphorous levels (P =. 001). Collectively these 3 variables explained 29 % of the variance in platelet concentrations <b>in</b> <b>PCs.</b> Conclusions and clinical importance: Future prospective studies are required to determine if canine blood donations from dogs with lipemia yield PCs with higher platelet concentrations without negatively affecting other blood components...|$|R

40|$|The {{organization}} of the neuronal hippocampal network depends on the tightly regulated interaction between pyramidal cells (PCs) and interneurons (Ints). NMDA receptor (NMDAR) activation requires the binding of glutamate and co-activation of the ‘glycine site’. It {{has been reported that}} d-serine is a more potent endogenous agonist than glycine for that site. While many studies have focused on NMDAR function <b>in</b> <b>PCs,</b> little is known regarding the modulation of NMDARs in Ints. We studied the modulatory effect of d-serine on NMDAR EPSCs <b>in</b> <b>PCs</b> and <b>in</b> stratum radiatum Ints using whole-cell patch-clamp recording in rat acute hippocampal slices. We found that d-serine enhances NMDAR function and differently modulates NMDAR currents in both cell types. The augmentation of NMDAR currents by d-serine was significantly larger <b>in</b> <b>PCs</b> compared with Ints. Moreover, we found differences in the kinetics of NMDAR currents <b>in</b> <b>PCs</b> and Ints. Our findings indicate that regulation of NMDAR through the ‘glycine site’ depends on the cell types. We speculate that the observed differences arise from assemblies of diverse NMDAR subunits. Overall, our data suggest that d-serine may be involved in regulation of the excitation-inhibition balance in the CA 1 hippocampal region...|$|R

40|$|Neural {{circuits}} are initially redundant but rearranged through activity-dependent synapse elimination during postnatal development. This {{process is}} crucial for shaping mature neural circuits and for proper brain function. At birth, Purkinje cells (<b>PCs)</b> <b>in</b> the cerebellum are innervated by multiple climbing fibers (CFs) with similar synaptic strengths. During postnatal development, a single CF is selectively strengthened <b>in</b> each <b>PC</b> through synaptic competition, the strengthened single CF undergoes translocation to a PC dendrite, and massive elimination of redundant CF synapses follows. To investigate the cellular mechanisms of this activity-dependent synaptic refinement, we generated mice with PC-selective deletion of the Cav 2. 1 P/Q-type Ca 2 + channel, the major voltage-dependent Ca 2 + channel <b>in</b> <b>PCs.</b> <b>In</b> the PC-selective Cav 2. 1 knockout mice, Ca 2 + transients induced by spontaneous CF inputs are markedly reduced <b>in</b> <b>PCs</b> <b>in</b> vivo. Not a single but multiple CFs were equally strengthened <b>in</b> each <b>PC</b> from postnatal day 5 (P 5) to P 8, multiple CFs underwent translocation to PC dendrites, and subsequent synapse elimination until around P 12 was severely impaired. Thus, P/Q-type Ca 2 + channels <b>in</b> postsynaptic <b>PCs</b> mediate synaptic competition among multiple CFs and trigger synapse elimination in developing cerebellum...|$|R

We show that ROS <b>in</b> <b>PCs</b> act <b>in</b> a paracrine manner to regulate normal cardiac function, not by diffusing into the CMs to exert their function, but by eliciting a downstream D-MKK 3 -D-p 38 MAPK signaling cascade <b>in</b> <b>PCs</b> that acts on the CMs to regulate their function.

40|$|SummarySynapse {{elimination}} {{is crucial}} for precise neural circuit formation during postnatal development. We examined how relative differences in synaptic strengths among competing inputs and/or absolute synaptic strengths contribute to climbing fiber (CF) to Purkinje cell (<b>PC)</b> synapse elimination <b>in</b> the cerebellum.

Whereas relative differences between “strong” and “weak” CF-mediated postsynaptic response are preserved, absolute strengths of CF inputs are scaled down globally <b>in</b> <b>PCs</b> of γ- 2 PC-KO mice. Although the early phase of CF elimination is normal, dendritic translocation of the strongest CF and the late phase of CF elimination that requires Ca 2 +-dependent activation of Arc/Arg 3. 1 <b>in</b> <b>PCs</b> are both impaired in γ- 2 PC-KO mice.
