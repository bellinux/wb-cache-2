40|$|Introduction. Polyaxial screws {{had been}} only tested {{according}} to the ASTM standards (when they were perpendicularly positioned to the rod). In this study, effects of the pedicle screws angled fixation to the rod on the mechanical properties of fixation were investigated. Materials and Method. 30 vertically <b>fixed</b> <b>screws</b> and 30 <b>screws</b> <b>fixed</b> with angle {{were used in the}} study. Screws were used in three different diameters which were 6. 5 [*]mm, 7. 0 [*]mm, and 7. 5 [*]mm, in equal numbers. Axial pull-out and flexion moment tests were performed. Test results compared with each other using appropriate statistical methods. Results. In pull-out test, vertically <b>fixed</b> <b>screws,</b> in 6. 5 [*]mm and 7. 0 [*]mm diameter, had significantly higher maximum load values than angled <b>fixed</b> <b>screws</b> with the same diameters (P< 0. 01). Additionally, vertically <b>fixed</b> <b>screws,</b> in all diameters, had significantly greater stiffness according to corresponding size fixed with angle (P< 0. 005). Conclusion. <b>Fixing</b> the pedicle <b>screw</b> to the rod with angle significantly decreased the pull-out stiffness in all diameters. Similarly, pedicle <b>screw</b> instrumentation <b>fixed</b> with angle decreased the minimum sagittal angle between the rod and the screw in all diameters for flexion moment test but the differences were not significant...|$|R

40|$|In {{the field}} of photogrammetry, the optical system, usually {{represented}} by the glass lens, is used for metric purposes. Therefore, the aberration characteristics of such a lens, inducing deviations from projective imaging, has to be well known. However, the most important property of the metric lens is the stability of its glass and mechanical elements, ensuring long-term reliability of the measured parameters. In case of a focus-variable lens, the repeatability of the lens setup is important as well. Lenses with a fixed focal length are usually considered as “fixed” though, in fact, most of them contain one or more movable glass elements, providing the focusing function. In cases where the lens is not equipped with <b>fixing</b> <b>screws,</b> the repeatability of the calibration parameters should be known. This paper derives simple mathematical formulas {{that can be used}} for measuring the repeatability of the focus-variable lenses, and gives a demonstrative example of such measuring. The given procedure has the advantage that only demanded parameters are estimated, hence, no unwanted correlations with the additional parameters exist. The test arrangement enables us to measure each demanded magnification of the optical system, which is important in close-range photogrammetry...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to assess the {{clinical}} relevance of the potential mechanical error (intrinsic error) caused by the cylinder-burr gap in a 'single type' stereolithographic surgical template in implant guided surgery. 129 implants were inserted in 12 patients using 18 templates. The pre- and postoperative computed tomography (CT) scans were matched allowing comparison of the planned implants with the placed ones. Considering only the angular deviation values, the t test was used to determine the influence of the guide fixation and the arch of support on accuracy values. The Pearson correlation coefficient was used to correlate angular deviation and bone density. The intrinsic error was mathematically evaluated. t test results indicated that the use of <b>fixing</b> <b>screws</b> (P = 009) and the upper arch support (P = 027) resulted in better accuracy. The Pearson correlation coefficient (0. 229) indicated a significant linear correlation between angular deviations and bone density (P = 009). A mean intrinsic error of 2. 57 was mathematically determined considering only the angular deviation, as it was not influenced by other variables. The intrinsic error is a significant factor compared to all the variables that could potentially affect the accuracy of computer-aided implant placement. © 2012 International Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons...|$|E
40|$|In {{orthopedic}} {{and trauma}} surgery, metallic plates {{are used for}} reduction and fixation of bone fractures. In clinical practice, the intra-operative planning for screw fixation is usually based on fluoroscopic images. Screw fixation is then performed on a free-hand basis. As such, multiple attempts may be {{required in order to}} achieve an optimal positioning of the <b>fixing</b> <b>screws.</b> To help the physician insert the screws in accordance to the planned position, we propose a method for screw insertion guidance. Our approach uses a small video camera, rigidly placed on the drill, and a set of small markers that are rigidly fixed on a variable angle drill sleeve. In order to investigate the achievable accuracy of our setup, we simulate the estimation of the drill bit position under two different marker arrangements, planar and 3 D, and different noise levels. Furthermore, we motivate our choices for marker design and position given the limited space available for marker positioning, the requirement for accurate position estimation of the drill bit and the illumination changes that could affect the surgical site. We also describe our proposed marker detection and tracking pipeline. Our simulation results let us conclude that we can achieve an accuracy of 1 ◦ and 1 mm in the estimation of angular orientation and tip position of the drill bit respectively, provided that we have accurate marker detection...|$|E

40|$|In modern medicine, {{computer}} support {{becomes more}} and more important. Especially the combination of operation planing {{and the use of the}} planing results during an operation can help to optimize the work of surgeons. To use the planing data intraoperatively, the virtual world, containing the planing information must be matched with the real situation in the operation room. This is the goal of the Registration process. It determines a transformation to project preoperative data onto the patient inside the operation room. Actually this registration is done by <b>fixing</b> <b>screws</b> to the patient, which can be found within the CT dataset and measured mechanically during the operation. Affixing these screws efforts an additional operation and is an additional risk for the patient. The goal of this work was the evaluation of an alternative approach for the registration, using an intraoperative ultrasoundsystem, which is able to measure anatomical landmarks. To realize this task, a suited matching algorithm is used. This algorithm works on the segmented object of the anatomical region on one hand and on contours of the same region, measured by an intraoperatively attached ultrasound device on the other hand. The matching algorithm will find the transformation, which projects the contours onto the surface of the anatomical region. This transformation is the registration. In this diploma thesis a capable matching algorithm was founds and a system implementing this registration approach was developed and evaluated...|$|E
40|$|Profiled {{steel sheet}} dry boards or PSSDB system is an {{alternative}} composite construction system comprising of profiled steel sheet compositely connected to dry boards by self-tapping self-driving screws. PSSDB system was used widely as flooring system in the lightweight construction of buildings and office space in factories. Due to its superiority in the installation techniques, PSSDB system was expanded in the application as load bearing wall panel system in buildings. The PSSDB system is as an alternative construction technique on load bearing wall panel that offers cost savings synonymously with the rapid progress {{of science and technology}} which leads to the shift from traditional utilization of construction materials to newer construction techniques. A finite element analysis was carried out to determine the effect of screw spacing on the PSSDB wall panel. The spacing selected was between 100 mm to 500 mm, at an increment of 100 mm in each different model. The wall panel measured 3000 mm by 3000 mm with a 1200 mm square window opening, 78 mm thick and butt joints vertically positioned in the dry boards. This paper looks into the system as load bearing wall panels, analyzing it under axial compressive load using established Finite Element technique. The deformation profile of the PSSDB wall panel system showed a single curvature deformation profile, maximum lateral displacement at two-thirds wall panel height and critical sections at the upper corners of the square opening.
