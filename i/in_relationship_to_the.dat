5|$|While using Dante's terza rima style, {{the poem}} {{continues}} by describing the Battle of Britain. The image of warfare merges with {{the depiction of}} Pentecost, and the Holy Spirit is juxtaposed with the air-raids on London. In the second section, a ghost, representing the poets of the past stuck between worlds, begins talking to the narrator of the poem. The ghost discusses change, art in general, and how humankind is flawed. The only way to overcome the problematic condition of humanity, according to the ghost, is to experience purgation through fire. The fire is described {{in a manner similar}} to Julian of Norwich's writing about God's love and discussed <b>in</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> shirt of Nessus, a shirt that burns its wearer. Little Gidding continues by describing the eternalness of the present and how history exists in a pattern. The poem concludes by explaining how sacrifice is needed to allow an individual to die into life and be reborn, and that salvation should be the goal of humankind.|$|E

25|$|On August 3, a VCheKa {{section for}} combating counterrevolution, {{speculation}} and sabotage on railways was created. On August 7, 1918, Sovnarkom adopted a decree {{on the organization}} of the railway section at VCheKa. Combating counterrevolution, speculation, and malfeasance on railroads was passed {{under the jurisdiction of the}} railway section of VCheKa and local Cheka. In August 1918, railway sections were formed under the Gubcheks. Formally, they were part of the non-resident sections, but in fact constituted a separate division, largely autonomous in their activities. The gubernatorial and oblast-type Chekas retained <b>in</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> transportation sections only control and investigative functions.|$|E

25|$|The United States Constitution is {{the supreme}} {{law of the}} United States. The Constitution, {{originally}} comprising seven articles, delineates the national frame of government. Its first three articles entrench {{the doctrine of the}} separation of powers, whereby the federal government is divided into three branches: the legislative, consisting of the bicameral Congress; the executive, consisting of the President; and the judicial, consisting of the Supreme Court and other federal courts. Articles Four, Five and Six entrench concepts of federalism, describing the rights and responsibilities of state governments and of the states <b>in</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> federal government. Article Seven establishes the procedure subsequently used by the thirteen States to ratify it.|$|E
25|$|In 1924 Doehring {{took over}} the {{chairmanship}} of the Evangelical Alliance to Preserve German-Protestant Interests (EB). His appointment to this position was not unanimously approved by the alliance's members. His insistence on uncritical attachment to the abdicated Kaiser and his rigid hostility towards the Catholic Church contributed to the increasing isolation of the Protestant church in German society, and in particular <b>in</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> proletariat and to bourgeois democracy. Doehring also refused increasingly urgent prospective interdenominational political cooperation with state-preserving Catholic forces, which had been drifting towards the Center Party and the DNVP since the end of 1926. Following the withdrawal of Adolf von Harnack and Otto Baumgarten, the conflict over the direction of the EB culminated in Doehring's resignation in February 1927.|$|E
25|$|Approximately 16% of the city's {{structures}} are cataloged as important historical structures, {{with many of}} those attaining the status of state and national significance {{in terms of a}} particular structure's importance <b>in</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> body of surviving examples of the architectural style attributed to its construction and related detail. Thirteen distinct districts have been identified which meet the criteria for the National Register of Historic Places. Among them are the 2nd Street District (10 buildings), 15th Street district (13 buildings) and the O Street district (43 buildings). Hillsdale Street, a popular and well-preserved district, contains 17 buildings of historic interest. In all, some 1,500 buildings have been recognized as qualifying for the National Register. The Eureka Heritage Society, a local architectural preservation group founded in 1973, has been instrumental in protecting and preserving many of Eureka’s fine Victorians.|$|E

25|$|Quantum gravity {{refers to}} the {{imagined}} merger between the twin pillars of physical science which are quantum mechanics, {{the study of the}} microscopic (e.g., electrons), and general relativity, the science of the macroscopic (e.g., galaxies). Currently, these two great domains of science cannot be effectively interwoven into a single, physical Theory of Everything. Yet progress is being made, most notably through string theory, loop quantum gravity, black hole thermodynamics and the study of the early universe. Some of the difficulties combining these two pillars of physical science are philosophical in nature and {{it is possible that the}} macro view of knowledge offered by the ToK may eventually aid in the construction of a coherent theory of quantum gravity. The reason the ToK might help is that it locates scientific knowledge <b>in</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> physical universe.|$|E
25|$|This set {{the stage}} for {{confidential}} negotiations between Auckland's mayor Dick Hubbard and the investors, who on 31 August 2005 (now known as 'Matiatia Day' on the island) sold the stock in WIL to the city for $12.5 million. The unanimous vote on 30 June 2005 of the City Council to approve the purchase was said to have come about because of the unity of the people of Waiheke Island. The court case finally was concluded with permitted development set at 10,000 m2 of mixed use gross floor development. The Court also found Auckland City Council and WIL liable for costs <b>in</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> interlocutory judgement. Since WIL was now owned by Council, it had to write a cheque to CAPOW for $18,000, representing 75% of CAPOW's costs on that matter.

500|$|Initially, Horner is {{confident}} that he can seek out the married women {{who are willing to}} have affairs because {{they are the ones who}} do not care about their honor. Horner seems to believe he is in a position of power over the women because their extramarital affair is with him, but his power wanes during the duration of the play. In Act 5, Scene 4, Lady Fidget, Dainty Fidget, and Mistress Squeamish barge into Horner’s lodgings despite his protest, conveying “his lower position that alludes to his disguise: a lowly eunuch.” [...] They talk about him as if he was not present, referring to him as a ‘beast,’ ‘toad,’ and eunuch. Cohen says, “As the ladies grow in aggressive self-confidence, Lady Fidget also ‘claps him on the back’ thereby revealing the altered socio-sexual roles that are now presented.” [...] While Horner thinks he is manipulating the women, he has “exhausted his sexual resources and has, in reality, become that impotent and useless object with the world publicly recognizes him to be.” [...] Horner’s true power is not <b>in</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> women, but to the men. He shows his dominance over the men he cuckolds.|$|E
500|$|Post-production {{lasted for}} {{fourteen}} months. Because {{the film was}} made before computer animation and digital compositing were widely used, all the animation was done using cels and optical compositing. First, the animators and lay-out artists were given black and white printouts of the live action scenes (known as [...] "photo stats"), and they placed their animation paper on top of them. The artists then drew the animated characters <b>in</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> live action footage. Due to Zemeckis' dynamic camera moves, the animators had to confront the challenge of ensuring the characters were not [...] "slipping and slipping all over the place." [...] After rough animation was complete, it would run through the normal process of traditional animation until the cels were shot on the rostrum camera with no background. The animated footage was then sent to ILM for compositing, where technicians would animate three lighting layers (shadows, highlights and tone mattes) separately, {{in order to make}} the cartoon characters look three-dimensional and give the illusion of the characters being affected by the lighting on set. Finally, the lighting effects were optically composited on to the cartoon characters, who were, in turn, composited into the live-action footage. One of the most difficult effects in the film was Jessica's dress in the night club scene, because it had flashing sequins, an effect accomplished by filtering light through a plastic bag scratched with steel wool.|$|E

Presumably the Israelite dwellings and artifacts consisted only of perishable materials." [...] Hoffmeier wrote, [...] "None of the encampments of the wilderness wanderings can be meaningful if the Israelites went directly to either Kadesh or Midian ... a journey of eleven days from Kadesh to Horeb can be properly understood only <b>in</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> southern portion of the Sinai Peninsula." ...|$|E
