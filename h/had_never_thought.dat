But he preferred to stay calm as {{he does not want}} to hurt his father. Subramaniam realises his mistake and apologises to everyone saying that he always wanted to take care of his family members so well but <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> that they are sacrificing a lot to make him happy.|$|E
5|$|Anyone who {{has ever}} studied the history of American diplomacy, {{especially}} military diplomacy, knows that you might start in a war with certain things on your mind as a purpose {{of what you are}} doing, but in the end, you found yourself fighting for entirely different things that you <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> of before... In other words, war has a momentum of its own and it carries you away from all thoughtful intentions when you get into it. Today, if we went into Iraq, like the president would like us to do, you know where you begin. You never know where you are going to end.|$|E

25|$|As {{soon as the}} Captain of the Guard {{declared}} his charge to make him prisoner, Cromwell in a rage cast his bonnet on the ground, saying to the duke of Norfolk and others of the Privy Council assembled there {{that this was the}} reward of his services, and that he appealed to their consciences as to whether he was a traitor; but since he was treated thus he renounced all pardon, as he <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> to have offended, and only asked the King not to make him languish long. Thereupon some said he was a traitor, others that he should be judged according to the laws he had made, which were so sanguinary that often words spoken inadvertently with good intention had been constituted high treason. The duke of Norfolk having reproached him with some “villennyes” done by him, snatched off the order of St. George which he bore on his neck, and the Admiral, to show himself as great an enemy in adversity as he had been thought a friend in prosperity, untied the Garter. Then, by a door which opens upon the water, he was put in a boat and taken to the Tower without the people of this town suspecting it until they saw all the King's archers under Mr. Cheyney {{at the door of the}} prisoner's house, where they made an inventory of his goods.|$|E
500|$|This {{was written}} {{years after the}} {{campaign}} and is affected by hindsight, both {{of the results of}} the battle and of the postbellum criticism of the Lost Cause authors. In letters of the time Longstreet made no reference to such a bargain with Lee. In April 1868, Lee said that he [...] "had never made any such promise, and <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> of doing any such thing." [...] Yet in his post-battle report, Lee wrote, [...] "It had not been intended to fight a general battle at such a distance from our base, unless attacked by the enemy." ...|$|E
500|$|With {{no party}} {{organisation}} and only his own financial resources, Davies's campaign was initially very low-key. His election literature {{was a single}} sheet with the message [...] "You Know Me, I've Never Let You Down". As polling day approached, however, {{it was clear that}} he was gathering support, particularly among the young—a great irony, Alun Morgan observes, for a man sacked on the grounds of his age. In the final week before polling day on 18 June Davies's youthful supporters toured the constituency with songs, slogans and cheerleaders in what Griffiths describes as [...] "the most colourful election bandwaggon seen in Merthyr for 40 years". The official Labour campaign stalled, as Lloyd became embroiled in a row over his role in the failure of the AEU to support an unofficial strike at the local Hoover factory. On polling day, amid scenes of jubilation. Davies was returned with a majority of 7,467 over Lloyd. Davies responded to his victory by thanking the voters whom, he said, he <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> for a moment would let him down. Two weeks later Davies and his principal campaign workers were expelled from the Labour Party for opposing its official candidate. The national leadership refused his request for an official inquiry into the actions of the Merthyr party, in the selection process and during the election itself.|$|E

500|$|The article {{revealed}} that early scripts {{for the movie}} were {{going to focus on}} series heroine Samus Aran and her origin. Tiger Hill wanted to explore Samus prior to her becoming the lone bounty hunter featured in the series. According to Foxhoven, the movie version of Samus Aran was [...] "to be an exceptionally talented, but also flawed character who was looking for redemption," [...] and elaborating that, [...] "We wanted to see her struggle, to be humbled, and to be forced to rise up against crazy odds. And of course we wanted to see the cool weapons in all of their glory." [...] The major problem that the writers faced was attempting to build-out Samus's back-story, Nintendo had [...] "creative" [...] and [...] "licensing" [...] walls that the writers ran into. Foxhoven stated that these questions came up: [...] "What are they doing when they are NOT fighting? What is their daily existence and relationships? What are Samus's aspirations, history, and fears?" [...] and further stated that [...] "Nintendo appreciated the questions, but <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> about them before, and ultimately didn't have a lot of answers" [...] and at the end, Nintendo [...] "felt uncomfortable with our team [...] being the ones to propose those answers" [...] which basically caused the Metroid movie project to be ultimately canceled sometime in 2007. Foxhoven however foresees Metroid becoming a movie, stating {{at the end of the}} IGN interview that [...] "for Nintendo, they walked away appreciating the process and how much further they needed to explore the franchise so that it has a chance for a feature film at some point" [...] and he {{revealed that}} [...] "there are quite a few Hollywood executives in town who grew up playing Metroid, and who would be willing to take the time needed to bring Nintendo along in the process." ...|$|E

Szilárd and Einstein knew each other well and had worked together years previously, but Einstein <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> about this possibility for nuclear energy until Szilard reported it to him, {{at the beginning of his}} quest to produce the Einstein-Szilárd letter to alert the U.S. government.|$|E
2500|$|Unfortunately for Waddingham, the man {{in charge}} of cremations was Dr Cyril Banks, who was also the Medical Officer for Health in Nottingham. Banks <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> highly of Waddingham's {{establishment}} as a so-called [...] "nursing home", and knew there was no State Registered Nurse on the staff (as there should have been). He became suspicious at the note from Ada Baguley that authorised cremation and ordered a post-mortem. The post-mortem found no traces of anything connected to Ada's physical conditions that could have immediately caused death. This led to an analysis of the organs of the deceased by Dr W. W. Taylor, Senior Assistant to the Nottingham Analyst. He found considerable traces of morphine (over three grains) in her stomach, liver, kidneys and her heart.|$|E

2500|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} {{over a period}} of seven months in Los Angeles, New York City and Tokyo. The bulk of the album was recorded at Eagle Rock, Los Angeles. [...] "Letter in the Sky" [...] was recorded in Hollywood, and [...] "Happiness," [...] "Yume no Mukou" [...] and [...] "Utsukushiki Mono" [...] were recorded in Tokyo. Ai felt that moving to a new label was a chance to refresh her music. In the album sessions, Ai felt challenged in many ways. [...] "Dance Together," [...] an electronic song, was something she <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> of making, as she previously thought she did not enjoy the genre. Ai considered [...] "Utsukushiki Mono" [...] as the most vocally challenging song she had recorded. She used much more of her falsetto range on the album than in previous works. The lyrics of the album were more [...] "heartfelt" [...] than her previous albums, in particular [...] "One Love" [...] and [...] "Happiness." [...] "Happiness" [...] was written with the feelings and mindset Ai had {{in the aftermath of the}} 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami.|$|E
2500|$|The {{track was}} {{produced}} by Wilson, who intended to encapsulate {{the feel of the}} Drifters' version of [...] "On Broadway". The instrumental was made on April 6, 1965 at United Western Recorders, requiring 44 takes before Wilson could deem a satisfactory performance. Problems had arisen from the tempo and guitar part in the introduction, which fatigued Wilson, engineer Chuck Britz, and the dozen-plus session players. The song did not appear to have lyrics or a title at this juncture, and Wilson can be heard calling the song [...] "Oh Yeah" [...] and [...] "You're Grass and I'm a Power Mower". Wilson remembers: [...] "When we got into the studio with Chuck, he said that he wanted Carl’s twelve-string guitar in the intro to sound more direct. I didn’t know what that meant. 'Can he play it in the booth?' Chuck said. I <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> about that before, but {{it seemed like a good}} idea. Carl was standing next to me in the booth and all the other musicians were out in the studio. I conducted it like an orchestra." ...|$|E
