5|$|Bone {{grafting}} {{is necessary}} {{when there is}} a lack of bone. While there are always new implant types, such as short implants, and techniques to allow compromise, a general treatment goal is to have a minimum of 10mm in bone height, and 6mm <b>in</b> <b>width.</b> Alternatively, bone defects are graded from A to D (A=10+mm of bone, B=7–9mm, C=4–6mm and D=0–3mm) where an implant's likelihood of osseointegrating is related to the grade of bone.|$|E

5|$|Jupiter is perpetually {{covered with}} clouds {{composed}} of ammonia crystals and possibly ammonium hydrosulfide. The clouds {{are located in}} the tropopause and are arranged into bands of different latitudes, known as tropical regions. These are sub-divided into lighter-hued zones and darker belts. The interactions of these conflicting circulation patterns cause storms and turbulence. Wind speeds of 100m/s (360km/h) are common in zonal jets. The zones have been observed to vary <b>in</b> <b>width,</b> color and intensity from year to year, but they have remained sufficiently stable for scientists to give them identifying designations.|$|E

This was some 2,000tons (2,032tonnes) heavier than the preceding King George Vs, and was primarily due {{to the increase in}} calibre of the secondary battery.|$|E
5|$|The {{adrenal glands}} {{are located on}} both sides of the body in the retroperitoneum, above and {{slightly}} medial to the kidneys. In humans, the right adrenal gland is pyramidal in shape, whereas the left is semilunar or crescent shaped and somewhat larger. The adrenal glands measure approximately 3.0cm <b>in</b> <b>width,</b> 5.0cm in length, and up to 1.0cm in thickness. Their combined weight in an adult human ranges from 7 to 10grams. The glands are yellowish in colour.|$|E
5|$|The gongs, themselves, {{although}} {{variable in}} pitch, are relatively similar in size.

40|$|A new {{technique}} is developed for examining non-climatic variations <b>in</b> <b>widths</b> of annual tree rings. For each tree core, the technique involves making an adjustment for regional climate as inferred from a regional chronology based on surrounding sites. The technique {{is applied to}} two stands in Gila County, Arizona, where air pollution is potentially a limiting factor on tree-ring growth. For the stand closer to the pollution sources, a marked decrease <b>in</b> tree-ring <b>widths</b> minus climate is evident during the period 1908 to 1920. Although this decrease coincides with a period when two smelters were operating nearby, air pollution cannot be definitively identified {{as the cause of}} the decrease <b>in</b> ring <b>widths...</b>|$|R

5|$|The {{length of}} the pitch, or field, for {{international}} adult matches is {{in the range of}} 100–110m (110–120yd) and the width is in the range of 64–75m (70–80yd).

In 2008, the IFAB initially approved a fixed size of 105m (344ft) long and 68m (223ft) wide as a standard pitch dimension for international matches; however, this decision was later put on hold and was never actually implemented.|$|E
5|$|The tornado {{that struck}} New Richmond would today be {{categorized}} an EF5 on the Enhanced Fujita scale, with winds {{in excess of}} 200 miles per hour, making it the third of only six EF5 tornadoes recorded in Wisconsin.

Most of the tributaries' gradients are high, but some are low or moderate and one is extremely high.

40|$|Variations <b>in</b> hypothallus <b>width</b> {{were studied}} <b>in</b> {{relation}} to radial {{growth in the}} lichen Rhizocarpon geographicum (L.) DC. in South Gwynedd, Wales, UK.

In individual thalli, there were increases and reductions <b>in</b> hypothallus <b>width</b> <b>in</b> successive three-month growth periods attributable to hypothallus growth and changes at the margin of the areolae. Total radial growth over 18 months was positively correlated with initial hypothallus width.

5|$|This {{species is}} {{characterized}} by its very small peridia (dimensions 1.5–3mm wide at the mouth x 2–4mm tall) with a color that may range from white to grey to pale buff, but never yellow – helping distinguish it from C. laeve.

5|$|Aonchotheca forresteri is a small, narrow-bodied worm. It is narrowest at {{the front}} and {{increases}} <b>in</b> <b>width</b> to about three fourths of its length. The cuticle, the surface layer, is smooth. Females are 13.8 to 19.4mm long, averaging 16.9mm, which makes them substantially longer than female A.putorii, and 55 to 70 (average 62) μm wide. The eggs are smooth, lacking the elaborate pattern on the surface seen in A.putorii, and are 53 to 58 (54) μm long and 21 to 24 (21) μm broad. The esophagus, the frontmost part of the digestive system, is 2.9 to 3.9 (3.6) mm long and is lined by 36 to 45 (40) cells known as stichocytes. The vulva is located 66 to 105 (83) μm behind {{the end of the}} esophagus and the anus is {{near the end of the}} worm, which is rounded.|$|E

5|$|B.spinulosa var.collina: Known as {{the hill}} banksia, {{it was first}} {{published}} as Banksia collina by Robert Brown in 1810, and retained species rank until 1981, when George demoted it {{to a variety of}} B.spinulosa. It differs from B.spinulosa var.spinulosa in having broader leaves 3–8mm <b>in</b> <b>width</b> that have serrate margins. The leaf undersides have more prominent venation. Its flower spikes are usually gold, or sometimes gold with red styles, especially in New South Wales. It is found in inland gorges and tablelands such as Carnarvon Gorge, Expedition National Park, Isla Gorge and Dicks Tableland in a remote part of Eungella National Park, in Central Queensland but coastal on the New South Wales Central- and north coast.|$|E
5|$|B.spinulosa var.spinulosa: The {{nominate}} race is an autonym, a {{name that}} was automatically created for the original material of the species as the other subspecies were described.

Northwards of the Hawkesbury River on Sydney's northern outskirts there is a gradation between this and B.spinulosa var.collina. It commonly has black, maroon or claret styles on gold spikes but all-gold inflorescences are seen, and leaves are generally narrower than other varieties at 1–2mm <b>in</b> <b>width</b> and have several serrations toward the apex only.|$|E
