50|$|Manufactured in {{different}} strengths, the surface may be slightly polished. This paper also wrinkles upon wetting. Suitable for pencil and <b>felt</b> <b>tipped</b> pens, and with limitations for technical pens. An eraser {{can be used}} for pencil lines. Ink is difficult to erase without damage.|$|R
5000|$|The {{generic term}} used for most {{felt-tip}} pens in Romania is [...] "carioca" [...] (pl. [...] "carioci"), after {{the brand name}} of the first commercialised <b>felt</b> <b>tips</b> in Romania during the communist period. In recent times, the English word [...] "marker" [...] has been adopted (spelled as in English but with the plural [...] "markere") and is used especially when referring to the permanent and highlighter variety of felt-tip pens.|$|R
50|$|The tools {{traditionally}} {{used for}} the part preparation process are very elementary: writing utensils (pencils of various graphite hardness, colored pencils, ink pens, <b>felt</b> <b>tipped</b> pens, electric and manual erasers, correction fluid and tape), office supplies (pencil sharpeners, staplers, staple removers, scissors, rulers, drafting templates, straight-edges, non-yellowing permanent and removable adhesive tapes, paper clips, packing tape, shipping materials, and property stamps). Typical office equipment found in an ensemble library includes a high quality photocopier capable of copying and printing paper of various sizes in duplex; papers of different sizes, colors and weights; binding machines (tape, coil, wire or comb); paper cutters; and computer(s) with word processing, spreadsheet, database and music notation software.|$|R

60|$|I {{thought of}} my poor mother and my sisters, at the old house in Killaloo--I <b>felt</b> the <b>tip</b> of his blade between my teeth--I breathed a prayer, and shut my eyes--when the tables were turned--the {{butt-end}} of Lanty Clancy's musket knocked the sword up and broke the arm that held it.|$|R
40|$|For {{organizations}} that care about innovation, individual creativity isn't enough anymore [...] {{people need to}} be in creative, collaborative relationships. For “virtual” organizations, collaborative relationships are a must or the organization won't survive. The world's greatest collaborations [...] Picasso/ Braque, Watson/ Crick, Wozniak/Jobs [...] relied on “shared spacesi where they could play with their ideas. Shared spaces, however you set them up, provide the neutral ground on which any and all ideas can be aired and considered. Developing a shared space for collaboration is about effectively using tools [...] from <b>felt</b> <b>tips</b> on napkins, to whiteboards, to specialized computer software [...] that can provide the shared space to keep all the good ideas, to cope with every objection, to handle conflicts as they come up, to make sure everyone gets their say and has it considered. ...|$|R

40|$|For {{many years}} I kept all my {{personal}} details, appointments and {{notes on a}} Psion Organiser. One day I started questioning the efficiency of this and my motivation for doing it. On analysis, (which I suppose I should have carried out before I bought it) I realised that, compared with a paper-based system, it took me longer to a) record information and b) retrieve it. But almost more importantly I realised that scanning information {{to build up a}} picture of say a particular week or month was not nearly as easy. As for annotating with a pencil or <b>felt</b> <b>tipped</b> pen [...] how I suddenly longed for the good old days and a paper-based system. I have now reverted to a Filofax, which even at the exorbitant price of • £ 22. 50 was still a lot cheaper than a Psion.   It is a random access device, with a large permanent storage capacity, is expandable and in easy-to-access hardcopy format. It is infinitely flexible. There are no batteries to run down and I can still get into it if I forget the password...|$|R
50|$|When {{the hook}} was cast into the pool, R. Ranusentika <b>felt</b> the <b>tip</b> of the hook pulled by a fish that was big, {{but when the}} end of the hook is {{retrieved}} there was no big fish, but a pendok or yellow gold dagger sheath that caught the eye of the hook. Since then the waterfall is named after the waterfall Cipendok. Curug Cipendok restored and opened to the public since 1984. According to officials Cipendok waterfall tour manager, the interest of visitors is increasing every year.|$|R
40|$|We make a {{numerical}} {{study of the}} effect that spatial perturbations have in normal Saffman-Taylor fingers driven at constant pressure gradients. We use a phase field model that allows for spatial variations in the Hele-Shaw cell. We find that, regardless of the specific way in which spatial perturbations are introduced, a lateral instability develops {{on the sides of}} the propagating Saffman-Taylor finger. Moreover, the instability exists regardless of the intensity of spatial perturbations in the cell as long as the perturbations are felt by the finger tip. If, as the finger propagates, the spatial perturbations <b>felt</b> by the <b>tip</b> change, the instability is nonperiodic. If, as the finger propagates, the spatial perturbations <b>felt</b> by the <b>tip</b> are persistent, the instability developed is periodic. In the later case, the instability is symmetrical or asymmetrical depending on the intensity of the perturbation...|$|R

6000|$|Here Mr. Scully (it may be {{said that}} he never made a speech without bragging about himself: and an {{excellent}} plan it is, for people cannot help believing you at last)--here, I say, Mr. Scully, who had one arm raised, <b>felt</b> himself suddenly <b>tipped</b> on the shoulder, and heard a voice saying, [...] "Your money or your life!" ...|$|R
6000|$|In this {{attitude}} he suddenly <b>felt</b> his hat <b>tipped</b> from his head, followed almost instantaneously by a falling slipper, and the distinct {{impression of a}} very small foot on the crown of his head. An indescribable sensation passed over him. He hurriedly {{stepped back into the}} room, just as a small striped-stockinged foot was as hastily drawn up above the top of the window with the feminine exclamation, [...] "Good gracious me!" ...|$|R
50|$|A pen (Latin: penna, feather) is {{a writing}} {{instrument}} used to apply ink to a surface, such as paper, for writing or drawing. Historically, reed pens, quill pens and dip pens were used, with a nib dipped in ink. Ruling pens allow precise adjustment of line width, and still {{find a few}} specialized uses, but technical pens such as the Rapidograph are more commonly used. Modern types also include ballpoint, rollerball, fountain and <b>felt</b> or ceramic <b>tip</b> pens.|$|R
5000|$|A {{highlighter}} is a <b>felt</b> <b>tip</b> writing device {{filled with}} transparent fluorescent ink. The first highlighter {{was invented by}} Dr. Frank Honn in 1963 and produced by Carter's Ink Company, using the trademarked name HI-LITER( [...] not Sharpie) [...] Avery Dennison Corporation now owns the brand, having acquired Carter's Ink Company in 1975.|$|E
50|$|These types {{include the}} ballpoint pen (often called a biro in many Commonwealth countries) and the <b>felt</b> <b>tip</b> pen. Both {{of these have}} subtypes which are popularly called by their own {{specific}} names, usually based {{on the type of}} their ink, such as the fluorescent highlighter, the rollerball pen, and the gel pen.|$|E
5000|$|In 2010, former {{radio and}} {{television}} presenter Steve Blacknell, Bush's first boyfriend, offered the original hand-written lyrics for the song for sale through music memorabilia website 991.com. The lyrics were written [...] "in hot pink <b>felt</b> <b>tip,</b> complete with Kate Bush's own little pink circles in place of dots over the [...] "I"'s." ...|$|E
50|$|Moreover, Nogier then {{published}} what {{he called}} the “Vascular Autonomic Signal”, a distinct change in the amplitude of the pulse, easily <b>felt</b> with the <b>tip</b> of the thumb at the radial artery. That mechanism would only produce a signal upon the introduction of new information to the electromagnetic field of the patient. Nogier then was working with the principle of matching resonance, and said that he could use the vascular autonomic signal to detect the active points of the auricular microsystem.|$|R
2500|$|Social scientist, Robin Burns, {{studied the}} social {{structures}} of Antarctica in the 1995-1996 season. She {{found that while}} many earlier women struggled, in 1995, there was more acceptance of women in Antarctica. Also by the mid 1990s, one of the station managers, Ann Peoples, <b>felt</b> that a <b>tipping</b> point had been reached and women on Antarctica became more normalized. There were still men in Antarctica who were not afraid to voice their opinion that women should not [...] "be on the ice," [...] but many others enjoyed having [...] "women as colleagues and friends." [...] Women around this time began to feel like it was [...] "taken for granted now that women go to the Antarctic." ...|$|R
5000|$|In the {{following}} years Home travelled across continental Europe, and always as a guest of wealthy patrons. In Paris, he was summoned to the Tuileries to perform a séance for Napoleon III. He also performed for Queen Sophia of the Netherlands, who wrote: [...] "I saw him four times...I <b>felt</b> a hand <b>tipping</b> my finger; I saw a heavy golden bell moving alone {{from one person to}} another; I saw my handkerchief move alone and return to me with a knot... He himself is a pale, sickly, rather handsome young man but without a look or anything which would either fascinate or frighten you. It is wonderful. I am so glad I have seen it..." ...|$|R
50|$|A gel pen uses ink {{in which}} pigment is {{suspended}} in a water-based gel. Because the ink is thick and opaque, {{it shows up}} more clearly on dark or slick surfaces than the typical inks used in ballpoint or <b>felt</b> <b>tip</b> pens. Gel pens {{can be used for}} many types of writing and illustration.|$|E
5000|$|... "Dry highlighters" [...] (occasionally called [...] "dry line highlighters") have an {{applicator}} {{that applies}} a thin strip of highlighter tape (physically similar to audio tape) {{instead of a}} <b>felt</b> <b>tip.</b> Unlike standard highlighters, they are easily erasable. They are different from [...] "dry mark highlighters", which are sometimes advertised as being useful for highlighting books with thin pages.|$|E
50|$|Highlighters are {{available}} in multiple forms, including some that have a retractable <b>felt</b> <b>tip</b> or an eraser on the end opposite the felt. Other types of highlighters include the trilighter, a triangularly-shaped pen with a different-coloured tip at each corner, and ones that are stackable. There are also some forms of highlighters that have a wax-like quality similar to an oil pastel.|$|E
2500|$|After {{experimenting with}} others {{translating}} her work, Rodríguez [...] "began the fascinating process of translating them self. It only {{took a few}} attempts to realize that [...] had embarked on something that {{could no longer be}} called 'translation.'" [...] As she translates from one language to another, she tries to find the appropriate wording and context in English that would correspond to the Spanish. However, her poems and stories started to have different meanings in their respective languages. She translates her literary work more than once, until [...] "I <b>felt</b> that both <b>tips</b> of my tongue and my two sets of ears were satisfied with the final product....this process mirrors my hyphenated existence.

And now that Jinny's coming home from Monticello, I feel that I can pay more {{attention}} to her--kind of take her mother's place," [...] said the Colonel, putting on his <b>felt</b> hat and <b>tipping</b> his chair. [...] "Lige, I want that girl to have every advantage. She ought to go to Europe and see the world. That trip East last summer did her a heap of good. When we were at Calvert House, Dan read her something that my grandfather had written about London, and she was regularly fired. First I must take her to the Eastern Shore to see Carvel Hall. Dan still owns it. Now it's London and Paris." ...|$|R
