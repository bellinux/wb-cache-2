5|$|As {{part of a}} 1996 {{initiative}} to curb illegal immigration, Clinton signed the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA) on September 30, 1996. Appointed by Clinton, the U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform recommended reducing legal <b>immigration</b> <b>from</b> about 800,000 people a year to about 550,000.|$|E
5|$|By the 1880s <b>immigration</b> <b>from</b> Russia, Eastern Europe, and Italy started rivaling <b>immigration</b> <b>from</b> Western Europe. Many of the {{immigrants}} from Russia and Eastern Europe were Jewish. In 1881 there were around 5,000 Jews in the city, and by 1905 the number had increased to 100,000. Philadelphia's Italian population grew from around 300 in 1870 to around 18,000 in 1900, with the majority settling in South Philadelphia. Along with foreign immigration, domestic migration by African Americans from the South led to Philadelphia having the largest black population of a Northern U.S. city in this period. By 1876, nearly 25,000 African Americans living in Philadelphia, and by 1890 the population was near 40,000. While immigrants moved into the city, Philadelphia's rich left for newer housing in the suburbs, with commuting made easy by newly constructed railroads. During the 1880s much of Philadelphia's upper class moved into the growing suburbs along the Pennsylvania Railroad's Main Line west of the city.|$|E

50|$|With Malaysia {{experiencing}} {{a wave of}} <b>immigrations</b> <b>from</b> China, the Middle East, India, and southeast Asia, and a wave of different colonial powers (Portuguese, Dutch, English), many other terms {{have been used for}} half-castes. Some of these include cap-ceng, half-breed, mesticos. These terms are considered pejorative.|$|R
5|$|In Brussels, {{situated}} in a predominantly Dutch-speaking area, 38 percent spoke French in 1842 while 61 percent spoke Dutch; many residents spoke dialects such as Marols instead of the standard languages. By {{the end of the}} period, social change and internal <b>immigration</b> <b>from</b> Wallonia contributed to the growing importance of French in Brussels.|$|E
5|$|In {{recent years}} the party still opposes immigration, {{particularly}} Muslim <b>immigration</b> <b>from</b> Africa and the Middle East. Following the Arab Spring (2011) rebellions in several countries, Marine Le Pen has been campaigning on halting the migration of Tunisian and Libyan immigrants to Europe.|$|E
5|$|Many {{immigrants}} openly flouted Mexican law, {{especially the}} prohibition against slavery. Combined with United States' attempts to purchase Texas, Mexican authorities decided in 1830 to prohibit continued <b>immigration</b> <b>from</b> the United States. New laws {{also called for}} the enforcement of customs duties angering both native Mexican citizens (Tejanos) and recent immigrants.|$|E

60|$|Such is {{the history}} of Europe, in all points; and such in philosophy. Its early records, almost perished, are of the <b>immigrations</b> <b>from</b> Asia, {{bringing}} with them the dreams of barbarians; a confusion of crude notions of morals, and of natural philosophy, gradually subsiding, through the partial insight of single teachers.|$|R
5|$|Sunday also opposed eugenics, recent <b>immigration</b> <b>from</b> {{southern}} and eastern Europe, and the teaching of evolution. Further, he criticized such popular middle-class amusements as dancing, playing cards, attending the theater, and reading novels.

5|$|The {{population}} (2,932 inhabitants in 2012) primarily {{consists of}} native-born Falkland Islanders, {{the majority of}} British descent. Other ethnicities include French, Gibraltarian and Scandinavian. <b>Immigration</b> <b>from</b> the United Kingdom, the South Atlantic island of Saint Helena, and Chile has reversed a population decline. The predominant (and official) language is English. Under the British Nationality (Falkland Islands) Act 1983, Falkland Islanders are British citizens.|$|E
5|$|With growing {{prosperity}} {{since the}} last decade of the 20th century, Ireland became a destination for immigrants. Since the European Union expanded to include Poland in 2004, Polish people have made up the largest number of immigrants (over 150,000) from Central Europe. There has also been significant <b>immigration</b> <b>from</b> Lithuania, the Czech Republic and Latvia.|$|E

5|$|Aarhus has {{the highest}} ratio of {{immigrants}} in Denmark, 14.8% of the population, outside the Copenhagen area. During the 1990s there was significant <b>immigration</b> <b>from</b> Turkey and in recent years, there has been high growth in the overall immigrant community, from 27,783 people in 1999 to 40,431 in 2008. The majority of immigrants have roots outside Europe and the developed world, comprising some 25,000 people from 130 different nationalities, with the largest groups coming from the Middle East and north Africa. Some 15,000 have come from within Europe, with Poland, Germany, Romania and Norway being the largest contributors.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of heavy <b>immigration</b> <b>from</b> New England and New York—regions where most major towns had {{originated}} as trading centers rather than political or manufacturing centers—many new settlements in Minnesota were laid out so as to heavily favor the business districts rather than the city halls or courthouses. This plan and the philosophy behind it spurred the growth of economic links between the communities and with {{other parts of the}} U.S.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} British cities, there was <b>immigration</b> <b>from</b> various Commonwealth {{countries}} in the post war years, which did lead to some racist tension. In 1963, a colour bar operated by Bristol Omnibus Company, which at that time refused to employ Black or Asian bus crews, was successfully challenged in the Bristol Bus Boycott, which was considered to have been instrumental in the eventual passage of the Race Relations Act 1968. In 1980 a police raid on a cafe in St Paul's sparked the St Pauls riot, which highlighted the alienation of the city's ethnic minorities.|$|E

5|$|Canada is {{a federal}} {{parliamentary}} democracy and a constitutional monarchy, with Queen Elizabeth II being the head of state. The country is officially bilingual at the federal level. It {{is one of the}} world's most ethnically diverse and multicultural nations, the product of large-scale <b>immigration</b> <b>from</b> many other countries. Its advanced economy is the tenth-largest in the world, relying chiefly upon its abundant natural resources and well-developed international trade networks. Canada's long and complex relationship with the United States has {{had a significant impact on}} its economy and culture.|$|E
5|$|Congress also {{settled the}} issue of Chinese immigration, passing the Chinese Exclusion Act in 1882. Arthur {{initially}} vetoed a similar measure, which he believed contradicted the United States' treaty with China, but eventually signed a later compromise bill, which banned <b>immigration</b> <b>from</b> China for ten years. Tariffs, {{a major issue in}} the campaign, remained largely unchanged in the four years that followed, although Congress did pass a minor revision that reduced them by an average of less than 2 percent. After a half-hearted attempt at the nomination in 1884, Arthur retired and died two years later.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the fact}} that the native {{language}} of {{a significant part of the}} country's population is Russian, the language occupies a modest role in Israel's education system. Hebrew University started teaching Russian in 1962. In public schools, the first Russian-language classes were opened in the 1970s in large cities. The number of students enrolled in these programs dropped in the 1980s as <b>immigration</b> <b>from</b> the Soviet Union slowed down. In the 1990s, a Russian-language program carried out by local governments called Na'leh 16 included some 1,500 students. In 1997, about 120 schools in Israel taught Russian in one way or another.|$|E

5|$|Duncan and Fogarty (1984) {{argued that}} the key {{difference}} lies in {{the contrast between the}} stable, flexible government of Australia and the poor governance of Argentina. According to Platt and Di Tella (1985) the political tradition and <b>immigration</b> <b>from</b> different regions were the key factors, while Díaz Alejandro (1985) suggested that a restrictive immigration policy, similar to Australia’s, would have increased productivity encouraged by the relative scarcity of labour.|$|E

5|$|Largely due to <b>immigration</b> <b>from</b> Hungary, Bohemia and Moravia, the Jewish {{population}} of Zagreb quickly grew in size: from 1,285 members in 1887 to 3,237 members in 1900, {{and then to}} 5,970 members in 1921. The synagogue became too small to accommodate {{the needs of the}} ever-growing community. In 1921 a renovation was undertaken {{to increase the number of}} available seats.
