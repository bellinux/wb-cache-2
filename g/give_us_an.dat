25|$|The Cascade phase {{took place}} from 7100-4300 BC, and {{was marked by}} a slight change in toolkit {{technology}} from the Windust peoples. A residential structure was found for this group, dating between 5500-4300 BC. Other pithouses followed between 4000-2000 BC. Most residential structures are located on rivers. During the historic era, plants and salmon were the staple foods, which <b>give</b> <b>us</b> <b>an</b> indication that Cascade groups harvested salmon runs {{in the summer and}} fall.|$|E

One depicts a round hut with a conical roof thatched in layers, while another depicts a rectangular house with rectangular doors and windows, a roof supported by beams that end in 'monkey heads', and a parapet and water spout on the roof. Both were found in Hawelti. Another depicts a square house with {{what appear to be}} layers of pitched thatch forming the roof.|$|E
25|$|Beginning at latest {{with the}} Seljuq invasions of Anatolia and northwestern Persia, a {{distinct}} Turko-Persian tradition emerged. Fragments of woven carpets {{were found in}} the Alâeddin Mosque in the Turkish town of Konya and the Eşrefoğlu Mosque in Beyşehir, and were dated to the Anatolian Seljuq Period (1243–1302). More fragments were found in Fostat, today a suburb of the city of Cairo. These fragments at least <b>give</b> <b>us</b> <b>an</b> idea how Seluq carpets may have looked. The Egyptian findings also provide evidence for export trade. If, and how, these carpets influenced Persian carpet weaving, remains unknown, as no distinct Persian carpets are known to exist from this period, or we are unable to identify them. It was assumed by Western scholars that the Sejuqs may have introduced at least new design traditions, if not the craft of pile weaving itself, to Persia, where skilled artisans and craftsmen might have integrated new ideas into their old traditions.|$|E

500|$|Critical {{response}} to the character has been mixed. BuddyTV staff columnist Don Williams deemed the addition of Bela a [...] "cheap ploy" [...] to attract teen male viewers, believing the character distracts viewers from the [...] "brotherly bond that made the show so special in the first place". As well, he felt her [...] "sexy cat burglar act, coupled with her flirtation with one of our heroes, is cliched and has been seen a thousand times before", and he likened her {{to a combination of}} Catwoman and [...] "the equally annoying Electro-Gwen from Angel". However, he later admitted Bela was [...] "a great comic foil". Diana Steenbergen of IGN became [...] "increasingly frustrated" [...] with the [...] "unlikable and manipulative" [...] Bela throughout her appearances. She found the character's tragic backstory to be [...] "too little, too late", but was surprised the writers were able to make her feel [...] "even a tiny bit sorry for [...] " [...] during her death scene. Writing that [...] "Bela had a hint of vulnerability that would have been intriguing had we glimpsed it more than 30 seconds before she died", Steenbergen wished the character had been written differently"not either annoying or downright contemptible"and deemed her [...] "a wasted opportunity to <b>give</b> <b>us</b> <b>an</b> interesting female foil for the boys". Karla Peterson of The San Diego Union-Tribune expressed similar sentiments, voicing her belief in her review of the third season finale [...] "No Rest For The Wicked" [...] that Bela [...] "got gone just as [...] getting interesting". In the same review, Peterson deemed the character to be a [...] "decent traveling [...] ". Although TV Guide's Tina Charles was annoyed that Bela continuously steals from the Winchesters and makes them [...] "look ridiculous", she [...] "really liked" [...] the character. Overall, she felt Cohan [...] "did one hell of a job".|$|E

2500|$|Ovid's Heroides <b>give</b> <b>us</b> <b>an</b> {{idea of how}} ancient and, in particular, Roman authors {{imagined}} Helen in her youth: she {{is presented}} as a young princess wrestling naked in the palaestra; an image alluding to a part of girls' physical education in classical (and not in Mycenaean) Sparta. Sextus Propertius imagines Helen as a girl who practices arms and hunts with her brothers:* Cairns, Sextus Propertius, 421–422; Hughes, Helen of Troy, 60; Pomeroy, Spartan Women, 28: [...] "In the Roman period, because Sparta was a destination for tourists, the characteristics that made Sparta distinctive were emphasized. The athleticism of women was exaggerated." ...|$|E

2500|$|What {{is left of}} Berossus' {{writings}} {{is useless}} for the reconstruction of Mesopotamian history. Of greater interest to scholars is his historiography, using as it did both Greek and Mesopotamian methods. The affinities between it and Hesiod, Herodotus, Manethon, and the Hebrew Bible (specifically, the Torah and Deuteronomistic History) as histories {{of the ancient world}} <b>give</b> <b>us</b> <b>an</b> idea about how ancient people viewed their world. Each begins with a fantastic creation story, followed by a mythical ancestral period, and then finally accounts of recent kings who seem to be historical, with no demarcations in between.

2500|$|The {{departure}} of the Arabs of Palestine from towns and villages during April - 15 May 1948 cannot be attributed to any specific reason. Rather, the exodus {{was the result of}} many diverse elements—psychological, military and political—which combined together to produce this phenomena. It was a result of the contradictory actions and reactions which destroyed all hopes in the hearts of the Arab population and urged them to flee aimlessly hither and thither. The way in which groups and even members of the same families fled, individually and in different directions can <b>give</b> <b>us</b> <b>an</b> idea of the degree of panic and horror which was felt amongst them." ...|$|E
2500|$|Eudoxus {{rose to the}} {{challenge}} by assigning to each planet a set of concentric spheres. By tilting the axes of the spheres, and by assigning each a different period of revolution, {{he was able to}} approximate the celestial [...] "appearances." [...] Thus, {{he was the first to}} attempt a mathematical description of the motions of the planets. A general idea of the content of On Speeds, his book on the planets, can be gleaned from Aristotle's Metaphysics XII, 8, and a commentary by Simplicius on De caelo, another work by Aristotle. Since all his own works are lost, our knowledge of Eudoxus is obtained from secondary sources. Aratus's poem on astronomy is based on a work of Eudoxus, and possibly also Theodosius of Bithynia's Sphaerics. They <b>give</b> <b>us</b> <b>an</b> indication of his work in spherical astronomy as well as planetary motions.|$|E

2500|$|In an {{interview}} with [...] in [...] "A Transatlantic Interview - 1946", Stein insisted that this work was completely [...] "realistic" [...] {{in the tradition of}} Gustave Flaubert, stating the following: [...] "I used to take objects on a table, like a tumbler or any kind of object and try to get the picture of it clear and separate in my mind and create a word relationship between the word and the things seen." [...] Commentators have indicated that what she meant was that the reference of objects remained central to her work, although the representation of them had not. Scholar Marjorie Perloff had said of Stein that [...] "nlike her contemporaries (Eliot, Pound, Moore), she does not <b>give</b> <b>us</b> <b>an</b> image, however fractured, of a carafe on a table; rather, she forces us to reconsider how language actually constructs the world we know." ...|$|E
2500|$|L.R. Farnell assumed [...] "that sun-worship {{had once}} been {{prevalent}} and powerful among {{the people of the}} pre-Hellenic culture, but that very few of the communities of the later historic period retained it as a potent factor of the state religion." [...] Our largely Attic literary sources tend to <b>give</b> <b>us</b> <b>an</b> unavoidable Athenian bias when we look at ancient Greek religion, and [...] "no Athenian could be expected to worship Helios or Selene," [...] J. Burnet observes, [...] "but he might think them to be gods, since Helios was the great god of Rhodes and Selene was worshiped at Elis and elsewhere." [...] James A. Notopoulos considers Burnet's an artificial distinction: [...] "To believe in the existence of the gods involves acknowledgment through worship, as Laws 87D, E shows" [...] (note, p.264). Aristophanes' Peace (406-413) contrasts the worship of Helios and Selene with that of the more essentially Greek Twelve Olympians, as the representative gods of the Achaemenid Persians; all the evidence shows that Helios and Selene were minor gods to the Greeks.|$|E
2500|$|The {{only reason}} that Angel didn't come back...it's a very simple thing. Because our ratings were up, because of our {{critical}} attention, Joss specifically asked Jordan Levin, who {{was the head of}} The WB at the time, to <b>give</b> <b>us</b> <b>an</b> early pick-up because every year they [...] wait so long to give Angel a pick-up [...] a lot of us [...] turn down jobs hoping that Angel will continue– he [...] didn't want that to happen. So, he was feeling very confident and he [...] just asked Jordan, [...] "Like, make your decision now whether you're going to pick us up or not," [...] and Jordan, sort of with his hands tied, with his back up against the wall, called him the next day and said, [...] "Okay, we're cancelling you." [...] Jordan's no longer there and The WB has since recognized...I believe Garth Ancier at The WB said that it was a big mistake to cancel Angel. There was a power play that happened that just didn't fall out the way they wanted it to. We wanted to get an early pick-up, we didn't. In fact we forced them [...] to make a decision, and with his hand forced he [...] made the decision to cancel us.|$|E
