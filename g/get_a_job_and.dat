Then I was paid enough to keep me, with rigid economy, for the next four weeks; but on the first occasion I failed to come up to time the allowance was to stop for good. It’s a system that has some advantages for the people who provide the funds in the old country, since it assures the payee’s stopping where he is—but it has its drawbacks for the latter. How can a man <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>job</b> <b>and</b> hold it anywhere outside the town if he must return at a fixed hour every month?
