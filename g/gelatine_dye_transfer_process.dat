50|$|After its reintroduction, the <b>dye</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>process</b> {{was used}} in several big-budget, modern Hollywood productions. These {{included}} Bulworth, The Thin Red Line, Godzilla, Toy Story 2, and Pearl Harbor.|$|R
50|$|The {{sound was}} {{recorded}} in the Movietone sound-on-film system originally developed by Fox Film Corporation, with color by Technicolor in their new <b>dye</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>process,</b> now known as Process 3.|$|R
50|$|By {{the late}} 1990s, the <b>dye</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>process</b> still had its {{advantages}} {{in the film}} archival community. Because the <b>dye</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>process</b> used stable acid dyes, Technicolor prints are considered of archival quality. A Technicolor print from the <b>dye</b> <b>transfer</b> era will retain its original colors virtually unchanged for decades with proper storage, whereas prints printed on Eastmancolor stocks produced prior to 1983 may suffer color fading after exposure to ultraviolet light and hot, humid conditions {{as a result of}} less stable photochemical dyes. Fading on some prints is so rapid that in some cases, after as little as five to ten years, the colors of the print have faded to a brownish red.|$|R
50|$|In 1997, Technicolor reintroduced the <b>dye</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>process</b> {{to general}} film production. A refined {{version of the}} {{printing}} process of the 1960s and 1970s, it was used on a limited basis in the restorations of films such as The Wizard of Oz, Gone With the Wind, Rear Window, Funny Girl, and Apocalypse Now Redux.|$|R
50|$|Technicolor {{introduced}} <b>dye</b> <b>transfer</b> in its <b>Process</b> 3, {{introduced in}} the feature film The Viking (1928), which was produced by the Technicolor Corporation and released by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Technicolor's two previous systems were an additive color process and a physically problematic subtractive color process, the latter requiring two prints cemented together back-to-back. Process 3 used an imbibition process pioneered by the Handschiegl color process, which had been created in 1916 for Cecil B. DeMille's feature film Joan the Woman (1917). Technicolor further refined the imbibition <b>dye</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>process</b> in its Process 4, introduced in 1932, which employed three simultaneously filmed negatives.|$|R
50|$|In {{the late}} 1940s, Haas {{switched}} from his medium format Rolleiflex {{to the smaller}} 35mm Leica rangefinder camera, which he used consistently {{for the rest of}} his career. Once he began working in color, he most often used Kodachrome, known for its rich, saturated colors. To print his color work, Haas used the <b>dye</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>process</b> whenever possible. An expensive, complex process most frequently used at the time for advertising, <b>dye</b> <b>transfer</b> allowed for great control over color hue and saturation.|$|R
50|$|In 1994, Eastman Kodak {{stopped making}} all {{materials}} for this process. The dyes {{used in the}} process are very spectrally pure compared to normal coupler-induced photographic dyes, {{with the exception of}} the Kodak cyan. The dyes have excellent light and dark fastness. The <b>dye</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>process</b> possesses a larger color gamut and tonal scale than any other process, including inkjet. Another important characteristic of <b>dye</b> <b>transfer</b> is that it allows the practitioner the highest degree of photographic control compared to any other photochemical color print process.|$|R
50|$|The British {{line was}} shut down in 1978 and sold to Beijing Film and Video Lab which shipped the {{equipment}} to China. A great many films from China and Hong Kong {{were made in the}} Technicolor <b>dye</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>process,</b> including Zhang Yimou's Ju Dou (1990) and even one American film, Space Avenger (1989), directed by Richard W. Haines. The Beijing line {{was shut down}} in 1993 for a number of reasons, including inferior processing.|$|R
50|$|Hare's Surrealist {{experiments}} in photography were {{only one of}} his many projects. In 1940 he received a commission from the American Museum of Natural History to document the Pueblo Indians of the American Southwest, for which he eventually produced 20 prints developed using Eastman Kodak's then-new <b>dye</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>process</b> (a time-consuming and complicated technique). In the same year, he also opened his own commercial photography studio in New York City and exhibited his photographs in a solo show at the Julien Levy Gallery.|$|R
500|$|The {{film was}} {{announced}} in 1965 as a [...] "Cinerama" [...] film and was photographed in Super Panavision 70 (which uses a 65mm negative combined with spherical lenses to create an aspect ratio of 2.20:1). It would eventually be released in a limited [...] "road-show" [...] Cinerama version, then in 70mm and 35mm versions. Color processing and 35mm release prints were done using Technicolor's <b>dye</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>process.</b> The 70mm prints were made by MGM Laboratories, Inc. on Metrocolor. The production was $4.5 million over the initial $6.0 million budget, and sixteen months behind schedule.|$|R
40|$|The <b>dye</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>process</b> is the {{photographic}} printing process {{used to produce}} the highest quality photographic prints to be submitted to printers for reproduction. <b>Dye</b> <b>transfer</b> prints are valued by advertising agencies for their highly saturated colors and ease of retouching. Photographers, museums, art galleries and collectors also value dye prints for the archival qualities. <b>Dye</b> <b>transfer</b> uses cyan, magenta, and yellow dyes to reproduce a color image. Photographic masking is used extensively for color correction, tone compression, and detail enhancement. The masks are projected with the original transparency to make continuous-tone separation negatives. Shallow-reliefgelatin positive-image matrices are made by exposure from light projected through the separation negatives. The matrices carry the dyes to the paper base for printing. The techniques used to produce the masks and separation negatives are so difficult, expensive, and imprecise {{that the future of}} the process is in jeopardy. Manufacturers of electronic color prepress systems and color separation labs would like to take over the market now served by the <b>dye</b> <b>transfer</b> labs. Existing computer graphics technology, however, cannot offer the same quality and capabilities. Electronic color scanners exist to simplify {{the photographic}} methods of masking and color separation. Electronic color scanning techniques techniques have reduced the time to produce color separations for printers from eight hours to thirty minutes. The amount of film used to make separations has been greatly reduced also. Analysis of electronic color scanning techniques could result in a similar savings of time and materials for <b>dye</b> <b>transfer</b> labs. Use of scanners to produce continuous-tone separation negatives for <b>dye</b> <b>transfer</b> would open a new market for scanner manufacturers and color separation labs. A less expensive method of producing <b>dye</b> <b>transfer</b> prints could allow a greater profit margin for the <b>dye</b> <b>transfer</b> labs and make the process more affordable for photographers. An experiment was conducted to determine if acceptable first -roll dye prints could be made from continuous-tone separations produced with a scanner. Comparison of the time and amount of materials required by the conventional photographic and scanner methods were made. Four judges with <b>dye</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>process</b> expertise determined that no significant differences of quality existed between a group of <b>dye</b> <b>transfer</b> prints produced by a conventional color separation method and a group produced by an electronic color scanning method. The hypothesis that separation negatives produced by electronic scanning will provide acceptable <b>dye</b> <b>transfer</b> prints that require minimal use of the printing controls, with greater consistency, than separation negatives produced by conventional photographic techniques for <b>dye</b> <b>transfer</b> prints was proved correct...|$|R
50|$|Eastman Kodak {{introduced}} its first 35 mm color motion picture negative film in 1950. The first commercial feature film to use Eastmancolor was the National Film Board of Canada documentary Royal Journey, released in December 1951. In 1952, Eastman Kodak introduced a high-quality color print film, allowing studios to produce prints through standard photographic processes {{as opposed to}} having {{to send them to}} Technicolor for the expensive dye imbibition process. That same year, the Technicolor lab adapted its <b>dye</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>process</b> to derive matrices and imbibition prints directly from Eastmancolor negatives, as well as other stocks such as Ansco and DuPont color stocks. Foxfire (1955), filmed in 1954 by Universal, starring Jane Russell and Jeff Chandler, was the last American-made feature photographed with a Technicolor three-strip camera.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Color {{matching}} between proofs {{and press}} sheets {{has not been}} a trivial task. Differences in colorants, solid ink density, and dot gain between hard copy output devices are some of the reasons that proofs and press sheets donâ€™t match. The Inter-national Color Consortium (ICC) has developed a system-level color management tool which is aimed at improving color rendering between various imaging devices. In this paper, the ICC-based color matching experiments were performed {{with the use of a}} four-color sheet-fed offset press, a film-based color proofer, and a thermal <b>dye</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>process.</b> Specifically, we investigated if ICC-based CMS can help an analog color proofer and a continuous-tone digital color proofer improve its color matching to a reference press sheet. Experimental findings based on observer analysis using rank ordering, and colorimetric analysis between proofs and press sheets were discussed...|$|R
50|$|The satirically violent sci-fi comedy Space Avenger (1989, co-written with Lynwood Sawyer) was {{the first}} film Haines made after going out on his own. The film was {{produced}} by the film restorer Robert A. Harris. Space Avenger received much attention within the film industry for being printed in the <b>dye</b> <b>transfer</b> Technicolor <b>process,</b> which yielded vibrant primary colors that never faded. Haines traveled to China to make prints of the film, a move which was covered by The Hollywood Reporter, Variety and Entertainment Tonight. The film was retitled Alien Space Avenger for its home video release.|$|R
5000|$|Hyde {{began making}} color {{photographs}} in 1948. In 1949, the California School of Fine Arts photography department supplemented its usual {{black and white}} training with a color photography class that Philip Hyde attended. The Sierra Club Exhibit Format Series began to introduce color photography to their books in 1962. In Wildness Is The Preservation of the World by Eliot Porter and Island In Time: The Point Reyes Peninsula were the first two nature photography books ever to contain color photographic reproductions. Philip Hyde's color photographs also appeared in Time and The River Flowing: Grand Canyon, Navajo Wildlands and other Sierra Club books before the 1970s. After spending time in the desert and discovering improvements in the <b>dye</b> <b>transfer</b> printing <b>process,</b> in the 1970s Hyde gradually transitioned completely away from black-and-white photography to focus solely on color. He {{is well known for}} collaborating with author Edward Abbey on the desert classic, [...] "Slickrock: The Canyon Country of Southeast Utah," [...] (1971) yet another Sierra Club book published to highlight the threats to wilderness, in this case, the Utah Redrock country of Canyonlands National Park, Capitol Reef National Park, and the Escalante River wilderness.|$|R
50|$|In 1975, the US <b>dye</b> <b>transfer</b> {{plant was}} closed and Technicolor became an Eastman-only processor. In 1977, the final dye-transfer printer left in Rome was used by Dario Argento to make prints for his horror film Suspiria. In 1980, the Italian Technicolor plant ceased {{printing}} <b>dye</b> <b>transfer.</b>|$|R

25|$|From 1970 {{he worked}} {{from his home}} and studio in Captiva, Florida. His first project on Captiva Island was a 16.5-meter-long {{silkscreen}} print called Currents (1970), made with newspapers from {{the first two months}} of the year, followed by Cardboards (1970â€“71) and Early Egyptians (1973â€“74), the latter of which is a series of wall reliefs and sculptures constructed from used boxes. He also printed on textiles using his solvent-transfer technique to make the Hoarfrosts (1974â€“76) and Spreads (1975â€“82), and in the Jammers (1975â€“76), created a series of colorful silk wall and floor works. Urban Bourbons (1988â€“95) focused on different methods of transferring images onto a variety of reflective metals, such as steel and aluminum. In addition, throughout the 1990s, Rauschenberg continued to utilize new materials while still working with more rudimentary techniques, such as wet fresco, as in the Arcadian Retreat (1996) series, and the transfer of images by hand, as in the Anagrams (1995â€“2000). As part of his engagement with the latest technological innovations, he began making digital Iris prints and using biodegradable vegetable <b>dyes</b> in his <b>transfer</b> <b>processes,</b> underscoring his commitment to caring for the environment.|$|R
50|$|Because of {{the added}} lighting, triple amount of film, and {{the expense of}} {{producing}} <b>dye</b> <b>transfer</b> projection prints, Technicolor demanded high film budgets.|$|R
40|$|Gap {{junctions}} provide direct {{electrical and}} biochemical communication between cardiomyocytes in the heart. Connexin 40 (Cx 40) {{is the major}} connexin in the atria {{of the heart and}} little is known regarding its regulation. Thus, the goal was to investigate the regulation of Cx 40 in both physiological and pathophysiological conditions. The first objective of this thesis was to determine whether Cx 40 gap junctions were regulated by Ã¢-adrenergic receptor activation. Cx 40 has previously been shown to be acutely activated by cAMP, this cAMP-induced increase in Cx 40 -mediated cell-to-cell <b>dye</b> <b>transfer</b> {{has been shown to be}} effected through the Ã¢-adrenergic receptor-adenylyl cyclase- Protein Kinase A (PKA) pathway in Cx 40 -transfected HeLa cells. The second objective of this thesis was to determine whether Cx 40 gap junctions were regulated by intracellular Ca 2 + concentration ([Ca 2 +]i). [Ca 2 +]i was increased by addition of the ionophore ionomycin and elevating extracellular calcium [Ca 2 +]o from 1. 8 mM to 21. 8 mM. This resulted in an elevation of [Ca 2 +]i and effected an inhibition of Cx 40 -mediated cell-to-cell <b>dye</b> <b>transfer</b> (IC 50 of 500 Â± 0. 72 nM) which was Calmodulin-dependent. The third objective of this thesis was to determine whether Cx 40 gap junctions were regulated by ischemia. Inducing ischemia chemically by inhibiting the electron transport chain with sodium cyanide and glycolysis with iodoacetate and 2 -deoxyglucose effected an inhibition of Cx 40 -mediated cell-to-cell <b>dye</b> <b>transfer</b> that was shown to be Calmodulin dependent. The main conclusions of this thesis were: (1) Ã¢-adrenergic receptor activation increases Cx 40 -mediated cell-to-cell <b>dye</b> <b>transfer</b> which requires the activation of PKA; (2) A sustained elevation in [Ca 2 +]i causes a partial inhibition of Cx 40 gap junction-mediated cell-to-cell <b>dye</b> <b>transfer</b> which was Ca 2 +-and Calmodulin dependent; (3) Chemical ischemia causes a partial inhibition of Cx 40 gap junction-mediated cell-to-cell <b>dye</b> <b>transfer</b> which was shown to be Calmodulin-dependent...|$|R

40|$|The glycol ethers 2 -methoxyethanol (2 -ME) and 2 -ethoxyethanol (2 -EE) prolong {{gestation}} in rodents. Because gap junctions in the myometrium likely facilitate parturition, {{the present}} study examined inhibition of gap junctional communication by 2 -ME and 2 -EE in myometrial smooth-muscle cell cultures. To measure gap junctional communication, the fluorescent dye Lucifer yellow was injected into cultured cells and the <b>transfer</b> of the <b>dye</b> to adjacent cells was scored with epifluorescence microscopy. The data are presented {{as the percentage of}} cells adjacent to the microinjected cell that exhibited dye following microinjection. A 30 min treatment with 32 or 63 mmol/L 2 -ME decreased <b>dye</b> <b>transfer</b> to 71 % and 63 %, respectively (pâ‰¤ 0. 05; control 90 %). Similarly, 2 -EE inhibited <b>dye</b> <b>transfer,</b> although myometrial cells were less sensitive to 2 -EE compared to 2 -ME. <b>Dye</b> <b>transfer</b> returned to control levels after 2 h in the continued presence of 2 -ME. The primary metabolite of 2 -ME, methoxyacetic acid (MAA), had no effect on <b>dye</b> <b>transfer</b> at concentrations equimolar to 2 -ME. Because 2 -ME and 2 -EE inhibited gap junctional communication only at high concentrations and because the inhibition reversed in the continued presence of the compounds, it is suggested that glycol ethers delay parturition by a mechanism independent of a direct action on myometrial gap junctions...|$|R

50|$|DH perfs: The Dubray-Howell (DH) {{perforation}} {{was first}} proposed in 1932 {{to replace the}} two perfs with a single hybrid. The proposed standard was, like KS, rectangular with rounded corners and a width of 0.1100 inches (2.79 mm), and, like BH, was 0.073 inches (1.85 mm) tall. This gave it longer projection life but also improved registration. One of its primary applications was usage in Technicolor's dye imbibition printing (<b>dye</b> <b>transfer).</b> The DH perf never had broad uptake, and Kodak's introduction of monopack Eastmancolor film in the 1950s reduced the demand for <b>dye</b> <b>transfer,</b> although the DH perf persists in special application intermediate films to this day.|$|R
40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that the {{insecticide}} lindane (ghexachlorocyclohexane) induces a biphasic inhibition of gap junction intercellular communication that is accompanied by oxidative stress. The present study investigates the hypothesis that depletion of cellular glutathione (GSH) is a mechanistic link between lindane-induced oxidative stress and inhibition of myometrial gap junctions. Exposure to 100 or 200 mM lindane rapidly (within 1 min) increased myometrial cell generation of superoxide, as measured by superoxide dismutase-inhibitable cytochrome c reduction, and superoxide production remained elevated for up to 60 min of exposure. To measure gap junction communication, Lucifer yellow dye was injected into myometrial cells, and <b>dye</b> <b>transfer</b> to adjoining cells was monitored. Cells were exposed to lindane with or without GSH modulators, and <b>dye</b> <b>transfer</b> was determined at the end of a 1 -h exposure to 100 mM lindane (acute phase) and 24 h after termination of lindane exposure (secondary phase). The acute phase of lindane-induced inhibition of <b>dye</b> <b>transfer</b> was prevented by GSH depletion with L-buthionine-[S,R]-sulfoximine (BSO) and enhanced by GSH augmentation with GSH monoethyl ester or L- 2 -oxothiazolidine- 4 -carboxylate (OTC). In contrast, the secondary, delayed-onset phase of lindane-induced inhibition of <b>dye</b> <b>transfer</b> was enhanced by GSH depletion with BSO and prevented by GSH augmentation with GSH monoethyl ester or OTC. Changes in cellular GSH by the pharmacological modulators were confirmed by high performance liquid chromatography. These results suggest that GSH is required in the acute phase but protects against the secondary phase of lindane-induced inhibition of myometrial gap junctions...|$|R

Those areas corresponding to the blocked out areas on the print remained relatively soft and capable of taking up dye. This dyed matrix film was brought into contact, in accurate register, with a positive print, to which the <b>dye</b> <b>transferred</b> in the appropriate areas. The print made several passes through the <b>dye</b> <b>transfer</b> machines, in contact with a separate matrix for each color. Usually, three colors were applied at the most.|$|R
