5|$|Before {{the start}} of the World Championship, each {{participating}} nation had to submit a list of players for its roster. A minimum of 15 skaters and two goaltenders, and a maximum of 20 skaters and three goaltenders had to be selected. If a country selected fewer than the maximum allowed, they had to choose the remaining players prior to {{the start of}} the tournament. After {{the start of the}} tournament, each team was allowed to select an additional two players, either skaters or goaltenders, to their roster, for a maximum roster of 25 players. Once a player was registered to the team, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> removed from the roster.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{being the}} most {{distinctive}} feature of Deinonychus, the shape and curvature of the sickle claw varies between specimens. The type specimen described by Ostrom in 1969 has a strongly curved sickle claw, while a newer specimen described in 1976 had a claw with much weaker curvature, more similar in profile with the 'normal' claws on the remaining toes. Ostrom suggested that this difference in {{the size and shape}} of the sickle claws could be due to individual, sexual, or age-related variation, but admitted <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> sure.|$|E
5|$|Henn {{left his}} job as Headmaster at Guildford Grammar School in 1925 and {{returned}} to England. However, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> kept away from Western Australia and returned again to become founding warden of St. Georges College, within the University of Western Australia. Henn retired permanently to Perth in 1933 and died in 1955, age 90. Henn's ashes reside in the Guildford Grammar School Chapel, with a stone slab to commemorate this situated {{on the north side}} of the sanctuary.|$|E
60|$|It <b>was</b> {{unfortunate that}} <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> have <b>been</b> removed to the Kenniston farm, {{where he would}} have been nearer medical aid in case he should need it suddenly; but <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> have <b>been</b> taken where he would have {{received}} more tender or devoted care then he did from Mr. Simpson and his wife.|$|R

5|$|In {{the absence}} of the King or {{government}} in occupied Belgium, Mercier became the predominant figure in the country and a symbol of resilience. Because of his status, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> arrested without an outcry and, although lured back to the Vatican in 1915 to remove him from the country, he soon returned. His writings were banned, however, and copies of their work confiscated. In 1916, Mercier was officially prohibited from publishing pamphlets but continued to campaign against the deportation of workers and various other German policies. Initially opposed by Pope Benedict XV, who was anxious to remain neutral, the Pope was supportive of the Belgian church but encouraged it to moderate its stance to avoid confrontation.|$|E
5|$|Nawaz Sharif {{resigned}} as Prime Minister on 29 July 2017 and nominated his brother Shehbaz Sharif as his successor, but as Shehbaz {{was not a}} member of the National Assembly, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> immediately sworn in as Prime Minister. Therefore, Abbasi was chosen by Sharif as a temporary Prime Minister for 45 days, which would allow two months time for Shehbaz to contest elections from Nawaz's vacated constituency in Lahore, be elected to the National Assembly, and become eligible to hold the office of Prime Minister.|$|E
5|$|On 12 July 1936, in Madrid, {{a member}} of the Falange named Jorge Bardina murdered Lieutenant José Castillo of the Assault Guards police force. Castillo was {{a member of}} the Socialist party. The next day, members of the Assault Guards arrested José Calvo Sotelo, a leading Spanish monarchist and a {{prominent}} parliamentary conservative; the original target was Gil Robles but <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> found. Calvo Sotelo had protested against agricultural reforms, expropriations, and restrictions on the authority of the Catholic Church, which he considered Bolshevist and anarchist. He instead advocated the creation of a corporative state. Calvo Sotelo was shot by the Guards without trial.|$|E

5|$|On graduation, Kraft {{accepted}} {{a job with}} the Chance Vought aircraft company in Connecticut. He had also sent an application to the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA), a government agency whose Langley Research Center was located in Hampton, Virginia; Kraft considered it to be too close to home, but applied as insurance. On arrival at Chance Vought he was told that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> inducted without his birth certificate, which he had not brought with him. Annoyed by the bureaucratic mindset of the company, he decided to accept the offer from NACA instead.|$|E
5|$|Sir William Rae, the Lord Advocate, {{followed}} a regular technique: {{he focused on}} one individual to extract a confession on which the others could be convicted. Hare was chosen and, on 1 December, he was offered immunity from prosecution if he turned king's evidence and provided the full details {{of the murder of}} Docherty and any other; because <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> brought to testify against his wife, she was also exempt from prosecution. Hare made a full confession of all the deaths and Rae decided sufficient evidence existed to secure a prosecution. On 4 December formal charges were lain against Burke and McDougal for the murders of Mary Paterson, James Wilson and Mrs Docherty.|$|E
5|$|The case {{came before}} Mr. Justice Owen and a jury at Leicester Crown Court in July 1990. The judge {{rejected}} a submission {{on behalf of}} the defendant that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> found guilty of rape due to the marital rape exemption. He then pleaded not guilty to rape, but guilty to attempted rape and to the assault charge. He was sentenced to three years' imprisonment for attempted rape and 18 months' imprisonment for assault, with the sentences to run concurrently.|$|E
60|$|He did try, poor wretch, but, obviously, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not.</b> There <b>was</b> no doubt, however, that he {{knew what}} to expect from the stern man before him.|$|R
60|$|Burton sighed. He {{would have}} given {{a great deal to}} have been able to prevaricate, but <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not.</b> It <b>was</b> the truth alone which <b>he</b> <b>could</b> speak.|$|R

5|$|De Iniusta {{states that}} St-Calais was {{brought before the}} king and royal court for trial on 2 November 1088, at Salisbury, the king having confiscated the bishop's lands before the trial. At the trial St-Calais held that as a bishop <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> tried in a secular court, and he refused to answer the accusations. Lanfranc, Archbishop of Canterbury, {{presented}} the king's case, declaring that the confiscated lands had been held as fiefs, and thus St-Calais could be tried as a vassal, not as a bishop. St-Calais objected, and continued to refuse to answer the allegations. After numerous conferences and discussions, {{the court held that}} St-Calais could be tried as a vassal in a feudal court. St-Calais then appealed to Rome, but his request was rejected by the king and the judges. Those judging the case held that because St-Calais never answered the formal accusation, and because he appealed to Rome, his fief, or the lands he held as a bishop, was forfeit.|$|E
5|$|In 1934, Abbe {{moved to}} Kyoto {{with his mother}} and his sister Toyoka so that he could attend Busen, {{training}} in both the judo and kendo programmes. Abbe learned kendo under the direction of Busen's head sword instructor, Kinnosuke Ogawa, a master who held the rank of 10th dan. He recalled that his instructor, at the age of 75 years, was so skilled that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> touched by any of the students or younger instructors. Every Saturday afternoon at Busen, following tradition, judo tournaments were held. Abbe fought five opponents in succession with each contest lasting five minutes, and he won all or almost all of these matches. In his first year at Busen, he was promoted to 4th dan in judo. In the autumn of his second year there, he was promoted to 5th dan, by which time he was reported to have been fighting 20 opponents in succession.|$|E
5|$|Josef Mengele was {{a medical}} officer {{assigned}} to Auschwitz concentration camp from 1943 {{until the end}} of the war. As well as making most of the selections of inmates as they arrived by train from all over Europe, he performed unscientific and usually deadly experiments on the inmates. He left the camp in January 1945 as the Red Army approached and was briefly in American custody in Weiden in der Oberpfalz, but was released. He took work as a farm hand in rural Germany, remaining until 1949, when he decided to flee the country; he acquired a Red Cross passport and left for Argentina; he set up a business in Buenos Aires in 1951. Acting on information received from Wiesenthal, West German authorities tried to extradite Mengele in 1960, but <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> found; he had in fact moved to Paraguay in 1958. He moved to Brazil in 1961 and lived there until his death in 1979.|$|E

50|$|Frutiger {{decided to}} return to the Caslon type's pattern of all horizontals being thick apart from those on 'a' and 'e', which <b>he</b> felt <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> fitted into this system.|$|R
50|$|And {{since he}} did not appear in court during the treason trial, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> convicted. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> have <b>been</b> convicted in a fair trial without himself being there to defend himself.|$|R
5|$|Magnus's {{campaign}} {{may have}} been part of his father's plans for an invasion of England, as control over the Kingdom of the Isles would have provided him with more troops. Historian Kelly DeVries has moreover proposed that Harald may have wanted to test the situation in England before a possible invasion, only to find that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> at war with Denmark and England at the same time. The expedition of Magnus never made significant landfall in England, but for English king Edward the Confessor it probably signalled renewed Norwegian ambitions from Harald Hardrada, who considered himself Edward's rightful heir. At the same time, the rise in power of Godwin, Earl of Wessex and his sons, in particular Harold Godwinson, had also started representing a threat to Harald's claim.|$|E
5|$|Meckiff's {{performances}} as {{the leading}} wicket-taker during the 1962–63 season meant that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> justifiably denied national selection on grounds of productivity, so the matter of his legitimacy had to be resolved. Meanwhile, the retirement of pace spearhead Davidson left a vacancy in the Australian team ahead of the 1963–64 home Test series against South Africa. In the opening Shield matches {{of the season in}} Melbourne, Meckiff took match figures of 5/102 and 6/107 against South and Western Australia respectively. His wickets included Test batsmen Les Favell, Garry Sobers, Keith Slater and Barry Shepherd. In the latter match he took the first five wickets in the innings to reduce Western Australia to 5/54. Despite his contributions, Victoria were unable to secure victories against either of their opponents. However, {{as a result of these}} strong personal performances, Meckiff was selected for the First Test in Brisbane.|$|E
5|$|R. v. Kent Police Authority, {{ex parte}} Godden (1972) is an {{instance}} of a United Kingdom case in which an order of prohibition was issued to avert action {{that would not have}} complied with administrative law rules. In July 1970, Godden, a police chief inspector of Kent Police Authority, was examined by the police authority's chief medical officer, who took the view that he was suffering from a mental disorder and thus unfit for duty. Godden was therefore placed on sick leave, although his own specialist found {{that he did not have}} any psychiatric illness. Subsequently, in January 1971, the police authority informed him that it would be appointing the chief medical officer to assess if he was permanently disabled, for the purpose of determining if he should be compulsorily retired. The Court of Appeal of England and Wales found that since the medical officer had previously formed the opinion that Godden was mentally disordered, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> impartial when assessing if Godden was permanently disabled. Thus, an order of prohibition should be issued to prohibit him from carrying out this assessment.|$|E

5|$|The Assistant Official Assignee, James Walter Davy Ambrose (later a High Court Judge), advised Choor Singh {{to study}} law. Singh read law books in his leisure time and began saving money to study law in England. This {{proved to be}} unnecessary; {{following}} {{a change in the}} rules, he was able to enrol as an external student at the University of London and passed the matriculation examination and, in 1948, the intermediate LL.B. examination. However, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> called to the Bar as a barrister as he did not have time to keep the required dining terms. On 20 May 1948, he was appointed a coroner. In December 1949, Singh was elevated to the post of magistrate, becoming the first Indian to hold such a position in colonial Malaya. He continued his law studies at Gray's Inn, and in 1953 was granted leave on a government scholarship to dine at Gray's Inn. After making four trips in two years, he became a Barrister-at-Law in 1955. In 1958, he was appointed a member of the Appeal Tribunal under the Preservation of Public Security Ordinance.|$|E
5|$|The regime did {{not limit}} {{itself to a}} purge of the SA. Having earlier imprisoned or exiled {{prominent}} Social Democrats and Communists, Hitler used the occasion to move against conservatives he considered unreliable. This included Vice-Chancellor Papen and those in his immediate circle. In Berlin, on Göring's personal orders, an armed SS unit stormed the Vice-Chancellery. Gestapo officers attached to the SS unit shot Papen's secretary Herbert von Bose without bothering to arrest him first. The Gestapo arrested and later executed Papen's close associate Edgar Jung, the author of Papen's Marburg speech; they disposed of his body by dumping it in a ditch. The Gestapo also murdered Erich Klausener, the leader of Catholic Action, and a close Papen associate. Papen was unceremoniously arrested at the Vice-Chancellery, despite his insistent protests that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> arrested in his position as Vice-Chancellor. Although Hitler ordered him released days later, Papen no longer dared to criticise the regime and was sent off to Vienna as German ambassador.|$|E
5|$|The war was {{not going}} well for the loyalists and the new regency {{government}} considered retreating to Ireland. Prince Louis and the rebel barons were also finding it difficult to make further progress. Despite Louis controlling Westminster Abbey, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> crowned king because the English Church and the Papacy backed Henry. John's death had defused some of the rebel concerns, and the royal castles were still holding out in the occupied parts of the country. In a bid {{to take advantage of}} this, Henry encouraged the rebel barons to come back to his cause in exchange for the return of their lands, and reissued a version of the Magna Carta, albeit having first removed some of the clauses, including those unfavourable to the Papacy. The move was not successful and opposition to Henry's new government hardened.|$|E
5000|$|Sir William Douglas, Knt., Lord of Nithsdale (d.c.1419), knighted when {{very young}} {{as he is}} {{described}} as chevalier in a safe-conduct dated 30 January 1406, when <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> have <b>been</b> more than nineteen.|$|R
