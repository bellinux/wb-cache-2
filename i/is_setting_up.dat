John then sends Kanyenke and the {{remainder}} of his mercenaries back east as he plants explosives to cause an avalanche and bury the Russians in the mountains. In the end, as John <b>is</b> <b>setting</b> <b>up</b> the dynamite, Warwick and several Boneguard approach him. Warwick attempts to kill John but John uses a barrel of gunpowder as a shield (knowing that Warwick won't risk detonating it by shooting at him), jumps to the trigger, and pushes it, detonating the mountainside; killing himself, the soldiers, and Warwick; and causing an avalanche. The avalanche buries the Russians and sets the Circle of Ossus back so far that they cause no problems for many years.|$|E

500|$|When Harry Manfredini {{began working}} on the musical score for the 1980 film, the {{decision}} was made to play the music only alongside the killer so as not to trick the audience into believing that the killer was around during moments that they were not supposed to be. Manfredini explains that the lack of music for certain scenes was deliberate: [...] "There's a scene where one of the girls [...] <b>is</b> <b>setting</b> <b>up</b> the archery area [...] One of the guys shoots an arrow into the target and just misses her. It's a huge scare, but if you notice, there's no music. That was a choice." [...] Manfredini also noted that when something was about to happen, the music would cut off so that the audience would relax a bit, which allowed the scare to become more effective.|$|E
500|$|Greil Marcus {{highlighted}} {{the importance of}} disregarding one's initial reading of the song. [...] "The first impression is that Bob Dylan <b>is</b> <b>setting</b> <b>up</b> the usual private scene: 'I'll sit here and watch the river flow.' Well, that's certainly a boring idea. It's the implicit message of just about everything James Taylor has ever written". He went on to describe how Dylan explores the difficulty of retaining privacy while making public art; the singer is {{coming to terms with}} unwanted attention inherent in stardom, without giving up his connection to his fans. Marcus argued that the reason the single was not a hit in the US was because [...] "the time has passed when people are interested in hearing Bob Dylan say he'll just sit there and watch the river flow... even though that's not quite what he's saying". For Marcus, [...] "Watching the River Flow" [...] is a compelling work, but the subtlety of the song may have prevented it from reaching a wide audience.|$|E
500|$|The gradual {{alteration}} of Rick was frequently {{mentioned in the}} critiques.

I’m not sure if the show’s going to make Rick an out-and-out monster, or if this <b>is</b> <b>setting</b> <b>up</b> some sort of redemptive arc for him in season three, but it’s a strong choice. The Walking Dead has tried to make us value this group of people, as if together, they mean more than they do alone. That hasn’t worked, so now it appears we’re going to try trial by fire." [...] By the end of [...] "Beside the Dying Fire," [...] Ryan concluded that [...] "Rick is becoming the leader he should have been from the start, and he's being clear and upfront about his goals and leadership style." ...|$|E
