The 2011 Local Courts legislation created Local Courts that would primarily handle nuisance crimes as well as crimes such as defamation. Some Malawian politicians and human rights activists have derided the bill, characterizing it as a plan for Kangaroo courts {{that could be used for}} political repression. Ibrahim Matola of the United Democratic Front has argued that the courts will provide too much power to local chiefs and could devolve into a [...] "draconian system". Opposition leader John Tembo has condemned the plan as incompatible with a multi party democracy. The Malawi Congress Party has also criticized the plan, claiming that it will unconstitutionally takes away power from the Judicial branch of government. The Solicitor General of Malawi, Anthony Kamanga, has disputed this claim, arguing that the Constitution of Malawi allows for the limited use of local courts. The Justice Minister of Malawi, George Chaponda, has also defended the bill, citing the fact that serious crimes will not be handled by the local courts as proof that there is no danger of human rights abuses. Chaponda claims that the plans are popular with most Malawians, and that his critics are not “conversant with the historical development of this country.” ...|$|E

One of the key development concerns impacting educational participation for children is health, with a developing strand of research focused on the effects of parental morbidity and mortality on child educational participation. This study seeks to add to this body of literature by investigating the relationship between adult health status and child educational participation in Sub-Saharan Africa, a region that is faced with particularly low educational attainment and high disease burden. Using data from the <b>Government</b> <b>of</b> <b>Malawi’s</b> 2004 - 2005 Second Integrated Household Survey, this study finds a modest and statistically significant negative relationship between head of household morbidity and child school attendance, and confirms parental education as a primary driver of child school attendance.

The results show that households which participated in FIDP had higher incomes and their food security status improved more than among similar households which did not participate in the program. The results further reveal that FIDP improved the wealth of participating households compared to their counterparts who did not participate. Those FIDP participating households engaged in livestock production, in particular, experienced considerable growth of income, which suggests that livestock enterprises coupled with income from crops could be an important pathway for improving the wellbeing <b>of</b> households in <b>Malawi.</b> Working paperNon-PRIFPRI 1; CRP 2; MaSSPPIM; DSGDCGIAR Research Programs on Policies, Institutions, and Markets (PIM...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} {{delivery}} of ecosystem services under different regimes of agricultural input subsidy in postindependent Malawi using (1) the protocol of the Millennium Ecosystem Service to characterize the services; and (2) the panarchy framework to describe the relationships among the political regimes, economic growth [gross domestic product (GDP) ] and food security. Ecosystem services are the benefits that humans obtain from ecosystems that support, directly or indirectly, human survival and quality of life. Panarchy is a nested set of adaptive cycles that provides a tool to explore the conductivity of ecological and social-cultural systems. The Malawian temporal political landscape has experienced several reorganizations since independence, in which the <b>governments</b> <b>of</b> <b>Malawi</b> have initiated socio-economic growth of the economy through implementation of different farmer input subsidy programs with variable success. The most recent agricultural subsidy program (2005 – 2009) appears to have shown an improvement in food security for the people <b>of</b> <b>Malawi.</b> However, this {{may be at the}} expense of an increased rate of decline in other ecosystem services, especially arable land resources and forestry. If agricultural subsidies continue to be implemented without a holistic understanding of all ecosystem services delivered to the whole country, then the system will be unsustainable. We recommend the ecosystem service approach and the panarchy framework as potentially useful tools for policy makers...|$|R
30|$|This {{study has}} shown that CBCCs, as ECD structures, which are {{established}} and managed by communities are playing {{an important role in}} communities by providing a pre-primary school learning environment and in 2006 / 2007 over 400, 000 children were attending these CBCCs. While Malawi specific studies have not been done to determine the impact of CBCCs on the future development of the child, it is evident that these CBCCs ensure that children have access to pre-school education, health services and nutrition. In addition to this, the CBCCs admit a considerable proportion of orphaned children hence they constitute {{an important component of the}} national response to the HIV and AIDS epidemic. Apart from the training of caregivers which is the responsibility of the national authorities, all other activities within CBCCs are being managed by community members; hence such a community-based and a community-owned approach to ECD programming can be sustainable as long as communities are mobilised to support and own the process. There is a need for the <b>Governments</b> <b>of</b> <b>Malawi</b> to invest in ECD in order to meet the MDG for poverty reduction, education and health.|$|R

Key elements of the Co-operation Agreement include regular discussion, learning and expertise exchange between the countries, and a Scottish Government (SG) financed International Development Fund, which supports discrete projects within Malawi. Under the auspices of the Co-operation Agreement, Ministerial discussion during the UN Climate Change Summit in Cancun in December 2010 highlighted the <b>Government</b> <b>of</b> <b>Malawi’s</b> target <b>of</b> increasing electricity access in Malawi from 8 % to 15 % of the population by 2015. It was agreed that the SG would consider how best it could contribute to this ambition through the Co-operation Agreement’s existing mechanisms. Against this background, the following scoping study was commissioned by the SG. The study commences with an overview of the broad energy and electricity sectors in Malawi, but its specific purpose is to understand how off-grid, community-level renewable energy technology can contribute towards meeting Malawi’s energy needs. To an extent, the scoping study also has its roots in one of the first projects to be supported through the SG’s International Development Fund. The University of Strathclyde-led Community Rural Electrification and Development (CRED) project aimed to improve the sustainability of rural solar panel deployments in Malawi by focussing on community engagement and empowerment, local responsibility and income generation. Learning captured through the project indicated that, aside from the obvious energy provision, community-level generation had the potential to bring considerable socio-economic benefits to rurally isolated Malawians.

40|$|This article {{addresses}} {{the relationship between}} the legislative and executive branches <b>of</b> <b>government</b> in <b>Malawi</b> during the multi-party era from 1994 until 2004. The argument is threefold. First, the presidential nature <b>of</b> <b>Malawi’s</b> political regime assigns parliament to a secondary role. Second, the general framework of parliamentary-executive relations laid down in the constitution gives scope for accentuating this subordinate position through iterative practices. Third, the persistence of personalised patronage in Malawian politics leads to the further reinforcement of parliamentary subservience where political principles and positions are sacrificed on the altar of venality. A perception has spread that parliament is a mere pawn in the political game or a rubber stamp of the executive’s decisions.

40|$|Background: Shortages {{of staff}} have a {{significant}} and negative impact on maternal outcomes in low-income countries, but the impact on obstetric care providers in these contexts is less well documented. Despite the <b>government</b> <b>of</b> <b>Malawi's</b> efforts {{to increase the number}} of human resources for health, maternal mortality rates remain persistently high. Health workers' perceptions of insufficient staff or time to carry out their work can predict key variables concerning motivation and attrition, while the resulting sub-standard care and poor attitudes towards women dissuade women from facility-based delivery. Understanding the situation from the health worker perspective can inform policy options that may contribute to a better working environment for staff and improved quality <b>of</b> care for <b>Malawi's</b> women. Methods: A qualitative research design, using critical incident interviews, was used to generate a deep and textured understanding of participants' experiences. Eligible participants had performed at least one of the emergency obstetric care signal functions a in the previous three months and had experienced a demotivating critical incident within the same timeframe. Data were analysed using NVivo software. Results: Eighty-four interviews were conducted. Concerns about staff shortages and workload were key factors for over 40 % of staff who stated their intention to leave their current post and for nearly two-thirds of the remaining health workers who were interviewed. The main themes emerging were: too few staff, too many patients; lack of clinical officers/doctors; inadequate obstetric skills; undermining performance and professionalism; and physical and psychological consequences for staff. Underlying factors were inflexible scheduling and staff allocations that made it impossible to deliver quality care. Conclusion: This study revealed the difficult circumstances under which maternity staff are operating and the professional and emotional toll this exacts. Systems failures and inadequate human resource management are key contributors to the gaps in provision of obstetric care and need to be addressed. Thoughtful strategies that match supply to demand, coupled with targeted efforts to support health workers, are necessary to mitigate the effects of working in this context and to improve the quality of obstetric care for women in Malawi...|$|R
