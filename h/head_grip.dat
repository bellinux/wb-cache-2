50|$|Grip {{strength}} increases or decreases {{depending on}} the arm position at which the grip strength is being measured. A person's grip strength usually results in having the strongest grip strength when their arm is extended at 90Â° before their body, {{as opposed to the}} other extreme arm positions, rested at one's side or held straight up above one's <b>head.</b> <b>Grip</b> strength is not optimal if one's arm is extended backwards beyond the resting position at the body's sides.We can conclude that grip strength is affected via the different arm muscles and their ability to contract.|$|E
50|$|The muscle-up {{begins with}} the arms {{extended}} above the <b>head,</b> <b>gripping</b> a hold in the overhand pull-up position. The hold is usually on a chin-up bar or gymnastic rings.|$|R

5000|$|The DP/LD is {{responsible}} for the overall lighting design, but delegates the implementation of the design to the gaffer and the key grip. The key grip is the <b>head</b> <b>grip,</b> in charge of the labour and non-electrical equipment used to support and modify the lighting. Grip equipment includes stands, flags and gobos. The gaffer will usually have an assistant called a best boy and, {{depending on the size of}} the job, crew members who are called [...] "set lighting technicians" [...] or [...] "electricians", although not all of them are trained as electricians in the usual sense of the term.|$|E
5000|$|The key grip is the <b>head</b> <b>grip.</b> Grips affect shadow effects with lights, and {{occasionally}} maneuver camera cranes, dollies, and platforms under {{direction from the}} Cinematographer. The term grip is used in slightly different ways in American and British or Australian film making. In the British and Australian film industries, a grip mounts and supports cameras, which can include anything beyond a basic tripod. Lighting in British and Australian film-making is headed by the gaffer, who {{is also part of}} the camera department. Grips can also be the people that do the laborious work on sets. These type of grips push, pull, roll, and lift various pieces of equipment under direction from a television director, television producer, or set designer.|$|E

5000|$|The M1877's early {{double-action}} mechanism {{proved to}} be both intricate and delicate, and thus prone to breakage. [...] The design {{had a reputation for}} failure and earned the nickname [...] "the gunsmith's favorite". Because of the intricate design and difficulty of repair, gunsmiths to this day dislike working on them. Gun Digest referred to it as [...] "the worst double-action trigger mechanism ever made". [...] Typically, the trigger spring would fail and this would reduce the revolver to single-action fire only. Outwardly, the Model 1877 shows a striking resemblance to the Colt Single Action Army revolver, however it is scaled down slightly and much thinner in dimension. The standard finishes were blued, with a case-colored frame or nickel plating. The bird's <b>head</b> <b>grips</b> were of checkered rosewood on the early guns and hard rubber on the majority of later-production guns.|$|R

50|$|The Little Giant was a {{vertical}} model which could accurately perform tension, transversality, and compressive stress tests {{with just one}} instrument housed in a single frame. The device was relatively cheap, compact, and simple to operate. Forces were applied to a test specimen from both above and below. Upper and lower loading cross <b>heads</b> contained <b>grips</b> which held the specimen and crushed it, or pulled it apart as the operator turned a handle attached {{to a system of}} gears. In 1880, Olsen started the Tinius Olsen Testing Machine Company to produce the device.|$|R
50|$|Some dead blow hammers have {{completely}} solid heads, usually made of rubber or resilient plastic (such as ultra {{high molecular weight}} plastic, UHMW), and rely on the inherent properties of the material to absorb shock and reduce rebound. Commonly constructed of polyurethane, dead blow hammers regularly appear in solid orange or black. Composite heads and fiberglass handle models are also available, with optional shock-absorbent rubber grips. A variant design omits the handle entirely; the dead blow <b>head</b> is <b>gripped</b> directly in the hand, for use in tight locations.|$|R
50|$|The {{binturong}} {{is essentially}} arboreal. Pocock observed the behaviour of several captive {{individuals in the}} London Zoological Gardens. When resting they lie curled up, with the head tucked under the tail. They seldom leaped, but climbed skillfully, albeit slowly, progressing with equal ease and confidence along the upper side of branches or, upside down, beneath them. The prehensile tail was always ready as a help. They descended the vertical bars of the cage <b>head</b> first, <b>gripping</b> them between their paws and using the prehensile tail as a check. When irritated they growled fiercely. When on the prowl they periodically uttered a series of low grunts or a hissing sound made by expelling air through partially opened lips.|$|R
50|$|Afzal Khan {{was known}} for his {{physical}} strength. During his campaign against Shivaji, one of his cannons fell into a narrow ditch near Wai. Eight of his soldiers could not get it out (lack of manoeuvrable space was one of the causes). It is said that Afzal Khan got the cannon out single-handed. Another instance of Afzal Khan's strength is when he held Shivaji's <b>head</b> in his <b>grip</b> while trying to stab him. Shivaji almost lost consciousness because {{of the power of the}} grip.|$|R
5000|$|After a quick {{elimination}} of two contestants, the couple Bridgette (Kristin Fairlie) and Geoff (Dan Petronijevic), a second challenge determined the team captains {{of the two}} competing teams: the Screaming Gaffers, headed by Gwen (Megan Fahlenbock), and the Killer <b>Grips,</b> <b>headed</b> by Trent (Scott McCord). From then on, challenges would alternate between [...] "reward challenges" [...] where winners would receive a special prize, and [...] "elimination challenges" [...] where the losing team would vote off {{one of its own}} in an elaborate [...] "Gilded Chris Ceremony".|$|R
25|$|Meigle 11 {{is another}} {{recumbent}} monument {{and is the}} largest of the recumbent stones from Meigle. The long sides of the stone have deeply recessed panels with wide borders that once were decorated but are badly worn. The top of the monument is undecorated and has a wide slot at one end. One side of the stone has the sculpted images of three mounted riders accompanied by a dog, behind them is a humanoid figure with an animal's <b>head</b> and <b>gripping</b> two entwined serpents. The other side of the monument is decorated with two intertwined animals followed by a dog and a bear, one above the other, and an unidentified object. To the right of these is a panel of twelve bosses encircled by serpents. At the extreme right is a wheel of seven bosses set within a frame formed of two upright animals with entwined tails and gripping the extremities of a human figure in their mouths.|$|R
25|$|The {{alternative}} is to donate the primary demand valve that the donor is currently breathing from, {{on the principle that}} it is known to be working and is immediately recognizable and accessible. The donor, who should be less stressed, will then switch to the secondary demand valve, which in this arrangement is generally mounted on a loop of bungee cord which hangs on the neck, and keeps the secondary demand valve tucked up under the diver's chin, where it can often be reached without the use of the hands, by bending the <b>head</b> forward and <b>gripping</b> the mouthpiece with the teeth.|$|R
40|$|AbstractCurrent {{methods of}} shaft fitting are only {{partially}} successful at matching players with optimal equipment. This {{could be due}} to player adaptation. Twenty-four players hit drives into a net with clubs of different shaft flexes. This was repeated with vibration applied. Club kinematics were stable across flex conditions with no vibration, and it is probable that players varied the application of torques during the downswing to compensate for changes in club mechanics. With vibration, for eleven players, club <b>head</b> speed and <b>grip</b> speed at impact increased with flex. This suggests these players could not apply desired torques, perhaps due to noise in proprioceptive feedback caused by vibration...|$|R
5|$|An adult {{dragonfly}} {{has three}} distinct segments, the head, thorax, and abdomen {{as in all}} insects. It has a chitinous exoskeleton of hard plates held together with flexible membranes. The head is large with very short antennae. It {{is dominated by the}} two compound eyes, which cover most of its surface. The compound eyes are made up of ommatidia, the numbers being greater in the larger species. Aeshna interrupta has 22650 ommatidia of two varying sizes, 4500 being large. The facets facing downward tend to be smaller. Petalura gigantea has 23890 ommatidia of just one size. These facets provide complete vision in the frontal hemisphere of the dragonfly. The compound eyes meet {{at the top of the}} head (except in the Petaluridae and Gomphidae, as also in the genus Epiophlebia). Also, they have three simple eyes or ocelli. The mouthparts are adapted for biting with a toothed jaw; the flap-like labrum, at the front of the mouth, can be shot rapidly forward to catch prey. The head has a system for locking it in place that consists of muscles and small hairs on the back of the <b>head</b> that <b>grip</b> structures on the front of the first thoracic segment. This arrester system is unique to the Odonata, and is activated when feeding and during tandem flight.|$|R
40|$|A {{finite element}} method (FEM) -based study {{has been carried out}} for the design of flat microtensile samples to {{evaluate}} tensile properties of Pt-aluminide (PtAl) bond coats. The critical dimensions of the sample have been determined using a two-dimensional elastic stress analysis. In the present testing scheme, the ratio of the dimensions of the holding length to the fillet radius of the sample was found important to achieve failure within the gage length. The effect of gage length and <b>grip</b> <b>head</b> length also has been examined. The simulation predictions have been experimentally verified by conducting microtensile test of an actual PtAl bond coat at room temperature. The sample design and testing scheme suggested in this study have also been found suitable for evaluation of tensile properties at high temperature. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
25|$|Entering the pro circuit, Djokovic {{used the}} Head Liquidmetal Radical, but changed {{sponsors}} to Wilson in 2005. He couldn't find a Wilson racquet he liked, so Wilson {{agreed to make}} him a custom racquet to match his previous one with Head. After the 2008 season, Djokovic re-signed with Head, and debuted a new paint job of the Head YouTek Speed Pro at the 2009 Australian Open. He then switched to the Head YouTek IG Speed (18x20) paint job in 2011, and in 2013, he again updated his paint job to the Head Graphene Speed Pro, which included an extensive promotional campaign. Djokovic uses a hybrid of Head Natural Gut (gauge 16) in the mains and Luxilon Big Banger ALU Power Rough (gauge 16L) in the crosses. He also uses <b>Head</b> Synthetic Leather <b>Grip</b> as a replacement grip. In 2012, Djokovic appeared in a television commercial with Maria Sharapova promoting the use of Head rackets for many techniques such as golf and ten-pin bowling.|$|R
60|$|His Eminence {{smiled as}} amiably, as unconcernedly as before. Throughout {{the length of}} a very {{distinguished}} career he had often been obliged to weather storms of royal wrath. He was none the worse for it, and knew how to let the floods of princely anger pass over his shrewd <b>head,</b> without losing <b>grip</b> of the ground on which he stood. Nothing ever ruffled him. Supremely conscious of his own dignity, justly proud of his position and attainments, he had, at the bottom of his heart, a complete contempt for those exalted puppets of his own political schemes. Mary Tudor, a weak and soured woman, an all-too-ready prey of her own passions, swayed hither and thither by her loves and by her hates, was nothing to this proud prince of the Church but a pawn in a European game of chess. It was for his deft fingers to move this pawn in the direction in which he list.|$|R
