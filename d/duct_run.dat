40|$|Empirical {{equations}} {{were developed}} {{and applied to}} predict losses of 0. 01 - 100 {micro}m airborne particles making a single pass through 120 different ventilation <b>duct</b> <b>runs</b> typical of those found in mid-sized office buildings. For all <b>duct</b> <b>runs,</b> losses were negligible for submicron particles and nearly complete for particles larger than 50 {micro}m. The 50 th percentile cut-point diameters were 15 {micro}m in supply runs and 25 {micro}m in return runs. Losses in supply <b>duct</b> <b>runs</b> were higher than in return <b>duct</b> <b>runs,</b> mostly because internal insulation was present in portions of supply <b>duct</b> <b>runs,</b> but absent from return <b>duct</b> <b>runs.</b> Single-pass equations for particle loss in <b>duct</b> <b>runs</b> were combined with models for predicting ventilation system filtration efficiency and particle deposition to indoor surfaces to evaluate the fates of particles of indoor and outdoor origin in an archetypal mechanically ventilated building. Results suggest that duct losses are a minor influence for determining indoor concentrations for most particle sizes. Losses in ducts were of a comparable magnitude to indoor surface losses for most particle sizes. For outdoor air drawn into an unfiltered ventilation system, most particles smaller than 1 {micro}m are exhausted from the building. Large particles deposit within the building, mostly in supply ducts or on indoor surfaces. When filters are present, most particles are either filtered or exhausted. The fates of particles generated indoors follow similar trends as outdoor particles drawn into the building...|$|R

40|$|This Strategy Guideline {{discusses}} {{the benefits and}} challenges of using a compact air distribution system to handle the reduced loads and reduced air volume needed to condition the space within an energy efficient home. Traditional systems sized by 'rule of thumb' (i. e., 1 ton of cooling per 400 ft 2 of floor space) that 'wash' the exterior walls with conditioned air from floor registers cannot provide appropriate air mixing and moisture removal in low-load homes. A compact air distribution system locates the HVAC equipment centrally with shorter <b>ducts</b> <b>run</b> to interior walls, and ceiling supply outlets throw the air toward the exterior walls along the ceiling plane; alternatively, high sidewall supply outlets throw the air toward the exterior walls. Potential drawbacks include resistance from installing contractors or code officials who are unfamiliar with compact air distribution systems, {{as well as a}} lack of availability of low-cost high sidewall or ceiling supply outlets to meet the low air volumes with good throw characteristics. The decision criteria for a compact air distribution system must be determined early in the whole-house design process, considering both supply and return air design. However, careful installation of a compact air distribution system can result in lower material costs from smaller equipment, shorter <b>duct</b> <b>runs,</b> and fewer outlets; increased installation efficiencies, including ease of fitting the system into conditioned space; lower loads on a better balanced HVAC system, and overall improved energy efficiency of the home...|$|R

5000|$|Power flue—Fanned flues use the {{pressure}} {{created by a}} fan to power the movement of outside air into the appliance and combustion products to external air. Thus air and flue ducts can be much longer, of smaller diameter, and include changes of direction. Most ducting is concentric; the air duct contains the smaller flue duct within it. Thus a leak from the inner flue duct will only leak the exhaust into the appliance rather than into a room. However longer runs are possible with two-pipe systems where the flue and air <b>ducts</b> <b>run</b> separately. Instead of using closed flues, some power flues use open flues, taking combustion air from the room housing the appliance. As with all open flues, the provision of adequate ventilation to supply combustion air to such appliances is vitally important.|$|R

25|$|The shaft was {{elevated}} as {{it moved}} toward the Confederate lines to make sure moisture did not clog up the mine, and fresh air was drawn in via an ingenious air-exchange mechanism near the entrance. A canvas partition isolated the miners' air supply from outside air (also allowing miners to easily enter and exit the work area). The miners had constructed a vertical exhaust shaft located well behind Union lines. At the vertical shaft's base, a fire was kept continuously burning. A wooden <b>duct</b> <b>ran</b> {{the entire length of}} the tunnel and protruded into the outside air. The fire heated stale air inside of the tunnel, drawing it up the exhaust shaft and out of the mine via the chimney effect. The resulting vacuum then sucked fresh air in from the mine entrance via the wooden duct, which carried it down the length of the tunnel to the location where the miners were working. This precluded the need for additional ventilation shafts that could have been observed by the enemy, and served well in disguising the diggers' progress.|$|R
30|$|Various {{problems}} may occur during esophagectomy {{in patients with}} an ARSA and NRILN. First, the working space may be restricted by the protruding ARSA in the left upper mediastinum, making completion of lymphadenectomy difficult. Second, the thoracic <b>duct</b> <b>runs</b> behind the esophagus and across the ARSA and esophagus {{to the right side}} at a relatively high rate [30] because the ARSA physically prevents the normal course of the thoracic duct and forces it to deviate toward the right side. Finally, as reported by Toniato et al. [18], the NRILN exhibits three patterns as it heads into the larynx: in type 1, it runs together with the vessels of the superior thyroid peduncle; in type 2 A, it follows a transverse path parallel to the inferior thyroid artery; and in type 2 B, it runs under the trunk or between the branches. Surgeons must carefully consider the course of the NRILN to avoid misconception. VATS-E in the prone position can help to confirm and preserve the nerves in the thoracic space because of the shared and enlarged view, especially in patients with anatomical variations.|$|R
