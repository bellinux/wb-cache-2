5|$|In {{the first}} round of the NCAA Tournament, Kansas faced Southern Methodist and was forced into an {{overtime}} period. Behind 36 points by Chamberlain, the Jayhawks won 7365 to advance to the regional finals. There, the Jayhawks defeated Oklahoma City 8161 to reach the Final Four. Chamberlain posted 30 points in the contest, adding 15 rebounds. The twotime defending NCAA Tournament champions, San Francisco, faced Kansas in the Final Four's <b>host</b> <b>site,</b> Kansas City. With a field goal percentage of almost 60 percent, the Jayhawks posted an 80–56 win to advance to the championship game against undefeated North Carolina, the number oneranked team in the country. Even though the Tar Heels were undefeated and ranked number 1 in the nation, Kansas entered the game as a 3point favorite, mostly because playing in Kansas City was a virtual home game.|$|E
5|$|McMaster {{purchased}} a large industrial park three kilometres east {{of its main}} Hamilton campus in 2005 {{with the intention of}} creating an array of research facilities for the development of advanced manufacturing and materials, biotechnology, automotive, and nanotechnology.

This decision helped spearhead the development of the McMaster Innovation Park.

500|$|To test if the xx could {{replicate}} their debut album's viral success, Young Turks' parent label XL Recordings approached technology companies {{and agreed to}} a deal with Microsoft to create a visualisation that could track sharing of the album's stream. The xx collaborated with designers from Internet Explorer and 9elements on the project. It was designed to show lines on a global map as Coexist is shared and was inspired by media artist Aaron Koblin's visualisation of flight patterns in the US. The album's stream was posted on a <b>host</b> <b>site</b> upon its release and shared with a fan in London through Facebook. The stream's <b>host</b> <b>site</b> crashed within 24 hours after the stream had been shared with millions of users. It subsequently reached social news site Reddit, where fans campaigned to share the album to every country possible. Label executive Adam Farrell of Beggars Group, Young Turks' distributor, cited it as [...] "one {{of the most significant}} album premieres we've ever done".|$|E

40|$|The {{dissertation}} {{argues for}} the following thesis: Velars to have a phonological representation where place specification may be accomodated, but this <b>hosting</b> <b>site</b> is left empty. In other words, I assume velars to be placeless in their phonological representation. This <b>hosting</b> <b>site</b> can {{have a number of}} formulations, depending on the particular phonological model. It can be conceived as a Place node, like in Feature Geometry, or an element tier as in Government Phonology, or a particular dependency relation as in Dependency Phonology. According to the thesis, velars share the presence of this <b>hosting</b> <b>site</b> in their representation with labial and coronal consonants (and with vowels, of course), while differing from labials and coronals in not having anything to occupy this <b>hosting</b> <b>site.</b> The thesis is supported by phenomena from a range of languages. The placelessness of velars goes against received assumptions where coronals are considered unmarked due to their absence of place specification. I will demonstrate that quite a number of the most frequently cited cases in support of the unmarked status of coronals do not seem to constitute firm evidence for coronal unmarkedness (and in fact for markedness in general). This suggests that if coronals are still to be considered unmarked, it will have to have a different reason...|$|R
