It was long enough for me to be glad, and yet to think it was no use--he would come up again. And he was come--farther off--the boat had moved. It was all like lightning. 'The rope!' he called out in a voice--not his own--I hear it now--and I stooped for the rope--I felt I must--I felt sure he could swim, and he would come back whether or not, and I dreaded him. That was in my mind--he would come back. But he was gone down again, and I had the rope in my hand--no, there he was again--his face above the water--and he cried again--and I held my hand, {{and my heart}} said, 'Die!'--and he sank; and I felt 'It is done--I am wicked, I am lost!--and I had the rope in my hand--I don't know what I thought--I was leaping away from myself--I would have saved him then. I was leaping from my crime, and there it was--close to me as I fell--there was the dead face--dead, dead. It can never be altered. That was what happened.

40|$|Bose-Einstein condensation, or BEC, has a {{long and}} rich history dating from the early 1920 s. In this article we will trace briefly over this history {{and some of the}} {{developments}} in physics that made possible our successful pursuit of BEC in a gas. We will then discuss what was involved in this quest. In this dis-cussion we will go beyond the usual technical description to try and address certain questions that we now hear frequently, but are not covered in our past research papers. These are questions along the lines of “How did you get the idea and decide to pursue it? <b>Did</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> was going to work? How {{long did it take you}} and why? ” We will review some our favorites from among the experiments we have carried out with BEC. There will then be a brief encore on why we are optimistic that BEC can be created with nearly any species of magnetically trappable atom. Throughout this article we will try to explain what makes BEC in a dilute gas so interesting, unique, and experimentally challenging. 1 The notion of Bose statistics dates back to a 1924 paper in which Satyen...|$|E
