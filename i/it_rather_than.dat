5|$|In 2002, Eduardo Duhalde {{fixed the}} prices for public {{services}} such as electricity, gas, and water supply. These remained fixed during the terms of Duhalde and Néstor and Cristina Kirchner, despite the crisis that motivated them having ended. As the inflation rate grew during the period, the state financed part of these prices with subsidies. Investment in these areas decreased, and the generation and distribution networks suffered. Argentina lost its self-supply of energy, and had to import <b>it,</b> <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> being able to export surpluses.|$|E
5|$|Lundomys molitor {{has been}} found as a living animal only in Uruguay and nearby Rio Grande do Sul; records of live {{specimens}} from eastern Argentina and Lagoa Santa, Minas Gerais, have not been confirmed. It is rarely encountered, and has been collected in only one location in Rio Grande do Sul, but {{this may be due}} to insufficient efforts to locate <b>it,</b> <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> genuine rarity. Its distribution is generally limited to areas with mean winter temperatures over , mean annual temperatures over , annual rainfall over , and a long rainy season averaging over 200 days. It is usually found in swamps or near streams.|$|E
5|$|As a legislator, Beshear {{gained a}} {{reputation}} as a consumer advocate, and sponsored bills to increase environmental protections and end the practice of commercial bail bonding. In 1974, Beshear voted against a resolution condemning the practice of desegregation busing because it called for changes to the federal constitution. One of his major accomplishments in the House was spearheading legislation to improve neonatal care at the University of Kentucky Medical Center. Although he considered a 1978 bill requiring the posting of the Ten Commandments in Kentucky classrooms to be unconstitutional, he abstained from voting on <b>it</b> <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> voting against it, a move he later claimed he regretted.|$|E

5|$|Due to its {{criticism}} of Albrecht and the event it portrayed, the painting often {{is seen as}} strongly anti-Prussian. While it appears to glorify Poland, it is also critical of the country. Matejko went beyond portraying the glory of a historical event and attempted to convey hints of how the country's history would play out in the future. This event was merely a hollow victory that failed to secure Poland's future. Matejko shows that the homage was an empty gesture {{and that it was}} Prussia that exploited <b>it</b> <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> Poland. Nobody in the painting is smiling except a lady of the court who is engaged in idle gossip.|$|E
5|$|The {{decision}} in Pepper {{has been linked}} to a positive move in statutory interpretation that had been proceeding {{since the end of the}} Second World War. Previously, the dominant approach was that of the literal rule, supplemented by the golden and mischief rules (that interpretations should not be made if they were to lead to absurdity, and that interpretations should take into account the intention behind the statute). These approaches all limited the amount of material which could be used by a judge when interpreting the actions of Parliament. Following the 1969 Law Commission report The Interpretation of Statutes, British courts began to use a more purposive approach, which directed that when interpreting a statute they should examine the purpose behind <b>it,</b> <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> simply using the text of the statute itself. In effect, this widened the amount of material judges could use, including not only the statute but reports made by government bodies, the Law Commission and Royal Commissions. The impact of Pepper was to include Hansard in this list of acceptable material, not only to establish the overall purpose of an act but to define what was meant by a particular provision.|$|E

25|$|Although the Kingdom of Ireland {{never had}} an {{official}} flag, this flag is recorded as the flag of Ireland by 18th and 19th century sources. It {{was used as a}} naval jack and {{as the basis for the}} unofficial green ensign of Ireland, particularly during the 18th and 19th centuries. The flag is identical to the arms of the province of Leinster. It is believed that the Leinster arms are derived from <b>it,</b> <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> the other way around.|$|E
25|$|The word base of Esperanto was {{originally}} defined by Lingvo internacia, published by L. L. Zamenhof in 1887. It contained some 900 root words. The {{rules of the}} language allow speakers to borrow words as needed, recommending only that they look for the most international words, and that they borrow one basic word and derive others from <b>it,</b> <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> borrowing many words with related meanings. In 1894, Zamenhof published the first Esperanto dictionary, Universala vortaro, which was written in five languages and supplied a larger set of root words.|$|E

25|$|Anand {{opened with}} 1.e4, and Carlsen responded with the Caro–Kann Defence, {{his first time}} doing so in a {{competitive}} game since 2011. Anand castled queenside on move 14, which {{was followed by a}} knight exchange in the centre, after which Carlsen advanced his queen to d5 (see diagram). This enabled a trade of queens, and, to the surprise of commentators and the audience, Anand accepted <b>it,</b> <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> pressing forward with 18.Qg4. The resulting endgame was balanced; Anand exerted pressure on Carlsen's kingside pawn shield with his rooks, eliciting a repetition of moves and a draw.|$|E
25|$|In shaping legislation, Rayburn {{preferred}} working {{quietly in}} the background to being in the public spotlight. As Speaker, he won a reputation for fairness and integrity.

After he died his estate was valued at just under $300,000, which was mostly land he owned, and the amount of cash he had in various checking accounts was just over $26,000.|$|E

25|$|Auditory pareidolia is a {{situation}} created when the brain incorrectly interprets random patterns as being familiar patterns. In the case of EVP it could result in an observer interpreting random noise on an audio recording as being the familiar sound of a human voice. The propensity for an apparent voice heard in white noise recordings {{to be in a}} language understood well by those researching <b>it,</b> <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> in an unfamiliar language, has been cited as evidence of this, and a broad class of phenomena referred to by author Joe Banks as Rorschach Audio {{has been described as a}} global explanation for all manifestations of EVP.|$|E
25|$|In County Wexford, 100–200 Volunteers—led by Robert Brennan, Séamus Doyle and Seán Etchingham—took {{over the}} town of Enniscorthy on Thursday 27 April until Sunday. Volunteer officer Paul Galligan had cycled 200km from rebel {{headquarters}} in Dublin with orders to mobilise. They blocked all roads into the town and made a brief attack on the RIC barracks, but chose to blockade <b>it</b> <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> attempt to capture it. They flew the tricolour over the Athenaeum building, which they had made their headquarters, and paraded uniformed in the streets. They also occupied Vinegar Hill, where the United Irishmen had made a last stand in the 1798 rebellion. The public largely supported the rebels and many local men offered to join them.|$|E
25|$|The wildcat {{does not}} dig its own burrows, instead {{sheltering}} in the hollows of old or fallen trees, rock fissures, and the abandoned nests or earths {{of other animals}} (heron nests, and abandoned fox or badger earths in Europe, and abandoned fennec dens in Africa). When threatened, a wildcat with a den will retreat into <b>it,</b> <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> climb trees. When taking residence in a tree hollow, the wildcat selects one low to the ground. Dens in rocks or burrows are lined with dry grasses and bird feathers. Dens in tree hollows usually contain enough sawdust to make lining unnecessary. During flea infestations, the wildcat leaves its den in favour of another. During winter, when snowfall prevents the wildcat from travelling long distances, it remains within its den more than usual.|$|E
