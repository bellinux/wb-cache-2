40|$|Background: Traditional pleurodesis for {{malignant}} {{pleural effusion}} is performed by large-bore chest tube insertion with the instillation of sclerosing agents after the compressed lung re-expansion and pleural fluid drainage of 100 - 150 ml/day. This study {{was carried out}} to evaluate the possibility of rapid sclerotherapy for malignant pleural effusions by insertion of a small-bore Elecath tube (12 -French) under ultrasound guidance and <b>intrapleural</b> <b>injection</b> of bleomycin 60 IU. Methods: Twenty-six patients, with 28 cytopathologically proven malignant pleural effusions (two patients had bilateral pleural effusions) and receiving the insertion of the Elecath tube for drainage, were included in our series. This rapid and short-term sclerosing method was performed and completed by <b>intrapleural</b> <b>injection</b> of bleomycin when the pleural effusion had been clearly drained by the small-bore Elecath tube and the compressed lung had fully re-expanded on follow-up chest radiographs.

40|$|Purpose: Aim of {{the study}} was to {{determine}} the role of surgery in the management of congenital chylothorax (CC). Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the data of patients with CC requiring medical or surgical treatment postnatally in our institution between January 2001 and March 2009. Results: Ten patients were treated for CC. We divided our population into 2 groups: group A consisted of patients in whom CC healed after conservative medical treatment (thoracocentesis, pleural drainage, total parental nutrition, somatostatin, <b>intrapleural</b> <b>injections</b> of povidone-iodine), and group B of patients who needed both medical and surgical treatment (pleural abrasion and/or pleurectomy). Conservative postnatal therapy was successful in 50 % of cases. Of the 3 patients treated preoperatively with <b>intrapleural</b> <b>injections</b> of povidone-iodine, 2 presented with severe complications. Surgical treatment was successful in all cases, with no surgical complications. Patients in group B had a significantly lower birth term (p= 0. 0254) and birth weight (p= 0. 0021) compared to patients in group A. Patients with a massive chylothorax (≥ 50 mL/kg/day) needed surgery significantly more often than those with chylothorax 50 mL/kg/day.

40|$|Background and objective: Vascular endothelial {{growth factor}} (VEGF) {{is known to}} {{increase}} vascular permeability and promote angiogenesis. It is expressed in most types of pleural effusions. However, the exact role of VEGF {{in the development of}} pleural effusions has yet to be determined. The anti-VEGF mAb, bevacizumab, has been used in the treatment of cancer to reduce local angiogenesis and tumour progression. This study describes the acute effects of VEGF blockade on the expression of inflammatory cytokines and pleural fluid accumulation. Methods: One hundred and twelve New Zealand rabbits received <b>intrapleural</b> <b>injections</b> of either talc or silver nitrate. In each group, half the animals received an intravenous injection of bevacizumab, 30 min before the intrapleural agent was administered. Five animals from each subgroup were sacrificed 1, 2, 3, 4 or 7 days after the procedure. Twelve rabbits were used to evaluate vascular permeability using Evans`s blue dye. Pleural fluid volume and cytokines were quantified. Results: Animals pretreated with anti-VEGF antibody showed significant reductions in pleural fluid volumes after talc or silver nitrate injection. IL- 8 levels, vascular permeability and macroscopic pleural adhesion scores were also reduced in the groups that received bevacizumab. Conclusions: This study showed that bevacizumab interferes in the acute phase of pleural inflammation induced by silver nitrate or talc, reinforcing the role of VEGF as a key mediator in the production of pleural effusions. The results also suggest that bevacizumab should probably be avoided in patients requiring pleurodesis.

METHODS: Twenty-four patients were divided into three similar groups, {{and all of them}} received intravenous dipyrone. Group A received intravenous tramadol and <b>intrapleural</b> <b>injection</b> of saline solution. Group B received <b>intrapleural</b> <b>injection</b> of 0. 33 % ropivacaine, and Group C 0. 5 % ropivacaine. The following aspects were analyzed: inspiratory capacity, respiratory rate and pain. Pain was evaluated in the immediate postoperative period by means of the visual analog scale and over a one-week period. RESULTS: In Groups A and B, reduced inspiratory capacity was observed in the postoperative period. In the first postoperative 12 hours, only 12. 5 % of the patients in Groups B and C showed intense pain as compared to 25 % in Group A.

30|$|Administration of ZOL in the pleural cavity has {{not been}} {{examined}} in human being. A high concentration of ZOL may produce adverse reactions since ZOL can induce inflammatory responses by producing proinflammatory cytokines (Scheller et al. 2011). A clinical study was conducted for gastric cancer patients with malignant ascites with intraperitoneal injection of ZOL at 1  mg for priming cytotoxic γδ Τcells (Wada et al. 2014). The study showed that the ZOL administered into the peritoneal cavity did not clinically produce any adverse effects but induced recruitment of neutrophil in the peritoneal cavity. Norton et al. (2012) also reported that alendronate, an US Food and Drug Administration-approved bisphosphonate, induced inflammatory reactions in the peritoneal cavity in mice. We thereby investigated possible adverse effects induced by <b>intrapleural</b> <b>injections</b> of ZOL with BALB/c nude mice. Administration of 80  μg ZOL in 100  μl of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) produced adhesion between pleura and pericardium in {{a majority of the}} mice tested, but 40  μg of ZOL did not induce the adhesion. Heart weights also increased in mice injected with ZOL at 40  μg (experiment 2) on day 28 compared with those with PBS, but the mild cardiomegaly was not detected on day 35 (experiment 3). An average heart weight of mice that received ZOL at 15  μg was even lower than that of mice injected with PBS. The mechanism of weight gain of heart in mice is unknown but it may be associated with a possible congestive heart failure listed as one of the serious adverse effects of ZOL in human.|$|R

From February to May of 1996, 15 NSCLC patients with malignant pleural effusions were enrolled on study. After adequate drainage and assurance of lung re-expansion, paclitaxel 125 mg m− 2 diluted in normal saline was infused through a preinserted pig-tail catheter which was removed 2 h later. Chest radiography and sonography were scheduled 4 days later; depending on whether there remained {{a significant amount of}} pleural effusion, further drainage by needle thoracentesis or by a pig-tail catheter was performed. All patients were assessable for toxicity. Ipsilateral chest and/or shoulder pain, fever, facial flushing and nausea were the most frequent side-effects. Grade 4 neutropenia, grade 3 anaemia, and grade 3 renal impairment occurred in one patient each. Fourteen patients were evaluable for response {{at the end of the}} fourth week. Overall response rate of pleural effusion in evaluable patients was 92 · 9 %, with a complete response rate of 28 · 6 %. There was one out of 14 evaluable patients whose measurable tumour lesion decreased by more than 50 % (partial response). No disease progression was noted among evaluable patients at the end of the fourth week. It is concluded that paclitaxel is a useful agent for the treatment of malignant pleural effusions.

OK- 432 (0. 1 mg, n = 6) or saline vehicle (n = 7) was infused in the fetal pleura, and fetuses were monitored for 7 days. Blood samples were taken routinely for plasma nitrite measurement. Fetal brains were taken for histological assessment {{at the end of the}} experiment. Between 3 and 7 h postinjection, OK- 432 administration was associated with transient suppression of fetal body and breathing movements and electtroencephalogram activity (P < 0. 05), increased carotid and femoral vascular resistance (P < 0. 05), but no change in blood pressure. Brain activity and behavior then returned to normal except in one fetus that developed seizures. OK- 432 fetuses showed progressive, sustained vasodilatation (P < 0. 05), with lower blood pressure after 4 days (P < 0. 05), but normal heart rate. There were no changes in plasma nitrite levels. Histological studies showed bilateral infarction in the dorsal limb of the hippocampus of the fetus that developed seizures, but no injury in other fetuses.

The present study investigates a role for PAF in driving eotaxin production and eosinophil recruitment in an allergic pleurisy model in mice. The <b>intrapleural</b> <b>injection</b> of increasing doses of PAF (10 − 11 to 10 − 9 moles per cavity) induced a dose- and PAF receptor-dependent recruitment of eosinophils 48 [*]h after stimulation. <b>Intrapleural</b> <b>injection</b> of PAF induced the rapid (within 1 [*]h) release of eotaxin into the pleural cavity of mice and an anti-eotaxin antibody effectively inhibited PAF-induced recruitment of eosinophils. Eosinophil recruitment in the allergic pleurisy was markedly inhibited by the PAF receptor antagonist UK- 74, 505 (modipafant, 1 [*]mg[*]kg− 1). Moreover, recruitment of eosinophils in sensitized and challenged PAF receptor-deficient animals was lower than that observed in wild-type animals. Blockade of PAF receptors with UK- 74, 505 suppressed by 85 % the release of eotaxin in the allergic pleurisy. Finally, the injection of a sub-threshold dose of PAF and eotaxin cooperated to induce eosinophil recruitment in vivo. In conclusion, the production of PAF in an allergic reaction could function in multiple ways to facilitate the recruitment of eosinophils [*]–[*] by facilitating eotaxin release and by cooperating with eotaxin to induce greater recruitment of eosinophils...|$|E

40|$|Summary. - 256 Wistar rats {{received}} a single injection {{into the right}} pleural cavity of UICC crocidolite in order to induce mesotheliomas. They were then given right <b>intrapleural</b> <b>injections</b> of BCG, crystalline silica, talc, carrageenan or saline (as a control). There was no {{significant change in the}} mesothelioma rate in the rats exposed to BCG, silica or talc, but there was a 3 -fold increase in mesothelioma incidence in the group injected with carrageenan. MESOTHELIOMAS are readily produced in rats by the intrapleural inoculation of asbestos (XVagner et al., 1973). The experiments described in this paper were carried out to test whether the rate of induction of mesotheliomas could be altered by various secondary treatments. It was hoped by this exploration to find means of delaying tuimour induction and thus possibly reducing the incidence. At present only sham thymectomy during the first 4 days after birth has been shown {{to reduce the number of}} mesotheliomas induced by the asbestos (Wagner, 1979). This paper explores the role played by some of the substances which destroy or alter the function of macrophages. The role of macrophages in the development of asbestos-induced pleural mesotheliomas is unknown. In serial killings it was found that neoplastic growth initially appeared at the periphery of fibre-containing granulomas. From personal observations (J. C. WVagner) it appeared that when tumours first appeared, the number of macrophages in the granulomas was greatly reduced. Perhaps the decreased number of phagocytic cells might effect initiation of the tumour, as well as rejection of tumour cells. We decided, therefore, to introduce the treatments before tumour development.

40|$|The mode {{of action}} of {{inorganic}} fibers as carcinogens is unknown. There is conflicting evidence whether they act by inducing lesions in DNA, such as initiating carcinogens, or alternatively act as promoters of carcinogenesis. Recent evidence has suggested that promoters inhibit the process of cell-to-cell chemical communication known as metabolic cooperation. Chinese hamster V 79 - 4 cells in culture exhibit metabolic cooperation which can be blocked by the promoter tetraphorbol- 13 -acetate (TPA). Three kinds of mineral dust were tested {{to determine whether or}} not they could interfere with the intercellular communication. The three dusts studied were: amosite, a fibrous asbestos from the Union Internationale Contre le Cancer (UICC) standard reference series, which is a typical carcinogenic fibrous dust inducing pleural tumors following <b>intrapleural</b> <b>injection</b> into rats; ball-milled amosite, a nonfibrous dust derived from UICC amosite by ball-milling, which has the physical properties characteristic of a noncarcinogenic dust; and Min-U-Sil silica, a widely available sample of fibrogenic quartz which does not induce pleural tumors following <b>intrapleural</b> <b>injection</b> into rats. The results demonstrated that metabolic cooperation between V 79 - 4 cells cannot be reduced by carcinogenic asbestos fibers or by relatively large numbers of nontoxic dust particles.

To this end we have tested the effects of the B 2 receptor antagonists Hoe 140, FR 173657 or FR 172357 on the pleural inflammatory response triggered by <b>intrapleural</b> (i. pl.) <b>injection</b> of allergen (ovalbumin, 12 [*]μg cavity− 1) in 14 day-actively sensitized Wistar rats. Analysis of the pleural fluid effluent revealed a sequence of mast cell-dependent inflammatory events, including early protein exudation and neutrophilia and late pleural eosinophil influx. Local treatment with Hoe 140 (0. 1 and 1 [*]μg cavity− 1), FR 173657 (1 and 10 [*]μg cavity− 1) or FR 172357 (1 and 10 [*]μg cavity− 1) inhibited dose-dependently allergen-induced mast cell activation with impairment of pleural plasma leakage, neutrophil accumulation and late eosinophil influx. Moreover, the B 2 receptor antagonists also dose-dependently inhibited the allergic like inflammatory pleurisy triggered by bradykinin (50 [*]μg cavity− 1), which is characterized by acute mast cell degranulation, protein leakage and pleural eosinophil infiltration. Taken together, our findings provide substantial evidence to suggest that bradykinin acting on its B 2 receptors play a critical role in mediating allergic mast cell-dependent inflammation in rats, and suggest that B 2 receptor antagonists may be useful therapeutically to control allergic dysfunction...|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} {{designed}} to establish a pulmonary tumour model to investigate the biology and therapy of lung cancer in mice. Current methods for forming a solitary intrapulmonary nodule and subsequent metastasis to mediastinal lymph nodes are not well defined. Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) cell suspensions were orthotopically introduced into the lung parenchyma of C 57 /BL 6 mice via a limited skin incision without thoracotomy followed by direct puncture through the intercostal space. The implantation process was performed within approximately 50 s per mouse, and the operative mortality was less than 5 %. Single pulmonary nodules developed at the implanted site in 93 % of animals and subsequent mediastinal lymph node metastasis was observed in all mice that formed a lung nodule after intrapulmonary implantation. The size of tumour nodule {{and the weight of}} mediastinal lymph node increased in a time-dependent manner. The mean survival time of mice implanted successfully with LLC cells was 21 ± 2 days (range 19 – 24 days). Histopathological analysis revealed that no metastatic tumour was detectable in the mediastinal lymph nodes on day 11, but metastatic foci at mediastinal lymph nodes were clearly observed on days 17 and 21 after implantation. Other metastases in distant organs or lymph nodes were not observed at 21 days after the implantation. Comparative studies with <b>intrapleural</b> and intravenous <b>injections</b> of LLC cells suggest that the mediastinal lymph node metastasis by intrapulmonary impantation is due to the release of tumour cells from the primary nodule, and not due to extrapulmonary leakage of cells. An intravenous administration of cis-diamine dichrolo platinum on day 1 after tumour implantation tended to suppress the primary tumour nodule and significantly inhibited lymph node metastasis. Thus, a solitary pulmonary tumour nodule model with lymph node metastasis approximates clinical lung cancer and may provide a useful basis for lung cancer research. © 1999 Cancer Research Campaig...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Eosinophils are {{supposed}} to {{play a critical role}} in the pathology of several allergic diseases because after activation they can release toxic and proinflammatory agents. In this study we have hives-tigated whether IgE-metliated rat pleurisy could be affected by an ongoing pleural eosinophilic mflamma [...] tory response. IgE-passively sensitized rats were chal-lenged with an <b>intrapleural</b> (i. pl.) <b>injection</b> of allergen (dinitrophenylated bovine serum albumin, 1 jig/cay-ity) and exudation assessed by measuring the amount of protein extravasated into the pleural cavity within 4 h. We have confirmed that lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation (250 ngJcavity i. pl.) was followed by a marked pleural neutrophilia, apparent at 3 h, which was followed by an eosinophil accumulation noted within 48 - 72 h postchallenge. We have also confirmed that a boiled sample ofLPS pleural washing (LPS-PW, 200 jil i. pl.) caused selective eosinophilia in recipient rats. Pleural exudation remained unal-tered when the allergenic challenge was performed 3 h after LPS m a condition of intense pleural fluid neutrophilia. In contrast, this was significantly re-duced (P<. 001) when the challenge occurred 72 h after LPS or 24 h after LPS-PW in selective pleural fluid eosinophilia. In another series of experiments repeated daily i. pl. injections of platelet-activating factor (PAF; 1 jtgJcavity) resulted in a progressive increase hi eosmophil number recovered from the pleural cavity. The values were 1. 2 ± 0. 2, 3. 0 ± 0. 2, and 5. 8 ± 0. 5 x 106 eoshiophils/cavity (mean±SEM) after 0, 1, and 4 injections, respectively. Allergen challenge performed after 0, 1, or 4 PAF stimulations led to pleural protein levels of 88. 6 ± 5. 7, 33. 7 ± 0. 7, and 19. 4 ± 2. 3 mg/cavity, respectively, mdicat-rng that the allergic pleurisy is inhibited hi a manner dependent on the magnitude of eoshiophil accumula-tion. Furthermore, the impairment of PAF-hiduced eoshiophil accumulation by cetirizhie (30 tug/kg i. p.) restored the exudatory response.

40|$|Chylothorax is an {{uncommon}} disease where fatty fluid accumulates within the chest cavity. Conservative management, including repeated thoracentesis or pleurodesis, {{seems to be}} suitable to most cases. Herein, we present a case of efficacious pleurodesis by <b>intrapleural</b> <b>injection</b> of Sapylin, a streptococcus preparation, {{for the treatment of}} chylothorax. A 52 -year-old non-smoking female farmer was diagnosed as idiopathic chylothorax after we ruled out possible causes including chest trauma, lymphoma, lung cancer, filariasis, tuberculosis, and etc. Two-time intra-thoracic injection of 3 Klinische Einheit (KE) Sapylin achieved rapid and effective control of chylothorax with no severe side effects. Sapylin may facilitate pleurodesis by producing a strong inflammatory response...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} the pleuropulmonary alterations caused by <b>intrapleural</b> <b>injection</b> of silver nitrate or talc in an experimental model, {{in order to}} consider its use in human beings. METHOD: 112 rabbits were randomly selected to receive intrapleural 0. 5 % silver nitrate or 400 mg/kg talc slurry in 2 ml saline. Eight rabbits of each group were sacrificed after 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, or 12 months. Regarding the pleural cavity, the degree of macroscopic pleurodesis (adherences) and microscopic alterations, represented by inflammation and pleural fibrosis, were analyzed. The parenchyma was evaluated regarding the degree of alveolar collapse, intra-alveolar septum edema, and cellularity, on a 0 to 4 scale. RESULTS: <b>Intrapleural</b> <b>injection</b> of silver nitrate produced earlier and more intense pleurodesis than talc slurry injection. The parenchymal damage was more evident with silver nitrate, considered as moderate, and limited to the first evaluation (after one month). From the second month on and throughout the entire one-year follow-up, the parenchymal damage was similar with both substances, only the pleural adherences were more intense with silver nitrate. CONCLUSIONS: Intrapleural silver nitrate produces better and longer-lasting than intrapleural talc injection. The parenchymal alterations, although discreet, are more pronounced when silver nitrate is used, but minimal after two months, and similar to those produced by talc injection during the entire one-year observation period. These effects on the pulmonary parenchyma do not contraindicate the use in humans. Thus, the use of intrapleural silver nitrate to produce fast and effective pleurodesis can be considered in patients in which pleural cavity symphysis is desired...|$|E
40|$|Feeding of baboons with {{crocidolite}} showed {{small numbers}} of asbestos needles 0. 5 - 1,um in ashed tissue of the gut wall, which probably came from iron-containing macrophages. It is suggested that pleural plaques and hyaline nodules in the peritoneum represent a hypersensitivity reaction to ferritin protein coating on asbestos fibers. In South Africa only a few peritoneal mesotheliomas come from the asbestos areas, and the incidence of gastrointestinal carcinomas is no greater than normal. <b>Intrapleural</b> and intraperitoneal <b>injection</b> produces unrealistic situations. Calcium salts are deposited on asbestos cement pipes from hard water and organic material from soft water. It is difficult to envisage asbestos contamination of the water so reticulated. In our laboratories the baboons are not on pellet feeding and have eaten food and drunk water contaminated with asbestos during the experimental period which in some instances has been to heavy concentrations of asbestos for up to 5 years. No macroscopic lesion {{has been found in}} the abdominal cavity or any evidence of abnormality which would warrant taking any more than the usual histological blocks. Examination of the feces suggested the presence of an occasional asbestos needle. In none of the many baboons used was there any evidence of a peritoneal tumor or gastrointestinal tumor. As a pilot experiment a baboon was given 200 mg of crocidolite asbestos into the stomach through a gastric tube at 10. 00 a. m. on a Friday. At 5 : 00 p. m. that day asbestos needles were found in the feces with ease and similarly on subsequent days. At autopsy on the following Monday afternoon, 3 : 00 p. m., asbestos needles were only found in {{the lower part of the}} pelvic colon. Histological examination of the stomach and intestinal tract showed the presence of macrophages containing iron particles in the mucosa of the duodenum and the upper ileum (Fig. 1). There was no evidence of asbesto...|$|R
40|$|Progressive {{recovery}} of rhythmic phrenic activity occurs over time after a spinal cord hemisection involving unilateral transection of anterolateral funiculi at C 2 (SH). Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) acting through its full-length tropomyosin related kinase receptor subtype B (TrkB. FL) contributes to neuroplasticity after spinal cord injury, but the specific cellular substrates remain unclear. We hypothesized that selectively targeting increased TrkB. FL expression to phrenic motoneurons {{would be sufficient}} to enhance {{recovery of}} rhythmic phrenic activity after SH. Several adeno-associated virus (AAV) serotypes expressing GFP were screened to determine specificity for phrenic motoneuron transduction via <b>intrapleural</b> <b>injection</b> in adult rats. GFP expression was present in the cervical spinal cord 3 weeks after treatment with AAV serotypes 7, 8, and 9, but not with AAV 2, 6, or rhesus- 10. Overall, AAV 7 produced the most consistent GFP expression in phrenic motoneurons. SH was performed 3 weeks after <b>intrapleural</b> <b>injection</b> of AAV 7 expressing human TrkB. FL-FLAG or saline. Delivery of TrkB. FL-FLAG to phrenic motoneurons was confirmed by FLAG protein expression in the phrenic motor nucleus and human TrkB. FL mRNA expression in microdissected phrenic motoneurons. In all SH rats, absence of ipsilateral diaphragm EMG activity was confirmed at 3 days post-SH, verifying complete interruption of ipsilateral descending drive to phrenic motoneurons. At 14 days post-SH, all AAV 7 -TrkB. FL treated rats (n = 11) displayed recovery of ipsilateral diaphragm EMG activity compared to 3 out of 8 untreated SH rats (p, 0. 01). During eupnea, AAV 7 -TrkB.
