40|$|Abstract: High quality video <b>format</b> <b>converters</b> apply motion {{estimation}} and motion compensation to prevent judder, resulting from picture rate conversion, and alias, due to de-interlacing, in sequences with motion. Although initially considered being too expensive, high quality conversion is now economically feasible, and since 1995 available in consumer television ICs. This paper addresses {{the issues in}} format conversion and shows recent progress, introducing a new high quality video format conversion IC for consumer applications...|$|R
40|$|Summary: Mass spectrometry-based {{proteomics}} {{stands to}} gain from additional analysis of its data, but its large, complex datasets make demands on speed and memory usage requiring special consideration from scripting languages. The software library ‘mspire’—developed in the Ruby programming language—offers quick and memory-efficient readers for standard xml proteomics <b>formats,</b> <b>converters</b> for intermediate file types in typical proteomics spectral-identification work flows (including the Bioworks. srf format), and modules for the calculation of peptide false identification rates...|$|R
50|$|ECI {{systems can}} also offer {{automated}} aggregation, packaging, {{and distribution of}} indexed content through administrator-configurable channels, which allows flexible reporting and powerful analytic capabilities across {{a wide array of}} data sources. ECI administrators can design the system by specifying rules for the way indexed content should be packaged as well as how and to whom the content should be delivered. To accomplish these goals, some ECI systems are able to integrate with other computer systems such as publishing systems and <b>format</b> <b>converters,</b> often through web service interfaces.|$|R
50|$|The {{latest version}} of OpenWire {{supports}} automatic data conversion.

5000|$|Third {{party and}} vendor-supplied {{utilities}} {{are available to}} convert point of interest data between different formats {{to allow them to}} be exchanged between otherwise incompatible GPS devices or systems. [...] Furthermore, many applications will support the generic ASCII text file format, although this format is more prone to error due to its loose structure as well as the many ways in which GPS co-ordinates can be represented (e.g. decimal vs degree/minute/second). POI <b>format</b> <b>converters</b> are often named after the POI file format they convert and convert to, such as KML2GPX (converts KML to GPX) and KML2OV2 (converts KML to OV2).|$|R
40|$|In {{high level}} {{synthesis}} each node of a synchronous dataflow graph (DFG) {{is scheduled to}} a specific time and allocated to a processor. In this paper we present new integer linear programming (ILP) models which generate a blocked schedule for a DFG with implicit retiming, pipelining, and unfolding while performing module selection and data format conversion. A blocked schedule is a schedule which overlaps multiple iterations of the DFG to guarantee a minimum number of processors. Component modules are selected from a library of processors to minimize cost. Furthermore, we include data <b>format</b> <b>converters</b> between processors of different data formats. In addition, we minimize the unfolding factor of the blocked schedule. ...|$|R
50|$|The company {{continues}} {{to develop and}} release new software. The hardware department now focusses more on Audio Acquisition and <b>Format</b> <b>Converters</b> (such as their iBox range). As of 2010, the Soundscape 32 system and iBox range was still available. One problem is that IDE disk drives have largely been replaced by SATA and the Soundscape 32 units cannot support them. The current focus is to utilise hard disks connected to the PC together with a Mixpander card, providing {{a way that the}} software can operate without relying on the external units. The latest range has focussed on MADI connections, but this is a relatively niche area.|$|R
50|$|So {{that users}} of the 3M Digital Mastering System could take {{advantage}} of Soundstream's editing system, the company developed the M Adapter. The adapter was a bidirectional eight-channel <b>format</b> <b>converter.</b> Data from the 3M Digital Mastering System were converted to the format used by the Soundstream DTR so that the data appearing at the input to the Digital Audio Interface looked to the DAI as if it had come from a DTR. Similarly, finished (edited) data in Soundstream format were restored to the 3M format by the adapter.|$|E
50|$|So {{that users}} of the Sony PCM-1610 Digital Audio Processor could take {{advantage}} of Soundstream's editing system, the company developed the S-1610 Adapter. The adapter was a bidirectional two-channel <b>format</b> <b>converter.</b> Data from the Sony PCM-1610 were converted to the format used by the Soundstream DTR so that the data appearing at the input to the Digital Audio Interface looked to the DAI as if it had come from a DTR. Similarly, finished (edited) data in Soundstream format were restored to the Sony format by the adapter. Sony data were imported/exported at either of the two sample rates 44.1 kHz or 44.1/1.001 kHz.|$|E
50|$|Microsoft makes file <b>format</b> <b>converter</b> filters for Microsoft Word {{for opening}} and saving to Works Word Processor format. Microsoft Office Excel can import newer Works Spreadsheets because the newer Works Spreadsheet also uses the Excel format {{but with a}} {{different}} extension (*.xlr). There is an import filter for older Works 2.0 spreadsheet format (*.wks); however it may be disabled in the registry by newer Microsoft Office Service packs. As far as Works Spreadsheet 3.x/4.x/2000 (*.wks) and Works database (any version of *.wdb) files are concerned, Microsoft does not provide an import filter for Excel or Access. There are third party converters available for converting these filetypes to Excel spreadsheets: For database files (*.wdb) {{there is also a}} donateware utility; for spreadsheet (*.wks) and database (*.wdb) files a commercial solution is available.|$|E

40|$|Massive {{amounts of}} useful data are stored and {{processed}} in ad hoc formats for which common tools like parsers, printers, query engines and <b>format</b> <b>converters</b> are not readily available. In this paper, we explain {{the design and}} implementation of PADS/ML, a new language and system that facilitates the generation of data processing tools for ad hoc formats. The PADS/ML design includes features such as dependent, polymorphic and recursive datatypes, which allow programmers to describe the syntax and semantics of ad hoc data in a concise, easy-to-read notation. The PADS/ML implementation compiles these descriptions into ML structures and functors that include types for parsed data, functions for parsing and printing, and auxiliary support for user-specified, format-dependent and format-independent tool generation...|$|R
