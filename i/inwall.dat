50|$|A {{schematic}} {{drawing of a}} VSI mill accelerator is shown at Fig. 2. Very high speed of particle motion needs to obtain good grinding but high speed must lead to high metal waste. Really it doesn't happen because in an accelerator particles move along same material in special <b>inwall</b> area (3) which is bounded by accelerator body and hard metal blade (4). Material in such region holds by centrifugal force. Wear plates (2) and cone (1) use also to avoid wear and tear of an accelerator body.|$|E
40|$|Based on {{the theory}} of elasticity, the {{analytic}} solution of temperature stress on shaft wall of coal mine with reinforcement on <b>inwall</b> is deduced. It is shown that with the increment of reinforcement stress Pa, the radial compressive stress &sigmar become larger, the vertical compressive stress &sigmaz become less, while the circumferential stress &sigma &theta changed from compressive stress to tensile stress. The stability of shaft wall enhanced with vertical stress reduced by reinforcement on <b>inwall</b> of shaft wall. Compressive steel plate {{could be used to}} reinforce the <b>inwall,</b> characterized with low-cost, short time and construction easy. While the intelligent equipment should be developed further to provide everlasting and greater reinforcement on in wall of coal mine shaft wall...|$|E

It is showed that the model predicted temperature matched the measured value well and the average errors within ± 5 °C were 86. 9 ％. The model results also showed that for every increase of 100 °C of the initial temperature of the chamber <b>inwall,</b> the average molten steel temperature increased by about 8 °C. For every blowing extra 50 m 3 oxygen, the steel temperature increased by about 7 °C...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. At present, {{the dynamic}} {{analysis}} for non-stationary stochastic noise of ceramic paste inner stress {{is a difficult}} problem because a non-stationary stochastic noise has a time variant model and dynamic characteristics. In this paper, dynamic analysis ability of Short Time Power Spectrum (STPS) was systematically studied and improved in accordance with theoretical research and simulation analysis. The pressure signals between ceramic paste and head <b>inwall</b> of vacuum pug mill were studied so as to obtain {{the distribution of the}} ceramic paste inner stress. Experiments about the pressure signals had been carried out to verify the research result. Theoretical analysis and experimental result shows that: STPS with filtering performs well in analyzing non-stationary stochastic noise of ceramic paste inner stress in mutation situation. 1...|$|E
40|$|We have {{developed}} an innovative structure for enhancing {{the performance of the}} fiber based 3 D DSSC by integrating optical-fiber/TiO 2 -nanowire-arrays hybrid structures with cylindrical counterelectrodes. The TiO 2 nanowire arrays are grown on the optical fiber using liquid phase deposition method and platinum is coated on the <b>inwall</b> of stainless steel capillary tubes using electroless deposition. The 3 D DSSC is made by sheathering the tube on the fiber structure. In comparison to planar illumination geometry, the efficiency for the 3 D structure has been enhanced by a factor of 3. 6. An absolute efficiency of 6 % has been demonstrated at an optimal length of TiO 2 NWs (12 渭m). This study demonstrates a new methodology for building flexible and high-efficient fiber based 3 D solar cells that can be expanded to concentrating solar cells. 漏 2011 Elsevier Ltd...|$|E

This work was performed under a strong magnetic stirring. After stirred for 2 h, the mixture {{was sent to}} an improved electrospinning setup, which was equipped with a heating capability. Then a voltage of 12 kV and a distance of 21 cm were set to the experimental setup. After spinning, SiO 2 :Tb nanofibers were collected on a clean silicon wafer in the air. Finally, the as-spun samples were pretreated at 1, 200 °C in a close round alumina crucible with a graphite <b>inwall,</b> i.e., a carbothermal environment, for 1 h, and then annealed at 1, 250 °C for another hour.|$|E
40|$|Based on the {{adsorption}} of analytes in {{the sampling}} loop, a time-resolved dynamic dilution introduction method {{was developed for}} negative ion mobility spectrometry to continuously monitor end-tidal propofol without other sample pre-separation. The dynamic dilution characteristics of propofol and moisture in the Teflon sample loop (4 mm o. d. and 2. 4 mm i. d., 150 cm length) were both theoretically and experimentally investigated. The prominent absorption differences between propofol and moisture on the <b>inwall</b> of the sample loop allowed their concentrations to be time-resolved during the injection process, realizing sensitive measurement of end-tidal propofol with a response time of 2 s. At the optimized carrier gas flow rate of 700 mL min(- 1), the linear response range for propofol was achieved to be 0. 2 to 20 ppbv with a limit of detection (LOD) of 65 pptv. Finally, this method was performed on a patient undergoing mastectomy surgery to continuously monitor the end-tidal propofol with an interval of five respirations and the result nicely demonstrated its fast response to the propofol changes...|$|E

This paper illustrates the case study of a building located in this particular area of Rome on which the energy consumption and environmental improvements, resulting from interventions such as retrofitting of technological systems, are being evaluated. An integrated design model can resolve issues relating to building maintenance, energy conservation and the integration of renewable energy sources. The study will focus on the identification of high efficiency and low environmental impact systems that are best suited for buildings of historical value placed in complex areas such as town centres.
